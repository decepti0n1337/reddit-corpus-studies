Mage's amplify magic effects ur life tap too. Black belt technique. Good on fights you dont take damage. As jblock14 said you are wasting global cooldowns life tapping. Every lifetap is 1.5 seconds you arnt casting shadowbolt. Thats why major manas and runes are important to essentially increase ur mana pool, they do not trigger a global cooldown.

yes a hit neck is bis for healing priests. moron

(Horde) got to exalted in approx 3 days(casual playing, 8-17min queues), around 45-50 games, 235k honor. I lost initial 2 games because of Rush zerg meta of alliance, then i started asking raid leader for assist, organize and optimize raid groups, ask for some defenders to follow me, and stall allies and retreat.
---

---
Got 15 wins in a streak, then 1 loss, 10 games winning streak, 3 losses in a row(alliance adapted to our turtles) agaisnt good premades) then some wins to exalted.
---
How to maximize reputation and honor gain
---
- Defend, most alliance are pushing.
---
- Loot Bodies
---
- Turn in all Loot and defend base/gy's/towers with your life!
---
I was averaging around 800-900 rep/game.
---
I'm on skullflame EU. Server felt just as dead before the BGs as it does after. phase 2 really put a noticable dent in the population.
---
I don't have data for that! I could have tracked Alliance honor/minute in the BG, but don't have queue or reputation information and decided against it.
---
I feel sorry for you for commenting something this stupid.
---
I got it with no riding skill. Pally 40 mount, Ram for 60.

any idea how much honor that would equate to and how fast those kinda games are?
---
And we still have to consider the Q times, but they might be similar to AV but I dunno, will have to wait and see on that. But all of these factors will determine what the better honor grind will be.
---
Everything that you said proves the system is flawed.  Seriously, when will we get the first report that someone died from playing AV for 4 days straight.  What's the point, there is 0 skill involved in this crap, the novelty has worn off and people are going to quit because it's garbage.
---
&gt; But... you don’t need better stuff for PvE unless you’re competing for for world first or speedrunning world record.
---
What kind of mentality is that? I want to improve my character. I could probably clear Naxxramas with my current gear that doesn't mean i dont need gear anymore.
---
&gt; And for PvP? You don’t need it either since when you’re rank14 you have basically finished the game and if you go to WSG afterwards, you’ll met pug or team with average players 95% of the time that will get crushed by your team.
---
I like playing PvP. I enjoy AB and WSG. I already play those every now and then at the moment and we face good premades all the time. 
---
And again... wow is an rpg game. Its only natural wanting to improve your character.
---
That's a nice one. :) 
---
I was farming for Crusader Formula, and when I had it up on AH a friend of mine whispered me if I could take it of for him, as he didn't have the gold ready to go. I wanted to give it to him, but he didn't want to accept it cause he knew I was farming for gold. He insisted on paying me lowest AH price as soon as he got it but I didn't want to accept that from him. Basically two guys negotiation being too soft on each other.
---
So we set up a game;
---
Deathroll from 1000, I win he pays me 200g (roughly 70% of AH at the time), he wins he gets it for 150. 
---
I lost the roll, but I was happy to help him out while getting some gold and vice versa.
---
Yeah, I just gave up on leveling herbalism while leveling my character (not sure why) and ever since I hit 60 I've been too lazy to go back and keep leveling it. Think I will judging by all of the comments here though, seems like it'll be my best bet in the long run. Thanks.
---
73° to 76°F
---
This isn’t him you fuckin midget
---
Dps warriors will have a hard time finding groups for dungeons. Because why would another warrior want to bring someone to do the fun part and also compete on gear? The answer is they wouldn't.
---
Nah it’s that one time use item that summons a felhunter, dropped by a rare mob just north of the GY in duskwood.
---
But I have my heart set on the Mistsaber :(
---
Thats not real temperature
---
Shadowfang Keep? Don't think I've ever done that dungeon period. Maybe I'll try it out tonight. Thanks.
---
Swords are better for hemo yes. What do you have against dagger PvP specs tho?
---
Exactly this. I don't even bind it
---
Main tanks have t1/t2 already
---
Using such a long queue time average for  quick losses is somewhat flawed. One of the biggest reasons queue times are going up is because the games are lasting a long time. You should be using a much shorter queue time average if we were all going for quick losses (like day 1 and 2).
---
Well hes asking people to adapt to the fact that you can basically afk in AV and get an absurd amount of honor, i was just wondering since he told people to shut up and adapt if he had any ideas of what adaptions people should make. It seems silly to tell people that they shouldnt complain about a problem when he cant offer a solution. Im not demanding anything im trying to have a discussion.
---
Must be nice....
---
So you made two threads. Ill reply here too. This exact problem was related to heat, or lack thereof in my case. Either that or it just went away just as i turned the heat up. Never had this issue again
---
Progressive is a trigger word now?
---
So for alliance there is a massive- I mean MASSIVE amount of coordination on discord.  
---
I did all my rep grinding from honored to exalted in like a couple days.  
---
They just have a queue channel with hundreds of people, someone does a count down and everyone queus at the same time then they post in the chat which BG # they got and split off into designated channels accordingly.  
---
Each match was taking 7-10min
---
You assume it is mostly people try-harding some meta?
---
I don't play Alliance because my racial options are Human, short human, short and fat human, and non-white human with long ears. I want to look cool while playing. I find the races completely boring. It's why I picked Horde over 10 years ago, and why I picked Horde again.
---
Nice ninja edit with a quote from the added content to try and make me look like an idiot.
---
Can you show me any kind of evidence or context for your claim as to why PvP servers are designed for the kind of players that want an advantage from the word go? If that were the case, we would have published realm populations so people knew which faction was dominant. Sounds completely made up sorry bro.
---
Hypothetically speaking though - let's say you are right. PvP servers were designed explicitly for people that wanted an advantage. Firstly - we are back to player behaviour/psychology from the word go. The person is the problem, not the game. Secondly - if you were correct, why would anyone join Alliance to start with? Based on your logic, every single person that rolls on a PvP realm rolls horde - for the PvP racial advantage. Thirdly - what kind of financial incentive is there for Blizzard if one faction gets sick of corpse runs and FP camping and stops playing/unsubs?
---
Honestly bro you are starting to project a bit now, and your ninja edit says a lot about your integrity. Typical horde...
---
You fucker
---
Expression. Stereotype for people who smile like that in photos.
---
Accounting for queue times, wins yield at least the same honor and more reputation than losses, on average. The summary and raw data are in the OP. I am posting this because it is not an opinion, it is an observation, for which I provided the data. "Right now it's about honor and a fast loss with a fast queue is better for honor in every way" - your hypothetical fast queue followed by a fast loss not only does not reflect reality, and would still be incorrect if there were no queue times. That data is also in the OP (see "Without Queue" rows).
---
If longer games lead to ever-increasing longer queues, I am unsure. I am curious to see how the queues play out as Alliance seem to be finishing their reputation grind before the Horde.
---
Make sure your bags are empty before you go.  There are also a couple really nice Twink items in there that will sell well.
---
r6 BiS w/ MC gear + Epic mount, plz send me an inv!
---
I don't know. Smells like some kind of conspiracy. Someone call Jesse Ventura
---
I disagree. Stop scremaing you whiney bitch. Hit is clutch.
---
This is dumb, rank 11 epic mounts are only 90g
---
I dont know what you GPU you have, but make sure its capped, because i normally play 200+ but certain places such as dungeons where your fps spikes even higher up, i get like 600 fps+ but also starts to kill your gpu as the load will prob be 80% or higher like mine was.
---

Please! I’ve been thinking about this for so long. I feel like the only way to do it is with a script
---
alright fatty
---
wait what. We get more mana from taps wirh amp magic?
---
Honorbuddy is dead and there’s nothing on the market that is nearly as coherent.
---
What are this raid frames...blocking off so much vision. Hideous.
---
I'm not saying it takes skill to get rank 14,  but it was also not 1.12 AV racing as the *only* way to gain efficient honor... 
---
Regardless blizzard is using a more modern queue system and not the original vanilla queue system, allowing only alliance players to premade AV and not horde players... its a problem.
---
Can you please explain how to do this
---
Pretty fair conclusions. I also enjoy the more intense PvP, but I'll be doing much more WSG now that I have my mount!
---
This ring is hot garbage for pvp
---
The only way to adapt is realizing how stupid the system, ignoring it and doing something else.
---
What? On my client it's capped at 200
---
Fuck you must be one sad pos.
---
This will get a large amount of upvotes if this place has any humor.
---
Can EU transfer to US ? I cant do shit in EU raid times because of my juurb.
---
\^ this, it's called "Spiked Collar"
---
you found one?
---
Check the flair
---
You simply miscalculated. Taking into account the current date (we had more than 8k active pvp participants last week), 20 people could jump from rank 13 to rank 14 in a four week cycle if nobody from outside and inside the guild is not disturbing the brackets.
---
holy shit imagine getting 900k honor and not bothering to get the 15 kills so you get a shit rank anyways
---
Just get the grid addon.  Will solve your problems.
---
Articuno
---
Percent of rankers in that rank at any given time
---
yeah but I often get a ton of things done while sitting in the queue. food, laundry, cleaning, etc. it's kind of awesome.
---
The decision is easy. Suck it up that you lag for 5 minutes when getting your buff once a week. If you change the raid days after the guild is up and running you are a terrible GM.
---
Unfortunately, no :(
---
Taken from their Classic paid transfer info:
---
*Characters can only transfer between realms and accounts in the same region. (EU, US, Asia)*
---
Blizzard doesn't give a fuck. They pay monthly fee's, and you aren't gonna quit wow just because there's botters. Free money 4 blizz!
---
I suspect this is his second account.  This character isn't in a guild and has never responded to any whispers.
---
They’re both instants and don’t reset your AT like slam does.
---
I Might just start leveling a new char then i can switch to US realms right or will i need to sub on a diff wow account? sorry for the dumb questions aha
---
Good point, I didn't think of that. I'm not much of a PVE guy tho ;D
---
IF burning crusade is ever released.. do shammys get a dps boost? Thinking about making a shaman alt but don’t want to be stuck as a healer forever
---
honorbuddy isn't hosted anymore. doesn't mean it doesn't work with the classic client if you find a copy
---
Badtank finally left? Thank god
---
Those 3 are all solid.  Warrior less so if you don’t have that pocket healer you mentioned.
---
It indeed is, moron. Disc/holy doesn't have hit talents and you don't want your fears/dispels/damage to get resisted, so most serious pvp priests use star and sash/clutch to get closer to PvP hit cap.
---
you say that, but this smells of bad faith
---
This is ridiculous. I’m ally on Fairbanks and the server is super healthy and a blast to be on
---
Can you explain deathrolling? Every roll is from 1-42000? or Do you lower the roll each time.
---
Yeah, its just the juxtaposition of a legendary with blue shoulders made me raise an eyebrow :P
---
Nobody has ever died due to snus/snuff ever. Basically candy is more dangerous
---
i dont think you want to use t2 helm its trash
---
Whelpling
---
Hm so you only need 250 to transfer and coordinate brackets for easy rank 250? I dont know it seems doable given there are already cross-server premades.
---
Sorry yes. I meant if ppl don't bracket and U only have 1 to 2 in each bracket it would take 4.5 years. So not bracketing means it won't happen.
---
The numbers you posted are maximums. It is possible for a server to have nobody at r14 even after it has become possible to have acquired that amount of Ranking Points.
---
Car insurance ?
---
Tested this and did not get ghosting the way I do with WoW. What does this indicate?
---
Wsg is only good to do before 50 since it’s the only choice.
---
Nah, people think that if you don’t zerg Drek then you want multi-day games. They hate competition because they suck, they just want epic loot for AFKing in an BG.
---
That's kind of how I thought about your comment. 
---
If you have a "proper group" then you can easily beat the entire game. Depends on what your "proper group" is for certain tasks but no shit if you have a "proper group" you are fine. 
---
&gt; Ivus actually is not that difficult to take down if you have a proper group 
---
In case you didn't realize why I was saying what I was saying.
---
You want to look cool but you didn't choose Dwarf, NE or Gnome?
---
Orcs look ok but the other horde races all look ridiculous.
---
U don't want to use lobo in raid b/c of the debuff
---
True, I assumed fighting meant loving, I misread.
---
&gt;First of all, it didn't have the same epic feel for me that the notoriously difficult 40-mans did.
---
Are you actually implying that 40m raids were harder than 25m? I mean, maybe from a logistical point of view, but when it comes to actual tactics Vanilla raids are a joke compared to TBC - only Naxx kinda compares, even in AQ40 half the bosses are little more than tank-and-spank. Heck, ZG and AQ20 were harder than most 40m raid bosses.
---
&gt;  Secondly, getting gear from raids no longer seemed important to me because it was useless in pvp. If I'm going to invest my time into raiding, I want to be able to use that gear in other situations. Literally the only point of getting raid gear was so that you could kill bosses faster... that's it. And as a big PVP fan back then, it just wasn't feasible for me to both raid full time and run arenas to stack resilience gear. 
---
Are you basically complaining that you can no longer queue into PvP and trounce ppl who play PvP 12+ hours a day even if you never touched PvP before just because you have vastly more gear than they do?
---
Nicol Bolas
---
Stick with swords, especially if you'll be first in line for vis'kag. Hemo swords is just as good as daggers in PvP too
---
Combat Daggers is fun and the full PvE spec is viable in PvP. I have both rends and was raiding as swords but switched to daggers after I got CHT. Damage in raids may be a little lower with daggers until you get familiar with the spec.
---
Also play ally on Fairbanks and I world/quest leveled from ~47 to 57 exclusively in P2 (Tanaris, Ungoro, Felwood, a few dungeon runs) and it really didn't suck that much except for the last weekend before BGs. Great server, can only get better.
---
Pfew you're really good at this trolling stuff. I can't really understand why people get a kick out of it but if it makes you happy.
---
I think to some people, continuity is important. And a 50 lb gnome warrior (pure physical) doing the exact same physical damage as say, a 500 lb Tauren, carrying the same weapons and what not, doesn’t really have any continuity. Now every game needs to decide how far they are going to take immersion and what will be realistic and what won’t, but it *really* doesn’t require much thought to see how ridiculous a powerful level 60 gnome warrior is.
---
We don’t take kindly to multiboxers round here
---
It matters very much for the horde rep grinders
---
qs r past already, none even on Firemaw anymore
---
*Mongoloid with a stick*
---
I like to imagine you're saying this to store clerks, the guy at the post office, the cop who pulled you over and all manner of people who couldn't care less
---
Agreed, have you seen a female orc rogue with t1 shoulders? Horrendous
---
With random numbers, the only logical arrangement would be putting them in numerical order. With dates it doesn’t matter which goes in which place, just matters how you learned it. You gain no advantage doing it either way.
---
ty for the comment. It was from a 6 hour ZF grind, 46g an hour, so guess with the flurry axe i made on average 74g an hour
---
But do you absolutely *need* it? Our MT is a fury Tauren, and we clear MC less than 2 hours with a less than 2 minute Rag. No wipes.
---
Fury is a trash guild that, if it survives to AQ, will be limping along. The only reason they're competitive at the moment is they have over 400 members.
---
If you listen to Skarms stream it's really evident that the leadership is abusing it's casual players and seeing as how they struggle to loot the hounds I can't imagine they make it to AQ
---
overall it's warlock.
---
every shot from your gun or bow is shooting money at mobs. pet upkeep is straight money you prob didn't have to spend if it didn't need to be kept happy.
---
lower levels the hunter is going to level faster, but after 40 the warlock takes over unless you are a goof and still using your voidwalker.
---
hunters have better survivability when things go pear shaped or in areas with a lot of spawns due to traps and fd though and can generally take super tough elites that a warlock might not be able to handle. but the warlock will grind faster, more efficiently and for less gold cost overall.
---
Where are you getting the Crit % from?
---
Should've had the camera zoomed out a lil more to show the filthy keyboard and bags of chips and dust under the screen
---
I've seen 8s a few times.
---
I totally understand the joy of making your character better and having played video games all my life I’m certainly not saying it’s wasting your time or a bad hobby but... after a certain point it’s just addiction.
---
I mean there’s a difference between saying:
---
* I can probably clean Naxx with my current gear but if I spend 40 hours farming that rare drop, I would get 2% better and it would probably help. 
---
* I can clean Naxx with my current gear easily but if I spend 1200 hours jumping on top of Orgrimmar bank, I’d get ‘banker trinket’ that is 0,2% increase in DPS
---
One is ok, the other is insanity and my opinion is that playing something as mind numbing and solitary as current AV for 12 hours or more each day for two months is closer to the second than the first.
---
For PvP, I would take a gnome war over any other racial. Escape artist is just so good for warrior. Yea, orc stun is ok, but that don't stop you from getting frost nova'd!
---
Got a link to that Alliance premade AV discord?
---
The meta I'm seeing now in my battlegroup is this (horde-side):
---
Rush bal/lts, with a token force intercepting alliance to slow them (usually frost novas/traps). After that, forces split. 10 port back to defend, the rest split up to IW, SP, and Aid station, in the hope of cutting off the alliance defense.
---
The goals are these:
---
1. Maximize rep/honor from the bonus objectives.
---
2. Stall the alliance long enough to still win, usually involving at least one wipe in the horde base.
---
3. Create a race to kill bosses, with both sides trying to min/max kill time versus surety of victory. Go too fast or don't deal with defenders, and you lose more time than if you hadn't rushed.
---
Above all, you want a net imbalance in favor of offense for both sides. You start getting 20-30 on defense and you CAN hold out against almost anything. But that's when you get hr+ games. You want to secure the key objectives and the juicy NPC kills while ensuring a kill of Van. If the alliance outraces you, so be it. You'll win your share though, depending on how well your team holds to this rough sketch of a plan.
---
No changes

Didn't think about this. How easy is it to get matched against your desired win trade partners?

Had a friend drop a few $100 on Black Friday sales for KD:M. I probably would have done the same if classic wasn’t a thing.

Sorry, I meant for rep on hks, since you can afk rep farm as well.

Hello fellow OSRS player
---
&gt; now with AV honor farm bots occupying a large chunk of the top 100 ranking spots
---
How do you know it's a large chunk? I'm sure there's a few but you're acting like it's out of control. Blizzard has only improved Warden over the years and they've been attacking the bot companies themselves.
---
You'd be surprised at how many people have no life in this day and age.
---
Are we playing in the same server? Sound like you haven’t played since BGs came out. It was that bad during the initial P2 wPvP honor grind. But since BGs came out it’s in a really good spot. 
---
This can most likely be said for any Horde heavy PvP server too.
---
Flamelash would be a good server for you.
---
Hey all, happy holidays! So I was just released for a two week break and I plan on leveling my warrior a bit. He’s currently level 33 and I just had a question on professions. I currently have blacksmithing and mining and have been leveling those as I’ve gone, both around 150. Would it be wise to keep going with those or should I go something like herb/alch to help with leveling with the pots I might make and money with the herbs I’d find. I’m generally pretty unaware of most classic stuff so I’m in a rut on what to do, I’ve just been seeing a lot of people recommend herbalism for money and figured I’d just pair alch with it.
---
Gnomes shouldn't be allowed to wield 2 handed weapons due to their small stature.

"Honor" in WoW is the most ironically named resource in the history of gaming.
---
Apologies, I read that quickly thought that was per day. 30 minutes isn't too bad, could easily have a couple 60s by now with that short a commute.
---
Hunters are certainly excellent at kiting, as stuff like solo tribute among other things attests to. And yeah I'm aware of the Majordomo strategy, and I myself have been called upon to do the kite strategy for UBRS' Drak. I do agree that hunters are probably one of the strongest 1 vs 1 classes in the entire game, and that has value, I just feel like stuff like mages MAYBE being weaker (though even then they top charts in Raids with frostbolt spam often enough) but then having amazing AoE on top of generating water and portals is just nuts. Other than like tracking I really feel like warlocks do a lot of what hunters do but even better. They might not be AS powerful for pure sniping but I feel their strengths in other areas make them a better and more versatile DPS anyways.
---
What the hell? Of course corpse camping is a form of RP. By your definition not a single hostile world pvp interaction is part of the roleplaying aspect of the game
---
Hey team - I'm a Fury warrior (orc) trying to determine what the best weapons for me to go after are, and having trouble finding a place that lets me compare - I see lots of general 'go for axes!', but not direct comparison. For example, I currently have AotDW, Brutality Blade, and Flurry Axe - I *think* I mh BB and oh Flurry, but have had people say that AotDW/Flurry and AotDW/BB is right. I have 12% hit.
---
tl;dr - is there an in-depth itemization guide (or sim) anywhere that can help me answer more complicated itemization questions?
---
Aurastone + OH is arguably better for utility and healing but if your a feral druid it's a great place holder since your last in line for that. I got it in my first MC raid months ago and have used it in pvp since then its a great Stat stick for druids. however as AV just released feral should be getting UF as their pvp Stat stick. Last night I finally replaced it with aurastone +skull/tome for flag running.
---
All That said it's a super cool wep and now that nogginfogger is fixed you can skelly wack people with it in cat/bear form. It just ages poorly as more content is released but since no one wants it usually an easy snag, especially ally side.
---
+5 weapon skill is 3% hit? Do you have a source for that? I always thought it was way less than that.
---
&gt; I was never a nochanges advocate or anything
---
We could have used more. It has turned out to be a much lesser product than it could have been, in large part because of layering and megaservers and cross realm.
---
supposedly &lt;Fury&gt; is concluding with an alliance guild (tempo) and feeding them aq mats over neutral ah in return for help securing world boss kills for fury
---
dunno if its entitled conspiracy talk but considering those screenshots of fury trying to extort a guild for sulfuron ingots its not supirising lol
---
kind of hope fairbanks isnt really dying but from what i hear another top guild just decided to transfer off. dont want to spread rumors though so wont say who but we've already lost 3 guilds in the top 5 on wclogs. now my guild is talking about transferring too because people are getting scared
---
Those damn babies can get through any crib
---
Transferring doesn’t reset raid lock outs
---
TIL: Working at wal-mart equals being unable to use a spreadsheet AND being able to use a spreadsheet makes replacing half your guild super easy.

AV made horde much more civil now, i don't get killed by 5 rogue in anywhere i fly to anymore
---
In my experience I have literally a 100% win rate as horde if wipe the alliance offense. Sample size isn't too small either, exalted and 500k honor grinded in AV. If alliance offense wipes, they never seem to restart it, and horde eventually wins. A lot of the time it requires summoning icelord, but we always win.
---
It's pre bis and arguably bis for orc furry warriors. Although, the price varies I think you undersold it. But as others have said, you still "found" 180g so enjoy it for what it is, use it as a learning lesson lol.
---
Emulators and roms
---
I spend the odd game preventing back door ninjas on the in base gy, I stall the horde in my case from having the gy by like 6 minutes. . . I would get like 2hk's from the av until the very end.
---

 It's 5 weapon skill, and yeah, here is a source but feel free to search yourself if you question it. https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Hit
---
So many questions. What is this "Speaking as"? What is that layout? And most importantly, why do you have IE on your bar?
---
Go destro and you don’t need to cast fear
---
I've noticed a lot of the auctions on my server will sit for days or weeks hoping for a desperation buy. I wouldn't infer what others are really willing to pay for it from a single entry.  
---
You may have missed out on some gold. But you also got a bunch extra for no additional effort.
---
I've been seeing alliance defend more at the start recently. 
---
And if their offense wipes, they always turtle. Never seen alliance successfully restart a real offense after their first rush fails.
---
Here lemme fix this for you “Don’t roll a rogue if you wanna play battlegrounds like a stealthed warrior” 
---
If you are opening in the middle of an enemy group you are doing it so... so... wrong. As a dagger rogue you’re capable of murdering most enemies quickly unless they’re in plate. Why not use this to murder a priest or Druid before other dps can peel to you? Even if you die and take down the healer, that takedown is worth a lot and will often be the factor in who wins the battle..
---
I would expect nothing less from a mid-2000s MMO...
---
Came back to say you told me so on a topic that was time sensitive? That makes a lot of sense. Glad you were right - a week later hahahahaha
---
Improve. Adapt. Overcome ^^^^your ^^^^desire ^^^^to ^^^^have ^^^^a ^^^^life ^^^^outside ^^^^the ^^^^game...
---
Go to fight club discord. There is a dps spreadsheet that you download and can sim everything on.
---
Right back at ya.
---
Playing rogue and camping IF for cheap kill is not skill btw
---
dual wielding enhance was super fun in tbc
---
I have heard/experienced lag issues but that's about it
---
Can u play bfa or just make a lvl 20 character
---
Felwood is the spot in a hour I can leave with 10
---
First sting their mana, then drink their blood
---
All druids are furries and this confirms it
---
Ya...no. Look into my gaming history and you will find I have been consistently worlds best and server best in multiple MMOs. Take you jealously elsewhere.
---
Shamans were pretty good in tbc. They also got hex, making them a more desirable class overall
---
hows life going? the real one i mean
---
Great game
---
I believe the proper terminology is *PoM/Pyro* Mage. Get outta here with this "Arcane Fire" bullshit.
---
Yup. As much as people use this as an insult...this is true lol.
---
Having dual spec would ruin the game? Lmao.
---
The original introduction of dual spec was great. It costs 1000g (or maybe 1500g) which at max is 20 respecs, but it still cost you as much to respec within each.
---
So with a larger investment you could have two different roles within the game. 
---
That's not going to ruin anything at all.
---
If you're still farming REP after all this time you're irrelevant
---
I promise you that I do participate in the BGs.
---
If only they released the pre-nerf AV. Too bad no one told them the post-neff version was a bad idea.
---
Ohh so Classic WoW? It’s going great!
---
Greetings fellow 📝 and ✏️ geek! ♥️
---
Too easy to exploit if you have opposite faction friends.
---
I'm on Sulfuras Alliance, Shogwat. Hmu and I'll give you some secrets :D
---
sad
---
Nope.
---
Don't think people are complaining about overpopulated servers as much as imbalanced servers. Overpopulation isn't a problem unless everyone is doing the same content (early classic when leveling zones had too many people to quest effectively).
---
I see your point on not needing big guilds, but large populations promote open world encounters, pvp, and usually a good economy.
---
Ever type /silly as undead female?
---
Good luck. You just lost the second biggest ally guild on fairbanks. This server is soon to be 80/20
---
A pvp spec that you can dps in is hardly a memespec
---
If you wasted enough time to hit R13 not getting R14 is definitely something you regret.
---
I was glad I settled pretty early on to peak at R11.  Helped a ton of players hit their R14 without having to sacrifice my soul myself.
---
And you need the MC gear to beat the content that's coming out next... Op making it sound like gears for nothing
---
Yes
---
It's rare that a shitpost actually makes me Ree.
---
What are you talking about? I have a wife and kids and I just finished putting my son to bed after making dinner and spending time together and it's only 9. Now I just ignore my wife and play till 1:30 and go immediately to bed and get a nice 4 &amp; 1/2 hours of sleep. Easy!
---
What’s the music towards the end?
---
Hell yeah, thank you!
---
its your life do whatever you want but live with the consequences and dont whine when no one wants to be around you besides your efriends
---
Don't know why this is being downvoted. I quit my endgame alliance on Fairbanks months ago, it was pretty much impossible to get anything done without getting camped - and that was in *phase one*, before there was an incentive to do so.
---
Screenshot rules my man, you put on the sickest stuff you have.

&gt;Don't think people are complaining about overpopulated servers as much as imbalanced servers. Overpopulation isn't a problem unless everyone is doing the same content (early classic when leveling zones had too many people to quest effectively).
---
Overpopulation is what led to imbalanced servers, tho. I mean, even a 75-25% divide, for example, hurts a lot more on a pop of 5000 than a pop of, say, 1000. Because if the pop is low, your chances of meeting somebody else (even from the other faction) are comparably lower, and this might even cause certain forms of grief to become less profitable, which in turn makes the server more livable.
---
&gt;I see your point on not needing big guilds, but large populations promote open world encounters, pvp, and usually a good economy.
---
2000-2500 peak pop is more than enough to sustain a functioning economy - assuming that, by functioning economy, you mean an AH where you can always be expected to find what you need to buy (especially as far as consumables and mats go).
---
Yea idk, still not that crazy to me.
---
Im in a hardcore guild tho.
---
Glad you like it :) feel free
---
The more the Horde stall the Alliance rep grind, the shorter their queues.
---
Yeah i get that

Think my highest stat on my btw is like 95 or 96 range. Pushing 90s combat stats, like 79 Herby, 87 farming, 73+ smithing. Think I'm at 82 Slayer, I boosted with wild pies and got my abbysal whip. Think I'm like 20qps off a qpc.
---
Oh I'm also 21/24 on barrows items :/ couldn't get a guthans helm. Maybe when I go back I won't be burnt out on barrows and I can complete it. I had been working on getting a d Warhammer too. Think Im pushing 1k kc without anything.
---
Well, shitty as it may be I at least said to to not stress it. I still can read your reply as it’s not showing.
---
I’ve encountered so many bots I wouldn’t be surprised seeing one getting r14 tbh
---
Bonfire?
---
How's that a guild effort lol? The ingots maybe but that's it.
---
Well then its time to play the real wow.
---
Thanks was a fun project. Hand animated the shoulder fire rest is particles
---
But I mean who is more entitled to the gear, the guy who afks all day every day, or the guy who wins battlegrounds all day every day?
---
Lok'Tar
---
He must have done a bunch of adjustments to Miks then. I'm still working to learn some of the setting available.
---
Ofcourse, didnt even understand the question.. it will increase the profit with the price of the mats.
---
fLaMeS
---
This is me exactly. Level 55, just chilling in Stormwind inactive. I don’t know if I’ll ever get to 60 because I don’t see myself raiding or doing the honor grind. Was really, really fun for a few weeks.
---
None of this precludes r14 weps being crazy good, and people farming them outside raid (split runs or not) time as quicker access to better gear.
---
&gt; Casually grinnd 5ish hours a day
---
Maybe he's on some really big server but I'm rank 7 atmo and I'm max 2 hours a day. People really overestimate how hard it is to climb until rank 10.
---
You can still climb slowly with relative little effort.
---
fair enough, to each their own. i rather grind rl and equip myself with real muscles, knowledge that helps me achieving my goals and people who are in need; developing worthy character traits rather than r14 items/titles, meet new people from different cultures, have deep conversations (not game-specified) see real waterfalls, taste the ocean when im breathing, feel the warmth of the sun. i never experienced those things in a chair on a coast in azeroth tbh. 
---
but hey i have also been living in a bubble spending a lot into binary numbers, some people like living in bubbles i just popped it for myself.
---
[removed]
---
Who would I be irrelevant? I don't have the time to farm 40 hours of AV in a single week lol.
---
damn what does that word mean
---
I don't get it though, gambling is against TOS and i had a friend who was suspended once for betting. I guess no one reports though but on a stream seems like Blizz could care.
---
You have to click them in first, then they start running back to the base.
---
If they survive they way back you can turn in items to activate them.
---
❤ SKT Syndra :D
---
I thought I’d only do AV for rep but I’m doing it for honor now too since I seems to give more than WSG
---
Our guild got an Eye and 24 hours later he had his Hand of Rag. He had a lot of guild help and we were fine with helping.
---
We were talking about 60 lvl mobs lol
---
Horde Warriors who do not tank or do gathering. How do you make money?
---
it takes a couple of hours.
---
Living the dream grats
---
Why is it so bad
---
You don't just "buy KDM on a whim."
---
If you're doing that, then money was never an issue and the subscription has absolutely no impact on your finances. Either that or you need a serious intervention for that spending addiction when Classic is over for you.
---
Ok so how do I right click range attack on hunter? It’s driving me nuts.  I’m spoiled lol.
---
This will all be rectified once all of  you realize to give up on trying to rank up and just pvp for fun.
---
So by February I bet this is another non issue.
---
I was new to wow. I had the same issue, except the quiting part. I started on horde warlock on a PVP server. Hated it, so I made a druid. Liked it better but still wasn't satisfied. So I made a rogue. I loved it, but then P2 dropped and I realised I made a mistake by rolling on a PVP server.
---
So I came to bloodsail buccaneers alliance side to try it out. I made a warrior. I love my warrior. I have a few prices of pre raid bis. I'm lvl 55 atm. I love being able to dps, and I love being able to throw my plate gear on and tank dungeons if I want fast groups. 
---
I just liquidated all my accounts on the PVP server and will be transferring all the gold over to BB to put into my warrior so I can afford my epic mount at 60. 
---
I'd reccomend rogue or a warrior. Or maybe a hunter if you like solo farming in the world and in dungeons.
---
Does a free action potion also prevent polymorph?
---
Don’t worry too much about stat weights. Str and agility are good but the other base stats are pretty valuable too. You can just say stam=str=agi=int= spi and you will be perfect. 
---
For spec savage fury is better. It’s hard to shred reliably in pvp and also costs mana because it’s best with powershifting. Savage fury is good for cat and extremely good for bear which you should use in pvp far more often than cat.
---
exactly kek
---
You literally described retail. The best part about classic is, sure, there may be new raids and slightly better gear in the future, but MC gear will always be competitive. It’s not like there are new expansions that will just render your character useless and have to restart the entire process over again.
---
And if it’s not this, it’ll be something else. Literally every patch and version of WoW? Cheaters gonna cheat.
---
This game hasn’t been fair or balanced in 15 years, it’s not going to start any time soon sadly.
---
Pre nerfed AV lasted till near end of vanilla.Which is why blizz fucked honor/ranking system realising  it this early
---
I did bear talents while level and tanked dungeons while leveling. Was great.
---
Nope
---
Running lowbies through dungeons is a good one
---
Warrior solo is terrible
---
I was in AV as a rando horde team.  We had about 2/3 the alliance from Fairbanks, so I'm assuming it was a premade.  We ended up beating them.  Honestly one of my best AV memories so far.  It was a pretty short match too.
---
Thanks for all the replies guys.
---
and who cares? let the nerds be nerds. if they do something 18h/day they dont even enjoy to feel big in a 15y old game who cares.
---
i play wsg exclusive with my boys and we have a blast. av rep i will finish in months maybe nobody forces you to do it in the first week.
---
maybe time for some fresh air
---
I can go into WPL cave and find 2 nature protection potion recipes in an hour and make 300g
---
i love osrs please!
---
Sometimes I enjoy walking around the cities in first person with altZ, its a great way to relax.
---
That is amazing.

Escape Artist and clout
---
As a lock you destroy other classes in pvp, soul link is de facto the best 1v1spec in all of classic and sm ruin I do more damage than most mages I see plus provide way more utility and outlast them. The utility of sm ruin in slowing lots of players so your squad engulfs them and with the drop gg you just win along with the insane dmg you do with crits is great. Use robes of volatile power with dls lock specks in pvp they let me crit for 1666-2400 with shadowbolts and I get to have a feldoggo so I can never be silenced or polymorphed if I play right. He can see through stealth so I one shot rogues XD
---
Challance accepted, this is Mograine right?
---
Blacksmithing is only profitable if you manage to get your hands on certain rare recipes like Lionheart Helm. Unless you're lucky enough to get a rare recipe, it's a gold sink.
---
There's not much money to be made in engineering either, it's purely for utility, like thorium grenades. Engineers just don't make much of anything that non-engineers have use for.
---
enhance shamans are garbage
---
I don't know a lot about specific warrior economies, but somewhere between 3 and 5 gold per person per run sounds about right
---
Batman!
---
Definitely. A month of WoW costs about as much as one drink at a bar in the city where I live.
---
Define good economy?
---
For Raid PVE, you should only ever use weapons for which you have weapon skill. Simply going from 300 to 305 weapon skill lowers your hit cap on level 63 bosses from 9% to 6%.  AND it boosts your white damage and rage generation by about 10-12%. It's easily the most important dps stat in the entire game for warriors.
---
Between  AotDW/Flurry and AotDW/BB  they are about the same dps for you.  But, Flurry is still slightly better because of weapon skill.
---
So yeah, use axes and only axes in Raids.  Also, you have far too much +hit. With 305 weapon skill you only need 6%. Then other stats like Attack Power, Strength and Crit become far more important.  More hit is fine, but it's value is much lower past 6.
---
Presumably means non-racist/homophobic/etc.
---
You realize you turtling caused less Alliance to queue giving you longer queue times right?
---
Fairbanks horde here. AV queues are roughly 10 minutes for me lately. Around the same for WSG. I support your aid to refugee alliance. Come join Fairbanks so I can gank your lowbies.
---
My buddy just farmed scarlet monastery at 60. He’s got his epic money and a good chunk of gold always lying around.
---
It is PURELY BGs that has caused this
---
source: 3 60's
---
Strength is better for DPS thanks to Heart of the Wild, which only affects strength in cat form. That talent was changed in Burning Crusade to affect all sources of attack power, which made agility better, but not in Classic.
---
I leveled to 60 (and tanked my first 1-2 Molten Cores) without any bear talents other than Feral Instinct.
---
Improved Shred doesn't replace Savage Fury. You take both talents if you take it. (I skip Imp Shred @ 60, but I had it while leveling for PvP reasons.)
---
Nobody with a brain wanted no changes lol.
---
Shaman didn't get Hex until Wrath.  But they are really really fun in BC.  However I do remember having issues getting into groups because i didn't have a CC.
---
When do y’all bang?
---
If you’re trying to optimize for pve I think it’s +21 shadow wrath green is BIS so with +20 you’re obviously fine.
---
If you truly think that's what I'm responding to...
---
Sure, moron.
---
It used to in classic
---
its a defense against Gnome theifs

It's because when you say a date in American, like December 7th 1941 it goes month day year. Would the rest of the world say 7 December 1941? Genuinely curious.

BWL requires too much mitigation compared to the bear loot available. It's not impossible, but it is the toughest content for bear tanking.
---
It's not a bad idea if you had much more sophisticated criteria than a simple range check but, at that point, they'd be putting effort into preventing botting anyway and we know they don't really do that.
---
I mean I can't unsee it now.
---
Wait til people figure out how to pull Vann without doing the marshals lul
---
THIS IS THE GLOW UP!
---
you mad, bro?
---
I usually show up with 20 but I feel like anything more than like 5 is fine. Everyone’s expected to be at kargath before raid and ride out anyways so you hardly need to summon and you can drain mobs in mc for everything else.
---
lol im working full time+some overtime but no wife or kids and im on my 2nd 60 raiding and pvping on both actively. Its really not as hard to hit 60 as some people make it out to be
---
Why would you bother? Use shadow wrath for dps and felheart for PvP. That is all.
---
This is also based on how the Alliance can pull Drek alone with a snowball and kill him without having to do anything else. If Blizzard actually patches that, then the Alliance will no longer be able to do those super fast wins.
---
Also isn't the snowball thing abusing an exploit, and therefore bannable?
---
How's leveling shaman as elemental? I think I'd prefer enh... but I'd like to be able to switch over to heal a dungeon easily from time to time; and as ele I'd already have the gear (and eventually some skills) for it.
---
Oh yeah, master loot.
---
I assumed it was for the trolls setting group loot to white and up so every drop spammed everyone's screen.
---
not super low prices and not over inflated
---
It's so useless in pve that my guild gave it to a moonkin(after the shamans/warriors who wanted it had it of course) just to piss people off.
---
Sounds like you need game time.
---
Nobody cares that alliance is technically better in organized pvp. Not a huge percentage of people are going to be doing rbg style premades so the 1v1 racials are going to be way more important.
---
We had someone snowball Drew into a wall and evade him. We still won but it caused a full reset.
---
Oh damn. I didn't know you could snowball Drek lmao
---
I don't think there's any collated data out there that compares price norms between all servers atm. All you're really going to get are anecdotal statements from people here saying "I play on X and black lotuses cost Y for me"
---
LF invite, almost full raid bis geared mage, coker, toep, mageblade (rank 7 currently)
---
That guy looks extremely well geared. Do you think those pulls are possible without as good gear?
---
Shhhhhh
---
Just pick herbs
---
Is it me or do gnome tanks los every 2 seconds? Grats in the hammer :)
---
Havent been on osrs since classic came out got a max normie and 2100 ironman collecting dust
---
Actually the loot drops is VERY repredictable. Law of large numbers.
---
If you actually run through 5 maraudons, you will get between 35-60 gold, if you run through 10 maras, you will get between 80 and 100 gold, and very quickly you will catch up to the actual gold per hour which is about 45.
---
Officially we use day/month/year. Or at least the federal govt does. Source: am federal employee. 
---
That said day month year is equally as dumb as month day year. In common speech you don't mention the year, and the American method actually places the larger value first, similar to our system of counting numbers. So for every day usage I actually very much prefer the American standard. But for full dates that include the year the US system is dumb and the EU one is good. 
---
But anyway who cares.
---
i am amused, angry and confused at the same time. well done.
---
Here's a tip. When AV pops. Reopen the av menu. If your av # is at the bottom of the list, it's a fresh match. If it's near the top or middle of the list, it's a god damn turtle, let it find its own way to the water.
---
spending 50 silver to make 20 gold does not defeat any purpose.

Yes but Americans(and a lot of Canadians) would say December 19th. Though oddly enough they call their national holiday the fourth of july, lol.
---
What about Gehennas? My server is essentially dead.
---
Except we could literealy the opposite way, with the bigger number being on the left. That makes American dates better, since they would say today is December 19th(bigger to smaller just like counting) but a European would say it's the 19th of December. One extra syllable AND goes against our counting system.

Had this happen to me for the first time tonight. Also wasn’t able to turn the camera with my mouse when it happened.

I enjoyed earthshaker a lot in world PvP during phrase two as underdog alliance. My group of 5 guildes wipe 10+ near MC NPC choke point when my earthshaker double proc. UF is awesome one or one but with group, nothing beat ES proc.

I hate you, good joke though.

On a side note there's tons of people who are primitive enough to still take phone pictures unironically, makes my blood boil.

The fact that you think anyone is jealous of playing wow for 20 hours a day is incredibly sad.

it's not even all twinks. BG's are more fun when you're doing well and being the higher levels means you have better chances of doing well meaning more people Q and wanna do it from levels x5-x9

Alliance don’t want the problem to get worse and the horde don’t want their server to become another flamelash. Everyone knows I’m correct but all have good reasons to make sure nobody sees my reply

you ever tried proper traveling? not the 5* all inclusive beach holidays - just a backpack, a pair of feet, you and your thoughts. most people are too scared to leave their comfort zone like myself when i was a young adult. after getting the highest school degree with 19 years and basically no lifing back then i had no clue what i wanted to do. instead of staying on auto pilot and doing the same boring rotations ingame, i decided to get a backpack and hit the road. because i was unhappy and needed change. i was fuckin bored and needed a challenge not everyone would be willing to accomplish, because "good enough" wasn't enough for me. because i knew i could do better, otherwise i waste god given talent and pure potential for my online-ego. this is where i became a simple man btw, with no comfort zone at all - because i didnt have my own room anymore to hide myself from the outside. i am actually out in the world experiencing and learning! so many people told me afterwards they wouldnt be so brave to do this but this was the only way to save my life. from then on i learned to live life to the fullest, independently and with much more meaning. 
---
two people can see the same tree. one thinks: "tree."
---
the other thinks: "what a humongous tree with countless leaves and branches and all the roots in the deep hidden from my sight helping to maintain life for so many different creatures, also producing oxygen, just standing there through all weather conditions being magnificent while the wind plays musik through the leaves. pure perfection"
---
perspective is everything and most people prefer to stay shallow like "tree." and are satisfied with "good enough". 
---
this is not confrontational btw, i enjoy discussing this.
---
if you think your life's biggest achievment is coded in 0's and 1's thru a video game, which everyone could achieve by spending 20-22 hours ingame per day (what simple bots do as well) than i respect that. but i highly doubt your gf, friends and family care about your pvp rank but much more about your character and the person you are

Stay salty Mr. Scout.

We were crawling with welps by the end of phase 3 last week.

Let's not forget that warriors were basically completely trash for a while until they got reworked. I'm sure 90% of the fotm warriors would reroll if we had to start with actual launch state warriors.
---
You either write down a date or timestamp with the shortest unit of time first or last where the longest unit of time will be last if the shortest one is first or first if the shortest one is last
---
Lets just make an example
---
The time 11:19, the 8th december of 2019
---
Writing it down as a string of numbers, you can simply write it down as 11:19 08 12 2019 or preferably 2019 12 08 11:19

There is absolutely no confusion which one of the 12 and 8 is the month and which one is the day since that any intelligent being realize that the numbers are written in order by lenght of time frame, units that are very specifically defined, and not in "order" of "standard" american speech which is subject to change and also changes all the time depending on which generation of people are talking to each other and which state you live in etc etc.
---
Now you, please explain to us, in detail, why you think the way you write the date is the correct way. Give me specific reasons as to why my date format(s) does not make the most sence. I'd love to hear what you make up...

Back in vanilla most servers had only a small handful of guilds that could even raid 40 man content.
---
10/10 actually got me raging for 3 seconds
---
Horde or alliance? If alliance I'm new myself and have been with a casual guild of parents who use to play back in the day and met some friends from private servers who have helped me learn warrior that I would enjoy introducing you too them all
---
Sorry you don’t have as much free time. You do you.

It’s a system that immediately takes care of actual bots or AFKs. You can’t have it both ways and the community proved it couldn’t handle having any kind of power without abusing it.

I saw the clip yesterday, it's pretty detailed and there's some great discussion.
---
That being said, while I really like Kargoz's stuff; he's always trying to find new and interesting angles and ways to improve his game, these 'guides' he's doing lately are just an unedited 3hr podcast. Which is great, but it's still a podcast.
---
Pre-launch stuff was top tier with accompanying documents and all. Yeah he'd have less time cause he's streaming, playing etc but call it what it is, post the 3hrs, then make a guide based off the info from it.

Thanks to the man himself and the lock discord for the efforts.

I see, thanks. Was hoping for a bigger number thou; but as you said, it depends on the server.
---
I'm laughing at the pain in this post. 
---
Your complaints about world PvP are from pre-BG and not unique to Fairbanks. The rest ... well, not sure what to tell ya about FPs. Battlegrounds rarely won? I can get in and out of AV with a win in 11 minutes - that includes queue time. Of course, BGs are cross-realm, so, again, not Fairbanks specific. 
---
Personally, I agree that you should stop playing. You don't seem like a happy person.
---
Yeah, you guys say it differently though. We don't say the month first.

I'm not saying It Will, I i'd enjoy if It did, Classic is amazing, the dificulty, the community and makes socialize with other people , simply put, it's fun. But It's a 15 yo game... Retail has amazing artstyle, the skill and combat Animations are fantastic, most of the zones look amazing! But then when you play for a while, it's an super easy game, player interaction os non-existantaand gets boring after a while. After playing for 3 hours altho I was enjoying the new zones and combat, I wanted to go back and play classic

Are you transferring to Heartseeker by chance?

horde raid chat: hey anyone want some easy honor? meet me at the lake
---
Hey man I appreciate ur feedback and support through the months I just wanted to put my 2 cents on your point. I wholeheartedly believe this isn't a podcast and actually a guide. We stayed focused and on topic throughout with a clear agenda trying to add as much insight as possible. Thanks for reading
---
&gt;The biggest problem with the honor system right now for me is how insanely retardedly OP the items are you get for r14.
---
uh...you do? i don't think you do. they're Nef - AQ level.
---
Nah, its almost exclusively player knowledge due to videos.
---
Nobody knew the cookie cutter builds, nobody knew that mage aoe farming was the fastest leveling, nor where to do it. No one had Questie to tell them exactly where all the quest mobs were, or a guide on Wowhead that said exactly what zones to go to or where the best Wand dropped for each level set, or what mobs drop the best vendor trash for getting a mount.
---
You had to tell people how to get onyxia attunement, or where to stand on every boss.
---
Its just the vast amount of solved knowledge that exists now.
---
We also had more difficulty that just wasn't there before the last couple kills (this past Sunday/Tuesday), where she seemed to fear the raid WAY more than she used to in P3. I didn't notice any deviation with the number of whelps other than one pull where a ton of them spawned in P3, but I'd assumed that was because we had someone knocked/feared in to them or something, but I wasn't paying attention to whoever it was if there was someone.

Colluding involves things going both ways, alliance get fucked on Fairbanks. We have literally never gotten a world boss, horde owns the server by every imaginable metric. Fury colluding with an alliance guild would be like the president colluding with a 7-11 cashier to steal a sluripe
---
On launch day I had to decide between playing with my guild whom I've known for 10+ years on one server, or playing with my RL friends whom I've known for just as long if not longer on another. 
---
I chose my guild.
---
Around mid November my guild broke apart because half of them wanted to be hardcore and the other half wanted to be casual. The in-fighting reached a boiling point and all of the hardcore guys quit for other guilds. Even some of the casuals stopped playing, and some people have already transferred off the server.
---
I should have played with my RL friends.
---
Stranglekelp too. Farming as shadow I pick it to slow the runs down.
---
Mage has arcane subtlety talent that reduces enemy resistances by 10, and arcanist 5 piece set bonus also reduces enemy resistance by 10. But you are correct that the AV spell penetration ring, and the WSG trinket aren’t in the game yet. 
---
Also curse of elements exists if you have a warlock with you.
---
Bonescraper is a decent oh for hemo. 
---
Brut blade a bit too slow for an oh for pvp imo, usually better off with a dagger of some kind.
---
And I was like " wow that's some serious progress in 3 days"

I found out that you line up the trees like in this screenshot you can easily make the last jump on the video.
---
Let me know where you go, I'm down to follow suit. We should make a guild of us stragglers.
---
That's why they stopped reporting subscription numbers imo. For the last two expansions the game has been turned into a complete grind if you wanted to stay competitive with DPS numbers in raids.
---
Meanwhile I’m here enjoying the game extremely slowly and venturing with IRL friend all over the world to just enjoy each others companies.

Mage is another good option.

Start from Duskwood and mine the whole way to Booty Bay and back. Stop to pick up the engineering patterns in eastern STV, they can be marked up a bit. Plenty of Tin-&gt;Mithril veins.

The best? All you do is grind for 18 hours a day. What PVP skills are you showing off beyond the fact that you can waste 18 hours a day for months.

Hes just outright lying. Look at his post history. He posts in 3 video game subreddits almost explosively. LoL, path of exile and WoW classic. There is no possible way he's involved in all 3 of these extremely time consuming games while also working 40 hrs/week and having a wife and kid. Hes a basement dwelling NEET.

Coarse, heavy, and solid Stone are my main sources of income. Ridiculously easy to farm and always in demand with PvP being bigger.

My 34" ASUS had a similar issue with blurring when moving around in WoW.  I suggest going into the settings and turning off any post processing like turbo mode, anti blurr stuff, blue light filter, anything like that.

I, the guild’s token enhancement shaman, am  passing on the eye when/if it ever drops to another shaman who can and has been investing heavily into the *opportunity* to make Hand of Rag.  Yeah, it’ll suck for me but he’s making investment I simply cannot match.
---
It’s usually a guild effort but when someone makes it a point to do nearly all the legwork necessary.... it’s earned.  I’ll be cheering loudest when he gets it.
---
I mean it will lol. Classic is already bleeding players and we're not even on phase 3 yet
---
Fast games are the best way. There is years of evidence and testing among many players who are hardcore devoted to it. Your math is incorrect. 1 persons 1 day of work isnt going to outsmart thousands of people doing years of work
---
Sounds like you're reminiscing on personal experience.
---
I can never get over how people can be nerdy enough to play World of Warcraft yet be ignorant of how to take a screenshot.
---
The only players bleeding are bfa zoomers that never experience wow before WoD.
---
I'm looking at the wiki for 1.12 and i'm not even seeing anything about av. Are you talking about an earlier patch?
---
That's the best possible reply. 
---
Take an upvote.
---
The problem here is not that this guy as going trought free alterac rush, the problem is this guy was obviously AFK most of the time, and its not his first time because i'm sure he as just stack up Honor mark from alterac to get this score.
---
Hey, long time druid player and leveled one in classic too. Doing raiding as a bear tank. I leveled bear tank through every dungeon and definitely enjoyed it. 
---
My two cents is that regarding stats, they are fairly equal. Equal enough that you see both responses in this thread. I think if I had to pick one I'd go agility, as I like the crit for a burst of bear threat. 
---
On bear vs cat talents, it definitely depends on play style but some talents are better than others. For example, on the second teir, Primal instinct (threat + improved stealth) is much better than thick hide (+armor). The armor benefit is small and does not benefit from bear form's modifier. Brutal impact (longer stun) is totally optional and really helps in solo play to heal yourself.
---
My personal preference is to grab bear charge and feline swiftness, then pick up furor. I feel faerie fire can wait, as I get along pretty well with moonfire for pulls. After this I'd focus on cat dps talents like blood frenzy, but let improved shred go for awhile as I don't intend to dps many dungeons. It doesn't give back much in solo play. Primal fury is nice but not needed to tank, definitely the other choices are better.
---
You indicated world pvp, and I think that furor is super useful for cat dps in that regard. It's a good burst of damage, and makes alot sense when paired with improved shred.
---
2 weeks in a large portion of the playerbase were 60 when a decade ago it would've taken people months. Vanilla is just a solved game
---
&gt; gear you get from rank 14 isn't even that good
---
Are you joking? As an Orc Warrior I'll be using R14 axes until Naxx, R12 legs until Naxx, R13 shoulders until AQ40, and R12 boots until I get the boots from BWL.
---
&gt;by raiding gear that is much easier to obtain in a later phase. 
---
"Easier to obtain". You can do a raid for an entire year before you get your chance at certain items.
---
Rorschach
---
I've only been raiding for 3 weeks and have seen 2 of them, and lost both of them.
---
This got out of hand quickly.....As a note I haven't played sense first release when classis wow was just wow.  I was the one of the first Druids in Firetree to  ding 60.  After that it got boring. So, I moved on to another game call Life.  You know how it works....went to college, got laid, got a couple degrees, got married, had a few jobs, got a career, had a few kids, started a company, sold a company, did some traveling... now it's back playing  "classic wow" ....sorry I may have forgot a few thing in my absence....Truely do appreciate the advice though.  God bless!
---
Everyone whispers me when I cap, it's hilarious. Almost makes me want to do it more. I'm not ranking hardcore and I don't give a crap about your honor, I just want to have some fun 2 shotting clothies.
---
For those on W10, windows key + alt + s lets you select which area of the screen you want to be screen shotted.  
---
Earlier versions of windows have a snipping tool that does the same thing, but as it doesn't have a shortcut out of the box, you'll have to make one for it yourself,
---
The area that you select is added to your clipboard. You can ctrl+v it into anything that lets you, be it paint, imgur, or reddit. A lot of people seem to think that you have to paste it into paint, and then go to e.g. imgur and upload it as a file before you can post it to reddit. You don't. Just paste it directly into the submission.
---
I've been raid lead twice. it's forced ffa.
---
All servers on retail feel this dead. There's phasing and people teleport all over the place with dungeon finder.
---
Had 2 people get teleported into the front of Onyxia where MT tanks her, first time it ever happened to us. Dunno wtf was going on hahaha
---
Eat me, you fuzzy marshmallow.
---
Not everyone wants to invest the kind of time and effort you're talking about just to leave their goddamn city. Its fun every now and then but its a goddamn game, sometimes people just wanna play it without having to find and coordinate a group. 
---
And to reiterate: eat me. I've been playing WoW since 2005. There is no community anymore and pretending there is is pure delusion. What exactly IS the community you think you're experiencing? Because I sure as shit haven't seen it. Fuck, theres hardly even any guild community anymore with so many people coming in and forming guilds with cores from other games/retail/etc so you have 15-20\~ people in a guild who are their own circle and a bunch of randoms who they have to bring along to fill out raids and barely interact with outside of that. You jabronis have been hiding behind "hurr hurr go back to retail" since the game came out whenever people brought up the unpleasant reality that your nostalgia trip and private server fever dreams aren't going to happen on a massive scale in 2019. So please, pretty please, tell me what this great WoW community you've got going on is. Because its probably as fictional as the idea of long-term enjoyment of playing a survival horror game every time you leave Ironforge being a great time from now til end of Naxx.
---
The few bots I've seen farming, I've reported/added and I don't see them anymore after a few days to a week.

Yesterday my gear was full yellow (had to use sickness) went to repair and it was 20g.
---
Warlocks are using Curse of Agony or Curse of Shadows in PvP, not Elements. And Druids can dispel curses if it ever becomes a problem.
---
What am I supposed to be seeing?
---
Top tier warlock play involves 3 aspects:
---
1) Put up your assigned curse in a timely manner on all mobs
---
2) Banish targets that need to be banished in a timely manner
---
3) Always have shards to summon people
---
Leave the DPS to the warriors and rogues.
---
Then transfer or don't get the buff, you don't need it.

The population of the game is very healthy. There will even be queue times to log in on some higher pop servers. You will definitely feel 100x more immersed in a community than in retail.

Comparing yours to [mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ebs2bm/i_decided_to_record_my_wins_and_losses_in_av_as) is really interesting to me.

For example, you had longer games. Had a much worse winning percentage. Played more games. In order to achieve the same goal (revered to exalted). There is obviously a correlation between this stuff.

It is true that lung cancer on the whole is quite difficult to treat (certain types, at least) but US statistics show up to ~20% lethality from oral cancer.

Since TBC people have been carebeared for their gear, in classic get half of your shit from PvE and rock on, or go balls deep and grind like a nerd we all (want to be) are.
---
I hope ppl know it wasnt like this in vanilla.In vanilla they nerfed AV only at the end in small window before TBC and before they stopped giving ranks. AV lasted several hours and wasn't good for honor ,you had to play AB/WSG premades for best chance to rank up. This is really dumb and Blizzard screwed up classic with bad releases timing
---
check out the official server forums to see if there are any guilds advertising there. if you want to transfer, do that first to find a guild that raids in the time that u want.
---
The healing wasn't that hard tbh, a nice break from the normal MC runs. Our first try was back in October but someone turned the warlock into a Wisp so it turned into a normal kill instead.
---
If you throw every dot on ony while she is flying she wont breath fire. Let everyone who gets Aggro move to Tank Position Till the mt gets the Aggro Back. So you avoid people getting knockedback by her tail. It helps also when the majority of the raid Stands more on Front Part of ony so even If you get knocked you dont get thrown into whelps. If she is nearly in p3 dont dot her anylonger and let the mt get Aggro before doing dmg.  Works fine for us.
---
yeah thats the thing it was end of vanilla.At this stage we should be getting pre nerfed AV ,so blizz fucked up.This is not at all how vanilla was
---
ya and with spell damage
---
Merry christmas, man :)
---
Yes, it is possible.  We have had 2 stormrage and 2 bloodfang drop before.
---
Pretty sure I have seen this.
---
Dont forget that last step of classic will last... forever. Who knows, seeing pugs full of tier 3 geared people after a year may be common. Imagine it in like 3 years after naxx. I say dont waste time now on somethin you dont find fun. In the long run itll be all of us in the same gear and it wont matter anyway.
---
One of our Fury Warriors pulled aggro and since Warlocks don't have a taunt our tank grabbed aggro to ensure it would be a smooth kill in the end.
---
Non-frost mage is the most unexplored+viable spec in the game now.
---
Same boat.
---
i was (kinda) mistaken
---
ashkandi is comparable. otherwise, AQ. 
---
for casters, hwl spellblade + AV offhand is bis til you can get femur + twin emps oh (or the blue phase 5 hit/crit/sp offhand from strat) 
---
end of naxx? you can use them til then, sure, but there are replacements along the way
---
I don’t understand why ranking with a queue would be better. You still have to stay queued as much as the competition and some people are getting that slight edge wpvping in between games.
---
Holy Paladin.
---
I would love to see a screen cap of this
---
the hardcore vs casual issue seems to be very common with good but not great  guilds from my experience.
---
you get 10-15 people who really try hard come in all consumes and full world buffs and try and push for sub 1 hour MC.
---
Meanwhile you have 5-10 raid logging casuals not even in prebis totally ok with doing a 2 hour mc. and both sides usually hate each other.
---
Hey! I am an officer in guild that will be transferring to Benediction early next week and we are going to need to rebuild a bit if you're interested in joining up, let me know!

I mean its bfa so i wont expect a lot of people anyway. How ever what I've notice in Live RP realms is that usuallybthe alliamce is more active side and most people will rp in /s rather than the channels.

Our premade CCs and attacks mage so that they cannot wipe us. We have found it to be a far superior strategy to what is seen in this video.

I feel like druids can cope with this
---
Definitely agree there. Loot council will always be the best when you have a group that actually understand the benefits of it. Unfortunately not many groups as a whole do!
---
Yeah and alot of people get pure enjoyment out of videogames, and of that's what makes us happy, then we gonna keep on doing it.

It does with OBS, but I had to re-add the game window.

BGs are Cross-Server, so it isn’t server dependent. Those numbers are from alliance side that have no queues at all.
---
Stealth tho?
---
It'd be bfa
---
People are doing it for the items, not as a display of skill.
---
I dont recommend it but the ogres in deathwind pass is pretty mindless. On the low end its 20g an hour. But the high end is about 40g. Selling potions, runecloth, and grey items. I got my epic mount there and only encountered 3 other people in the week I spent there
---
I greet you!
---
It makes sense why the devs were/are salty. The popularity of classic essentially shits on their entire body of work over the past decade. It more or less says, “hey, you know all that stuff you guys have put your blood, sweat, and tears into over the past 10 years? Yeah... can we just erase all that?”
---
Retail is a great way to make lasting relationships with NPCs.
---
I just read this as a mainly Alliance player. That is all.

Blizzard is locking all your posts for a reason: the people on the bug forum (for many issues, not just this one, but especially the paladins recently, are idiotic and baseless.
---
Two guilds I participated in at launch have entirely fled classic. It seems to have been a pretty massive loss of players. Most realized they are going to be at a huge disadvantage for pve and pvp because they don't have as much time as other folks to play the game and I don't really blame them.

The purple mail pants are lvl 21 and have great stats, dreamsinger i think. There are a few guides on weapon progression that are worth looking into. You can pick up some of the scarlet set early as it’s BoE and lvl into it in the early 30s

No one can seriously say that mythic raiding and high lvl mythics are easier than vanilla raiding. Vanilla is tedious, not hard.

Don't know why I'm being downvoted anyway. I love the Mistsaber and I think the AV mount is ugly as hell. If I'm spending a lot of gold either way I'd rather be happy with what I get :)
---
There is no wpvp anyways. As soon as BGs came out, that shit died.
---
Pre raid BiS has a few leather pieces. In general you just want to wear the gear with the best stats, regardless of armor type.
---
A fully raid geared fury warrior wears only 1-2 pieces of leather and 1 piece of mail.
---
Looks awesome
---
Sure the preist trinket is a lot better for healing. No discussion.
---
That doesn't mean the shaman trinket is bad though.

This gentleman  [Snowjob\_tv](https://www.reddit.com/user/Snowjob_tv/) gave me this link  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f627xZlZ3x9tRAJwfCNmVMk85v6aTVZhO2\_lTDCu0us/edit#gid=442679981](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f627xZlZ3x9tRAJwfCNmVMk85v6aTVZhO2_lTDCu0us/edit#gid=442679981)  which has armor values of all the classic bosses.
---
This is very interesting so on average classic bosses have 1k less armor on private and ragnaros has 2k less !

Or that lord alexanders something axe.

Have a friend that's at rank 10 right now and I almost feel sorry for him with how much time he is putting into it. I think he just wants to hit rank 12 and be done with it. Won't be surprised if he turns to raid logging for a while after that depending on when phase 3 comes out. 
---
I can generally only manage 3-4 hours a day with 1-2 days of not playing at all and I'm just into rank 5. Not sure I'll ever even manage rank 8. Going into it I knew there wasn't much of a chance at me getting to the double digits. But still trying to get some ranks to see if I can buy the legs since they'd be an upgrade currently. (I think they are rank 8. Can't remember. Been a while since I actually looked it up.) 
---
If I reach the rank to buy legs, or give up, I'll just go into maintenance mode to retain my rank 3 vendor discount.

If you want to bring your alt because your main have gotten all the MC drops there is for that class (hi druids) you should let other mains get loot ahead of you.
---
If you are asked to bring your alt because the raid needs that class I think you are free to roll on gear against mains, It happens once, its bound to happen again, so you might as well gear the alt. However, be a good sport towards your guildmates and dont outroll them on mageblade etc. that mains have been waiting for months for.
---
The old honor system wasn't removed until 2.0, the TBC prepatch. The version of AV we have had its last change in 1.11, six months before the 2.0, and the next major changes to AV weren't introduced until 2.3, a year after TBC prepatch.
---
Furthermore, AV was transformed into its current form gradually throughout the patches; 1.8 removed large portions of the map including the auxiliary factions like the gnolls and the Syndicate and blanket nerfed NPC health and damage, then 1.10 removed even more auxiliary NPCs, and then 1.11 removed many of the guards. The mines etc. must've been an undocumented removal that happened somewhere in between.
---
So no, you're wrong: this version of AV *did* coexist with the honor system for about six months, and a very similar version of AV coexisted with the honor system for more than a full year.
---
One of the top guilds on our server split into two. Allegations were made of the GM stealing from the gbank, drama over the tabard (???), etc. It was reported in our server newspaper, but from what I can gather as an outsider, these allegations are exaggerated/untrue. However, the guild *did* split, so something must have happened.

Having world buffs vs not is the dps equivalent of having aq gear and pre bis. If you want to parse high, keep your buffs, it’s 10x as important as a piece of MC BIS gear
---
Thank you!

Why in God’s name would a feral Druid want ANY dagger?
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you :)
---
Dude, no one cares? What is the point of these posts? You want us to tell you what an ass he is? Is this some new gen shit
---
4 laughs duh
---
What? If it's not 1.12 AV racing, its WSG which requires some level of coordination and skill and that is what people want, not this AFK AV meta...  This game has been played on pservers for the last 15 years and meta has developed, blizzard is completely ignoring everything we've learned the past 15 years.
---
People really take this horde/alliance thing very seriously huh. You can almost feel the childish anger through this post and its comments, despite the efforts to make it look ironical. 
---
Keep going it's very entertaining.
---
Is this from classic or Vanilla? I played with a rogue named Deathsoul who got High Warlord on Stormrage server in back in Vanilla.

That undead standing up straight is amazing

Epstein actually killed himself.

You mean that one level? 🤷‍♂️

If you transfer, make sure you are aware that &lt;Fury&gt; on horde side have 500 people and are a blight on the server. They pretty much exist to make alliance players miserable and have largely succeeded.
---
It's not an enchant. When you right click it it just creates the Hammer if you have the Sulfuron Hammer in your inventory.
---
Keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel better.
---
I'm waiting for v2 to upvote when they film it vertically :(
---
Yeah warriors totally suck with the highest top end damage weapon in the game right now... People that say it’s a bad warrior weapon are just salty.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I play my fair share of video games, but there is nothing to be proud about sitting in a chair for 20-22 hours a day, 12-13 weeks straight, deteriorating your health (mental and physical) to the degree that the Vanilla/Classic R14 grind demands.
---
What I do with my own time is completely irrelevant to that.
---
By the way, you can call me, “kiddo” when your GF becomes your wife, as mine has. Until then, you may want to stay in your lane, which seems to be (self-admittedly) playing games and not too much else.

Please show this to all the Horde guys that constanly go for "RUSH RUSH RUSH WE WILL LOSE BUT HOOOONOOOOOOR". It sucks so freaking much. Especially if you do not want to play a PvE game, but engage in PvP (god forbid!!).
---
Why the fuck wouldn't they just force group loot...
---
This seems less like discussing and more like projecting.
---
I felt the same when I saw it.
---
3 days!? Dude must be paying a lot for that

1.5 years for a 3x return on fictional in game gold seems a bit tedious I don’t think I’d even be playing by the time p5 hits.
---
Also the insane over supply of elemental fire and heart of fire will probs affect prices given everyone and their mum will be pugging zg/aq for gear and bypassing the need for fire resist at all due to gear level/better itemization from later gear

Yeah, had two rogue helms drop for my raid once.

Though not the guy you asked, I would simply not PvP for rank. Maybe go for the blue gloves for the unique effect.
---
thats why we have 2 raids, 1 for progression/main team and second for alts/socials :) ezpez
---
were pretty relaxed anyway, loot council only for certan items like legendaries etc and otherwise we just /roll for everything.
---
few exceptions ofc like hunters are offlimits for cht/bruta until pretty much everyone else has them..

And here I am just waiting for the loading screen so I can understand OP’s point..

I rarely speak for any other than myself.
---
Buuuuut
---
We dont care.
---
&gt;When queues get to 30+ minutes, you'll start seeing the honor grinders flying out to do wpvp.
---
You can use the downtime to get a few kills maybe, but you will still want to be queued 24/7, so it would never get even near as bad as phase 2.
---
No, it's not, agi is better than str and it was proved that calculations favoring str are incorrect.
---
Well i agree with the "fuck assmongold" part.
---
That's why you always play a human female. Why would I wanna stare a a pixelated man ass for 500 hours.

Warlocks have it bad ... no talents for hit afaik.
---
&gt; It was SOOO refreshing to run with a competent group again
---
&gt; but we allow meme specs
---
I really don't want to be mean, but that's some next level bullshit. either respec weekly for 50G, or don't EVER bitch that your guild isn't competent enough
---
Simple rotations are a feature of every spec in classic. Just because your rotation is simply SS (or BS) plus keeping SND up doesn't mean you can't challenge yourself to perform the best you can with that. 20th in dps cause you can't be arsed to spend 50G is just great, just remember you are part of the problem your guild isn't "competent"
---
He could save others from death, but not himself...
---
Our raid group had about 25 hard core ish people. No I'll will towards more casual players but there was a request that people bring elixirs at least which didn't go over well. Our guild fractured but our 25 man core can run mc just fine so we just kind of continued on with slower runs. The smaller guild of like minded people has been a much better experience.
---
Thank you for figuring out my GMs Christmas present.
---
Same issue with 3 raids I joined, thankfully managed to down her with an alt raid but it was rough.
---
Also had an issue with people getting randomly disconnected and when they logged back in they was in Ironforge and this happened to about 7 different people.
---
Getting the Unstoppable Force with decent blue gear is more than enough for entry PvP. Warriors depend on the weapon more than anything else as far as upgrades go and there's very few weapons pre-BWL that come close.
---
Also take the flask trinket reward when doing the lv50 warrior quest. You can thank me later.
---
Azuresong.
---
I Like the claw for its Attack Speed in single target and against casters in PvP.  weopon Speed Doesnt Matter at all in single target dmg. U need to use the +8 weopon dmg on them to make them Shine but i do top 5 dmg in our guild with it + core hound dagger.
---
Awesome, worked that time. Thanks!
---
Since iam european i thought it was 3 days
---
I mean technically it is the best/one of the best options for 1 handing, but druids cannot dual wield in classic and no offhand items give crit/hit. Their BIS offhand for the entirety of classic is Tome of Knowledge which just gives +8 to all primary stats. Until the feral attack power weapons are released, there is no real reason to ever use a 1 hander as feral
---
Meanwhile, even if opting not to farm the insanely OP manual crowd pummeled (and I see why you might not want to use a consumable weapon), feral Druids can get Bonecrusher from a dire maul quest. It gives 1% crit and 30 strength which is equivalent to 74 attack power at 5/5 HotW. Druids do not benefit from weapon speed or damage in form either so it’s a pure stat stick comparison. 
---
Like even assuming every man, woman, and child that could possibly want the dagger has it (tanks? Hunters? Fury warriors?), the Druid can just get something objectively better from a short dungeon quest
---
what is adis? that a new gift you give lovers?
---
What happened there is you had gear in your bags, most likely.
---
When you die to an NPC, you lose 10% durability to your worn gear. When you die to a guard, you lose 10% durability to worn and carried gear (IIRC), to avoid casters getting naked and ganking anyway. When you spirit rez, you lose 25% to all worn and carried gear.
---
If you had enough armor / weapons in your bags, spirit rezzing was almost certainly the cause of that repair bill. It's rare for me to pass 1g on a death, tbh.
---
Is it better utilized on someone else though? Like that's my question. Rather... How is it better utilized by other classes?
---
Dark Irony dwarves, eh?
---
The tailoring recipe at my server went from 300g to its current 10g atm lmao
---
Blizzard should really balance out this game....
---
/s
---
But can't you just take a picture of the screen with your phone? 🤔
---
You can’t put the time needed to get it out of the equation! I mean it’s the whole point of my analogy that you dismiss without explaining why: you have to take into account the real life requirements and what you will gain.
---
How much better is the Grand Marshall long sword in comparaison to the Chromatically sword? or the Ancient Qiraji Ripper? What will you achieve that you cannot without the two others? And Is it worth playing 70hours/week for two months?
---
The guild I just left pulls the pin on raids early because the GM and his posse want to play Diablo 3.......
---
They should really just say don't use a 1 hander for dps there.
---
Nun with fat legs and penis
---
More than half of these are not BoE
---
Because other people don't take showers? Situation is equal to everyone.
---
This ignores 10 years of pserver history where what you're suggesting is demonstrably false. 
---
If there are 2 guilds with enough people willing to bring you into WSG all day every day and carry you to r14, but one guild is more efficient at winning games, which guild will get players to rank 14 first? It creates some level of competition vs. AFK botting AV games...
---
Though I'm not really even concerned with honor farming, I want AV changed so that I can play WSG... Competitive WSG games are fun, even more so when efficient honor is on the line.

---
&gt; And by optimal, I mean far below every rog/mage/warrior on the dps meters. 
---
Lol, no. You'll be below assuming they play optimally too, but the gap behind mages is small. Geared warriors are just ridiculous and basically carry everyone though.
---
If we are using the same strat every week successfully how is doing the same thing this week fucking something up?
---
So it's better to grind materials for a couple of hours than to spend an hour more in MC? Your raids sound like a lot of fun!
---
It works good for redirecting trafic. Playing from overseas, without it its unplayable, with it I get 120ish ms
---
&gt;Leave the DPS to the warriors and rogues.
---
agreed with you til this point
---
a halfway decent warlock in pre-bis/MC gear mixed can easily be top dps caster in their raid
---
im nothing special and when i started raiding in full pre-bis + staff of dom i was fighting other warlocks/our top 2 mages (that all got PI before I did) for top caster dps and would go back and forth on fights
---
same case now. sadly our mages have gotten a lot better gear(like, they no longer need a single item from MC besides a second ring of SP geared) so they typically beat me out by a little bit some fights but its very back and forth
---

Thr best and most epic deathrollin there

The pre TBC patch is what made bots mainstream. I cannot recall if that was 1.12 at FIRST release or not. All I remember is when you could purchase R14 gear with HONOR and NO RANK AT ALL, is when pvp died entirely. 
---
I was part of the botting problem at that time. Because they banned no one at that stage.
---
Imagine being American typing it month/day/year
---
You take off the debuff after breaking the cc so you will only take 1 tick of damage, if you don't need the speed buff to get away ofc.
---
People are still playing classic? Note that's classic

damn and I thought 20min queues were bad

But that's pretty much semantics. Such gear shouldnt be in the game yet anyways.
---
He removed the VOD.  What's the guy's name?
---
On my server we had a gamer notorious for being toxic across multiple games spanning something like 15 years, with a huge cult-like following and a very large and successful guild, get banned for dressing up like a klansman complete with two dark skinned players in tow dressed as slaves at a server Halloween event. He even went so far as to seek out a player that was known to be a person of color in real life, and opened a trade window with him and put into it grape juice, watermelons, and roasted quail (obviously supposed to be fried chicken). 
---
He and his guild denied to all on the outside that what he did was racist at all in nature and downplayed the act as just a good joke and that he was merely dressed as a “ghost”. However, after a US Congressman from California tweeted a controversial screenshot of the player in costume in which one of the slaves could be seen kneeling and saying “Next stop Charlottesville,” on the eve of Blizzcon, and then VICE running a story on the whole thing in an attempt to bring attention to domestic terrorists finding safe havens in gaming communities, one of the player’s own guild members leaked to our server’s subreddit an audio recording of their guild meeting in which within the first two-three minutes alone multiple racial slurs and “jokes” had already been made. They continued to deny that they themselves were racists, that anything they’d said or done was racist, and touted their first amendment rights of free speech. 
---
The hypocrisy, however, was undeniable regarding these first amendment rights. As scores of players from both factions decried their actions, the offenders coordinated mass downvotes on Reddit to bury the story, and on Blizz forums reported en masse any post on the topic as inappropriate and auto moderators would just remove the post. 
---
Ultimately, after days of controversy and heated arguments, the offending player was perma banned. The resultant shock of losing a player that had used all the guild’s (and a good portion of another’s) resources to craft Sulfuras and a metric fuck ton of goblin sappers caused the guild to splinter, forming two weakened offshoots which left the original guild almost completely gutted.
---
Right click it  and go to properties make sure it's not set to read only

You mean the 12th of December 2019? What spastic would say DECEMBER TWELVE 2019 doesn’t even make seeeense.
---
Do you write the time as MM:SS:HH ??
---
I’m not sure where I accused anyone of lying, I just said why people wouldn’t like what I said. I’m happy that you’re satisfied but I’m looking for a more balanced experience
---
Its way better for a casual without a queue, but for the hardcore rank 14 pushers, its torture, the have to join directly after every bg, otherwise they lose out on honor.
---
it's just fun being competitive mate. seeing big numbers melting bossing doing cheese strats to kill bosses fast its all fun for me.
---
Gold is non issue anyway if you play the game more than 10 hours a week.
---
Tell your boys to stop safespoting and we'll call it even
---
Some people afk farm it, it would stop that as well, increasing the range on honour from HKs was not part of the suggestion.
---
Do progression raids exist?
---
No guild drama besides the fact that it's a pve server and they are super elitist types. Pretty much been told ill be getting scraps at best.
---
Had a tank mistakenly roll need on a rogue item and lost it. Had a mage lolly gag and straight up bs for 15 min while I whispered him, asking for a port for 3g. He just flew right off. Whispered me like 3 sec in flight to say "sry can't now I'm flying " . More tiny random incidents with players than guild drama. Just wish my guild did raids more fairly
---
...what?
---
First of all, "fun" is a highly subjective topic. It may be fun for you to just hang out in MC for two or three hours but for others it is fun to just breeze through MC in a well coordinated and group. That needs the buffs and elixirs to work which brings me to the second point:
---
How do you have to "grind materials for a couple of hours" for buffs and elixirs? DM buffs are super easy to get, maybe 20 minute investment by a 5-man group who then saves the ID, Sunflower is a bit more tricky and overfarmed so that is often skipped for regular MC runs. Ony head is literally the easiest buff to get. Elixirs are not that expensive and can be bought with passive goldincome.
---
Flasks are only used for speedruns if we're honest. Flasks in MC is like shooting sparrows with cannons...
---
That is Batman.
---
wat
---
Casters notoriously dont go R14 anyways outside of e-peen bragging rights as you have to farm another 3-4weeks at an even higher intensity than R13 for a weapon combo that's already rivaled by Chromaggugs dagger, Nef mace.   
---
Hell, even Mageblade wont make or break a caster and holds up well enough.
---
Once you get a Staff of the Shadowflame you will immediately dump your HWL staff anyways. HWL MH + OH is holds up slightly better due to AV OH and 70 +sp, but still as mentioned Mageblade isnt that far behind.
---
When people talk about HWL weps they are almost exclusively talk about the melee weapons, because these are the deal breakers which only get replaced at the far end of naxxramas.
---
Now I've seen it all.
---
How is rogue most fun?  90% of the wsg games are vs tryhard premades with 3+healers. All warriors FAP and all healers LIP.  I guess we have different definition of that word :)
---
Do you push for r14?
---
This "no queue time is bad" thing only hits the guys wanting to push really high ranks.
---
Casual pvpler have literally no downside of having no queue time.
---
It’s not the ONLY one ok, but it is the most common format by far, and US is literally the only country to exclusively use MDY.
---
For anyone seriously ranking, they are spending the queue time flying or porting to the nearest contested zone and trying to get honor during that time. A solo kill is worth as much as Balinda in AV. That means while you are chilling or AFK in Orgrimmar, there's another guy optimizing their time more efficiently. If you're just a stone guard or whatever I guess this doesn't matter.
---
For Alliance, back to back queues means the optimal honor gain is just banging the matches out.
---
DPs. This is my first time playing wow so I don't have much exp with other factions.
---
standard FC spec is actually deep resto, usually something like 8-12-31
---
A sensible response for once, I applaud you. I think I even agree, that does seem to be an overbearing sentiment in the US.
---
He deleted the VOD.  Here he is: https://www.twitch.tv/itsmaxion
---
Dude's stream is covered in advertisements and for some reason he's showing videos of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on top of his stream.
---
&gt; The whole point of the old style world PvP was that it was entirely managed by the community and not given heavy restrictions.
---
Where do you get that from?
---
Exactly.
---
And there are waaaay more casuals than pro peeps with r14 ambitions.
---
3 days!
---
This is the first time i had a look at that newspaper. Damn that is awesome! I wish my server had that.
---
Actually. I could make a RP character for Alliance news on ZT. I just suck at formatting graphics etc.
---
I like the font
---
No bucket? What casual talk is this!
---
Albert
---
[This one](https://github.com/jeskej/TotemTimers) works perfectly fine.
---
Executioneers cleaver is godlike after WW axe, I even prefer it over Kang, and its much much cheaper.
---
Scarlet chest, boots, gloves and belt are also good, especially gloves and belt because they literally cost nothing.
---
Same with the valor belt and gloves later on.
---
There is also a ring with some AP and Stam, mark of kern or something? dont know how expensive this one is to, because mine dropped.
---
Sounds fun! I think there are quite some items with %parry increase, notably Draconic Avenger (+2% parry). Take a look here:
---
 https://classic.wowhead.com/items?filter=46;1;0
---
You could try to get some defense in the mix too in order to get your chances even higher. Its an interesting proposition; definitely interested in your further explorations!
---
The biggest problem I (as a complete solo ranker) see in bringing WSG back to the focus of the honor grind , is that would completely destroy my chances at getting rank 14. While aslong as AV is the best honor source , I can easily compete
---
Robe of the exalted is sufficient.
---
You’re suppose to stand ontop of the AV Npc with every1 else to make queuing for av harder
---
i beat most rogues as a warlock and we have some super fucking geared rogues. they beat me some fights but not all. like full-bis type rogues. warriors shouldn't be in the dps-equation though, they're always gonna be better than everyone else assuming decent gear and skill. even then, only the top 3-5 warriors (out of 6-8 or so per raid maybe up to 10 some raids, depends on which raid grp)  out dps our top casters (incl myself) typically.
---
.....this is laughable. Now I agree. Playing smart is a good idea... but gold is by far VERY tangible and the turn over rate is insane. If you're saying he is wrong for choosing a different mount from the AV one then technically maybe so. But the amount is fractional man. I'd also rather pay a small bit more for a much much better and more desired mount appearance. Cosmetic or not it matters. 
---
He could find any one of the dozen of gold grinds avail to him and easily peruse his favorite mount AND plenty of raid consumes and the alike.
---
Jesus Christ. Is this a troll?
---
&gt;When you see people with that gear, you know they nolifed it haha
---
Please explain a single thing that is good about this.
---
Also looking for invite. pre-bis with epic mount, but also full set for pvp. Also a healer.
---
Ur a healer. Go run dungeons like strath live for orbs. Or use ur herb for money. There are a dozen things u can do as a healer druid even. Whether it be selling stuff u farm or jist straight kills and rng. Ignore the salt people are throwing for literally nothing. 
---
Make ur gold up, buy the mount u prefer. And jist go make more gold with ur faster rub speed
---
I'm going to do shower and watch a movie maybe go to the gym and I won't worry about my queue pop. Bye nerd! OP racials come with consequences.
---
&gt;  My server will have as many as 18 R14s a week
---
You're assuming not a single one of them on track for that now will burn out before they reach the finish line or have other stuff happen IRL that will prevent them from finishing the grind. 
---
We'll never have official numbers so it's hard to be proven right / wrong in this regard but I think you're way overconfindent with your numbers there yourself.
---
Let me guess, you and Jeff are on Faerlina?
---
You can level engineering to get the tp trinket to tanaris, saves a lot of time.
---
Yeah. Proving the point. I charge my guildies nothing to tank for them.  If they won't help me out, they will have to search for a PUG tank. I have a guildie give me xmutes when I need them. I can tank scholo for him when he needs flasks. I do a Scholo run for 20g otherwise. I don't tank for free outside of guildies. You can choose to be an asshole to your guildmates and you can leave your reputation on that
---
Exactly, gives people the most possible time to do what the want between raids. Ofc theres some random onyxia raids between there, but in those you can use whatever spec you happen to have at that time.
---
Dammit.. Everytime, everytime i fall for it
---
https://lmgtfy.com/?q=tempo+collusion+with+horde
---
depends, as a non-orc you can wear either CHT or BB and get better results
---
Ah, good to know. I had around 10 fire res item, and around 6 other dps gear along my tanking gear in my bag. Fuck me.
---
This would not have happened if Blizzard wasn't super incompetent and gave us the real AV.
---
God damnit I miss Nost devs.
---
That's what the warlock life is like atm. Fortunately, things get a lot better once BWL drops, and once p4 drops, we become gods.
---
For the windfury totem and the heals, it is just way faster than with a priest.
---
I do it together with my brother.
---
I had 90% pre bis + 2 epics and was arms skilled an my brother was a lvl 34 heal shaman and we need ca 12-14 minutes for a cathedral clear.
---
Just ask a mage for some water before hand so the shaman can regg between the pulls.
---
Pull together 4-8 mobs and sweep them down.
---
1.12 av is NOT no changes.
---
Nost av is no changes.
---
&gt; cater to your every whim
---
Or provide decently working gaming service you make millions of.
---
I joined a guild a week after launch that was very "we're super hardcore and we're gonna be the best on the server". After about a week of being around the GM/officers it had become pretty clear to me that these guys didn't really understand what it takes to keep a guild going, and sooner or later they were gonna do some stupid shit that would lead to massive drama, so I left.
---
They kept things chugging along right on track, doing all the "awesome guild" stuff, mafiaing devilsaurs, multi-raids for increased loot etc etc. I heard some murmurs now and then about drama, but nothing major. 
---
Then about a week or so ago I discovered a large amount of the people I knew from there was in a new guild. Unfortunately I don't know too much about the details, but apparently the GM decided to take all the gold from Gbank (which was sizable with all the effort they had put in) and tried to justify it in some manner. It lead to 80+% of the core raid members leaving and starting their own guild while all the "auxiliary" members were left in the dirt. This was a guild that was looking at running 3 MC groups per week and these days you're lucky to see more than two active members online.
---
But can't you do almost the same with Chromatically tempered sword? 
---
Like you can't have fun in PvP without having the absolute best weapon in game and it's worth ruining your health and probably getting sick of the game? (because back in days many people quit just after reaching rank 14 because how much it sucked and after two months of 12hours/day AV it might be even worse)
---
Nope. Here's the tweet from the congressman about the racist player.
---
https://twitter.com/RepLouCorrea/status/1189949160637775873
---
We are not supposed to have this version of av. Blizzard devs are just lazy or incompetent, or both.
---
Well thats the poop, not even viable as a pvp thing?
---
Entire group go to the ramp, somebody clicks the thing that starts the event and you just kill the drakonids there and its super easy
---
I shoulda mentioned I meant the strictly regulated swedish version. Sorry! Sometimes we use the snuff translate cause there is none. Thanks för the info
---
Are you White Goodman?
---
Did not think of this..:)
---
Do you've party member in your group queing for AV? This breaks your queue somehow and you wont find a match.
---
I guess this is just a "perk" of being in a more casual guild. A grand total of 4 people have more than one 60 and none of us have actually attempted to raid on more than one character.
---
Yes, it is very easy. I did it a few times to get the belt while it was BiS.
---
Yeah, but ihit 1 button and I switch into all plate armor and am ready to tank on a whim. Warrior is a hybrid class. They can shred dps, and tank. Rogue can dps and be a sneaky dps.
---
Anyone who defends the honor system doesn't deserve good faith rofl.  You have to be the dumbest piece of shit to ever walk the planet to even *think* for a fleeting moment that anything should happen except a complete removal of the current honor system, let alone actually having that thought make it all the way to a permanent medium where other people can read it.
---
The vanilla honor system was already the single most toxic, vile, hateful module ever put into a video game, and the classic version actually managed to be worse.  Releasing it the first time can be blamed on ignorance and the fact that the vanilla devs were incompetent (which they were, so, fair), but rereleasing it is willful bordering on malicious negligence on the part of Blizzard.
---
The actual competition is with my own faction. Would rather be on a faction that only gets half of the games.
---
But can you rank on this server?
---
...it took the majority of guilds weeks and weeks of gearing up to beat MC lmao tf you mean?
---
Gnome Warr. Still my most AND least favorite race/class combination
---
There is a better AV with the vanilla time frame. Classic is already a Frankenpatch so i feel like having the 'best of' classic is a valid argument that still remains in the whole 'do not change vanilla' mindset.
---
As I said, it is MUCH easier on races with smaller model. UD is nice example.
---
Rogue with a binding because there were no warriors in the guild at the time. Caused a lot of drama on the server, but everyone kinda forgot about it by now.
---
Except if you have Nvidia experience and am too lazy to change the keybind there.. fak
---
I'm planning on doing just pvp once I get to 60 and get my epic mount, that being said is daggers actually better than sword for pvp for a rogue or is that just a myth?
---
Ah, you are right! Thanks for correcting me. 0.4% is very unlucky, but still within the realm of reason. But damn that sucks.
---
Seems like a waste of time to me?
---
By slacking and not trying to get his items until now, OP is literally damaging his guilds experience and progression.
---
See how that works?
---
The enclave is the guild. Horrigan was the gm. Google it
---
Whole market... Man this is just a game. And unless you are making real money out of it, which would be trespassing Blizzard's terms I guess, one person selling one item way below the average price will conclude his sell and not collapse an entire system.
---
Of course you can make big online gold, and buy the best BOE stuff, thus giving you an edge over some other players, but it has to be in conjunction with a real ability at playing, otherwise what would be the point?
---
Sorry but I don't think you can't put the real life factors out of the equations.
---
Because I get it: rank 14 stuff is the most powerful thing in the game until phase 5 and it can help you boost your dps in PvE a little bit or make you even more dominant in PvP but like I told: there's no challenging PvE content nor there is any competitive PvP scene in classic so what's the point? 
---
Is this all about topping the DPS chart on easy raids and stomping average players in blue that you already dominate even more?
---
I get that it's fun but it's not "play 70 hours/week or more for two months" level of fun.
---
Exactly, I usually have 15 - 20 min que times, and people want to "lose in 7 minutes".
---
When i said that there is no way that it's more beneficial to lose in 7 minutes instead to win in 15 with quetimes that long, i usually just get a automated "REEEEETAAAAAAAAAAARD" response, so I've stopped bothering. (Still trying my hardest to win, along with the 35 other players who don't spend all their time screaming and raging in chat^(or fishing))
---
People who genuinely think an instaqueue is bad ‘because you have no time’ ... what is difficult to grasp concerning the word INSTA? Have you so little willpower? 
---
The button doesn’t force you to press it, you want to farm? Farm. Click button when you want to, BOOM, get in.
---
Queue? Guess I’ll farm, just about to finish up on something? QUEUE POPS, better hurry up and get it done.
---
Could be satire I guess, not understanding something so simple seems beyond me, but who knows anymore.
---
Seems pretty crazy to me with a family and full-time job. Assuming one can get in 3 hours of play-time every weekday, it would require playing an astounding 23,5 hours during the 2 weekend days. Doesn't sound like there is much time to spend with the family if that's the case.
---
This is how it always was
---
They will soon(™).
---
I think this is how it works for Horde because with our queues we do not AFK from games that often but sit them out, even if loosing or turtle games. What I read on the forums is that alliance choose to AFK out of a non rush game a lot.
---
Doesn't your guild allow you to use Corruption due to debuff priorities? Some bosses, due to RNG we warlocks have a rough time dealing damage to.
---
Besides, combining Corruption with an occasional Nightfall really helps out.
---
They are so out of touch, they have no idea what we actually want. 
---
"lEtS aDd SpElLbAtChInG, nO cHaNgEs HuRr DuRr"
---
As opposed to level 30? I guess, but the chance to fizzle makes it less worthwhile.
---
Rolling, but with priority, so if you've not had a piece, your roll is worth more than those who did. If everyone in your loot category had a piece, then it resets and everyone has a fair shot again.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Our Main raid is loot council, and is mostly worked out before the raid starts.
---
Yes, and it sucks. I didnt even almost think about the faction unbalance when i made a toon, cause in my eyes the best racials just happend to be with the most interesting races=/
---
Back in MoP blizzard said it’s bannable due to being a third party changing game files
---
Haha this guy killed 7 allies in a whole week of grinding AV and is now mad that his pve-boss farm didn't allow him to rank.
---
Sweet sweet irony
---
? 
---
I\`m one of those that want to play on the lesser side tho..
---
Lol, everybody's a streamer super star these days.
---
What addon is that for a square mini map?
---
Now that is a story
---
An active player will always make more honor than an AFK player.
---
Yea I understand, But shit you gotta be up soon bud :)
---
Whats the highest pvp rank achieved so far and how long till we see r14s?
---
While the classic playerbase is chalk full of sociopaths and people who need serious psychiatric help otherwise, the system is *not* ok and you absolutely *can* blame Blizzard for releasing it a second time.
---
Are you fuckin kidding me mate??!?!?!? Better base, faster travel to enemy base, easier towers to cap. Holy shit the alliance on this subreddit are the most pathetic thing in gaming i have ever witnessed, big yikes.
---
Why you didn’t take a screen shot for this confuses the fuck out of me.
---
Even your screen resolution increased in 3 months. Grats!
---
haven't had a single invasion on our server yet
---
2 warrior helms dropped once
---
Restorative pots do
---
Theres a guy on my server who's a total cunt. He stinks and i dont like him.
---
I really want rank 10 so that i can get the gear, its really good in both PvE and PvP for me. But to get it i HAVE to play every single day, only doing AV, ALONE since i cant even queue with friends. It sucks..
---
I played ALL god damn week last week to get exalted, i got 360K honor and all this got me was not even 1 full rank... wtf..
---
He didnt get jack shit.
---
They are so high end that they are actually not worth it except for special occasions. They go for 100s of gold on my server wich is never a good investment for what they provide. Gear that provides you the same stats is about the same price. It's just a losing investment unless you can guarantee that you can get a purple out of the run.
---
Can you rank?
---
Alliance reach the base faster, i mean the geography of AV has been known for decades to advantage alliance. Ok how about the fact that horde towers are endlessly easier to cap?? You literally have a safe room to cap, outside of any ranger line of sight....
---
The screenshots go right into a folder in your wow folder called screenshots too
---
Im saying its a shit and a useless addon. And also terribly optimized compared to literally every single other addon.
---
First guild I was in, this was while everyone was leveling.
---
If you typed "Ding" in the guild chat, you were kicked. This was not known by 90% og the people in the guild as the rulle was not in the Guild Info, but only on Discord, somewhere in an active chat unpinned.
---
This resulted in almost 1/3 og the guild bring kicked when a new member, who was not on Discord yet, wrote "Ding", got kicked and the rule suddenly became known to those online, and in the new members defense mass spammed "Ding".
---
To this day when my friends and I, who were kicked, see people from that guild, we start typing Ding.
---
Do you have some special condition or are you just completely careless about your health and wellbeing? I'm honestly curious.
---
Are you mentally challenged mate? Who's means Who is, holy shit you talk crap about my english but you dont even know basic grammar hahahahahahahahahahahahah :D
---
https://www.grammarly.com/blog/whos-whose/
---
You dumb fuckin twat hahahahahah
---
Because in Classic, there's a 16-slot debuff limit on bosses and the debuff applied by SS is usually given to some other class that is more beneficial to the raid. It probably won't cause much of an issue but if your raid is minmaxing, then it's something to be aware of
---
Being the best requires sacrifice.
---
i’ve used it for a few weeks in classic and no ban but don’t risk it if you value your char, it definitely takes away from the feel of your character so stopped using it after a bit
---
So the entirety of your post is based on the assumption that your losses are representative of if you just let them win. What you actually proved is, in games where you try to win, you get more honor when you win.
---
  
---
Of all of your losses were 8 minutes, you'd be having better honor per hour.
---
Yes. Could have been worse.
---
I'd recommend leveling as Arms (primarily for tactical mastery) up to about 48/52 then consider 2h fury.
---
This was my list of weapons I went with:
---
* Crescent Staff
---
* Corpsemaker
---
* Whirlwind Axe (add Fiery if you want)
---
* Ravager (for cleaving)
---
* Executioner's Cleaver
---
* Lord Alexander's Battleaxe
---
If you decide to try out 2h fury, **buy Destiny**. Consider putting Crusader on it. LOTS of people severely underestimate this weapon because its "not slow" so it's usually priced cheap.  It's proc grants you +200 str (400 AP) which is a ton for the level, especially with 5/5 Improved Battle Shout so you're hitting really hard and fast when flurry is up. Remember that fury doesn't care about weapon speed necessarily as it's about buffing your damage &amp; speed to increase those juicy bloodthirst hits. The proc on destiny proc's a lot, as does crusader.  So with the two procs alone you're looking at +600 AP. At level 52. Then consider sprinkling in P1 prebis that you might be getting while leveling up.
---
The spec I went with for 2h fury was essentially getting only tactical mastery/anger management out of arms and then going down the fury tree.
---
Dedication is someone doing a reset cycle of BRD each day until they eventually get their arena chest.  The honor grind is a cry for help and a sign that someone is incredibly unwell mentally.
---
Honestly all I want for christmas (from Blizzard) is the original AV.
---
It would immediately fix ranking for everyone, while simultaneously be a massive content patch as well.
---
The original AV is just so much fucking fun, endless replayability.
---
I can only speak for my server and class, i only need the supreme power elixirs, they are around 90g on my server.
---
I agree, they are mostly reserved for special occasions for now. From what i heard though Naxx and AQ are pretty tough raids and for the first few runs people should take any advantage they can to clear them. Never really raided them though so i don't have much of an opinion on it. Just echoing what i heard.
---
Whats good about it? The innaccurate xp/hr or innacurate gold/hr? Or knowing you have empty bag slots? If only there was a way to find that out without having a bar blocking 10% of my screen
---
Sometimes it be like that
---
As someone who became rank 11 on a new server the week they abolished the honor system - sure they nerfed AV and sure back then people havent figured out the rush mentality up until honor stopped - but this AV is not the breakdown of the entire game. You can easily find 1-2 hour AVs which is sufficient to have the same AV experience with quests and bosses. Getting the unnerfed version isn't a significant change now that 1) people got exalted 2) honor/time is better in long AV, especially with the long horde queue - so the mob mentality will naturally change.
---
You can rank if you want to constantly AV grind, but I'm pretty sure that's every server right now.
---
My point actually goes more into the direction that a well coordinated group doesn't need to buff themselves to oblivion to breeze through MC in a reasonable time. I don't see the correlation between flasking etc and being more competitive. If you need it for your progress, sure go ahead, but other than that, it's just a waste of resources. Of course getting easily available buffs as you say is a different story.
---
Download more addons.
---
&gt; As someone who 
---
knows history, you're factually wrong. The original AV is tried and tested.
---
Yes o would say 19th December (in German)

Hey,
---
This is the subreddit for classic wow which is a throwback to vanilla wow, before any expansions dropped.
---
If you're looking for the sub for the retail version check out /r/wow
---
If you were aware of that just try interacting with other leveling people. Usually they are pretty social and it's easy enough to meet people. :)
---
No mather how small the upgrade a main goes always over alts. With us its mains&gt;socials&gt;alts.
---
A fully MC geared fury warrior?
---
Leather: Wristguards of Stability
---
Mail: Black Dragonscale boots+legs+shoulders, Savage Gladiator Chain.
---
Is this info for leeching only? Because in my games at least half of the honor comes from roaming the map for kills.
---
It really doesn’t work like that.
---
And pretty much all of that list is BoP so won’t be on AH anyway.
---
in my experience allowing alts into runs almost always turns out badly, it wastes everyone's time, and when alts get priority over anyone, it causes issues. 
---
Best GM I ever played with had a wonderful way of explaining his system for anyone bringing an alt to a raid. "You do not have priority for loot over anyone, I do not care why they want the loot, or if they need it, you do not get it if they want it."

Sleep at midnight, 7.5 hours of sleep, wake up at 7:30 and get ready for work, work 8 hours + lunch + commute, and it's minimum 5pm by the time you're home and free. If you're playing 8-12, that means youre spending more time per weekday on the game than with your wife and kids, unless your wife plays too. 6 hours each weekend day + 7.5 hours of sleep means 10.5 hours left each day, so that comes out to 21 weekend hours + 15 weekday hours = 36 hours free for non-work, non-sleep, non-WoW activity. And that's assuming a short commute, exactly 40 hours of work, and no other inefficiencies.
---
Best case to pull that off you're basically splitting your free time evenly between family and WoW, with no other hobbies, activities, or social time anywhere else. Some people can pull that off, but I wouldn't call it balanced, and it's a pretty extreme version of family life to basically work a second job for your own personal pleasure.
---
Of course there are families where they play WoW together and that's their family time, or other ways of managing that level of play time in a way that is more balanced than what I described above, but those are more rare than not.
---
Don't worry, you can always fuck a frog to get rid of your AIDS.

One of our best mages would come to our cleared tribute run every week, go in and claim everything reset and hearth out instantly. Every time. Took a month for us to realize he didn't know how to skip the first pack lmao
---
Historically it may be accurate, at launch the fast loss was imho the best. **BUT these days queues are very far away from average of 7 mins. In last 5 days I haven't had a queue that would be shorter than 10 mins.** So nope, quick loss is not effective these days.
---
I think you should be available to farm lashers in DM:E.
---
If you are an enchant, you can also farm und Alan for small and large radiant shards.
---
I see you are her I too, so Mara run should be ok. Can do the goblin, the princess (get the minor boot speed enchant

Don't worry it will never drop for me after 200+ runs

Nope, he should do what he wants to do, not what you want him go do, lll
---
You saved nobody, you slaughtered the husband in front the wife. I reckon she will take here revenge on Ironforge in the future.
---
Alt+Z is the shortcut for the Nvidia recording menu for 1000+ and 2000+ graphics cards. So that shortcut actually doesn't work for me in WoW.
---
Yep, our guild is exactly like this.
---
The interesting part about our guild, is that "my group", the casuals, have raided at a really high level before, so our knowledge of wow as a whole is immense while the other hardcore half is generally pretty bad.
---
That means that we outperform them generally, even though we dont have the same amount of gear, dont bother with consumables etc etc, so as to be expected, there is some bad blood between us.
---
Nice thanks
---
i am not stating a factual thing. Back then each server had individual queues and was not cross server. It was very different. Maybe you should stop being to caught up on being right. There isnt one global way it was done
---
The way you and all of America writes the date always annoyes me soooo much.

I'm actually finding it really depressing that warlocks with tier1 pieces are looking forward to giving them up for blue pieces with virtually nothing but a fix for the hit problem.
---
Some are 0/30/21:)
---
You seem to have some experience in the mage farming merhods, so I hope it's okay that I'm asking this:
---
I recently got my mage alt to 60 (about a week ago) with the sole purpose of farming money for my warrior alt and since then I've been farming DM east over ZF graves. One run of killing lashers, satyrs and Hydrospawn usually takes me about 20 mins, and then I have some grays, few greens, 1 blue typically (Hydrospawn drop), 1-3 felcloth and random herbs + the gromsblood and dreamfoil I picked up myself. 
---
The "problem" I'm facing is that all the herbs and profitable items such as felcloth or the random valuable items all need to be put on AH, and I've found myself re-listing them again and again without succeess. I've tried various tactics such as putting them on AH during peak hours, and I always have the lowest buyouts, but still I find myself with a lot of unsuccesful auctions in my mailbox a few hours later. The DM east farm definitely has a lot of potential, but I feel that it's drowning in the need to auction almost everything and tbh I'm getting a bit sick of it.
---
I have been considering farming ZF graves because the money pr hour feels a lot more smooth as you can simply vendor everything you loot. However, what keeps me in DM east is the opportunity of getting the odd very valuable item such as Foror's Compendium or some valuable random world epic.
---
Anyway, what's your take on this?
---
If you raid with a good guild, you can raid, and still only spend 3 hrs ingame a week, clearing all content in a single night, leaving the other days for your family and work.
---
It's what I've been doing anyway, and I'm very happy with it. Minmaxing is key to making sure you have as much free time available as possible for other things.
---
1. crossrealm BGs where a mistake
---
2. instant queues are horrible, we can rank and do stuff in the 15min inbetween, alliance has to pvp 24/7
---
3. facing other horde in BGs would be horrible
---
Ironic. He could save others from bad screenshots but not himself
---
Even at maximum efficiency of time management, best case (assuming no overlap between WoW and family time) they're spending 32 hours a week on WoW and 36 with their family. You can talk about time management as much as you want, that says a lot about someone's priorities.
---
The fact you claim there is no real difference between the two is just an insult to the intelligence of the people who have literally been playing it for years.
---
Not only is the difference significant, it's a completely different playing experience.
---
the barrens are the single best zone in the game, they alone are reason enough to play horde
---
I just did ony with a pug earlier today and we had nothing out of the ordinary. Pretty normal amount of whelps. You sure people didn't just get kicked/feared into the eggs and not say anything/admit it? Tiny threat has been very inaccurate for ony for a long time I've noticed, I've taken aggro while still being in the green according to tiny threat. You need people to keep using their threat reduction abilities whether their threat meter says they should or not, it's not a dps race. As a rogue I keep feint on cd most of the fight and vanish when she goes up into the air, since I've been doing this I haven't taken aggro and my dps is still good.

&gt; I assume it’s health related crap about sleeping.
---
Aye, you are indeed correct. Just know that you ignoring it won't make the issue go away.
---
I wasnt there so i dont know what happend and i dont Care was Just trying to give you a tip
---
A lot if not most of our threath with prot spec comes from a shield and blocking. If you would want to tank with a 2h as a pala for whatever reason you would have to find other reliable sources for holy dmg, the only thing that could come close would be something similar to the spelladin build with lots of spellpower, SoR and a fast 2h weapon.
---
I havent tried it and would probably not want to nor recommend it, but The Monstrous Glaive would seem made for such a build, as it has really good mitigation stats and is atleast relatively fast with 2.9.
---
No you don't need 14 for  the weapons you just go 13 for armor. The weapons are prob bis for feral hybrid tho. Idk if it's worth the time. 3 extra weeks.
---
Says the guy still defending horde AV. 
---

---
If you are going the old way sure but this isn't 2005 horde should be going this route and winning as a result. Also LMAO easier towers even in 2005 that was the one thing horde claimed they had an advantage in. 
---
Cmon mate.
---
I make bank as an alchemist by simply buying herbs off the AH when they are cheap and then converting them into potions to sell during raid nights. I make the vast majority of my profit off very common recipes that I either purchased directly from the trainer or bought on the AH for 5 to 25g. Some examples include lesser invis pots, magic resistance pots, regular fire protection pots, greater arcane protection pots. There are a ton more. It is absolutely possible (and easy) to make money with crafting professions without having to buy or farm super rare recipes/plans.
---
Not offended I promise.
---
Just 4-6 more weeks! I will check in with you when I am back to getting more zzzz’s :)
---
Or twitch.tv/nekrage you can check in on me lol.
---
Soccer
---
you SHOULD be forced to make a premade, or find one. Just like you cant get gear without finding a group for dungeons / raids. People putting together skilled premade teams should have the advantage. It doesn't make sense otherwise.
---
Exactly.  This needs to be the top comment.
---
I don't think I'm in the same timezone as you if that comment really was for me.
---
lol I'm still level 48. Been playing since launch also.
---
2k arnor is around 10% if anyone is curious
---
Literally every single item on the list is BoE.
---
2 rogues as a 20man raid with 2 rogues that already have it &gt;&lt;
---
Exactly. Most of the time I find myself getting stuck with so many items that I list over and over on the AH without success. 
---
I am farming DM east (as a mage), but for this reason alone I'm considering doing ZF graves where I can just vendor everything instead - it's way more reliable than AH.
---
*On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me...*
---
yeah but that is lvl 52 i belive, so it would be an upgrade to the executioners cleaver. but at lvl 51 you can get ice barbed spear which is much better and free.
---
Bro I doubt the guy above is doing exactly the most optimal thing and I doubt he stopped playing his main in the meantime. In reality he probably has over 20 days played time since release combined and he thinks that is casual... wtf.
---
&gt;made out of people who is native language is not english

&gt;made out of people who has native language is not english

neither make sense. Stay in school.

Yikers.
---
Went to Gnomeregan in the early Classic days with a group, broke my only weapon, ran out of ammo and pulled the entire instance 4 times with my pet. And rolled need on the final boss weapon with all that +str.
---
It was glorious.
---
The rest of the group (guildies) found it hilarious that I literally ticked off all the huntard boxes until I wiped them the 4th time (this time it was really preventable). That run is still a meme within our guild and I am a proper obedient hunter now. But boy, did we laugh about it later.
---
This game made my GPU literally catch on fire last week.
---
Not gonna have access for ~1 month, thanks though
---
people wanted patch 1.12, so anything deviating from that is change. 
---
You can't just cherry pick contents from different patches and still maintain no change
---
Another tip with snowballs: it seems you can yeet the druids and shamans when they're at the summoning spots and they are sometimes unable to path back, ruining the summoning.
---
Sounds like you should replace your 3Heads with 5Heads.
---
Well you need more than 2% don't you? Why is this a surprise?
---
Can’t really check for the next month - wouldn’t call that lazy, thanks anyway
---
double this
---
well, fuck those guys.
---
This is strange.. I was extremely excited to play on my friends laptop because on settings 6-7 at 1080p it was absolutely smashing it with over 90fps.. the laptop was in max performance mode and also wasn't a dual core (like yours) so this could explain why.
---
What to do as an (ally) hunter in AV? I trap the road to Belinda, shoot all the enemy archers out of the tower and when we encounter a group of enemies I tab through all the horde and hit viper sting whenever I see a mana bar ever since I found out that mana is everything in a fight.
---
Anything else I should do?
---
This has to be a troll post. Or if it isn't, it's a horde that after 3 months of not having any issues with waiting times is now salty because he's run into an obstacle that comes with an over-populated faction. 
---
Or its the third, his tiny orc brain is so tiny he doesn't understand the concept of not pressing the 'Join Battle' button for 15 minutes, then coming back and getting straight back into AV instantly.
---
This really happened.
---
You kinda contradicted yourself when you admitted not having imp FD caused you do die on over 5% of yours runs. Definitely spec imp FD
---
No, he's just lying about one thing or another. Probably about both.
---
It’s been around forever in the pvp community. I’ve used it for years but they eventually updated their client breaking it entirely, nobody has ever been banned from it I can assure you, it is against TOS but they have no way of tracking it as it does not alter your actual game files.
---
My guess is as it becomes more popular it will be patched like it was in retail, as of now not many people know it’s working for Classic.
---
He asked for laptops

Hahahahhahaahhahahahahhahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahhahahahahahahaahhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
Enjoying horde, buddy?
---
*laughs in Alliance*
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahhahhhahahahahhahahahahahh
---
That is not true
---
Yeah thats my guild..most barely log only just for raids have to pug some ppl usually despite many recruits.Wonder do they have BWL plans set,MCs are 2h atm.But really great bunch of guys and its fun hopefully guild can survive through so many raids that will be added
---
AB isn't going to change anything if AV stays in its current state. It's better than WSG if you consistently 5 cap, but not by a whole lot. And it is more flexible composition-wise.
---
Epics bring out the best in human being ;-)
---
Well... I totally agree that there's worse thing in life: if I must decide between going to Rio and work for a drug cartel to get money to smoke crack every night or farm AV for 3 months, you'll see me swimming in AV lake.
---
But it's not because there's thing more stupid things in life that it makes this experience less stupid.
---
Like I wrote to somebody else: I've played videogames all my life and I'm not saying that it's a waste of time or a bad hobby but there's limit: if all the category below are checked:
---
* When the amount of time required is unhealthy 
---
* When the task you must do is brainless
---
* When the task is done in 'toxic' context 
---
* When the reward is guilty pleasure at best
---
Then I think it's fair to say that it's just stupid and worthless and since I'm persuaded that the current honor grind in classic check everything...
---
Where do you get the rare BoEs from? You only kill 4 mobs... And yeah good luck selling that 0.4% drop chance axe to anybody.. You might get 200g tops for it
---
I see it like I can grind a couple of hours on my own time, when it fits my schedule with wife, kids, work, house, pets etc. This can usually be done in small increments at a time between doing other things. When we are raiding however, we only have a single 8-9 minute break during the raid, and focus is usually required during the remainder of the raid. We usually clear it in 1-2 hours depending on turnups. Seeing as it isn't always easy to get many several consecutive hours free to play without feeling I'm neglecting my other duties, I value cutting down the time where I need to be focused and uninterrupted (mostly).
---
Cutting down the raid-time from 3 to 1½ hours therefore means I get a lot more freedom in doing what I want.
---
I did Just a Bit less dmg than the 2 rokdelar/ t1 equiped Hunter i dont know If they are Just Bad with good equip or im just better with my Blue prebis Not all purple ist good purple ;)
---
Just out of curiosity, where could one get a bot to queue and AFK in Warsong? ;)
---
DING
---
solo Tribute runs are easy to learn? have you done one?
---
Epona
---
Sorry if my post made the wrong impression.
---
As I said I am actually quite fine with the level of difficulty. I was fully aware what to expect and if I would like to have mythic raids or something like that I know where to go (retail? no thank you)
---
People wanted to play on 1.12, this is 1.12 AV
---
Don't see how you can clamor no change if you want specific content from different patches
---
I joined an alt/pug run a couple days ago and Golemagg resisted 11 out of my 58 Frostbolt casts. 1% hit from gear, 6% from talents. Another Mage had 16 resists out of 56 Frostbolts.
---
Baron had three Mages get &gt;15% of their Frostbolts resisted (29/38 hits, 36/46 hits, 42/50 hits) and Shazzrah had two Mages get &gt;15% of their Frostbolts resisted (14/19 hits and 20/26 hits). In all the boss fights all other Mages had &lt;15% resists.
---
&gt; Damage numbers are the same as on other fights though, so I doubt there are any resistances involved.
---
Could be bad luck, but it could very well be higher resistances too. In other fights Mages have to decurse, switch targets, move, etc., so that means lower damage done. In the Baron and Golemagg fights they just stand there and cast freely, so those bosses might have higher resistances to balance that out.
---
Everything is 100% blizzards fault, they made wow and therefore this whole shitshow is all their fault and I hate them for it goddamnit fmlllll
---
Srsly though, quit whining and try to enjoy the game :)
---
Merry Christmas!
---
They should reward more for taking towers. Atm people wanna rush a win or loose fast. Rewarding more for towers could lead to more interesting games.
---
Szreakfast?
---
If you gave your MT bindings and he isn't almost finished with the mat grind, you gave bindings to the wrong guy.
---
It is not the same thing. There are two sources of resists: misses due to level difference and resists due to the resistance stat of the target. 
---
Casts have a 17% base miss chance against bosses. This is what decreases with +spell hit gear, down to a minimum of 1% (which is why the hit cap is 16%).
---
Resists due to resistances are different. They can either be full resists or partial resists. A resist due to resistance will hit for either 0%, 25%, 50% or 75% damage.
---
Reducing mob resistance will decrease the amount of resists of the second kind, but can't do anything about resists of the first kind, while getting +Spell hit will decrease the amount of resists of the first kind, but can't do anything about resists of the second kind.
---
In the situation you described I'd let the player who brought his healer in roll for shit. If a healer was needed so badly that you had to ask a dps to switch off then no loot was gonna drop if he didn't do it and he should get a fair roll.  
---
I hate loot drama so I found a raiding group that isn't fucking stupid and does round-robin rolls with very weak priority considerations. If you're not stalled, you don't need to loot council shit to break past the barrier. Nobody should get stalled past learning mechanics until the end of classic and that's enough time to get everybody everything if you raid weekly. If you are stalled on current content then you have people who are literally putting in no effort and they shouldn't be rolling for anything so it'll act like LC anyways, with the few people actually trying getting gear and then peacing out for a group not filled with dead weight.
---
I suspect you have not played during tbc
---
stop being dumb. the amount of honor you lose on a 15 min break is immensely higher than whatever you can accomplish on wpvp as horde (which is not a lot), even making it relative to your faction. alliance can't stop, ever. horde can.
---
Download Tukui, has the loot UI, kinda same as Elv but more minimalistic
---
Maybe in the first couple of days that was the case. But nobody is hitting rank 14 on my server without being part of the dedicated AV premade group.
---
You will have even more time to shower later.
---
I’ll run this by the boys. Smells like new meta to me.
---
Okay fair enough. I remember a warlock in my guild saying you should have 3% in pvp so I thought pve would probs be about 5% hit. Cant you get that from gear?
---
Well yeah.
---
Practice?
---
That is the goal!
---
Is there something sepcial that u can only fish in AV?=
---
[Yes](https://youtu.be/nhmQhV9IzOk), and they are.
---
Rofl!I heard you need 25hks a week to count btw .He didn't know that??
---
The 9 minute wins are 1 in a 10 now if you 're lucky to end in an ally premade. 9 out of 10 times ally pug's lose in 15-25m because they stop doing anything resembling strategy the moment their rush is stopped. You are so lucky. I hate the fact I missed the opening weekend. Only got to revered in 1.5 day but now it's 200 rep per (losing) match tops, so it will take 2 more weeks of grinding losses for exalted.
---
That's 900 IQ
---
As others asked....PLEASE give the address :D
---
Long time ago i read something about weapon speed and when you should clip your Autoshots with an Aimed.
---
Also, at what point is it worth it to spec into Lightning Reflexes(+15% agility)
---
Anyone got some info about that?
---
I tried it last night!! WORKS WONDERS!!!
---
Hi, thanks for your reply. So I jumped in the game and played on Classic for few hours to not so good result- it was choppy and low frame rate. Than I played with settings and managed to get a decent smooth gameplay. BUT I decided to give retail a try and I was shocked how smooth and good looking everything was- no frame rate drops or lag or anything- I am extremely surprised!
---
The main thing tho was to setup fam control properly and now there is no overheating and it really is a pleasure to play.
---
I challenge you to do a 25 min MC, after all it's not challenging
---
To be honest i think some guils will have more problems with supression room and the engineer adds than with most bosses beside dog and nef, but it should be easy enough because in wow classic everyone and their brothers are running on min/max bis gear.
---
Raid content will only ramp up in difficulty in aq40 then naxx and even then it will be more about being ready with consumables than with tactics (theres a ton of guides and most people have been atleast in aq40 before).
---
Care to elaborate on organizing and optimizing groups?
---
Erm the rush mentality was 100% figured out and occurring almost every game in the nerfed av in vanilla.
---
2-3% on gear is max for casters at this point of the game
---
Me too. I double click w fishing buddy - put the cursor on. Wait. Listen. Click when hearing the sound.
---
Autoloot
---
I have found a few  i like
---
farming the winterspring furbolgs at night is really nice gold/hour, key here is to have a max of 1 other person in the village with you. 
---
Arathi highlands/ungoro crater/possibly searing gorge are all decent spots as well for elemental fire farming, somewhat rng reliant but it's nice when you have the spot for yourself 
---
Dm east runs are pretty darn good once you and your healer partner learn to do them without wipes, they are shitshow until then in my experience but even when you wipe a lot its good gold. 3mans are ok if you are not yet good enough for 2man 
---
2maning the demons in the south part of winterspring also very nice but pretty rng, also loads of thorium veins here.
---
wtf is that time format.
---
Press Start to Paws!
---
Firstly, this is a collective effort, not a solo mat grind, or you're in the wrong guild. Secondly, people don't decide when the bindings drop, some guilds already have them, some don't. Some will drop them a few days or weeks prior to the release, some people will drop them after release. There will always be high demand and high prices for those mats because of that.
---
Nice run. Easy relative to what other part of the game though? It's way more mechanically demanding than any other thing you can do on a hunter at present.. I just think it's misleading to say it's easy when I personally don't think the majority of the hunter player base could pull these off
---
That’s not what anyone said.  They said it was blizzards bug, and it is. Blizz broke some api functionality that calculated these numbers before and ui addon developers just used blizz numbers.  Since they broke their functionality, addon devs have found a workaround to calculate the number themselves.
---
It’s still a blizz bug that caused the problem - it is broke in the default ui with no addons installed.  No one said it wasn’t something that could be worked around though, and luckily it was.
---
You need 4% for PvP, and even then 1% of all spells will always resist. With currently available gear you're able to get 3% as a warlock, if I'm not forgetting anything. Star of mystaria, T1 chest and the belt from BRD arena.
---
Dude i think u have to visit a threapist ur mind seems to be kind of fucked up haha
---
Size of brackets is dependent on number of players who have more than 15 HK's in the week. Basically depends on size of the server and amount of active pvpers. Not based on the amount of honor.     
---
If the top bracket is sized for 10 players on your server, it will always have 10 players no matter the honor disparity among them. People who are in the top bracket always get between 12-13k ranking points. The person with standing 1 should be getting 13k, the others are getting accordingly less. The person who is lowest standing in the top bracket (=least honor) is slightly above 12k ranking points. But it's still the top bracket.
---
yes
---
No, you seem to be as it's the only thing you are able to repeat on here.
---
Amazing drama. I fucking live for this shit.
---
how would farming 40 opposite players with diminishing returns for 12 hours straight fix ranking for everyone. people would complain that it's impossible to spend that much time doing one battleground in 2019 and the honor grinders would go somewhere else, both leading to longer queues.
---
As far as I know, it highly favors horde in todays meta. Why do you think alliance non premades have 10% winrate, while alliance premades still cant get even close to 90% winrate vs horde non-premades (Which should be easy with 30+ premades, but nope)?  
---
You think players who chose horde are just better? So again, if anything, the map favors horde, strongly.
---
Man I've been playing for about 2 1/2 months and I'm still only level 52. Never mind getting my hands on some of the best gear the game has to offer.
---
I'm leveling a bear tank, and to be honest, killing things in Bear form is only slightly slower than cat, and cat I'm normally at half health at the end, where as Bear I can fight 2-3 mobs easily. 
---
So I went full bear build, and only use cat if I am killing 1 caster mob.
---
There is some sample bias in how you calculated the honor/min for win and loss.
---
Still you are probably right that it is better to win than lose.  That shouldn't be a surprise.  The issue you neglected is it's about the same to win a long match than lose a short one, but it is much easier to lose a short one than win a long one.  The extra effort makes it undesirable.  But at the very least it is good news that winning a long match is better than losing a short one (but I thought this was already known).
---
Sweet justice. Fuck bigots.
---
I find being a mage really nice in BGs. With ice block, ice barrier frost nova, blink and improved blizzard x 2 with cold snap. You can disrupt so much. Even more so with improved counterspell.
---
You can completely stop a group in its tracks. And sometimes even kill an entire group and more alone. I wiped an 11 player group killing balinda alone. They were crap, obviously. But what other class can do that?
---
Improved counterspell alone is so strong. Another pesky mage blinks in to shatter combo your group while killing warmasters, shut him down and hes dead before the silence ends. Same with priests trying fear. Any spellcaster just gets crippled completely.
---
you can’t really expect guild members of 10 people to farm every pre bis item for every new guild recruit that comes along
---
No its not because its parch 1.12
---
Also the guy I was responding to wanted to change the ranked system which is a cruciam part from vanilla anyways.
---
The shimmering flats of course. Y‘all are taking too many drugs
---
It is indeed higher, but if you're taking ranking seriously on horde, you can't really have a break either. A huge part of your honor comes from HKs anyways on horde, be it in or outside AV.
---
It's worthless for *you*. 
---
Many a person comes back to classic to check some boxes on shit, they've wanted to do in vanilla, but didnt have the chance accomplishing.
---
 I only did ZG up to the boss Venoxis and Onyxia both once. 
---
I've played on pservers and wanted a BRE for the past 4 years in which I played such pservers on and off.
---
First box for me personally is checked as I acquired this fine weapon.
---
Others harbored the desire for 14years to finally be able get the rank done and to only do it once and never again.
---
Surely, you have guilty pleasures in other aspects of your life which you still want to check.
---
I'm just slightly annoyed at your high and mighty tone looking down on people doing the grind. It's fine if it's not for you. In fact I've dialed down my ingame time massively already, because I lost fun doing braindead raids as the last 20% of classic actually take skill. The rest is a pointless point and click adventure in comparison to the mechanical finesse that is required to accomplish stuff in todays gaming such as Apex, raids and mythic+ dungeons.
---
Playing vanilla WoW and then telling people, they are doing a brainless grind is pretty rich.
---
You're evidently clueless on this subject, so why talk?
---
It's already tried and tested. It worked great on Nost, and that was a single realm. With cross-realm queues will be an absolute non issue.
---
If you would have missed 100% of your bolts it would still not indicate anything of value. 21 Casts is simply not enough for statistical analysis. That's like rolling dice 21 times and wondering how you got six 5 times in a row. It happens.
---
I got a few, old and new!
---
I'll start with the new. Not my guild but I heard about this. One guild had a raid (this is like a few days ago, fresh out the oven drama) that was utterly chaotic. They cleared MC eventually but took ages and wiped on bosses they should have on farm, even wiped on trash. The RL/GM spent most of the raid either goofing off on VC or shouting at the MT and Healing Leader. People didn't even know who the RL was because the GM wasn't doing the job, the MT was trying to do it but doing it terribly, and other random people were starting to make their own calls. The MT muted the RL/GM and kept doing shit pulls that caused wipes. GM, Heal Leader, and MT had a huge shouting match in the raid VC. The GM demoted the other two from officer, and the heal leader quit the guild. 
---
Other drama was from Vanilla day. I was in a pretty big guild that was trying to get an MC group running. The guild GM, being GM, took the role of Raid Lead. He was *awful* at it. Obvious lack of understanding or research on any MC trash or bosses. Didn't make calls anywhere near on time. Would get flustered if anything went slightly wrong and would start randomly demanding people do things that just made it all worse.
---
He wouldn't step down and wouldn't let anyone else do any sort of call-making. The "good" raiders eventually mass gquit and made their own raiding guild, which eventually did end up in Naxx. I jumped ship to an RL friend's guild which was running MC at the time, which also eventually fell apart over drama when we got stuck on Rag for too long. The guild they all quit limped on for a while trying to rebuild an MC team under the same GM and eventually just fell into inactivity as anyone that was good at raiding inevitably got sick of the shit raids and found better guilds.
---
Most of your alliance comrades moved to Earthshaker for PvP.
---
You really think your peers shower or clean up things?
---
As much as you can get without dropping the hit cap.
---
&gt;It's a thing since there is WoW, no clue what Blizzard's stance on it is atm though.
---
you risk a ban for that.  
---
It's unlikely to be banned unless you gain some in game advantages, but it can happen
---
&gt; Winning a long match yields at least the same amount of honor per minute as quickly losing. Winning a long match yields on average twice as much reputation per minute as losing. 
---
Your data doesn't show this at all, because you're not comparing quickly lost games with average won games. Instead you are comparing average vs. average and it just turns out that for horde a win takes longer than a loss. Or in other words, horde is more likely to win long games.
---
If your intent is to compare winning vs. quickly losing you should compare your average honor, rep and length vs. the strategy of giving alliance the win and meanwhile getting as much honor as possible. You even have some those games in your data.
---
According to your data (which is without turn ins I guess?): Your 8 quickly max. 10 min. lost games average 2.351 honor and 244 rep with a length of 9,38 minutes. 
---
That results in 250,63 honor/min and 26 rep/min without queues.
---
Or 146,94 honor/min and 15,25 rep/min with queues (average 6,62 for those games). 
---
That said, quickly losing actually gives you A LOT more honor/min even factoring in the average queues atm. You lose out on reputation though.
---
Yes, you want a slow weapon so that you can get off 2 auto shots between your aimed shots. If you have the BRD quiver your attack speed could be as slow as 3.5s, however I’m not sure there are weapons that slow, the x-bow from Strat has a 3.3 sec attack speed I believe which is good. 
---
It’s also preferably to have a slower one and get off 2 autos rather than 3 with a faster weapon because your Aimed Shot and Multi Shot will do more damage with a slower weapon because of weapon damage. 
---
As far as I know Lightning Reflexes is almost never worth it, especially if you’re raiding and what not, since you’ll miss out on the Trueshot Aura.
---
Here are the blizzlike resistances/immunities of raid boss mobs:
---

---
Gehennas: 186 fire resist, 93 shadow resist
---
Baron Geddon: fire immune
---
Shazzrah: 186 arcane resist, 93 fire resist

Majordomo Exectus: 95 fire resist
---
Ragnaros: fire immune

Nefarian: fire immune
---
Viscidus: nature immune
---
Sapphiron: frost immune
---
Kelthuzad: 200 frost resist, 100 shadow resist
---
Silithus. Barely any quests but it's in the correct level range.
---
to be fair, it does this in pve also (raid gear vs small group content gear)
---
On launch, I couldn't even get to the flight master in Org before my queue popped. You're wrong dawg.
---
I see the SpaceX from mass effect :o
---
Wrong wrong and wrong
---
Loot councils came to be to allow raid groups to funnel loot to the right players to allow them to break past walls and clear content. Classic guilds who easily cleared MC will easily clear BWL and don't need to funnel loot to the right players to break down walls because there are none. By the time these guilds need to have all their shit decked out in Naxx it will have already happened if they just do random rolls and raid every week. It isn't needed and it isn't fair to all who take part without afk'ing or showing up in greens and autoattaking.
---
&gt; sometines ill only get ~100 honor even though nobody else is near. 
---
This is what gets me the most.  I've killed plenty of people rank 6, 7, 8 or higher, completely solo, from their 100% health to them dead, and gotten a pittance of honor.  These kills would be worth at least 200 in the open world.
---
Bless you
---
I saw this group yesterday in my AV. Easiest 600 honor ive ever gotten.
---
The most braindead of all the expansions.
---
.. Them fixing AV would fix the problem you describe. Not sure what to tell you.
---
&gt; Classic is simply pre-TBC
---
pre-TBC had honor as currency. They should just do that :)
---
I joined a guild that claimed to be semi casual, then they all no lifed to 60 and demanded everyone respec engy to make raiding easier, get world buff for every mc but laughed in gchat at people who flasked for their alt raids. 
---
I was a bit slow to 60, got to 60 got some bis and asked if i could come to ony when there was only 30 online, already got my t2 helm in a pug run so didn't want any gear gm ignored me so i just noped out at that point.
---
Joined a genuine casual guild but will prob give it away when my 3 months runs out.
---
Twink v twink BGs are a lot of fun. It’s like endgame where everyone has a smaller tool kit. Imo as you move up in levels there are fewer twinks but I haven’t done any other brackets above 19
---
Oh this screenshot again. 
---
Well atleast this tim the name was removed :3
---
not only that, but the premise of his statement was that they are playing the same thing over and over....
---
On a classic wow forum....
---
I don't particularly like the format. Mostly due to me not getting gear while others seem favored. 
---
I would rather roll for the gear. But I do like my guild.
---
How does one counter a mage? I know it's a poor matchup but honestly it feels terrible. Also I can't seem to block frost nova with ice reflector. Do I just save it for a frostbolt? 
---
The mage tactic seems to be frost nova into cone of cold and spam arcane explosion, if I trinket, they just blink and continue deadzoning me. Viper sting is usually used once and I do have improved wind clip, but they seem to remove/it doesn't proc in time. I've also tried scatter or freezing trap but they ice block out of it and continue running at me. At least with warlocks, I can reflect the fear and win sometimes, but mages give me an awful time unless they're sitting there trying to cast spells with my brokentooth on them.
---
&gt; If you want the real classic AV, you also ask for the exploit of leaving the raid group and sniping each kill to get 100% honor for your self while others did all the work.
---
Can people still do that?
---
Thats the way i farmed it
---
Wait, so you're a tauren, the most peaceful race in the game pretty much, son of the most peaceful orc in the game, and you have the mindset of a Warhammer Ork?
---
&gt;Or just... play it on a different day
---
It's pretty normal that people tunnel vision the boss when he's at low health.
---
Any1 know if this Discord exists for EU? I've been looking for one (I'm on Firemaw EU) but can't find.
---
I kind of like that it's AV because you don't need anyone else and don't get Honor mafia forming to dictate who gets r14 and when.
---
Illidan
---
Are you on sulfuras ?
---
I think if you que in uc you can go western and kill 3-5 people on avarage
---
I don't get it? Is it because casuals can farm honor without a premade?
---
youre a fucking clown LMAO

Holy shit that's awesome.
---
Transfer to Zandalar Tribe. Good balanced healthy server.
---
Diversify your portfolio aka. Invest in several things. In general investing is good because the value of raw goes down while consumables and commodities values will go up. However, if you put all your gold in lets say black lotus (because it is super hot right now) and try to dump it right before or during the release off bwl there is a 50-50 you will have a bad time. There are a lot of people thinking the same thing and it might completely trash that market. 
---
While things like  elixir of spellpower, moongoose, restorative potions, black label rum and more is boring, there will always be a high volume of it traded and it's known that the demand will go up, but not by much given how easy this market can regulate the supply bt itself. I would at lest put part of your portfolio in this.
---
Where did you get them
---
I saw someone queue in thunder bluff and go maraudon, use hs on cooldown
---
Queue altarac Mountain and run up to plaguelands to get larvic acid or fly from uc
---
I dunno what is more efficient, i saw some streamers go maraudon but its abit of a meme. Guess you should be able to do tinkerer/princess
---
The benefit to lootcouncil don't really exist in classic since content is already piss easy.
---
We had a rogue ninja bindings on my server lol. I actually didn’t know about it and became friends w the guy and my guild flipped when they found out.. then every time I went to If I noticed in trade chat ..  everyone was furious . I think there WAS warriors tho,.. anyway It sounded similar enough lol
---
clever.
---
If you have a lot of guild members you can build another raid group out of setting up 5 man groups for getting fresh 60s preraid BiS and building from there. Don't use alts or poach from the main group and you should be okay. If you don't have many members, you can always remain in your guild and still raid with another group, there are guilds out there who have to fill slots every week that may do rolls on gear. May have to work to find a good one.
---
Oceanic. They really fucked us over by separating us from NA
---
Big angry chicken with sunglasses
---
That's true, it's more the pvp side of things I suppose where it comes in handy.
---
I don't think you can avoid ALL the warmasters, I think you have to kill 1 or 2 (or offtank them if you wanna go fast)
---
Thanks for you reply King! 
---
Now, due to your amazing i am have to learned english!
---
Why? Warriors in Warcraft 3:
---
Dwarf: Mountain King
---
Orc: Blade Master / Grunts
---
Night Elf: Demon Hunter
---
Tauren: Tauren Chieftan / Taurens 
---
Human: Footman / Knights
---
All these are more or less passable for a warrior potential. And in Warcraft 3 there size was also proportional to their strength (minus the MK who is the strongest, but even that is like the archetypal LOTR dwarf, king of the mountain that it works).
---
But a gnome? Gnome would be perfect for a tinker type character, or like the Alchemist as well, whose strength is through either a machine or a controlled stronger ogre-body. It just does not make sense to have a 50 lb, magic-less gnome. An average adult male could punt one 15 ft.
---
Now I am cool with the cartoony style the WoW uses and how they abandoned a lot of continuity—its part of what makes the game work the way it does. However, I am just pointing out that it is a bit absurd for people to say that they don't understand why people think gnomes are dumb. It is a perfectly reasonable thing to think.
---
My old guild kicked out the MT after his gf left the guild, he had both bindings.
---
Stop trying to rank and actually go pvp something?   Solved.
---
it's a picture of the screen taken with a camera
---
too bad this av was included in vanilla and was what patch 1.12 had. you wanted patch 1.12, you got it
---
Oh, it's patch 1.12? 
---
Why isn't the honor system changed then?
---
Why is there no Naxx or AQ? Where's my fucking BWL and nexus crystals?
---
Anyone got any tips for recruiting more players to our guild? We have a core raid team of about 25, which sometimes makes it difficult if a few people can’t make a raid.
---
Yeah, and that's really stupid ;)
---
well, you all wanted no changes to vanilla so this is what you get.
---
I am doing PUG this week and next since my guild is on break the rest of the year. So I might try out rolling with other guilds.
---
Trying to farm world drop is a bit lackluster, you still talking about a 0.02 chance to drop.
---
Lol, sounds like you're quite clearly bad, and will never have a chance at any decent rank.
---
You should easily manage 700-1000 honor every time you queue. That's 180k-200k honor you're falling behind every week. No chance at a good rank.
---
Why would you stay in a guild which obviously doesn't respect you?
---
I was expecting like an entry with an Invis potion then PoM Flamestrike, a Sapper, Mortar, etc, but nope. Just ran in with a double CoC and spammed AE without being targeted lol; they deserved that one.
---
Yup. This is the general course of game atm. Alliance will get a win if it’s a race so horde must send a defend team. If the Alliance raid wipes, the horde has so much control on the map that Allince has hard time coordinating what to do. If they defend, it most probably just prolongs the loss, if they rush and attack again they will loose the race this time.   
---
It’s not really about “what strategy is the best” it’s really about which side can have the most players execute the same strategy successfully.  
---
An Alliance premade used exactly this chaos to score an easy win on Horde. They seemed to rush but instead turned the train back and wiped us at Balinda and left a squad to deal with the respawns. This caused the Horde to be very confused as half the players were going north, half south and the rest were trying to get out of graveyard and figure out what to do. The match was very short.
---
World record is 25 minutes, check YouTube ;)
---
To be fair its really hard to push 4-5 people out of the tower once they got it, even with 7-8 people.
---
That was what it did back in MoP, I raised as The Lich King even Kil’Jaden
---
Is it enough for you to stop paying them money?
---
Yes, *raid on a different day*.  Shocking I know to suggest that if Wednesday is laggy as fuck, perhaps raid on a different day.
---
Please try to keep up.
---
I don't think the devs are the ones calling the shots on what gets made and what gets pushed and funded.
---
I as a horde , i hope we get 2 hours queue , already the instant queue for alliance gives them the chance to create premades . I play casual , on a PVE server , and when i flagged myself for some pvp , i've never experienced any of this . So yes i really hope we get to 2 hours ! We deserve it !
---
Love this!!
---
Could someone list typical time to complete dungeons? I'm interested in the high-level ones -- UBRS, LBRS, Scholo, Strat (both), and ST. Also BRD, but maybe that doesn't make sense without breaking it down into different runs, and that's a lot to ask. Ideally, it would be awesome to have best-case scenario times and more average times. But that's a lot to ask too. Thanks in advance!
---
I saw 3 rogue bots in Hinterlands a few weeks back. Weird how they're all Rogues.
---
Absolutely disgusting little rat, makes me sick
---
 If only I could be so grossly incandescent
---
That's my experience playing horde.
---
Hmm well I do play mainly in the mornings. Maybe that’s why my numbers are so largely different.
---
12 people is an entire AV zerg?
---
If it can't find the checkpoints to run back to the farming spot (if you kited the bot several zones). It will HS then fly and/or run back to it's farming spot again.
---
Leading my first raid in MC next week, I know the mechanics and paths through and I'm not going to be handling loot.
---
Would appreciate any tips from the veterans around :)
---
Are you being intentionally stupid
---
Rogues are a class that's likely selling well because they take so long to level.
---
Strange that you say that, I'm using this opener as this what I have read on the weekly warrior thread on this sub and after googling around.
---
I think that T-clap is a bad AOE threat generator, its also what seems to be the consensus in the warrior community. 
---
That's a great post you linked, no idea how i didn't stumbled across it beforehand.
---
Thanks.
---
I find it ironic that the best tanking tips I found was on the hunter weekly threat and not on the warrior's...
---
why do I get the impression that as well as being bad at WoW, you suck at hockey too.
---
oh baby....tree form!
---
I miss BC sometimes.
---
I think I know where this is from 👍
---
Probably sell well but wouldn't be from slow levelling. Might just be my experience playing them but I find them easy to level. Being able to negate damage via CC, Gouge &amp; bandage etc.
---
It's probably for later on when everyone wants a max level Rogue to gank on.
---
you GET to play more AV? Like that’s a privilege?  It’s more like you’re forced to play for AV, but you have Stockholm syndrome because you rolled alliance
---
The Pummeler has 3 uses for it's effect. You need to farm them for the weapon to be useful. [It has 3 charges](https://www.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler)
---
Stfu noob
---
You can not blame players for using low effort, high reward tactics. If those tactics exist, it makes sense for players to use them. The only way to stop people using them is to change the system.
---
You would be ducking surprised how bad the average player is. 
---
Example: 
---
- For fury warriors Bloodthirst is "the prime ability" and the damage from the ability is just amazing and should be used every cooldown. It is a 6sec cooldown, so the theoretical maximum is 10 casts per minute. Still at 50% (blue) parses you can have 5 cast per minute... This ducking baffels me that half the warriors on mc can't press a button every 6 seconds.
---
- The tank has to work against 12% parry and 6,5% block by the booses so getting to 5 sunder stacks takes 6-9 globals (8-15 seconds). The debuff is absolutely massive. If other warriors are not useing sunder armor on their first glabal to get it up immediately the whole raid looses a ton of dps. 
---
---&gt; This results in huuge  differences in dps of warrior, with good ones doing 450+ dps without any world buffs, and bad ones closer to 250 dps... That's nearly double damage from just doing two extremely gay things Right vs. Wrong.
---
No, we do not have paid lunches in Sweden.
---
Who cares lmao
---
but the point still stands, your method could be done by every other class just as good or better.
---
Barbarous blade is BiS till Lok’dhelar and is even better than Lok for shorter dps encounters.
---
Yah pvp is not an option with limited time sadly.
---
It's useless to check now, in a month we'll have phase 3 and prices can change dramatically.
---
Prices will be completely different in a month tho
---
I honestly think bwl is going to catch A LOT of guilds off guard just like phase 2 did. Bwl is much harder than MC (I will agree to disagree with what looks like most comments here). I would say, every fight in bwl is harder than every fight in game so far. The first fight is a coordination check, the second fight is a gear check. If you’re guild is undergeared or uncoordinated, you are going to have a hard stop at the beginning of the dungeon. MC let’s you farm quite a bit of great loot before you actually get challenged in fights. Bwl is MUCH less forgiving.
---
Time will tell, but I seriously expect a lot of folks to be surprised, similar to how phase 2 changed the game dynamic much more than a lot of people expected. I for one am super excited, bwl might be my favorite raid in WoW. I think it has the best challenge-to-reward ratio of any raid.
---
The T1 chest is decent. I wear it because I don't have tailoring and take every bit of hit I can get my hands on.
---
Legs are also good just poor compared to the t2 ones.
---
Overall the felheart set just seems like it was designed for PvP.
---
Same with the nemesis one.
---
Exactly what I was thinking, don't throw stones in glass houses
---
My head hurts
---
reasonable?
---
not a single t1 piece is good for pve.
---
i have full t1 and don't wear a single one in raids.
---
In my experience the only class that's slower than a rogue to level is a warrior. Mostly because they have a down time between fights that adds up. You're right that it's a popular PVP class though.
---
you had your phase 2 fun, now it's our time. Muhaha
---
Exo raid tools helps with invites/tracking roster and raid CDs. Great for when you het into any bad situations. 
---
Raid Buff Status - helps track who is missing what buffs and what mana% your DPS and Healers are at. I use this to keep chain pulling and get done faster. (75/50% healer mana is about the threshold for me to pull in my group. Anything lower  than 30% will results in a quick break to drink and then pull some more.
---
Bracers are BIS, outright better than every other option.
---
Chest is a solid option, though 1% hit over a single fight is worse than robe of the void/winter night.
---
Legs are solid but t2 are obviously an upgrade.
---
LOL, then why in the hell do you want to know the prices in a month? It changes weekly.
---
I'd be worrying about why you can't play for a month than have this posted onto Reddit. I mean common sense man.
---
Nobody is forcing you to rank.
---
On my previous server [Hide of the Wild] was 300g avarage, on my current server its around 240g. Prices are different on dif servers, depending on demand and mats costs.
---
Since u play in 1 month, the prices will change 1 month from now depending on new releases.. so i dont rly dee the point of asking for current prices
---
op is the kind of exceptional individual that undercuts by 50% when shit is selling for the full price as quickly.
---
I dnt have a weapon spec tho lol
---
Not had too much drama. We did have one guy rage quit after not getting some feral bracers. He kept jumping between Feral and Resto not making his mind up, although being well geared wanted those specifically. Rather than making up his mind what he wanted to play he had a hissy fit called everyone shit and quit. 
---
Our guild is in the top 40 I think, with 38min MC as our current record. Apparently we are all terrible though and all the healers suck which is why he has to do all the healing.
---
PvP shoulders and pants are BiS now. BDS is old news man
---
Discord
---
&gt; You can easily find 1-2 hour AVs which is sufficient to have the same AV experience with quests and bosses.
---
What? I'm close to exalted and I've never even breached the 1 hour mark. I think around 40 minutes is the absolute most I've had. And I say that as someone who almost always defends, because I enjoy the longer games and actual combat.
---
I've never seen the cavalry, and I've never seen the infantry. I've seen Lok'holar twice and Ivus once, with one of the two Lok'holar games ending within a minute afterwards. I've seen wing commanders in the air a single digit number of times. I've seen champion guards once.
---
How, pray tell, can I easily find 1-2 hour AV games? And even if I do, I would be very shocked if I ever see cavalry or infantry again. Regardless of game length, nobody does that anymore, ever.
---
I updated my post. So I'm mostly griping at the inconsistency. 1 in 6k chance is not a great set of odds, but at the same time its not like i can afford to buy it on AH, people who do get them put them up for crazy prices in the 800 to 1100G range... Merely trying to find if anyone knows which wiki is more trustworthy if any are really.
---
I levelled a Mage prior to Rogue, other than AoE farming (which wasn't possible due to the amount of other Mages also AoE farming, and opposite faction ganking the Mages farming), the amount of time you spent drinking was absurd when questing normally (&amp; throwing in group pulls where possible as it cost basically the same mana). It was a damn sight slower than Rogue.
---
Yes, but not for you
---
Exactly. I suggest people do just that.
---
DME with a paladin/shaman preferably, but priest or druid can work too. Make sure you have mining and enchanting and preferably also herbalism. 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIf2wiKTSow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIf2wiKTSow)
---
I second that.
---
I have serious doubts a game developer has his blood and sweat and tears in putting the next brainless feature, soulless content (which nobody will take a look at 6 months after) or 100th real money mount into the game which doesnt give the player any feeling of accomplishment.
---
Free action potion
---
Bestial Wrath+Intimidation, or Scatter+Aimed shot to force Ice block. Gain distance while mage is on Iceblock. Apply Serpent Sting, dont bother with Viper Sting because draining the whole mana pool takes longer than killing him
---
Use Goblin Rocket Helm/Iron Grenades if you get deadzoned again, and gain distance
---
Use Goblin Rocket boots to gain distance, dont use cheetah
---
Basically, be engineer or get rekt
---
I see that you’re a warlock so the biggest contribution you can make is ensuring banishes on Garr and the trash(the trash after Garr is the most dangerous part of MC) are maintained and applied again immediately if they break. Make sure you have a way of tracking debuff durations and keep your eye out for early banish breaks.
---
The funnest.
---
Zenocide here. Dude added me in game to called me the n word after I killed him in IF. Then got banned in HS discord for the same reason.
---
Because wow classic is trying to mimic the release schedule from back in Vanilla, so just like back then they'll be added in the next phase.
---
:(
---
Started a guild with everybody I ever met (Friends, Family, Colleagues, Co-workers, Game Buddies). Had like 120 people at launch.
---
Once we got to 60 we had around 20-25~ lvl 60's. Couldn't raid, had to pug, some people quit, so we merged with another guild. 
---
Obviously the other guild was full of shitheads, so we went back to the original guild. From there we created a new guild with some people we met ingame. 
---
Still didn't have enough people to raid with so that new guild also split up. Now I joined another established guild with my core friends, hoping this goes steady..
---
Really depends on your group and if your doing quests and your healer tank combo. 
---
UNRS with 10 I avg a full clear in 35min / Ren runs in 10-15min. 
---
LBRS full clear ~1hr due to all the travel
---
ST ~1hr for full quests and full clear/ top clear ~30min
---
BRD Front ~1Hr (all bosses till guzzler) / back half ~1hr
---
    Full everything dead and quests ~2hr (this is every boss) // Just Winsor escort ~20min // all of winsor quests ~35min). Lava jump emp farm ~15min
---
Scholo ~50-55min
---
Strat UD ~45-50min //Strat Live ~40-50min
---
DM:tribute ~20min
---
DM:N ~25-30min based on what we kill
---
DM:jump ~15min to 30min (5man vs 3man)
---
DM:W ~35-40min if we do key for someone or just bosses. 
---
The above is based on no afks and folks in above avg (not full BiS but some items) and group comp. 
---
Comp depends on what im doing 
---
Warrior tank (me) / pali healer /mage/rogue/lock is what I try to run most of the time. Rogue is changed out for hunter sometimes. I normally dont bring other warriors as they tend to die from being a little quick to jump the gun on large packs. I use oil of immolation and have the first mob die before AoE and tend to pull 2 packs for most dungeons other than Scholo or Strat
---
Again, cant stress enough this is mostly guild folks or friend list dps that know my pull style and TPS generation.  I would add 10-15min for some pugs and 20min for full pugs as I dont always get the best quality folks. 
---
Prot pali (me) / Priest/mage/dps/dps
---
Mage is mostly for water cuz my pali has a drinking problem. I tend to pull 2-3 packs of lower mobs and try to keep mana bar about 50% to keep going. I downrank consecrate to save on mana unless my dps is super geared then to OOMTown I go....
---
Yeah a rogue that can crush your rogue
---
Sorry I didn’t realise 31 was greater than 2019, I’m not sure where you’re getting this logic from but it’s generally accepted around my parts at least that people know what month it is
---
Def classic. Cooming is a relatively recent meme
---
Hey, if you make alliance stop queuing AV (you said they don't want to, right?) and queue WSG instead, Horder queues will be so abysmal they will also switch to WSG for honor farm. Good luck.
---
**ALT-Prtscr**
---
How the fuck do you think straight up lying makes your argument look better? 
---
No one wanted 1.12. ever. Not two months ago, not 4 months ago, not 6 months ago. 
---
People wanted a replication of vanilla progression, not this nonsense.
---
Oof haha glad you’re sick. Enjoy the “psychologically weird mental asylum films” you asked reddit for, clown
---
Oh, WSG had gear rewards added after Alterac Valley did? Do you think we will get Arathi Basin + Arathi rewards in the same patch we get WSG rewards?
---
No man, his wording makes it sound insane. More than 30 hours per week is a disgusting amount of time for a working man in general, not mentioning family or social life.
---
Are your attunementa done? Have you done all of your BRD quests?
---
Have you done your HWL quests for MC?
---
I actually did enjoy them, thanks
---
I stopped selling any non-stat (+healing or Ice damage) stuff a few weeks ago. 
---
Items get DE or vendored as most folks on alts farm there own gear or save it for an alt.
---
Oh I’m so glad :)
---
Well, that's not class farm, that's professions farm :)
---
DM:E jumps are nice but indeed only if you can get these crystals.
---
I am alch/eng.
---
How does one break a bot, I want to do it too?
---
Prove it. Should be fairly simple if no one wanted 1.12, you should be able to easily find threads of it somewhere.
---
That's surprising I've found nothing but welcoming on anything wow related. Why are they dicks?
---
Not BoE but still easy to obtain.
---
you mean adis
---
Onslaught girdle, brutality blade and quick strike ring are the big ticket items. 
---
BRE also is a big deal if you want a 2h.
---
It wasn't the guild leader, it was the officers.
---
The guild leader was the best recruiter I ever seen, but the officer team had their share of disagreements on how to manage the guild.
---
After some loot drama, one of the officers left, took the bank (allegedly) and a couple raid members with him.
---
The raid leader and the other officers didn't wanna stick around after that so they formed a new guild.
---
If he doesn't have his special circumstances he is undeniably a no-lifer. If he has the special circumstances and still claims other people are "not optimising" he is an entitled prick.
---
He put himself in such a situation.
---
RP magic, it really add something more to the comunity. Im glad that I choose that realm.
---
Don’t need any eyes of the beast, just send in your pet to attack cho but tell him to run back right before he reaches cho. As long as he bodypulls and not dmg pulls they won’t be linked.
---
I was just kicked today from my guild-no notice, no email not message. Why? Because he said my healing was sub par for raiding. Not removed from a raiding slot to casual. We die too much in MC. Why? Maybe it's because we only bring 4 priests to MC smh.
---
My gear is either BiS or next best and I am trying to get better gear.  Oh the guy who runs the loot council of 1 for my class, has quietly moved me from first in line to off the spreadsheet over the last 5 weeks. This guy is such a douche. It's gonna be hilarious watching them trying to do BWL with only 4 priests (their current plan).
---
I was told they'd bring me back tomorrow-but I may just join the guild I'll be raiding with tomorrow (I have an alt in their guild and they are dying for more healers).
---
Yeah it's a privilege because I like queues to be instant because of my limited time of play.
---
I log on, queue up and instantly join. I don't care about ranks I just want some PvP while getting my discounted epic mount so any ideas about me "losing" honor if I don't chain queue are bogus.
---
A few unlucky wipes on chromaggus and you are stuck until trash respawns. On nost we didn’t have much sand on our first run, all of it went to key roles instead of spreading it across entire raid. Which gave us a few more tries
---
thats actually pretty big offense, ppl grind rep etc just to have different mount look (kodo, raptor etc) and cosmetics are also  big part of any game, this should be bannable
---
&gt;people who do get them put them up for crazy prices in the 800 to 1100G range...
---
What's crazy about it? You've spent two days trying to farm it and couldn't get it, and like you said there was nobody else trying to farm them. You'll find that super rare mats that come from mobs that are not worth your time farming are super expensive, and that's fine.
---
Yeah it does, but hard item to get.
---
Since mounts are items - would /userandom work instead of /castrandom?
---
Onslaught/ wrists of stability/ flame guard gauntlets/ quick strike ring/ band of accuria/ obsidian edge blade/ Bonerevers Edge.
---
How so? I was just explaining him how things are currently. Or are you one of the farmers calling me stupid because I'm exposing top secret stuff that others shouldn't know about or some bullshit like that?
---
Girdle, accuria, brutality blade are the juiciest probably
---
then remove alch because its useless.
---
every single player that is poorly qualified for job market and is lazy af, probably a big kid (given how toxic he is)
---
Is greenshot better than picpick?
---
It really depends on who gets the opener. If a hunter starts attacking me on max range I have a really hard time to deadzone him and have to rely on rocket helmet/ IB.
---
If all cds are up I can beat him, but hunter make mages work hard.
---
The zerg is typically a big group blobbing together. So yeah can be
---
Time your aimed shots so it hits right before cho reaches your pet. You should be able to get in 2 aimed shots plus fillers inbetween each fd. You can also serpent sting right before you fd(just sidestep quick so he can’t charge you). 
---
55 water is also useful so you don’t have to waste time drinking when you could be dpsing.
---
&gt;It feels like an empty Shell compared to classic in terms of population.
---
Well no offence buddy but when you dive right into a game like retail without doing ANY research at all, I feel this is kinda deserved.
---
I have never played retail and I never will because I know its already dead. Plus, it sounds awful.
---
or perhaps... the spice melagne...
---
Yeah most likely AB was released with BWL
---
Ah. Duels mean nothing in a game not balanced around them.
---
My last guild gave our first talisman of ephemeral power to a resto shaman. I left that guild shortly after.
---
Just with totally different talents, and honour system.
---
Alright I like you now. America took the “of” out and flipped it I guess. We’re all about efficiency over here *major fart noise*
---
Happy 20th of December and Happy Christmas Harry
---
If you're wanting to play PvE server, then Mirage is pretty good. I do think its about 60/40 favoring Alliance, if that's a dealbreaker.
---
Yes, honor.
---
Your post a few weeks ago helped me out a lot in making sure I knew what I was getting into
---
Efficiency, or institutionalised laziness. But I'm not here to judge...
---
Theoretically only 25 if they all create nine level 10 alts and play a few games of WSG on each one.
---
Nah thats enclave theyve been edge lords a decade atleast now
---
If I am ever asked to cover on my alt, I would never roll against a main. We need the mains geared for BWL, that is the priority. Being part of a guild means you are part of a team and if the team needs my alt, they get it without question. I dont know what people are diong in guilds if they have a loot whore mindset, just go pug MC.
---
That's the only version that they're had always been, and people have been banned for using it in the past
---
Seriously this. Leveling herbalism does not make you no money. Everything you pick is worth money. Albeit less than a more consistent farm, when you hit 300 and are farming the big boys you’ll thank us
---
It takes 2 weeks of bracket 1 from rank 13 to hit 14. So you'll have 9 rank 14s a week if you stack successfully, and only the rank 13 people are in bracket one. Realistically, that's not gonna happen. More likely you'll get maybe 6 people a week cycling through.
---
Yea you are not a nice person, and no fun to talk to. You would never be happy.
---
God dammit this is great banter
---
wow way to showoff that midriff, lewdie
---
smh smh :smh: triumph
---
Mirage Raceway is good. First founding PvE server, 60/40, favoring Alliance, but Horde is still very active, with plenty active pugs going at most times.
---
GM disappeared a few weeks ago, going from online 24/7 to nothing because his wife gave him an ultimatum. Seemingly wasn't able to do compromise to healthy play times in the months running up to this. MT and officer took over for a few weeks, then handed GM to another officer "to fix dkp", did a no-show the next raid night and hasn't been seen since. Guild is still going for now, not sure it will survive the holidays with an intact raid team though.
---
About the only thing i can think of is that we had a tank roll need on, and win, Finkle's Skinner. He didn't have skinning but argued that he *could* and that it's a really good tanking weapon. 
---
The only person in the group who had 300 skinning was a pug Hunter. The tank bragged about it in guild chat afterwards, trying to make himself look like the victim and the Hunter as the asshole for calling him out on it. 
---
After myself and a few others called HIM out on being an idiot and a dick, he promptly gquit.
---
Band of accuria from ragnaros?
---
Best advice people could get 👏
---
Well, as a solo mage you wanna go instance farming anyways. There you are always welcome and the xp is from decent to amazing. Or maybe by now you actually could do a bit of AOE farming out in the world again.
---
Why is it a problem?in wsg you can’t do anything alone, because 10 men premades are allowed. They will be even stronger when they reach rank 12-13. At least in av they can’t join together, and a solo person can rank there.
---
Ranking was always gonna be shit. If you thought it wasn't gonna be shit you were delusional. Even if blizzard "fixes" this it'll still be shit. I don't know why you're complaining, you should have known what you signed up for.
---
It wont be as bad as p2, but you also wont see roving gangs of alliance either. They will all be in BGs due to queues. Horde will be able to gank uncontested
---
One other thing to mention about the thunderclap opener: over the next 3 global cooldowns I can back up away from any sheeps/shackles, and then everyone is free to aoe/whirlwind/tab target (a dangerous guilty pleasure) without worry.
---
People are solo-queueing for WSG, even though you get less honor compared to AV and the only reward is the tabard. 
---
There is also a reason they changed AV later on. And the first change was to give a gameplay reason to destroy the towers. So the first change was to reduce the rush time.
---
That's IT support you're talking about.
---
I'd sell my actual hand for 900g.
---
Haha well we Brits are also the best comedians!
---
But in all seriousness major gratz on your mace and other PVP gear, even if it is a male gnome!
---
I'm here praying for my 2nd binding every week!
---
with spell batching even more op
---
sharex above them all
---
Everything I searched just turned up info on AV rewards, how to run AV, WSG strats, what rewards are given from WSG etc etc.
---
Sharex is so good
---
I'm a lvl 37 warlock. The other day I got ganked by a lvl 39 druid in catform. Got hit for 300 and then 600, and I died not long after. Tried spamming seduction but nothing happened. Are druids immune to seduction while in animal form?
---
 [https://ironforge.pro/servers/](https://ironforge.pro/servers/) 
---
It's not 100%, but it's the closest we have.
---
The ones where Alliance outnumbers are all pve servers (with heart seeker being the exception).
---
op is playing TBC
---
So he can obliterate gearless noobs in wsg premades with consumables which he farmed for 3 months.
---
If you’re that casual of a player (no epic mount yet) than any argument you have about insta-queuing being superior is essentially moot.
---
Quick relog won't cancel your queue.
---
If the "classic community" wasn't a bunch of fucking spergs who abuse every scrap of power granted to them we'd still be able to kick afk'ers. Instead we get this.
---
How'd that go for them in terms of population? xD
---
LOL
---
When spell hit showes up do Warlocks out outpace mages? I know one mage will always get the ignite stack but the normal mages, where do they stand
---
Here you go OP. 38% miss and 0 crits

Fully raid buffed (~25% crit) I had 4 fights with no crits last week
---
This isnt classic! AB isnt even released yet!!! hahaha
---
??
---
I agree, i've seen low dps coming from plenty of people and i wonder, how? And you see what they do and you're just like... what the actual fuck.
---
WSG is 10vs10 CTF which virtually everyone finds more enjoyable than a 40v40 PvE fight. On top of that the sheer numbers advantage a WSG queue has would make it obvious to any non-moron that if they gave equal or near equal rewards then AV queues for horde would easily be over an hour as they’re already above 10 mins while it’s by far the best honor farm. Even in Vanilla AV queues could be over an hour because nobody wanted to do that shit regularly. Take into account the hyper min max culture we have now and you will find AV to be a complete ghost town a week later if it wasn’t the best way to rank up.
---
Hey, how was your WSG honor since BGs release?
---
Too late, inflation kicked in 2 months ago, should have gone hard first 3-4 weeks of launch
---
Holy shit, as horde it took me roughly18 hours total from neutral to exalted
---
Because you spread mis information?
---
Enjoy the long queues and Alliance premades.
---
First I had to choose between playing with my top guild from retail or RL friends.
---
The top guild had ridiculous queue times for many weeks so it was easy to choose RL friends server.
---
Forward months later and now I’m the guild leader in a guild that was for our RL friends and I’m the only one still playing.
---
I invite random people and of course they either quit or leave for other guilds eventually.
---
If the only other level 60 in the guild leaves then I’m probably going to leave too and that will be the end of this sad attempt for RL friend fun.
---
Yup, blizzard isn't gonna go through every user thinking "is he just doing it for the cosmetics or cheating", in addition to that free cosmetics hurts their pockets so they wouldn't even bother trying.
---

---
I think you are being pedantic I just assumed because he said b is in the title he meant I'm in the best in slot gear doing this run
---
Yeah, the split into Atlas and Envy I believe? Envy was already established.
---
Same.
---
My ex-guildies ended up in a 3 way server split due to queues and a failed coordinated transfer.
---
Some started on an ultra high pop with 6 hour queues. The 'casual' players (people with jobs) couldn't standing being in a queue for 2-4 hours after coming home from work so re-rolled on another high pop (no queue) server.
---
Then when free transfers opened up an attempt was made for everyone to transfer to the same server. Some transferred while others chickened out and stayed. 
---
Overall it was hilarious to watch from the sidelines while I played with my RL friends
---
Honestly just let ranking go if you want to actually enjoy PVP and classic in general. 
---
Get your AV exalted, get your raid gear and go have fun in world PVP, WSG, and eventually AB.
---
oh oh oh I thought it was some in game mechanic I was like wtf is this guy talkin about lol
---
Do you think it's 5 mannable with that strategy?
---
Preach - all the more satisfying too when laying waste to furries, creatures and rib cages
---
SAME
---
Heartseeker is full of cancer. Server should be purged.
---
No, and the members would frequently spam “hail Horrigan” in chat. It was ridiculous.
---
Well, I was in a totally unorganized guild when I started classic. The creed was to just invite as many people as possible and create a loose coalition of people without any rules or obligations. Turned out surprisingly well and was a fun community, until phase 2 dropped.
---
Our GM was still lvl 55 at this point (we had only about a dozend 60s out of around 200 guild members) and horde started to run amok and conquer the world.
---
Fortunately I was one of the 60s and content with only leaving IF when dying my way into a dungeon, having already done everything that was to do in the open world and thus no need to ever venture forth into this horde dominated hell otherwise.
---
Unfortunately our GM, like so many poor &lt;60 alliance, felt the full force of it. 
---
Long story short: after around one week of being perma-ganked whererver he tried to go, he ragequite by kicking everyone from the guild, deleting the guild and then deleting his character.
---
I am not sure whether he starte over on a PvE server or quit wow for good
---
Ok. Lol
---
The community has no idea what they want. There are way too many people and too many opinions. No matter what blizzard does, people will bitch on reddit and the forums.
---
I agree with a lot of that. Bwl is totally doable, and it isn’t anywhere near as challenging as aq40, but it is not the same cake walk as MC. Coordinated and well geared guilds will get through, but there is definitely a lot less room for error. I’m definitely excited for it! Bwl is where the real raiding in classic begins imho
---
I used to be super skeptical. Levelled my first char to 50 or so without a bank alt.
---
"Eh it can't be that worthwhile"  
---
"I don't spend *that* much time running to the AH on my main"
---
Re-rolled to a new server and got my bank alt to 5 as soon as my main was 10. God damn it's useful. Plus, you get to dress them up in silly banking costumes.
---
Some people may suggest that you need a little bit of FR as melee DPS. Personally, I don’t think it’s worth the bother. Tanks are the only role who “need” Fire Resist gear.
---
50 games in three days us casual to you???
---
Pyrewood village is very nice, transfered there myself from Ashbringer.
---
Same. 
---
Farming the turtles?
---
Are you sure Hit&gt;Crit? 1%hit is basically equal to 1% crit DMG wise, but crit gives Improved Shadow Bolt debuff
---
I'm pretty sure that your Raid Lockout follows you. And your kills for the week don't carry over.
---
Not been to bad to be honest, but we did have a mistake happen as leadership and lost a great player due to it. 
---
We are technically a Loot Council, but almost everything is about desiding who can roll for what. For rogues we use a rule where they decide for themselves if they want to go daggers or swords and hence can't roll for both. We made it somewhat clear that your choice should be disclosed in discord.
---
 The rogue CL (class leader) fucks up because a rogue A tells him in pm that he will go daggers (this never gets discolsed in discord), and they both honestly forget to put it there. In total we now have three dagger rogues A, B and C, but B and C don't know about A. 
---
Then comes a raid where rogue C is not attending and a perditions blade drop from Ragnaros. Rogue CL announces that rogue A and B can roll for it. Rogue B obviously becomes mad because in his mind he is the only one eligible for the dagger and he of course also looses the roll. The problem here is that he does not really say anything  there and then.
---
After this we need to find a solution cause Rogue CL obviously screwed Rogue B over. But suggesting Rogue B gets the next one is quite unfair to Rogue C that wasn't even there. So we make Rogue CL apologize and can't really do more about it.
---
Rogue B who was a core element in the guild both socially and through helping out with things that needs to be done leaves the guild because he is mad... I am still sad the guy let us.
---
I had that issue on Thunderfury as well, even with leveling guilds full of people online, ended up doing a server transfer and haven't looked back since.
---
No man. After the initial rush fails 25% people go AFK hoping for a quick loss. 50% zerg in mid. 10% try to regroup, and the last 15% were AFK to begin with.
---
There's a different between challenging content and content requiring 16 hours a day to obtain.
---
If not from rag/domo -&gt; brutality blade, quick strike ring, OEB (for 2H), striker's mark/blastershot launcher, wristguards of stability, flameguard gauntlets.
---
Seriously though, find a pug that actually kills rag.
---
apparently i read the subreddit wrong. its not necessarily goth girls with big tiddies, its big "goth" girls showing their tiddies. yeesh

God gnomes are so fucking ugly... not sure why people play them.
---
Except an active player actually has to sleep and will always lose against a bot.
---
21 casts only? How long was the fight?

Because it can make it into an actual AV battle instead of this double rush nonsense.

havent played wow for some time holliday time

It's windows shift s
---
My guild imploded 4 weeks in on 1st MC run. No one knew how to lead the raid. One 19 year old kid said he would, they couldn’t beat the 1st boss... I offered to raid lead from work and just have one of them stream on Discord so I can coordinate.... came on the next day to half the guild gone. Was really sad seeing everyone argue about who’s better and who was a closeted elitist.
---
"sneaks"
---
Funny because on Nostalrius the queue was never one hour for AV, even though it gave less honour than WSG. And that was one realm with max 10k player on it. Now you have a complete region with well over 10k player queueing for AV. And you will always have people grinding rep for AV because of the rewards. If not for their main, people will lvl alts and have to do the grind all over again. And raids with better rewards arent even out yet.
---
So dont tell me AV would be a ghost town a week later just because you cant rush it in 7 minutes anymore.
---
BTW: AV is more than just a 40v40 PvE zerg. Most of the time you will fight over towers , mines and graveyards with a small amount of people. That is, if objectives actually matter. Alliance dont even cap Iceblood Graveyard because horde would spawn infront of the rush, and that would delay the rush.
---
i know someone in RL with  that name haha
---
I'm a level 44 hunter right now, planning on getting to 50s next couple week over the holidays. Is there any gear I should be going after? It seems like all the dungeons/quests I've done up until now has everything but hunter gear (I know all gear is hunter gear, but I'm trying to be serious). 
---
I have the bow from the STV mastery quest chain, but other than that I haven't found any good gear. Everything that drops seems to be caster cloth or tank plate. Anything in specific I should be grinding for?
---
In our guild, we have: 
---
raiders, people part of the main raid for progress/speedkill, 
---
members, people raiding with us for splits 
---
and alts.
---
since a few month, we are doing 2 MC splits, with like 30-35 people in each.
---
the splits a done so raiders a splits between raid to maximise loots (if 2 war need onslaut girdle they'll not be in the same raid)
---
raiders have prio loot, if a raider need something (for raiding of course, not for pvp) he will allways have prio over member or alts.
---
if no raider wants the loot, then it'll go to rand for members and alts.
---
We never had a problem with loot with alts because of the 2 splits, alts are in the raid to fill up the slots, never taking the place of the main even if the main is full stuff. basically, people are doing one raid with main and the second with the alt. And everybody understand that prio loot is raiders &gt; members &gt; alts
---
anyway, for some class like hunt/drood an alt finish his first raid with 5 pieces T1
---
This has nothing to do with Blizzard Devs.
---
This is a small portion of people such as yourself that are delusional about the state of the game, and think that bringing back old AV would fix the problems. Personally, I don't give a fuck about AV and enjoy the version we have enough to play it, but would never sit in a multiple hour long game for piss rewards. 
---
You blindly assume that just because you want the old AV, so does everyone else.
---
This EXACT SAME THING happened with the paladin helm for me. 3 paladins, 2 helms dropped. Got second on the roll then had to reroll for the second helm. Worst part was that a week before that, 2 of another item dropped and the guild did it in a single roll to where the top 2 won the item. Not in that guild anymore, not strictly due to that, but it definitely didn't help.
---
I’m finding both sides are often 70% or higher twinks but I also run the top 19 twink guild on my server and we squad up hard
---
KEKW
---
Geez, slow it down professor
---
except the gearing goals that you work towards in MC are still relevant all the way till Naxx and in extreme cases Thunderfury up even in burning crusade!  
---
Onslaught Girdle BiS till Naxx  
---
Talisman of Ephemeral Power lasts quite long, ZG/AQ for locks (Mages BWL trinket is better)  
---
Perdition's Blade till AQ40 i believe  
---
Bonereaver's Edge BiS warrior PVP sword that rivals even R14 / BWL Weapons, might be swapped when AQ40 comes for dark edge but it still sick.  
---
Band of Accuria tank ring i think lasts till Naxx atleast  
---
stuff like that makes gearing in this game alot less boring like retail where items arent Unique in terms of stat distribution and each content patch acts like a Diablo Ladder reset or Season...
---
there are no greens that are bis. If you think that only raw spell power is what you need for pve bis then you are wildly off
---
Mirage Raceway had 60/40 in Alliance favor, but still a healthy horde base with plenty of raiding guilds.
---
&gt;At least in av they can’t join together
---
yeah, right
---
For some reason, when the BG is ready to enter, my WoW icon doesn't blink/flash on my taskbar.
---
Is there a way to make it so that it does? I've missed a quite a few BGs while I was alt-tabbing.
---
Will I derank below [out of] Scout? That is, will the "Scout" prefix on my name go away?
---
My old guild very much felt like a family; everyone helped each other and knew each other. Then we merged with a bigger guild so folks could raid, and the tone totally shifted from casual questing and running dungeons to 60s centric, raiding only. Anything not raid-related fell on deaf ears. Well, the thing with raiding is that people always want more, so that guild merged with a BIGGER guild that totally does not espouse the values of my OG guild. Lots of the OG people didn't want to join the new new guild, so the OG guild got reformed, but we lost a ton of people in the back and forth, and now it's basically dead. I'm sad af cause my original guild before the merger was everything I wanted from a guild community, but people's priorities changed. I'm still in the OG guild, but there are very few of us.
---
That's a problem because team play is not rewarded.
---
After months of building up the guild and doing good progress cracks were starting to form, with the same arguments of casual vs hardcore players. Personally I don't really mind of someone else is slacking as we have absolutely no problem clearing any content. 
---
A real tryhard fury warrior started pulling aggro on various bosses because he pops recklessness, gets WF and doesn't wait for tanks to build threat and then started openly blaming the tanks and pushing them to go DW fury/prot  so they can keep up with his damage.
---
What he failed to realize was that we weren't a HC guild and most people didn't really care if we do MC 15 minutes faster and also the healers don't enjoy being stressed and OOM all the time.
---
This continued every week and then Obsidian Edge Blade dropped, but none of the tanks were allowed to roll on it, so they got really pissed off and one of them quit. To avoid more quitting, the GM had an arrangement that the next one will be given to a tank.
---
The problem came when the GM was absent for a few weeks due to real life issues and then the next sword dropped.
---
The officers chimed in and said this was the arrangement they had made, but people didn't give a shit and started arguing over discord that tanks should stick to tanking and never be given any two-handers. The funny part is, this was coming from people that were new recruits.
---
In the end, the tank caved and passed it to the fury warriors, so he can avoid all the drama, but it was already too late and the officer gave it to him. This led to various people that were already looking for an excuse to quit and in the following days more followed, as some of them were looking for more hardcore guilds anyway, but wouldn't admit it.
---
Others just didn't want to bother and wait until the gaps were filled and left as well thinking grass is greener on the other side. Now we're stuck running with PuG's until the end of the holidays and then we'll have to start over.
---
greens are not better, amigo

Agility is the way to go for feral. It adds to attack power, crit and dodge. Crit does the most for cat because of the combo points you get from blood frenzy. 
---
**What are general stat values for our different forms?**
---
**Cat**
---
```Hit Chance: Need up to 9% to be hit capped
---
Attack Power: 14 AP = 1 DPS
---
Strength: 1 Str = 2 AP | With Heart of the Wild, 1 Str = 2.4 AP
---
Agility: 1 Agi = 1 AP | 20 Agi = 1% Crit | 20 Agi = 1% Dodge
---
Stamina: 1 Stam = 10 HP```
---
**Bear**
---
```Armor: 5.06*Base Armor (with 5/5 Thick Hide)
---
Thick Hide is calculated as: (Base Armor (100%) + Dire Bear Form(360%) ) * Thick Hide (110%) = 506%
---
Hit Chance: Need up to 9% to be hit capped
---
Strength: 1 Str = 2 AP
---
Agility: 20 Agi = 1% Crit | 20 Agi = 1% Dodge | Agility does not give AP
---
Stamina: 1 Stam = 10 HP | With Heart of the Wild, 1 Stam = 12 HP```
---
It’s a really great option for tanking Vael, so he’s not wrong - just an asshole for rolling against a skinner that could use it today.
---
Why do people rush content?  It's completely stupid.  I have a 42 Rogue with 11 days played and a 59 mage with 12 days played.  I am taking my time and experiencing all of WoW Classic.  Doing all dungeons, exploring all zones, going out of my way to kill Alliance in world pvp, professions, farming, etc. 
---
Too many people have the mindset of min/maxing which they are missing like 80% of the game doing that.  Most min/maxers just raid log in the end while I am still having fun doing everything and taking my time :)
---
It only shows up for you. So no, it's nothing like people grinding for a different mount.
---
ya he's wrong
---
Real classic experience.

Ya enjoy the ban that comes to a majority of bot users.
---
yes please do i like 2 shoting clothies

If you don't trust loot council, then you should find a different guild tbh. All loot should serve long term success of the guild, imo. No other system really serves that purpose.
---
Juste reroll alliance and it wont be a problem
---
Why, what changed for warriors in 1.12?
---
alts only get stuff is no mains need it

I think it’s the word “entire” that is misleading. Near clickbait.

Aggre meter has never worked correctly in phase 3. It's too much for the threat meter to calculate that it should apply threat from phase 1 and not phase 2.

What consumables do you use on Nefarion alone that will cost 50-100g? I'm struggling to think of anything that could cost that much, unless you're counting a flask.

ZUG WHY NO BG POP NEED TO ZUG ALLIANCE? ZUG.

So it sounds like you want a button conditional. There's a good page explaining how they (and all other conditionals) work [here](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Macro_conditionals).
---
I think you want something like:
---
/cast Ice Block  
---
/cancelaura [mod:shift] Ice Block
---
Warning from that page:
---
&gt; Beware if you're using keybindings for your macros. If you bind A to a macro with, say, [modifier:shift] and you have something else bound to SHIFT-A, the SHIFT-A binding will take precedence and your macro will not run.
---
You do realise that AV would be pretty dead if this was the case? All the honor farmers would move to WSG. No one would be playing AV after they got exalted.
---
Recently, essences of air have been going for a bit on my servers (17g-21g per, depending on the day). Usually in Silithus during the morning or during typical "raid times" the evening after reset, I can farm for an hour or so and get anywhere between 3 and 7 essences. Pretty damned good cash. Additionally, you could try farming instances for cash. That could be in the form of farming the last portion of Mara to vendor boss loot or learning to solo Angerforge and Ring of Justice so you could sell loot runs to others.

This reminds me of a game the other day. We summoned Lok and it went for like 7 people fishing there. I charged in and died. No one else was with me watching this thing. Lok gives you confidence but doesn't 1 shot 7 people at once.
---
Bro, get a warlock to farm eye of shadow with you, he will chainfear the demons and you just heal him for lifetaps. When it drops, you give him 100g for the effort and all happy
---
Your best bet is to run high level dungeons that have pre bis gear for your class.
---
IIRC firemaw is the only fight where it might be useful
---
however with the amount of DPS we are outputting in this patch vs when BWL was out in vanilla im not even sure itll matter on anyone besides tanks
---
On Average I have 25% Misses and I have 1% since I replayed my Neck with the Raggi-Chocker. I really can't wait for BWL and ZG. 
---
Warlock DPS is super random, sometimes I have like 45% during a Bossifght + luck with Nightfall and I top the Damage-Meter and sometimes I start with 3 resists and I know I don't need to look at the DMG-Meter for this fight.
---
Queus are working fine bud. Horde players bullied alliance players off thier servers and now they finally are getting some kind of repercussions.
---
Meanwhile horde queues are already sitting at 13-15 minutes for AV. Turn AV into what you want and queues will easily be 1 hour plus. 
---
Maybe you should take your own advice.
---
&gt;You're evidently clueless on this subject, so why talk?
---
Come to 49 Bracket, everyone has the majority of their class toolkit, 31 Talent Point and gear is pretty balanced.  
---
Seriously the most fun I've had with WOW.
---
This is bascially exactly how the fight usually goes for me. At max range or in AV where there's pressure to not get too close I'm generally fine but in most if not all 1v1 situations with a good mage, I always lose. They're usually mounted, so it's difficult to dismount them before they get close enough as well unless I get lucky. 
---
It's a shame but I think mages are just a really hard counter unless I'm better than them or I get lucky with some resists/engineer abilities. Thanks for the input everyone.
---
???????
---
they are better than t1.
---
every high logs done locks are done with several greens and almost never a single t1 piece.
---
They are easy to level, but they are verrrry slow. Rogue's kit lets them escape and control fights, but while that can make them hard to kill in questing situations, it always results in extra kill time. Gouge doesn't heal you, it stops damage from happening. The effect on your end HP is the same as a priest casting renew or pw:s on themselves, but while a priest uses mana which can regenerate during downtime, you use energy + gouges duration, so you take longer to kill things.
---
I had a guy roll 1 from his first roll twice in a very short period (on a 100 roll). 
---
He decided to quit for the night soon after :P
---
apparently https://pathofdiablo.com/
---
Just noticed that on the coast of STV you get deviate/oily blackmouth and firefin in the same damn spot. I queue up at UC and take zeppelin to grom base and fish outside. Pretty fast
---
No, the title always stays. So people that get rank 14 and then drop to rank 1 will still be able to use their rank 14 title
---
You can thank the #NoChanges ppl who will inevitably bitch about tweeks and how its "not the true Vanilla experience" and if you dont like it to "go back to retail." 
---
They are why Blizzard wont and cant change obvious issues with Classic.
---
Would you say DKP is the way to go for a semi-hardcore guild?
---
Icwutudidder
---
The title is according to the current rank. Previous highest rank can be seen if you inspect that person and check his honor tab.
---
The maraudon kill princess quest gives you a good bow, princess drops a very good ring, another boss near her drops good agi boots. Definitely do maraudon, and do the quest for the scepter, it's a great way to make money at 60 for your Hunter. Hunter is pretty great because of how gear independent you are while leveling, so just focus on grabbing the bow and wearing the stuff with the highest agi.
---
Maybe my server is just more competitive, but if you want to push the top brackets you need the honor from HKs. It adds up when playing 18+ hours/day.
---
Don't worry, only have to wait another 20 months or so and it'll be here too.
---
Blizzard likes money.
---
Curse of being a warlock right now...no matter how well geared/flasked/potted you are, a bad rng fight right fucks your parse.
---
If anybody is on Mirage Raceway EU there's a 53 troll hunter in East Feralas constantly farming beasts with two boe daggers.
---
Pls report :(
---
Everything is a good gold farm if you aren't spending the time yourself.
---
They are both high pop. Likely the only time you will see queues for them again is when a new phase drops.
---
I wish they banned people who talked about the Nos server. So tired of seeing it being used to try and change Classic WoW.
---
Dagger, swords, shields, two-handers, claws, bows, guns and why not even Staff of Dominance?
---
Warrior is the new hunter!
---
Marginally better than a lot of others and only in certain cases so I wouldn't call it op. If you don't think hunter pets are op in general.
---
KSK?
---
leather and grey drops add up, seriously.
---
Thick Leather and grey drops. Less risk of being spotted by high levels, less chance at report, longer time for bot to run, better profit in the long run.
---
Is it a challenging experience or are you just wiping to easy bosses because your playing with people who barely play the game.
---
Yeah, that is what it means. 
---
There is a itemlevel specific part as well, but it is highly unreliable in classic because some things that are very low ilvl can be much better than higher ilvl ones.
---
Example: The warrior savage gladiator chain chest is a ilvl 57 item that is much better then any other chest  obtained in MC, BWL, PvP ranking or ZG items that have an ilvl of up to 75.
---
Mormon?!
---
That’s ridiculous.  Maybe paid 80g for my recipe.
---
No need at all.
---
Yes, nameplates can be fully customized by addons (except for their placement). ThreatPlates is one addon that adds a lot of customization options, though I'm not sure if it lets you adjust class colors.
---
Nucleus Pog
---
I got from 50 to 60 in about 25 hours spamming brd prison on my priest.
---
No one needs fr except tanks, just pots, like pserver.
---
Doesn't gank also mean someone attacking you while you are fighting mobs or are low on health/mana?
---
Holy paladins have great sustained single target healing, not great HPS on multiple melees taking damage. I would say if you need FR, you need more on alliance. Horde can just brute force heal with LAZERS the whole melee group, especially with 3x T2 bonus.
---
wut?
---
Or old players who just moved on, replaced by new players you don't know.
---
wat :S
---
Happened to me once at the end of a dungeon run. Everybody left and I could kill anything alone to get that 1 xp, I got hearthed to SW and couldn't train my new spell. I had to fly somewhere, kill 1 mob and fly back because of 1hr HS CD..... lame.
---
That'd be a yikes from me dawg.
---
Spending 20 hours a day doing the same thing is incredibly unhealthy. Seek some help, you'll thank yourself later.
---
Then go swords for your raid and rock the viskag. Off hand damage is irrelevant in hemo spec. Off hander is just there to apply poisons so you don’t need CHT at all
---
What does hardcore look like when there are only 1.5 raids available atm?
---
DKP system leads to DKP whores even if you have decay. As it stands right now why the fuck would I ever bid on something until naxx? I know where and when the replacements come in and my output as a healer is barely affected as long as i get 1 more tier 2 which I can get via the bracers pretty easily.
---
Seperate raid for alts/socials. No problems.
---
big true
---
I started playing with my friend on Herod Horde "Because I love horde" Well 3 months went by with playing with him and he randomly rerolled to an Alliance realm to be a pally.  He told me that he did horde back in 2008 when he played and he wanted to experience Alliance.  So now I have been leveling by myself without him and I am so pissed off at the situation I don't even talk to him when he is on "been like that for about 3 weeks now" 
---
What really grinds my gears is that he never communicated with me... If he would have told me in the very beginning I probably would have made an Alliance character to play with him but he didn't say shit.  I am not going to reroll now because I am a level 59 mage who wants to get all pre bis equipment and start raiding with my guild.
---
My god he was indecisive as fuck too!  Started out with a Warlock.. got him to level 40, rerolled to a warrior got him to 24.. rerolled to a rogue... got him to 40 rerolled to Alliance Pally.  It's like holy fucking shit man!!! stop rerolling and see the end game "where the game gets fun"  
---
But I am pretty upset with how he did me.  He kinda got my hopes up and hyped me up to play BG's and he literally rerolls to an Alliance character a few days before BG's released.  He has always been my gaming buddy and we have played multiple MMO's and other games together with a focus on pvp.  
---
I just can't trust him though... even if I rerolled to an Alliance character, he would probably still reroll a lot and never see end game still.  Or just flat out quit.  So I am doing me and going solo for the horde this time.  I have been a huge horde fan ever since Warcraft 2 batte net edition in 1999.
---
Yeah its not insane but it def is the best pet you can get for pvp without a doubt.
---
R14 is not a right, it's a privilege. Anyone with any previous knowledge about the honor system would have known this.
---
Never played on a private server, so I didn't know. I had my suspicions that either it wasn't needed or much wasn't needed. I also thought that pots would be enough. Good to know that so far most people are agreeing on this.
---
Luckily the paid transfers are out now for people who missed the window.
---
Afk reports make them unable to receive honor after a few minutes if they don't get in combat, and after a bit longer they get kicked. In shorter AV matches that never happens unfortunately, which is why afk/botting is so prevalent.
---
Rogue combat daggers - should I take relentless strike 1/1 and lethality 4/5 or just go lethality 5/5
---
Please, explain.
---
I won like 75% of my games on PvP EU.  Was funny watching people say the same things over and over again, despite the fact we seemed to be winning so often.
---
Good data.  Thanks!
---
(Not OP) For me personally, it was just way more fun and interactive.
---
He hit level 60 in saltiness
---
You do realise that Retail raiding is harder than Vanilla raiding right? This is coming from a Vanilla Naxx raider.
---
I’m on Faerlina and I’m not sure where to start :)
---
A gnome is still a gnome.
---
Druids are the only class I haven't leveled before WotLK so I don't have much of a frame of reference for classic. You should only be leveling as feral though. You also make up for lower dps compared to a rogue with zero downtime due to being able to heal yourself between fights. Druids also can perform any role well in dungeons and have a very easy time finding groups as a result.
---
I’m thinking this tome around 10. Maybe 11 for mounts. Do you know if you still to rep bring to use them or if say me an Orc can rock a kodo/raptor?
---
Some ppl wait actually 1-2 hours now. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
&gt; less of an asshole
---
My only comment is that at least make your assholeness fun, not just hit/miss ;_;. Give me a tail swipe, give me a debuff, give me AoE, not just a whiff
---
This made me laugh! Thanks
---
billion dollar company and they have more rampant botting and AFK'ing inside BG's than any private server in history...
---
On LH you could report these people and there would be actual consequences, so it wasn't even worth to attempt and never became an issue.. 
---
If you're ranking it only takes a few days ban and you can't get your bracket for the week. It's that simple..
---
I don't understand why you think it's up to the community to deal with these people when they are breaking ToS
---
If you PVP kill them they don’t take damage. With my lock I will fear them so they can’t fight the mob and it kills them. They then take damage and you repeat until their gear is broken.
---
"You're doing time."
---
"I'm doing the time of my life!"
---
No you will forever be a scout, there is no way to remove the scout rank which required 15 hks
---
Grognards have moved on. They don't see the new blood.
---
Yea that's why the devs made arenas and released it in TBC.
---
The problem with PvP is that you can't award only the most skilled players because there is something in the game called class balance. You can make classes more balanced and it will make giving the most skilled people rewards easier, but it comes at sacrificing the fun of classes and makes the game very boring. 
---
You can either have fun, interesting, and diverse classes that are very imbalanced, or you can have boring, homogenized classes that all have the same abilities just re-skinned and given different animations / cool-downs that are closer to balanced. 
---
Look at the state of pvp on retail. Everyone has self heals, defensives, offensives, gap closers, and interrupts. They all have the same fucking abilities, there's just some difference between the classes on the numbers like how much damage they do, cooldown time, ect. There is STILL massive imbalances and its STILL very hard to give the most skilled people the best rewards because even in a hyper balanced environment, but best skilled players can amplify even the smallest imbalances to absurd levels. 
---
Judging 'player skill' in a hyper imbalanced environment like Classic is an incredibly hard thing to do and it's why time sink was chosen by the devs.
---
You can do that?
---
A well endowed angel.
---
I literally did the same thing last night! Loving the new server and playing with family/friends that I didnt know rolled that server and I was waiting to finally transfer and play with em.
---
Nothing gets by you
---
Dkp guild turned out to be "dkp unless we the officers don't like the result then it's loot council"
---
Striker's Mark is best in slot, though Blastershot Launcher is also pretty good.
---
Do you lose the 10% discount if you derank below rank 3?
---
Asking... uh... for a friend.
---
Most people are in the WotLK dungeons instead, because that's the first suggestion. I've been leveling my Zandalari Paladin with nonstop queues effortlessly.
---
Honestly, I haven't rushed to exalted simply because the current version of AV is so dull. Pre-Nerfed AV I would literally play for hours because it was fun.
---
Or just don't safe spot, and glitch 👋
---
Oof, I won mine over one other person 15 to their 14
---
You can also do
---
#showtooltip ice block
---
/stopcasting
---
/cancelaura ice block
---
/cast ice block
---
That let's you press it once to block, press again to remove block. More susceptible to spamming removing block instantly but no mods needed if you prefer that
---
Don't you have to have 15 HK to even register for rank?
---
900k honor last week and finished in the 2k+ in the standing... I don't know about those numbers.
---
Risky click.
---
Ofc im counting flasks aswell.
---
&gt;If five players queue at the exact same second, their timestamps should be similar enough that they get a large chance of ending up in the same AV. But it turns out that queue times vary wildly from persons in the same group who queued at the same time. 
---
With the population of horde all across one region there is a lot of people queuing at the same time causing it to be unreliable, even if you are 5 ppl queuing at the same time. Even if you look at how it is for allies, it's usual (from what I've seen on streams) that if you are more than 10 ppl you are almost always split up between 2-3 AV instances.
---
Rank 10 head and shoulders are bis for locks atm for PvE.
---
This is PvE bis. Not PvP. You don't need Stam or int right now in PvE. At least not over raw spellpower. T1 is purely a PvP 
---
Source:. Have over 90% parses on all of Mc
---
yes but we don't know it yet
---
I guess you are right. Both of these will however not be available to a large portion of the playerbase.
---
Lmao I keep seeing people say it’s a “waste” on warriors solely because they’re comparing its usefulness to other classes.   Sure, maybe it’s more useful on shamans or paladins but how can anyone argue that it also isn’t a good warrior weapon?   Makes no sense
---
Well, it's still better than Shazzrah's "no melee allowed" clause.
---
or it spawned at some rando hour when people were asleep
---
I assume you go around calling your coworkers racial slurs because you aren’t afraid of air vibrations forming a word
---
Incorrect. Thank you for your effort though
---
Looks like it's ADIS though.
---
Ok, assume there is a person of every class that can put in the effort to craft it, now what.
---
Alliance strat went from rush drek for quick easy wins, to kill galv and Lts then rush to fw. Also horde have been playing a lot more defense. Slows down games a bit but is a lot of fun.
---
No, I’m just pointing out a flawed argument.
---
So it will sort year fiest because it comes first, then months then days, so with minimal effort you can sort a bunch of dates just using a normal sorting method. 
---
If day is first you have to ignore it because if you sorted by day first it wouldn't be chronological.
---
And everyone knows there is no point in playing any games at all if you aren’t optimizing your efficiency.
---
It's great that it's working out for you, but that sounds unfair to everyone else in team 3. If I were in that team and an alt got loot priority over me I'd gquit right away. If everyone only has one main who gets loot, the guild gets stronger overall for upcoming "more difficult" content, just because you can't raid on your main and alt at the same time without multiboxing.
---
Welcome to classic this is how it was and will always be. Go play retail
---
Considering he can drop 8 pieces of armor/weapons while dropping 2 each time on a kill, I would think it would of dropped by now. Im simply asking the community if any others experienced the same bad luck when farming for this item. More of a question of “is this drop rate accurate”? If so then I just have shitty luck. Your reading comprehension seems on point though.
---
True, true
---
Being insensitive and directly insulting your friends and/or coworkers apparently is completely and directly related to being afraid to type out a word without context or implication to your mind. Good job, you're veeery dumb. :\]
---
Back in the day AOEing horde on the bridge was one of the best parts of the game.
---
That's the point. Mc is super high variance for locks rightnnow
---
I remember there was an interview with dev (before launch) and when asked about cross realm BGs they said: 
---
"Its important to their Match making system" (Cant find the video, but Interviewer was TipsOut if you want to find it)
---
So theres probably some algorithm behind it. Maybe theres a hidden MMR or maybe its just class balancing, they weren't specific about it.  
---
Alliance probably ignores it because of Horde queue numbers.
---
5k gold is quite a grind no matter how long you've got.
---
Any recommendations for a US PvE server for a horde player?
---
Yeah and now imagine it being 50% premade losses with 10min AV, 17min queue for 200 rep and 50% drawn out wins with 30min AV, 17min queue for 1k rep. It's soul crushing.
---
Welcome to Classic Wow, there there's no skill, just RNG, and the points don't matter!
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291450/model-swapping-bans-reduced-to-warnings
---
It was overturned for a lot of people but this definitely shows they can track you using it. Combine that with it definitely being bannable and you're really taking a big risk, not doing something completely untraceable like people are claiming on this thread
---
Mages go fire in AQ?
---
Same story here except I rolled with RL friend and they’re the ones who quit except for one or two. Been unhappy for couple of months since I couldn’t join my guild on another server without rerolling. 
---
Logged yesterday to find “Paid Character Transfer” service and did not think twice about it. I just transferred my character to join my guild and told my friends if they wanted to join. 
---
At least now I can be with more committed people that I’ve known for +10 years. FYI, they’re not hardcore but committed and won’t quit because we play for fun ultimately.
---
If you want to parse well you should be dotting the dogs. 
---
Throwing corruption on them at least gives you a higher chance for nightfall proc. While I'm there I give them a bit of doom and amped agony.
---
Source: have a 98% parse on golemagg
---
tbh you dont want the flame gaurd if you have devilsaur, you drop the 2% hit for AP. You wanna get the muggers belt from DM
---
Nice dude, have fun with your family and friends!
---
You can see the floor in that room?  I've still not even seen the npc that queues us.  I have to /tar kar, to interact with him at all.
---
Add a column of zeroes then, might make it easier to comprehend for Horde
---
That sounds like the best course of action. Some guilds in our realm host MC alt pugs consisting mostly of guildie alts + puggers.
---
the number of people who keep 2 sets is extremely low
---
Streaming is JUST beginning probably.
---
Successfully completing Wailing Caverns requires exploiting a jump.
---
Done it 25ish times, I've gotten it 4 times.
---
&gt; Our guild fractured but our 25 man core can run mc just fine so we just kind of continued on with slower runs. 
---
I don't get it. You insisted they use consumes, presumably to make it faster, then after people left because of the drama you went on to just happily do slower runs? So why was there an insistence on using consumables?
---
Grab an addon like gather lite, it puts little icons on your minimap when you loot an herb/mining node, so the more you find the easiesr it is to come back and run a certain path to gather the most herbs you can.  
---
Also grab any quests you missed at 50-60 and gather as you go.
---
Actually. Technically on average you have 16% miss. It's literally in the numbers :p you're just succumbing to bias
---
Do you spend more than 6 hours per day with your family? When I was a teen I wanted to be left alone most of the day. When I was 14 I spend maybe like 30-60 minuted a day with my family outside of mealtime.
---
Please report him.
---
No one ranked to 14 in AV at any point during vanilla. Stop spreading stupid bullshit.
---
ally losing 90% of AVs i kinda prefered wpvp on horde dominated server
---
Two questions:  
---
1: Does anyone know how MSBT work? I wanna have the usual blizzard dmg output text, but I wanna enable (only) the extra things from msbt, like healing, cds that come off cool down, what dmg I'm taking etc! When I look at the options it's either have msbt and have all options, or nothing, no in between!  
---
2: I have a weakauras that display my weapon swing timers, and I want the numbers in it to go away to make it look clean. I can't find the option inside weakauras, anyone knows how? I use tribes weakaura for swing timer if that matters!
---
How is the Horde base more open?  You have to go through a building to get to the towers.  The alliance base is open.
---
To the point.  Turn ins on alliance are generally done once Horde have the base because the NPCs are dead.  Horde turn ins aren’t touched
---
Alts have their own raid
---
Bizarre conclusion you've drawn to be honest.
---
Look at how they're fighting in a choke point sums them up for starters
---
Youre an evil korean
---
You lose
---
I don't think you can kite a bot. They won't fight back or follow you, they just fight mobs.

Dimmunoificency is a horrible condition
---
Fury warriors love rag. He isn't that bad you should find a pug that kills him
---
Yep, in retrospect it wasn't really as much as a problem as I had feared, we were thinking that mismanagement of this whole thing would separate us for a year or more. I wouldn't be surprised if the Flamelash situation (and comparable situations) are a big reason for this earlier release than most of us imagined. Blizz totally fucked it up with their free transfers so now they just let people move where they want so you don't have people quitting because their server is ruined.
---
Its called being respectful regardless if you are on internet or not. Dont be like the rogue in the post.
---
ah didn't know this is how it worked, thanks
---
IT work is not defined by knowing everything, but by the ability to learn anything.
---
So the population of Classic now isn't really representative of the population back then. Twinking was a thing back then but not everyone did it for various reasons. Since the crowd that is playing classic is more in touch with game systems, how to get gold, what gear to get, etc you are going to see a lot more twinking happening now.
---
I stopped at 29/39/49 on my Hunter in Vanilla to do WSG because I would routinely pass my friend and I know I did fairly well in most matches with just whatever gear I had gotten from questing/buying off the AH. Sure I would get demolished occasionally by a team of 5 or 6 twinks but there were still some people in there that were on my level that I could compete with.
---
I imagine now it's more like 80-90% of the 19 and 29 brackets are twinks because there aren't really a lot of new players picking it up and most people know how and what to get from reading guides for the past 15 years.
---
What makes the base superior?  Horde also have a check point  being the gate
---
No it's not, but WoW players are a prickly bunch who get mad at people typing 'ding' in gchat, posting an upgrade in gchat, taking screenshots on their phone, etc etc. Fairly innocuous and meaningless thing, but it's a big deal to this community.
---
Fuck you
---
Yea the video I posted said as much. Pretty much said larger races have to buy noggenfogger or w/e it's called.
---
hey nobody notice I blurred out my name but not on my minion
---
I dont really care anyway idk why I even did it LOL no sleep grinding AV I guess
---
Can't alliance just kill him anyway? Why would killing him reset the head?
---
Had this guy in an AV yesterday (weird coincidence). He was shit talking and rude the whole time (not so weird coincidence).
---
My guild is transferring off of Fairbanks on Tuesday. They are leaving to go to Savory Delight. Guild I’m referring to is Entitled. I will be staying on Fairbanks with my IRL friends and now it’s time to look for another guild.
---
“I intentionally waste people’s time and obstruct them from their goals because it doesn’t fit my vision of how to play a video game.”
---
People are going to rank and want to min/max regardless of what you want or think, and you’re just making an already insane grind just a little worse with each game you’re in. Your narcissistic behavior deserves the abuse.
---
Pretty sure racist slurs have plenty of context and implication.
---
You might enjoy dumb-bed down mechanics, but I don't.
---
wait how lmao knock them back? thats so golden
---
You’re absolutely right. There are other MMOs to conquer as well.
---
A pair of adidas would be quite a nice gift from your boyfriend
---
One of our friends made a guild and ended up being successful. Power went to his head and would hide in private officer channel in discord and no one could or wanted to talk to the officers. We all just quit and don't talk to him anymore.
---
If you make private channels in a discord server before you even ever have a problem you are fucking full of yourself.
---
At least your server discord actually enforces those rules.  Our server discord is a toxic hellhole with a ton of zoomer mods all with a power complex.
---
Jeff Seid scrubs, I miss Zyzz the true c\*&amp;t.

I'm proud of you and jealous of you. Keep fighting the good fight.
---
So is this a "bur" ?
---
When you're recruiting pugs for your raids, mention that you are recruiting for full timers and lay out your plans for leadership and loot.
---
Most of my guild agrees on this...  sad day that we cant kite for the fun of it. 
---
Big dragons seem to have about the same HP as Onyxia wardens.  They dont last very long any more. 
---
To add, we had very few folks with exp useing pet bar. Not so much the case anymore as folks have exp from solo farming BWL and other raids/Dungeons and dailies give you this mech to use.
---
No points in imo SnD. Its a PvP build. 
---
Rotation? Same as combat: Open with Garrote&gt;Feign&gt;keep SND up and hit CB+5pt Evis when you can. Vanish&gt;Garrote once the first Garrote wears off. Prep&gt;Vanish&gt;Garrote when that 2nd Garrote wears off then vanish&gt;garrote on CD. 
---
If it’s a multi mob fight I’ll do a 1-2pt rupture, tab to new target, repeat as necessary. Idk I just run a pvp build for the imp stealth talents so I can stealth run shit. If I had my epic mount I’d respec to combat swords when I raid.

Esfands guild, Crusade, has an officer backstabbing other officers telling esfand to demote/kick em or he will leave. This has happened already 2 times and Esfand explanation has always been the most indirect one, avoiding the problem and blaming the victims.   
---
Im staying in crusade only to see it crumble while I gear myself, because this guild and his current officers are a joke

As mentioned earlier in the thread the guy that drops the onyxia buff  is the target here. Lots of guilds want the onyxia buff right before they leave to go raid since it is a very strong buff. However sometimes timing is off and someone drops it early before everyone logs on to raid. The way onyxia buff works is that once the head is dropped it stays down for 6 hours before it despawns and you can drop another head to get the buff again. However someone posted earlier this week demonstrating that an Alliance priest can mind control the guy, let the horde kill him, and then when that happens the head goes up and the 6 hour timer is reset. This post is demonstrating that you can do the same thing with a gnomish mind control cap (so that you don’t have to be a priest to do it, just an engineer).

I can inspect almost any fury warrior on my server and see them in prebis and every pug I go in has to be reminded to switch to pve set because everyone has them but not everyone remembers.
---
It's not 2005 anymore there are too many resources readily available to be that lazy and people who are know they're gimping themselves. You have no way of proving either way regardless.
---
Yes. In AV you don't even have to win. You get ridiculous honor just from killing NPCs.
---
Listed mine at 750, The 58 lvl mage whispered me. We ended up at 675. I though it would take longer to sell it tbh.

Holy shit dude I am so sorry... your dad is a douchebag.

I am addicted to wow but I will never let myself get like this.  It's all about finding a good balance with gaming.  Currently, I only play wow on 4 evenings and the other 3 days per week is dedicated to hanging out with my fiance, family, and friends.
---
Full BiS would be vs MC gear would be interesting 🤣
---
Seeing as most classes only get 4-5 items and keep there pre-raid BiS some time.
---
And... You didn't think this was a potential source of income?
---
Its been a bug for years now. Vanish will work like 60-70% of the time and I don't think Blizz ever came around to fix it.  I have also pvp'd a rogue where he vanished in the middle of me casting a frostbolt and the bolt broke him of his vanish. Don't think that was supposed to happen lol
---
I am nowhere near a top 10 ranker but i went from non existent to standing 200 since BG came out. I had no desire to wpvp but i love bg's
---
Absolutely not.
---
Use snowballs to punt them out of the portal, giving them deserter.
---
The raid leader gave everyone raid assistant (gives permissions like marking target, making raid warnings) without giving full raid leader. First thing Jeff does with his new power is make a raid warning as shown.
---
Actually I’m an angry New Yorker, you lose
---
I’m classic debuff slots are very much important. I was only bleeding crap cos half the raid was dead

Isn't dancing between Feral, healing, popping back, safeguard of Bear etc much quicker? From my experience watching druids they seem to go quicker over time as they can spend mana healing?

Neah on the gold.

Maybe with getting ony backs made but even that is cheap if you have a friend or guildy that can make it for you.

If you decide to come to Dreadmist consider joining Tide Pod Survivors. Largest leveling guild on the server and runs pretty much all lower level dungeons several times a day.
---
Fury is dumpster tier and couldn’t even hold BRM against 15 alliance during the height of P2
---
Mark of the Chosen is ridiculously undervalued because of the color of its frame and the item level.
---
My guild was a disaster. I'd put them under scrubcore with leaders that thought they were the most important people on our server. They started so much shit with other guilds, purposely fucking over Ony head drops or having their raiders verbally abuse members of other guilds. Extremely fragile egos. They gave things like the Ony head to their favourite raiders, and ran an extremely corrupt LC. I left two weeks after MC dropped and heard from some friends left that they started demanding screen shots of your inventory to prove you had flasks or you wouldnt be considered for raid.
---
I know you are talking in the past but in case you happen to make the same mistake there is an item recovery service on the support website. You can use it once every 15 days, can recover any amount of items in a certain time frame (don't remember how long it is).

Not really. I’ve won tons of games with a few horde in the room while everyone ignores and burns drek. Problem here is doing the premade strat where everyone stacks without leaving one with cc outside to stop any incoming horde and call out to spread out if needed.
---
Type /who warlock tenaris. Pick one and pay him well to summon you.
---
The hard packed snowballs knock back players &amp; NPCs. 
---
You can only hold 5 at a time, though, and they have a 30 second cooldown so this would probably take close to 10 minutes per person and doesn't really seem practical to me.
---
You go in as part of a group, and then leave the group.  You get hearthed after 60secs
---
People have been posting fake honor reports to demoralize other players fighting for standing, or even to inspire people to leave a server.
---
You will be poor.

Sorry

Just as good? Take two identical pictures, one with phone and one SS and I bet you we can always tell the difference. It doesn't matter how *nice* your phone is
---
My guild has about 300 different users, and each day we all say goodmorning, goodnight, grats on every item dropped and every time someone "dings". I actually have macros, for Congratulations and Goodmorning :)  And we have loads of fun! No one is bothered by it! Your guild's government sounds too uptight!
---
You can by kiting the mob its fighting

The Lobo’s proc is good for PVP.  Beside that it’s crap.   The dagger from UD strat that gives 30 AP or some like that.  It’s just a stat stick.

It use to in Vanilla and was changed before BC (the patch were in) 🤣

Dwarf/gnome:

Run up north and over the mountains and die in wetlands. Ress, take the boat to theramore then swim south and die once you zone into tanaris, then ress in gadgetzan. You’ll level from exploration though, so it’s impossible to get there as level 1 without a summon.
---
Fun video. The dirty clicker comment is me exactly. I just can't give it up...
---
Alts don't run on our main raid, and currently we don't have enough alts + leftovers to form a second group, so alts pug. We're working toward doing a Thursday run for our alts + alts in another guild we have a good relationship with though.
---
Yeah that would not be fun
---
There is usually around 4-5 twinks on each side. I would say that 80% of the players are lvl +27 - but the majority of players are not twinked.  
---
Twinked or not, meeting 7 paladins, 1 priest and 2 DD  is probably the most fk'ed battle I've been in... all lvl +27 and couldn't kill a single bastard. It only took one fight in the middle for my whole team to completely lose hope. The rest of the game was spend watching them from our GY. Healers can work, twinked or not
---
Any chance you are in Fairbanks? This exact thing happened to my guild around the exact same time. I won’t name guilds out of courtesy but just wondering.

"Spy allows players to cheat by subverting game mechanics"
---
You are well within your rights to dislike Spy (I myself have some misgivings about it) but claiming that it is cheating is just flat out incorrect. Blizz's own ToS allow for add-ons to display in game data already available to players, which is exactly what Spy does. Spy takes data from the combat log and conveys it through visual and audio queues. 
---
"crush the creators in court if you have to."
---
I think you may be either confused or uninformed about the cost/benefit breakdown of actually taking individuals to court, especially over something like creating add-ons which Blizz may or may not like.
---
But how would we know how smart and smug he is?
---
Yeah, I have toons on both sides on smolderweb.
---
I know there is as addon call flash something or something flash for retail, not home to look at my mods. You can look to see if it has been back ported to classic. As for an in game setting no other than the sound in background, that I have seen.
---
Razorgore is fine I think

Cat vs Wolf vs Wing Serpent for PvE?

Pagle. I'm awful at convincing people so yeah just trust me it's great here.

You made gold. Who cares.

If it was a Epic book from DM then maybe. 
---
Those items have a shelf life. Best to get them out the door and put gold in your pocket ASAP.
---
I'll take that 5% over a 50g Respec for a spec that's trash for pve and pvp. It only cost me like 8-10 mins to get back there and maybe 1g for the invis pot and explosive
---
If your gonna do tributes only for like two weeks straight then sure but most people do mc, dungeons, av, warsong, wpvp.
---
ITT: a bunch of people who already forgot how many times they wiped on every boss in MC with their raids(pug or not) for the first month.

This one was super easy to break. Once you pm it, it will stop whatever it was doing and try to disconnect. I added it as a friend so I can randomly pm it :3

Nah, druid dps. Although, they did PREF A HEALER
---
We 15 man onyxia as a guild whenever ony is up and we 1 shot it everytime. They are about 8-10 minute kills, and I'll help ya out a little bit.   
---
P2, all ranged pop all their cd's and melee pop cds when she starts to run. With 4-6 ranged we get out of P2 in about 4-5 minutes. Right when she goes up in P2 she releases about 10-15 whelps from each side. There is a second set of 10-15 whelps that if our ranged dps die we sometimes hit, so I'm guessing around 4-5 mins after she goes up that second wave of whelps hits nomatter what. When shes about to pop down to P3 we try and save a whelp to put on the tank so he can generate rage so right when P3 comes our tank has full rage and is spamming abilities. Most of the time our mages die(I'm a mage) so I already know when P3 comes that im basically standing in the taning spot because I'm going to die nomatter what. Also nobody attacks for at least a minute so the tank can build threat.   
---
TBH it's so much easier with less people, less people to mess up and more people to run around. During P2 remember that you dont have to stack on the sides or whatever. When she announces she is going to breath then you have a solid 6-8 seconds to get there. And most ranged sit in the middle, but I wouldn't suggest doing that because some people don't have fast reaction times to get to the safe area.
---
&gt; you're veeery dumb
---
Huh, and here I was thinking that about you.
---
Onyxia is not a dps race and this is what everybody thinks. It's why it will be 5-10manned after BWL. It's about patience and understanding of the fight.
---
Making money in any capacity requires having a marketable skill. To be an entertainer requires skills in entertainment. You have to provide content people want to see. Some people find success in being a douche bag but that is usually offset by being the top of the top in skill level and always able to back up their trash talk (xQc is a good example). Sometimes it requires having an outlandish persona (Dr. Disrespect or Disguised Toast when he only wore his toast mask). But most of the time it requires general like-ability from a good communicator with a solid knowledge about the games they play (Jayne, Thijs/Kripparian etc.)
---
So being a basement dwelling douche bag that can't lose a few duels without being extremely toxic looks like a recipe for streaming failure. If he's really good at the game maybe he can get some viewers but I doubt he'll ever support himself with streaming.

Fucking Roman empire..

MC and Ony are a snoozefest because we're on a patch where we're stronger than the raid content was made for.
---
I expect later on the raids will be more demanding, though still not very mechanically difficult
---
What I'm really hoping for is TBC, and I hope we progress through it as it actually happened instead of them just dropping us in on some OP patch that trivializes the content. TBC raiding was incredible.
---
There are a couple of posts about that. And they all say either or.
---
Yes it's 10% less durability for each death but this bot was programmed to go and repair it's gear ... I met it near the mailbox like 5 mins after I took that screenshot.

good damn job sir.

Horde or Alliance?

Dont forget GBoK adds to STR. So raid buffs may make STR better.

That's gotta be a rather low pop server, right?

That's alright. Dumb people often think that of others when their dumb opinions are criticized, quite natural.
---
I really liked Torchlight 2 but Titan Quest is such a slog that never really rewards the effort you put it into it.

Stop exaggerating. That information and spreadsheets that they have are incredible for all warriors and most of the stuff you need you can get without ever interacting with a single person.

You can get your melee in no problem with greater arcane protection pots pre-potted + 1 mid fight.
---
It could go either way even with the IRL friends too. I started classic with 10 IRL friends and we made a guild together, and only me and one other actually played more than 2 months.
---
this is the way, i dont think you even have to zone into tanaris. I attempted to reach shimmering flats by drowning my character a few times and I always ended up in Tanaris
---
Which bosses require which pots would you say?
---
Sul'13 player here..
---
Was one of the founders of the best Horde Guild, CL and then Officer..
---
Guild started fine, had amazing players and quick progression even managing to make Core 2 in a DEAD SERVER.
---
Used DKP, had some minor problems with it, but we managed by doing our best to be fair and treat our players nicelly....
---
Then some REALLY toxic players started getting power.. One of them became the "RL" for Core 2 and treated everyone like a fucking asshole.. Screaming on Discord, calling people garbage, shit dps, retardeds and worse, ignored DKP and sendt the Garr Healing mace to a Priest because he didnt liked the Shaman that would get it.
---
Flash foward to yesterday, massive guild quit, rage, the best Horde Guild in the realm is now split.. I left it too... Cound't take playing with those 3 again.
---
New guild now, working as Officer again, switched to LootCouncil and hoping to make a better enviroment for our players.
---
Loot Council worries me, TBH, but the lead players always were very fair and just so got high hopes for it.
---
Anyway, i'm sad that i had to leave my guild and 1-2 friends there, but the toxicity of some people is just umbearable, kinda like when you have a toxic family or relationship.
---
There is NO replacement for their spreadsheet.
---
it isn't Blizzards fault, but Blizzard did enable the "death" of Flamelash to happen out of seemingly nowhere, rather than allow it to bleed to death which would be the logical conclusion for a lot of realms struggling with faction imbalance.
---
Shadow Priest is incredibly strong at higher levels. I'm a Feral myself because I just love the versatility of the class but it's def one of the harder to play and master.
---
Say there are 200 games of AV going on with 40 players each. Each game lasts an average of 15+ minutes so that's at least 200 * 40 / 15 = 533 players queued a minute, or 53 per second. It should be more likely than not that we end up in the same game, and even if it isn't, it should be likely that we get queues popping very quickly after one another. 
---
In practice, the difference in queues popping can be minutes. The math just doesn't really check out, so there mus be another factor in determining the queue time.
---
I saw the double coc but his cool down on cold snap didn’t activate from what I’m seeing. Kind of confused.
---
FR isn't needed in BWL unless you mean firemaw but nobody uses FR for firemaw.
---
That's just how /roll pugs go. If you want your personal contribution to be accounted for when it comes to loot, you need to find a loot council group.

That's just two week of Frostadamus farming, ez pz

Ye as other people have said it's just buggy. I remember it working perfectly when I started out back in Vanilla but some patch wrecked the skill and it never got fixed. Apparently we are already playing with the "patched" version.
---
Dunno about that. For double drops it's perfectly acceptable to use the top 2 rolls.
---
Unfortunatly my guild has not downed rag yet in a month, we are short on numbers and people have to leave before we get to him, we usually stop at domo and try next week its killing me because I want rag.
---
Vanilla is clear to me! But that's what we always called it I guess. Classic is new and vanilla is old in my mind
---
omg this guy LMAO he use to play henhouse always lose and fucking rage.

I see he changed his stream bio to not mention he only got glad cause he botted, cheated, and ddos and all of his accounts are banned.

literally biggest loser I've ever seen in any game.
---
Well you can transfer over now.
---
How can you be so sure?
---
This is what kinda blows my mind about the community devolving into a toxic cesspool. The average age of players is something like 27-29.
---
Remind me and I'll send you a video later from me levelling. Back to work atm.
---
You can even go so far that u cast different spells if you have a friend or foe in your target. Hydra has a good video on yt about it :)
---
Better shoulders come in bwl same with cape and bracers
---
The targeting of other players nameplates through add-ons has been a common thing in retail for a decade now. It is completely within Blizz's ToS.
---
Your comparison to an addon that would automate actions is ludicrous. You are correct that automation is against the ToS but Spy requires that players take all the actions themselves. Spy does not even auto target, you still have to click the spy interface. Spy simply reorganizes data that is already available to the player, it just makes it way more obvious.

How? You can't even do that in normal groups.
---
It was originally 25, they lowered it to 15
---
Except, at least in TBC arena, the biggest upgrade from arena, the weapon, was available at 1850 rating-- literally anyone, any spec, could achieve that. All it took was some skill. Shoulders were gated at 2000 but it was mostly for status. You could still acquire every other item, albeit slower depending on your rating. I think arena rating ~ points system did a great job of awarding both time and skill.
---
Wow the tryhard 49's sound like excellent human beings they probably dont even have a 60...
---
It isn't the 3rd largest by characters online, you are looking at raid logs on ironforge.pro. The only servers that have queues right now are Faerlina and Herod for the most part (outside of Tuesdays). I think he means it's dead from a standpoint that it's unbalanced

Dude the community was in uproar to KEEP spellbatching.

---
The only thing people should care about when assessing raid performance is the number of casts in that fight, nothing else.
---
I picked my friends, but started a character on the side to level with the intent to raid. Joined a nice guild, couldn't find a raidgroup that fit my available evenings so I started my own with someone I met while playing. 
---
All my friends that were playing have quit already, but I'm having so much fun organising and running the raids that I've dragged in another friend who didn't intend to play wow again to also roll on the same server and join the guild.

so it's A that lead to B that lead to A again?

Enhance was only strong for the first few patches before Windfury was merged into the ground. 
---
At launch Windfury could prove off of itself. After that was needed, and other classes were bugged, enhancement became a mediocre at best PvP spec.
---
That number is often misinterpreted as a comparison from one person to another because it doesn't take into account things like, raid comp, buffs, fight duration, etc.
---
I would advise against Fairbanks, and that's just my opinion from having had a character on there before I moved to the only true 50/50 server, Sulfuras. Fairbanks was dominated hardcore by horde, basically like a Skeram. I get OPs attempt to balance things out, but this just reeks of desperation.

Hunters really shine in AV by standing at max range and attacking casters during front-line pushes.  Also putting up viper sting on healers during these pushes helps your side a lot too.
---
AV nerfs happened in 1.11 but queues were still to long to be viable honor.... but xserver queues in 1.12 made them instant queues and thus more honor/hr than AB/WSG

Green bracers of shadow wrath over T1 (thought WSG bracers will outclass them now).

Felheart is a PvP set, don't get me wrong, it's an Amazing T1 set for PvP and what I wear most of the time, but when it's time to go into MC, in the bag it goes.
---
Yeah and it's also not that new of a feature at all. Present even in the earliest builds of Win10.

Ganking just means attacking someone while they are occupied or unprepared. Has nothing to do with levels

Yeah druids have warlock's number a lot of the times due to that. You have to hardcast fear basically then dot
---
And aside from Don Rodrigos band, apparently
---
Grim Dawn is great, but TL2 felt like you were railroaded on builds.
---
5 NS is better on Baron gheddon and Rag probably (maybe Sulfon/Domo in some cases).
---
Getting over 308 Weaponrating is useless, no way you should use Distracting if youre wearing Aclg
---
The tribute spec is way better for PvP than a standard PvE spec! I don't bother respeccing.. Guild is happy that i'm gifting DM loot to guidies anyway and no raids require high DPS yet
---
Your fault for wsg.
---
As someone who knows this is a bug - nice try to one-up but you just look like an ass
---
The people spamming on the first day or two were right about the honor. This is because alliance were winning in 6-7 minutes. Over time, the alliance started getting slower with their wins and actually started killing mobs for honor on the way. This led to the average 15-17 min alliance wins you saw. At this point, your analysis is right. It’s better to get bal and as many lt and things as possible while still trying to win. However, if alliance were still zerging like day one then what people were spamming was true.
---
Wsg is way more about the individual plays you make while still being about group effort in a strictly pvp environment
---
What's acceptable is announcing a way to handle drops and to sticking to it. I certainly wouldn't accept my raid suddenly changing rules one way or the other.
---
always best to sprint&gt;vanish

btw, they most likely dont delete character, if they use the free transfer. its the same result

Buy a Warmonger  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13052/warmonger](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13052/warmonger)  off AH, after you have purchased your mount.  I bought mine for 25g, though it could me more or less by now.  It requires level 47 to equip, and has an incredible 3% hit on it.  You will notice a big step up in damage output the first time you put this sword on.  It should last you until barberous blade from DM north.  After that, go for a princess kill in Maraudon to get the verdant keeper's bow, that one will carry you until level 51 easily.  If you can't find a Maraudon group don't sweat it because of the AV bow you can get at 51.  At 51, queue up for Alterac Valley with the quest to win.  Upon your first AV win you can turn in the quest and receive  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19107/bloodseeker](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19107/bloodseeker)  which will not be replaced until you get Rhok'Delar from Molten Core.

If you're alliance, look for the Dire Maul hunter book that you can turn in for a +50 ap trinket, I'm not sure what level that quest requires though.  You buy the hunter book off AH.

even though this is probably just a joke post, it aint funny. Don't quit your day job
---
just lol if you don't think systems influence human behaviour
---
 WINDOWS KEY+PAUSE BREAK, will take you right to DEVICE MANAGER. Also Godmode options menu is handy as well
---
1. Make sure your system account has administrative privileges
---
2. Right-click on the Windows 10 desktop and choose **New** \&gt; **Folder**
---
3. Name the folder: **GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}** and hit **enter/return** to make it stick
---
Don’t really think that’s OPs big problem tbh but now we know.
---
no TBC was 2.0.1
---
2.0 was the Before the Storm patch.
---
no layering, vanilla-sized servers, no crossrealm.  prevented.
---
If your guild allows DKP from MC in BWL it is bad. Keep different raids DKP split, Ony and MC has one. BWL has one etc.
---
Just like lots of things, there’s no reason you can’t leave BoEs/offspec/sidegrades off of the SK system, or even do loot council for certain specific items as long as you make all the rules clear.
---
I'm patiently waiting for blizzard's TBC
---
They do say an eye for an eye don't they
---
Why the fuck would you even THINK about making a gnome warrior?
---
Sure he wasn't that much higher, but getting caught by surprise and losing half your health pool in 2-3 seconds isn't very ideal. Combined with the fact that I'm confusing myself over seduction and you have a dead warlock. I only managed to get immolation off lol
---
Possibly, but some people that knew each one IRL claim they did delete.
---
Jesus, this is next level, real boomer shit. Not the fake ass gen-x boomer shit, like real life born in 1959 boomer shit.
---
What player wouldn’t????  You get to BE paid for your entertainment instead of paying for it, seems like everyone that plays video games’ dream
---
I run premade AVs and we can usually get 30 people into one AV. It might take a try or two to do it though
---
I'd be OK with that, but this PvP meta is by far the 'worst of' Classic.
---
It doesn't matter if he needs it. What matters is if he wants it. Stop telling people how to play thw game.
---
Thanks a lot I'll look into it.
---
What is usually most effective? Do they follow the person with the beacon or you sort of lay it down?
---
Thanks, will remember that the next time. I didn't play lock back in vanilla so this is all pretty new still.
---
For rogues there is some fr on tier gear.
---
I have never heard good things about LC yet... It's wild ppl use it.
---
That is inherently a colossal issue though which leaves them well behind most other servers to open it.
---
That's what I grew up on. Way more fun than grinding for rank all day everyday.
---
If that gave us un nerfed mortal strike sure we would.
---
&gt;you can be SURE blizzard will open the gates for you anyways after certain timeframe has passed.
---
Two expansion packs timeframe?
---
Yeah, fair point, I just wanted to play games and have fun but apparently that wasn't on the cards.
---
r/classicwow
---
Your right in part, but hopefully it will inspire change. I am salty that a well made game is being made less advanced. As a player I have adapted to spy, but it in no way has made my gaming experience better. It has only made it worse.
---
What about as a warlock when your shadowbolts resist and someone knocks off your corruption debuffs
---
Can basically do no damage
---
My guild is decentish, one of the best on server
---
But leaders dont care about debuffs currently as we steamroll MC in under an hour with no pots/worldbuffs
---
&gt; 2) force bids for clear upgrades
---
That completely negates the system. If your guild isn't mature enough to handle LC, then it's not a very good guild to begin with any regardless of the loot system used, it'll suck.
---
This guide is terrible, it doesn't even tell me how to upload the screenshot from my phone to reddit.
---
Yeah its a bit strange how that is happening
---
Yes, Horde are responsible for turning their server into a PVE faction by driving all the Alliance away. That doesn't mean those Alliance aren't responsible for choosing to run away when they got what they asked for. You would have Blizz step in and prevent them from transferring or forcing Horde to transfer or some other way of enforcing faction balance. I'm saying they shouldn't, they should let both sides reap what they sowed.
---
I mean its been 14 weeks of raiding most people should have finished MC loot by now. But people always rush to get the upgrades like t2 helm but fail to realise that everyone is guaranteed it. With only 4 priests in a raid to compete against you should never waste DKP on tier gear which is majority of what priests use in t2
---
Focus and preparation is pretty much all you can go by at the moment. It's a mindset you notice pretty easily.
---
It's felt totally normal to me
---
Honestly man it sounds like some of this stress is on you.
---
You either want to play with your friends or you don't. If you're not willing to be flexible for them you can't expect them to be flexible for you.
---
You're playing with a group so you have to make decisions as a group, but it sounds like to me that you made up your mind on what's best and expect them to do what YOU think everyone should be doing.
---
Take a breath, and enjoy yourself. If you're not having fun then step away. And definitely don't ruin any friendships over this. A game is not worth any of it.
---
Pump the breaks a bit....  Give it all time to settle....  Im assuming the only transfer option you would have is paid, so there  is not necessarily a time limit on that.  So you have time to digest it.  As others have mentioned stressers are often best avoided, but given your history with them some time to marinate may do you some good.   Good luck!!!  Wish you the bestest   =\]
---
I've been doing that every raid, swimming across lava before the surger is pulled. Rarely works, but looks hilarious.
---
You're welcome to follow your own advise
---
It’s not a bug, there are just other factors that lead to you being de-stealthed.
---
It’s real tough right now if you’re behind the curve. I’m leveling a mage alt that’s 29 right now and it’s *rough*. No one is around to do a dungeon since everyone’s on their 60 or an alt in the 40s-50s. I found one dungeon group in 3 days. That was a particularly bad stretch, but I’m hoping all the kiddos will be back on now that classes are out for Christmas
---
Having fun playing as a human in your fantasy game, Karen???
---
Log on an hour before raid time and start clearing a DM tribute run for world buffs. 
---
Make sure you have a lock to summon people. 
---
(Every Guildie should have a hearth set to kargath) 
---
Make sure you have enough gold every week to buy 2 stacks **minimum** of all potions/elixirs/flasks/foodbuffs you need. 
---
Make sure you have every enchant (even the hard ones helm/legs) 
---
Make sure you have every necessary addon for your class.
---
Get all 40 people in sync to click the flightmaster at the same time to travel together.
---
Make sure you all know the pull path for the raid and min max drinking when ever out of combat to speed up the run. 
---
Make sure you are all **early** for raids.
---
When you disturb a farming bot, there is a solid chance to make some people go to sleep without eating.
---
Most bots are poor players and they do that for living.
---
Why do you do it ?
---
Atlas and Martial Law, Hurricane is seperate.
---
Ye and dire maul depending on the AH economy.
---
Dots, proximity, and projectiles mid air can all effect vanish and break you out of stealth
---
You don’t have to CC with classes like Hunter, Lock (well you do fear but also do damage while fearing), Priest, Druid that are all super easy to level. Rogue isn’t “hard” but you’re melee so you have to recover more than most classes and you can only really do multiple mobs with CDs unlike Mage that does 50 mobs at a time.
---
Frankly idk why people always want to chime in about leveling and say things like how rogue is easy as if to prove they know better than everyone else. Nobody is saying it’s hard but it’s obviously slower if you’ve ever leveled multiple classes and on top of that no one is clamoring to invite rogues to leveling dungeon groups. The only classes solo slower than Rogues are Warriors and Shamans.
---
Well, you do have the choice of not going for rank gear. I wanted r10 too but gave up on that a couple of months ago when I realised there are too many people with apparently unlimited play time for it to happen. Now I focus on getting alternative gear for these item slots. With the ease of MC/Ony there are plenty of good options, even for us casuals. It'll be a little less than ideal, but I will still be competitive. Maybe I'll be able to get rank 7 for boots and gloves a few months down the line, we'll see.
---
Why are you so butthurt over people grinding for something.
---
the way blizzard handles merges you keep your name.  you become Name-Server, exactly like they show it in cross-realm battlegrounds where everybody's fine with it.
---
Oh I thought some of them went to Hurricane.
---
Yeah but I play warrior, so I have the most to gain from r14 gear
---
i am searching and searching too, for a long time today. i will let you know if i find anything
---
Of course? I don't think anyone ever doubted that.
---
When you cast a spell, the following things can happen:
---
    Hit
---
        Hit
---
        Full resist (due to resistances)
---
        Partial resist (due to resistances, this cannot occur for abilities like frostbolt)
---
    Miss (this is a resist due to lack of spell hit, not resistances)
---
The resist you get from missing a spell is completely independent of the resist you get from the enemy having high resistances. When a mage casts frostbolt, high resistances will increase the chance of a "Full resist" (which the game calls RESIST) but not the chance of a "Miss" (which the game also calls RESIST).
---
Personally, what I find entertaining is others fascination with the dynamic - in this instance, yourself. Similarly, I can almost feel both the excitement and sense of feigned impartiality radiating from your comment!
---
Two words spell batching.
---
Do you have a link to your WA?
---
Isn't it only good as a stat stick for hunters? An arms warrior, ret paladin, and Enhance shaman won't want it because of it's low damage per swing.
---
Another great example
---
You'd make better use of your time by just farming gold to pay for the plans
---
I think you are right lol. Sry
---
Oui oui!
---
My guild has this issue right now but we’re actively looking to replace the casuals on the raid team. They knew from the start that no one is safe. If we find someone better we will bring them. Classic isn’t hard. It’s people being lazy and not trying. We even clear dmt so everyone can get buffs. If we try to teach them and they don’t get it.. well they knew and agreed to what they signed up for.
---
I bet you think guy is using an auto-click software with his keyboard/mouse and not a script which may be safe to use.
---
The exact type of thinking a guild doesn't need.
---
Indeed, our authority does not extend to your mom's basement.
---
No its for weeding out the people who do not take the time/effort/Initiative to learn about the guild and how it works. 
---
If you cant take the time to hop on the guilds discord and read over what the guild is about then chances are you are not too serious.
---
Me too, now i take it slow and try to experience the game with every class and it's given me so many hours of entertainment already.
---
lmao thank you for this reply! Dude was complaining his guild was slow and incompetent while playing in pvp spec. Like you are getting what you signed up for
---
Horde can't really do premade av
---
&gt;rather then profit from stupidity  
---
So where have you been for the last 15 years?
---
If you were getting camped like that in phase one you were probably pretty shit at the game.
---
Horde mage.. hunchback or rib cage?
---
I think it's fine. We need new sub rules so that people who make posts complaining about stupid shit get insta removed.
---
They had no idea where they were going to roll, they wanted a guild, I literally supplied both of those for them.  
---
Not only that, I started leveling an entirely new character to play with them.  
---
Did you even read the post?  
---
Where in the fuck does "leveling a brand new character to play with them" say "not flexible"?  
---
What in the fuck my dude.
---
Main items would be: Brutality Blade, Quick Strike Ring, Onslaught Girdle (Rag), Bone Reavers Edge (Rag), Wristbands of Stability, Flameguard Gauntlets (Better for 2H DPS then DW so think before you roll)
---
Other good items: Strikers Mark (1% hit, 22AP) / Blastershot (1% Crit)
---
Commonly misunderstood items: Band of Accuria (Rag)  --&gt; This ring is better for Tanks / Rouges. Quick Strike / Don Julios are better.
---
Obsidian Edged Blade: DO NOT ROLL ON THIS ITEM. The Unstoppable Force from AV Exalted is better in every way. If you get Exalted AV you'll get Don Julios Band / The Unstoppable Force. I HEAVILY RECOMMEND DOING THIS. Find a premade AV Discord and get to grinding!
---
yeah i can't blame them, it's a shitshow
---
Took a peak... rogues are selling for $400....
---
Join my guild. The raid leads go over each raids logs at the end of the night. The people not trying will be the first to be replaced when we recruit better players.
---
Don't report AFK. Just snowball them back through the portal.
---
Yes. And 2.0 brought about the TBC changes, minus the TBC zones and content. Making it the TBC patch.
---
What the others didn't say is that the main point of hardiness is to become an uninteresting target. A rogue will engage on the non orc if he has the choice. If he doesn't, he might garrote instead of cs. So in addition to all the ones you resist (even when it doesn't matter, fucking frustrating to charge a warrior and he resists), there are all the times where people don't even try to stun you.
---
Reminiscence?
---
At the end of October a female player made a post about sexual harassment going in the guild &lt;Nebula&gt; on Golemagg EU. The server's discord promptly exploded into an absolute shitshow for days. A mod banned the entire guild and many more from the server. Many people harassed the female player and mods for being women, or liars, etc - saying there was no proof, that the mods were being unfair. 
---
It ended with the entire discord being nuked, ownership transferred, and this post:
---
&gt; Ok, so i'm not going to @ everyone because we all know 90% of the number of people in this discord either don't use it or truly don't care what happens. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; As of now i'm the admin of the server due to the recent shitfest that's been happening over the last few days, right now the mod team we have will stand as is.
---
&gt; I won't be making any sudden changes too it as long as if they all do their job. 
---
&gt; I'm not going to dwell on the topic either of whats happened in the last couple of days since everyone knows whats happened and has either memed or gotten their point across
---
&gt; already. It should of been handled a lot better by the mod team, whilst I don't condone them doing the sexual harassment they shouldn't of been banned from this discord at the
---
&gt; end of the day since this discord has nothing to do with their private discord. A simple name and shame should of been fine like people do with ninjas. That being said you guys 
---
&gt; could of handled your points of view better by not hiveminding it. So everyones to blame for it blowing up so majorly. 
---
&gt; Everythings been a bit wishy-washy for the last couple of days because of it with decisions being made and then revoked pretty much in the same train of thought but that's going
---
&gt; to be brought to an end and decisions are going to be final unless the appeal of it is good enough. So with me being made admin we're going to be turning a fresh leaf from today
---
&gt; and everyone is going to move on from the actual shitfest we've experianced. 
---
&gt; One of my last points is going to be about the standard state of the server, this discord should at its core be a place for everyone to come banter with each other, find professions 
---
&gt; and guilds to join. Along with allowing you to flex on whatever guild you've just dropped but at the same time as this the current guild to guild banter isn't really banter anymore
---
&gt; and is bordering on the edge of straight toxicity and at stages crossing into it so i'd like you all to tone it down a touch.
---
&gt; And to end this wall of text half of you didn't read, all of the mod team are open in DMs to any feedback and concerns you have regarding the current state of the server along with
---
&gt; anything you think we could do differently to spice it up.
---
As long as 60% of pvp players are horde servers will never be balanced
---
Some people gotta work. How else they gona stay competitive with the unemployed neck beards?
---
Sulfuras is not PVE but it is PVP and I feel like even if you do not want the inconvenience of unwanted PVP it is not as big of a hindrance. I am on the alliance side and as a new wow guys I find the element adds to the experience and since the BGs the "hindrance" is no longer a big part anymore..  
---
just if you wanted to
---
True you can certainly do all content with that spec i'm just the min/max type when it comes to pve/pvp and not tribute :) 
---
Thats great to be gifting dm loot to guildees I did it for one friend and wish i had more time to help some of the guild
---
gl
---
No.
---
The community isn't happy because AV is in a shit state right now.
---
Everyone knew how the honor system worked long before Classic lauched.
---
There's a ton of things that never made it out of vanilla. Guess what that's why we're playing this shit and not retail. Just because a system didn't make it out of vanilla doesn't make it bad. 
---
You still havn't explained why you think rewarding time investment is bad. Very curious on your thoughts.
---
thats exactly what i started doing LOL

Thinking about transferring from west coast thunderfury to east coast pvp. I'm thinking of going to herod, as horde because in my current server I can't find anyone to do SFK or BFD, its completely dead. Might this be different elsewhere? Im east coast so I thought maybe the timezone is an issue
---
Luckily you can give blizz more money.
---
Except Horde and Ally aren't contending for Ranks. Your only competition is your own faction.
---
Dude... shush! Don't give away this farm spot.
---
So easily. Fairbanks is Dadbanks. Cap right now is only just more than 1 million.
---
Ngl those automated macro's annoy me, one reason I tend to stay clear of more casual guilds, they're so... fake? It's almost like being sarcastically applauded for any minor achi.
---
People underestimate magic resistance potions
---
Outlets for egocentricity have always existed; this is just a new one.
---
I really enjoy streaming because I get to make memories with my friends and have them recorded for future viewing.
---
yet all my guildies share "screenshots" which are actual photos taken with their phone, and I hate it!
---
Enough said
---
&gt; That's the only version that there has always been
---
Not technically true, you used to be able to directly modify the game's models with an MPQ editor. That was never bannable unless you were using it for exploitation purposes.
---
Might be ! Strange choice of a picture nonetheless :D.
---
Probably laughing at you saying that mediocre guilds will just waltz in and clear Naxx first night like it's no big deal.
---
never play with friends. in every game you will find new friends. if friends wana play with you tell them: "hey i play there would be happy if you join" and than really important. Never shedule around them. They can play with you. Never let others dictate your play. Its your free time so use it like that. Its YOUR time. not the time of your friends
---
Aight well I guess it’s just shitty luck lol. Thanks for the info.
---
Remember, if you are going to AFK... get your freaking 15 HKs at least... Also its not hard to play a game and tab back over ever 3-4 minutes and move around...
---
It was ffa up to like cata
---
Greenshot is expensive - I used to have that before. Such a nice software!
---
I literally just started again and I’m a 19 warlock. Was excited for Christmas break since I might find more groups but... I forgot I already bought a 12 day ski resort package in Utah. No WoW for me.
---
Leveling as a 33 year old human male is much more difficult than when I was 18... 😐
---
Where did i say mediocre guilds will clear Naxx?
---
It's because most posts are complaints (which the alliance had way more of during early p2) or fluff (and alliance tend to be more care bear muh nostalgia look at my drawings.)
---
It sucks that your quests npc are safe from the rush, while we lose ours once the horde has infiltrated our base :(
---
No comment. :D
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
Im a gnome. Obviously.
---
Yeah, keep doing it... You will need the gold in the future anyways :)
---
ok, so don't use them... 
---
Or are you a rogue bitching because they cant surprise fuck some random guy out in the world.?

You mean the thing they do every single expansion?
---
Winning more WSGs faster than other premades definitely takes a significant amount of skill, don’t kid yourself.
---
It is quite new, so it hasn't always been in Windows 10.

"In Windows 10 version 1803 build 17661, the new Win + Shift + S keyboard shortcut bring up an area select tool to snip a screenshot and lets you share it instantly from the clipboard."

Projectiles mid air DO NOT break vanish.

I was actually kiting a bot the other day. It was a very short distance though, but I attacked it and started running away and it chased me for maybe 15 seconds until I killed it. It was pretty funny because I am level 60 and the bot was level... 42 I think, and it just came for my throat - no hesitation it just followed me with the clear objective of killing me. Al though some have already replied that it isn't possible to kite a bit to a major city I still want to try and see how far I can kite it (and how much I can mess it up).
---
Just get 6k gold and you should be fine.
---
Ofc you need a lot of free time but no noob was ever rank 14. Why should you let a noob get rank 14 and play with him in your premade?
---
In AV nobody cares, you just need time.
---
I dont know your vanilla guys, but back on my vanilla server all high ranks knew what they were doing in pvp.
---
Let’s be real, true gamers disable their windows key.
---
The wonderful thing about being a healer is number 2 isn't so black and white. 
---
Padme's trousers are amazing but t1 pants are better for trash. Would you force people to bid on the t1 pants despite them being worse on bosses?
---
I think that's the low end. They like to spread out on the map to make it look like they are doing something but it usually ends up being a nightelf shadowmelded behind a tree.
---
Yes, we can only min/max in this game. No room for anything else!
---
Or maybe stop pretending that this 1.12 vanilla re-creation is supposed to be anything but that.
---
I mean it's perfectly fine to tunnel vision to burn drek down and actually should be the norm in premades if they leave one out to cc any incoming mage.
---
Besides gear, as the other person said, normally the smaller runs will be smoother even without the extra speed you'd get from the 15 people.
---
 Nah you can't make excuse about weapon skill in pvp, it's al, ayw considered max.
---
Whats the big deal about being ahead or even same as the rest of the servers? Just enjoy the fkn game with your friends. Do you really think AQ gates will remain close if theres not enough ppl trying to open it?
---
Let's hope that once people see how much honor they need to rank up, they will focus more on rep to get those sweet exalted epics.
---
Any interest in horde TPS tank side project? Leveling an alt currently. No one seems to know what a TPS tank is these days and everyone is following a meta for warriors on horde that somehow pulls less dps than I can pull as tank spec. Never leveled ally, but bis gear is warlord gear and I can't compete with afkers and botters unless I make a pre-made which is not possible without instant ques. I'm not used to horde getting instant ques. How many serious guilds? How fast are Mc clears? How is meta of server for tanking, are tanks super greedy reserving everything but then shit at tanking?
---
I’m so, so sorry.
---
The game used to save screenshots in TIFF format.

#\#NoChanges
---
The consensus was more or less on 1.12 and apparently the devs could only find a 1.12 reference anyway. And here we are, at 1.12 everything.
---
A Druid in my guild (which is a fair balance of semi-hardcore and casual players) was pretty toxic. He always tried to find a way to justify why a piece of loot should go to him over someone else, despit him being, well, a druid; and having a fair chunk of loot already. Eventually he left and we were all happy for it.
---
One of his warrior friends stayed in the guild and would stream our raids, with the druid that left in the chat. He would talk to him the whole raid and shittalk the guild with the druid, and he eventually said "I'm just waiting for BRE to drop, get it handed to me and gquit and join you guys for PVP";"
---
He had VoDs on and one of the officers stumbled on it. Needless to say he got kicked lol.
---
Not the spiciest drama but god damn if that clip wasn't funny.
---
My guild isn't hardcore and loot council works fine for us.
---
The key is that complainers get kicked.
---
It seem like a bit of a straw man fallacy to m8. Do you really think that blizzard designed the ah in a way to make it a time sink? and in this way it is subverting game mechanics? Or to stay on the actual topic. You are implying that blizzard intended the combat logs to be used real time, but just designed them poorly.
---
They still say it, I saw it just yesterday.
---
Snipping tool maybe, this shortcut is a recent windows 10 feature.
---
HILARIOUS
---
I always wonder why people talk about basements. While the most used room for adults living with their mom is either the attic or their old bedroom.
---
Oh yeah, that should help too, good luck dude
---
I do like myself some bored smartass as well.
---
During the wpvp phase we had a couple of rogues who would skulk out of mystic Ward in IF and kill anyone coming in by themselves.  I made a target macro with all their names and a cast hunters mark and pet attack.  Any time they came out of stealth or ressed they were screwed.  Got one of them to @me in the sever discord and flame me in a DM and it was the greatest feeling I've had on classic.
---
Thank you, it's very normal dunno why anyone would claim it's not. Every class should have one.
---
I have yet to see one popular post praising the mechanics of this honor system, only post complaining about it. I'm not going to explain anything to you because you have your kind made up on the situation.
---
I hope all the toxic jerks go play shadowlands.
---
Thank you, I have had people argue with me that AV was always the honor farm bg and it could not be further from the truth. Sounds like a bunch of people who played private servers and try to act like they actually played vanilla back in the day.
---
oh yeah :D
---
Spy is super broken open world which was big for early phase 2.
---
Its still impactful in BGs but not exactly games breaking. I for one am not paying too much mind to the possible random stealthy attack when spy shows 10 other players within 50 yds
---
Nobody with a brain wanted changes either.

Wolf is required in raids.

Enhancement Shaman questions here!

1. Looking for some advice on best DPS weapon to use between Finkle's Lava Dredger and Unstoppable Force.  Finkle's has the higher raw DPS, but is much faster and therefore has lower hits and lower WF's.  Unstoppable on the other hand has lower overall DPS, but has +19str (which comes to 38 attack power) as well as higher damage numbers due to being slower, leading to higher WF hits.  Which should I be using to maximize overall damage in dungeons?
---
2. Right now I have +str enchants on my hat, hands, and legs, since I've been using Finkles until I got Unstoppable Force this morning.  Now that I have a much slower weapon, does it make sense to switch these to the 1% attack speed enchants?
---
Love the attitude. I'm hyped everyday- keep the hype up mate.
---
I suppose the word you used was "decent", which to me implies a level lower than a "good" guild. Either way, that's likely what he's laughing at.
---
yeah...
---
if it seems colossal to you, just let the top 2-3 hardcore guild handle it. they'll take care of it np.
---
11 bosses a week, I go with 15 of each consumable per raid.
---
So 60 of each per month.
---
360 per 6 months.
---
UBRS: 1 hour full clear
---
LBRS: 1.5 hours full clear
---
UD Strat 45 min-1 hour
---
Live Strat 45 min=1 hour
---
BRD 2-3.5 hours full clear, I highly advise against attempting this.  
---
All times are assuming no wipes.
---
Online friends are real friends my dude.
---
Why is Entitled leaving Fairbanks?
---
Holy moly sensitive much? :D :D
---
You will probably be able to find a low-level dungeon group near prime time on Herod, but off hours might be hard. Your best bet is to get into a guild with a lot of folks with a lot of alts.
---
I dont really see the issue here. Your performance doesnt matter in a pug. It's free roll. He decided two rolls for two helms. Perfectly OK to choose to do the rolls that way.
---
Yeah we proably have more afks but the queus are so Quick that it dosent really matter
---
honestly disgusting bull shit
---
nerf mages
---
Y’all just have different opinions on what’s fun. End game raiding is great, but nothing compares to the vanilla leveling experience imo.
---
Don't worry, I have: as soon as it was confirmed that the old system was put in place without a change, I decided that I wasn't worth my time.
---
my friend and I tried to que at the same time to get into AV together, we gave up after four failed ques.
---
Those heal waves are going to PUMP!
---
Bank alts with 14 slot bags. 4x on the character and 3x in the bank.
---
Plus you can mail something to your alt and mail it back to yourself and keep it in your mailbox for 30 days.
---
I agree, congrats and other similar types of macros seem so fake to me. If you really care, you can take the time to reply. But being fake nice bothers me more than people just not saying anything, because it's just all fluff.
---
I’m more inclined to think they’ll sell a little better the first week or two for the lesser guild to use before they get more comfortable. Then it’ll drop off hard as guilds no longer need it as a crutch, so they can save their gold/flasks for AQ
---
That's about the only challenge you'll get in classic.
---
Yea the problem with shit guilds is that the players just genuinely don't care.. it's not that they are inexperience or don't have the time to go hard core it's that they don't care enough to actually improve their play.
---
Stop telling people what to post!
---
Yep Guild roster management. It's a godsend addon.   We spam grats to everyone who levels.
---
&gt; literally anyone, any spec, could achieve that.
---
I don't think you understand how an MMR system works. 
---
&gt; All it took was some skill.
---
Ok now you've contradicted yourself and I really have no idea where you're going with this. 
---
Just because 2 incredibly skilled players can play prot paladin + feral druid to 1850 doesn't mean the system is rewarding skill properly when those same 2 players could take druid warrior to 2200.
---
On the flip side there are players who are skilled enough to get to 1850 with an ideal comp but will never get there because they picked the wrong classes or specs. 
---
To be clear, I like the TBC system more than vanilla, but that doesn't mean it did a good job at rewarding player skill. MMO's by their nature are not good at that. 
---
I will say this as well: The honor system in Vanilla doesn't actually award you based on the time you invest. Everything in it is player imposed. If you got everyone on your server to agree to cap their honor at 50k you could have countless rank 14 for people who play handful of hours a week. It's literally just awarding the top .3 percent regardless of how much time it actually took to become the top .3 percent.
---
The issues described here are self imposed by the community. There's nothing stoping people from working together on each server to cap honor at a reasonable level.
---
People WANT to invest more time because they WANT that status. There's nothing wrong the players deciding where the line is.
---
Wouldn't some kind of dungeon be better?
---
already started lvlin one a bit, y not? the best racial for the class + having paladins on my side
---
Happened to me too, just merge and call it quits.
---
You won’t need any FR at all for bwl. You’ll need ony scale cloaks and melee occasionally runs a little FR on fire naw because a small amount allows you to stay in longer to dps before having to dip out and let your stacks fall off. But it’s hardly a requirement and only personal preference.
---
Everything. Trolls, wolves, owlbeasts, anything in their path really.
---
They think the faction imbalance is too severe and only going to get worse. Apparently they’re also worried about horde guilds being toxic and will prevent alliance from doing anything during AQ. I don’t agree with why they’re leaving but it is what it is
---
I would only be impressed if the R14 dude was named Poopsock
---
With server transfer every character gets a free name change so no one would know about about it. Gj Blizzard
---
I see a newbie guild
---
You run over the mountain west of Ironforge, not through the path to the east. That way you zone into the very western part of wetlands and when you ress it will be at menethil.
---
Tbf few rewards in any mmo's are really skill based.  It'd be nice if it were something other than professional afking though.
---
Luci resists shadow bolt for me way more than any other boss in MC. Second would be Gole. Both partial and full resists about 50% of my casts. 
---
Shazz the only problem I ever encounter is purge not happening quickly (dampen magic 50%).
---
same
---
Maybe you should re q.
---
Id say fuck those friends and just play on earthshaker. Save yourself the headache.
---
Ive ranked to 11 on 2 private servers previously, i have a pretty good understandinh of the system. I think you misunderstood my comment, im not comparing my honor to alliance. Every horde has the same long queue and the hordes that lose in 7 min Gets way less honor then my 20 min win since they spend that time in queue. Where did i type «more then alliance»??
---
With proper resistance and pet control your pet can love through most MC fights, especially one you get giantstalker 5 piece bonus.
---
Looks like a spirit healer
---
accuria is like one of the top 3 rings til naxx
---
I leveled 40 levels on a character and they didn't even let me know that they were rolling on a different server, due to queues mind you even though EVERY server had queues, until about 3 - 4 days had passed. They fucked up on that part.  
---
Secondly, have you seen the state of Flamelash? It's basically a PvE server with NO way of getting AQ gates open without people making brand new accounts and funneling mats through the neutral AH. That is not a server with a future.  
---
I literally got fucked over twice, and now you're actively trying to state that it's my fault that I'm getting fucked over, despite bending over literally backwards to cater to them at every turn.
---
&gt; I have yet to see one popular post praising the mechanics of this honor system
---
Should I link you the millions of threads over the years asking for Classic WoW?
---
Or should I link you the petition that nearly a million people signed for this game?
---
Don’t get tricked by the Reddit vocal minority my man, everyone knew what they were getting with this system.
---
Haha, earthshaker EU? A certain warrior lootwhore perhaps?
---
My guild is too, we've got about 10-15 who are solid and semi-hardcore, and I'm def one of them, and I really strive to push people harder.
---
But I will not begrudge someone not getting Tribute buffs, that's a bit much even for me, and I would gladly do it to push times. All I expect are consumables and a willingness to listen and learn. Also come to raid in level 60 blues for most of your gear, if you're in greens or level 40 stuff you better be killin it on the meters or I'm gonna be salty.
---
What do you mean by finishing Mc loot? We have downed it for most of these 14 weeks a'd we are far from being done with it. Real far.
---
He has pretty high armor and Defense too. I play fury warrior and Goly is significantly less dps. Lower numbers and fewer crits. Kinda makes sense, I guess, since he has no real mechanics or dangerous abilities other than the dogs, but they’re easily dealt with.
---
If you are having your priests roll on all upgrades like Talisman of Empherial power / necklace then your guild is truly shit. A competent player knows to pass on stuff others can use more.
---
Just a smol zerg
---
.. Yes, that's the thing with how AQ gates open, both sides need to reach a certain quota.  
---
Since Flamelash is a PvE server now with no active Alliance, you'd be looking at atleast several months if not up to half a year before they'd get it open.  
---
Farming BWL for half a year just because the  server is dead isn't anyones idea of an enjoyable time.
---
there was a queue on fairbanks last night... what.
---
I'm a GM and yeah it's really easy for this situation to develop.  It's starting to bubble up in my guild too now that we've had to replace two of the officers (including raid lead) with guys who are more on the hardcore side.  The only way to get around it is with really clear and consistent expectations communicated from the start about what the guild is, and constantly watching for it to nip it in the bud.
---
I wish I could.
---
3 times I've gone on vacation and come back to... everybody has left the guild.
---
I like this response
---
Someone else said yes, but I'm fairly certain that mages will always have warlocks on sustained DPS. Warlocks can put up bigger numbers theoretically in the space of a minute but across a whole boss fight in phase 5 and 6, mages should still have us.
---
queue's don't have anything to do with your server...
---
WSG bracers are not in the game yet. Think they release with phase 3 content (same with Don Rodrigo Band).
---
Thats actually the problem....
---
You cant use taunt to trade you have to up the TPS gen and that maybe hard due to ego and folks not understanding that. 
---
BTW 45 secs MT dies and OT needs to have agro before the MT blowing up. 🤣
---
I just left the guys I know behind except one. They play hours that just don't work for me, or would prefer to dick around on retail now that the new xpac has been announced. 
---
I personally am not going back to retail. If classic dies, which I doubt, I *die* with it.
---
Imagine naming your guild Cringe.
---
Why would you be on a PvP server that's basically forced into being a PvE server that likely won't get AQ gates open within half a year where more and more Horde are either transferring off or just not playing anymore?  
---
I'd rather take advantage of the free transfer, which we did, instead of waiting for the server to be completely dead before paying to transfer off.
---
Are servers not part of battle groups?
---
Of course it matters, it should't influence someone getting loot over someone else. However there was no reason to do 2 rolls for one item. I've never seen a group do that before, it was not accounced before, and he literally saw me celebrating in chat then made the decision to ask us to roll again.
---
Well I feel ya. I will say this.
---
Try and come to the point where you accept that you've done your best, and sadly, your friends and acting that friend like.
---
If you really wanna see who actually gives a fuck, share this link to your discord/ group chat, so they get a sense of what ur feeling like. Sure, it might seem a little bitch boy at first glance, but in all honesty I have found brutal honesty the best practice in weeding out the fair weather friends from the true friends.
---
Cheers man, might be time to just chill with some new people on a server ur digging. It's at that point where your friends should return the favor and make a little effort to keep the circle together.
---
Either way, accept the outcome cause you can't control other people's actions, just learn from them and adjust accordingly.
---
Merry Christmas
---
I was Just poing fun at you. I think it is working fairely strait foward. You get assinged à number in queu and then once you get to the top you get the queu. There is probably some kind of variable that trys to combat too meny People from the same server to get into the same AV. But honestly  I is probably down to the Sheer volume of horde queuing at the same time that separates you from your friends.
---
Try and queu at a low trafic time, such as 5-6 am serveur time, and see if it is easyer to get into the same AV.
---
when they launched BG's they said the full phase 3 content will come early January. Might be not early, but January i think it's pretty much confirmed. 
---
You should be a bit more polite though, i know it's easier to insult people than use goodle, but still...
---
Very true!
---
Sorry, yes I meant resilience.  Resilience marked the end of taking your hard earned PVE gear in and wrecking some people in pvp :/
---
Yup, this has happened to me as well. I even sat there was like "uhhh, that wasn't supposed to happen but I'll take it!" lol
---
Are servers not part of battlegroups?...
---
I remember those nerfs, but they didn't phase my Shammy in the least, as he STILL bowled through alliance and insta-killed clothies.  Your hyperbole is noted, but did not match my experience after the nerfs, as I got to lvl 60 pretty late in vanilla and it was far from mediocre.
---
Is there any official info that says it will stay for half a year?
---
Would resist potions mitigate anywhere close to what 2 greater fire protection pots can?
---
I think the issue is that the other top two rings are already out (Quick Strike and Don Julio's) so there's no longer any need for Accuria as a fury warrior.
---
But that’s all irrelevant because wow classic is a good game and diablo 3 is a piece of shit without equal.
---
Why would you pom flamestrike over casting it normally?
---
Arena rewards were for sure skill based
---
Don't bring a wolf if your warriors are somewhat competitive by using world buffs and consumables. The howl can knock off important buffs.
---
Awesome! On my way to help! Haha
---
Because I basically got yelled at for fucking months to play with them before launch happened, now I was actively trying to play with them and all I got was basically getting fucked over and a bunch of stress.
---
The bug thing. Not sure where that came from, nothing of the sort ever reported.
---
2 is essentially a loot council with a lot of extra steps.
---
Just use the all in DKP method or w/e.  So you that any item you get costs everything you have kinda had to horde it then, but possible I guess.
---
So how did you get unbanned.
---
which server is this? ...
---
for science
---
Be dwarf or gnome. Do the wetlands skip, take boat. Jump off boat after loading screen and swim there.
---
No doubt, but I’ve been finding it harder to itemize for giantstalker as time has gone on. SGC, Wristguards of Trueflight, crown/Dragonstalker helm, and Dragonstalker pants give essential crit and hit rating. 
---
The fights don’t last much longer than a minute anyways, so even if you’re being totally lazy you can get 50% uptime on your pets
---
Socials?
---
I swear I see more Sulfuras than BRE nowadays :p
---
They charge the furthest target. by stacking, you remove that ability.
---
As alliance I can confirm that even with just three people it sometimes takes 3-4 tries to get the same game to pop.  However as alliance it takes under a minute to try four times until it works.  I suspect the odds of getting into a game are just as unreliable if not more so on horde with more people queing.  This means I'd guess 5-6 tries and with a que time this becomes unreasonable to attempt and rely on.
---
For PvE it is very minor. Almost negligible.
---
Hence why i'm never pugging Ony again. It was a 23man Ony pug and cost me a tonne, only a few others bothered with consumables. Again, I don't mind not getting loot despite having a good performance, what I do care about is the raid leader saw the roll, could see people celebrating in chat, and made the decision to force another roll for no reason, despite it never being announced as a rule before hand. He also knew I was there from the start and the effort put in, I was in that group for about 3 hours. Just a dick move imo
---
u better calm down b4 they block reddit from your workstation lulz.
---
thx
---
Rerolled twice, made hunter main. Level 59.8, guild I've been in since launch breaks up. Guildless 60 ding. No grats. Forever alone.
---
&gt;  It was AV exactly as it is now 
---
AV games used to literally last 20+ hours *regularly*. You could almost-always log off in the middle of an AV, go to school, come home, and rejoin the same game.
---
Agreed. AFKers I can fuck with via snowballs. That's at least amusing. Being griefed by some premade assholes is garbage.
---
I don't understand why it's common that guild helps with ingots as well.
---
since ingots can be sold to buy useful things, you're essentially saying that his vanity craft is more important than stockpiling flasks/consumables for the future, or crafting weps that being actual raid utility (annihilator etc.)
---
Accurate for competent/guild groups, overly optimistic for pugs, even without wipes.
---
Hell even LFR is on par and some harder than a lot of classic content. So you still wouldn’t be wrong in most cases.
---
Yeah, Striker's Mark is BiS for fury and Blastershot is a top tier PvP or Arms weapon.
---
I feel like 99% of mages can be run with a simple macro. Frost nova &gt; CoC  &gt; arcane explosion x3 &gt; ice block, repeat
---
2x greater arcane resist potions my man... shazz is just free rage for warriors
---
The dot usually falls off. I’ve only had it go past 5 stacks once
---
LoS is barely functional, wall has to be really huge to work lmao but sometimes a skinny tree also works. who the hell knows.
---
This honestly functions about as well as some janky private servers i played back in the day
---
I also had problems getting the old irl crew on the same realm, but not as bad as you describe, but it also kind of fell apart. 
---
I decided to reroll on a realm where i have just one friend that plays, and honestly he burned himself out by going super hard for the first few months, so now he never logs on. And its funny, it seems like i enjoy the game more when i just play it for myself, and to my own schedule. I definitely enjoy it so far. Maybe thats what you should go for
---
To a degree, but it still mostly came down to who was willing to minmax their character  and team the most and play until their eyes bled.
---
Downloading porn isn't a technical issue. You are soooo defensive lol and then just keep trying to tell me how im mad and bitter lololololololol lmao so funny
---
I played Vanilla WoW and pursued PvP ranks during summer break. I was literally only playing WoW and mostly doing PvP, including a lot of premade BGs with some of the top people on our server.
---
I made it to Rank 9 then stopped because school was starting.
---
Mathematically, I believe the way it works is for you to even get Rank 10, you have be among the top 7% of honor grinders every week for 10 weeks. 
---
If you are employed, this is not going to happen.
---
get gud or gO bAcK tO reTaiL! =p
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ecgbh3/ten_storms_raid_night_was_ruined_by_a_rogue
---
Here's another post on it
---
There is a generic macro to cast then cancel ice block with same key. I use that one and it saves a key bind.
---
There was a blue post addressing exactly this. Wsg gear was added later.
---
u/Stridez_21 posted this and other rogues I've talked to have confirmed as well :
---
&gt;You can have a 1-400ms window to vanish a successful cast if that cast is not an instant damage(spells like frostbolt, shadow bolt that act like missiles). On something like a polymorph the window is limited to the batching update window but is very quickly closed. People were telling me the batching update is something like 200ms. Take that with a grain of salt, but figured I’d just share my initial findings thru inquiry. 
---
A couple rogues in my guild have said that vanishing through a successful cast like FB has caused them to "dodge" and not take any damage. 
---
TL;DR rogues are bugged LOL
---
Well yeah no shit if something is better for another class you leave it but sounds like you arent bidding on anything at all.
---
NA has discord.gg/avpremade. I'm not NA but it looks open to everyone.
---
On EU I only know closed ones, you need to get there through your server representative.
---
They are uninformed. It's easy enough for a people to coordinate war effort materials to be sent to alliance via the neutral AH and turn them in.
---
ssssshhhhhhh
---
&gt; How did your guild let you tank as shaman? I’m guessing off tank as well?
---
It quite easy to float the idea by when the game is 15 years old and there's no new content or any challenge.
---
You can also destroy your Hearthstone (not a problem since the revelers are in inns anyway) and use the stuck option.
---
This only works with auto attacks, but yea it ignores LoS. No idea if it existed in Vanilla, but its been a trick for as long as I can remember
---
Pretty sure that is wrong. Just need to change his region and can create on an existing account.
---
Unless you’re like me who doesn’t give a shit about rank and just wants to play to have fun.
---
You realize its being posted to get blizzard to fix it right?
---
This is vastly exaggerated misinformation.  The population loss was from FoTM players, Twitch streamer syndrome and the family/adulting people who came back for nostalgia.
---
Sure, a few may have left solely due to your reason, but there are a lot of players that exist outside of PvP realms and even PvP activity.
---
Benediction has strong faction balance and healthy server. Come play
---
Haha yeah, the mailbox abuse is quite funny. My bank alt has literally nothing in the actual Bank, it's all stored as uncollected mail.
---
A good tip for Hunters: Send your bank alt several mails full of ammo and then return them. Then it doesn't matter if the town you're in sells Arrows/Bullets or not. Just grab a fresh set from your mailbox.
---
8===D (_o_);_;)
---
You obviously have some issues to work through.
---
I wish you the best moving forward and I hope you are able to come to terms with the reality of the situation you've found yourself in.
---
\^ don't forget movement speed starting at 20/21 and the ability to kill multiple things at once w/ bleeds and bear.
---
Well the holidays always suck for raid teams.
---
OEB is better in PVE for for humans even though they get mace skill from their racial. It's much better than TUF for every other race in the game. TUF is debatably better for pvp but some people prefer oeb for sword spec. If you join a pub and leave with an OEB you did extremely well for yourself. OEB does about 10% more damage to bosses than unstoppable Force for non-humans.
---
I guess you should add that to your misunderstood items list.
---
I Mean, AV was literally the reason why they added the report afk feature.
---
No kidding. Raising the armor was clearly to combat the increased damage we got from 1.12 talents and gear. This is one reason why Classic feels so easy compared to vanilla. 
---
Nostalrius also surely raised npc damage though. Having played AV a LOT, over there even regular bowman would chunk down your HP, you could not survive solo runs through chokepoints when towers were up. The guards too have HP more comparable to critters too, its rediculous
---
Guarantee this is Firemaw.
---
If you're not already speed running rag you're not gonna HS queue, it's so much more micromanagement than anyone but the very tip top of fury warriors will do
---
Yeah, the "1.12 experience" is...selective. The phasing system is more of a rough approximation of classic than a "no changes" strategy. For the most part, it's okay, but pretending it's perfectly accurate is silly.
---
15 minutes? Its about 4 for me in AV. Just the perfect amt of time to fap in between matches!
---
Classic raiding is honestly a joke in terms of difficulty.  The only aspect I believe retail to be superior at is raid boss fight mechanics and overall challenge.
---
You're not capping energy anyway except once per boss fight and occasional trash pull that isnt chained. 5 dagger skill equates to 2 % hit + 1 % due to delta skill-defense not being more than 10 ( usually 15 ) and glancing blow reduction. No brainer
---
First guild was just sort of a leveling guild, not much going on, but someone was putting racist words in the notes of every guild member.  Yeah, no thanks, I bounced quickly.  I haven't seen a member of this guild on server in ages so assume they either finally got banned or just disbanded. 
---
Second one every 60 would leave after a few days realizing no one else was ready to raid, there was no discord, and no plan, creating a constant funnel of 60s leaving with no effort from leadership to stop the bleeding.  I do occasionally see a member around, not many though, and some have raid gear.  Almost certain they must be just pugging it. 
---
Ran with third for quite some time, but the GMs were raid loggers and attrition slowly took its toll.  In-game guild drama wasn't dealt with.  They used LC but there was not nearly enough effort to track/prio gear for most classes.  RL took an item that should've really gone to someone else and that seemed to be the straw that broke the camel's back, and caused a decent chunk of core raid to gquit.   I finally had enough when the RL/co-GM got shitty with me over trying to get them to deal with some guild drama going on while they were playing another game as usual.  You'd think it would be taken more seriously right after we lost a bunch of people, but nope, other game more important and it wasn't the designated 3 hours a week they play Classic, so it can wait or be ignored I guess.  It was very unfortunate because the guild had been a solid 10/10 for several months in a row.
---
Impossible to get past R10 doing that
---
The best choice for shaman is 39er ! You got wolf form, and ppl dont have mount.
---
you also can play with jordan staff with an elemental/enhancement build.
---
Name and shame.
---
Eh excuse me!? He is providing us free content (i choose to donate $400 a month, to help the stream community out), and made a simple mistake. Besides if you join a streamers AV you should help them out and listen to their stream. Thats the least you can do for the free content. Jeez
---
Yeah, especially on a work night. We have a mix of EST and PST people, so we have a pretty narrow time slot between when the PST people get home from work and when the EST people need to get to bed. If we do DMN buffs, it has to be the EST people doing it every time.
---
After 40 enhance is kinda shit, you have no way to do more than 1 mob at a time. Ele is faster at killing but requires pretty consistent drinking and still is not good at killing more than 1 target at a time compared to most classes. Rogues have less downtime than either shaman spec because you take way less damage than enhance and recovering HP with a bandage takes much less than drinking to full. It’s also easier to reset if things go wrong.
---
If you're alliance, no. If you're horde, definitely yes.
---
He has ~3700 armor same as all the other bosses minus Sulfuron.
---
You can stock pile the mats for blasted lands buff. You can only have 1 at a time but I usually get it 5 min or so before the head buff drops. I pop the 1st one then get à second that sits in my inventory then I hs to sw and log out till ony head. Depending on how long you take to get to MC you have about 35 min left on the buff.
---
Faster burst.  There's nothing else to really PoM in that scenario.
---
This. Nobody asked for this. 
---
And the "can only find source for 1.12" is also kind of BS when retail has a version closer to the original, and both versions are running on the same software anyhow. Blizzard screwed up, plain and simple.
---
oh hey I am EU, how do I even go about finding this information out?   my server has 1 guild doing 1 premade that I can't get into, unless they're short of players.   Currently r8 and hitting a wall, as playing solo is not working out as you can imagine. thanks
---
"don't do this encouraging/social thing that every guild in every mmorpg does"
---
Lmao great attitude. If the tank is moving the mobs there is a reason and the onus is on you to react accordingly.
---
So, neckbeards were using it to kick people who were actually doing the content ( quests, back capping, defending )  
---
So Bliz disabled it, thus the neckbeards who used to rage about the game taking longer because people want to ENJOY the games...are now afking.
---
Alliance has people who think winning and losing is determined by whether or not you kill Galv(specifically hey claim that killing Galv makes you lose.). So yeah there is a lot of ignorance on both sides.
---
Telling them it is because they don’t defend graveyards or react to what the other side is actually doing somehow doesn’t compute.  Good luck educating those that think arguments are decided by who uses caps lock and spams their response the most times.
---
And I am sure Reddit is the perfect spot for such a bug to be reported.
---
Never mind the official forums, or their own support system.
---
idk how people choose deviate delight over grob. it seems like grob, just....low pop. and worse in every way.
---
Next offense be a ban
---
You'd be surprised what you find out in the wild. I've been able to fend off rogues and warriors as a holy priest with like 80 spell power lol. Other times those classes won't even let me heal myself lol.
---
I feel like I lucked out by finding a guild with a pretty great loot system. They’ve got a spreadsheet of every item in MC/Ony and each item has a class/role priority. So say a warrior T1 piece drops, they’ll go “okay, tanks roll if you don’t have it.” And the tanks roll and winner takes it. But if all the tanks have it, then the rolls goes to dps warriors for off spec. It’s nice because you can look at the spreadsheet on disc and know going in what drops you’re eligible for, and officers in your class/role will roll same as you, so there’s no favoritism. I like it since even when you lose a roll, you know it’s one less person to roll against next time you see it, and if you stick with it long enough, you can eventually have a shot at some off-spec stuff once the mains have it. There’s a weighted roll system too that gives you a bonus on roll each time you lose one and resets on a win, so it helps smooth out unlucky runs and break droughts.
---
SM cath. Turn all the silk cloth into bandages for increased profits. It is near steady 40g an hour, and if you get lucky with drops (Beguliler Robes have dropped three times, along with one Fiery War axe and twink shoulder pads) you can average higher.
---
My guild just exploded last night. So that's cool.
---
Cat form 30% speed boost at 20/21 talents too
---
Came here to say either just run dungeons, or get that herb for mara stealth runs xD
---
I gkicked a few clickers during MC yesterday. I do not need noobs on my team.
---
So is your faction, bud.  That’s why we out populate you, especially in PvP.
---
No it wouldn't.  Because even 20 hour games would result in more honor than WSG matches for bots.  A bot leeches off others.  1 vs 39 or 1 vs 9, there is a huge gap in amount of damage, healing, and activity that can be done.  Bots won't play WSG, it's not feasible.  Losing 1 man in WSG in a tight game is a loss, period.  Losing 1 man in an AV doesn't really matter all that much.
---
Honestly, creating longer games would make botting worse.  As more active players swap to WSG, the percentage of bots goes up significantly and soon you have games with 10 bots sitting in the cave.
---
That would absolutely ruin pvp. Have 5 people report a competitor as afk. Boom, out of contention for that week, even if he was just getting some water for a minute.
---
Tbh, tapping lock playstyle sounds uncomfortable to get used to, but i've only ever played lock a long time ago.
---
Account sharers and win traders will beat both. 
---
Which sucks, don't get me wrong, but R14 is not something you get by being good.
---
Will the horde side jumps in WSG ever be fixed? There are many spots that pets can’t get to
---
12 resets now  I think?  0 bindings.
---
dude it's their choice, why does it bother you so much? Let people play how they like
---
OP could tape the sheet onto his monitor, then take a pic of that. Pretty much a screenshot
---
so my problem is finding out who that person would be, as on my EU server there is only one guild running a premade all day and that is the only one.
---
I think I paid 35g for mine. Some perks to big servers.
---
OP is clearly upset because his friend group is making decisions without him and expect him to follow, but they shit on the sensible decisions OP tried to provide upon request. It isn't a difficult situation to understand.
---
Windfury does indeed work, and it is broken as all hell.
---
Ive never understood folks that enjoy drama.  I for reals, just dont get it.  
---
Like the folks that watch the Housewives of Orange County or equivalent.  Drama for entertainment?  /blowmyfckingbrainsout.
---
&gt;You blindly assume that just because you want the old AV, so does everyone else
---
sounds familiar
---
Weapons: Eskhandar's Right Claw, Brutality Blade (BiS), Gutgore Ripper (pair with Aged Core Leather Gloves, Distracting Dagger, or Mugger's Belt for +5 Dagger skill). For ranged: Striker's Mark (BiS), or Blastershot Launcher (BiS if hit capped) \[2h Fury: Obsidian Edged Blade and Earthshaker; OEB is better and more common\]
---
Accessories: Quick Strike Ring (technical BiS; Accuria and Don Julio's are better)
---
Armor: Bracers of Stability (BiS), Flameguard Gauntlets (BiS over Devilsaur, but requires specific pairings/stats), Aged Core Leather Gloves (if using daggers)
---
If not counting the last 2 bosses, it's not a lot of straightforward BiS items. The main thing MC's earlier bosses enable are options, but primarily for swaps in PvP and tanking. A lot of items are off the table, though, such as Core Hound Tooth, Bracers of Swift Flight (good alternative), Perdition's Blade (if daggers/prio to rogues), Onslaught Girdle (BiS until Naxx), Bonereaver's Edge (BiS 2h Fury), Spinal Reaper (great weapon), Band of Accuria (BiS, but priority to tanks and agi usually), and both capes (neither are BiS, but I have trash luck with capes and they're both upgrades for me. lol)
---
Maybe because shimmering flats does not have a shoreline so if you drown next to it it will ress you by the zone with the closest shoreline? Tanaris or dustwallow marsh?
---
How does Bonecrusher compare with The Unstoppable Force?
---
Mains get pieces over alts.  Having said that, we are starting to have a few classes geared out except for weapons.  Most players don't want to bring alts in yet, just in case.  Boss kills matter in our loot system, so skipping bosses means you fall down the loot list.
---
Dude. Alt+prntscrn just changed me. I have been batch cropping my duel monitor screens hots for years...
---
I mean you can always let your other raiders get the guaranteed loot like tier first then get it cheap later on. This is the point. As a priest I dont really need many upgrades to function until AQ because you should always prioritise dps
---
i am a r8 healer, so I know there are groups out there that need me. I just don't have the right connections at the moment it seems
---
Eh, meanwhile as a warrior, even 1 guy looks at me and I know i'm done for. Balance is great with this game.
---
idk if the guy you orignally responded to is a gimmick acount or what, but there's some really really strange "i subconsciously feel inferior to people in IT so i need to put myself above them whenever i can" kinda vibes coming from him.   
---
maybe one of the weirder posts ive seen in recent memory.
---
All of this information is easily researchable on warcraftlogs and this may be abrasive but I suspect if you had a snowball's chance in hell of coming anywhere near rank 14 you'd be aware of these sorts of things. There are 4 horde guilds clearing MC in \~45-60 minutes and the best time on the realm is 38 minutes at the moment.
---
There are dozens and dozens of BiS geared (or close to it) warriors who have been living in AV for 12-18 hours a day since release, and farming wPVP everyday for the same amount of time when honor went live, along with every other class/player chasing rank, and the majority of the serious ones are working together collectively, so....good luck.
---
All that said, you can easily find a raid spot as a warrior and I hear Fury has spots on their their 17th team.
---
Wow disgusting. What is your job title young man?
---
Are you me? I would also like to know what advice others have.
---
&gt;Common sense would suggest that the one with the most queue time always enters AV first
---
indeed.
---
my guess is blizzard added a small RNG element to that timestamp specifically to avoid premade like this.
---
it would make sense considering blizzard removed the ability to queue for AV as a 40-man group and likely didn't want people to bypass their nerf with such a easy gimmick as queue'ing together.
---
wait wat? no don rodrigo, no bracers? big oof
---
Allright, ill check it out. Thanks:)
---
When TBC comes out and season1 is WLD’s wilin out with stormheralds I hope you remember this post
---
Or season5 and warr/DK/pala stomping u into the ground sub 60s
---
Get to exalted with AV.  
---
Finish leveling your herbalism.  
---
Farm demons in Azshara while herbing. Once you hit 640g, you can purchase the ram.
---
What Hunter pet do you guys think is the best for 29 twink PVP?
---
Boar
---
* only gap closer (Charge) at this level
---
* only pet with some form of CC (1 sec root)
---
* lower damage
---
Cat
---
* highest damage
---
* most spell pushback (1.20 attack speed)
---
* no Dash, may be hard to have high uptime
---
Wind Serpent
---
* high damage
---
* Lightning Breath means likely higher uptime than Cat
---
Yea were both preraid bis and my buddy just got the death bringer from ony last week so he's rocking some solid dps. I just didn't want to drag him out there to just get face rolled lol. Thanks the advice guys
---
You were me last night. I flew to AB in actual Arathi and walked into the instance bc I couldn't queue up in Org. "You must be a member of the Horde or 20 to enter" was roughly the error I got when I tried to walk into the portal.
---
I asked in /g and was told AB is P3.
---
Yuuup - the mobs have almost half the health of a normal dust stormer with the same drop rate. Crazy huh? On my server you just made 110g/h
---
I had a guy in my guild say how people were being asses to him in AV cus he was AFKing trying to gain mass sympathy, and everyone was like "lul no."
---
wow... i had 600k and i was in the low 300's. 
---
Our top had over 1.1mil
---
They're MCing it so the Org guards attack and kill it.  Killing it is the goal, MCing is just the method.  A couple of alliance rogues could come in and achieve the same thing by just bursting him down.
---
If you are a tank, save up for a Foror's, if you are tank and engineer, save up for Force Reactive Disk
---
If you are non-orc, non-human DPS, I'd say Edgemasters would probably be good,
---
Soulbag. Always wanted one, but never wanted to spend the gold. It's the perfect gift: something someone wouldnt buy themselves but would definitely use.
---
Simple Mis-read of the question.
---
Yeah, regardless of version, AV was the easiest BG to get exalted in. There's no need to sprint through it. You'll get it pretty quick anyways. 
---
WSG is the slow one.
---
Trinket with - 20 resistances to enemy gonna worth it later,  since no warlock curse for shamans,  and there is more gear like that later
---
Well you are a pretty toxic player if you get angry at that.
---
&gt; I didn't know about this [Alliance] one
---
Cant use it if you dont know it. Now you do.
---
A DPS turned up and coming Raid tank said “goodbye” in the discord then left everything and put all the officers on ignore both in discord and in game. We speculate it was because he wasn’t a great tank and didn’t respond very well to criticism or advice, he also wanted to roll need on loot for his alts and got butthurt when he was told he shouldn’t do that
---
How are your weapons looking? After LHH its mostly just fluff gear. Bds set is an upgrade for most but its a small upgrade and gets beat by pvp gear and its expensive. If ur guild is missing an annihilator (or only has one)thats what i would focus on as its a big increase for the whole raid. Beyond that save arcanite for a legendary if there is any chance u could get one.
---
Is there a 'newb' friendly semi-casual guild on Skullflame\[EU\] looking for players?
---
I have got 2 toons to level 30 playing solo - but feel I am really missing the social aspect of the game. 
---
I did play Vanilla but never raided or anything - would love to eventually though!
---
I agree with your premise. The honor system is basically the competitive side to time investment. 
---
Why is it bad design though and what's wrong with having pvp be the competitive time investment reward and letting everything else be the slow grind that you can complete however fast you want.
---
To be clear, it's not like there are no rewards if you can't make it to the top as well. There is a progressive reward structure that everyone can benefit from with the very best rewards being gated at the top of the system. 
---
The system is also entirely community driven. There's literally nothing stopping the community of the server from coming together and agreeing to cap honor at a reasonable level.
---
To be honest, I was a little shocked the first time doing Ony in Classic. I thought my memory might be hazy, but I remembered TONS of whelps in Vanilla. So much so that our guild had like 4 mages dedicated to handling whelps and no one tanking them because of the damage they did to the tanks. Maybe it was just bugged in Classic?
---
Enchants. You can start with the helm since dps warriors don't replace it (afaik). Beyond that I'd look at what gear pieces you have that will last you the longest,  and enchant those up. Past even that you could look to stacking up consumables for raid weeks to come, stacking flask for bwl eventually, or even trying to get tank gear and quel'serrar. 
---
This is all from a non warriors POV, so there could be many more things to look into!
---
they went to deviate delight server that is 65% alliance and rppvp lol
---
Tldr busy farming honor
---
As a Tauren I need to stand about 20 yards from Drek's wall to avoid getting killed by alliance on the other side.
---
WTB more deviate delights.
---
Depends on your class though, rogues and warriors don't get better weapons before kelthuzad
---
What happened?
---
There were plenty of keyboard turning R14s back in the day. I personally knew a grandma that could hardly play the game that was R14 because she had nothing better to do. Classic PvP honor grind is 95% time, 5% skill.
---
There's a new TBC private server launching in Feb. Should be a good time for a while at least.
---
So I'm sure someone else has pointed it out but those don't really sound like friends. They sound like acquaintances that you sort of know. I started with like 15 or so acquaintances/friends and the queues pushed 3/4 of us to one of the newer servers and I begrudgingly followed because my main goal was to play with them regardless of server size, server type, A:H balance, guilds, etc. I helped with lower level elite quests, babysat the lower chars getting camped in STV, ran some through dungeons I could help with, I helped fund like 12 total level 40 mounts pre 60 and will never see a return on that because a lot of those guys are gone. I've helped fund, like 2-300g each, 3 epic mounts for friends and won't see my own for another few weeks probably since they have all kind of slowed down the pace recently. I couldn't be happier with how it turned out because that was my goal, to do fun stuff with my friends.
---
I'd say just recognize that your priority isn't to play with your friends and move on. You will be a lot happier.
---
Thatsthejoke.jpeg
---
That was one item I noticed
---
*takes three steps into an inn*
---
Ok, we're good now.
---
No but 6% is super easy to get without taking a ring you will replace when your gear/tank is good enough that you will be HS queueing.
---
Should be fine, might need to bring manay waters and foods. Probably will find 1 after 3 or 4 hours of grinding. But its all rng. Could be fast, could be looonnnnnggggg. Good luck out there
---
That seems to be the experience of some people. Not really sure what the difference was. I have good situational awareness and didn’t hang out any one place too long, or anywhere that seemed to have a lot of bored hordes around. Some of it was spent grinding meaningless mobs, but I’m a hunter and that’s easy to do in far corners.
---
You don’t actually cancel heroic strike. It’s just not necessary after a certain level of gear/buffs, you can keep it qued most or all of the fight and just let it go off.
---
The biggest issue is threat
---
&gt;Actually. Technically on average you have 16% miss. 
---
ACKSHUALLY, I'm assuming he's consulting logs to see what he hits on bosses.
---
Overall across everything, he's at 16% miss though.
---
TBH AV is skewed, as in 1.12 they changed the stats on the AV npc's to make them so much easier. (Hence our problem right now), whereas previously weren't so easy to zerg down. Even on private servers, not so easy to zerg down. Warmasters would literally 1-shot a T2 tank if not a T3 tank.
---
ok, bye !
---
Just popping in here: how much gph would usually make on that?
---
I didnt. Somehow *you* are ignoring the part where i say that you do not get full honor for kills as it always seems to be split, with the usual "high" amount being roughly 50 on the first kill and you hit dr's quickly.  
---
Like
---
They moved it up from P5 then...
---
I think it's definitely a preference thing.  I really like the charge but the attack speed cats are definitely good against some casters.
---
The only fights that my pet ever dies on now that I know what I'm doing are lucifron, shazzrah, and Ragnaros. Most of the fights don't need to to micro manage your pet much but for a few you have to do a little bit to make sure they don't stand in the fire.
---
Our guild does 2 runs of mc, you can choose what ever day you can come since people have events, job and stuff. So we have mix of alts and mains both raid times. Most mains already have tier gear and a lot of time we juss de items. Now alts get those if any main doesnt need those. Even as feral i have 4 tier pc bc alts and mains even have them so i get them so we would not de them. We clear it in 2h and no works well
---
By that time you will be kicked, because you are giving bad dps/hps/have no survivability/tps because *you are holding their progress back* /s
---
DKP/EPGP this is 40 ppl raid with 3-4 drops, not 10-12 friendly small collective where you would have 2-3 people on same loot list as you.
---
Yea that's what I'm hearing, looks like a 1% drop chance so we'll see how she goes, should be fun lol
---
Shirking on studies because of Wow might be a poor financial decision for those contemplating.
---
Okay. Glad you ignored the well thought out logic I used, and instead reverted to the classic "bUt I wAnTed iT" defense.
---
played on my buddy's rig and he had a mod that showed him what spell/move his opponent was casting/about to do. he says its legal, which i guess it is, but it's still wrong and incredibly fucked up, right? sad to find out my friend is a dirty cheater
---
What a stupid rule. And worse notification.
---
Free action potion?
---
Lmao
---
sounds to me like you're more than ready
---
Sorry basic question. What is a progression raid? I have never really raided before...
---
That does sum up shadow priests pretty well
---
Because of all the trolls and premades who report players for AFK to get there friends in, so blizz turned the auto boot off.  This means people with autohotkey are free to afk as they please.  You can report them but nothing will happen
---
smol zerg is an oxymoron
---
4-5 seems lucky. I tend to have 10-15 afk abusers.
---
I've never AFK'd a BG on purpose. Not once. Most people realize its a dick move. Your Mom prob did a shit job raising you.
---
I have lv 20 warlock casting souldrain on lv 48 mobs in front of BRD. Have 5/5 reduce resist by 10% and my hit chance does feel like 10%.
---
Cya l8er
---
the LFG / LFR features have a similar behavior.
---
there's always one overgeared chap in every LFG ( or 4-5 overgeared chap in LFR) in order to carry the rest of the group.
---
Preach did an experiment on this : got 50ish well-geared people of all roles to queue for a random heroic at the same time and none of them ended up in the same groups.
---
Probabaly edgemasters or cloud keeper leggings.
---
I don't have my 100% mount speed yet. 
---
Would it be more cost effective to just get the AV mount?
---
you don't like blizzards decision to make rank 14 grind a pve grind?
---
u wrong! blizzard never makes any mistakes! me mad! me reddit user
---
Cast normal then Pom Flamestrike!
---
Ha i had the same issue on my hunter. i redid my hotbars and took auto attack and auto shoot off think i could just right click to engage. I spent probably 2 days without firing arrows before i found auto-shoot in my spell book. I don't know how i kept missing it but it was frustrating AF
---
🏳 🏳 🏳 🏳 🏳 🏳
---
900k, stand 2439.... Damn...
---
Yes we can. Many of the "good" fc's have swiftmend + NS, as well as fire reflector.
---
Lacks context.
---
What's your race? Main spec? What does your overall gear look like? Is it enchanted?
---
Use Neatplates. It shows all enemy health bars and debuffs currently on them. I’m not a Druid but I use it to track my rends and sunders, plus it shows which mobs are aggroed.
---
Dude that mousepad is amaze. I need it
---
For a lot of guilds, yeah. My guild didn't kill Rag on the first night we fought him. Maybe you'll say that we suck but we're not the only guild in that situation.  
---
And that will increase even more in BWL.
---
I just start practicing my jumps once i see the game is turning into a turtle or my team is getting crushed.
---
classic has multiple steps of verification that's why it lags
---
Yeah I had no idea who he was lol I was a lvl 30 and he helped me with a TON of ahot actually .. I saw ppl going off on him in trade chat and I was like “hey I didn’t know ur famous” and he told me and I was like oh okay .. I had no idea what a binding even was lol ! I kept playing w him but my guild got crazy pissed lol I got busy with levelling stuff so I didn’t really see him much but yeah lol . He’s good at pvp I will give him that
---
&gt;  So you just described how you are playing wrong.
---
No, I described how I assume a lot of people are playing wrong to get under 3~4 casts.
---
Ya, but you will probably get ganked a shit ton.
---
There is no reason to not send melee. Assign 3 melee to each priest and bubble then drink before the fight. Send everyone in at once and reapply bubbles if needed because mana isnt a challenge in a 1 minute fight. You get may get 1 teleport from Shazz so the melee can bandage at that opportunity. The healers are aware they need to keep the melee up and the melee all have some sense of self preservation so they pop their potions/healthstones when at half.
---

---
Dude it’s in the cards... you’re worrying way too much about your friends play than your own. You do what you want! Play the game and have fun! Make new friends!
---
Blame the people that were mass reporting people as afk to get them kicked when they weren't afk. Basically, the fuckers who abused the afk reporting system are to blame.
---
Les Hinterlands *hon hon hon...*
---
What’s EPL? Thanks for the idea in silithus!
---
I guess that’s the benefit of playing in a low population server..
---
Plenty of trees to auto-run up against...
---
I like the other guy's idea where everyone on high pop realms makes 9 alts and gets 15 HK's with them every week to massively dilute the bottom end of the pool.
---
I haven't looked into this yet, but iirc, there is a 30 day waiting period before you can transfer a character a second time.
---
Your plan might be fine. Just don't expect to be on Flamelash for less than one month.
---
easy farm if ur warr has a raid weapon. the corpse runs from pvp are brutal though so its better to farm it at night.
---
Big gift idea right there.
---
Dkp always causes drama because you don’t have to be invest and form a relationship with your guildies.
---
With dkp I can just horde all my points for the one piece of loot I really want (even if it doesn’t benefit the raid) 
---
With Loot council you have to form a relationship with your guildies and be an active participant in loot discussions with your class members. 
---
What I see most dkp guilds doing is they do dkp but they kinda loot council it too. So that You cant horde points as a dps warrior and take perditions blade when it drops.  
---
I would just say go all in with LC for the start. It creates a commitment/time sunk cost as well as forcing members of a class to talk with each other and sort out the drops for that week.
---
I think a lot of people have that thought.
---
I see a whole lot fleeing from Firemaw atm, as you need 10 hours a day to even make it to bracket 10
---
Its the easiest class to play by a good country mile. Of course your entire pvp strat is dependent on your opponent not having a free action potion, but if never having to think about how to handle a fight sounds appealing... mage is the class for you.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
NO TOUCHING

. I got 700k honor and i was only standing 170. Standing 1 is 1 440 000 honor (horde side EU)
---
I empathized with you until you complained about the location of leveling dungeons as if that means jack shit.. look how close Stormwind/IF are to BRM where the first 2 raid tiers are? I share your frustrations about the unnecessary ganking and lost time, it can be super tilting, but the rest is pretty peurile. 
---
And what about Deadmines and Stockades? 
---
I just rerolled to a more balanced server where a friend plays, fuck it.
---
Thalanos is pretty even
---
I did some grinding last night with a hunter/rogue combo.  It's not hard just keep in mind that the demons hit hard.  The felstalkers do a mortal strike and the Succubi do a nasty dot with occasional MC.  Since the warrior doesn't have good stuns, he will be taking almost all the damage.
---
Use your shield on the warrior when mortal strike hits or just wait it out, the debuff isn't long.
---
Put SWP up and just wand, you'll be healing more than DPSing.
---
They can be feared.  Use this to your advantage.  The mobs are very spread out so even a beeline fear isn't that much of a concern.
---
Make sure to dispel at all times.  Also shadow protection should help a little against the succubi shadow bolts.
---
Go on the actual fight club discord and ask about accuria.
---
You keep parroting these bis lists like they mean something but you don’t even understand why
---
Warriors only need 6% hit. It is easy to get hit. Accuria is a waste for fury pve dps
---
PvP is a different conversation, because you can use that 2% hit to upgrade stamina somewhere else
---
Are you sure about the 6 month thing?
---
If you're not enjoying the game, it only makes sense to stop playing. Sometimes you just have to vent.
---
Yea, I don't know what these people are talking about. Having energy automatically makes you faster than a lot of other classes, being able to sneak past the 10 000 mobs in a cave when you want an item, being able to disengage and not corpse walk, being able to dodge pvp encounters and not to mention the fact that you kill stuff fast.
---
Except when it is a convenient excuse for not having the necessary manhours to either fix bugs or bring the game 100 % to the nochange state.
---
They have been doing both and thus neither.
---
To me it feels this "reference client" is just a coverall excuse to explain whatever they want.
---
If 20 hrs and it being mindless is a barrier, even if all bots are banned, you are very unlikely to higher ranks.
---
Incedius is like 45-55 horde and is a very active server. One of the best currently.
---
You can hardcast it without breaking invis, it saves you a GCD if you count from the moment they become aware of you.
---
Drink free action potion and get a pvp trinket. Boom you just nerfed mages.
---
I was/am in a similar situation. I suggested we roll on a PVE realm where my old Vanilla guild was leveling. We are all east coast, this realm was east coast. Instead, we decided to go with a west coast pvp server. Alright, no big deal. At least we are all together.
---
So launch day comes around and I'm logged into the character selection screen like 4 hours before launch. I'm ready. Everyone else logs in a few minutes after go-live and they are 13,000 in queue. So a few of them suggest leveling on a different realm. By this time, I'm level 12 on a warrior and am significantly ahead of the pack. I know at this point it would have been easy to reroll and just go with them, but I had put in tons of effort in coordinating with other groups of friends who were already on the server leveling. I said I was going to continue leveling on this realm because there were only a handful of them who hadn't made it on now. Just stay in queue and you'll eventually get in. They agreed that it would be unfair to the ones who are ahead of the pack to uproot the entire plan.
---
So things go on for a few weeks and we are all still on the same server, but we start losing people slowly. Turns out, the ones who wanted to level on the pvp realm don't actually like getting killed by horde, so they quit. The ones who haven't quit are leeches. Every time they log in, they ask me to run them through a dungeon or give them gold. So much so that I set my battle.net to offline and just stay flagged as afk all the time. 
---
Eventually, one of them (the biggest leech), decides that he isn't getting enough help leveling, so he leaves the guild and joins another guild with more people around his level. This set off a chain reaction over the next few weeks of more people leaving the guild/quitting the game.

Now, after three months, I'm the only one left of my friend group. I've joined another guild and I like playing with them, but that whole startup situation was so stressful. We could have had a real shot at keeping 40 people together if we would have just rolled on the PVE realm with my OG guildies, but no. That guild fell apart too because they didn't have enough people. I just wanted to play with my friends and not have to worry about pugging. Now I'm still pugging and have had to make new friends.
---
We have the correct difficulty as of patch 1.12 though. Are you wanting them to cherry pick which aspects of the game have certain patch content for the sake of "it's the most non-gimped version imaginable"?  AV has 1.6 content, but BRD has 1.10 items, while BRS has 1.3 mob density kind of stuff? That'd be absurdly inconsistent.
---
They've chosen staggered content release for a (imo) good reason: Consistency, progression, and not overloading content.
---
If they released the game with EVERYTHING open and available for us to enter, there'd be a LOT of burn out and/or complaining. It's fairly daunting to have 3 raid tiers, with the "half-tiers" (ZG and AQ20). And think of trying to get the AQ gates open from launch, with people grinding the rep and racing through the questlines to get that done... It'd be nutty and ridiculous.
---
I'm all for the game being improved. I'd like better class balance (warriors reigned in, meme specs not being fucking memes, etc) and better QOL on certain things (even faster/instant mail for guildmates/alts, as an example). But I also know that that'd absolutely ruin the "authentic feel" that many desire. It would turn it into something much more retail-esque (though I have faith they have learned and wouldn't ruin it), which would turn off a huge portion of the community that returned to WoW specifically for the Vanilla-style WoW.
---
Dont you know the point is to get R14 and then quit the game because you're burnt out.
---
Does the warrior have the epic 2h from ZF? 
---
If he does it should be easy.
---
Oh man, love the hype, but damn do I hate Gnomer. My least favorite dungeon. My hype killer. But cheers! Have fun my dude.
---
Honest question, but how would you even go about quantifying whether someone was killed poorly or perfectly? Surely you're not suggesting to do it by how much HP the winner has at the end.
---
I said that the slowest thing besides rogues was shaman and warrior. Lock and Priest are both objectives faster at least after level 45 since you can chain kill things from range.
---
So you counter by saying that you have the two slowest classes to level (which I already mentioned) and a 36 Priest that hasn’t even got all their leveling weapons and is maybe 40% through the experience. If your lock is slower than rogue than your ability to play warlock properly is the problem. And if you’re slower on your Priest from 45-60 that again is a player problem.
---
Great advice, the war has piercing howl as well so hopefully we can run a bit if shit starts hitting the fan. Will keep the fear in mind as well, thanks
---
Lately I've been hearing that rogue is even harder to level than warrior, at least on low pop realms/PvE servers. Would you say there's a grain of truth to that?
---
Personally, I could see how that could be true. As a warrior you get access to some pretty swell AoE abilities, cleave, and some hard hitting instants that can chunk a mob pretty quickly. I know rogue gets a ton of stuff too, but it seems like they really really suffer if they have to deal with a second mob. I also suspect that warriors having the option to dungeon spam makes the process considerably easier than leveling a rogue. I could be completely wrong though.
---
I leveled a pally this time around so it was a breeze. Everyone wanted me in their group, and while mobs didn't die super fast, I had basically no downtime as long as I kept wisdom up and frontloaded my damage. Every 10 levels was like a massive jump in solo effectiveness for me, especially when I got to the point where I had concecration and seal of command - I was able to tank or heal depending on what the group needed, and soloing was simple. Almost no horde players ever wanted to mess with me too, except for the occasional gankin Hank squad.
---
&gt; Rework AV? Hell no.
---
TFW they literally realeased most of the "original" version of AV on live servers for the anniversary event, but gave us more or less the live garbage sans reinforcements.
---
You have good taste in command ships.
---
arathi highlands for elemental fire when there is no competition (almost never)
---
duo dme jump runs if u have raid weapons and mining
---
eye of shadow farm with a healer
---
ofc this all depends on ur servers prices. eg if eye of shadow is like 200g on ur server its not worth farming it.
---
Damn. That was disappointing
---
Luckily hunters have it pretty easy :) 
---
\- Farm some demonic runes 
---
\- Greater mana potions do the trick for me right now.  like 10-15s each fights are so short that you dont need the expensive ones.  those + demonic runes shoudl be okay for a while
---
\- as others have said, stock up on squid. 
---
\- I dont plan to flask even through progression on a hunter.  We take so little damage (max range, feighn death) that I never need the extra hp.  Maybe come AQ/naxx progression? Im not sure 
---
\- Pick mountain silversage for a few hours here and there and you shoudl be set for a while for the mongoose pots
---
Consumes Warrior is one of the most expensive classes, High repair high consume needs. Mongoose, winterfel firwater, ect ect
---
Eastern Plague Lands
---
Is there anywhere I can read up on GUID on Ragnaros? I'm interested in understanding the mechanics of it. Or could someone break it down in an understandable way? :)
---
Smashed it this morning. Never been Searing Gorge but it’s a super quick run from Kargath and some level 60 was killing the dwarves nearby so I just waltzed in, spoke to the reindeer, ran to Thorium Point for the FP and then flew back to Gromgol. EZ. (I’m level 46.)
---
That's a nice story about a server community ;)
---
No no, I get that. :) I meant that you'd need to do that for 10+ different trinkets (my Engineering is only ~250 and I already have about 12-13 different trinkets I use) and for several pieces of armor (Engi helmets, Engi boots, belts, etc.) if you want to have the same functionality of those addons. That's a lot of action bar slots and keybinds.
---
Instead of all those extra slots on your bars, you can use ItemRack/TrinketMenu, mouse over those buttons and from the popup menu quickly switch to the armor/trinket you want to equip.
---
Okay, that makes a lot of sense as long as the pet can deal consistent damage. However, how's the differential on "pet-unfriendly" fights?
---
As a side note, if u have a link to the simulations, I'd appreciate it.
---
Entitled left because badtank was scared he wouldn’t be able to get Scarab Lord on the server so he ran off to one where he can.
---
Windows + Printscreen works too
---
 The combat log shows what spell is being cast, so the addon puts it on the nameplate
---
2.0 was the mechanics changes (Including removing ranks and making honor a currency)
---
As long as it's in his bank we should be fine!
---
For sure, I agree
---
Thanks for the detailed response!  Yeah it looked like the Garr fight is the only part where im doing something besides shadowbolt.
---
My gear is good, but it’s nothing unobtainable by most people. I still use pre bis weapons (Deep Woods and Flurry). With 1 mighty rage pot, I can keep HS qued most of the fight
---
Gearing for hit past 6% just doesn’t make sense anymore. All these bis lists came out before it was realized how heroic strike que worked
---
Im not agreeing with it im just pointing out that hardcore guilds sometimes have “tests” like this in order to weed out the casual players. 
---
I was in a guild right at launch that put up “You must join discord, change your name to your in game name and then DM your class officer  “oogabooga” To not be /gkicked at the end of the week.
---
No man. It’s not. 
---
I’ve bin on disc with bunch of them and even asked why they moved. And most of the times they say I dunno just moved a little.
---
Is the go-to healing addon still healbot? Staring to have enough raid gear to really try and push my limits and was wondering if I missed a more efficient addon.
---
HAHAHHAHA you are fun

---
Almost like they're different people. 
---
If you think there's a distinction between the kind of personality of a player who chooses horde vs alliance, I feel bad for you.
---
Are you testing it on mobs that can be sapped? Not beasts for example
---
the only real drama my guild had was because of a multiboxer that was raiding with us.  we roll on gear for main spec. you get one "win" per raid then you can only roll on off spec stuff afterwords.   the very first raid a mage asked how it was going to work with a multiboxer and he immediately got defensive and started harassing the mage that asked a rather important question.  he wanted to be able to roll on everything which meant if a piece of mage gear droped he wanted to roll on it 4 times cause he had 4 mages.  we all called him out on this bullshit and said no  we already talked about this you were only even allowed to bring mulitple characters because we were still recruiting and short a few people and he was explicit told we expected him to pick a "main" and just gear him out.   well turns out he thought he could manipulate the leadership into letting him to what he wanted but several of us stopped that he got mad and left. 
---
also multiboxers are scum and are terrible at raiding. I gave it chance and all it did was confirm my biases.  that dude was a piece of shit who did nothing but try and manipulae and harass people to get his way and threw fits when he didnt.  there was about half of the guild ready to quit over this piece of shit and i am glad hes gone. now we are pretty much drama free and having a great time.
---
PvP or open-world mob farming, the extra 10 energy is game changing. Raid fights, the 10 energy makes almost no difference, but the flexibility in gearing you get with the +5 daggers is huge.
---
It is if it's against company policy
---
He was singing, to the tune of the Sesame Street intro theme.
---
Says the mage who doesn't like the idea of warriors being able to 1 shot them with R14 weapons, totally ok with the super bloated amoount of spellpower available right now though.
---
We haven't run into a situation where specific alts are needed. People who have alts and want gear that main raiders don't can purchase it for 100g per piece (300g) for leaf / eye. That gold funds the guild bank. We have the mats for our first thunderfury + 3 night falls and are working on TF #2 as well as building a flask supply for progression.
---
Even worse yeah.
---
I just keep my wolf at my side buffing. If I run something with the guild I can have my cat because I know they won’t blame me for their own mistake.
---
Eastern plaguelands but I would only do it if you have an epic mount.
---
It why people who do it are called hardcore lol its so extra but its “the line in the sand” to cross from being casual to hardcore!
---
It doesn't use GUID anymore, the last week's patch fixed it. But what it would do is that the Wrath of Ragnaros would only target the 3 players with the lowest GUID.
---
GUID being a string that is assigned to a character upon creation; his unique identifier.
---
... do we have a server newspaper? benediction
---
;)
---
I do use Neatplates and love them, but because I stand far away from the mobs as a healer I don't see the nameplates up at all times. Or is there a way to change it?
---
How do Flameguard Gauntlets benefit 2h more than dw?
---
Sunder and faerie fire takes that down to about a third.
---
Haha oh you silly
---
Do you log? I didn't notice the golem resists untill I checked my logs the 3rd or 4th week.
---
As someone who AFKs in AV, this is bullshit. The only thing that happens if some people report you at the same time is that you get an idle debuff, which kicks you out if you don’t engage in combat in 3 minutes. 3 minutes is plenty of time to quickly die to some Horde / Alliance and go back to AFKing. I rarely get the debuff, and when I do it’s only once per game. People aren’t persistent enough to keep reporting you all game long.
---
I’ve AFKed many many AV games and always got every last bit of honor and reputation.
---
But that's the thread it was in.  Bit slow are we?
---
Always keep your owl. It has the best threat gen and aoe threat for solo content. You could replace with a ZG bat later for the attack speed but keep those same skills.
---
Get a cat for PvP, dungeons, and raiding. Claw+dash+prowl are must haves 
---
Do NOT use a wolf, that line of thought about furious howl is out of date. The buff knocks off more important buffs, and is overall buggy with how it even applies on attacks already qeued/fired.
---
By ZG, the wind serpent from that raid is pretty useful for dps, more so for pet pulls since lightning breath is ranged.
---
&gt; The enclave is the guild.
---
Hmmm was this the same guild that played Planetside 2?
---
This is so sad and I can't believe people aren't aware of it. We should start a charity or campaign about it to raise awareness.
---
Yes because the game was new, you always had an influx of new people wondering what the hype was about and then got suckered in. It was also riding on the coat of the big success of the lotr movies, people were suddenly more interested in the fantasy setting. 
---
WoW back then was pulling gamers in from all genres, I remember half the CS1.6 scene in my country straight up quitting over night because of WoW, it was a cultural phenomenon.
---
Now just look at how many people quit in phase 2, then add the numerous people who also quit because: mc is too easy, layers are ruining the game, av zerging ruined pvp, etc ... 
---
If we just had 3k people, 1500 each side to start with then most servers would be on life support and merging was imminent. If we had 3k servers then we'd also have more nationalised servers which would really suck, I'm honestly quite surprised it has been perfect on that aspect.
---
the group queue would likely make it even worse, all it takes is 5 ppl to insta kick i think. they need to let you join with 1 or 2 others and call it a day
---
The old AV gives even more rep than the version we have now. The version now just gives 350 rep if you win it and some more rep before that. In the old hours lasting AVs you can farm rep by turning in the stuff the enemy drops.
---
This is soooo fucking cool! I aspire to draw like this, still learning tho. Can you share some tips on the shadowing/lighting?
---
A lot of people wanted the 1.12 version because a lot of classes, talents and equip got buffed and balanced at that time.
---
Just because people didnt want the sh\*t talents from 1.5 doesnt mean they want the 1.12 AV.
---
Classic is more than just the honor system. You can love classic but hate aspects of it.
---
nature res gear for aq40 if u see them cheap on AH.
---
guild's shadow priest here, wait till you get to 60 and get geared, it gets more fun, but also learn to mana management :)
---
im mainly a pvper too, let me know i f you have any spec questions or gear questions
---
It’s less than 300g on incendius horde, and It’s hardly a meme tank weapon. It can be acquired before stepping foot in MC and will easily generate enough aggro for 95% of guilds
---
In that situation then a warrior who saves his dkp for perditions blade should be able to get perditions blade even if no rogues have it? Since barring the warrior from spending dkp would be an enactment of “loot council”
---
High Interest long term CDs.
---
I feel like this isn't new.
---
I got to 6 hours because you said the time spend with his family is too low at the 4.2 hours it is now at. Now lets say he is like me and spends 30-60 minutes with his family on a typical day. 
---
That means he has enough time to play and do all that thanksgiving stuff, because he plays for 6-7 hours on a typical day and with other stuff averages down to 4.5 hours.
---
I'm also here for rep, but now its faction rep turn ins :) So now i love the turtle games, can get 1000-2000 Main faction rep with 1/3 to other factions on turtle games.
---
There's a max range on seeing nameplates, this might be the problem that you're encountering.
---
Everyone knows that if you're the first person to type gz, you get bumped up in the LC waiting list.
---
Imagine instead of having to stealth around mobs and vanish to reset you just killed them all in a similar time frame and collected all that extra XP and loot.
---
I'm not max level yet so I'm not sure about queue times but you might want to check out Netherwind, it seems pretty good so far.
---
Still better than imstagram famous, or tic tokers. Atleast you can see some technique or content from streamers.
---
Yes, it has a 50% chance to lose a point of durability each time it blocks. It can easily lose 15+ durability per pull of those big undead packs in strat
---
No idea.  But a mage can 100-0 a warrior, rogue can 100-0 most clothies.
---
When a single crit PoM pyro gives as much honor as a epic 5 minute duel on a knife edge, skill is not measured in any capacity.
---
The easiest fix is ratings from arena but for open world pvp.  Ranks do that to a point but are static each week and can be afk'd to higher levels, not worked.
---
First thing I thought when I read that was "I'd love only having to split drops between the 25 best players in my guild..."
---
&gt; because spy let peopel take rogues out of stealth
---
No it doesn't.
---
ya as people said, you have to have several people report the person before it boots them
---
if i recall its 5 or more?
---
Then I misinterpreted what you wrote, considering a constant influx of new players, which I will agree, classic does not have, at least not in the volume they had originally.
---
Because you only post and don't READ.
---
well if we go by the fact that this garbage is on 1.12 bc will be on 2.4.3 no?
---
It's entertaining in the same way explosions, murder and violence is.
---
following that Logic : Next expasion Will include an auto button, press and your character can fight by itself while you can do other stuff lol
---
Demonic runes will share a cooldown with Healthstones, so be aware of that. 
---
Make sure you're aware of your curse/banish assignments, both for Garr and the trash past Garr. You can only banish the earth elementals, all fire elementals are immune.
---
Read up on the strategies for each boss on somewhere like Wowhead. The bosses are pretty simple, but it's good to know ahead.
---
Make sure you have mods like DBM and a threat meter installed. Also get a mod that shows debuff timers so you can pre-cast banish.
---
Stock up on shards for summons and to refill HS/SS/demon from any potential wipes. Try to refill on as much trash as you can.
---
Maybe get some restorative pots. They're nice on Lucifron and Baron to help you're decursers/dispellers.
---
Felhunter consume magic can be very helpful on a few of the other fights.
---
Ahhh I gotcha. Thank you sir. It's the availability of options for Shaman that make it pref on them.
---
I'm thinking you have a limited experience/grasp on both Warfronts and AV.
---
I don't want to start a fight here but... Is everyone at least kind of maybe... ... Just a little bit... Understanding of why Blizzard went to the arena model?
---
I've always loved TBC, I'll put that bias out there, but these past weeks have made me truly see TBC and Vanilla in 20/20 vision. TBC and flying mounts killed world PvP? I mean... World PvP is dead now. I could almost make an argument long term world PvP in TBC beats long term (mid to end state) vanilla world PvP.
---
Between refined raids, class balance, and actual competitive PvP TBC just seems to be a clear natural progression for quality content.
---
What happens when we go down the classic plus route and "world PvP" is literal God's in t4 nuking everything in their path...
---
So what are you suggesting, that you would loot council override a sub-optimal pick spending their DKP?
---
Lol yeah I'm not doing the whole thing again, just missed the last punch card machine, and need radioactive fall out.  Then never again.
---
I'm on Old Blanchy and it seems pretty balanced and there's a decent amount of people out in the world.
---
To add salt to the wound, you wont be farming shit on a full pop PvE server.
---
saying SP&gt;hit means nothing, you need to attach a value to the spell power.
---
It's a rational decision in wanting to acquire something that you only have a once in a lifte opportunity to get.
---
You can go hiking across Europe when you're 60, learn how to fly a Chesna at 45. Getting a high rank you've been dreaming off since vanilla is something you only can get *now*. And you simply don't know if Blizzard will turn off the game in 3years, if your server dies. 
---
The sum of pointless activities are just as worthless investing all your time into WoW: Classic for couple months. 
---
Go drinking friday night, watch netflix hungover on saturday for 5hours, take a nap for 1 1/2 hours later on, because of hungover tiredness. gz, you just wasted 15hours of time you could've invested into learning french. 
---
All I'm saying is that wasting 3months of your life once in your life for something you've been dreaming of on and off, is not wasted.
---
Btw lots of pservers folks ranked right out of the server launch and once they had the brutal gear the game actually started for them. They didnt quit. The demographic back then was a different one, because people didnt know what they were getting into and once rank 12 didnt want to stop, because of sunken cost fallacy.
---
Friends, often more casual, of members
---
Stick your fingers in your ears and continue to go lalalalala.
---
I turned off bg chat long ago.
---
Best decision I've ever made in solo queue.
---
1% hit is a little more of a damage increase than 1% crit, IT IS NOT A HUGE JUMP IN DPS, for fuck sakes people go to the warlock spreadsheets and look around.
---
I wasnt responding to your original comment, and then you answer like thats what I did. You're embarrassing yourself.
---
&lt; Vile &gt; of the realm Old Blanchy would love to have you. We're still too small to raid yet but we've just started building. Here is our discord if you'd like to learn more:  https://discord.gg/zx5xxjY

They’re whiny little pansy asses. The whole lot of them. 😉

Eh... wasn't really you. It was the NPCs.
---
Loot council is objectively better in every way.
---
LMFAO what a fun guild
---
Nope, Skullflame Eu it is. Is there a way to get last weeks report of HonorSpy?
---
Naw, that was back during original retail.
---
Haven't had any drama at all in Classic, but I haven't reached level 60, so maybe I'm just missing out since I'm not in the raid chats.
---
Honestly, with Bgs in the game ganking has gone back to it's "natural" state, and unless your old server was totally destroyed ala Flamelash eu, I would heavily reccomend sticking it out on your old server for most people. I had the advantage of knowing what a PvP server was like, having played PvP in vanilla and bc, it can get ugly, but P2 was awful for some folks and I realise it probably left some scars. Despite that, I do believe that the real experience is had on a PvP server.
---
Daze occurs when hit in the back, try to face the mob for the hits while kiting.
---
Unless you get the WHOLE SET 😍
---
30-40 with Corpsemaker is pretty easy too. But after 40 as enhance you really don’t want to use mana, but then also take so much damage waiting for autos even while kiting that the mana you save goes into healing waves. It’s also pretty restrictive as you want to kill several mobs within your totem range so you have to position well to save mana dragging the mobs into a set spot which isn’t always easy and sometimes can get you into trouble.
---
Get rid of Tailoring, ASAP. Spend 30 minutes in Azshara and you can make as much gold from the herbs you pick as what you'd make from your 4-day Mooncloth cooldown. Dreamfoil, Mountain Silversage, Sungrass, even Goldthorn and Swiftthistle (from Mageroyal/Briarthorn nodes) sell nicely.
---
Friends and I planned our conquest the entire summer.
---
Everyone made sure we had the week of release off as soon as the date was out. 
---
Only two of us actually sat down when the queue first opened up and had a chance to play on the first night. The others were stuck waiting most not getting in until midday the next day. Most of my friends ended up never getting 60. Most left around 45-50.. I think the whole launch fuckery kinda screwed us up there.
---
The ones who did make it to 60 I joined a guild with. And we had a couple friends from another game who had more irl friends and we joined with them and merged with another 20 ppl on server to form a guild. 
---
And of course the gm was the dumbest person in the guild and did so much shady shit before we even tried to raid I just flat out never signed up. My friends still raid with them and they clear ony and mc every week but they all hate it because the people we merged with are ass hats.  All in all a dissapointment I’ve just been re rolling and leveling I’ll be off it soon I’m giessing
---
It can be done solo as a shadow priest. Warrior/priest is more than capable.

Show me "mathematically" 1 item that outpaces either of these, you made this claim and have the burden of proof, and if you are somehow (very unlikely) correct I should be able to really increase my dmg/dps right?
---
This isn't true, Dire Maul are was completely Alliance dominated. I was there a lot and we smashed all the horde who tried to get in. EPL, WPL and Felwood were back and forth. Gadgetzan and Everlook were horde cities, with people not caring about guards and just killing all alliance. But all this is gone now. Ever since BGs came out i've had a couple scraps around the world. The biggest horde group i fought was 3 (Burning steppes) and they were probably just farming something. The world is fine, nowhere near how it was in p2.
---
Plato believed the best form of government was a monarchy under perfect conditions. Notice the "under perfect conditions" qualification. That's how I feel about LC vs DKP. One is ideal, the other, real.
---
As a rogue I had a priest cast devouring plague and swp as I rode buy on mount. Just the 2 dots killed me from full hp.
---
Yes. That is the best thing to do
---
I think you'll find most of the players who will ever play classic hit 60 a while ago.  I'd guess even half the people 1-59 are alts for people who already hit 60 on their main and won't spend a lot of time running &lt;45 dungeons, with a few key exceptions for cleave groups when possible.
---
&gt; Rank 14 grind was never about pvp or pve.
---
are you drunk
---
Create a separate SK list for alts, if no one uses their main SK roll, then the alts can use their bid.
---
Heyo someone replied.
---
Go under events in MSBT and just disable/enable what fits you
---
Found the guy who joined a bad guild once and won't let anyone else forget it.
---
With the DM East farm I have gotten Stockade Pauldrons so that definitely was a big win. But I've also got a few of the books from times, no compendium yet. 
---
The serrated petals and lasher roots vendor for a lot. Usually I got several gold from those alone every run. But yeah the ghost mushrooms and other valuable herbs need to be AH and there is no real way to predict how to make them sell. 
---
I usually stock them in my bank for a while then sell them as a stack.
---
I actually agree a lot with you. The gameplay is equally garbage, but I was not looking forward to AV anyway.
---
The big differences for me is that I am soon AV exhalted and never have to take a step inside there again. 
---
On retail as a CE raider I had to keep main and alts up to date and one of the big ways to get catchup gear on alts was in the warfront.. And for main to grind azerite.. So I had to do that crap forever.
---
I’ve heard this multiple times , believe it to be true.

That said , I probably won’t fish them - it’d be more efficient to do tribute runs and buy the squid.

It is really easy for people to see what video game addiction is once they've experienced it. I used to play too much and now that I don't its obvious when someone has a problem.
---
You do have a responsibility to your family to be part of their lives. Sitting on a computer for 4-6 hours a day is an absent parent.
---
&gt;Spell hit caps at 17 percent for casters which isn't possible.
---
Which is why you need more, regardless if it is possible or not, which is why it's not surprising.
---
I've never seen the need to use a healer-specific raid frame. Just use Grid2 and put the buffs/debuffs you care about in indicators that you like. Everything else falls away.
---
Most fights are less than a minute long and don't have any raid damage, raw spell power *is* PvE BiS and if you're saying otherwise it's you that's wildly off
---
I wish I could farm runes as a healer. I blow through about 10/raid and the BoE ones are expensive here. Double the cost of a mana pot or higher!
---
The drama is easily handled if people understand what happened.  Player refuses to heal then expects favoritism when a good healing item drops?  Yeah, no one will care.
---
Greenshot is free I thought?
---
Wasn't cross server at the start too, so these ridiculous honor numbers didn't exist.
---
Depends on guild- I’d say 2 hours or less when farmed.
---
I have no clue what you are even talking about. I was doing jump runs every day in there to get arcane crystals and there were horde 20 and 40 mans there on a daily basis killing us to get in there. Just because you saw an Alliance raid in there 1 time does not mean it was "dominated" by alliance. The game was pretty much unplayable and caused a lot of our guildies to basically start the raid log cycle and we have about half the numbers we had online before with the exception of raid nights.
---
It's like getting a happy birthday on facebook.
---
Honestly, i noticed a change a lot more SB resists overall this week (all 6 warlocks in raid have about 15% than average) and the first time i remember a partial resistance on a corruption tick...
---
Scarlet Kris is pretty good, but honestly I would just grind AV rep for the revered and exalted daggers as they are probably the best prior to MC daggers.
---
atleast you get to win
---
You made a mistake. PVE servers sound lame.
---
Yeah, I don't know why you would feel that way regarding ANY profession. Seems like he had some problems in the past with them.
---
Yea 0 proof when you have the burden, typical
---
800g vs 640g. Not nothing, but less than plural hundreds.
---
Is this some imorph transmog?
---
Leave classic at Naxx. Fix retail.
---
Or even strategy. All the mages in a group that AoEs down adds are going to have a way higher parse than anyone in a group that single-targets them regardless of skill or gear.
---
Yes don’t all casuals play 6 hours a day?
---
Choker would be better than a neck with 2% hit on it, waiting for those who know nothing to downvote this comment.
---
good luck with gnomer, remember to keep checking your 6 for the alarmobots, they will cause a wipe pretty much as soon as they go off if you're already in a fight.
---
OP’s post has a comment dated from August 8. Your link was posted on August 19...
---
So why should I play AV the way other people want me to?  They want to fuck around and waste everyone's time?  Fine.  I will too.  It's the same standard; I've just stopped trying to uphold it.
---
If you are expected to flask, it might be tough, but otherwise I would think it would be fine. You will need to be efficient with you time, though, minimal sitting around afk in IF/org.
---
OK JERRY, i guess it is possible to disagree in science but look at some data.
---
Bro if it helps I agree with you that Jtrain is a dick hole. Getting advice from someone when you’re really just trying to vent about a shitty situation from your perspective sucks. Clearly that guy is just a passive aggressive critic that can fuck himself. He just wants to play devils advocate lots of people get their rocks off on that shit.
---
But seriously that situation is frustrating as fuck. Personally I would have been like “ fuck you guys I like this server and I’m staying on it. Come back or don’t.” A lot of times if things are as rocky as you said with coordination people will just be like fuck it I’m coming back.
---
My friends and I tried to setup a server at launch and then we all got split up not wanting to deal with queues. Rolled on a server with my brother and committed and eventually got like half of them to reroll on my server and helped them power level to 60. 
---
Just commit to having fun and hopefully the circumstances change that make them want to reroll on your server.
---
It continually boggles my mind how unbelievably broken mages are. If I could change one thing about Classic, it would be to nerf mage AOE into oblivion.
---
Some of us have to work a full time job. We can't compete against people without a job. Me? I use Steam App and stream to my iPad. I can queue and move every five minutes. I even have a weak aura that has an alarm if I haven't moved in 4 minutes. Call me a scum bag, but I want to rank just as bad as the people who don't work. This unfortunately is my best option.
---
Wholesome!
---
Why so many shadow resists? Am I missing something? I only use those on world bosses rn, but I have the pattern to make them.
---
That might be a pserver thing. Someone told me I could do the same with argent Dawn enchants and it didn't work.
---
Nope, just hand of rag + rank 10 set
---
Well this is 1.12 version...near end of vanilla slightly before TBC patch
---
1 tank 1 heal , 7 dps , 1 key .
---
EZ  istance after Wc
---
People can just vote afk kick him...
---
There's so much so do in classic especially once naxx hits there will be plenty to do. Twinking alts WPvP objectives and the sorts
---
yeah maybe i am in denial. I think I wanted to hear it from somebody else.. so, thanks
---
thanks. And what is the best addon for managing raid groups?
---
Which server did you move to? 
---
I'll tell the story of when I moved servers from PvP to PvE in Wrath and felt lost. Then I joined a pug raid and got recruited by the guild that hosted the pug raid. I got to know the raid leader... And 11 years later we are married with two kids. Community is what you make of it. Post some guild applications, get into a guild, get to know people. I love PvE servers now and would never switch back to PvP.
---
I was once in a game where a warlock got called out. So he would cast the lowest level curse he had over and over to avoid the debuff and help 0.
---
do you need to buy riding skill on top of that? or just 640g for the mount and you can ride it?
---
getting close to exalted and have about 620g so i was trying to figure this out haha
---
Do you really want a dev team that took 4 months to make a keyring actually create content??
---
The only thing they have in common is failed ambitions. AV was supposed to be WoW's answer to DAoC's RvR - large-scale objective-driven PvP with the dynamic scale of world PvP.
---
Warfronts are supposed to be dynamic and engaging PvE Faction War content, that happened to fail at either of those. But being a tank in an undergeared raid for a Heroic Stromgarde is fun until the boss.
---
didn't think this post was going to even reach people when i said zerg i meant it as the alliances whole offensive team i should specify next time when i think of 1vs those numbers even 1v12 or 1v15 seems like its me vs their offensive zerg my b bros
---
Whelps are random.  If they break in the back, they break eggs in the front as they travel through.  That's what people are experiencing.  It's RNG.  If they break in the front, you may get a handful during P2.
---
Internal officer drama. Basically over half of the officers didn't like the GM, and apparently the GM felt that he was constantly being undermined by those officers. They all went into a Discord channel to air out their difference following an Onyxia kill and next thing we know, 3 officers are leaving the guild. The next day, yesterday, about 7 other people have decided to jump ship so now we are faced with rebuilding a good 30% of our core raid team, which lead to even more leaving. I suspect by this evening the guild will be lucky to have a dozen raiders left, and that's assuming the GM doesn't decide to dissolve completely (which in my opinion at this point would be the honorable thing to do).
---
&gt; I played like 70+ hours last week

Filthy casual.

---
Stamina isnt that important in MC, youre health is already so small in pve gear, our armor is nothing. Look when you die in MC, im sure most of the time you are getting overkilled by lots of damage, or there is another attack that would have been coming from the mob after you died.
---
Thrash blade worked fine for my MH until I got Bblade to replace it. Dal’rends or any other slow MH will be just fine. Mirah’s in your offhand.
---
I fail to see how that’s worse than everyone queuing AV not because they enjoy the Zerg PVE but because they can’t afford to tank their honor per hour playing the BG they actually enjoy
---
Nice cell phone pic of the screen
---
Thank You, This is exactly what I needed! I like tanking, but everyone kind of expects you to lead the party and I had no idea where I was going half the time.
---
Do you even have enough mana to aoe farm gy at 44?
---
&gt; occasionally to talk about guild matters
---
The difference is this. They'd join only that channel and pull people into it mid-conversation thinking whatever they have to say is more important than the conversation that was happening. Also I'm not going to ask to join a channel just to talk to you. Basically a bunch of neckbeards who think being an officer in a wow guild is something respectable.
---
The true vanilla experience
---
Thank you.
---
I have one of those too. He’s a dumb wiener and he tried to take my chest. But he got into combat on the way. So I got the chest! What a dumb jerk. He smells like poop.
---
Yea I guess. I'm just used to bots spamming botanica so damn hard on retail ever since wotlk.
---
I've used it a few times, mostly to get into the queue during the first few days after launch. No issues yet. I haven't used it to actually play though
---
Greenshot is fucking brilliant
---
I’ve heard people give ranges from 40 to 44 to start, what do you think?
---
"succumbing to bias"? Lol probability and randomness dont work like that
---
You will be wearing the Gloves forever as a dagger rogue. No Item or set bonus will currently make up for it. However, the 110 energy isn't just a nice convenience during periods when your energy starts ticking. There is a "bug" that sometimes doesn't let you regenerate 20 energy, but 21 or also 19 and you'll end up missing 1 energy for your next Backstab / Sinister Strike sometimes. The +10 Energy gives you the extra buffer to get rid of this, depending on the CB / Energy cycle you are doing.
---
Imagine spending your time arguing nuances to create smoke and mirrors around the main issue. Why are you wasting time on this shill...
---
That doesn't give your casuals an interest in tagging along, and you need them also.
---
Assuming this is not a troll post, but having an enemy cast bar addon is almost mandatory. Everyone uses it and everyone SHOULD use it lol.
---
Why play AV the way it’s meant to be played. The world may never know
---
And you’re not gonna get rank 14 so stop trying to farm honor in AV
---
Agreed- getting groups instantly helps out a LOT.
---
Main part I was worried about is farming gold since I hate depending on DUOs for DME or selling tank runs. I’d rather cut to the chase so helping a mage alt should help.
---
The first mob you see is a grey.
---
A lot of time spamming LFG or /1 in cities looking for recruits.  Run pugs and offer invites to good performers. 
---
Make sure you have some sort of loot plan/system and stick with it.  I.e. don't change from DKP to LC then +1, etc. 
---
If you do LC you should set guidelines to what you're looking for even if its not set in stone or some math calculation.  Make sure you're actually tracking the factors you are considering, like attendance, consumables prep, etc. 
---
No matter what you do, make sure you're ready to give reasons for loot decisions or rules and stick to them.  You can listen to feedback and consider it internally for future decisions, but you need to stand on your decisions.  Loot is one of the hardest things in classic, so be prepared for drama. 
---
Be weary of people who *constantly* complain about loot as well.  Loot is random and slow in classic, and there's nothing you as a GM can do to fix that.  If someone expects all the best loot in the first month of raiding they're likely to bounce as soon as you don't give them something they demand, only to find the other guild can't fix it either.  Be prepared to let that be another guild's problem.  
---
Always be recruiting because people will inevitably leave.  Keeping an exact 40 man together is basically impossible.  Just because you fill a full 40-man raid two weeks in a row doesn't mean you're done recruiting.  Always be looking to fill raid 2 or recruit fresh 60s or 50-60 as backfills.  Always listen to feedback, but be firm in your decisions.
---
I think this is a great comparison between the two.
---
I think he's saying the site he linked ripped the maps without credit
---
Chose guild which caused my friend to follow me. He got kicked from guild, I stayed. He doesn't talk to me now and quit after he bragged about his pug groups for a couple weeks, while I'm over here fully geared in tank and pvp gear.
---
Was it on alliance side? 
---
I'm white, but made a black paladin that is a spot on remake of Steve Harvey. First experience I had when I hit SW was being called a darkie and told to leave by some douches.
---
Kinda funny they kept trying to freeze you like that. FAP is so OP I love them. Since I can form hop from snares I usually use the LIP, but I do love my FAP
---
Actually thought you were the guy who said it's sign that someone is incredibly unwell mentally - but yeah, there are a lot of wow guys, streamers as well, banging out the game. Top players too.
---
Used it to queue before leaving work back when queues started at 1 pm and were at 4+ hours by the time I'd get home from work. Never had a problem.
---
It’s easy to be a hard ass about it hypothetically, but in reality you won’t find healers who refuse to heal and expect loot very often. You’ll most likely end up with something like one priest with higher healing numbers but has more gear than the lower healing priest, but they happen to have the same weapon. The eye of divinity drops and you have to decide who to give it to. The guy who already has more gear but contributes more healing, or the one who needs it more and would hopefully increase their healing with the new gear.
---
It’s not black and white, which is why full transparency is needed, as well as a lot of trust between all raiders. It’d be easy if you could just deny gear to people who are underperforming compared to how they should be in their spec/gear and have bad attitudes, but chances are they don’t stick very long in the guild anyways.
---
Just saying, if people are donating to the guild bank and those donations are responsibly being used to help progression (stocking up on flasks for bwl,thinderfury mats, FR gear), they should be given priority by the LC.  People who are doing more to help the guild progress should be rewarded. (Different than just giving gold to the LC members or kissing ass)
---
Remote desktop? I don't even get why it should be a problem. 
---
I've used it all the time when classic launched. No bans or anything.
---
&gt; For me, having entire specs removed from the game like Combat for Rogues and Survival for Hunters, for gimmicky specs that look "like fun" but at the cost of a "classic" spec?
---
I feel this bigtime.  I played Combat since Vanilla.  All the way up until Outlaw came out.  Gave it a whirl, discovered that Roll The Bones is *the single worst designed ability in the entire game*, and gave up on the spec entirely.
---
Been Sub or Assassin ever since, even when Outlaw is the meta for M+ and shit.  Cause I hate it.
---
Thanks
---
That's a great story!
---
Maybe I should wait it out and just play the game and keep doing stuff and build the sense of this community. I had an alt on the server already and I got into a leveling guild and it felt awesome. But for some reason moving my main there just didn't feel the same.
---
Release TBC on schedule. Release WotLK on schedule. Peak wow.
---
Haha I feel ya. Reevaluate the urgency of getting exalted though if it really is miserable.  You can do AV an hour a day and you’ll get there in a couple weeks, leaving plenty of time to do more fun things in game.
---
Yes and no. Warlocks potential will be higher but they get capped by threat because of no -threat talents
---
Grobbulous is pretty good for alliance aswell!
---
I feel for you man. You just get to a point where you give up on them lol
---
interesting observation because my first 60 was a warr and i absolutely dreaded it and now i have a rogue on 55 and i have to say it's comletely different. I can take on multiple orange mobs or orange elite while as a warrior i always had to use long cd to even look at them
---
I don’t think it was this bad in vanilla. I remember playing av in vanilla and I definitely don’t remember being able to be hit through the wall in Van’s room. I played av a lot.
---

---
Sneaking through the cave makes you level slower, not faster
---
Once you have your pre-bis / gear you really only need to worry about having the gold to afford consumables. A typical 1 hour MC you will need at minimum: 4 sharpening stones @ 4-5g each. 2-4 mongoose elixirs at 4g each, giants elixirs, possibly arcane, fire and shadow protection potions, free action potion, health pots, etc. With BWL, during progression you may be expected to flask. So I would focus on trying to plan on how you will make gold. Personally I make my gold through the auction house and sometimes farming herbs.
---
HOW DARE YOU CHALLENGE MY LORE
---
I'm 49 still because I rerolled on PvE server as I never liked PvP anyway, got to level 18, but then server transfers came out so I've now transferred my 48 onto said PvE server and having a blast!
---
"Early 2020" is all we have. They said they'd give an update in early December, but that hasn't happened yet.
---
That's a good point. Forgot about that. Cast it and then PoM it.
---
Sorry, auto correct :( Uldaman
---
Or just, spit balling here, they could release the version of AV that every single person with any classic wow experience told them to instead of this watered down pretbc trash that was so easy it forced them to remove group queue because spoiler alert: people were farming it for absurd amounts of honor.
---
Yup. They are the main reason i want off this server. Even with Bgs out, they attack on sight. Last night trying to farm in winterspring alongside some other horde with no issues. Some &lt;Fury&gt; warlock rides by and starts the fight, end up getting killed by 10 horde now. I really wish they would xfer off the server and make our lives easier.
---
I'm in the same situation as you. Raiding will be fine, its the getting to 60 and getting the pre-raid BIS that is going to take forever. As of now my highest character (im an altaholic) is only 44.
---
he literally inspects him for the first 15 seconds of the video. Are you blind? lol
---
Definitely this, you can do 52-60 just farming pre-BIS in dungeons.
---
 Melee with shaman will always out dps an extra 100 so on 3 melee
---
&gt;Telling people how to take screenshots. 
---
&gt;Takes screenshots with their phone. 
---
What?
---
"No Changes !!"
---
By AFK-botting in AV
---
Before classic even launched in August there were huge threads about 1.12 AV and the issues it would cause, this is not a case of rejecting something you asked for
---
You're crazy if you think there's 0 skill or experience involved.
---
I can smell you through this post
---
While you are correct as well, /u/Antani101 is correct too. Every single first iteration of an expansion patch to grace the live servers has been called a pre-patch.
---
&gt; And 2.0 brought about the TBC changes, minus the TBC zones and content. Making it the TBC patch
---
That is correct. The difference is that while those things came with it the actual content itself is blocked until the actual launch and the actual launch patch happens, which usually includes more changes.
---
Same, got a few friends and a lot of guildies who only raid log now thanks to Phase 2.
---
I'm not aware of any addon that optimizes group composition. You've just gotta have to take into account the buffs available to your specific group and do it manually.
---
&gt;It can be acquired before stepping foot in MC and will easily generate enough aggro for 95% of guilds
---
The same is true of lobo
---
is sleipnir one of the mythical horses? sounds familiar
---
Wtf? It's Alt+F4 to screenshot
---
Roll a tank class, never had that problem.
---
Wait bots? In wow? How does thst work and how did you "break" one?
---
Most expensive class to gear well, you need stuff like Lionheart Helm to be bis. If you don't care about raid performance it can be however cheap or expensive you like. Ideally your guild would help out with getting you decked out since geared DPS warriors are so insanely above the rest and have the biggest impact on raid clear times.
---
We do not speak of the dark times.
---
Loool, druids are the fastest levelers in the game apart from hunters and mages who aoe farm. Zero downtime, great dmg since they are not gear reliant and you can take on multiple enemies with ease, AND you run fast from lvl 21 with feline swiftness AND even faster after 30. If you are not fast on your druid you are doing something wrong :-)
---
Who is complaining? grenades are fine, not even related to the post... i posted this for visibility and wondering just how much it will need to be abused before they attempt any sort of fix
---
&gt; the devs could only find a 1.12 reference anyway
---
Uhhh... look harder?  Maybe just down the fucking hallway at the Retail devs, because they sure as shit managed to find it.  It's in Retail ***right now*** for the anniversary event.
---
Benediction represent!
---
Peek.
---
I'm pretty certain that Blizzard hotfixed that.
---
Recklessness happened on a pvp server.
---
pepelaugh
---
Well, the color looked strange to me first. But you’re right.
---
To add on to Crixxious great information: I'm the guild leader of a guild with rougly 60-70 unique members and we run one raid team. 
---
Here's some screenshots of the Discord server I have set up, it works very well for everything we need: https://imgur.com/a/LmOdzuk
---
I have the #new-users channel only visible to officers. Officers set roles for guild members or guests and then channels are opened to users based on those roles. Guild members can also set roles in the #role-assignment channel which unlocks the class channels. For role management, I use this bot: YAGPDB.xyz. 
---
We have a music-voice channel so that people can listen to music while voice chatting. So the bot can be controlled easily, it only reads #music-bot-spam and can only join the music-voice channel. We use Rythm Bot and give members the DJ role.
---
We have fun channels like #streams and #screenshots and then we take care of business in #raid-info(strats, bis lists, consumables), #raid-attendance(last minute adjustments), #events(sign up sheets for weekly raids, bgs, farming, etc.) and #logs(public guild logs for MC and Onyxia). 
---
I hope this has given you some ideas you can work with, good luck building your server. ^.^
---
Our main tank that has bindings lives in DM:E, easy as a tank, get a healer and a dps and let one have the herbs and another have all the blues. They also get felcloth/ess of water/ dark runes along the way. You just res the rtv’s
---
Oh no
---
LF invite, warrior tank
---
"OH, a bullshit artist. Did you bullshit last week? No. Did you TRY to bullshit last week? Yes."
---
Pretty narrow minded to say that when a lot of us came back to classic specifically for the honor system and the reward of gearing through it.
---
97.2 best perf avg, wear two t1 and two t2, no greens ever, play SM Ruin and stack hit / crit AMA
---
the belt is amazing. sp, hit and stats. btw locks will never top any metre in classic. NEVER. seems like you don't know what you are talking about.
---
They didn’t delay the keyring like that they were releasing it like vanilla back in the day
---
Plugging kurrinaxx too. There’s a clear horde lean in total server pop, but at 60 alliance has like 6 of the top 10 guilds.
---
&gt; rewards do reflect effort. 
---
But only if you play as many games as the bots &amp; phone warriors... which is nearly impossible.
---
lmao sure guy
---
Some stuff in the ToC about Cloud-Services not being allowed + iffy blue posts that lean towards not using it.
---
I was more asking if there was an addon that lets you move members around within the raid as the leader.
---
But what is there after that what is the longevity after that point?
---
Ah just like you could infer with context what I meant in the original comment.
---
If you want people to take you seriously, dont be so condescending.
---
Wait, he IS in searing gorge too? I thought he was only in Tanaris, and that the second part of the ransom letter was a fake threat. Very good to know, thanks!
---
I had the same question. You can use 1 / week on Majordomo,  but that’s nowhere near this!
---
You can make any comp work in 5s to get to 1850. Just requires a decent strategy and reasonable skill.
---
The pvp is fine, it's the incentive that's fucking broken.
---
Yeah, 100%. 😁
---
For PvE? PvP? 
---
Most people only put 21 points in destruction for Ruin, then put the rest of their points in Affliction for Shadow Mastery or into Demonology for Demonic Sacrifice.
---
It sure is!
---
No. You've decided how everyone should play the game, and basically threw a fit when they didn't agree.
---
Casuals
---
Right, it’s barely Better than paineeaver. It’s not worth taking over a rogue.
---
The belt is garbage. Mana Cord is 100000x better. You need to get off WoWhead and actually play.
---
Wrong this is 1.12 av... Tbc added tower buff to stop the zerg games somewhat. But this is classic 1.12 av. That being said bring back 1.5 av.
---
Put dots on his dogs wink wink
---
Haha , I hope so :D
---
Yeah but how do you know it's an accurate recreation and not something they just approximated
---
Fair call.
---
The people that rely on Bis lists, never understand bis lists
---
When you operate in a bad system, it's not necessarily the operator to be blamed, but the system itself. The operator certainly bears some responsibility, but the creator of the system with broken incentives is the architect of the suffering.
---
Aren't all AVs solo queue lol
---
Dude we just had ANOTHER OEB off Golemagg. And still no ingot in 8+ clears. The chances of 3 OEB in a row off Golemagg is .0015625% this shit is unreal. We are definitely switching who forms raids.
---
Your second sentence is a disaster
---
Yeah at dire maul, but then they delayed it 2 more times
---
I mean, the zerg is the group of people that rush to the last boss. You didn't use any words incorrectly, imo.
---
Honestly you sound like you don't have many friends.
---
&gt;This version of AV was introduced very late in vanilla
---
This trivializes the rest of your post
---
Not really. Right now, you have enough options to substitute other hit gear with better stuff so 22 AP and 1% hit will always be superior to everything else you can get on a ranged weapon.
---
I hope I'm that lucky lol
---
nub mistake
---
A guy on my server got a temp ban for afking 5 times.
---
https://youtu.be/8VWzjeTYrqY
---
There you go, made it a while back when messing  about waiting for that stupid Rod to drop. Who knew it'd come in handy! I levelled pretty much like that, didn't need to use half the cooldowns but it's fun, and there were people (pvp server) around. Just use BF+evasion, or BF+AR, or whatever you feel is needed for the situation. Don't need to use cooldowns it's just faster/more efficient for staying at higher hp.
---
That's a 50 dkp minus
---
No thanks, end of 40 mans and start of warfare epics and hyper inflation,
---
They don't, lmao.
---
AV rep and honor rank rewards are pretty solid now for pvp gear, and more and more people are finishing out tier 1 from raid which is likely better than most green BOES.  The population is shifting to post-raid 60 and higher pvp rank over time and fewer and fewer greens are appealing. 
---
A few specific frost/shadow wrath slots are still worth a lot of money, maybe +healing hat, but I suspect that's about it.  I bought a few "of the eagle" fill-in pieces when wpvp first dropped so I could pick up some sustain for pvp, but got rid of them all as I got another couple tier 1/2 drops and more pvp rewards.
---
Large servers in general are like big cities. You would not know anybody when you first move, or even if you did know some people you won't form deep bonds right away. It takes time and effort from both sides. 
---
Classic has only been out for a few months. In that time my husband and I joined a large (700+ players) raiding guild, which at first felt really overwhelming. After hundreds of hours of playing together and chatting randomly on discord, It feels like much more of a community.
---
I understand why you would say that but it's wrong:-)
---
Ok but what if the warriors fury prot. Him having more aggro let's everyone dps harder
---
Just wanted to say, you're a piece of shit for that.
---
She played a dwarf warrior, but you don't have to believe me.
---
Consider this though, the pool of people that can play premades 12+ hours a day is incredibly small (especially back then). You don't really have the available numbers to choose the best of the best.
---
What can I instance farm at 56? I stopped leveling due to the boredom.

no its drakedog whats yours
---
Leveling a warrior right now, level 17 so far. About to start doing loads of dungeons.
---
Which are the best dungeons to repeat for fast XP as alliance? I'm not meaning AoE cleave and all that, regular pugs
---
Dude I had one that resisted this much as a mage with 91% hit. It's awful.
---
Guess you can stroll around with /pvp. Not sure you’ll be yanked often though.
---
If they changed AV to the old version where turtles were far more prone to happen this wouldn't be an issue
---
I know people are using it to leech honor/rep in av (they move every few minutes to keep themselves from going afk).
---
What's up blameux I'm maeby cow drood
---
I felt exactly the opposite. Moved to a PvE server (rerolled) and the community is just much more present there.
---
In PvP, it seems like everyone just wants to be better than the others. Now, in PvE, I feel like people want to enjoy things together.
---
These almost 2 seconds of priest backpeddling made me gouge out my eyes so I haven't seen the rest.
---
I main a rogue and only play 10-15 hours a week. Clearer MC weekly for a couple of months at least. I’d recommend farming as much of the mats yourself. Farm the Jujus in winter spring instead if strength potions. You can farm the furbolgs for jujus and winter fall firewater two birds one stone. I’m also herb and farm my own mats for all the other potions in my spare time. Raiding only takes 3 hours one night a week.
---
2.0 only unfortunately
---
DM, stocks groups are okay, since they form fast and people arrive promptly.  SM groups are good for xp.  i think ZF is better than ulda, and good for a while.  BRD is good because it has a lot of gear.   just my opinion though!
---
Thanks this is the kind of info I'm looking for.
---
Ideas to copy lol.
---
Guy offers help with screenshots and uploads a photo of his screen... an I bring whooshed or..
---
Don't overthink it. 5 people can do up to rend, after that, you kinda need more. The packs from the beast benefit from cc, but sap sheep sleep trap all work. Raid geared healer can heal all, if the tank have plate instead of dps gear. That said, final trash packs and drakki require more than 2 dps, so 5 man won't cut it.
---
2 weeks in a row we’ve had OEB drop from both bosses
---
We have had 6 MB drops and one staff of dom
---
Thanks! We don't have a guild bank alt yet, but is a nice idea.
---
Love it!
---
Scepter is nice but its honestly only better in certain scenarios compared to Fang+Orb which you get passively.
---
2 tanks, 2 heals, 6 DPS
---
Welcome to RNG
---
like rep grind actually matters though. everyone will eventually get exalted. it will make 1 week grind into 3 week grind at worst. not a big deal compared to what we are talking about here.
---
My fave is the split between galv and Drek, with several people saying galv is auto loss and several saying drek Zerg is auto loss. 
---
The real truth is the winning strategy is the whole raid doing the same thing. When 15 go Drek and 15 go galv and 10 go jerk off in harpie cave its a loss.
---
lol what
---
By moving from PvP to PvE, you took what was a roller coaster, with its highs, lows, ups and downs and changed it into a flat line static nothing unexpected ever happens ride. . .  BORING!
---
PvP servers make you mad, pissed, they also have you jumping out of your chair saying "Yeah MOTHERF!@#! HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT S!@#" when you get the drop on someone who has been ganking you or when the calvary rolls in and saves your butt while decimating the opposite faction.
---
No PvE no way not ever for me. I'll take the rollercoaster ride over the boomer bus tour any day.
---
2 tanks 2 heals and 6DPS. 
---
Maybe a hunter or lock and a mage rest do not really matter. 
---
Hunter to help kite last boss OR lock to 1 tank to tank boss and 1 add and fear bomb the other add till after Boss is dead. 
---
NOTE: you will need to clear the whole room for last boss if you fear bomb. 
---
CC assassins as they tend to gouge the tank and then murder a clothy 😖
---
Just go back to Retail
---
Yeah should be easy. Did it with rogue/mage combo
---
3 dropped in 2h time period. First two dropped back to back. Super lucky!
---
This is the correct answer. I recommend running Scholo with a 3 man team instead of 5. I do this with lock, mage, priest and we have enough DPS and CC to efficiently move through the dungeon and we get significantly more loot, scourage stones, and Skin of Shadows this way. TBH, it’s actually a super easy dungeon. I’m sure there are other 3-man comps that will work well too, so long as you have something to deal with the magic immune skele’s before Ras.
---
I’m sitting on ~50 scourage stones and don’t feel like I’ve run the dungeon more than 10 times or so.
---
Most of bracket 1 players have a dedicated group of "friends" they can farm afk in between queues.
---
Sometimes no healers.
---
You get 8 action bars with bartender, that’s more then enough.
---
Just copy pasta each trinket macro change the name.
---
I hated the pop up menu for item rack.
---
Was way easier just hitting my macro key bond.
---
Yes, that's pretty much from where we started, but is intresting to see how other people manage their discords. I'm sure a lot of people have better ideas than what we got and we can learn/copy from them.
---
I agree with a lot or what you are saying but you are straight up wrong. Most av games are long and shit now that horde just turtles. Wsg premades can easily do well over 10k honor/h and you won't get near that as an av afker.
---
Whats a warfront?
---
Hahahah you are right. I am embarrassed. Having full time job and pulling those numbers is weak.
---
All shoulder enchants come from AD rep.  And they only provide +5 resistance.  Revered let’s you get +5 resistance to a single school and Exalted let’s you get +5 to all schools.
---
The books provide enchants to Head and Legs, and are unrelated to Argent Dawn.
---
Yes, the Argent Dawn shoulder enchants are BiS until phase 4, but that’s because they are the only option.  If you are tanking MC, rushing revered to get 5 fire res for shoulders might be worth it, but otherwise it’s probably better to take your time with it and prioritize other upgrades.
---
For acrually gaining rep, run Scholo.  Save all your scourgestone hands in until you hit revered (since most mobs stop giving rep then).  Also try to save any quests that give AD rep until then too.    Scholo gives ~14 opportunities for Corrupter Scourgestones and about 300-500 rep per run.
---
This is not a 1 VS 4. You had support from the tower that were shooting allies And keeping them in combat while you tried to kill them, one by one. At most it’s a 2v1 and even that is generous. What you did wasn’t special. You’re not special. 3/10 good day sir “Later bitch”
---
While you probably wouldn't get banned, in all honesty they could ban you for account sharing if they detected it and you wouldn't be able to do much about it. Kind of hard to prove it was always you on the other end, ya know?
---
exploiting the terrain to sit in safe spots where the guards can't reach you.
---
Lol
---
i just resubbed to wow, I'll join n\_n
---
If there’s nothing saying it’s a bug, it’s probably not a bug.  Part of the fun of WoW is how players use the system to their advantage. 
---
It’s a question of wether or not other players suffer or not, and here it’s win/win
---
I’ll never tell
---
warriors already go around globaling people without r14. i got globaled by a warrior the other night because he had sweeping strikes up and i was standing next to his target, lol.
---
Even if he pops a mana pot every run it's still a net positive in gold gained. He can run it ad infinitum as long as the AH has mana pots.
---
/cast [@mouseover,harm][] Blind
---
Replace Blind with Gouge, Sap and Kick (also Pickpocket). Note that if you use these macros on a non-primary target that you will lose combo points. This macro can still Blind, Gouge, Sap or Kick your main target and you won't lost combo points. 
---
You can also add /stopattack on the Gouge/Sap macro (for main target use).

Nah alliance can do premades because of instant que.
---
Especially on fights where mages are decursing. Who's doing better, the mage with a 90% parse or the mage with a 20% parse because he's doing all the decursing because the rest are neglecting their duties to pad their parses.
---
As a fan of classic, there were a lot of reasons vanilla sucked and this is one of them.  Nothing you can do.
---
Even in Classic?
---
You can’t “easily compete” for r14 because of AV. It might be true that you can more easily compete for r10 or something thanks to AV, but if you can do AV 140 hours per week without botting or afking I am pretty confident you can find a friend or two to play warsong with.
---
That joke was for me tbh but I'm glad you like it lol.
---
Ironic that this is a picture of a monitor.
---
Maybe on your realm. That was the nice thing about vanilla, every realm was its own little ecosystem.
---
Lol careful there, there's a lot of people here on Reddit that legitimately think mage and rogue are mechanically difficult classes to pvp with
---
Certainly depends on how it's handled. In retail WoW I like the achievements as essentially just timestamps of when I did what. Interesting to look at it and be like "Wow, I didn't do this dungeon for like a week after the previous? That's weird."
---
I don’t know if you even play on Fairbanks, but it (was?) 100% one sided. It would take 30+ minutes to corpse walk into BRM. Very rarely would alliance have the upper hand anywhere outside Dire Maul and even then, it was horde controlled majority of the time as well.
---
Horde deserve every bit of the disaster that server is becoming. So many people quit because of it.
---
Yikes, that actually makes it a tougher call.  I think I'd lean towards the root though
---
Exactly. Any strat is a winning strat if the team can agree one a single plan of action and commit. If everyone is saying go Galv then just roll with and go Galv that game. The worst is when 1-2 people demand everyone conform to their strat and end up splitting the raid.
---
If the group is geared a Rogue kiting works just fine. You don't need a ton of time with Drakk out of the room and as long as you can get him at least across the bridge before vanishing you should be golden. I've had to do it multiple times a few different ways.
---
Right?
---
I’m kinda confused by your post. What are you asking? If you’re 60 and have pre bis you can raid log which will work playing 15 hours a week. That’s what I did on my warrior. Just raid logged. Played about 6 hours a week on that guy. 
---
Playing 15 hours a week as a warrior and trying to get to 60? That’s going to take you a very long time. Probably 2-3 months if you’re at level 32 now. Once you hit level 45 the grind gets much longer per level.
---
As a kid I repurposed an old keyboard, a clock, and some wires as an antiafk machine that made me jump every minute overnight. Back then AVs lasted for like a day.
---
I never played vanilla, but I've watched enough videos and played with enough people to know that high end raids will be challenging for a while. Elite guilds might clear it, but your average guild is going to struggle as fights get more complex.
---
Faction?
---
Maybe horde have lower amounts of honour because of the queues?
---
and a partridge in a pear tree?
---
Pve at least dont do that. Memes or pvp then go for it.
---
Yea it stopped working and im thrilled! I always had to go in and end process when starting classic, the gamebar takes up precious system resources!
---
dude its not an 1vs4 to gank 4 riding pve allys sorry.
---
Fuck the alliance
---
It’s not netting more dps being there. It’s a wasted talent point either way.
---
Fix retail or gimme another mmorpg
---
+1 for Dexter’s Lab.
---
Eh they know theyre lying to themselves.
---
Spam scholo and save your turn ins until you are 1/2 into revered.
---
Then do your quests in EPL and WPL. 
---
Make sure you use your insignia. 
---
We needed lots of gear from that dungeon for tanks DPS and heals from quests and drops. 
---
A few of us got exalted a week after hitting 60 from running it 2-3 time per day.
---
You just need two heals and two tanks. But sometimes 1 tank is enough. You really just need an OT for the last boss. 
---
I think the most important thing is getting two heals and a hunter to kite.
---
Omg his last week makes my head hurt. And then he is repeating it this week. WHYYYYYYYYY!!
---
He hasnt killed enough players for his honor to matter. YOU HAVE TO have a certain amount of HKs for you to enter the ranking pool. - This guy... fucking hell.
---
I mean they could restart it following the same timeline as this first go round. Or they could do the easiest thing and upgrade to tbc. Tbh it would be cool if the went through wrath then chronormu shows up and is like... wait a minute... we’re not making that mistake again and pushes her red button again.
---
Clearly not solo.
---
Yeah, my biggest motivation for playing classic is naxx progression, it's the one thing I didn't get to do in vanilla before TBC came out.
---
how do the bots not get banned regularly?  Back in vanilla my friends and i all created 2 separate accounts that we used as Bots.  We ran the bots for 1 week, got the characters to like lvl 25 and then got those accounts banned.
---
Maybe it was because we were all logging into the same accounts from different IP's? but i don't get how in 2019, 14 years later they aren't getting banned as quickly as 2005?
---
Guess so.
---
&gt;While you probably wouldn't get banned, in all honesty they could ban you for account sharing if they detected it and you wouldn't be able to do much about it. Kind of hard to prove it was always you on the other end, ya know?
---
Totally. It seems like quite a toss-up
---
I was gonna say rogue too but I've only tried it once to mixed success.
---
Yet you still used your phone..
---
You know my life? You know everything that goes on?
---
You do you you jealous little shit.
---
I will continue to be better than you.
---
They release along with BWL iirc
---
Want to buy tbc pre patch honor system.
---
This honor system is garbage. Everyone's arguing about afkers in AV but that's a symptom of the real problem.  Which is that the honor system is hot garbage.
---
The hell are you talking about?
---
Obviously Allies prefer to win, but if there is Horde resistance, and Allies already got all the LTs and Commanders down -- they want the game to be over ASAP. That's why we will rush to kill Drek (which ends the game), all hide in a mine, or /afk. At least that's what the coordinated honor grinding groups will do.
---
Such a loss is still about 2700 honor, which is more than acceptable if the game didn't last too long.
---
This. My wife falls asleep every day around 23h. That's when i play, from 23h to 2h/3h so it's almost 3 hours a day and i still have a job from 9 to 6, workout like a maniac and have tons of social activities.
---
As an elemental shaman I am still amazed that mages have like 3 or 4 different instant-cast dmg-spells while everything I do gets either counterspelled or CCd or pushed-back to infinity.
---
I solo’d it on my priest. Just spec shadow, go to the entrance where there’s melee mobs and the pillar. Swp the mob and have it keep chasing you around the pillar until it dies. Only took me a few hours back when I did it.
---
We kicked one guy because he was a neo nazi, two mages left cause they didn't get priority on mageblade.
---
Seems like I'm missing out compared to you other guys.
---
Yeah but that wasn't how it was. If Blizzard starts changing too much it won't really be classic WoW. It'll be retailified classic wow. Now I like retail pvp, and retail in general but I still want the games to be different. Classic should be a reminder of what we had and how it was back then, all the flaws and perks included.
---
We decided to stay too unless the balance gets too bad. Phase 2 was not fun for a lot of us with not being in a huge guild. Good luck in your guild search.
---
Like I said, I know it's scummy. But I have found a work around and I'm going to do it so I don't fall too far behind in RP.
---
I think the vast majority of people would love to see places like: Hyjal, Karazan Crypts, Aszara and various other locations completed, I think the majority of players want TBC at this point.
---
The lack of the arena, leaves competitive pvpers out in the cold. Majority of specs are meme-tier and get incredible strength in TBC. As well, it gives even non-raiders something more to do (heroic dungeons, dailies, etc).
---
Sleep doesn't work does it? I think it did back in 15 man but I have been in groups where druids tried sleeping in classic and it didn't work.
---
I haven't done AV's yet (this decade), waiting to level to 60).
---
What are the argument's about? I have a feeling everyone would try to bring a PVE mindset, min-max to what is a fundamentally fluid and dynamic exercise. e.g., The enemies response will dictate your response and is variable.
---
Or is it just like - "you're a newb if you don't rush Drek, leav plz!"
---
Name just one.
---
&gt;*10 go jerk off in harpie cave*
---
As a Horde I know where I'm rushing from now on...
---
&gt;20 percent drop rate
---
&gt;"only 2 in 8 clears"
---
Am I missing something?
---
One xp to rule them all, and one xp to grind them. One ding to bring them all, and in mom's basement bind them.
---
Warfront has 0 PvP afaik. There are no players from the opposite faction fighting against you in a warfront. If they changed this since bfa release then my bad.
---
My casual PvP experience has been one of utter defeat, with the Alliance badly losing every single match I've played. There's no coordination at all lol
---
He called it a meme tank weapon, which is objectively stupid. It’s also better than Lobo, and does not have a proc that takes up a debuff slot.
---
+5 to all resist is a very very marginal upgrade relative to the time investment. You definitely dont want to have 0 because then you are in the No resist category, but for PvP if you are just in the poor category vs no resist category that can make all the difference.
---
in other words going from 0-&gt;5 resist is huge
---
but going from 5-&gt;10 is not a big deal.
---
When Zg comes out, probably around march-april? there is significantly better shoulder enchants available, that is another reason i dont bother with argent dawn rep.
---
What class are you too? If i was melee id be more concerned about my shadow and frost resist, 
---
If you were a caster you might be more concerned with some arcane resist too for mage counter silence.
---
I play a warlock so I dont worry about most mages, I put +armor on my cape because Im more concerned about surviving a rogues stunlock
---
Also in naxx there is even better shoulder enchants that drop from saph.
---
Follow a guide, seriously.
---
I levelled from 1 to 30 without it and i lost SO much time in useless stuff. Some quests are waste of times, what the guide tells you is what are the best quests in terms of xp/gold and they also optimize your travelling. Tbh, i'm pretty sure i was faster from 30 to 60 than i was from 1 to 30 lol
---
&gt;Half of your team is AFK 
---
People complained about how easy it was to kick people from BG's (premades were abusing it the first few seconds into a BG to free up spots).  Blizzard nerfed it, now it's near impossible to get an afker booted from a BG.
---
Make up your fucking minds Reddit, or try to use some critical thinking skills to predict one step into the future.
---
OP - this is the best answer right here. There is NO NEED for two tanks at any point until you get to Drak's room.   I would say as long as you put Shaman with WF in the melee group then you are all set on group comps.
---
Let’s see you do better
---
Makes sense the pansy alliance complain
---
Allies should not defend if they want to max their honor per hour. If the rush fails -- lose ASAP. Prolonging the game is bad business.
---
Waste your time and now have two people not participating in the BG, nice.
---
Ah sure, I suppose. I was more getting at there are no server battlegroups.
---
I honestly feel like life tap is an ESSENTIAL skill for warlocks to get decent at, if not master over time. In less stressful situations it allows you to convert cloth/bandages into mana, which is a pretty good trade. And in general it's an excellent source of mana for the class. Mages have conjured water, priests can benefit from spirit, paladins can use blessing of wisdom, etc, but warlocks benefit a lot from managing life tap, and usually them trading health for mana is just fine, as either their demon will tank or they'll have a player tank most of the time.
---
No mageblade, no bindings...
---
4 staff of dom, 4 toep, 4 ring of spellpower, 4 OEB, 1 BRE
---
Exactly. A decked hunter joined my guild the other day. He even has quick strike ring, like imagine loosing that as a warrior or rogue because you got outbid but a hunter who just ended up Gquitting a couple weeks later
---
29 is pretty twink heavy.
---
Modern problems require modern solutions.
---
You and u/umpb are both right and the others are also not wrong.
---
Mage is probably the class with both the lowest skill floor and highest skill ceiling.   
---
You can't tell me the Trigz guy in Perplexity's duel videos isn't very skilled and really uses the whole skill set.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NENsoOaM7xc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NENsoOaM7xc) (stats at 12:24 and is awesome to behold).
---
In Vanilla, though, the difference between being in a skilled WSG premade and pugging or solo-queuing was massive.
---
This resulted in quite a few things, but most notably it reduced the total time investment at the top, since you were only competing against other premades, with whom you basically had gentleman’s agreements on what your target honor would be.
---
Because of the above, server communities arose around PvP.  Everyone doing the grind knew everyone else, and with the good came the bad.  If someone was a bad actor, though, the PvP community would respond, so there were real in-game consequences to not working together with your fellow PvP rankers.
---
None of that exists with AV honor grind (from Horde at least).  You queue solo.  There is no community.  Everyone competes against everyone else.  The only factor that matters at all is total time invested.
---
Does leaving AV through the portal in the tunnel take you to Alterac Mountains? Or back to wherever you first joined the queue?
---
GM and RL had some issues, RL ends up leaving taking about 20+ people from our raidteam. We finally got to the 2h MC sweet spot the week prior, so it was kind of a kick in the nuts.
---
Stuck around in that guild for about 1 month maybe a month and a half, GM wanted us to start logging our raids because somehow people despite having 5/8 t1 and such absolutely sucked ass. Worst thing was that our GM said that their lack of dps was because they were lootmasters, so they had to handle the loot. Which doesnt make any fucking sense when i mainly looked at boss meters, no one gives a shit about trash. So seeing a mage thats pretty much decked out end up being 10+ on the meters, when most was underperforming or worse geared made me somewhat confused.
---
after the gm started to get more and more bitchy and the guild started to go backwards i decided it was time to leave, we might have had 65 ish lvl 60´s but it sure as hell didnt feel like it when we had to pug 15+ people every single raid.
---
It’s useless for PVE
---
Top of the cart near GY, you can use range attacks to smash them, and the tunnel, same idea range should be able to hit them.
---
As for practicing them, you can download an emulator and host it locally, and run it. Mangos is the wow emulator core, even if nothing else is scripted, as long as yuo have the terrain you should be able to practice terrain jumps.

That's what always struck me, people who complain about LC being exploited/toxic are in the kind of guild where any distribution system would be exploited/toxic. 
---
If people are manipulating and acting like snakes over LC you think they wouldn't be fiddling DKP, forming cabals, or buying rolls and passes?
---
An ideal group of fresh 60s is 2 tanks 2 healers and 3 melee, a hunter and 2 mages for poly in some of the packs after The Beast and before Drakk. Youd also want one of your healers to be a shaman for WF if you're horde because you're likely to have a shit load of melee in your runs. 
---
A run of people that are fairly pre-raid bis for a full run would be the same as mentioned above except you can solo tank drakk. 
---
Mages can kite drakk too but hunters are best
---
You cant screenshot the loading screen... can you?
---
DM east jump runs with a buddy or make a mage/hunter/warlock alt. Youre playing a class with 0 utility and an extremely limited tool kit relative to other classes.

Just wait until BC and Wrath when you need to have a stupid amount of tokens to buy gear.
---
Well after launch I found an old post from one of my vanilla guild members saying that a bunch of people from the guild had plans to form up and start raiding again in classic together. I ended up transferring over to their server after finding it with hopes of joining up with them, but was alittle hesitant at first because the person in question was someone I was never very fond of back in the day because he was alittle pompous and domineering. I always felt like he was divisive and bad for the health of the guild, despite him being our raid leader and one of the most competent people we had. 
---
Well come to find out after joining up that shortly after the guild formed, said player lead a schism and took half the OG players and left. Everyone seems pretty sore about it so I haven't bothered to ask what happened quite yet, but knowing the person in question, I can pretty easily guess what all went down. I had a good laugh about it.

---
But how can you then get angry someone is countering your griefing.
---
Rate my setup for our small guild?
---
I am a co-admin of a small discord that has been going strong with around 15 to 20 active members for over 2 years now. Since most of us have started playing Classic, I setup a section for our guild. I know there is more that I can do and tons of options using bots, but I like to really think things over and only make small changes that are spaced out (Mostly because there is many members that throw fits every time a change is made).

So I have our discord set so that when people join they can only Text chat or Join voice chat channels without the permission to speak. A server admin has to add the "Recruit" role before that can speak in voice chat or post links and stuff in text chat.
---
The "Bulletin Board" Text channel where only I can post stuff, because most people don't use the "Pins" feature in channels and will never see pinned posts. I have been using Discord for around 2 years now and nobody ever is aware of what stuff gets pinned.
---
I was talking about rerolling as alliance
---
Faster honor gain = everyone is getting more honor, therefore the brackets are brutal.
---
Last week, 1.3 mil was top spot on my server.
---
He is stuck in scrub land. Pve cant go to a pvp server
---
I can.
---
Grats ;)
---
That's not necessarily a problem though. I was in a guild with my RL friends. We all kinda played at a different pace, but there were generally enough people in each other's level range to play together.
---
And yeah, slowly people started losing interest until just a core of 6 people were left. Phase 2 then dropped and made 2 more ppl quit. I didn't play for 2 weeks because of it.
---
When I came back, 2 ppl had joined different guilds so it was really just me and 1 other friend. We decided to join another guild together.
---
So where am I going with this? Well, people leaving doesn't matter, because we did actually play together and had a lot of fun lvling. So that guild was more than worth it. Now that it's no longer active, the active players just found their own guilds that suit our needs.
---
Shadow is so sick. I really don't understand the new wave of priests killing things with holy fire, sw:p and wand- are people affraid they won't be able to heal in dungeons or something?
---
Why 15?
---
Can only compete with bots and afk if ques are instant in my past experiences of grinding r14
---
for destruction. Conflag build. I've been mulling on 39 points but imp. searing pain seems like wasted slots when I could get the 10% to daze instead. Alternatively I could drop it to 34 and get master summoner or Nightfall instead, leaning on Demo because I like the improved tank stats more than anything.
---
currently 5/7/39 and it works OK for most content but I don't like taking so long to summon demons.
---
Not really. Sure WSG there is a huge difference in rep gain between winning and losing, however as a solo player relying on PUGs winning is basically out of question.
---
So the only way to grind rep is to painstakingly collect the 29 rep for losing.(11 rep from losing the BG + 18 rep for 1 mark including human rep bonus)
---
So being farmed by a horde pre-made is actually best case. Getting into a struggle between your alliance PUG vs. a horde PUG is worst case.
---
Even if you win, it's hardly worth the additional time it takes
---
As a hordie that usually pushes for my AV to wipe the initial Alli train past Balinda, how do you guys manage to get your players to go Left or Right of Belinda at the start?
---
What's server average as alliance?
---
Okay, so...anyone can do AV, my man. If you want, you can do AV. 
---
Secondly, if you care about honor, you are either in such a clique or you are wasting your time. Seriously, there's only so much room at the top. If you're not no-lifing endlessly, top ranks are not in your future. Giving up is a very good idea if you are not willing to embrace pvp over all else. This is my path. Rank 3 is easy, and gets you that delightful discount. Basically zero work needs to be put in to get/maintain this. Dungeon runs, rep...honestly those will give you more reliable rewards than honor for the most part. Go max all those things, and let the sweaty folks be "first" and slowly fall off the lists.
---
That sucks man.  Sorry to hear that. Vanilla wow guilds are tough to maintain, so many people are required, and keeping them all happy is tough.
---
Hey I raid with this guy. His mic is trash.
---
Why try hard? Vanilla raiding is basically easy mode
---
You can mindcontrol the npc with a ally priest alt or gnomish mind control cap, kill him when he re spawns you can drop a new head
---
Retail WoW “PvP” zone introduces in BFA.  You solo queue into a zone from a major city with 40 other random people.  You all work to gather materials to “build” base components  that produce npc units (think Warcraft 3).  The end goal is to destroy the enemy general.
---
I am playing both.
---
So mindcarver is a 1h sword with 2.0 speed from dm west, good sword and board option there.  On that note,  all paladin specs need to have a sword and board option. There will be times when you're oom and a fresh warrior pops up trynna get cheeky. Swap to ret aura, judge seal of light,  and hold tight.
---
The pvp gear set offers some sp set effect, t2 is obviously long term goal,  but aside from there,  use a database like wow head to look through high level mail/plate dungeon blues with sp. 
---
Also yes. SoC is important. To you want a slow,  big 2h. I highly recommend blackhand doomsaw from ubrs. Most people don't roll on it, but it has big damage,  3.5 speed, and a on hit wound that can crit for an unreasonable amount of damage.
---
So Horde our strat has turned into kill all lieutenants; captains, etc. even if we loose; we get 3600 honor. We may not win; but we win honor wise. Adding a defense gives you much more rep in a 20 min game minus a two 10. (Even when doubled.) 
---
But there’s a balance of D enough to slow; and then all Zerg boss.
---
What’s that horse piss you’re drinking there - Keystone Lite?
---
Obviously you do give enough shit to reply twice already. Think about it
---
Horrigan was the laughing stock of my server in TBC, then left.
---
A friend got some personal insight into what his real life is like and dude's a nutcase.
---
Not surprising to see he's still at it.
---
Aoe spam, lots of cold cones and ice blocks, dancing in the dead zone. Seems like every other mage pvping, but Ill take your word for it.
---
Yah we just started talking about that in our server discord
---
&gt; In Vanilla, though, the difference between being in a skilled WSG premade and pugging or solo-queuing was massive. 
---
I agree, I wish it was better but it's not not. This is because of AV giving so much honor when done correctly. For horde it is simply not worth doing WSG yet, and since blizzard somehow broke horde AV premading, soloqueuing is the only method for horde and thus you can't outfarm people.
---
You were jumping to conclusions by assuming I was trying to undermine you
---
But thanks for the affirmation that I was right.
---
Hahahahaha leftover bud light from a party lol
---
finding "a friend or two" won't give you nearly enough honor as a full premade will. And yes , playing with the same 10 people for more then 14 hours every single day ... in the current toxic PvP enviroment is WAY harder then simply queuing all day and only beeing restricted by yourself
---
And it’s quickly becoming pve. This is literally my first post talking about the imbalance and that’s simply because how disingenuous the OP is regarding the server health. I feel bad for any alliance being duped into transferring here. 
---
But to each their own.
---
You're going far enough to use a reasonable criteria for LC and then make people roll? That would seriously rile me up - to be judged worthy of winning an item then to lose it to RNG. Maybe multiple times.
---
You don't need 40 people for a premade. We usually roll with around 10. It's enough to coordinate basic things like killing LT's or holding a specific point. You're a bit more exposed to the randomness of pug AV's but even at 10.. that's 25% of the raid working together - its not that bad
---
Ask your sister while she’s giving me a blumpkin feelsgoodman
---
That's not funny at all.
---
Fun crits to watch but there is nearly nothing justifying the sentence "1v4"...
---
You can 5 man until after rend. I usually take 1 Mt, 1 ot (for after rend, only needed for last boss and certain mob packs), 2 healers that are 60, 2 rdps(hunter or mage for last boss kite) fill rest with whatever you want.
---
That is...a lot. With that much FR, you will be hurting your DPS fairly heavily. 
---
I would suggest having one or two solid FR pieces that you can swap out, pre-enchanted, if there's a fight that needs them. But with pots, buffs, and incidental FR from pieces you get anyways, you probably will do fine. 100 FR is enough to noticeably slow fire damage coming in, and hurts your DPS far less badly.
---
[laughs in Retail IoC]
---
Horde warriors go Hamstring spec not slam spec. The only viable 2 hand spec for alliance is Slam.
---
People just say it and we all kinda just say ok because all people doing 1 plan is more effective
---
Im jealous youre horde after this AV experience
---
servers are balanced.  some servers are full horde, some servers are full alliance, and some servers are 50/50.  that's as perfect as you can get, everybody can pick what they want.
---
when you add crossrealm every realm becomes the same 60/40.  this is bad.
---
No changes but changes please
---
this is what i tried to express in op, but they are the biggest guild on the server by a long shot and there isn't a way "in".   They are either friends from retail or discord bum buddies. Plus the fact they are not very nice or welcoming and have this reputation widely.   About making my own, well they have a monopoly on the "back up" players they bring in whenever needed and these people wouldn't want to "step on their toes" by making their own premade
---
Haha 😂 
---
Yeah, they go pretty hard. I got a benediction my last raid, pretty excited about that!
---
There is absolutely no pvp in Warfronts.
---
You turtle
---
Agreed
---
Lol at calling u/crunkmoon a psychopath. You should probably take a step back from online discourse..
---
I find that crazy that there is such a faction imbalance overall.  I don't remember it existing, at least not to this extreme, during vanilla.
---
Awesome insight, thank you. Without running a premade and knowing you are playing against a competent Alliance opponent, those quick games are not guaranteed. But it is useful to see from the data that in the future, now that I don't need rep, if queue times are sufficiently short, then a quick loss can still be good for honor.
---
yeah that has become very apparent to me very quickly, although my original goal was rank 11 mount and stop.   I am definitely looking forward to BWL, put it that way
---
The honor grind getting past rank 10 isn't worth it guys.  Saw many guys post in the wow forums saying to get r14 you need to play 14-16 hours a day for 3 months in a row non stop.  
---
Hard pass.
---
pretty sure SoD, mageblade and gun have the highest drop rates of a loot group that is shared with many other drops. something like 20% chance for those 3, and 5% chance for the other 8. (60 + 40)
---
&gt;People who do things like that care more about other people liking them then actually being honestly kind, or bothering to get to know me.
---
How can you say that with 100% certainty? If someone's intent was to always congratulate or say hi back or whatever prerogative, why does making a macro suddenly negate that because it saves time? You act as if because some people are like that in seeking attention, that there's no way for any other possible motives. Tbh it seems like you're just projecting because you know fake nice all to well, maybe jaded by it in the past- but man not everyone is like that, I hate that you immediately think the worst of people for trying to please others.
---
To be fair, when we 60s already started to just flat out accept a "30 min dying your way into Blackrock" as added time requirement for any venture into BRS or BRD I can imagine how much worse it was for those &lt;60.
---
Especially as we had to burst their bubble that it would all somehow get better once they would ding 60. Man, we 60s were totally broken, we didn't even try to mount any kind of resistance anymore. just accepted our lot, stayed in IF and only died our way into dungeons.
---
this gives me hope and is probably the drive I need to collect a group of smaller players together as I think i have the foundations already (a group of pissed off people lol).   I was being pretty narrow minded was thinking I just needed a group as big as the others
---
Literally JUST Warmonger, the +3 hit lvl 47 sword, and otherwise all "of the bear" and I'm just wrecking mobs in seconds, often 2-3 at a time.  Oh and Warmonger was only like 15G on the AH, even someone without the funds could EASILY level a warrior if they could just stop complaining about it for 5 seconds..  But that's basically the entire point of this sub I think, to complain, mostly about how unfair horde is.
---
So I don't really know what this is supposed to demonstrate. How does this show your xp / hr over the course of 1-60?
---
I saw a Warrior and Mage bot in Arathi, and a Hunter in Shimmering flats. Hunter disappeared the night I reported him, mage stayed for a few days repeatedly circling near go'shek farm. Warrior got into a res' sickness loop. Killed him over and over again he insta ressed every time. Eventually ended up naked lol.
---
honestly who still skips galv
---
Yeah they can prededice loot before the raid to save time!
---
Full of shit.  Pvp to pve my ass.
---
Good question, one I'm not sure how to answer honestly. Before I hit 60, I was just really enjoying the leveling and my main goal was to hit 60. I haven't given much thought on what my end-game goal is... What kind of end game goals are there?
---
I am part of the Horde! Maybe it’s because of this. Anyway I will investigate this.
---
AV grind for rank 14 is quite a ways off, but I suppose there is still an end.
---
Lobo doesnt proc in MC check logs :)
---
&gt; Luckily after we got booted they changed their thinking on that and now are giving it to the main tank first.
---
I doubt that.
---
Because time investment in itself isn't something that should be rewarded. You don't just get handed epics by standing around in molten core doing nothing. It also makes the actual rewards feel worthless because they will be dominated by people who are account sharing / botting or managed to not die of boredom while sitting AFK in battlegrounds while watching netflix. Imagine if you could get to the highest "ranks" of any competitive game by just sitting AFK in every game, with 0 participation, we'd all agree that's broken, right?
---
Idk about yall but people on Horde are still pushing for a loss every game, it's like pulling teeth to get people to slow yall down. Also when a horde comes to wipe your train nearly 90% stay on mounts and just let dots or more AoE down the line kill them, I could see that being very infuriating to watch.

I'm doing that and getting the bargain enchants and armor kits. Tanking is cake. No downtime and I'm still arms spec.
---
Except you can meele hit through those hut walls if you are close enough

When you’ve convinced it to get with another hunter so you don’t have to pay alimony.
---
slightly smarter AFK'er run to drek/vann, hide somewhere in the mountain where nobody will reach them, and press jump once every 5 min...
---
but they still contribute nothing to the BG
---
I have played alliance since release, I wanted to experience the horde side this time. 
---
anyways, just weird that we didn't get the same AV.
---
I love loot council over DKP. Just have to learn your spot. When they will be geared you will be next. On Nost it took me 2 month and half to be completely in T2, I even sometime refuse loot to help guildie even if they were supose to be mine. Loot council can be great if the guild knows what they are doing, are efficient, and not douche
---
I've noticed I (warlock) seem to be the target of Rags fireball more than any other ranged dps which sends me flying throughout the fight. Is this just bad luck or is there something that causes him to target ranged dps. Any tips/ tricks would be greatly appreciated.
---
It doesn't, I never said it would. I'm showing that Rogues can grind via multiple mobs at a time, with no down time. On top of being able to skip mobs when needed, or escape death and thus a corpse run. It's pretty damn quick.
---
You likely wouldn’t understand, so no.
---
Loot councils *(that aren’t corrupt)* are good for actually advancing raid progression by getting loot to players that are going to utilize it the best.
---
DKP is good in when you just don’t want anyone to feel screwed over.
---
I've found out the hard way that so called friends can have a very one sided view of what it means to play a game with friends.
---
Put several people forward for raid spots only for them to completely flake on me, which doesn't exactly look good to your guild. They didn't even get to the point of actually raiding, they would just no show and keep saying they definitely would show up in future...
---
Also barely on speaking terms with a couple of people because their idea of playing a team game is to play solo when they feel like it but then shout at me if I ever split up from them. Which resulted in us having to play in secret to actually enjoy the game, that ended very badly once they realised, although of course could not accept any responsibility for shitty behaviour.
---
Right
---
I personally enjoy PvP, and really like the push/pull of AV, so for me the added effort is actually a benefit.  
---
Long wins do have diminishing returns, and sufficiently long would eventually be less honor/rep per minute than a quick loss. I wouldn't advise for farming to start the game thinking "Let's get a 40 minute win!" But if you are at the 30 minute mark, and wondering if you should just lose or keep going, I think the data would suggest you should try for the win - the small increase in time to win as Horde is worth the resultant increase in honor and rep. But for a grind, ideally, you do everything as fast as possible from the start - at the 0 minute mark, you are aiming for a 15 minute win over a 10 minute loss.
---
You left during phase 2 correct?  It’s literally night and day on Fairbanks now with world PVP and it’s a much more pleasant experience for alliance out in the world.
---
Yes he gets the joke
---
Wow. Thank you very much for the link.  I didn't realize my server was so imbalanced.
---
Masters bracers don't exist lol they are like 0.1% chance from raid bosses if they ever drop they would cost like 2000G. I have never seen one in the AH yet.
---
Good reasonable +shadow bracers would be like up to +16, you better get the +13 t1 bracers with lots of stats instead
---
And pretty much become a second afk player to fuck with the first. Yeah, that’s a thing.
---
It's not about the platform it's about the content. All platforms have interesting content, even the ones you just wrote off. But all platforms have derivative lazy cash grab content as well.
---
But then you're almost just as bad, wasting your time and your team's time fucking with an afker. That being said I'm sure the satisfaction from knocking an afker out of the game is amazing.
---
This is entirely false. I duo and trio q reliably with my IRL friends every time we AV. You’re just somehow fucking it up LOL. Unless you’re Horde then that’s probably the reason.
---
HOW DO I MESS WITH SAME FACTION BOTS?
---
Bidding systems leave a lot of openings to be exploited.  You have to trust a lot more people to be fair than a few officers discussing who gets what gear.  Especially if the guild says that your current role doesn't matter and anyone can bid on anything they can equip.
---
I raided as a rogue in vanilla with dkp and ended up with full T1 gear prior to TBC (we weren't that good, not able to do much in BWL and always wiped on Ony multiple times each attempt).  Currently, I'm with a guild doing loot council and it is soooo much better.  Partially because we are doing fast clears, under 90 minutes, so being able to just say what sort of an upgrade it is for you and letting the officers decide while the raid carries on is awesome.  Not to mention my memory of core raiders hording DKP...
---
As someone else said OEB slam/sword spec would probably be the highest out of all those at least until you get a weapon from onyxia
---
Macroing stuff imo is just annoying. I'm all for banter and light hearted chat, but if someone isn't even willing to type out the response, it's just meaningless spam.
---
Thank you! I considered doing AV but never knew I could get a crossbow from that, I'll definitely do it at some point. 
---
I'm currently LW and Skinning though, I was thinking I could craft my own gear from that but is it worth doing that? Or worth swapping them for the proffs you mentioned, they sit on about 250 skill each.
---
It is only bonus honor. About 40% of my honor from these games came from HKs, and I tend to engage in PvP when I can.
---
I’ve actually grown fond of the idea of classic+. Couldn’t give two shits about retail.
---
Wanted to give you my experiences so far as someone in a similar situation as you.
---
I started playing as soon as Classic was released and took me about 12-13 days of gametime to hit 60 as an Alliance Warrior on a Horde-advantaged server. I did not min-max my leveling experience, I did it mostly through solo questing and running instances whenever possible for gear/quests. I did not dungeon farm, although I probably should have from 52+ to farm for the BRD preraid-BIS items. It took me another 2-3 days of gametime to cobble together my raid set with enough +hit gear to be useful.
---
I play somewhere around ~20 hours per week. I'm currently about to hit 20 days gametime played.
---
Last week I was the top Warrior DPS in my guild MC run (although we only have 3 Fury Warriors, amazingly) and top 5 DPS overall, although a lot of folks were PvP specced. We cleared MC just under 2 hours. The consumables I used were:
---
* 3x elemental sharpening stones
---
* 10x Dense sharpening stones
---
* 2x Elixir of the Mongoose
---
* 4x Fire Protection pots
---
* 1x Greater Fire Protection Pot
---
* 1x Arcane Protection potion. 
---
All in all that's about ~30g of consumables on my server. That's not a lot at all to farm per week and you can definitely get by without a lot of these, but most definitely doable with only 15 hours per week of gametime. You likely will not be amongst the top DPS but you'll still crank out enough to be useful, so hopefully your guild is accommodating to that fact.
---
Ah are the mobs all immune then? That makes it a nice option for those that want something cheaper than QS/Edgies combo.
---
ah, i didn't see that when i googled it. 
---
thank you for the quick reply :)
---
It's not me. I'm not even in that group, I've just raided with them a few times. I even won 3 pieces of gear when I did go, with them knowing I wasn't going to be raiding with them on a long-term basis.
---
Selecting people to roll on gear is a compromise that dissolves much of the "man behind the curtain" stigma and leaves it up to some degree of chance.
---
Idk how long your group has been farming Rag—we’ve only had him for a few weeks—but I wouldn’t take less than two healers for Drakk. We’ve done it with 1 tank, a kiter, and another healer and myself, a HotW druid, healing and off-tanking during Conflagration.
---
Hello can you privately message me these places
---
Who wears tier 1?
---
crit/int is extremely overrated for holy paladins. with proper pots, consumes and buffs you should NEVER go out of mana.
---
I stack pure +healing and dont have any mana issues. my rank 1 flash of light heals for about 515 and that's 35 mana. I use about 4 major mana pots for MC and 1 for ony.
---
so the ring is pretty dogshit. I recommend you drop the band of rumination (also a bad ring) and get rosewine circle off of war master voone in LBRS.
---
use this spreadsheet to know what gear is bis  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFchVXiIqah9tmc5X0T70o7pR-oP4wI\_dTOpbbUkClI/edit#gid=656179259](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RFchVXiIqah9tmc5X0T70o7pR-oP4wI_dTOpbbUkClI/edit#gid=656179259) 
---
also you should get the neck from ony head over the trinket. the neck will never be replaced for ret/prot off spec. its stupidly strong.
---
 /u/Zuagroasta has a good analysis of this within the comments. 
---
&gt;According to your data (which is without turn ins I guess?): Your 8 quickly max. 10 min. lost games average 2.351 honor and 244 rep with a length of 9,38 minutes.
---
That results in 250,64 honor/min and 26 rep/min without queues.
---
Or 146,94 honor/min and 15,25 rep/min with queues (average queue of 6,62 min. for those games).
---
Dude how unlucky are you!
---
Raiding, PvP, and trying to gold-cap.
---
Alot of ppl including me can't even report because of addons, you get a message like "this action has failed because of an interface addon"
---
Then it asks you to disable that addon but then you just keep getting it until every single addon is disabled.
---
And im not gonna go through the trouble of disabling all addons just to report someones

No proper rebuttal, shit stain? Not surprising. Most people like you slink away like rats once people call them out. Youre not special. Your time is not worth more than ours. Shame your mother didnt teach you the basic rules of being a decent human being.
---
I mean when everyone has work and no one is in stormwind during the day... thalnos is 80/20 horde favored. So theres not a ton of alliance to begin with. But the guild who refuses to coordinate is a bunch of clowns.
---
I second this. I farm SM Cath on my warrior for ~30g an hour. Fill bags with ~4 clears of the cathedral itself (Only clear the chapel itself and bosses. Skip all of the mobs in the courtyards.). Then go vendor at the argent dawn quartermaster at the bulwark (friendly to Alliance+Horde).
---
Several rare BOEs are worth quite a pretty penny.
---
Did most people really expect to eventually raid with the random server launch guild they joined in the first week or so? I sure didn't lol but if someone did I'm glad that they would have got this red flag.
---
based &amp; redpilled
---
Thats cute that you care about honor rank.  If you actually manage to get to rank 11 or higher where the good rewards are by doing this I'll be impressed.  And will have to steal the strategy.
---
i feel like its too established now and its gonna be way too hard for a new kid to break out big. it's like trying to make an indie MMO when there are AAA juggernauts with decades of experience that get all the subscribers.
---
Im curious about your name. Nordic mythology and an ss at the beginning^^
---
I know this is old but as a Warlock I bind mousewheel up &gt; petattack, mousewheel down &gt; petfollow  
---
Then shift+mousewheel up &gt; Zoom in, shift+mousewheel down &gt; Zoom out. It's a little unwieldy at first (especially if you aren't used to modifiers) but it works
---
Even if it does proc it's such a low priority proc it gets knocked off immediatly. Rn I think every boss is just immune to the proc.
---
Sounds like you live in rainbowland, get a clue
---
100% of people who decided to leave a server said they didn’t like it?  How is that at all surprising lol?
---
Cheating
---
Farm dungeons for pre-raid BiS. It doesnt require too much effort or skill. But as a hunter, you picked a class with a high skill ceiling and utilizing it will only benefit you even if you're casual. Do you plan on raiding? As for gold, i am not an engineer because I came into this a noob as well so I just farm maraudon instead of Dire Mail North.
---
so anyway i started blastin dots
---
Am Warlock. I queue in TB, then when I have a spare hour and a full bag of soulshards I run over to Mara and do the two boss farm. Super easy once you practice it. I watch cartoons as I do it now. Make about 30-50G an hour. Two hours of BG's followed by 1 Hr of farming, everyday I play for two weeks. Has netted me around 400G
---
Thanks. I thought it might be threat but I guess I'm just lucky!
---
I will be honest, i never used the item, i always just send them on their way
---
Fairbanks here. 1.2 mil cap. i have 999k at standing 12. Horde
---
Yea when you tell them to defend belinda or fight back they tell you eat shit its great. We have insta queues day and night though. Alliance chat winning or losing is filled with sweaty people spamming raid warning and toxicity. You guys wanna win just defend and wipe they will start arguing and we will fall apart
---
I have to say that my previous spec was pretty bad for healing. The only good healer PvE talents were Meditation, (to heal while beaten up, saved the group a couple of times) Improved PW:S and Improved PW:F , which are very marginal for pve and don’t provide any direct healing advantage (imp pwf makes healing slightly easier maybe) and I could heal just fine. It was almost boring even when the group was relatively low level with respect to the dungeon
---
I don’t expect it being worse now
---
Depends on how many you have. But, and call me crazy, create the demand yourself. 
---
Step one: have an alt
---
Step two: send some BLs to alt
---
Step three: put one or two in the AH at a well above market value
---
Step four: put the remaining on the AH at a lower price point, but still above market value to give the impression it’s a good deal
---
Step five: profit

Here's the gear I plan to use when I twink my 49 ele [shaman](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/shaman/tauren/AjIMVQABJRMCFR9QIAP_wSkIPB0H3QJFK0M9KAfVhTFQTjoGLY7HJ9c8HQNxiFbgNkLJJ45OKwfRii2RYfcLLjAMMQGPSrFOLpAp_ljdkQe7TjE).
---
&gt; no noob was ever rank 14
---
Boy do i have some news for you.
---
no no no, we turtle on any double digit number.
---
My account will get
---
Cancelled in whatever cycle they announce TBC.
---
Right but tank group gets fr everyone else get something else at least in my raid group. It might work out differently if your a dirty horde lol.
---
Make sure to get Healcomm though. Most healing frames come with it, I'm not sure if Grid does.
---
I'd watch that show.
---
I do this. Great way to top-off the bank account. I have fun with it too.
---
Not really. Not unheard of but fairly rare.
---
found the guy that can’t Wpvp
---
deleted after 5min lol.
---
I had a dude who’s pretty well involved in my guild get super pissy at me over loot in a 5 man dungeon. I had just switched specs and was working on gearing up. We’re both 60 and I was using a green DPS piece from a low 40’s Tanaris quest reward. Now sure the piece that I rolled on and won was primarily for DPS casters and not healing but the guy had gotten an item in the SAME slot on the prior boss and I’m not even sure that the one that I rolled on was better than the one he had just gotten. The gear was a huge upgrade for me and I used it for 3+ weeks. Guy decides to get passive aggressive on me, telling me what I should and should not do around loot. Lecturing me on stats, etc. I apologize, handle it maturely and all I hear are crickets for about 5-10 minutes then I get a pm back not acknowledging that at all and before I could respond he logged. Next week later or so I offer to help him out getting a piece of loot, by stepping in to heal, even give him a stack of ice caps for free so he can get some pots for MC, barely got a thanks. I left the guild for greener pastures this week and we one shotted MC and ONY.
---
Yeah, items like Stockade Pauldrons are those few items that keeps me coming back to DM east because the rare and world epics that drop from ZF are worth almost nothing in comparrison. Maybe I should just try to stack items more and sell them all at once if possible, and not do it every day which I'm almost doing atm.
---
Thanks for the input :)
---
I honestly dont remember how it was in vanilla.
---
He said 25% misses, not miss. As in, 25% of his spells had missed in the fight.
---
Who even does RFD? lol
---
find a group for SM or ZF
---
&gt;Outlets for egocentricity have always existed; this is just a new one.
---
True but it's streamlined the process and made it easier cheaper, and further reaching than anything before it. Sure you could become an actor and be in movies in the past or whatever other outlet but anyone can buy a webcam and start streaming today.
---
(Not bashing streaming I think it has its potential, I've just recognized far toomany streamers with an ego problem. Small timers are the best for this reason imo)
---
So all of that which rogues excel in? Movement speed cooldown &amp; stealth to avoid mobs pre 40. Combat speed is fast. Downtime is nill. Utility in combat is amazing.
---
An army starts with one man and a vision.
---
Just a few tips:     
---
* Blink out of concussive blows     
---
* Counterspell paladins     
---
* Keep your Ice Barrier up at all times       
---
* Cold snap immediately after blowing your ice block so you can Nova &gt; CoC again
---
Haha yeah it’s me! I just read through all the discord announcements, what a ride. Well I know where to find you if I come back. Give Pant a hard time when you’re with him!
---
Top horde on Stalagg were like 1.25 million last week.  Some of these guys are playing 20 hours a day though.
---
yeah true I'm on a slow mount. Most of the time I would get intercepted on the way to galv anyways so might as well make myself useful.
---
Another vote for Incendius.
---
Once BG's came out it's way more tolerable for leveling too.
---
Why not both
---
That's how it is on my server too.
---
The highest rankers pick and choose subs to fill in for their group, which prevents other groups from being able to form.
---
Not only that, but they effectively block other people from gaining rank by bringing in their friends for an honor boost.
---
People who otherwise wouldn't be able to hit certain honor break points, all the while telling everyone else to respect the breakpoints they determine.
---
Meanwhile you have to put in double the time in shitty pugs or bad premades, half of which are 30m losses for 2500 honor.
---
The real problem as I see it is the people being boosted.  They are the ones not putting in the time, and making it harder for people pugging to be competitive in the standings.
---
If anything can be considered not 'fair', it's that you need to play 16 hours in pugs to match what someone being boosted can get in 8 hours if they're friends with the premade organizers.
---
What can you do though, life isn't fair and neither are MMOs.
---
------------
---
Anyway to offer something constructive the only things I can even think of are to degen and play 16+ hours a day and try to get as much honor as you can in a week just to see how things play out (if you're doing bracket caps), or to simply wait it out until the current premade organizers hit rank 14 and they stop organizing a group.
---
Neither of those are great solutions.
---
the latter, basically people want to win every av in 6 min with a galv/drek rush, if that doesn't work, just lose as fast as possible to try again.
---
have over 90% parses in greens damn bro
---
Gonna use the Spreadsheet, you probably gain like 4% more Glancing dmg and when you reach 315 you gain 1 additional hit but its hard to believe it outweighs the dps gain
---
Why did I give up mining for engineering...
---
+20 is still better, +19 probably is as well.  Would have to sim as you go much lower.
---
AOE damage did get nerfed in TBC IIRC, the total damage gets hard capped.
---
I super don't like the idea of using add-ons because I feel it takes away from the Classic experience but.... I DID just say I wish we had dungeon finder so I think that ship has already sailed.
---
Imma do it.
---
Everyone, every class is better in retail at AoE.
---
Honestly, I didn't think or know about which classes would require skills at end game content or so, I just picked what looked like the most fun to play.
---
I might raid if I get a chance to, I'd love to experience it at least once.
---
Maraudon sounds good, what's your strategy on it, do you clear out every mob or just the bosses, fill up your bags and then sell?
---
until you get reported while waiting on the spirit healer to rez / running back to stormpike GY from IB GY.
---
or until the AFK'er figure out they just need to stay in combat with a lvl 51 wolf/ram
---
you can't seriously believe that's gonna be enough to fix the problem.
---
They don't skip all the mobs at drek. They pull a few outside and kill them. Sometimes the last add is offtanked whilst Drek is killed.
---
Which is pretty much what the horde do.... Pull out adds and kill them.
---
Yeah, if Blizzard is gonna go back on their “no legacy servers” stance, why would they start with *anything* but Vanilla? It would make no sense to go BC&gt;Wrath&gt;Vanilla. 
---
As it stands, most of the work to release BC and Wrath is already done from working on Classic. It’s a no brainer, not only because BC and Wrath were the most successful points in WoW’s history, but because the cost is so slim that the profit would be massive. 
---
I’m not even saying it’s  a guarantee, but using the fact that we have Classic and not BC as a reason for its unpopularity is so illogical.
---
Obviously you fail to see anything outside of your own experience, you're going to think a rogue levels faster if you level better as a rogue than as a hunter, even if a hunter is better at leveling. How can I compare rogues to the other classes in terms of leveling for you?
---
When classic launched a group of friends came up with a very popular guild name and it quickly ballooned up to 350 players or so. That close group of friends made a few random players officers but mostly maintained control among themselves. Some weeks down the road basically all of those original officers and the guild leader stopped playing. This left just those few randoms to govern. After a while the randoms decided to make their own guild. They all left along with half the guild, but a good deal said that wanted to stay behind. Just a day later someone with officer rights kicked every single person out except for the now vacant guild leader. To this day there hasn't been anyone online in that original guild because there's no one left to invite them back. No one in the new guild claimed responsibility. Strange occurrence.
---
Grobb here...no idea what he's talking about!??
---
I like having spirit of redemption for PvP and 2,5sec heals instead of 3sec for PvE, makes my life so much easier.
---
You can scoop five snowballs in seconds, and the CD's only 30 sec. Only takes a few. So I've burned maybe a minute and change. Faster than waiting on reporting, and it certainly is more satisfying. 
---
Sometimes, when people go afk elsewhere, it's even faster. Single snowball to toss them into mobs, and watch 'em die. Snowballs are just my favorite thing right now.
---
I arguably went pretty ham compared to most as a warrior. I got to 60 fairly quickly but not too quickly (3-4 weeks) and got pre-bis’d out and joined my current guild. Getting there might take you longer than I did, but 15 hours of play time a week is plenty. I rarely even play that now that I’m raiding.
---
I'm fairly sure Grid includes it. I haven't messed with it in a while, but I definitely see incoming heals.
---
You dont know anything about healer loot then. Cthun mace and flowers almost doubled benediction
---
You will get downvoted by the nochanges divas. I wish we had dungeon finder, it is really difficult to find lvl 35-50 dungeons despite being on a populated server.
---
This is exactly why, as a hunter, I drop trap and guard the goddamn door.
---
Was about to say they looked exactly the same as the ones on that site that i have been using.
---
I think even with a mana pot and his mana gem he doesn't have enough to solo aoe elites his level.
---
Sounds like bs.
---
Kek XD
---
&gt; if carried out properly
---
Yeah, that's the problem right there. Only the best of the best LCs pull that off. Even LCs with reasonably good intentions can make big mistakes and not make decisions in the best interest of the raid.
---
hahaha wat?
---
Last night my gm disbanded the guild
---
And blocked everyone on Discord and battlenet. Stole all the thousands of gold worth of guild mats. Why? Because he was burned out from dealing with guild drama. We had this one guy who appeared nice to everyone and recruited like 17 members. However when he didn't have his way he back bit like a snake and was removed so he poached a whole bunch of members. I guess I kinda get why he kinda did it.
---
Dick move tho..
---
Each item should sell between 50g- 100g at least.  10 boss, each boss drop 3 loot. So that is between. 1500g to 3000g minimum.  (I expect way more than that if good stuff drop) So that would a minimum of 37.5g - 75g for about an hour.
---
fuck true
---
Nice
---
I mean when there’s a premade calling the strats. Which is when you get games like this where you get everyone to stack in the hall outside drek. It’s the fastest way to down drek. And it’s even faster when the premade can instruct everyone to focus drek but that only works when someone stands guard outside with cc.
---
Not much, there is a lot of people trying to fish these.
---
This is a wow sub afterall
---
I levelled a Mage first in classic, then a Rogue. Ignoring AoE, Rogue is faster.
---
I levelled Hunter, Druid (albeit my very first character), Rogue, and various other low levels in Vanilla. My own experience is enough for me to say that Rogue is fast.
---
That surprises me. The majority of my Horde side games now are 15-20 minute wins; it feels like Alliance has given up on winning and gone over to the lieutenant strat for honor. The only exceptions are the teams that abuse Drek pull and kill him in 6-7 mins.
---
I mean yes, thats how you play mage. 
---
How am I supposed to feel as a warrior when people tell me mages are braindead. 
---
As warrior I charge -&gt; sweeping strikes -&gt; whirlwind -&gt; wank because I just did 10k damage all while being carried by my respective shaman/paladin.
---
In other words, if mage and rogue are braindead, how noob friendly are all the other classes like LOL spriest?
---
Lol in a way I don't mind queue times.  At least we can take breaks. Ally and their insta queues plus fomo means u need a poop bucket to rank up 😂💩
---
Nope. The groups I'm talking about literally kill drek with the warmasters sitting untouched.
---
the 49 bracket was always my fav
---
TBC, by Christmas 2020 please.
---
Looks like your made a copy &amp; paste mistake.
---
With a warlock + healer u can kill 2-3 at a time. Just dot them up and run away, reapply a dot every 10s and when they drop off.
---
I'd say that it's pretty hard to die as a rogue during your leveling phase. I don't know if it's the fastest/slowest class to level up but it's probably the "safest" one. (on a pve server :p no idea about pvp ones) 
---
If you pick the +5% evade and +5% parry from your talent trees, you rarely take significant damage in 1v1 fights. I can usually kill 5+ mobs before needing to eat or patch myself up. And even if things are going bad, I can always sprint and run for it or vanish or gouge the enemy and patch myself up mid fight.
---
5 out of 6 AV games I play alliance just ends it in 10-15 min. I loved the old AV where there was an actual fight and people actually summoned Lokholar. There was a fight and things mattered. Right now nothing matters, none of the features of AV are used its just a rush and end easy win for Alliance. They will run right passed a few horde gaurding a grave yard to kill the boss and not even worry about fighting them. Why doesn't blizzard fix this?
---
"we have to cheat to win because we can't win any PUG vs PUG games with even numbers" this is exactly the same as you outplaying us in phase 2
---
QQ
---
So then, you're admitting that you are drawing conclusions from just your own experience?
---
No proper rebuttal, shit stain? Not surprising. Most people like you slink away like rats once decent people call them out. Youre not special. Your time is not worth more than ours. Shame your mother didnt teach you the basic rules of being a decent human being.
---
There is nothing to fix, this is how it’s always been in vanilla.
---
Classic ultimate would be great: arenas, new pvp gear, pvping with a weekly cap of points, pet battles, etc...classic needs a lot of the things in retail for it to be fun and have something to do. It's getting very boring
---
Oh, can't say I've ever seen that done once in all the games I've done up to Exalted.
---
No, I've got 15 years of experience from myself, my friends, and information freely available online.
---
No, he's not. How much skill do you think it took the individual in OP's picture?
---
Mage looks easy to play, just like all the classes do in Classic, but there's no way they're the easiest.  Warrior PVP consists primarily of charge hamstringing someone and waiting for massive crits.  Rogues are hard if you're trying to stun lock, but realistically you can just one shot what opponents you can and avoid the others.  Locks can chain fear and dot you with absolutely no mechanical skill necessary.  Hunter is by far the easiest class to play even factoring in the occasional scatter shot-trap combo because that still results in a simple aimed shot auto multi.  
---
The reality is that Classic pvp is just as difficult or complex as people made it out to be.  The only class that takes any real mechanics is druid, and even that is less skill intensive than most classes in later expansions.  I play Classic because it's fun to charge in and one shot people, no matter how braindead the process is.  I don't see why people try to take any sort of high ground in terms of class difficulty when this is the iteration of WoW that has the easiest gameplay for every class.
---
More like a core hound tooth uWu ;))))
---
this isnt me, but look at his parses and gear on my server
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/us/bigglesworth/pylori
---
So what exactly were you trying to do by telling me I sound like a conspiracy theorist and mocking the idea that Nazis could be congregating online to spread their ideas if you weren’t trying to undermine me?
---
25g minimum for items is more realistic as that's generally what they will be worth as D/E. 
---
I run with a dkp guild that does gold bids on off pieces, trust me people won't pay a load of gold for MC gear especially when BWL releases soon.
---
Never heard the term "multiboxer" before, what is it?
---
If you need a mount or an epic offhand, farm AV rep. It's quick and simple enough to grind.
---
You'll be slightly more valuable to MC raids if you have your Hydraxian Waterlords quest chain completed up to the point where you need to kill MC mobs/bosses.
---
You'll eventually want Argent Dawn rep but only if you plan to raid Naxxramas. 
---
If you want mounts from other factions, you'll want to start collecting runecloth for that.
---
Server transfers opened 3 days ago and both our thunderfury tank and Hang of Rag paladin transferred without letting anyone know where they were going.
---
Yeah, no. Stats matter as you don't have to waste GCDs on lifetapping/popping Demonic Runes. Plus there are fights where extra health padding matters so you don't randomly die to chained Arcane Explosions/Rag explosions.
---
Yep! I was guarding Stonehearth Bunker with a rogue and some Faerlina guy kept spamming ti report us AFK. Thank God the raid chat blew up on him and they kicked him out, knowing we were just waiting on the bunkers timer.
---
You can start a group with one person, chances are there are lots of people lurking lfg
---
Haha the timing was perfect, as if the surger heard you and was like, hold my beer
---
It's harder to sell the drops if you stealth run it. The mobs will be hostile to people so you could only sell them to other stealth classes (aka rogues and druids)
---
So I just opened a nice bottle of red wine. Really delicious.
---
How's your evening so far? Anything else to do beside copy and pasting?
---
I am currently stuggling with whether I should order some food to go with the wine.
---
Keep in mind that when you use the mouse over blind you will still lose combo points on your target. It can be worth doing but should be noted this is normal behavior.
---
Lok is better for pvp, but if I can rock a mana pot every raid boss pull I see no reason to not go with Barb
---
I don't see how they could even know your remoting in. I'm logged in from my computer not my phone. Rd is kinda like a wireless keyboard I can take anywhere.
---
My sever used to have an enchanting cartel that worked together to fix the tip prices on high level enchants.
---
Michael should have asked the party planning committee first. He's not supposed to just spring things on us out of nowhere.
---
Even worse, they were stacking up on Warmasters. 
---
IMO warmasters should be solo-tanked and ranged down. Unless your group has more healers than dps, you are straining your healers when the cleaves chunk out half your health.
---
Melee is better off guarding the entrance.
---
When I was still a 60% Andy, I (a paladin) would ride straight to the entrance to balinda, cast BoF, run around pressing my different buttons until I was almost dead, then bubble and heal the LT outside the entrance before pretending to try a daring escape.
---
I was always surprised at the number of people who would sit there chasing/casting at/attacking a bubbled pally who was "running away"...  many times it made the difference in us getting galv first.
---
The most important lesson I learned from playing MOBA games is that everyone committing to the wrong decision is still usually better than being the only one doing the right thing.
---
I didn't notice any difference myself, my hit% was 14 to 16% which is pretty normal with 1% hit.
---
My dmg average on hit was the same than on other bosses with similar crit% so he doesn't seem like he has any shadow resist. I have much lower avg damages on Lucifron and Gehenas tho which are supposed to have high shadow resist
---
It's just how he did me man.  If he would have told me before WoW Classic came out that he wanted to roll with Alliance first.. I would have agreed and rolled with Alliance so we could do everything together.  
---
He never communicated with me on what "he" wanted.   Basically he made temporary characters on the horde server that I choose with no plans to actually stay with me in the end.  
---
It was abrupt on when he just rerolled on me when I was heavily invested in my Undead mage at like level 50 or so.  No warnings what so ever he just rerolled to another server without telling me.  I found out when I logged in one day and noticed he was no longer on my server because I didn't see his character info on friends list.  I was like hey bro what's going on? In messenger through battle.net.  They he told me what he did with how he switched to an Alliance server and rerolled to a pally.
---
I am not mad that he want's to enjoy the game with leveling multiple characters.  He can do what he wants... I just wanted more communication with him so I could understand what he would like to do.  He pretty much gave me the finger and left with no communication.  That's not how it should be...  I was left in the dark man.  He even talked to me a lot about how he was excited to play BG's with me before BG's were even out. 
---
He gave me a false sense of hope and hyped me up for nothing man.
---
If you don't see the issue... I don't know what to say.  It's shitty what he did to me man.
---
None of those t1 pieces are very good for PVE. 
---
Nemesis skullcap is actually not BIS for PVE, a +41 green BOE is, though anything more than +39 seems exceptionally rare.  +39 is almost certainly still going to sim/parse better under ideal circumstances.  The 16 int is only worth ~3 spellpower.   That said, I wouldn't blame anyone for running skullcap, it might be one of two places its worth to add some survivability stam in, and considering the extreme rarity and cost of the hat its probably the slot to compromise on.  
---
Green boots, bracers are not that rare at max or max-1 enchant for reasonable money. 
---
Yes, Nemesis legs are just straight up BIS besides world boss drop.  *Because they have more spellpower than Skyshroud or Felheart.*  Has very little or nothing to do with the stats.  Especially with nemesis legs you wouldn't take T1 bracer/feet for even more stam, you get plenty from Nemesis for pve.
---
Frostbite and glacial blade. I got revered in about 10 hours of av with pretty minimal effort, so unless horde is much worse on your battlegroup than on mine, I bet he could get it in the next week averaging even 1.5 hours a day, and definitely at 2.
---
How many buffs can you have?
---
Depends on your build. You should have a fairly easy time with frost mages since none of their CC besides improved counterspell works on you. Once you bait out their silence it's game over. If you are raid Resto spec you might have a bit harder time, but Feral and Boom/Hybrid Resto you should have no issues.
---
And then you’re oom
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005203104-3203050022550100201-05
---
Almost anything over T1 chest.  It's bad.  Great stam for pvp...
---
Some mages / other people offer instance runs. You should find someone for a few gold a run.
---
Priest mind control @ level 30 would absolutely fail against a lvl 60 elite.  I don’t believe engineering items resist/failure rates are based off of level but rather a fixed rate.
---
why is it called a hotfix if its not getting implemented right away but on the next scheduled downtime?
---
It's almost like reddit isn't a single person. And it's almost like most people have no idea what they're saying or how things affect the game in the longterm.
---
I'm not an exception either. But blizzard 'should' know their shit.
---
Link to the video?
---
If they get spirit Rez before you loot the corpse disappears and you can’t loot.
---
Good luck getting world boss drops.
---
1 tank 7dps 2 healers 
---
You need a mage or a hunter to kite Last boss while you solo tank slap both adds before he gets back.
---
This will get you to the discord: https://classic.wowhead.com/discord-servers#classes
---
Yeah your own fault if you carry such guys with your premade grps
---
This guy has it right. There is a route I run where I pass by all the possible mountain silversage spawns and get like 30-40 of them an hour, plus like 20 dreamfoil an hour. Run north along the mountain ridge from the alliance flightpath, past the timbermaw. run past the mountains in the north side then hug the coast on the run back to the middle. Do the same on the south side and repeat.
---
Not sure I follow your logic. The upgrade from fang to scepter is larger than the upgrade from scepter to hammer.
---
Why didn't they just make it so people get the AFK debuff? Makes much more sense.
---
THANK YOU for that spreadsheet! It's so hard to find bis lists that actually break everything down and don't just go "this is bis don't question it everything has been solved". This actually has all the values and weights.
---
I believe Booty Bay Gazette attempts to do that, pretty interesting site for people that love to play the AH.
---
Using a fire protection pot every 7 days isn't a very high expectation. If someone wants to just "go in and get some loot", they should be expected to demonstrate the bare minimum effort at least. The person you originally replied to wasn't even complaining about the raid taking extra 30 minutes. I don't care about 2h to 2h30m MC clears at the moment but once there are more raids to do per week, that extra 30 minutes will add up.
---
So no, I would not be okay with someone walking into MC at the last minute with a pure PvP talent build and *zero* consumables, ranking dead last every boss fight, dying &lt;1min into Rag encounter, and then walking out with multiple purples.
---
lol... its the OP on this thread.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/523604292
---
Use CC.
---
Tanks should LOS.
---
Focus fire on one target at a time.
---
Lawd he is a comin!
---
Cool, great to know! The leveling part is what stalls me now but I’ll be fine once I’m done with that.
---
They don't charge if everyone in in the raid is stacked on them
---
Depends on what kind of resources you're talking about.
---
The ideal setup is that you've already got a 60 mage or prot paladin. You start a new account and run yourself through dungeons until high level 40s (ZF graveyard runs).
---
Short of that, you said you've got resources. Pay a mage or prot paladin to do the same thing.
---
What is your question?
---
So he afk all those hours for nothing ????
---
If you loot to fast you won’t get loot
---
It's way more than you need.
---
gnomes are actually fucking disgusting.

Feral is the worst pvp spec in the game.   I assume you meant hotw NS.

If you are a warrior or rogue, there are spreadsheets that will model the dps output of weapons based on your other gear and spec. The spreadsheets are available at the various class discords listed here: https://classic.wowhead.com/discord-servers#classes

30-0-21 spec

Then play WSG or do something else instead of being an ass.

Yeah we were trying those tactics but it was crazy it felt like our Aggro range was WAY higher than normal. Maybe we got used to being over leveled for where we were all the time ..
---
Lmfao
---
Was about to say this. I play as a frost mage and I never try to initiate fights against druids lol 
---
Shadow priests as well but I’m not that good at pvp to begin with.
---
One of my guildies is leveling an alt rogue @ lvl 30. He parked his main nearby to take care of anyone if he gets camped.  A 38 warrior ganked his rogue a few times, so he hopped on his main to dispose of the warrior. Then the warrior hops on his mage &amp; camps my guildies main. My guildy geys away, hops back on his alt and goes to a different zone. The mage followed him to the new zone and camped him there for the rest of the night. 
---
My guildy hops on the server discord &amp; wished cancer on the guys kids or something.  This went down a week ago. Every night since, the mage logs in, camps my guildy, and posts screenshots on the server discord. It was funny at first bc my guildy kinda had it coming for the cancer comment. But after 3 days, this mage became insufferable.
---
We also found out that the mage has a friend on the opposite faction whos /who my guildy and giving the mage his movements. Last night, myself &amp; a few guildies went to where our buddy was leveling his alt to camp the mage as some payback. Go figure, the mages spy on our faction disclosed in discord that a few of us were in the zone. We ended up catching the mage and camping him until he logged, but hes still talking a lot of shit in disc, saying hell do it again tonight. So we'll see where that goes. Currently in talks with the spys guild master,  hes in a well known guild,  maybe not for much longer.
---
As a healer, if you are not going OOM on every pull it is a tank / DPS problem.
---
Your spec can dictate this somewhat. 
---
Changing forms cancels Frost slow debuff AND frost nova. Utilize entangling roots. Dash, feral charge, travel form. 
---
Change forms frequently, use your root, close the gap and eat them. Also if they are a shitty mage you can prevent them from finishing cast by darting behind them near the end of the cast.
---
Isn't Strat Live terrible for AD rep?
---
Bliz seems really selective on the #nochange.
---
Who punts the punters.
---
&gt; provided every single consumable
---
The fits people throw about min/maxing with consumables and making sure ony buff etc is laughable, as someone who was doing these raids back in the day, there is next to zero reason to demand everyone be carrying around multiple elixirs and pre running DM and getting Onyheads except to cover up how absolutely bad you are at the game.
---
lol yikes i don't have any burden of proof or have to do anything you say. Enjoy your green gear and wowhead bis lists, amigo.
---
Nah. The honor is too good. I get the same honor whether I participate or not.
---
Hotfixes are usually applied the next time the realms restart. The only time they're put into place right away is with critical / gamebreaking issues.
---
Since the 6 min AVs stopped horde are doing much better.
---
The horde meta has evolved to kill all lieutenants and balinda, then a fraction port back to defend and stall while the rest push.  
---
  Since bgs last longer now and the queues are also way longer, this allows horde to actually win pretty easily if done correctly and maximize the time spent.  
---
  The problem is that there's a timeframe where there's some yolo/dumb as fuck kids that will literally just sit mid and lose the bg by themselves.  
---
  I'm talking 10-20 people that just sit middle all game, either afk, trying to "pvp" and die 1v5 or trying to cap irrelevant things. 
---
  But outside that timeframe, horde is winning 90% of the bgs.
---
If you as the healer have decent gear, and know how to properly downrank your spells for efficiency, it is your tank's gear/ability usage or your DPS's output that is a problem. DM-N isn't the easiest 5-man so to some degree it shouldn't be very easy, but it should not give a team that is competently geared and properly played much trouble.
---
Back in the day people in general sucked at the game. The game knowledge and quality of player is dramatically higher. People solo queued for BGs and still got R14, and a bunch of those folks (at least on my server) were pretty bad at the game. If you took the # of folks who got rank 14 and also played arena in tbc, I'd be willing to bet less than 20% hit gladiator in arena where skill did matter. Like 8 folks total hit gladiator on my server in throughout all of TBC. Only 1 of those got GM.
---
All that screeching and screaming about Blizzard "intentionally nerfing paladins", and it turns out to be an unintended bug.
---
Lol.
---
Oh man that’s a sweet staff. The day I hit 60 I joined a MC pug raid and got my warlock shoulders, belt and spell taisum. Fortunately the guild I joined already has really well geared locks so I’ll probably get more raid bis soon.
---
You only see them when the game drags out, but they are sometimes summoned
---
Using 30/0/21 build
---
It’s been used in BG’s since they’ve dropped. Just not often, and it usually requires a turtle.
---
Be the change you want to see in the world. Pick up some blood and turn in and use bg chat to let others know thats the game plan.
---
I'm in the exact same situation, same two epic daggers. I'm not sure about pve but I did end up deciding to use the Bonescrapper in the off hand for pvp for the better chance of getting crippling poison off.
---
I don't know what to add: it's like I keep on repeating the common sense that you must do things with moderation (especially if it's unhealthy, not fun and not teaching you any skill) and you just don't want to address it and just consider that I'm a judgemental asshole who think people playing videogames are stupid. So let be that clear: if you only drink and binge Netflix for 3 months, it's just as problematic like it's also a proble if you inject steroids and ruin your health to become a strongman competitor (especially if you don't even like to lift) 
---
Just push thing further: let's imagine that you can get Super Grand Warlord rank 15 if you play 1 year at the same pace and on top of that you rank is reset if you spend more than 8 hours offline. Would you say that it's reasonable to do? Is there a point where you would tell me: "mmm yeah anybody doing this is insane"?
---
I think you missed my point. I'm sure they're mathematically the best you can get according to some dork's spreadsheet. Which I'd be surprised if it's taking into account variables like boss resistances or fight duration, but I'm also not going to bother to find out. Helpful, but overrated. Last 5 raids: 89, 94, 94, 98, 97 btw. Thanks man, I must be really lucky.
---
Very few guilds on my server require all of the above consumables. That may change when BWL comes out but for now I'd basically say just a couple greater fire protection potions for rag, and some giants and rage pots can't hurt and are pretty cheap. I do use an arcane pot on Shazzrah to boost my healing numbers but it's really not necessary, and nobody uses shadow protection potions. FAPs are a good call in general though for sure.
---
30/0/21 spec
---
Lmfao... based on what ?
---
Shit is spawned every 3 matches, you just dont pvp a lot. 
---
Also its an oversized badly scripted elite that does nothing but act as a pair of jingling keys that distracts 30 of your teammates to stare and follow it around when you could just be ending the game.
---
And get kicked for "wasting time"
---
Loot is weird, man. We've had 6 brutality blades, 5 perditions blades, 3 core hound tooth and 3 gutgore rippers in 9 weeks of raiding MC with only 1 mageblade and 1 staff of dominance. We've also gotten 1 deathbringer and 0 viskags off ony in roughly 30 kills (we split raids for ony). Luck is luck. We've also gotten cornerstone grimoire or the ring of binding off ony like 25/30 of our kills so take the good with the bad. Oh yea, and we've gotten nemesis 12 times for our 4 locks, cenarian 10 times for our 2 druids and only one bloodfang.
---
Off topic but what remote desktop client do you use? I remember trying to use chrome remote desktop and the mouse sensitivity is ridiculously high no matter what, making it pretty much impossible to play.
---
Thank you for the feedback. Can you elaborate a bit more? Why do you say 15 hours is not enough for phase 4/5? I don’t think it changes much- it all depends on how much progression your guild is able to produce. Initially all raids take longer but as people get geared it’s easier. It shouldn’t be that bad if I start stacking consumables now and farm with my mage alt. 
---
What do you think?
---
When anyone looks into your "gaming history" all that is shown is everyone laughing at you. A simple Google search is all it takes.
---
Holy Reckoning is fun tho.
---
You don't need masters, high councillor's will roll up to +21 also and they're not rare at all. Got a pair of +21 frost damage bracers for 30g months ago
---
Locks have almost the same parses as mages.... If you're optimizing you easily beat most of the mages.
---
Not all mages spec into deep frost for the ice block. Same goes for ice barrier.
---
Ah the old "Harpe Di(eze) Nuts."
---
bruh if you are cummuting 5hrs a day you fucked up
---
Ask What?
---
Same thing happens with the ubrs key quest. If you miss and the ability goes on CD just kill the dragon and let it respawn. Otherwise it’s a very long CD
---
I mean... To be fair, if the dudes got both bindings and your getting him TF, your going to give him literally every piece of gear he should get first.
---
Maybe I should have re-worded this. 
---
Substitute 'important' with 'big deal' or a 'a lot of fun'.
---
Now it randomly selects 3 players in melee range that'll get affected
---
His statement goes no-life level beyond that. A week ago was 3 days after AV came out. He’s just assuming that everyone else has so little going on in their lives that they all got Exalted with AV in THREE DAYS lmao
---
lol, literally me and I only have an Earthshaker (but BiS everywhere else basically. I will say, casters are huge at the moment. They can do so much damage that can't be healed through and the gear with the stam and dps isn't really available yet. Warriors are still squishy at the moment.
---
To make my case, my shitty pvp clips (good clips, just low video quality) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-08oSySU3k
---
Remember that R14 takes 3 months from R0.  And that once they hit R14, the odds of them maintaining their stranglehold is close to nil.  No one wants to burn 16-20 hours a day pvping in AV.
---
Also know that unless they are honor stacking every slot from bracket 1 down to bracket 3, you'll be fine.
---
I main a mage, and had a kid who got pissed because I wouldn't take the time to make him 120 stacks of food and water, so he followed me throughout the entire match throwing hard-packed snowballs at me, and berating me with PMs. The true AV is the infighting.  
---
God bless you mages who have the kind heart to prepare food and water before fights and pass it out to everyone who is on servers with mage scarcities or preparing before BGs is an alien concept.
---
Thank you. I'm sorry but I'm really not used to Discord for anything other than voice chat, I cannot find it. Is this the Ravenholdt rogue discord server we are talking about? That is the only rogue discord I know of.
---
You just take 2 warriors and the 2nd one tanks when needed. Equipping a shield and changing stance is something any warrior can do. 
---
Having 2 tanks on some pulls after Beast is nice. Saying there’s no need is kinda dumb but also pretending like any DPS warrior can’t off tank is also dumb.
---
No! It’s going to pop any second!
---
Is there a proof? I thought they fixed it.
---
I think they'll enjoy doing more DPS than the people wearing t1 in every fight
---
Did I say I want the game to die? No I did not.
---
I said I hope they lose subs, because profiting from decisions that clearly are not made with the players in mind is a very grey line I would rather them stay far away from.
---
Add ons we're a big part of classic.
---
APES members are streaming their whole journy and they got 1,5mil and they are talking all the time, so no.. no rotating or account sharing, just good old fashioned play 18h a day of BG's
---
You fools, I love the 12-20 min queues. It’s for everyone so it doesn’t do anything to my rank except give me constant 20 min breaks to clean and catch up on work. Thanks dudes!
---
because of all the custom rulesets you could invent, you pick something that would cost blizzard money and not even really have any impact on how the game is played for 99.9% of players
---
I never understand it when people say this.  We had addons in vanilla...  Anyone serious about the game back then used just as many as we do today.
---
you sound mad
---
Not to mention the poorly designed quest hubs.  There's so much time wasted running errands back and forth.  I hated Stonetalon and Arathi as horde (doing those elite quests and having to run back to Hammerfell because you only get 1 at a time was fucking maddening) because of that BS.  Other zones like Un'Goro are amazing in comparison because you can get 90% of the things you need done while killing your way around the zone in one fell swoop.
---
Endgame is life
---
The issue isnt the problem with auto attacking and facing.  Its that reckoning doesnt proc when auto attack is turned off for the extra hits.  This is what makes the talent useful in the first place.
---
The bigger problem seems to me that you will have a hard time getting a raidspot in an established guild like this when you will only hit level 60 in like 4 weeks.
---
spending 5 min pushing one person out of the bg... you might as well just be afk yourself you’re not actually helping. just post in /bg that they’re afk and have people report them while actually playing the game.
---
Yeah came across this 4 times last night.  Guess it's the new meta and spreading.  Matches were between 6 and 9min duration
---
&gt; We need stuff that only some crazy dedicated people can get
---
no we don't
---
Except you have no control over the population of the server you are on, other then the numbers at the time you chose that server.
---
Those population numbers can change at the drop of the hat and suddenly you went from choosing to be on a horde dominated server to now being the only horde character left. Obviously an eztreme case I'm just making a point that your logic is terrible.
---
Shadow has to wand like any other spec of priest if they don't want to be vulnerable and drink every other kill. Shadow also does not do more damage than a properly played smite priest, while a smite priest has much better healing throughput than a shadow priest.
---
Shadow does, however, provide significant advantages in PvP with silence and vampiric embrace. It's a great choice. It's just not always a clearly better choice.
---
Kfcmanager, I've no idea how he gets any work done.
---
All I want for Xmas is $25, eh?
---
cord is obiously much better than the dungeon belt but there is no reason to get the mana cord as a lock when you can have the shadow belt from domo which performs the same. T2 belt has the same stats as the mana cord anyway so just leave it to the mages
---
I prefer Onslaughts system, fair and fast
---
Right, we want it to be as classic as possible. Making WSG the primary source of honor will do that. Nobody ground AV for honor for the vast majority of Classic and the current 1.12 version is NOT a reminder of what we had. It is a big old slap in the face to anyone who wanted a classic experience.
---
I agree, it's not the players fault that the pvp system is rigged and afking is pretty much rewarded. The abuse of the report system is solely on the players who abused it though.
---
Are you Alliance?   It takes like 5 hours to run there which is why nobody does it.
---
I'm sure the nightclubs wouldn't be the same without you
---
Three weeks ago I reported a rogue bot killing turtles in tanaris, several of my guildmates also saw and reported him. Earlier today I saw that same bot farming in winterspring. Blizzard just doesn't care about bots.
---
Meh
---
I was a person who got kicked, but wasn't re-instated as an officer...probably a good move because I'm still only level 50 on my main.
---
Lol 
---
Tbf I don't think anyone playing wow is actually a boomer.  Wernt they all born in the 60s
---
Because p4/5 for one requires you to run MC, BWL and AQ progress every week and maybe some ZG runs as well, while increasing the amount of consumes needed.
---
&gt; They’re REALLY good
---
A coordinated guild group of 60s should not be failing to complete a 5 man. There's no shame in being bad, but just so you know, your experience is not typical for a competent bunch.
---
Had an AV last night with 2 druids, 2 shamans and 0 priests.  That was a fun one.
---
We just summoned him and had him push to win in a 49 minute game. Epic shit. Do more pvp, turn in the stuff and people will help summoning.
---
People who didn’t play the Zerg wins days. It’s hilarious if you didn’t tokay in the first 3 days. You aren’t getting fast rep and honor. I just want the fast honor back. I was pulling 60k honor a day before the whole don’t skip galv thing started. Now it’s a fight to get 20. 
---
In short - fuck flag. Get to FWGY and push to relief but with everyone else. They can’t stop 30 alliance
---
worse for some, better for others.
---
without crossrealm players are encouraged to contribute to balanced factions.  with crossrealms players are encouraged to play on servers that are entirely their own faction.
---
Which furbolgs
---
Plus in the months coming you have aq gates opening which have a few more repeatable quest for ad rep. And the scourge event.
---
&gt; most people don't get to enjoy that content
---
aaah yes, the glorious ice lord and is lesser-known brother, treejus.
---
After turning thousand and thousand of blood to the shaman/druid, you get to escort them from your base to the field of strife because if a single one of them die, you cannot summon him... better hope you control everything up to the midfield.
---
then once they arrive, you need to take 10 people off any important objective ( out of the 30-35 active player in your AV) to summon him.
---
If you do manage to summon him... do not rejoice yet! they are initially very weak and could be killed by 2-3 people without problem... so you have to babysit them for 15 minute in the field of strife while they sloooowly grow to a reasonable strength. This of course ensure the rest of your team is now fighting 25 V 35 for any meaningfull objective.
---
15 minutes passes, the icelord finally start moving toward the alliance base... getting easily distraced by anything in sight, doesn't care wether or not it's a good time to push or wether he have people around him... just set autorun and move forward. 
---
Now, after turning in thousand of blood, escorting the shaman, babysitting the baby lokholar, not getting wiped while the autorun toward the ennemy base... you finally arrive at the dreaded chokepoint: the bridge... but you have lokholar on your side! He'll smash those puny alliance!
---
Oh wait no. a single hunter used distracting shot to kite him into vanndar where he'll die in a minute or two due to all the NPC piling up on him. meanwhile you're stuck 34V35 on the bridge with the archers hitting you and your closest GY is snowfall, at best.
---
I've recently tried this community server and it's actually quite a fun time, if you felt you were limited in D2 - a lot of love has gone into the mod, and the community is a gem.
---
Rogues are great at killing things and winning fights. They just have more downtime, so the /played to 60 is higher than say, a priest who just keeps going and going and never has to stop and drink.
---
This.  ESPECIALLY on horde with windfury.  Windfury opens up more viable specs (2h fury) to compete for top dps, axe specialization is good for some item drops for orcs, but regardless of faction/race warriors in mostly blues with good weapons and smart rotation will be in the top half of the dps most of the time.  Their BIS isn't super difficult to obtain (lionheart is expensive though) if you forget SGC, and if they gear right in MC with some minimal FR and pots, they do a lot of damage and survive pretty well.
---
Warriors scale with gear really well, but it is more warriors are middling dps with partial pre-bis gear, and with full raid BIS gear become monsters.
---
This is working out great with the guild I am in overall. There are some snags with items that are technically upgrades but nobody would ever raise their GP to get them, some items definitely need their GP value tweaked. But the system allows newer members to start getting gear reasonably quick.
---
Whoa that actually sounds pretty cool!
---
Yeah you don't need to use Distracting Dagger IMO. Especially if you have Gutgore as an option.
---
You do get an AFK debuff if you're reported afk
---
I was born in the 2000s
---
Queue as premade, Alliance has much more greater success with this.
---
I don't get it.
---
Horde on Fairbanks here. Before the World PVP died down due to BG's, it was pretty balanced. Super fun server.
---
Here is a direct link to the discord: [https://discord.gg/mkfKCBB](https://discord.gg/mkfKCBB)
---
then its not called a hotfix lmao
---
&gt; or try to use some critical thinking skills
---
The irony here is unreal.
---
 Your misconception is based on the false dichotomy that we have to choose between having no ability to report AFKs or having a system that is easily abused and where those that abuse it go unpunished.
---
Because alliance don’t stop to help each other.
---
&gt; Why in the holy mother of fuck is ~~a shaman~~ anyone using GFPP on Ony?
---
population numbers only change at the drop of a hat when they introduce transfers
---
even prior to release realms had faction estimates
---
I did the AV rep grind to exalted during BC on a fairly geared mage. I remember it being frustrating, boring, and long. But the battles seemed to be much more about positioning, strategy and clean execution, rather than just zerging and burning down the enemy leader in 7 minutes. It felt much more immersive.
---
That doesn't apply to Frostbolt though. That either hits for the full amount or it gets fully resisted.
---
I can't tell if this is serious or not,  but literally all of classic wow is an approximation running on a newer client.
---
I afk in AV on one monitor while leveling my alt on the other. What do you think of that?
---
I might be wrong, but i think I remember that hotfixes were exactly the opposite. Small fixes that they were able to apply to the game without needing a restart. Otherwise it would be just normal patches
---
So you'd like 18+ hours straight, 7 days a week, for 2-3 months with possibly 1min break here and there? That's quite brutal
---
Vini vermini vomui
---
you gotta get in premades it's still 12 minute games with all objectives
---
Happy cake day!
---
That aside :P I am absolutely against “Just cosmetics”. The moment you start monetizing a game the game starts to revolve around making you want to spend money. Anthem was “Just cosmetic” and you looked exactly the same from level 1 to max level unless you paid for cosmetics. It also takes away parts of the game such as knowing what someone did by their gear, or devs just make boring gear in raids and put all development and cool gear in the store. 
---
I am extremely against in game shops, I’d much rather pay a monthly fee and just make a good game i want to stick around for
---
Nope but I realize what type of person I'm talking to now.
---
Take care buddy.
---
Turns out when the best, most well-geared players that are core to your raid team don't want to split MC and Ony with people in Greens, they won't just not show up to raid, they'll just make a new guild for themselves.
---
Also, when you make your family member officer and put them on loot council over a month after content has been cleared, it will just give further impetus for this whole process.
---
pvp realm tho scrub. your probably a horde rogue who thinks ranking afk players on FP is PVP. LOLOL TROLOLOl stfu with this shit.
---
Cost $25
---
Cannot transfer to "full or densely populated" realms, and this restriction "may" also apply the other way around too (i.e. can't transfer away FROM a dead realm)
---
Cannot transfer from PvE to PvP (but the opposite works)
---
Cannot transfer to a realm launched in the last 6 months
---
Cannot change faction, race, appearance, etc
---
Straight from a Blizzard FAQ in 2006.
---
Sure...
---
I didn't know ice block dropped threat.
---
 [https://www.grammarly.com/blog/afk-meaning/](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/afk-meaning/)
---
That ok bud, no one's perfect
---
It isn't about the summoning as much as it is about the amount of games played without seeing some different content. As I mentioned most games I play - its alliance blitz-win 15 min. It results in  WTF who cares anymore attitude on Horde.
---
AFK'ing in patch 2.0 was waaaay worse than this. When you could AFK your way to full R14 gear in a couple of weeks. It continued in TBC too when you could buy the previous season gear for honor.
---
lol omg lol! LOL
---
You only need 20 points in the Holy tree to heal in raids which gives you a ton of freedom on what you can do outside of raids. That's one of the reasons I'm enjoying playing my Paladin much more than my Priest I played on a private server.
---
Most 60s I have spoken to about play time are around 3-4x what I have on my level 55. They just have more time to play I guess
---
Still my Current Guild, after a short time after launch our former GM Nixxiom (yes that Nixxiom) stopped playing, rumours was heard that he started playing Alliance on another server, he didn't say anything anywhere also i no videos on his channel, he just stopped. 2 Months i was Officer at that time and was told we needed to Purge the guild all of those who have been Inactive in over 2 months needed to go, so me and another Officer (Our GM atm) started purging away (we had about 750 members and got it down to about 350) i go down the list and see Nixxoms name and just say to myself "well rules are rules" and i removed him from the guild he started and promoted so much about, my Officer friend say to me "dude you just kicked Nixxiom out of his own guild" and we just start laughing like crazy. btw the guild is called &lt;Gravediggers&gt; on Zandalari Tripe EU feel free to join \^
---
The only fights that don’t cater to fury warriors are easily countered by protection pot and if your melee don’t care to use them who really cares what your comp is like anyways.
---
Hah, well the first thing I would say is don't do what my buddy did: DON'T GO BLACKSMITHING. Huge money sink really and not really worth it. 
---
For the most part he doesn't really use consumables (though I hook him up with a few from my alchemy), he has a couple greater fire protection pots and the healing pots (and be sure to hit your warlocks up for health stones!). Since he got Brutality Blade a couple weeks ago he's consistently been top 5 dps. He'll probably want a few elixirs of the mongoose for BWL, and some mighty rage pots and giants but it's not really hard to get enough gold for all that. We've had rag on farm for a bit over a month now, one shotting all raid content and easily killing rag pre-submerge (like most guilds out there right now.)
---
I would say go mining and enchanting (for disenchanting) and just do some DME jump runs, a couple of those and you'll be fine really. Though herb/alch is good too for money I've been finding on my paladin. Especially now that we can really farm again since everyone's in AV rather than roaming gank squads.
---
Because alliance walked into AV with the advantage and got accustomed to the 90% win rate there was the first few days. We got lazy and complacent and kept pushing the same old strategy while horde were forced to adapt.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you that alliance are dumber or lazier, I just think it's a product of being handed the advantage right off the bat.
---
Grind baby grind!
---
The real classic was 1.5 av, which had multiple systems in place to make rushing harder. The version we got certainly isnt real classic
---
32
---
That works pretty well, yeah. A big factor is just that LC is...prone to problems when it comes to loot and loot drama. DKP in general makes things a lot more fair. Want to burn DKP on your alt? Well, it's your DKP, that you earned for showing up, so fair. 
---
In vanilla, I had two 60s in the same raid guild, because it used DKP. In a LC system, it is more advantageous to not.
---
There is no depth to the current alliance blitz either but at least with a 40 40 zerg I get to enjoy more of AV than 15 min its over and loose game.
---
Is it possible to turn in the tier 1 and 2 scourgestones (I cant remember the names) for AD rep beyond revered? I'm asking if all 3 tiers can be turned in to exalted, or only tier 3 stones.
---
2 instant aoe, 2 instant get out of jail cards, did i mention they can instant refresh their cooldown too?
---
Totally agreed ! Just watched a video and got exhausted FOR the person ha .. I mean zero room for error. And imagine fucking up at the boss and having to reset I would die .
---
Name?
---
It’s settled then.
---
Sorry you’re offended by definitions.  Have a nice day Care Bear :D
---
I've done tribute runs on a fresh 60 hunter, kills are slower but you'll pick up some gear while doing it.
---
Elven rings, ogre hauberk, the 2h sword 
---
Also make sure you get the crossbow from AV
---
All my gear as a resto dduid is boring af. I'd love to change the look if it was a one time purchase
---
NO JOKES ALLOWeD IN THIS THREAD

That wasn't even unique to alliance on Fairbanks, there were times when Alliance took BRM over as well and it would take many corpse runs to get to BRD.  Because of the numbers disparity Alliance couldn't hold the top side for long typically, but there were several nights where they held the bottom for 6+ hours. 
---
Fairbanks alliance put up a very solid fight in P2 considering their numbers disadvantage.
---
Well  only the #1 Heroin shooter gets some super good Heroin.
---
The others near the top get some decent heroin.
---
Everyone below the top 12% gets tylenol PM
---
premades wont go turtle and spend an hour in there

Shadow is fun as hell and your able to take down other classes that are 5 lvls or more higher. Just yesterday I’m lvl 52 and running on my mount through Felwood not paying attention half playing wow and half on my phone when a lvl 58 warrior comes out of nowhere and jumps me. I try to run at first but he landed a hamstring so I said fuck it let’s fight even though he took me down to half health already. Pop a shield throw on my 2 dots and vampiric embrace, fear that bitch hit him mind blast and then just mind flay that ducker dead. Felt so good putting the assholes ganking lower lvls down a peg or two, since he was the only ally that had been a dick and attack all night every other alliance player questing around me was chill and even helped each other a few times when one was looking like they might die.
---
That about wins for guild drama
---
When not asked to join on alt but playing it anyways:
---
 Main-mainspec&gt;main-offspec&gt;alt-mainspec&gt;alt-offspec
---
When asked to join on alt during progression:
---
Main-mainspec&gt;alt-mainspec&gt;main-offspec&gt;alt-offspec
---
When asked to join on alt during non-progression:
---
Main-mainspec=alt-mainspec&gt;main-offspec&gt;alt-offspec
---
That wasn't an insult to you tho, and I never said I hate you, you're purposely misconstruing my words to make you seem like a victim for some reason.
---
When I say you are projecting because you may know it all too well, I'm allowing for the possibility that it's because others have been fake nice to you in the past so you have experience. I'm getting the feeling you thought I mean that you know it because I'm saying you yourself are fake nice, which wasn't my intent.
---
When I said I'd hate to think , I didn't mean I hate you for thinking that way, I meant I hate to think this is all a miss understanding, that you are bundling everyone who does it as being a certain way just because you may have had a bad experience with others before.
---
It's also quite silly for you to think I'm worked up because I post long replies. I have tons of free time at work and it's just an outlet to pass the time, trust me I wouldn't have bothered with any of this convo if I wasn't bored out my mind. 
---
And I'm not scarred from people being mean to me (and this is kinda cementing in my mind you are just skimming what I'm writing). I wrote that I observed other guildies squabble over it, never mentioned I did or that anyone targeted me or anything. I was simply a third party observer who anecdotally noticed that most people tend to not care and the only one who did was the type to hold a grudge in general, at least in my old guild.
---
IM SORRY
---
I eat frost mages. My build is 10/34/7. Once they blink, I hug them to no end. I beat a bunch of other classes 1v1 too. I wouldn't say Feral is the worst pvp spec. 
---
I don't think his response was "shit." He made good points regarding a Druid vs a Mage. You're not exactly adding any advice with your response either.
---
Who said I pugged it? The entire point was you can’t pug it
---
Inertia is looking for some great PVP Mages. Guild has lots of old rank 14 players and raids weekly. We have over 40 people on late into the night every day of the week. Alt Raid roster still has slots available. Message Redrosid, Rush or Prod in game and tell them Power sent you
---
Read your restrictions in your own post lmao, since you clearly did not play I can tell you it did not work as you think and was extremely limited.
---
The most popular server back in the day was blackrock and if it was possible every single player would have transferred there.
---
I grinded to exalted on my main and saw the NPCs summoner 4 times total. It’s rare to see which is kind of exactly how it should be since the only use for this NPC is to try and break a mega turtle.
---
How are they supposed to farm Silithus in between BG queues?
---
Yeah I was leveling my mage in Winterspring and 2 mages about my level came to gank me... Except I handily 2v1d them because they were AWFUL. I'm there with Ice Barrier up and start winding up a fireball to see if they'll bite and sure enough they both go for the counterspell so I got free reign to cast Frost spells and polymorph. I think I ended the fight at like 50% health without potting... They might have been the worst mages I'd ever seen.
---
It don't really drop threat like feign death but while in Ice block mobs will target the next person on the threat table.
---
I'd guess it's because they have one of the simplest combat mechanics, thus the easiest to script for.  It's mostly just stabbing of various kinds.
---
WOW!
---
Why not just put it in the game and earn it? There’s no sense of accomplishment if you just spent some money and looked however you want. They started doing that in retail and look, now they have a seasonal cosmetic shop, exclusive cool gear in recruit a friend, and now they have no unique tier gear for classes in game and all raid gear looks extremely dull and lazy.
---
It’s bad for the game for lots of reasons
---
Fight duration is huge. Shorter fight = RNG matters more, higher % of uptime for damage boosts, less chance you'll need to waste a global on lifetap, etc. Gear can be variable but I'm sure all top lock DPS have guilds that kill things very fast.
---
Myrmidons signet is a relatively cheap epic that I believe has a low level requirement.
---
Keep an eye out for ranged weapons around level 40. I had a gun "of the tiger" that lasted me quite a while after hitting 60.
---
Also, I am not sure if you did a wrong somewhere. I did the whole grind myself in single long day (14-16 hours). That's why I said it.. Maybe the non-boss stones are worth more? Maybe 40 min is to slow?
---
I'm going to have to check it out. I've also got that +daggers Mugger's Belt so all combined I can get up to 321 daggers (which is beyond overkill I think.) Been trying to juggle weapon skill, hit, and crit and I'm not sure what combo is best.
---
On my server blue sapphire goes for ~20g and AC for ~45g
---
With 30/0/21 build, you'll have a really difficult time keeping a close distance against a Frost mage. I've never tried that build so I don't have such good advice for you. I guess only thing I can suggest is to try to outlive the mage? Do you have mana problems while in the 1v1 combat?
---
He was referring to a raid, not a dungeon. The loot rules change when in a raid and items that are bop can be traded for 2 hours to anyone in the raid if they arent equipped.
---
A family? Christmas events with friends? A job? Not necessarily night clubs but there's plenty good reasons people aren't grinding out AV at the moment
---
For raid consumes, just doing instances where I still need gear from throughout the week. I vendor any BOP items I win, any grey items I pick up, and DE any greens that vendor for below 2g. I'll probably run 3-4 of these per week outside of raid times for a good 5-10g chunk of gold per instance. 
---
If I need a fairly large infusion of gold I'll start some Dire Maul East jump run groups, which is what I did the entirety of P2 wPVP to make money for my Lionheart helm. Bare minimum you can make at least 10g per hour off vendoring the drops alone if you are 3-manning it, and that amount spikes very quickly if you luck out and get big cash boosters like Felcloth, Arcane Crystals, Essence of Waters, or Foror's books. 
---
Here's a great economical way to make money in DME if you are starting out: Find a healer with herbalism and tell them they get reserve on all herbs, that is an easy 2-4g per run bonus for them. You can either try to reserve the Thorium veins here or offer to split the profit with the healer, and decide on how you guys want to split the rest of the money makers (BOP loot, essence of water, arcane crystals, thorium, etc). Sometimes I offer to reserve the Essence of Waters for the healer to grease the wheels a bit. Then I spam for DPS in LFG for a while or look for a guildie who needs the +hit bow or +spellcrit neck, and say the high-value stuff is reserved but their preraid-BIS is reserved for them. Over the course of me farming the mats for Lionheart, I ended up gearing 9 melee DPS with their bows, 4 casters with the spellcrit neck, and meeting a bunch of cool people along the way!
---
How would you all deal with/value an item that seems to never appear on the damn AH?
---
I got a Death's Head Vestment well over a month ago, and I (running tsm) nor any of my guildmates with TSM have a value for this item. Never seen it on the Auction house. Tried doing a trade asking for offers with no results either. It seems like a decent chest, nothing great, maybe twinking. But the rarity of it must be rather high considering no TSM value.
---
This is half question half warning, I suppose.
---
I'm currently playing an Alliance lock(SM-RUIN) and I absolutely hate PVPing. you basically lose 90% of your fights &amp; have NOTHING to do against most classes in BGs.
---
Will of the Forsaken is super broken.
---
The entire point of being a lock is fearing people while DoTs tick, by playing Alliance every class is basically immune to fear &amp; you have almost no other tools to do bursty damage or run away from incoming damage, which means you'll die to almost every class that is decently geared at 60.
---
There are a few things u can do like use engineering etc but none of them is actually part of the toolkit the class offers, meaning you'll have to spend gold just to have a CHANCE to win(FAPs, LIPs).
---
Warlocks scale well with gear which means that if you don't plan on  raiding/getting r10 at least you'll just feel gimped unlike other classes that can do better with blues(mages, rogues for example).
---
I'm specifically speaking about wPVP/BGs, obviously in duels even as SM/Ruin u have a decent chance against all classes, but duels just don't represent what really happens, so stuff I read before choosing to play Alliance lock are very misleading(for example, "just counter WOTF by using deathcoil then fear after it's over!").
---
Basically if you are reading this and thinking about playing an Ally lock, don't, unless you care only about PVE in which case you'll be very wanted(almost all Alliance guilds need a lock, at least on my server).
---
Here is the question part - is there anything I'm missing? do I just really suck at playing the game? I legit lost most of my will to play the game because of this, and don't see a solution other than leveling an alt which will take quite a while to get to 60 or play as SL which is subpar in AV and only OK in WSG and respeccing twice a week.
---
Another question: why isn't escape artist the same as WotF? Immunity to slows for 5 seconds could actually make people choose to play alliance &amp; give some classes a decent chances against others(warriors come to mind the most, obviously).
---
It's obviously OP, but still not as OP as WotF/orc stun resist.
---
I've used it since launch, no ban. I use steam link.
---
Its ok I will forgive you this one time.
---
Great video BTW, cant wait to try this tonight :P
---
yeah theres tons of people for those early dungeons
---
Reckoning is part of the best PvP healing spec.
---
Honestly, if he was getting camped in P1 he was probably the one starting shit all over he place and got himself on a lot of KoS lists.  Most people played pretty nice in P1, but I did mercilessly camp a few people who killed me while fishing.  They brought that shit on themselves though.
---
We have LC where every single raider has to fill up a sheet with a value from 0 to 12 for every item, where 0 means you don't need and 12 is BiS forever (there is a value for RP, pvp, sidegrade, upgrade etc). Then every class leader review it, discuss it on discord and everything is reported on a public spreadsheet.
---
So far no drama involved because you know who will get what and if you have a problem with something you just have to discuss it prior on discord.
---
Another thing I find great, items who have an obvious PvP value over PvE are "PvP rolls" where higher ranks have priority. It sucks when you are a casual pvper but I find it very fair for our rankers. Like our r9 troll warrior who is a new member will have BRE over me because I'm casualy ranking (6 atm), even if I have been raiding for 2 more months.
---
Yeah 5-6 attempts would be like 2 hours for horde.
---
It's fookin amazing, but I dont pretend it takes a shitload of skill.
---
It's more like the meta gaming is important. As rogue or mage you can be an absolute dick on the server and do just fine. As a warrior you can mediocre, but be a nice dude. So you are a nice person, have friends (priest + shaman) and just roflstomp stuff, because you global people for 5k. 
---
Just recently my shaman WFd, my priest dispelled the enemy priest's shield, I charged: autohit, sword proc MS. It didnt even crit and I did 2100damage in one GCD.
---
Use steam link, and download advanced interface options to turn raw mouse input on while you're on remote desktop, that's what causes the spinning camera.
---
AV is by far better for Alliance using premades. It’s not even close.
---
To me, it sounds like you could pay $25 to transfer away from a low population server. 
---
In 2006, there were no censuses with accurate data on what faction dominated what server, it was all player rumor. The problem here is people care too much about Blizzards decisions instead of just playing the game. 
---
I’m gonna dip out of this conversation since I took a quick peek at your post history and it’s pretty much exclusively you complaining about games you play. Hope you find some more productive use of your time!
---
I ran have experience running a guild on pservers and in classic. This has happened to me a few times. If someone is threatening, blackmailing or just not positive in guild i will boot them. Telling the GM to boot someone or they will leave or give me loot or i will leave will result in you leaving lol. Fearlina Horde side here &lt;TehBox&gt;
---
My Guild was SUPER active for the first 2-3 weeks after I joined.  discord shenanigans, talks, SM runs, etc.  Then They just kinda... Stopped?  Like, I got on discord and they were like "hay bogusadult, we are playing this other non-mmo game for a bit before we get on.  Feel free to join us".  And it was the same every night after that, until they just stopped getting on wow two weeks later.  I would listen in, but I wanted to play wow, not something else. So I just /gquit and went guildless for a bit. I am in a random 'new player' guild for now, every now and then helping new players like myself with dungeons and whatnot if I have time. But I plan to leave when I get to 50 to find a more vocal guild that I can get to know better.  
---
I'm on  Ashkandi  if anyone knows of any good guilds that don't require a strict schedule (I can play every night for 2 weeks, then not at all for a week.  Work and family are more important, but I do like to play)
---
Did not think about this...
---
You take the small one.
---
Is there a quicker way to update add ons rather than just manually updating them and dragging the new files to the AddOns folder?
---
People on this sub will not let go of personal experience over overbearing trends in data, it is not worth trying to convince s/o who calls data and research a dork's spreadsheet. It just like the people who go outside in winter and saying its cold so therefore global warming is a myth.
---
You must be new. This has been the standard rule for all major private servers for a decade.
---
Beeing a bunch of adults who can wait more than 2 weeks to get every items they want helps a lot with LC
---
I don’t think you understand what’s happened with it. The game is the same as it was back then.
---
You can shadowbolt spam without any talents allocated at all.  
---
The question is why would you want that many points in Destruction for a PVE build that will just be spamming shadowbolts?
---
Classic is a social game, reputation matters. If anyone ever ninjas or does anything negative with the guild tag usually ends up with them getting a boot.
---
The proc rate of poison and/or crusader might be pushing the distracting higher than I thought
---
I"m just learning this after losing 11 av's straight, wherein i try to tell ppl to do stuff. Suddenly i decided to just say what alli are doing, and what i'm doing. Won the last 2 so far. things are looking up!
---
We had a queue last night on Fairbanks guy.
---
Hi, /u/Shoo0k

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/edfb5n/this_week_name_a_more_iconic_duo/). 
---
Free action potion can prevent mage having multiple instant cast AoE with high damage?
---
I guess it depends on your goals......are you going to tank at 60?
---
Personally, I would sell it and get unyielding maul. the price should decline on them over time, so you could always buy another if need be.
---
also consider, getting into execute phase with 100 rage works wonders and after the first exe ragepot &amp; another with high rage.
---
I mean, if they are that level of min maxing, they can likely pull off decent numbers with simple prebis from dungeons
---
this only becomes an issue if they were in pre bis but was doing AQ40 trying to save DKP / PR by not spending it in MC/BWL gear.
---
Why the fuck would anyone be standing there at this time, anyone online is out leveling/farming since you can do that now or standing at the battle master.
---
There are no battlegroups. Battlegrounds are fully cross-realm with any server in the same region.
---
This is what i always say about Classic +
---
I don't trust Blizz.. And neither do you guys, thats why you play Classic and not Retail.
---
Thanks I did not know this
---
Another baseless claim I bet, the guy is chock full of them on this sub
---
Use the twitch app to install and update addons automatically.
---
He didn't just want tank gear, he wanted everything. And when he got thunderfury he said he was going fury, and demanded that we pay for  everything, including epic mount and quel'serrar. Our new main tank actually put effort in and farmer arcanite bars.
---
Hotfixes are literally just anything that doesn’t require a patch. There’s no rules dictating how or when they are applied, just that a patch isn’t needed.
---
It's not so much about the literal speed of the clear, it's about carrying people who are dead weight. I expect.
---
They have disabled AFK reporting because of the abuse seen with players ranking, premades, and streams. Until they figure out a better reporting method. I know things.
---
So... a pve care bear.
---
As far as the pieces I can see, I am full BiS. I earned it already. The gear looks like shit. Even T2 looks like shit.
---
Misread, my mistake
---
Right? And you know the video is of a *successful attempt*. Who knows how many it took to learn.
---
I was boomy 30/0/21 and I just spam moonfire, keep rejuv on myself and throw a regrowth when needed fake casting him. Didn't lose to anyone.
---
Weird flex but ok.
---
True. At least my guild has an alt run MC/Ony and at this point, I don’t mind starting with that alt run and working my way up.
---
Unless you are raid tanking, the Maul should be fine.  For 5 mans, the Staff is a bit overkill.
---
Classic will be monetized at some point. Plain and simple. It's too big of a cash cow not to. Just look at their making paid transfers available already (it's 1.11 content released 3 phases early, reeeeeeeeeee). They could have offered it at $5-$10, but stuck with the $25 price point they've had for 13 or so years.
---
A big thing to remember is what they monetize.
---
Cosmetics, imo, are perfectly fine. They have zero gameplay interaction and offer a little something extra for those that are happy enough to put more money into a game (hobby) they enjoy.
---
Blizzard has never offered items that increase player power. Ever. The closest is the paid character boost service. But that merely circumvents the long, largely uninteresting leveling process in Retail. the gear it provides you is on par with basic leveling gear, not even the minimum items you can get from your very first world quests.
---
\#NoChanges will not change the eventual monetization. That tagline wasn't a Blizzard tagline btw, it was playermade. Blizzard are NOT beholden to that. They already changed many things, even before launch. Regardless of whether they go with Classic+ or "TBClassic", #NoChanges is already out the window and monetization is on its way. Might as well buckle in, or jump ship if it bothers you so.
---
That is the coolest thing i've seen yet. I kinda wish my server did stuff like that... except it would be about all the fools streaming ... Fearlina here
---
&lt;3
---
Paladin throughput scales quadraticly with crit, it's not overrated, you're just downranking too much.
---
I think all the most skilled and best geared alliance got their exalted quicker (due to faction balance/queue), and now you're left with the stragglers.
---
&gt; No one silenced? No timely stuns? 
---
How do you silence or stun a mage inside ice block which can get out at any moment he want and blink?
---
Ha no. For that youll need a flavored resistance pot or dam absorb. But keeping them from freezing you in place will go a long way.
---
My shockadin set has most of the pieces already mentioned in this thread but I want to add I grabbed some mail shoulders from...DM N I think...that have some decent spell dmg on them with caster stats to boot. There are also some plate shoulders that drop off the rock boss in BRD but they only have like 9 +dmg on them.  
---
I believe you should be using SoC over SoR for the judgement dmg bonus against stun/incap targets.
---
The real issue is you went PvP&gt;PvE, now you can’t go back. 
---
I view transfers mostly as a trial anyways with the caveat that you can always switch back if you don’t like the switch... not in your case though. Oh well, can always re-roll.
---
What is the addon that showed the CD for your spells?
---
U can Look at the Classic duelers League Games from druids and mages perspective. Mandy Players also analyze their Playstyle in this Tournament Like Xaryu in YouTube He Talks about how to Beat Druid and how they counter.
---
Except the innumerable other reasons why some play Classic vs Retail.... Or those that play both.
---
I would be most excited to get a Flask or Shadow Power/Greater Arcane Elixirs.  Personally I wouldn't replace a 16 slot back with a soul shard bag, so that one comes down to preference.
---
We don't allow alts in the main raid because our raid is "hardcore". 
---
When we will have enough we will add an optional raid for the pvpers, the socials and alts.
---
I see, is there any reason why it’s needed to raid older content over and over? Are you referring to TF for the main tanks? If yes, I think people will blow though MC and BWL the more geared they get but I see what you’re saying.
---
but... why not?
---
TSG was fun...
---
Yeah, I hate when that happens.
---
I can tell what's going to happen in a game by what happens after Balinda dies. If 5-10 people port back and most of the rest of the Balinda group pushes forward, Horde will almost always win. If half the Balinda group gets distracted trying to take Stonehearth GY, we're definitely going to lose.
---
I think the biggest thing a single Ally can do to turn the tide of the battle is distracting Horde players during the Lieutenants/Balinda phase. Take some potshots at guys fighting Lieutenants and lead em over to Stonehearth GY and you'll splinter the group before they can mount an effective offense.
---
This is the perfect answer
---
Tbh that could simply mean there is a weight to the balance or a MTTH, not an off or on switch.
---
Pretty simple. Ally suck at PvP.
---
&gt; sims higher
---
&gt; but the other one is obviously better [because  it] isn't just crit it's also 1 more shadowbolt
---
**Dude, the sims take that into account.**  That's the whole point of the sim.
---
WOTF sucks, but its OP, it will eventually get nerfed to a 5 second immunity. If I can, I will Bolt - Immo - Curse of Ag/Tounge and drain health. Usually by the time all dots are applied they are already at 50% health for one on one. If nightfall procs, its pretty much a 10 second instant death. A voidwalker would help a lot if you have to fight multiple people in pvp. You always have health pots too with healthstones, so as a caster, you can last so much longer than a mage.
---
I am 4 pieces raid BIS and majority pre raid BIS minus one ring, pants and a wand.
---
Yeah, this has been known for a while but requires the mage to have good timing and a group that is geared towards AOE. Much faster than going all the way to the end.
---
oh my.... RIP
---
This is the internet man. Everything you do is always bad and wrong no matter how much thought or logic you apply to the situation.
---
 "Oh this guy has a position of power that is greater than mine???! Well he must be the bosses son then! Thats the only way....he couldnt be better than me" 
---
Keep going through life, achieving nothing, and blaming everyone but yourself and see where that gets you. Lmaoooooo
---
I have seen mages do it successfully as well.
---
yep, undead Spriest is a fucking monster in 1v1, Devouring Plague is OP as fuck.
---
He doesn't realize you aren't looking to swap to lesser powered (r arguably equally powered) gear, but merely the look of what you've earned already.
---
The video here is showing how mage can cast multiple high damage AoE spells in extremely short time (and without channeling too).
---
is the dagger a better OH than mirah's or dal rends defender?
---
no
---
Yes, i'm sure a lot play both but end up liking classic better... dunno why, right?
---
Queues take longer and games started getting longer, so horde is now actually trying to win.  
---
  It was better for horde to let alliance win as fast as possible before when the queues took like 2 minutes to maximize honor gains, now that they're longer horde is better off actually trying to win.
---
If your answer is sincere, no shit. This has been my experience in AV. But why? What attracts the statistically like to be mentally deficient players to the Alliance?
---
The whole honor and av system is a beautiful demonstration of game theory overall, but it is not prisoners dilemma.
---
I'd compare it a bit to a game of chicken. The worst outcome is a full turtle no one wants that, but the horde is more willing to risk it and start defending
---
I did, and again I'm still not seeing it; where in that post does it mention 2H (what's the factor for it)? It looked like it was only in reference to dw. I googled quite a bit and couldnt find any additional supporting statement to the above blue post w.r.t 2h, and I dont recall a noticeable difference from my own (possibly flawed) personal experience of playing warriors in classic/tbc/wotlk
---
The thing is, monetization and microtransactions have this terrible connotation that come with them, but it can be done right.  I happily purchase supporter packs for Path of Exile, because of the respect I have for GGG and how they engage the community and are transparent (and this is considering that Tencent is a majority shareholder).
---
Blizzard/Activision's monetization just feels like thinly veiled cash grabs.
---
All mouseover macros resets combo points.
---
&gt; bare witness
---
Are you going to be naked or something?
---
av Ranking is killing the game, blizzard really needs to nerf these honor values or there won't be any competitive pvp at all. Ranks will be free because it's so easy to get honor in AV and wsg/ab will be dead no matter what. WSG is the best battleground to exist and everyone just sits in av, it's really sad. Private servers were better.
---
So did you only want to pvp when you are twins vs fresh lvl 10s?
---
And now try a top-tier leveling class, like a hunter.
---
So its a company policy issue, not technical
---
You get RP relative to where you stand compared to the bracket leader. SO let's say there's 10 people in your bracket, the first person will get 1k higher than the RP floor (for example, if RP floor was 5k, he would get 6k), then everyone else would get roughly 100 less than him compared to how they rank.
---
Well that's an entirely baseless assumption.  Many that play both realize they are separate games and treat them as such. Just as someone can play Demon Souls and Dark Souls 3 and enjoy both despite their flaws.
---
You're trying to project your bias, and that's just silly.
---
I dunno there seems to be a lot of em this go round. Can’t tell you how many mages would continually try polymorphing my Druid.
---
&gt; none of us had ever been there before and had no clue what we were getting into.
---
That's fair and all, it's just that there's nothing in DM:N that requires a bunch of learning. The Eye of Kilrogg is pretty much the only unique mechanic in that place. Maybe the eyes costs you one wipe before you know what they do, but that should be it. The DM:N guides out there don't even have sections for trash because there's nothing novel about it. All you have to do is just use your standard class abilities. Tank, spank, heal, CC. The instance is doable pre-60 in greens. A group of 60s that not only wipes repeatedly, but can't even finish is not playing very well. I don't mean any offense by that, I'm just saying it so that you can either improve yourself (if needed), or find people to play with who know how to play, if that's what you want. If you don't care, though, and you're having fun with the current group, then that's great.
---
God it’s like I’m still in /r/2007scape

Only a certain type of twerp child has an attitude like yours. What is your excuse?
---
When you spam in LFG for dps, you just get a full group? I thought jump runs were more efficient by doing duos with a healer. 
---
Also what’s the add on that gives you the disenchantment value again?
---
2H was already viable for alliance, dual wielding is still much better.
---
I already know where the game goes after TBC, it dies. I'd rather gamble on the slim chance Blizzard could give us Classic+ where we have classic gameplay with much more difficult pve content, minor balance changes and new zones. A game where AV ranking isn't the meta and Alliance is made more appealing as a faction.
---
cool
---
We've gotten to the point where every caster has Mageblade or Staff and done are starting to replace their Staff with Mageblade. Next staff is going to a druid for off spec.
---
The warriors are sad.
---
Exactly this. People will pass up upgrades and everyone goes for the couple big ticket items.  The people getting the big ticket items will be undergeared because they are saving all their dkp. 2 years i saw two DFT's... over christmas break we where short people and had to pug... did a free roll and the only  [Lok'amir il Romathis](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19360/lokamir-il-romathis) we ever saw went to a pug. You can save your DKP forever and never see an item. LC is the way to go if you want to progress as a guild. join a DKP guild if you plan on ditching the guild later to join a better guild for AQ40
---
I actually noticed this the other day playing on horde side. I followed the main group to belinda and proceeded to stand un moving in the middle of a \~15v15 pvp fight. I probably saved around 9 people from dying and not a single ally tried to focus me. By the end of the skirmish, we wiped their whole defense and only lost a few in the process leading to a pretty straight forward belinda kill. It's pretty amazing what a single healer can do when the entire enemy faction is oblivious....
---
The dkp is separate for separate characters. I can't burn my main's dkp on my alt. You also still have to go through a trial phase even though it's an alt and I raid with the guild on my main.
---
Striker's isn't even BiS, Blastershot is stronger.
---
what's that circular thign with the 16?
---
and whats doing your bars? they look nice
---
Jesus christ youre one of the cringiest people ive seen on reddit in a while.
---
&gt;Why are they dicks?
---
They aren't. It's just some people expect their hands to be held the entire time, and get mad when someone doesn't completely babysit them. Sometimes the answers get blunt because the questions are asked so many times "blah blah should I use edgies blah blah what's hit cap blah blah what are good weapons." All the info is there already in an easily searchable format.
---
Is there a good place for Guild leaders/officers to recruit people looking to move servers? I've tried the classic WoW discord and all the class discords.
---
Damn, I got to Commander and never AFKd in a BG... on purpose.  A few late nights on the weekend I'd play and fall asleep mid BG but that was rare-ish.  I remember the people on my server that got to rank 13/14 either had a group helping them or they were sharing accounts.  But many people on my server wanted more HKs and honor, they wanted to be a high rank with the kills to show for it.  Rank 12 with 200 kills?  You look like a loser who bought the rank.  Rank 13 with 117,438 kills?  You fought.
---
It's honestly conflagration that's the hardest part. It feels like it can hit from quite some distance. If you don't get nailed with it early the team generally should be fine. And if you do end up dying they can just res you at the end as the potentially expected sacrifice.
---
It's been speculated here that Rag targets the characters with the lowest GUID first (i.e. characters who were created the earliest).  No idea if that's true or not.
---
Honestly not your fault, that was worded very ambiguously
---
800 dps single target without world buffs lmao.
---
What, in full naxx gear?
---
I was in a queue last night, But it was only 40 people in queue
---
DW has more benefit from Devilsaur set due to Hit.
---
Oh there are real sims for classic now ? Sorry I tought ti was just stats weight.
---
Yeah and a surprising number of people saying some monetization is okay (Mainly cosmetic only). It’s like Monster Hunter World but your gear always looks like a default skin unless you go to the in game cash shop. I would not play that game. It’s sad that so many people thinking cosmetic cash shops are okay at all. Only in F2P games can I see that justified
---
Significant doesn’t mean majority, just nontrivial. I *would* tell you that.
---
I'd argue locks are easy if you are able to get a fear off but really tough if you can't (e.g. vs frost mages, warriors, spriests) as you're reduced to face tank and try to kite damage while wearing paper for protection.
---
if you use cs it doesnt aggro the last 2 packs
---
Avoid icyveins and wowhead. They're just a hodgepodge of information without much context.
---
Joana's guide is built for speed with a hunter or warlock. If anything it will help you shave time off. No in game support so you'll be alt-tabbing or looking at a phone/tablet.   Withy high level characters you can send the lock cloth to power level tailoring....buy robes of aracana for the quest to make the blue robes at L20 or 30 for your lock.  Other than that dungeon gear is a waste of time unless you have a high level friend to run you through content....just use world drops and quest items.  Wands will be your biggest concern...leveling a warlock you'll need decent wands but again with 60s already in your stable just buy them off the AH.
---
Skip professions except first aid till you hit 60 unless you can powerlevel the professions righyt out of the gate before you actually commit to leveling.
---
if you want to pve you go ally, if you want to pvp you go horde. that's my guess at least why you are experiencing that.
---
it does, you actively undermining other rogues. and the solo ony is just a big middle finger.
---
A) I was told (by some guy on the internet) that rag fireballs are tied to character ID. Some characters are targeted over others just based on that. (This may have been fixed)
---
B) those knock backs are Aoe AFAIK. Maybe you are standing to close to other players?
---
Doing remaining quests for gold is worth it. Plus you get reputation which you might need for a mount discount.
---
I stayed BM spec for a while until I got enough blues to make MM spec higher damage. Since Aimed shot is such a big part of MM damage, you want a good amount of crit, like 16% to make MM better than BM.
---
Dungeons can be short if you are in a good group that knows the dungeon. Take Strathholme Undead, it has lots of good gear for hunters; cloak, boots, crossbow, polearm, 1H axe, BoE shoulders, etc. it could take 1 hour or less with a good group, 2 hours with a bad group. Plus you usually have to spend time to find a tank. And then everyone has to travel to the entrance and not get killed while doing so.
---
My suggestion is to expect a dungeon to take around 90 minutes and possibly more, sometimes less. Listen to people who have done the dungeon a bunch of times and don’t hesitate to ask questions.
---
You know we’re talking about who AFKs the most hours in AV, right?
---
Read the getting verified submod
---
Classic+ isn't happening guys. Blizz wants you to Preorder Shadowlands.
---
I'm not sure trash has resist.
---
owning a tv and watching commercials in 2019 lmao
---
....That was pretty weird what u said about ur dad not being anymore... are u ok pal?
---
I'm just very confident that gathering herbs and ore is not something that people look forward to... it's something they feel obligated to do because of the potential reward. As opposed to me farming dungeons having fun and making money simultaneously.
---
“ducker” lol.  Somebody is on an iPhone! Just messin’.
---
I might try this.  One of the things I have dedicated the least amount of playtime to is PvP.  I’ve also got very little experience with priest, since my first toon when I didn’t know anything at all about WoW was a Lock.
---
This sounds like priest might have a fighting chance, so I think I might give it a try.  Thanks for sharing.
---
Please do, if there are any questions feel free to reach out.
---
I am a druid FC, I have most of the WSG jumps down to decent success (60 WSG I should say). 
---
There's only 1 I will never do which is the out of bounds one that exists, which a few people have reported and hopefully should be fixed soon. (It's one that requires heavily exploitation, and I believe IS bannable)
---
I have no problems with people being in tricky spots but still able to be hit by people who are at range. I do take problem with spots, where you are unable to be hit by anyone. So spots like on top of the tunnel is not a huge problem, you can be out of line of sight at times, but you can easily get boxed in by the enemy so it's a risk.
---
There's still a ton of spots on the map which are very difficult for the enemy to detect you, which is amazing to hide out in.
---
Have fun in WSG!
---
Server had a mega guild with like 8+ raid teams, then one night my guild finished raiding and ported into Org to see that a few hundred had quit and formed splinter guilds, think the mega guild GM transferred off afterwards lol
---
I am thinking 2021 we might have a real TBC server from Blizzard, still a ways away so I am going to sink my teeth into a few more privates, while classic timeline progresses.
---
what do you mean if i believe it to be true? its true.
---
it depends if you  are raid logging while there is still prebis to farm/ not exalted with your AV faction you are definitely a casual.
---
If there is no upgrades to get at the moment, then sure yeah raid log as much as you want as long you bring consumes and couple world buffs.
---
Lmfoa hahahahahahahahhahaha you gotta be like a 50 year old working at a gas station with an 18 year old manager to say some dumb shit like this lol
---
Crusader + higher dps &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (especially if combat)
---
Damn you threw that hard
---
&gt;Shadow also does not do more damage than a properly played smite priest,
---
???
---
You can deck out a hunter in almost all BoE items if you have the money. Devilsaur set, black dragonscale, dwarven hand cannon, beaststalker belt/bracers. It won't be BiS but still very good (it's all about hit cap anyway) for raiding.
---
Hunters also happen to be amazing at gathering, I picked mining/herbing and I am swimming in gold.
---
Yes, several good ones and they all are going to agree here.  Go check out the warlock classic discord.
---
5 int = 1 sp is a decent rule of thumb though, but you are almost never deciding on, say, 20 int for 4 spellpower, it's more like 16 int for 11 spellpower which is a complete no brainer.
---
They either blink further into the raid which should be paying attention after seeing an ice blocked enemy mage and immediately murdering them, or blinking away from the raid, which is still mission accomplished.
---
Stop making excuses and kill the damn mage.
---
meanwhile the governor of virginia actually did dress up like a klansman and slave for halloween in real life lmao
---
Horde racials are better suited for pvp. More pvp players roll horde, you're left with the ones who mainly dont tryhard as much
---
I am not okay with cosmetic buyables. We can differ on opinion as to whether or not they are acceptable. But they certainly do affect an mmo and how it feels. I subscribe to play this game.  If there isn't enough profit to keep a game maintained and developed from a subscription model with a game as popular as this,  something is being managed poorly.
---
This is new and original, and entirely not something we've seen over and over again in this sub the past week and also in game since Vanilla.
---
A fair percentage of the population have always chosen alliance to play the “hero” - it’s always been the “pretty” faction. Every time I’ve gotten forced into rolling Alliance by my group of friends it seems like half the god damned server is full of ivory tower idealists who may as well be RP-PVEing. People who go horde generally only give af about the best possible racials - i.e. min/maxing for the best possible outcome in a game that’s 80% RNG and 20% skill.
---
Actually you're right, MC has a level cap depending on its rank so you literally can't even cast it on a 60.
---
something about sticks and stones....
---
Yea it's definitely always hard for locks against rogues, warriors or hunters, but at least as horde against other classes you have a decent chance if u coil is off CD/u manage to get a fear off, you don't even have that as alliance atm.
---
Gear should make it a lot better obviously, but waiting 4-5 months just to start enjoying PVP is a big no-no for me.
---
They sell on my server for about 150g
---
Lmao. Okay thank you, good to know
---
Hey guys we’ve got a Chad here. His Alphaness has spoken. All must bow before his Monster-fueled leet pvp status
---
And you aren’t doing anything yourself now...
---
F the idea of Classic+ altogether, I just want BC then WotLK.
---
I'm getting PTSD flashbacks thanks to idiots and warmasters
---
Very much clickbait. It wasn't an "Entire" AV Zerg. It was like 1/4th of the team.  There was no sneaking at all. He just walked in there.
---
Lol Jesus that’s right. I can’t believe that guy didn’t resign.
---
Sure no just don't pull the mana burning pets
---
Came here expecting to see this. I'm in this guild, and can confirm this is 100% accurate.
---
The same ret paladin and toxic tank also managed to get a Foror's Compendium and compete Quel-Serrar within a few days of Dire Maul being opened. They touted it as the "world first Quel-Serrar" and loudly chanted it through trade chat. It wasn't even server-first; someone else on Pagle had gotten it earlier that day.
---
Strangely, I think I still dislike the toxic tank less than that ret pally. He was that much of an ass.
---
You realize the exalted rewards are bis for most classes right? Grinding AV has a clear reward at the end even if you aren't ranking.
---
Jail break / arena / lava run / quest run
---
It’s a great concept, and great in theory.  The biggest issue BFA players had with it is that it was tuned to be 100% win rate, and it lacks engagement.
---
Just like in classic AV, whether you choose to actively play or just try not to be booted out for being AFK makes very little difference.  Not being able to queue in with friends removes the social aspect.
---
They later introduced “heroic” warfronts that allowed you to go in with a raid to try and fix these problems.  Like many other things I’m retail WoW, the core ideas are great, but when they attempt to water them down and make them accessible to everyone while trying to make every player be the ultimate savior of the universe, the delivery is botched and the end product sucks.
---
Rofl, your guild is pathetic. You arent something to be feared. Just calm down and maybe you can stop being such a rookie.
---
Rfd is one of the hardest dungeons to find a group for.
---
Just because certain things were better than others doesn't mean it wasn't extremely skill based. Even playing a high tier comp, you still need to be better 99% of people to get gladiator.
---
I'm clearing space for a new player to come in and contribute, actually.
---
people were saying the same thing about "youtubers" 5 years ago. Look at it now.
---
Same story here. Think next mageblade is going to a paladin
---
They still die fast but it keeps melee dps on them which seems faster. Either way is probably about the same so it might all be pedantics. I'm in a pretty solid guild and we do it idk
---
Princess Moira Bronzebeard: saving her for the quest is called a Princess Run, killing her is an Emperor run. Note that you can't get any loot from killing her unless you've completed the quest to save her.
---
Killing Angerforge and nothing beyond it is an Angerforge run (often combined with an Arena run to become an Arena/Angerforge run)
---
People almost never do full runs of BRD.
---
Sitting middle is best honor/hour if the rest of the team is playing the objectives. AV is just awfully designed.
---
you are pedantic my friend, gl with your porn
---
Yes.
---
I have 2 arcane crystals in my last 200+ Rich vein hits, on Faerlina where it is packed to the gills.  If you are lucky mining can be great gold, and if you aren't it is a tremendous waste of time and energy.
---
princess is at the end. so for that your looking for an Emp(eror) run that kills the princess (not all of them do).  For anger, most people do arena/anger or arena/anger/golem runs where you do the arena event, then head over to anger, then golem.  People usually include arena b/c of Savage Glad chest and a few caster items.  Golem is usually included for a healer trinket+some others.
---
It is pretty cool having a life outside video games
---
Have you actually looked at the cash shop mounts?  Most of them are fucking terrible. Only a few look decent. There's also only 14 mounts in the shop. Hitting that "record number" isn't hard at all. BFA has released what? 3 mounts in the shop (technically 4 with the alabasters)? Pretty sure we got more in Legion (the boat is iffy, since it was offered as a promotion during legion and came back in BFA). Of those 3 (4), the alabasters were widely detested and considered absolutely awful.
---
There's many more available in-game that look much better. Though, I admit there's an asston that are basic and boring. We had an entire expansion of terrible reskins from wolves and horses to elekk and kodo, etc., so it's not just Alliance getting hosed. They offer so many re-skins as a gold sink (to a super inflated economy) and to bump of the mount count for the related achievements, that's about it. It's not to go "omg, look at these cool mounts in the cash shop".  If they wanted do so, they'd offer some really cool/cute looking mounts like other MMOS offer, such as a cute fucking llama offered in Tera. 
---
Also, the slippery slope shenanigans is a logical fallacy and should be gotten away from. If you want to use that, ANY transaction starts that slope. Guess what? We have paid transfers, which we've known would be offered from the beginning. We've known for 2 years. Microtransactions don't necessarily mean their entire design philosophy will change for the worse. It hasn't in retail, it [most likely] won't in classic.
---
Are you even a guild if you don't struggle to loot core hounds?
---
Loot council is never fair. The council will always develop a bias to certain people.
---
Also loot council develops this culture in the guild where everyone is sucking each other's dick to get credit.
---
I wasn't refuting him just adding to the conversation

1 easy trick.

Go from LFG to LFM.

Dumb fuck lol

---
i cheese for extra 2%, just sort by gole. 19 cast only 2 resist last week.
---
Playtime didn't benefit you at all if you wern't good. The correlation between playing a lot and high rank comes entirely from getting that practice in and actually becoming more skilled from playing a lot.
---
Really depends on the dungeon.  As horde I see lots of groups for RFC, WC, SFK, SM, ZF, and some for Mara, but significantly fewer for BFD, RFK, RFD, ST, etc.  Then once you get into BRD+ content there are a fair number of groups but you're definitely right that it's a much smaller pool than it was for the first two months after release.  It's also been harder to find groups for elite quests like the ones in Hinterlands.
---
How long did it take you to get him from the part where you actually spawn to this scene?
---
Thanks for the response. That just seemed really strange to me, but I’m pretty happy because I would much rather have the Wolf over another Kodo.
---
Yeah but you have to set the correct ones. Was just curious if they were set
---
Ever since about day 4 of AV, the entirety of the "hardcore" Alliance PVPers funneled into about 3 premade AV discords, where they'll queue up simultaneously and get 20+ people in one battleground with a unified, server specific strat (typically involving Galv&gt;LTs&gt;Drek). These groups have an absurd success rate of winning, but leaves the random groups that DON'T have the premades devoid of any leadership.
---
Solution? Join 'em. One only has the requirement of having 100% riding with the only punishment of not having the fast mount is temporary removal until you do. Another one I know of has said that if you don't have 109% speed (mount, carrot, spurs, gloves), your entire *guild* will be blacklisted.
---
The ranking grind ruined PVP in all forms and I will stand by that forever. There's discord notifications going out on servers to "kindly" not go over X honor (because you'll fuck over someone else in your guild/faction)... or else.
---
I mean if you are a horde player you sit in queue for 20mins then you lose an 8min match that you really have no agency in.  After the tenth match in a row like this I might start botting too.
---
Downranking WAYYY too much. I very rarely downrank FoL at all, and also have no problems with mana. But heal for a lot more on each cast lol. My max rank flash costs 1% of my mana pool, has over 20% chance to crit and crits for over 1k.
---
This is also a much better resource for gear. At the very least it has more gear pieces, you can change the stat weights yourself, and it is about 50000000000000000000000000000000x easier to read.

LONG HAVE WE WAITED
---
10k honor/hr is pretty bad for an alliance premade though. 
---
10k honor/hr is literally impossible for horde premades because WSG queues are like 15 minutes long.
---
He asked for pvp macros
---
A raid that isnt on master loot should be a major red flag in and of itself really. I also have only participated in master looted raids and mistakes have been made and players have been able to trade the items to the correct person
---
One of my goals in the original release was to get in here. Once I finally made it I realized it wasn't anything special, but now that I'm back at it again in classic all I want is to be able to enter once again.
---
I'm not in Fury. I'm in &lt;Zugma&gt; And you alli cry babys can qq on another server.
---
Character name same as my reddit name. Feel free to have a look. I'm sure a lot of those math nerds are ahead of me, but I'm top 1k for MC and Ony easily so I must be ahead of some of them too. Shooting from the hip seems to be working just fine I'll take a pass on the spreadsheets my man.
---
I’m a rogue and most of my games I start off 10/0/50ish. I’m not sure what you mean by rogues suck in BGs. I’m also usually up there as most HKs in our side as well as capped bunkers/GYs. We are able to pick our battles and if something looks like a sure death (literally opening in the middle of an enemy group) you don’t unstealth. Though I’ll be honest if I see a clothie at less than 40% hp in a pack of enemies, I’ll go for it for that honor.
---
the 1k honor wont matter when we have set caps for bracket 1 2 and 3, which are easily achievable by chilling in queue
---
Because I take joy in watching alliance scum cry and cry and cry? then sure I'm 12.
---
This version existed in vanilla so by definition it is real classic. Just is not the version of real classic you prefer.
---
Everyone who read that just had their mind DING
---
Could I see your logs?
---
Legitimately feel sad for you that you're willing to spend hundreds of dollars on pixels.
---
I understand that some people feel that leveling is tedious, but when you just buy a max level character... there's no sense of accomplisment there.
---
I think LC works better when everyone is committed time wise to the guild. 
---
If everyone is okay with staying as a 40 man for X amount of weeks, EVENTUALLY you will get fully geared. 
---
But a lot of people like to float around which can bring issues. 
---
Like in my guild we have a solid 40 members who have 80% attendance(i think 2 raids we have 38 and 39 people) and its running smooth. 
---
If you can get 40 people on the same raid schedule LC is the way to go because eventually you will get your loot.
---
I don't know... Grobb had many many more people than this at 5am this morning
---
Who tf cares what you or any alliance think. Get farmed. Bye felisha
---
Yea scholo maps are way off which makes me wonder what else is way off.
---
I read your post and compare it to another thread on Alliance AV a few days ago.  The poster basically kept arguing different ways to rush, but nothing was a strategy change to actually counter what horde was doing at the time.  
---
When that is mentality you are dealing with, you will have to work very hard to get minds changed.  Which is clear you are struggling with.  
---
My takeaway - Alliance want to race and enjoy insta queues and fast, easy rep/honor.  Horde needing to maximize rep/honor due to 15 minute queues are willing to force a 20 minute game fro the win bonus. Alliance has not adapted to this yet.
---
There’s no “leave it to Mages”. It’s on my person. There’s no point reserving loot with Crit% to them. Remove Curse cannot crit. It’s a wasted stat.
---
Damn I only have 1 fight where I had 97% hit on him, and that's the fight I unsurprisingly have done the best on lol
---
Yeah put me down beacuse I take the game serious. Get farmed lil alliance bitch.
---
Theres nothing in there for a rank 6 anyhow except the tabar
---
Wanna like an obvious Red Vs Blue follow-up series.
---
Yeah but going Horde also means PvP queues. Based on retail population numbers I went alliance to avoid Queues.
---
All of the more "tryhard" alliance players are able to form premades using discords because of the instant queues on alliance side. The long queue time prevents this on horde. 
---
This essentially takes a lot of the people that are willing to coordinate out of the alliance pug gene pool.
---
gotta work on your reading comprehension my dude. he didn't say he hates you at all. I'm on the side of fuck that fake nice shit, but you're reading way too much into this guys comment.
---
I'm not saying nobody did it but botting AV wasn't a thing in vanilla.  this version of AV barely existed in vanilla.
---
It is staggering there are people who actually watch his content.
---
This is blatent nonsense. Even if you run MC when you have AQ40 on farm, you don't use consumables in your MC run. Same for BWL /ZG/AQ20
---
Welp I cant disagree with you as an alliance player myself. For me I only pvp if it’s with my guild(l think most do the Same) so I would just find a big pvp guild and join that.
---
Tbf a picture on Reset night after the Holidays would be way more telling as most people are currently at work in the middle of the day and others are going out of town to visit family and friends or have already left.
---
TUF and ES are both great for PvP ret - because you can judge SoC off the weapon procs and save your HoJ for an interrupt or a finisher.
---
If you want a good proc wait until Halberd of Smiting.
---
Item 2 is meh...I see many solid Alliance PVPers.  
---
Unlike in Vanilla where good players were spread around (I think Alliance may have had a few more better players), I think better players went mostly Horde in Classic.
---
true.. all my RL friends quit : )
---
stick with guildies. they will stick around
---
Oh, this shit again. 
---
Fuck you.
---
Does the damage go through though? 200-300 is pretty decent compare to gutgore with only 75..
---
A mage can kite Drak if you don't have a hunter.
---
You *need* two tanks for Glyth/Rend, then Beast and finally Drak. For the rest of the run its really about making sure any undergeared (fresh 60) tanks don't get ripped apart tanking an entire pull by themselves.
---
You'll want two healers, one for each tank, or one for the tanks and one for the raid.
---
As far as dps makeup it shouldn't matter too much, just make sure you have one or two aoe-capable classes.
---
Ahhh, technically right.  The very worst kind of right you can find yourself being.
---
Blasted lands probably isn't doable with only two, its significantly harder than winterspring.
---
&gt; Best thing ally has is Paladins
---
FTFY
---
Some maybe. But not the ones I played on.
---
FYI, gamers are everyone now, not a select group
---
Someome trying to rank alone shouldn't be able to be competitive with a full premade organized group. Thats the problem. Someone casually and mindlessly spamming av shouldnt be able to compete with organized wsg groups in honor per hour. Thats the way it used to be, either you joined an organized group or you played 1.5x the amount of time to get the same honor.
---
Well basically all your points are factually wrong from my experience.
---
I play alliance so almost every que was with 1-4 friends.
---
The rewards are great and reflect the effort I put in.
---
Idk what your even talking about here there is no competition just a rep grind... And it's called a grind for a reason...
---
Never had more then 5 people in my 40 man raid ask never even remotely close to half the team.
---
It's both, you PvP to get the bosses then PvE.
---
While AFKing is obviously shitty, I would be careful about this, as this is considered griefing by Blizzards standards.  I know everyone has a hard on for shitting on the afk report feature... but this is what its for.
---
Someone got stomped in world PvP :,(
---
Honestly I was so afraid of my server dying or changing in anyway because of the transfers but it actually got a little better.
---
It's rough to level even with combat.
---
My guild currently has 1 class officer for Loot Council as the GM is the deciding factor if an argument needs to be settled. 
---
Each class officer talks with raid members of that class and we figure loot on a class by class basis with every member. 
---
If an item that can be used by multiple classes drops it is up to **Only** the class officers to mitigate what class will get X item this week.    And if it cant be settled our GM is the deciding factor.
---
so basically Asmon's server Olympus on Faeralina?
---
Not really, can take out packs of mobs with cooldowns. Single mobs are cake.
---
Your argument is void because paladins
---
Korrak's Revenge heavily implies they want to funnel players back into retail.  Really though you shouldn't assume Blizzard's motivations are malice when it's much more likely they are just lazy and greedy.  We have 1.12 AV because that was the easiest for them to implement.
---
But do you have 32 quest points?
---
Pretty sure they do unfortunately.
---
“Alliance scum cry” grow up you fuckin loser lmfao
---
Yes but we don’t know it yet
---
Zug zug chug a lug lug me gonna hit you with a mug mug!
---
Yet alliance can premade and absolutely roflstomp horde getting 3k+ honor and winning before horde even get 2k honor.
---
The guild I am in is using EPGP but on a longer decay, how much decay happens after a week for you?
---
LMAO so I was pretty sure this is how every mage was in real life now it is confirmed. That flat top just brings it all together lol god dam lol. /tear
---
My guild is among the most hardcore on the server and I, as a fresh 60 Friends and Family member find the loot council fair.
---
I was given stuff not needed by others, like T1 legs, Sorcerous Dagger and T2 helm. A Choker of the Firelord dropped. Yes my neck sucks (I was wearing the Ony attunement neck since Star doesn't drop). Should I get Choker because it's the biggest upgrade for me? Hell no. Give the good, rare pieces to the core members. DKP accomplishes the same thing in that case, but DKP also allows garbage like Rogues getting TF Bindings first or Boomkins or Spriests taking ToEPs. Just because it's an upgrade for you doesn't mean that it's the best upgrade for your guild.
---
The point is that the current AV meta reflects the worst points from retail, that initially drove the push for classic.
---
We really can’t blame the players for this.  This is how AV has been played since they completely gutted it right before TBC.  Blizzard knew this was coming, but they also didn’t want to put forth the effort required to re-create vanilla’s AV.
---
How did you pay? Sounds like it’s pending payment status
---
Well, yes, and no.  
---
The interplay between the Horde and Alliance is a game of chicken.  With The Horde, having longer queue times, having more to lose.  This provides a greater incentive for The Horde to risk the turtle in order to increase their chances of winning.
---
The unwillingness for Alliance players to alter their strategy is the prisoners’ dilemma.  Alliance fall, primarily, into two camps:  Honor grinders attempting to maximize honor/hour; and Rep grinders attempting to maximize rep/hour.
---
Rep/hour strat is to rush Drek.
---
Honor/hour strat is to rush Galv.
---
If your raid splits you lose.  If you adopt the opposing strat it’s basically equal to a loss (in terms of gains per hour).  If you adopt a more conservative strategy of balanced attack and defense everyone has lower gains per hour, but more than the previous 3 alternatives.
---
How do I have zero proof and or the burden? I am making the claim it will work the same as it did in vanilla, that is my proof and all I should need. You are the one making a claim for change here NOT me. The reason they changed the loot was to make their life easier with complaints. They won't be changing how zg enchants work that's just stupid bold claims YOU are making with NO evidence. Argent Dawn enchants can't be done in the not to be traded window just like in vanilla same as the zg enchants. Arcanums could always be done in the not to be traded window and still can both arcanums and argent Dawn shoulder enchants work like expected from vanilla. Where is your proof they will change it? You have the burden here not me.
---
Looks like "Seyu's Classic Warlock Essentials", which is a WeakAura.
---
https://wago.io/_d7zveX7T
---
kek flamelash is only horde :P i'd like a bit of both tbh! been thinking maybe zandalar or firemaw tbf
---
As Resto I just keep up moonfire / insect swarm and shift out of frost nova while meleeing them in caster/travel form.  They basically run oom because they are spamming instant casts.
---
Rejuv / swiftmend can usually keep me alive unless they get lucky crits.
---
Yes, proving a negative is always a simple matter, you uyter imbecile.
---
How about you provide any proof that anyone ever wanted 1.12
---
Oh, and private servers weren't pure 1.12, and had to do so out of necessity. The resounding statement from all pserver players, and Devs was for blizzard to avoid going for a pure 1.12 route.
---
Brought my alt one week cause druid is fully geared. They said as long as you aren't taking gear over mains it's totally cool. My alt is a lock and we have like 3 regular lock raiders. Got t2 helmet t1 shoulders and t1 gloves. Was a good night lol
---
NewGen on firemaw horde?
---
Exactly.. and you can lose it all in a couple of rolls!
---
True, though warfronts are repeatable for RNG shot at warforge/titanforge if u recall correctly.
---
No, it's not, you're not expending your mana, so you're playing wrong.
---
Thanks, I'm working on it now thanks to the links provided. (I wish I hadn't lost my Cadaverous Belt now, lol.)
---
ah cool, may see what a friendo thinks and maybe go there, seems like it'll be a nice place to go to
---
I personally run a more pvp speced sor spec that's 33/11/7 I have had great success with gives u kings for raiding as well as imp freedom. In ret u get the less CD on judgement and mana on judges. Then holy make sure u grab the imp 15percent dmg from sor judges as they scale with sp. I use the aura hammer from mc with the sheild from rag with this build. Its unreal for pve and pvp as well as nice for farming dme thrashers. 
---
I tend to play this more middle ground of fight between front and back line and actually fighting more than healing but focusing on my cleanses and freedoms while still being able to smack a fat heal when needed.
---
I've seen a lot of people attempting to make similar guilds on my server. None of them have gone anywhere. Turns out, while most people don't want to *literally* min/max, they do want to make steady progress and clear things efficiently. The problem isn't so much that the meme specs aren't viable, it's that the people who don't care about having a strong character also tend not to put a lot of effort into farming pre-bis gear, reading about fights, etc. You're not just collecting a group of less optimal specs, you're collecting a group of less interested/skilled raiders in general. When you eventually get 25-30 of them to show up, you'll take an hour to fill out with pugs, wipe 3-4 times per boss, lose a handful of people to loot drama and eventually stop halfway through. Next week, 10 people will show up and you won't have a raid. You'll get a lot of /gquits over the following week.
---
Anyway, sorry for the pessimism, but creating a guild specifically catering to "weaker" raiders is a recipe for disaster.
---
That is what Blizz has set out to do, it's not what the playerbase wanted, and the nochanges movement in particular was **against it**, so stuff a sock in it.
---
Ah cool, thanks! i'll talk to a friend and see where he thinks he'd like to xfer to \^\^
---
3 Healers is excessive, but a lot of groups are likely to fail with one healer on the trash in the last couple of rooms and the last boss.
---
The damage goes from enough incoming for one healer to suddenly needing two, assuming average players which people should be when talking in general terms.
---
The first time I ran UBRS as a Holy Priest I was nearly caught offguard by the sudden ramp up in damage as before that either myself or the other healer had been largely stood around doing nothing.
---
3 per preist the you mana. 50 second fight
---
I think it's cooler to not put others down about things you are presuming to be true, but I also don't have little dick syndrome.
---
In vanilla it worked with librams but never worked with argent Dawn enchants or zg enchants. Currently argent Dawn enchants don't work in not to be traded so it is very likely zg enchants won't either. Just like in vanilla
---
Yea, this isn't really knew, but useful information nevertheless.
---
15 Drek is fine if they actually go Drek. The problem is 15 Drek actually means 15 FW then groups of 2-3 peel off and head for Drek and die.
---
Honestly it's something that doesn't exist in classic atm. It's where you go into a raid you haven't cleared yet and wipe your way through the boss progressing to the end of the dungeon. Since MC and ony are joke raids no guild is doing progression raids through them. You won't see real progression raids till BWL.
---
I think this was one of the most daunting steps a hunter takes until they start the Petrified Leaf quest chain; where to go from here. 
---
Like most have said, solo farming dungeon instances can net you a solid, reliable income as you go along. I personally don't do them, but that has more to do with my laziness than the difficulty. As a fresh 60 that doesn't have engi maxed, you can't really do tribute runs. Mara would be an excellent second choice, especially if you had herbalism as you can get ghost mushies as you go along. 
---
Gearing for raids will mostly include you getting enough hit chance (you need 9% with 300 weapon skill at lvl 60 to hit Raid Bosses reliably) but if you aren't planning on it yet, just gather pieces as you do the dungeons. Most end game dungeons will net you some solid gear like True Shot Gloves/Shoulders. 
---
I would also disregard the pre-raid bis list on wowhead, just understand that you'd want 6% hit for max LVL dungeon bosses (someone correct me if I'm wrong pls) and 9% for raid bosses. Then you'll want Crit chance, Attack Power and Agility as your main stats. Try to get a set that you feel comfortable with, or really, that you think looks cool (I opted out of getting devilsaur set and build my own Black Dragonscale Set because I think it looked cooler with some solid stats as well)
---
If you wanna raid, get the lvl 56 wolf from LBRS, as it has the strongest buff the pets can give. Otherwise, most pets are viable but you want to switch over to MM for better damage over BM. 
---
I understand why you went LW/Skinning, but it can be hard to make money that way - herb/mining are much better for gathering money if you're willing to switch and level!
---
essentially 70/30 to alliance, probably too much of a difference for me to risk giving it a shot, thanks tho :p
---
What macro do you speak of?
---
This is exactly it. I was exalted after 3 days of AV going live and its mainly the loss of raid tanks that are either pre made or at least communicating with the healers/group.  The A Team finished already and you are seeing the B Team.
---
It is not. The W/L Ratio is not even close on average.
---
Can you pm me a link or two please if EU?
---
must be part of the ret mind set.
---
I am spec'd enhancement but I mostly heal and drop totems in AV. I know I can have good burst but I also can be cc'd really easily...so I focus on supporting everyone else.
---
How do we join said AV discord’s? Asking for a friend...
---
So he wanted to spend his free time differently and you and your guild got pissed?
---
Sounds like you're, and your guild members, are the toxic ones.  No wonder he left the guild.
---
This is the excuse you tell yourself before sleep?
---
I would just download the questie addons it applies this in game. Good luck
---
yah i'm horde and try to maximize my honor gained every game. and solo or small group kills give the best honor because it's less split. immediately doing bal then going north is usually the worst honor because you miss all the ally. so what i try to do is get a few kills ganking their 60% mounts at the start, then chase them south with cardot and spurs and try to get a couple more pickoffs before all the ally get in galv room. then when they leave galv repeat the process under the towers after. after that i'll usually run around the chokepoint area and into mid to kill solo players or small groups running south. i'll only go north or defend base if it looks like I can farm a lot more kills that way. this strat maximizes honor gained while still serving a purpose of disrupting their coordination and weakening their offense. i often get near the top of hks on the scoreboard but in contrast to a lot of other players in the game i'm not splitting honor as much so i might be getting double or triple the honor from kills as other players with the same # of hks who play the objectives- offence or defence in a group of 10-20.
---
Alts should find pug raids it's that easy.
---
If your guild needs you to raid on an alt to fill a slot that's a pretty bad sign but you should be eligible for gear since you were asked to come on that character.
---
I mean I play holy paladin so I don’t shred anyone I just support my team way better than any other class can lol
---
You gotta "know a guy" basically
---
The entire pvp system is like high school cliques.
---
*rages in premade*
---
Finally someone who gets it! You can see in the replies who is ranking/has ranked and who has no idea what it is like. Best of luck to you on the R13 grind. That is audacious. I've decided that my ceiling is R11 because Whitemane Alliance are insane.
---
You must be alliance.
---
Sitting in a 15 or 20 minute que for a game of 10 minutes that's a loss is around 300 rep. For 30minutes. That's 600 rep an hour and you sit there doing fuck all for most of it.
---
Why would we horde want that?
---
I'd rather play and make 1200 or 1500 rep in an hour in a 40 or 45 minute game and a 15 or 20 min que.
---
I dont enjoy ducking around when I have limited playtime. Why would I want to sit in que?
---
It's dead, transfers could be free but noone would take then cuz why the fuck would you. The server is going to end up getting merged into another server.
---
Ok boomer
---
Look if you don't have time to play your magic card games and play wow that's on you.
---
You must be at least honored to be eligible for attunement, and the requirements go down at revered, and becomes free at exalted.
---
Because u r human, tuf &gt;oeb for 2h slam spec, as 3.8 speed with flurry allows for no downtime witg the macro, and 3.4 speed has 0.4 seconds downtime.
---
would probably want to go to a pvp server, but thanks though xoxo
---
Lmao this is trash
---
If you're suggesting turtling in order to improve odds of winning AV, the reason you're getting pushback is because it doesn't benefit us to extend the matches, at all.
---
We get the quickest honor and rep per hour by keeping them short.
---
The definition you just gave has no indication that is has to be applied instantly
---
maybe, probably looking at one of the top 5 servers tbh to go to, will see about it though!
---
&gt;JTPWNz
---
Just East of Winterspring, the village of them. The Elite in the cave has a 100% drop rate on 1 Winterspring firewater too.
---
I meant for AQ you need a lot more consumes than for MC or BWL.
---
hes natty btw
---
This fix doesn't REQUIRE downtime, blizz is just choosing to have it be implemented the next time the servers restart.
---
It's been a thing for 15 years bro... Id never join that raid but lots of other people seem to.
---
Not that I disagree with anything you’re saying, but did you guys think we were all lying when we tried to say the vanilla wow honor system was total shit that simply rewarded players for their time and for doing things like account sharing and botting?
---
Not a hotfix..
---
Deathchill armor is pretty sexy
---
Those streamers who were all riding the hype wave for Classic were already losing a to n of viewers, once they started streaming boring AV content I am sure more people realized how boring they actually are. Watch Asmon or Swiftly, they're not good players, but they're at least entertaining enough when the content isn't.
---
Thanks for the reply mate!! For sure!! Sounds like I will still have to make some guide lines to create a successful raids! 
---
Eg get your pre raid bis. If you are playing a meme spec (eg ele shaman, then make sure you get your flasks, buffs etc) 
---
My idea to maintain a consistent raid group is via the distribution system. 
---
Planning to run it via rngesus (roll) 
---
You can win up to two pieces of loot per raid. If you come in 3 consecutive weeks you can win 3 pieces of loot. 4 weeks in a row = up to 4 pieces. If you miss out on a week your back down to 2 pieces where you have to start again :) 
---
no main spec or off spec rolls. Just roll for what ever you want. As I'm sure some people people may have to change specs later in the future to help progress. I'm sure it'll make some drama but fuck it. It's called meme spec for a reason 😂😂😂 will have to make some guidelines on some equipment for sure though like mage blades etc
---
Also planning on having two raid groups! Casual group in the morning 11am. If the guild gets big enough or if people start to show a bigger interest in Serious raid then making a second raid group later in the evening such as 7pm with a dkp or other loot system. 
---
Hopefully that way we can kill 2 birds with one stone and keep the memers and the serious people happy 😁
---
Thank you for your reply Its given me some more ideas to work with!!!!!
---
God an even more pathetic guild. Just calm down
---
exactly... thats what im saying. its not a "hotfix"
---
its just a bug fix
---
Can I get a TL;DW for the video?
---
This is a solid factor. When half the raid is on slow mounts, zerging is much harder to pull off successfully.
---
I’ve been having 20min+ games all week. Today one that went for 1h 30min. And to top that off, queue time is now at 20 mins. Two more games though for me to get exalted. Then I’ll be good on AV for a long while.
---
I think the only real reason for speccing Shadow is PVP. On a PVP server not being an easy prey is key or otherwise it impacts your leveling significantly. If I was on a PVE server I think I couldn't have totally do everything as Holy or as my previous horrible mixed up spec, but if somebody ganks you ... it gets pretty hard.
---
Probably because of 20 min queues and that almost everyone has the rep already.
---
Sitting in 20m queue for 5 min base rush isnt that fun and you actually get quite some honor for kills.
---
I am a horde and we started defending Galv with 10 ppl or so and usually wipe the whole raid, and then its massive PvP at Galv or SH GY.
---
I said cool and you blabbed more, you relax.
---
You just had a definition that said hotfixes are fixes to live services. Wow is a live service
---
It's both tbh, the hardcore alliance players have gone elsewhere, but saying the horde hasn't gotten better is not true. We still get rekt by good premades, but im in battles even vs premades where we still manage to win.
---
I mean if your only profit from a profession is a single rare drop from a rare node, i wouldn't call the entire profession good for money. Herbalism still makes 15g a stack for other items like plaguebloom. Meanwhile truesilver is selling at vendor price, and thorium isnt much better.
---
perfect greens, vectus neck, skul wand, the blue shadow wraths.
---
Scholo dagger isn't even the best option, though i have new moon already.
---
Had a priest trying to claim it’s bis healing trinket which it probably is but it’s going to caster dps first. Because when things die fast you don’t need a heal trinket.
---
i do more raw healing than any other pala and the only thing i need to do is use a single mana pot? that is worth as fuck. okay instead of using a mana pot i can use crit gear and then i do less healing than i otherwise could. im trading 2.5 gold to do +100 healing per flash of light. 
---
also my guild does ony with 17-20 people usually.
---
My only requests are that we don't go further than Lich King and we don't, under no circumstances go down the path of ruin that OSRS took
---
TO me the best solution is recycle phase 1 with less servers for people that love playing through classic and experiencing the game again.  Then everyone that has a wow classic subscription now is apart of a TBC server.  TBC fixed many of the big annoyances with classic, such as honor system, hots and dots, and gold being hard to farm to pay for raiding and respecs.  There is literally none of my friends or guild mates, that I have approached, that would answer Wow Classic is a better product than a Wow TBC product.  None of them would suggest someone to come play the Naxx phase 6 in classic, if there was an option to play on a TBC version of Wow classic.  
---
To summarize, move every single phase 6 player into phase 7 with a TBC release.  Open a new set of Phase 1 servers for the FRESH experience of wow classic, and if enough people get behind it address many of Wow Classic's annoyances with the August 26th release of wow classic up through phase 6 like no BGs in at the start of the honor system or release them after 7 days instead of 28.
---
Rogues, along with hunters are the best open world farmers in regards to herbing/mining. I mine epl (silithus when epl is busy), I make a b-line for the node, run through all mobs and then vanish, then move to the next node stops. I can mine much more efficiently then any other class who has to kill to the node and sometimes kill their ways out of some areas. I can make a couple hundred gold a day if I dedicate my night to solely farming.
---
Bandages, CC and cooldowns are enough honestly. Gouge &amp; bandage being the big one for constant grinding.
---
yes live service aka when WoW is running not when there's a downtime (aka scheduled maintainence)
---
The best way to play this game is to never interact with anyone in PvP because anyone touching their keyboard is a jerk
---
Just respecced to elemental at level 41. What should my typical rotation look like? I find myself running out of mana pretty quickly - esp in dungeon runs. I'm not sure if it's because I haven't gotten enough intellect gear yet or I'm just being careless
---
It's become more of a thing the last few days I think.  I didnt see it the first week or so.
---
thats a good looking ui homie
---
I agree, kinda. It was a super fun expansion, but it also introduced the dungeon finder. I had fun playing the game, but I played a lot of it solo. The cohesive community aspect was pretty much over by the end of Wrath.
---
TBC was the pinnacle, IMO. It improved the worst aspects of Vanilla and was overall a fun game to play.
---
There will be casual guilds and pugs still running old content 2 years from now. You'll be fine.
---
Premade wsg is better. You do AV for rep amd them Never touch it again usually. Unless you have a 20 premade for AV.
---
This is what it feels like playing chess with a pigeon.  The no changes crowd are mostly private server players who overwhelmingly wanted an early version of AV.  Don't do that shit where nothing is ever Blizzards problem.  I can show you multiple posts over the last two years of people begging Blizzard to put in 1.5 or 1.8 AV.  The problem is all the low information people who just blindly blame no changes because they don't understand what they are talking about.
---
Always thought that thread was funny.
---
Pss: Why did Blizzard let this server die?
---
Also Pss: https://i.redd.it/59wag55g0w241.jpg
---
Don't worry. As alliance I only ever find horde premade in wsg. My sample size is still small though.  I've only queued wsg 3 times but so far, all ended with graveyard camps
---
Should have titled it "From rags to... Rag's"
---
I think, since we have short queues, that most of the mentally fit and committed Alliance are now doing premade discords and leaving a high density of riff raff in PUGs. When I pop into a PUG I see it.
---
When our premade is large many people just AFK to take advantage of us. When it is small we only get a bit of help (which is always appreciated and sometimes vital) and usually have one to four people mocking us if we don't win it for them in 10 minutes. There may be something there regarding factions but I think it's just that the player pool across both factions is 20% human excrement.
---
with pure +healing you do more HPS. and if i also never go out of mana but i have to spend a few gold on mana pots then is it not worth? im doing more raw healing and we both arent going out of mana. i'd trade gold on consumes to perform better in raids any day.
---
LOL, that would be nice too.
---
"Live service" is a term meaning a piece of software that is centrally hosted and generally has a subscription. It's not referring to server uptime or anything.
---
dont worry, warlocks have huge power creep in vanilla. Right now you're going to be pretty squishy but just wait... Warlocks are gods in PvP in later tiers
---
Now Alliance are beginning to move to that side of "Win or lose, just end it quick"
---
Since horde keep turteling and killing the 60% andy's they usually stop and turtle instead of pushing to gavl and drek. 
---
Either rush could still work for alliance, but it only takes 1 idiot to pull all the war masters and fuck up the alliance push.
---
That and I have noticed a severe drop in quality tanks on alliance.
---
You can lose AV.
---
Imagine actually being so simple-minded and this pathetic to think this way.
---
Premades, sure.
---
A lot of shamans use shock too much, it will oom you fast
---
100% happened lol. A good portion of the server knew about it and it was talked about for weeks.
---
dude in 100 bg's ive got 1 sheep dispel &amp; 1 hand of freedom from a pally.
---
.. thats where ur wrong.
---
it does refer to server uptime
---
&gt; When TBC comes out and season1 is WLD’s wilin out with stormheralds I hope you remember this post
---
Still better than anything classic has to offer with PvP.
---
There's just no contradiction here. It's perfectly possible to parse high if your gear in general is very good, even if you don't min/max on every slot. It's just that, if you put on some spell dmg greens where they are bis, you would parse a percent or two better still.
---
Yeah I think the first rank of MC only works up to lvl 45 or so.  Eventually I’ll test this using a level 20 alt so that my guild can reset for ourselves, but that’ll be a while.
---
This isnt argument valley!
---
The slam macro where you can spam slam and it will only go off after your attack doesn’t work in classic
---
I know at least mouseover Blind does work, I use it all the time.
---
Acuria Ring is good for non-human, 2hand fury warriors using BRE.  But with OEB or DW yeah you shouldn't roll on it.
---
It returns you to where you queue'd from
---
It's mostly that the dumb people are the loudest. It doesn't take THAT many idiots to jack up pulls, split the raid, blame everyone, and cause a general breakdown in communication. 
---
Alliance overall are not dumb. We got plenty of folks who run successful raids, and execute strategies more complex than "RUSH DREK" but mostly those folks have other things to do than deal with idiots in AV.
---
When Hunters do DM solo tribute runs, which bosses if any are they able to or actually kill?
---
Educate yourself!

Other than the last boss, strat is not harder than DMN.  The trash packs at the start of DMN hit *hard*.  Use CC on them.  You don't want your tank getting hit by 3-4 of the ogres at once if you can avoid it.
---
The eye of kilrogg, needs to be killed immediately when you see one.  It dies in like one hit, but it doesn't matter *what* you're doing...drinking, mid pull, whatever...it has to die immediately.
---
The other thing that gets many groups is on the warlock packs kill the warlock pets first.
---
Any class in the game can mine, herb and fish. It won't be mage aoe farming gold but it will be enough for epic mount, enchants and consumables.
---
If you didn't know the honor system was bad back in July then you should keep your opinions to yourself because you don't know what you are talking about.
---
Definitely get more intellect gear. Ele ends up being a lot better on Mana than enh while leveling once you have some int gear.
---
Basically, your rotation is just spamming lighting bolt. Don't bother with shocks except to kite or interrupt (and use rank 1 shocks for that), don't bother with totems except in groups or trying to solo an elite.
---
When I was leveling as ele post-45, I'd do chain lightning when elemental mastery was up (because it did better damage than LB and elemental mastery got rid of the mana cost) and when clearcasting procced, but other than that, 99% of the time, it's just spamming LB.
---
People really dont remember all the R13/14s who afk'd or botted their way to the rank, huh?

I heard you can pull him using a priest with BOED and mind vision.

My vision of classic +.
---
All current dungeons scaled up to 60.
---
Add some dungeons the world as it is still has large areas unexplored (naturally). Plenty of opportunitys for new dungeons. They have all the assests they need to build these.
---
Perhaps new gear or spread some raid gear like bracers and belts around the scaled dungeons.
---
One thing i notice on my 60s I have no reason to play after getting pre-raid bis and epic mount, which if im honest only took me a week after hitting 60. No reason to farm gold at this point and thus only need to log in once a week for raid. I'm not saying I'm in the majority either but everyone hits that point. The only thing i really have left to farm is rare mount from strat.
---
I just do /rw for important moves. Yes, it can be annoying but 90% never read chat so basic instructions in your face really do help.
---
Just keep it short and only for important things like "everyone go inside galv now" (to wipe allies) or "use trinket NOW they are entering base".
---
It is Yorgen, very easy to mistake with Worgen though!
---
I had to start doing this at times.  WoW pvp has always been hit or miss as I recall, and at times in AV it's just hours and hours of getting creamed with not much to show for it.
---
Haha you didn’t have to go through all that effort just to say you prefer to stack +heal gear and use consumes to compensate for small mana pool. So your argument is you’re achieving the same result with a different color liquid. Only your liquid costs 20g to raid MC/Ony whereas my liquid is free. Idk man to each their own. Padres and exalted have just as much healing as those greens you’re using with int to boot so  dunno why you don’t just use those.
---
I think the issue is that its one thing to memorize raid strategies, its another to react to an enemy that is collectively changing starts over a course of a week.
---
It depends on what the guild is looking to get out of raiding.
---
If the raid is strictly for entertainment and performance does not really matter, DKP can be fine.
---
If the raid is about trying to be the best guild on the server/region/world then loot council is best.
---
That's really all it boils down to.

reroll
---
Any idea what your avg que time was? As horde i'm curious.
---
It's obviously not griefing if the guy is afking at the tunnel anyway.
---
Im here for ZG and AQ
---
It dies?
---
I assume you’re referring to retail?
---
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but saying a game dies simply because they added features and content you didn’t like doesn’t mean it died, quite the contrast, despite 15 years of age, dozens of competitors, and an increasingly frustrating market base, WoW retail continues to stay alive and healthy with more than enough subscribers to continue support and active development, and with minimum levels of monetization compared to the rest of the market. 
---
Retail is anything but dead. And classic only exist thanks to retail and the money it brought in to fund the development for classic. Don’t forget, this was an entire rebuild from vanilla.
---
God that date format makes me want to rip my eyes out
---
Opposite actually. Hardcore honor farmers left for WSG leaving rep grinders. Horde also figured out turn ins give horde rep so people mass farm horde rep and do a shitton of turn ins.
---
Nice facebook post
---
All the good ones are using premades. Just got slam-dunked 3 times in a row by discord premades as horde.
---
Imagine farming meaningless zergs for honor per hour for a title that shows how skilled you are at “pvp”
---
I honestly don't know why anyone pvps in the Field of Strife. It's inefficient for accomplishing pretty much any goals. Unless the game has somehow gotten to summoning your boss dude, there's very little reason to pvp there instead of fighting nearer objectives and graveyards.
---
This.
---
Good lord.  This is the guy that thinks he's hilarious and is the only one laughing at his own jokes.
---
Nice I thought it was all pre aq farming stuff. Today I learned
---
AV was always that way though.  You weren't given rewards by participation.  You get them from rep, which is just how many turn-ins people in the raid do for you.
---
Most ppl I know are only there for exalted. Just dont gaf about the rank/honor.
---
Ya but the difference is you aren't competing to get the same honor as someone who AFKs 24/7 because you'll get there eventually.    I don't care so much that 1-2 people are afk. Just that they are able to do  that to such an extent that it makes ranking to even mid ranks so much more of a time investment than it's worth
---
Yeah but you can't touch people putting in 24 hrs a day afk farming av with 8-16 hrs of actual engaged wsg play time. You can't afk through wsg to continue gaining real honor; you can with av.
---
Onyxia is a region wide reset on a 5 day schedule.

Same, I hit revered from farming and have never seen another totem drop.
---
Please elaborate on that and add value to your comment.
---
Why do you think 8 hours a day is needed to play 1 of the 9 classes?
---
I make a lot more money than $200 in 240 hours of work so based on opportunity cost it's actually fucking dirt cheap.
---
Post this at prime time and you’ll see a difference
---
You bring dishonor to the horde sir. Face them in the light of day not in a corner.
---
Horde racial are only better in a vacuum where no-one uses any sort of items or consumables. Once you start using consumables then alliance racial crap all over the horde counter-parts for the various classes
---
+ Orc stun resist vs free action potion
---
+ WotF vs glimmering mithril insignia

---
Vanilla/Classic PvP fights simply don't drag out all that long due to the available health pools, burst damage potential and in a numbers game getting the alpha-strike (and potentially insta-gibbing someone right off the bat) helps a lot to sway the tide of war.
---
I will say it seems like a LOT of paladins don’t even know what their toolkit is capable of :( 
---
I’ve had paladins tell me they didn’t know they could dispel sheep until I whisper them. 
---
Also depending on your class you’ll probably get more or less love. I almost always focus a warrior for freedom and a mage for bop, with exceptions obviously depending on the situation. 
---
Paladins still make Alliance best imo
---
What is BOED? Tried Google but nothing I found was helpful.
---
If you are going to use the sw:pain + wand strategy, shadow is marginally better since sw:pain is so much of your damage in that specific situation and you take 15% less damage from most mobs in shadowform. It's also easier to fight mobs above your level because of the hit rating available in shadow talents. I would still advise anyone who has no intention of ever healing an instance to level as shadow, even without considering PvP.
---
I just think that if someone's might like to heal instances, even if they spend most of their time solo, a smite/spirit tap spec is a more versatile option without much in the way of downsides.
---
As much as I like playing Classic, I think Classic is more important as a learning experience for Blizzard and other devs to understand what it is we want in a MMO. I would like either Classic+ with an alternate expansion progression or a new game entirely with the design concepts and spirit of Vanilla.
---
Monetization doesn't really worry me anymore than Shadowlands. I won't partake and if it hurts the game I'll leave like I did in Cata. Blizz can learn from it or not.
---
&gt;Imagine farming meaningless zergs for honor per hour for a title that shows how skilled you are at “pvp”
---
for the best gear in the game*
---
Farming snowballs they're 9 copper for like 5 from the vendor. Just buy a bunch and stock an alt.
---
I'm actually really thankful for the guild I found.  Honestly, one of the best I've been in for over 20 years.  It's not that I get along with everyone or friends.  It'a that everyone of gets there's a basic standard for everyone to get along.  The leaders are also very organized and have a solid recruitment chain system set up that will be very important in classic.
---
arguable
---
Ehh, that got fixed months ago.
---
There's a guild on my server that do premade AV games and end them within 6-7 minutes. Really sucks to wait 30 minutes for that but it's pretty much impossible to stop with a group of random players against atleast 30+ in discord.
---
I've reserved Wednesdays as my dungeon night, and my problem was two Wednesdays in a row I couldn't find ANYONE ELSE who wanted to run gnomeragon.  Its the only dungeon I've skipped so far.
---
Hunters only kill Gordok, leaving all the rest alive.
---
lol nvm u dont get it
---
I said it was the best "all around" guide. Not the fastest, so it will bring you around to all of the others while having an alright leveling speed
---
I still see lots of raifs with streamers wiping on oxyxia or domo/rag.
---
Our standing#1 Hunter had 1.6m honor last week and my 1.2 million was good for....19th. Woof. Hopefully our premade has been giving you vast amounts of trouble!
---
What does it mean when you see a mining node greyed out on the mini-map?
---
Trying to level up mining and whenever I have "Find Minerals" turned on, sometimes the nodes are greyed out and I can't find any in that area.
---
Also all the super hyper poop sock players will finish their grinds.  Most servers right now have a couple of people that are grinding double or triple what everyone else is and fucking up the brackets.
---
Good point, but do you thing Zerg farming deserves a reward like that, given enough time literally anybody could do that.
---
yep and command + shift + 3 on mac is the whole screen
---
If they thought they could add monetization, they would do so in a heartbeat. Regardless of whether or not classic+ was a reality.
---
Projecting?
---
My guild fell apart when a boomkin won a Staff of Domination. A warlock got pissed, left the guild and took half of the raid team with him. The guild is now officially dead. Good times.
---
we are achieving the same result in our blue glass. but because you're filling your blue glass with the purple liquid then you cant fill up your green glass like i can. both our blue glasses are full but only my green glass is also full. yours just has a little in it.
---
padres is a great item and i considered using it, but seeing as i never had a situation where i needed the extra mana after my mana pot i decided not to use it. i use it for dm east jump runs sometimes though.
---
also i said helm not chest, ofc i use robes of the exalted its super op :D
---
It was awesome.  It was raiding for PVPers.  It was a world PVP zone wrapped up in an instance.  There were loads of quests, there were things you could do that helped even if you weren't PVPing.  It was a war, and you were doing whatever part of it you could.  There was no expectation that you would even see it end.  You joined and helped for as long as you could, in whatever way you could, and left when you needed to.
---
There were LOADS more NPCs, and you didn't just blaze across it.  The reason Field of Strife has that name is because you'd fight there for *hours* without making any real progress.  You'd rally NPC riders and stuff to help you.  Taking out a huge pack of NPCs while their whole raid fought against that was really really fun.
---
It was fantastic.
---
Oh, I actually tried this.  It's impossible to fail.  Was a terribly boring system.
---
I might be thinking of a different server. They're all horde dominated so they sort of blend together.
---
well, AV is excruciating for alliance, so it's not really a boycot, but more 'why play AV when I can bang my head against the wall and have more fun?'
---
How’s shadow priest down time for questing or farming mobs?
---
&gt; I know Horde want to think they are all of suddenly way better now, but that is not the case.
---
If horde had been intercepting the initial charge from day 1 you would have seen what we're seeing now.  The only time ally wins is when horde plays no defense whatsoever and treats it like a race.
---
Yes, I realize this thank you. I've also stopped a number of mages in their tracks that have attempted garbage like this just by being vigilant. Mages aren't unassailable. They aren't gods. They're the same idiots as you and me, and can be stopped the same damned way. PA attention, eliminate the threat immediately, don't just throw up your hands and say "WELL ICE BLOCK AND COLD SNAP EXIST"
---
That's some whiny zoomer nonsense. Push their shit in and make them pay the price. The strategy is the same as it was 15 years ago. Just don't be dumb.
---
Well, according to you, it's because Alliance players are dumber. Something in people with low IQ just makes them think Alliance races are cooler so they choose that faction. Apparently.
---
As a priest i love to dispell Arcane Power off an enemy :D 
---
"try again in 3minutes mate"

That's just you making things up.

Lol, some of us were playing long before that episode came out :D

How much is the going rate for DM:N tribute loot?
---
Was going to buy 2H mace and Agi Ring, both for 50G - is that a good deal?
---
P.s. i'm playing feral druid
---
I purposely picked July because it was obviously pre-launch.  Having not played vanilla wow for a very long time it was the one thing that I remembered being horribly broken in a way that was fun for nobody.
---
ou're ruining this community
---
Behead the mage bourgeoisie.
---
Seize the means of consumption.
---
Or left
---
Our guild has 50+ level 60s, been together since release. I'm proud to say we are relatively drama free. Many guilds are hemorrhaging members or breaking up left and right around us, but we're still going strong. We've been able to field 40 members every raid night for over a month now, clearing everything in one night. Other than a member or two being a loot whore or having a piss poor personality that we've had to kick or let them leave, we've been doing well.
---
How?
---
It all depends on what Blizzard has learned.
---
I hope they have recognized which decisions lead to the current state of retail and understand what can or cannot be avoided. If they have I want Classic+ and eventually WoW2. If they haven't figured it out then just give us the expansions again.
---
At least in that case it's their BIS for main spec and they've probably been salivating at the thought.
---
The longest queue was literally under 10 seconds.
---
Not when they are trying to get their mage to 1 shot a druid they dont.
---
Id be fine with either BC or classic+, BC was a solid expnasion because it felt like classic with minor improvements.
---
Ideally if we get BC and its a choice if you want to go to the expansion or stay classic forever.
---
Competent PvP players went Alliance for the challenge.
---
I can't raid heal as shadow. Especially when I'm counted on as a MT healer
---
This works on Alliance too.  As a shaman on my own near the zerg I often send a shock or chain lightning at an outermost member of the zerg after they've dismounted somewhere, put an earthbind totem down, and kite away from the objective.  I'm lucky to kill one person, but every time I get a bunch of people to take a minute to deal with me when they could have been doing something more productive.
---
Ok zoomer
---
Which were handled by RMP, which were handled by RLD, etc...
---
Arena wasn't perfect due to the nature of rock paper scissor classes and blizzards refusal to balance pve/pvp separately, but it was a hell of a lot better then what we have now and actually rewarded skill.
---
I enjoy hitting them with the snowballs now. Gotten a couple hate messages if they’re sitting at their PC. 
---
It’s a 30 second cooldown though on the snowballs, and takes at least 5-6 to knock them out of the instance.
---
I was out of town for a few days when it came out, so I missed it :(
---
It takes 5 min + for 1 player to boot one AFKer. I don't think your math adds up.
---
DKP does not spread well.. Think about hunters and healing druids, they will barely use any dkp on their own tierset pieces and spend it all on the items warriors and rogues also want
---
&gt;(I don't feel they switched for racial traits, they wanted a change.)
---
what a fantasy world you horde people live in
---
Imagine being that entitled to charge for water. I have instant queues on Alliance and I still spent 1-2min inbetween queues to make water and pass them out to healers in the next BG.
---
Now that the streamer with the most annoying voice has said this, I'm going to keep passing out even more free water in BGs.
---
rogue is probably the 3rd easiest class in the game to level after mage and druid.
---
anyone who says otherwise is a certified bad rogue
---
relevent
---
My original server had a clique who's sole purpose was to keep another guy from getting GM after they already all had it, it took this guy months of extra grinding and waiting out the group to finally get it because of them. The PVP Honor system is the absolute worse thing Blizzard has ever created, and they created Warlords of Draenor, the Azerite system, and the "almost hard cap of four" on Legion legendaries. It is truly awful.
---
An annoying guy uses hyperbole to try and create drama and generate clicks/revenue.
---
The worst thing you can do is defend balinda effectively.  It almost always results in a turtle.  Creating a minor annoyance can help stall for a few seconds though.
---
My guild has done this too. If you're having trouble with the pull, drink a Swiftness pot right as the gate opens, run a little, blink, R1 Frostbolt. Has worked well for us.
---
I looked at wowclassicbis for two minutes for feral druid and it was completely wrong for bear and cat so lol
---
He's talking about the "classic" series of WoW dies ater TBC....
---
yikes
---
Definitely not true. There is a name for this phenomenon but I don't recall. Selection bias or something like that.
---
WOTLK is a result of people crying about TBC being too hard. WOTLK is far too east, it was the beginning of the free handout in WoW.
---
i wanna piggyback off this thread because i’m lvling an alt right now and want to be able to have the conversation with guild leadership when the time comes: how do you all feel about “switching” mains? 
---
i have a hunter that is 5/8 t1 and 2/8 t2 with rhok, so i have soaked a bit of gear from the guild but i’m not really enjoying the hunter and don’t care to raid or play him much outside farming gold, when my shaman alt hits 60 i want to start raiding and pvping mostly on that toon. would it be fair to start bringing the shaman to raid once he is mostly pre-bis and ask for gear prio provided i stop raiding on my hunter? i know it’s kind of bad timing as BWL is coming out and we need our geared dps so i feel bad for taking gear on hunter and essentially quitting the raid on him but i also would just rather have a new main so to speak.
---
You've been living under a rock.  Our gear itemization is 1.12 as is the BGs we play.  Saying that AV was changed is completely misunderstanding what Classic was from inception.
---
No one wants AVs that last over a day.  Why?  Because no one gets marks, no one is able to get reputation in a relatively quick manner, and no one is able to guarantee their honor is actually recorded.  AFAIK, you get honor from objectives and a mark if you finish the game.  If we only get honor from pvp inside AV during a 20+ hour game, no one is going to play it.
---
Vanilla WoW was always about who had the most free time.  Not until daily quests were released was there any real gating of content, aside from raid lockouts.  The idea that we have broken pvp system is so utterly uninformed, it's making me sick.
---
Prior to 1.12, as in from when pvp gear was released until TBC and 2.0 came out, the people who hit R13 and R14 were the ones who spent months grinding it, period.  The whole system is about time investment.  Due to how the mechanics of honor are built, at R12 and R13, you gain rank points at a snail's pace.  You literally have to be the top honor earner for months to reach R14.
---
This means that AV being more honor per hour than WSG and as such is broken is a stupid argument.  The R14s from 1.5 and 1.8 did the same thing that R14s of the future are doing, play the most optimal BGs and use the best strats while playing all day, every day.  It literally doesn't matter if AV is broken, if WSG is the best, if AB is sex on silk sheets with Barry White playing softly.  The rewards from honor are so utterly divorced from skill that their children thought they sprang forth from their parent's forehead full formed.
---
Stop the myth that PvP purple gear and current BiS gear is any measure of skill.  Be mad at Blizzard for itemization, be mad at Blizzard for shitty honor systems, be mad for the wrong version of AV.  Don't try to cross the streams and blame the players for poor behavior due to itemization and optimal play in AV.  That dog won't hunt.
---
Ofc you need a good premade to get rank 14. Or you can wait until all other good guys got it
---
I disagree. I think OSRS is not a good example for wow classic to follow. OSRS was given too small a dev team and the players were given too much power and they ran away with it. It looks like a cheap private server now. If blizzard is going to deviate from the source material they need to devote significant resources too it if it wants to live up to world of warcraft standards. I dont think many people have faith that blizzard would commit that far to classic based on how it's been handled so far.
---
because WSG lets you queue up as a group, av does not.
---
The cheap healing potions
---
A HUGE part of that guy's parses is his guild consistently killing everything in 30-45 seconds. Way more so than gear. DPS is gonna be high when you have ToEP or PI up most of the fight and never have to worry about OOMing. If you have good RNG over your dozen or so Shadowbolt casts you're golden. Not taking anything away from the guy, he parses like a monster, but that's a way bigger factor than the 3 greens he's wearing that maybe net an extra 20-30 +dmg overall at most.
---
It’s not that serious, relax my guy. Lol
---
Paladins were monsters in Wotlk. Healing, tanking, dps...they could do it all and well. Ret paladins had actual damage abilities rather than just auto-attacking.
---
Classic paladins are good at aoe farming and healing, but that's about it. Most classes in Classic have boring rotations anyways.
---
Ya, but initial rush ALWAYS fails in non-premades. Source: the last 20 AV's
---
Nah man, Alliance go ham in any text based format, they were dominating forums in the few weeks of wpvp.
---
all your arguments suck and don't even hold up in consistency, seriously, try again
---
you are saying rogues are the "2nd slowest levelers" but your only point is "hurr durr hunters are faster" or "hurr durr mages are faster". 
---
At worst that makes rogues the 3rd fastest levelers. I'd argue that druids have them beat, so they sit nicely at 4th. 
---
If you're a slow rogue leveler, you just suck at rogue, sorry dude
---
With a debit card

&gt;It's a business. The point of a business is to make money.

/Cast [mod:shift] ice block; !ice block
---
I've been leading guilds like this with a RL friend since MoP. He fits into the casual, people-person, ginvite anyone without screening them first category, and I am a no-life, no nonsense, parsing focused control freak when it comes to raiding. I'm not *that* extreme but I can't stand players who show no signs of wanting to improve or be reliable.
---
no i mean for your players unit frame with the large, class colored health bar
---
Oh yea the rank 13 stuff is pretty nice. Def not going for it though lol
---
Really theres no in game defined goals imo, that's part of the classic experience. You can choose to raid and clear that content to get gear or pvp and just get gear to be better at that. Personally I'm just looking to grind out the winterspring frostsaber. It's your world man
---
You're missing the point. Him clearing an afk and getting someone who actually plays every 5 minutes in a 30min+ AV makes a difference.
---
Definitely true.
---
It’s not broken
---
I might take it slower.  I don't need to hit bracket 13 or 14 every week. It will take a lot longer though.  I hope bel isn't out til march, but I'd guess February at the latest.
---
Nanananana batman
---
That's just ironic? Is it just meta in regard to taking screen shots? Lol
---
well i know it may seem trivial but when that is on you people see you from a mile away so that was my idea behind it also was expecting to just kill as many as possible then die but seems they were too close to killing drek so they ignored me and that is also why i did not counterspell or blink or do any of the sort someone above said to do this was wam bam no protection just roll w it
---
If you look at the current cash shop on retail, most of the items are garbage looking. They have a few cool looking ones, sure. But they aren't a majority. There's far more good looking and unique mounts available in-game than the cash shop. So that argument is pretty much a load of crap.
---
Most of the replies are basing their math off of his statement of his /played time.
---
At 200 hours/lvl 60, that's 600 hours which is 5 hours and 15 minutes of play, every single day, since release day, no days off. If you take off two days of play because of other commitments, then you have to play almost 7 hours a day for the next week to catch up and be able to hit 600 hours by now.
---
36.5 hours per week of WoW, 52.5 hours a week for sleep, 40 for work, that leaves 39 hours for everything else. 7 hours a week for eating (20 minutes per meal for cooking/eating/cleaning up), 2 hours a week of commuting (assuming he only has a 15 minute commute door to door on his 4 workdays), 3 hours a week on hygiene (assuming less than half an hour a day spent showering, shaving, brushing teeth, and changing clothes), and now you're down to 27 hours for all family time, alone time with his wife, other social activities, chores, other hobbies (lol), errands, and anything else.
---
It doesn't matter how optimal you are in game, playing enough of a video game to constitute a second full time job while you have a family either means you're overlapping it with work hours or your family life is way out of balance (unless your family plays too and you consider that as family time). And that's assuming you have no friends or other hobbies, minimal errands or chores, short commutes and meals, and absolutely perfect time management with no inefficiencies.
---
Alliance: good
---
Horde: Bad
---
So you spend a lot of time doing nothing productive in the BG? You've become the very thing you tried to stop.
---
I doubted it too but the main tank is a good friend of mine in game and they made him an officer. Hes the one who told me that the GM changed his mind, so I guess I believe him.
---
I hope we do get TBC. I'll only play arena tho, but I loved it back then.
---
Oh man, look at me, im so nice and humble, lemme go ahead and tell everyone how nice and humble I am.
---
The one who played the most and quickly conceded losses would get 14.  Doing a premade was more about steamrolling pugs than beating other premades.
---
Chain-running warfronts hoping for titanforges would be one of the stupidest ways to try to gear up possible. It'd have to TF 30 ilvls just to get up to unupgraded benthic ilvl, and you can get a full set of unupgraded benthic within an hour of hitting 120.
---
Lmao then that would be meta
---
That's worth it, IMO.  I got the mace for 30g.
---
Fantastic. A cash shop will kill classic.
---
In the other comment it shows in the links but, your HPS was 262 on average and mine was 291? That's with me having I think 663 +heal and just over 20% holy spell crit, presumably you have more +heal and less crit. I also did it in 100 fewer casts.
---
Level a mage.
---
I've seen a warriors in AVs with literally every drop you can get from MC and no guild and I always can't help but think "bet this dude nuked his rep on the server".
---
Hey, it's me ur brother. Can I get a discord inv?
---
Mald cunt
---
Queue time. Win or lose - doesn't matter. Just turn over fast don't get stuck in a turtle game. Rushing with zero defence is the best way to do this.
---
I infiltrate their city while you 10v1 sir
---
For revered with AD you get +5 to one school of resist. You can pick between all schools. When you are exhalted, you get a +5 to all resists.
---
12 stacks! As a priest im happy to just get one
---
Jealous.
---
my friend, if as horde you're just spamming hamstring and not macro slamming when appropriate, you are missing out on jellow hits
---
Zyzz is always here
---
Lol at least he's getting Justice
---
Cant be compared. Stop crying.
---
It is Odin's horse in Norse mythology.
---
Hyperbole with zero basis. You're talking out of your ass, you know it. You just won't cop to it.
---
Where do I go and get this enchant?
---
You literally only need a single sample to prove a class is fast. Talking about "case studies" and "small sample size" doesn't even make sense in this context my dude. 
---
Might as well say "theres no proof humans can land on the moon, only a couple guys did it, small sample size". 
---
Fastest documented official time is Joanna's 4d20h hunter run. An additional 20 hours on rogue by a casual is pretty positive proof of how fast a rogue can be leveled. 
---
A rogue supplied with gold could likely beat Joanna's run, I don't remember if he funneled gear or not to that alt.
---
Kinda like how you fight melee classes—put DoTs up and spam roots again and again, refreshing DoTs and HoTing if you need. They can’t catch you, they can’t run, so you just DoT them down over the course of a minute; that’s the Druid way
---
the winterspring demons have about 17k health if i remember correctly and the blasted land ones have about 70k 
---
they also do more damage, are higher levelled and have an aoe attack and whatnot 
---
you probably want about 4 people for blasted lands, they are probably doable with 3 though but i'm guessing it will be hard. 2 is basically impossible
---
For a short while we had dungeon finder in vanilla. It came before the release of TBC and it was awesome.
---
I never give away free water, food or portals ever. Exception is to guildies. Everyone else has to pay. Im not gonna spend time making things for free.
---
Threat meters don't work on onyxia. Everytime she wing buffets, she reduces threat from the tank and that doesn't show up in threat meters. The fireballs in phase two also wipe threat.
---
If you are farming rep or honor this strategy doesn't pay off.
---
There's nothing "PvP" about warfronts. It's just a PvE scenario that has faction war theming and it never pretends to be PvP in any way.
---
I'd suggest the AV xbow over buying the dwarven hand cannon for any race other than dwarves. It's very close, if not better, damage than the hand cannon and its speed is more ideal for aimed/multi rotation. Hand cannon is very good though if you can get it cheap
---
10 bosses, 3 drops a piece, average 100g a drop pug raids take around 2 hours so your making 37.5g an hour. Using my raid IDs and 2 hours to make 75g a week is not even close to worth it for me.
---
Paladins were beasts in Wrath bro. It was after they stopped the silly “hybrid tax” nonsense. They could DPS/Tank/Heal with the best of them. Classic they are great but you really only excel in the healer role.
---
That’s what you think
---
Reported
---
Lol, you cant get GM there.
---
For alliance, chillwind camp and maybe lights hope chapell.. for horde.. If you're horde.. idno.. :P
---
Post me the macro then and I’ll try it out.
---
Congrats, I am at 100 clears now.. Want to start doing this too just too get some statistics of my own
---
I cant imagine the difference is large, but i bet its better than dalrends oh (bc it has less dps and no stats) and a bit worse than mirahs (better stats slightly less dps), but it depends on the proc rate, so you probably have to spreadsheet it to get a good answer.
---
I am horde, lol. I'll try to google it. Thanks
---
Fear ward
---
Alliance players had a few days when AV first released where they were winning every game in under 10 minutes with instant queues. If I had to guess as to why the Alliance isn't changing tactics, it's because they know (or think) they can recapture that success if they play right, or everyone listens to the plan. The problem is, it's up to the Horde if that kind of game will happen. I've only seen one game where drek was zerged down in 8 minutes when we had 5 on defense, and I'm pretty sure that was against an Alliance premade.
---
nothing is mechanically difficult in this game
---
its more about what you decide to do, not how fast you can fire off combos
---
i.e. unlike a moba where mechanical skill can decide whether or not your abilities hit, theres no "mechanics" required in WoW its more tactics and mind games.
---
I'm sure you do.
---
And if someone trying to call the shots is in a premade, go with the premade.
---
A premade isn't going to just roll into AV and suggest a bad strategy. The reason they're trying to lead is because they know a plan that works as long as everyone is on board.
---
I've seen more loot bullshit in 18 months of raiding with DKP than I have in almost 7 years of raiding with loot council.
---
Ah, I stopped playing prior to that.  I don’t recall the gear levels, but I thought it was normal/heroic raid level loot when I quit.
---
I love this post, lol. As a horde player it is obvious to tell by their play style that they have no idea what is going on.
---
This was my biggest problem with them opening up paid transfers.... This shit happened a lot right after transfers opened up in vanilla.
---
Not really.
---
At the end of the first paragraph he puts &lt;/cringe&gt; like escaping tags in CSS or HTML. Why?
---
Sounds like winterspring it is
---
You don't think people are playing classic because they're sick of the bullshit in retail?
---
Retail has better graphics, it's more modern, it's more streamlined. It's the "better" experience right? Rather than the rough edges of classic. Why would anyone play the "crappier" version of WoW?
---
Because all of the changes made destroy the enjoyment of the game. Gift shops, streamlining, people don't want these things.
---
Can you record any video regarding this? If this is really working its big.
---
true, and then there are still occasionally the ally players that are so bad that they throw a won av by pulling shit they shouldnt be
---
It's just not a big issue for the honor farmers though. Kill Galv/LTs/Commanders and that's \~3k rep alone. Another \~125ish for a loss from a single token.
---
Losing consistently quickly is still excellent honor. Winning is better of course, but nothing is worse than long games.
---
Premades are using discord to count down to queue together, cross realm. If enough people from the group get in to a specific game, they accept, if not enough get in they drop it and go again.
---
Reset classic, and release TBC for current realms
---
ofc it is. just blizztard that does everything to fuck it up. just fix av, and add AB already, AB full 5 cap is way better honor.
---
My first character back in the day was holy paladin. I loved it, but I got sick of the dps classes doing stupid shit like attacking the warrior with two pocket healers. 
---
I’d rather be Ret, attack some stuff and throw off heals to keep key players up.
---
15 years ago they had human GMs that spoke English and could help you with problems if you took the time to report them.  Nowadays we have copy pasted responses from people who barely speak English.
---
what holy said, spirit tap wins at downtime
---
I feel this.  I just wanna PVP with my friends.  But instead I'm a PVP zombie who never gets to hang out with his friends/guildies -_-
---
Misstype is what I always heard.  Or misstell.
---
Self sufficient as long as you don't pull too many and scale very well when geared to the maximum for their level.  Not brutal in the 19 bracket but when you can start stacking spell power, at 29 and 39, they are wrecking balls.
---
I think warlock is a clear contender because of pets, life tap, and draining. 
---
Priest... I guess but they're pretty thirsty in my experience though I haven't leveled one all the way to 60. Maybe it gets better, and also I guess you can find dungeon groups really easily so that is a factor with the dungeon grinding meta.
---
Okay so on a high level. 
---
Currently all public bots work inside the wow game itself as a normal addon, just that they use an unlocker so they can use functions usually locked like casting spells and moving.
---
The bot makers have created a map of the game world with only the passable parts so they know how they can get from point A-B using simple path finding algorithms, a so called navmesh.
---
So they just check what mobs they can see currently and issue a movement command to that position, fight the mob and repeat.
---
Yeah those guys we’re hard at first but we learned that they’re not immune to holy magic. So the mage pulls them into the larger room, I (warlock) send my void onto one of the skeles then burn down the elites with the mage while the priest smites down both skeles.  
---
The bosses are really easy. We kite them around the room with two levels where the final boss spawns and jump down/run up the stairs if they get to close. For the final boss we usually have 1-2 greater arcane resistance pots to absorb the arcane missles and kite/ burn him down the same we do with other bosses.  
---
Rattle gore is actually super easy. The mage (Pom/Pyro) pulls and DPS’ as he kites him up the stairs back to the room with the mini dragon then falls back down into the boss room through one of the holes. While he’s being kited I apply dots/Doom and tee off on him while the priest pecks at him too. Sometimes I’ll get a lucky conflag Brit and pull threat before I fall down, in which case I sac void and run to a hole for my life.
---
Ras is a cake walk. Mage Pom/pyro pulls and kites around while I tee off on him with all I got. He usually dies in less than 30 seconds.  
---
Each run takes about an hour and a half but we get so much rep items, loot, cloth, and gold it’s more than worth it.
---
I enjoy druid heals in BG. A lot of people shit on it, I use b rez in AV and make sure tanks stay up, decurse and abolish poison. I do everything I can to keep everyone alive
---
Not a bug, won't be fixed.
---
oh look another paladin complaining cause his bitch ass class doesnt have even more bullshit, cause gotta remember paladins have to be the rock, the scissors, and the paper, for this game to be balanced.
---
AV just has too many people, too big of a map, and too many potential objectives for the meta amongst PUGs to ever be anything beyond “we’re all going to yell at each other.” 
---
Even if there were one SUREFIRE strategy that if all 40 people did it together it would guarantee a win, you’d still get trolls, AFKs, and people who just didn’t feel like doing that. 
---
Not to mention the lack of personal accountability with 40 people. Like in League of Legends or other MOBAs if one person does something actively against the interests of their team, it’s very easy for the other players, even enemy teams, to identify that. In AV you could be running around with your team the whole time literally never doing anything to help and MAYBE one or two people would say one thing in chat to you
---
I do not know whats going on, but today - just got my exalted - i won my last 6 AV in a row. 
---
Each time i was completely surprised how unorganized the ally raid was, we pick off like 2-5 people in the middle and nobody stops to help them, even if its like only 2-3 horde attacking them
---
We wipe them at Galv and then they just stop playing, and usually we win in like 20-25 minutes as slowly moving upward without losing a single tower 
---
Felt really weird, not that i complain, but i was shocked today morning how easy it went the last 6-7k rep farm
---
You did over 400 casts and I did over 300 I'm not sure exactly how you're not seeing this... I feel like one of us is missing something here maybe.
---
[Here](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/gjF9pMt6T8rYfJRH#type=healing&amp;boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2&amp;source=14&amp;pins=0%24Separate%24%23244F4B%24casts%240%240.0.0.Any%244496196.0.0.Paladin%24true%240.0.0.Any%24false%2419943) it says you cast Flash of Light 439 times to do 217k worth of healing. Your highest crit was for 1288. On average your Flash healed for 498. You did 262 HPS with Flash of Light. You had 32% overhealing with Flash of Light (and overall) and you had just under 15% crits. Your total HPS was 267, total healing 220k.
---
[Here](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/9ALwNJ4v6bhHgzK2#boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2&amp;type=healing&amp;source=4) it says I cast Flash of Light 348 times to do 215k worth of healing. My highest crit was 1240, or 48 less than your highest crit. On average my Flash healed for 622, or 124 more than your average FoL. I did 291 HPS with Flash of Light casts, or 29 more HPS than you did. I had 31% overhealing on FoL (and overall) and had just under 30% crits. My total HPS was 322 or 55 more than yours and my total healing was 238k or 18k more than yours.
---
So is there something I'm missing? Otherwise it looks like crit being given some weight (but not too much) in your prioritization and not using rank 1 FoL, as I've done, gives more healing, and in fewer casts for higher HPS, and costs less mana. 
---
On the flipside, your highest crit was for 48 more health so there's that. Maybe if I had 100 more casts to try it.
---
It's doable, just bring food/water for sure. I solo farm as a mage.
---
I have a Mature Black Dragon Sinew sitting in my bags and I'm going to see if I can get the next Ancient Petrified Leaf.
---
I'm a Priest.
---
My dude, the term hotfix isn't some industry enforced standard. It can mean whatever you want it to mean. Most the time I've seen it used is as something that is implemented outside the normal list of priorities. Meaning they pulled a dev off their normal work load to fix this immediately.
---
Yea getting the chest is rough. I got super lucky with mine. A friend was helping me though UBRS when I was level 55, and I was the only Hunter In the group, so when it dropped I was the only one needing.
---
Finally completed mine last night with the boots in Strat Undead. Keep at it you'll get it.
---
My goal is to try to collect as many tier sets as I can.Might be unrealistic to get 8/8 for tier 2 and 3, but am currently 8/8 tier 0 and 6/8 tier 1.
---
I have robes, no mageblade no belt. You can also see my gear on the logs!
---
Overpower always has a place in the rotation, you just need to check a lot of boxes before using it (rage under 25, a little wasted is ok / bt on cd / ww on cd). Particularly if you spec 2/2 imp OP, it is more instant damage than WW for 1/5th the rage and reliably procs flurry.
---
If you're keeping yourself around 55 rage when bt/ww are syncing up, you get piles of opportunities to slip an OP in.
---
As a priest you need to get used to frontloading spells, buying up to date wands and using spirit tap to its fullest then you become a nonstop grinding machine.
---
At level 40 all of that goes into overdrive with shadowform
---
scrot
---
I can tell you how that would look in Retail:
---
Not sure. Not what i see on my end. Just &lt;cringe&gt;
---
He's mad he can't play one of the most broken specs in wow history during classic.  I leveled a ret pally alt (with crappy gear) in WotLK and you instagib every quest mob.
---
Saves you about 100 hours too
---
go to retail
---
"DPS LFG for RFD" = you will never finding a group
---
"LFM for RFD" = a lot higher chance someone will whisper you
---
After someone joins, you can just update it accordingly, such as "LF 2 dps + tank for RFD" 
---
But yeah, RFD is still far less popular than SM Armory/Cath so it will always take some time.
---
Then how do you have 20 crit...
---
You can solo farm Lord Incendius for +21 Shadow bracers that are better than those greens. Also +21 bracers go for like 150g on my server, 200g tops. You can easily find +20 for like 50g.
---
They could never detect that.
---
AV isn't really a numbers game. A coordinated group of 10 can kill the general and his guards.
---
20v40 is winnable assuming the 20 are coordinated and the 40 are not.
---
Having more numbers increases your odds ofc of having coordinated players, but bringing in people 1 by 1 after the game has started is unlikely to contribute meaningfully to a victory.
---
&gt; I don't believe there's anything he drops that doesn't also end up in the tribute chest
---
There are a few items that can only be found by killing Cho'Rush, such as https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18490/insightful-hood
---
Bahaha nice, wasn’t there 5 guys though?
---
My guilds done a couple full UBRS runs with 6-7 people at this point 1 healer, 1 tank, 1 DPS warrior who can put on a shield +DPS. For a pug you want at least 2 healers and you will need to sheep adds for a weaker group on last pulls. But it's not a big concern.
---
Wait, I'm literally doing pvp (av as a 60% mount is mainly pvp) to get raid loot (don julio's ring). Most ally pve player I know do the same. We're not losing our minds, we welcome the change.
---
Got a link for a  NA one?
---
can we just do this over discord at this point. im tired of typing. by the end of this ill have convinced you im sure of it.
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Rank 14 demands that kind of hours, atleast us Horde can rest during our 18 hour days while the Alliance will die from dehydration
---
Oh I slam. TUF is worse than oeb for slam for non humans too.
---
And you get to press ONE WHOLE BUTTON most of the time! I quit mage at 12, again, havent been able to really level one in the 15 years I've been playing.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/9ALwNJ4v6bhHgzK2#boss=-2&amp;difficulty=0&amp;wipes=2&amp;type=summary&amp;source=4
---
And a paladin
---
No it’s literally just more fun, how you gonna try and tell me runnin across the map and ignoring every objective on the way is more fun lmao
---
Channel numbers are not static. Depends on the order that you join them.
---
So lucky... AC 30g and blue sapphire is like 9-10g on smolderweb :(
---
Not sure how that math works. You got like 4 more crit than me.
---
who cares?
---
You're beyond delusional.
---
My brainless casual guild was clearing everything in less than 9 hours up to cthun.
---
No world buffs, no consumables.
---
What is 'reliably'?
---
mistell
---
DW is always better https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
yesterday I was literally in combat with someone in the base, and a pally comes up and opens trade without saying anything.
---
&gt;Also make sure you get the crossbow from AV
---
Recommend getting a lvl 60 weapon (AV, DMW, or UD Strat crossbows) before doing tributes or it'll take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to kill the king. I know from experience :(
---
Hahah thank you very much for explaining that to me. The reference was lost on me
---
&gt; How do I have zero proof and or the burden? 
---
You have not shown or given us any reference of what you claimed, You claimed that this would not work, show us that it will not work.... &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt; I am making the claim it will work the same as it did in vanilla, that is my proof and all I should need 
---
That is not proof moron you it is anecdotal... &gt;.&gt; 
---
&gt; The reason they changed the loot was to make their life easier with complaints. They won't be changing how zg enchants work that's just stupid bold claims YOU are making with NO evidence 
---
I never made a claim they would in anyway.... I said 
---
  "we have no idea how blizzard will choose to make these two mechanics interact" Or are you so daft you couldn't read 1 line...
---
&gt;Argent Dawn enchants can't be done in the not to be traded window just like in vanilla same as the zg enchants. Arcanums could always be done in the not to be traded window and still can both arcanums and argent Dawn shoulder enchants work like expected from vanilla. Where is your proof they will change it? You have the burden here not me. 
---
Either you have no idea what I was arguing, or you don't understand the word proof... 
---
I have made nooooooo claims or would you like to quote them, I bet you will not again cus you don't need any proof you just spout BS to the wind your teeth. You obviously have a very incredibly hard time understanding what you read and it show with how you misinterpreted clear and concise wording.
---
Some people formed guilds in advance with people they knew from retail or other games.  I think expecting to raid with that type of guild from launch makes sense.
---
But joining the random invite everybody social guilds who plan to be hardcore but also casual with 500 members and a loot council made up of no one you know at all... Weren't going to work obviously.
---
When a fresh vanilla server launche dback in the day I joined with a preplanned guild and we were the dominant guild through Naxx
---
queues are still instant for Alliance, if it seems like a clusterfuck in the first couple minutes it'll probably continue that way.
---
I mean you can get lucky but if you don't you have to either not group or queue and wait again.  On alliance u just requeue and get insta procs so it's easy to requeue a few times to get the most number of people in.
---
Maybe he's in for the rep and doesn't care the least about honor ? Sure does seem like a stupid waste though.
---
I'll just ask this question somewhere else and somebody is bound to answer it. You've accomplished nothing by removing my post Lol congratulations
---
Yeah, you're right. I didn't have to be so sarcastic with my response. I will try to be better moving forward. Thank you.
---
Run discoed as admin
---
Did it with a warrior, priest and mage combo. Wasn’t easy, so I can imagine duo would be quite hard.
---
Also, i guess if its reports based then it isn't worth it. I do wish there was a confirmed higher drop rate mob, there are some that have really low reported drop rates. Apparently you can even get it from chests as long as your in 36-38 or higher zones like SM
---
Pick something you wanna level. I think that any class can be somewhat easy to level with a bank behind you.
---
Personally I levelled a Druid since it has so many aspects that hunter doesn’t have. I can tank, heal, stealth all in one
---
This happened to us this week, has this always happened or have i just never noticed it?
---
If it's the latter than GOD DAMN this game is amazing. 15 years on and i still learn new stuff.
---
How are horde premades even possible? Maybe 5 people make it if 40 que together? That's a pretty big maybe.
---
I'd marinate a chicken in that.
---
Wow nice I can never get my phone out in time to take a screenshot of the loading screen
---
Mage for sure, 1 button rotation, every group wants one, self sufficient with food and water and portals, insanely easy to make gold on, get paid just standing in cities, scales nicely with gear
---
Mage
---
Mage!
---
Well in that case it just comes with the territory with being in the most hardcore guild on your server.  Of course the server's most elite guild is full of elitist thats how it works. Super casual guilds are downing rag at this point, you could be the big fish in the small pond if you're unhappy with your arrangement.
---
this made me laugh harder than it should have lol
---
I feel this.
---
If there's a cultural shift towards kicking AFK players (either this way or through mass reporting) people will be less likely to AFK in BG's.
---
If they can't get away with it they're not going to waste their time trying.
---
how is oeb better than tuf for humans, i'm not seeing it
---
This is probably the best post in the history of r/classicwow
---
he didn't even use blink to close distance lol
---
just shows how op mage is
---
I don’t think your guild will be going anywhere, but good luck.
---
I appealed multiple times through their services and they lifted it
---
LoL gotta love it when it says 100% exp but you haven't leveled
---
Getting to 60 as a warrior is long and then farming pre-BiS can take even longer depending on your luck.
---
Most of the really good dps warrior pieces are highly contested with other classes and on top of that, drop rates are low. On top of that, a lot of the best pieces are BOEs and expensive requiring extensive gold farming;
---
Drops: Dal’Rends, Painweaver, Mara Ring from Princess, Truestrikes, SGC, Hand of Justice, Cape of the Black Baron, Eye of Rend if no LH, are all annoying/long farms.
---
Expensive BOEs: Devilsaur Set, Lionheart, Battlechaser Greaves, this on my server is around 1350-1500g
---
Then you got your enchants which are a few hundred gold.
---
Can you main a dps 15hr a week? Sure. But you will be a lower tier warrior at best unless you farm your prebis.
---
You don't know the pain of being a warlock. I've got no keybinds left.
---
I was in a game with you the other day then.  Was hilarious.
---
90 dps and using earth shock means you're not only being carried but potentially stealing aggro from the tank.  This isn't really a neckbeard thing as much as a "please play somewhat competently" thing.
---
&gt; alliance has instant ques while horde do not, so horde have an incentive to improve and get the most out of their games while alliance would rather just move onto the next game as soon as any form of resistance shows up. 
---
I think this is the real reason, Alliance would rather risk a rush win and loose than play defense -&gt;offense and win a 20 min game, after all if you don't win the rush it's faster to let the horde win and go on to another instant que game.
---
So this whole thing boils down to you not knowing how things worked in vanilla and getting mad about it. This is well documented I'm not making shit up there's a reason twinks didn't get the zg enchants because they fucking couldn't. You can look this shit up it's a known thing dude. You are claiming they will make a change I am saying that's extremely unlikely and wouldn't make any sense. Technically yes they could just say fuck it and make it doable in the not to be traded window but why in hell would they when that is NEVER how it worked in vanilla?
---
That's not why people farm honor lol.
---
a disarmed ret pally could 2 global a warrior with 400 resilience i remember that time good.
---
Which addon do you use? I'll try that one
---
It's almost as If I had a route that took that into account.
---
I want to agree, but aren't you going too far ? I'm sure some dudes stream because they play a lot, have the rig/internet speed to stream, and figured maybe a few people would be interested to watch them play.
---
I don't want to start claiming that all (or even most) streamers are egocentric teenagers like OP's guildmate. I always go by "innocent until proven guilty".
---
Props to Cold. Happy to see a champion from our backwater server on the front page of r/classicwow
---
There are tons of horde bots with Chinese characters in their names farming the trolls on the beach in STV on Grob. I usually /wave nearby alliance down and /point at them and they usually get what I'm trying to say and farm some free honor.
---
This was AV from 1.12
---
It's a shame they didn't put in the old AV - would have been a lot better.  But this is technically 1.12's av.
---
My mage is going fire, so I hope it will be more interesting.
---
Better to take the time to snowball them off a cliff or into the enemy.
---
95% to rank 6 before AV week.
---
95% to rank 7 after AV week 1.  I know this feeling.
---
Rank 6 kinda worthless though.  7 is when you start getting actual good rewards.  Rank7 2pc is so good for casters
---
Bc alliance are brain dead sheep and horde have the strong sense of brotherhood and teamwork.
---
Legend has it he doesnt even have the reed.
---
They're shit pots though.
---
Classic puggers are not similar to pserver players at all.
---
Not when I know exactly what I need to get the next level.
---
I just watched Esfands stream and qued 4-5 seconds before he and his guild did. I got into games with them probably 80% of the time.
---
/me writes posts asking what was really different between two versions of the same class
---
/me indicates in that post that they never played any version of the game past Wrath
---
/me gets told to go to Retail
---
You guys are so polite :)
---
Oh yeah I wasn't even thinking about pvp.  Didn't they have some macro that would do so much damage it would crash your game?
---
You over estimate pugs in wsg.  You basically needed a fc druid, voice chat and some lvl 60 blues to dunk on every random pug with a premade.  
---
*druid and blues optional.
---
Well, he left immediately after the announcement. I *imagine* that they agreed he'd leave the guild voluntarily after saying a quick goodbye.
---
The system existed to properly boot people, but Blizzard hotfixed it since some premades were abusing it.
---
My servers bracket two us wavering between 900k top and 700k low...
---
There's the one where a horde guild got an eye of sulfuras and bought ingots from the alliance in order to craft hand of rag.
---
They invited everyone on the server to watch as one of their warriors crafted it in Org.  
---
Right after doing so the warrior gquits in front of everyone to join a different guild.
---
Drama indeed.
---
Imagine not planning where you need to go at what level
---
Lol you have no idea even man. If you were to see what was happening youd know. The guy wasn't busy. Surely i don't know it all but I could see his /says chat, what he was talking about and all. He was also in a guild know for being extremely childish and such. I wasn't following him around. It was in one very tight area and I wasn't stuck to em. And the guild dynamic is so much more complicated than how I stated but it boils down to irl friends taking priority and that's that. Nothing to do with ur skill or contribution
---
10 days = 1.4(ish) week**s**.
---
Minutiae aside, my point still stands. It took horde a day or two to counter the 'go right' strategy, and another day or so to blow up the 'go left' strategy as well.
---
Just to provide an alternative: Engineering/Alchemy is a great combo, because you can make all the potions you need to run tributes.
---
I know what it was. I asked why? After a few days you would not want this. No one wants this, this is pure nostalgia. I played vanilla, and I remember what old av was, and I'm not wearing rose colored glasses.
---
getting sold on the idea, but how much is there on a mage outside of raiding prep i must do? AV exalted etc etc?
---
Locks have been getting geared super quickly in our guild as well. Not much competition honestly.
---
You can have a rank 9 and 10 moonfire on something at same time? Is this a thing with other dots as well?
---
Amazon or eBay link for the book? The game can be bought directly from the WoW website if that's the link they are looking for.
---
I looked at this and honestly don’t have a clue what I’m looking at I can’t tell what’s below those graphic card ect
---
I got to rev within the first 3, but exalted took much longer as the queues turned from 2-3 min to 11+
---
If your looking to save money your best bet is to buy a laptop that is a couple years old but was amazing when it came out. Should be great for wow classic. Welcome to the rest of your life lol
---
I know the alliance A team thinks they are somehow skilled, but what they did early isn't even pvp, it's exploiting a poorly balanced PvE encounter. 
---
Test: how many npc do you really encounter running to drek's doorstep and the relief hut? How many to you have to deal with or keep an eye on standing right outside in the FW courtyard. 
---
Test: how many horde premades have you seen face off against an alliance A team premade?
---
Getting across that SP bridge and anywhere near vann and the aid station is pretty much impossible without aggroing tons of npc. On my own adventure to exalted, I watched alliance literally walk into the FW courtyard with nothing to stop then at all. Horde changed tactics because they know they can't win because the map is unbalanced to their disadvantage. We still often lose facing a premade because we simply can't overcome the lacking design of defense in our keep AND get a pug to out coordinate a premade in battleground chat.
---
The only successful alliance tactics I've witnessed are both tied to advantages given to them by the system design: map/npc layout and instaqueue premade rigging against a pug. But go ahead and pound your chest when you win a little more than half of the time in a rigged game.
---
No a link to a pc or laptop that would run it
---
"Am I a joke to you?" 
---
-Xp bar
---
So you, as someone who isn’t playing Horde, know the mindset of Horde players better than those players themselves. Huh.
---
\- At least an extremely basic serverside anti-bot module that would take 5 hours at max to code with at least one blizzard employee reviewing bot reports
---
Nah
---
\- $25 realm transfer to move mere megabytes around the server database, letting rich players move around realms and avoid reputation for doing bad things instead of a better "one allowed transfer per year per character" system.
---
Hell yeah
---
I see a lot of people saying that it has been fixed. I didn’t realise blizzard addressed the changed version of reckoning to be bugged so my mistake.
---
Think that’s what I will do
---
I'm talking about this av version
---
I encountered plenty of solid pvpers on both factions. Doesn't seem to be a huge difference to me. 
---
Then again, I'm also one of the only classes that feels equally powerful on horde or alliance. If anything I felt more powerful as a dwarf than orc. No pallies meant my cc was far better, and no dwarves to fight meant viper sting was significantly better for draining healers.
---
imagine thinking 500 rep every 10 mins doesnt pay off
---
Classic AV is 100% pve lol
---
You call that "infamous".
---
Your charges drop when u mount now which was in original but still very sucky for pvp
---
disssscoooorddddddd
---
lol yeah I felt "personally attacked" on the internet, that's why I went through all the trouble to find out you're a bigger dweeb than imaginable.
---
It’s fun though. I’ve never had a better feeling in AV than snowballing and AFK guy out and then winning the match 10 seconds later. 
---
I also run out in the beginning and do contribute.  Run back after I notice someone sitting in the spawn the entire time.
---
I would take someone like him over an actual afker any day. At least he is making room for a chance to have an actual player join.
---
That may be true Alchemy, for Engineering not so much. The things that sell are bombs, grenades and dynamite. But you can't lvl up on that stuff.
---
Yea but the luxury warriors have is that they can’t tank and make their own group. Giving you 100% to win it as long as it drops. 
---
Caster items also have a low percentages and are contested between priests, warlocks, mages, shamans, druids.
---
It isn‘t meant to be serious :-)
---
#1 on whitemane had over 1.6 million
---
If you snowball them backwards thru portal at the starting area it does :)
---
Not really a question, I just didn't think this was worthy of a separate post: [I came up with a flawless plan to lower the AV queue times for Horde.](https://imgur.com/a/lgge5Lu)
---
It's not needed for naxx, exalted just makes it free. Iirc at revered it costs a nexus crystal.
---
And the shoulder enchants at revered and exalted do require a quest, so save some commendation tokens to complete them.
---
Never played much Alli. I feel like I remember an exploit where a paladin literally one shot Kazzak. Is this what the reckoning bomb is?
---
Yeah more often now I'm seeing a lot of people go the backdoor. Even seen some allies realise this and hide in the forest below it to catch lone horde out
---
No only Gefreiter. Its basically Rank1.
---
That was before they added a cap to the number of charges someone could store using reckoning
---
Yes but how? What im "mad" at is that i dont understand how two versions of the same class are so different when on its surface the changes from Vanilla to WotLK dont seem that vast.
---
 If it wasnt obvious already im not that familiar with Paladins. And again, im not talking endgame, this is the lvling experience im getting at, sub-60
---
Changes i can think of: re-tuned Seal and Judgements, Exorcism et al usable on all mobs, Holy Cleave SoCommand, 15min blessings
---
Again, on its its face these dont seem like major changes, but apparently they added up. In anycasr, Classic Paladin is boring as hell and despite how 'cool' the class is to me utll never be fun
---
Shit pot is better than no pot that's what i learned in highschool
---
They are dumb is WSG too.... here my 3 last experience
---
At the start 8 stay defense and me (lock) and a paly go grab the flag. The paly grab the flag and our way out he got sap. I use my racial to find the stealth rogue, (they are 2) and i dot both. The paly use his invincibility and drop the flag, I then grab the flag thinking WTF ..... and then ran away leaving me with the rogue .... when i asked him WTF you are doing.... his answer. I didnt want to die ......
---
Me and another paly fighting in horde tunnel vs 2 hunter. Both hunter put their pet on me, 1 hunter is attacking me and the other one is on the paly. The paly never gave me protection. I was able to kill both but almost died at the end. A mage came from behind to finish me off (I am destro lock)
---
And last one. We are all going to the horde base at the start, our rogue got sap midfield, i keep going further pretending i didnt saw it so the rogue open on him, as soon it happen i run back and deathcoil the rogue. 2 Horde that was midfield come toward us on their horse but they are close to our berserk hut. The rogue that i was defending just decide to vanish and run away leaving me all alone vs 3 .....
---
I really miss the quality players from Nost ......
---
Horde is the answer to my question, got it
---
I leveled holy/disc as classic came out largely due to being ally on a horde dominated server made dungeon running more time efficient and being an actual healer made runs more time efficient.
---
Having transferred to heartseeker and how the amount of people in dungeons have declined I would 100% go shadow nowadays if I was doing it again and wasn't leveling with a set group.
---
Lmao whoops I totally missed the mark haha of course a laptop link. I feel dumb now
---
no offense op but these get posted every fuckin day. can we make a rule against them or something, mods?
---
Such a strange comment after you just presumed yourself people who are busy outside of wow are just hitting night clubs.
---
I did a lot of them on illidan horde during Lich King. Pretty nice gold and I could run them at the off peak times that I could play then.
---
Haha it’s all g the book was good tho
---
I kinda miss priv servers where you see in gen chat people trying to make a racist guild where you can only join if you prove tot he gm that you are racist.
---
[https://discord.gg/aBvM2j5](https://discord.gg/aBvM2j5)
---
The better players are doing premades.
---
Play a skill based class
---
That website's warrior BiS is awful
---
it's not BiS. timeworn mace/magmus stone is far better mitigation, with the bonus of not costing you dkp/gp/whatever you use
---
Yes it will. If I kept my hourly honor rate up for 18 hours a day 7 days a week, I'd be in bracket 14 on my server. You don't need to account share. That's only necessary if you want to do anything outside of WoW.
---
Just ended up vendoring mine
---
Even sadder when you realise the map is designed in a way that Ally have distinct advantages over the horde.
---
To enter the champions guild mate
---
UBRS for example, how are you taking only 1 melee dps that is also the tank? The only decent drop for casters is the reed off Jed which is in the beginning.
---
In addition, it’s an agreed upon rule that you roll for what you’re doing in the dungeon - especially in UBRS. Tank shouldn’t roll on melee dps, and vice versa.
---
What you say sounds great but in reality, is extremely difficult in practice. In 5-mans, sure maybe you can do 4 mana users and then roll on dps gear being the tank, but, your standard warrior who plays 15 hours a week like this guy suggested, will not be able to pull that off, Scholomance would be 1/3 of his play time each week.
---
its ok, I normally love playing AV, I wont queue anymore. The horde win, they can have AV. I've been exalted three days after bgs came out
---
 Nothing wrong with giving out free water and food to people who ASK. Fuck the people who just open trade. 
---
Yes it’s free to make, but still a PAIN in the ass to make enough to trade out some stacks and then buff people and then buff yourself!
---
Where do you get snowballs?
---
Has epic rank 13 and 14 gear. Nothing special? Or nothing attainable?
---
I miss being able to go in at any level and buy whatever I wanted with my hard earned honor.
---
death is the best CC
---
The good old SCHUTZENBANDER
---
Highly underrated reply.
---
Everything is doable in 5 mans- compositions only help so much, this isn’t a raid. Not sure who takes 5 hours doing scholo. Anyhow, it greatly helps to make your own group to pick and choose who your bring with you.
---
Yeah was meaning for horde, but yeah alliance have insta queues which allows premades to get in the same av
---
No, you can't have two different ranks of a DoT on a player. That is a specific mechanic for moonfire because it has an instant damage half to the spell.
---
So to explain it further, the first moonfire tick hits 3 seconds into its duration. If you spam rank 10 Moonfire rapidly, you get the instant damage, but the DoT damage never goes off because the duration is repeatedly reset.
---
If you hit them with a rank 10 Moonfire then spam with Rank 9, you get the instant damage from the Rank 9 Moonfire spam while the Rank 10 Moonfire DoT is ticking in the background. You squeeze a little extra damage and mana efficiency with this strategy.
---
&gt; horde has better PvP racials so it might be that most competent PvP players went horde side.
---
Not quite cut and dry.
---
the two commonly are cited ones are WotF and Hardiness
---
Hardiness is powerful but it's unreliable. While a good player with hardiness is better than a good player with no racials, its nature as a passive RNG means that it's not as appealing to good players (who'll want more reliable effects) as it is to bad or casual players who can benefit from it without thinking about it.
---
WotF is also technically powerful... but with some huge caveats. Only 3 classes have access to fear and one of them doesn't rely on it.  Out of all compatible classes, Rogues are also the only class that flatly benefits from it against all fear-using classes. 
---
- Warriors already have berserker rage and they still get hardbodied by locks/priests anyways. In giant brawls it's a bit more defense against fear spam which is nice, but not really gamechanging since you're not going to be fearlocked in the chaos anyways.
---
- Mages already hardbody warriors and do poorly against locks/spriests. Very little effect here.
---
- Locks already hardbody warriors, and have a solid matchup against non-dwarf priests. Mirror matches will have a significant edge to the UD.
---
- Priests already hardbody warriors. UD priest will be a bit better against locks than other races. In Mirror Matches, Fear Ward &gt; WotF every single time. 
---
Really the only incredibly strong horde racial is War Stomp and it's *really* strong but even combined with WotF/Hardiness it's still not better than what Alliance has access to.
---
Alliance however have Stoneform and Escape Artist which are both *very* strong for all classes capable of having them and on top of that, Paladins are hands down *the* best PvP healer in all aspects from buffs, to healing output, to utility (both defensive and offensive), to survivability, to mana efficiency, and so on.
---
Also another thing to consider is that tauren and gnomes both have altered melee ranges that make minor but still notable changes to balance in melee vs ranged matchups as gnome casters technically have extra range against non-tauren melees and tauren melees are technically closer to to non-gnome casters.
---
All-in-all Horde is phenomenally good at making shit players less shit, but Alliance is far and away the better PvP faction for those serious about PvP.
---
100% Agreed, the most hardcore person I saw in dreadmist was an almost full raid bis mage and a druid, and it's always fun to chat a bit in LFG at 3 am
---
Pretty sure I can tank better just running SL as a warlock, this seems painful, even for 5mans. While I can dig the meme, and I do almost fit into the tryhard group you mention, I find it a bit of a bummer someone making such a big push to make an arguably just... Shite spec work, even enhancement dps is... Laughable, clearly it just plainly doesn't matter in the current tier, nor will it for a while, but man, for someone who's exalted with AV and running enhancement just for the meme, it feels strange, if nothing else.
---
Though, I do wonder if 2-handers might be superior threat generation, at least for bosses where the damage is usually a bit more managable and the healing a bit more certain.
---
I recognize those guildnames. This is Venoxis, i isn't it?
---
In legacy software, most hotfixes require a compile to be installed which requires downtime even if it's brief.
---
You have to have at least 15 HK's a week otherwise you don't get put into a bracket for RP.
---
Gotcha! Sounds cool, will put in bag of tricks when super seriously playing my lvl 7 Druid to its fullest lol
---
You would be happier on retail.  If you choose to take that as an insult that's your prerogative.
---
And why is it hilarious?  Should pve realms not min max or strive for firsts ??
---
Gutgore ripper takes a debuff slot, you won't be raiding with it that's for damn sure.
---
Alliance smacked our Ice lord though :/. I was also in this AV ^^
---
Weapon skill
---
Yeah, everyone thought the map was imbalanced back in vanilla, but I'm starting to think it's actually just queue length. In vanilla horde had instant queue, so no one really tried to win. Same thing last week when AV launched.
---
But now... Now I spend as much time in queue as I do playing. As that queue time has gone up, fewer and fewer people are whinging about letting the alliance win. People coordinate, people defend, people summon a 6 story elemental and feed them human blood. It's great.
---
Yeah but that's not the true classic experience. Not even close.
---
Hey I'm a 60 druid with  max elemental LW with recipes, and recently dropped skinning for enchanting (as I got the heart of the mountain recipe which I made).  I had 300 skinning + finkel's skinner and I eventually want a breastplate of bloodthirst.  I plan to keep LW for my guild.  I'm wondering if it's worth going skinning again, or just going for a better gold income gathering profession so that I can eventually buy a pristine hide of the beast.  Would herblore or mining be better for a druid in general (keeping in mind jump runs, etc)?
---
Same!
---
Still after 305 still helps your glancing blows do more damage, so 313 swords beats 305 maces by a little.
---
OEB is 64.7 dps and has 42 strength which means not only that as far as white hits it has 70.7 effective dps but the 84 ap from strength makes your bloodthirst hit harder.
---
TUF has 61.5 dps and 19 strength and 2 crit. Crit is worth roughly 30 AP each, so TUF effectively gives 19*2 + 2 * 30 = 98 attack power in addition to it's normal damage. That makes it's effective dps 68.5 which is slightly less than OEB but having less weapon skill makes it even worse in comparison on level 63 mobs. This difference is even bigger if you're not a human obviously.
---
