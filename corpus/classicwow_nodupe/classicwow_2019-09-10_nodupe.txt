This is more like it!
---
---
---
I swear DPS doesn't give a fuck about anything
---

---
I specifically mark skull and cross as the kill order, also tag one with moon. Every fucking pull they're attacking different targets. Or one starts to AoE while 2 others are focusing different targets.
---
Dude you're making my job 10x harder fucking stop it or I will fucking boot you.
---
My desire to finish the dungeon has been shrinking FAST. I ignore bullshit like this but I won't tolerate this shit on 60.
---
For reference I started out in late vanilla as a warrior back in the day. People weren't doing retarded shit in Wotlk, let alone vanilla. You'd be blacklisted and publicly shamed for this kind of shit.
---
That gosh darn auto correct. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Do you guys not use LookingForGroup? It‚Äôs still a world channel... and doesn‚Äôt have this shit happen.
---
Now *this* is the real life pro tip. Thanks a bunch.
---
I never played vanilla, but the only small complaint I have about classic, and I only complain internally about it other than this one time, is the goddamn motherfucking test of strength Rok'Alim spawn or whatever his name is. Ran up and down the cliff face for 2 fucking days before I was able to get into a group and killed it. Other than that, I have no complaints. I really enjoy classic and I can see why so many people wanted it, it's fun to be able to relive the past in ones favorite game.

---
Yeah that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre a fucking  europeAn. Real achievers shit up
---
I have made it my sole quest in the game to give every player I see Underwater Breathing and detect Lesser Invis.
---
I have so far been insulted 3 times through whispers and had the buff clicked off at least 14 times.
---
Half of them are still attacking something else.
---
It‚Äôs not really efficient if you‚Äôre trying to kill 10 mobs in a row without drinking. If you‚Äôre going against an elite mob then sure it could be worth it. If you mind blast/sw:p and then wand til they‚Äôre dead you‚Äôll regen a lot of the mana before the next fight. The key is to always keep moving. Priests can be very efficient levelers this way. All depends on your play style though.

naxx is easier than retail heroic lmao

Take it slow, enjoy the journey. Read the quest texts, understand the lore behind every area.

Tailoring to craft cloth gear and enchanting are good because you can get some really powerful equipment.
---
Alchemy and Herbalism are great for potions
---
It just comes down to preference really, most items can be bought (But generally the top tier items are BoP). 
---
Personally I have a gnome mage with engineering, I just love mind controlling people off boats/zeppelins.
---
the bug existed since the start of the game i know it existed for sure in TBC but it wasn't untill WotLK ICC you could actually use this bug for DPS gains as at the point you cross the point were you are getting so much rage from just main-hand attacks to not only can you feed your rotation but also your heroic strike without this bug you would get rage starved as a fury warrior.
---
let me just be clear this won't change the warrior meta of classic it just means that in the 20-36 leveling window if your find yourself dual wielding two really good weapons in the slow main-hand fast off-hand combo spamming heroic strike is your best bet for good dps.
---
your best option however is still a good two-hander and sunder armor and in that level bracket you have the WC staff so it isn't untill level 26 you can get upgrades knowing this quirk and then at level 29 you can get the corpsemaker which just trashes this combo.
---
the only reason i know about this bug in heroic strike is since i was in a top 100 guild in WotLK where it was relavant.
---
We are all psychic.
---
Are Gelkis the ones with the sort of castle?
---
Also I'm Tauren so fuck em all
---
Oh okay, but then why do some of them show their game version as 8.2.0 in the add-on list, even though they are made for Classic too? That's what confused me.
---

Dont worry, just play. You will get a little bit more skilled each day and learn something new. Mess around with your keybinds and dont be afraid to experiment.

There's no way to generate enough rage to even pretend to tank things if I put on shield. 2H tanking all the way. Plus, whose bright idea was it to have thunderclap in battle stance only??
---
&gt; I mean you should still watch the tank and attack his target
---
No.
---
Server side? im not sure what this means hehe
---
15+ years of raiding these dungeons will make it trivial no matter which patch we're in.
---
People know their roles, know the minimum requirements and know exactly what to do.
---
When you raided MC for the first time in 2005 you had no idea what to do and would wipe on every third pull because a hunter forgot about their pet.
---
The game hasn't changed, the players have.
---
I saw someone map out how to level to sixty with just killing boars and nothing else. This can be done.
---
If you do all the quests outside first, then you should only need to run Ulda once I believe. 
---
But you'll probably run it multiple times anyway since it's great.
---
No one ever said classic is harder than retail
---
Ahh yes, the welfare patch. (I didn't start playing till 4.3, I just see people call it this.)
---
Maybe I got redundant in my description but I'm not looking for an attack macro. I'll cast stealth and ambush manually just was wondering if a macro could just switch items 16 and 17 / 17 and 16.

Anyway thanks for that speedy reply!

Everyone's just using 60% mechanical keyboards.
---
This.... is good to know.
---
Nice
---
It will never be hard no matter what you do, it just may take a few more hours of gearing to clear. Stop worrying about it
---
Playing Warlock, I realized you need to pace yourself to actually keep threat on your Voidwalker. Also had it happen a few times in groups too. Threat control is (somewhat of) a team effort. Which caught me off-guard after like a decade of games where the Tank facerolls their keyboard and the mob is glued to them. I like it.
---
Fast traveling ruins it for sure... but ashenvale more than any other zone has tons of random obstacles.
---
As in the draw distance is set by blizzard themselves based on server population to decrease lag. Unfortunately if you‚Äôre already running low settings, there‚Äôs not much else that can be done. Maybe try closing out all active launchers like steam, discord, etc etc and see if that helps.
---
Leveling my first priest, just came across two different wands with the same DPS but one of them significantly faster than the other. Does it matter much which one I choose? Does one want a fast wand or one that hits harder but less often as a priest or does it not matter much?
---
Nope, I gotta work 10 hours a day that I'd rather be grinding :(
---
On the plus side, I'm not saddled with the reputation warlocks are earning. They have become my single most despised class to dungeon with. The "lifetap" problem from vanilla seems to be 100x worse to the point that every single dungeon I'm getting bitched at to heal them despite being oom and drinking after every fight.
---
The two "too poor to afford drinks" warlocks in RFK probably broke me a little mentally.
---
Also, you‚Äôre thinking of ‚Äúview distance‚Äù which does not effect the range at which mobs are visible to the player, only the environment
---
Questing, generally.
---
You wouldn't download a car, why would you print a screen?
---
Lots of people did.  There are dozens of videos online explaining why vanilla was so much harder.
---
Broken tooth was suprisingly quick. Took a bunch of effort to get to badlands but i went to his spawn and logged out. The next morning nothing but i had an errand to run. Came back nothin but saw a hunter there and asked him. He told me he just saw someome tame broken tooth om a other layer. I switched to another layer one and he was sittin right there. Was terrifying. Almost died clearing a wolf and then while taming a cat came at me and i died about 2% from finishing the tame. Fortunately, the shrines super close. Second time i got him without mich trouble.

"casuls won't handle classic's difficulty"
---
"I don't play retail cause its dumbed down and too easy"
---
these sentences I've seen them over a 1000 times over the past few years, a good chunk of the classic wow community is trying to make it seems like Vanilla is the Dark Souls of mmo.
---
Go back to Goldshire and suck a dick you nonce
---
Dude, northwest feralas is AMAZING. It never ceases to amaze me.
---

---
I don't think you understand. Ret is pretty awful.
---
I should do more dungeons on mine.
---
Why does classic make retail players so salty? Get over it already, nobody likes your game. Notice how when you log into retail, that it's dead?
---
If your game was so good, more people would be playing it. Period.
---
Imagine writing an essay about other character's names.
---
Here, have a downvote
---
Yeah people use it (I don't), but I think world channel is more used now.
---
Yes exactly.  I don't understand op's point I guess.
---
Good luck bro. School's rampin' up and Borderlands 3 is coming out next week... WoW can be a tough itch to scratch.
---
Mind you I was grinding mobs in an area with next to no one around. I'd imagine if you're in a city or something it would use more data
---
Nice! That some serious luck on getting 3. 1 is enough for me lol.
---
That would have to be looked at an example to be sure, but it could just be that the retail version was the last released and the twitch client just shows the latest version there, on the curse site they list the latest versions for retail and classic separately, could always be something they will improve as time goes.
---
I went [very deep just for this post.](https://i.gyazo.com/5a74af1380ea6e16c0009339ae1f22ca.jpg)
---
Going to research this more on the Warlock discord but since you started an AMA...
---
Most of our bis gear for phase one and two is ..of shadow wrath (iirc) gear. I‚Äôm trying to work out if there is a point comparison available for int to shadow dmg to know when one outweighs the other. Any ideas?
---
I mean dunno, the only recipe I saw sells for 50g and I haven't had that kind of money, and I really enjoyed that grind (met another lock trying to get it, there were some altercations with the alliance) and got a level off of it, it didn't even slow me down that much.
---
&gt;I'll also never understand why every Horde city is completely connected but Darnassus was left out to dry
---
A lot of WoW is fairly random, poorly connected stuff.
---
It's one of the reason classic has the magic feel it does. Not everything is streamlined.
---
Any of the expansions you get the sense that *nothing* is random, everything has a well-defined purpose.

Ever met a person fitting that description and thought "that's an interesting person"?

More like lying scum..a 30-32 warrior fought off guards, got jumped by **2** druids, somehow charged onto an elevator and went on to kill the rogue of probably similar level?

Your healer is *not* happy that you just rooted a mob next to them and ran away while they were distracted.

sorry I didn't further explain my self.

is there a guide to explain what dungs and areas to farm specifically? melee cleave comps are a bit better due to not having to deal with ranged attacks.
---
Try [this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/CVar_farclip):  /console farclip 200
---
Or edit your config.wtf and do:
---
set farclip 200
---
All bow down before my Prairie Chicken
---
It's easy because (1) it has indeed been mastered; (2) it has been *massively* nerfed over the course of Vanilla, and all of these nerfs are already active in Classic; and (3) the itemization and class balances are in the fully buffed 1.12 state. These are three *major* difficulty nerfs, effectively trivializing the PvE in Classic. The one most effective step towards a countermeasure to this would be to have contemporary in a pre-nerf state.
---
I a lowly commoner did not know this and was using heroic strike constantly bc I thought it was better dps
---

melee (you know.)

just different set ups but I forgot to further explain myself.
---
Double blocking against a priest should prolly do the trick against priests, as the duel or fight should prolly be over within a minute unless a lot of resetting is going on.
---
But against a fear spamming warlock, I'd have to say that even just breaking that fear one extra time must be better 100% of the time. But I don't know. Maybe if you're like super clutch with using the haste at good times it might come more in handy, so hard to say.
---
Yep. Fully nerfed and ready to masspull as if it was BfA.
---
You have 300 riding at lvl 46? ....

Any advice on how to find these or just hit google and start looking?

Got it, thanks for the clarification! :)

cba getting that 300 Polearm skill
---
Nothing in my post states retail is good or better than classic, buy some glasses.
---
We love you too!
---
I think it will be fine.  Part of it is population.  I think my server has a lower pop than others, less layers, etc.  I had one day I had to queue, and it was maybe 20 minutes.  Every day after that I got right in.  Took hops from 2 other servers to get there, but I'm happy where I'm at.  No waiting, and plenty of people to group with. 
---
I don't think we have anything to worry about.
---
Rogue's always my main
---
Lol I usually jump around the mob in circles waiting for them to loot it so I can skin it. "It's here! It's here! Hey, did you forget where your mob died? It's here, come loot it! Yohoo!"
---
This is why I don't currently play. If classic gave us the slow leveling and slow progression it might feel like it did back in the day when each piece of gear felt special. This easy mode version of classic is a bit sad imo, not much different than rerunning the old content on your main and where's the value in that?
---
Oh help classic is going to be retail all over again because my friend has another hairstyle now!
---
You compare the focus of endgame, introducing new zones that make the old content useless, new lvl caps and flying with a barbershop?
---
Wtf.
---
Btw. They shouldve used player models of wotlk.
---
#nochange my arse. Why not use bloodelf models for actual bloodelves? and what speaks about more hairstyles that actually will prevent players from using the exact same hairstyle?
---
Imo much worse that every female human walks around with the same fuckn hairstyle. Id chosen others but no, theyre ugly or arent good looking anymore cince we arent in the early 2000s and style changes.
---
But you prob play with modern textures but cry once i bring the wotlk player model argument.
---
Btw. #nochanges my arse using 1.13 patch....
---
You don't really need to be at full mana before every pull. It's safe to pull as long as the healer is drinking. By the time the tank needs healing, he will have drunk enough to heal the pack. And a mage opening from a distance isn't terrible, depending on the pack. If it's all melee, you really might as well. Because with enough ranged dps it can be dead or half dead by the time it closes the gap, and you were going to have to taunt the main target back anyway if any of your attacks missed. 
---
DPS pulling in a controlled way can be quite advantageous
---
Rolled Alliance on a PvP server?
---
Robe itself was for like 4g on my realm, maybe I was just lucky, bit got my robes veeery early
---
It's in the API which is posted online.  Google wow Lua API.  You will use /fstack to find the frame name of the Gryphons and then call the hide function of the frame.
---
.9999^10000 = .367 or 36.7% chance of not seeing it drop.
---
Solo is very viable, tagging is the hardest aspect.
---
Just soloed the underwater Murlocs in STV, apparently my mage friend 5 levels above was unable to solo it.
---
best example for this is the one and only Arcanite Reaper. if you had one in a major city suddenly there would be a whole lot of people within inspect range.  not only did it look great and downright mean it hit like a truck.
---
agreed.
---
nah my dude.   live the dream as long as you can.
---
I'm not sure how old your PC is that it can't run classic wow properly. if it's a laptop maybe check temperature and dust to make sure it's not overheating and throttling.
---
Play stupid games win stupid prizes
---
Maybe don‚Äôt worry about what the world first tryhards are doing. Don‚Äôt race through content and actually enjoy the game.
---
Yeah, a big reason for WoW drawing people in was because of the art.
---
Generic high res graphics prevent people from getting sucked in to the world as much...the homey feeling is important.  Gummi Bears works where LotR fails.
---
This guy fucks
---
I don‚Äôt think people was really saying raiding mechanics were harder.... I think people were meaning levelling? I have a level 23 warrior and I have died an absolute ton of times.. however if I made a warrior on retail I‚Äôd barely ever die... pulling more than two mobs is basically death.. I think that‚Äôs what people were meaning as hard..
---
Just turned a passive Hunter into a kill on site Hunter, a disservice to warriors everywhere.
---
The decision is real
---
What is your post stating exactly? That you're bitter about everyone enjoying classic so you decided to come here to tell us that it's "not hard" ?
---
Cool story brother.

Yes !

---
I went to the barrens Im pretty sure you can't kill low horde unless they choose to enable pvp specifically since everyone was green
---
Thank you.
---
Already use questie, map is clear for elwynn.
---
Agreed. My sensation of the Classic PvE has been more similar to retail's Timewalking than actual Vanilla. The leveling-meta of mass-pulling and AoEing dungeons, as elite mobs had lower hp and low damage, kinda turned me off. It felt like pissing on the grave of a legendary game. Still loving Classic and will continue to play.
---
Go to loch modan and level there
---
More like that's some layer hopping lol.
---
Go back to bed and leave us alone, troll. The leveling in retail has only been decent since 7.3.5's leveling changes and scaling zones, which a large percentage of the playerbase hated. The leveling in Classic is measured, slower, more engaging by far, more *fun*, and more challenging than "hit your two button rotation, kill a mob, repeat three times, AOE loot, and leave" in retail.
---
Are the endgame raids more engaging in retail? Arguably. Are there more dynamics, and more varied actions you have to perform? You betcha. Is it more difficult to run with 19 highly-specialized players to clear the top-end content than it is to run with 39 people, with everyone mainly not standing in fire and using a mana-efficient rotation? Yeah. But only a small percentage of the playerbase will ever see Mythic BfA raids. Many, many more Classic players will try their hands at 40-man raids. And I'd say Classic raids are harder to coordinate, at least, than LFR or normal PuGs in retail. There may be less dynamics, and less purported "difficulty" in those which are present, but the watered-down "tourist mode" or even the "regular" difficulty you clear with PuGs at high speed for transmog between guild Heroic runs don't offer much to a skilled player either.
---
It's pretty obvious that if you had to change your name because it was inappropriate, don't change it back to the same thing .
---
That's like someone going to jail for stabbing someone and when they get released, they do it again and go to jail and wonder why they got in trouble since they were allowed to buy another knife
---
Horde and 1v1s, laughable. First of all you would have to find a place on a PvP server where there wasn't 10 horde to every alliance.
---
My thoughts exactly.....
---
Lol
---
Keybinds
---
Set a and d to strafe instead of turning. Only use your mouse to turn. From left to right on your bottom left action bar your keybinds can be qertzxcv1234. These keys are closest to wasd and are easiest for me and most players  feel free to change the order.
---
Bar above that should be the same exact order as the bottom but with the shift or ctrl modifier depending on your preferences.  Unless you are a healer those will be more than enough keybinds for every skill you are using every 5-10 minutes or less. Stuff like professions and anything you only ocassionally need to use (like 30 minute buffs or potions) can be on the right or side bar to be clicked when needed.
---
Skills
---
Dont worry about it. You can respec, but it does cost gold. Mostly pick one tree and fill it up. Put the remaining points in other tree skills that benefit you the most. If you want to save time experimenting  and gold, google wow classic talent guide for whatever class you are playing. There is always a best talent build for whatever you are doing. 
---
Equipment
---
Quest and just play the game. You will get enough upgrades to keep you going. Depending on class each one will want certain stats more than others. Mages obviously dont want strength.  Priests have no use for agility. Pretty straight forward. Some gear can be more of a side grade than an upgrade, but until you are raiding it really doesn't matter. Just use stuff that drops and quest rewards. 
---
Take it slow. It seems complex but its not.
---
I also like renew because of the 5 second rule.  I will heal and then drop a renew at the same time, then try to get in as many ticks of regen between then and my next heal as I safely can. With renew on to provide healing during this time, I get more ticks in.
---
Leatrix plus has an option to extend it much further
---
&gt;Isn't it their fault
---
Nope.
---
Agility actually increases wand damage so it would be just as good for the priest as it is for the hunter.
---
Is Sumo an appropriate RP name? So far I‚Äôve had some really cool RP interactions, which is fun for me since it‚Äôs my first time rolling on an RPPVP server. 
---
I know my name references something outside of the Warcraft universe but it kinda reflects my play style as a combat rogue who‚Äôs more likely to sprint into a fight than sneak around.

Just don‚Äôt wanna mess up anyone else‚Äôs experiences, everyone on my server has been really cool so far

That was my experience in arathil basin yesterday before the DDoS attacks. Bastards the whole lot, made me want to go to ashenvale and get some revenge on the horde but then I got stuck on the boat. So I simply logged off.
---
Do you scramble the egg? Or hardboil before? Or throw it in raw?
---
I always hit Alliance with the old Succubus Seduction, /kiss, back to passive combo. A little rapey but all in good fun. They never seem to mind.
---
....at level 12?
---
Another warrior falls for the statistics boys.
---
You: *Shoots self in chest*
---
Also you: Why would Blizzard do this?
---
Got my warrior to 43... started my mage a few days ago.  Every 10 days or whatever it takes to have the full level and a half or two levels of rested xp I'll go grind on the warrior then bal to getting rested and playing the mage.  That's my plan to get my warrior the rest of the way.  Won't feel as bad when it's 2 levels at a time at double speed basically then back to the fun on the mage.
---
Side note:  mage has to be the best class to hit level 20 as.  Hit that last night.. get blizzard, evocation, mana shield, teleports, blink.... so much goodness at that level feels like you get supercharged.

You‚Äôre actually disarmed, sorry

You‚Äôre skill in unarmed has increased to 153.

You‚Äôre skill in unarmed has increased to 154.

As alliance, I find that if you kill the horde first they can‚Äôt kill you first
---
Was that your pre tbc experience?
---
Given the quest chains from Goldshire, up to Eatvale Logging camp, the two mines and the farms, there‚Äôs more than enough experience to get you to almost 13, excluding the Western Guard tower quests involving Hogger and what not, so I‚Äôm not sure how you‚Äôre so under levelled. You won‚Äôt be able to do much except hop on a train to Ironforge and run to Loch Modan, which would be faster than going to Dark Shore.
---
Unique itemization also keeps drops from feeling like ‚Äúthis is higher level req./ilvl better equip it‚Äù as you‚Äôre leveling, for healers especially (5SR plays a big part too)
---
I just want to know what addons you‚Äôre running. Looks super clean. And how did you zoom out that far? I‚Äôm coming back into Classic after not playing WoW for the last 11 years.

Think of the time you spend because of others mistakes haha. It goes full circle. If nothing else you quietly taught someone something without them having to ask.

Which leads me to a side note; don‚Äôt be afraid to ask. Seriously. You don‚Äôt look stupid making sure you know your role in a fight. Take criticism well, learn from mistakes, ask questions and you‚Äôre fine.

I‚Äôm glad I could help. I wish you luck too :p

Classic raiding is light on mechanics and pretty forgiving if part of your raid dies to them. 
---
That said, MC and Onyxia were both nerfed in late vanilla, and we are playing with the nerfed versions in classic. Raids that will open in the later phases were never nerfed (besides c‚Äôthun) and so they should be a lot harder, hopefully the same difficulty as they were on good-quality private servers. 
---
The gruelling difficulty of vanilla that people talk about is more about leveling, farming, and logistics.
---
you do that anyway in the 20s...

Everyone is farming SM + ZF GY (Get to the part with the graves and spawn the mobs). Don't know of a guide out there, just join a group and let someone else lead. Word of mouth is sometimes the best guide. They are the two most linear + dense dungeons around. Only other real farming I can think of is strat live.
---
I don't know any significant farming places, I'm not very experienced in vanilla, for example why whelps?
---
As a MOBA player putting my abilities on QERT is something i feel stupid for missing, thanks for the answer :)
---
I'm on Fairbanks (NA) and queues went from peaking at 15k to 3k since the free transfers started.
---
How is that possible?
---
This was me last week.
---
How is not using gathering better money relative to time spent than using gathering...? That makes no sense
---
Actually dude could you please DM me a screenshot to your ticket including ticket number if thats OK? The GMs I'm talking to can't get it through their fucking heads that I'm not asking for a "name change service", I'm asking them to trigger a forced name change like they no doubt do every day.
---
And the response I have received 3 days in a row is basically "Chin up, we don't think your name is offensive, but maybe we'll let you pay for a change some time in the future"
---
Whole other ballgame. But you certainly have a point
---
I'm not talking about the robes, I'm talking about the pattern. I wanted the pattern to make robes and sell them on the AH. I am the guy you pay your 4g to. ;)
---
Talk to a troll on the docks
---
Perfect comment right there.
---
I just healed a run at 28, bosses were 33 (so red) but as long as your tank is decent it should be fine. Keep in mind, get a new heal rank at 28.
---
yeah, right now stocks is all melee so its easy but its starting to slow down and SM GY isn't a go. 
---
just trying to see if people are running gnomer / SFK or a dung spot between levels 27-33
---
Happy cakeday !
---
You need to pump your brakes, guy. It is, by no means, **NOT** always possible to keep a group up as a healer.
---
If your dps in the group is stepping on your tank and going ahead of them, pulling when the healer has no mana, those DPS are damn well going to die. I will sit my happy ass down and drink water until I have at *least* half mana to heal.
---
Yes, I agree the ultimate goal is to clear a dungeon as fast as you can. No one wants to be sitting around for hours. But you're forgetting that Classic is a game of communication and teamwork, not "one person takes it upon him/her self to do what they want" and screw up the group. Where in the hell do you think it's okay for DPS to pull and cause this much chaos when your either your tank and/or healer aren't ready?
---
Your mentality is the exact reason why Retail is the way it is today.
---
And if you don't like that, Classic is *Not* the game for you.
---
Remember: we asked for it, but wouldn‚Äôt like it if we got it.
---
Yeah, sure... lol
---
Join a new guild? My first few days of classic the general chat was like that. I eventually switched servers to play with a group of friends and coincidentally noticed the general edgy toxicity in chat dropped significantly. So could totally be server dependent.
---
Yep. They have utility like tranq shot, kiting etc. though so you still bring them to raids.
---
Warriors need intellect to gain weapon skill ups, its useful not as much as the other classes but still useful.
---
I've been doing nothing but questing and I've only found DM and Gnome, and I'm past some other dungeons in levels already
---

---
From what I've heard only a few hunters can come in a full raid party. Other classes are more necessary in higher tiers.
---
What are appropriate items to need on during dungeons? What are the most important stats for locks? I really enjoy playing a warlock, but I'm currently lvl45 and I'm feeling its hard to find better gear than the stuff I collected around lvl 32-37. So many quest rewards you can't use, and little good cloth gear or MH/OH weapons with spell damage. Also, I still have the same wand from like lvl 30. Any advice on getting better gear during leveling?
---
Gotta try this. Thanks for the tip!
---
Thanks! Celebrating with some classic!
---
I rolled horde on an RP server just in hopes of having it be low pop and not be in competition for quests all the time.  I don't role play , and don't really intend to... That said, my character is simply named "Selian", and i mostly keep out of public channels.  I know I'm trespassing, and I'm not going to try and ruin the fun for other people.
---
Don't worry, this game is too involved for them.
---
Oh the hunter pet pulling the whole room is like a right of passage for you guys haha
---
I've noticed there's a ton of healers in classic and most are priests.  At low levels, there was a higher demand for dps than heals on my server. Now I'm 40 and it's a bit better but healing still isn't in demand.  I don't easily find groups like I did in vanilla.
---
that retail is way harder than classic and that skill ceiling is too much higher
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it's still doable
---
That's because they are bind on pick up
---
For some reasons elvui won't work for me on classic, so I've had to use suf. Any tips? I thought it would be easy to use too, because I use it in retail.
---
We were never expecting 1.0 Vanilla.  It isn't "nerfed", it's what the end of Vanilla was like.
---
Ret paladin spotted
---
Had this happen in retail years ago when I was trying to get a flying mount. I always undercut regardless because the market is always ridiculous and got a lot of hate mail and whispers every time I logged in on my enchanter but fuck these people. You wanted to make money and not be an asshole, if they care so much *they* can buy your stock and resell.
---
Oof
---
When he /chicken's everyone else dances.
---
I've been doing alright with a shield, but I get what you mean with rage generation. That's why I'm playing Arms/Fury so I don't can boost rage gen. And I have no idea, maybe they wanted more micro-management so it's a bit more difficult...being that you have to switch stances so you can have certain skills. Usually I'm switching stances many times during combat anyways.
---
Take this up in his community, wherever that is.
---
Is windfury elemental?
---
I really hope so, as that would be optimal.  I hope it happens soon, I really feel the community element is missing from the classic experience.
---
Unfortunately, the only quests that are repeatable will have a blue exclamation point above them. I don't believe any of the cooking quests you come across in the wild are repeatable.
---

Not green due to xp penalty. 1-2 levels below is ideal, I've found. YMMV because I'm a human DW swords, though.

Well Asmon hit 60 yesterday was it? Maybe it was a case of a little bit of everything. Under geared raiders, the odd moron etc
---
No. But in the tavern in the old town district in stormwind. There is a vendor that sells all those quest recipes and a couple extra. The man is up the stairs.
---
No your internet just sucks
---
My interpretation is that we're looking at the portal from real life's perspective where everything is terrible and shitty and through the portal is the World of Warcraft where everything is great.
---
haha it's a decent flight break to get up and stretch
---
If people want to maximize gold and xp/hr, then they are certainly free to do so. Go find a different group and don't let other peoples choices get you so heated
---
Been leveling my Mining so I‚Äôve been visiting a lot of lower zones.  I like to rush up to the lowbies and stand right on top of them to give them a little scare. Usually I‚Äôll just /wave /lick the lowbies and help em out even if they are dirty alliance.  Tho I had one low level mage try to spam sheep me while mining. He got camped.

Do you have a recommended add on for Nightfall procs?
---
Shadow is great for leveling, no or little downtime. It just doesn't work well in actual group/raid pve, because then it turns into, like, all downtime.
---
In PVP it's good for melting faces though.
---
This was true in early vanilla, but was patched long before 1.12
---
I take it you were bad before tbc?
---
Protection warriors have severe rage issues - namely generating enough to keep up with the main tank and stay above the threat whore dps on fights with tank swaps...
---
Generally agree, but you're neglecting the benefit of specials not glancing, which is important when leveling.
---
That's what I was thinking...
---
That dude walked back once to his corpse then logged in frustration
---
I like this take.  Major Feels.
---
This was an amazing video, thanks for the nostalgia trip
---
No one person should take it upon themselves to do what they want?
---
Then maybe you should agree with me when I tell these people to get over themselves and heal people and not let them die.
---
Free cash is how I see it.
---
I‚Äôm not spending anymore gold outside of absolutely necessary spells until I get my mount haha 50g so far it‚Äôs coming right along
---
I take it you're 5 years old
---
Truer words have never been spoken, friend.
---
Not freaking out. Raising an issue. Issue is that (1) this is not authentic Vanilla experience for contemporary content; (2) this significantly shortens Classic's lifespan (alternatively leads to an unhealthy stagnation); and (3) diminish the epic sensation of overcoming difficult challenges together. I for one was pretty turned off by the leveling-meta of masspulling elites and AoEing them down with ease in a group of pugs. It did not feel like Vanilla, it felt like BfA Timewalking.
---
Nope, set to . on the numpad
---
I laughed when I saw challenging shout was a 10 min cool down.
---
Wow, it was one of my favourite wow videos, better than the minus 50 dkp or leeroy Jenkins that's for sure
---
Well refute my point then with your big adult brain
---
When I talk about BFAs quests, I'm talking about things that would be part of loremaster. The main story quests, and the zone specific ones you don't need to do. 
---
You still haven't addressed quest design. Classic is a set of four or five templates, essentially limited to the actions of kill thing, click thing. Retail has those too, plus additional designs. Surely, even one additional way for a quest's story to be told and experienced is better than minus one way to do a quest. 
---
I don't know what about this is blowing your mind so hard. I would hope we could at least find common ground on 2 &lt; 3 when it comes to developers having creative ways to use game mechanics to flesh out any given quest. 
---
The quest for First Aid where you do triage wouldn't be better if it was just killing 15 dudes instead. Devs obviously can't hand craft custom systems for every single quest, they need tools to work and those tools need to be reused elsewhere to justify developing. There are simply more options and mechanics to utilize in quests added over time. 
---
Also regarding "shallow" quest hubs with breadcrumbs to another area... Is something you can say about Classic, but clumsier. Also BFA literally does what you said it doesn't, it will send you to butt end of the zone to fetch or do something at the other.
---
Server - Kurinaxx  
---
Guild - Eternal Rest
---
I reserved 3 names and have only logged into one. Got my mount last night, second generation UD lock main going strong.
---
Did it work? Fantastic if it did. It's so difficult to know how much detail to go into. I wanted to give you enough information for you to know what to do but not be patronising. It's impossible to know how comfortable somebody already is with some of the steps like extracting a zip file or copying files around. It could be they just need to know where to put the files, or it could be they don't know what zip files are or how to copy files around and need step by step how to extract them to the right place. Hopefully I got it right!
---
Forgot to mention, now you've got the addon installed, make sure to run a scan frequently when you're passing the action house. The addon should have added a button in the auction house screen to do a scan and it should only take a couple of minutes. As the game is new I'd expect prices to be changing quite a bit as the game progresses so up to date scans are as important as ever. 
---
Hopefully as well the above has given you the confidence if you want to install other addons too, it's basically the same thing.
---
And thanks for the gold. It was completely unnecessary, but I very much appreciate it.
---
That's about what I own, unfortunately
---
‚ÄúIf possible‚Äù

How does windfury play a role in this? Can‚Äôt heroic strike proc windfury?
---
I‚Äôm not poking holes. You‚Äôve shown your character through your actions, which you willingly showed here.
---
I‚Äôve answered your question.

Can you explain more? First time ever being a healer in wow just started last week
---
Sweeping strikes is awesome, Cleave is pretty great. But when I used them for the first time? I felt like I unlocked a puzzle they work so well.
---
Someone just posted a list today on here a few hours ago.  Lists every dungeon, starting mob level, boss level, recommended level to run. Look through recent post.
---
I tell priests to throw a renew on me if they can afford it, and to never worry about healing me. I know how to maintain my own health when tapping - cannibalize, life drain, etc - the heals are just added bonus.
---
*cries in levels ending in 8 and 9*
---
I'm level 29, my max mana is 2497. My conjured water that does 835 mana over 25 seconds is like throwing pebbles at Ragnaros.
---
1-2 levels below huh? ü§îü§î
---
*sits back and continues questing and killing things 3 levels higher as tank because he already completed everything lower*
---
I remember when I had to travel on foot for an hour to reach a dungeon and not being able to clear it because it took over an hour and people had to leave... oh wait on retail I can stay in one spot and queue for everything; never speak to anybody else, and clear everything by smashing my face over the keyboard
---
So what do you want? Pre nerf c'thun?
---
Who reads the words on the smoke-break screen?

That‚Äôs my server. :‚Äô)

Any AoE on the ground sucks to use as well in 3D can‚Äôt get it in the right plane

He‚Äôs not there on Pagle. Is it already started for non-NA?
---
Im no where near mc yet but in general people just seem way worse than they were back in the day.  The stupid things people do in even 5 mans is mind blowing. I could be mis-remembering but ibfeel like people used to be way more competent when it came to teamwork.
---
My problem for me is only that in the middle of some pulls it can be hard to tell if the warlock‚Äôs got a hold of things or being attacked.
---
 Literally the best healers in the game. 
---
Paladins: "lol, why are you downranking?"
---
Also Paladins: "What, you're out of mana? I'm still perfectly fine."
---
Ye i honestly dislike the 1.13 patch.
---
Cant understand why blizzard thought that a pre tbc catch up patch was a good idea.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
It isn't the difficulty that makes classic hard it's the investment to get to the actual raid.
---
No doubt retail has more mechanics but there's just the raid, that is it.
---
In retail getting to the actual raid is part of the challenge. Its comparing two widely different games
---
Guys I‚Äôm not a fan of this guy, just a casual viewer and caught his MC raid on twitch lol. Just interested in genuine answers about the raid leading I saw. If he didn‚Äôt do a good job I‚Äôm interested in knowing why esp from knowledgeable players!!
---
Indeed we did not. It is nerfed, as it was in the end of Vanilla, as you say. These nerfs was intended as catch-up mechanics, trivializing past content. This trivialized content is what we get. Only difference is that it's *current* and not *past* content due to gated content.

What server are you on that actually has Alliance?

Even post-CU it was a good game. I didn't agree with most of the things they did but the game obviously needed some changes. The population even rebounded after CU and the game was doing okay until they decided to burn it all down with NGE.

How would you rate fury vs arms for leveling ? I‚Äôm almost 40 as arms but I‚Äôve seen a lot of fury warriors and I feel like they are crushing it while I‚Äôm here dying
---
Not agreeing or disagreeing with OP's point, but Heroic Strike actually costs more than 15 rage - it costs the 15 rage sticker price, plus the potential rage you would have gained from the white melee attack that Heroic Strike replaced.
---
When you calculate DPR for abilities, you have to factor in the estimated lost rage from the replaced melee attack in Heroic Strike.
---
Sometimes you just wanna get some quests done, and fostering a bit of good will usually goes a long way.
---
Glad you didn't try to defend you're original nonsense post.  The point is that the game is hard coded with a population cap, which they are circumventing right now by using layers.  That means you have anywhere from double to x9 of the normal population on the same server, randomly interacting together.  You seem to miss this, as shown by your first post.  That's not classic, which doesn't matter to you anyway, since you want private server population, so why are in classic?
---
I hope you get to experience a real community, it would change you for the better.
---
Sunder = More white damage. More overpowers. More deep wounds. More party damage. Bigger executes.
---
Heroic strike spam is literally pseudowarrior brainlet tier play.
---
My wife and I were able to 2 man it at level 26. Solo would require a lot higher.
---
I lost a bit of motivation when I hit level 30 on my alliance warrior, it feels like there is a bit of a dead zone for questing between 30-33. Any recommendations for levelling from 30-33 until I can effectively tackle SV?
---
Private server guilds speedrunning and specially built aoe groups skipping most of the content mean jack shit to me.
---
Still 5k ques on herod
---
Whirlwind axe. Nice. I'm working on the ingredients for it now. Any advice on killing the elite?
---
You are correct but are overlooking one mechanic: Heroic Strike, when it replaces your auto attack, gives you a *significantly* more favorable attack table, just by merit of being an ability. No glancing blows and if you are dual-wielding you also lose the dual-wield miss chance penalty. 
---
This still doesn't mean you should spam it, but it can come in handy to know this.
---
Honestly Stalagg ques have died down quite a lot. I think because its a weekend at most it was 3k and i got in within an hour and now I often log in to no queue
---
Then find a mage and pay them for their service, Mr. Moneybags!
---
I'm good with BC and Wrath.
---
The definition of "dead server" is exaggerated.
---
As Blizzard said: a medium pop server has more people on it today than the fullest servers of 2006.
---
I'm looking at the realm list now 8:40 PM EST Monday night and only three servers are "low." The rest are medium or more, which means virtually all of the servers are getting the complete Vanilla experience.
---
Lockpicking, you tend to pickpocket chests now and then with gems and potions in them
---
Ok comrade.
---
Just go to an RP server and you'll see.
---
If you are prot spec its a non issue. 
---
Sunders up on boss equal more dmg for rogues and other ap users.
---
Then higher lvls should protect their faction.
---
&gt; I didnt realise mana even regenerated during combat until I posted here
---
In case someone didn't mention it - it kicks in after 5 seconds of not casting anything so dumping all your DoTs and big spells at  once then wanding until mana is back up (set Shoot Wand to 1 or something you can reach easily) is the ideal.
---
The travesty that is retail wow was made one small decision at a time.
---
Horrible transformer clunky garbage,g403 is way better
---
For dungeons in sm ruin what is dot priority for targets. IE what dots to stop using when, and how many targets to just start on the aoe spell?
---
Even in the situation you described where everyone survives, as a tank I'd still find that draining. It's not fun feeling like you failed at your job, and when your job is to hold aggro and dps are constantly pulling you end up spending the whole dungeon feeling like a failure, even though you know it's probably their fault for not letting you build threat and attacking three different mobs at once. Telling me it's okay that I lost aggro will only help me feel like I'm not getting judged, it's not gonna help me feel like I'm doing a good job.
---
I'm a druid healer that has had to tank a handful of times because of the tank shortage and now I get why there's a tank shortage. Not holding dps accountable for pulling aggro isn't going to make it better.
---
is it worth it so you can actually play the game? hmmmm....
---
That second paragraph was one giant run-on sentence and you should feel bad.
---
No, just extra hits.
---
I flocked back this weekend. But only because Classic was DDoS‚Äôd.
---
Not sure if you count it as evidence but the wowhead article on stats lists the spirit regen by class as:
---
Druid (caster): Spirit/4.5 + 15
---
Druid (feral), Hunter, Paladin, Warlock: Spirit/5 + 15
---
Mage, Priest: Spirit/4 + 12.5
---
Shaman: Spirit/5 + 17
---
This meme is going places.
---
First
---
Oh snap I always forget about eagle eyes! I'm vanilla I only really used it in AV, never thought about using it for stuff like this. In fact I'll use this for finding mining nodes now. He is pretty basic looking, but he sure does look baller when he's smacking casters faster then the Fist of the North Star
---
No amount of looking for what you personally want is going to change the way people as a whole tend to play video games in 2019. You just have to deal with it, really. Why should people stop doing what *they* want, In order to conform to what someone else wants?
---
Besides, it's an mmo. To each their own as long as you're not breaking rules.
---
Great idea. As someone who's literally never used the f keys for anything ever, I'll try that
---
So drama in a game is bad, but drama on the internet is fine?
---
how long is it live for?
---
Can‚Äôt believe I went this far to see this posted. Be real people, the emotes get tiring very quickly.
---
If you want to maximize gold and xp/hr, then you should specifiy before a run gets started.  You shouldn't just assume that everyone wants to have that miserable experience.  I'm here to have fun, not please some sort of obsessive fantasy that a delusional neckbeard has.

What do you mean
---
Unfortunately I think most of the PvP servers are Horde dominated. 
---
I still recommend to roll Alliance to help balance the server and you should get shorter BG queues when those come in.
---
Love this... tanking as a warrior for the first time (tanked a bit previously as a paladin before) so this is enlightening.
---
This is the correct answer. Both need it, so both roll need.
---
Did you do the quests first? You can hit revered if you do the quests after the mob grind. I also completed the rep!
---
Hah?
---
You said you didn't know how you caught it, then immediately explained how you caught it. It's pretty though.
---
The only people who hate him more then the horde, are the spirit healers.
---
Take a hint. Get off our continent!
---
Former OG horde pvp server player: yes. Roll pve, horde or alliance are a million times more friendly. There are bad apples, but much less.
---
I'd kill for that healthstone macro!
---
I'm not sure and thats sort of my point. I don't really know what the consequences of changing this header are. Maybe other services check it? Like I was noticing that arch package libraries were 404ing during a system update today, but for updates that normally go off without a hitch.
---
My guild banned it from chat but there are 2 bank accounts if you message ‚Äúinv‚Äù to that toon, it will invite you to group then kick 10 seconds later. Also some servers, at least mine, Fairbanks has a Layer channel where users just post there but from the looks of it, Blizzard is doing something about layers soon.

This is his newly update guide he posted a couple days before launch.

Most people that knew what they were talking about never said classics content is "harder" per say. It's the Lack of QOL in classic that makes it "harder". Things like remembering to have an engineer in your raid with a field repair bot so you don't have to hearth and resummon during a raid.

It's a very nice bonus from about 20~40 when downtimes start creeping up and spirit is still widely available on gear you'll use but after 40 it becomes near-impossible to assemble a full set of spirit gear that's actually useful otherwise.
---
At that point just conjure rank 1. That is the ultimate F-Off since you went through the trouble to do it.
---
Are you guys all on PVE servers? Because Horde PVP is a trash fire.
---
Ill look for a partner
---
I read that one of the drops is from a dungeon boss, how did you manage that?
---
Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that thief over there
---
As Horde, I see nothing wrong here.
---
Druids: we're here too!
---
Yeah as other's have said, the Sunken temple class quests don't come out till phase 2.
---
No changes and all that, but it seems pretty stupid for them to release when they aren't relevant anymore.
---
This is the problem with WoW at about Cata and got worse with MoP and never really changed. It all looks like Disney. Like, Worgen look like Scar from the Lion King.
---
This is disingenuous. The people that are getting these clears practiced in coordinated efforts for months or possibly years before classic was released. Any video game becomes trivial when you rehearse it 500000 times. Find a fresh raid group of people who don't know each other and see how effective you are.
---
It's been almost two hours just tonight on Staalag
---
&gt; Non-private Speech (like /s or /y) should be in character
---
Never been on a RP server where this has been the case. In Moon Guard and Wyrmrest Accord for example, many people will speak out of character (or 'OOCly') in public chat. There's this notion about RP servers that you have to be in character all the time and it just isn't true.
---
Embrace the mole man. Become the mole man.
---
Yeah you definitely feel the difference. I was using a barrens cat and it slunds like they have less than 1.2 AS not sure exactly. The eye trick was something I got looking into have to find him.
---
There's a big difference between not holding them accountable and what I'm saying
---
Thank you for the feedback. I do use Lutris and I will keep this in mind if I run into any network issues. So far, so good.

I am not used to seeing good meme captions on this sub
---
I mix like half the flavor pack into eggs then scramble it. Then cook the noodles and drain all the water. Then throw the eggs and noodles into a frying pan. Boom. Fried eggy ramen noodles. Throw some hot sauce on that shit and you have a drunken tasty 4am dinner.
---
Yo, I appreciate this post a ton. I'm playing classic having never played wow before. I am really enjoying the game but the solo warrior grind has been a bit of a beat down at times. I'm gonna give this a shot next time I boot up.
---
Lmao is it really that damaging to you that you accidentally joined a group you don't conform to? Just leave and move on. It's not a big deal
---
You'll have to unlearn it completely first. Gnomish tends to have more gadgets and you'll consume a lot more bombs as Goblin, so best to start out Gnomish.
---
What I'm saying is that *content was nerfed throughout Vanilla and we get the massively nerfed end product*. Not that this is "nerfed Vanilla".
---
Most of the quests aren‚Äôt in the instance and it‚Äôs exceedingly difficult to find people who want to do it as it‚Äôs a big time sink for little reward
---
I‚Äôm using a bow, running with my owl Hedwig! Wishing I could use a wand!
---
Unless something explicitly says it effects your pet then you can assume it doesn't.
---
This includes item stats and buffs to your hunter
---
I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs kind of hard to admit anything since I quit mid-cata. Memory is a little foggy. I just remember feeling like wow became a game I wasn‚Äôt enjoying anymore. Then they came out with like another 5 expansions since then. 
---
All I know is that I‚Äôm glad vanilla is back. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Not because retail sucks, but because vanilla is the best.
---
Would you say Sunder Armor isn't as useful against clothie type mobs?  Let's say for example, the Dalaran mobs in Silverpine?
---
If it makes you feel better, PvP Alliance is also heavily alt-right.
---
You're complaining about BAU behavior in random pug groups since the beginning of MMOs.
---
If anything there's less of it in Classic than anywhere else because nobody wants to offside other players and have to find another player mid dungeon.
---
WoW has some seriously messed up stuff.
---
Just started playing hunter and I have no idea what melee weapons to look for. What am i supposed to get in my melee slot?
---
Your trying to make this too much of a "joke" there is no punchline man.   Like you either get what I meant or you dont.  And I dont particularly care if everyone gets it lol.  It wasnt offensive to anyone other then maybe a few dumb "parents" out there.  My intent was to simply make a some what funny comment on how this could turn into a ridiculously disasterous situation.  Sorry if it didnt land for you or others.  Again no offence was intended.
---
I've done a dozen or so dungeons as a tank, and I haven't run into any of this. People have been patient, even a bit scared, and we've gone as slowly as I like.
---
I think so, because it's also in the rppvp servers. For both factions. I've heard such people weren't in deviate delight, but I guess anything that says "PvP" invites sweaty tryhards.
---
I used to make my own with cooking. Bears in Felwood drop cookable high level meat.
---
RP servers are different from RP-PVP servers, its like Normal is just PvE and RP is a PvE server with RP.
---
Enabling PvE to PvP server transfers would lead to people leveling in normal servers and then switching to PvP servers at max. PvP to PvE however would be fine in my opinion.
---
No.... No. WoW retail looks like Pixar. Vanilla WoW looks more like oldschool art from the 70s and 80s.
---
If you look at his post history he believes DS3s hardest boss is Sister Friede, also enjoys League of Legends. 
---
Dont take this post too seriously.
---
Hunter damage scales well. It's their pets that don't.  Which is a large part of their damage.  So a 1% damage increase on a hunter only increases overall damage by 0.8% or so.
---
Honestly, just Need anything that is an Upgrade. So anything with + to spell dmg/Shadow DMG. You can use the Shadow weave set for awhile as well until you start farming BRD/LBRS. Wands are hit and miss, however you don‚Äôt wand as much once you get into the 40‚Äôs because Rank 4 DL is better DMG than wanding.
---
Nobody every said the mechanics were harder, ever. In fact just the other day I was telling my friend that there is almost nothing in classic wow, weather it's gear, pvp rank, or some achievement where I say man will you look at that guy he's probably really skilled at this game. No, everything in classic is obtained through simply time. There is little to no skill curve for attainable things in this game.
---
Sure you can learn a classes ins and outs and push an extra 20% dps in raids or play in pvp perfectly. But there is nothing that tells me this person has mad skills, even rank 14 and naxx, it's just a matter of how much time can you commit to it.

And never buy any salami that isn't either Hebrew National or a Chicago 57. I don't know why it is that no one else can produce salami quite as well as the Jewish tribe.

When you get faction rep, you get rep for the other three factions as well. I believe it's around 10% of what the primary gain is.

Brew, I feel ya. Lvl 39. 3 waters to get swifty.

What's your stitches/mor'ladim death ratio?
---
Succubus charm the hunter and Nuke the pet. Then keep hunter Feared, dotted, SF, GG. 
---
Or fear the pet and just work the hunter. 
---
Remember to Death Coil first since the fear will be hard to get off due to pushback.
---
He was literally asking for invites, what are you talking about?
---
Great? Of all fantasy universes, WoW rivals Warhammer 40k, a normal peasant either gets murdered by:

---
Murloc
---
Other humans
---
Elementals

---
Undead
---
Dragons
---
Etc.. 
---
That's only at the low level zones. Not mentioning if they are unlucky enough to unearth a soul sucking, mind slaving artifact in a farm. 
---
Yet we still love the damn thing. No regrets.
---
Im going this route too so I need to know!
---
First off, I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre acknowledging it.   Second,  everyone who said this would never work or be sustainable can frack off.
---
No he wasn‚Äôt... lol
---
You can't see anything underwater when swimming with your head above it.  Function over form for me, turned that down quick.
---
The funny part is when people on the pserver reddit get mad that i point out 1k pop is dead while people on these new servers with multiple thousands of people are also complaining.
---
He was using nothing of the sort.
---
Retail is still there for you
---
People wanted Classic.  Not Classic with changes.  Just Classic.
---
That was the whole point of even doing this.
---
Not First.
---
Trying to find a pug group for sm as a rogue is rough. Seems hard to get a spot unless you got aoe to blast through the content.
---
No trust me he was.
---
Ok, I will do that, I am aware of the hour wait. I usually send mail before work or sleep and im certain it just never arrives. Can a GM check this out you think?
---
1. No one expected the entire Vanilla experience from 1.0 launch to 1.12.  So you don't have an issue.
---
2.  There is no lifespan you need to worry about.  All they have to do is open new servers.  Or put in TBC.  Do whatever they want.  It doesn't matter.
---
You're just crying for the sake of crying, and you sound like you're butthurt people got to 60 before you did.
---
The weekend before classic launched, I started a priest on retail to burn time and reacquaint myself with the starting zone. I could pull eight mobs at a time with SW:P.  I have a priest in classic and can barely handle two at a time.
---
As a mage I know to wait for aggro to build before I starting burning things down, but while I wait I usually mark the next set of mobs to target. One less job to do after the current fight is over!
---
It‚Äôs also good to not really do anything after the pull to see if there‚Äôs a patrolling add that needs sheeping because the tank pulled at the wrong time.
---
The term dead long predates wow pservers. Welcome to the internet bud lol.
---
Saying "let people play how they want" isn't telling you how to play lol
---
Retail and private servers are the other way.
---
Ok. You can get right click reported for spamming and get auto silenced which was my point.
---
This.  Don‚Äôt offload it early.
---
Only the honorless require honor to go into battle. I slay dirty alliance scum all day long!
---
You can only train pets certain abilities if they use that ability in the wild. I.e charge skill is in my training tab but my bear cannot learn it but my boar can b cause he uses charge in the wild.
---
I still log into retail from time to time just to look at the guild roster sadly and reminisce lol. Sometimes I update the "message of the day" just in case anyone else does the same.
---
You are the one who chooses to invest energy in caring about the things you care about
---
there is a world outside of dungeons :-) ... get your 4 level there LUL
---
Passive and stay is the key. The stay command will root them in place, and passive will ensure that if you must fight, he won't attempt to join. He'll disappear when you get far enough. As for the group, just apologize and explain that you're new to the game, but do those two things in the future.
---
 Just hit 45 on my Paladin and decided to respec my talents to get 5/5 Reckoning among other things. However, when I went back to questing, it seemed like I wasn‚Äôt getting extra attacks while fighting mobs so I decided to test things out with a friend. I‚Äôm a bit of a noob, but my understanding of Reckoning is that it‚Äôs supposed to grant an extra attack, although what seems to be happening is in the midst of combat it‚Äôs merely resetting the swing timer instead. Am I misunderstanding how the talent works or have other Paladins noticed this behavior as well? Please note I‚Äôm aware that /sit is not supposed to proc reckoning and that is NOT what I was doing. Both combat log screenshots were taken standing with no other combat modifiers, and I saw the same behavior with different mobs.
---
Is there somewhere for alliance to get in on this festival?
---
Are these neutral NPCs?
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to ask blizz change classic so it‚Äôs no longer classic‚Äù
---
\- Hunters can tame whatever type of tamable pet they want.
---
\- If you stuff up the name, or decide to change it, you can.
---
\- Pet feeding has mechanical benefit.
---
\- Some types of pets, like wolves, can eat only meat, whilst others, like boars, can eat anything edible.
---
Letting people play how they want isn't kicking them from a dungeon group mid way for not having the spec you think they should have "lol".
---
Trust me, he wasn't.
---
I was heading to the shimmering flats to complete a mage quest when I spotted a group of five alliance waiting to do RFD. Upon seeing me they began running to my direction. I immediately cast slowfall and tried to make my escape off the great lift, no elevator style. I had about 20% hp by the time I hit the ground. One of the alliance jumped off with me. Hes buzzard food. The rest slowly descending the elevator. To my surprise a hunter 20 levels lower then me sees that I am at 20% and opens fire.. like really.. I boink ontop of him and give him the ol' nova cone of cold combo. Needless to say. Awesome night.
---
&gt;required talent when leveling
---
You mean. Playing warrior.
---
You mean because no one rolled Need? I saw that too.

It happens in early September to "honor fallen heroes of the Horde and Alliance". It's based off some real world harvest events around this same time.

---
I think the difference is that retail is overall just dramatically less dark. Light sources still light up areas.
---
Really not first
---
Feral is fine for dungeons
---
It drops from the first boss in RFK, who is off to the left. You can find guides online. We pulled one elite mob at a time, two at the most. Any more than that and we'd run out of the dungeon. It took some time, but we got it down.
---
You can only have 4 active (usable-- e.g. Growl, Cower, Bite, Claw) abilities on a pet.
---
warlocks just use the priest as their second mana pool
---
I‚Äôd expect so.
---
Well if my post wasn‚Äôt downvoted there are plenty of people that know of this.. listen to the count down to classic pod cast. Did you watch his. Stream?
---
There is an option, forget what it is, that you can see how much happiness the food gives, numerical wise. And need to give pet food you would use yourself to heal.
---
It does not, when I click it to teach it (the button is available for me to teach him) literally nothing happens
---
In the way that people mean it here though, dead being a feeling, having nothing to do with a specific population number. Usually meaning that a person played for an unspecified amount of time on a server and failed to fall ass backwards into a pile of friends and the engaging experience they read about other people having.
---
I would suggest the same. I went Elwynn -&gt; Westfall -&gt; Loch Modan -&gt; Westfall -&gt; Redrige Mountains. Plus, when you start going dungeons at around lvl 18 you get a ton of EP there.
---
Can somebody award me how I get one of these? I‚Äôm a newb
---
I mean if an old anime was being re-made and everyone said that the old anime sucked and no one would watch it, and its cult followers would realize how bad it is, then it would be acceptable to ask one of those cult followers "hey did you realize how bad that anime really is yet?"
---
I love it when you discover things like this in quest text.  Imagine how many hours people put into writing all these quests, books, etc. This is why I read them too (especially if I haven't done the quest).
---
They arent scared or stupid just because you cry on reddit about something.  They made it VERY CLEAR we were getting 1.12 vanilla. That's what we got. Dont let the door hit you on the way out.
---
This is probably the answer. To unlearn skills, go to a pet skill trainer.
---
Yup, you are more skilled because you play retail. Just like watching Rick and Morty gives you higher IQ. 
---
We dont play Classic to prove ourselves. We play to have fun.
---
It's even more fine if you're the one making the group.
---
I dont think politics had anything to do with it. I think some people here need to loosen up lol.
---
Honestly, if you‚Äôre a competent player, you could do either. I‚Äôd say 90% of Classic is just playing smart and actually THINKING about how to do dungeons and pulls. 
---
Don‚Äôt let tanking scare you. The only way to get better is to practice :)
---
Bear tank is awesome for dungeons. Cat is a bit meh but people don't care much about who dpses in your dungeons
---
What am I looking at?
---
There‚Äôs no add on that forces layer swapping. Stop trying to argue there is one when you‚Äôre literally asking if there is one available.
---
It's impossible to detect what layer someone is on aside from asking for random invites and seeing if you phase.
---
Why is every screenshot in this sub 230x200 pixels?
---
This makes no sense and screams of someone who thought this was going to be the golden age.  This is what classic was.  Now we know the flaws and have for a long time.  But back then, it was life as normal.  Embrace it for what it is and realize if it doesn‚Äôt suit you, you have the choice to go back to retail.
---
You need to play the lottery, today.

---
I mean, showing up to raid every night is considered good in Vanilla.
---
Nobody is gonna have a raid solely consisting of Warriors, Priests, Mages, and Rogues. It's not feasible, and you have 40 fuckin slots to fill. This kinda mentality only makes sense in modern WoW, where spots are more limited and spec competitiveness defines Mythic raid teams. Raiding p much all the way through WotlK was more like Pok√©mon, in that you tried to collect all the buffs and debuffs you could get to maximize raidwide damage.
---
Also, Druids just straight up were better raid healers. There's a great build utilizing Regrowth and Nature's Grace that is able to keep powerful HotS up across the raid.
---
You are correct, but charge + white swing gives enough rage for 2 heroic strikes. Weave in Bloodrage and you have very little downtime. 
---
My biggest issue with rage is missed swings, which will happen regardless. Imp charge and Imp HS also help with rage efficiency. They may not be great endgame talents, but they're fine for leveling.
---
If you can kill enemies in 3-5 GCD, sunder is a poor use of rage.
---
Transfer right away.  The current pops are based on max server capacity with layering.  You won't regret the swap.
---
Most of your income is from vendoring gear and quest gold, not from endlessly farming shitty greys.
---
Just level.
---
You‚Äôre lying about being kicked and sitting back in queue. There is a DC buffer in place that allows instant access back to the realm you were just on with in a certain window.
---
That is already happening - spread over 5 characters, same as with gold.
---
 King Varian Wrynn, went out drinking with him and hasn't been seen since.
---
Does retail seriously not have weather affects?
---
Rage intensifies *
---
Has nothing to do with increasing TTL, 64 is just recommended default value. Windows use 128 and other systems use the max value of 255.
---
Its been two weeks man.
---
Well, it's not really used in fury builds as there is little reason to stance dance as fury.
---
I loved Wildstar except for two things:
---
* Timed medals in dungeons, was impossible to do pugs since people would leave after it was impossible to complete the dungeon with a gold medal.
---
* Insane difficulty in raid attunement quests, like "complete all dungeons with a gold medal".
---
Wish they would have fixed these two things and merged servers sooner. It would probably have kept a lot of players around long enough to get sustainable growth.
---
Enhance to 40, then elemental is pretty viable from then on. At 60 for pvp, enhancement can be fun for the RNG one shots, but honestly ele/restore is just better and extremely fun to play.
---
no
---
You can definitely do bfd at 27, and sfk.  RFK would be the one I think is a lil low
---
Will do thanks
---
You make healthstones when you have excess mana. It doesn't cost that much. And just let mp5 regen it
---
I was afk kicked while studying for a test. I‚Äôm not lying, I just didn‚Äôt see the dc/kick until after it had been a while. 
---
Why would I lie? I specifically said I‚Äôm not mad either, but at this time of night I‚Äôd be in bed by the time I wait out the queue. I‚Äôm just looking for an alt server to play on to pass time when I can‚Äôt wait out the queue.
---
So they should just take anyone and everyone even though their goal is to be specific? Bro you're confused as fuck. There are plenty of other options for you if your spec is not what they want.
---
No in saying if you could just buy a 5x XP subscription.
---
Your problem is you are too obsessed with how everyone else is playing the game instead of just  caring about how you play it. Who cares about the leveling meta that all these streamers and guides are saying is optimal. They dont affect you one bit; you can still do dungeons in regular groups, still quest however you want. Just worry about your own playing and not anyone else's. Classics lifespan will be fine, the majority of the player base is not going to ever get to a point where they have cleared everything and have BiS gear and nothing to do til the next phase.
---
It's been confirmed the portal in the login screen is of the Outlands.
---
Not eye damage.  Blue light triggers you to think it is morning
---
There is no addon for layer swapping. It‚Äôs not possible to tell what layer you‚Äôre on.
---
Moo usually works for me.
---
What dungeon is that?
---
I've been leveling a priest, put 5 points into wand spec, 5 into spirit tap, and I've been throwing the rest into holy (I'm only level 23, so 4 points into crit chance on heals).
---
I'm noticing how painful it is to quest with this, but I'd still like to heal for dungeons. My healing is so OP right now it's borderline brainless (Heal can basically heal a similarly-leveled tank for half their health almost, with a crit bringing them to full life at even like 10%), so I've just been SW:Pain targets and throwing wand damage out while watching health.
---
Should I respec and go hard into Shadow instead, will heals still be fine for dungeons? I can't take how painful questing is, even though it's only really 'started', it's gotta get worse from here. Am I fine to keep those 4 points in holy as a 'mistake' and just start going down the shadow path to save the gold?
---
Also, I've been going pretty hard for spirit gear over intellect. Will this hurt my dps significantly if I DPS a dungeon instead of healing?
---
So many mages camping the popular area. Don‚Äôt think they realize that it‚Äôs only really effective if you have no competition for all the spawns.  Questing would be faster if they are competing with 2+ other mages.

Tis a wound from which he may never recover.
---
Every time you run a dungeon as Feral, chat to the main healer afterwards, and put them on your friends list.
---
As you go up to 60, you'll have a roster of healers ... and 'Tank and healer looking for 3 dps' gets all the five mans, all the time.
---
ü§î
---
Ill take me some timeüòÖ
---
It's not a legitimate concern to me and to most of the people here.  You are not the center of my world.
---
I never played it when it first came out but my friend convinced me to get WoW classic and honestly the first like 15 levels were pretty boring. I can really only play on the weekends between work and balancing time with family and friends but man the game is starting to get fun. I‚Äôm only level 18 but it‚Äôs a ton of fun. We just ran dead mines for the first time so that‚Äôs the first dungeon I‚Äôve ever done and from my understanding it‚Äôs really simple but it was great! I can‚Äôt wait until we get higher level and move into contested area and start getting into open world PVP and bigger dungeons. Super fun game even if we only play for a few hours at a time on weekends!
---
I have no idea how you managed to miss the point of 4 different comments
---
I do! I'll take a look at that. Thank you
---
Right !?!  My old pic was a workhorse for real.  And that was on ultra low.  My laptop now blasts classic at full and it‚Äôs amazing.  Never looked this way before.
---
Have you thought that maybe these people on the rp servers that don‚Äôt have rp names don‚Äôt have them because they are only there to play with friends?
---
Blessing of Wisdom on my mage is literally a blessing. Never stop.
---
To visit the dump?
---
Use highest rank Frostbolt
---
That's a weird way to spell commitment, but yes.
---
Wait, it drops a mount? The lvl 40 instance??
---
That's a fast smoke break. That screen is only up for me for about five seconds.
---
Oh I got the point:  "Waaah, someone hit 60 before me so that means the game is too easy--even though I'm not 60, it's too easy and should be changed!"
---
I will be getting a LFG addon today, that is for reminding me of it!
---
I, for one, would love a remake of Ocarina of Time, except I want to be able to play as Dante from Devil May Cry.  And I'd like there to be microtransactions so I can buy the Infinity Gauntlet.
---
While not everyone on a PVP server is a selfish dickhead, selfish dickheads do want to do ganking, and therefore they tend to be on PvP servers.
---
People have more than 1  character?
---
So do you recommend the hamstring method while levelling? Does it even work in Classic? I'm having some mixed results with it...
---
Make your DPS wait about four seconds.
---
This will be a constant struggle.
---
As long as you are not playing Alliance because their dances are dumb.
---
Lol @ playing on full-size keyboards
---
iirc it is one or the other
---
Yeah layering needs to be removed
---
DPS aren‚Äôt used to waiting for the Tank to get aggro they open up right away. On Retail the aggro mechanics are so different that it‚Äôs not hard for a tank, Classic is back to old school. 
---
I tell the DPS to count to 3 before opening up
---
One thing I‚Äôve been doing isrewatching the shows I use to watch during Vanilla through Wrath, this post reminded me to add BSG to the list. Thanks!
---
People are underestimating hunter dps a lot on this sub because they are weak in naxx.
---
Truth is, hunters are near top dps in MC, and they are above casters in BWL. After that they are buttom dps though. So yes they can do just fine. The problem is raid spots though, you only really want 3-4 hunters in mc/bwl then down to 2 in AQ. And a lot of people roll hunter because they are low effort. But as a dedicated hunter you shouldn't have any issues honestly. You will find a guild once you have proper gear, and when you show your effort they will keep you for aq/naxx while the other slackers lose their raidspot.
---
Could we add in a mine car level with some laser sharks?  Possibly it could involve a timed race.
---
Fewer\*!
---
I got two new swords in dead mines with the blue  leather chest. I feel like a king. 
---
The group I came across were a guild and I joined them too! Was fun.
---
It's the pacing. You don't have a mount. You slow down and take in the scenery, appreciate the questing hubs, the inns - because you may not see one for another couple hours. Because you now value the travel time it takes to get from place to place.
---
I am just going to keep posting phone pictures because I dont actually know how to use technology nor do I care to learn. I can just say That I wanted to "make a quick post".

They will hate you
---
You were way ahead of the curve then i guess.
---
I didnt even hear the word "spell cleave" untill i started playing again in Legion (after having raided up to four horsemen in Naxx)
---
I have enough spirit that I very rarely need to eat or bandage. Waiting a few seconds brings me back to full hp. I'm actually probably got a bit too much spirit, some extra strength would help.
---
Don't play on PVP servers. Simples.
---
This argument doesn't make sense because you're not spending the rage on anything else meaningful pre 36.
---
You use rank 1 when you want a low mana cost ranged slow.
---
Anyone with a modern nvidia gpu can use the new filter option to disable the gui. Also great for making the game 10000x clearer and less washed out. Takes the fog on everything away. While making actually foggy arias supper pretty, wet lands look great, and feel muggy when the fog rolls in.
---
Haha.  I love BSG.  Glad I could help !
---
If you're not worried about the 1%... why would they need to rush phases?  The average player of the majority is probably only in the 30s after 2 weeks.  As the second half to 60 will take longer... that will be about 2 full months before the majority can even enter the raids.  Add to that these people probably don't have years of practice on pservers, and people will have to progress and learn these fights.  Why rush phases for the 1%?  Did your guild down everything already?  Im going to assume not, come back after you have and post again how easy it was for you at that point and you'll have something to back up your claim at least.  It should be next week at the latest because it's so easy.  I'll be looking for that post.
---
Got helm, axe and shoulder in 3 runs. Its possible brother.
---
so i should have both rank 1 and latest rank on my bars? my bars are getting filled up man, i mean my keybinds options are getting short
---
I knew about this but when did they change the name? Back in actual classic or for the re release of classic?
---
Updoot
---
I tried that irl, can confirm people don‚Äôt take too kindly to it.
---
I never got to play WotLK. Was there ever a quest or something that explained why it was transported to northrend?
---
I have never understood this attitude. I have levelled warriors multiple times as arms, dual wield fury,and 2h fury, there really isn't a huge difference. 2H feels more bursty but inconsistent, dual wield is more consistent and doesn't just delete mobs if you get a few crits. That's really it, it's really not that different in speed.
---
Burning Crusade was the best expansion IMO
---
Tell him to solo. As a Hunter, he's effectively his own 2-man group. You AOEing kinda disenfranchises his ability to play his class effectively.
---
I didn't subscribe to see something like this...
---
I literally was going to do the same thing for Stormpike's Delivery but I didn't know where Loch Modan was so I googled it and then realized there was a Tram.. Bit sad that I put off that quest now for so long lol.
---
I detect a +2 WoW Justice Warrior.

---
Saving throw for Sanity. Rolls 12. Safe.
---
So it's not really unreasonable for me to ask for them to wait, watch and CC stuff that aggros, etc?
---
Yes, only a tiny fraction of the playerbase experienced naxx in its original state, but on private servers players are speedrunning naxx.
---
Tell him at 40 his pet gets super strong and can destroy people, oh and a mount!

First to get downvoted

Roll em out faster the onto TBC!

I tried this yesterday, but my buddy could not see it in my hand, it was in my hand on my screen but empty on his:(
---
Jokerd
---
Thanks
---
Had this same experience with a hunter and Druid killing the elites in Stromguard. The ogre boss with the triple shaman spawn would been impossible with just my feral friend and I, but a nearby alliance hunter and druid were looking to do it as well.
---
We took turns tagging and helping clear since nobody else was around there at the time.
---
I‚Äôm okay with live and let live while we both obviously have better stuff to do with our time than have multiple death runs back to our bodies.
---
Your a mage... you can make that by literally sitting afk in town porting. You a cheap‚Äôo lol
---
Bear is great, cat kinda sucks‚Äîbut it‚Äôs fine for soloing. Tanks are more rare than dps.
---
haven't played on the other side yet so I have no idea.
---
Not really interested in raiding or dungeons as ele, i will be healing instead.
---
More curious about the viability for pvp and questing, so its good for pvp but for questing am i going to be spending an extortionate amount of gold on water?
---
So should i be going for gear with the most int and +sp despite it being cloth gear?
---
Kinda concerned that as an ele sham in full cloth with a staff i will get destroyed in world pvp very easily...but i can't see any mail caster gear on dungeon drop lists from level 40
---
Except priests are like top tier levelers lol
---

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d20fnc/how_long_do_people_plan_on_sticking_around/).

Alliance at 22. In ashenvale currently and it's heavy horde.
---
as can be expected from anyone using a special character in their name
---
Does he know 4 skills already
---
Can agree it is super boring, mind numbing. 25\~ hours in Blackrock dungeons over the weekend was an experience I don't want to repeat.
---
But at the end of the day, most of us have done the content dozens of times at this point, we'll take the fastest possible route available.
---
LOL so dramatic "thats how hated you are", really sounds like a teen-aged angsty girl.  I had someone try to curse me out on a mythic run but she couldn't even type it in normal English, it was in gamer gurl speech. It would have been easier to understand gutterspeak than her rambling. If classic is anything like it used to be, there will be groups/guilds of these types of tools. But once you make a reputation for yourself on that server you will always find chill groups/ guilds that will form pick up groups with you in a heartbeat. Good luck.
---
Bro! This made me laugh harder than it should
---
A beast mastery hunter can solo single pulls all day with very little trouble and do most orange quests by themselves. If he's BM and still having trouble, perhaps it is his playstyle. At 40 they get mail gear so there will be a larger contribution to their pet's defensive stats.
---
This angle is very CalebCity...
---
There's an addon I miss so much ... the Alamo druid addon.  Cat druid iz 4 fite! Wonder if someone with addon knowledge could resurrect that beauty ^.^
---
You don't have to, that's just what people use it for.  You could do a macro that casts fb and casts r1fb if you use a modifier.  It would go something like:
---
/cast [mod:shift] frost bolt(rank 1); [nomod] frost bolt
---
If that's not exact, open up the /macro panel, open up the spell book, type in:
---
/cast [mod:shift]
---
Then shift+click the rank 1 frostbolt, and I think it will auto-fill it in the macro, then do the rest.
---
Tired of sitting around waiting for what? Just go play the game.
---
Is there any specific reason not to have special characters in your character name?
---
For example T√∂ady instead of Toady?
---
Most people can whisper you by clicking your name and stuff...
---
 I'm just not sure if it will cause problems down the road?
---
Hunters are way more dynamic then mages and out dps then pre-bwl.
---
Hunters are one of the easier classes to level. But if he's totally new to the game there's nothing harm in him trying out a bunch of classes and seeing which one actually appeals. Or it may be that he needs less struggle and more gratification than Classic offers. Or, just needs to learn to enjoy the bits he's enjoying (the world etc. and not worry about being the number one dps/elite/etc.
---
You use rank 1 to slow enemies. Use rank1 fireball on rogues to dot quick and keep them from stealthing
---
hardest boss is Gael but Friede easily ranks 2nd , doubt you've even played the game to make a such post
---
Wait till you figure out you can queue up a cleave and while waiting for the melee swing you smack off a whirlwind.... The damage that comes out of that combo is insane
---
We have to go deeper
---
You can heal as shadow. Respec asap
---
N I C E
---
Who mentioned anything other than dungeons?? I‚Äôm confused by you. 
---
And yes. You‚Äôre right. Healers are supposed to keep everyone alive. So when someone starts up with this ‚ÄúI let them die‚Äù bullshit  you should call them out. It really sounds like you agree with me.
---
Looking at these comments this is the most misunderstood post I think I've ever seen
---
OP are you dead yet?
---
No, I know exactly what a distribute  Denial of service attack is. 
---
Any decent server farm has protection against that. Cloudflare.
---
Im on EU zandalari tribe rppvp and there is friendliness everywhere. 
---
Got a 38 shaman and 41 hunter atm and seen about 4 dirtbags that intentionally tried to ruin my day all together. 
---
Getting buffs left and right. Finding people to do group quests with and do prequals of quests if i didnt do them yet. 
---
Gotten a piece of armor or 2 and some elixers for helping people out. Same goes for my friends too and we do the same back.
---
Yep, everything except the lost whelp. Mine dropped off a flamesnorting whelp the other day.
---
Midir is easy as fuck compared to Friede or Gael, the only thing about him is that the first few tries give you the impression he's much harder but nope, really easy once you learned his moveset
---
Once layering is removed soon. They are the same.
---
Kind of like D2 dialog vs D3.
---
you have no idea how much easier leveling as dual wield fury is then rofl
---
Not the one who said it, but most people mean the Republicans who say the quiet part out loud. I.E., no dogwhistles, etc. Just white supremacy and a lot of misogyny. But you can be a misogynist anywhere on the political spectrum--so mostly white supremacists.
---
Good to know.  I always assumed it worked the first way.  Thanks for the info.
---
Man I will never level a warrior
---
Oh that's definitely an issue, but more warlocks know to avoid that because it's a lot more obvious how they're causing problems.
---
yes, and yes saying it in the dumbest way possible.
---
No he doesn‚Äôt.  Recklessness increases pressure on the healer by causing the tank to take more damage.  
---
If the issue is ‚Äúhealers mana‚Äù then that curse isn‚Äôt helping either.  
---
Weakness also reduces armor and attack power.  
---
Warlocks need to know who to use what curse on and it doesn‚Äôt matter one way or the other what they use when it comes to mana efficiency because throwing any curse plus dots is using up their mana.  
---
Affliction locks shouldn‚Äôt be spamming bolts.  They should have nightfall and use their bolt when it procs.  
---
Affliction locks should also be healing themselves up after life tapping with the help of their dot and channel.  
---
They should also not be life tapping an entire pool of mana.
---
ElvUI, default
---
Van Cleef?
---
if you constantly dungeon go like this till like 33-35 then respec full shadow no disc. you want shadow form asap
---
Last of the not first
---
Lemme give you some tips. Lets say you have a 3 pack that you're pulling.
---
# Recommendation
---
    Press V to turn on Nameplates
---
|Addon|Why I use it|
---
|:-|:-|
---
| [NeatPlates](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/neatplates)  |I use this for coloring  the plates based on threat. It also adds the debuff above the nameplate. This allows me to quickly see mobs that I've lost threat on and allows me to select and taunt it back.|
---
# My "general" rotation
---
1. Charge in or Ranged pull to you and switch to defense stance
---
2. I first hit demo shout so I can hit all of the surrounding mobs with threat
---
3. Tab &gt; Sunder
---
4. Press Revenge on a mob when it procs to bolster threat on that mob
---
5. Use Shield Block to force revenge to proc so you can generate a lot of threat on a mob.
---
# Edge Cases
---
* If a caster is casting a heal spell or CC spell, interrupt with a shield bash.
---
* If a mob is potentially going to do a lot of damage, I'll disarm them if I can see their weapon. 
---
# Keybinds
---
* I bind F1, F2, F3 to my different stances. (By default they are CTRL+F1, CTRL+F2, CTRL+F3)
---
* I put Taunt (in Defense) and Mocking Blow (in Battle) on the same Key
---
   * This allows me (while tanking) to Press 6 and then F1 and 6 on a different mob.
---
# Pro Tip
---
* When you pull the mobs and group them up, have the backs of the mob facing your group.
---
* Mark the mobs to establish kill priority and CC.
---
# Things that can help your WC run be smoother
---
* Line-Of-Sight the casters
---
   * Shield bash their "Sleep" spell
---
   * In a pack, prioritize them near the top
---
* Always pull the raptors back to you - they "call for help" which can have adds suddenly coming to their aid...
---
* Bring a shaman for tremor totem. It breaks the sleep they do.
---
* Know that the plant boss near the end hits like a truck.
---
* When you first get in there, you can "/target Lady" to target Lady Anacondra so you can mark her with Raid icons (skull, etc..) so you know where she spawns.
---
I hope this helps!
---
ElvUI
---
My mate has been dicking around he had 2 days played at 28. 
---
He is now at 8 days ingame and only lvl 33.
---
Be honest with them. Tell them that you don't appreciate the atmosphere, and you have intentions of going pve. Battlegrounds will be around in a few months.
---
Oh for sure.  I didn't know you were talking elite quests since you just said they join you for quests and not specifically group/elite quests.  No argument there lol
---
Hi, /u/savenickinc
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d20mlv/all_i_want_to_do_is_sell_my_gold_on_my_old/). 
---
But then you can have the most fun with the names!
---
Wonder what all these posts about the great community people are experiencing are on about since you say it's missing.
---
I always group with other warriors and split the charms. It's still relatively fast compared to doing to solo at that level. I usually just buy the charms though and pay a higher level 1g to kill cyclonian for the group
---
Just reroll man, 16 hours is nothing in the grand scope of things.
---
I mean it also has best melee DPS of the weapons I have atm, but yeah I could've said that it's purely meant for it lol
---
Yeah those are pvp related. The last one i forget to mention was r1 fireball to keep a rogue dotted so they can't vanish, but again, isnt critical.
---
The only spells i downrank in pve are nova and rarely blizzard/cone to snare a loose mob chasing the healer or something.
---
Oh my lort cuhmon
---
I used this thing called Google, and found QuickLayer.  It‚Äôs on curse. 
---
I‚Äôm only recommending you get this, so you can see what a waste of time it is trying to find another layer.
---
&gt; I don't think we asked for it
---
People absolutely asked for it.  "Why don't I have movement speed, why don't I have a CC, why don't I have raid utility."
---
Lol???
---
The tank is focusing his threat in the kill target.  At low levels, they are rage starved and maybe get to do one ability every few seconds.  They get rage by taking damage.  Dps who pull off the extra adds are taking rage generation away from the tank because they are not getting hit anymore.
---
If you're going to aoe and  you dont know the tanks ability, wait for 60% health of the pack before you start aoe.
---
You'll basically need to roll against casters to get the gear you want.  At 60, mail spell dps pieces are still few and far between, meaning you'll have to roll on cloth and leather.  At level 40, I would go for a healthy pool of int (like 3k mana) before going into +nature gear.  Elemental shaman are well known for going oom very quickly.  The only piece of mail I can think of is the chest piece from RFD, which give you mostly +spirit with a bit of int and stam.     
---
So yeah.. you're going to have to look for +int weapons and armor that is preferably mail, but make sacrifices if the item is leather or cloth.  Roll on staves against casters as they are as good for you as well as them.    
---
I would just make sure you let the group know beforehand that you're elemental and will roll on caster gear, so there isn't confusion.
---
The elite quests in loch modan are calling your name
---
Yeah welcome to the club, pal
---
These are so amazing! I hope you keep it up.
---
Also reminder for myself since I might want a commission in the future...
---
Yo, don't heal the warlocks, we good. We've been doing this the whole time. I don't even want water or mana potions. A renew is like EXACTLY what I want. My class regenerates health quickly, hit me with that ez mana. (this changes after 60)
---
A healer will choose to let the DPS die if they are pushing the tempo faster than the group can handle, or more specifically, stepping on the tank and Not letting him do **his job**. They can do this as a form of discipline. And it's not even always out of ill-will, sometimes that healer literally can't heal when they have no mana. So Yes, ofcourse I 100% agree with letting a dps in your group die if they are too stubborn enough to know their job.
---
###Why don't you get that?###
---
If the dps is literally pulling mobs when neither the tank or healer are ready, they deserve to die because they need to understand *THEIR ROLE*, and unfortunately, sometimes that is the only way for a healer to get their point across to someone so thick skulled who cant understand a healer can't keep up with someone who is too damn impatient.
---
Completely justified in asking them to wait until you have threat before they start attacking. I‚Äôm a priest and  the last few days I‚Äôve had to tell multiple DPS to relax so the tank can successfully pull and my healing isn‚Äôt split. Remember if everyone is properly doing their job, their job is easier to do.
---
My favourite part is where you forgot that Bloodlust drums existed right from BC when Bloodlust was added.
---
Utility homogenisation really isn't a big deal. So instead of absolutely requiring a Shaman, I can get by with a Mage or a Hunter rolling a Ferocity pet instead. As far as I see it that's a damn good thing. It's still only available to 3 classes and it means we aren't utterly screwed if we don't have a Shaman specifically. Maybe you should instead point out the flaws in the class design philosophy of having several specs in the game being utterly useless from a throughput perspective and only being brought to raid due to their spec holding a particular unique utility hostage.
---
In terms of core gameplay i.e. the part that matters the modern game is more diverse.
---
‚ÄúMom said it‚Äôs my turn with the corpse.‚Äù
---
They are the same people who complain about not having 100g at 40.
---
Ya it's impossible to hold aggro when the dps opens up with aoe right away. As the tank you kinda have to tell them to chill out, it's part of the role really.also try using a 2 hander for smaller pulls in dstance I find it holds aggro and generates rage a bit better. If things get hairy just swap to a shield and 1hander.
---
That is Frost Shock
---
But it's our dump.
---
Time to play "which feed is legal?"
---
Wirts Third Leg!
---
Shamans at low levels are so scary. Out of nowhere they'll turn into god's of wind and frost and fire and you're dead with a face filled with maces
---
I thought slam is a decent move if you use it directly after an auto attack and can easily AA, Slam, AA
---
Using lesser heal is not worth it. I'd rather let the 5 second rule kick in while I cancel cast a more efficient Heal.
---
Super first
---
Why are you confused.
---
One literally made you do the EXACT same quest over and over while another (which is debatable) simply is part of the game.
---
Dailies are the laziest shit from a game design perspective ever.
---
Haven‚Äôt played in 9 years.  I decided to start Lock when I came back... I‚Äôm level 16 and I *love* it.  Can‚Äôt wait for more.  Keep inspiring me :)
---
I just got out of a DM PUG with a few guys. We were having trouble finding a tank, so I messaged a nearby lvl 16 pally to see if he'd tank for us. He was cautious but accepted. Everyone else was between 19 and 24...
---
That little pally stole the show. He was the most responsible and considerate tank I've had since classic went live. He took way less damage than he had any right to, and held aggro on plenty of stuff while our frost mage blew aoe cooldowns. We didn't wipe, nobody died, and our healer never ran out of mana trying to keep his little butt alive. 
---
... And he lost connection randomly on the pier. We waited and shot the shit, told jokes and hung out for over half an hour, waiting for him to come back. Eventually we decided to finish the run without him, while discussing putting together a clan to keep the spirit of our group alive, and to run together in the future.
---
Our healer died on VanCleef, but had a soulstone. - no wipe, no tank. We skipped cookie. Now we have a guild named Ronery because someone started singing it along the way. I really hope we get to play with our pally buddy again.
---
THIS is why I love classic. I love dungeons and raids. The content is fun, but it's SO much better with a group you enjoy playing with.
---
On the other hand with more of a server community you're going to know who has skills by actually...knowing them. You won't need some arena rating to tell you if someone is really good at PvP, instead you fight with/against them a lot and find out that way.
---
EQ 1999 is releasing a new server soon if you care to play actual EQ, it comes out in October.
---
Cool. Good shit. :)
---
How do you use a "bank-alt"? Do you just send mail from your mail to your alt?
---
Do i need fire blast as a deep frost pvp build
---
*cough* Fozruk *cough*
---
I did that on a private realm I doubt for a repeat but I am hopeful!
---
So not this entire expansion? Weird thing to do on a classic server....
---
sadly it doesn't, but it can still be good when opponent charges to melee
---
I just wish there was a way to dial this effect up. Campfires, fires, and lamps should all be lighting up more of the environment than they do. Still, I love seeing it regardless.
---
What axe is that? Looks dope af
---
"I love you taC"
---
Same thing happens in Searing Gorge. There's a quest in Loch modan to unlock the key to the Searing Gorge, where a guard asks you to bring her the gigantic horn of a thunder lizard. So you go slay it, bring the horn, and she immediately goes "That's fake, it'd still have my axe embedded in my horn if it was real. And be five times as big." So she sends you to Ironforge to get it verified by the historians/archaeologists and he basically just goes "She's nuts, she must be envious that you did what she couldn't" and he puts the horn on display at the museum while giving you a certificate of authenticity to hand to the NPC, that then gives you the key after.
---
We have lol. He says himself he'd rather DPS so he can sit there and afk while playing his guitar. He's a good musician, but dammit we're playing a game here. 
---
Thankfully all our schedules are different so we're all going at our own pace now. He ultimately went to level a hunter lol. Figured if anything once I get BiS for my rogue I'll make a gathering alt and have it be a healer. Prob just dungeon spam with his tank once around his level.
---
This isn't helping me get to level 60 any faster but I'm not sure I mind right now rofl
---
The great thing about shaman world pvp is that you have several methods of escape. Ele is super strong and ‚Äúcan‚Äù one shot players, but that‚Äôs at high sp/Crit lvls.   
---
   
---
As for leveling, you want to stack as much int as possible due to the mana issues. Armor rating is not all that noticeable at low lvl pvp and entry level 60 pvp. Once 60 though, you can pretty much farm the same gear that a mage will be using, as it has the Crit/sp on it that you‚Äôre looking for. There isn‚Äôt much sp gear until the late 50s, and also avoid ALL +nature damage. It may look enticing but nature damage has a -60% coefficient for some odd reason just like ‚Äú+holy‚Äù does.
---
Yea, to hell with being able to cross the continent or an ocean in a few hours, safely, because of a few bumps...
---
This is a quick way to get yourself blacklisted from guilds and groups.
---
This quality hurts my eyes.  
---
I can't believe this was recorded in 2019.
---
&gt;.#showtooltip Heroic Strike ./cast Heroic Strike ./start attack
---
These don't seem to be working ;x
---
Roll PvE if you don‚Äôt want pure idiots, I personally eat all that shit up.
---
This is my 31 warrior flying past Ironforge, heading towards South Shore to do some questing because screw STV!
---
I've had very little luck with it. Often there are too many mobs nearby and they seem to have a pretty far reach. Plus at 30, pulling 2+ mobs is doable and makes kiting pretty null.
---
Wow! I never knew that. Thanks for sharing that information.
---
What expensive as computer do I need to buy to play this game!
---
That add on is wack
---
I think I'll just wait for it to be cleared on the day of release.
---
Angry people want you to know how powerful they are.  
---
Loving people want you to know how powerful YOU are.  
---
Chief Red Eagle.
---
The classic magic is back, which is a setting where team mind is built, the individual player levels up as their character gains XP and abilities, to teach the noobs.
---
I‚Äôll give you a classic quote (no pun intended). If the tank dies, it‚Äôs the healers fault. If the healer dies, it‚Äôs the tanks fault. If the DPS dies, it‚Äôs their own damn fault.
---
Hold up. I'm not disagreeing that heroic strike is bad, and should almost never be used once you get your replacement. The problem is you have absolutely nothing else before lvl 40 to completely replace it. Yeah, sunder armor is good for all the reasons you listed, but when you're straight up solo grinding mobs 1-2 lvls lower than you; you want to kill them as fast as possible and move onto the next one. When you're grinding and throttling your rage, you want to dump it on something that will quickly kill the mob so you can start hp regen and move to the next mob.
---
The face on that guy is terrifyingly at ease lol.
---
I'd tap that..
---
Yeah, that's what I was going for. But, hey... accidental double meaning; I'll take that one, lol!
---
So, a little math on the subject:
---
My fairly typical warrior has just hit level 32 using Corpsemaker and I have not yet trained HS, but have it talented. With 363 AP self-buffed my damage is 196-243, or 219.5 average. Heroic Strike will deal 263.5 average, an increase of 20%.
---
I'm not sure exactly how much armor monsters have, so I'll guess that a level 32 mob has 1k armor which is about what a warrior in green mail has. 3 stacks of Sunder Armor rank 2 will increase damage by 15%, dropping the damage reduction from 24.27% to 12.85%. You'll also be generating 15% more rage from your white hits (maybe ~10% more overall).
---
With no sunders, white hits will average 166.2 and generate 10.4 rage. HS will average 199.4 and effectively cost 22.4 rage. Thanks to damage taken and passive rage, you will be able to HS about every other hit and deal about 110% of white damage on average. You can also see that your first 45 rage (3 stacks of Sunder Armor) is only 2 swings of HS. Once you stack this you are multiplying *all* your damage and when you alternate HS from that point you will be dealing 126.5% of white DPS.
---
The simple crossover point then, is about when you can stack 3 sunders on a mob before it hits ~60% HP. If it won't live that long, don't bother. It's true that HS is important for avoiding glancing blows, but if you are fighting mobs that are +3 or +4 above you, they will definitely be living long enough that you should sunder them up. Also stop doing that, it's really inefficient and more frustrating than it needs to be. It also prevents you from doing what's REALLY more efficient by this level, pulling two mobs together and using Cleave / Sweeping Strikes.
---
Shout out to r/MLBStreams and r/NFLStreams
---
As nice as this post is, we are definitely not playing this the same way we did 15 years ago. People did not do AoE spellcleave groups in dungeons back then like we are now.
---
They dont generate more threat per damage but you build threat on multiple mobs while the tank can only build threat on one mob at a time, so the tank is focusing one mob to cover dps aggro but just hitting the others every couple rotations to cover healer aggro. So when you aoe he cant spread enough threat fast enough to cover it. 
---
You can try communicating for the tank to use cleave/swipe more so you can but unless you're whole group is doing it it's not really worth it. Or try waiting until the first target gets low then use aoe until it's dead, a tank should have enough threat on the other mobs after a couple rotations to cover you. But still it's usually better to just single target burn.
---
Salv is the 'one true best buff', but Kings is absolutely the best buff for everyone after salv.
---
You also can't have a name of a person publicly known, past or present, unfortunately.
---
I don't understand, why didn't you use your phone?
---
People speak out of character in /s and /y all the time on these realms. What RP server do you play on where this isn't the case, out of curiosity? It's not really frowned upon and it isn't against the rules to do so either.
---
Please send help.... stuck in orgrimar.... blink twice so I know its you^u^u^u^u
---
A new timeline in a vanilla way! Flying, lfg, free epics all that garbage can go to hell.
---
Sure
---
Retail is still boring as shit
---
Oh, burn.
---
I don't know how anyone isn't using greenshot or sharex.
---
Im the same way but honestly I feel like there's RealMobHealth and say an add-on like Clique. Like some add-ons completely change the way you play Classic and the some like RealMobHealth are really just harmless. I mean you shot a mob for 25 and a fifth of it's health goes down you can assume it's around 125, this just does not the guessing for you. The only time it could be questionable about affecting the whole experience is on high HP mobs like a raid boss.
---
WE WILL

#ROCK YOU

Saurfang once tried cleave him, and he parried it.
---
Attack any opposite faction member on sight, this is why we roll on a PvP server.
---
You need to flick your mouse towards the target while the wand is being unsheathed with Z. People favor slower wants because the timing is easier.
---
Every server is
---
Why do i need downrank blizzard and arc explosion? I need a seperate high rank bind for polymorph to? Or just r1
---
Yeah. I had shoulders that had +str/stam (hunter) because they were a drop that was better than the grey pair I had at the time.
---
My pleasure. I remember when this actually happened! I feel so old now!
---
It would fragment the player base and is a bad idea.  When do you draw the line?  When we have a dozen discrete versions?
---
Oddly detailed response but ok.
---
Gotta grab that ungoro flight path bruh!
---
" So, the next time an Item he needed was up for roll, I rolled need with him to increase the chances of him getting it. I would not have needed that item myself or even be able to use it, iirc it was an axe. "  
---
This is a true dog act, you knew that when you did it, don't play innocent here.
---
Hunter or Warlock
---
depends the level of mob your fighting too. There's a good chance at least the last two sunder armors do absolutely nothing as the armor is already reduced as much as it can be. 
---
plus if you're sitting on rage you might as well use HS
---
the reality is the situation is way more nuanced than OP makes it seem, and in many cases OP is just straight up wrong
---
I also like how OP acts like an 44 extra damage aint shit
---
Hunter probably
---
I left a second-wave Normal
---
Server and rerolled on the highest population Normal Server. Queues aren‚Äôt as awful now and the pain of queues now &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; pain of having a level 50+ character on a server you realize will never have a real viable economy or endgame culture.
---
Anyone know of a guild that raids in the daytime NA?
---
Lol this is great. Enjoy classic mate
---
Dammit. I was going to make this meme and post it here. It really is. I went to Redridge and there were people killing boars and whelps left and right, so I just kept skinning. Maxed it out and filled half my inventory with leather and whelp stuff. It really was free real estate.
---
No this was sometime after Naxx was out but before BC.
---
Wait really? As an ally on incendius I basically have given up on STV. The far north area is eh but the fifth south I go the worse it gets. Even in a 5 man group it‚Äôs still bad. I think there‚Äôs also so many horde they fight amongst themselves over spawns and in their free time kill us lol
---
I used to swipe alot to keep aggro but that's not as effective as demoralizing shout. Just spam that in aoe pulls.
---
Also tro to buffer your rage. In the last portion of the pull you don't need to use your spells really to keep aggro.
---
So save your rage and start next encounter with like 50 rage.
---
Makes it much easier to keep aggro when u can do a few spells right in the beginning!
---
I‚Äôm new, what is ‚Äúlayering‚Äù?
---
Lfg makes me feel pretty sad for not picking mage.
---
TBH I think 17k ph is good from questing.  
---
The only way to get faster would be dedicated dungeon AOE leveling
---
The thing about Classic is it feels like a world. People and monsters are all over the place doing their own thing, and they don't give a crap about you.
---
In retail you have all the NPCs that want you to do things neatly arranged in quest hubs, and you'll have one who wants you to kill 10 murlocs standing next to the guy who wants 10 murloc mcguffins and the guy who wants 5 stolen widgets retrieved from the murloc cave.
---
Retail feels like a video game. In Classic, the world does not revolve around you.
---
Hey look, you can actually see there was a war there...not the same dude getting ganked 45 times.
---
Nice.
---
Just hit 40 on my warrior main, going to take a breather and fully catch up on professions, cooking and fishing especially.
---
4 days /played and still loving it.
---
God damn this post is cringy. Just kill her! You're on a pvp server, not some "wholesome" watered-down hello kitty island adventure style game.
---
That's... Not the math I'm talking about. I'm talking about the computational math that is programmed that the server calculates in regards to armor, weapon, attack power, stamina, armor amount and class, multipliers, buffs, bonuses, curses, enchants, position etc.  The stuff that happens every single swing or cast.
---
Yea that is what I mentioned regarding melatonin. Light in general (and blue light more than other types, but all types will do this) suppresses melatonin production, which promotes sleep states. Basically as you say, making your body not realize it is night time.
---
Though honestly this is contentious as well, as there are studies both showing strong impact of screens at night and minimal impact, as there is much more to your body's sleep/wake cycle than one hormone, so there is still no unified scientifically tested consensus on the matter.
---
They play hunter though
---
Every melee class?
---
This should be constantly restated. Good work, OP!
---
thanks!! that's really well hidden
---
Yea this, pet tank you spank :) just like in the bedroom? üòò
---
Filthy casual.
---
Most servers, especially PvP servers, are horde favoured.
---
Honestly it's why I recommend Alliance. BG queues, when they get here, will be *much* faster. Back when I was still playing retail I talked to a coworker in the same server group who played horde.. they had to wait an hour or more for their queues whereas ours were a minute or less.
---
I get that people like the horde but honestly I'd rather play the game.
---
Mage is pretty damn easy. Way easier than any other class I have tried.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_Shock
---
Not at all. People just assume they suck because the ‚Äúhuntard meme‚Äù grew out of proportion. They do solid dps when geared. No where near mages/warriors, but we ran 5 hunters out n the server I played before classic. They always say in the mid/top of the meter.
---
You do a lot of whining.
---
&gt; except for Renew which is useful
---
Disagree, lol. The heal/mana is terrible. I use it to top off my health while running and that's pretty much it, lol.
---
I'll probably respec when I can get shadow, just run shadow for now. Thanks for the help! :)
---
HANDLE IT
---
I decided to try questing in stonetalon as alliance. I was attacked by a warlock 3 levels below me and killed him. He yells for help and a couple minutes later 5 hordies of mixed level killed me and spawn camped me for 4 deaths.  I tried to call for help, but according to /who, there were only 3 alliance players in the whole zone.
---
That's why alliance don't like to fight in these areas. Outside of the wetlands and duskwood, we're heavily outnumbered in every contested zone and really have no chance
---
Gonna take a little more than a script kiddie to take the WoW servers down to be honest.
---
ODD GROUPS GO TO LEFT, EVEN GROUPS GO RIGHT
---
Hunters if you like that ranged aspect, good consistent damage
---
When I talk to people they say "the hype will die fast, it is only nostalgia..."
---
I never played vanilla, been playing WoW for years though. Haven't had this much fun in a very long time.
---
I'd say average is about 60k for most groups, you need real legit players to net 80k+.
---
I'd recommend a mouseover polymorph macro and a mouseover decurse macro. If you're running out of keubind space, I suggest using ` r f c x z keys for another row. So you have 1-6 and alt, Ctrl, or shift + 1-6 then `-z and the modifier + `-z.
---
Didn't downvote you, but there isn't anything about this that says "the OP is extremely good". Not to disparage him or anything - he's a lowbie combat rogue who got surprised, not some Cold Blood/Prep/engineering dude making a pvp video to show off his incredible skills. 
---
But he didn't really do anything except vanish and then used his very standard rogue abilities, mostly mashing sinister strike and hoping for evasion dodges. It's not like he turned it around into a perfect 100-0 stunlock.
---
I'm very cute
---
That's true too. 
---
Honestly, locks shouldnt have to lifetap in under 40 dungeons. Dots+wand.
---
There‚Äôs on in the Orgrimmar inn with Gamon.
---
Most of what I said does reflect reality because that's what happened.  Thanks for your delusional perspective that no other opinion but your own is correct.
---
Isn't the Staff of Westfall better for ally players?
---
From RS heard about WoW, did the free trial and dominated BC,LK,Catalcysm then quit. I played vanilla about 2 weeks until the expansion BC came out so this is basically my first vanilla experience.
---
shams have shocks
---
Tell your team to keep Lutz off the field im tryin to win week1 in fantasy over smh
---
It's pretty similar to what you said only there's a coefficient that determines how much of your spell power the spell gets. A spell like fireblast for example generally won't have a 1.0 coefficient since it's instant cast, it's probably lower like 0.6 or something (meaning it inherits 60% of your spell damage,) Pyroblast on the other hand having a huge cast time adds more than 1.0 on the main hit in addition to having a coefficient that adds damage to the damage over time component.
---
It's used for routing, it's the number that decide how long a packet is allowed to live. It does not matter if it's 64 or 128, 64 is more than enough and 128 is just even more.
---
I used to do this in Alterac Valley in vanilla, just with snowballs from some Christmas festival on the alliance bridge. Deactivated wow for 10 years, got back on for classic a few weeks ago and checked my retail character, they‚Äôre still in the inventory. No idea if they still work! Only been playing classic
---
Don‚Äôt believe the hype lol warlock can level fast but has  a pretty high skill cap
---
Wow doesn't really use that much data and is forgiving for large ping. Probably cuz it was designed for dial up 15 years ago
---
Popping people out of stealth/vanish if you're fast enough.
---
And no, just r1 poly for pvp. Full rank is for pve only.
---
Is molten core in it's 1.1 state or it's 1.12 state?
---
I doubt they will release C'Thun in it's unkillable state.
---
Heroic strike is the only rage dump we have for a long time. Rend only goes so far. And Overpower is not proced often enough, nor is the cost high enough to dump rage. Heroic strike is a great ability. Once you get sweeping strikes cleave becomes very powerful, but i find that taking the extra damage of a second mob adds too much down time for recovery imo.
---
Taking the boat to Booty Bay does that, as does travel to adjacent zones.
---
In Cataclysm one of the intro questlines to one of the zones requires you to go down there. I think it's for Twilight Highlands
---
Played both Hunter and warlock
---
Hunter is definitely easiest warlock being decently close behind
---
Hunters have the advantage of running any pet (dmg heavy) while still having taunt
---
Type this in your command prompt (Tried legit everything, I MEAN EVERYTHING) :  netsh int ipv4 set glob defaultcurhoplimit=129 
---
worked for me
---
Are you having a bad day?
---
Thanks for the reply. Would Whirlwind work as well if I can't use Execute ?
---
that part made me literally chuckle. Then I came to the comments and saw people eating this shit up and double chuckled
---
im not wasting rage on Sunder armor though, i'd rather save it or use hs
---
Wow that is amazingly ingenious and evil.
---
Did you not read the parent comment? By the time I responded it just seemed so ridiculous that I realized some people take a video game too seriously.
---
38 priest wand spec then full shadow, healing has been ezpz for dungeons, and solo is very easy just holyfire, shadow word pain, bubble and wand. Then get a spirit tap  and stay out of combat till that‚Äôs done, and I‚Äôm full mana again by next mob.
---
You didn't read the second part.
---
Depends entirely on your group. If you do the pulls the correct way with the Mages rotating Novas correctly, you‚Äôll pull 80k+. SM was only about 60k for us. 70-80k in ZF. Same with BRD. And then LBRS was the best and easiest one with 100k/HR. Also depends on how you handle your reset. If you‚Äôre running all the way out of the dungeon to reset, you‚Äôll lose a good amount per hour.
---
There were already loads of clones that tried to beat wow at it's own game.  They didn't work.
---
Hi! This is a NVIDIA/X11 bug that will happen in any Vulkan based application! The solution is indeed to limit the FPS (VSync will NOT work even if it has the same result)
---
The lag comes from... god knows what, but it causes X11 to crap out. Your game will run at a buttery smooth framerate, but the moment you do anything like open a window, move a window, capture a window (like OBS does) or anything, you'll be screaming at how choppy it is.
---
Easily fixed, though!
---
Apparently, it wasn't changed until [halfway through TBC](https://i.imgur.com/f5DasQP.png)
---
\#NoChanges?
---
It worked beautifully, yes.  And the gold was not just for the one tip on the one add-on.  I now know how to do this (seemingly basic) task for various other add-ons/games.  And because I'm always so hesitant to ask for help regarding these things because, like you said, people can be patronizing.  Being into gaming doesn't necessarily imply being good with computers in general.  Thanks!
---
Edit: and I was already familiar with the scanning function.  I had Auctioneer from Twitch (because it was as simple as clicking 'install', but those scans took upwards of 30 mins, and the tooltips looked gross and were bugged/innacurate.  Auctionator is much, MUCH better.
---
I'm also trying to write a Last Stand marcro that looks something like this:
---
/cast Last Stand
---
/y Last Stand used
---
/in 15 /y Last Stand fading in 5 seconds
---
but the /in delay command is not working.  Was /in not a thing yet in Vanilla?
---
I believe there are also tents made out of either centaur or human flesh because you can see a face on part of it. Freaked me out first time I saw it.
---
Just looked it up, the gnoll tents have a human face stitched into the leather.
---
Assuming you only care about healing, you can't really go wrong with that  build, deep holy is really good for healing and you get blessing of kings and blessing of might increases
---
Cool thanks!
---
To be fair, the art isn't a Classic-only thing. The WoW art team has almost always delivered.
---
Wow you really wrecked those players 10 levels below you. Damn. Straight fire.
---
WoW is a CPU bound game and Linux generally has lower CPU overhead, but the overhead from Wine would offset it. Either way, it should be as good as native, yes.
---
Generally while levelling it‚Äôs much easier to level as mainly retribution + a small amount of prot talents such as precision and improved hammer of justice, blessing of kings. This will still enable you to heal, tank dungeons and buff, while being much easier to level. Check out judgement‚Äôs guides on YouTube.
---
have fun wasting rage on the last 2-3 sunder armors that don't drop the armor any lower while I'm moving on to the next mob
---
Idk man I have to press "Windows+prntscrn" at the same time to take a screenshot. Some people have to do "Fn+prntscrn"... But I found that out with a SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH. Cmon people, screenshot your stuff, it's not that hard.
---
What addon is this looks cool
---
I wish some bot would keep track of these reposts. I wanna see that number
---
Hit him with a "no u"
---
Not only that, but you can spec specifically for getting your health back and having more health.
---
Demonic embrace and improved healthstone.
---
Then go first aid and snag health potions for super cheap, because they don't share cooldown with healthstone. 
---
If you are undead, you can also cannibalize, and then of course you can grab cooking for HP5 (stacks with your demon armor) or just straight up stam/spr. Or you can buy cooked food. If you go far enough you can slap on dark pact with demo specs for imp battery.
---
You should never need healing from Life Tap.
---
Where's your ranged shield though?
---
warrior in my opinion.
---
You can just cast until they're in melee range then auto them down the rest of the way While you regen mana. Don't need a wand to auto
---
Most sources I've seen talking about Classic or Vanilla ( [https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/23110-aoe-threat-generation/](https://forum.elysium-project.org/topic/23110-aoe-threat-generation/) ,  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder\_Clap](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Thunder_Clap) ,  [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Thunder\_Clap#Patches\_and\_hotfixes](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Thunder_Clap#Patches_and_hotfixes) ) seem to list a threat multiplier for the damage of Thunder Clap, while not noting that it's added in a specific patch, leading me to believe Thunder Clap does indeed have bonus threat.   
---
I'd love to see sources if I'm wrong in believing this.
---
What's the interface please?
---
Oi!  r/uwotm8 ?
---
25% of your mana for 100% of mine sounds like stonks to me.
---
What show is it?
---
Only rogues get AP from agility? You sure about this?
---
bingo, wasting rage on execute usually isn't the play. Having rage left over makes it so much easier to move from mob to mob quickly
---
i dont think its going to matter much. people are going to want to fill raids.
---
the art of teaching a group that the efficiency flow of waiting to see aggro run correctly is far better for the total speed and fun of the clear - is only effective insofar as your group members are teachable, that they want to learn the skill of doing their job to buffer/disable dangerous targets whilst practicing focus fire and aggro awareness
---
Literally not unwanted at all. I guarantee that only the MOST extreme min-maxing guilds will care in the slightest.
---
I was having a field day skinning raptors in the Wetlands dig site earlier today. Made off with probably 60 medium leathers by the time I was done.
---
20 raptor eggs, too, so I finally had a reason to buy the expert cooking book.
---
The community has been fantastic, but while it's partly because of the people, classic has definitely encouraged this behavior. Vanilla WoW encouraged a community. It's the main thing that blizzard lost and the main reason retail feels inferior. To get things done in Vanilla/classic, you are required to interact with people. If you behave anti-socially, or damage your reputation, you don't get it back. Servers are closed communities. This is what was lost in later expansions. The community is the core of vanilla wow, it's what draws people in and keeps people playing.
---
If you never plan to raid you would actually be better NOT going dwarf. In end game, fear is a heavily used mechanic and particularly for Onyxia and Nef.
---
It really wasnt even THAT bad of ping mostly. Flight Wifi is pretty good for being new. Could definitely quest around without too much trouble. Wouldn't expect to win any pvp battles tho.
---
Me too
---
Have my silver, alliance scum.
---
I‚Äôve been leveling as prot just fine. But the point being that even as an arms warrior, put on a shield and just tank. Sure leveling prot takes longer to kill things but I also save time by not looking for groups for things too.
---
heal/mana is bad for renew yeah, but the big appeal is that it's instant cast. I end up using it a lot to quickly top off the group, or myself.
---
Ok I see what you're saying then...but I assure you though it is all distilled down into pretty simple stuff to calculate, and like someone mentioned all just boils down to easy addition and multiplication calcs. These are the types of ops that a computer can do several hundred million times per second easily with decently optimized code.
---
I know because I happen to do this type of math often on data sets of a few hundred million points. If I'm just doing multiplication, addition, etc., then the process finishes in a fraction of a second.
---
WoW only has to do this math once per attack, so anywhere between 0.3 and 3-4 times per second per character depending on what class/spec you're playing. Even if you had a million characters attacking the same mob, good code would still process something like that near instantly.
---
Computers are a hell of a thing.
---
Hey man I called dibs on posting this today
---
Man. People are making it seem like it‚Äôs such a big deal. It‚Äôs really not. 
---
Is it objectively the best? Yes.
---
But if you have shit situational awareness, compared to the night elf priest, guess who‚Äôs gonna get invited the next week?
---
God I wish my PC wasn‚Äôt broken. Seeing this gave the the strangest/strongest urge to play
---
Really? I've been tanking Deadmines and Wailing Caverns and I seem to constantly keep aggro. Sometimes just from auto attacking alone because it seems I can hardly generate rage without popping Enrage.
---
I came here to say the same...I landed in Darkshire and it was pouring. It was so awesome!
---
This is Tukui, they released shortly after classic launched. I prefer Elvui tho for a lot of reasons. Definitely going to switch back when they update it.
---
nice weapon but boy this UI is ugly. what's wrong with the blizz character page design?
---
Yes. You're going to bounce between both continents.
---
Mage just has way too many tools and its damage in raids is basically spamming frostbolt or AoE
---
I've never been max level so I'm genuinely asking.
---
A couple of my friends have said that it's hard to find raiding groups on a lot of servers in retail and that is why they're worried about a "dead" server. Does that concern hold any water? Or is it even true?
---
Speedrunners do it for fun not to rain on anyone's parade - we're much more boring than you think! Lots of hard graft and little to no sleep.
---
I'm not trying to be a smartass when I say this, because I genuinely dont know the answer to your question, but there are a metric fuckton of websites with resources and answers to questions like this.
---
Check out classic wowhead. You'll find lists of every tier of lathering items, where they drop, best place to farm, etc.
---
Or just let us use our bandages and dont heal. Really had to laugh at the healer going crazy because he healed me everytime when i tried to use my bandages.
---
&gt;unironically posting half of a conversation
---
Yea waiting till 3 sunder armors is an absolute joke and if anyone thinks that's the norm your tank sucks or you suck at tanking. Also good DPS should know not to stack all their instants at the very beginning anyway. So it could be a case of your DPS being morons too
---
Of post removed fast
---
Your character seems happy enough about it
---
No you got it right, you gave me a wowhead link.
---
What‚Äôs your qeer ass name!?!?
---
Yep, this game is no where near hard enough that you are encountering dps checks on any 5 man boss. 
---
If you are good, you can make it work.
---
nice
---
you will be blacklisted and ganked on alternate accounts that alliance set up to shame filthy nelf/human priests.
---
Is this a US server only attack? I was playing on Oceanic like normal.
---
You're not the warlock I'm talking about. I'm specifically talking about a distressingly large number of warlocks who will lifetap to 5% and _do nothing at all_ to regenerate health.
---
I wish game companies would make worlds like this. I realize it would be a massive undertaking, but my god it would be so cool to have a realistic "world" of warcraft. I mean, Goldshire alone is supposed to have a population of around 7,000.
---
I'm a hunter dude they're competing with me, they're struggling to tag from me since I have no trouble tagging anything, and wing clip, immo trap and aggressive pet allowed me to tag any named mob where 10+ people were standing. I'm just simply faster alone
---
came here to say that.. not everybody realizes u can just kill the actual escort lol!
---
On my server back in 2004 a guild named ‚ÄúPeon This‚Äù was reported, and again a second time when they changed to ‚ÄúPeon That‚Äù.
---
I think it's actually that wands just don't benefit from ranged attack power at all. If a caster could wield a bow then they would see an AP boost from their agility on the bow.
---
If you don‚Äôt have the time then raiding is out of the question so
---
It‚Äôs also beneficial as a rage dump if you have excess rage, and it creates a high amount of threat if you need a bit of a boost there outside regular tanking rotation
---
I'm Canadian, not alt-right, and I say it. I listen to a comedy podcast and they definitely aren't alt-right, and say it (comedy bang bang). It's just a fun, stupid thing to sometimes chant. That said I don't hang around people who are that emotional about the president, especially since I'm not in the US.
---
(It also sounds like I say it all the time - I definitely don't, but if it's funny I may)
---
&gt;I guess the moral is--is a Hillary joke (or whatever) worth making someone feel attacked?
---
Wha?
---
Shaman are pretty much the go to Raid healer for Horde PVE. Any encounter that needs AOE healing they're indispensable freeing priests up to tank heal. You'll be valuable for sure.
---
Do you have a macro for Sac/Charm/Fel interrupt in 1 button, or separate keybinds?
---
Current have a simple /cast seduction for the succ, but would like to use the same bind if using a VW or Felhunter.
---
Hi, /u/Faibl

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2124k/dont_use_blood_fury_to_pull_aggro/).

Have to teach people to let you establish Agro. 
---
Other than that I always start an instance by telling the group I will be line of sight pulling, so wait until I get the group in position. Always line of sight pull if possible to control casters, and it allows for easier agro pick up after a mage sheep pulls it for a hunter trap to be laid down between you and the group. It may be a little slower, but it saves wipes from aground extra groups which wastes way more time
---
I get the feeling that the +spell damage is one of those stats that‚Äôs better if you stack it, I.e, enough to remove an entire cast off a mob kill. I‚Äôd get it for that reason alone, to test out a ‚Äúset‚Äù of +frost damage.
---
Emberstone is undoubtably one of the best early on, but I‚Äôm not sure I want to run DM more than once. Especially since you‚Äôre almost guaranteed competition (there‚Äôs a LOT of priests and mages running around) so even if it drops you still have to beat others for it.
---
Anecdotally, I‚Äôm more willing to trade damage for Stam on a mage than I would be on a lock. Life tap turns some of your green bar blue for more pewpew. But mages can get lucky with frostbite procs and crits where a mob doesn‚Äôt even get to you. I want to try going all in on that.

On the other hand, there‚Äôs a 6int ring from the goblin boss that I wouldn‚Äôt mind another shot at (and 3agi, classic vanilla itemization lol).
---
Did WC for my first time today. 2 manned ... me 29 warrior, friend ( I just met from guild) he wanted the recipe for Deviate Belt.
---
We had to reset instance 3 times because after hours we couldn‚Äôt find all the mobs. 
---
Never played Horde so I didn‚Äôt have experience there nor did he. Man it‚Äôs a mess in there! Like a damn maze
---
Great loot for its level too! 
---
I got there to fish deviates every two days and solo in and fish for an hour or two.
---
And I made a friend ! Much happy !
---
why does it scream that? Chest spawns every 3 hours, 8 a day. Games been out 2 weeks. I think you're just bad at video games fella.
---
It‚Äôs leviosa not leviosawwwwww
---
BfA never had a fraction of the community as this did when it first came out. There will always be saltiness and toxicity but Classic actively discourages that. Even now, General Chat is constantly warned of people who leave or are toxic. You can't afford to ruin your rep in Classic by being toxic.
---
fact of the matter is the situation is more nuanced that OP leads on
---
Hey bro. Its 19 days later. Get that Disc/Holy priest to 60 in 5 days /played?

Can you skin for the leather if you aren‚Äôt doing leatherworking??

Aww yes love this weekly post.

There are still games like albion, darkfall, etc and pvp survival games like ark and age of conan.  No one forgot.  WoW was definitely the herald of casual mmos(I remember thinking no xp loss was weird - why ever grind once you hit max level?), but it was *just* the right amount of casual to bring together everyone.  Blizzard then proceeded to split the pve and pvp playerbases and delete the open world.

Just dont heal them and if they die, they'll learn.
---
You can actually cast while the GCB is going if you time it right. Or just sidestep a bit to stop wanding.
---
Buddies? 0%
---
Enh is just better to level with, was my main point.
---
you should be at 85-95% and regen by the time the tank needs it.
---
Who and why the fuck do you think we care?
---
I wouldn't classify roleplayers as tryhards, unless they write like five paragraphs as an emote and go into a rage if they see somebody being slightly lore-inaccurate, but you do you.
---
As for the rude people, it could very well be my crippling altholism leaves me in the same level range where people troll on alts. Though there is the whole &lt;Final Boss&gt; vs the server shit going on.
---
The world will never know since they always do 2v1 or more
---
why the fuck does this game have a monthly subscription?
---
They‚Äôre the same. It was easier to use the retail version than trying to revert back to the original lighting.
---
wait..was he alliance himself?
---
I'll take the fortitude and then kill them.
---
Hmm I could get to 60 faster with just a lil bit o crack
---
I never said anything about CCing every mob.
---
It just means that you personally can't trivialize some raid mechanics (as well as the occasional 5 man). Your raid can still bring another dwarf priest and its nbd. That's it.
---
Nah ive figured it out, just waiting for a delivery.
---
I once heard it was meant to go to Gnomeregan as a fourth Alliance city but they decided it was too imbalanced. That was likely before the water portion though.
---
Sprinkle some crack on him and let's get out of here!
---
Which is precisely why tanks gear for extra threat and often dual-wield in order to generate more.
---
I would not heal a warlock if they used life tap.  When I was more new to the game warlocks would even whisper me to NOT heal them and that they will eat/ bandage to get their health back.  If they want to risk being at 1% hp, that is their risk to take and they shouldn't blame you if they happen to die to an aoe spell or a whack from a mob they pulled aggro from.
---
Yeah mates rates on loans for your buddies. Tell them "tips welcome" incase they want to give you a bit more for helping them
---
I‚Äôd go with dagger and offhand - but that‚Äôs a lot of spirit to lose. Tough choice.
---
You sound like a raging nerd find better things to do with your time
---
I went dwarf priest because of fear ward and the fact I look sexier with a beard.
---
If u have geforce experience installed, use alt+z by default. And click the filters option.
---
This is correct, except it is a bug. In 2005 you could not hold aggro on a group of mobs by spamming demo shout, not even close. Right now every application of demo shout is adding threat to every mob it hits making pulling more mobs the best way to hold aggro. It is why you can pull the entire SM graveyard and hold aggro over mages if you just spam demo shout.
---
BC is my top 1 because of how addicted to it I was. I had just graduated HS in 07 so poured my bum ass into the game. However I think if we did a left turn... with the same classic design... id be totally ok.
---
What I see in this sub is way more of people that played vanilla complaining about being in groups with people that didn‚Äôt play vanilla than I see people that didn‚Äôt play vanilla complaining about classic
---
I agreed with you until a couple days after release. 
---
Blizzard told everyone to move realms. I didn't want to at first. 
---
Then I did. I got all my friends to move too. We had no queues at all, the realm sits on High during peak time. We are no longer wasting our own time or wasting time for other people in the other full realm. 
---
I was worried about having to restart. Because of how easy it is to log in I got back to where I was in a fraction of the time and was so excited to do so without queues. I'm not stressed about being disconnected or being afk either. 
---
The realm I went to didn't shrink and it grew as people migrated. 
---
You were told over and over again to move to avoid queues, you and the other 5,000 people in queue knew what to do and instead all chose not to fix your problem. Just move.
---
Congratulations!  I plan on getting Timbermaw along with Frostsaber... I apparently like pain and suffering.  Combine that trinket with a Dartol's Rod for wacky Furbolg adventures!
---
Oh the irony
---
You can screenshot on ipads...
---
How can I see the requirements for higher level armour/weapons that I can't yet use? It just tells me I can't use it yet but doesn't say when I can use it.
---
Let‚Äôs be real, most players back then (even many in top guilds) were pretty shit compared to high end players now. This can be seen in kill videos back then of players clicking abilities, canceling casts often (dps did this, healers have an excuse at times), etc.
---
The vaunted ‚Äúsuper hardcore bosses‚Äù like Cthun, 4HM, and Kel‚ÄôThuzad will all die day one of their release, unless servers are completely just fucked. The two biggest things that kept them all alive so long were player skill and ignorance. They didn‚Äôt know how fights worked and had to learn everything. Information was often withheld to preserve server/world ranking.
---
Even at 27 they still won't miss that much. It's not like the mob will be red
---
Take a fucking screenshot.
---
Thank you!
---
This is Immersion. I personally prefer Storyline.

Why the toxic attitude and strained misperceptions? I'm not trying to be center of anything here. I'm raising an issue that emerges from something *OBJECTIVE*, as you can see if you actually took the time to read and comprehend my post. Vanilla was a game version that ran over the course of about 2 years. Throughout these years, content was made easier over time while player characters and their equipment was made more powerful. At the end of Vanilla, the past Vanilla content was trivialized. This trivialized content, alongside the more powerful characters and items, are what we are having now. That is not subjective, that is objective, whether or not you want to submit to it or not. If you cannot bring anything to the table aside from strawmen and bad attitude, kindly don't bring it at all. Thank you.
---
Yes I am experiencing the same thing, I don't get it.
---
Apples or oranges?
---
Shouts generate threat
---
I would not recommend dropping DS. BS maybe. DS generated some small threat on all targets. Pretty handy. 
---
The honest truth is that it's not entirely your job. Your job is to collect aggro on everything. Then keep enough to prevent heal aggro. The rest is up to your dps. If they are not waiting for you to get a sunder or two on the focus target. Or if you have 3 dps that are all targeting different baddies. It's always going to be rough. 
---
Basically charge in. DS, cleave taint and sunder. Once 5 stacks of sunder are on you can try and start sundering other mobs or try aoe
---
Man even without shields as a bear I always feel rage deprived.
---
Thankfully just auto attacking seems to keep them on me most of the time. Possibly due to me often shifting out in order to do precise pulls, my party just doesn't understand how to pull just one. Or how to stay back, or not attack it until I do, etc.
---
Wrong. Taunt increases threat on target by a huge amount. Even though it falls off, taunting an already targeted mob will vastly increase threat. Which is why you see warriors taunt on CD on bosses so they are sure to stay at top of threat so dps can go HAM
---
Booty Bay which is outside: Cannot Travel Form.

Demo shout is also big aggro mate and make sure you swap to def stance asap for the extra threat gen

Lesser Heal is both less efficient than even Heal (Rank 1) and the healing / second is unlikely to keep pace with the DPS your tank is facing. Even if it is, you'll spend so much more time casting and not regenerating mana. Its much better to wait until they need a higher level heal and regen mana while not casting.
---
I‚Äôve been wondering what it would be like to roll up a protection paladin to run classic 5-man dungeons. My experience from BC was that you held threat like a boss (consecration + holy shield ftw!) but slowed down the run since you had to drink for mana after every pull. Also, if someone fucked up and pulled while you were OOM things got spicy. It was also a bitch to find int-gear in plate! Do you think I would be better off learning warrior-tanking for classic and leave the pallys to heal and buff?
---
I don't really raid. And that's the same for other MMO's I play too. 
---
I play MMO's more for RPG aspects, levelling and socialising.
---
The retail version of wow feels very easy (taking into account I don't do raids). And I find classic wow to be pretty good challenge wise. But difficulty isn't the reason why I prefer classic over retail. It just feels like I'm more connected to my character and the world when I play classic.
---
But I guess your question is more targeting raiders rather than people like me
---
Create a weakaura for the missing buff
---
You can but you need to have yet another quest mod so it looks different than the other two.
---
You know how when you walk into a dungeon, you can only see the players you're grouped with, even though there might be hundreds of others running that same dungeon at the same time?
---
Layering is basically that, but for the entire continent/world with thousands of players in each instance or "layer."  
---
You automatically get assigned to a layer when you log in, and generally only switch layers when a player from a different layer invites you to a group.
---
Don't you all have phones?
---
Hamstring is better than sunder. You proc overpower way more, you proc deep wounds WAY more, you proc your weapon ability and fiery weapon.
---
  
---
It‚Äôs also important to note that on mobs 3+ higher than you, heroic strike is way better than sunset/hamstring.
---
Hold for 3 months
---
I'm doing it with every Twink weapon I could possibly buy for 1-5 gold. 
---
Worst case, they aren't worth hundreds of gold like they were in classic, and i will have some dope rogues, priests, druids and hunters to F around with in 19 or 29 bracket.
---
Classic wow is retail!
---
Ye its like people going undead for WoF but hey, they actually never use it in wpvp.
---
No racial can compensate the skill and good players are always welcome in every guild/raid
---
Fearing is a very slippery slope, be careful. If you're alone with the mob its it's cool, if there are other mobs nearby, use it with caution.
---
People said the same thing about old school runescape. Look at it now. It has dwarfed the main game/rs3
---
sorry I was busy leveling, I didn't have time to get the whole thing.  also busy watching kitboga
---
Recklessness is for buttholes that run in and tag your mobs.
---
Classic is more fun and satisfying. Now that I have an alternative to retail I‚Äôll likely never play it again. 
---
Iv been angered by most decisions made in the cata expansion, I kinda liked mop and have not liked anything after that. 
---
Classic feels better to play, there is a server community, the chat isn‚Äôt filled with absolute carebears that can‚Äôt handle banter (at least this appears to be true on my oceanic server) and finally what I do actually matters, I‚Äôm finally free of the perpetual hamster wheel that is the modern game.
---
I use Elvui for everything except unit frames, and for unit frames I‚Äôve got Luna for everything.
---
I find Elvui to be amazing for action bars, chat windows, minimap, everything basically, but ugly and hard to configure for unit/party/raidframes.
---
Luna is great and clean and easy to set up.
---
Yeah priests are amazing levelers. Spirit tap plus wand spec means you have no downtime and shred mobs.
---
I had heard he can always Charge Horde at any time, because they're not even worthy of being considered combat to him
---
Go solo it wussy
---
The tab and sunder buttons are your friends.... I was a prot warrior back in vanilla.

Haven't bothered reading the rest of the comments by my tactic so far (25 warrior tank) in Stockades has been the following:  
---
Use bloodrage
---
Aggro 3-4 mobs
---
Spam demoralising shout / thunder clap
---
Taunt mobs if I lose them
---
\*If its a dungeon boss I spam taunt/sunder
---
Everything is a hunter weapon!!
---
I should do that next time it happens.
---
Is it possible since its technically not a buff and just an icon that shows up on the map? I couldn't figure out a way to do it.
---
100000% percent I've been doing this too.  Watching old cartoons I used to watch around that same era since I was younger even if it's just background noise is suchhh a good vibe.  It's like double nostalgia rolled into one beautiful experience.
---
"I don't know why my account got hacked..."
---
Wind Waker is definitely a fan favorite
---
I can't say lol. Its just an average English name.
---
No problem.
---
Completely wrong. Raids take 1-2 hours to clear when raid is prebis, maybe even less. As the weeks go on we will see sub 60 minute MC clears from pugs. OP has plenty of time to do the raids in a lug setting, which is what MC will be in about 2 months.

Why is this not working for me? My priest just stands there and neither wands nor dances.

It isn't bugged, it just works differently than people have experienced from private servers in the past however many years. Rextroy released [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YBIivTJEdQ) explaining how it works in classic.
---
When you piss off the secret Blizzard DM.
---
You chose the right class. üòÄ
---
This is why I dont use fast travel in skyrim.
---
You see, classic is so immersive even the insults drop back to school levels
---
That's all well and good until you're trying to generate rage and pull four mobs and then your warrior dps charges the last one to aggro you and your two mages polymorph the other two just as im finally getting enough rage to swipe, so I swipe and lose threat on all four mobs and we wipe... From my perspective, my dps just have a complete misunderstanding of the threat mechanics of the game.
---
Pretty anecdotal evidence. I think you‚Äôll find servers are more balanced than you think.
---
So why are you in here bitching about it?
---
For the horde
---
Most classes have ramp up of some degree. Casters have cast times,  rogues need to build CP, warriors need rage banked before they go ham. I think enhance sham is pretty front loaded I suppose, and hunter is all gas all the time. If you'e just looking to avoid cast bars though, play any melee or a hunter and you'll be fine.
---
Now I‚Äôm curious, how old are you and what are you watching ?
---
Right now for me it‚Äôs House, purely on as background noise
---
Same. Always make sure there is no other warrior in my group so that I can tank without worrying about the my rolls
---
4 stam
---
4 spirit
---
Green leather belt
---
I'm skinning for my priest because some tailoring uses leather, and even after that it helps to have a bit of extra gold. Especially this early into the release, there are dead beasts laying around everywhere and if you find a zone heavy with players doing kill quests, there are plenty of free skins to grab up.
---
I use a macro that is similar as the ones here. It allows me to use shift and hit different pet abilities in one button. The classic warlock discord has tons of useful info.
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PmAPvVda-340ryYPuhdQ9rBTlHsh2WkMPm84F7TMEsg/mobilebasic
---
It‚Äôs usually pretty balanced.
---
Taunt does nothing to increase threat if the mob is already targeting you. It does force it to attack you for 3 seconds, but you only gain threat value when you use it while the mob is attacking someone else.
---
I mean, I love classic wow but the sustainability argument is still out there. I certainly hope it doesn't fail, but I think it's way too soon to judge the long-term success of this experiment.
---
Whatever happened to good American names, like John, or Adam?!?!
---
There's one quest you need to do steps in uldaman and iron forge, so at least 2 runs minimum if you want 100% quests.
---
From what i've noticed since bc is that usually on pvp servers there is more horde than alliance, even by a little 55/45
---
And, usually on pve servers it is in favor of alliance
---
How will people know how heroic I am though?
---
Hmmm I wonder what server this guy plays on...
---
Nah he's really not. Don't like sharing a node? Move to another spot. They're a free for all.
---
LET ME SHIFT INTO TRAVEL FORM
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
My point is that warlocks are all powerful and gnome racials aren't all that?
---
Lighten up.
---
The tooltip should have the level requirement on it to be honest.
---
Feel free to take a screencap and post it and I can point it out! You might have an addon which changes up the tooltips, but it should be there.
---
He is right though. You not knowing how the game works doesn't make your observations fact
---
Yeah, as we get closer to 60, the gap on DMG gets bigger when trying to keep up with Mages on trash packs. Spamming Sbolt is a lot of mana as well. Best you can do is toss a couple dots up and AoE/Wand. Then when the boss comes up, you‚Äôll have full action on nuking and topping that meter.
---
please macro a start attack into on of your skills
---
Toss them one renew and hope they don‚Äôt get themselves killed before it runs its course. Allows you to have healed them while giving them a chance to use their bandages, both sides win.
---
Well they were right. 
---
Osrs sucked at first, it had big launch numbers and then plummeted. 
---
The small osrs team released brand new osrs content and there's a popular graph that shows everytime new content was released there was a jump in players. 
---
That's why I don't want classic to just release all the expansions again. Give us classic feeling content that new.
---
Osrs is only huge now especially after the mobile release but it was smaller for a few years.
---
Yes you mail your alt and it posts auctions and such. The mails take an hour to arrive on the arriving end so you need ot plan ahead.
---
With that said, if you hit return on a mail it is instant. (Still takes the hour to arrive in the first place)
---
Sorry dont spend my life on the internet.
---
Let him dream ok :(
---
jeeeesus
---
Then I don't understand how you could possibly hold this opinion, having done and supposedly read the absolute shit random side-quests. 
---
I have addressed "quest design". That being one part of quests. Again, "click thing" and "kill thing", isn't a valid "template", it's just arbitrarily downplaying your actions. What thing, how many things, where are those things and other factors are as significant as what you ultimately do to the "thing" once you get there. The act of for example traveling to an object, is as significant as clicking on that object. If you downplay it to "click" and "kill" I don't see what other template BfA possibly ads. 
---
Also, you cannot at all say that about Classic. Again, when is the last time you actually fucking played it, because it makes no sense. A very large amount of quests will be found completely outside quest hubs, or there will be various alternative quest hubs with 2-3 quests. Whereas in BfA, you have very specific, structured and completely arbitrary hubs with a very constant number of quests (again in BfA specifically 3) that will always be limited in their range to their tiny area. Also no, there are no quests in BfA that make you travel anywhere, no significant distance, not at all like in Classic. 
---
We will only agree on things if you start being accurate about them. Which so far, in my opinion, no.
---
&gt; Within 3 days of launch, all content of Classic had been cleared. 
---
So?  Why does that matter at all?
---
&gt; The raid group in question had a far from optimal composition with undergeared players - almost half of which hadn't hit max level.  This led to reactions claiming or trying to confirm that Vanilla indeed is ridiculously easy and,
---
Who cares?
---
&gt;   arguably, post-nerf Vanilla is. 
---
There is no such thing as "post-nerf Vanilla".  1.12 is Vanilla. 
---
&gt;  Even without these nerfs to content difficulty, we are already simulating the 1.12 balance to classes, mechanics and itemizations, making our characters more powerful than they originally were at the time of these patches.
---
Holy shit.  Ok:
---
1. Who cares if you run sims on classes?  We're not trying to get some new harder Vanilla.  Who gives a fuck if it's easy or not?
---
2.  Now you're guessing just how Blizzard intended the last versions of Vanilla to be?  Even if you can, who cares?  They're not going to make it hard to keep a bunch of pserver tryhards happy.
---
&gt; We can already see how it is commonplace to masspull and AoE in dungeons, instead of having to play carefully with proper CC and threat controls.
---
So what?  People AOE farmed shit all the time in the world.  Why should anyone care at all if a group of three mages with tank and heals farm trash in an instance?
---
&gt; That is not in the spirit of an authentic Vanilla experience.
---
Ah, so they play in a way you decided was wrong.  That's the whole point of your fantastic waste of our time.
---
&gt;  Velquez summarized the nerfs to Vanilla content on the US forums for Classic. One issue that arise from having post-nerf content made easy is that content phases will have to either be rolled out faster to compensate, or have progress stagnate for a good while. 
---
Who gives a shit if the poopsock pserver tryhards stagnate for a while?  Why the fuck should Blizzard cater to people tryharding a 15 year old game?
---
&gt;  Blizzard themselves have said that they haven‚Äôt yet determined exactly when phases 2-6 will occur and have mentioned that this will be decided partly by community feedback and the PvE progress pace. If content phases are rolled out faster due to post-nerf difficulties, Classic will have a shorter timespan with less time for quality polishing, as well as losing much of the epic sensations of finally downing that one buss you've been on for hours, days or even weeks.
---
No don't do that.  It's stupid.  Rephrase it like it really is:
---
"If content phases are rolled out faster due to poopsocking pserver tryhards..."
---
&gt;  I would
---
Quite frankly, no one gives a shit what **you** would do to the game.
---
So most of the playerbase is in the lvl range for sm. Sm also has alot of bis.
---
Its also a great way to lvl and gear up before wpvp zones.
---
How dare they do that
---
The point is that your abilities that deal weapon damage aren't tied to speed. 
---
A 2h warhammer with 50 dps that deals 100 damage on a 2 second speed and a 1h with 50 dps that deals 50 damage every 1 second aren't the same. 
---
When you use an ability that deals damage then the 2h will deal 100 and the 1h will deal 50, this is seperate from the auto attack dps which means the 2h deals more damage.
---

---
Not in classic man. Trust me. Go download a threat meter and test for yourself. Insane mass threat with a fall off over the duration.
---
At level 34 you can start tanking SM.  You can spam run GY and Library until you're 36-37 range then spam run Armory until you're 38-39 then spam run Cathedral until you're 41-42 (OR just keep grinding arms, it seems to have the best xp per minute).  
---
Or you could try Desolace, Swamp of Sorrows, or Alterac Mountains and just grind mobs there.  Questing is not efficient if manymany people try to do the same quests at once.  
---
Anyway, that's how I'd deal with it.
---
Dagoth Ur reference. Nice
---
They both have strengths and weaknesses. In my opinion:
---
Retail Pros:
---
Graphically superior
---
More accessible leveling
---
Battlegrounds (none in classic for now, which is why I stopped temporarily.)
---
Faster paced, can do alot more with say 30 min of playtime vs Classic
---
Abundant gold
---
Abundant quest experience
---
Overall easier 
---
Classic Pros:
---
Community, social aspect of game is THRIVING beautifully in classic and LFG has pretty much killed it in retail. 
---
Pre-cataclysm- world destroying that Cataclysm and BFA brought. Which IMO really sucked
---
In my opinion, it's mostly nostalgia. Alot of the changes were good in retail. Many were bad - really bad. It's an almost entirely different game now. I personally rather play classic though.
---
Hahaha yes enchantment just for levelling üòä I'm planning to be resto. Love healing
---
I'm now much more concerned about the level cap at 60.
---
Chaosdwarfxd is hilarious, but yeah I agree.
---
&gt; Wrong. Taunt increases threat on target by a huge amount. Even though it falls off, taunting an already targeted mob will vastly increase threat. Which is why you see warriors taunt on CD on bosses so they are sure to stay at top of threat so dps can go HAM
---
This isn't retail lmao. Taunting a mob that's already attacking you literally does nothing.
---
There's 3 different types of food, so you can get 60 food items.
---
If waiting for a less populated timeframe isn't an option (working overnights makes this a non issue for me), you can try jumping layers  for a quick (possible) fix. But there's no silver bullet here, sometimes it's better to just skip quests that you know will be a quagmire. Dungeons and less popular zones are the best fixes until the pops even out.
---
I have tested this at almost every level, in both specs, up to my current 41 - and this is just WRONG. I have a *consistently* faster time to kill with two weapons than a two-hand. So much so that, after getting Whirlwind Axe and Ravager both, I barely use either.

Yep don't use Heroic strike.
---
one of those, right time, right place moments!
---
Purposely wasting your own money so that someone else also makes less is pretty similar to investing your time so that another player has his own time wasted (camping).
---
I post a lot about shaman as I have been playing one for nearly 12 years. If you got any questions, feel free to msg me or go check out Egregious guide to Resto shaman on YouTube. He‚Äôs a great shaman theory crafter.
---
I‚Äôd argue it‚Äôs not an experiment.  Counterfeit servers have existed for a long time.  I would posit that the long-term examination has already been done. We know that people wanted this 10 years ago when they made the illegal Servers.  This is blizzard finally direct and cash flow to making this happen for people who are interested in it and don‚Äôt have to steal it.
---
Why do you need to go all the way over there when you're right here?
---
As a paladin I would personally level Holy/Prot to aoe grind and also be able to heal or tank in leveling dungeons.  It depends on your play style, but leveling deep holy may get VERY monotonous.  If you want to do more damage, you could also try ret.  Of course when you're 60 you can respec deep holy.  
---
Here is how I usually would spec level 1-60 (Get the holy talents first)  
---

---
People may disagree with me here, but I always liked this build.
---
It‚Äôs not so much the calculation that‚Äôs complicated as is building the equation itself.
---
You must be new to vanilla tanking
---
You stupid night elfs and your stupid magical fishing poles.
---
I read this everywhere but yeh I could not get into it. It‚Äôs the only game in the series I never completed. I could not get over the awful art style
---
 I don‚Äôt know why people liked it.
---
You can get that feature back with addons
---
Bro.. go test it for yourself. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
My problem with RP servers is that they require everyone to RP all the time. I only want to RP some of the time. If some neck beard comes up to you trying to ERP, they will just report you when you tell them to fuck off. I'm considering transferring off grob simply because the RP players spend all their time complaining about players not currently RPing. They keep trying to call out people in local chat saying their name isn't RP, but they won't take the time to read up on their lore.
---
If you want a more streamlined and challenging endgame experience, go with retail. If you buy bfa you get a lvl 110 boost for free.
---
If you want a hardcore leveling experience, sense of community, and a game that feels like it was made with love, go with classic.
---
yeah you realize you can only have one of each type of HoT right? so you literally just proved the point of having a single token resto druid
---
Wow a real masochist
---
I believe there is a mod for that.
---
By DW‚Äôing with out proper hit rating you are surrendering yourself to the RNG gods.
---
I don‚Äôt have any hard info/formulas for ya (google has it somewhere)
---
But essentially DW = steady stream (with the proper hit) dps and 2H = more bursty dps.
---
2H is also better for world pvp scenarios should that apply to you.
---
But ultimately the gear you have available should be your deciding factor. 
---
Good luck, and have fun out there!
---
If you want to play retail, play retail. No need to come over here and ruin our game.
---
Wouldn't a PvP server just be the same mess of competition with the added layer of the competition trying to kill you as soon as you're vulnerable?
---
I don‚Äôt use a Macro for them, as I just set the fourth pet ability to the Keybind CAPS and have Sac/Seduce/Fel Interrupt in the fourth slot. 
---
However if you want the macro for them all, I believe it‚Äôs just 
---
/cast Seduction
---
/cast Sacrifice
---
/cast Spell Lock
---
But make sure to drop a line on each.
---
Makes sense, but sounds less fun. Case closed for me.
---
Aye, but I'm pretty sure most warriors level arms, and most end game warriors spec for stance mastery.
---
F
---
Your RNG is now a SNG.
---
It's the best.
---
Makes sense actually ill definetly try this when I get home. I also have a tip for warriors. At lvl 30 when you go to fray island you can use demo shout and it will make the fighters run away like theyre feared. Dealing damage will not break the fear. The quest became trivial when I discovered this.
---
I loved twinking I'm the 19 bracket in classic/tbc. One of my favorite i made was a druid Twink with +nature damage on everything. It wasn't the best against hunters, but it absolutely destroyed rogues. Which is all I wanted.
---
Lolno
---
you must have no clue what you're talkinga bout.  imagine thinking tab sundering is how you aoe tank???? what? this is why theres so many warriors posting on reddit HURR GUYS HOW I HOLD AGRO WHEN DPS ATTACK BEFORE GIVING ME 30S TO GET THREAT
---
mailing to an alt and listing it isnt much lost opportunity...
---
31 undead warlock here. Played a NE Priest in the first wow and BC. I'm at a point where I'm being overwhelmed with all the spells available. How do you keep your action bar organized? Any particular add Ons, UI, or method to the madness? I also purchased a razr naga this past week and all of the thumb buttons and have turned my hot keys organization into a mess. Help me out!
---
I thought I remember at one point they turned down the brightness coming from objects including weapon enchants. Enchants haven't been the same since vanilla.
---
I always run without the timer first, get the FP, then do the quest by taking the wind rider. The timer is too stressful.
---
This looks impressive, but will be shirt loved the level of abstraction in WoW is one of the main key ingredients why wow vanilla bus amazing.
---
Gains threat
---
like a true diplomat...
---
I haven't really played warrior ever, but picked it up in Classic. I started getting this feeling and was spamming sunder armor until 5 stacks even in groups, albeit when I'm defensive stance its usually sunder and revenge.
---
!remindme 9 hours
---
I can‚Äôt wait to see all the mages competing for gear at endgame, there‚Äôs way too fucking many of them
---
It's just a stat stick in feral form.  Try [here](https://classic.wowhead.com/off-hand-frills/quality:2:3:4#items:0+2+18).
---
I've literally never seen anyone, ever, be denied a spot in a group of raid due to their race. No one cares. Maybe like top guild on the big servers care, but they also have mandatory play times and run like a part time job so who cares?
---
See, JPJYC sounds way more immersion breaking then BootyBayBluntz.
---
Booty Bay is a crime hub, it's in the lore of the game.
---
I tried the old Macros for this but they aren't working, maybe we can get this going?
---
Board at what lvl then?
---
1 agi is 2 ranged ap for all classes, since we're talking about ranged weapons I thought that was obvious.
---
Warriors have like a base 5%(I forget the exact number) miss chance with a 2h on mobs the same level as you with your weapon skill maxed. Dual-wielding adds **19%** miss chance to that value for a total of 24% chance to miss. This should be self-explanatory. Dual wielding as a warrior doesn't become viable until you have the appropriate hit chance gear for it.
---
They are  it balanced at all lol. I've leveled multiple 30s on both sides lol
---
Scrubs is totalllly another one I watched back then!!! I'll add that to my list.  My best friend who I still play WoW with since 7th grade, showed me first episode of Scrubs I'd ever seen in the same game room that one night we stayed up late talking about World of Warcraft after my cousin told me all about it and we hyped ourselves up before we were able to buy it and start playing.  The hype hasn't died :\*\]
---
I specifically remember the line, "Her ass looks like two pringles hugging" in that first episode and I knew that show was gonna be gold from that moment forward lmao.
---
What's offensive about it
---
Sounds rehearsed.   Vendoring it would be more useful. Plus so would giving it away to the right user. Look just because you found a use for a really bad item for your character doesn't make it reddit worthy. You just look and sound like the ultimate noob/hunter troll.   Look at you trying to  justify yourself lol.
---
Were fans sending him gold?
---
Who the fuck feels energized from some broccoli
---
You know there are raid markers in keybinds right
---
What is water?
---
The nostalgic thing doesn‚Äôt hold true in my case at least, I was too young for vanilla and am a wrath baby. Classic is simply the best in my opinion. It offers things that pretty much no other mmo does today, even over current wow itself
---
I also love my fleshlight wand, it makes the leveling experience so much better.
---
You must be that retard that thinks they knew everything about the game when they were 13 in 2004.
---
No, just that the fear ward is considered most necessary for end game contents rather than casual play and the Nelf and human facials are actually quite nice for solo or leveling play
---
I‚Äôm a simple man as well.  I see that giant goblin deforestation machine, I climb it.
---
One of my friends already rerolled from pala to priest because no one was inviting him to dungeons as Ret. He learned his lesson early but I fear for the ones that make it to 60 still trying to play ret
---
Also have seen a few warriors vehemently refuse to tank and saying you can only tank with points in prot.
---
Not sure, he hasn't said. I'm guessing that he just got bored, combined with lack of time to play (like we used to). He hasn't said that he's quit, he just hasn't logged on at all. xD
---
Thanks for that. I'll Def suss him out when I finish work.
---
He refers to being able to just hover over their portrait or character model and pressing a key to heal them. This can be done with an addon or by making a macro for each of your heals. The following macro should work:
---
    /cast [@mouseover,help][] Heal
---
Just replace with your own heal or buff spells.
---
I agree, tanked all vanilla until end of wrath. The AoE zerg cleave fest in leveling dungeons is really boring and taking away from the fun of tanking and focusing stuff :(. I've just started making groups with hunters and rogues.
---
*GASP* I didn't! That's great to know, thanks.
---
all expansions however where definite downgrades
---
University Ave?
---
Bind it in game. It's a built in feature that saves it to a folder.

It‚Äôs pretty good if you want it as a dessert I think. We have chocolate and caramel popcorn in the states and that‚Äôs nice, but regular popcorn I expect salt instead of sugar

Are you a level 10 undead mage on Herod OP?

I'm asking because I chased one down and /licked them not long before you posted this.

Thanks will check it out!

Ironically, it's not worth it for horde because they have a ridiculously easy quest in Hinterlands that gives a +25 fishing fishing pole (5 better) that alliance still have no equivalent of.
---
End game, definitely. 
---
I've played fury all the way so far. Lvl 40 atm.

Yeah, I would definitely try and communicate with them first before resorting to letting them die.  It's good to educate newer players.  But if they aren't responsive, aren't willing to learn, and act toxic, I begin to get frustrated...

That being said, I have yet to run into any warlocks that are as described in the OP.  Every warlock I've played with has known how to handle themselves.

Brave post
---
You're right, it isn't, and it shouldn't be. I play on moonguard in retail, and deviate Delight in Classic. Sorry, I must have come across as a stickler. I only really meant that in roleplay servers, you're much more likely to have someone approach you in the world in character, and it's something you sort of have to be ready to have happen. I didn't mean to sound so cut and dry.
---
Facials are actually quite nice.
---
But you can easily have groups run off the other faction so you're competing with less people.
---
Yeah I figured lol. 
---
I tried questing there last night on a PvP server. It was rough to say the least
---
Serious question: How does one leave their pets behind like this? Or what else caused these smol friendly boys to be marching along here?  I don't really remember how pets worked back in vanilla.  If anything I maybe had like a parrot from DM or a cat and that was it.
---
Awesome..never noticed the snake before like wth of all things is a snake doing there?
---
The fact you're willing to defend yourself this hard so you can become a huntard... is just.... wow dude.  
---
I literally dont really care anymore. If you want to be a melee hunter and brag about it all day long about how your raptor strike hits harder then your aimed shot.. which is massively SAD btw.  Then hey, who am I to try stop you then right?  
---
You do you bro but personally I find that all... very very retarded but hey that's just my opinion. :)
---
Same
---
I know it feels bad when you're not holding aggro on everything and you're the tank, but honestly at lower levels, your rage generation will suck bad enough that even if the dps hold up, it's just not enough. Also, the mobs aren't going to kill the dps at that level. You just have to swallow your pride a bit at those levels.
---
Once you get into the 40's if the dps are pulling aggro, they'll die. Coincidentally, they'll learn their lesson.
---
I had tried elvui, benkui, and tukui. I've settled on tuki the past few days but it has limited actionbar capability compared to elvui. With elvuk I had tried to make a 3x4 action bar to match the layout of my mouse to have it be more intuitive; it looked so awful. Do you mind posting a screen shot of your elvui? What other addons would you suggest coupled with elvui? I had downloaded necrosis, omnicc, weak auras, some auction house stuff, quest stuff, and man I got a few things that began to overlap and it got out to control. Any advice for a curse/dot timer to use with elvui would be cool! The necrosis one I had to read text and it just wasn't as simple as I needed it.
---
Second topic. I've gone full affliction and was swayed by the drain tanking guide. I am playing solo mostly doing quests and grinding. I'm not good enough with micro and I feel like there may be another build that suits me. The mana/life management with other concerns is a bit too advanced for me. Anything for a more casual approach?
---
When you're high-enough level to get to a neutral auction house, check it for the Cockroach companion. It's only available for Horde to buy in Undercity but you might be able to find some on the auction house in Gadgetzan. Having one as an Alliance is pretty uncommon.
---
Kromcrush is pretty decently split.
---
Today Hillsbrad was entirely owned by Alliance. Yesterday us Horde had control.
---
Nice narration!
---
1 in 10000 isn't .05%, its .01%.
---
For real though, I noticed something neat the other day. I was in Arathi Highlands trying to find Refuge Point and saw a signpost but it only had Tarren Mill and Stormgarde written on it, until a little bit later and a shoddy wooden signpost with Refuge Point written on it leading down a weathered dirt path off the cobble road. Though it was a neat little detail.

Yes, very cool. Reddit is literally show and tell for retards and their safe space PC culture. But guess what? IDGAF. If something looks god awful, like this whatever it is, I'll say what I want. So piss off.
---
I literally had this convo with a friend the other day ‚Äî you can even tell the class design was heavily based off up dnd
---
Quests in classic aren‚Äôt an epic storyline full of action. They‚Äôre used to create the setting, and they do that fantastically if you read the text.
---
I used the crusade to destroy the crusade.
---
Getting the full talent build will help significantly with threat generation, especially for Swipe.
---
They're addons that let you give your charcter more detail that people can read (I actually havent gotten it yet, but I'm told thats how it works).
---
1.13.2 has bad class balance. There's clear superior choices for DPS, tank, and healer for example. Hunter DPS falls off quite a lot.
---
It's a rather monstrous dagger that does a lot, and I mean a lot of damage for a pre-raid item.  Once upon a time before they made a change to how weapon speed worked, the Barman Shanker was actually a better dagger than Perdition's Blade believe it or not.  
---
Of course, there is a downfall to this dagger.  A rather large one.  It has one of those dreaded useless DOT debuffs that causes a paltry amount of damage over 30 seconds.  This makes Gouge/Blinds almost useless and even more it takes up a debuff slot in raids.  But if you want to overlook that and want to see Ambush/Backstabs that at this point in the phase game will nearly auto-delete clothies and leather users like they were butter then the Barman Shanker is a Rogue's best friend. 
---
It is also a very cool weapon model, a broken beer bottle.  I pretend it's the quintessential Dwarf Rogue weapon.
---
You fucking rolled on it, you better be using it.
---
Which they can't use
---
I was forced to rename.. Apparently there are no 'asmrsluts' in azeroth
---
I can't speak for all people or even Metzen, but each one of these quests in vanilla was written by people in the (then) small-ish team working on WoW. He knew each person individually so it's probably a huge dose of nostalgia for him.
---
How did r/wallstreetbets spill over into the Classic WoW subreddit?!
---
The Egg is /u/ItsOppositeDayHere
---
This is the best I've seen it described. Perfectly said.
---
Got disconnected twice while waiting for my friend to finish his RFC run to run with him :/
---
^(I care, i even subscribed)
---
No where balanced on OCE servers in my experience, pvp server I'm on is Dominated by Horde! It's getting to the point where ally will start rerolling or just stop playing, would be good to see active player census..
---
What if they‚Äôre publicly unknown?
---
That's what got me to post this
---
It's great for teaching people about focus (land mines) and when to stop dps (reflect.) Players either get good or get out.
---
Im confused
---
Ayy same server. Wadddup.
---
Sounds like something a Paladin would say.
---
It's hilarious that they don't. Last Uldaman run our mage died twice because he would start casting the moment I charged in, but would still keep ripping threat off me
---
I mean I don't care its not my repair bill, but it's annoying when they start to tilt and flame as if it's my fault
---
The Horde has run so much train on my asshole trying to get into SM that its sucking buttermilk.
---
Yes, I think it might be a layering issue, seems like layers are collapsing and recreating at a strange rate. I've found that I can't find a new layer when around mobs like that.
---
As a destruction (seduction-soulfire) warlock I have to say I absolutely hate druids because seduction doesn't work on them. I'm sure you're right when it comes to other warlock builds though.
---
No, you should be selling them.
---
Wait till BGs come out. I have a few lv19 twink items I‚Äôm still holding onto.
---
Yeah.... I'm level 32/2 days played.  I don't know how that compares but I barely do dungeon runs. I've done some quests for top weapons and armor while leveling, but I have just straight grinded mobs that drop high value crafting items and greys for the last 14 levels. Idk if it's efficient time wise but I feel rich for my level and can almost afford my mount. Already. I hear it only gets better mid 30s for gold generation.
---
Yea I was wondering, in the retail wow they have a melee hunter I forget what...I noticed you can cherry pick your cpass specialties...Is that still correct?
---
You had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôve been doing this but since it didn‚Äôt say so in the description, I wasn‚Äôt super convinced it was working that well. Good to hear I was wrong cause that‚Äôs super helpful.
---
Judging by that tree I'd say you guys tried to raid XR and aggroed the guards. This was probably 30 seconds after that happened.
---
Cuz
---
My best friend that I played vanilla with tanked through Nax as Druid. We were lucky enough to be in seemingly the only guild that was willing to allow it, and he was by far the best tank we had. 
---
Feral Tanks are completely viable in Vanilla, the only issue was people being thick-headed and believing that only warriors could tank. 
---
Feral's biggest downside was being super gear-dependent because you needed the rings and the other items with bonus armor.
---
I wonder how its NSFW
---
Damnit... When's the event live til?
---
Jordan as in michael jordan?
---
100% this. People(myself included) chose whatever server didn't have insanely long queues. It should tell you the rules, especially the one for names because I had no idea there were any
---
Yep I love it
---
I feel like retail is like playing a game and classic is like living in a game
---
Ah yes, Americans. Typical.
---
Yeah. Herod at peak in barrens is so fun. I want to experience as much high crazy population as i can while the game is so fresh.
---
I have a wolf named ‚ÄúWolfie‚Äù originally had a boar named the same but finally was able to get to a better zone with nice looking Wolves to get!
---
Then why don‚Äôt you ask for an invite to a new layer then? When that happens I just hop layers and it‚Äôs usually empty
---
I'm gonna buy a Bluetooth keyboard/mouse :) should work the same
---
Big True
---
I'm a fucking healer btw.
---
I heal locks lifetapping because I always have spare mana because I'm not a shitty healer.
---
I mean, being flagged for a name change is as far as the punishments ever go. You're not going to be banned for an RP unfriendly name (unless it's also deeply offensive) so no need to fret about it, and there's no real need to stress out. Though it wouldn't hurt to have a name in your back pocket, just in case.
---
When it comes to Humans in Fantasy, there is no topping LoTR...and generally that‚Äôs a rule of thumb with most fantasy elements to be honest.
---
MUDA.
---
That‚Äôs like, your opinion. Ima need you to go YouTube Vurtne destroying locks in vanilla. Lmao
---
Why can't you fuck off and let people play how they want to play? Stop trying to gatekeep. Thanks.
---
So is that Azeroth on the inside of the gate? What is the area on the side of the gate you are looking into it from?
---
In Westfall at the lighthouse is a ghost who gives a quest that rewards a torch. I always keep that torch in my bag and swap my weapon out in dark places.
---
The quest is called The Coastal Menace and the item is Grayson's Torch. It has a real bright lighting effect. Level 15 minimum to pick up the quest. Horde and Ally can get the quest.
---
Thanks man problem solved.
---
I‚Äôve been doing that religiously. Even then I have DPS doing Earthshock, attacking something else. Heck, even had a couple of Druids switch to bear for. It worked out okay after I bought a slightly better weapon from the AH but man that was rough.
---
LUDAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
I made a horde character. Leveled it a bit. Took it to Undercity and got the cockroach. Made another character, took him to Booty Bay. Mailed cockroach to Booty Bay character. Posted on neutral AH for 200g. Bought it with my alliance character. Then used that 200g to arbitrage between auction houses and get other Horde only items.
---
 Might is probably better for anyone melee and Wisdom may be better for anyone ranged.
---
I lol‚Äôd
---
Time to work on alts!
---
You‚Äôre playing the game exactly as intended when you hop layers to get new spawns. That‚Äôs literally what‚Äôs it‚Äôs there for
---
How about no changes.
---
Dead servers on retail are truly truly dead. I'd gamble 95%+ of the retail WoW population is on the same 10 servers, for US at least. Even in Wrath my "small" server felt huge with people, always new guilds popping up, available raid teams. It won't be an issue in classic.
---
Have them on separate lines, or as it's shown above?
---
Thunder Bluff is a really cool city too, it's just unfortunate that there's not much reason to visit it
---
bOtH sIdEs ArE ThE sAmE!!
---
sorry
---
Honestly it's perfect. Weight, size, feel, customization. Only thing I didn't like was the cord. Now there's a wireless version. Next buy.
---
This is all personal opinion, but I feel it depends on how you group (PUG, Guild of new folks, experienced folks, are they impatient, etc...).  My personal opinion is around 36-40 depending on what talents you want to pick up on the way.  
---
You're giving up some damage by going into defensive stance, so you need to make up for it through a liberal application of defiance.
---
For PUG groups, you want at least 17 points in Protection; that gives you more chances at passively blocking an attack (proccing revenge), Iron Will, and Improved Bloodrage for earlier threat generation; Defiance 5/5 for more threat, and improved taunt to drop the cooldown by 2 seconds...
---
because even with all of the above, you're going to spend some time pulling npc's off pc's.
---
From there, you can take 10 points and spend them EITHER in Fury (Crit chance and unbridled wrath) Or Arms Deflection (procs revenge) and 5/5 tactical mastery.  That would put you at lvl 36 for a sword and board approach.  That doesn't mean you can't do it sooner, but it would be a tactical application of "in this case I'm going to go sword and board" as opposed to it being the norm.  
---
From there, if you really get great at shield bashing and want to walk further down the tree; I would take a pause on protection, and go down Fury (or Arms, whichever one you didn't go down before) and pick up what you left there.  That's 10 more levels.  
---
Beyond that, if your goal is to end-game tank, then start going deep into prot and learn to love stance dancing and a lot of the prot abilities.  You'll want to grab improved sunder 3/3, Improved Shield Block, Concussive Blow, Imp Shield Bash 2/2, One handed Spec 4, and Shield Slam.
---
Or don't.  YMMV.  I feel that must-haves past the lvl 36 ones are at least Improved Shield Block 2/3, Improved Sunder Armor, Improved Shield Bash 2/2.  
---
Shield Slam is the Rage Dump of Prot Tanking, but holy hell does it generate threat.  Last Stand can pull your ass out of a fire but your healers better be on their game after that.  Improved Revenge is gimmicky.  You stunning a melee mob does not contribute to your rage generation.  Shield Bash is awesome, and silencing a caster is a great way to kite an NPC away from pathing NPC's...  
---
AND rolling through battlegrounds as an unkillable tower of iron who smashes gnome casters in the face with your shield and watch them silently scream while the group of screaming bloodthirsty savages using you as their personal vanguard comes up and dissects them in alphabrutical fashion...  is pretty fucking awesome.  
---
You won't wreck house in Battlegrounds, but you'll be loved by your side.
---
I've been thinking about that! Wondering if I'll have better luck on the lower level quests now that most people have gotten past that.
---
Me too! Liking it so far
---
I always loved that about Gadgetzan!  Great idea for booty bay too
---
The number 69 is a meme. The usual response is "nice"
---
I just had a flashback to watching my friend play at a sleepover at 3 am and hearing that dumb sound they made.
---
SquadW
---
Tame different ones first, to learn higher ranks and different abilities.
---
Then you can settle on one.
---
Leave 1 stable slot open to put your main pet in there for when you need to go another round of taming for ranks.
---
Heroic Strike also generates threat so it‚Äôs good for tanking.
---
Yeah, I just watched this at work.
---
Is it easier to get on retail? I remember i got one after about 45 minutes of camping the spawns a few years ago
---
It‚Äôs a nice damn feeling huh?
---
Taunt increase your threat value on the target to double of what it is currently targeting.  Has no effect if its already targeting you.
---
Create a new macro:
---
#showtooltip Arcane Shot (Rank X)
---
/target Kobold Geomancer
---
/cast Arcane Shot (Rank X)
---
Replace ‚ÄúX‚Äù with your spell rank number, replace ‚ÄúKobold Geomancer‚Äù with your desired target name.  Put this macro on a key you can spam.  Use mousewheel up and down if you wanna really tag that mob.
---
PREACH.
---
Alright Stannis
---
TBC doesn't have a *lot* of the kinds of changes people really object to.
---
Make the zones a bit smaller to compensate for eliminating flying and do something about the daily quests. Personally I like have a set of quests to do every day so long as they aren't too time consuming so I vote to keep them but to not make them mandatory by providing alternative ways to gain reputation. This doesn't apply to those stupid flying/bombing quests. Those need to go. 
---
But that's about it. It wouldn't be hard making a Classic+ version of TBC content.
---
No worries :) yeah, a lot of my friends look at RP servers and go "oh, so that's where all the creepy goldshire stuff happens?" And they miss out on all the really fun in-character interaction that playing on an RP server can bring
---
You die, you wait for rez. Healer dies and you get to corpse run.

---
*FROST MAGES UNITE*
---
Try a few shakes of curry powder and the same amount of turmeric the next time you try it.  You'll never go back, I promise.
---
I feel like slam is extremely underrated.. With improved slam and stacking rage to 45 and then going for 3 quick slams is really really good damage... Compared to anything else prior to having gear/MS
---
I mean those abilities were just removed in bfa. I sincerely feel like barely any new players tried wow in bfa and the ones that did probably barely tried classic or didn‚Äôt try it at all. Anyone that played before bfa played with those spells in game.
---
 "You pull it, you tank it."
---
"Let them die."
---
"I don't heal DPS that pull aggro."
---
"I asked the DPS to wait and they didn't so I decided to sit there and let them tank the dungeon if they want to tank so badly."
---
That is Vanilla tho...that what we wanted, and thats how the game used to be... DPS gotta learn..
---
Chances are youll just need a guild to do raids, and pugs wont be an option (just like in regular old vanilla)
---
please don't cleave when tanking
---
Are you providing _my_ water to heal your lifetaps? 
---
If there's no mage in the group and I wasn't able / ran out of magewater, inconsiderate lifetap warlocks literally cost me money.
---
Was it a horde in a disguise? I think the savory deviant delight transforms you to a human
---
You can spam hamstring to get overpower procs
---
If you can, play on the Chinese servers, the latency is great. There are many expats that play in China.
---
Nice setup!!
---
Yo dawg, I heard you like maul, so I put maul in your maul so you can maul while you maul
---
Getting on a shared boat on a pvp server can get pretty intense.
---
Considering MMOs before WoW only had maybe 10-20 quests max, all the quests in wow were supposed to do were get you grinding and exploring with a little lore added in.
---
we out here living the night shift life
---
....or be run off by the other faction so you‚Äôre the one who has to leave.
---
I don't! I also plan on doing tailoring as well but I've no experience in that either. Also I tried my best to google but it's a bit hard to separate old &amp; new WoW, thanks for the link!
---
I was also mainly asking for which companions are sought after &amp; are perhaps enjoyable to obtain compared to others, and any strategies for obtaining them.
---
use it .
---
i don't sell gear i roll need for.. and since you rolled need why would you sell it?
---
I keep getting heals while I'm trying to eat and drink, Priest is then OOM and the party is waiting on them because they aren't paying close enough attention to me balancing out my health and mana, then eating and drinking for the quickest recovery. I have like 600 health and 1200 mana, so I tap that up as much as I can then eat and drink so I have like 10 seconds of drink time instead of 20.
---
&gt;or you don't understand why they are there.
---
You seem to not have any idea what a tank is there for lol.
---
There are two modes of tanking you do depending on group composition.
---
The first mode is a group with non-aoe classes, most of whom don't use mana. In this group comp you should be going from single pack to single pack with almost no downtime. Mark a skull for the dps to burst down while you get aggro on the other packs and the healer can drink after every pull for the first 10-15 seconds of the pull - meaning no stopping for mana.
---
The other mode is a group with aoe classes, who generally always use mana. In this comp your main job is to gather up all the mobs into one tight pack, get enough aoe threat that heals don't pull, and then just let the dps go crazy as soon as the mobs are in a pile. You don't need to do anything else because the mobs will be CC'd by the aoe and will be dead before any ranged dps have a problem. Your only other job is to make sure you are taunt and tanking any problem mobs or anything escaping the ball of aoe.
---
Tanks are absolutely vital to an efficient dungeon run, they just don't have the same role they do in retail, where you just automatically have threat on everything.
---
But I don‚Äôt speak cat so he can‚Äôt tell me what his name is. Would be disrespectful to call him by the wrong name the whole time.
---
hello ol' chum
---
Boring.
---
It does, either a human pirate or ninja.
---
You are asking them to change their playstyle for you too though. Nothing wrong with playing what you like but it may affect others too.
---
Hydra shock? My old buddy is that you?
---
 .
---
I'm a priest and I disagree. Life tap away boys.
---
Ah yes. And the caves that are copy pasta'd to half the areas.
---
Loving my Fleshlight wand!
---
That is some serious dedication. I want to rep the cockroach so badly, I'll definitely be looking to pick it up on the AH. But it'll be a long way before I'll be at that point.
---
You are literally complaining about things that were changed / fixed.
---
The vanilla dev team had many ideas that were not fully fleshed out when the game was originally released, including class design not being balanced or in the place they wanted them to be. 
---
Going back to classic means, going back to how it originally was, the devs aren't going in trying to make a fair and balanced game. Heck they aren't even making a game they've simply released one that people want. 
---
Stupid post imo
---
Love this post and it is exactly how i am going to play wow classic.
---
Report it and move on.
---
Fair but it's been a nice give/take flow in my server.
---
&gt; Taunt increase your threat value on the target to double of what it is currently targeting.
---
dafuq lol no
---
How would we know?
---
No... That's not how this works lol. You don't get into a raid group and tell the tank "we're gonna play how I want to play fuck u"
---
You can soft boil it before throwing it in but mostly I just crack an egg and drop it right in and from there I sometimes mix it or I'll leave it to form
---
What do you mean? Raids take around 7 resto druids because they're the best raid healers! Oh wait now I remember, they take shaman healers because they're not garbage
---
Is the majority of the game written in Chinese? I can‚Äôt read it yet I‚Äôve only lived here one year :(
---
Or orb of deception
---
I see you don't PvP very much.
---
Conversely, it makes BfA look more like a kiddy-pop arcade game, and nothing like an RPG.
---
why does this not surprise me...
---
My name was Cnut like the old Danish name ca‚Äônoot. But I got flagged. Thank god though. After 15 levels I hated the name. Got a free name change.
---
I was feared into an SM instance and ended up stuck in a chair inside the instance with an Alliance group. We were all stuck and the Paladin eventually killed me with consecration. 
---

Because the chair was in a corner you could swivel the camera and see through the walls as well. Not sure what they did after they killed me. Probably were still stuck inside the chair.
---
Got another reply saying horde gets a better pole from a quest, so apparently not for them. For alliance though I think it's one of the better ones.
---
Why do walking skeletons need to eat or drink anything? They don‚Äôt even have the organs to extract nutritional value from food
---
Actually was wondering :P
---
Do you have any Tipps on how to AoE Threadgeneration against bombing Frostmages or other Ravager-Warriors etc.
---
How dafuq are you supposed to keep aggro on 8+ targets when your team is spraying into them?
---
My taunt shout has 10min CD... do I have anything   else or do I need to equip Ravager from SM myself?
---
Yeah that was probably a solid 4 hour process, if not longer. The real benefit was being able to arbitrage items from the Horde AH.
---
You're wrong.... you'll find that taunt literally does nothing if the mob is already attacking you.
---
Hopefully it‚Äôs a momentary problem then
---
Because it's a good game.  Most people aren't stuck in 2003.  Wind Waker is beautiful tbh.
---
What about privately unknown
---
It‚Äôs probably true. It‚Äôs not something a troll would make up. What if I told you that Nihilum didn‚Äôt use any voice till Sunwell. You‚Äôd think I‚Äôm trolling but it‚Äôs true.
---
sounds like a lonely sad person IRL to have such a control complex in a video game...
---
I mean 60-40 sounds pretty standard, Horde just tends to be more popular for whatever reason. I'm on Yojamba and I still see plenty of Ally, we still have some great Wpvp fairly evenly balanced
---
&gt; I as a healer won't even have to drink.
---
Okay and what are you doing with all that extra mana? Surely you don't do enough dps to make up for the time wasted halting 3 other player's dps so the tank can have aggro on everything?
---
&gt;If a pull goes wrong (or "right" according to you) I will be drinking every pull.
---
If you aren't drinking after every pull as a healer you are doing it wrong. If you have excess mana, you should be using it to dps more.
---

You gotta watch out for Sparkles Hellborer. His first name was given, but his last name was _earned_.

Alright sensei i will
---
I dont think it's been mentioned but the single most important factor is that yellow hits cant be glancing blows.  This is huge for boss fights since they're level 63 (where your glancing blows deal something like 40% less damage with 300 weapon skill).  
---
Or maybe its 40% chance to glance?  Whatever the math, it's horrible for a tank to lose that much threat since it slows the entire raid DPS down and makes the fight long and difficult and this is the single most important use of heroic strike.
---
No one is willing to implement these changes because this is how the game was when it ended and moved onto BC. 
---
Blizzard aren't going to make these changes because then it wouldn't be classic, it'd be classic content with say BC tuning and class design. 
---
People would fuuucking hate if blizzard changed one class to how it is down the road because one person complained about it... 
---
You do realize these things were complained about 14+ years ago and fixed right?
---
I got silenced for like a day too but I made a ticket to a GM and they reversed it, because it's just the automated system when you get reported X amounts of times that gets you silenced. It's not actually against their policy.
---
On a related note, fuck people who report Trivia Bot.
---
To be fair, trying to level in a zone like Searing Gorge, where you're too high for other zones but too low for WPLs, Felwood, etc is bloody frustrating.  
---
I was there last night and legit there was not a single mob alive wherever I went bar some elites. I got ganked over and over and failed to get even one quest done before logging off in frustration. Logged on this morning early before work and it was SO much better. I got more done in 20 mins before I had to leave than I did in two hours the day before. Now I really understand why people dungeon farm, its just hell to try and level 'the right way'.
---
My words to boss exactly!
---
Some kind stranger gave me 1 gold for naming my Raptor "PepeHands" he said it made him laugh.
---
Server feels so dead on Alliance side.
---
I think the issue is layering. Sometimes you‚Äôll just be on a layer with 100 horde, other times with 100 ally, it‚Äôs very weird. Just have to wait and see how it plays out in phase 2
---
What is phase 2?
---
Is it really that far fetched? I'm a cow with full battle gear on, flying a wind rider right now.
---
I think in those cases it's that the gameplay is dated hard, even worse than wow. Sure, this autoattacking and drinking after every fight is tedious, but how about stopping to engage in some random encounter that takes 30 seconds and chops off a decent portion of some important party member's hp every *few steps*. "Oh look a chest over there in the corner" enjoy 13 random encounters trying to reach it. Once you get there it's a single antidote. Now all you party members are at &lt;60% hp and you need to walk back to the save point to consume a tent to heal. Rinse and repeat 4-5 times each dungeon.
---
Wot?
---
Well then I think ill just beg a friend to play with me, I've payed a lot more for a lot less. Time to give it a shot!
---
Same. I started WoW as a Dwarf warrior. I'm doing this time around as an Orc shaman. I didn't start playing Horde until after Cata and even that was really casual, so I'm getting to actually experience something new.
---
For purely AOE, I chose this and didn't respec again until 60 with SM/Ruin.
---
I went down the Destro tree:
---
5 into Cataclysm&gt;5 Aftermath&gt;5 Devastation&gt;2 Intensity&gt;Back up and 3 into Bane&gt;2 into Pyroclasm&gt;1 into Ruin&gt;2 more into Bane&gt;5 into Emberstorm.
---
Then into Demo tree:
---
5 into Demonic Embrace&gt;2 into Imp Healthstones.
---
After that you can do whatever. I decided to work down the Demo tree to get Fel Dom and Master Summoner so I could get my VW out faster, which leads to less downtime summoning him and drinking in between pulls, which led to faster pulling. 
---

I'll never understand how some people feel so entitled to other player's character abilities. They cannot force someone to do something for them. Anything someone else does is an act of kindness and NOT to be assumed or expected. It's fucking human decency.
---
This thread is ridiculous. Not everyone is people who were hyped and planning from day one or teenagers who see each other every day or .
---
Additionally, some of us don't really have a schedule that is friendly to huge as queues that aren't improving and are basically just not playing anymore since the choice seems to be 90 minute queue,dead server, or reroll with the little free time we have.
---
Do you mean Decamp &amp; melderon TV? I have watch heaps of their videos about shaman and are very informative. But in one of the videos he mentions that shaman is not really main healer for pve that's what worried me.
---
Im gonna buy it and try and persuade a friend or two to play with me, everyone looks like theyre having a blast

Yes pls! Even if it's on this subreddit. There are a few meme worthy screenshots already!

What is the wow world goes similar to the real world and memes became a thing? Back in the day in our world there were no meme names.

Yeah if you are like lvl 30-40 aoe farming two weeks in on a full server you kind of deserve it.

Okay I'm gonna add it to my list, gives me something to do while I AFK other MMO's lol

If you're talking about arugal, highest queue time iv seen in a while was 800, and most of the time no queue at all, so i wouldnt worry. Yojamba is the next populated OCE server so i'd bounce between those two.
---
Yep. But I thought I'd share and hope to get a laugh with you guys.
---
Hey look, I get it man, you're just looking for numbers, not members of a guild built upon interpersonal connections beyond some witty one liner and a edgy guild name you copy paste after every 3 mobs you kill. I bet you even walk into a quest hub, see people without a guild and hit your spam and run away.

Read the fucking tooltip.

We have alot of options for Pre-BIS. I chose not to go with all High Council of SW gear, as I like alot of the other gear found in Strat, Scholo, UBRS, LBRS and BRD. 
---
Here's more or less what i'm going with, obviously it's Subjective, I chose some of these based on what I already have:
---
MH- Witchblade-Scholo / Vocal Sword-Mara
---
OH- Drakestone of Shadow Wrath-Sunken Temp / Spirit of Aquamentos-Ungoro quest chain
---
Staff- Solstice Staff of Shadow Wrath / Staff of Jordan
---
Neck- Star of Mystaria- Strat Live / Dark Advisor‚Äôs Pendant- Scholo
---
Head- Green Lens of Shadow Wrath- Engineering
---
Shoulders- Burial Shawl-Scholo / High Councilors of Shadow Wrath
---
Chest- Robes of the Void / Robes of Winter‚Äôs Night
---
Bracers- Flameweave Cuffs of Shadow Wrath- Incendius BRD / Magisters Bindings
---
Hands- Hands of Power- Quartermaster LBRS / Atal‚Äôai Gloves of Shadow Wrath- Sunken Temp.
---
Pants- Skyshroud Leggings- LBRS
---
Boots- Maleki‚Äôs Footwraps / Omnicast Boots
---
Cloak - Spritecasters Cape- BRD / Archivists Cape or Shadow Wrath- Strat Live.
---
Ring- Eye of Org(Horde)/Songstone of Ironforge(Ally)- BRD quest
---
Ring- Maiden‚Äôs Circle(BoE) / Underworld Band
---
Trinket- Eye of the Beast- UBRS quest
---
Trinket- Briarwood Reed- Jed- UBRS
---
Wand- Skul‚Äôs Ghastly Touch- Strat Live / Bonecreeper Stylus- Scholo
---
Do it.
---
Yea it's like the stupid arena comp names people made up. Like "beast cleave" and "dot cleave".
---
Hahahaha
---
MB &gt; swp &gt; flay &gt; touch of weakness/inner fire/vamp &gt; MB &gt; wand. 2 seconds on spirit tap start Mind Blast on the next mob.
---
I find this to be the most efficient when I grind. Sometimes i dont do the 2nd MB to conserve mana.  The 4th spell is filler waiting for MB cd, i cast these between pulls if i dont reach the next mob before spirit tap runs out. Otherwise i cast them in combat to not waste tine between pulls or cut tap short.
---
Not to mention RFK isn't a good one to farm.
---
Just anecdotally, I have a difficult time believing that's accurate. Maybe with lower level characters, but anything over level 30 seems completely dominated by Horde. Like, I'll go over an hour without seeing another Alliance player in a zone.
---
I started blasting off in xp/h at 30 due to sm spam. I‚Äôve always loved dungeons way more than questing and it‚Äôs better xp.
---
Depends on my mood, if Im having fun grinding out quests ill leave alliance alone but every now and then I enjoy fearing one into a pack of mobs and watching them get eaten to shreds while i eat popcorn.

I‚Äôve made tons selling bags but that only reliably works for the brand new servers.  I sold line bags for 10s at launch... such a ripoff but it was supply and demand
---
That only accounts characters over level 5 but maybe
---
Blizz works case by case I believe. The rules are guidelines for the players but they can do whatever they want. If enough people report you, they would probably take action against you.
---
good idea, hadnt thought of parking a max lvl
---
I didn‚Äôt know Ron Jeremy played WoW.
---
Also got to factor in people are going to constantly bouncing around not only servers but factions as well. Any data pulled is probably only relevant for that moment and different the next.
---
Worry about you, boo
---
Besides, it‚Äôs to be expected. The horde are a plague of sorts and seem to multiply rapidly.
---
The people that quit, have already planned they will. What excuse they decide to roll with is honestly irrelevant.
---
Which is another point. The ratio we see now is certainly far from where it will be down the road.

Thanks for posting my new wallpaper!  :-)
---
Haven't played it personally, but I've seen a few hours of gameplay and I'm not a fan of the look of the game nor the perceived gameplay loop
---
Kings is better for every melee. Mages would prefer kings over wis as well as some healers. A flat 10% to stats is insanely power in raid gear.
---
Okay well thank you for the response. Im gonna go ahead and give it a shot and see if I can get a few friends to join along. I've always liked the idea and now that Classic is out I think its a good time. Thanks again :)
---
Stun, immobilize, /lick, run
---
Yeah this. I like progress. The fastest way to progress is the most fun for me. Obviously I don't dream of farming the same dungeon over and over again, but I love seeing my power rise.
---
What‚Äôs the Buffett event?  Is that horde only or have I missed something?
---
&gt;  to compensate for eliminating flying
---
Personally I don't think there was anything wrong with flying in BC and Wrath as the zones were built around it.
---
This happened to me walking back from RFK! Was walking to Camp Tarajo to log out in an inn, and there was a single skull level guy just standing on the single road leading to the camp, killing everyone. He killed me and laughed on my corpse. Little did he know he did me a huge favor because the gy is right next to the camp, so he saved me a good couple of minutes.
---
Well what I‚Äôm doing is leveling arms. You get much needed utility talents like tactical mastery and anger management that make warrior smooth. Plus you‚Äôll get the damage to power through leveling.
---
Having a bad day, pal?
---
Here's what i'm going for on my Pre-BIS. Alot of the stuff I got while simple XP farming BRD/LBRS:
---
Head- Green Lens of Shadow Wrath
---
shameful, as a horde I tend to get a lot more friendly love from the alliance layers, I guess players that are attracted to alliance are generally less aggressive people. Or maybe they just know that if they kill you hordies tend to group and and gank you for hours.
---
What's wrong with that though? I can't believe how many 42s whisper me to go to it because "they have a quest there" and get pissed I don't want 42s with a 47 boss. Even 43 is fine to me, but 42s do basically no damage around the end of that place and it sucked when I was lower level too (44 first went there).
---
Alone with my turtles...ahh, the great outdoors
---
Looks like one of asmongolds raids lol.
---
Consider the following:
---
&gt;What timed run?
---
it's for one of the quest chains that ask you to explore the Oasis pools. Quest giver is an undead in Crossroads and I think you might have to be min level 15 or 16. You have to collect 6x spores for him from the mushrooms that grow by the oasis pools. When you turn it in, you then have a timed run to get to Thunder Bluff with the spores. It's a 45 minute timer, there's plenty of time to get there even if you get a bit lost along the way.
---
Well.... gnome...
---
In retail, the hunter's survival talent tree is melee oriented. In classic, this is not the case.
---
Your talent specialization has a large impact on your play style, but a larger one for hybrid classes (classes that can perform multiple roles of tanking/healing/dpsing) All rogues go stabby stab, but their specializations change what weapons and abilities they use for it. A shaman has one spec each for healing/melee/caster, which makes a much larger difference to playstyle.
---
So yes it is still correct, but it can be difficult to compare specs or retail and classic since there's over a decade of evolution to consider (current talent trees in classic don't don't exist at all in retail, but the replacement system still uses the same names.)
---
Screenshots aren't legit with screen door.
---
Not a chance, having a blast with classic and even if it sucked and wasn't like it was in 04 for me, I would still play it over shittail
---
&gt; In Classic, I truly do what I want. Abandon quests, grind mobs for a few levels, do a dungeon that rewards barely any xp but will make me feel strong for a few levels with all the gear. I do what the fuck I want. 
---
Pretty sure you can do all that in retail too...
---
No not really, if you are grinding in appropriate areas you can easily level in the same amount of time or less than questing. What a lot of people don't factor in is travel time at later levels to new places to quest and turn ins. In two hours grinding I got half a level at 53. Depending on the zone I might not get that much in the same amount of time. Some people find they enjoy a mix of both. By grinding on their way to objectives and back.
---
Doesn‚Äôt MC have a different lockout to regular raids?
---
My Pre-BIS list. Obviously subjective and can be filled with .. of the Shadow Wrath gear, but what fun is that. 
---
After going back to classic I realized why it was I fell in love with D&amp;D a few years back. I was missing this feeling. So good to be home.
---
&gt; uncanny valley
---
Not at all what the conversation is about?
---
Bro you're not even 92 yet
---
I personally just use Siphon Life on all targets and drain life if needed and just tell the healer to ignore me life tapping and only to heal me if it isn‚Äôt going to affect their mana too badly or hurt the group because they are healing me instead of tank and stuff, if you have siphon up on 3 targets it actually does decent healing.
---
Would be interesting to see someone do some actual testing of this for once instead of just constantly regurgitating stuff they hear from other people.
---
The lore hasn't been revised and doesn't directly contradict itself. It's woven in everything we partake in, from The Master's Glaive in Darkshore, to the Sunken Temple of Atel'Hakkar in Swamp of Sorrows. Not only that, but some of the lore would only be revealed in expansions, making older content STILL relevant to the story.
---
Big iron fishing pole also spawns from them. I collected over 200 shellfish as alliance only to delete them as they arent even vendor able.

&gt; So, the next time an Item he needed was up for roll, I rolled need with him to increase the chances of him getting it
---
This is a dog move no matter how you slice it, and you knew it before you did it.  
---
You were trying to cheat the game to get your friend an item he wouldn't normally get.  
---
Then you come here make out like you broke an "unwritten rule", it's fucking obvious that you broke a rule on purpose.

Ayy, classics gonna be a blast with this crew.  Ony next!

Double down and lick them. They're probably gonna kill you anyway.

How do you have details on what botnet they vere using??

Not my intention to shame, just thought it was funny.

This is nonsense.

If it's like on retail - they sit there forever
---
Ok
---
im only playing it because other people are playing it, if it was dead like all the other mmos i wouldnt even touch it, also being wow helps
---
Getting to use an extra ability that also let's you generate more rage to use more abilities isn't fun? OK.
---
Im pretty sure you can buy the monthly subscription and have access to it. Just make sure on the launcher it says classic wow..
---
lol no. US uses far far far more resources than any of those.

there's a cave in wetlands that bridges the gap with irridium or something like that. it's great for alliance

---
Oh I know, a lot of people that post chat stuff blur out the names for the rule, regardless.
---
I don‚Äôt understand?
---
2 mobs and 2 druids would probably kill you in a druid stun, elite or not.
---
The lowest the rogue would have been is 29ish, at 29 you still have 1200 hp, which is more health than the WW axe does damage, unless you got two enraged crits, and intercept stun is shorter than 2 swings of WW also.
---
The above commentor has been cleaved for claiming that Saurfang can be parried. He would shatter any blade that tried to parry him, its wielder, and their entire faction for good measure.
---
Nah man, you take mob back to the tank then frost nova. Make sure to talk to the mob like a child that's gotta away from their parent. 
---
"Come on lil guy, let's take you back to the tank."
---
*Frost Nova*
---
"Now stay here buddy, the big bear will take care of you now"
---
*run back to casting position*

Ok. Pardon my ignorance, but what rules from where are you referring to?

Lol rip. I meant rest.

What about Trale Lewous?

you ever just sort of follow a non skinner around while he kills beasts? You'll kill one, skin yours, skin his, skinn the one he's now finished, follow him to his next one, oh wait wasn't i supposed to be finding Ringo?

Woven-In maybe but not always executed well in its attempt.

Humans in theory should be able to heal more because of extra 5% spirit with the talent that increases healing based on spirit. Also, MP5 is  slightly better. In the end, play which one you can stare at the longest and the animations that appeal to you.

A wild weeb has been spotted (^_^*)

Otherwise it just cleans up the presentation since they already ported an old game to a widescreen resolution and changed the entire UI up in order to format it to your screen.

Option 3: get a lock and 3 mages. Who needs a tank

Why are locks second to last

For karma on Reddit , I guess .

Nope

Right, because RP is all about spending your time reporting people and filtering out l33t kiddies.
---
To clarify what others have said: originally in Vanilla, Ironforge was the de facto Alliance capital, because it contained the only auction house. Everyone was there and Stormwind was practically a ghost town. In Classic, which is based on 1.12, all of the cities have auction houses, so that changed things somewhat. 
---
I always found this to be a strange asymmetry: on the Horde side, Orgrimmar had the auction house, which made sense, as it is the Horde capital story-wise. On Alliance, Stormwind is the real capital as far as lore/story, but IF was the functional capital.
---
I'm pretty sure there's one called enemy cast bar.
---
Now we just need Vivec and Almalexia and it's a party.  And Juub of course.
---
You actually nailed the character to race match-up perfectly! 
---
Never realised Arthur looks so much like a troll.
---
Mostly confusion, it seems.
---
Yeah but don't bitch when someone ninja loots because running with randoms you kind of deserve it.
---
Haven‚Äôt seen it at all either, for what it‚Äôs worth. Grobbulus here
---
Great reasoning
---
Use Joanas guide
---
It's all just a huge learning curve my dude. Once you're familiar with it, it will feel like your playing Beethoven's piano concerto number 5 when stance dancing. Also, always use a two hander. You triple the amount of threat you gain, as well as doing more than that as dps (mob dies quickly, less healing needed for the overall fight).
---
If you're early level, you're going to have a pretty tough time holding agro on more than 3 mobs. As mentioned below, demo shout and tab targeting sunder armour is your bread and butter. Thunder clap is good for that instant threat generation, but in my opinion, demo shout, battle shout and sunder are your go to's. 
---
Now, when you get sweeping strikes and whirlwind, the game changes completely (this is where stance dancing comes into play heavily). My rotation to hold AOE agro is as follows; If safe to do so I will charge, then demo shout. Immediately I'll swap to zerker stance and pop beserker rage and swap back to battle and pop sweeping strikes. Swap back to zerker, pop blood rage and then pop whirlwind. After this, pop defensive stance and tab target sunders on the most appropriate targets (As well as cleave if you have leftover sweeping strikes left over). Watch when the enemy dodges and swap into battle stance for some yummy overpower crits (if specced into it) and throw in revenges and battle shouts when needed.
---
Only use taunt when a mob leaves you, and don't be afraid to pop battle stance to use mocking blow.  My challenging shout is always on cool down as well (I'll pull a big pack at the beginning and use cooldowns such as retaliation too). 
---
Tanking in vanilla is ridiculously fun. You'll have the most actions per minute if you're stance dancing accordingly. You'll have so much rage to play with as well, unlike the other poor dps warriors in your group, ha.
---
Good luck my friend, and I hope you smash it all the way to 60! Sorry for the wall of text, I hope this helps.

What is TC here?

I tried Azeroth autopilot, didn‚Äôt like it to much. I‚Äôm now using guidelime off twitch and it‚Äôs good far lvl 46

Right but it's already being calculated in code so it's not difficult to get a computational model of different scenarios. Not that theorycrafting for leveling even has to go that in depth
---
Murlocks = warlock murloc?
---
I'm so sad that I vendored that lantern. :'&lt; I didn't realize this until I saw a post about it 2 days after I did the quest.
---
That‚Äôs why you use Aux
---
except if you abandon quests in retail then you miss out on the faction rep, which you need to buy those vendor item upgrades, which you need to increase your ilvl, which you need to get into dungeon finder.  you also need the quests to get that faction completion achievement which you need to unlock world quests and flying later on.

I will try again tonight as I would like to play horde on there. Are you Oceania too?
---
Just right click report. You don't even have to type anything into the box. I reported a name shortly after launch. The dude was in my party and disconnected literally seconds after I reported and his name changed to a placeholder in the party frame. A lot of times in WoW people seem to think reporting doesn't work or that someone else will report, and that's literally how people get to max level with bad names. Just report it.

More Int isn't doing a whole lot for Mages, compared to more regen. 
---
In a raid setting you'll probably have both but in a dungeon and at most gear levels you'll get more AP from might than kings.
---
Your right, with communication DPS pulling or tanks pulling while the healer is drinking is totally cool. But when its randoms and the healer/tank is dealing with antsy DPS it leads to wipes.

Nah. We didn't ask for new content we asked for vanilla. If they decide to do something like that they would essentially be rewriting 15 years of lore.
---
Even if you don't read the quest text, you can still even get a gist of what's going on. You don't have to read quest text to realize that  the scarlet crusade doesn't like you as a forsaken, or that you are at war with the quillboar as an orc, or that the gnolls and kobolds are a problem on Elwynn.

True. Hunters supposed to be one of the most fearsome classes in pvp who can challange literally everything and kite everyone to frustration and inevitable death, but thus far nearly every hunter I've met failed to change aspect in time, get dazzled by shock (I'm ench shaman) and allowed me to walk into his meele zone like Alabama dad into his daughter's bedroom.

They said it's unlikely they'll release TBC, but it's not off the table, and they'll ask the community what we want after phase 6. So chances are it's WoW in a new direction unless there's a high demand for TBC.

He's standing right next to it

I mostly just use Swipe tbh, for the same reason OP posted. If I hit a rage surplus and am good for the next 3-5 GCDs I might throw in a Maul, or if DPS are going especially hard on a single target.

In vanilla, people getting ahead of the pack always came back to lower zones it seemed like. Idk if it was because they were lonely, or everything was new and they weren‚Äôt quite sure what to do being the first people there and all.

But to be honest at that level you have no abilities, so all of your damage will come from your wand. All you have is like pain and mind blast, so spending money to get shadow spell damage that early doesn‚Äôt even matter

I give them one renew if they lifetap... *lundgren voice intensifies* if he dies he dies
---
Yeah id say argul is 70/30. It's at the point where questing just isn't worth it. Even in zones where you would expect more alliance the horde dwarf us. I expected an imbalance, that's why I rolled ally but I didn't think it would be this bad.
---
Worth it for the armor tbh.
---
I've found alot of grey's like great swords selling more than some greens!
---
 You remember it from private servers? Blizzard has nothing to do with private servers
---
Its funny how good it all looks being simple and clean.
---
It's pretty good or you could immerse yourself and read the quests explore the area and enjoy the game. If it's a time crunch thing totally use questie...
---
They should add xfers for a single obvious reason -- it makes them easy money.
---
Yep demo/battle shout (if it reaches enough of your team) keeps aggro even during some AoE. Sure it does nothing after the first application, but things are attacking you and not the mage.
---
it's annoying if you're using them on cd, other than that it's not a big deal. at-level dungeons means you have infinite soul shards.
---
Saying ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt ask for that‚Äù about an OSRS like experience is by definition wrong. Any new content is polled in OSRS and 75% of the community needs to approve of it - so any new content would be stuff the community did ask for.
---
Did you keep track of the amount of time it took per run or the whole thing? Deciding to do this vs ~12 devilsaur leather for 10g an hour.
---
Then you need to change your username
---
Coincidence I think. Nobody will ask you to DPS as there are always ten a penny.
---
Aka the Australian vanilla experience
---
They don't stack now nor did they stack on the private servers. Not on Lightshope, Nostalrius or Elysium anyway.
---
Why can't people accept that private servers got alot of shit wrong lol
---
&gt; but the majority of the military-grade hardware is using in control systems for communication, radar, weapons, etc.
---
I actually already talked about that and you ignored it.  My originally comment is specifically talking about a radar that has purposes in both defense and as a weapons system.  We used COTS parts whenever available, because they were cheaper, more reliable, and easier to source than the military equivalent.  
---
I know what you're saying is true in theory, but speaking anecdotally here, it was the complete opposite in my experience.  The way the military contracts its parts is a racket used to funnel money to specific people.  They intentionally make their parts as hard to replicate as possible for this reason.  Most of the time it has little to do with quality control or functionality.
---
SPAGETT!
---
Since server maintenance on 9/8 things are looking up. The 1 second delay on pets commands seems to be almost entirely gone. (not as instant as pservers but will suffice)
---
After a while I wouldn‚Äôt mind the burning crusade.  
---
I think polling regular classic players with content would work well.
---
Guy there was double dipping by selling the fish to players due Fifty silver afterwards
---
Grind hyenas until 30. Then do hyenas and harpies until 32
---
That sounds epic
---
simple math
---
You‚Äôre kind of being rude and dismissive...ironic.
---
Yeah it's a stretch to suggest they destroyed server identities.  Not everyone is prepared to spend lots of real money to change realm unless they're committed.  A service that lets you join your friends is a good thing.
---
Hot diggity damn, I‚Äôd rather farm greys for a bit than grind red or orange lv mobs. Thanks buddy.
---
Im in classic because i like the classic mechanics. BFA sucks balls with what they done to gear, resilience stats, butchering class identity, those stupid mounts, etc. Its a shitshow, i dont wanna see a tauren priest or a gnome hunter. What the fuck is that shit. I like the 2-3 shot kills you can do in vanilla that you cannot do in retail. 
---
Im not in classic for the community, ill tell you that. I just wanna have a big pop to choose from so i can always have a new opponent to fight against in pvp. 
---
Private servers with mega populations were infinitely better than what vanilla was. The racism, the memes, the cancer, i love all of that.
---
Kill some mobs for some levels if you don't feel like questing, maybe run some dungeons . You can hit 60 quickly without questing at all.
---
This isnt a thing in classic
---
Don't sleep on the road, m8
---
Sir Oinksley is gone?
---
SAY SIKE RIGHT NOW
---
As a warrior, I'd be happy with a little sharing. I can only kill one guy at a time do you really need to steal that one mob in front of me to add to your pack of 6?
---
The stonetalon quests at that level are pretty brief.  That's the point it really advantages you to bounce around zones, and it's where I recommend people start using a guide if they care at all about optimization.
---
This is top quality oc

which is what retail lost, dungeons in retail are just a button mash fest, no stratagy or planning
---
And 3 years later the warrior us still looking for a group
---
As a warlock, I'm fine with this too.  Most of us are specced affliction for leveling, and every time you heal us up to 100% while I'm casting drain life I generate a little bit of rage.  We have so many points put into making this life &gt; mana &gt; life conversion efficient, and then you ruin it with a heal.
---
I'm fairly new with weakarora mind telling me what I'm supposed to do with all the random letters and numbers?
---
Mages get into some fun fast paced dungeon parties with their AoE skills.
---
But I chose Warlock, mainly because I played it back in the day and really enjoyed it, but also because it's a fun class.
---
I just have a % on my xp bar, with no segmentation. Looks tidier and each 5% is one bar.
---
It probably started off with a Chuck Norris statement.
---
So am I. But I heard somewhere that fury was a better option. Not sure why tbh. But I'm getting used to stance dancing, and made macros to swap weapons to lay down a shield bash/interrupt, and it's making it more fun. Still, I feel super weak compared to other classes since my aoe abilities max out at 2 mobs at a time.
---
Who are they? Who are you in relation to them? Do we care?
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be sarcastic, I actually have no idea who you‚Äôre talking about. Maybe this should have just been an email to Blizzard or something.
---
I did do a scam move in TBC. I got a hold of a blue BoE staff that I wished to sell so I thought of a way to sell it quickly. I mailed it to my alt and had him put it on the AH for full price then got back on my main and said in trade that I WTB &lt;Blue BoE Staff&gt; for (20g higher than what I posted it for). I quickly got a response from  a guy so I checked AH and sure enough my staff was sold already so I responded back that someone already offered before him. He seemed pretty pissed because he stated his just bought the staff off the AH. I apologized and went back over to my alt and confirmed he did buy my staff
---
Oh absolutely and the beauty of vanilla is that every class brings something valuable and unique enough to the table that you'd definitely want them in your raid team!
---
But the sheer amount of healing throughput Paladins have in the later stages of vanilla is just bonkers.
---
Despite these big gaps in raw numbers you still want other classes in your team simply because they offer something you don't.
---
And even if that means that you only bring the druid for the battle rezz and versatility to your raid if you are a hardcore progress guild, you still bring them even at the highest level of play!
---
It's ironic how the version of the game that cared about balance the least had game design choices built into it that made claases inherently viable without having to compete only on numbers.
---
So I am brand new to WoW Classic (played WoW in MoP but did not enjoy it) and I have rolled an Undead Priest, I know this isn't specifically a priest question, but where can I pick up the Enchantment and Tailoring professions? I've tried Googling it, but all I get it leveling guides and I don't get how to actually start a profession so that I can level it.
---
???? It‚Äôs confirmed that dual wielding increases chance to miss to 19%
---
The not jumping before going over the edge is what got you, lol.
---
However I've definitely hit the spacebar barely too late and just ran off the edge before.  Did you try to jump or purposely ran off sprinting?
---
They do stack on private servers. I used to viper sting with a group of hunters and they would have 3-4 viper stings on them at the same time that would make them go oom instantly.
---
It took 3 days for "Negrodwarf" to vanish from existence.
---
Three whole days I saw his name in general chat in Westfall.
---
Some odd choices on that list.
---
&gt;  I'll go somewhere else for 100g!!
---
to the mount vendor
---
Cool makes sense. Would blizz have a sliding scale they could move to determine how many operations fit into each txn? 
---
Smaller more frequent batches vs larger slower? 
---
I ask Because a multiple level rollback is substantial and I recall back in the day getting rolled back up to 15minutes 
---
That doesn't seem like just some little  packet or data loss  on blizzards end. Which is what made me presume I guess that it was deliberate in design.
---
Wether or not there is one guy at blizz hovering over a big rollback button or if they just programmed it that way :p
---
Kind of like a ret paladin and Judging more than once  any 30 seconds.
---
But it did mage spells
---
A trip into the depths of insanity. You grow from it learn from it and when things get insane in real life you go nah man this isn't so bad I ran a fine man through gnomer... Bring it...

On my realm barrens chat seems to often turn to polite helpful conversation.  It ain't got shit on 2005 barrens chat.
---
This is why I like playing alts. We rarely get to see how others of our class are playing, so we always think how we play is correct.
---
Lol I‚Äôm a 21 noob and spent way too much time trying to take the boat in ratchet to booty bay , the boat was down and then finally it worked and I spent more time trying to go from bb to silver pine .... luckily a Good Samaritan told me about the zip from org to the under city
---
That moment when you post someone else's post just to promote them but you end up getting more upvotes....stonks
---
Lol who‚Äôs gonna pay for that shit
---
What you're doing is called overreacting. To nearly inconsequential things.
---
You could bitch about class homogenization, you could bitch about the silly artificial gating of content. You could bitch about a million things that would be valid.. Instead you go with whining about the fact that they stopped making you return to a quest giver.
---
What a silly little turd you are, lol.
---
Mainly because hes specifically a dps warrior haha
---
I agree with you that it's not the best but I don't think anyone agrees with you as to why.
---
Quest Markers? That may just be one of the worst things about modern WoW quests. It was much better when you had to read the text and find your way through the world.
---
For PvP their main use is Purge which is VERY strong and also for windfury totem which makes arms warrior teammates very bursty and tough to heal against.  Grounding totem and earthshock can mess up spellcasters pretty well with good timing so there's some room for skillful play.  TBH for horde PvP healing I always preferred resto druid over shaman in vanilla for the better survivability and ability to carry flags in wsg.
---
questing isl ike 90% of the game and druids are still needed at max lvl and viable in pvp, don't let the min maxers stir you. A druids role is not to deal the most dps but to rather be slippery and provide support/cc.

Well how would we know if you don't tell us what addons you're using.
---
LOL!  You two have your heads so far up your asses.  I know exactly how the game works.  Many people agree with what I've been saying and there's only a couple of you idiots that want to refute my experience.  My observation is a fact... it happened.  I'm not speculating anything, but rather reporting what happened to me in several different groups.  I watched the one good warrior tank we had hold aggro of 10+ mobs, even mid AOE.  He wasn't there just gathering them, but keeping the mobs on him though the damage.  You have next to zero details of what was going on, but feel you can state I don't know how the game works, lol.  You may want to broaden your understanding of the game and what some classes are actually capable of before telling other people they don't know how the game works themselves.
---
Im curious how confused they are as to wtf just happened haha.

I think you would also need to change raid sizes to 40 so guilds dont need to split teams. As well as combining normals and heroics into a single difficulty. You'd have to redesign entrances to ogri'la and think of a way to get people up to arcatraz and what not. Summoning stones would need to be removed. Do you change talents back to classic and just add new ones or do you go with the new trees and builds... I personally am I tired of relearning my class every expansion...
---
That's always been it for me. They should've figured out a way to keep everything worth doing instead of replacing your epics with lvl 61 greens.
---
You forgot sm spellcleave library lf mage!!! 75k xp/h!!!
---
Just transferred an alt so it doesnt bother me really but holy shit this place is dead. Hope they start merging or offer transfers eventually, cause this ain't working.
---
Nah, just lifted the concept from WH because it‚Äôs dope.
---
Read the title again.  They said excluding.
---
I recommend using a character like ƒü or something just find an alt code to slightly change one of the letters.
---
Yikes sounds legit
---
Another suggestion: Slam.  Slam is awesome.  Charge in, 2-3 white hits, ten spam 2-3 slams, and it‚Äôs dead.  Yes, you cannot auto-attack while casting slam.  But it‚Äôs 15 rage, and essentially doubles your damage every hit for only an extra 1sec (if specced, 1.5sec w/o spec) of swing time.  It‚Äôs pretty monstrous honestly, and overpower can proc from this as well.
---
Ask any of the guards and they‚Äôll put a flag icon on your map where they‚Äôre located in Undercity
---
Everything in classic was built to ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù. NE were never that close to humans or dwarfs, not seeing one till lv30 was fine. 
---
You were not supposed to make a ‚Äúrun‚Äù to IF. You were supposed to go through the wetlands as per normal and then see IF.
---
&gt; Nothing about Classic forced this.
---
I respectfully disagree. A lot of things about classic forced this. Many of them weren't intentionally designed into the game but many were intentionally designed out of the game.
---
Okay?? Any class can use it
---
I‚Äôm sure you just shift click their name for player info
---
That‚Äôs not a bad idea. I‚Äôm planning on allowing a few different reset options anyway, like a reset session and reset lifetime. I could easily allow tracking per level as well, and I‚Äôll just throw in a reset level option too. 
---
I think I‚Äôve got my head around most of the facets of tracking items and the money made from selling them, and it‚Äôs progressing. 
---
I greatly appreciate your continued input! None of this would be here if not for our combined efforts.
---
Don't push it. You're talking about all kind of post Cataclysm shit lore anyway. Trolls have nothing to do with being a Druid. The lore was forced to the game for convenience.
---
PvP gear looks cool though
---
Yeah, I like doing the quests, still remember most of them anyway, but the only addon I can think of similar to what was asked is questie.
---
This his a lot of classic notes, but the warrior bailing resetting his run because it was taking too long only to sit and wait for a fresh restart is just too on point.
---
Two weeks to get to level 11? Sometimes hundreds of minutes? Yes , deleting is a gd idea for you. Back to retail nub
---
I think that putting in unfinished/left out stuff from Vanilla like dalaran, Quel'thalas, twilight highlands and gilneas would be cool. But I also don't really want them doing that at the same time.
---
It lasts a week in retail...
---
Idc about 20% more speed on a 3s cast ;) I'll worry at 60
---
I love the lack of heirlooms. There isn‚Äôt a bunch of ‚Äútwinks‚Äù running around three shotting mobs. Everyone‚Äôs on a level playing field of getting their ass kicked. People working together is so much more common already. I love meeting people just randomly while doing quests.
---
Yeah, my dream is arena seasons in classic. Preferably without fucking with gear at all.
---
50 is the real wall
---
Exactly.
---
What UI add-ons are you using?
---
You sound like a miserable person. Please seek help
---
Oh ahahah, i read 'was it a druid in disguise' for some reason. Yeah i think thats the only possible explanation then
---
theyre actually one of the fastest levellers. Make sure you take spirit tap and improved wand spec, and you basically have 0 downtime when you SW:P and just wand them down, i can easily pull 3 mobs, dot them all, chuck on shadowguard (as a troll), fear them, and mind flay/wand them all to death and be left with most of my mana for the next pull.
---
Yikes get a job
---
Your mistake is comparing a private server to official.
---
Bro, totally wanna do this.  Idc about tips
---
All good reasons besides the meme.  Thanks for the learns.
---
Got a double take and a chuckle from me. Take your ash covered upvote with pride, good sir.
---
People don't want to change old habits and don't realize that aggro isn't a mechanic just for tanks. 
---
Unfortunately, modern stigmas influence many people's playstyles and it's hard to break them.
---
Exactly lol then you try again. No point in wasting everyone's time being a dickhead and leaving cause shit isn't flawless first try.
---
I farted and it smells like New Jersey.
---
Yes
---
And it was a bad change IMO. It‚Äôs a trade off between world building/lore/race fantasy for player convenience. All the change they made since then all sacrificed those things for player convenience. Now we‚Äôre at a point where you never walk, you portal anywhere, you don‚Äôt look for groups, etc etc. Player convenience is fine but world building shouldn‚Äôt have been sacrificed
---
damn what you eat? and sorry to hear that
---
Doesnt tell you spec
---
Let 'em die:) their repair bills might teach him:)
---
This 1000%. Sometimes I tap to full mana and cannibalize/bandage. And then a healer heals me to full while I‚Äôm doing so.
---
Yes, offhand swings also proc sword specialization.
---
I'm not using any related add-ons
---
Hunter reporting in, can confirm, skull means target acquired, launching furball projectile asap
---
Actually maybe it is people playing Classic like retail where its much more forgiving/casual friendly?
---
The developers forgot the RPG in mmoRPG.
---
And it shows in a lot of places.
---
No
---
When I had to do that I wished a lock to summon me there quest done in like 3 minutes
---
I'm playing Classic right now, and before that I was playing retail.
---
It isn't arbitrarily breaking down anything, it's the actual foundation for how quests can work. A counter keeps track of how many of a mob id has been defeated. Or it counts objects interacted with. If we are talking about quest design, those are important things. Retail has added many of those things over time, it's not a matter of opinion, retail has quests vanilla couldn't.
---
I think BFA took a step back from Legion quest hubs, but you're still wrong to say that BFA doesn't lead you across zone or to other zone. Not only do they have quests that send you near areas that can become quest hubs with progress, but the also explicitly give you a breadcrumb quest to another questing area. Additionally, and somewhat annoyingly, they will have quests that send you walking around the capital, continent, or enemy continent. 
---
Classic does hubs, but there are definitely more quests you just drop and ignore, or don't pick up at all, just fuck off NPC. Often it's just more sensible to pick a spot and ignore the quests entirely, though it's arguably a strength of both games to have more options to level for different tastes. 
---
Personally I wouldn't point to classics hub design as more shallow so much as just haphazard. However on classic leveling works. BfA is a real fuck show with leveling, both in the bizarre way you have to level through old broken content, and in the wonky way they handled 120 power progression.
---
There is no addon.
---
HOW?!
---
Epic RFC run incoming.
---
Nope, saw the first 60 rogue on my server running around on an epic mount too.
---
I dont have to prove shit to you.  Who the fuck do you think you are?  You're welcome to believe me or disbelieve me.  I dont give a FLYING fuck if you do or dont.
---
You're also a troll account.  Less than 30 days old and with a vitriolic attitude like that I can only assume you're either banned with your old account or too much of a chickenshit to post on your main reddit account.
---
When did they say TBC is unlikely?  All I saw was them saying it'll be easy to do.
---
Yeah, this is just retail mentality. These people will quit before 60 thankfully. One AMAZING thing about Classic is you can write those mfer's names down and never play with them, and warn future groups you may be in of them.
---
Exactly. He's talking about all the crazy transformers lore, that came post Cataclysm.
---
Hope you ganked him at the end.
---
I always called them Manlegs as a joke... but THESE.
---
Classic is giving me the gameplay I‚Äôve been pining for for the last 6 years. I thought it was because I was a kid that I loved it so much, but o realize it‚Äôs the game. Classic is just amazing and I hope it sticks around for a good while. It‚Äôs fantastic.
---
Probably. But I ignore it and dont let it bother me so I forget about it
---
There is 0 proof that those were exactly from 1.12... if those are like from 1.9 it‚Äôs already a huge difference. 
---
Also I easily place traps down and FD in classic now. I don‚Äôt see why you say it‚Äôs bugged.
---
Use the report function, it works this time around
---
/ignore and roll on.
---
No, that's fucking stupid. How did your name possibly piss off 3 separate people?
---
Is lil‚Äô Sebastian gonna be there?
---
Plot twist: All three that needed it were hunters
---
Ignore them and move on
---
 They are most likely a bunch of 12 year olds who want to be funny and get kicks off of reactions to edgy shit like that, ignore, report, move on, don't let them ruin your experience because for every toxic pre-teen on the game there's a hundred wholesome and nice people who care about others in game
---
yeah def have his name down .... when I sent him the recount of how much dmg he was eating he stopped whispering me.
---
And what did you do when you got to Searing Gorge and saw you needed a key
---
SMOrc
---
Thanks!!!
---
Private servers are not the standard for vanilla... Private servers got a lot of shit wrong..
---
Yep and the worst part is your friends forgot  that it's faster to kill them one by one with cc and structure but continue to push forward all ape sh*t... and still survive oom and the whole party at 2% hp... "We Did It!"
---
Why did I sign up to heal this go around?
---
SMOrc Clap
---
So what you are saying is re roll alliance for karma??
---
Yeh that's not going to end well, either ally will start on pve or quit all together, pushing the numbers even more horde way..
---
Honestly, same.
---
He would literally run into the pile of mobs , AE and sit there then die and claim I didnt heal him
---
Thanks so much!
---
I rolled a hunter. Guess that makes me a wanker
---
Druid heals, rogue (me), two BM hunters, and a enhancement shaman. BFD run. Enhancement shaman tanked, and we all agreed to wait a few seconds to let the shaman build up aggro before we went HAM. Had to spam Feint on cooldown for my part. For group pulls we had the hunter pets tank a mob each. Run was a bit slower but we made it through. Was pretty neat actually.
---
As a lock in class, this is not a concern for me :p
---
Group up, abandon the quest or put it in the back burner, go kill pirates or start a fight with your new group and watch the world burn. Just relax and enjoy the chaos. Try another time, explore outside of what a guide says to do and when to kills things. Get into some dungeons, make some random late night friends and kill some more of the opposite faction. Then dance on their corpses, laugh, teabag, repeat. Get ganked, gank someone else and pass the torch.  Do you man play what feels fun if it's not fun shake it up that's the beauty of it almost nothing in classic requires you to 100% complete everything right now.
---
I like Madseasonshow too, his content is usually solid. I also like BellularGaming. He's pretty good when it comes to very FREQUENT uploads. Finally, I also like Taliesin &amp; Evitel, because they think rationally about a lot of the drama in the community.
---
Curious what your in game name is
---
Where can I find these
---
Feralas has intense weather...fog, rain and mob agro! Whoa, makes for interesting navigation.
---
We're not old. We are survivors. Our edges are smooth because we've lived. We know a few things about life. Take heed.
---
They were all kind of in a group It‚Äôs because I spell my character name ‚ÄúLazieness‚Äù which I‚Äôm aware is the wrong spelling but it‚Äôs been my name in game since bc. I‚Äôm sure it was just trolling I was just dissapointed.
---
Even in spreadsheets it's great... people just don't try and do math...
---
I tried that obviously first, and found one or two. Figured the community would have better stuff
---
I wish there was some way to see all the available kill quests so you know, two birds one stone. ...Is there?
---
woWOOVF
---
Demo shout is more effective bc it hits the whole pack. I believe if I understand it correctly the threat comes from the numbers it hits. So battle shout would only pull more threat if theres more melee than mobs. I usually pick my shout depending on how many melee I have and how many mobs I'm pulling. Whichever is the higher number is the shout I use
---
Where did you aoe farm at 38?
---
Captain grim
---
its just the new meta, metas shift, and hopefully blizzard can implement classic+ which could spark up the meta a bit every now and then without changing anything drastically
---
Yup, but i've never seen any data on how that effects your dps at lvl 35 or 45 though. Miss rate sucks, but rogue also has 19% miss rate while dual wielding and it's fine.  
---
Even if we presume that is is worse than 2h, how much worse is it? How big does your wep difference have to be where it's better or worse? No one seems to have any idea at all, they just constantly say it sucks because of miss.
---
So that's how usually my dungeon party members are playing.
---
I've had that exact thought as well. All the ease of access changes that WoW has had made it less of a believable world to live in and more of a video game that you play.
---
As a warlock I didn't realize I was supposed to carry water/food
---
A streamer called Malagant. He gets the chill vibe just right. I often fall asleep with his commentary still going because uh platonic loneliness I guess
---
Neatplates has the option, also shows your debuffs on to the target.
---
Sure, just open your WeakAuras addon by clicking the minimap button or typing /wa
---
Then go to "New" on the left side of the window, and "Import" in the bottom right.  Copy the text in, and it'll give you a little pop up showing the name of the Weakaura and letting you see the code if you want.  Then just click "Import".  
---
Select the Weakaura in the list and you can move the icon around, resize it, etc.
---
Because private servers got it fucking wrong.
---
I'm currently 56 on my warlock. Very little dungeons, almost entirely questing. I've been spending too much gold jumping between specs and I find that dark pact drain tanking is infinitely better than expecting the voidwalker to tank, who has trouble keeping aggro vs wanding and a single dot even when talented. I feel really bad for all these other locks I see running around with that thing.
---
I think improved drain life is pretty questionable even on a drain build though. That's a lot of points for some very meager returns. What are you gonna give up for that? CoE if you're on a PvE server, sure. But past that? It's definitely not better than Suppression, Grim Reach, Nightfall, etc
---
If you are on a PvP server by the way, I'd recommend the succubus over the imp for dark pact. If you turn off her autocast skills she generates plenty of mana, she adds some okay melee dps, and most importantly she can seduce. Which is great for PvE too!
---
HS is pretty good dmg per rage actually

I think the main reason he didn't got invite because the leader(or his friend) is a tank warrior and doesn't want to compete for mail loot. I know that because I do the same when I form my group(on Horde actually, I like to be the only mail, inviting 2 leather and 2 cloth)
---
Oh no I wasn‚Äôt hurt or anything I just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this kind of thing to make sure that‚Äôs not where this community is going. I really like the way it is now.
---
Yup the level before me water and the level when you get new water are the worst. Level before it's obvious, the level when you get it is horrible because it takes your entire mana pool to make 12 drinks..
---
Like, you‚Äôre never going to play that character again? Come on.
---
Bon Appetit. Claire is always overwhelmed but usually comes out with some kickass recipe, Brad's wild, and Gaby's adorable.
---
/bow then honor fight to the death
---
I love it!!! I'm gonna have to try a TB painting this weekend!!! Tauren pride!
---
Same lines. I copy pasted.  /shrug
---
:/ and they arent rogues because?
---
Yojamba yeh. Haven't been back on Arugal since the ques got intense
---
Bruh you‚Äôre missing 2 panels cmon
---
full can mean it still has no queue time, depends what time of day you play, full doesn't always mean queue time. I'm Yojamba horde, thats where its at, you can only have one faction per server btw
---
Game have built-in screenshot mechanic...
---
## bruh üíØüí™ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
The bait is real
---
I‚Äôm not even remotely interested in retail. I stopped playing around Wrath iirc, and missed that gameplay. I tried Legion and was just bored. 
---
Classic has hooked me for nearly 40 hours in the last week. I haven‚Äôt played a game like this since before I got married.
---
I'm pretty sure I remember me and 2 other hunters viper stinging a boss in ZG and them stacking, totally draining their mana
---
It's actually United. Hemispheres is United's inflight magazine.
---
eh, I think there's a middle ground between classic and retail. Retail holds your hand everywhere, to the point where basically the only important part of the quest dialogue is "Accept Quest". 
---
And while I enjoy classic's, "take a left at the fork, follow the mountain on your right" type quest logs, there's also just as many that are like "hey go this cave north east of this town", but then there's like 20 caves north east of the town with the same mob. And then you're wondering whether or not you have the right cave or if the drop rate is just abysmally low
---
Yes. Just get to choose one tho.
---
Take a close look at the next Gnoll tent you see.
---
Probably a macro
---
Trust me, 1 mage out of 2 will do that if you pull more than 2 mobs. Most are idiots who don't understand when and when not to aoe.
---
I‚Äôm unsure of what the exact Macro is, because I‚Äôm neither a Sham or Druid, but I was hearing about a Macro to auto shift out when you cast.
---
The whole game was originally intended to use this system. IIRC it was scrapped because it made the game a lot harder.
---
Lazieness. It‚Äôs because I spell it ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. That‚Äôs what they said, I‚Äôm sure it was just immature trolling I was just concerned and wanted to make sure other people aren‚Äôt getting this kind of stupid crap.
---
Grouping is part of the problem. Someone invites you cause you‚Äôre working the same quest/area. You keep killing where you are, they do the same where they are. You both get kill credit, but you don‚Äôt even know where all their kills are, so you loot half of yours and move on.
---
Get Questie. You can turn off the quest tracking feature if you want but it shows you quests you might have missed.
---
Thanks it was very useful!.
---
Yea I wish I was horde on Yojamba. Well I will try again tonight but the last two nights it has a queue time that was nuts. Why are people not moving off?
---
Don't know of any addons but it's like it's not something an add-on can do.
---
But I know for a fact it can be done with /cancelform macros.
---
Well yeah, that's why I said if you don't read the quest text you still get a gist. I didn't say you knew exactly what was going on without it.
---
I was really just commending the atmosphere and general feel of the game even outside of the quest text.
---
Yea it's just a bunch of kids. I've not encountered anything similar in years so I'm confident you just got unlucky, /ignore /report and move on. Sorry it happened to you.
---
I'll give water to group members, random people if I feel nice. Otherwise ignore the PMs, like getting asked for water from someone in Desolace when I'm in UC
---
You rebel
---
Oh nice, TIL!
---
I too like to walk around and visit mud huts
---
My go to is /sigh
---
*It‚Äôs got what plants crave!*
---
... Are you actually being serious? Are you TRYING to prove my point?
---
Thanks I'm in bed now but I'll definitely give it a try in the morning. 
---
I also stalked your comment history and seen you have a lot of knowledge about macros. Do you know any that would be of use for rogue?
---
I seen you can make them do abilities on mouse over as well. If I have full stacks on an enemy and do a mouse over kick on another enemy to cancel a cast will I lose my stacks or keep them since I never actually selected someone else? Sorry if these are fairly obvious questions. I never actually played retail WoW and just started classic.
---
It would make sense to replace the old c++ backend in a "phase 1" for live test, then consolidate the end of retail with the release of classic 2 and a new front end.
---
How did he roll a cross faction toon on a PVP server?
---
It has a higher hit chance and most importantly doesn‚Äôt glancing blow
---
Notice if you get a weapon hit with an underlevelled skill it does like 30 damage due to glancing 
---
If the heroic hits even on that underlevelled weapon skill it will do full dmg
---
If you have improved blessing of Wis they can the tooltip difference and deduce it
---
Name yourself, a person on Azeroth, like a person on Azeroth would be named.
---
Behave on Azeroth as your sort of person on Azeroth would behave.
---
Well as this was retail and like 7 years ago give or take, I am pretty much 100% sure I never played that toon again.
---
Did someone say \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?
---
I love Chris, never not love that man for giving us so much.
---
/lick always works
---
Uh huh... That sure doesn't work well for most mages I meet in dungeons, and not only most are too bad to pull it off, then completely screw the entire group; the tank gets no threat, the healer has to empty his mana  bar to keep the idiot alive, and the group now has to wait longer between pulls.
---
I know this might sound crazy to most dps'ers, but the group isn't about you.
---
Are you lost this is classic wow.
---
Wow.....that name really is tilting..... /s
---
Only when they beg. Its only happened twice so far.
---
Communism fails as an economic system because it's an answer to an ethical problem.

Capitalism fails as a ethical system because its an answer economic problem.

You don't have to be a slave to capitalism. You can take an actual look at it and praise it's benefits and talk about it's downsides. Acting like it has none is just being an indoctrinated clown.
---
The basic stat prio at 60 is hit &gt; dmg &gt; crit &gt; int &gt; stam &gt; spi.  
---
If each stat was weighted on a scale from 1-10:
---
* Hit 10
---
* Any source of dmg 9
---
* Crit 7
---
* Int 5
---
* Stam 4
---
* Spi 1
---
Inb4 'but muh stamina': It's just not that important to stack stamina, other than what you need to survive the encounter. The size of a Warlock's health pool isn't any more relevant in PvE than it is for any DPS class because [within the time frame of a standard PvE encounter] health can be infinitely replenished by healers. Having more stamina doesn't impact the health:mana conversion ratio, it only raises the upper ceiling on how many lifetap casts you can do before you run out of health. Your bonus damage from gear has a much bigger impact on lifetap than stamina because bonus damage increases the health:mana conversion ratio.
---
Is this a Murakami reference?

When I started playing again in Legion after not playing for like 6-7 years I was running that dungeon with a friend and heard the alarm bot ‚ÄúWARNING WARNING INTRUDER ALERT INTRUDER ALERT!‚Äù
---
I had like a flash back of turning around in that tunnel to the last boss and seeing a huge wave of mechs and dark iron dwarves rushing at me
---
1. If there's multiple warlocks in a group, how do I easily keep track of my dots. Is there an addon for this?
---
2. Can you share your list of macros?
---
3. Currently level 34. What's the most efficient path to 60?
---
The alliance has some top notch levelling zones, dont fall for the only playing 1 faction meme
---
Yeah except gatekeeping is usually expressed by opinion as well so....
---
I'm tanking as an elemental shaman! I know that's not just the talents but the flexibility of the talents and the class designs as a whole is so fun.
---
What server are you on? I'm on mankrik and have only seen it once (and that guy was ignored)
---
Turtles man. It's like having a tank with you all the time
---
my friend asked me why i dont leave STV and grind SM, i told him i dont have time coz of rl. in stv i can alt f4 any time. not in dungeon.
---
It also removes and immunes you to incapacitate which includes gouge and sap (and goblin rocket helmet I believe among other less common incaps). I almost don't want to mention this since way too many people aren't aware somehow.
---
Are you 60 already?  Cleared MC?  How‚Äôs your gear?  I feel like you are letting all the streamers cloud your vision of the game.
---
In vanilla half the players never reached 60, I‚Äôm not convinced many more will reach it in classic.
---
but aren't Classic raids 40 man, not 25?
---
I mean, that's definitely a dick move. Fucking hilarious though
---
Here's a cyber hug. You don't deserve this nonsense.
---
Fireland was decent, and Rag was fun, but it couldn't carry an entire tier by itself. We went from Tier 11 having three different raids and 13(?) bosses to 8 bosses in Tier 12 and the same boring Fire aesthetic three times a week.
---
I'm curious, what makes someone that has never played WoW before suddenly decide to play Classic on release?
---
The first quest I ever payed attention to was the Defias quest line. That was an amazing experience. Then came the legend of Stalvan and that's when I knew how amazing this game 1as gonna be. Followed shortly by the Mor'Ladim and Morbent Fel quest chains. I'm so glad to be back playing classic.
---
Don't bother with people like this.
---
I'm in similar background as you, and I also take on healer role in other games.
---
When a encounter people like him I just stop healing them completely, often ignore them (just to never risk grouping with them again, I won't remember the name otherwise). 
---
Somehow I'm yet to meet a person like this in current classic. Could be because I'm running with a tank, and those are harder to come by.
---
Phone pics &gt; screen shots
---
Well, it has auctioneers there, it has just as much reason to visit it as orgrimmar unless you're lvl 14 and wanting to do RFC
---
Ah yes wailing caverns.  Had a level 16/dinged 17 tank last night using a 2 hander the entire time and would only tank 1, rarely 2 mobs every pull
---
He would occasionally stop for my mana but only give me a good 3 seconds before charging off again
---
I don't know if I agree. 
---
Unless blizzard becomes way more transparent about how they will handle paid transfers or dead servers in the future, people are being asked to take a chance with no ability to analyze whether it's a good choice or not.
---
Most people when faced with that lack of information will just grit their teeth and deal with queu times rather than risk a dead server that never gets merged or allows transfers, and I don't think that's unreasonable. Blizzard needs to give people more information so they can make informed decisions. My whole group would have transferred already if there was even the most basic reassurance that we won't be stranded on a dead server.
---
Sell on STV AH which is crossfaction!!
---
I really like Bellular too. Is it me or can that man just not stop moving his head every half second? His content is top notch but I have to listen, can't stop noticing the constant head movement and eyebrow throws lol.
---
I find the best thing to do is to just put a renew on the warlock and let them control their own resources
---
I don't want to waste your mana on big heals
---
I also tap to drink and eat cheaper food and water / bandage
---
Oh i know- I have questie for now but there is something super nostalgic about Questhelper for me too. Thanks!
---
I started WoW after TBC came out iirc it's like people forget that it's a challenge it's meant to be difficult. It won't hold your hand like Retail does.
---
Flash Heal is more mana efficient than Renew. ;)
---
I heal-bomb the tank and quickly flash heal the dps.
---
Give you a great example though. Had a hunters pet pull a ton of adds on the last little stretch of gnomer so we went in the workshop door back door because I had a key and Respawns were popping. I let my group know that I‚Äôm giving it one last shot soul stoned the healer and we wiped again but given I had soul stoned him I stuck with it and we got it the next try. If I didn‚Äôt have SS up I would have been apologetic and left. My kids irl &gt; than wow and I was trying to squeeze in one last dungeon which went way longer than should have.
---
Not sure if by "they" you mean Blizzard/Activision, but Chris Metzen retired back in 2016.
---
That was my pet, you play on Incendius?
---
I was fighting an Alliance Warlock around Lost Rigger Cove and got feared. My character ran up a little mountain slope and somehow clipped right through it and I fell under the map for about a second.
---
I was them immediately disconnected from the game. When I logged back in I fell for another second or two before an art screen popped up (I assumed I was being TPd to a graveyard).
---
Instead, I instanced into Caverns of Time. The weird thing was I wasn't placed near the entrance, I was near one of the instance portals (I don't know which, and no it didn't work, none of the portals I tried worked either).
---
After taking some screenshots and a video, I decided to leave but there was a giant stone blocking the exit so I had to unstuck.
---
Anyway, figured you guys might wanna see the screenshots and I might consider uploading the video of me just walking around if anyone wants that.
---
I'm sure to all the new players that upvoted you this sounds fancy but delaying your first MS this long just to get BR is a really bad idea.
---
I can totally agree with this.
---
Just like in BFA
---
Don't talk about things you don't understand. If you have a hard time vs warriors it's because you're a bad rogue, sorry to tell you. 
---
Even if war starts prepared in zerk (yes, they're supposed to be in zerk, not def) and if war has a shield equipped, has life-giving gem and rank 14 gear and the war is a strong war duelist (like Starsz on HH) the rogue is favored. Only dwarf warriors with the above can be difficult to deal with, especially if they use rocket helmet as well. 
---
But yes, if you're a bad rogue or you don't have your CD ready you will get smacked around hard as hell. That doesn't mean that wars aren't easy for a rogue to beat. It's a case of l2p.
---
You're spending 20 rage on an ability that gives no range and barely does more than weapon damage to two targets.
---
You're sacrificing anywhere from 25-33 rage-ish on two auto attacks. Absolutely garbage value.
---
Instead, pop a demo shout + battle shout, or a shield block + revenge + battle shout.
---
Terrible usage of rage.

Never heard of him, I'll check it out.
---
Not really the guy who is into Star Citizen (simply not my type of game), but I'm with you on the second part. Classic was literally the only release for my PC I was looking into. Other than that, I am very happy with my Switch, so I might drop PC gaming entirely in the future.
---
My only real complaint with classic is how broken all the specs are.  I really wish that they would have at least made a small balance pass on the end game specs to make than all viable. Although that may would have changed everything too much
---
Yup! Every time I spoke with one, in character, got the job done, and was pleasant. I love their support team.
---
No you shouldn't, but the tank isn't some special person everyone has to worship. The dps and healer have as much right to dictate how the dungeon clear is done, the main thing is that everyone communicates.
---
&gt; Anyone who tells someone to kill themself can be name shamed. Fuck'em.
---
Let's say I get into an argument with 'Strikefromorbit' on my server and I want to hurt his reputation.  So me and my friend make characters on another server.  He makes 'Strikefromorbit' and I have him send a bunch of horrible stuff in a whisper conversation where I look like an innocent and reasonable person.  Then I just post that to Reddit and say it was from the 'Strikefromorbit' of my original server.
---
TL;DR: The rules against naming and shaming are there for a good reason.
---
There is a decent influx of new players as well, I never played vanilla when it came out, my parents said I already spent to much time on frozen throne and reign of chaos and it would affect my school work. 
---
At 27 doing my first play through its everything I would want in a mmo and more, I don't plan on leaving anytime soon and stalagg continues to stay popped lol.
---
&gt;You can swap to zerker stance, pop rage, and swap back to battle stance in 1 GCD

That's two GCDs,

Ok well here's another one, when you die your tombstone marker on the map has a cross on it. Was there a Jesus in Azeroth?

Ive seen exactly 2 people voice that opinion since the launch. I hink its safe to say that they are the minority.
---
Sure, but what happens if in a month subs drop 90%? No one has any idea what kind of lasting power classic has. It's all guesswork, and Blizzard has given zero information about what will happen if we end up with dead servers. So all people have to go on is their history, which is not so great on that topic.
---
LEVEL 39 not 39 years old lmao

So what was he supposed to do? He couldn't do it with 10 and you hold a grudge because he removed people from the group?

yeah i bet...wait WHAT?!

yea it's broken easy tbh. Charge &gt; defensive &gt; demo shout. if a target breaks off taunt it back in. as long as your dps aren't dead brained and give you at least a few seconds you'll hold aggro vrs aoe.

---
I am still not getting any loot from these.
---
I feel so relaxed
---
So how does it all work, you just grind kills/BGs every week to rank up?
---
 Honestly, as I recall, in actual Vanilla there was a naming policy even outside the RP realms (or perhaps from before they made RP realms?)
---
It was something I remember other game communities being excited about; in WoW you had to have an actual name, not some stupid handle or joke. Even as someone who doesn't RP and isn't interested in it, that sounded great, what a help with immersion! That's why all my characters have always had real names. 
---
But yeah, 2 guesses as to how long that rule lasted and how much it was enforced.
---
There's no reason to math it out, just use a DPS meter and see for yourself.   
---
Really OP is greatly overstating it. Using sunder instead of HS will not give you a noticeable improvement, if at all, especially if you're grinding on mobs lower level than you like you should be.
---
I mean between pulls not while actually tanking
---
Dude you're playing with thousands of random people. Only 3 trolls is a good ratio
---
all cities should be somewhat pipulated which is good
---
Game hard zug zug
---
Why on earth would you both roll cloth if you play together regularly haha.  Whatever floats your boat
---
theyll get their payback when bgs start and alli have isnta queues while they wait 10-15min.
---
lucky scum alliance and their queues!
---
Sort of the same with me as a Shaman healer.  If my group wipes I just Reincarnate and ress everyone.  Love having a Warlock though, since it means I save the 20s on the reagent it costs to resurrect myself.  So useful though.  
---
But tbh, getting back to where you wiped generally takes 3-5 mins, not bad.  Unless you're in WC or the Iron Dwarf's City dungeon whose name escapes me.
---
Just hit 21 and thought I was doing something wrong. Thanks for this!
---
You can have one too, everyone deserves a hug.
---
I haven't had this issue yet. I've had to quit a dungeon at 90% because of real life, but that's just how it is. This is why people start checking gear and making sure everyone knows how to run a dungeon. It decreases wipe chances and decreases time required. The dungeon I had to leave at 90%, the hunter wouldn't stop leaving their pet on aggressive and the tank kept mini DCing intermittently. We wiped 3 times on the last boss.
---
I mean I have like 9g. But I agree it's not really worth the cost. I ended up just keeping the 4 points for now. I'll probably respec at 40 when I can get shadowform.
---
It just... feels good to be nice to someone. Especially when it's not expected. And I want people to treat me nicely, so I do the same for them. 
---
However I also enjoy a good fight, especially with multiple people battling it out, so I chose a PvP server. I'm just not going to be the one starting these fights.
---
Jokes on him? What joke? He thought you could do it in a raid and couldn't so he removed people. What did you expect him to do? Keep the raid together and never get the drop?
---
What a stupid post.
---
It happens man, I get heated really fast so I fully understand. You‚Äôve met the trolls, now hopefully you meet some chill people and do what the games intended for!! Have fun!! üòÉ
---
That‚Äôs no excuse.  It knowing that threat is a legit mechanic in classic is one thing.
---
Pulling threat and getting beat up by a mob, or mobs, and dying can in no way be considered a healer issue.
---
A tank issue, maybe (quite possibly not). A DPS issue, maybe (quite possibly). The healer is not involved except to clean up the mess.
---
My favourite DPS are the ones that pull aggro and then run away from the tank. Not sure what they‚Äôre expecting there. xD
---
&gt; Is this something I should be trying to avoid
---
Yes. A healer splitting between two targets is a waste.
---
Try to avoid, it's a pain in the ass.  Everyone should be focusing the same mob.  The only time you should do it is when it's something like a ranged mob that will target the healer and the tank cant get to it.
---
You‚Äôre not supposed to be going into WC by yourself
---
As a mage who's been AOE farming SM since 30, this is the most fun i've had in classic so far, blasting down 10 mobs with nova, cone, and blizzard is a blast.
---
Don't hate the player.
---
&gt; If the thing you're fighting is your level + 2 or lower, use Sunder Armor. Lower armor = more damage = more rage per swing. 
---
Yea, but who cares about getting more rage per swing before you have WW. The increase in rage is pretty negligible since the thing you're attacking should be dead in \~15 seconds anyways no matter what you're doing, and you don't have a great way to use that rage.
---
Sounds like the problem is it's too hard for the people that want everything to be easy.
---
You should be using Feint whenever that happens, and remember, damage that isn‚Äôt being revived by the tank is still damage being received by someone that has to be healed. It‚Äôs better that it‚Äôs received by the person with the best kit to mitigate it.
---
Yep ! Got mine over the weekend. It‚Äôs a beautiful thing. You probably already know this, but just don‚Äôt turn in the quest otherwise you will lose it.
---
Are you kidding? No damage meters to compete on and no one does when you miss click. You're just playing a game of blessing whack-a-mole and then you get purples.
---
I agree. In vanilla it's not about how efficiently you can squeeze through a dungeon, the dungeon is just a place. Scarlet Monastery Library is just a library. Stratholme is a half undead city. It's not a carefully crafted reward simulator designed by people intentionally trying to hook you.
---
haven't seen that opinion expressed until you just expressed it.
---
Nah, off tanks in dungeons usually are not needed. Just give the tank a sec to get threat. A good tank will mark at least the first target. Burn that one down and by that time it should not be an issue.
---
How dare you?!?
---
HOW FUCKING DARE U?!?
---
Gave up?!?!! This is one of the best things in Vanilla.
---
Get back to the Vale of Eternal Panda Crap, n00b!
---
It gets worse. Your Intellect starts to out-scale the mana your water gives even more.
---
Wait till lvl 20
---
As a lvl 18 I‚Äôm sad cuz I know it‚Äôs gonna be well gone before I hit 30 lol
---
Dont let a marriage counselor hear their decision. Immediately institutionalized.
---
I remember going to the zone and talking to the guy farming it for hours with no success. He told me that he was pretty much done for the day and let me take over the area. A whelpling dropped in about 15 minutes for me. Pretty much how I paid for my first mount.
---
Considering FD/trap acted the exact same way from vanilla through Cata, it doesn‚Äôt need to be from a specific classic patch.
---
Show me where Blizzard says it‚Äôs working as intended.
---
I changed my server because of alliance vs horde ratio, at \~28 I got ganked constantly, no matter which zone I got. I'd really like to play on a pvp server as alliance, but phase 2 with the ranking system will make that a hell on most servers
---
Items still do this in retail, but the light is smaller/less dramatic. More of a glow than a "oh man spotlight on my character," I think it changed when they made the lighting more realistic circa late WoD but I miss it.
---
My group didn't wipe once on a boss, just the mobs that kept attacking me and the pet pulling more. Shit happens life is obviously more important. Like I was the lowest level but my healing wasnt the problem.
---
record, and take screen shots
---
I had a very similar experience in wetlands earlier today.   Not even maxed it was beautiful.
---
Vane has come online though
---
 Playing on an RP server without an intention to RP is definitely a "blame the player" thing. 
---
Surely at the bare minimum, choosing an actual name for your character should be expected on an RP realm. Hell, IIRC the tab describing it says exactly that.
---
Asking is better than demanding, at least.
---
&gt;The point is that heroic strike is (deceptively) horrible damage per rage and sunder is a superior use for it. Many players do not understand the opportunity cost of losing out on white swing rage
---
Bad value per rage point is better than no value per rage point. You cite the gain of the rage from your white hit as a reason to use sunder, but what are you going to do with the extra rage? An extra sunder that has no effect on a mob that would've been dead by now if you're done two HS?
---
confirmed. i did this back in the day.
---
This sounds like MoP? Maybe? Most quests 1-120 now are entirely irrelevant.
---
That is definitely something someone might do and I'd hate it to happen to me so I'll remove the post.
---
Thats a Lie lol. Blizzard said they would merge realms if they got too low.
---
It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs too hard, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs complicated, long, and messy while being a huge pain if you do end up wiping. You can easily get lost in there or not know where things are and not in a good way - most of the bosses except the last one are uninteresting and not really challenging at all.
---
That is messed up. Why didnt you mark this as a spoiler?
---
Try the add on allyroute instead
---
I'm saving this comment just in case I roll a warr later. Thanks!
---
This guy is right. There are spreadsheets that show Sunder Armor is better than Heroic Strike up to a certain % of health. 
---
Early one (levels 12-15~) if you‚Äôre well geared mobs can die fast enough to make Heroic Strike the better choice, but especially levels 18+ Sunder Armor &gt; Heroic Strike until a mob is close to death. 
---
If it makes you feel better, lowering a mobs armor lowers their effective health, so even though you‚Äôre doing no damage with the strike, it essentially means the mob as less overall health before it dies.
---
The 1st rule of this sub will be best way to interpret that the answer is "no".  It'd otherwise open flood gates for everyone to spam their stream channels, especially since there's nothing stopping streamers from streaming content not related to Classic or WoW at all.

Warning!
---
OPs advice baaaad advice.
---
Using Sunder Armour requires dancing into defensive stance which gimps your damage.
---
Now you might think that you can just dance out of it since he included that you're supposed to be early arms specialisation anyway and can preserve some rage, but this is wrong. You're only supposed to be in melee range of a mob when your auto attack is due, this means that you can only use your weapon skills at that time.
---
Hence IF you Sunder you will also swing with gimped damage because they must happen at the same time since you're supposed to run away between swings to avoid the mobs faster attack speed.
---
Go for early Fury instead.
---
You don't need the bonus to rage given by early Arms as you don't have too many rage consuming abilities just as OP pointed out.
---
The added crit and attack power from Fury are better. Piercing Howl is the single most useful ability both for tanking and single player survivability until you can get the final skills of a specialisation at 40.
---
Okay wow thanks guys , i didnt knew reddit was this fast !!
---
Sorry I haven't run with any mage yet today.
---
If you listen to Metzen interviews, he got his start in game design from being a Dungeon Master, and DND was huge at Blizzard
---
There aren't any as it is
---
All the naysayers just don't know what the hell theyre talking about. What saddens me is the people who played since classic who are blinded by their QOL from retail they chuck a tantrum the moment they can't tag a mob or can't do without AOE looting etc. These people are the worst.
---
Actually a blue geared feral Druid can keep up with a nax geared legendary 1h warrior as per Druid expert that did tanking in vanilla and is playing classic now. He had legendary 1h warrior as well.

There is something called sunk cost fallacy. Basically you've spent time doing something so rather than recognizing it isnt working and cutting losses you keep plugging away so it will all be magically worth it. I will absolutely bail on a situation that has become not fun or not productive instead of bash my face against the wall. In the time it takes people to get their head out of their ass a competent group could start over and be beyond the point you are hardstuck, but even if they do not making it to the exact same spot but getting more bosses downed from the reset beats waiting for people to maybe grow a brain.
---
I used an alt character... had someone invite my main and my alt to same party and then leave, you log over to alt for 2 minutes till the game autopasses lead, reset and then run again
---
I love this is a thing now
---
As a paladin its simple. I heal a single target, its the tank. If tank is topped I might be able to heal someone else. Might.
---
Charge &gt; berserker stance &gt; berserkers rage &gt; battle stance &gt; sweeping strikes &gt; berserker stance &gt; WW. WW hits each mob twice with sweeping up.
---
&gt;If the enemy is low, and I'm grinding mobs for a quest there is about a 0% chance i'm going to dump all my rage into a mob.  I like to carry over rage into the next mob.
---
but why? Keeping in mind we are talking about pre-WW grinding, there's no use for excessive amounts of rage.
---
Yep. Dinged 30 and got the new level of water. 1344 mana over 27 seconds. Better, but I can imagine my mana will out-scale it in 4 or 5 levels as opposed to the 8 or 9 it's been so far. Still beats having to pay for it, I guess.
---
That exact quest is still exactly the same in retail, why would it be cute and special now but not 1 year ago?
---
Oh shit, I totally forgot about that whole outrage. What an interesting week that was.
---
We don‚Äôt go to Ravenholdt
---
The food and drink are cool, but have you mentioned the 7k exp that simple drop off quest is worth? If you have the flight point it's like a 2 minute walk away for 7k exp. Food cool, exp way cooler.
---
If you're going to wait until I engage the mob +3 my level only to gank as I have aggro...you have no honor and I'll bitch about it ^(to general chat.)
---
Holy priest here. How do I know if it's better to take a piece of equipment that adds 'x amount to healing spells' vs 'x amount of spirit'?
---
Wait a sec......
---
Didn‚Äôt you post about being overrun?  Give it a couple of days. Maybe just an influx of players at your level. If so, they‚Äôll be out of your way soon.
---
It hasn't even been a month, simmer down.
---
What? Both you and the lock need a bit of mana-&gt;lock taps to full-&gt; you give him 1 heal to top him off-&gt; you sit and drink while everyone else moves on to the next pull with the lock dpsing.
---
How is this better than the lock not dpsing and instead having to sit next to you while you both drink?
---
Desolace, Dustwallow Marsh, Swamp of Sorrows, Badlands
---
Heroic Strike is a rage dump, pure and simple. It‚Äôs also useful when a mob is getting closer to dying (25%~ health) but an auto-attack won‚Äôt cut it to kill, this is also assuming Overpower isn‚Äôt available and you don‚Äôt have Whirlwind or Mortal Strike either. 
---
It‚Äôs not entirely useless, but it‚Äôs definitely not an all purpose ability, it‚Äôs true calling is a rage dump.
---
I will never forget this mistake as a young lad when I first played the game... 
---
I clicked on one, waited a bit, nothing happened... well, I guess you must light all of them!
---
This is ENGRAVED in my memory now.
---
I thought they made it clear that classic will remain as it was before the BC or WOTLK...
---
It is supposed to be vanilla wow. They already have phases planned but nothing more will come
---
As a druid I loved that they finally fixed the druid trees in TBC, AND gave us items that were spec-specific. 
---
Hated that they removed 40 man raids and I didn't like the new PvP system.
---
They are using /who to find healers. 
---
You're a class that can heal and they're filtering by level. A lot of people get these messages.
---
I just do it once for those agi pants that last you 20 levels or so
---
It‚Äôs people trying too hard to make it ‚Äúbarrens chat‚Äù. Gets a bit cringy/annoying tbh. Still having a blast in classic though.
---
Quite a rude reaction.
---
I'm a mid level paladin with all my points in holy. Whenever a horde attacks me, I lose. Straight up. I do like 8 DPS.  It is so uncompetitive that half the time I don't even bother to (auto) attack them back, or even try to heal myself. I just /shoo them, and then I die. 
---
At least I'm not a free HK.
---
I name my pet Leeroy. I like scaring groups by sending in my pet and calling him back before he aggros. Party members don‚Äôt enjoy it as much as I do though
---
Throw one heal on them which will pop them to full or 70%+. How hard is that?
---
I'm not talking about on accident. I'm saying retards purposefully pulling more because they feel like they're big ballers who can handle it all, yet they can't dps enough to kill them in a reasonable time at all.  They're toxic pieces of garbage.
---
Did you right click the app. Go to Properties. Click Compatibility tab. Then click Run Compatibility Troubleshooter. Maybe it will work. Or try running as Admin.
---
I'm leveling affliction right now with my felhunter out in case I run across classes I want to interrupt while killing them in wpvp. Usually I dot up a target and drain life until it dies, but recently I made a bit of a discovery. If I send my felhunter in and let tainted blood build to five stacks and then hit it with curse of weakness and the rest of my dots and wand instead of draining life, I can end combat with only a small portion of hp and mana missing, usually enough to mostly regenerate by the time I engage the next mob. Alternatively, while normal drain-tanking I would end combat at full health but with a decent bit of Mana missing and would have to occasionally life tap so that after 7 or 8 pulls in rapid succession I'd have to drink/eat. I'm lvl 38 atm and I know at 40 I'll get dark pact and it'll be a non-issue, but do you think that the time I save by not having to sit ever with the tainted blood/CoW method is offset by the slightly slower kill speed (only my felhunter is doing dmg until I cast immolate on 3 stacks) or does the loss of combat efficiency hurt me more than occasionally sitting?
---
The monthly resets? You mean like catchup mechanics? You mean exactly like retail does? You mean one of the exact things that a lot of people hate about retail because all the hard work you put in the last tier is immediately invalidated by a thing you spent 20 minutes on in this new flashy zone?
---
Ah yes, great Runescape quests that definitely aren't about collecting X items, like "I'm baking a cake, fetch me flour, milk, and eggs," and ones that definitely aren't about grinding mobs, like "Kill imps until you find four different colored marbles with very low drops rates."
---
Wands get +dmg from the elemental +dmg associated with their damage type, not agility.
---
You are a shit healer lmao. What a fucking diva.
---
It has to do with several things. For example, Booty Bay is a contested area. It is also an area where guards enforce peace. You can attack other faction members, the guards will just fuck you in the ass.
---
Ratched is not contested, horde can initiate on alliance but not the other way around. However, ratched is also neutral with guards who enforce peace.
---
So in these Areas players dont attack one another. A likely position for an attack is on the boat between Ratched and Booty Bay, but many people just go there to get shit done not to have unnecessary fighting.
---
Similar things happen when you go to Stonetalon or Ashenvale. You may see member of the other faction. You may attack them. But you have to question yourself "Do I really wanna bother with it?" A lot of people just want to get shit done and quest. They dont want to start a faction war.
---
If you go to stranglethorn though, permanent carnage incoming.
---
I understand that mentality but the first literal all team wipe happened 75% of the way through the dungeon, like it was obviously working and wasn't on bosses when it happened. It's just rough cause now I have to go back through Wailing Cavern....
---
It was about 9 minute runs for me (pretty well geared). I uploaded a video on youtube of one of my runs if you want to see how it is done on Classic (and it was a pretty bad run in comparison to others). Things are definitely harder on Classic  than on private servers because of how bad the voidwalker is.
---
‚ÄúMistakes were made‚Äù XD
---
Sorry but am I missing something?  What was the support's answer?
---
Rtard is acceptable WoW vernacular
---
&gt;Thank you for write-ups like these.  They are increidbly valuable.
---
lol. You should probably try it for yourself before praising. OP is grossly overstating his point. You will see little to no increase in dps, or in some cases a reduction by doing this.
---
I usually /sigh when attacked. It's gotten a few people to leave me alone.
---
&gt;If you have to drink every time because you‚Äôre healing them, it‚Äôs also making the dungeon take longer.
---
???
---
Am I taking crazy pills? Does everyone in your group just sit there twiddling their thumbs until the healer is full mana?
---
"You make water"
---
"Oh my god..."
---
He really needs more exposure, his videos are [actually funny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQTl6lxQhoo).  
---
As much as anyone hates Asmongold for some reason, when he gave him a shoutout he more than doubled (nearly tripled) his subs and went from 30k to 120k daily views in 1 day. Really glad he did too, such great videos.
---
But you get that sweet 14 slot bag for completing the instance..
---
I also do Tinkerer Gizlock - just have to note that since the VW is complete trash in Classic, I just kite him around using LoS
---
Gotta /wave at every enemy I pass. Just to let em know I'm friendly!
---
Biggest shock is the 180 in attitudes from players 99% of my interactions are helpful and nice and often go out of their way to help you finish the quedt even though the are done. In turn I do the same and always give out water on my mage :) currently level 37 and though its a grind it just makes max level that more worth it.
---
The difference between WoW and games like Rust, is the former is story and content-driven, whereas the latter are sandboxes. Sandbox games are designed to be volatile. WoW is not.
---
So the answer is No.
---
I  play on a PvP server and most of the time I'm solo, I also mained a  Warlock before in Vanilla so I figured Warlock would be best. I'm  actually really great at the class especially in PvP I can handle myself  in 1v2's and in 1v3's I win more than I lose. However I always find  myself wanting more. I'm undead and soemtimes don't like how gear looks  on me, I also miss using a sword and I find myself daydreaming often  when I run dungeons. There will be some tauren druid in leather gear  that looks awesome, especially the shoulder gear they just always stand  out to me. Or an Orc Warrior with an awesome 2handed sword/axe.
---
I  know it's silly but a simple thing like that will make me want to be  that race, and I just struggled really hard the first time in vanilla. I  never got to 60, I re-rolled constantly, I was always a different  class, I've never once been in a raid...not never. Now I have a second  chance at this and I just feel like I'm going down the same path. I  really could use some help because I feel like I'm bumming myself out.
---
I have a
---
* 26 Warlock
---
* 18 Priest
---
* 12 Warrior
---
* 6 Hunter ( i made today)
---
I just can't get a handle on what I want to do.
---
Im on grob alliance and the past two days I've seen really bad (racist/sexist) arguments break out in Elwynn and Westfall. The upside to an RP PVP server is you'll find people who really want to help or be social. Hoping that after a month, when the jerks get bored and mods have more time to focus on reports things will improve.
---
I didn't think you could. Could this possibly be something with the layering? 
---
In any case i always, and i mean always, see 2 parrots and diablo pet in the same spot as that panda on westfall.
---
Untill you hit 60. Its all youll see when you ask for DPS.
---
What mount is this? Looks cool
---
As a veteran mage I can confirm that all this is very true. 
---
We are just an easier choice for people who don't know what a good warlock can do.
---
"hahha you have to do the quest again! Ahahaha I wasted your time HAHAHA ISN'T THIS SO FUNNY?!"
---
I mean OK I guess. Seems the mentality of a small child to me, but you do you.
---
Obviously I'm not saying bag ass at first wipe because shit happens. Just lending a different mindset.
---
Quit posting this moron's content....
---
Was this in Blaumeux? If so I‚Äôm pretty sure I was there.
---
.. except Darnassus.
---
Hello wallpaper
---
As a bear tank so far, if a non-cloth dps grabs a mob off me I just let it happen unless it's a boss. If the healer grabs aggro, then I use taunt.
---
Most dps classes have abilities that let them drop their threat or at least buy themselves time for me to generate more threat. Classic is my first time doing any tanking so I might not have the most knowledge, but I raided a bunch in vanilla+BC so I know some of the mechanics.
---
Use a lower rank renew or wait till they need a phat heal
---
Also, none of the above is relevant in any way shape or form. 
---
That guy re-rolled after like level 20? Pallys don't get good until after MP5 and crit gear, before that might as well be ret. Healing Pally through like 55 sucks.
---
Ret at 42? Of course it's good, the talents are out of fucking control. Hell at 60 it might be broken because bosses won't take 20 minutes in modern Vanilla, Ret only ever sucked because of Mana, had zero to do with flat DPS.
---
But talking about performance in level 15-50 instances is like the Special Olympics. It doesn't matter and even if you win....
---
Wailing Caverns is just a huge af cave. And a bunch of people decided to do their stuff in there.
---
Omg thank you. I discovered House on regular television while grinding weapon skills in Blasted Lands. Snapped me to attention right away. It boggles my mind to think that it ran for nine seasons, and that it ended 10 years ago. Worst of all, I haven't had a single rerun. Time to change that.
---
FYI f keys work great
---
f1, skull f2 x f3 condom f4 star f5 triangle.  At the start I tell them if I want a cc and what their assignment is, and then we are off to the races.  Because AOE pulls require lots of mana, but individual single target is more mana efficient for the healer since damage is a lot less.
---
Try /cast shoot ; /dance
---
I believe when people rage quit, they're just going through a bad day. They hoped playeling a game would cheer them up, but it just exasperated the issue instead.
---
Yessss!!!
---
/cry
---
Absolutely not, never ever ever do anything that produces a cast bar when tanking.
---
There's a reason a lot of tanks don't invite hunters
---
I got in 92 little fights and my mom got scared and said "stop pulling all the adds here with your serpent of air"
---
I'm not sure how I feel about the wonky stats yet. I feel like if stats get too specific on gear we get a homogenized treadmill that feels similar to current wow. However too weird and its hard to tell what youre looking for as an upgrade... idk.
---
Me and some buddies rolled in a five ball and just wrecked every horde we saw. Over 300 confirmed kills!
---
As someone who has never done anything tanking-related, is bear druid Maul also something we should rarely use?
---
That's basically how I've always imagined an updated wow, but with housing for all those buildings... well maybe at a reduced scale since the movie version probably cannot be handled even with current hardware, but a couple hundred houses for a single instance in every major city would be a blast.
---
Fear does some weird stuff. You used to be able to get into Old Ironforge if you could get someone to fear you through a wall in Ironforge
---
I'm thinking about byikg this on my server. It's like 8-9 gold but I haven't bought my mount yet so I'm kinda afraid to bite the bullet...
---
Doees it stack with the furor talent?
---
Could you link and/or PM me your youtube? Congrats on the mount!
---
The real Oomkins
---
Go eat ramen with sodium packets all day and no vegetables. I guarantee you won‚Äôt feel as energized without veggies in it.

Really not that serious of a debate, more-so just basic health.
---
&gt;complains over virtual "property" 
---
&gt;calls someone a snowflake
---
Gonna be a yikes from me dawg
---
DPS also looks at threat and also helps peel for the healer if necessary.
---
When I catch a fish and cast my rod too quickly I get an ‚ÄúInternal Bag Error‚Äù and don‚Äôt get the fish. 
---
Change that, but otherwise I‚Äôm good.
---
May I offer you an egg in these trying times?
---
You're doing the lords work, carry on brave soldier.
---
Soo I guess I should avoid this one if I had the worst time of my early WoW career in the Wailing Caverns? :D  
---
I rather quest than doing overly long dungeons with complicated architecture where members of your group leave halfway through.
---
Dont bother, aggro is a bitch at low levels and people just go all in. Focus on the bigger things like bosses etc. 
---
It will get slightly better eventually
---
Make a ‚Äú/y MANA‚Äù macro. It might help
---
Roasted you
---
Adding some rotisserie chicken sounds bangin, good choice.
---
rofl
---
That's awesome!
---
I kinda feel like making a fire mage and just blasting my way through dungeons to 120, but then I remember all the stuff I would have to do on 120 that puts me off playing my current main and I quickly get back to classic. Maybe the next expac.
---
Hidden leather daddy gets hairy midget wet.
---
Play conservatively and your just gonna have to be vocal. A good tank will know what you can handle after a couple pulls.
---
How much does it cost to train + buy mount?
---
https://youtu.be/tOGCaOhCZvo
---
The difference is the consequence. Not doing a quest in retail likely means that the entire quest zone is blocked for you until you do that one quest. Not doing a quest also means you won't be able to fly. 
---
In classic I just look at a quest and think for myself "ugh, the reward isn't worth the effort" and abandon the quest.
---
we are playing 1.13 dude
---
I've been a long-time hater of hunters, mostly for this simple reason; 95% of hunter players are bad hunter players. The 5% that are good hunter players, can make that class really shine. But that's not what you see in your SM group...
---
There‚Äôs still so many in the sub lvl 20 zones there are lines and hour long waits for mob respawns. There‚Äôs plenty of people to play with -.-
---
It's never too late to start
---
What realm was this on?
---
I try to eliminate as much meat from my diet as possible, hopefully I can be fully welcome in the veggie fam one day haha
---
Now your attacks can MISS twice as fast
---
no dude the majority of players are in the 30's or 40's
---
you may get ganked more on a pvp server but thats about it
---
See, I'd think fortunate son plays when you get into booty bay and are greeted by a goblin. Then run through the jungle when you actually start your quests.
---
I'm a 26 mage so I know that run is coming up. At least I have a good tool box for escaping ganks.
---
Light be with you.
---
Lol that‚Äôs part of why it‚Äôs so funny I think, I‚Äôm picturing them having absolutely no idea what just happened and blaming the keyboard or lag or something.
---
I'm not sure, I am on sulphuras and have been jumping people in ashenvale lol
---
Leatrix has a function that works.
---
WTF are you talking about. Sunder doesnt require defensive stance.
---
ie shamans and priests.
---
Im not sure what type of normalized attack speed you mean, but the normalization that makes slower weapons more useful for stuff like Whirlwind or Mortal Strike is already in effect in Classic.
---
I.e Mortal strike with a 3.8 weapon will do as much damage as a 3.3 weapon.
---
Absolutely not! There are thousands of people still low level. Don't compare yourself to people who have played a significant number of ours every day since release. I've played since day 2 and I'm only 33 in STV atm due to work commitments. It's actually never too late to start.
---
No. Classic isn‚Äôt going anywhere. There are hundred of guild and tons of servers and people just starting in every day. This game isn‚Äôt just about raiding you have plenty of time to do everything.
---
It won't be too late to start a year or two from now.
---
You'll be fine.
---
This isn't retail where content gets outdated or irrelevant. People will be running MC until everyone on the server has a thunderfury.
---
 Every raid needs ONE(1) Shadow Priest, so I hope he levels and gears up quickly if he doesn't wanna heal. 
---
Not sure why he doesn't just play pure damage class in that case though. 
---
&gt;Also have seen a few warriors vehemently refuse to tank and saying you can only tank with points in prot.
---
I've seen this more from people who've only played the later expansions being shocked at the idea of a non-prot tank. 
---
You can/should tank everything up to and including raids without being Prot spec.
---
The horde on my server are extremely aggressive and will always murder you on sight. Except this one Orc Warlock that followed me around Dustwallow Marsh skinning raptors as I killed them last night. He even /thanked me when we parted ways.
---
Gelkis lives in caves, while Magram lives in tents I think.
---
PSA there is literally no way to capture moving images on your computer without a cell phone. =D
---
Just chiming in to say you are standing on the wrong hill.
---
I dunno that you need multiple druid.  One resto in the caster group is usually enough, though some raids can use a feral to hop between off-tank and cat.
---
Did they leave in that silly cat weapon in gnomeregan?  If so, that gives a little more reason to have a feral in the raid
---
Alyx, is that you?
---
Eh when I tank I don't mind warlock dots.  I will let the mobs run to you and taunt at the last moment because if he isn't hitting me that is less damage to tank and as along as you don't die in 1 hit no harm no foul.  Couple of sunders a rend and a demo shout is usually enough for a few seconds of neglect before he bolts to try to kill you.
---
Perfection.
---
Check out ShareX as well.
---
Hitting Print Screen will automatically upload to imgur and give you a paste-able link.
---
hence why the chat was so funky
---
You are NOT prepared
---
You've got plenty of time. The people already doing endgame content are speed-runners. Just enjoy your gameplay.
---
That I agree with.  But just don't heal the dps then.  The tank will save you, but he is letting the mob attack the dps either he is a bad tank or a good one.  You will know if he taunts after he taunts when your dps is dead.
---
No. It‚Äôs straight out of the Warcraft 3 bonus-campaign. Which is so nice!
---
I dont really want them to touch it too much...
---
It is like this amazing nostalgia place were i can be care free highachooler again for brief moment wirh my old friends.
---
It is awesome.
---
Just think of those people who were out on release night and are still level 37. 
---
Hint. Thats me.
---
I often loot, but after a lot of killing my bag is sometimes full and then I just leave the corpses with low value stuff.
---
The pre Cata Blizzard developers.
---
They are. [Here's an example of one such item](https://www.wowhead.com/item=13000/staff-of-hale-magefire).
---
Holy shit.
---
I've been doing the same with albums. Remembering all the music I used to listen to around that time :D
---
Do you think people aren't generally wearing the best quest gear?
---
Doing this as Undead make makes you look like a spaz. It‚Äôs awesome.
---
White damage is your autoattack damage, yellow damage is damage thats caused by a skill you use, like heroic strike, execute etc.
---
This is the best response to the question.
---
&gt;"Fantasy is a modern evolution of mythology made into an explicitly fictional setting. Tolkien, credited as the father of modern fantasy, based his works off several different mythologies, such as the Christian, Celtic, and Norse mythologies, all of which either feature humans, or gods described in the image of humanity. As fantasy has evolved, that central trope has remained a staple. 
---
&gt;In Warcraft specifically, the humans play such an important role not just because we can relate to them, but because they were the first of two chief races in a standard "Man vs. Monster" story. They also provide a base for which other races can compare. The dwarves are especially good craftsmen, while humans are just decent. The elves are superior archers and rangers, while the humans are mostly inferior save a few exceptions. 
---
&gt;The final role of humans is their role as the fantasy underdog, and the power of willpower. The humans, by all means are a biologically, technologically, and mystically inferior species. They do not posses the strength of the orcs, the mechanical skill of the dwarves and gnomes, nor do they posses the natural aptitude for magic like that of the elves. They live fractions of the lives that their allies and cousins live, and though they are resilient, they are so fragile. Vol'jin, when placed into the body of a human in a dream, remarks at how fragile, weak and slow he felt. Yet despite this, humanity has spread larger than any other race, raising seven kingdoms, one of which is now the most powerful capital of mages in the entire world. They form the bulk of the Alliance, fighting massive orcs, trolls and tauren, fending off legions of the walking dead, and standing against the naturally gifted blood elves and the incredibly destructive goblins. They are torn asunder but they refuse to fall. Humanity has blessed Azeroth with some of the greatest heroes and damned it with some of the most sinister villains. Their refusal to back down and their endless strive forward where other races grow complacent is what makes them so important, and cements their role in fantasy.

&gt;To play a human is not to simply play something representative of yourself. It is to play the underdog, the everyman, the nobody. The nobody who stands against monsters and demons far greater in strength and power. To play a human is to face these monsters head on, knowing they are greater, knowing they are stronger, and still refusing to back down." - Donovan, Moon Guard

Are you sure that‚Äôs not United? :o 
---
Theres a United logo on the Magazine + hemispheres is United.
---
They can do one QoL which would be making Ret paladins really OP, that's it though.
---
You can‚Äôt charge after using blood rage though...

---
as main warrior tank i'll let you know:
---
Just because we pull doesn't mean we expect you to stop drinking, stand up and start fighting.
---
I usually pull when people are drinking and are at 50% mana. This gives me a few seconds to build some aggro, get hit to generate rage and position pack where I want it.
---
No one will complain that you're drinking. I only complain when people take too long before they decide to sit to drink.
---
(they look around, go loot this mob, go loot that mob in the other side of the room, look around again, then decide to sit to drink).
---
Nice wallpaper lol.  Thanks and wow
---
Or me as a rogue when I see LFM for a dungeon and they say "Sorry doing spell cleave"
---
I dont think i could afford a computer that could run a game like that.
---
If its a good tank he will taunt AFTER the dps dies and sees its on the healer.
---
*laughs in warlock*
---
Tanking. Stance dance to arms to dump heroic strikes and go back to prot to help against damage. Tanking required super attention.
---
On yojamba and still can‚Äôt log in

A level 40 bragging about running through a level 12-20 area? Oof
---
And getting lost
---
Lol, no! Hop on in dude.
---
Yeah, playing classic has definitely given me a lot of appreciation at just how much the game accomplished. I mean, you can count on 1 hand the amount of games with this much content and detail, and then also remember it was made in 2004. Just blows my mind.
---
I am the ones making them change it. Every vote counts.
---
Ur a God sent
---
We know what they are going to take from this and make from it. BC, wrath, cataclysm, Pandaria, and so on and so forth. And there's a good chance they will also release more classic Realms to start back at the beginning at some point. But we know where they are going and they know where they are going
---
You go walk around silverpine forest with a level 40 mage on your tail for 10 minutes
---
Actually, since you're so obviously a pro player that is leagues above everyone else and therefore can look down on them, do it for 20 minutes instead.
---
Cancelaura Macro should do the job.
---

Too late for what? Behind whom? Cause you can start a mmorpg at any point you are never behind.
---
KEK
---
get dusted
---
_Again_, as in OP, I'm not talking about people who actually eat/drink between pulls or at all.
---
_Again_, I am specifically talking about warlocks who literally **never** eat or drink, and expect me to fund 100% of their mana. 
---
They are distressingly common.
---
I would consider the sword, unless you are deadset on the axe. The extra swing proc is hilariously op. 5% crit so boring.
---
Totally agree. Ppl downvoting my original post for mentioning him I guess?
---
I had one of these today, he took so much damage that after every pull I was drinking and often he would pull when I had no mana, I struggled so damn hard to keep that idiot alive along with the rest of the party who were talking damage because he couldn't hold threat.
---
&gt;What I'm trying to say is... do you think blizzard will keep classic 100% vanilla at all costs, because it's what they thought we wanted?
---
No, they will keep it as close to vanilla as possible because that's what we, the players, wanted. Your suggestion of adding garbage X and Y that want in vanilla is bad because:
---
1. We want the experience of replaying the original game, not some bastardized version of it.
---
2. If they let your suggestions in, then who decides what else gets out in it is left out? It creates a slippery slope of adding extra crap to Classic when there's no agreed upon ruling on what additions get in.
---
Keeping the game as close to vanilla as possible is the best thing they can do. If they add the crap in the OP, then I'll just cancel my sub. Haven't subbed since WotLK to come play Classic and now we have people who want to change it into something else. Go away.
---

Oh man, to find your rocket's delta V you'll need *logarithms*...
---
We'll have to break out the scientific calculator for this one.
---
That doesn't make sense. Higher player caps do not make more people want to play on a server. If it was 3k, the queues would have been longer. Everyone wants to be on the populated server and that's an unavoidable problem.
---
While I haven‚Äôt had the hours to play, I have yet to have a bad interaction. Not even a bad dungeon group, and I‚Äôm at level 29...just kinda taking my time. I started playing about mid vanilla, so I know racing to the end is relatively meaningless. 
---
I‚Äôm forever Horde. Last time I leveled in EK. I‚Äôve never really seen Ashenvale, Stonetalon, etc. This time I‚Äôm leveling in Kalimdor. It‚Äôs awesome seeing new sights after having played for so long!
---
Do alliance have a quest that needs that double barrel boomstick? The horde does, and I‚Äôve sold about 30 of them for 25-40 silver each. It‚Äôs nice
---
I didnt bother with the warrior's axe and got myself a [Bonebiter](https://classicdb.ch/?item=6830) instead.
---
Easier to get, stronger, and your priest friend will be happy with the quest reward too. Instead of just helping you.
---
Hit screenshot key
---
I don't remember that quest from vanilla but it was not bad in classic for me, maybe I got lucky
---
&gt; I'd like to ask all of you warriors here for your best tips on playing against frost mages.
---
If you spot one, run towards the next spirit healer. It will shorten the time you need to get back to your body.
---
I remember climbing the mountain to get to caverns of time back in vanilla
---
Lmao
---
First off, stop buying from the ah. It's a huge money sink. At level 40 when you want to buy the mount you will regret all the greens or blues you bought. 
---
At lvl 30 run Razorfen Kraul. It drops the corpsemaker axe. It is really good until you get Ravager or the whirlwind axe. I beat  someone on the dps meter last night on every fight even though he had whirlwind axe and was 3 levels higher.
---
I'm a level 36 warrior. I will run SCarlet monastery for the Ravager axe first. Maybe at level 38 I will do the whirlwind axe quest and then I will wear it till I am 50. 
---
Goodluck getting those axes!
---
This is the best advice here shield block is huge for proccing revenge. Marking your target will help a ton too. Thunderclap is a waste better off tab sundering IMO and just getting group aggro with your shout
---
Heroic Strike is better on non elites
---
Thanks for the info. I don't really understand the layering system and hadn't really noticed it in action.
---
What's with the comment about my attitude? I asked a question... in a post about questions.
---
I will  never bend the knee
---
And snakes.
---
LOL that‚Äôs horrible
---
I always offer 10s for a stack of level 35 water, when I'm standing next to the mage in a town.
---
I have yet to be turned down. They don't have to group or run, and always end up thanking me. It's a sweet deal for all of us.
---
People like RPG's that are RPG's. Going back to something that works isn't an experiment. If anything retail is a failed experiment.
---
I don't think you can delay it, but you can move it. Two addons I know of are [Dominos](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dominos) (specifically Dominos_Roll), and [XLoot](https://willitclassic.com/view/o2rhVeooa5MKChCVD1RW) (fan fix).
---
Unfortunately yeah, there are always jerks out there, and part of crafting your community experience is putting these people on ignore. And Reporting them.
---
&gt;And all of you mages out there, what could I do to make it difficult for you?  
---
Roll a rogue and ambush mages at 10% hp.  
---
Roll a druid/shaman/hunter.  
---
&gt;What are your tips on how to fight against you as a warrior?  
---
Don't struggle, since you're going to die anyway. Mage is the paper to the warrior's rock. There is no way a warrior beats a mage (unless charging at 5% hp) if he has his monitor on and 1 working finger.
---
Without levels players would progress through Outlands by gearing up in each zone before being powerful enough to move on. So the mobs would have to be pretty tough. You'd want to come with friends. This would serve as the catch-up mechanic for non-raiders so they have gear to start the new raids. Guilds with Naxx on farm could start the new raids right away and experience the world content at their own pace. 
---
There will be some power creep but there are ways to minimize it. I'm in favor of somehow restricting the Outlands gear to "out there" (plus Kara and whatnot). So you still need your Vanilla gear, however good it was, to ride through Blasted Lands to the portals which could be interesting on a PvP server.
---
Help! I'm being repressed.
---
Too soon Executus!
---
Also happy cakeday!
---
Oh we can dance if we wand too or we can leave your PUG behind, cause your PUG dont dance and if they dont dance then they're no group of mine.
---
How did he get the eye of shadow?
---
The biggest thing i've noticed ..or well remember...Is that not all creatures have Eyes or Teeth..or whatever object they want you to grab from them.....You see, only 1 out 100 have eyes.
---
I wonder how much of this is correlation between leveling quickly and mages having good capacity to do so.
---
Surprised Pikachu face
---
Yeah, I looked at icy-veins and they are like "you should fury tank", but isn't that only viable post-AQ?
---
That is a soft rp. Alliance and Horde are in state of war and both sides have a lot of reasons to hate each other, that is also applied to each player, cause everyone playing on a PvP server has a lot of stories of opposite faction interfearing their plans hard. So that (intended or not) is a part of good game design of earlier WoW. The way the game works makes us hate opposite faction and that is a large part of it being fun.
---
If you think PvP servers are about honorable duels you are totally wrong. Only difference between PvP and PvE servers is that people of opposite faction are able to gank each other in unfair ways. 
---
Some people dont accept it for some reason, but if there are no other objective reasons (friends on that realm etc) - we all are playing on PvP realms only for that.
---
Lol very very few people are lv60.. definitely not most people lol, I‚Äôm lv20
---
That's a lot of rogues
---
Sand the canvas before painting
---
Grind
---
lol
---
too much gamma for my eyes
---
This is probably the reason. A lot of odd choices in classic can be traced back to a more or rp reason.
---
It's never too late to start. Your average user is still in their 30-40 level bracket, and this game will probably be going pretty strong for at least the next year.
---
It's blizzard... Tbc is easier
---
It is a pain to run honestly I enjoyed it as a no life 16 year old but as an adult I'd hate it.
---
Also black fathom depths is just shit for tanks not hard but it's long tedious and the corpse run is like 5 minutes minium.
---
I was talking about this with some guildies recently! I'm a big D&amp;D fan and came to WoW because i rlly missed MMO's, and looking at all the spells and how similar they are always makes me giggle.
---
yea yea, why is the blacksmithing trainer so far from AH / Bank...
---
Alliance is massively favored in AV as well.
---
ive been selling water to people lol. 
---
gotta get that mount g somehow.
---
A Paladin topping the DPS charts?? Wild
---
And I don‚Äôt really expect them to. If they‚Äôre not pulling aggro I couldn‚Äôt give 2 shits if they‚Äôre at 60% hp after a renew in mara or brd. Unless they‚Äôre dying directly due to the fact that they both didn‚Äôt heal themselves and you didn‚Äôt have the mana/time to heal them then who cares at all?
---
I dont believe this to be the case.
---
Hah! Thats hilarious
---
In other news: everyone should enjoy the game in their way.. so I was there the second day, hadnt much time to play and still on 24 :) life is cruel
---
Reminds me of the people trying to get you to gamble in IF or SW.
---
Thats sad....warrior is a BEAST when it has support. Then you become unstoppable force...so its super fun but you need to be patient. Warr is probably best pvp class....in the end ;)
---
I remember back in BC as alliance. I did so many BG's and we lost about 3/4 of them. But at least it was all instant.
---
&gt;In terms of sustainability I really hope they don't just re-release the old expansions one by one and instead craft future content based on old design principles instead, whatever they may be.
---
Yeah..but I have 0 faith in them delivering on that, is the problem.
---
We ran gnomeragan with 2 level 26 and managed to clear it but it was a slog
---
i red some comments and you mention that best leveling path after 30 is getting 2 mage dudes for aoe farm, grind some sm and then grind even more other place with those. but what if we dont have friends lol..
---
what else i can do to level fast, it is ok even if it is a  bit less better than aoe grinding
---
A splash of milk gives it a creamy accent as well and makes it more closer to real ramen.
---
Quality post. Thank you.
---
&gt;worth gold, which is equally useful to everyone.  
---
No it's literally only useful to two people. 
---
1. Person ninjas an item via Need which is supposed to be used for upgrade channels only
---
2. A rogue with a plate belt sells it
---
3. A paladin benefits 
---
4. The guy who was in the group and actually did the work loses an item because some dickhead wants to sell it instead of it IMMEDIATELY affecting another character
---
5. Bastes in their own sweat and ejaculate matter because money was more monetarily lucrative over doing the right thing  
---
Submit a ticket about it, not sure what a bunch of redditors are gonna do
---
I am playing 1-2 hours a day
---
It's literally the one extra rule that RP servers have. Use an RP friendly name. Joining an RP server to be with your friends doesn't somehow exempt you from that rule. 
---
I reckon a lot of people literally don't realise that it's a rule - Blizzard really could just make that a little clearer. 
---
At any rate, the RP purists can report bad names. I don't see the point of complaining about it on Reddit.
---
I just experimented with this for a while and was unable to do use wand shoot and my dagger at the same time. When my wand was first, I would try right clicking to begin melee. It would turn the wand off. I tried spam alternating between wand and right click, but again it would only do one at a time.  
---
If you find the link for where you read this, I'd love to see it
---
This is a journey not a race :)
---
Thank You!
---
Another thing you can do is hamstring kite. I'm lazy so I hamstring my mob, auto attack, run through the mob and turn around, and only engage the mob once my aa timer resets. Your rage generation will be low but so will your damage taken, you can also pool rage that way to busy out a hs and rend on the next mob. Cuts down on the repair bill 2 when your not getting wacked. Finally sitting will get a mob to auto crit u. Use it to guarentee enrage and clap some enemies
---
Because the idea of what involves classic being killed is a feeling, and it's your feeling, it's not something blizzard has any control over.
---
There are a number of things they can do but we know one thing they will definitely do. No wait, two things. We know they will eventually release more classic servers down the line. And we also know they will release every expansion that follows in the order they originally came out. Beyond that we will wait and see
---
Wooosh
---
To be honest I hate black fathom depths the most so far. there was something about the length annoying abilities stuns silence and snares that makes it a pain.
---
Plus the corpse run is so long.
---
I think they may have increased it slightly. Drop rates felt a bit better in classic than when I did them on privates/originally.
---
Had to run from Menethil to Scarlet Monastery yesterday, I was 33.
---
Maybe a stupid question, hm.. But can we buy with alts and save more stacks somehow or its not worth?!
---
https://youtu.be/vbjbz1aX3TQ
---
It's not always about the "physical" rewards. It's a very cool quest line that tests your limits and has you traveling across the world.
---
They do that even if you bring tons and tons of lockboxes.
---
Maxed out reputation and still being looked down to, sucks to be a warrior in Ravenholdt.
---
I just wanted to say, I love your name. Hail Satan!
---
I agree. Classic is my first experience with WoW and I‚Äôm loving it. It‚Äôs so much more of an RPG than MMO‚Äôs are these days. Great world building and immersion, everything you do feels significant and part of your character‚Äôs story.
---
I agree. I had to do this 23 times so far with all my low lvls to the point I had made my own darn tank and realized I suck at lvling warriors. Lol. But boy I was good at coordination. I would pull as a healer or dps around a corner because most tanks(with the exception of one tank who actually trained to carry a ranged weapon) ran in pulling multiple mobs, not realizing you only had to fight 2 instead of 7-12. As I sat there in disbelief, I started pulling if I don‚Äôt see them using wit over brute.
---
This here is exactly why I love Classic. I like to no-life one weekend every month. In retail, I'm limited by daily and weekly caps/quests/etc. but in Classic I can spend that entire weekend however I want and make up for a lot of that lost time. Feels good.
---
There's this great overall mage guide on wowhead  [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-classic-wow) 
---
Wowhead IS the go to database just about 99% of things you would want to know about stuff in general.
---
You're not a ninja if you roll on stuff you are going to use. And armor class is just always the upper limit on what you can wear - go ask a pre-raid pally healer how much plate he is wearing to bring an example. They're always contesting against mages and priests for cloth, so do druid healers (and shamans)
---
It's disgusting. It's the most processed food next to SPAM, yet people still seem to think it's healthy.
---
Rogues and warriors are natural enemies 
---
Just like rogues and mages
---
Or rogues and priests 
---
Or rogues and other rogues 
---
They ruined rogues
---
Nice so the undead will feast on some falling off the bone tender gnomes.
---
The information is out there.  Try looking it up before just blaming blizzard.
---
I was really astonished that this game is able to use 80-90% of my GTX 1080 OC :) 3440x1440@max
---
That boss hits HARD. It critted my 720hp warrior into oblivion with a 450 crit. If I had been at max health that may have been feasible, but unfortunately I was not. Almost wiped my group.
---
Honestly I do like it. Strong nostalgia there for me, it was the first zone I ever saw back in the day. I just am not as captivated by it as the other starting zones. It might be the red waste of it all.
---
For huge pulls all you do is spam demoralizing shout, don't bother with other abilities
---
Does it count as natural selection?
---
If they do put some of the older expansions out I think many of us have an idea of where they should stop. Unless they change the way some of the ones were in retail. BC was great and WotLK was good to a point. Near the end with all the heirloom, group finders, and pitty mechanics is when it began to become less immersive. 
---
My step brother kept playing for a couple expansions after WotLK while I quit early cata. He'd fill me in time to time on changes and they were always things I just couldn't understand why they did it.
---
Everything‚Äôs a hunter weapon in Classic.
---
this \^
---
they just made it easier to use the feature, it was already there
---
So you're selling this piece right? Would love it on my wall. Lmk!
---
Tonight I found a 16 page lore book in the inn in Kharanos! I forgot those existed in WoW!! I was super excited and read a bunch of it. It was all about Lothar and the Second War. Honestly I can‚Äôt remember the last time I found one in game. Maybe during WotLK for the Dalaran achievement. It just suddenly brought back all these memories of hunting them in vanilla.
---
I kinda have to agree. OP post just reminds me something a manchild would be happy about.
---
There is an easy quest you can do on lowbie alts for good exp.
---
Yeah I've understood that gear for warriors scale much better at raid-level and end game so that is nice at least haha!
---
This right here. I tap down to where once I sit down to eat my health and Mana will both regen to 100% at the same time without having to use water. 
---
Anecdotally, when I've tapped down to nearly no life between pulls and then sat down to eat, a lot of times the healer has blasted me with heals anyways. So I used food AND they used Mana, and thus had to use more water. That's the real frustrating part.
---
Honestly. Okay the game how you want to. If you have fun making alts man, make some alts. You like twinking, make some Twinks. You like PvP, PvP your face off. It‚Äôs a game chosen to be played literally HOWEVER you want to, as long as you‚Äôre having fun.
---
Vana KoS work for ally too, it's perfect for that.
---
You even have a warning when a bad player or a good player enter your group/raid
---
Thanks!
---
self fulfilling prophecy
---
its ridiculous. people are being ridiculous.  
---
the whole paranoia about dead realms is laughable.
---
Same with my Elemental/resto shaman. That sounds disappointing really.
---
In time, you will know the tragic extent of my failings..
---
I'm surprised more people don't understand that the low droprates is purposely put there specifically so you'll grind exp.
---
I'm having a fucking blast doing all this stuff, even the fact that quest items take up an inventory slot adds to the RPG feeling. Mind you I might not enjoy doing the same zones on a second character, but that's not something they had in mind at the time. If you want a world that's really alt friendly, you get the retail questing experience. Which ruins the RPG feeling.
---
Because inside is the world of Warcraft.
---
Isn't it 90 if you have honored which you most likely will?
---
Can't happen to a pally, it's one of the only things they're going to hotkey
---
The developers were also hardcore mmo fans as well, at least Rob Pardo and Jeff Kaplan. I read that there was a guild in everquest for blizz employees.
---
If I were to buy BfA would that unlock all the previous expacs?

First off, sunder Armor is your main threat generator and you should be able to hold aggro on multiple targets using sunder Armor tab target to the next enemy and sunder Armor them 
---
You don‚Äôt want to be using heroic strike unless you have already put 5 stacks of sunder Armor on the target, or they are really low.
---
My rotation normally goes something like
---
Charge&gt;demoralising shout&gt; defensive stance&gt; blood rage &gt; sunder Armor/rend target/s &gt; taunt if you lose aggro. 
---
Hope that helps

I never knew who this tool was until 2 days ago. I never played wow before until Classic. Then all I hear is this guy being talked about over and over. How famous he is. How much of an idol he is. His face is everything imagined in a professional wow player, with the attitude to boot.
---
I'm level 36 and have been literally nolifing the game, so I choose to hope 39 is well above average level
---
Hunters can't even wear mail until lvl 40 lol

Hello mate, if you are still looking for a group just add me Chandran. Or you can message an officer from &lt;The Hearth&gt;. We have a guild of mature people who just want to login after work, kill some bosses have some wipes and have fun. We are all levelling right now, you can join us.
---
I want thottbot back, all these websites are okish
---
Good times!  This brings back some memories.  It took us FOREVER to pull this guy there.  I think it was me walking backwards for like 2 hours with 35 healers.  We messed up once and he leashed back and had to start over.  The main joke here was that we never let anyone kill the Emerald Dragons and people complained, so we gave them one.
---
Took me a while to read the first sentence but have my upvote you genious
---
&gt; I'm looking at the realm list now 8:40 PM EST Monday night and only three servers are "low." The rest are medium or more, which means virtually all of the servers are getting the complete Vanilla experience. 
---
I'm confused. Isn't this post *about* those three low pop servers? If they're dead (dead meaning can't reliably get groups, as a minimum definition)
---
&gt; As Blizzard said: a medium pop server has more people on it today than the fullest servers of 2006. 
---
This post isn't about those servers? What is your comment replying to?
---
Jesus christ
---
Not the person you responded to but my big issue is the way she is limiting the reach of her weapons by holding them backwards in an attempt to look cool. Though maybe she is suckering in men who will find out the hard way that she's not some dumb woman. 
---
Other than I thought the ankles looked thin and thus weak. And the same with those kneepads. It might look cooler if they were more rugged. 
---
But overall very appealing. Thanks for sharing.

This deserves an upvote

Potion, nature's swiftness or someone else healed them.
---
Druid leveling is fun. I can do all 3 dungeon roles decently well, especially if I keep a few pieces of  +int +spirit in my bank. And the actually leveling part has been pretty smooth.

it could be Nature's Swiftness( 3min CD)

We are an old group of players that started playing during our university years and we are still going at it! Everyone is around his or her 30s, everyone has a job and family. We are logging in to relax and play some good quality WoW. Even though our Schedule is relaxed and can be considered as casual, our mentality is not so much. We want to enjoy the game, and we love the challenge of it. Nevertheless, the toxic competition mentality has no place among us.
---
We are levelling right now, but we are planning to do endgame content in a laidback schedule with tenacity. We are in between casual and semi-hardcore style. You can level at your own pace. You can play as casual. You can focus on PvP only, or PvE only. It‚Äôs your call. However we want you to respect everyone‚Äôs time when you join a guild event and bring your best game into the table. You don‚Äôt have to be a pro, basic enthusiasm to learn and ability to accept feedback is all you need in The Hearth.
---
We will decide on a raid schedule with all our level 60s when most of us get there. There will be no more than 2 raids per week. We all have a real life and we do not want to burn out from this game. Planning to play for a good enough time during all phases.
---
Remember: We are all human. We play this game to have fun and relax.

All of the LV 50 Class Quests are not currently in the game.
---
I'm willing to spend hours of free-time for good water.
---
Nature‚Äôs Swiftness. Insta cast on any nature spell. It‚Äôs a talent point in the resto tree. 3 minute cool-down ability.
---
You mean the president of Blizzard? That's still just fucking weird to me.
---
yeah but you had that 95% alterac valley win rate!
---
Not really. You should buy four 6-slot bags ASAP and after that bag space is pretty much not an issue unless you want to do 5 quests at a time.
---
Tab sunder tab sunder tab sunder
---
Not gonna lie, feels like real life is just the unavoidable engine to be able to live in Azeroth when playing Classic. The fact that gameplay is not just "get to 60 -&gt; gear up -&gt; done" is the most compelling part.
---
Wanna be a rogue/priest whose life goal is just to sit in that one boat and harrass opposition? It's relevant.  
---
Wanna be a master salesman of stranglekelp? It's relevant.  
---
Peacekeeper in STV? Saves HOURS from your faction and is very relevant.  
---
Resident locksmith for all those pesky locked boxes people lug around? You got it.  
---
That one guy everyone knows who can do any enchant? Go for it.  
---
Literal nicest guy on the server who even the enemy faction refuses to kill because he's so nice? Absolutely.  
---
Specialize in killing ogres for runecloth? Sure.
---
I think it has a lot to do with not being able to do everything. You have to choose and because of that other people need you for those tasks they didn't choose. You don't have this is retail anymore, but I'm not even terribly worried about it since I have classic to play now.
---
Then that's fine, imo, it just doesn't make sense to say that you just wanted to take a look inside as though the guy should have not assumed you were looting it. It's okay to say you were just looting it but didn't notice him.
---
To all people reading quest text I suggest checking out the Immersion classic addon. It made me read it in retail.
---
You saying this is your first experiencing this as a healer makes me think you‚Äôre just bullshitting the whole thing
---
Mine is f1
---
Damn, thats illigal...
---
They only hunt in packa. Alone they √§r very peaceful.
---
Finish the grind once. Force yourself. It will feel great when you've done it. Then do as many alts as you like.
---
There‚Äôs a ton of people who are Clearing MC yet. Maybe 15 guilds in the world so far. It‚Äôs never too late to start. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Ive done kind of the same thing. I made a Playlist of all the music I listened to back then. It's like nostalgia overload and I hope they keep this going.
---
Have you tried to actually play the game when you play the game?
---
oh damn. I was playing on yojamba just last night. Are you playing from AU?
---
When I play on my priest I try to buff everyone I meet.
---
A hunter that has not named his pet will not get my buff.
---
Good luck but I doubt you will still be 30 by the time you complete the quest. I'd start getting the stuff done at 35-ish and go from there.
---
that's a fantastic way to put it
---
The strat is almost always invalidated by making posts like this.
---
Feelsbadman
---
They have a version you can put on and run from USB no installation. I'm sure theres a way to set it up to access through a web page as well although I'm not familiar with it it's definitely out there.
---
That quest is under-leveled. It is not a normal quest, you're fighting level 39 monsters at level 30 and a level 40 elite monster. Do the quest when the monsters at your level which makes the weapon at best a "meh" weapon unlike how those youtubes want you to believe it is.
---
Thats not a psa
---
As I said before: retail is primarily UI driven, whereas Classic is rather happening in the 3D world. This doesn't mean one thing is worse than the other. If you like Classic: play Classic. If you prefer Retail: play Retail. If you like both: play both.
---
why not get 300 polearm skill? Peacemaker is pre-raid bis.
---
You do you :) I like Undead for it's Utility, but that 5% Int is \*perfect\*
---
I sold off the gear I was wearing to just scrape by. Worth it.
---
My gf has snow leopard named boar because she wanted to tame boar first but everything was dead near her and single snow leopard just spawned.
---
Last boss is the only reason to go uldaman since his quest gives you the 14 slot bag.
---
Just like the animals they are.
---
Also it was all strength...
---
To be fair, an affliction lock does not need to start a fight anywhere near full hp or mana. If both are around 50% or higher, there‚Äôs really no need to eat or drink. 
---
Since most locks level as affliction, that‚Äôs why you likely see a lot of locks standing around with chunks of HP and mana missing.
---
Horde pals rejoice, there's a lv24 quest in Camp Taurajo to get a similar lantern (https://classicdb.ch/?quest=893 Weapons of Choice) or you can get one from the horses in Shadowfang Keep.
---
A couple of years back in retail I was always playing with the inky black potion to render "real night", but as a warrior I couldn't get access to off-hand quests reward like torches and such lanterns...
---
where mankirk wife?1
---
This guy is my favorite. Who is he again?
---
Yes. As an occasional DM...absolutely this.
---
This is pretty much the reason why I've avoided getting addons like questie.
---
yep, and a 110 boost, but I'd leave that, you'd want to see what happened to the world after the deathwing did a number on it, I mean half of barrens is now overgrown jungle, thousand needles is flooded, all sorts happened.
---
Oooohh, so thaaat'w why. Go kill the big dudes around ST, nobody farms those
---
i wanna be able to solo as much as possible as efficiently as possible, buit as im super new to warlocks in vanilla, i dont know if i should Void build or drain tanking.   
---
Dotting multiple mobs and draining seems fun, but i've always through you needed void for that, and that without void your kinda stuck to 1-3 mobs.
---
Damn that's freaky
---
Clearly not on a pvp server trying to get through stv
---
Hey. It's okay. You did the right thing.
---
What class are you? It's pretty rare druids have specced 21 pts resto while levelling and have NS.
---
God damn huntards
---
150% classic wow is infinitely better
---
Of course you don't mind
---
Not if they're doing it properly in a macro, it'll be too fast to purge.
---
Some people are just pansies. Most are filled with ego and dont see themselves on the same level as you. You are their for them. If you waste their time, they dont care about yours. Game is a couple weeks old but everyone is rush rush rush, level level level. Which is fine, it's their sub, but when they act childish about rudimentary mechanics, I understand it's hard to not be frustrated. I had a dude rage quit a group because he didnt want to wait 5minutes to get summoned to the other side of the world. He expected it right then. Gaming wont ever be what it once was, dont expect that kind of nostalgia from classic wow. Its 2019. Narcissism and entitlement is rampant on the internet.
---
I'm not OP but I really need this for my Priest! Thanks!
---
Macro it
---
Yeah, I have no idea how I managed to play on vanilla US servers with \~275 ping for so long.
---
There's no img bro.
---
I lost Strike of the Hydra to a hunter. Never again.
---
One of my friends plays a hunter and when he's LFG he adds a disclaimer saying he's not a moron that will roll need on any weapon that isn't an ability stat stick. He still has issues finding groups but he can't blame people for it.
---
I'm the only druid in my 30 person guild, but at least as a feral druid I always find a group as tank.
---
RIGHT?
---
I'd be happy if they brought in the new content but without the associated BS mechanical changes.
---
If you're making such a statement at least elaborate a bit. How is it wrong?
---
Hmmm, after reviewing OP's comment spree against you I've decided to be logical and take my downvotes back, and given upvotes in their stead, seems OP is just... Disturbing. Good luck with the report!
---
Meanwhile, the mages I run into trying to train my priest skills in Ironforge are always so chipper about their advice of befriending a mage.
---
Gnomes don't deserve the hate.
---
They forgot the entire MMORP part. Modern wow is just a G.
---
This was my first thought also.
---
Yes, but we honour a far greater hero! Uther lightbringer.
---
My personal expirience
---
\- Bite does a bit less dmg, but your pet won't get out of focus, so you are able to "taunt" all the time
---
\- Claw does \~10 % more dps, but your pet is constantly out of focus
---
Using both is a burst gain, I don't think it's a real dps gain over claw.
---
Pet taunt is available every 10 levels (10, 20, 30, ...) so I'd say at the last 3 levels before the new pet taunt, bite is much better, because your pet won't lose aggro. In between, both are okay. I don't want to tame new pets for each rank of claw, bite, so I just use the highest ranking ability. If I have to choose, I'd just use bite
---
Just my 2 cents, I'm a noob as well :)
---
Pretty sure paladins gave up everything too.
---
This should bea sticky
---
You rogues sure are a contentious people
---
In my case I just vendored the heavy leather because I would lose money by selling those on the ah. The thick leather I sold on the ah for about 1.3g-1.5g
---
Yep, "together" everything becomes as hell lot more managable. Actually making the journey to 60 a social experience instead of ppl just doing stuff alongside players that might aswell be npcs.
---
This is why u want CC in ur group
---
But then again everytime they make me visit another zone or multiples in retail it feels familiar to this. HoA quests, Legion artifact quests, these were all very nice and for a small time the world felt like it was an actual world I am in with zones and storylines existing without me being the grand champion pivotal to that story.
---
I feel like the story has grown too big in retail and I enjoy much more being that random adventurer who just happened upon the trogg problem in Loch Modan, didn't even solve it just helped a bit and got paid.
---
lock,37 and just questing. but if there are some specific good solo grinding spots i can go for them too. anyway waiting for the link, thanks
---
Damn bro, mvp post for a lot of players
---
Nah he uses the arrow keys
---
Cuz aoe dps in retail is a bit different lol most dumbass mages just heard their favorite YouTuber say like omg guys mages are so good in classic wow they can aoe spam dungeons and level so fast smash that like button and subscribe for more content!!!
---
Without realizing this isnt retail and something called threat exists in classic. ESPECIALLY as a fuckin warlock you gotta chill before that rain of fire Jesus lol
---
I just like taking breaks after a wipe, everyone else can run back. Ppl don't seem too happy most of the time.
---
You actually believe this. You probably play hunter.
---
yeah, that timbermaw rep farming is leagues above world quests.
---
lol, i was here from release, only just pinged 26 last night
---
Printscrn. Ctrl v. 
---
So fucking hard amirite.
---
Wait damn it, that wasn't funny at all.
---
If you watch the 5Second rule, go for Willpower.
---
If you have enough mana and rarely run oom then go for healing power.
---
Fair point. People who do that shit suck twice as much.
---
savage af
---
Dont forget that you MUST keep growl ON at ALL times, especially in dungeons to help the Tank.
---
YOU‚ÄôVE JUST MADE AN ENEMY FOR LIFE
---
Only in Classic, not in BC. Alterac Valley was about 50/50. Alliance was just so extremely bad on my server at least.
---
As a druid tank just spam demoralizing roar, if you have excess rage you can maul.
---
&gt;Most of the people who said Classic wouldn't work weren't trying to be cruel or antagonist, they legitimately thought there wasn't a playerbase for the game. 
---
What they were was worse: ignorant. Private servers like Nolstarius (with tens of thousands of active players) proved the demand existed, and this was before that knob from Blizz made the infamous "you think you want it, but you don't" comment.
---
If anything, I'd expect this to be more popular since there's both the marketing, and the  lack of constant threat of Blizzard shutting you down hanging over your head.
---
No I‚Äôm not. May be that‚Äôs the reason. Ticket is submitted hopefully can play soon..
---
People can't even do this dungeon on retail.
---
Hirumaredx makes some entertaining videos. 
---
I also love Nixxiom. I actually downloaded twitch to watch more of him.
---
Happends to me all Day long
---
Thanks man. I didn‚Äôt mean to trigger the guy, I was just browsing the sub while I flew to ratchet. Might be better to just avoid saying anything even slightly negative to avoid this sort of thing in the future.
---
Guess we know what they were hoping to get at the end of the night.
---
It's not "broken AF" if other classes are not simply helpless prey for you?
---
They do, yes. But they're often targeted towards network bridges nowadays, rather than an actual server farm, meaning that the protection needs to be elsewhere
---
Not really, paladins, have more OP life savers and druids have never been the dominant class in pvp
---
Final Fantasy 2 had an interesting system where one of your primary stats was raised by running away from battle. This is that.
---
99% of guilds and pugs will invite anyone who can click a button and do some dmg giving he/she has some functional brain cells and will not get himself in bad positions.
---
Okay, I was going to call the Mage an asshole but then I watched all the way through the video and now he's a hero.
---
I was doing a quest in the badlands to collect a quest item. Killed about 8 whelps before a Dark Whelpling dropped and about 4 more before the quest item dropped.
---
Don't forget to curse of weakness their pet. It makes a massive difference.
---
Total Role Play and My Role Play. They're both RP addons that allow you to make bios and the like
---
hahahaha, you #$#%!@
---
50% man, 50% bear, 50% pig!
---
Could it be related to the insanely fast spawns in classic?
---
I really like this fact. This causes for example only dropy heavy armor and 2h in an "armory" Thats immersion! Not every boss has a full loot table squeezed in it. At least in dungeons.
---
Considering to came to reddit to vent. It seems those kids got out of you what they sought after. Dont let them win man.
---
Yes, your life is over, you missed this once in a lifetime opportunity.
---
I always heal and buff Warriors when I see them. Just feels like the right thing to do.
---
Haha now druids are ‚Äúbroken af‚Äù.
---
They took the world out of World of Warcraft. It's pretty clear the change of direction. You logged into vanilla and entered a big open unpredictable world. You log into retail now and you enter a Disney land where everything is carefully curated and no experience is left to chance. It's sterile and soulless. Classic/vanilla can be frustrating, it can be rage inducing, it can be difficult and piss you off. But without the possibility of failure, victory is underwhelming.
---
Stick with the shield and use battleshout to generate aoe threat. If it works as it should buffing party members generates threat and when you buff your entire party it generates a reasonable amount. Debuffing foes also generates threat so demo shout generates threat.
---
Go for a piercing howl build. Makes it easy to control packs of mobs when you can aoe slow them. Shouts will usually generate enough threat to keep the mobs off the healer.
---
This is most effective when rage starts being easy to generare 50+, but even at low levels it can help with big aoe packs, especially keeping them off the healer.
---
there was also a new german server released
---
lol yeah. this thread is fuckin pathetic. classic wow is not that good of a game, especially compared to woltk and mop.
---
Obligatory https://youtu.be/Qas9vDLW__c
---
It also has a quest for players level 30+ to honor their champion (Uther for alliance, Grom for horde). The quest gives 6600 xp for running to the respective hero's resting place and using a tribute.
---
I used Questie just because wandering around not accomplishing anything isn't appealing to me - and actually doing quests will have you covering most of the ground anyways.
---
You're not missing anything by using it.
---
The only thing I kinda mind is that the game has like 2 or 3 different layouts for caves. Once you've seen them, you've seen them all.
---
The friend I was going to level with got a concussion at work and still has headaches if he's looking at a screen for too long, so my "main" is still in loch modan.
---
Lvl33 and got 13 g on my warr. Im filthy rich
---
If you wanna do it on that level you really gonna need some help. Maybe you can ask in your guild or some other friends? :)
---
Neat
---
It's what we do...
---
Come over to the horde... we have cookies.
---
Because by the time you hey 2 or more sunders the mob is already dead. This only works against elites since normal enemies die far too quickly. +58 damage with rank 5 HS is huge, especially with a crit.
---
Nice time. I‚Äôm trying out the hunter kite method and goblin+princess takes me around 18 mins with quest greens and a lvl 50 bow.
---
r/gatekeeping in WoWClassic. Just sad tbh.
---
At first I thought you had bad luck then realized you did multiple runs with the same people after getting scammed the first run.
---
Never do that again. Ever.
---
Seriously! I've always thought myself as a pretty intense lore nerd with WoW but there is so much I had absolutely no idea about simply because I didn't read alot of text when I was a kid.
---
Each zone really does feel alive once you immerse yourself and it's kind of crazy how grand of a narrative it is they created! The fact that simple level 5 fetch quests hint at something being amiss with Stormwind and connects to onyxia 55 levels later is insane
---
You need a main so you can afford to hear up and utilize those alts. You're never going to get those cool gears unless you buckle down and master one class first. You're seeing all these cuties in dungeons and get infatuated by on your heart you know the one for you even if you're having anxiety about never sleeping with another class again.
---
Even when I tell healers not to worry about healing me when I tap after pulls this still happens. It's like they can't be comfortable seeing someone at 75% hp, nevermind the self healing I can do if I need to.
---
Uh shield bash and fear?
---
You clearly never played serious pvp
---
Has he had to do the vile reef quest yet lol
---
They must keep it VERY Clean, because there's no flies on it...
---
6.6k flat
---
TBC and Legion are my favourites.
---
Yeah, they are sold so cheap (2s at AH) that they can be earned back within a few minutes. Pick up one, fill it, sell it and buy the next one or two bags. They are not BoE so once you can afford upgrades you can send them to your next toon you want to level.
---
Yeah I almost went Mage instead of Lock just purely because Mage is 100000 times more DMG than Locks in Raids. But, I just knew i‚Äôd PvP more and Lock‚Äôs more fun in PvP in my opinion. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm glad the Lock grind is over and now can play a Mage.
---
Even in BC I would have to tab every single thing in the pull and swipe them and just tab through entire packs over and over until dead.
---
this is why classoc is amazing... i cant remember the last quest i actually read in retail
---
Like every time?
---
Cat form for sure makes things faster. I thought bear was a decent bump in speed but running around as basically a rogue with +30% movement speed feels great.
---
Thank you for explaining, that makes sense.
---
Sure thing, it was just a quick vid I uploaded to help some guildies so no commentary or anything. But here you go! Thanks!

&lt;Wraiths&gt; [H] NA (EST) ‚Äì PvP | (Mon)/Wed/Sun 7:30-10:30pm | Semi-hardcore | EPGP-Loot Council hybrid w/ point decay + minimum point requirement | Server: Kromcrush 
---
ABOUT US:
---
-          Attract and assemble a community of people who already think the way we do, not trying to change the way you think or sell you on our idea of how you should play the game.

(M)-W-Sun 7:30-10:30pm EST
---
-          Additional raid night (MONDAYS) will be scheduled as needed, contingent on member gearing needs
---
LEADERSHIP:
---
-          Led raids and cleared MOST of WoW‚Äôs content from Vanilla through Legion.
---
-          Holds a duelist title in 3v3 and has led RBGs to the 2200 level
---
ATTITUDE:
---
-         You should be someone that has a growth mindset and is predominantly optimistic.
---

Message me for more info or add/message on discord: treN-#3330

You don't need your shield for anything but your interrupt or some defensives. You can switch to defensive and use taunt and so on while still using a 2h. I only put a shield on if shit is hitting the fan and I need to tank a LOT of mobs or there's a caster I need to interrupt. Otherwise a 2h does much more damage, which also means much more threat, which makes the whole Dungeon easier.
---
I refuse. Unless I get below half health during a pull just let me do my thing. Cannibalize, bandage, healthstone, siphon life, and drain life are all either part of my in-combat rotation or downtime rotation in combination with life tap. Warlocks who complain about not getting heals in downtime or who complain about not being topped off when they're above half health are bad and they should feel bad.
---
this is bullshit. there are plenty of chains in classic you miss because you don't want to do one of the starter quests, you miss the entire Hillsbrad chain ending in the dwarven elite outpost if you can't be bothered to camp the 4 named mobs that are constantly overcamped in the first quest, you will miss plenty of dungeons quests that are the endings on chains you never see just because they are taking you all over the world and rewards arent visible at first etc.
---
macro is the way:
---
\#showtooltip &lt;spellname&gt;
---
 /run for i=1, GetNumShapeshiftForms() do \_, name, active = GetShapeshiftFormInfo(i) if( active \~= nil ) then CastShapeshiftForm(i) break end end 
---
/cast &lt;Spellname&gt;
---
paste this into a macro, this will cancel any form and cast the spell. careful about powershifting, it seems to like to leave out feral talent buffs if you shift between forms too fast
---
I'm 35 and have like 12g too - but i aint scared .. me Warlock :P
---
Nobody gives a shit, stop giving him attention.
---
You won't, if you're not incredibly lucky. That's about the gold you should have at 35. Don't worry, even with heavy grinding from 30-40, it's a bit luckbased to get the 90 gold (just 100g if you're not honored)
---
Feel the same following the story of the Dead Mines and Van Clief, and how it leads into the Stockcades.
---
r/toorealformeirl
---
Haha exactly. The extra damage is huge too, throw in crit modifier and it's a much larger than white hit. There is something here but to say rarely use HS is foolish and to spread the word like it's fact is irritating.
---
Don‚Äôt know what you are talking about. I have seen dumb shit written in general chat but my player to player experience has been nothing but forthcoming and nice. On horde side of a pvp server.
---
Maybe I've been doing it wrong. I just be handing out fat stacks for free to everyone I come across while roaming long distances.
---
Yeah when I checked later druids are also not super common, but I think that's a matter of it being limited to one race only. On my server I'm not sure how much night elves are picked, but I'd venture to guess last place or second to last after gnomes.
---
The ARPG part started being a thing when you could proc an instacast, run while casting and basically having a third person shoulder view diablo.
---
I love Diablo 2, but that game style does not fit with WoW.
---
Man that's when I play pretty much. Server doesn't seem to pick up until the morning (I'm also on Ol Blanchey). 
---
My advice is just make a group if you can. Grouping up makes everything better!
---
&gt;So what is heroic strike good for? Just nothing then?
---
Dumping rage while raid tanking, with the damage you take by raid mobs you usually have rage overload and Heroic Strike does bonus threat
---
That's just swag points. But when I Ask someone, who can obviously be busy doing his own shit, going out of his way to water me up, hell imma tip
---
(I'm gonna edit this to be more ye olde english. My opinion only of course. Might have a thy where I should have a thine here or there.)
---
If thou rollest a Night Elf, thou shalt indeed take thine Pilgrimage and shew it all the respect it is due. Thou who wouldst fain cheat thine sacred quest shall be exiled from thy people of Darnassus, may-it-never-burn, and mayest indeed find thyself more inclined to the foulness of the Quel'dorei.
---
Stance swap is on it‚Äôs own cooldown, not GCD, and it‚Äôs slightly shorter than GCD. Zerker rage is on GCD. It is one GCD. Source I have done it a thousand times in the last 2 weeks
---
FFXIV is kinda this IMO.
---
Meant the fear bomb you called after.
---
Why are you laying on your desk?
---
I really got back into WoW classic after not playing in forever because I was jonesing for some D&amp;D and just don‚Äôt have he time or schedule right now for it.
---
I haven't renamed him yet because I only get one chance...
---
It's the Swift Brown Steed, human racial mount
---
Actually wasn‚Äôt a lvl 60 war, he was only marginally stronger than the hordies here and ended up sacrificing himself so the mage could escape.
---
Managed to just scrape by yesterday with just having the tank at 44 and everyone else 42 or 41! Was a real close call though haha
---
Clearly. Shield bash shares cd with pummel and fear is a non issue as well because if you're feared they're not hitting you lol. Seriously burn your faps against mages if you want, not gonna do much if the mage is decent tho, gonna be same result you'll just be down a pot.
---
Cc of some sort
---
Yeah I remember taking a few months off in the 40s back in the day. So grindy.
---
I‚Äôd recommend taking it easy for a bit, eg stop playing when rested xp runs out. 
---
It picks up again in the 50s.
---
I am a warlock as well but still loot everything - i need it to level all my proffs as well as i can afford to upgrade most if not all skills that way. Does not take a lot of time, and i have picked up quote a few nice greens and even blues as well already (they finance my bankalt that is a level 1 with a lot more gold then i have).
---
Mechanicals can be hit by Bleed attacks there? The ones in Westfall and DM can't, they're immune to Rend.
---
Yes it does.
---
 8-9 Gold is not much considering its a BiS helm for feral druid. I would buy it now, apparently the one selling it doesnt know the value of it.
---
no actual data but most people say there‚Äôs more horde
---
Windows + Shift + S
---
Way better.
---
why are all people using staves? I grinded several RFK runs for corpsemaker. And although WF has 20% chance it feels like it has 5% :/ considering going back to rockbitter
---
I actually had the same experience on my first character, a warrior like you, way back in Vanilla.
---
I'm sure some warriors around here can provide more useful advice than I, but what I did way back then was reroll to a Mage. There's gotta be a better way, though.
---
You just press ctrl V in reddit or discord?
---
My 17 Druid tanked it easy, no big hits. lul
---
Matter of fact, often times a S/O can be the cause of both
---
there are more horde on every server
---
/cancelform gives me issues with feral talents, the one I posted further up is a little more reliable, but still sometimes has issues sometimes when using it to powershift.
---
I know it sounds corny when somebody tells you you already know the answer to that question, but you already know the answer to that question. Because burnout is a feeling you have. Based on how much you have played.
---
Burnout is an inevitability. It's not something to be feared. Reevaluate your goals for having fun in the game.
---
Must say, its funny how this 2006 gameplay is such a breath of fresh air nowadays, we've become so accustomed to the snoozefest that is modern game design.
---
nah, many of the quests are required story progress, because you're the hero of the story and you need to save everyone to save the world
---
And they also put stuff on AH below vendor price (or think they are above and forget the deposit they also have to pay).
---
Thank you my friend!
---
Mount is 72, skill is 18 if you are honored, otherwise its 80 and 20 gold.
---
Ouf, no way, no way :D
---
\-you choose a specialisation at lvl 10
---
\-specs have different spells (can't use Pyroblast if you're frost mage) and somewhat forced to specific weapon type (enh shaman is forced to dual wield or he can't use his spells because they "require a one handed weapon")
---
\-you get a choice of one talent every 15 levels, you choose one from 3
---
Theoretically we're totally literally getting 100k xp per hour. No foolies!
---
This sub is basically /r/Asmongold with a bit of wow classic in it..  
---
I don't understand people who fanboy.  
---
I don't understand people who hate.  
---
Just either watch or don't watch the stream, and if you want to, discuss within that community.
---
I have organs.
---
They're not mine, but I have them.
---
I life tap and regain naturally + with bandage...
---
Still Nothing. Hasn't worked all day.
---
Have fun
---
No world pvp, no character customization aside from aesthetics, bad dungeon pvp and raids are standing in instance circles?
---
FFXIV isn‚Äôt for me. I tried really hard. I picked up and stopped 3-4 times. 
---
Combat is too slow, the main story quest is fucking brutally slow and a bunch of fetch quests, and the dungeons are completely forgettable. I made it to 35 before quitting of boredom and it took so long.
---
Then no world pvp, no thanks.
---
Dude. They turn it into leather.
---
My oh my, my husbands best friend had the same thing. We went from convos about severs being down to somber convos. Worst part is we don‚Äôt really have the same time slots for leveling so I can‚Äôt really help him now :(
---
plus it didnt really have that world feel, at least to me personally. The game is way too light-hearted, way too comical and cartoonish to take seriously.
---
This is probably a retail mentality, and tbh it's a hard one to shake. I remember the first stat squish in MoP I really had to dig in and remind myself that they don't need to be at 100% health, 100% of the time. If they're alive, they're fine. 
---
It's just kinda second nature on retail to heal people up because you hardly ever have mana issues as a healer, only in raids do I ever go oom sometimes and that's even hard to do and takes AGES. Meanwhile my 17 priest goes OOM on 1 enemy lmao.
---
You must not read too well. It would not be.
---
Not if you only do dungeons.
---
"But there is another benefit to using Sunder Armor in this fashion: you are triggering more swings for the enemy to dodge and therefore gives you a lot more opportunities for Overpower, your single best skill until level 36."
---
That's the main reason I started using it. After some time I also realised that it's much easier to deal with higher level mobs this way.
---
There's a reson I didn't buy heroic strike
---
A ran Gnomer twice yesterday. On 3 occasions a massive group of mobs came out of nowhere and wiped us. I have no idea why but I assume it was someone pulled a mob on a different level. 
---
The first time it was entertaining, the second and third times it was really annoying. I‚Äôm not going back on other characters.
---
Work for a king, or work for a god. That's really what classic vs retail is.
---
Shimmering Flats must be the zone where the GM trolls the DnD group then.
---
A lvl 32 quest that sends you to SV to kill underwater lvl 38-40 ELITE murlocs for 2k XP and 20 silver.
---
A lvl 34 quest that sends you to Swamp of Sorrows to grind dragon whelps.
---
A lvl 32 quest that sends you to Badlands to talk to a dude as Horde.
---
And once you are done with 1k Needles you go to Desolace where the only graveyard is in the middle of the map, the flight path is in the opposite corner of the entrance and level 33 mobs are mixed with level 40.
---
Should have rolled a nelf, that wisp form is the most op passive in the game for a warrior.
---
Ive always liked the idea of dotting multiple mobs and having some ccd and just drain\\dot never stop, massacring a whole camp solo, before moving on too the next unfortunate mobs.  
---
But ive always been under the assumption that you need voidwalker for that, too be efficient never stop killing machine.  As to not die or be squisher then a lvl 15 mage in ICC.   
---
what kind of people would you recommend Void tanking vs draintanking for ?.
---
I‚Äôm a new player who ran Pyrewood Village for the first time a few nights ago.
---
No idea what I was stepping into, just had a quest to retrieve a journal. Saw someone in chat say they were heading there for ‚Äúthe Pyrewood quests‚Äù, plural. I asked to group, and suddenly I‚Äôm in a party of 5 - I‚Äôm wondering, ‚ÄúWhy so many people?‚Äù Werewolves, that‚Äôs why. It‚Äôs a town of werewolves.
---
:P
---
lmao im not the one who thinks DDOS attackers shouldn't be jailed. you're an idiot
---
Katrina‚Äôs mad (x38)
---
*sigh*
---
*unzips*
---
Hey i‚Äôve made a classic transmog sub! Do you want to show off your classic style armour combination? r/Classicwowtransmog
---
Well put.
---
Lol thottbot was very imperfect
---
did you also load the Atlas classic plugin?
---
this is such a refreshing change from "OH ITS YOU, THE HERO OF THE UNIVERSE"
---
This is also sensible, you will notice even when dpsing that other tanks will let you get aggro and not even bother trying to pull the add off you (maybe its because I'm a warrior idk)
---
In any event the boss and higher level elites of the dungeons are the priority, so I pull smaller mobs as the dungeon goes on as well. 
---
I tanked alot more in cata-BoA, frankly it was stupidly easy.
---
There are restrooms on the wyvern flights?
---
Because the gameplay and progress of retail is too fast to appreciate small things like these.
---
Intended game design
---
Of course I'm not being serious. If the mage *or* the tank were any good, the tank would have grabbed two packs, and the mage would have opened with flamestrike and then slow and freeze the mobs with CoC and frost nova. Frozen enemies will hit the nearest target, and that will be the tank.
---
Tbh me and my friend have had way too much fun with the clown look of our characters. It really funny to look ridiculous and do cool stuff.
---
Only an idiot would take that route. You obviously take the boat to Theramore and then swim north for about 20 minutes to get to Ratchet.
---
Lol it gets dark out here
---
Well done! Do you think a Rogue could do this at 60 after gearing up half decently?
---
Claw can be set off auto-cast though, which is what I did immediately after I realized how much it dumps Focus which lead to none for much needed Growls while some mob was chasing my ass.
---
Screech follows the same rules as Claw where it's a no CD 20 Focus spender that'll drain your focus if you leave it on auto-cast.
---
This screenshot is edited. It doesn‚Äôt look that blatantly highlighted in game. Still funny tho.
---
So many butthurt Alliance players in here, lol
---
Commenting to find later - thanks ‚úåÔ∏è
---
It doesn't speed up anything if the healer has mana left but the DPS is OOM.
---
For alliance priests, you could go Hypnotic Blade and Orb of Lorica (SM quest reward).
---
I guess you did not make it very far ... being at level 20 they could probably smell you all the way up to Blackrock mountain :)
---
It's because they saw steeamers doing it at 30.
---
But not understanding how and why they did it.
---
Once you hit 36 you have an instant attack that is tied to berserk stance.  You should be using whirlwind as your primary rage spender after 36, and so you will be in berserk stance anyway solo.
---
:)
---
Fantastic shitpost
---
It's pretty easy to find out if you organise with someone on the other faction to run a census at the same time as you, or if you have two accounts just run them both at the same time yourself. It will give you a snapshot of all characters logged in over that time which should be decently representative of the playerbase.
---
https://i.redd.it/ludape5n9kl31.png
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/census-plus
---
I don't really agree with that assessment unless you can give a better example of what you mean.
---
WoW has always had this weird medium-pace action that is actually a fluctuation between slow and fast. You can have periods of nothing where the action is slow because you're CCd or someone is bombing heals, mixed in with moments where someone goes 100-0 in one GCD.
---
I'm not saying combat hasn't suffered over the years, but you're comment is very vague so maybe I'm not understanding.
---
?? what about this is spoiler
---
Im feeling the exact same on my mage and I'm only level 43. I only play the character with the only friend left playing from our group of 5 who started together. We spent about 2 hours trying to collect 15 hearts and 15 tongues for about 3k exp after turning in the quest. 
---
Only thing I can advise as it's working for me is to make an alt and just enjoy It, play slowly. I'm having a lot more fun when I'm on my mage now even when the quests take ages and give nothing as a reward.
---
This is a very well thought out response, and I agree with you. I can sit here and objectively agree, there is absolutely nothing wrong with providing a service and charging a fee. It's more of a general distate I have developed of seeing every tiny aspect of the game become a weighted scale transaction. What am I giving and what am I getting. I had a person ask me for 10 silver just to join my party to click a warlock portal even though they were questing 30 yards from me at the time. 
---
I am having my very own "get of my lawn" moment in WoW.
---
I‚Äôm fighting for my fucking life
---
Where are these? Feels like it always takes ages for mobs to spawn
---
You forgot block.
---
Blizzard newer explain anything in any game. But being kicked for chest in deadmines .. LoL
---
If they dont want to farm for it then they dont deserve it.
---
Just did it yesterday and nope, doesn't work. Also immune to drain/siphon life.
---
I was walking in some cave with my buddy a few days ago and saw a bunch of skeletons. Saw the mobs were my level- 2 levels below me.
---
We both laughed and said "haha man what kind of noobs die here"
---
Well. The problem about these mobs was, their spawn rate was insane. Our skeletons are laying there now too
---
so, we heard you like snakes..
---
Hahahaha ouch
---
Darkshore is a NE-story area, so you'd otherwise follow its quest flow into Ashenvale.
---
As a lvl 30 alliance I haven't met any reputation vendors yet. Is there anything I'm missing out on?
---
I like the idea of grinding rep if the rewards are decent.
---
I apologize on behalf of the Horde for this Horde Player's failure to understand this reddit post.
---
I really felt this after getting frustrated searching for that damn kodo near thunderbluff, then randomly running across it and some other unique wolf spawn while trying to gather herbs 3 levels later
---
Because of me? \*puppy eyes with tears\*
---
Knowing is half the battle :)
---
Yesterday too i was killing ogres in arathi highlands see these 3 allys attack 2 horde i jump to the mix with my tauren druid. We fuck em up 2 guys dies one escapes. Also i rekt this gnome wlock in the cave 6 times just to be dick. I was killd by some ally moments b4. Seems like tides have turned. For the Horde! Use to play as ally..
---
It seems to only happen when I‚Äôm using a 2-handed weapon, with the exception of Staff.
---
How do you have so little?!
---
Frankly, you shouldn't need it unless you have a really weak weapon for your level, and it will significantly increase downtime. The start of the fight is the time to quickly even the odds. If you start having trouble holding threat, start by looking for opportunities to cc and call a single target. 
---
Personally, I have my execute key bound to skull. Every time I execute (which I like because it's a commonly used key which does nothing for most of any fight), line one of the macro is "/run SetRaidTarget("target",8)", and the second line is "/cast execute". 
---
If you are having trouble focusing a target, the biggest thing you can tell your dps to do is STAY ON THE FOCUS TARGET. 
---
Imagine you have 3 dps. A mob has 1k health. You do no damage, nor does the healer. 
---
Now, each guy stays on the focus target at all times. First of all, only one mob needs to be taunted at once. Secondly, each dps, before the mob dies, generates 333 damage worth of threat, which means YOU need to generate about that much threat.
---
You repeat for each mob. Not only can you then pre build threat on the second target, but you only need 333*3=1000 total threat over the course of the fight. 
---
Now suppose you get some hero rogue "off tank". He wants combo points, so he just picks his own target. 
---
Now he does 1k damage to one mob, and the other 2 guys do 500 each to 2 mobs. 
---
You need to generate 1k threat on 1 mob, 500 threat on 2 mobs, for 2k threat. 
---
by having one dps go off script, you DOUBLE the amount of threat you need to generate over the course of a fight. If everyone picks their own target, they triple it. 
---
Frankly, dps wants things to move along. The difference between a good tank and a bad one is largely :are you respecting the consumables and time of your group? if everyone is buffed, it's YOUR job to protect those bufs. If everyone is spending their time waiting on you, it's your job not to waste it. 
---
There is no shame in not being a good tank, or tanking badly. but I STRONGLY urge you: don't tell your dps to stop dpsing until people start dying. tell them to target differently. You have to be DRAMATICALLY undergeared to lose aggro on the focus target, and the best way to correct this is by banking rage on trash pulls and reducing downtime, which means keeping your dps on the focus target, and frankly, using CC unless you have a good reason not to. Like arms warrior cleave spam, which is frankly so powerful it's fine to let them pull threat off you.
---
Thanks for the info. AOE grinding makes sense and the lucky boe :)
---
Already got it at 33. Asked a guildmate for help and gave him 2g. Got there and alliance + horde were helping eachother on a pvp server so I didn‚Äôt need help from a guildie anyway.
---
I really don‚Äôt understand these posts. I‚Äôll play how I want and get what I want. So will other people.
---
Sadly in general warriors are just terrible until late end game
---
Need that macro lol
---
Mage gets fun at around 44. That's when I started aoe grinding the rocs/hyenas in Tanaris then moved onto Pirates. Found 2 epics in less than 24 hours there
---
I decided to switch to Alliance this time (multiple characters max level on Horde in retail, although I started later than vanilla) and I'm loving it so much.
---
A lot of the zones give me a real Diablo feel, the cities are beautiful, and the game overall just feels very different.  The quests are quite engaging too and don't feel like an endless murderous safari.
---
Also, given that Horde is clearly the majority of most if not all PvP servers you feel like the underdog which I think is fun.
---
Definitely sold on the boys in blue.
---
Nercrosis does exactly what you want. And more!
---
A bunch of us are expats in China and SEA and play on Arugal. For the non Chinese based players were using WTFast and it drops ping by a lot. Try it out.
---
That part isn't out yet.
---
I remember thinking the Mallet of Zul'Farrak was so great I spent half of my gold for a great enchant. 
---
/noob
---
Chickenoodle here! The best part was our tank getting lost halfway through the dungeon lol
---
Good run tho
---
the humble legend.
---
&gt; I only complain when people take too long before they decide to sit to drink.
---
Should warriors make a /time out for mana macro and fully control the pace?  I felt like some priests are kind of hesitant about sitting down to drink in case I go charging into the next pack and they waste 80% of their water by having to get back up.
---
You only need 90g if honored with your faction
---
Maybe it was just on the oversaturated EU servers are launch?
---
Yeah I was lucky my group wiped only once 
---
I failed my sap at the 6mob pack before last boss
---
We did have SS but our big brain priest didnt check to be safe so he got killed by a patrol
---
I knew the way to backdoor so it was a quick recovery and by quick I mean 10min
---
DAE BEER AND CATS
---
TFW you just specced improved heroic strike
---
Thanks. How bad is it with keybindings?  I don‚Äôt have a naga mouse. Also I am thinking about playing a warlock cause I never did and they seem interesting. I am on alliance on horde dominated pvp server. Any tips for leveling?
---
Haha back in the day I remember having a quest to go to SW as a Gnome warlock so I tried to run through Badlands from Loch Modan at level 12....oh how I regretted that choice and was scared to enter Badlands again even when I was the correct level.
---
PF is all about the money and making as much as possible/keeping it in your pocket. This is great because there's tons of good information on there.
---
The bad part is most people take it as gospel, you'll see posts about missing college by a year and them worrying about being able to retire on time etc. etc.
---
Not sure what planet you come from where $25 is worth more than 16 hours. ‚ÄúSerious waste of money‚Äù please.
---
Damn son! RIGHT!?!
---
As a warr that is leveling as prot i second this! I haven't touched heroic strike since i got sunder armor.
---
Waste of rage.
---
Great advice.
---
are... are you serious?
---
Props for the char name
---
Why are you complaining (this term is too harsh for what I think you're doing but I cant think of another) if they're offering to pay? They'd rather spend that time making money another way and spending it to buy.
---
If you want to offer the set for mats only, great. That's kind of you. But if they only want to pay directly with gold and you dont want to do it, move on or charge them extra. If you dont, dont.
---
I'm not accusing you of bitching because it doesnt seem like you're super frustrated or anything. Just observing. 
---
The only real story I have about loot drama is when I played my lvl 16 paladin as a healer in DM and I had mostly white gear and needed on everything because it was all stuff I could use. Nobody complained and I offered to greed but I still felt like a dick for getting all that then the blue ring.

It‚Äôs you again! Also I think you‚Äôre looking for, *‚ÄùFive curses and spite live in each gnome, this truth can‚Äôt be ignored. The best way to get rid of a gnome is to throw that gnome overboard!‚Äù* 
---
Also how‚Äôs it goin
---
People are completely disregarding new players in a lot of discussions regarding classic. in our group of ten only one of us played during vanilla, one during BC and one during mists, the rest are complete new comers.
---
*spams multishot at start of fight* - Hunter
---
*wondering why all but skull are coming for them* - Also Hunter
---
Obviously.
---
Fumny how it's not being compared to either of them.
---
Did u leave and then reset  the instance?
---
Kidney poke.
---
I knew I would miss the blur somewhere =b oh well not a big deal =b
---
At least the important up addresses are hidden.
---
It shouldn't be against the rules to use /s for non RP chat, is what I said. Do you disagree?
---
The one for 24 items is horrible to complete
---
The drop rate is horrible
---
If everyone has all quests then u gonna spend 2h there
---
Westfall becouse u want staff of westfall :-) I was doing quests in Ashenwale too .. 
---
But on all maps are small to high level quests for me it was the best running from zone to zone ..
---
HOW DARE SOMEONE HAVE A NAME I DONT LIKE ON MY FANTASY SECOND LIFE SERVER
---
Been the opposite for me in STV. Couldn‚Äôt quest because I kept getting ganked by alliance dbags in STV.
---
Darkshore &gt; Loch Modan change my mind
---
I'm level 38, so I don't have much in terms of BiS gear, but we had a warrior drop group and try to wipe us because I (enhancement shaman) said I would roll on the Ravager axe from SM arms, a few pulls before the boss.
---
Yeah, I have that too some times. And that's exactly what happened here, lol.
---
My hunters name is jglymcnutsac and I am accompanied by my faithful companion jglymcbalsac

I don't get anything on desktop but it does show on mobile - although the quality is so bad i cant read the text. It might just be reddit hosting having a hickup - but your post is 1 hr old now. Dunno? Chuck it on img and link if you wanna try to salvage this post i guess.
---
Hahah you were too patient for only having one quest to do! Thanks again!
---
I said RFK is more lvl 28 for a tank, cause yesterday a tank it without a problem.
---
You bastard...
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/609488184728092703/620795150091812874/unknown.png
---
Yeah that's pretty standard for low level bosses, hell even high level dungeon bosses don't really have many mechanics, they just get a bit more punishing.
---
That's bullshit. They could prefer to spend their time making gold other ways then buy it from people selling it.
---
Definitely a case of what works best for the individual. I do think smart stance macros can up your game a bit, though nothing the average player should be too concerned with if they are already good at hitting button A then B.
---
Personally I have every ability that isn't a big CD on semi-complex macros (aka I use things like [stance:1/3]) that call up their appropriate stances first. In this way, every button becomes a stance keybind. I have multiple buttons that take me into Battle Stance because they each followup with whatever ability I needed to be in Battle Stance for. I then use [nomod], [mod:shift], and [mod:ctrl] to make each button able to cast 3 abilities to help save space and reduce complexity (once the initial muscle memory is good).
---
In practice what this means is I have Battle Stance bound to the same button as my Overpower, Charge and anything else that requires only Battle Stance. So if I need to OP, I can just slam OP. If I need to charge i can just slam Charge and the dancing all happens automatically. It's almost like not needing to stance dance at all.
---
There are some funny outliers. For example my Hamstring will check if I'm in Bat/Ber stance first and cast, but if I'm in Def then it puts me into Battle as this is typically my preference when I'm needing to hamstring. On the rare occasion I need to hamstring in Berzerker stance while i'm in Def, I will have to hit one of my Berzerker keybinds (Intercept/WW etc.) as these abilities will first take me into Berzerker stance from Bat/Def.
---
So I have all CDs bound to Shift+#, I have 1-6 bound, then ZCGHRT for the 7-12 slots. This lets me also double up on my buttons by using [mod:shift] or whatever you prefer. So when I hold Shift all of my 7-12 buttons change to something else.
---
I can snap some pictures when I get home and show you what this looks like if anyone's interested. I've found it to be a very strong setup for anyone who hates using a fancy mouse like I do. I can't stand all the extra buttons and texture. I want to be able to grip my mouse roughly without worrying about blowing a CD.
---
For anyone wondering, I use Heroic Strike/Cleave on my Z keybind so its easy to hit since I'm just queuing up and now casting right away. For X I have Disarm/Mocking Blow since they have a longer than avg CD I don't have to go there often. I must confess though, I feel really comfortable dropping my ring or middle finger down onto Z&amp;X off of S&amp;D. Some might taking some getting used to.
---
Oh I had this happen to me last night at 4am before i complete the quests and park my character..with sleepy eyes...with one eye open....
---
Dude was waving back to me while I swimming away. Had a good laugh nevertheless thanks to that fellow rogue lol.
---
39K XP an hour is not bad at all... if there is not a lot of competition in those spots its a good way to get up - though there are the level 50 class quests at ST around 50 as well that would lure me off - i do also need that rep for my enchanting if i remember correctly.
---
Yea, I knew my choice of tailoring/enchanting wasn't the best idea early on. I still made enough from selling bags and some crafted cloth items to get the 40 mount at 41. But now I'm 55 and haven't even gotten back to 100. Need to get to that next level bag soon and see if I can turn that into some profit.
---
wow youtubers and steamers must have some high quality phones then

It's not very accurate for some servers but check out wowpop.appspot.com

Dew it!

You‚Äôll feel so much rewarded when I grind a char to 60 and beat all your friends

Mage aoe grinding or
---
you can see the silence icon on top of the priest
---
guess I'm just an asshole when I (a rogue) follow them hordes while they quest and if they are close to death and barely kill the mob I just hand in a crit ambush and leave
---
You're a slut thats all
---
Perhaps try an RP server.
---
Good guy
---
Yea, saw that post. Pretty nuts, but I guess if you know the game well enough you know all the tricks. I dont mind people getting it so quick, long as they didnt abuse layering.
---
I had a dude the other day try to merge guilds, wouldnt take no for an answer, said i would be able to "Promote my own officers", and that he's "Great to work for". Said we could get realm server Ragnaros if we joined together, I'm playing with friends so i had no interest in merging but I told him I'd mull it over and he starts getting all condescending, saying that I should take the opportunity when it arrives. I told him It'd have to be a group decision woth the rest of the guild or at least let them know since no one was one,  and he absoloutley flipped,  said we'd never get MC done with our attitude, I was the guild leader and I didn't need to ask their permission.  So after that I flat out just said nah and he needed to chill. He starts being a prick saying that we werenr much of a guild anyway woth only 18 members, and 4 being online (we formed 12 hours prior) and that it showed a lack of commitment from the guild that half of them weren't playing. They all have jobs, and I am in between jobs so its easier for me to play at ridiculous hours; it was 4 am... This dude was actually the most rude dude ive ever encountered so far in-game, by far. Every other person has been absoloutely lovely to meet, the community has been great fun so far, so he blew my mind a little lol. Not sure how, presumably adults, get so entitled and toxic. Rest of you peeps have been sick though, it's been a great experience replaying my childhood game. 
---
Hefty read, sorry if some of you actually made it down here. If you see a Tauren about handing out fish and delights grab some extra from me as compensation xD.
---
Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
---
&gt; 9% of my interactions are helpful and nice and often go out of their way to help you finish the quest even though they are done.
---
That's because the game is actually challenging, and we're all on the ride together.
---
And its bullshit to expect someone else to farm your leather.
---
You are no longer getting fresh talents, and you don't have anything "happening" when you level up and shit.
---
You aren't burned out, you're just stuck in that 40-50 slog, until you can start farming for raid gear! Keep going man, you can do it.
---
I will now ! But i juste assumed that Blizzard had a system for chest loot like mob loot ... I'm a fool !
---
Roll a paladin,  you can afford to level your profession then
---
What are those zones?
---
I know a lot of people complained about the little things in WoW, which ultimately led to them getting removed from the game. Things like rogues brewing poisons or using vanishing powders, druids and plantains having relics and holy symbols as material components for spells, shamans needing totems in their bag to activate the totem spells, hunters having to keep pets happy and have ammo for their weapons...stuff like that can be tedious, and to appeal to a wider audience, Blizz killed them. 
---
But those little things are what make the world feel alive. It's what makes it an RPG. And as someone who got into D&amp;D well after playing WoW, it's really great to see those tabletop roots back in the game.
---
They're good for healing, which is more important than being pretty.
---
Why were weather affects and items that light up ever removed?
---
I've been playing since 05 on and off and I'm ashamed to admit it, but I honestly forgot these even existed.
---
No, I play at Graphics Settings 10 with everything set to max.
---
Not only that but I play at 4K resolution too.
---
Alliance and horde helping each other quest...disgusting you should be ashamed
---
Pretty hard yeah !
---
Be nice to just hand in quests and craft on the mobile
---
When I started playing Wow during Cataclysm, I made a blood elf mage. I was level 20 and did not know how to get to the forsaken zones so I tried going through plaguelands. That was one of my best experience in Wow.  The other one being me(blood elf mage) and my friend(forsaken rogue) trying to sneak past Dun Morogh just for fun.
---
Miss those adventures
---
There is so much fun in figuring out stuff. That feels like an adventure.
---
Wow ty so much for this! I haven't been able to play lately and all my friends are way higher than me, so leveling solo has been pretty rough but I can't wait to implement this stuff tomorrow! Very well written!
---
They cost that much in uh.. wrath IIRC.
---
I‚Äôve always viewed them as whimsical when I first saw them in Warcraft 3. So the thought of having a entire race murdered is ‚Äújust an idea‚Äù to them, like galloping in the forest, eat fresh fruits, brushing each other‚Äôs hair, or genocide. 
---
Not to kind of mythological creature you‚Äôd want to meet in real life.

I do that to people who barely escaped death
---
Simple solution. Don't download it, don't play it. Money talks, if no one downloads it they'll drop it hopefully.
---
How do you switch layers
---
Fail?
---
Lol.... engage with reality
---
Just play the fuckin game mate
---
I've noticed that I can actually push 220fps, though I've locked it at 144. But my problem is that my GPU fan gets extremely loud, so unfortunately I have to keep the graphics settings very low.
---
Pretty sure the issue is on your end and not blizzards. Servers have been fine all day.
---
Pls no
---
Guess we found the victim.
---
Disable all addons see if it still does it. Easiest way for you to check
---
do you think they‚Äôll add it in the next expansion?
---
You're right, it's Heartstriker, they opened it together with server transfers.
---
I agree with you that the idea of selling runs leaves a bad taste in my mouth, because these events are supposed to be challenges, right? A person who buys a clear of Deadmines is depriving themselves of the group experience and challenge that most of us agree is a good thing.
---
However them choosing to bypass that experience through other in-game means is ultimately inherent to the game. Your argument against selling runs could be logically extended to someone paying for a mage portal- They are paying money to forgo the large world and slow travelling experience (which many argue is part of the core classic experience). But if the game's mechanics allow for these services to be supplied, then that's ultimately that player's choice and no one else's.

If you wanna search just use Google and add in "classicdb"

I killed them, I killed them all..
---
Dope, didn't know this was possible as I asked my friend if there was any easier methods. Will be skulling every mofo now
---
Others have responded: Nature's Swiftness 3 minute cooldown, makes your next *Nature* spell instant cast. (Heals are nature spells along with wrath)
---
Alternate: Potion - major healing potions can heal for a ton.
---
Also if they are deep resto, could have a HoT on themselves, and consume it with swiftmend, only thought it is would have crit to get that amount of burst healing.
---
Also note shamans have a similar cooldown to Nature's Swiftness, same concept. Allows instant cast heal.
---
And not dumb or unfair, wounding poison is a thing.
---
It flew or was teleported there by the mages of the Kirin Tor for all I know. There was no quest tied to it.

Hoooooooly shit, I had no idea. I knew there was a reason I love killing Gnolls so much...
---
If they can't get WoW to work on a console, they're not going to achieve a mobile port.
---
I need a soloing overleveled mobs tier list here's my guess from observation though:
---
1: Warlock (In mid levels you can do two normal mobs or one elite 5 levels above you in my experience, 6 levels above for a normal mob is the limit without relying on pots and luck. That is with proper chain fearing, void sac, bandage, and healthstone. Resists too many fears in a row and you ded.)
---
2: Hunter (how long can you kite? Forever?)
---
3: Druid (hot yourself, fight in bear, stun, hot yourself, fight, kite, hot urself.)
---
4/5: Paladin / Shaman ? (Not sure who wins.)
---
6: Warrior (when full prot, hamstring then bandage, take a year to kill anything. Least practical, would be 8th or 9th with normal levelling spec.)
---
7: Priest (lot of sustain and can do multiple on level mobs fine, but will run oom trying to out heal too overleveled.)
---
8: Mage (They just flat run oom long before killing a mob too much higher. They can try to slow and wand, but won't have time for mana regen to activate. They can kill like 30 on level mobs at once tho lmao.)
---
9: Rogue (If they cant kill it fast, they will run out of hp first.)
---
This is more effective than bloodrage.
---
Lesson learned. I still find it poorly designed.
---
Server census addons. Horde is straight up easy mode on every pvp server, all but one (Benediction?) are 2:1.

It seems so dumb for people who play on a PvP server complain about being ganked.  The only reason to play on a PvP server is to gank and be ganked.  That's what they signed up for.  It's like going on the teacup ride and complaining that it spun around too much.
---
If you don't want to gank other people, but want the risk of being ganked, you can play flagged on a Normal server.  If you don't want to gank other people, and don't want to be ganked, you can just play on a Normal server.  But this "I want to gank other people but not be ganked myself" whining is pathetic.

---
I‚Äôve got one word to express my pain. 
---
*Resist*
---
With the Wolfshead helm, im starting to keep up on dps with a rogue or mage on single target dps. Sometimes i also happen to get lucky with crits and the burst is insane. But as a cat you dont have good aoe. Still fun to play.
---
For horde, RFC around 12. For alliance, Deadmines at 18.
---
The really good hunters have claw and growl off autocast and bite on auto. A single growl is enough for a pull, because in an ideal world you send your pet to the next target at about 20 % hp, so pre-generate aggro on the new mob. Claw is used on a hotkey if you really need that extra dps.
---
I think unnecessary growls are not just a waste of focus, they even interrupt the autohits of your pet if they overlap
---
You basically started a union for warriors getting their whirlwind axe

can you tell me why barrens chat is such a cesspool for memes and "radical" opinions? trying to have a conversation there has really been a drag for me as someone who hasnt played wow before and is going through their levelling.

First dungeon is called Ragefire Chasm, its in the Cleft in Orgrimmar. 15 should be okay to start.

I spent a little while myself wondering. I went to Darn (my hearth), then IF, then SW. Only after not finding it there did I spend another 15-20 mins web searching to find nothing conclusive, but a few forum posts saying it isnt phase 1. Anyway, I feel your pain!
---
Argent Dawn EU on retail almost never uses /s for OOC talk. It just looks jarring when a speech bubble above someone reads about their day at work. We keep all OOC chat in Zone General channels, guild chat, party chat, whispers... Double brackets to indicate OOC in /s is considered very tacky and the sign of a new roleplayer.
---
Helped two horde warriors kill the elite for WW axe on my NE druid. They helped my group kill it a few times too. Parted ways with no ganks, went back into hillsbrad got ganked by a shaman, then we started a war. Fun times.

As high level u can help ur alts giving them items u found .. playing with friends is super fun (im mostly solo player but not in wow) I can have higher level but Im fishing/cooking/skinning when I am 2lvl higher than friends so we are around same level and can do same content

Hearing those mechanical sounds triggers my PTSD and I have to take a xanax.
---
For sure.
---
But it's not bullshit for someone to pay for said leather or armor set made from it which is what we were talking about.
---
I've been in love with Dun Morogh since my first Dwarf. And it's not the quests so much, it's the snowy landscape and the wandering in the wilderness. Discovering little side valleys that have tiny huts hidden in them. Nothing to do with the main storyline, they're just there for flavour and 99% of players may not even discover them. In the expansions they even take the walking away from you by dropping in people who will give you rides and flight-paths. The game loses something when you take away the wander.
---
Just deep wounds

Imma let you finish but tirisfal has some of the best locations of all time.

You can bypass battle.net by adding -launch in the properties of the WoW link.
---
I mean if 4/5 of the group is bad...its pretty hard to carry the entire team on your back. But its 100% doable.
---
Yes I did.
---
If you don't use it you'll still have to play with people who do. Imagine doing a dungeon with someone who's trying to play on mobile lol
---
Blizzard didnt create it for anyone specifically lmao
---
No, I don't think blizzard designed the healer classes with the hybrid tax in mind but they most likely designed them to be healers first which is why all tier sets are for healing (except for tier 2.5), therefor they lack in viability for all their other specs. I never said druids are bad healers, just the least desired.
---
I believe I have the right one, I guess I'll check again
---
Or get items that just boost all schools
---
A lot of the leveling zones are like that. Some quests at lvl 25-26 and then new quests at level 30.
---
what‚Äôs the gold per hour like for these runs?
---
Agreed, but just ghosting the crafter after they tell them they need the leather is dumb
---
I duoed some quests as rogue with a warrior
---
The warrior acted like pvp bait while I stealthed near him
---
Auto work?
---
First you start with the assumption that racing to 60 will burn you out and grinding the same dungeon will ruin the experience. What if you can do all this in a week for example?
---
Some of us have been playing vanilla wow the past decade and they don't care if you're slow. So why are you trying to make the 60 race look like it's a bad thing. Everyone plays the game they want to. No need to come tell us how bad it's to race to 60.
---
Fyi there's loads of grinding at 60 before you can do this and that. You think the race to 60 is the end? No it's not. One can get to 60 much faster than they can get their raiding gear so that they're accepted in some raids, in general.
---
All in all your post is quite controversial.
---
This addon does the trick:
---
[https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/maxcam](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/maxcam)
---
Also, You tanking dungeons as a pally : hold up I need mana.
---
You can tank dungeons. Just dungeons.
---
Whole wow Web page just popped up in my mind. I remember it got much more stuff about world , races, skills, professions than todays site. Devs didn't treat player as total moron either.
---
Would it be possible for you to add a way to prune the data on the site? I'm sure being able to remove lvl 1 characters or &gt; lvl 10 would give a more relevant/accurate view.
---
Well TIL. I've always wondered how to notice the difference between rare and rare elite
---
Posts like yours are one of the main reasons it is. Its 6am when you posted, i mean what do you expect?
---
you should NEVER be in battle or berzerker stance for longer than absolutely necessary while tanking. battle and zerker stance have a threat modifier of 0.8, so while you're in those stances you generate 20% less threat per point of damage done than everyone else.
---
I wouldn't be against it, just make it cross platform so I can grind while on the bus or something and can do other stuff when I get home :D.
---
Which begs the question... What in the world do I do once I'm able to fly
---
I honestly don't see how a melee character could solo it. Princess hurts... a lot... I don't even know if its possible to do it on a non-dot character. Also seems like it would be very hard and/or inefficient on a character without lifetap.
---
lmao that's bullshit  
---
towns are full of lifeless NPCs that dont do jack shit  
---
even today its the same, real shame for such a rich company
---
&gt; Pretty easy to guess when the cast is coming from most people. 
---
seems pretty implied that you're saying i was worse than most people.
---
I will note, it's very difficult for a novice player, especially a tank or melee dps, to do well in RFC. There are a lot of mobs immune to cc, the tank will have both threat and mitigation issues on multimob pulls, and there are also quite a lot of ranged mobs between the troggs and the shamans, which require a competent tank to pull back. 
---
Really, 13 is much better for wailing caverns (and a late 13, as you want your weapon skill to be maxed for level 13, or ideally, 14. Once the tank has demo shout, it becomes significantly more practical to run RFC as a novice group.
---
It's under Key Bindings -&gt; Target Markers, no need for macros!
---
That's on my todo list.
---
I know that the servers are kinda dead, the main reason I am changing though is that I am currently alliance on Gehennas and would like to start all over on a horde character
---
Warlock here. If I'm full health and empty on mana, I WILL life tap until both are around 50% and then start eating and drinking. Yet every time I touch life tap the healer immediately feels the need to top me up again. Just don't heal me, I'll be fine. I've got bandages, healthstones and drains.
---
Discipline priests have one too
---
/farti worked for me once!
---
How do you max out precision at level 10?
---
Well that just makes me want to level warrior
---
bruh already exalted? U for real
---
Darn bandage spec warriors!
---
You could have avoided this by not cutting out People who never played Vanilla, and just left it as people who complain that it‚Äôs not their kind of MMO. Same point made, no GateKeeping.
---
i heard "Necrosis" Addon have some mechanics you looking for, also a few other good warlock things like soulstone destroying etc.
---
Idk it's always fun for me the first time. Cause it's the first hard dungeon in the game
---
Subsequent runs maybe not so much lol
---
not bugged, blizzard forces you to take the scenic route lol. i‚Äôve complained about this for years
---
mages are the smart kids in warcraft lore
---
They're using the source code...its how it used to be
---
"YOU ADVENTURER! Get some dirt and coyote tails, we're making soup!"

&gt;  wailing caverns

They mean RFC

Well, than gz to your DM run.

Because dodging and a 0.1% chance to do double damage is worth more than not dodging but increasing your damage 0.05%.

Where can I hide there as ally without shadowmeld?
---
I had a kind of funny situation today in Hillsbrad. I'm level 30 and a 40+ something Paladin with a mount rode by me and I assumed he was going for the gank so I charged him but he just rode off. Then he rode back
---
*and patted my head*
---
so I charged him again, hamstrung, kited him around, and spat at him. He took this a bit personally and chased me from the Yeti caves all the way to Tarren Mill, where I baited him into town with Last Stand, Shield Wall, and a potion until he got murked by the guards.

Looking good and being THE hero doesn‚Äôt make a game good. Just look at minecraft, for example. Looks dated and you are just just this guy lost in a huge world full of dangers... Hell, It doesn‚Äôt even have text!!! And still, it is one of the most iconic games in history.
---
WE FUCKING LOVE YOU STEVE!!!
---
( god I‚Äôm having so much fun again in WoW. DON‚ÄôT EVER TAKE IT AWAY FROM US!!!!)

yes, it's definitely more interesting and memorable than all those linear dungeons with one path
---
Retail: something you are supposed to get asap, classic: if you ever get your hands on one you are a god walking amongst mere mortals
---
You can make wowhead into thotbot
---
Well yeah, just say nty. But it's fine to pay crafters who ARE willing to farm for it if youd rather not and have the money.
---
Did Lib with a shitty group, wiped at last mob before the last boss and then the entire dungeon respawned.
---
Pretty sure thats how it was in vanilla though, dungeons had really short respawns.
---
Undead female here want to have a word...
---
Yeah my argument is more to do with key mapping.
---
What is the name of your addon for the party plates? They look amazing
---
One easy thing to mess up is placement of AOE if you had a mage or warlock. Just a little too far over and Blizz/ROF can tap the guys below EASILY. Aside from that, the obvious stay out of line of sight and you‚Äôre A‚Äôo‚Äôgreat. Another trick to tell your friends is that mobs can‚Äôt path onto the elevator by crowd pummeler. They can path up to the elevator and can path up to the upper level WITH crowd pummeler, however they cannot path onto the elevator itself. Great for when you go all out running for your life on a wipe to save your repair bill. Just camp on the elevator until they fuck back off :) bonus is that you‚Äôre by the side entrance too!
---
Got more sentences like that?
---
&gt; As DPS, sometimes the best thing you can do is die.
---
People act like they're playing on Hardcore Permadeath or something. If at the end of a pull only the healer is even just barely alive, it's a successful pull.
---
This is wow... not aita. Stop
---
Wow I haven‚Äôt seen that since 05-06ish
---
100% how it was back then. I remember how punishing it used fo be wiping at the last boss, and then having to reclear to get back
---
It‚Äôs called VC for the boss Van Cleef.   DM is going to be used to mean Dire Maul once that instance comes out
---
I dont necessarily have a problem with someone charging to help complete something difficult in game, but these specific events all lining up created a scenario that I find kind of distasteful. The game just came  out. Everyone needs help. Warriors are desperate for the axe, and this greedy guy is just exploiting that desperation instead of doing the nice thing and helping the community. Those are his future tanks hes bilking gold out of. There are plenty of things he can do to make money. I wish i knew why this bothered me so much, it just seems so shitty to me
---
Why did it have to be snakes?!
---
lmao what? they used dropbox for version control? how on earth...
---
There are no class quests on this phase.
---
Stupid Whiteman not dropping a phat twohand axe! &gt;:( /s
---
Just had to go diving for lockboxes off the coast of darkshore. Can confirm this game can piss you off.  But 30 minutes later me and my buddy had completed it and we were on our way.
---
You need some difficult quests and some weird ones to make them memorable, if every quest is just collect 7 boar asses with a 100% drop rate i spend more time staring at the show on my second monitor. Don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm playing the game.
---
I fininshed all the quests in 1 run.
---
And dont suffer the dual wield hit penalty (19%?), if you‚Äôre dual wielding
---
I assume the terms for the transfer are the same as the paid one on retail, which means you cannot customize/change race/faction, only the name if it's already taken.  
---
The transferred character will be a 1:1 copy of the one you plan to transfer.
---
They were pink on ELVUI like the first week and then they changed them back to blue.
---
It really threw me off for that first week.
---
awesome! :D Yesterday I've turned around an ally which was out of my reach while stealthed. I love that spell.
---
I think it‚Äôs more pertinent because of the Diablo Immortal mobile game and the coming Blizzcon.
---
In fairness, I'm going to be a lot more worried about a random dude coming up and whispering, "Hey, fatass," into my ear rather than a random dude screaming it across a hallway.
---
WC has given me nightmares ever since Vanilla. I waited till level 23 to knock the quests out. Considered skipping it entirely.
---
Got a good group and had no issue. Wont test my luck again though. 2-2.5 hours can quickly become 5
---
oops, my mistake. had wc on the brain. Though I did use RFC at two other places in the post, so hopefully it's a bit obvious by context I don't think you should try to run wailing caverns at 14. Which would be a disaster.
---
Threat plates
---
I've been trying all day.. Some people are talking about a DDOS attack. Or something about a few internet providers are being affected. I don't know i'm just ready to play. Hopefully the shutdown in the morning will fix it.
---
In have no problem with it simply due to the fact that I think people like that sell their services too cheap. 
---
First off, they have already invested so much time in WoW since launch that they are able to provide this service. That is a lot of investment in and of itself which is arguably worth something in game. Secondly, the alternative cost of working extra IRL is quite huge compared to the measly gold that might be earned in WoW.
---
My hourly wage pays for 1 month of game time for example, which is why I will, never farm gold in retail or Classic. I'd rather buy and sell a token.
---
Could it be..all of it? All the correlation?

Running Census Horde side there's 24k+ characters. Not sure what it is Alliance side. I'm in the EU and play on Sulfuras so I'm on during the afternoon. My experience at Nesingwary was to get murdered within 50 paces of it. At prime time it may swing the other way.
---
That‚Äôs the only sentence I know and I‚Äôve known it since wotlk sorry :(
---
Can confirm statements 2 and 4
---
Yes, I see this now. As I wrote in my opening post, it's actually really scary what I (and many other people) thought a game needs to have to be "fun". But that's also the reason I enjoy this game now more with every minute I spend playing it. This is the first MMO since years I don't get tired of after a 5 hour session.
---
Yesterday I was at the Pirates Cove.
---
I kid you not, I was the only alliance in the midst of 20 horde running and jumping about.

In order to not be overrun, I just killed mobs inside the two ships which are moored alongside the pier and to each other by the side.

If you don't set up any rules upfront, you duel with all you have. I wouldn't even react to the flaming, though. Just ignore it

Oh god, that one is especially brutal.

I rez mages when they get greedy with their pulls and then ask for water. Works like a charm

God, I had no idea. That's ..... Son of a bitch.

As a mage the Arcane Nullifiers are the bane of my existance. I hate that dungeon and just avoid it. I'd rather level some more for SM
---
You're in the prime level range for doing some Zul'Farrak runs!  [Check out the dungeon level guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1tkrr/all_dungeons_by_minmax_mob_level_for_best_exp/) posted earlier.
---
If you don't mind tanking you'll have all the groups you could want, and maybe go back to questing at ~50.  Then at ~54 you can start looking at pre-raid stuff.
---
1 more level until new water, hold on.
---
I really dread phase 2
---
Need to hit lvl 60 before that

I use the addon [Track Resources](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25008-TrackResources.html) for saving mining and herb nodes on my map. It also reminds me to activate the tracking ability, if it isn't turned on.

That quest sucks I just discarded and moved on after like 5/30 collected

Worth it
---
Try playing as a new player, it's insane how big it is. Even the map doesn't show the scale because dungeons are fucking MONSTEROUS, was doing Mara and the boys said jump down and suddenly theres a giant croc with 6 legs swimming around
---
Stay ret if you intend to quest all the way, once you filled out the ret tree move into Holy with the rest of the talents. 
---
If you want to grind dungs go Holy at around 50.
---
I'm a rogue so ;\
---
A side effect of it could be that other people are less inclined to help since the warrior 'can just pay for it' instead of relying on others for help. I don't know how to phrase it correctly though.
---
What bag addon is that? I can't find anything that keeps the blizzard style
---
I like to mana tap to equal hp/mana so I can eat/drink to regen faster rather than waiting for a full mana bar to fill up and always get healed even after explaining it to the healer
---
Was a popular place to get into back in the day. There was a lot of unfinished areas you could get in before they removed wall jumping/fearing/ corpse rez glitching
---
Play the game it's meant to be played... "invite for layer", "lfm sm cath spellcleave", "lfm zf ravager warrior".
---
Never saw this back in vanilla.
---
Actually they're humanoids
---
Hello man!
---
Done any gold farming yet as a warlock? How is mara runs holding up compared to private servers? Easily doable or should we roll a hunter alt for farming?
---
Thanks! Will  definitely check that out!
---
Pretty sure they dont
---
Love this!!!
---
DAMN I didn't think vanilla nostalgia could hit me hard again
---
I'm upvoting you because I know a lot of people think that way. But man I could not disagree more, I wouldn't be playing if I didn't read the quest text. Having no context to the things I'm doing would drive me insane, plus I wouldn't know where to go.
---
Oh yes it is. Unquestionable.
---
OMFG... I really hope they don't do cross platform with mobile and pc
---
I bet he has a rogue alt and he claims he gets to do a guaranteed opener too.
---
Same on my feral. Gl catching me. Every hunter tries to chase with cheetah on, quick bonfire and that ain't happpening
---
It's so nice. I don't think I've enjoyed the game this much like this in a very long time. 
---
I know I'll never be able to experience the game the way I did back then. I don't think any of us will be able too. But we can atleast get as close as we can. 
---
Keep up the adventuring! I hope I you continue to enjoy classic! 
---
Happy hunting!
---
Last night I finished lvling my skinning before bed, so I DCed in Un'Goro figuring I'd try snatching a devilsaur or two early in the morning before going to work.
---
Came back at 7AM, I see a 56 ally hunter farming devilsaurs... I kill him, only to get ganked by a 60 mage right afterwards. After a quick /whp 60 I realize almost 10 lvl 60s on Horde side are also busy farming here, I start figuring it's gonna be difficult.
---
I run back to my corpse to try again, find a devilsaur, kill it, and then 2 allies jump me from the shadows and then skin it in front of me...
---
Then the mage kept camping me, I left him there and now I'm at work.
---
tl;dr : probably not going back there without a full party.
---
Am i the asshole for fearing a nelf hunter into a group of mobs in ashenvale? When she clearly didnt want any smoke?
---
I still think wotlk was THE no.1 expansion but for ke MOP is right after it together with early Legion.  Damn jade forest in Mop was amazing.  Ubfortunately i joined very late into expansion when WoD hype started to roll in. Still dont regret that short bit of mop.
---
I've been playing using an xbox controller at night, works great!
---
Why?
---
I used to spend a lot of time getting into areas like this. Funny thing was when I saw the asteroid belt I said ‚Äúthose are obviously just place holders‚Äù. Nope... still the same damn 1d poop stones in retail today... yet they took out the amazing skeleton of Archimonde, hanging off the world tree.
---

Cross faction AH?
---
Yadda yadda yadda, excuse excuse excuse. For killing any person you see in the world? Sure. Red is dead? Sure. Camping escort quest routes and heading in to low level areas specifically to do that? Nope, you're just being a prick and enjoying ruining other players time when they can't do anything about it. 
---
And yeah you can do that. It's in the rules, go for it. I'll *never* tell someone they can't, because the restrictions needed to stop it also ruin world PvP. But the people who do that stuff are pathetic and I'll never think otherwise.
---
In classic that made sense, but once the adventurers started slaying old gods and larger lore characters going back to the grunt style of classic didn't make sense. The natural progression through the expansions made sense if you played through it. The problem is over that time the game became more about the player and less about the world.
---
I assume my dwarf lived in Coldridge Valley, if so, I had to become a mass murderer and kill at least 40 trolls who had families, and kill 50+ beasts by hand... Just to get to the nearest town.
---
You should take the hint.
---
thats what OSRS did
---
The rest were damaged too bad when you were killing them.
---
That's how I think of it anyway
---
It is your cake day!!! Congrats!
---
it worked for OSRS
---
Frankly, ravager is a lot worse than whirlwind while soloing. Worse dps after the strength, worse swing timer, no stamina, largely irrelevant proc. 
---
beyond that, "win ravager" is not a good plan for leveling. Sure, you MIGHT get ravager. But like 50%+ of the people in SM-armory are there BECAUSE they want herod's drops, and ravager is an absolutely iconic and irreplaceable weapon. While it's nice to think "oh, I will get ravager at level 36", I don't think that's super likely.
---
Maybe if you just intend to dungeon grind to cap, sure. you can just say "well, I will run Armory 50 times anyways, I will get ravager". 
---
But overall, this is not a plan. If you really don't want to take the effort for whirlwind axe, fine. I would say in this case, though, that corpsemaker is basically mandatory. And if you are horde, you might need to run a LOT of armory. Like 15+ runs, if you aren't lucky. And you won't know if you were lucky until after you could have had whirlwind axe for like 5 levels.
---
Where's the xp bar?
---
My husband said something similar. We started questing and he started theory crafting. He was like, I don't remember there being this many RPG elements before. I just nodded my head because those are the parts I miss most about current WoW.
---
I always feel bad for harpies, murlocs and things... Like sure, they might attack a few traders and cause some problems here and there but does that really justify us walking in and massacring not just the murloc men but the murloc women and children too?
---
However, little details like the gnoll human skin tents do add a little more, realism to our slaughter... Perhaps they do deserve it.
---
Weird, I didn't find that in leatrix when I looked, only automatic dismount.
---
So you know for sure what the pre raid BiS is for every class? the point is there isn't one set in stone rule and I've found many, many, many different sources that have conflicting ideas of what the list looks like.
---
Yeah, for the most part if something like a dps warrior takes aggro on a mob, it's not the end of the world. I also like mages, hunters and warlocks in my group because of the CC and pet/voidwalker off-tanking can help pick up the slack. If I'm not keeping aggro on most of the enemies, I'm probably not doing my job at that moment.
---
3 hours late :(

What about during the day?

Zandalari/Kul Tirans treat you as scum.

Ah, yes, the Veadcines.

Truly a magnificent intro dungeon.

Just hit lvl 36 when i read this...

This is how to be a true hero ty üëç
---
Anywhere from 28 to 35 g/hour depending on drops - can add a gold or more on to each run with mining or herbalism
---
Just posted in my own thread about this but deleting both the CACHE and GPUCACHE folders solved this problem which was driving me crazy for the past week or so.
---
Did you see him repressing me? You saw it, didn't you?
---
45-50 is always the worst part. Take it slowly. Take a break for a few days. Chill. You will get there eventually.
---
DM&lt;wing&gt; is dire maul
---
You can do that right now! It's called teamviewer and is available for iOS and android too.
---
(I really use it, but for logging in from work and getting into the queue. Or if I actually get in early, just to make a dummy char jump once every 10 minutes or so while on the train)
---
Yes but that goes out the window when we're on the question of whether or not its bugged.
---
And OP is right. It *does* seem fast. We were eye-pulling 15 mobs and still seeing re's on our way out on some clears.
---
They better not. They better not ruin this for us.
---
I used to hate dueling rogues but I learned to just hug them as the fight started.
---
That's what they were talking about?
---
The redesign was more complicated than the old design. Like seriously do you just think ‚Äúmore talent points = more complexity‚Äù? Ain‚Äôt nothing complex about looking up a guide and copying what it says. MoP Talents were a bit more complicated. You had to adapt to content. In some places this talent is better and then in others another one. Some talents are better against this comp in arena, others are better against other comps. These days you have to actually know your class and spec. You need in-depth knowledge to make on the fly decisions.
---
I think you have a very naive way of looking at it. You just saw that a lot of talent points were removed so you think it‚Äôs simplified. It‚Äôs not simplified.
---
Classic was a bit different in that regard because it was so early in the life cycle of the game and in such an early state of the internet that you didn‚Äôt have good guides out. But the internet changed. Way more people in Classic are playing cookie cutter builds than back in the original Vanilla.
---
They were never gone.
---
-Everyone got it?
---
Got it!!
---
-Good, now let's install the game.
---
They're dead, every single one of them.
---
For anyone wondering, you can learn it at level 35 &amp; 200 LW skill.
---
It depends on your layer
---
No. Just as he can use all of his class skills, you can yours.
---
I think it would just be a seperate server tbh
---
Would not do anything with that late respawn timers. We did armory in 12.5 minutes, then reset and do it again. Could easily be done quicker but if you do more than 5 dungeons an hour you get locket out.. So respawns after 30 mins doesnt do anything
---
Like for me... WC is a horrible place I never want to go to again.. so my troll went about helping the barrens in other ways and then move on to ston- hillsbrad.
---
You have so much freedom to craft your own story. It's not just:
---
Go to zone-faceroll quests-finish with dungeon- repeat
---
Did you not want to go to org...?
---
r/mildlypenis
---
So this is the OG aldor and scryers?
---
This is looking much better now and ties in with a lot of the random data I've been seeing with Mograine and Ashbringer being closer to 50:50.  Golemagg is a bit of a surprise though as I've never seen it mentioned in discussions about stronger Alliance servers.
---
It is taking me a lot longer to level my character than back in the day because of this. All of my buddies are racing to 60 (they are at about 25 now), while I just putter my way through the world taking my time. I'm a level 12 and if the fun I have already had is any indication as to how the next 48 levels will go, I wan to savor every moment.
---
Heroic Strike has a great use when dual wielding however as you have a 24% miss chance as DW, Heroic Strike is a special strike however which hit caps at 8%, therefore when dual wielding heroic strike ensures you hit a lot more of your main hand attacks.
---
This is double-edged however as heroic strike generates more threat than damage and is therefore a DPS loss if you're sniffing the tank's arse in threat as you'd be able to output more DPS without the threat boosts of heroic strike.
---
I just mind control all the allys and jump off. This is a horde boat now!
---
This is totally how it was back thrn tho xD
---
The little things in the World of Warcraft!
---
That would fuck up that realm. A mass of players leaving a realm all at once really harms it. I remember a realm I was on that was high population being abandoned once they added free character transfer. You also have to remember the people that would transfer to a new realm to claim scarab lord and shit. I'm sure the free one you don't get to pick but there's still problems once you interfere with a realms natural state
---
I think I've blocked St from memory. I'm used to the modern version which isn't too bad.
---
No decent affliction warlock should even be at 100% health though ... it's our normal mode of operation :)
---
Live to win? Never heard of it
---
No layers, just a hearthstone set at Booty Bay.
---
All blizzard sees is 15 X 4.
---
Hm, that sounds terrible. Rend does so little damage. Thunder clap and demo shout might be a good addition against multiple mobs. But heroic strike is a terrible ability...
---
There are two problems regarding server balance right now:
---
1) The layer you're on determines your experience. If you're on a server with an 80/20 alliance/horde split, but your later has that 20% of the horde and no alliance, you're going to think it's WAY horde favoured. So it doesn't really matter what the server is, just the layer.
---
2) Based on anecdotal evidence, more alliance players than horde players are spamming dungeons to level. I don't know why this might be, but it means that even on a fairly close server (say 55 horde 45 alliance), alliance feel outnumbered in the field because they are.
---
Keep in mind that once phase 3 hits and bgs are released, the underpopulated faction is going to have MUCH faster queues.
---
Retail wow is just a quick autopilot exp grab until you get to the latest expansion. Removing all the stuff they added to make leveling faster make it actually fun again.
---
Everything? Or Everything in the current zone? Because if you really complete everything *cough*(follow a guide)*cough* then you end up in the next zone being 1-2 levels higher than needed even when skipping some of the more annoying quests.
---
Unfortunately it's something players have to find out about. But it is a valid report name category. Enough reports force a name change.
---
PSA: warriors at higher levels, hold onto spirit pieces you get of any armor type and set up an armor swap macro. Swapping to a spirit gear set to regen is as fast or faster than eating and can reduce down time while grinding drastically.
---
Multyboxers pay for sub for each acc so blizz wont ban them . Only time i know when multyboxer was temp banned was when he was ganking gate of sw with lots of shamans .
---
Rage dump. Arms warriors will spam SLAM instead.
---
It's just "Outland."  Common mistake that has been bugging me for a decade.
---
This would be a blast! Hopping some nice dungeon or maybe a raid?
---
Oh no. If only they‚Äôd written it correctly the first time, no one would ever know ü§™
---
Ban you for paying them 75$ a month? What are you crazy?
---
‚ÄúThis is what dreams are made of‚Äù
---
It's DM you uncultured swine!
---
The gap between cheetah and FD is too much
---
&gt;but as a warlock just stop healing us above 30-50%.
---
This!
---
Yeah it should be allowed, simply because a 5-man multiboxer cannot do anything to 5 actual players if they all attack him. The problem is most people run away and the multiboxer gets to pick people off easily...
---
Yes it's too late, it's forbidden to play the game if you haven't been there the first 2 weeks.
---
You will never be able to play WoW again. 
---
Also, it's too late to come back to retail so don't even think about it.
---
Lol what the fuck are you talking about? Dark Age of Camelot, Asheron Call, Ultima Online, Everquest all had gazillions of quests, just to name a few.
---
as long as he pays 5 account he can play 5 accounts.
---
this was allways blizzards stance on this
---
it woun¬¥t go away
---
That‚Äôs a big bad of nope
---
Thanks for this, can't wait till every tank in dungeons is now never using HS and blaming DPS that they don't have threat.
---
Wait until the lvl 40 weapon from war quest :)
---
I got ahead of the pack early on while leveling. So in the worst scenario, I was 2 levels below the highest level that showed up. Later on I sometimes was 10 above the second highest.
---
I kept my hearthstone at Booty Bay and then just made sure to go there all the time when I was online.
---
It's an exaggeration to say it goes out the window. The code is the same. Its just been merged onto a newer engine. So for sure you will have some outliers that have messed up due to the merge (like the dungeon XP in larger groups that they fixed). However it's the exception to the rule not the other way around.
---
9 times out of 10 it's someone claiming something is wrong because their memory remembers it incorrectly, because human memory is no where near perfect. Saying it 'seems' fast doesn't really give any info. Compared to what? Your memory from over a decade ago? Private servers? (which use custom code so shouldn't be compared against for anything).
---
Theres gonna be edge cases where its genuinely a bug but when it's someone just saying 'it feels off' chances are it's not off, their memory is.
---
I remember they removed /follow from BGs at one point. I wonder if they'll do that in classic.
---
Not everyone is an exploiter
---
Hamstring is also fantastic for fishing after WF procs as horde.
---
Meh, rogues should get to open. What do you do, duel them and start spamming AE? Barrier and wait is just more dignified.
---
Well only if you generate more than 15 rage by hit no?
---
have you even seen how much water cost
---
Define nolifing. In my definition of nolifing, you should be 60 if you are above average level.
---
Strangers? Check
---
Baddies to kill? You betcha
---
New best buds? You goddamn right
---
I must picked of up as lvl 32 in camp taurajo
---
Why wouldn't this be allowed? If he puts the effort into controlling 5 characters at once I think hes more than welcome to play. It's quite amazing and doesn't really affect anyone unless he ganks  you but thats only in one occurrance. After that, you probably wont see him again. I think it's awesome and I applaud these multboxers for their passion for this game.
---
He will need a friend or two to carry him through it then. Not many random groups are gonna take a lvl 28 enh shaman into RFK.
---
Remember seeing this in some "top 5 creepy things in wow"-video on Youtube!
---
Another really creepy thing was that pentagram-formation of children in the forest :')
---
I still often swap to sword and board for the rend sunder aa combo if the mob is higher than me even after I have mortal strike. Simply for the fact that if I get bad luck with parry miss dodge I‚Äôm f‚Äôd.
---
Classic forces you to fall into the world. Sure, I just spent 30minutrs walking only to get ganked by a high level mob or this yellow quest turns out to be too hard because the mobs are close together or can heal but now I have a choice find a group of others nearby or haul my ass back for 30mins and go somewhere else. Sure it is frustrating in the moment but that's how the community and world was built because you can better later/next time I'm going to a) come back stronger and complete that damn quest. B) remember if I ever reroll that zone is dangerous.
---
i have spend the talents in rend, so i always open with charge rend.  
---
Rend is a Dot, so its not huge damage, but i always make sure that rend is active on (all) target(s)  
---
But watch some youtube videos.  
---
if they tell you to go arms with Rend talents, this is the opening move.  
---
the rest is still open up for debate, but you want to maintain your rage, for the mobs to follow and not dump all your rage instantly... therefore Execute is most of the times bad, if you go from mob to mob.... you want to go to the next mob, with much as possible rage...
---
As a horde rogue, I'd 100% merc myself out to Ally players who need other Allys killed.
---
That's when some spider webs you...
---
Okay, but after your opener, I get a guaranteed sheep.
---
What screenshot are you talking about ? I'm talking about changing layers to get a respawn.
---
Are you actually telling me that changing layers is not possible ? Because people are still doing it
---
Shadow priests are great... in pvp.
---
Balance druids can be ok in 5mans and pvp.
---
Rogues are monsters that have weak points you have to exploit to defeat.
---
Some specs work better at different things. That is called an identity. Its also a defining feature of vanilla/classic.
---
Classic wow is really good however its definitely not the same, BFA has "corrupted" it so to speak, I remember in 2005 if I was struggling with a enemy and someone else was there theyd help, I've had it multiple times where people will just stand there wait for me to die and take the tag. If I /say anything I'm almost never get a response, I've been in parties where not a single word was said and I was kicked for no reason, I've been kicked from 2 guilds so far before forming my own when I msg the GMs of either I get zero response. 
---
Classic wow is the same....but the people arent anymore and it hurts
---
I have a 30 druid called "Release" on Zandalar. Made the main there to level in peace and so far horde doesn't seem too aggressive. 
---
I wanted to give rp a go but so far have seen 0 rp from other players which was quite surprising (was a little concerned when naming my druid) but since quickly realised  no one gives a toss about rp. Guess join rp guild and minimise interaction with players who obviously have no interest in role playing.
---
As a warrior who just ran his first classic deadmines last night (and always did check on mana before pulling!), warrior rage is really hard in classic.  If a warrior has some carefully stored from the end of the last pull then he wants to use to actually build threat on the next to deal with dps instantly unloading on the next target before or decays in a matter of seconds. 
---
it's the most precious resource in the game.  
---
But really I think it's something people will just need to (re)learn. We'll get there.
---
My current rotation as a 30 Dwarf Warrior with 9 points in arms and 2 in fury
---
Charge&gt;battle cry&gt;rend&gt;demoralising shout&gt;sunder armour until rend needs re-applying &gt; execute
---
I noticed yesterday how far heroic strike had made its way up the cast slots to where I don't even need it anymore
---
Deep wounds is crazy good vs single targets, well worth the investment early on. Plus Arms whilst levelling in PVP zones gives the other faction a scare when they expect you to be in Fury :D
---
Alright I'm happy classic wow has brought back some missing rpg elements that have been long forgotten by blizz, but pretending questing zones haven't improved in their story telling in zones is just a lie. Don't try and pretend the barrens has better story than Suramar. 
---
Classic is amazing and has brought life to sorely missed aspects, but questing/story in those zones is just not one of them
---
I had a similar experience with a guy this evening who told me to hurry the fuck up and finish my quest so he could finish the same quest. Apparently I was being a dick because I kept getting the spawns. Like I control the drop rate or something and can decide when I'm done.
---
Classic wow isn't for everyone.
---
just pugged half the raid in greens with 20 sub-60s
---
Maybe buy better internet fcking cringe king XD
---
The only thing I've ever experienced like that was a hunter running past me and saying "lol Paladino's suck". I then beat his ass in a duel, he flamed me in chat and I reported and ignored him.
---
I built my first computer back in 2004ish in anticipation of WoW dropping.  It's long gone, I dont even have a PC anymore, but classic wow really makes me want to get one again.
---
Don‚Äôt switch server if u ain‚Äôt no pussy

A good reminder to new players, and happy to see you (as a new player) taking some time to read up on and explore your character. You will be a great Hunter, by the sound of it. Keep it up!

I should do that..m

I'm gonna get drunk and high as fuck tonight

Oh shit okay

Tried to do the furbolg quest in northern felwood yesterday. About the same feeling as you had, I counted 14 horde running around there while I was the sole alliance player. I really hope blizzard enforces some faction que before p2 hits or else the faction ratio will just get much worse.
---
No running by the pool
---
Fake post, nobody really talks in dungeons.
---
Dark turbulence bars our way, but the will of the gamer is stronger.
---
See I don't really enjoy aoe grinding so I don't have any points into improved blizzard or cone of cold
---
Lol fck that dude.
---
It is his own Problem if someone is stealing his Mobs.
---
There is no "aoe farm spots" it is only quest area's and they are supposed to be used for questing IMO. Of course he can also AOE Farm there no Problem but he has no right to aoe farm. 
---
You acted totally right by not leaving. You can do your quest and he can then continue to aoe farm. 
---
Nothing you did wrong. Also it is not griefing because he is basically saying that "all those Mobs" are his. And it simply isn't like xD¬¥
---
Must be some stupid child

All of your problems are your fault for healing me in this scenario. I'm trying to get down low enough to bandage and not waste it.

I did the final bit of Bride of the Embalmer the other day with a someone who yelled "Where the heck do you get Eliza?!" minutes before and who finally figured it out. When we killed Eliza (RIP) she got angry because the hermit didn't want to talk to her anymore and kicked me out of the group for saying that we need to head back to Darkshire to hand it in. ALL of that could've been avoided if she'd just read the quests with a reasonable amount of comprehension.

Been getting the same error the past 2 days..

Pennsylvania

There's other databases.
---
FYI incase you don't get it: Guy I credited found a way to play WoW on mobile. Really cool and convenient.
---
The best part about hitting up Gnomer again was definitely handing in all those quests in Ironforge at the end. It's so much better than Stockades too if run purely for boss loot. I used to farm it crazy in vanilla for fused wirings!

[Here's my vanilla WoW review](https://www.slicedgaming.com/reviews/review735.html)
---
U know u can untrain ur pet right?
---
Thought Battlegrounds was confirmed cross realm. So no long ques for the faction that have the majority.
---
If you keep an eye on aggro there is no reason at all why you need to be at 75% ... or even above 30% - even in dungeons. Demon armor and siphon for regen during the fight and then lifetap for mana for your dots and spells. Keep an eye out on aggro and you never have to be high on HP.
---
The only thing that is universally frown upon in a duel is potions ( invulnerability potion / healing potion / free action ... ).
---
Anything else is fair game, though obviously there's no such thing as balance in a 1v1.
---
Was doing Sunken Temple last night with a pug Hunter. He wanted to tame one of the serpent things, and because we let him, he let us roll to name it.
---
Later on in the dungeon he went afk, so his pet became known as BoomBoomTime.
---
You can also try [classicdb.ch](https://classicdb.ch) it's pretty accurate on a lot of things.  I like to compare the two.
---
Because you have a pet. Warlocks have to carry a soul pouch.
---
I feel called out
---
lol this guy imagining 1v1ing a red mob as a warrior and winning  
---
:-D
---
People are going to play the best MMO there is, which is Classic WoW. There's nothing on the marked that would indicate, that this will change anytime soon, or ever. Golden years of gaming are gone, now all is about $.
---
I'm a Warlock, I ran a dungeon with 2 other Warlocks and they were both doing this, life tapping right down to 5% HP after each pull while I just side-eyed them, haha. I life tapped as well but more sparingly and I told the healer not to worry about me. But yes, anyone with a mana bar would be wise to bring water and Warlock spells can be quite mana intensive. I don't know about higher levels but for my BFD run I spent most of the time wanding after casting all my DoTs and I only spammed Shadow Bolt on bosses.
---
&gt; it causes you to generate rage over time while in combat
---
Need confirmation on this.
---
I count about 11 alliance to 14 horde. It's just that the horde nameplates are so much more intense that there seems like many more.
---
Im thinking about lvling my first char to 60, im just afraid that getting into dungeons will be harder than being a mage/rogue.
---
That's a good question. I think, in Classic's case in particular, the stigma around barrens chat going into release was enough to attract those sort of opinions.
---
Whether they're honest or not is another question.
---
How did the stigma come to be? No fucking idea. Someone a little more familiar with vanilla might have your answer.
---
Yep, that's my plan too. I went 5/5 into wands then rest in shadow with spirit tap. +hit talent in shadow tree is very underrated too, specially if you consider you'll inevitably be fighting mobs higher lvl than you sometimes. When I hit 40 I'll respec into shadow and finally be able to drop the boring wand rotation.
---
&gt;an addiction to life tapping
---
It is not just an addiction, it is our way of life (at least when you run affliction which i see most if not all warlocks doing at the moment).
---
Im still using it at 52 because there just simply isnt a better axe
---
Unless There's a way to skip most of the dungeon to rush said boss.
---
It certainly isn‚Äôt too late, I made my first char 2 days ago and got 2 hours played. Wont be 60 for many months, no need to rush it just enyoy the game.
---
I enjoy being outnumbered..you encounter more people to fuck with as a rogue
---
Originally it took me until BC to settle on a class. I'd always get up to about 15 or 20, just be having a mediocre time, and start over. Part of the problem was bordem/feeling stuck - it doesn't take many rerolls for the barrens to feel stale and while it was nice to have IRL friends who were high enough to help with any quest/dungeon, I felt obligated to play in the way they wanted me to. Eventually I felt confident that I at least knew what roles I enjoyed filling and that my playstyle was not very compatible with my friends'. I picked the class that fit that best and rerolled *gasp* as Alliance to really give myself a fresh experience with new places and people. Absolutely loved the class, but was not an ally fan, so rerolled for the final time and ran my poor level one troll all the way to Eversong Woods. Had a blast, found a group of people that I enjoyed playing with, and never felt tempted to start over. 
---
TL:DR Figure out what things you enjoy doing the most, pick the class that fits it best, try a new starting area or even switch sides, don't be afraid to play differently / separately from your friends.
---
When exactly? I've been told from multiple players that alliance wasn't even raiding yet. Also: source? 
---
Not sure if it's because of layering, but I've barely ever seen any 60 alliance players.
---
Indeed
---
it's just walking ability, who cares.
---
I got lots of laughs over the past two weeks telling fellow players how reviewing WoW Classic in 1440p on a curved 32" 1ms 144hz screen with a 27" portrait screen next to it with Thottbot and Wowhead up for guides is a little different to when I reviewed vanilla LOL
---
[Here's my Vanilla WoW revie](https://www.slicedgaming.com/reviews/review735.html)
---
Yes you can
---
I mad ad now
---
I have been having the same issue my dude, as far as i know no one was around me for a few hours and i didnt see a single box or school. I did eventually see a couple of schools when i logged on much later than the first time, but they seemed way lesson common than i remember. 
---
Flamelash EU
---
Better human than orc
---
Nah, I get that.
---
as a fellow druid that maxed out last time around, I can safely say you can play whatever role for the dungeon content with ease, in some brackets, much better than a warrior could, as Bear and Dire bear is like having a full set of mail/plate, where the warrior needs to go grind that gear out.
---
Yes especially the percentages can be off because These People figured them out themselfs. By killing and noting what it dropped. 
---
It is a lot of tedious work and can be off from time to time^^^^
---
Sssssh don‚Äôt break the circlejerk
---
EasyDismount... found in twitch app
---
With the 1903 update for Windows 10, win + shift + S also freezes the screen and allows you to select an area, that selected area is automatically added to the clipboard.
---
That's pretty much what I've always thought.
---
Everyone time a horde killed me in stv I when and killed 5 in hillsbread. F horde
---
Fuck I thought this was /r/wowcirclejerk
---
Problem is still there, you will run out of content, especially those who are levelling non stop. What will you do when in a year you'll have everything? Even if you do everything on all characters, there's still the end point.
---
Yeah, no. I was saying it is very common for most casters to jump strafe around to try to get distance or positioning in a fight. Then they stand still for a second to get a cast off. When you see them stand still, you know that most people are going to start casting very soon. It's a tell, not a judgment
---
Looks realy inconvenient
---
Weakauras string for nameplates dots on multiple targets.
---
Blizzard rank 1 and frost nova rank 1 (save mana and good for rogues)  
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but higher ranks of polymorph last longer don't they?  Maybe not for PvP, been a while since I've played mage.
---
Not a joke....  
---
Just a vending machine :D
---
Pardo ran a guild in EQ called Legacy of Steel, one of the few well known guilds across servers and had multiple world firsts.  Kaplan was in the guild and that's how he started working for Blizz.  They also recruited other EQ raiders to make WoW.
---
They're going to release TBC as it was.  It's the cheapest possible route to keep people involved in the game.
---
Hah, I skipped buying holy fire entirely to save gold.
---
My rotation is: Shield, MB, pain, wand. This is fine for most mobs. If they're higher level I put Shadowguard on for extra damage and Shadow vulnerability procs and throw a mindflay or two in before starting to wand.
---
If I had more cash I might use holyfire too... I see plenty of others doing that.
---
Top notch all around
---
I use snipping tool
---
2 gold reward and gear holy moly
---
Did you have any problems with using steam link while using mobile data or otherwise on a different network?
---
printscreen. ffs
---
I was told the longer lasting polymorph doesnt translate to pvp. Only pve.
---
At level 32 flash heal gives 1.2 hp per mana, while renew gives 1.8. I wonder which levels of flash heal / renew you are using.
---
Starshards is actually pretty neat for lasthitting and getting those Spirit-Tap-Proccs.
---
And when you alternate it with Holy Fire you get a decent DPS-rotation that costs very little mana and even gets you out of the 5-second rule.
---
Yes, that spell is not a game-changer like fear ward. But on the other hand you can use it all the time as it is way less situational.
---
The human-spell is pretty neat in PvP against other casters.
---
i didn't think people care enough about buffs to invite my ret pally without even having to ask, but here we are, clearing all of SM
---
This. Databases are only as good as the data submitted. A radical idea, but you as a player can help make it better.
---
I did a 5 hour, yes 5 hour run of Gnomeregan the other day. Was going great until the 3nd to last then our server was hit with a DC and 2/5 of our party left. Me (the Palatank) and 2 dps (a feral druid and a hunter) soldiered on. We had to find more dps (only an arms warrior was available) and a healer. We eventually found an over leveled priest  so sweet let's go. We started but after finding out I was going to roll on that sweet ass hat from thermaplugg , the priest left literally mid fight so we wiped.
---
Again, looking for a healer, we finally found a paladin. Not a great healer but knew the mechanics of Gnomeregan inside and out. We carved our way to thermaplugg once again, and went for it. Turns out it's a very hard fight with a paladin tank and little ranged dps so we wiped twice. It's now 1am and I have work at 5am so a broken me gave up. The hunter took the helm and carried on. Friended him and found out the next day that they got Thermaplugg on the next go and he freaking helm dropped. Everyone greeded. I hate Gnomeregan
---
Half this sub has turned into bullshit. It's not about enjoying or discussing classic wow anymore, it's just abject screeching about how anything that changed from classic is worse because it wasn't in classic.
---
followed guide, every mob ran away half way through step 2

I jumped down last night and forgot to dismiss, and my pet seemed to glitch down with me. Is that normal?
---
Hi,
---
First, the discord invitation seems expired.
---
Second, I've uploaded my census file from fr@auberdine. It seems that the results displayed on your website is wrong.
---
It display only mages, druids and paladins but I'm 100% sure that my census contains also other classes.
---
Do you need some help to analyse the issue ?
---
P.S. : Keep going, you're website is promising.
---
Go play retail crying about 6hours a lvl you pussy
---
You guys have phones don‚Äôt you?
---
I was gonna say this. Currently rocking 3/3 imp HS, Rend, Charge along with 5/5 crit talents, dual wielding Outlaw Sabre and Wingblade. Spamming charge and Bloodrage I basically never run out of rage, yet I absolutely melt through anything my level or lower faster than any class. It's like I'm wearing heirlooms.
---
This. In the same boat as you my friend.
---
Pet can‚Äôt tank her actually, you outrun her and shot at her :)
---
Sadly this way of doing dungeons seems to work fine at lower levels. Was very surprised that I could tank just fine with a 2hander, chain pulling and healer literally never having to drink unless we pulled a gigantic pack. Ppl seem to not care about marks since they can survive having aggro just fine. Kind of made these dungeons a turnoff for me, hopefully it gets a bit harder around 30+
---
Kind of a dick move towards your guild to play ret though
---
Imagine getting a code red while a horde member is helping an alliance with a quest haha.
---
wat
---
I was testing a different network here actually. The latency is noticable but it's not bad. It's playable. Haven't tested mobile data though.
---
Correct rank 2 poly is 30 secs, its 40 sec on mobs
---
You are not sure, everyone else understands what the number does and why it doesn't matter if you increase it. Better change it back to 64, after all, it's impossible to comprehend the ramifications of changing TTL.
---
Level 1 frostbolt costs 25 mana which you easily regen with mage armor. Especially if you have points in permafrost you can kite+wand indefinitely and you even have 2 get out of jail free cards in nova and blink so mages can solo everything that can be slowed.
---
I did the elite giant near booty bay that way right after getting to STV but it takes forever because I was spamming lvl 1 frostbolts because he would resist all the time.
---
oh my god i need this
---
Nah no ty. Maybe suggest adding it in retail
---
&gt;it's parry coefficient is insanely high.
---
What do you mean by that?
---
Yeah,
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=889](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=889) 
---
This seems more like how it is right now with this mob.
---
if you rolled need for it, you NEED to use it.  
---
Any other thing you doing with it, is just a scumbag move.
---
What's there to compare? WotlK was beginning of the end for WoW. Sure it was wildly popular following the success that was TBC. But it introduced tons of bullshit that absolutely gutted the soul of vanilla/TBC.
---
Heroic narrative where Arthas is around every corner and its up to you to save the day. Group finder. Raid/dungeon difficulty levels. Generic, purely gameplay driven raid content that was created just to fill the gap before the Icecrown (hello argent tournament). Epic gear that started being handed out on every corner. Beginning of homogenization of classes and steady deprication of RPG elements of the game. And tons of lower-scale crap that I just cant remember after all these years. All these changes were made in effort to make the game: 1) casual friendly -&gt; bring more people into the game; 2) reuse more content -&gt; shave off development costs. In other words Activision went full corporate on Blizzard and turned WoW into Disneyland:WarCraft.
---
The only thing that stands even close to Vanilla is TBC. It had it's controversial aspects like flying mounts that effectively killed world PvP, but overall it was a worthy successor of classic experience.
---
TBC also has some of the worst dungeons ever in WoW history.  None of them are memorable whatsoever, they're all stale and boring, and they're grindy as fuck for those stupid Badges that you need to get catchup gear.
---
I could go for reworking the dungeons entirely.  The raids though are great.
---
no idea, i've only done it as a rogue.
---
this was to combat a bug with the straight up cancelform then switch to another form doesn't apply feral melee damage buff. This method it only happens half the time.
---
if another patch fixes it then yeah cancel form would be better I suppose, but right now at least for me it is not.
---
What's your /played?
---
I finished Uldaman with a group full of lvl 42 (only the heal was 41). Worked fine...
---
What about just A personal note type of system that you can share somehow
---
Guild Wars 2 came the closest for me. It didn't have world pvp, but it had WvW - Realm vs realm vs realm siege multiplayer on extremely large maps.
---
Using sunders (not max stacks) allows you to pool rage on the mob while still increasing the damage a bit.
---
Then go pull two mobs and do what you said with SS and cleave.
---
I don't think I used HS much after level 20 and basically never after 30.
---
It's actually not. It's quite easy once you learn the controls.
---
&gt; had zero to do with flat DPS
---
Imagine actually believing this
---
I‚Äôve been searching for days. It‚Äôs truly a damn shame that there isn‚Äôt yet
---
can you make the text a bit smaller, it's to overwhelming.
---
I just hit 47 and decided to swap to demo 31 and the rest on affliction..
---
The reason is because world pvp, I might switch to SM/ruin later but I feel like demo/aff is superior in pvp and decent in lvling with the improved voidwalker talent also not bad in dungeons but probably shit in raids.
---
Pets aren't friends.  They need to earn the right for me to give them a name.
---
Wait I thought VC was diremaul.
---
One word: entitlement.
---
Maybe one more: stupidity.
---
I would have feared some of his mobs into a nearby caster pack.
---
[What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?](https://i.imgur.com/2WYoQVS.jpg)
---
I like FFXIV to a degree but it's not an RPG. Your character is fixed, your play-style is fixed, there's zero option in how you play the game. The only choice you have is cosmetics.
---
Meanwhile I'm level 30 still... Can we please wait a little before we freak out about some future patches?
---
Dont listen to that guy, its the worse rotation ive seen. 
---
Once you get MS/WW you almost never use Rend (Unless you're fighting a rogue)
---
You want to pull 2 mobs each time. 
---
Charge -&gt; wait for rage to SS -&gt; SS -&gt; Berserker Stance -&gt; Berserker Rage -&gt; Whirlwind.
---
If its only one mob you pretty much only have rage for MS/WW. 
---
A tip is to pool alittle rage in between pulls, so that you can Charge -&gt; Instantly pop SS.
---
Do you bring water for the healer that keeps you alive? What kind of moronic logic is that?
---
That's what you get for not buying pummel and going arms.
---
Just finished stalvan and another one who had 10+ parts :D
---
I'm sorry but I don't understand. :/ Is willpower how fast I regenerate mana?
---
I love handing out the buffs water and food, since I havent had the feeling of those mattering in any way for years
---
Oh you're missing a lot. You are missing details of the environment you need to pay attention to. You're missing sense of exploration. You're missing a sensation of wandering and experiencing the immersion as traveler. You're on autopilot. You're going there, because YOU KNOW it's there.
---
Warlock pet can‚Äôt tank her, which is why they use Imp.
---
Hunter pet can tank her. Mend Pet heals more than she can damage. All you need is mana.
---
No they don't you lazy sack
---
If they had added transfers sooner I would have taken it right away as I was stuck in 20k queues. Now however, queues are only at primetime and it's only for about an hour, so the incentive is gone for me. I imagine it's the same for a lot of people
---
Just keep swimming, just keep swimming
---
couldnt find it on gougle either.  
---
Installed the twitch app solely for this add on.
---
On the twitch app its called Easydismount
---
So say we all!
---
Where can I pick that up?
---
SCREEEEEE!
---
Immune to that too
---
You better hope it does anyway.
---
400-600 better then 0.0
---
https://classicdb.ch/  , this one is pretty good.
---
Willpower increase your Mana and Health regeneration if you didn't use a spell in the last 5 Seconds.
---
Willpower will also convert into dmg if you have the right skill out of the holy tree.
---
It can also regenerate while Casting if you skilled the right skills.
---
So yeah Willpower till you regenerate mana fast enough to not run oom mid fight and the Healing+Spell power
---
Hope that helps :)
---
Lol I got a mount bitch where you going
---
In both legion and wod I started late, and I always grinded for flying because it was a goal to reach for, but I also quit both times after getting flying because I had no idea what to do..
---
Zandalar tribe has more alliance in my opinion and it is a rp-pvp server
---
Lol whaat?? The ravagers didnt even cone near to the ww.. and when it start to spin you are basically dead in leveling/wpvp if you cant turn it off in time. Ravager is just a cool meme weapon nothing more.
---
Thanks for your comment. I think i'll stay arms then. I was thinking maybe there is a AoE tanking spec that works better for dungeon grinding if we decided to go that way, but I guess it's almost just as viable to be tanking in DPS spec.
---
That's because it isn't true. Wands use spell damage, not ranged attack power. Agility increases melee and ranged attack power, which is irrelevant to wand users.
---
I was trying to say what you just did
---
As a shaman I just stack spirit. This way I can regen enough mana between fights and can heal in dungeons.
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/ , thia could also work.
---
I bought one in the AH yesterday for 12g. Save yours it will be worth a fortune in some months
---
Well, now you are stuck so good luck getting out.
---
Yeah, pretty much same thing here. I was actually really enjoying it up until then. It was actually a pretty good time, and definitely gave me back the feeling of exploration as I hadn't been there in like 15 years, and even went to some new areas I do believe.. but when the mass groups showed up out of no where it really ruined it for us. We were honestly joking "I don't get what was so bad about this place guess we were all just nubs lul! Oh.. this is why we never went back to this wretched god forsaken place"
---
Yes- move away from that area.  
---
Go to ashenvale and come back to k needles when you are 2 to 4 levels higher to finish the quest
---
Lately I‚Äôve been lying down in front of boats, and telling people ‚ÄúNow step on me and tell me I‚Äôve been bad.‚Äù 80% jump right over me, 15% just walk through not caring. 
---
5% walk over me, back up, and walk over again.
---
No body gives a fuck what you think tbh, just play the game and don't worry about what other people do
---
It's not a waste of money, he still profits what he feels is sufficient.
---
Illigal?
---
rtx ON
---
whatever you want, want more money, go out and grind out every living creature in your level range. You want more levels, grind out every living creature in your level range. You want PvP, grind out every living creature in your level range.
---
I hope this helps you choose a path :)
---
Do you actually want better graphics? I don't feel like WoWs graphics are bad at all and since they are stylized they will last for years to come where as this "realistic" style will look dated in just few years.
---
Interesting. Know the spell power breakpoint? I'm at +254 shadow damage but I didn't even attempt to use the VW.... my problem with him is I can't even put up a corruption and wand without pulling from him... and I don't see adding more spell power as the solution to that problem.. If I could add Rotgrip to my runs that would be fantastic.
---
It's unacceptable
---
I appreciate your work.  Small Q though, how in the fuck do view tank or dps specific loot.
---
It is known.
---
Pretty sure the bosses in ubrs are above level 60.
---
I would put it down to how dissatisfied players are with retail. I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard implements some learnings for the success of Classic - like longer leveling, harder dungeons, reducing the number of systems.
---
Ticklified it is then
---
But the Heroic strike crits are much bigger than the auto attack crits. You kill mobs quicker, take less damage, have less time eating.
---
My rotation is: charge, demo sh, battle sh, blood rage, sunder, sunder, rend, heroic strike. If an auto attack is enough to kill, don't heroic strike.
---
Yeah I mean, if you play the game for months, get to max level, do some raids, get bored, does the game now 'suck' because you just had fun for a few months?
---
Though there is a problem with MMOs for that reason; it's hard to maintain content over long periods.  How do you simultaneously make players feel like they're progressing while keeping them from reaching 'the end' and cancelling their subscription?
---
While classic is a great and fun game, if you never capped out your professions, or got the last piece of gear you need from a dungeon, etc, you'd feel it was treadmilly and pointless (retail).  If you cap out everything, no reason to keep playing (classic private servers after a while, they tend to die off after a while of raid progression).  No MMO has yet to solve this issue, and honestly I don't think there really is one.  Maybe these kinds of games just have lifespans, and classic is only fun again because we've had such a long break.
---
No way that would be 1 to 15 in like 1 quest its probably scales
---
As alliance it was the bridge into The Hinterlands. You never know when someone is waiting to mind controll you off the bridge.
---
Sir, I'm trying to level here! Could you please do the same to this plane?!
---
You are doing God's work.
---
Stop casting, then. You can't reflect projectiles that are in mid-air.
---
I like when classes are unique...but I don‚Äôt like when most of the hybrid classes are just forced into healing instead of dps or tanking. Moreover, the game is going to be realistic until we hit level cap, and then we kill a bunch of legendary bosses again, no?
---
Attunement could be considered a chore for some, and grinding gold or materials for consumables is very much a weekly activity at least.
---
There are good things about classic, but it‚Äôs not all perfect either
---
oh yea, sure. you might just miss that onyxia attunement or those UBRS and Scholo keys. Nothing significant at all.
---
...
---
Lets face it, for a warr to get scary againt healer you meed mortal strike, and even then a 1v1 is not easy for the warrior
---
I mean it is asking people to conform to the server rules. Totally fair in my opinion.
---
&gt; Hunter needs it lol
---
Pretty much my entire experience with WC so far.
---
Hunter even ninja'ed the Int/Spirit healing staff from my priest, stole multiple chests while the party was rolling for them, got upset that we switched to Master Loot, and then rage-quit.
---
 I decided I didn't want to go to Gnomer at all. Noticed there was like 5 quests bundled together in IF so fuck it why not. I was a healer and our tank was a level 33 warrior using a 2H. Went surprisingly well, only wiped once. I passed on the MP5 bracers like an idiot and didn't do the punch card quest so I'm gonna go back today. If it goes half as smooth as last night, I'll be delighted.
---
Bad money and hardly the intended way. Mob grinding is mandatory to an extent but not proportionally equivalent to quests.
---
tier gear blows donkey for mages anyway
---
I quitted WoW after WotLK but damn, I never had that much fun since good old private server times. Returning for classic really is worth it.
---
u missed the 4head part
---
Except this happened plenty in vanillia too, at least for me.
---
I wonder how many times that succeed? If he asked nicely i would properly go to the next camp over but if he asked like that, i would stay.
---
Leatherworking on a next level.
---
I asked my DPS to stop pulling aggro like 10 times yesterday.  When they did stop, I just stopped healing them.  It all worked itself out.  =)
---
Wait what? We rogues can use distract for that?
---
See you all at brd
---
I'm doing that on my server too because of how aggressive alliance players are. One is fine, but as soon as they're two they kill me, so I make sure they go away before that happens.
---
What faction?
---
Not sure if I agree when it comes to services like this. Doing dungeons/raids/PvP and just generally exploring the game is an experience. I've never really understood people paying for boosting through content. 
---
Repetitively killing a mob for in game gold is really just work in disguise though. I think very few people really want to do it, they just crave the gold for other in game purchases.
---
99?
---
Nope lol
---
You complain about a calendar with events, but you‚Äôll turn around and praise classic for having events so....
---
Calendars are usually used to keep track of dates too
---
It'll definitely get harder.  You can't faceroll later dungeons at all.
---
My home is Undercity. I only briefly switched to org when i was doing barrens/1k/deso. I'm mostly questing in EK.
---
Help can some mage make me the chicken fingers? the good kind, not the shitty one George Green conjures

it's not. Linux is not officially supported, therefore it's acceptable. Stop being whiny.
---
This quest can also be done by the Horde, by the way. Makes for a really good RP item, I remember doing the quest with some guildies back in the day :) Additionally, the "Weapon of Choice" quest in Camp Taurajo has a lantern as a reward, which is also quite nice.
---
But i can name myself as homoarttu
---
Remember viewing the tier armor sets in the 3D model viewer on the family computer?
---
You are tanked a deadmines where they master looted the items to their friends.. and then you gone 2 more run with them lol. Next time when you see ms turned on just leave the group because they will ninja everythibg good. Btw agility is good for the warriors too.
---
Reporting nukes my entire chat and often times even crashes my client, and even a week after some reports I've continued to see shitty names like "Faerlinafull" run around uninterrupted. The cards are hugely stacked against people who want to follow the fucking rules and very little is done to enforce them.
---
After extensive research and considerations I decided to play a druid as my main.
---
It now is level 36 and my current spec is 14(Balance)-13(Feral)-0(Restoration).
---
And it really turned out as I expected:
---
Instant travel-form which dispells snares is super good to get quickly where I want and I've avoided several otherwise certain-death situations in PvP and PvE. Being able to avoid deaths was one of my main-priorities.
---
Another live-saver is the ability to stealth. I could do a quest in area that swarmed with horde which I am certain I wouldn't have been able to do without stealth.
---
Ontop of that I get to experience all the different playstyles. I've tanked dungeons, I've healed dungeons and I'm in cat mostly otherwise.
---
I signed up for druid for it's flexibility, it's mobility and it being extremely difficult to kill.
---
And I feel I prettymuch got exactly that. Only thing I have to do for it is having to carry around all those different gear-pieces to swap out for performing best at each role. But that's much easier done than rerolling everytime I wanna do something else.
---
Then there‚Äôs that gyronomocron thing quest I‚Äôm badlands. And the Aimee quest in ungoro
---
Chuck on hots before pulling
---
very tiny brained people love that thing for some reason.  its fucking hideous.
---
healer who complain about this are shit healers.
---
And there‚Äôs so many of these moments! I‚Äôve put so much time into my character already but I still don‚Äôt have a headpiece, necklace, trinkets, or mount. Each of those will be an exciting milestone!
---
Not to mention, filling out my flight paths, professions, and getting shadowform. Leveling absolutely feels like a journey.
---
When nothing remains, everything is equally possible.
---
I don't know what to pick between enchantment shaman and warlock.
---
I know they play different but i like both styles...which one is the most viable in world pvp and end game ?
---

I have a hard time seen how you would ever replace anything using cheap COTS parts, it's designed to be replaced not repaired, just removing the conformal coating would be difficult.
---
Well, barrens chat always was a tryhard version of itself.
---
This! I just got my warri to lvl 24, and i was experimenting a lot while leveling.
---
And i concluded just yesterday that sunder armor helps a shit-ton in PvE. An actual game changer.
---
i get more rage from my attacks. i do more damage. what is also really usefull is thunder clap!
---
Because it slows the mob down which means i get less damage, means less down time between fights.
---
for healing on cd i use bandages instead of food, when i still have some rage pooled.
---
then i use bloodrage, which will put me in combat so i wont start loosing rage. then use the bandage to heal up.
---
by doing so i always have rage to spare to use rend or even a mortal strike sometimes ;)
---
i try to fight mobs at one to three levels below me, and it feels like i blaze through them, with very little downtime.
---
so far i love my warri &lt;3
---
Reputations are more late game. Gelkis rep gives nothing on the otger hand.
---
Rando mages keep giving me conjured food and water, and as someone who often has 1 silver, lemme just say **thank you so much**!
---
Even buying mushrooms costs money, and I keep running into corpses I can't eat to restore HP.
---
It's alright to just say you don't know my guy.

Ping uses ICMP. You aren't gonna learn about an OS from a layer 3 protocol. You can, however, malform an ICMP packet in an attempt to fingerprint the response, the problem there however is your router is the device answering the ping, not the PC. 
---
It was an IPv4 style ban. It killed some headers *nix defaults to. Probably a *nix based botnet (I'm going to wildly guess insecure IoT devices like smart fridges).

How do you turn in mutliple quests at once? are they all at the same NPC or something?
---
Having a blast as retri pala, manage to 1st 2nd dps in dungeons.
---
i disagree i dont think you should be allowed to play the game on 2 accounts at the same time. At that point it just becomes pay to win.
---
A thousand times this. That's the same reason a game like Borderlands (2009) still looks like it could have been released yesterday. The *aesthetics* are amazing, even though the graphics are less advanced by today's standards.  
---
And we can go further back; I mean hell, Baldur's Gate was released more than 20 years ago, and the looks of the game still gives me warm, fuzzy feelings. Super Mario Bros 3 is thirty years old, and still looks great. Aesthetics will *always* outlast graphics.
---
I‚Äôm not sure of the exact numbers, but I remember not being able to do it without a mix of pre-BIS and T1. The threat part is difficult, and was also something I had a problem with. You basically just need VW to last long enough to place full dots, then sac, spam shadowbolt, and hope he dies before you do.
---
I don't care where they release it aslong as its cross platform. Because I have soooooo many skins on ps4 for overwatch and none on the pc..
---
Use the report feature

That's what I've been doing too. It never gets old.

---
Well I did almost skip school today to play, so I guess you have a point üôà
---
I only heal someone who is not the tank when my mana% is higher than their health%.
---
I have a warlock on my own and I know their DoTs are extremely mana-efficient. It's when you start using shadowbolt that it becomes really bad. I only use Lifetap when my HP is full but my mana isn't. But I've seen other WLs to tap themselves all the way down to &lt;10% just so they can spam more of their least mana-efficient spells. :\
---
Ahhh yes the Wailing Caverns are truly an experience. My wailing caverns run, which was fun and which I don't want to do again was slightly less strenous. 
---
I get in as heal shaman, warrior tank, 2 rogues and a mage. We go halfway through the dungeon, then wipe on a harder part even though I warned the tank beforehand. We all walk back but the tank rezzes on the spirit healer. We are like "wtf?" and he says like "Chill it is only 10 minutes and I need to sell" then after 5 more minutes he decides that he got to leave. The mage didn't have time either anymore and whined about the 10 minutes already and also left.
---
He was also group leader and I was throughly annoyed by him because after he said he will leave he continued to say bye for another 3 minutes, while I was constantly telling him to give me lead, so I can invite other people. After he finally left, he gave the rogue lead before leaving and the other rogue already left. 
---
So there we are 2 people and I went "fuck it" "Lfm 3 DD pref. warlock and rogue" relatively quickly we had a group of 2 rogues, a warlock and a hunter. Then we did the rest of the dungeon with that composition. The hunter actually knew where to go and lead us through the dungeon and everything worked fine and dandy. After the last boss only 2 people knew there was another boss. I helped one of the rogues find the quest item he overlooked and then he left and the hunter told me slightly annoyed that there is another boss after the escort.
---
So I quickly found another 2 people for the last boss and we did him as well.
---
Yeah they can. He was killed by a human warrior right outside ratchet once for me. He was doing his warrior quest on Frey island. I made sure he didn‚Äôt finish that quest.
---
Horde warlock felhunter quest is rather painful. Going through the wetland is dangerous by itself but farming that damn rods is a real pain in the ass as the spot is full of alliance and there's not a single horde quest in the whole wetlands so no bud to help you.
---
It was doable with turtle pet in vanilla.
---
If it's in your Kit it's fair game.
---
This is actually a pretty damn good point. That was one of the main points of Kazzak. I think Blizzard made a small error with this one.
---

Content is being rolled out a little at a time, in different phases. Battle grounds will come later, and people want to get top BoE gear for the respective brackets to make highly competitive and border line OP characters (twinks) for level 19/29/39 BGs. Other raids will follow as well, where different types of resistance gear is needed to survive certain encounters, etc.
---
Actually discovered on my realm that Lesser Magic Essence are going for 4s50 and Greater Magic Essensce are going for 13s50 so you can just buy all of the materials and then vendor the Lesser/Greater Magic Wands for a profit as well as the skill up, which is nice.
---
Quest text in Classic is absolutely horrific. There is a reason it got updated in Cataclysm.
---
Won't I lose rage if I change stance?
---
There is this weird thing going on where some people seem to think that they are excempt from RPing on RP-PVP servers, and that they should roll there because the "community is more mature".
---
I would be annoyed that someone would be that unaware watching a mage run into mobs and rounding them up, that they needed to be asked, I mean do people just try to get in other people's lanes as much as possible unless they pay you a request? And no i am not claiming he owns the spot, you know what I mean.
---
This makes leveling a warrior even worse.
---
I only invite specific hunters that I know by now and else try to avoid inviting hunters. Half my hunter experiences were like this.
---
Horde Rogue flair, comment checks out.
---
First i hear about  it, maybe a rollback happend
---
I was told that you would get BfA copy on hitting 60? Was that dude trollin? I played through Legion so only missing BfA and not sure if even worth it
---
Exactly that. Dot them up, then wand. You lose barely any DPS but are much more mana-efficient and way less of a nuisance for the healer.
---
i had a very weird memory from very very long time ago, like 2007ish something maybe.
---
so i was a casual, playing the game in my own way. it turns out i got hacked, and i didn't even know that i got hacked.
---
i got mails from blizzard team that i was hacked and my items are received. the mail included even the worthless trash that i used to have lol
---
i didn't even send a ticket or anything about it
---
why is it in a bubble anyway? i read the books and played the games, but cant remember.
---
Sounds better to have a chance for the axe instead of not having a chance for the axe, what a dumbo.
---
If he really wants it, put together a group where he is the only recipient.
---
MonkeyQuest
---
Haha, I agree. I love that we're basically glorified errand boys in Classic. If I'm not mistaken, I believe that there's a quest on horde side where you have to go around and sift through kodo turds. How's that for epic adventure, hero? :D
---
Yeah, good idea.  I'll probably whitelist a few hunters that I know are good, and stick to those.
---
A guy gave me 1g yesterday for 40 water, sometimes its worth it
---
Maybe the mage was drinking? maybe he skipped a mob or two? maybe he came when they had respawned before the mage picked them up.

Durotar and Barrens are easily the worst zones in the game.
---
Im willing to pay for mage bread each time. They are happy to get some silver or a random green item I have, and Im happy to still save money.
---
Everybody wins
---
Not to say they wouldn't do something different, but they did say they would do BC and Wrath if the demand was there. They never mentioned Cata+ lmao
---
You don't even know what my opinion is if you think I'm pushing it.
---
Most people know how to use their phone's camera. It's pretty straightforward and instinctual to use.
---
On the contrary, I've never even heard of gyazo, nor have most people, so how the hell would they even know to follow Moistraven instructions?
---
If they intended to record it properly, the first step would likely be to google "How to record video on &lt;OS&gt;" and then find a solution. I'm not saying this is difficult, but I fully understand why some people just won't give a shit when taking a video on their phone is so much easier.
---
Again, you don't even know my opinion. I fully agree that using a proper screen recorder would be better.
---
You should try it when a caster is drinking/eating.  Makes them stand up and cancels their eating.
---
kill wholesome people and gank their corpse until they delete game

warlock here, you're not meant to top me after every aderlass

If I'm at 80% mana 50% hp I'm rdy to go and don't expect a heal
---
Up!
---
I really like the idea, like in OSRS. Cross platform. Wish I could log in from my phone while at work and play. Plus it opens it doors for so much hilarious  challange content.
---
Looks like a sook list to me
---
Same! nostalgia intensifys
---
I was randomly partied with a shaman when we spotted a troll mage trying and failing to AOE farm. The shaman actually healed him up. I disagreed with his choice. If a mage wants to monopolize all the mobs in the area they should be able to manage themselves.
---
When the group that I was with finished that quest, I asked if everyone was getting the torch. I was responded with something about getting the one that vendors for the most. Mind you this was on Grobbulus, an RP server. That made me sad.
---
How the fuck did you have 40-50g by level 25?
---
Continue questing till lvl 18 then do either Wailing Caverns(H) or Deadmines(A) depending on faction. Ask to go as a DPS and only hit things you see other people hitting. "DPS &lt;class&gt; LFG for DM"
---
That's what I'd do. You'll pick up all the rest as you play, but nothing beats personal experience. Don't try to learn it all in a guide, but don't suffer asshats either. You can find plenty of nice people to group with. Don't feel bad when you make mistakes. Just do your best not to repeat them. We were all there once.
---
I think grouping up with other players to accomplish tough quests/dungeons and getting strong blue-quality loot was what first drew me to WoW. You see cool things. You accomplish them together. Maybe make some friends. And then you go test out your sweet new weapons to see how much better you are at questing out in the world.
---
Pro tip- don't waste your time on most orange or red quests. You should be able to find suitable yellow or green quests to do at almost any level. If you're current zone is all red/orange then move to the other races' zones of the same level. For every Westfall there is a Loch Modan. For every Barrens there is a Silverpine.
---
If you're into the side-gigs of the game you can start in on your fishing or take up a few professions and start gathering and crafting. Most of what you make will be vendor fodder, but some of it is good to great, especially for people who don't already know where/how to find the best drops. People will nay-say this because its not "efficient" etc. but you don't care about that crap. Nothing beats finally getting the mats farmed up that you needed for that sweet blue chestpiece you can personally make. It will have YOUR name on it. Bonus points if you had to team up with a guildie in order to farm the mats yourselves instead of buying them. That's a rewarding feeling and builds relationships.
---
Which reminds me, you should consider joining a guild that is compatible with you. The game is meant to be enjoyed together! Don't feel bad if you aren't having a good time with your first guilds. Just say, "Thank you but this guild just isn't for me." and then type /gquit to leave and find another. Eventually you'll find a group of likeminded individuals. If you're an older player there are plenty of parents and working professional guilds that are very forgiving and more mature. If you're a 15yo boy you'll probably want something more edgy. Just make sure to follow Wheaton's Law and "don't be a dick" on the internet or you're making it worse for everyone.
---
It's hard to say what parts of the game appeal to you most so you'll have to decide for yourself. Definitely check out the classic.wowhead link another person posted. You can use this website to look up any quest you get stuck on or where to find any item or material you need for crafting. Any question really. Helpful tip is to click on the comments tab for whatever you are looking at. There is usually a green-text post with the most helpful information about whatever you're looking at that will be way more helpful than what the website is spewing out.
---
Cheers. I'm jealous of your WoW-ginity.
---
sounds like you should have picked alliance, traitor.
---
Dont know how its possible to care so much about that.....
---
Shaman doesn't really have any abilities that turn on your autoattack, so unless you macro it to another ability, you have to manually turn it on each time through right clicking the target or having it bound somewhere.
---
Yeah... I was healing and mentioned it when the group started.  He must have forgotten or else didn‚Äôt read what I wrote.  He was a problem the whole run, charging into the packs of mobs and not pulling them back so that when a mob ran almost every time it would pull another pack.
---
Anyway, that‚Äôs wow for you sometimes.
---
I recognize the signs of an aoe mage, they're unmistakable.
---
Aww, okay, kinda sucks having to work around a buff like that. Probably the result of spell-batching.
---
What melee-damage-buff is it? The 31-feral-talent? Don't have that yet, so I didn't notice.

How about using heroic strike with slower weapon one hand?

Sure, but I find it most noticable with hunters. Leaving pets on aggressive in a dungeon, asspulling by backing up to stay in ranged attack etc. And good hunter player can really do some great work, specially in PvP

I thought I needed the master tailor in Theramore. Turns out it's ANOTHER NPC I didn't know about in SW for 150+ tailoring. Georgio is his name, if anybody else is going to do that.
---
every time i'm in/out booty bay i do this
---
On hunters you can see the largest difference in skill in dungeons. Which makes sense. Melee classes just hit stuff. Healers heal and maybe hit a bit. But a good hunter can make the dungeon so fucking easy and a bad hunter can make the experience horrible.
---
Very good story!
---
I disagree with your disagree.
---
Level 30 is a lowbie?
---
Or just take a photo
---
Game wants you to make a choice.
---
Respeccing is the punish mechanic for people changing there path.
---
Its punishing by design
---
It really is something else to say the least.
---
How many times during the previous expansions have you had that lapse to create a new character? Visiting these zones ( especially after cataclysm ) had a different vibe to them. The tools we were given to traverse the world are in later expansions much more complicated and fit to be very casual.
---
Coming back to the original feel of classic without those dreaded Taxi mounts, insta queue situations, hell even the lack of meeting stones, really blew me away.
---
Every step you make is calculated, every hearthstone use, ever silver or gold spent, every flight path attained, really feels like there is an added value to the gameplay. 
---
Finally being able to see the game again through this lens has inspired a lot of people recently and although this isn‚Äôt the first iteration of a classic mode in games ( see Ragnarok Onljne Classic, Runescape etc.. ) I feel like World of Warcraft like the original tweet stated has incorporated a more old school role playing challenge √† le dungeon and dragons. 
---
Ugh, ranting. I love it! I hope you do too!
---
Oh fuck I'm at work dude, don't make me laugh
---
Classic wow does not take much bandwidth at all.

The game was designed for 56k dialup internet
---
You don't ever want to use HS, only if your are full with rage. 
---
HS prevents your next auto hit to _not_ generate rage. I'd rather put another Demo Shout out, use rend (because why not) or even use sunder armor a 6th time (still generates threat)
---
The slam part is wrong. Download weapon swing timer addon ‚Äúwst‚Äù and chain Slam in between autohits.
---
It's a character, big brain
---
This is true. A negative feedback cycle could occur where more people charge because other people charge. 
---
If there is consumer demand the market for whirlwind axe services will increase. It will need innovation or kindness to prevent people from being priced out.
---
Yeah but.. that's Blizzard fault for making fear the way it is. Guilt free murder.
---
What the fuck is this inane drivel?
---
Nothing in Classic is difficult, it's tedious. The 2 are not 1 and the same. 
---
You'd think after having 2 chances to play it you'd people would finally realize that. How could you not after tons of people spammed dungeons to 60 just like they do in Retail? Or maybe it was when people did Ragnaros in quest greens with over half the raid under max level?
---
You know what is actually difficult though? Mythic raiding, high M+, reaching gladiator. Which are obviously things you've never participated in.
---
I use Luna unit frames. It‚Äôs incredibly customizable and has a ton of stuff to tweak, it can be a little overwhelming at first but it‚Äôs worth it

Vanilla hunter is my favourite class design of any mmo. Unfortunately, it gets a lot of bad press due to its capability to fuck up a dungeon, if the player does not understand basic group mechanics or his own class mechanics well enough.
---
If you're a hunter and don't have an autoshot timer - it is time to start googling now. 
---
Also if you're new and find yourself in groups where things keep getting messy and you wipe a lot, look into threat and learn to pace yourself (Don't open up your rotation with your strongest abilities.
---
Key bind your pet controls and put them on passive and start getting used to commanding them manually in every fight.
---
etc. etc. I mean I'm sure people who go and browse r/classicwow as new players would have looked up a basic guide on youtube :D
---
This hero truly deserves admiration.
---
Just because Classic is out doesn't mean you need to live like it's 2004
---
A good analogy, let me enhance it a bit to make it more accurate:
---
Slow down in a fast lane and you'll be alone while everyone else is speeding away from you or honking at you to move your ass.
---
The price of slowing down is that you play alone because most others are too busy rushing ahead. This does not happens in classic because the pace is slower. My experience of Legion and BfA was pretty much this, I took 2 months to hit 110/120 because I read every quest text, explored the zones and took my time. On both occasions I was denied a raid spot because I was behind in gear.
---
No, I'm not asking retail to change, people in a rush can keep it as long as I have Classic.
---
This was posted earlier too ha

You should know that you (and others) can share quests. When you open the quest log and select a quest, there is a "share quest" button at the bottom.
---
You need to be close to others to share them, like if you were physically passing an object.
---
The only constraint is if the quest is part of a chain of quests. In that case it will not be shareable as the others need to be on the same step of the chain.
---
Always work asking to share quests anyway.
---
Alright thanks man, that's good to know. It's really dumb tbh.

What about on Mac?

that was my first thought when i saw this XD

I wish I could down vote this more than once. The WW axe is indeed a waste of time, it's only iconic and meme if you can get it level 30 which requires a lot of time and help. If you get it at 38ish you may aswell just use ravager, hits hard and considering the amount of people who farm SM due to twitch meta of aoe its not hard or takes a lot of time to get. A cancel aura macro can stop the WW if needed. Shoutout to Bonebiter if you're alliance.

A Ton ? there's 6. There might be a little back and forth to do to get them all, but don't be fooled by the [twinstar page](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quests=2.133) : most of these quests are to fetch the real ones at the correct npcs. The only annoying quest is the vial one that you have to go back and forth from kharanos to complete.

there were other people questing/killing gnolls and i didnt notice any aoe spells and that he farms them in that moment, his first whisper was: reported for griefing- if he said something like listen im trying to aoe farm could you please go to other camp i would understand and move...by your logic i should not touch mobs for my quest if i see mage in area

Its legal because blizzard makes money from it because that person has to pay for every single account. Its obviously cheating
---
Yeah and when the newcomers reach max level and figure out there is nothing of worth to do and what content there is to do is brain dead easy let's see how long they last.
---
either he gets it or he doesn‚Äôt, 50/50 zulul
---
Whats in it? Go do quests?
---
And the ones connecting it!
---
You can use inventorian
---
I think grinding enough gold to be carried is far more time consuming than running it regularly.
---
I tried questing in Ashenvale yesterday as Alliance on Razorgore. Never again.
---
No - you may just like your armor to actually look like it fits.
---
Horde hunter to Teldrassil for a strigid screecher
---
Level 17 run from darkshore to barrens as alliance.  People very excited to get into the first real pvp area for the first time and going off the path for any reason is instant death to mobs.
---
Dammm, you think a vpn might solve it? Or is there any way around? Im dying to play it on mobile :(
---
glad we could come to an agreement, mages are the supreme class.
---
Orgrimmar next?
---
Yeah, I get what youre saying. Im like 1/53835th swedish, this must be why I drink water and eat toast.
---
Same here, I‚Äôve been getting them since lvl 30 for SM, I‚Äôm now lvl 47 and I still get them for ZF...
---
Also I saw this yesterday and it left me kinda worried that this would be the new norm..
---
‚ÄúLF 42+ warrior with Ravager for ZF Melee cleave‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm assuming this is because they have a shaman and ravager AoE proc can proc windfury?
---
That's not even a little bit like a union.
---
Do Mauradon, rot grip has a good 2h axe for level 48. Also you can do it during princess runs for pre bis fury warrior Blackstone ring. 2 birds one stone
---
Ooh that's clever
---
Cast blessings and thats all! that crown though! sweet memories. rolled a hunter now to q and chill!
---
clearly you dont either, i usualy think that the people who take photos of their screens are the same people that spam chat with questions like "where is quest x, where does it drop" etc. instead of actually not spending 20 minutes spamming and just looking it up in 30 seconds
---
Didn‚Äôt say they did. Just trying to balance out the massively overwhelming dislike toward streamers in general. Feels like an argument that started from the player base wanting classic and not having it for so long moreso than an actual problem.
---
The word viable does not matter for classic wow, play what you want.
---
A tale as old as time
---
By the way the mechanical mobs take extra damage from nature (lightning) spells.
---
Using a third party software to make your button presses register in 5 different clients is effort now? I guesd there is some effort in setting it up. Controlling the 5 characters after that isnt really different thsn controling just one.
---
You need to go to specific trainers placed randomly all over the world to level professions past 225. Org will only get you that far.

Alot of helpful stuff in here
---
It has +attack power.
---
Can't blame a guy for trying
---
I hit level 39 yesterday (fury) and i agree with OP. But i also wanted to note that hamstring spam is also interessting, since it's the cheapest ability rage wise that causes an extra attack. Although it doesn't do any meaningful damage, it can proc overpower or, if you're fury, flurry. 
---
It helped me sometimes to get the mob from 50% to 20%, where i can execute it. Above 50% sunder armor is the way to go. 
---
Heroic strike is a dump for excess rage while tanking, and i recommend not to upgrade it and save the money, since you'll get the bonus threat at any level.
---
Are you short?
---
Just like the one you'll be eating when the honeymoon phase wears off.
---
It's not gay, if it's in a three-way
---
You mean 5% drop rate
---
lol, the only reason those guys do duels at low lvl is that they'd never get a fair kill later on.
---
Don't take all the retail community as trash though, its just the game mechanics in vanilla sort of weed out that behaviour
---
That hunter comment lol
---
Don't farm sm for Ravager however please farm Rfk for Corpsemaker. Erm what?
---
Alliance can raid and kill boss of both Orgrimmar and Undercity without ever going in front of the bank/auction houses (and hence facing opposition) while TB is a desert. Moreover, ratchet is easy access to all hordes capital at once.   
---
Horde must go trough the most densily populated area at both IF and SW, only have good access to IF BB then SW trough Tram, and Darnassus is the remotest area in the game for horde.    
---
Alliance being so unfairly advantaged for capital raiding and AV created a LOT of salt back in vanilla. Horde bias in the lore would have to wait until Cataclysm... Way after racial were reworked, orc getting nerfed into the ground and humans becaoming busted.      
---
            
---
The reason retail is seeing so much horde imbalance is simply because Blood Elf is better for mythic+.
---
Man this is so beautiful.
---
I mainly havnt done aoe grinding as I have been playing alongside my priest friend and have wanted to stay at the same point as them, maybe I'll talk to them about doing some aoe grinding together.
---
Age obviously isn't indicative of maturity, but I'd wager that a not unsubstantial portion of the playerbase is just... older, now. Hell, I know a lot of the people I've taken the time to chat with are in their mid to late 30s - not that that's really an appropriate sample size. Classic seems to be more heavily weighted with, quite simply put, people who grew up playing vanilla in the first place. 
---
People who have careers, and families now. A lot of whom have probably grown up significantly, and understand the value of just being polite or helpful to people online because they get it. They aren't a teenager anymore without any responsibilities (and a massive lack of social skills), or going wild in their college days without any concern for how others might receive their actions. They know the value of their own free time in their busy lives, and respect other people's time by that virtue alone. 
---
At least, that's what I'd like to think, so I'll continue to do just that.
---

I think modern wow is the same as D&amp;D when you get to higher levels. You got your Vorpal Sword, your Wish spells etc. so the story has to be uber inflated and now you're travelling to the Abyss to fight Demogorgon. While it could be interesting I've always prefered the lower mid-levels, where you have some nice abilities, but you are still a pleb where a band of thugs can still shank you. 
---
In wow, what I really do not like about BfA is that the tone of the game, as well as the aesthetics, have become too flashy. It's about being this demigod being who cleaves enemies left and right and you are fighting world-ending mega monsters on a personal request of the King/Warchief. Each time you cast a spell it's like a fireworks display, warriors leaping great distances and swinging their glowy, sci-fiesque swords around, hunters shooting actual snakes out of their bows. 
---
In Classic, you're just a shmuck, who through effort has become a warrior of their faction. When you go kill something in a raid you do that as part of an army ( well 40 raid) on Orders, you do not fight side by side with your faction leaders, they are these legendary characters you get a glimpse of while visiting the capital, sitting on their thrones. It also gives some meaning to the grinding quests, each zone you enter into you are dealing with the problems of that particular zone and not just kill a few chickens on the way to kill the Big Bad.
---
I for one love it, because it feels like I am exploring the WORLD of Warcraft and am involved and invested in it's affairs.
---
I was hearing roundabout play.

Herod is not as bad as it was day one, 8-hour qs down to an hour q at peak. I got in today at 6 pm, had a 30 min wait. As time goes on Q's get shorter. Ill take an hour wait for a full server vs no wait time on a dead one.

"You're welcome, btw...."

Go from booty bay down towards grom gol :) should all be mithril. Or the red ones. Those mithril?

well, i think its a phone-wide adblock usualy. Like this one  [https://block-this.com/](https://block-this.com/)
---
I see that one all the time on bigglesworth .
---
This is so me, unless it's a Dungeon/Raid where it's all Free! First Portal is also free but any others cost 45s.
---
Gamma so high, I can see Hulk there
---
Gnomer is fun and unique. Once you gain a bit of spacial awareness it's actually quite easy to go through. There's also a secondary entrance you can go through that practically takes you to the final boss
---
Never use execute unless you have SS up and both WW and MS is on cd.
---
If they don't want to get massacred they shouldn't be so stingy dropping their own eyes and scales.
---
Surely not, but I feel he has to live with the consequences of his choice.
---
No no. "We" dont have those bosses in bfa. YOU do.
---
The naming rules are useless anyway. This reminds me of the legendary vanilma rp realm guild "lasergunattackpewpew" or something similar that was forced To name changen into a name that fits an rp ruleset. The guild renamed into "swordattackclangclang" so there you have it folks. The name pomicy meand next To nothing because ppl Who are not going To rp are going To break your immersion with even allowed names and theres nothing you can do about it. Better just grow a thicker skin and ignore other player instead of trying To enforce a ruleset which Will never hold. Not that its bad To try. Kudos for that.
---
Make sure everyone is either all flagged for PvP or nobody is.
---
westfall and pre quests for deadmines dungeon
---
If you are on a pvp realm its not a good idea to go to ashenvale  
---
There are a lot of horde players and in north of ashenvale is a dungeon where everytime is traffic
---
If method wouldn't have time to test content on ptrs they wouldn't be the best guild on retail either
---
Dont fool yourself
---
But if you have an nvidia GPU you probably have shadowplay already. Unless you like manually downloading drivers all the time.
---
are you only searching in OG? try looking for level 5 in Naxxramas tomorrow, you might get same shitty results
---
Toast is not Swedish;)
---
A VPN might help, sure. But if you're planning on playing with mobile data, if you use a VPN it'll most likely be unplayable. VPNs tend to suck at streaming. Especially games.
---
Hah, most old-school players didn't even start playing WoW until it was already an expansion or two deep.
---
* Lev 30+ only groups
---
* Dismiss pets when jumping between levels
---
* Avoid the landmines that the Dark Irons Dwarfs drop
---
Bingo
---
I confused artisan with journeyman when reading the title. Ignore me.
---
TBC fix most of the issues with the hybrid classes. I would love to see those rolled into classic. It made them viable in most aspects of the game.
---
Currently leveling a shammy and can't wait to try out this melee cleave shit.
---
This, when SS grinding you wanna bank rage on 1 mob then nuke 2 with SS and WW
---
That's very fair! I like you!
---
I do the same thing. I use it only for showing available quests to pick up. I disable quest objectives. Seems best of both worlds, in my opinion. I still read the quests, and explore to find where to go. But I don't miss out on finding a quest to begin with, if I just didn't happen to walk by it.
---
An interesting solution! However, I feel that most WoW players prefer vertical progression as opposed to horizontal (such as gw2). This is just a tricky subject, lets worry about it when naxx drops :)
---
Omg, this is dark. I love it!
---
because you pay for 5 accounts and can get 5x everything at the same time, and haveing 2 pocket healers and 2 aoe dps with you that you control and get all the loot for, because you payed for the accounts, that is what is pay to win
---
Isnt there a addon to do this? ;)
---
Funny when they do it when a mage is in group and handing out water.
---
you don't want to be that guy
---
If u cancel the cast, it doesn't stop the 5s rule? Sometimes i start a cast and cancel it but i thought i was resetting my 5s rule when i did

Thanks mate! I will try it. Just rerolled to warrior from priest cuz changed server (cuz of friends) lvl44 priest with mount rip :/
---
Tanks wont have rage for heroic strike until way later.
---
I never played wow before, any version of the game. 
---
When classic came out one of my friends suggested giving it a go with him, and i absolutely cannot stop myself playing now, its such a fantastic MMO and as you say the community is great! Iv seen items that sell for loads people pass on because they dont need them for their character, iv never seen something like this before in a game
---
Wish the warlock in my maraudon party knew that before taking my wand :(
---
Apparently there's a few dongs in the Barrens. I remember every now and again there'd be a late night post on the forums with the latest Barrens wang.
---
They once did a screenshot competition for the Spectral Tiger that the main tank of my old guild on Nagrand won. 
---
That was pretty cool.
---
I like the idea for new midgame content! Classic wow is also a leveling game for most players. Not everyone raids at 60. Many people enjoy seeing the sights and leveling profs
---
The quest to defeat DM's last boss is named The Defias Brotherhood and it can be picked up straight away in Sentinel Hill.
---
That game is so damn good
---
Don't have my char right infront of me.  But iirc the HS nearly doubles the damage that attack does.    
---
Also you get rage from charge, and need tactical mastery to bring over rage (must have imo).   
---
You also say 4-5 stacks of sunder armor.  At higher levels sure, but at the sub lvl 40 ish, that is like 4-5x15 rage. For depending on the target not a whole lot of extra damage for the few swings you do.  
---
Also having to stancedance you can bring only so much rage, and often you want to be in battle stance to apply a hamstring as well.  
---
Tbh while i get this post,  i think it is not that simple without a proper spreadsheet on various armor mobs. The percentages of extra damage HS brings and how much the same use of rage on Sunder armor brings in  extra damage percentage etc.
---
learn to fucking play, simple as
---
The bar at the top is TitanPanel, I have WeaponSwingTimers above my portrait and the rest is just default UI moved around with Bartender - hope that helps!
---
Indeed.
---
Bro, it's so fucked. Look at your voidwalkers character icon... thing looks even more demonic than usual
---
Yeah, nah.
---
Yep
---
It would not make sense to have the fully rebuilt Dalaran hidden under it as during the time of the bubble it was being rebuilt inside.
---
You can use it between pulls while you're running to the next mob to stay in combat and thus save up rage. If you're low on health you can Bloodrage + Bandage.
---
At this point we need a classic wow circlejerk sub
---
Agreed, it still feels somewhat... respectful.
---
My theory is because it takes so long to get out of the barrens and there is a ton of walking as well. So it's people just passing the time saying outlandish shit.
---
IT WORKED! You're a god. Thanks!
---
Should note that the quest is only available for characters lvl 30 +
---
Honestly, I think First Aid is most important for healers than any other role for this exact reason.  Anything you can do to keep Mana Regen up the better. Taking advantage of first aid and downranking heal spells is what separates a good healer from a bad one.
---
In the same boat - looked forward to a more mature community, *basic* immersion, events and only a light RPer if at all, but the amount of OOC names, OOC talking and downright anti-RP sentiments from some sad folk is very sad.
---
A RP-PvP-&gt; PvP transfer to get the queue refugees to where they really want to be would be neat. Til then Im gonna reserve the right to ignore and exclude those folks at every turn, but gonna wait til later to report names because it hurts thst much more when youve had it for X levels and people know you by it more.
---
&gt;Just make sure to follow Wheaton's Law and "don't be a dick" on the internet or you're making it worse for everyone.
---
This so much this!
---
no was they are adding space shit
---
What do you mean 5x everything?
---
They can‚Äôt loot everything 5 times or mine/herb everything 5 times.
---
&gt;I've rolled undead this time around, always loved the look of the fishing hat on undead.
---
No, that's Firemaw.
---
I actually feel like a lot of people forget that they have a reputation to uphold since sharding is not a thing. You're stuck with all these people on the same server, \*act like it.\*
---
I've had the opposite happening my entire Classic experience. I have to ask people in my groups "So...do you need water?"
---
Ah, I didn't play Shaman until TBC with Draenei and that threat mechanic had been moved over to Frost Shock.
---
This, but unironically
---
Gnomer is the better part of 2 hours for a quarter level.  Unless you have tons of quests, total waste of time.
---
SM Cath is the best leveling dungeon, by far...its 15 minutes to clear and is 20%-30% of a level per run.
---
I did it last week as a mage. We were running back from a wipe and at the first jump. I leaped from the exact same spot about half a second after the rest, and got an "Entering Combat" alert. Told my party I was so sorry even though I had no idea what happened, then we all waited for the wave of death to reach us.
---
Same here but smash horde, if we weren't meant to fight we wouldn't be on opposite sides
---
Best is two fast with sharpening stones 35-40
---
Oh I just saw that alliance guild NSFW and thought it was the same one from our realm ^^
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Children\_of\_Goldshire](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Children_of_Goldshire)
---
Classic wow has been so fun! Feels like such a rewarding experience and I'm only lv24!
---
I like your chart, but you can successful tank -4 and even -5. 
---
Key thing is that group waits for aggro because taunts have 40%+ miss chance when you get -5
---
Reputation vendor iirc
---
It was a little frustrating but it felt epic working as a team to overcome hard odds :)

Its w/e honestly, ironforge is close to brm/scholo/strat
---
I just hope this is not just the honeymoon phase and that 5 months from now everyone is still that nice and helpful...
---
90% Retailer with no RPG exp. Will leave frustrated soon.
---
What made you quit rogue? I always preferred the fat melee crits on clothies versus having to take forever to cast a fireball or frostbolt
---
I am not saying they can loot everything 5 times i am saying he is able to level 5 characters at the same time
---
Posts like this which break down skills are so much more valued to me than meme posts, because they actually enable me to further understand the mechanics and get better as a player.
---
Same on Shazzrah (EU).
---
what pet is best for leveling?
---
The quests basically lead you from goldshire, towards redridge, back towards westfall with a stop at hogger.
---
The quest itself is to report to the dude in charge, with the farmer quests along the way.
---
As for the deadmines themselves, I believe that they are just level specific, so being level 19 should be fine and come from the same dude with a few sprinklex throughout the camp.
---
I believe the specific quest chain is the defiles brotherhood were you first kill trappers and work up to knuckle breakers as they are all around the deadmines.
---
There is one quest in stormwind for vanclief however I  believe the chains lead you there with maybe one being in the tram area of IF that is separatly picked up.
---
The tl:dr is go to sentinel hill and talk to dude just outside the tower and inside for quest chains.
---
Reference: have 3 characters grinding in westfall currently.
---
-cheers
---
My mate dinged 60 yesterday. I had a little rant about "The Glowing Shard" quest in the barrens and that I thought I handed it in. He pretty much instantly goes, "I think you have to go to the top of the mountain above the dungeon".
---
Only Classics (even monotonous) quests are memorable.
---
i honestly get mad in retail at bad players for either getting in my way or asking for help ( you dont need help in retail ) . but i help ppl in classic because that dumb mofo just pulled 3 mobs and i know for a fact he cant handle that . you need help in classic I ask for help all the time and it makes a great lil night playing with strangers.
---
Hey I was on nagrand back in the day too!
---
This guy playing tbc while we're playing vanilla
---
Can u do that in the plase now? I thought it added later on?
---
Haha haha lmaoooooo üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüëåüëåüëåüëå
---
To expand on this why to downrank these:
---
Nova = higher rank only increases dmg but costs more mana
---
Cone of cold and frostbolt = slow for cheap (and faster casted bolt)
---
Faster cheaper fireball to dot rogues
---
Cheaper AoE to unstealth
---
Poly cheaper in pvp because its duration is lowered anyway
---
Sometimes flamestrike, cheap space denial bluff and stealth denial, more usefull in BGs, warsong
---
Named mine RaidWipe
---
YOU DAMN NEPHALEMS, GET OFF MY LAWN
---
I was using the Deadmines Blackened Defias set for around 10 levels. Yesterday got the agi pants and they're the first thing that's worth losing the +10 attack 5-piece set bonus. Nice pants indeed.
---
What do you mean by "they"? Metzen isn't vice president anymore so he has no say what happens with the game. He left Blizzard 2 years ago, he just does some voice overs now.
---
He‚Äôs that guy your girlfriend tells you not to worry about
---
Thanks guys, this has answered it perfectly!
---
was this on smolderweb?
---
You are probably right about Seals, yeah.
---
About responsibility: versatility is the goal here! I mean warrior is obviously carrying a tanking set with him, but he's also lightyears better than me in AoE damage, and I'm arguably a better tank in this environment. We can swap then in hard single-target fights like Theradras for example.
---
*Cries in 2 quests as Horde*
---
But then people wouldn't use it nearly as much if they can't do stuff for their main on it.
---
I just get a cat and name it Purrito. Every time.
---
Better to go fury at that level range
---
Dont buy all the skills from class trainer.  
---
Skin all the mobs you kill  
---
Mine everything that is in your path - smelt ore's and sell ( bars are sold for more than ores)  
---
first aid - look at price of cloth and compare them with bandages - sell the hightes. --&gt; watch out  wool cloth sells for more than wool bandage
---
Sell everything you pick up.  
---
Never buy shit from vendors.... ever ((untill you got your mount ofc)  
---
Never buy shit from AH ever.... (untill you got your mount ofc)
---
Do quest, and pick reward items which sells the most. (use vendorPrice addon)  
---
when doing Dungeons, do it 5 times so you have some lucky greens as well and vendor it.  
---
and as finishing touch, i grindend from lvl 35 to 40, in SM Lib / Arms :D
---
And Gnomeregan
---
As a Tauren I usually play pretty peaceful unless im attacked. Ive noticed Night Elves seem to be of the same mentality I think. Humans and especially Gnomes are evil and they got to respond to a wave and greet or Im attacking. If i see you fishing though thats a free pass, we fishing bros.
---
Sweet thanks. Are you sure its from any trainer? Or am I too low lvel or something because i cant seem to find it(using org engineer)
---
Nope. You got it right with mainly sunder, shield block, revenge and demo shout.
---
are u swiping them down or hurricaning or catform or mauling bro? i deleted my char friday and gave away all gold, need to catch up now
---
Youll be fine gold ramp up fast late 30s. Youll have it by 41 latest
---
Nothing in there says unlikely. He says maybe or maybe not. Typical blizzard pr say something very open ended.
---
Well it looks someone uploaded a skewed horde census with 6000 lvl 1 hordes for the Zandalar Tribe server. Data is a bit strange now.
---
Probably a multiboxer
---
Well, our raid is somewhat a glorified pug, we are community of people from different servers. So probably you are right.
---
They're most likely multiboxers... So yeah, they'd be following each other.
---
Wands are still useful for warlocks dude, lets say the mob has 25% hp left and your DoTs and pet are going to kill it before 5 seconds are up - you don't usually use Drain Life at that point because you'll reset the 5 second rule. So you switch to wand. I happens on about 1 in 3 mobs for me.
---
Not telling you you're wrong - just hopefully that eases the pain a bit. The warlock will get use out of that shooter!
---
1. for spellcleave do I apply curse of elements first?
---
2. since we have 16 debufff slots now should I include immolate in my rota (ds lock)
---
I salute ye, good sir.
---
My guild went for BFD run a couple.of days ago. With one lvl 36 warlock and 2 of us who were completely useless. The healer was stoned and kept getting lost, tank couldnt keep aggro from the lock...it was such a disaster but I havent laughed that much in a while
---
Nope - Fire Mage all the way :)
---
I got chat banned :/
---
Great to hear! What did you end up rolling as?
---
"What if I pull this murloc here...... aaand there's 5 of em."
---
At least it has a warlock preraid BIS offhand.
---
I hade the Same issue when using the pet spell emplacement to make him attack, but it worked with /petattack if that can Help... :)
---
Search for classic macros not bfa ones, but you are so specific aboutt he macro that i dont think any1 will be able to help you
---
That‚Äôs not the issue. The issue is the loot disappearing. You can see for a split second what loot the mob/fishing spot gave but it doesn‚Äôt go to my inventory and the mob cannot be looted again.
---
Most people are definitely not doing molten core.
---
where is this?
---
The enchanting recipe aren't actually available as it was the reason i started grinding - the only reputation recipes are the ones for Friendly
---
I suggest arms since you can easily tank in arms and if for some reason you decide to do quests it would be much easier and satisfying in arms
---
I hated what happened to hunters and warlock in retail - warlock being my main up to and including MoP, so i am enjoying myself with these two classes. If i do get bored with classic i wont return to retail until we get to 8.3 but for now there is no danger in that.
---
I wonder about the point of additional chances for overpower though. Spamming any instant ability with the least amount of rage sounds like a sound idea once you have the +50% crit chance for overpower. Not sure about the math behind it though.
---
Yeah call it what you want. 
---
Vendoring gathering reagents for better profit is pretty broken. Even if temporarily.
---
For sure. I think the main issue i've had though was aoe happy dps and that frost rooting dropping aggro. It was crazy. I think half of my SM LIB/GY runs had 2 frost mages, dropping blizzards and frost novas. It's also the reason why I only tanked BFD once (in addition to a lot of enemies having frost novas, which is another issue, if you go up for air, nagas won't follow and will drop threat to attack whoever is below the surface, even if you had all of the threat)
---
Spellpower doesn't affect wand damage, I do think agility does.
---
This thread is overblown, you won‚Äôt notice any difference. Just HS spam dude.
---
It worked well enough in TBC or WotLK where you were still some random hero and a lore NPC aided you.
---
Now *you* are the lore NPC aiding others. 
---
Breaks immersion for me personally
---
Just to address another common problem I'm seeing in dungeons, here's another hunter protip: hunters do far more damage when they have ammo.
---
Yesterday, I tipped a mage 50s for giving me conjured water.
---
lmao, not stressfull at all.
---
Until 40 (maybe 45 even) there is not reason to go tank spec. Lower dungeons will be not really be tanked so just go in there with a 2h. 
---
Later, you could meleecleave most dungeons.  This goes all the way up to zf.
---
Yup. It shouldn't pester healers like it did in future expansions. But when it comes to mages, warlocks, hunters, etc. Then it's extremely easy to buy a new rank of a spell but forget to put it on your bars.
---
yes i have this issue all the time! it's so annoying. everyone i've talked to just says it happens so... idk... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
The annoying thing is that I know ice block doesn't last long enough for people to form a nice neat circle around the mage, and who'd have time to type that before charging in?  
---
Yes, as awesome as the screenshot is, it appears to be staged.
---
Turns out you really CAN hear pictures.
---
Thunderclap is the most dead ability warrior has, there is never a situation where you want to use it. Shit damage, battle stance only so shit threat for tanking, spending 20 rage to get a garbage debuff when you instead could spend it on killing the mobs faster.  
---
Tactical Mastery would *at minimum* give you free rage from charge and then swapping stance, as well as 1 rage per 3 sec from Anger Management.
---
Kali muscle is so fucking dope
---
We'll see in a year. I still think Classic was a mistake.
---
Is this a joke about the Ratchet-Booty boat being bugged to hell?
---
I was playing there last weekend, kept telling my wife "just 30 minutes and I'm done"...
---
That‚Äôs strange. Idk about that then.. that‚Äôs gotta be frustrating.
---
I did a lot of ubrs for shadowcrsft chase as a rogue. It never dropped. When I first see the drop, we were close to AQ opening. Was not worth it at all.
---
You're in it
---
I appreciate your lengthy answer. I may have been a bit hasty and confrontational in my original reply because I assumed you were bashing on it (and I happen to enjoy "kill 30" quests, so go figure). Sorry about that.
---
Shamans would hate this. Rank 1 Earth Shock is a very cheap way to interrupt enemies.
---
Am using, just didn't have them up at that moment
---
It's not salt, it's just realism. If you run AM-armory, you will need to run on average 13 times to get ravager with 2 warriors in the group. You will need to run it 20 times with 3 warriors. 
---
In comparison, if you run RFK with a properly tailored group, you will be very unlucky to not have corpsemaker after 6 runs. You are about average after 3 runs. 
---
You just sound like you suck at math, if you can't tell the difference between 3 and 13.
---
Its more efficient for leveling because yes its the same if you group up with people but the diffrence is that all 5 characters are his to use so its better than grouping with people because all the xp that you're group memebers would have gotten  you get as well just on all you're other characters. allowing you to level 5 characters at once
---
I've played the game since 2005. I know that people intentionally downrank abilities. I just forgot to put an ability on my bar and remembered that this addon existed and ergo it's value.
---
I don't expect heals after tapping, but if the healer is healing me I'll probably just assume they don't have anything better to do and roll with it. As almost everyone has stated - stop healing lifetaps if you don't want to!
---
it's litally 15 days in the game and you make Posts about after Naxx first clear that in the coming 2-3 years and than make your Posts...
---
yea that is crazy
---
Twitter does that to the best of us.
---
Just use the next lower spell for 20 pcs per cast ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
You misspelled Dwarf
---
Damn it‚Äôs a shame. It‚Äôs so horrible when doing fetch quests and I need to get items that have low drop rates. I see the item I needed disappear before my eyes.
---
Just a little more salt (100 mg difference for 2 slices). Less fat, saturated fat
---
So far as a Tauren Warrior, Gnome Mages specifically are the absoloute worst class race combo I see. I'm usually pretty friendly roaming about, may help the odd ally out whenever give em a greet and a hug, but Gnome Mages man, I get attacked on sight regardless. Got to the point were if I see one and my group are near we may as well kill em before they kill us
---
Invincible. 759 attempts. Worth it üëçüèªüòÄ

Dont know it whoosh bit that is kobolds

Swingtimer , enemey castbars and realmobhealth
---
Well, thats not the problem with RP PVP itself. Its cuz of blizzard fokked up  
---
Now they should enforced the naming policy or offer free transfers and specifically say they encourage non-RP players to move
---
I was getting so infuriated the other day killing humanoids in a house because they'd flee and just disapparate right through the wall.
---
This is new for private server players. Private servers don't have variable spawns.
---
I think it was cool to wield the Ashbringer and be called "Highlord". It wasnt immersion breaking to me.
---
Then make it so that the warning says has a button to click that lets you blacklist warnings for low rank abilities that you want to use for mana efficiency.
---
Idk about fishing but that happens a lot while looting. And it is extra annoying when you have 1/12 raptor eyes and loot just disappears .
---
And in those 13 runs, you have acquired, Helm, Shoulders and legs. if they drop twice, two warriors have helm, shoulders legs. It's not my fault you're not efficient. Lets not be insulting on who can or can't do maths. You're missing the entire point that RFK is not as efficient or as lucrative as SM.
---
Understandable reasoning but as others have pointed out and you agreed, youd end up pestering a LOT of players and it would probably be more annoying than helpful.
---
Would maybe be better to have an addon that reminds you individually to update spells on your bars when you learn new ranks?
---
thats a funny name for a pet '' it's just walking ability who cares''
---
They‚Äôre also kind of niche unfortunately. They make amazing flag carriers in WSG, but they kinda suffer from either hybrid tax or maybe unfortunate design issues
---
That's the whole point of this thread. I want to untrain my pet and teach him Screech over Bite or Claw.
---
as a nasty dwarf I always do /lick
---
Nice choise of color. Gj
---
Funny that I decided to not roll priest just because benediction wouldn't be obtainable in phase 1...
---
First thing that made me think this was seeing the graverobbers in Duskwood that's attention to detail.
---
The last sentence is the biggest problem though. It's a dungeon with complexity and difficulty fit for endgame but the loot is mostly disappointing when compared to a place like brd.
---
Yea it‚Äôs horrible. Fetch quests are much more frustrating when the quest items disappears. Hopefully fixed soon.
---
idk how hard it is but have you seen the addons for it i feel like it would not be that hard, i am sure they could not do raids, but it helps them level thats for sure. Idk i have played other mmo's and they have not allowed it, it just seems crazy that they would, but at the end of the day they make more money because of it.
---
Its not an addon, but just a feature in your interface settings, go to interface options --&gt; Raid profiles --&gt; Use Raid-style party frames (in the top right corner) and then u can costumize your raid frames, i use the class colors and power bars settings, if you want them exactly how i have them.
---
have you tried fishing without addons?
---
Enable raid frames for party and check show disspellable buffs. See no reason to have an addon that doesnt allow to refresh renew before its ended.
---
And that macro for a rogue is not usefull as tou will use different rank finishers in different situations
---
I'll take "editing this picture to exclude certain details" for 1000 Alex

I'm playing for the first time and I am a dwarf warrior, I was looking up professions and was going to do mining/smithing. I like the idea of gearing myself up and making armor for others but I am a casual player and the threads I've seen on here say smithing is a bad profession unless you are no lifing. How hard would this be as a casual? should I just bite the bullet and do skinning/mining?
---
Tank pet with taunt on autocast, why?
---
Protip: Get azure cloth and stack as much +sp as possible. Get that int as low as possible and increase your +sp. Mobs die faster and it does not matter if you have to drink after every 2 or 4 mobs, the drinking time would remain the same with low or high mana.
---
I love that people think that literally everyone is going to be in naxx.
---
I rolled hunter and still love grouping up :)
---
You only get a cool hat and parrot from bloodsail rep. And yeah insane title was wrath
---
Would have been on my ignore list almost immediately
---
What seems like a bug?
---
You misspelled Hunter.
---
Honestly WoW classic is all about PVP
---
Its dissapearing because the mob has no loot, but to know that you have to loot it first
---
I get called names all the time for stealing mobs, first to hit it gets the mob and i give 0 fucks as a hunter
---
Condom is not a thing...
---
Its either circle or orange
---
Firelands was great, change my mind.
---
"fewer" is for things you can count and "less" is for things you don't count. For example, you can have 10 dollars, so you could describe that as 10 fewer follars but you can't say you have 10 moneys, so you would say you have less money.
---
But since you can count the number of skeletons, I don't think "fewer" is the correct word and he is being a pedant.
---
Yeh mana shield in wotlk at level 20 fixed that issue so well
---
Ayyy, Ashbringer!
---
I prefer the look and feel of Attack Bar over Swingtimer. 
---
Also have to mention ElvUI. Great UI overhaul mod.
---
Wouldn't it get annoying when you also purposely downrank spells, though?
---
sorry but our festival's horde-only, mmk hun? maybe i can talk thrall into letting dwarves slide, but thats just because theyre the only honorable alliance race
---

---
Pretty sure it's bugged
---
Like I said, if you consider getting to level multiple characters at a same time winning then: yes, it's p2w and it's allowed. And majority of players agree that it doesn't really matter, no one cares if one guy paying close to 100$/month gets more characters.
---
I would like to go back to TBC and Wotlk etc... But it would be great if they made changes like not introducing any modern aspects existing in the retail, i.e. LFG or LFR, cross-realm, transmog etc. The new expansions have great zones which i would like to experience with classic's gameplay and sense of community. 
---
Or another path would be to come up with a different lore.
---
Alliance also have Stockades in Stormwind. Besides that, you are right
---
Both games have many fundamental problems, but games naturally do due to so many different people playing them, and people having their own opinions about how a game should be.
---
How did I miss this, this is brilliant!
---
The "god damn horde", the charge, the whole situation is on point.
---
Hi. Im a priest, level 30 right now. I took starter professions Herb+Skin, cause everyone told me i need gold for 40 lvl mount. I wanted to do Alchemy, but people told i can better switch Skinning for Alchemy after i will have mount money.     
---
But today i reached 225/225 skinning mastery, and leveling it further will cost 5 gold, which is huge and idk do i even need to level it or use Skinning at all... cause some gildmates told "pick alchemy and fuck skinning,you will be fine with gold".     
---
So, the questions:     
---
1) Should i level skinning further than 225,if i will drop it anyway?     
---
2) Should i drop it right now cause (idk) its not very profitable anyway, so better use alchemy now.    
---
3) Is alchemy even good for priest?:D  I couldnt start with Ench+Tailor, cause friend started with it and and also i wanted herbs :( Herbs are cute, you know?     
---
Thx alot for any help.
---
Well, negro is a word for black color in many languages.
---
idk why but I suddenly respect the gnolls more. Let no part of the animal go to waste and all.I wonder if they would shed a single tear if I threw an empty nightfin soup bowl on the ground in agro radius.
---
It requires level 30 to do.
---

---
That doesn't exist in classic/vanilla. Neither API nor tricks work. What you can do however is spam a targeting macro:
---
/cleartarget
---
/target &lt;Name of Mob&gt;
---
/say "Found it!"
---
/cast &lt;some insta spell&gt; \[exists,nodead\]
---
Was looking for this. Stonetalon is the worst walk you can do on Alliance.
---
It has been 14 years or so since I did this - the only thing I do remember is that there are just a handful of mobs who are even able to drop the dragonling. Other than that, just kill them.
---
If you are Alliance just get Bonebiter instead.
---
That spirit staff that has the spinning circle lights up quite nicely :D
---
I tried to do this, but I couldn't figure out how to add the right layout options.   
---
His instructions were:  Open the options on your phone by using the button in my top left corner on the video and choose layout options. Drag the WASD joy stick on the screen to make it static.   
---
Could you simplify this for me by any chance?
---
A guy did that to me too, then I realised he did it so I would regen HP faster. What a legend
---
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!!!!
---
Don't you guys have phones!?
---
Well yeah Un'Thuwa, where's your fucking mana?
---
Mine killed my questgiver but didn‚Äôt kill me so he was a merciful gnome god
---
I always /lick before i kill low level allys. 
---
Thats just how it works.
---
On a private server I was in a group for that world boss and after for a couple of hours just before the pull the leader, a hunter, said that he was going to take the sinew which I, also a hunter, didn't like, so I ruined their pull twice over a span of 1 hour and everyone in the raid quit. I got a fuck of hate messages for that but it was worth it. Fuck the ninjalooters.
---
They must decide between Human Leatherworker or Orc Leatherworker :)
---
At 29 with 2500 mana it regenerates 1500 mana over 30sec.
---
25 water regenerates 1344 mana over 27sec, which also would be almost 1500 at 30sec.
---
As a mage, you still use level 15 water at 29 which is only 835 mana over 24sec, i guess this is the price i have to pay for free water :/

It's 10% damage mitigation.  It's not a dead ability at all, it's just not offensive.

Gave up the ability to Tank and DPS.

Oh nice. This is how it started for me too. Now, I am already locked out for 2 days from classic and retail.

I think the problem is that Bears don't really have anything better to do with their rage - i.e., no awesome whirlwind ability :(
---
If you are fighting 2 mobs at the same time, then the case can be made that swipe actually deals more damage per rage, but the damage is still pretty paltry. It's fun though!
---
Ouch.
---
Make the warnings appear in a frame and add a button to blacklist warning about using that ability at that rank. E.g. a mage clicks blacklist on rank 1 frostbolt but for ranks 2-n they still get warnings about higher ranks being available.
---
Me trying to tank: 1st sunder misses, 2nd sunder misses,  disarmed.
---
I was doing this last night to horde in stonetalon. Ashbringer server ?
---
How can someone not know how to play a class? Most "rotations" are just pressing one button repeatedly. It's not retail where you can actually have people doing half of their intended damage because they're messing up their rotations.
---
Could be worse. You could be looking for that last elusive unlilled boss and three more serpentbloom in the tangled web of wailing caverns while your tank appears to be afk and your healer keeps asking for bio breaks every 10 minutes.
---
That would require the user to understand every class' abilities and gameplay to fully utilize this feature. Be honest, most wouldn't even try.
---
Did you not ever see someone having 2 eating buffs? Or do you not check people or their buffs?
---
Do you two live together ? Are you both working full time jobs? 
---
When I get home from work I only have a couple of hours free, my wife would obviously like it if we spent them together and so would I. Combine this with a ton of other responsibilities and other hobbies/socializing with friends and you simply dont have time for a couple of evenings to do this.
---
Ps. I doubt that most peoples SOs literally dont allow them to play, they probably hint that they should do something with them. I might be wrong though.
---
The lake in the middle of it gets me all fuzzy.

Such a great spot to throw a hook or two and chill.

My favorite city in the game, shame i always play alliance, might convert to a cow.

Pretty much this.  1-60 first time around was one of the best experiences I ever even after 15 years.  Mostly because I knew absolutely nothing.  The problem with guides is it kind of sterilizes the content and you don't have quite the same sense of exploration and random aww shit moments.

Back in 2007 I swam from Menthil Harbor thinking stormwind had a port due to it's location on the map only to end up having to swim to Westfall.

What does open-play have to do with anything? An RPG is a role-playing game, which is generally considered acting out the role of a character through a process of structured decision-making regarding their development.
---
In XIV, there is no decision-making regarding your character's development. You no longer have a choice in cross-job abilities. You have no choice in how you fight using any given job -- there is one way to play a job, and one way only.
---
You have no agency in the story, other than the binary choice of proceeding or not, which I don't think counts.
---
Don't get me wrong: I absolutely love some of the stories in XIV, particularly Heavensward. It's amazing. But it's a poor RPG.
---
I love that hell hole! As a Hordie running that place is a pain with only one quest, but I love that it was almost a city, but when that didn't work out, they just said, "Fuck it! Let's make it a dungeon!"
---
Overpower?  Disarm?  Charge?  You absolutely need to change stances as fury.  Not as much as other specs maybe.
---
"Don't judge me at 60 for what I did to you while leveling" is how I feel.
---
Blue BOE. All need. No problems here
---
don‚Äôt get me started on flight path and zone outposts. It seems horde has bigger better outposts everywhere. especially around level 30. God I never realized how good we had it as horde.
---
Spent a week farming crusader enchantment
---
eh what? I would argue very few people actually play the game like they did back in the day. 
---
Dungeon AOE grinding was a thing very few people did back in the day, if any. 
---
Today it's all people are doing. It's impossible to find a normal dungeon run because it's all farm grps who only kill the first boss or two.
---
Correct. It's a Horde controlled territory... Be careful to not throw buffs on PvP activated people though, cause it activates your PvP too
---
Nope Felstriker, as a hunter though I‚Äôm gonna start leaving freezing traps around now

---
For me 29 - 32 was the worst part so far, and I also didn't do dungeons around that level (which would have helped).   
---
It seems like this level span (if you're not experienced in classic leveling) has a lot of different zones and quest in it. I was all over the place, and even entered Shimmering Flats a bit too low, so it took me a while.   
---
From 32 - 42 I've had a much better experience, and I still have 2nd part of Swamp of Sorrows, 3rd part of STV and Tanaris waiting for me, so it looks quite bright up to 45-46 at least.   
---
I support your grinding approach as well, I've done this in the past if it seems like you're in a quest-limbo. Just put on a netflix show or a Podcast, and find a nice area on the outskirts with high mob density!   
---
Best of luck!
---
My first instinct was an orc rug, ty for the explenation.
---
Tanking and threat management is way more hands on though. We also don't all have super fancy retail moves, like every can AoE, everyone can jump/sprint/gtfo of danger. The gameplay is simpler. But you also have way less tools, and thus more challenges. Try tanking 8 mobs at once in classic, compare to bfa. One is a nightmare challenge, the other AoE spam. Hard to argue the latter is somehow more challenging.
---
I mean, you literally don't want to train the rankups in a lot of skills because the damage is negligible. For example, Rend past rank 3 is pointless. Cleave and OP aren't worth training past rank 1 (maybe 2) because its literally like 5-10 damage increase. You should be saving money for your mount or whatever else instead.
---
WHAT A HORRIBLE NIGHT TO HAVE A CURSE.
---
Maybe sometimes. But consider some other scenarios. What if this character is an alt of a very rich main?
---
What if this person wants to ensure they get every drop without needing to roll? What if they play off peak and are having trouble making a full group?
---
There are some cases where a bought run can be quite appealing, or might even be the most logical option
---
Yes, and the queues to kill Chok'Sul inside the goddamn cave. With his 10 minutes or something spawn rate.
---
And the grind for the Ogre crystal for the dwarves at the dam.

Loch Modan is beautiful, but the quests are definitely not among my favourites.

Neither are rpg.

---
How do I get there? I was told from the wetlands but isn't that a higher level area?
---
&gt; (healing, mostly, can't remember if buffing counts).
---
Buffing does count
---
Westfall should be perfect for you at lvl 15. You can also move towards Redridge Mountains. I believe the lvl ranges from 15-25 and start questing there.. or another option could be going to darkshore :-)
---
Won't that just spam 'Found it!' in chat every time you press it?
---
Yeah, it's deliver the [Sealed Letter to Ag'tor] to "Ag'tor Bloodfist."
---
It shows the loot in the windows for a split second. Before it disappears.
---
It's ok not to heal between pulls. As a lock you never want to see your health bar full if your mana is not. You regen faster when regening both resources. And you can drink and eat at the same time. Just keep the tank and yourself up.
---
I tried something like that and it didn‚Äôt seem to work. I read somewhere that vanilla didn‚Äôt have the /startattack command
---
Sorry if this seems obvious but have you tried to loot without auto loot? If it works that way then you know for sure it‚Äôs an auto loot issue, if it still does it with out auto loot then it could be something different entirely.
---
So pretty much how Horde PVP on every server then
---
Wait I saw this name on Gandling EU and thought it was the best name I'd seen by far, it really got removed?
---
implying thats not everyone's favourite opeth album lmao
---
Just heal the lock when he gets aggro. Otherwise you're just ruining the life tap. It's what we do.. Taps, bolts and dots.
---
I mean, classic does have its share of 10-quest chains too, even early on...
---
The world feels alive again and it just feels good.
---
I keep seeing the same players around the world and in dungeon/raid groups. I joined a random MC PUG though the LookingForGroup chat channel a couple of days ago and there were around ten players that I had grouped up with since launch.
---
I grinded for [greater nature protection potion recipes](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=13496) for a week and sold them when they were extremely useful for Huhuran kills. Think I could basically pull half the cave (that was rarely ever contested) and it was still a long, long process. Think I ended up with 3 and sold them for 150g each.
---
Dude is cooler than icon you have choosen
---
Listen. I lifetap away allll my fucking Life yes... So i start eating and/or lifeleach my way back to full health in the pull...thats what i do while questing all the time. Dont worry to much about warlocks, we're Not that easy to kill.
---
You only need to Watch Out when im going to hellfire the Shit out of These mobs

Name criticism by "'HarryDotta'

The guy who saw HarryDotter was taken and STILL thought that the name was worth going for.

what server was this one? I might have had the exact same dude be pissed at me
---
Yeah, i would love to do that! I would if i could, i promise! But certain plate-wearing maniacs wont give me the time i need to actualy get something out of those exepensive drinks. Ever seen a Warrior stand still for more than 10 seconds? Me neither.  
---
I blame streamers, and you should too. We're all victims here.
---
And that's a problem. Canonically you don't match your actual game position. You defeated all those enemies with 25-40 other people. Statistically chances are you weren't even the most valuable member of your class when killing those enemies. The game tries to make you the most important person, along with everybody else. That works in a game like elder scrolls where you are the most powerful and important. It doesn't work in an MMO with thousands of other people who are all also the most powerful and important. It forces the writers to fence in the player and turn it into a curated story instead of writing a story for you to participate in how you want.
---
There are many flaws with classic and desolace is one of them. One of the areas where retail is better.
---
To get cooking 150+ you need to buy a cookbook. Alliance get theirs in ashenvale. Horde in south west desolace. You are usually around 25 when you reach 150. Desolace is 30-40. And you have to cross the entire zone. 
---
Oh, and the droprate of goblin related quests seems like a bad joke.
---
Yea I‚Äôve been playing without auto loot for the last couple days because I was tired of seeing my loot disappear. It hasn‚Äôt happened with auto loot disable yet so I‚Äôm pretty confident it‚Äôs an auto loot issue.
---
Honestly i never really saw the appeal of Thunder Bluff. The aesthetic is nice, when you approach it but when you are in the city itself it just feels weird to me. The multi-layering is awkward, paths to the different rises are not that intuitive... On the same note: I also dislike UC for the same reason. Too much stuff on too many levels and the pathing feels weird, everything looks the same...
---
OG on the other hand. OG is love, OG is life. The districts each feel very different from each other, the pathing feels natural... I love it. :)
---
Spoiler alert.
---
But you can simply follow the mushrooms.
---
One thing you're missing is that white attacks have a higher chance of missing than abilities so maybe this has something to say?
---
Well, there's still Blackwater Park and Still Life.
---
225 skinning let's you skin up to like level 42 or 47 mobs so, if you're just doing it to get your mount I wouldn't spend the 5g
---
I did loch modan and it sure as hell was a hurdle. But after that I could take on westfall, redridge, duskwood etc.
---
This app would definitely be useful I know at one point I definitely use the wrong rank frostbolt for probably two levels and had a good laughing moment when I realized I had another running frostbolt in my book and could have been doing another 75 damage
---
Like my hunter in TBC. I used one single macro for DPS that just did everything. If X was on cooldown, do that, if that also is on cooldown to this or else just steady shot.
---
I button pressing hunter did well.
---
Westfall is perfect for 15-17 then head to Redridge at about 18-21.
---
Ugh that's so typical swedes, big reason i don't play with my countrymen. Just add them all to your ignore list. What server was this on btw?
---
Most guides say go Fury. A long time tank friend of mine tells me every Warrior spec is fine if you just go sword and board when you enter the 5 man dungeons.
---
That‚Äôs so odd then, just submit a ticket and wait then, might take a while but that‚Äôs almost game breaking honestly, Ill see if I have the same issue later tonight.
---
Now if somebody could figure out how to apply this design to the YouTube comment section...!
---
I'm role playing chaotic good, and breaking the rules.
---
I don't think it should be allowed but it is so that's how it goes
---
Well perfect example would be SM or RFD
---
TIL Mentioning quest chains with rewads *once* means I'm hyper focused and autistic...
---
I have been saying this for years and people scoff.  Vanilla was made by D&amp;D players. 
---
Modern wow was made by elitist jerks players. 
---
The difference is fun.
---
woah...
---
PvP server doesn't mean everyone fights all the time. There's really no benefit to attacking the other faciton really, more than fun. Sometimes it's to stop them taking resource nodes, or quest mobs etc. but since it mostly just ends up costing time for both you and the enemy, a lot of players just don't bother with pvp and keep on questing until someone actually attacks them first.
---
I like oneshotting 90% of the playerbase. Please don't take that away from me.
---
We can heal the cost of lifetap just fine on our own as most of us are Affli. Hell, i can outheal the cost of Hellfire with sufficiently large pulls.
---
Mage here. I can make food for free but warlocks never ask for it. Instead they sit at 5% hp and dont bandage. Ecks Dee!
---
Hiding his power level.
---
My panties have a 100% drop rate
---
You need to travel quite far without stopping for herbs, mining nodes, a puddle of water or daze before it was worth getting mounted with a 60%. 100% is an entirely different story.
---
Not saying it's a good idea, just saying that it's how it is. And even if I was merely "participating", I still demand \_some kind of gratification\_ for saving the damn universe multiple times. Even if I only gave a small % of the total
---
It was cool, you were a near demi-god demon Slayer. Then you went to BFA and got ass reamed by dinosaurs and pirates and everything felt off.
---
Crossroads is famous for random raids from Alliance and the chat.
---
I get the sentiment towards mages AoE grinding, but I don‚Äôt think griefing the mage is a solution. Instead ask if you could group up, a lot of great mages will happily invite you to group. You both benefit. You get the quest done and leave quicker and the mage won‚Äôt have anyone else tagging mobs. Win win situation. 
---
I sometimes grind, especially pre 40 so I could afford the mount or if it‚Äôs for a simple kill or kill and collect quest, it‚Äôs faster and more efficient than single target for us mages. I always invite people to group if they ask or if I see them standing there I know they are on the quest and invite them or ask them if they wanna join.
---
I‚Äôve made many friends this way or at least have had the pleasure of meeting great people.
---
My best experience was probably in Tanaris where I helped a warrior by inviting them to group, he got pirate quests done, as well did I and I made a good friend.
---
Mage AoE grinding is not a bad thing, the mages need to share and the people there should simply ask for an invite.
---
If the mage acts like an entitled 12 year old, or won‚Äôt invite you, go ahead and tag all the mobs you like in that area or wherever as the mage is not entitled to it.
---
Its war and survival of the fittest
---
Classic pushes that home more than anything
---
Yeah. I was in Desolace and ran up to the big lighthouse-like tower on the west coast. Then ran down the hill a little and round to the solitary Argent Dawn guy just standing there on a cliff looking out to sea. Rain pouring down, bleakness. It amazes me that so much work and attention to detail was put into all of the zones and environments in vanilla... all lovingly crafted.
---
Happens to me constantly. Like probably HALF the mobs I loot have sparkles but no loot inside. It's very frustrating, I wish that if they didn't have any loot they'd just NOT have sparkles.
---
Yes, last night started leveling a hunter and got a rare cat named The Rake, started with rank 2 bite at lvl 10
---
Level 35 minimum
---
Generally most warriors should be Cleave tanking dungeons up to a certain point, ie. Using a 2h weapon and dancing to sweeping strikes + WW, and using cleave in Defensive stance. They will never had aggro issues, likely do more damage than the rest of the group, and are still very tanky.
---
Highest dungeon I've done so far using this is ZF at 44, but dungeons higher than that, you might start noticing adverse effects on the healers mana.
---
That's the only one i have already, only reason i'm not stuck confused at level 12 or something like that
---
Cool yea I submitted a ticket yesterday night but haven‚Äôt had any replies as of yet. It does seem like other people are having this problem.
---
1-2 lvls below you? this is some anti-warrior propaganda to scare people into enjoying this amazing class. shame on you!
---
I have these so far. They are great
---
If you are looking for vanilla macros then they won‚Äôt work. The macro system from BfA is implemented instead and it‚Äôs far easier.
---
Build macros like this:
---
#show
---
/use Hunters Mark
---
Yep, Legion to BfA is one of the worst expansion transitions ever.
---
I'll take a look at elvui
---
According to some census polls I've seen, 35-36 is the peak of the normal curve (as of yesterday).
---
Lovely, shortly the game I wanted to return to won't be worth playing anymore because it will need elite player gated. Lovely.
---
Not so Fast, Criminal Scum!
---
after grinding the rep and doing a google search I found this thread and figured id comment my findings, +15 was added in july 2005 with BWL patch and +25 2h was added in march 2006, so yeah they will probably be added later, bummer... I wish the AtlasLoot Addon showed they were later phase lol
---
make sure youre using the [classic](https://www.tukui.org/classic-addons.php?id=2) version of it
---
Is google broken for you?
---
Nice plays my friend!
---
Gotcha. Thanks.
---
Warris loose to everybody in classic :P

West Durotaaaaar,

Barrens' roads, take me home!

What was once lost in time...omg! This brings back so many memories... plz don't stop! I'm so glad u saved that when u did,  haha . I would love the roguecraft series on here, too. I loved them :)
---
#live to win
---
Yes, you must run through higher level area to get to Darkshore/Darnassus. But on 15+ you'll most likely if you follow the road.
---
&gt; Your first paragraph, thats to prevent camping right? So a bunch of 60s cant just stroll into a starting area and camp the noobs? 
---
Yeah sort of.. to let people get a start in the game before being exposed to that.
---
But lvl 60s can easily camp you in contested lvl 20+ zones too, so it's not all true.
---
That sweet sweet hamstring animation is why
---
That's horde for you. Full of people trying to be edgy and reinvent the barrens chat.
---
Lvl 38 and honoured. Got 60G at the moment. I think I won‚Äôt even reach 90G at 40 tbh
---
Does it have better stats *as a pet*?
---
I'm pretty sure hunter pets were normalized in this patch and once tamed, every pet in a family (scorpion, cat, bear, etc) has the same stats except for I think attack speed, but dps is normalized.
---
You are right, it does. It needs a conditional to only do so when the target is there.
---
Where was this? I wanted a rare cat.
---
The scorpion I tamed has claw 2 and poison which is awesome!
---
While I love this feature, it feels super inconsistent to me. Sometimes it refuses to copy to the clipboard.
---
Sprinkle some crushed Doritos on top for that extra crunch.
---
Karazhan Stopwatch.
---
Super important item for a tank in bc through all raidtiers.
---
Took me like 40 runs. Gearing up all the twinks my guild had. Whenever I couldn't come to a raid it obviously dropped.
---
So that would make warlocks... oh no!
---
Everything I got can't even afford one... Individual difference
---
I'm really glad the class quests arent yet available for it. Such an incredibly long instance for what seems like a small area. And when you think it's over it just keeps on going
---
That's a bit of an overstatement. If you crit all 3, the Swipe doesn't cost any rage.
---
Oooh that's really good actually
---
And I wanna say he's east of thunderbluff in that area
---
Fact!
---
How did you get #showtooltip to show on Reddit without adding formatting? Is there an escape character or something?
---
Well, that is what you get for taking a hunter with you. It was true in vanilla and nothing changes. 90% of time hunter equals noob who will have pet on aggressive, with taunt on and doesnt know when he can and cannot use multishot.
---
I not sure, i mainly looked at the attack speed which was faster than others. It also started with rank 2 in a skill
---
Are you the asshole for using your class's abilities to win a duel? What lol
---
It does show them as later phase if you download the latest version. It says P3 if I remember correctly but I've no clue if that actually is correct either. Wowhead still says phase 1...
---
Westfall should have content for you. I went redridge at around 15 and found that im too low to receive most quests there.
---
Just spam SM dungeons as feral tank. Create your own spellcleave group and you'll level super fast!
---
Where the f do you thing google feeds from? People asking questions on the internet. Dont be rude.
---
At level 15?? Bahahahahahahahaa
---
So I heard you like mauls
---
30/0/21 is a very fun Healing/ele spec. Perfectly fine for dungeons, great for PvP, and as long as your raid doesn‚Äôt require you to have mana tide, then you‚Äôre fine healing there as well. 
---
While leveling ele is fine with this meta of cleave groups. +fire damage totems give you better AoE sustain while dropping WF. But it‚Äôs really tough to keep up with Ravager once that‚Äôs available.
---
I was about to comment about how you never saw darkspear in wod, but re read your comment to make sure I wouldn't look like a dumbass. I would've lol. But back in wod there was this dude with 40 accounts who would come into stormshield and just make us his bitches until he got bored

Except, you will experience this exactly the same on every server, as layer is currently active. You are currently only seeing a small portion of the players.
---
Best screenshot I've seen.
---
Likely to change around level 30, as you'll have to choose between buffing people or killing mobs, as 3-4 buffs is enough to completely empty your mana bar.
---
It‚Äôs more useful since armor ha decreasing returns to scale
---
I have a shaman 34 warlock 20 and also another warlock diff faction and server lmao
---
did not know that, thanks for the answer !
---
The only thing I liked about Cata was being able to get an overall view of Stormwind by flying.
---
Once Phase 2 comes around, it will be all good!
---
They are clearly the best at one thing: Getting out of dangerous situations.
---
From Level 30 they can instantly turn into a cheeta for a 40% movement-speed-boost while removing all slow- and snare-effects.
---
Another thing they are the best at is their flexibility. Whatever is missing from your group, you can fill the role. So Druid is the best in getting groups for 5-man-dungeons.
---
Then there's innervate. No other class even has the ability to restore someone else's mana. So they are also the best at this.
---
different angle, it is the same road sign tho.
---
 Right? Same here. Not one damn request and I more often then not get DECLINED.
---
I have been trying to determine why I like classic more. I immediately felt that it just has a totally different feeling, it's not the level cap or comfy changes it does really feel like a different game. If they make some changes, I wish the feeling remains as close to this as possible...
---
Paladin had no problems
---
I met someone like you in Thousand Needles last night. Warlock threw an unending breath on me in the most useless zone ever, also I'm undead, but he still got a stam buff back!
---
when you spec the ability you get level 1 in your spell book, no need to buy
---
/new is legally clogged with hundreds of posts each day of people asking questions that have been asked thousands of times everywhere on the internet. At least 10 posts a day asking "what is meta spec for X class?" Or what should I do at level 10. 
---
Simply tacking the word Reddit onto your Google searches is powerful in itself.
---
Hunters don't miss from my understanding (Don't play hunter and haven't put any time to learning about them) So its easy for them. Mages do get resisted though. So yea it depends. Im always grouped with a Mage gf. We did it at 26ish no problem. All I'm saying. Its totally possible to start GY at 26
---
For raids, sure. For 5mans or grouping, not so much.
---
I dunno, just feels nice for now
---
Holy (Smite) build is acceptable for leveling, it doesn't seem that much slower than Shadown so far. Pretty much wand spec + spirit tap are your mandatory 10 points at start, and then you can go whichever route. Your dps is far from stellar, as the rotation is always: frontload damage + dots, then wand, rinse repeat. However, crap kill times are offset by the fact you have zero downtime whatsoever when fighting single enemies your level. You can literally grind all day and never sit for mana. Which is definitely something to factor in when you compare yourself to e.g. a mage, who goes in guns blazing and kills a mob in a few seconds, but then needs to sit drink every few mobs, or even a lock who needs to balence Drain Life vs Life Tap (although lock is still the king of solo, by virtue of dots, fears, pet tank, no downside and all the other spice).
---
&gt;5 shellfish
---
Fish in a bucket - yeah :D
---
Yeah it's almost like the Horde works like a horde.
---
You can bleed the ones in Gnomer
---
Might only affects melee AP, making Kings far better for Hunters. 
---
Kings is also better for every caster bar healers. More int means more spell crit.
---
It really isn't. go back to /r/gatekeeping with that nonsense. Just because a spec doesn't pull the most dps doesn't mean it's a dick move to your guild. By that logic it's a dick move to not play a fury warrior
---
Charge &gt; blood rage &gt; swing &gt; sweeping &gt; berserker stance &gt; berserker rage &gt; defensive stance &gt; cleave spam with demo shouts every  1-2 sec
---
Private servers existed before tbc. People played for vs paying a sub. Can't compare the two.
---
The ones in Gnomer bleed, I'm pretty sure.
---
You aren't opening with polymorph on a rogue in the wild 90% of the time, and that's being generous.
---
Haven't noticed much negativity toward classic.
---
But parry haste applies to the defender, in other words to the enemy in this case, meaning you get hit faster. May be good for rage through damage taken, but more damage taken = longer downtimes. I'm a bit sceptic.
---
Last I checked the ones in Gnomer bleed, or some of them do at least.
---
Layer boys, this is your new angle of attack. Repost! Repost!
---
To chime in tanks want to use heroic strike as often as possible when shield bash and revenge is on cd because it counts as a yellow hit, which means your hit cap for yellows is lower than whites. That means using heroic strike increases ur chance to hit on bosses. This means you do more threat and this means your dps can go more ham and this means the boss dies faster and this means the healers don‚Äôt go oom and this means less mistakes and this means easier bosses and faster raid clears.
---
This version of CoT is my favourite zone in entire WoW. So much mystery the first time it was found. The endless speculation, some even suggested it had secrets that would yield Ashbringer.
---
Same, have a Mage and a Warrior on the same server. Just to mix things up every so often. And to experience different zones, questlines, professions and well...playstyles. Not really feeling like I'm missing out. If anything I'm trying to relive the experience as much and as diverse as possible. Obviously it's slower but I'm enjoying it nevertheless. Play the way you want and enjoy!
---
It's as good for Warriors as Raptor Strike is for Hunters.
---
So very very good!
---
^/s
---
You can bubble silence, you can't bubble a counterspell but there's no bosses that counterspell
---
It adds 10 to your weapon damage.

Fury warrior for leveling in 2019 is a joke without that enrage bonus and people are figuring out the raw power of arms every day it seems. All fury has is shout duration and an aoe slow.

My class has too much stuff to fit mobile.

What I do is just make an outward gesture that I've accepted my death and whether the guy is intelligent or an idiot he will generally let me live. If you're an idiot you let me live because you're a raging contrarian that wants to be unexpected but I'm expecting my death so what's the next most unexpected thing? If you are intelligent you let me live because of that scene in Schindler's List scene where he says, "power is when we have every justification to kill, and we don't." Showing mercy is power to any intelligent person IMO. For example I had 3 allys on my yesterday and I started jumping and spinning around staying alive as long as possible through their burst. It's possible they were embarrassed that it was taking that long to kill me but they all stopped attacking and stared at me. I did /beg and they all started running away. A christmas miracle

Hundreds of silk cloth.

Once I hit high enough I'll be heading that way my self. Had to run through it a few times for my fishing quest.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. After trying to complete every single barrens quest and actually coming close, the last thing I want to do is stare at tanaris haha. I skipped stv to do the sm grind 30-40, so it‚Äôs nice to be in a jungle. And there‚Äôs a dragon.
---
As a warlock if everyone is drinking then I will too, but my uptime is much more important than a healers uptime when it comes to clearing a dungeon fast. A healer won't need to heal in the first 10 or so seconds of a pull, but I need to be doing damage so we can kill things faster. 
---
This usually isn't an issue in aoe groups because mages need to drink after every pull anyways, but in groups without mages I'll be life tapping away and only drink before/after boss fights or big pulls to keep pace with everyone else.
---
Funny how OP is telling us not to life tap liberally, but my healer friend and another post I saw on here the other day says to abuse life tap lol. I don't even know what to think anymore!

Plot twist - There‚Äôs no turbulence, he‚Äôs just shaking his phone.

So being new to vanilla and never actually using wands until classic, does this go for all levels in dungeons? If I‚Äôm level 60, should I still be wanding?
---
That in itself holds its own value.  It was a pain in the ass and lots of people will agree they didn't like it, but it's memorable and gives people something they can relate to each other about when making small talk about the game.
---
Right

I want this as a macro for everytime I violently gank a horde that's about 30 levels lower than me (I hate myself too). Anyone who knows how?

&gt; I really like how everything stacks.

Except for hots from druids. :(
---
Exactly my thought process. Have it as an addon that only worries about YOU not other people.
---
Depends. If theyre good, probably not
---
Not yet. They're phase 4.
---
Do you fish them or pick up at the cages?
---
Bah, too green for me. I won't step my foot in there until phase 2
---
Doesn‚Äôt thunderclap work well for AoE pulls as well?
---
Easy thing to do, if you have abilities you don't want to downrank make a macro for them. Like this:
---
#showtooltip [spell name]
---
/use [spell name]
---
I'm perfectly fine with that, really. I love co-op games so going Paladin or Priest were really the only classes I seriously considered. Leveling both in the end.
---
"hard to find raiding groups" in retail probably means "spent 20 minutes and all "fresh" runs were full on DPS"
---
Unless it is mythic, but mythic is not supposed to be puggable (it is to some extent, but that's why they open cross-realm mythic after a while)

He drops a quest if you kill him, giving either a 1h mace or a gun, very good for lvl 10 taurens ^^

So flamestrike is important? Isn't arcane explosion used for the same thing
---
I love how the Alliance always leave me alone, until there‚Äôs five of them.  Questing through STV made me much less thoughtful to low level Alliance players...
---
A think to note: Smite leveling (i.e. going Holy, as far as Spiritual Guidance) ain't that bad if you want to mostly heal, with some dps on the side. The damage isn't bad, and you get access to more healing, you also get a lot more value from Spirit, which you want anyway due to Spirit Tap. I went that route and am satisfied, whether it's better than the cookie cutter Shadow leveling build I can't say, but it definitely doesn't seem too far behind (and you get the flexibility of not having to juggle shadow form).
---

Are you playing all day &amp; then this starts? Or can you stay offline all day, login fresh at peak time &amp; it still happens?
---
The fact that your router is getting wonky while you can still see other wifi makes me think your router is maybe being overtaxed. Is it getting hot? 
---
I have a small USB fan plugged into the USB port on my router (nighthawk r7000) that blows across it &amp; my modem. Has actually helped stability quite a bit over the summer. 
---
This ties into my second advice:
---
Do a spectrum analysis. Netgear has some nice tools to see which nearby networks are on which wifi channels. It could also be that a neighbor is loading up they're wifi &amp; they're in the same signal frequency you are. Peak time in-game usually matches peak time for all internet activity after all. 
---
Check what bands are clear &amp; move your wifi to those channels. If your device is competing for radio spectrum it's having to work harder. Hence the first advice above.

You're right. Judging by the interpersonal skills of many people in this thread that dogmatically like to inform other people about their knowledge of the game that such an addon would result in toxicity. Clearly this would be the addons fault. Not the users.

Everyone gets Salv apart from the tanks. Unless there is another paladin, in which case everyone gets Salv TWICE and stop pulling aggro you twats! 
---
( ^i ^know ^they ^don't ^stack )
---
Well .. tbh a level 17 warlock can handle a few Gnolls without to much trouble :P
---
I unwittingly replied to another comment of yours because you have a massive hate boner for Ret paladins (I'm guessing you got ganked by one and got demolished, or demolished on the damage meters) but here's the link I sent again. A great member of the real Classic community who doesn't gatekeep and actually put the work in to show why assholes like you shouldn't shut down "meme" specs
---
I life tap to equalize my health and mana. I never tap my health more than once below my mana. Then I cast drain life to gain health, then tap, then drain, etc while maintaining dots. This is how warlocks play leveling up. Cast a renew on me if you want to help but I dont need you unless I make a mistake and pull aggro. Take ss and a cookie and heal the tank.
---
You precious human, stay that way
---
Maraudon was more of a huge cave to me. Wailing Caverns comes second.
---
especially snakes.

I've pretty much only had toxic interactions so far on Benediction but the random cat calling is a first. Hopefully the normal people just play during the day or something.
---
I don‚Äôt know what fairytale server you two play on but in my experience I‚Äôve met quite a few dicks and people who refuse to communicate. 
---
I‚Äôve had plenty of nice people as well, but people make it sound like everyone is so friendly and nice all the god damn time üôÅ
---
I ask with with a big :D smile timed with a power word fortitude then blow them kisses if I get the water.
---
Wait what? Is this real?
---
Here‚Äôs the thing though. I didn‚Äôt get into WoW until Legion. I grinded random fetch quests until 110. The only thing my character actually did was solo Illidan at level 95 or whatever. Why is my character special? What about my boosted DK? Literally did nothing. 
---
There‚Äôs too many situations to account for that makes sense for everyone. They technically could alter quest text, even the story itself, based on content actually done. Will they though?
---
its a lvl 35'ish quest, the big dudes go up to lvl 46
---
Don‚Äôt get hung up on using guns, the skill doesn‚Äôt help you that much. Just try to find a ranged weapon with the slowest speed without breaking the bank! Get yourself a cat and train it bite and claw and you‚Äôll be golden!
---
They have a portal from booty bay straight to gnomer... Although for some reasons stockades slipped my mind
---
Hi. I'm a priest. If you know how to heal and gear, I am the one telling warlocks to life tap.
---
Make sure u heal people when they are low, and let that 5sec rule kick in. Get spirit gear. Done.
---
Yep. First time playing wow and rolled Horde because Shaman but damn do I love alliance architecture
---
not my ddess! :c
---
I didn't choose one.
---
"you're no warrior! You wouldn't last under my training regime for a single day! Ha! A druid that wants to be a warrior" well. OK. Thanks I guess.
---
*you* can play without spending money, but blizzard still gets their money just the same. actually they get more, since tokens cost $20 instead of $15!
---
I appreciate it thank you!
---
Want to point out, that making an MMO focused on story is not impossible per se, FF XIV does this, you are the Warrior Of Light, and the other players are adventurers you meet in your journey.
---
What FF does differently from WoW is that you are forced to do the Main Scenario Quests (the main story, so to speak) and it is built from the start to play like that.
---
WoW has a completely different structure, since there are no "Main Quests" you don't have the story building around a plot, so when you go to Khadgar and he says "great job on Antorus" when you never even set foot there it's a bit immersion breaking.
---
It's all about structure: in WoW you are an anonymous soldier, maybe an incredibly skilled one who also gain some fame (Tirion Fordring calling you and other people because he knows you are skilled to fight Arthas, you are not the protagonist, you are a member of an elite force (which is a bit out of the Simple Soldier I spoke of earlier, but within reasonable limits)).
---
In FF the main story treats you as the protagonist always, in cutscenes you see only your character, the most important battles are instanced to let you fight alone (or with some important NPCs) vs the BBEG.
---
These are two completely different styles which can't mix together.
---
I only ragequit 1 dungeon and that was BFD. All 4 braziers were hit at the same time and we wiped 3 times already trying to get through it. 
---
I was a bit salty though, didn‚Äôt get to loot the head for the quest and the boss despawned by the time we got back to it.
---
It probably would‚Äôve been nearly as fast to reset the dungeon and clear up to that point again.
---
I identify as a bananamancer
---
Give it 4 years. They will upgrade to tbc
---
and in wpvp all you need is numbers, there's not a lot you can do in a 1v5 fight
---
Have you, uhm, not played d&amp;d online...? The mmo?
---
Thats why I swam along the coastline from Northwestern Wetlands to Southshore directly.
---
Oh, than he is much more awesome than no icon
---
Where would be a good place to go sell at?
---
Earlier today I actually thought of doing that since I was conjuring and not paying attention, and made a stack more than I needed. I wasn‚Äôt sure how much to charge for it and didn‚Äôt want to overprice anyone, so I decided to give it away free. But the guy I traded it to have me 1S anyway, which was cool.
---
I mean Molten Core was cleared in week one, most of the raid not even 60. I don‚Äôt know what everybody‚Äôs sweating over. Maybe when AQ40 rolls out some people will have to min max, til then Christ who cares?
---
ZANDALAR TRIBE IS THE BEST EU/NA/OCE/CN
---
Thanks. That sounds great!
---
Probably
---
I blow kisses and lick low level horde from stealth and watch them shield or aoe all over the place trying to find me lol
---
Awesome story :). Returning player here, and yeah, it definitely is a nostalgia trip. I played WoW for like  4 years, not that long, but in that time, thanks to WoW: I visited friends in England multiple times, I visited Paris on a date with another player, during that time I also met my first girlfriend, I started living together. My life and a big part of me formed while playing WoW and some parts even thanks to WoW, so whenever I play now it's like being back in those moments for a while, while life took its turn after WoW (broke up, had to move back to parents for a while, just bad life things).   
---
It's awesome, and I love it that you love it as well.
---
I'm all for the tool for you. But as soon as you pester me about how I'm playing the game you're on ignore. 
---
If you're raiding, along with min/maxing, maybe the guild leader could use it. But for leveling up when funds are scarce, hell no.
---
60 is actually a completely different story. At 60, in raids, you should be apply your assigned Curse, Corruption (if pre-approved since there is a debuff limit), and ONLY Shadow Bolt.
---
In dungeons, you should be full dotting -&gt; wanding. The increased DPS from Shadow Bolts do not make up for the increased recovery time for both you &amp; your healer. Use Rank 1 Shadow Bolts for your Nightfall procs. The only dungeon exception is if it's a longer boss (meaning your healer is probably going to have to drink anyways).
---
If your wand is out of date and Drain Life is more DPS (Drain Life is also affected by Shadow Damage increases) then you should be doing that instead. You can also Shadowburn to finish them off
---
love is in the detail.
---
Thanks! I appreciate that.
---
An alliance named Wrecked ganked me in STV last night. It was hilarious.
---
Can you level fishing 1-max in the same spot? Or do you need to visit other areas for better fish?
---
Just put some work into Tailoring and you can help gear her!
---
I mean, you literally needed the zone completion achievements in order to advance the end game in bfa. I'm not sure how that makes my statement "not true".
---
this is the reason i have left click interact enabled

It‚Äôs clearly nethergarde keep
---
Glory to the alliance!
---
You mean Goblin the Savior statue.
---
Rogue players are very well known for throwing temper tantrums whenever they receive ANY form of a nerf so I wouldn't expect Blizzard to balance them in a classic+. There is a lot of bad game design in Vanilla because Blizzard didn't really know what they were doing at the time which is something they themselves have said. Most people just put up with it because the overall game is fun.
---
 It adds exact amount to your weapon damage.
---
Weapon damage doesn't affect bleed damage, rake has lower modifier from weapon on its damage formula. Also rake is not worth using... At all, shred does more damage per energy (and it doesn't requires a debuff slot)
---
Tigers fury is not worth using unless you are at 100 energy and about to get another energy tick, it's very mediocre 
---
Shredding is always superiour to clawing in terms of dps and access to back of the boss.
---
But if you are talking about leveling - sure, it's worth it mostly because you can't use shred.
---
Still don't get why ppl subselect dps...you deal dmg, that is enough for me to invite, plus you can open locks inside dungeons
---
Poverty finance has a giant victim complex, like most poor people
---
 Being poor is a mental state
---
what kind of paint and canvas do you use? im thinking about doing some painting myself. like, whats the starter price to get in?
---
Your lack of reading comprehension scares me ... doesn‚Äôt say first time. I said I noticed this is a common theme this go around. Is it shitty luck or is it just the new norm was my question. That coupled with the tank not calling the guy out when you know everyone is using recount this go around.
---
The problem is that in Classic, you can only name your pet once. And forget about just abandoning your pet and going to tame another one; the Pet Loyalty system and the fact that your pet remains the same level that it was when you tamed it, plus the fact that there are far fewer tamable beast mobs in Classic means that pets are *not* expendable. You really do have to pick one or two and stick with them until level 60, where you can finally choose a permanent third pet after you learn the final rank of every pet ability you're going to need.
---
*So if you pick the wrong name, you're fucked.* Especially if the pet you tamed is a rare mob with a unique coloration. Sometimes you just have to wait for the right name to burrow its way into your heart like a maggot digging its way through rotting flesh.
---
Also this one is choosen as default when asset couldn't be loaded

The posts from today seem to say there‚Äôs a macro that works, I‚Äôll try it later and report back if I remember
---
Coming out of early 80s Basic/AD&amp;D.... nah. Only if you want to stretch it. There's just so much more open, imaginal space and _real_ threats. 
---
Seeing computer games come into the picture with more "toy" aspects to jump people out of their imagination was a total "zzzz" moment in RPG gaming. Also, the turn to optimized meta gaming when Magic hit the scene. Everyone at that Gencon was walking around with cards and there was tons of clone games emerging. 
---
With that D&amp;D took a hilarious turn toward the convoluted 3.0 numeric mix/max trash fest, 4.0 was basically a shitty table top MMO,  and the new modern bullshit voice actor D&amp;D is hilarious you see on twitch. It's just so corny and campy compared to the shit that came out of the 70s fantasy/sci-fi age. More rugged, more thoughtful. 
---
Everything trickles down to normie town and sucks a lot of essence out of it.

But he‚Äôs definitely not a hunter
---
I have five Hunters in retail and classic. They all have a pet named Carl.
---
I may be overlooking something but i thought my only method of escape was ghost wolf which will be a 3 second cast and earthbind/frost shock?
---
Ironforge too cozy, best city.
---
I don't like how open darnassus is. Like, 90% of the buildings don't even have walls. It is an odd decision and makes it look weirdly unfinished, especially considering other nelf villages have plenty of normal houses with walls.
---
If you're not willing to do some basic communication in an mmorpg then you're as much part of the problem as him.
---
It does add to your game experience. The long corpse runs make you fear death more :D.
---
Learn it and sell the fish on the AH. This is how I made most of my money back in the day. Throw on a show, do some fishing, profit.
---
not enough "GOGOGO"
---
Wait till you get to the plaguelands
---
The animation is delayed but pretty sure the damage goes off at the same time.
---
Everyone seems to want mages and locks, probably because of the current spellcleave phenomenon
---
Thank you for mentioning battle shout. I even see supposedly amazing tanks never use it or even mention it. It is amazing threat.
---
For whatever reason on my HM macro ‚ÄúHunter‚Äôs Mark‚Äù would not work but ‚Äúhunter‚Äôs mark‚Äù did. It‚Äôs the only spell I haven‚Äôt capitalized for my macros. So weird.
---
The amount of people refusing to join non-cleave groups is infuriating. I also have yet to see a hunter join any of my groups (I play warrior and tank every dungeon).
---
Meanwhile when I'm tanking on my druid I'm like "dude lifetap already, I'm gonna heal you back up, pre hot myself and we can go on while the healer keeps drinking"
---
 Redder (Druid) here. I was looking for random c'thun info and got here :D nice to see a video of our first kill after months of pain.
---
&gt;my class and profession training  
---
Have you considered not training all skills and all professions ?  
---
If you want to have the gold by 40, only learn crucial skills that you use in every encounter, and only learn recipes for items that will help you level up your profession if you so desire (use a guide if unsure).
---
Have a friend/guildie invite you and hope they are on another layer
---
While it's cool to wield Ashbringer, it kinda breaks the immersion when you're in a raid with 3 other people also wielding Ashbringer. It's cool to be the archmage, but it's less cool when you're in a raid with 3 other archmages, 2 of which are contributing more than you. While you might be okay with it, it's very poor writing.
---
Absolutely, but we're talking about whether or not opening with poly is comparable to a rogue opening from stealth. I don't think rogues should be granted free openers in duels, but there is no common scenario that leads to a mage opening on a rogue with poly in the wild.
---
Yeah dude this lock was rain of firing until oom in the middle of a pack of mobs. Then if I knew I had 1-2 heals until I went oom he would bitch at no heals.
---
Do warlocks really get a mount at 40? I heard it was coming in phase 2 or something
---
Agreeeeed
---
20-30 and 40-50 are the biggest grinds, imo
---
thats what he/she said?
---
Nice,  abusing layers and then being public about it. Top human!
---
Im always the healer and I always end up doing it a few lvls too soon. Gives me hard ptsd of hunters/locks pulling the whole place and people who stand on mines üò≠ and the damn caster hat I never saw drop once in freaking 10years+.
---
When i discovered wow i was pleased seeing that everything seems to be put in place for a reason. Ie: woods are not not randomly duplicated trees like in Daoc.
---
Glittering gold, trinkets and baubles, paid for in blood.. 
---
Man I love the quotes in that game, so iconic and powerful, I will never forget some of those quotes.
---
Don't get as much time to play as I'd like, only at about 33 hours played and just got 25 on my mage. It's weird, on live I exclusively play healers, so wanted to go back and make a mage like I did as my first char 10 years ago. It's fun...but I'm starting to look.enviously at druids and shamans
---
Spoken like a true healer

Yeah, i would not pay for this either - to be honest, is this different from Mage portals? They were also charging in Vanilla for these kind of services (and more then the portal stones they had to buy as well). Similarly for mage water/food conjuring, tips expected - or rogues offering there unlock services at the bridge in Ironforge.
---
Just dont buy/use these services (i never did - even went as far to roll a rogue to level the lockpicking so i could open my own boxes :D ).
---
He is just asking for this - nobody forces these warriors to do it - in fact, now that the servers are so crowded, warriors should be able to group up to complete this quest actually. If taking 5-10 minutes to group up is too long and they rather pay 3g .. well ..?
---
based
---
You're also spamming HS for deep wounds procs
---
I'm already level 36 though  :(
---
I'm a horde priest and I do a kinda similar trick to my friends some times, except maybe a little more evil.. When jumping off the zep early in UC, i just throw them a fortitude buff so they die when they hit the ground.
---
This is a bug from WOTLK. Why would they use a WOTLK version of HS in Classic that has a known issue?
---
If cementery was closer you wouldn't give a shit about dieing.
---
But Deus Vult.
---
That's for people rushing through content, fine by me, im enjoying the ride, so for a dungeon i pick what is available and make the best out of it lol
---
Its midway between, if it is a 20% drop, everyone has a 20%  chance to get it. IMPORTANT, when 1 person in party has everything but stays to help, they MUST loot the corpses so the other players can get thier drops.
---
Noggenfogger is clearly the best.

No &gt;:( this devalues my lifetap and cannibalise only Ironman.
---
He kept saying this is a speed run you have to heal everyone lol.  Definitely doesn‚Äôt realize at mid twenties there is no group heal yet , and a healers priority is the tank apparently.
---
We get it, you think you're funny
---
I'll name my pet when you kill mobs with your 2-handed Steve
---
All classes have points during the leveling experience where they will be weak or strong.  You shouldnt reroll because they seem strong because in 5 or 10 levels they may really have really fallen off and by that time anofher class is tempting you because they are experiencing a period where they are stronger.
---
this is really a unique method, but it actually sounds like it would be easier, not sure if I want to change the entire setting and I'm really used to wasd, I can imagine how once I turn the game on I put my fingers on wasd..
---
Thanks, glad you liked it!
---
Well, very few people used the same skin and others mogged over it. I honestly think it was fine.
---
Also consider that the extra damage from heroic strike will get mitigated as well. Really you're only adding a tiny amount of damage.
---
Now what I'm interested is the use of sunder armor over just using your non auto attack like mortal strike. At what point is sunder better? At which point are 5 sunders better?
---
No you dont, drop rate is drop rate, even on auctionable items now.
---
First pet was a boar called Macon.
---
He has been replaced with a cat.
---
I'm an Orc called Tusktooth so I called him Snaggletooth.
---
Will you play in half a year?
---
O nice thanks for your info !!
---
It the collective guild is okay with him going ret there's no problem. He's still gonna be a buff bitch and will certainly have to heal in certain moments. And if they allow him to even tank that's fine as well, even if pally tanks are barely able to do it outside of dungeons.
---
I think that I play the game completely wrong.  I never read the quests' description. I never thought it as a dnd campaign.
---
The trick is to not spend money on skills that aren't necessary. For instance I'm a Paladin and I'll get things like Divine Protection, Judgement upgrades, Seal of Righteousness upgrades, but I wont get things like Shadow Protection Aura, or Frost Resistance Aura.
---
Not true.

Yesterday I grouped up with 4 other people to kill a bunch of pirates in Tanaris. Everyone stuck around until we all collected the 20 pirate hats for the quest. It was so nice. We all had fun and got chatting and ended up doing some other quests together too. Ganked a few Alliance and one even joined my guild by the end. 
---
This is what I came back for. This is the experience I wanted. It's great.
---
No the truth is, while the healer drinks you can easily pull if everybody else is ready. You just need to know your limits (that's something I encourage both when tanking and healing alike)
---
I think once you get lvl 25 water its perfect because the vendor stack costs 20s
---
Totally wrong. group loot, if its a 20% drop rate, it stays 20%
---
No need to repeat what he said mate.
---
This is how you sound right now:

"Hey guys, I'm thinking about rubbing ghost peppers on people's genitalia so that we can diagnose people with leprosy."   
---
        
---
"Don't do that. It would not be pleasant."
---
"It wouldn't need to be rubbed on YOUR genitalia. Only I need to be told who around me has leprosy."
---
       
---
"Ignoring the obvious impossibility of the situation, that wouldn't help the lepers if only you knew so what's the point in the first place?"
---
"OMG why are you people so toxic?! Stop shitting on my idea! It's your fault you don't want singing urethra! THE PEPPER IS BLAMELESS AND PERFECT. "
---
Obviously taken the extreme in a ridiculous way, but you don't seem to quite understand why people are disagreeing with you.
---
Yeah same, I was hard set on mage for months before classic launch and at last minute went rogue and absolutely loving it so whatever, I‚Äôm happy
---
Priest isn‚Äôt any different at mid twenties . We don‚Äôt have the spells or the mana to spam heals on everyone.
---
Save professions for later unless you can make gold from it.
---
I find it helps to have and alt to send gold to, that way you can't spend it. It helps.
---
I mean I'm getting random whispers about joining Sunken Temples, BRDs and Maraudons too, buuut I'm only 54. I have seen a couple of LFG posts for Scholo with "LF 1 dps, no cloth" or smth, so...
---
People have been stuck in this one-minded meta forever. Yes, in vanilla Prot is not as good as it was in later expansions (particularly Wrath where it really opens up). But even in classic Prot is not to be overlooked. Revenge spam is good DPS, with stuns ta boot. Once you get Concussion blow and Improved Shield Bash (silence the target) then PvP gets fun as hell too.
---
It's slower to level with, but you can do so much by yourself. Your name will travel on the server too, and you'll get PMs to tank dungeons constantly.
---
You can't just up and take an Arms player and re-spec him then expect good results. Playing Prot is an entirely different can of worms and you have to know how to macro the skills.
---
That‚Äôs their epic mount at 60.

Can you please bind your spells? thanks

I'm aware, classic raiding is very easy and while it's probably possible to clear all content with 25-30 players, it's a time investment, people like making things as easy as possible for themselves, and having meme specs in your raid goes against that and creates drama.

Since people are being stupid about it, some additional info:

I didn't use layering. I was on holiday from work. Meaning I had 8 tries a day for about 10 days. Minus some sleeping. Not everyone who plays WoW enjoys exploiting the game. Some people actually play it the way it's supposed to be.

Hate gnomer with a passion. My first run in classic, we had a Druid healer. In addition to constantly leaving the fight to get the boxes for the quest (whatever the 15/15 things are called), he would prioritize DPS over healing, to the point that out offtank pally ended up taking over the role entirely. After the first wipe right before Pummeler, he said ‚Äútold you you guys are shit‚Äù and left.
---
Fuck you Rosha
---
mute the audio, if you focus ... you can hear stormwind music ...i know i can hear it

Yeah I believe it‚Äôs not the norm and I‚Äôve just had terrible luck.  It is obnoxious though

Yep. We've had to reform / rename. Pretty sad.

I was very sure WoW classic was gonna be a lead balloon. But at least for now, me and my friends are having a blast with it. I still don't see it keeping up the same popularity long term though. Once the levek grind ends and people find out how much time they will have to dedicate to progress through raiding there will be a sharp drop in players.
---
I think we are gonna see the first server merges late 2020 to mid 2021. That is still a good long run and there will probably still be a big enough playerbase for Blizzard to keep it going. 
---
What I do hope the long term effects of the success of Classic are gonna be, I hope it will make Blizzard consider the future design of retail.
---
Classic evidently provides something for a lot of people that retail  no longer does. 
---
I just hope they can still take that into consideration for the next expansion.
---

I am hoping that all the hours people are logging on Classic will influence the game developers for Retail. Bring back difficulty, the need for teamwork outside of just top raiding, and effort. People feel like they achieved something when they level up in Classic more than when they get an achievement in their sticker book in Retail.
---
More fun that you can find it for free like everywere
---
I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from, I love flying but it does take something away at the same time, I guess it all comes down to preference and balance

herbs/ores and locations only work for kalimdor not eastern kingdoms

The floor here is made out of floor.
---
there is one q to grab the journal - shareable   
---
the second q is part of a chain - shareable but op would have had it if he was on that part
---
Think of flamestrike like blizzard, controls an area for extended period of time
---
I try my best, the issue with named NPCs is that sometimes they would pat around, running into your AoE (sometimes without you even noticing, think humans in hillsbrad) or just screwing you up by attacking you and interrupting your AoE. If it‚Äôs in an open area, fine I can run and reset, in closed areas it can be really difficult and could cause you to die and risk a long ress run. 
---
I personally avoid them to let people tag for their quest or because they can have certain abilities that can easily screw up AoE. Like casters or stuns/cc.
---
It‚Äôs unfortunate that the experiences you had made you feel this way, but sticking to the ‚Äúill just stop asking‚Äù thing will only make you miss out on a lot of potential fun you could have. I can also promise you that not all mages are entitled 12 year olds and not all of us are doing it to race to 60. I rolled a mage because it was originally what I played when I started in BC and I had missed that kind of play style of mage. My /played is around 5days and I‚Äôm only lvl 47. Which is probably horrendous for a mage as I believe the world record currently is like 2 days?
---
on pservers i used to semi afk at the end of the horde escort quest that ends in ratchet.  was able to kill the npc.  to my disapointment i found you cant attack the npc on classic ;(
---
bonus points was the horde group 99% of the time would attack me out of sheer rage and anger, i would walk to the ratchet guards and watch the guard smack the shit out of them. haha

---
Every time you did all those cool heroic things, there was somebody who we all could see as Hero. To fix all those bad writings all what they should be done is change direct addressing to our characters. Instead "Hello hero of Horde, slayer of Legion" just use "Hello \*IMPORTANT LORE FIGURE\* I see you came with one of finest sons of Horde, who helped you slay Legion. \*Proceed to speak with ILF\*"
---
As horde it‚Äôs the alliance hold bridge in AV. 
---
Short path, very scary.
---
So it will lay out damage over time?
---
No. that's not snapshotting. Snapshotting is applig dots while you're completely buffed to the skys, and the dot gaining the dmg from those buffs, and keeping them even after the buffs run out.
---
Cassyla, 31 rogue atm - Feel free to ask for help with any lower-level dungeons if you see me online :)
---
Which is a bug, it never worked that way in vanilla. FD/Trap is an absolute staple Hunter PvP move and always has been.
---
STV is literal hell right now. No mobs alive at all literally in every questing zone. Drop chance from goblin mobs is next to zero and people are running there alone because loot is not shareable. STV can make you feel very mad. Even ganking is horendous there. I am an alliance player. But STV is always like that... Just get over it quickly and move to next location like Badlands, Dustwallow, Swamp of sorrows or grind somewhere else.
---
Yeah Classic has dynamic spawns implemented, the more populated a certain area is, the more spawns there will be
---
This sounds like my jam, I need to seek out a way to move realms
---
Surprisingly the level 50 water isn't too bad, 3k mana over 30s for my 4k mana pool is decent.
---
Put your fucking phone away and press the printscreen button.
---
Whoever wrote that and let it through into the game should have been censored or sacked. It's not only immersion breaking, it telegraphs a lack of respect for the game.
---
If you're alliance I have nothing for you.
---
It's horde only and all I can recommend for you is fishing or floating treasure in stranglethron
---
One of the said it best, the main character of classic WoW is the world.  Retail is ~~bad~~ different cause the player is the main character.
---
TL; DR - Blizzard made us all out to be special snowflakes and it feels bad man.
---
SO WE CAN BLACKLIST HIM SO HE CAN NEVER DO RAIDS THEN WE CAN HARASS HIM AND NOT BUY HIS STUFF ON AH 
---
/s
---
I figure if a mage gives water to the dps they will do more dps and not conserve as much so it benefits the mage to give it away
---
I'm a hunter and did have a mage in my group today ask for tips for their water in the group I kinda wanted to deny their water and auto attack the whole dungeon
---
Would be great, but living in the era of loot boxes and microtransactions.. that project would be a much higher risk than creating another lootbox simulator. Don't forget who owns Blizzard.
---
The sparkles on empty mobs is so nobody can skin it until you've touched it.
---
Yup. Also as they add in the PvP factions, the Stormpike/Frostwolves have a lot of cool stuff
---
 Hello fellow ZT. I totally agree
---
With barely any players on them. Nostalrius was big yes but it was a meme. It had major news backing and it shut down before most of that large playerbase figured out just how sparse endgame can get in Classic.
---
I use my phone for reddit. Can be on my pc without playing wow
---
Sigh, stop taking pictures and videos with your phone, use the print screen button...
---
Gz
---
no. it's even in the name, you snapshot you cooldowns in the small window of your spell flying
---
Found out you can take on camps of mobs by attacking one and kiting it without attacking the others and they will run back while the one you attack will stay on you. I love how the game gives a great sense of progression and also drives people to learn to play better to overcome challenges while leveling. In retail ive leveled alts and didn't realize I had no idea how to play them till endgame content. Never had a reason to learn I guess. 
---
Also the fact everyone is on the ground and not flying around encourages a bit more interaction. Plus buffs are the friendliest greeting there is.
---
Also got the quote wrong. "Here Georgie, take it" is the quote.
---
9. Every Horde zone Chestnutz enters turns into "Contested" until he stays.
---
There is no excuse for screenshots taken with the phone, sry.
---
There is no bug with autoloot.
---
I have it turned on since release.
---
Some mobs dont have loot. That is normal in wow classic.
---
It would look like there is loot in the bag because of rendering/fetching from the server.  But if you dont get loot, then there is no loot.
---
‚ÄúLoot, or loot not. There is no always loot‚Äù
---
If you start over and over as a fresh character etc, it kinda loses "rpg" element right? The point of role playing games is that you invest your time in your character and exploration of the world.
---
Just don‚Äôt let Reddit contribute, then it would be ‚Äùblurry phone picture of a computer monitor of the day‚Äù
---
I play as a priest and I say just get the hell over it. A priest isnt usually needed til like halfway through the pack, the faster the dps are full and able to pull the faster the dungeon goes. So what if I'm still drinking for a little bit when it gets pulled. It isnt that big of a deal.
---
Playing  backup healer is the cost
---
Yeah it's like, the fantasy of being the Highlord of the Silver Hand is cool, but further feeds into the idea of wow being a singleplayer game (for the record I loved Legion but for entirely different reasons for why I'm in love with classic.)
---
In classic, Thrall doesn't even refer to you as a direct member of his troops or anything when doing the rfc quest chain. You're just "an adventurer", and to me that's what wow is all about. In Classic, human rogues could take contacts from SI:7, you're freelance. In Legion, the leader of SI:7 was your bitch.
---
I prefer being a nameless adventurer, but I understand that after all the things our character has canonically done throughout the story, our names would carry renown. They just didn't do it exactly as they should have. As a Demon Hunter, I never felt like the leader, Kayn Sunfury was. He just asked me about stuff every now and then. That's what they should have done, make the player a high ranking member, but not the boss.
---
I was layer surfing in un'goro to kill devilsaurs with my pal when I found this lv60 gnome mage killing devilsaur with low mana. As I had played mage back in the days I knew there's literally no fucking way he can kill me before going oom while having the devilsaur also on his ass. I naturally released my pet on him and started shooting. He blinked next to me and got nova off before dying. Few extra hits and I got the devilsaur and its skin.
---
Call me back when you've got a role in raids that isn't just "being a worse fury warrior".
---
My only issue with classic is that for many its more of "how fucking fast can I reach 60" than it originally was, not talking about speed running but I see so many comment on general "ugh Im not even 60 yet"
---
Kinda ruins it for me for some reason.
---
I must ask where you farmed the Thick Wolfhids at?
---
Does he not have a phone?
---
mouseover macro + raidUI in normal partys
---
Is it possible to spam dungeons without having to actively look for people. I‚Äôm one of those hyper efficient nerds who dislikes downtime from OSRS. This is a deciding factor for me wanting to play. I cba looking for a group for an hour.
---
People 2hand tank in raids??
---
kinda adds to the problem doesnt it? we're giving you all ashbringer. but its fine because you dont HAVE to use ashbringer model A... most people would transmog them anyway. "your weapon actually doesnt matter" still feels so strange to me
---
&gt; Call me back when you‚Äôve got a role in raids
---
Have a Warlock lvl 27, didn't go paladin because i couldn't stand healing again, i was wrong, loving it and got my Verigan's Fist at lvl22 so i'm going good
---
When I was in STV last week I a priest MC'ed me and gave me Fort, then his pally friend gave me Blessing of Wisdom.
---
ive noticed the people who say this end up being kinda assholes themselves. have you heard the saying if you run into assholes all day...
---
what? there is group +exp. who ever is telling you, you get less exp is a moron. and should look at his/her chat window from time to time. there is a setting to display exp gain, and every time i have grouped up, i got +group exp to my normal exp.
---
Man needs to level up his fishing it seems
---
Go self advertise elsewhere
---
I got your back, I'm painfully aware of the subject at hand
---
Screw you. I was doing an actual quest. lmao
---
The cat?
---
Fisting is 300 bucks.
---
I'm not sure if you're trollin' and I'm missing it, but no, the snapshot refers to dots keeping the stats of of when cast. You take a snapshot of those stats and they're what are kept for the dot dmg, even when they're no longer on the player.
---
This is a thing in many games.
---
tip: make it mouseover macro. That way you can mark mobs without having to switch target. Super useful for when there's a caster that needs nuking but you are quite busy handling melee trash
---
Thus history repeats itself ... the Huntard meme exists for a reason.
---
We killed Stanley!
---
Noice Baby, Dwarf Warrior in Heretic won it.
---
No? Resilience didn't affect anything? Have fun with your 30 minute arena matches, then.
---
I remember approaching Darnassus for the first time and the grass texture looked like a chess board. Still loved it.
---
I‚Äôm 100% the ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather solo‚Äù guy. You do your own work, you get your own rewards, and you come and go as you please. I‚Äôll still group for things if I feel like it‚Äôs reasonable, like a long escort quest. But aside from that I‚Äôd rather do my own thing.
---
Unfortunately the lazy tag along player is all to common. That‚Äôs my main reason for just avoiding groups. I actually had someone get pretty shitty with me for refusing to group to kill the turtles outside of hillsbrad. He suckered someone else into the group and I watched that guy do all the killing while the shitty guy followed behind looting and skinning.
---
The only error I see is "night elf mage". That actually means you are not playing classic but retail.
---
Have fun nonetheless
---
It's not blizzards fault we were all too retarded to spam aoe in dungeons 15 years ago but can do it now that the game is this old
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RGBnjELkgok
---
The one and only &lt;3
---
God I'm slow
---
I believe so mate
---
There used to be a page that listed the most killed mobs and the the mobs that killed players the most. They should bring that back.
---
Faster attack speed is the big one, but you can always look out for pets that simply look cool.
---
Doesnt strength give 2 ap per point? As opposed to 1 ap per point plus crit on agil.
---
* The Rake - Level 10 - Mulgore
---
* Humar The Pridelord - Level 23 - The Barrens
---
* Broken Tooth - Level 37 - Badlands
---
Are some I know of, but you can find a complete list online
---
There is no way to balance flying. I played somewhat frequently in Legion and the experience was pretty nice. That all went away once I could fly.
---
My main is level 9.
---
How do you kill horde as horde?
---
Mists's solo scenarios were fun though. i feel like they could have been done correctly with a little push in another direction.
---
I just paid someone 10k to tag along for it, wasnt about to farm that
---
There's both tanking and healing. And being an even worse rogue.
---
But I wasn't being fair, rogues are neat for making the Suppression Room less hellish.
---
Use renew - dont worry about keeping them 100 % health all the times.
---
STOP MAKING MY MANA YOUR MANA
---
I don‚Äôt get it :(
---
You take the axe! Axe spec is better when leveling as crit helps alot more
---
My cat is lovingly called GASH, i have a stabled bear called GUSSET.
---
The amount of time my gusset has saved me it unreal, and dont even get me started with people hitting on my gash!
---
And not just lore wise. All the cool stuff we unlocked in our artifact was ripped from our hands for no reason. I *liked* having those things. Take my artifact away, fine. Leave my fun stuff here though. I wanna shoot lava and lightning spikes at my enemy when I crit with Stormstrike. I want wake of ashes, feral frenzy and whatever the demon hunter ability was called to be baseline abilities. Fuck you Blizz.
---
How do you change ingame font? :) nice video!
---
Got my Invincible from a BMAH container for 250K. Got so tired of running ICC
---
All day boizz. Water is always free tips greatly appreciated !!!
---
&gt;There‚Äôs too many situations to account for that makes sense for everyone. They technically could alter quest text, even the story itself, based on content actually done. Will they though?
---
Yes, because they did. The lore has been retconned numerous times already. That's why it is the clusterfuck it is today. They weren't consistent.
---
You answered your own question.    Had to move quick because horde was grouping.   And there was an addon that all you had to do is /inv  which I did not have and he did.   In hindsight I thought that would be quickest and easiest
---
You mean a picture?
---
This would go good along side a PSA to healers to chill out and wait and see if the warlock actually needs to be healed. 90% of the time when I tap up I follow it up immediately with a bandage or a cannibalize or even a health potion (I have them in spades). Sometimes healers will see that I'm low and top me off without giving me a chance of healing myself, and rarely a healer will freak out that I "expect them to heal me instead of drinking."
---
In addition, what the other guy said is right, too: Even if I plan to drink, I will likely tap until my health and mana are equal and then eat &amp; drink at the same time which does in fact save a few seconds between each pull.
---
I did'nt claim to be effective
---
Oh i meant Rouge whoops thanks for pointing it out man :)
---
whats up with SS fetish ? dont you see the picture? posting phone taken pictures is fast and simple. geezus
---
I thought that was the case and said so in general but was shot down by like 5 or 6 other people so I figured I was mistaken.
---
Screenshot of your Screenshot of the Day. Rolls right off the tongue.
---
I love the danger of ACTUAL pvp.    
---
Not so much the danger of a ?? rogue just one shotting me out of stealth.  That's just a bullshit waste of time, and not actual PvP, in the same sense that a child stepping on ants is not UCF.
---
Don't listen to this guy. WW axe is awesome.  Much better for solo questing and world pvp than Ravager. I got it at 31 and could instantly compete against lvl 34 / 35 mobs solo... I also wooped a 38 dwarf warrior (who was wielding a ravager) because it procced and I could get an intercept into exectue lol.
---
Well I have a clip of me losing the roll, nothing I wanna share here though
---
I mean I'm not gonna flat out recommend it, it's a cool game but I don't know how active it is. It is free though, so if you feel like it there it is.
---
Yes. Every day. Thats how often its reposted.
---
I have to delete my other rogue to not be tempted att go back if it gets hard lvling the Troll.
---
I tamed a rare cat in Teldrassil level 9, I havent been able to teach tim rake or claw, any idea what level he gets it? Im lvl 14 rn.
---
Right in the feels :(
---
Its Samwise Gamgee, the fat Hobbit.
---
Addon Leatrix Plus has an option for that.
---
 If you wanted complex you should roll feral, lol.
---
Ok, this was everything I needed and more. Thank you SO much!!!
---
this is so true try to make sure the heal dont have aggro at any time (heal generate alot of threat) and if a mob run to the heal u catch it in low lvl dungeon its just impossible to allways hold aggro
---
Bind spells
---
I learned 225-300 skinning last night at level 30 on my priest so idk if the level 35 number is wrong, skinning doesn't count as a real primary profession, or a bug allowed me to train, but I did it. 4.5 gold in Desolace (Horde).
---
That's true of anything, I think. When you know what to do and you've done it before, it isn't any challenge at all.
---
First time I went there I fucked up, forgot quests outside, ran too far from the goblin and failed the escort, and group disbanded before I could do the ring quest so I had to painfully make my way there alone.
---
Second time, I knew exactly what to do so I steered my group towards all the quests and we got everything done in a timely manner.
---
And I'd done it some 50 times during wotlk before all that so I knew the place by heart. It's the same with leveling. First time around I made some mistakes that cost me time, did inefficient quests, in an inefficient order. Second time around, way less mistakes and almost half the time saved. And I'd leveled countless times through those zones, just not during vanilla.
---
A new player will be stuck in 100 different places and situations before getting to 60, if they haven't quit before. I know I did the first time I played.
---
The best combination would be a new player having an experienced player guiding him. That way you get the best of both worlds.
---
Because they're sitting at a machine fully capable of playing WoW, flawlessly capturing its screen and posting it to reddit all at the same time.  And in terms of efficiency it also would likely be faster and require less work.
---
Yep, my group had a runner than ended up running all the way around the side of the temple.
---
...but he did not escape! &gt;:D
---
In vanilla to learn new pet abilities have to constantly tame new higher level pets of a similar family to obtain high rank spells
---
Insert here_comes_the_money.mp3 gratz my dude!
---
I actually managed to do that, and then run out of the alternative entrance, so everyone died but me.
---
Thanks man for the clarification :)
---
I will work on it and try it tonight!
---
Im 300 and I just started making gold with Enchanting. Got my epic Mount yesterday. Selling mostly +9 / +9 agility/str gloves enchant. Also +100HP sells good. My guildies TIP me everything between 1g-15g without me asking and randoms usually put a 5g without asking. Made 340g last night Enchanting a guild day before getting ready to do MC.
---
Wait, what? Really?!
---
What's so bad about being tempted to go back? Classic isn't going anywhere.
---
This is my exact same dilemma. I am most likely going to drop it for skinning.  Enchanting is cool and i love making 1000 wands. But once I get to level 40 it's going to be a waste.
---
OP is awfully silent.
---
oh, i do too. oldschool runescape has the same sort of system too, i haven't paid a sub for either game in ages. i've considered just trying to make money on retail to sustain my sub on classic too, but i'm just not sure it's worth the effort...
---
Please not extra factions like scourge you can do that in bfa.
---
You don‚Äôt need anything. You choose what you want and do that. In fact the fastest leveling methods in BfA have been either killing monsters in dungeons or islands.
---
Grob is fine lol
---
[For a little nostalgia](https://web.archive.org/web/20041230093402/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/)
---
Thank god you're not the person who decides what has and doesn't have place in raids, or we'd all be playing a way more boring game.
---
elemental is better BUT both the wolfshead helm (which is bis until the last days of naxx) and devilsaur (which is preraid bis) are tribal
---
NO RUNNING BY THE POOL !
---
Alright that'll be 20 silver :)
---
One reason, wow classic
---
My bad, i thought i was replying to the asshat who you were replying to. The guy whos saying taunt increases threat if the target is already attacking you.
---
I‚Äôm a new Warlock (only played melee classes back then) and I always kinda felt guilty if a healer healed my after Life Tap.
---
But it‚Äôs just the most efficient way to pump out damage for us. I know than wanding (plus DoTs) is a valid alternative in lower dungeons, as the DPS is still pretty good, but the higher I get the more I like to use Shadow Bolt to pump out as much as I can to simply kill enemies quicker (which also means them doing less damage that needs to be healed). And that‚Äôs when Soul Tap becomes necessary.
---
So healers, don‚Äôt be mad ad us, we just want to kill the mobs fast.
---
And warlocks: Pay respect to you group and keep handing out those Health and Soul Stones.
---
Unlikely, as they could easily have done a balance pass after launch.
---
Bear Grylls ready to try rank 4
---
this is still why I can't enjoy games like Skyrim. I hate being the chosen one, king of the realm, grand wizard, vampire, werewolf, assassin leader, thief king, slayer of big bad, collector of all macguffins, spending my time being worshipped by literally every NPC who passes by me. I can get behind MAYBE one of those things on the list not all of them at once.
---
*Healer begins to mindblast*
---
Some people just play because that‚Äôs what they are used to and don‚Äôt have fun. I‚Äôve been one those people before realizing why I was I was unhappy etc etc... growing up at a young age playing games does take a toll if you don‚Äôt know how to manage it or understand the point of playing the games.
---
I truly hated when by full green mage Battlecrab led all the leaders of the Horde and a few demigods in a charge against a few mobs, with them telling me \_"Lead us, champion"\_.
---
WTF dude I shoot fireballs at things, you lead me...
---
Til you can tab through multiple enemies to target them
---
Hunter weapon.
---
...for that sweet sweet Serpent Sting and Mend Pet. :P
---
N√§tti√§!
---
As opposed to my current rotation when doing dungeons, which is 'spam frostbolt and occasionally sheep the moon on packs n&gt;3'.
---
I'm enjoying Classic immensely, but this kind of comment is pretending it is something it isn't.
---
Doubtful
---
In vanilla there is no flying at all....
---
Seems like you will regret it but your choice. Trolls look much cooler than gnomes so there is always that :D
---
I was running BRD repeatedly last night and at some point the group wiped by pulling a trashpack at the golem foundry area just past the Molten Span. I had all the time in the world to look around and jesus, the amount of detail in that room alone. 
---
It was the first time I ever got to properly loon around that room, mostly because it's quite small and you just get past it so fast. They have massive molds of the golems near the lava furnaces and you really get the feeling that this massive city, which is a dungeon, is just extremely fleshed out and alive.
---
I mean I‚Äôm not the one that came into what was clearly a joke thread, spouting shite. But ok üëçüèª
---
I always buff both unless in oom
---
Judging by the recent posts here it sounds like most people regret taking their free transfers.
---
Fuck, I'm level 28. How long do we have?
---
I assume there's an Alliance equivalent of the quest in front of Ironforge.
---
probably a german player. Willensst√§rke translates literally to will power, and yes it is spirit in english.
---
There's a simple one-step list to achieve that:
---
1. Fishing
---
A threat meter. So the dps can see how hard they can push when you are tanking.
---
Yea you missed it man games over sorry
---
I don't think so.
---
We like uglyness.
---
Trust me, keep vendoring gray items and skinning etc, when you get closer to 40 and further items sell for a lot
---
Yes it does!  I spend a good 5 minutes or more conjuring buffing and drinking every time I log in. And when people request the fruits of that labor, it takes even longer before I can actually play the game. 
---
I sometimes wonder if it‚Äôs more efficient for me to just buy water from a vendor.
---
i tanked him with a ww axe at 37 + defensive stance lol
---
pop shield wall, swap over, no threat issues
---
healer was oom by the end of both tho
---
Hypnotic blade and orb of the forgotten seer, though...
---
Well the modern client has level 10 grass and environment settings vs 3 of classic lol.
---
yeah.. too bad everyone plays a rogue :D
---
&lt;3
---
Humor. You call that humor.
---
You probably need to grind more/ more trash value mobs. Just a guess tho. I did alot of grinding and was about 8g off hitting 40.
---
You can actually just stay on the elevator and mobs will not attack you there. Would be pretty hard to recover from there, though.
---
You do not need to be in d stance to sunder.
---
The abcence of choice. The only choice you can do is not to do something otherwise your character is just a murderhobo. You can ofcourse roleplay your character on rp server or in your head but the game itself doesnt provide mechanic for roleplaying.

Holy shit you‚Äôre dense
---
They acknowledge you for who you are but they don't want you around. Which is understandable since you just showed up out of nowhere and are now running around like you own that place.
---
Classic NPCs also acknowledge you for who you are. A bloody nobody.
---
Need to get on that GRIND my dude, you know getting that bread, straight husslin'.... But yeah start grinding mobs, I don't know which are most valuable for which level, but humanoids are always nice, or beast since you're a Skinner.
---
You‚Äôll be fine with what you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôre going to make a lot by 40 doing that. Just quest or grind mobs now with your strategy you have going. Avoid groups and dungeons cause a mob in this lvl can drop like 1-2 silver
---
A skull level means they are typically 10 levels or more above you i believe. And the higher level someone is the less likely a low lower level is able to hit them. This is through talents and the pure fact they are a higher level then you
---
I was doing the Yeti Hides in northern Feralas the other day and there were 2 warlocks and a priest doing the quest. I invited all 3 as I could skin for the hides and didn't need the drops. The priest declined, assuming he was basically done as he took off 1 min later. 1 lock accepted and 1 lock declined. The warlock that accepted and I started tagging mobs and the other guy tried running around stealing tags. We then ran very far ahead and I went bear and tagged 7-8 mobs at a time. He then whispered me all mad that we were tagging everything. I INVITED YOU, don't be mad that you are losing tags.
---
My guild has 19 players, and half of these are alts.
---
I guess I've screwed up big time.
---
If I reroll, what professions should I get that are ideal for making money?
---
If anyone gives advice I'd, be much appreciated, me and my friend have been leveling together, both level 31, I have 2g he has 30g, says hes just been censoring and selling the odd item on AH, could be that as a restorative shaman I have more skills to buy? I dont buy the ones i dont need such as rockbiter etc
---
So many memes, love it!
---
This. By 35 you can have 300 fishing, then it's not that hard getting the 100 gold really.
---
I saw that someone placed a few campfires on the SW fountain and that lit up part of the statue red.
---
I'm personally bot hoping that the classic is a seperate timeline and universe than retail wow. That is..the events in retail over time will not occurr in classic. 
---
Classic should have its own original expansions. Perhaps its own new lands even. 
---
How about after all the phases are done we don't have The Burning Crusade at all. We could get something entirely new.
---
warlocks are the cool edgy goth kids smoking under the bleachers
---
Do you have any such guides? 
---
The only ones I can find that go into detail of Rockbiter vs Windfury are for TBC onwards. Every one of the "classic guides" I have found seem to be based on feelings and none have any concrete math on why one over the other. They all say conflicting things as well and half say Windfury for slow weapons, and others say Windfury for fast weapons.
---
Then there are the heretics who say Flametongue and should be shunned. Any potential damage increase from Flametongue, which anecdotally I see none with a dagger, gets eaten up by the addition of resist chance on top of the already present miss/dodge/parry RNG.
---
Well u might gain some time but I think that in the long run its much better to just conjure to save gold
---
Looks like you need to relax.
---
I am with you except for the annoying "PSA" part. They're everywhere on this sub. I have PTSD now

He kept cheetah up and got dazed, indeed a big ape
---
Stop being stupid. The chest literally spawns every 3 hours and there is at least 1 person at the arena almost every time. It would be looted before you could find another layer to hop into.
---
I got mine without needing to ever layer hop. It's easy enough if you're good or bring friends.
---
I was doing my verigan'sfist quest on my paladin and got an invite from a guildie who remembered i needed SFK for the quest, there i found a lvl27 paladin who was doing the quest also, he need SFK and the ore in loch modan, i need SFK and the orb in ashenvale, since the ore and orb are both soloable, when we finished the instance we went on to do our final steps solo, when i came back to IF to receive my reward, there he was arriving at the same time to receive the hammer with me, we didn't chat inbetween, was a good coincidence and very pleasant, showing your actions/attitude may comeback to reward you or bite since the people you play are there as long as they stay on the game.
---
Spoilers: they will.
---
 You're probably honestly on track. Remember as you level up each level takes longer, higher level mobs drop more money, and items / skins vendor for more. 
---
At 40 I had about 100g, got my mount and stuff, and now at 47 I already have 100 gold again from same old same old skinning and vendoring
---
You are literally the first person I‚Äôve ever seen saying that Desolace is a flaw.
---
Which realme are you on out of interest?
---
Time to reroll?
---
And how did it go?
---
Really felt it in the starter area, when a like 17 guy was running around tagging all my quest mobs so I couldnt do my quest.
---
Really felt the love.
---
My dude, look at your comment history, you're going around swearing up and down that what you're doing isn't annoying as fuck, yet everyone here is basically telling you how fucking annoying you and your spam are. Get a clue.
---
But on my screen, the Jedi are evil!
---
Arrogance is the true sign of a fool.
---
Then why did they get greedy and ruin it?
---
Golemagg EU. Gonna change to a low pop. The queue is aiiiids
---
Mages are the fastest levels because of their ability to AoE farm, and they make their own food, and can port around the world easily...
---
Hunters and warlocks are close seconds because their pets allow them solo a lot of mobs and quests others need groups for.
---
I love gnomeregan
---
SM should've just been 1-2 dungeons, honestly. It would've been such an epic dungeon with lots of side rooms
---
The way I look at it is. We chose pvp, idc if you're lvl 1. I'm killing every alliance I see. I have no honor.
---
If you aren't in my guild or group it's 10s a stack. I get hate messages for that but I do not care.
---
Go to Desolace instead.
---
First go to Ironforge, to the hall of explorers, and get a quest from a dwarf that tells you to go to Desolace.
---
The quests there are alright, there's mobs to grind everywhere, and not a lot of players.
---
There are some good rewards too, like a stamina neck.
---
The main issue is that some quests are far away and you'll be walking a lot, but that shouldn't be bad if you just kill stuff in the way for exp.
---
There are several goblins around the place that give you decent quests too, get Questie if you need to.
---
And not just the yemen, but the yewomen and the yeldren, too.
---
Don't heal them. I'm a Warlock and I don't want people to heal my life tap for me all the time. Part of playing Warlock is managing your health and mana balance, and I generally tend to sit myself at 50% or so on purpose. As a healer, have the confidence to let your DPS sit at half health more often.
---
TBC+ Would have to completely change the badge system and IoQ, or else the entire game progression is hit 70 &gt; spam mgt/hmgt &gt; sunwell trash &gt; SW
---
Savage beef
---
How is the talent Tree something good? All classes have 1-3 meta specs and you do not really use anything else if you do not want to gimp your dps.
---
You answered your own question. Orc &gt; Undead &gt; Troll, but you have to choose what you like.
---
I'm an absolute noob to the game and casual to the bone so I'm the least knowledgable person to ask, sorry! :)
---
I've searched in the shop but the character transfer is only available for retail wow and unusable in classic. So I fear you'd have to start over.
---
https://i.imgur.com/5YFmlsk.gif
---
You are so wrong that I had to puke 3 times after reading this.
---
One of my absolute main reasons for loving classic is the danger. I think in retail characters have so many get out of jail free cards but in classic if you're soloing and you make a bad pull and get quite a few mobs you're in trouble and only certain classes are able to get away from that situation. 
---
The sheer size of the world (yes it's the same as retail size but no flying and only walking until 40+ makes it feel absolutely huge), the sense of danger, the way quests simply tell you "head north... ish..." instead of giving you a mark on the map and hud. 
---
And then there's the perfect drip feed of pretty much everything from talent points to gear upgrades and class abilities, you're always just about an hour ish away from new cool stuff. 
---
Honestly I can go on and on but we all know why we love Classic.
---
If someone asks me for water I‚Äôll put it in the trade box, if they confirm and there‚Äôs no tip I just cancel and go on with my day.
---
Ok but you take the picture while playing wow so just do a screenshot.
---
In my opinion they should leave classic as it is, and give people what they want in the next WoW expansion, which would be harder base content, class identity, more talents in the tree (Every 5 levels would be awesome if they reduce the level cap to 80 or so) and meaningful professions. As much as I like classic, the 14 years of QoL improvements in retail are very nice, they just took things in the wrong direction and catered too heavily to the casuals. Oh, and make LFR a .5 tier with good blue gear.
---
DrSpock I hope you enjoyed your 1 water I gave you for not tipping
---
If you can‚Äôt see this pic you can‚Äôt see shit in general
---
I feel like there is less to do, for me in a good way. Retail has 100 different things going on at once, it's 14 years of accumulated stuff and if you missed that expansion you're just playing catch up the whole time.
---
Classic is a restart. Simple, straightforward goals, couple professions, and that's about it. I like this because it's not overwhelming and I feel like I can experience all the content eventually.
---
by skins I mean leathers
---
the low 'scraps' are used by leatherworkers to turn into light leather
---
but not really sellable on AH its just too cheap
---
Wowhead leveling guides should have links to relevant trainers in the first section.
---
it wrecks dire maul
---
Change A to strafe left and D to strafe right. 
---
This enables you to hold town right click and turn the camera and the character at the same time.
---
If it's done in game through the macro functionality then you're fine. It's just that *outside* scripts that automate things are not allowed.
---
Can confirm this one works most of the time:
---
#showtooltip Freezing Trap
---
/petpassive
---
/cast [combat] Feign Death
---
/cast Freezing Trap
---
You can always have skinning and herbalism/mining. 
---
I prefer herbalism over mining because in my experience herbs are needed more frequently as ores.
---
Don't forget to learn fishing too, not much money in it now but it will be in the next few months.
---
So you could level now with skinning and herbalism and at 60 you drop skinning for alchemy and your are set up pretty well to make money in the long term. Especially if you can fish too.
---
Classic is challenging for all tank capable classes 
---
Warriors build threat slow on multiple mobs 
---
Druid got fewer tools 
---
Paladin doesn‚Äôt have a taunt.  
---
As a lock fear tanking is amazing fun when it comes to dunegones.  
---
I love seeing the tank running after him even after stating I deal with circle....
---
(Fear and prepare to remove fear if it‚Äôs about to pull adds).  I can fear tank one mob just let me.  
---
Dot,dot,dot,dot fear, ... rinse/repeat

I find AoE farming as a mage to be so much fun and amazing but one small fuck up and I can easily find myself corpse running and trust me there has been a few corpse runs. But that is my preferred play style. Mages are better with bigger groups but I've no doubt you'd out pace one when targeting in singles.
---
German, the literal translation from the German word for Spirit "Willenskraft" ist literally willpower.
---
The dungeons are infinitely better than classic in gameplay, but yes the Badges are a huge problem as is the entire IoQ patch.
---
Be perfect if it were a volcano
---
Then you still wait for the party to corpse run.
---
Is that different from what I said?
---
How much you willing to pay
---
I have less time to play these days, don't want to spend entire sessions just walking from place to the next
---
New to posting on reddit didnt know I needed to add  "flare" to post in here so i reposted it. Relax my dude.
---
Great response.  /s
---
NSFW: Booty Bay
---
Mages are AOE beasts, but that's about it. And let's not talk about the downtimes you have because you're constantly drinking. They also need a bit more attention while playing because they're so squishy and should not take too many hits. There's pros and cons about every class.
---
Hunters can go on for a really long time and barely have issues getting their stuff done due to the pets, so they're really well suited for solo content/leveling. Funny enough, I was thinking about switching back to my (retail) mail hunter, because of the scenario you're describing. 
---
So in terms of being stronger, yeah, mages have a ton of burst and damage, but run out of fuel rather quickly. What defines a strong class for you? Hunters have a ton of tools and survivability.
---
Take my Gold my dear **dungeon master** !
---
Your English is amazing.
---
I like to give my priest 10-20 water and ask for 100% renew uptime for faster clear. I'll tap with a renew and bandage if needed while my priest is drinking for the next pull. When the priest is ready the tank is the priority and somewhere in there I hope for another renew. I'll only eat/drink when both health and mana are &lt;10% and my priest is OOM.
---
Deviate Fish (especially if you are alliance), and Stonescale Eels always sell good. And you can fish up all kind of riches from wreckages.
---
You're only going to hear the negatives here. That's just the nature of forums in general... people having a good time are doing just that: having a good time. They're not going to stop having a good time to go post about said good time (with exceptions of course). People having a bad time are going to stop having their bad time and run to tell anyone who will listen.
---
Weak auras?
---
only problem with it is that it is hard to navigate for new people and tanks have to know what to do - else its really not that bad and I really enjoy it - there are worse dungeons in vanilla like ST f.e.
---
Works just fine for me.
---
Sorry off topic fellow player but curious if you have an estimate on benediction horde/alliance ratio.   I hope you get the recipe.
---
This 1001%
---
That's a back slash.
---
&gt; Tigers fury is not worth using unless you are at 100 energy
---
and just before a 5 pt ferioucios bite right? the duration is so short i couldnt imagine using TF to anything else but add some extra dmg to finishers?
---
Its macros and its not bannable. if im not wrong its pretty simple macro
---
/cast -name of stance-
---
/equip -wep name- 
---
/cast overpower 
---
im shit at macro writing but something like this
---
Also you were enchanting lower levels where mats are way cheaper and wallets are alot thinner. Plus like someone said no one wants those enchants 2 badly since they will be replaced soon.
---
Lmao!
---
Okay. But that still does not really clarify how it interacts with different abilities.
---
What I think I figured is:
---
Auto-attacks benefit fully.
---
Claw benefits fully.
---
Rake doesn't seem to befit at all.
---
So the question remaining is how it interacts with shred. Do I get the 10 multiplied with the 225% of the base-attack or is the 10 added after the multiplication with the base?
---
Alllll daaaayyyyyy
---
Am I seeing this right ? Alliance is taking hold of the ship in booty bay?
---
he says in a post with the picture of a warlock.
---
So many mages really don't think logically while AoE grinding. Super easy solution to this:
---
Their doing quests. You can kill full mobs. You can finish their quest in like two seconds and then they leave. Everyone wins. 
---
I've had such a pleasant experience doing this. I get to help people that have been genuinely very grateful about it and they leave my swamp.
---
&gt;'m just excited to play an old-style MMO (slower deliberate play, more focused pulls, mana management, talent trees, etc)
---
The problem with this, that some people don't seem to see yet as they aren't high enough level is that in 2019, all this is wiped. Everything is 2h tanked and cleaved down just like Retail due to power creep and new metas.
---
If he wouldn‚Äôt have done what he has done by the end, I‚Äòd have considered it. Also, he blocked me, so he doesn‚Äôt want to hear from me either way.
---
thanks!
---
not that I know of, but Spy provides the list of nearby players that hit the combat log. It won't flag any enemy buffs/debuffs though. 
---
technically its against the idea of the mechanics, since this info is only REALLY supposed to be available for mages using detect magic, since enemy buff/debuff info is usually 'hidden' (mage's detect magic exception) all addons do is give a guess, ELVUI has a feature to see buffs/debuffs, but again, only really for any applied by you or your party.
---
So if you are in a 5 man group, does the warrior take healer loot or priest take warrior loot ?
---
Thats just plain fucking idiotic claim.
---
Same here. I was 90% sure I was going to roll a Mage for portals between cities until Classic released. I think I was like level 3 on my Mage and said nah not feeling it, logged out and made a priest. I love healing and have been a priest for years on retail. Don't regret my decision so far.
---
Because they cant make a new expansion without throwing out whatever good thing the previous one did.
---
oh look, top dmg top lvling class is complaining it needs to use other spells than blizzard
---
Honestly, I would love to hang out at TB, but orgrimmar is just more convenient because of the zeppelin.
---
Thanks, that clarifies a lot. :)
---
&gt; Our desires were met like 99%
---
I'd say a hard 70%.
---
I swapped out of that on the first day.
---
I went Stonespine instead.
---
did you see the priest just under the map running away?
---
Can i hire him to teach you about the Print Screen button?
---
So, here's my two cents.
---
What not to do: Don't delete your 39 Gnome... You'll regret it, one day. 
---
Taking a Troll as a Rogue is not a mistake if you're not trying to minmax anyway. Pick something you're comfortable looking at for the next 60 levels. It's going to be a while.
---
As for the zones, just go where the quests take you - Do your green / yellow quests and go back to the zones to do the orange ones later. You're probably going to do the Durotar -&gt; Barrens / Ashenvale / Stonetalon route. 
---
And most of all, don't worry too much. Just enjoy the experience, you'll be fine.
---
I'd actually posit that STV is Ashevale 2 if only by virtue of the number of times a melded Nelf Hunter will kill you.
---
Forced name changes are already happening. I know this for a fact because I recieved a 24-hour suspension for naming violations. (Not on RP servers, my name was admittedly inappropriate on a normal server)
---
Since the system is automated it just depends on people flagging it. I got like 17 levels without getting flagged for a rename, but after that first kick and stubbornly submitting the same name again, I was kicked two more times within the next hour or two. My guess is that once you've been flagged once, you're on short notice and it only takes a report or two to bring you down.
---
tl;dr: Report the names and encourage others to do the same. The system is working, but it doesn't act unless it's recieved a large batch of initial reports as a sort of natural buffer against one or two angry players reporting you to grief.
---
This is the classic forums.
---
You should try to post in the BFA forums instead.
---
Mages are super power creeped in 1.12 and that filtered down to all normies.
---
What level do quests start there?
---
Saving this one for later! 
---
 RemindMe! 4 hours
---
lol. You are like 1 and half week late, mate.
---
Sorry. Didn't see your question. Personally I'm going up feral taking primarily cat abilities. I don't really feel I have troubles sustaining myself in dungeons. I do like the threat talent. I stop when I get to faerie fire, then I take 5 in the restp talent for rage/energy when entering form, goes up in balance to take clearcast. And then I finish feral at the end. I don't find heart of the wild to be that good in comparison to the others. Especially when you don't have any good gear.
---
It adds X to your melee dmg. 
---
If you have access to shred its not as useful as you would think. Maybe use in your opener.
---
It does however interact with the +225% dmg of Shred. So your +10 for example would be +22.5 on a Shred. 
---
I only really use it while leveling as right now my claw does +27 dmg. So my +10 tigers fury will give me +60 dmg from the whites in the 6 seconds and an additional 10 for each claw I manage so out weighting the pure Claw damage. 
---
Once I get higher ill use it pre Ravage but await my energy before attacking.
---
Most people advance through the affliction tree during leveling. Theres not much you can do wrong here. I like to start putting points in improved corruption, with 5/5 it will be an instant cast.
---
Pally tanking isn't terrible, but its really really weak compared to warrior. Its also really unintuitive like your first 10 points need to go in Holy for conc just to get any aoe threat. You also never get a taunt so they aren't viable for a lot of raid content. The people behind the class design at this time were HUGE warrior fans and absolutely despised hybrid classes.
---
Well turns out the harsh weather effects and lighting had to be 'washed out' due to the cataclysm update. I guess I must have missed it.
---
&gt; As a warlock if everyone is drinking then I will too, but my uptime is much more important than a healers uptime when it comes to clearing a dungeon fast. A healer won't need to heal in the first 10 or so seconds of a pull, but I need to be doing damage so we can kill things faster. 
---
...That's not how healing or MP5 works.
---
You front-load HoTs to mitigate incoming damage at the start of a fight and then heal in bursts, trying to make the most of MP5.
---
Obviously it depends on the group, level and composition, but if the healer goes OOM the group wipes, if you go OOM it gets killed slower.
---
Feel free to Life Tap, but I won't compromise my uptime and ability to keep the tank (and so the rest of the group) alive to protect you from your (situational &amp; potential) idiocy.
---
All in all though it's best to just...you know...talk to your healer about it.
---
In PvE, you shouldn‚Äôt need to transform really, but in PVP, it‚Äôs a must. There‚Äôs few things more satisfying than being Resto and defending a node in Arathi Basin with a buddy. You stay stealthed as a cat and someone comes to attack. They think they‚Äôre 1v1 and then you NS+HT your friend and the enemy just cries. It‚Äôs fantastic.
---
What you mean? Professions still have level requirements
---
Not very long, I am terrible at it.   if it's BoE  I'll buy it  (I am good in making gold)  , if it's BoP  tough luck for me, I'll probably never get it.
---
I heard he charged all the way up from stranglethorn to save the mage.
---
If you don't like it then you don't have to do actually do it. I'm a mage and just hit 42. When I was around 31 or so I joined a SM library run because I wanted to get the quest done. Turned out to be a speed run/farm. I didn't run it it again after and decline if that's what it turns out to be. I'd rather take longer and do the real world quest grind than just stay in one dungeon repeatedly spamming it for a few levels before moving on to the next one.
---
No pls

Take it JUST FUCKING TAKE IT

The Hunter lifestyle ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Why so? It may be fun idea for bg. We would have so few of them

oh

&gt;There is a chance that i am wrong
---
wow, i can guarantee you, you are not world fist 300 at cooking
---
&gt; has all the amenities that Orgrimmar has
---
cries in engineer
---
As i understand it, it just adds the amount as straight weapon dmg.
---
I baffles my mind though how poor the ability is designed, not only does it only last 6 seconds and adds pitiful dmg but it also costs energy that make it completely mess up your rotation.
---
It should have been just like the rogues Blade Fluffy skill, an active buff with cool down, no energy cost, then at least it would be worth adding to your dmg instead of just never using it.
---
How come no lists have https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22234/mantle-of-lost-hope or https://classic.wowhead.com/item=22405/mantle-of-the-scarlet-crusade shoulders? Are those not available in phase 1?
---
Two peas in a pod, you and I.
---
I went at level 42 as a Shadow Priest. I'd recommend level 43 for anyone else because I did struggle a bit.
---
I like human casting animations
---
The pixels are burning my eyes.
---
What‚Äôs a good rotation for single target soloing? I think I‚Äôm doing it wrong. This is my first warrior and struggling a bit.
---
Yeah maybe for retail. This is classic for a reason.
---
You need them for BWL suppression room
---
The thing is, it's often correct to be in melee as a ranged, if you generated more threat, that would be the case way less often.
---
That's exactly what you're supposed to do as a warlock. Position yourself, your pet, and the mobs in a triangle with you nearly at max range let your pet take aggro by the time your pet is almost dead you'll take aggro and the mobs should be almost dead and you take almost no damage and don't need to resummon. So your life regens during pulls all you need is mana.
---
The music is depressing though
---
I really enjoyed my Vanilla WoW druid experience. Raiding is a bit boring and you might be able to raid with an ideal PvP spec but i got to Rank 11 with a 0/30/21 build. Great fun to play the flag carrier in WSG premades.
---
Nop, Rerolls werent part of Vanilla,  
---
so it wont be in there.
---
I guess they're specifying spellcleave because I've also seen people asking for melee cleave groups. Basically a lot of classes have AoE but they only want to bring specific setups.

I think that's a classic case of cognitive dissonance. You like to think about yourself and other "older" people as wise and mature and grown. Just because you like to think about yourself that way and therefore easily accept it as the reason why the players suddenly seem so friendly. A little bit narcissistic of you, isn't it? In my opinion old people can be just as nasty and frustrated as young people. 
---
I think the reason is simply that the game is much, much harder in many different way. You actually need to communicate to progress in a lot of situations, because a lot of tools are missing, too. No LfG tool. No dungeon group finder. And the named quest mobs take forever to respawn. So you are forced to look for groups manually and to adopt to the environment. You also no longer have instances of every zone or server pools, which means: most probably you will meat the other players again at some point, so people are not as anonymous as in the current version of wow. All of that makes it pretty hard if you are a dick, so people are forced to behave like normal human beings.

Doesn't work in a game tailored around group pvp scenarios.

They don't

you said you are not a roleplayer so why are you on a rp server?? you are part of the problem

This is what they tried recently in BFA, so level 110's could compete in fights against level 120's. All that happened was that you could make a 111 twink with legendaries that was vastly superior to the 120 to the point of having 111 group's going around and ganking max level players.

Or start with going demo intim you have 2/2 imp. voidwalker mate, then go affli
---
Don't heal em. If there is a lock in the party I rarely heal them. In or out of combat. If the lock taps down to nothing and the tank starts a pull, 100% their fault if they died from splash damage. At most ill put a rejuv on them and call it a day.
---
PSA to the healers here. 99% of the time, warlocks health is not your problem. Ignore them completely, or drop a simple HoT and move on. They can regen health many ways, let them do that.
---
I'll give it a shot, thx
---
Yeah true... that is the sad part.
---
Of course you could try and collect different feral pieces of gear from dungeons and raids but rouges won‚Äôt be happy you steal their loot and in the end you still do less damage than them. Even with better gear :D
---
I know that I‚Äôll be playing resto at 60. I knew that when I decided to play Druid.

Still sounds like a lot of fun for me to run the flag in warsong though. That is enough for me to be worth it üòÅ
---
Also I dont mind healing
---
Retail has night elf mages? What's next undead druids? That game has gone to shit.
---
This still happens in 2019 ?! That's the trashiest thing you can do, i heard of people doing this back in catalysm, where people would do dungeons and need on everything, then kick you out if you complained.
---
They are very much not the cool kids. I can understand that back in the day, you could look up to them as they knew what they were doing, but they're being elitist assholes. They're the type to ask people to do Deadmines level 24+ because the idea of running into trouble or even in your case just not being as fast as possible is painful to them. I thought these type of people were kept locked away in retail where they can ask you to link curve for mythic azshara and will quit at the first wipe.

Having had to do a lot of pet control recently on retail, the "move to" pet command is one of the biggest things I miss in Classic. Especially since pet control is more important with there not being an assist stance.
---
Your options are that your pet is there for decoration, it isn't there, or you have to trust pet ai developed in the early 2000s.
---
Thank you very much!
---
New people, new name for things. Kinda like new terms that evolve all the time. Im sticking to AoE
---
As the comments below mention, let them take their chances in retail to do something like that. Plus, it doesn't fit the lore at all.
---
With all that time spent in the water, you do not have to be afraid of murlocks. They'll accept you as one of them and offer to live there, so you basically become a murlock. I've lost couple of my chars because of that.
---
I'm actually more immerged in leveling up my goddamn blacksmithing and other professions than questing. 
---
Last night I hit 150 in cooking and fishing, 141 in first aid, and I think removing the cap is going to decimate my savings.
---
I'm trying to remember, I can't think of anything like that in the plaguelands besides the normal bones and such strewn about. The only other thing I know of is in the centaur camps they sometimes have a centaur rug.
---
as a dungeon master i don‚Äôt
---
I appreciate you!
---
It will be when more players are higher level. In the beginning SW is capital because it is near most of the leveling zones.
---
Wowhead has some decent guides. Generally I'd advise getting Corruption upgraded to instant cast and then sticking with Affliction for a good while. It has several options that help with resouse management (always nice when levelling) and makes you better at doting up targets, but the exact build can vary.
---
My mouse will randomly jump sometimes and look upwards and I‚Äôll have to adjust it. Idk what causes it. Cheap mouse? Glitch in the Matrix?
---
Fore the record, it's not uncommon for Resotration/Elemental Shamans, Holy Paladins, and Restoration/balance druids to wear cloth at lower levels due to itemization and stats. Not saying that's what happened because it was probably some enhance shammy being dumb but you have to remember in classic wearing a less armor type is going to happen at times because that's just how the loot was.
---
Because new doesn‚Äôt mean better.
---
And you have to actually go there! I know its inconvenient, but for some reason it really adds to the game that we actually have to go to places instead of just instantly being teleported.
---
Right after wotlk when Ion came on board and everything shifted to hard core reading as the top priority.
---
Priests have an ability called Mind Control that, when used on a player of the opposing faction, gives the priest control of their character and also makes that player friendly to the priest‚Äôs faction and hostile to the actual players faction.
---
The thing about OSRS is they can add (95% of the time) new content without blasting the old one. What happens when there is T4/T5 in Classic+ or some sort of welfare/catchup that trivializes early stuff?
---
I feel like an adventure traveling through a world in classic. Not the saviour of the world in a cinematic and the next minute out collecting 10 merloc dicks for no reason.
---
Nah, it's not the keyboard. Check my comment above. It's just that moving forward and shift-T doesn't work for me for some reason.
---
Thx for that guide.
---
Should have checked out Black Morass while you were there. It's on the map.
---
I was picking mageroyal before i left teld tbh.
---
get told son
---
I‚Äôm usually with you.... but there are some exceptions.
---
We as a community are on the cusp of improving classic WoW and making it a title where the devs wanted it to be, new bg's new minigames, new dungeons and raids. A battle royale mode would bring in the new generation of kids like me that can't stop playing those games bit love mmorpg.

Started an undead rogue alt the other day and met a warlock in the starting zone. We were on the same quest so we teamed up and just stayed together for over an hour til he had to log off. Didn't agree to or anything, we just did it

Looks like he doesn't learn the attacks he can do without
---
As soon as I join the group they start begging for water

Could have dropped a few gold and just gone out and bought it

But now they got a mage, so you know that noone brought it

It's a good thing I got two full bag spaces allotted
---
Prot pal needs taunt.  Boomkin needs to exist.  Enhancement shaman needs to decide if it's a tank or not. They can make the game so much better without making it "unclassic"
---
I was running along a river in Ashenvale as I approached my destination I came across a fallen tree forming a path across this small river. It had so obviously been deliberately placed yet seemed so natural. It suddenly dawned on me the true scope of effort that went into making this amazing game. It hardly feels like anything is copy paste, everything feels very deliberate and natural all in one.
---
I partied with a random gnome yesterday and said about the same thing to him but it‚Äôs actually my first time playing WOW at all. I‚Äôm a big d and d player and that‚Äôs exactly what it feels like, there‚Äôs a ton of times I just pop into the taverns after a long questing day, grab an ale and just soak in the atmosphere q

well of course not. There is only one serious contender for the position of Warchief.

Welcome to the community. Quite enjoyed reading this post. Its always interesting to see how the game feels to newcomers. I'm a 15 year vet, was there from the beginning and even now, nothing compared to the feeling of classic. I've come to despise retail, and quit just a few months after BFA launched. 
---
I'm incredibly happy with how classic has worked out and although i expected it to do well, i never thought it would become this popular and attract such a huge 'first time' audience.
---
I'd guess if you know how to use distract then it's still doable but you'll have to maybe be more careful and move slower.
---
Your friend found that on Reddit
---
I'd rather do the corpseruns than go through that. Wotlk is when Prot became extremely good for leveling, not before.

Skinning a bear should aggro every bears

in a 40 yard radius. It makes sense, you are actually skinning their best friend.
---
I made a macro for this on my undead warlock and when he does the jumping part of his dance it looks look I have some sick casting animation.
---
Another PSA: you're allowed to tap when I'm at full mana. So many warlocks run out of mana and start wanding instead of tapping a few times and killing the mobs with actual spells.
---
Thanks ill change to Warlock I think. I wanted something that is fun for Pvp too
---
All good I was confused, I never disagreed. I definitely don't feel obliged to give people conjured food/water that demand it. They can kick rocks until they learn to be more polite.

Go drain tank build.

Dive's Drain Tanking Guide for Warlock Leveling in WoW: Classic, and other classic warlock resources.   https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ccxosl/dives_drain_tanking_guide_for_warlock_leveling_in/
---
Voidwalker leveling is a struggle and you have to really juggle your threat the entire time and hold back and really have to juggle multiple mobs as well. I much preferred drain tanking personally.
---
I also had a nice encounter with a rogue, this time in arathi tough. Fucker was 10+ levels above me and everytime he killed me he spammed go to retail and nigg*r in chat, real wholesome experience.
---
Good thing share holders don't care about shit opinions like this.
---
Ha! You got it. Forgot that was the name of the thing though, so thanks!
---
I managed to hit 40 yesterday with 95 gold. As everybody tells you, loot and sell everything. 
---
Skinning helped me by 10 gold I would guess - also, I didn't buy any skill from level 32 to 40.
---
To be fair, this wasn't a secret 15 years ago.
---
Tribal is the way to go for me, you can craft your BiS Helmet plus the Devilsaur set later on.

Unbiased comment here..

I think you're taking this game way too serious.

And don't wear armor so you don't have any repair bills if you mess up
---
Had this bug too.

Found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9gzg8q/if_your_mouse_sensitivity_goes_high_randomly_to/) thread on reddit.

For me, disabling the nvidia overlay and task-killing RazerIngameEngine fixed it.
---
Essential artifacts is worse. The tank and healer are busy with 3 robo chickens and a crowd of mechanics, and the DPS are all racing to get to the stupid boxes first.
---
The orcs once cultivated a noble, shamanistic society on Draenor. Tragically, the proud orc clans were corrupted by the Green New Deal and used as pawns in the Democrat's invasion of Azeroth.

Mind:Blown.

Haha! I am going to do this for an hour or so today üòÑ

What about anonymous love letters?

Spirit is useless on shamans. The mana/health regen ticks off only after you spend 5 seconds without casting spells. That means totems too. Since you're using both spells and rely on melee, you need to stack either stamina and intellect for the sustain or strength and intellect for maximum damage output. What shamans are reliant on, is the mana per 5 seconds gear. But that's later on when you work on getting your prebis, since there's virtually no low lvl gear that gives mp5. So while you're leveling look out for that gear that ends either on "...of the gorilla" (strength + int), or "...of the eagle" (stam + int). Also be on a lookout for gear with + nature damage.
---
Ahead of the curve, link or be kicked bro
---
At the end when you are showing your gear, something is modifying the tooltip to show how many of each item you have, which character has it, and where it is located (equipped).  
---
What addon is that?
---
Why can't you just let a good thing be a good thing? Why do people feel it needs "improving"?

It's already perfect, leave it.

don't worry, you will make more at lvl 36-40 than lvl 1-35 combined

Me and my brother recently got an invite from a guild. But was a script so in no time it had over a hundred members. Many people wanted to leave but didn't know how. So some of us advised altF4 and many went offline. It's childish but for most of us it was fun xD
---
People sleeping on this comments
---
I've thought about this too for my own server, but it turns out there's already a ton of servers for pretty much every server. I went through all the work of setting up channels, roles and bots, and while I was promoting my own Discord server I got told by a random forum member that they already had a Discord with over 500 people on it. 
---
So before you do anything, I'd suggest trying to Google and/or look through your realm forums, because by now most servers have at least one server.

Worse is getting a new rank and it not recovering even half your mana bar lol. I think I'll just start buying drinks soon.

How long do player skeletons stay on the ground?
---
Retail isn't a train wreck though...so...stop thinking you wouldn't like tobsee new content
---
As a mage who runs with a lot of spell cleave groups, I agree with this sentiment, however I do not believe the warlocks to be to blame for this mentality.
---
In almost every group I have run with, even as a mage, people do NOT give me enough time for mana between pulls. One round of buffs, and I am OOM guys. Had to conjure more food/water? I'm OOM. Was it a big AOE pull? I'm also OOM. They keep pulling, even when I say I need mana.
---
So, I've interpreted this as "We want to keep pulling, and aren't worried about good dps", so I will just wand on pulls of 1-2, and conserve my mana for 3+ packs.
---
A big part of playing Classic is managing your mana and your threat, so sometimes that means throttling yourself in the interest of saving mana or not pulling aggro.
---
I think once people start doing higher level content, they will start to slow down and replenish between pulls. I hope so, because I'm in a constant state of anxiety about whether or not I have enough mana to carry my group through a bad pull and still survive it.
---

How dare you insult my polar bear named Cat!

Try using your succubus. My succubus was doing better dps and holding threat better then my void for a bit. When i got rank 3 torment for my void he started doing much better though. Also improved voidwalker becomes almost necessary for your void to be able to hold aggro. Since there is very little spell dmg gear around lvl 30 your spells start to do scale back a bit compared to mob health. Highly recommend buying spell dmg gear from the auction house since you don‚Äôt have to buy a mount. Tailors can make a full set of low lvl spell dmg gear (forget what it‚Äôs called).

Darkest Dungeon! Really fun game with the best quotes of any game I have ever encountered.  Not sure how to describe the genre though, but I would recommend checking it out, it's a fun game to sink some time into!
---
By questing? How good are dungeons for money? I don't want to farm dungeons, I like questing. I'll definitely be sure to get a good few in though.
---
&gt;That's true of anything
---
Nah, some places like RFD just suck, getting into the instance sucks, fighting the mobs sucks, and even when you know the shurtcut it still sucks.
---
Hard to type with a broken keyboard
---
Rofl like the 2 buttons every dps class have in classic are so much better. Yeah man, press frostbolt every 2 seconds is super interesting. Every dungeon before is being AoE farmed right now, even UBRS. There might be more depth to the game but it is no way complicated when it comes to raids/dungeons. BC heroics had more complicated mechanics than classic does.

Have you tried something like Gu√Øde? or Gu√Æde etc...?
---
Oh, well you're a little low for shimmering flats, I wouldn't go there until closer to 32 or 33.
---
3 Sunders and then pool rage for the next mob. You can then sunder quicker and throw in a HS or pool again to get 3+ sunders quicker.
---
While I don't *super* agree with the guy saying "L2P noob" I definitely don't agree with you blaming your group's shortcomings on "poor design". If you saw a group of 5 dudes massacre their way through a tunnel on their way to your boss you'd try to do something about it, and grab all your buddies on the way to help. That's what leads to the mass of mobs on their way to you. I think it's great design. Makes you have to stick to the wall and stay out of sight from the mobs on the lower level and actually think about your positioning instead of running through every pack of mobs without consequence.
---
So much this! As a warlock I never want to get more than renew on me. Sure if I pull agro on boss with a few sick shadowbolts or get the whole aoe pack on me while using hellfire I will need some heals but under normal circumstances just keep that renew up and I'm a very happy gnome, don't waste those big heals on me I got it under control.
---
Vael and Chrom are gear gate keepers. The average "good" players who haven't gotten enough gear out of MC and Ony are not going to have an easy time with these fights. It doesn't matter how good a player is, you wont get past them with a majority of the raid in sub par gear. I cant wait to see how BWL goes for the average raiders because I'm not saying its difficult, just has gear requirements that people are looking past thinking it doesnt pertain to them.
---
As for how fast it is cleared, I already said this before, no one should care that the content gets cleared within the first day or even hours. The people doing that are the insanely small minority of players who have been playing private servers for a decade or are hardcore raiders, both of which will be nearly fully decked out in MC and Ony depending on luck of drops. The average "good" player you talk about will get as far as their raid's gear allows. This 1.12 talents help make things easier to a point, but you talk about them like they are this almighty cheat code. The 1.12 benefits will be way less noticable in BWL and when we get to AQ, even less to negligible.
---
Good news dear Mages, you can also make portals!
---
Nah
---
I was in your guild until I transferred yesterday. The queues and the amount of people were just too much for me :( Wish you luck on your leveling!

But then they made 25 people beating illidan cannon at BT

Nothing is perfect
---
Just don't buff might, every paladin buffs me might.. It's melee only
---
The main difference is here - in classic, your gear won't lose value. When a new phase releases in classic, the gear from before will still be the same, you just get another tier on top of the existing content. The "old" gear keeps it's value, because you still need it (partially) to be able to do the follow up content. 
---
If you look at retail, since Legion introduced the PvE Seasons, any progression to your character from the last season simply didn't matter. WQ reward levels are increased, dungeon drop levels are increased, it's all starting at 0 again (figuratively). While this is helpful for player who just joined or were away for a few months, it simply feels horrible. Except for visuals maybe, there is no point in even looking at Battle for Dazaralor anymore.
---
Just let them die
---
I also play a priest so im saying this from a healer perspective, but its fine for the group to start pulling while im drinking, I dont need to have full mana at the start of a pull. When the tank needs a heal I stop drinking and throw my biggest heal+renew. Not every party member needs a renew and/or shield every pull. 
---
Healer mantality is so often that you are the most important member of the party and everyone should adapt to your pace. I think healers are there to support the group and its my job as a healer to keep up and keep them alive. Anything the makes the dungeon faster, even at my expense, is always worth it imo.
---
Not to mention when OP mentioned to get them to execute range. Like what in the world?!?..waste all my precious rage on a execute, that most like will do LESS damage than a HS (or AA), use ALL of my rage AND most likely overkill by a lot if it does kill in the first place? Yeah, no thanks, OP.

When the proc occurs, the is an animation and when the animation is over then my character proceeds to auto attack. Is that bow actually bad because of this or ?

---
most classes do have a few 'best' talent specs, but only min maxers really need to follow those.  They always have several good-but-not-great alternatives players can explore
---
I usually joke "warlocks, converting healer mana into their own". I don't mind so much, like the rest of the fps they aren't at the top of the healing priority. I'd happily let a lock sit at low health if I think I need the mana to keep the tank alive.
---
I find that most server Discords are posted on the official forums for that server. I don't think there is a list here as there were several Discords for some servers.
---
I do agree, its fucking awful.
---
It sounds like you're talking about something else entirely. The way I read it, they're thinking about how the zone designers used to design a world that just happened to have quests in it, and now they're building quest hubs before the actual zone is finished with little regard to world building and other RPG elements.
---
This has been going on for several expansions, I remember reading an interview during or before Legion where they said this was an official change of direction. Immersion isn't what they're going for, and players who don't want their questing experience and outdoor content to feel like it's on rails dislike it. The people speed-leveling in dungeons probably aren't it, though.
---
Mythic Plus is a great example of something that is arguably difficult (on higher levels) and yet feels entirely out of place since it more closely resembles a Diablo 3 Greater Rift than a WoW Classic dungeon, which isn't because of the difficulty.
---
Imagine playing on a pre server and claiming the horde has kept alliance away.
---
I dare to say legion had the best post level cap stories. The whole suramar experience 10/10
---
That's true, I got confused. By making the enemy parry more, he's hitting you more often, which means more rage and more damage throughput from using BT or even HS/Cleave more often.
---
Really?  I have never had Internet on a cross-Pacific flight and I fly Hawaii to mainland pretty regularly.  Very interesting to see

hahahha poor woman
---
Stop healing us so much, we don't expect you to heal us to full between pulls. If I life tap after a mob then I'm going to heal myself with bandages/food anyway. I have more mana than health so it's quicker to life tap and eat than it is to drink. 
---
I tell healers this in every single dungeon I run and half of them still get mad at me when I'm life tapping - just don't worry about it, I promise I don't expect you to!
---
That's just Auctioneer... I think I disabled the Enchantrix portion.
---
The bow is just something I got as a quest reward and had double the DPS of my gun, so finally switched over for the first time.  I was pretty surprised when I started to whack things with the quiver.
---
It's the same for all gathering profs.
---
Well. How are we going to help you with this?
---
If what you wrote above is true. Just tell Blizzard via their Support and you should have your account back (hopefully rather sooner than later) I hope the best for you.
---
There is nothing worst than neckbearding a game and then having to stop because of a ban or similar. While everyone else keeps going you are now forced to chill :/ Sorry about that.
---
But you could already have send a ticket to Blizzard or given them a call.
---
They have plenty of resources to tell you if you did something wrong, why you got banned, if it was a Manual or automatic ban and so on.
---
They will be able to help you better than us.

Thank You! It‚Äôs great so far

And you buy grimores as well as change spells in the action bar?

I think it's because the huge character models look like they're moving more slowly than the smaller races so you just don't feel hurried at all. Gnomes are the opposite, and it's because their tiny models give them crippling anxiety.
---
It was so cool. I remember checking the photo of the day religiously for months.
---
Hopefully you can get one then! üòÖ
---
Do you have a full list of your intended gear?
---
In a raid setting druid healers were desired for sure.  Probably not as much as priests, but more than paladins or shaman.
---
Coming from the IT side they probably had all specs in scope and got healing done first then dropped itemization/tweaking/talents when they ran out of time.
---
ie druids used to use only strength and not agility.   Hurricane was also crazy bad at the start.  
---
Cat druids were meh, but bear druids were used by several guilds high end guilds... although in my buddy's case he kept healing gear on him.
---
Faking no!
---
lmao
---
this!
---
&gt; and even then the level 1 toon is going to aggro so much shit
---
Agro more stuff to skin you mean! Level 1 multibox skinning alt confirmed as optimal farming!
---
It‚Äôs the kind of bug that is a feature to me.
---
Not bug...‚Äò‚Äòtis feature!
---
Sure, but at level 120, having no prior training in enchanting, you can just go right ahead and pick it up on a whim, followed by high level enchants shortly after. 
---
You want that "Enchant Weapon - Supreme Lightforge of the Titans" on your weapon man? Yeah no problem! Let me just drop alchemy temporarily, should have it on my next world quest.
---
Oh, don't worry about that I can always pick alch back up right where I left of. It's all under Kul'Tiran alchemy anyway.
---
Spam is usually when someone says something at least 4+ times in rapid succession. Posting something to you twice in a row isnt spam.
---
Double druid maybe, one heals and catweaves, the other bear.
---
So that's why no one wants to group with me.
---
Is there some sort of succint LFG message I can write that will convince people I turn off pet taunt, only roll on items with agility that I will actually use, and I use a threat meter so tank can keep aggro??
---
Perhaps, but it's not entirely wrong either. Retail WoW (for the past several expansions) has kept players hooked via constant goals - world quests, weekly caches, pushing M+, grinding just a little more AP, hunting toys/transmog, pet battles, whatever your thing is, there's virtually *always* something to do, which keeps people hooked - even the people who aren't 100% happy with the state of the game.
---
Classic doesn't have much of that. Yeah you have a lot of dungeons and gear farming to do, but very little incentive to go back to those places once you have the item(s) you want (which is specifically what M+/Titanforge/Socket was designed to combat, and as annoying as those systems can be, it's *worked*). Likewise, a lot of players won't feel incentivized to level up again, not because they don't want to try another class, but because of simply how long the leveling process is.
---
So especially without PvP out for awhile, unless these people happen to get into raiding quickly, they'll eventually start running out of content, and it will be interesting to see how many stick around in the long term because of it.
---
I know the game is from 2004 but this laughable attempt at not being racist doesn't need to be pulled from 2004 as well.
---
The announcer was the shit!!
---
Yeah you‚Äòre right it looked not that hard but then i did it on my own and i just couldn‚Äòt do it. 
---
That‚Äòs a good point that i‚Äòll miss out on much.
---
I think i‚Äòll just respec to single target.
---
Thanks for your reply!
---
Yeah... don't vendor them. Lots of people are altoholics that buy greens at 2x-3x vendor price. 
---
Also, a lot of warriors and rogues struggle to stay alive so they buy the best gear possible from the AH.
---
Don't sell greens to vendor unless you've cycled them once or twice on the AH.
---
Naming your pet is everything. Without a name they are nothing but macros. I've got a crockolis I've had since I could have a pet and called him Chompy.
---
Do you know the distance?
---
Is it 8yrds like hunters min distance?
---
Or make sure that you group so you don‚Äôt get your spawn stolen
---
The weapon dmg is what matters. Like a warri u normaly want a slow mh and a fast offhand, but if the dagger much better than yours (the dps)  equip it should work overall better
---
Tukui is worth a try as a package solution.
---
Most people on pvp servers do a lot of pve, the only difference between the two is that you can fight the enemy faction out in the world on a pvp server, you still need to do pve for gear etc. Close to all "top guilds" both pvp and pve play on pvp servers.
---
If you dislike open world pvp and don't want to participate, either of those 3 pve realms should be fine, they all seem to have about the same pop and all hit full during peak hours.
---
Yeah no worries. One good thing about Mage is that its just a super, all-round solid class - even when specced AoE its still a monster at Single Target while leveling. So don't feel like you are pressured into *having* to AoE farm just because you are specced into it. You can go and quest/dungeon perfectly fine until you are more comfortable with AoE leveling.
---
Warlock killed me on my druid for no reason I camped him for a hour some lessons are learned the hard way :)
---
ha, great video
---
The way I see it as the minimum requirement for playing on an RP server, you don't make references to real life or game mechanics (in /s and /y channels), because your character doesn't know about them.
---
For examples:
---
You don't say "Sorry, getting girlfriend aggro, gotta go."  Just say, "Sorry, gotta go."  
---
Don't say "I've been grinding these mobs for 3 hours, pserver server it dropped 1st kill."  Just say, "I've been killing these crocodiles for 3 hours and still haven't found it."  
---
Don't say "\[17\] Killing The Gnolls ??????????", say "Hey, need help?"
---
And again, it's literally only in /say and /yell, the places were a chat bubble appears over someone's head by default.  General chat, trade, LFG, etc, completely out of character.  Go find your group in lfg, chat OOC in party, whispers, guild... get shit done as efficiently as you want to.  But just keep /say and /yell in character.
---
I've been playing RP servers most of my MMO life so I might be a bit biased (have never joined a full on RP guild though) but it's SOOO easy to follow the minimum rules, which is why I think people get so pissed off with those who break them.
---
Or don't send me the invite and then weirdly send your copy and pasted message 5 minutes later. Why the gap? Why not (at least) the other way around?
---
Interesting to see that Blizzard is actually taking action against people that abuse the economy.  Will be more interesting to hear what the reasoning behind it is.
---
How typical this is the first thought of a rogue.
---
You know what people also shouldn't do? Create posts with ambiguous titles so you only know what the post is about once you're reading it.
---
King of similar to inviting people to guilds without telling them about it, don't you think?
---
Question, How is it an almost free mount?
---
With that Speed you want it to be your offhand dagger really...
---
Mainhand you want - as you said - a slower Dagger
---
Haha Dude. There is nothing to do with rage at those levels except spamming what you got. And if you replace HS with Sunder than you really need to rethink your whole damn game, bc brother you are doing it very wrong :)
---
I was thinking about this yesterday. I mean you can spot differences between every racial quest line, like quests given you by undeads are more gruesome lol
---
You probably sold some items for a unregularly high price to an account already flagged for botting, which was caught by their automated anti-cheat systems on the server.
---
This happened to me too, many years ago. Talk to the support, they were helpful and the case was resolved rather quickly. May take a few days atm, since the supportn still seems to work way over capacity.
---
You are a mage and you play classic and you don't use Cranius song for that video? :)
---
its a script to mass invite all guildless players. they 100% expect lots to decline or leave after accepting.
---
You can‚Äôt do raids, dungeons, bgs, islands, warfronts without rep? In classic all raids are locked behind quests and reputation is mandatory for enchants on your armor. What exactly are you comparing here?
---
i think this outfit needs a high res xD
---
Take the new pet into combat and have it keep using the abilities you want to learn. Like make it use that ability on cooldown by clicking the button for it. Before too long you should get a chat message saying you have learned that ability and now your hunter permanently knows that ability. To teach it to any pet that can learn it, you have to pull them out of your stable and open the pet training window, and you teach it directly to the pet yourself.
---
Yes ive jumped layers, its hard to avoid, most of the times when i join a grp it swaps your layer, i dont see how i can avoid that.
---
Sure exploiting layers is a great thing to do
---
We keep them around in case we fall short on ground beef
---
Description is spot on, I couldn't have said it any better!
---
I just wanted to add, for a 1D game with relatively simple graphics it is so damn immersive, something I've never seen before.. The quotes, the environment, the dungeons itself, the characters, the quirks and illnesses.. It actually makes you feel like you're in some medieval dungeon, and it really makes the game feel alive.
---
What? Why? I was thinking of chaning to bows.
---
You may want to try binding your more common spells to your keyboard rather than clicking. The earlier you start the more used to it you are by the time you hit end game.
---
You got TOLD.
---
Savage
---
Ive written them an appeal.
---
but you can buy bronze tubes in limited supply from the vendor right next to the quest.....  
---
And here I am selling hillman's cloakes for profit, just so someone can get that hillsbrad Quest done :)
---
id rather have a voidwalker to get smacked in the face than myself lol
---
Definitely agree. Damage can continue while I'm drinking, and sometimes combat can go by without me needing to get up from drinking at all.
---
When the group is working together well and your healer is working to use MP5 well there's almost no downtime for the healer.
---
In my experience with the few dungeon runs I've done there is a very thin line between "I'm helping us go faster" and a dead team.
---
While you're right in that anything that makes the group move faster and with less downtime is worth it, generally the ones that have the right knowledge to know the limits of what the group can take are the tank and the healer. And of the two the healer is most likely to be the one watching health and mana to know if they need to break to let people drink.
---
Where it comes into play is where Warlocks tap, thinking in a solo capacity, but (generally) the healer is likely to have a better sight on how vulnerable they are for the up coming fights (given the tank's aggro, the AoEs or cleaves in the fight etc.).
---
Don't get me wrong, I'll always throw a renew on a tapping 'lock because it's good mana value and I can probably deal with the small loss of mana, especially if I have the mana and I'm about to drink anyway.
---
As I said, just talk to each other, feel each other out and figure it out with your party.
---
Side-note: Personally my pet peeve is other healers panic-healing someone who dips below 50% health. While it's nice for the help, when I'm balancing and rationing my mana it throws my foresight for a loop to cancel my cast to prevent over-heal. It's really stupid, after all it means less mana cost for me, but still...
---
This is truly dope, but you're kinda like a dealer hooking people up with free crack.
---
Just wait til 40 and go ele it is much more consistent and you are a pvp beast. Make sure to get an int set
---
Tbf I've been doing this without master of deception and the only time I get spotted is when they resist my pick pocket. other than that I have had no problem. 
---
Granted I am lvl 40, but I did it at lvl 37 and it was fine as well.
---
Wowpop.appspot.com
---
Are you kidding? People were 300 cooking after 2-3 max.
---
the mount is like 40s i think, compared to around 100g for everyone else (bar paladin) then the lvl 60 mount is a quest chain (but you actually need a lot of time and expensive mats i think to get it)
---
Gurubashi Arena, problem solved. Seriously, you can form your own groups, host events and advertise some kind of reward for winning. You want battle royal or arena? Do it the vanilla way :) hope this helps!
---
This was one of the realest, rawest things I‚Äôve read in a long time. I have similar memories, and it is crazy where those memories will come up. Wow, driving by a specific building, hell... even smells can bring it up. It has taken years of therapy for me to admit something like ‚ÄúI miss you, but I am also very angry with you‚Äù. Kudos, brother. And keep your head up.
---
OSRS doesn't have Jagex waiting in the wings to fuck everything up by inevitably being forced to please the Activision shareholder overlords.
---
Back when I was in high school (around 2007-2008), I couldn‚Äôt play wow even though I really wanted to; mostly because I was afraid of asking my strict dad if I could use his credit card for the subscription. 
---
I would browse the wow website every once in a while and notice the screenshots. It seemed so fun seeing all these people on an adventure in a world I loved so much (from WC3) and it made me envious that I couldn‚Äôt be a part of that world.
---
As a fellow healing priest I personally don't really mind. More life taps = less drinking = more dps uptime = faster dungeon completion
---
Grouping with me? Life Tap and Funfire away, bois!
---
Honestly grouping with 3 locks casting hellfire everywhere is awesome. Never did a dungeon run as fast as that

no theres no monetary reward from blizzard for doing anything on classic
---
On horde at least it is literally free. You talk to your trainer who sends you to ratchet and then you earn it from turning in the quest.

What? What macro would that be?

I R8 8/8

I‚Äôm pretty sure I ganked a troll mage like that in the swamp of sorrows, farming whelps, middle of last week like 5 times in a row.
---
And then you hit 40 and suddenly buffing other players isn't an option anymore.
---
I remember the barrens being a slog but this time through I‚Äôve really enjoyed. It. I think we all got tired of it on the third alt through. This time I came late from silver pine, did the northern barrens, went back for silverpine elite quests and now I‚Äôm back for the southern barrens. Breaks up the brown pretty well. Keeps the quests green and yellow too to really let you burn them down.
---
I‚Äôm 40 and some ?? Undead mage kept finding me and killing me all night in the badlands until I finally just called it a night.
---
I had a lock in SM who was hellfiring into lifetap and got annoyed that I wasn't healing him..
---
To me, it began with patch 3.2. I hated that you could farm tier sets from 5 mans, which were a joke anyway. I hated that single room raid replaced Ulduar, prob best raid Blizz ever made. I hated that we needed a Deus Ex Machina moment to defeat Arthas. I long expected the fight would be hopeless for 25 adventurers.
---
Cata released and it began strong, I had high hopes. Then they nerfed heroics and released LFR. I quit immediately, havent touched the game  till May 2014. Had a lot of fun PvPing in MoP, I think class design was excellent. I did not do any PvE at all, 5 mans with rabbits and monkeys were puke inducing to me. I quit around September. I tried WoD, but it wasnt for me and I got bored quickly. I played maybe 2-3 months,doing PvP and old content for transmog etc. Havent touched PvE at all again. I quit around April 2015.
---
I started Legion just because I heard you could basically equip Frostmourne. I had a blast doing that artifact acquisition quest. Then I opened the artifact screen and saw basically a version of what I loved in past, the talent system. Then I tried M+ and was so happy to see that 5 mans were finally relevant again. I got hooked and played till the end. I think I read it in Reddit, someone summarized it masterfully: "Legion felt like an equally fun arcade mode of a game I was nostalgic for."
---
I loved Legion. Which makes me even more mad how they could have screwed up BfA so much coming from Legion.
---
That's kind of the point though, they want to unlock flying as a convenience to quickly move through areas in which you've already experienced all the content.
---
Not unlock flying so you can quickly skip over areas you haven't.
---
You know America has 327 million people, with over a dozen distinct cultural regions. So, what part of my comment was typical of Americans?
---
Are you Parisian? That is the only place I have been that I could stereotype where a major percentage of the people acted both rude and offended at the same time, over nothing.
---
Stop looking for offense where there is none.

Fuckin genius. I‚Äôm for sure doing this. I mean, I‚Äôm a thieving rogue, right? I‚Äôm engaging in my characters lore.

You lose ticks when you get hit. Make sure you have pw:s on yourself or are at range when you channel
---
Listen. I'm a simple man. I see skull, I insert stabbies. Not that hard.
---
As with all things in life: Communication is key. Talk to him about it. If they're just a dick who doesn't like that you're possibly better than them, then you've got to decide whether it's worth it to stay or move on. Not sure there's much we can do to make that decision for you.
---
Not meaning to sound derivative but it really feels like going into a world and being a part of it, instead of the world just revolving around you. It's something you just immerse yourself with and grow in.. every action feels like it sticks. 
---
And lord the pvp feels so much better/scrappier too.. feels like there's always a way to win even in the most dire situations.
---
Haha well spotted. Playing pve and going full faction pride on reddit. Someone's scared over here.
---
I'd say talk to the GM and if it doesn't help leave the guild
---
It's definitely not my cup of tea but I have to admit that it's final boss fights is awesome. Definitely up there with the end game boss fights in terms of utilizing an actual strategy.
---
I was 12 years old in Vanilla and had no idea wtf I was doing, where to quest, and I didn't like it. I leveled 2 characters to 60 only doing dungeons.
---
Confront him and ask what his problem is.
---
This one is kind of on blizz tbf. A lot of the time it's just people trying to get any 10 people to sign so they can get the guild started. I think 5 signs would have been better than 10 because most random invites are kicked once the guild is made anyway. Its hard to find 10 people sometimes if your friends aren't online and you might not even have 10 people you want in the guild yet and spamming every person running past if it's OK to invite just makes it take 10 times longer to do
---
Well I'm convinced. But- you can sunder armor in battle stance?????
---
Find a new guild maybe?  I mean, if that's how the guild is ran, and that behavior is condoned, it seems that the guild is toxic and not just one individual.

---
This exactly, AND I noticed one more strange thing:
---
I was doing a Hinterlands (Horde) escort on the Northwest part, where you escort some guy out of a building and when we were outside he **ran off about 40+y distance to autoattack an Alliance player twice**, who was in combat with another Horde guy. Then, with ludicrous speed, he ran back to his original position where he continued his escort path.
---
That other player was so far, I didn't even notice them fighting... so there's more problems than just the "pull aggro on return only" thingy!
---
AoC's open beta was capped at level 20 and it was one of the most fun MMO experiences I ever had.
---
Then the game released. Everything past level 20 was like a completely different game. Not sure if I even got to 21. I don't think my opinion on a game ever changed as quickly as that.
---
It's not like MC has a better offhand for warlocks though.
---
Not if you are aware of where damage can come from and know the tank will hold aggro.
---
Hit you in the feels.
---
Hey, just wondering if you still getting these disconnects. Been getting them constantly. Tried doing the following per their suggestion: Reset Cache/Interface/WTF, flushing my DNS, WinMTR,  Winsock and TCP/IP reset.
---
Cheers!
---
Not really. I still have more mana than health, makes more sense to life tap and regen the health than it does to drink.
---
Leave the guild. Sounds like a trash guild if no one else is bothering to say anything. You play the game to have fun and if someone is trying to make you miserable why the fuck would stay? Bounce and find a guild where people are trying to also have fun.
---
At last the map tells you where it was.
---
Meanwhile you abandon a quest in vanilla, you'd better have an addon or Wowhead, and a good memory, because good lucky figuring out which esoteric quest randomly led to something else on the complete other side of the zone for no apparent reason.
---
I'm excited to try this! Thanks for the info!
---
You just need to use a shield until like late 50s
---
I always thought you were stealthier naked, TIL.
---
We're all just grunts now boys, no longer gods walking around!
---
Any word? I am curious on whether I desrver a lot of loot because I played Wow in Vanilla and I'm sooo are that it is bugged. Usually a sparkly mob with no loot doesn't pretend to open a bag for a split second.
---
No you said the serpent and arcane shot interrupts the auto shoot. I don't think they interrupt.
---
Hi, I'm me, and I approve this message.
---
Kinda
---
I got my robe of arch mage.
---
Let me tell you, the essence of earth is the biggest grind to be ever done on classic wow. Two days of relentlessly aoe farming. From 10am to 4 am. Just to get ten. 
---
My robe is op and total worth
---
Yes. You can tank every dungeon in this game without spending any point into protection.
---
It will be quite a bit harder than going into prot, but it's entirely possible, and the class is designed to do that.
---
Yep please do I don‚Äôt understand this kind of hate
---
Does feign / set trap even work in pve and how do you get it to work, i never leave combat in dungeons.
---
BURN HIM AT THE STAKE!
---
Screenshot of the year already.
---
As a loc I've been running this fine with voidy and just imp for stam buff.  3 mages, priest and me.  I pull with shielded eye and mage2+3 blizzards the choke point and mage1 novas.  Loc moves in and hellfires while priest bubbles.  Important for loc to keep out melle range here.
---
Mages cycle novas and blizzards and patch should be near dead by time all 3 done.  Then it's clean up the fee remaining, drink and repeat.  
---
Arm and cath I've been pulling 12 or more at once with no issues with this method.  Hope helps
---
You won't be any good at AoE grinding on a mage until you unlock some talents. You want blizz 3/3, also reduces cd on nova etc.
---
Nice one. Yesterday I was doing some quests in ashenvale when I came across a night elf Druid that was a few levels higher than me. We waved and helped each other get out of a rough area and then went on our way.
---
As I was running down the road to turn in my quests, I encountered three different bank attempts which I successfully thwarted and ruined each of their days(A warrior, a rogue, and a priest). As I was bandaging up and summoning my minion, that piece of shit Druid from before sent my ass to the shadow realm.
---
This is my first time ever playing Horde and I am already like ‚Äúfuck the alliance.‚Äù
---
Yes, at least if you go arms, and if someone tells you otherwise then just ignore them.
---
Tanking as Arms is easy and you can tank ANY dungeon up to raids. You might meet some people who will decline you if you aren't going as prot but it's their loss.
---
Do you have a bunch of numbers? (average gold per run or hour for instance)
---
Actual question... do healers typically give tips for mage tables and lock rocks?
---
Is that the bagon mod in classic? I didnt know that mod still worked there
---
It's not possible at 40.
---
I personally use it alot in hopes of gettint a crit. Rend deals so little damage already I'd rather just sit there and hope for rng lol. 
---
Given as a prot I only do 2 mob pulls with Cleave which made it so much better for me to quest.
---
Look up ‚Äún key rollover‚Äù, you have a cheap keyboard that cuts corners.
---
Jeez never realized people were this passionate about this debate
---
well theres absolutely nothing anyone on reddit can do for you. and a lot of people do turn out to be lying about their use of exploits in a desperate attempt to overturn a ban. your only option is to speak with support and they have all the data to determine if youve exploited or not.
---
Depends of your level, really. For early game dungeons it's not a problem at all. I've seen many warriors with Arms spec tank dungeons such as SM with relative ease. You can probably tank in Arms spec up til your early 50s dungeons I think. It's when you get to 60 that it becomes a lot more difficult to tank without a Prot spec.
---
Oh yes! I didn't know that this kind of treasure even exists.
---
Hunters can't learn maces
---
I tell my healer to only heal me when I'm getting slapped up. Don't waste your mana on me, I rarely need it.
---
Realistically...? No!
---
Well seems like its not tied to server pop either. Just logged in medium server and still nothing :/ But only 15 ppl in tanaris. Lets see in a few hours
---
A shredder has a person it, not entirely mechanical
---
Pretty hard as you cant turn in runecloth for rep until 50+

yeah it's bagnon, you can get it on the twitch app. Works great
---
Yea, the people that you‚Äôre ‚Äútalking‚Äù to in game are not all poets, they won‚Äôt all speak well.
---
Yeah I've been at 1/2 hp two different times fighting a shaman and they got a wf proc + earth shock and I was instantly dead.
---
If u want a server with nice swedes, frenzy on skullflame has alot of kind players
---
?   
---
      
---
I charged in with my WW axe, licked the WF totem for good luck and an hour or so later, we were done...     
---
     
---
...wiping.
---
Why? Need more rep or what?
---
1G for an anonymous letter? I‚Äôll make an alt and do it myself if I didn‚Äôt want the person to know it was from me
---
I know :D
---
I think the challenge is giving the long-running players a sense of continued progression. By Legion, some players had killed two Old Gods, two Elemental Lords, Illidan, The Lich King, Deathwing, Garrosh Hellscream, Archimonde, and a whole host of other legendary foes. To go through all that, to be Exalted in a dozen different factions and carry weapons straight out of stories, and still be treated as "some guy" I feel like would be just as jarring.
---
Awesome! Thanks
---
GY is much easier since after the first room there is no ranged mobs. In lib you have to LOS so the spell casters can group up with the melee to get AOEd down.
---
Overall, its just much easier with 3x ranged like 3 mages or 2 mages / 1 lock and healer + tank. You can still do similar big pulls, but now you have a tank to soak up damage. I was getting 32k xp / hr in SM LIB yesterday wit that at level 34/35
---
Not sure what you consider "end game", but you really don't.
---
You'll miss story elements and follow on quests, sure, but none of it will keep you from entering dungeons or raids. Zone completion achievements also don't include *all* quests in their respective zones, only the major plotlines, which are pretty hard to miss or fall off the rails.
---
You need exalted, which you wont get with quests
---
He's not talking about guild sigs
---
Yes. You need a ton of rep. Exalted status.
---
you could sell something thats worth 1 silver for 1000gold to someone and pay real money for that
---
now you bought game money with real money, that would be bannable

A bit of research before reddit posting is often wise.

Lol what?

All the 60 instances, alliance have a much better time except maybe scholo and strath but even then. iF isn't exactly far...
---
priest wl 3 mages = spellcleave
---
shaman 4 warriors = meleecleave (best case scenario)
---
been going on since i play classic tbh. hard to find groups if you're not one of those classes.
---
They tagged first.
---
&gt;The end of the day I think If Blizzard actually did pick up this sort of idea, it‚Äôd either be as shallow as possible
---
Which is exactly what we got. Now everyone is a hero, even if you're 2 minutes old and boosted into WoD content.
---
A lot of RPGs work literally exactly how you just described. You not liking them that way doesnt make them bad RPGs,
---
Your rage generation might be low at a low level. So using shield block might be all the rage you get so I wouldn't advise using it to use revenge. You will even get less rage when you lose aggro. For aoe threat use demo shout. Once is enough to atleast keep them on you. Make aggro on your first target with a sunder and revenge. Then you can cast another demo. After that proceed to add sunders or revenge on all targets.
---
And yet, just going to kill ONE of the 4 elite dragons will take more time than that.
---
That old web design ... It is what I am looking for. With every aspect of the old website we had...
---
It‚Äôs way harder than wailing cavern but it prepares you for the future, some late game are ecen worse like BRD.
---
All in all it creates unforgetable memory. So you should try it (if your alliance). It‚Äôs sonluch more interesting than the prison for example
---
As far as I know, I have one Blizzard account, and pay one subscription.

Here's what I see when I click on your link [https://i.imgur.com/NbBJP8x.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/NbBJP8x.jpg)   
---
I'm not sure if this is what you were referring to with two licences/trial accounts
---
As a Warlock that does this: The only thing I want from you is a renew now and then, if you have the time. I have bandages and food, and it's my problem if I lifetap too much. Same your mana for more imporant things.
---
Rekt
---
oh fuck yeah YOU MY BOY TIM
---
RIGHT?!
---
i can heavily agree with this. Its a cool pirate/trading hub, its enforced by guards, and has quick access to barrens/Kalimdor. BB is one of the top places in the game
---
So I main lock as well  
---
And I agree with this most of the time however I tend to go into dungeons and I will preask the healer to not worry about me, and just throw a renew every now and then (at 50% mana life tapping to full or 80% taking into account regen while running around)  a renew will top me up again),  in most cases I am constantly making healthstones, because I play undead I also use corpses frequently to max out, and some easy life drains, or I take a bite when necessary.   
---
Sure there are times (boss/big pull) I might need a few of them juicy heals.. but I think specifically on lock a lot of it is just maintenance and renew and I am rolling \^\^
---
you can only have 10 chars per realm and they have to be on the same fraction
---
you can have max 50 chars spread over all realms
---
so: on another realm you can make a char at the other fraction
---
Sigh, 25s. I was selling for 95s each until people like you crashed the market.

**[NA][A][PVP][CST] [&lt;Hurricane&gt;](https://puu.sh/E76SK/7d8bdfff72.jpg) Raiding &amp; WPvP, Grobbulus RPPvP, optional RP**
---
___
---
Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old-style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you unfamiliar with Classic, and want a supportive and organized community to provide you with the environment, advice, and the backup you will need to survive on a PVP server?
---
#####What we do:
---
* Weekly city raids. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with city raids let us know in advance, we can bring newbies up to speed on the do's and don‚Äôts of zerg vs zerg PvP
---
* Support our members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP. 3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE and 1 City. Days are finalized to be Mondays and Tuesdays, 7-10 PM Central Time. If you cannot commit to those times, we have a second raid roster on Saturday and Sunday 7-10PM CST. However, for both rosters we have a dedicated wPvP day on Thursday 7-10PM CST. **We will distribute loot with a modified DKP system** with class-specific sanity checks (Sorry Hunters, you can‚Äôt roll on the bindings). In addition to raids, DKP will also be awarded for wPvP attendance and raid roster slots will be open to those that consistently attends them
---
#####Who we are:
---
* Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit
---
* A friendly tight-knit group who share a common interest in classic and other games
---
* Our culture is strictly old-school - we have loads of fun but won‚Äôt stand for pettiness, harassment, racism, or consistent mindless regurgitation of tired memes
---
#####Who we want:
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Someone who‚Äôs friendly, willing to learn, communicative on Discord, and loves world PvP
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you in and teach you. If you‚Äôre a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, or If you‚Äôre a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla ‚Äì you‚Äôre welcome, and you‚Äôre wanted.

It is pvp server specific on a pve Server it is not a Problem

Probably has a keypad and uses a thumbstick to move. 
---
Made a mistake though not rebinding it since now he cant play without it if he needs to on a laptop for example
---
Lok'tar ogar but male humans make that pathethic squeal when they die after acting big
---
lol lvl 30 human male warrior, go be generic somewhere else the herbs are mine.
---
Still not quite correct. The tooltip is technically correct. Rage decays out of combat at the rate of one point per second. Anger Management reduces that by one third by giving you one rage every 3 seconds, thus reducing your decay to 2 rage per 3 seconds and giving you 1 rage per second in combat.
---
The tooltip is not great, but technically correct :)
---
Some mobs have empty loot tables, working as intended.
---
Leveling? It's a toss up but sweeping strikes and mortal strike probably win out in most people's minds
---
I favor 2h fury but I can see why so many level arms
---
tl;dr?
---
Doesn't Noggenfogger have really bad faction imbalance? Like way more horde than alliance
---
Funny how the #noChanges crowd always seems to play the best classes as of 1.12 instead of the underpowered ones like druid ü§î
---
Pfftt. We don't need your dark magic here ruining the vibe anyway. We already have those weirdos in the Pool of Visions and don't need anymore.
---
1.5s gcd surely?
---
Higher DPR than HS (due to it costing rage and eating future generation).
---
The difference is your Druid has another GCD to use in place of Faerie Fire, the Warrior (after Rending) does not. An exception is Hamstring fishing for Deep Wounds/Overpower procs, which really only kicks in for a short time after talenting Imp OP &amp; Deep Wounds, but before obtaining Whirlwind.
---
Was with you in the first half

I'll heal the lock if he isn't constantly tapping to 1% health.

Great, now my day is ruined...
---
Wanted to do my 50 quest today :(
---
&gt;do healers typically give tips for mage tables and lock rocks?
---
No, not in instances. Conjuring water is just one of your responsibilities as a mage. If you're making water for someone outside of a dungeon or group - then sometimes they tip.
---
Lmfao. The original ‚Äúaight, ima head out.‚Äù
---
Thank you! That‚Äôs pretty much what I have been doing, and what I thought the stray was, but now I‚Äôm thinking the others in my group had a diff plan.
---
FUCK YAS TIMOTHY
---
üëç makes sense, thanks!
---
You can stop the cast
---
No, you're on a PvP server. You can only create characters of the same faction on a PvP server.
---
Try a different server and you will be able to make it.
---
Cmon this is getting Ridish...
---
Look Thrall with the power of THE HAND i can go places faster by eliminating the space between and my destination.
---
There's nothing really wrong with the mining/smithing combo. The shortcoming is that you can just buy armor from others, whereas the benefits of Engineering cannot be purchased in the same way.
---
If you like making your own armor stick with it, level BS and become an Armorsmith.

The best

We sieged Freewind Post for almost an hour last night on Bigglesworth
---
It was the most fun I've had in a long, long time
---
Even better, they will report you if in their judgement your name as a non rp one excusing their frustrations with you breaking their immersion. 
---
How insanely petty is that..
---
I am unironically unconcerned by this and believe distrubtions to RP servers to be a good thing because you RPers are really fucking wierd and creepy.
---
it terminates it early so you definitely lose the final tick
---
I‚Äôm level 51 on my rogue and still wearing the pants.
---
I finally decided I wasnt getting the WW axe last night. Most of these people have no idea how long and expensive that quest is. It makes more sense to grind RFK for corpsemaker as soon as you ding 30 and then go for ravenger. 
---
Def not worth 10-20% of your mount just for an axe you'll use for like 6 levels.
---
A tip for all mana users, take a tonne of water with you to dungeon runs. Find a mage and tip them if you have too. Then drink between every pull even if it's for 10 seconds, small amounts of recovery will keep your group going much longer.
---
For healers, if you know the encounter and your tank you can keep drinking for a few extra seconds until you need to jump up and heal. 
---
For DPS you can spend and extra 3 or 4 seconds drinking as it means you'll be giving the tank so extra time to grab aggro before you start the damage.
---
Whats it called?
---
yep it was me and I remember you as well!
---
we were waiting for Togga to spawn much longer than we should have  :D
---
saved a guy from getting ganked and the first thing he pms me is "give me water" 
---
i should've let him die.
---
I always wondered, what are some fun channels that usually exist on every server? I usually only know to join LookingForGroup and world
---
Just get on your character and wait in a major city. There will be guilds advertising on the main chat channel.
---
What is the strength spirit suffix, of the Boar right?
---
Got the first one from ST from a random mob, second droped from a yeti in winterspring and the third one dropped from a random dwarf in brd. Just dumb luck really
---
Who drops it? Ill ditch my dread mage cap for that REAL quick
---
[https://macrohub.tk](https://macrohub.tk/)/
---
oh nice, thanks for the info
---
I've never understood this, if you are being camped for an hour, some of that has to be your own fault. It's definitely possible to sneaky res and get away. Maybe you die a few times, but for an hour? How?
---
what does it mean?
---
Why should I want to play a druid when my ultimate goal is to tank, not to heal?
---
Being a warrior on horde side is pretty cool when plate starts dropping
---
Still classified as mechanical, and still inconsistent.
---
If things with a drivers can still bleed regardless of their type, then it could explain what are saying people for gnomeragan, knowing the existence of the arachnid-like thingies with drivers and the mounted 2-leggers.
---
Oh ok, so I need to gather runecloth and turn it in in Org probably? Thanks!
---
Molten Core much larger Cave. Maybe Mara 2nd WC 3rd? not many other caves I want to go to that I can think of. I mean AQ40 was a temple/Cave so take that one as you may.
---
I was the 1st player on my server to reach lvl 40 and enter the Badlands... so also the 1st hunter to tame Broken Tooth.
---
That got me so excited I knew I had to name him something AWESOME.
---
...never found a name, so now he's still named Cat.
---
Hey, thank you for the post.  I'm going to start reporting non-RP names now, I had just assumed the community had given up on it so I was ignoring them... but I'll start doing it again.  Cheers!
---
Its all about the feels
---
Ok, I figured haha. Was planning on just playing Classic anyway, but thought if I got a free copy of BfA, then I would probably check it out at least to see what's up with the story
---
Were you just doing SM runs? I'm about to hit 33 and low on gold. Did you have enough just grinding dungeons to afford mount and skills?
---
Dont pretend that they cant tank dungeons better than any other class.
---
Wait... do they really pull 75k an hour? I had a good thing on Gy and was getting like 28k at 35.
---
* Charge -&gt; Sweeping -&gt; Whirlwind -&gt;
---
* Cleave (for damage)/TC (for mitigation)/DStance Demo Spam (threat) -&gt; Whirlwind
---
* Auto the last mob to death in Battle Stance to pool ~30-50 rage for the next pack and repeat.
---
This, I have played locks for years. One of the beat things they can do is monitor their own health. I main a shaman now and I simply don‚Äôt heal locks unless I am full on mana and they are less than half. Even then, it is like 1 spell. I  not going out of my way to fill up anyone else‚Äôs mana bar. The pace of the group is limited by the healer‚Äôs mana. Expecting heals after life tap slows the group down.
---
RIGHT!?!
---
"Get runecloth" noted. Thanks!
---
Ah so you only ever visit dungeons and raids once?
---
Because you only accept \_your\_ definition of a fantasy world, and there's no place for silly names in it? 
---
Holy crap do you have your own gravitational field too?
---
&gt; Just stop healing us between pulls, we don't expect you to.
---
My post was obviously 100% directed to those who do.
---
I've been told plenty of times that I should heal a lifetapping locks. Everything from super salty yelling warlocks in all caps, or passive agressive "heals?" in between every single fight.
---
This whole post is a PSA for warlocks that DO NOT eat or drink food and expect a healer to make up for it, why do you insist on arguing on something we agree on? I say DO NOT, not to be confused with SOMETIMES.
---
Still asking, got a pic? If there was no documentation it does not count. else i can say i have been 60 sense day , way before joker.
---
No it doesn't though, if the healer is eating and drinking you do as well. Your waiting anyway and your just putting yourself and group at risk if your on low health when the fight starts.
---
5 stacks of sunder might make the target take 30-40% more damage, if you actually generate enough rage for it and get your 5 stacks. 
---
Heroic strike is a static 25% increase. So if you can get 5 stacks of sunder, sure. But 90% of the time the mob will be dead. 
---
Bad advice
---

If someone chooses to play on a PVP realm, one doesnt get to complain about getting ganked.
---
Thankyou
---
I remember Laintime summoning a Furbolg that healed him for ~100 a cast and i knew i wanted it too.  
---
15minutes into the grind: thats a no from me dawg.  
---
And this was in 200x, can't imagine doing it now either.
---
I had that since day 1 with no addons
---
Confirmed
---
There's not much point in moving versus mobs unless if you are using advanced strats. For mage you start at max range and cast spells hoping they die before they hit you too much. At later level you get a root so you cast then root when close and start casting again. For warrior/rogue you just go straight in.
---
For advanced strats: One rogue/warrior you can attack the mob while moving towards your next mob to save time. Either by running and then jumping with back away from mob to avoid daze and so you can attack, or by just backpedalling. Backpedal is seen as the "noob" move but often you don't need the speed from "strafe jumping". And for warriors they often wield very slow weapons and they have a slow. This allows a tactic called hamstring kiting, where you trade blows with the mob and slow it, then run away until your attack is ready again to trade blows again. This way you make a mob with attackspeed of 1-2seconds into a mob with attackspeed of 3-4  seconds(your weapon speed). This is massive for saving health.
---
But i mean when im on a whole different WoW account.
---
I used to play on RP PVP server in vanilla, no one RP. From looks of it, it seems better now. Dev prob should give a warning popup before making 1st toon on RP servers to make sure they understand what letters RP stands for.
---
Big time. Every spot is occupied by 3 or 4 mages, so as a mage I just respec'd single target. Too many news mages just got done watching Jokerd and don't realize their xp per hour is shot when you're pulling small and infrequently.
---
Literally was flamed by a warrior and warlock for not using blizzard during a SM run despite me, another mage, and the priest were drinking bc we were all oom from the previous fight.
---
Big true. especially since most of us are BM hunters right now.
---
I get what your saying. Wouldn‚Äôt hurt anything I guess.
---
AoE can be reflected? I don't recall that O_o
---
The same in Undercity for 4.5g at lvl 31.
---
Not if they contact the Hate mail person through discord!
---
Already seeing priests do this, leveling my alt with a new to classic friend, and while in the barrens I on two occasions had my pet buffed.. I was initially confused until I realized I rarely take damage.
---
I‚Äôve always liked Metzen, seems like he‚Äôs a fan just like us before a creator. Super fun to watch him have fun.
---
i guese the voice chat would need 75% of that traffic,
---
i think you can play most of the day with 200MB, but only if you do nothing else
---
even websites are a few MB now, so surfing the weg would be bad too
---
Regardless of if they were good or not, that was some supreme PvP, I get as pumped watching this 2v1 situation as people do watching a football game.
---
Good one
---
I'll get that data tonight, and I'm happy to share. It's nice for a gold making method to be completely independent of player interaction/competition. 
---
I have only shared a few of my vanilla methods since classic came out, and I regret sharing BEFORE I had mount money.
---
I love that some odd the characters feel larger than life. Like,  we know of jaina,  andiun and bolivar, but because we're all just dirty hobo adventures there is no reason why they'd ever speak with us without good reason. 
---
It makes the quests where we do interact with them feel really important.
---
Server lore is the dumbest thing I've ever read as an RPer
---
I can't resist the little blip on the radar.
---
I think there's an item that restores your previous skill level in that profession for a gold sink
---
Don't worry about mana problems when you are only 19.
---
I do not miss bigger bags at all. Inventory management is a big part of the gameplay, and it affects the game in more ways that we would normally think. First thing is that it constraints you to plan for frequent returns, so you need to have more strategic outlook on your travels. Planning and executing your plans is one the things that makes the games fun (at least for me). And the second is that you are forced to market your excess items of value, - either on AH, or by introducing currency into the game (vendoring).
---
If anything increasing bag sizes with each expansions was probably mostly motivated by the growth of amount of items in the game, not so much by the QoL concerns.
---
He is one of the unknowing. Burn him at the stake!!
---
Ok?
---
My internet provider had some issues a few days ago so I tried using my phone's LTE to play for a few hours. Together with discord I used about 100-200mb.
---
You can limit your daily data usage in your Windows settings, but I am not sure whether you can restrict specific apps to use your data.
---
For sure you have to stop Windows from auto-updating.
---
But what if there's a patch? That'd use up your data in no-time
---
&gt; If you are combat, I can‚Äôt see a reason to use dagger in off-hand
---
faster weapon speed = more poison applications
---
I know, but I'm not looking to min-max while leveling. Plus Echeyakee is the only white lion until Winterspring. And then of course there's the added sense of accomplishment from pulling off such a difficult tame/ being the only Alliance hunter with this pet.
---
Bfa players in a nutshell
---
I report them for spam anytime someone invites me with out sending a PM or anything. Fuck you I dont want to join Memers.
---
I am leveling as fury because i like it better that way, not because it is more viable. However i cannot recommend it because of the extremely poor hit rating, as others mentioned. 
---
Fury isn't something to spec into because you have two axes lying around. Even as an Orc, you want daggers to compensate for the poor hit rating. You want to hit as often as you can for extra rage. You also want A LOT of Agility to have flurry up as often as possible. 
---
The moment you go fury you'll stop being a warrior and start being a glas cannon, like a rogue without stealth. You'll even be taking a lot of the gear rogues want. 
---
But for fury to make it work you have to understand it and you should WANT it. 
---
So from a numbers standpoint, i'd say no because axes are too slow and the rest of your gear is probably stamina and strength. Because that's what warriors take and it'll be useless with fury. 
---
From a players point of view i'd say play whatever you like best. Because if you don't have fun playing your warrior the numbers count for nothing. 
---
From a smartass point of view i'd generally say "no" to everyone asking that question. It's a choice YOU have to make, because you WANT it. You want it if you understand how fury works, not because someone on the internet recommend to switch. You play arms if you want to be a warrior. You play fury if you want to be a monster. You need to know how to gear up though, or it won't work. And you'll have to be ok with the many times you'll stand in front of a mob with 25% life not hitting anything for four, five, six swings still not being able to execute, while the low health warning keeps flashing up. You'll be very inconsistent leveling as fury. Maybe you'll tear through the next enemy in a matter of seconds. Maybe you'll just missing everything standing there like an idiot. 
---
That's why, no, i cannot recommend it.
---
It's a console command. I'm on mobile right now but just google wow command to display class colours
---
Those locks need to learn their class. The same concept still applies, don't heal them when they do that. If there's not an enemy actively engaging a warlock, they don't need any healing past a Renew. Period.
---
Could also play a bunch of WSG when they implement it.
---
Posted a guide on exactly this topic about a week ago:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cypaqo/healing_guide_for_lowest_downtime/
---
If you are telling the truth, you don‚Äôt have 1000g to spend on a mount from vendoring crap.
---
I dunno about classic, but during wod my buddies comcast went down. He tethered to his phone (5gb free with tmobile) he used about 256mb of data all day
---
Not sure it's worth the effort given A. How awesome Kodo are and B. Raptors are the second best and can't be ridden as a Tauren.
---
You shouldn't be sitting on rage though, one of the major reasons you use Sunder is because it can be dodged, and by not consuming your melee swing it (more or less) doubles your chance of proccing Overpower.
---
6 hours!? I don't know how people are so short on money I was very close to 90g at 40 on my warrior. You must have trained too many unnecessary abilities.
---
I‚Äôll tell you again. Fuck off.
---
There is /played
---
yea, missed that i guese, thx
---
It's simple, you are using your ranged weapon 99% of the time, but you should be using your melee weapon at the same time as your ranged weapon.

Yeah but you don't do that. Otherwise you would be tagged as PvP. Weird flex man

I would not recommend aoe grinding for inexperienced mages (especially if you are not keybinding). You're going to be dying way too often. In addition, all the aoe spots are fiiled with mages. So much so that even if you are good at it, it would be quicker and less frustrating to just quest normally.

the raid dungeon gating is all fine but ffs with all the bg/honor/everything slow rollout crap ugh.
---
It's like the lead character from the movie Her
---
I remember that to, iirc there used to be a notice on the character creation screen about the names too when you hovered over the select name thing as well.
---
Probably because the server is less then a week old, and mostly populated with decently leveled characters.

I dont think twinking will be a thing until bgs.

The key difference between classic and live is that in classic you go into something expecting to fail and in live you expect to win 100% of the time. The difference this makes is that classic will make you happy while live will make you sad everytime your expectations aren't met.
---
What pants ?
---
Blizz man bad
---
I'm honestly not sure, but I believe melee range for the mob.
---
After posting that I googled it and it looks like artisan is available for all gathering professions at level 25 and at any trainer.
---
yes, if you pay for a 2nd sub you can do this
---
I made 2 gold casually doing it, over MAYBE 3 full pocket clears (after vendor maybe 2.5g). It's definitely worth it if you don't mind the mindlessness of it. I suggest putting something to watch on your second monitor (if you have one).
---
At least in my experience, I think that Gnomer and Sunken Temple are the most difficult leveling dungeons. 
---
Or at least, they are the ones that I wipe in the most. I think a lot of this is due to people just not knowing the dungeons. Some people just straight up skip these dungeons while leveling because of their location and general difficulty for their level.
---
I camped hillsbrad on my paladin for over an hour preventing 30 low level horde doing their villager quests
---
Counterpoint: I know my capabilities as a warlock when I Life Tap! Sometimes I Life Tap to 30% and then use one of the tons of bandages I have. Or I am actually about to sit down and eat when the healer tosses a big healing spell at me.
---
So, as much as we appreciate the healing: don't always think that we need to be at 100%. Sometimes we are at 75% when a pull happens after tapping, but we still have bandages/HS ready/Healing Potions ready.
---
The pet gets might while the hunter gets salvation \o/
---
It's just a game. No need to be a dick by spawn camping
---
Can't read German sorry.
---
Fair enough.  If I get rez'd randomly the first thing I do is give the guy a stack of water.  Fair's fair.
---
Now he‚Äôs wondering why he‚Äôs getting all that shit for need rolling on a mace
---
I think you need to ask the German subreddit my dude.
---
Not sure what they use, but Titanbar and a Titanbar XP plugin used to do this nicely.
---
*Only gets half a bar of XP* the true classic experience
---
Ouch!
---
Honestly, I'd say it's mostly the lvl 15. That's definitely low for DM. The final boss is lvl 21.... 
---
But for your other questions: never bubble the tank except for dire emergencies... it's probably one of your rarest used spells in a dungeon setting. Get spirit tap as a talent and try to last hit mobs now and then to get your 100% regen going. Renew is really inefficient at this level so I'd focus more on straight heals. 
---
Only heal the amount that is needed. Use lesser heals as well as your greater heal to avoid overhealing. Any additional healing is wasted mana.
---
PvP on a realm does not mean people do more pvp than pve. The only difference is you can kill one another in contested zones, such as stranglethorn vale for instance.
---
I would advise you to not go for the full always queue realms as you‚Äôll be spending time just queuing, and you‚Äôre not playing when queuing, look for medium to high pop realms. Medium pop is what high/full was in vanilla, anything more than that is getting overcrowded, a lot in specific zones, such as again stranglethorn vale where you can get 200 of each faction in a zone, really diminishes leveling and enjoying the game. 
---
Going for a low pop realm would be dangerous as it can become either dead, or have a perfect community like server with good pop. 
---
Medium, high at peak is your best bet, regardless if it‚Äôs pve or pvp
---
I actually prefer it to smack me, so I can drain life and watch their hope fade away :P, at full hp it just feels so.. wasteful.
---
I love fishing too. Gotta try this out. Thanks. :)
---
As a hunter it‚Äôs more did you get your mount ? No I already have 4 level of skill to buy (and the pet skill)
---
Oh SNAP you bought gold!?
---
That's brilliant, and harsh, lmao. I love this game.
---
[Pls](https://i.redd.it/y4xzxcw5bkl31.png)
---
you can gank then hide in the bushes untill it wears off
---
Go back to stormwind, typical ailliance swine, over-analysing stuff untill they get jumped and now its 'thats not fair''
---
yeh as a hordie we can flex on yous all we want lol
---
You've got to be proactive with your groups as mage.  Once you're in them and have dispersed the requisite refreshment to everyone no one wants you to go because it'll make them feel guilty.  It's kind of like advertising a party with free beer.
---
yeah ST, I got mixed up there.
---
&gt;It has taken years of therapy for me to admit something like ‚ÄúI miss you, but I am also very angry with you‚Äù.
---
I pobably need therapy still. It's been three years but it's not going away. 
---
Nobody tells you the truth about grief. The pain never gets better. It never hurts less. You just learn to tolerate it. 
---
In WoW terms... Grief never starts hitting you for less damage, you just gain more armor so you feel less of it.
---
Thanks I didn't think about that.
---
I‚Äôm not talking about this one specific encounter. Many videos of that era displayed what is frankly awful gameplay. It‚Äôs a difficult one, sure. But, as with much of mythic raiding today, a lot of it is based around coordination and keeping people alive. Basically, herding cats. If people can avoid basic mechanics and play their class mildly well, it will die.  This will happen day 1 of its release by high end guilds.
---
They stopped doing 40man raids because of the logistical issues of getting 40 people on, and how they saw the success of ZG and AQ20 with their smaller raid sizes easing the accessibility. They saw the attendance boss was a big issue for guilds, and was part of why many guilds crumbled. Smaller sizes helped fix this, though at a cost of ‚Äúepicness‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt the extreme coordination and complexity of fights, since that gets shot right out the window with TBC some fights.
---
"... as long as the group isn't wiping and every pull isn't taking forever and eating up all the healer's mana..."  IMO, that is the most important thing in your entire post.  I play a healer, and have thought or done some of the things you listed in the beginning of your post AFTER it became apparent that I was being drug around the dungeon, not having much of a mana pool to work with.  Or after a wipe, and reading /p "No heals?".  
---
" Who the hell is out there letting their DPS die, and then sitting around sipping brandy and smoking cigars and jerking each other off about how great that decision was? "  Probably about 2% of the Tank/Healer population.  BY FAR not the majority.
---
" If everyone is playing the game at a proficient level... "  Now that just isn't reality...
---
"Play the game.  Press your buttons.  Do your job."  Yes I agree, and I would venture to guess that most people do too.  BUT it's kind of like audibly talking to the shit traffic you've been stuck in for an hour... "Use your signals, don't cut me off, pick a lane."  It most certainly does not change the reality of the situation.
---
But missing those chains has no effect on your progression.
---
That was just a way to get around automod and spamfilter. The shit that gets removed is just absolutely random
---
Orgrimmar holds a special place in my heart since it was the first capital city I ever experienced in game and was where I spent a lot of my time over the years as a horde main.
---
However, I still find Ironforge to be the best captual city in vanilla hands down. In TBC, I would say Silvermoon can rival Ironforge though.
---
Most innocent people take their evidence and contact blizzard.
---
Bug abusers take to online forums and think gathering a bunch of followers will help their case.
---
You are a cow
---
Can't even get the epic mount yet : ( it sucks, I'm kinda unsure what I'll do, most likely buy a regular 100%, then do the quest once its available.
---
The bag space excuse makes sense til like level 10-15. After that, actual silver is left behind when every coin counts. I get the sneaking suspicion that people aren't going through their bags and throwing out the worthless stuff to make room for more valuable stuff.
---
Titan panel is what you seek
---
I also ressurect and heal people randomly all the time...
---
Many people don't even say thank you.. feels bad :(
---
Hmm, interesting!
---
Not challenging, just curious: from where do you think the pervasive opinion that retail is a lot brighter comes from? I had personally never really compared myself, I was primarily going off what others said.
---
but no engineering trainer :(
---
Accurate the day I discovered this I was like "wtf It's beautiful" and the loots also become really beautiful at the same time &gt;. &gt;
---
That's like when you discover what is the "Princess" model haha.
---
Yes, and this one visualized it nicely in top left corner.
---
"you can have one sting on target" . That goes for single hunter, if you have more hunters you can stack scorpid or viper ones on same target. However, single hunter is not able to have multiple stings on same target, not to mention multiple of same type.
---
nah, buffing costs just alot of mana
---
This is a winner
---
I don't understand. Was the rogue supposed to indicate in any way that they are attacking the warlock beforehand so it would have been a fair and square fight?
---
Hey, I'm on Sulfuron Horde side
---
Just stick with rank 1, most people won't notice ;)
---
We just got a 40 man raid attuned to ony via chain summoning, the locks went through 80 or so each lol
---
Why wait until you get in game. I‚Äôll whisper you right now telling you to join the guild. 
---
*Looking for a hardcore raiding guild capable of taking on dark shores and dead mines. Join us today. Discord included. Participation not guaranteed*
---
The horde on your server must suck to not have sent a squad.
---
Running around all the time on your own legs really changes perspective on your surroundings. Huge difference. I absolutely love flying, but I'll admit, it really takes you out of the environment.
---
This is why I generally kill the rogues I see, they either deserve it now or will deserve it later.
---
Thanks for the gold and silver btw :)

If your game plan is to be one shot and pray that not a single mob aggros onto you at any point then you are almost certainly the biggest problem in the group.
---
Often in dungeons you can get more effective cleave by standing in melee with certain mobs, like the arcane explosion scenario OP is mentioning, if the mobs are spread the tiniest bit you'll have to go into melee to hit all of them.

Well, depends on what you mean by RPG, because a lot of people have different interpretations

Ret dps... Ok iam done xDdddd

Lok'tar! ...  ogar

I don‚Äôt expect heals if I life tap. If I die that‚Äôs on me. I shouldn‚Äôt be putting myself in that position anyways. ‚ÄúToP kEk BiG diCk dPs‚Äù is great but your dps will be non existent when you pull aggro and die. I typically use life tap when I need to channel one more Hell fire or get one more shadow bolt off. I don‚Äôt ignore my conjured drinks. They were provided for a reason.
---
Im playing horde on mirage Raceway and its looking pretty good. Lots of peeps.
---
Well i have made an appeal - im gonna try to go outside and see what that is like while Blizzard handles my case! Thanks for the suggestions so far!
---
Lol this guy obsessing over downvotes, total tool.
---
That's what I do !
---
Noob question: How do I get the coordinates in the top right?
---
I remember installing pokemon icons and mouse cursors on the class pc back in the 90s, teacher thought I had installed a virus.
---
I've seen this.. entertaining for sure but keep in mind to all you would-be warrior PvP warriors out there.. this guy was stacked with buffs, pocket healers and a bugged talent point (which gives him access to Mortal Strike and Deathwish) so this isn't realistic at all..
---
But yes definitely entertaining to watch.
---
That works for any labirynth
---
That was me but for a helm. Got mine from my level 30 warlock quest. Felt good after not getting a helm for 30 levels!

CC works on a heartbeat system in classic. Where every second your cc can break, some are more vulnerable than others.
---
But you don't see a lot of sap usage in vanilla PvP videos for a reason.
---
You got served Tauren style.
---
Grats man!!
---
I watched a human priest mind control hordies off of the boat from booty bay the other day. They had a nice dip into the ocean.
---
10/10 Would watch again.
---
Thanks for posting this. I never played Warrior back in the day (always on heals duty), so this isn't something I understood when picking up a warrior in classic.
---
Mining and engineering too. TB is where it‚Äôs at (though I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an engineering train fee there).
---
Imagine actually inviting either to gnomer lmao
---
It looks like Deadmines.
---
WERE ALL WINNERS OK
---
Yeah you should be fine. I started saving and not buying my abilities around 36 and dungeoned the whole way and had enough halfway through 40. Just be careful buying stuff until then
---
Dont forget, back in Vanilla boss mechanics and strategies were kept as "guarded secrets" among successful raiding guilds. These days theres 10-20 guides easily accessible on YouTube.
---
End game pugs, I think, will be able to progress far beyond MC with ease. The average player's skill is much greater than what it once was, and the knowledge needed to participate is widely available.
---
I think endgame Classic will be relatively welcoming in terms of finding groups
---
Its like patches in the original release.
---
If you want to be an asshole, sure.
---
I was just joking around really.  No limitation at all.  It isn‚Äôt the most effective team of two classes that was all, but nothing wrong with it.
---
I think I'm gonna take a break by messing around with retail for awhile. I played a ton the first week and I'm like 5-7 levels ahead of my friend group.
---
Jost ask Bob next time.
---
Haha, I always reason 100% &gt; all, some decent gear like felcloth and such, sure, rest can be farmed through dungeons, might try to get the OP robes from scholo, but otherwise nah, 100% is important to increase dat cash flow.
---
Which server?
---
There's a weekly one, but I think having it be daily (or just refreshing it once a week but keeping it permanently pinned) wouldn't be a bad idea.
---
Me, uses lessr mana pot to buff the entire party of 5 + pets as they run by. #justdruidthings
---
Shit when I hit 60, I was just grinding it out in Silithus helping guildies with some AQ quest chain. I was excited and so was my guild, but we literally just continued the grind. Level didn't mean that much lol
---
I try to do both.
---
ive only done two wc runs so far and i didnt play vanilla. the shortest run took about 1h and the longest one (the most uncoordinated back and forth looking for questitems) about 1h45. how do you spend 5h in there?

---
You probably should have started the second you found a piece of gear with int on it that wasn't better than your leveling gear without int on it.
---
Thank you everyone for the in depth and hasty replies :)
---
I believe my mistake was definitely using the bubble too much which burned through a lot of unnecessary mana. Apart from that I already lower rank healing spells bound already. Ill take this into my next attempt at DM
---
So the quest's being an example of interesting story telling ceases because of being overlevelled ?
---
Yep, it works perfectly fine in battle stance, don't even need to stance dance for this to work.
---
Fast bows are good for pvp to interrupt casters and because aimed shot is normalised.
---
Anal [recklessness]
---
My bank alt on retail has a fancy hat, tuxedo and the diamond tipped cane. He's a baller.
---
I once had a particularly egregious Warlock tell me, at level 40, that he never bought food or water for dungeons after I called him out for never using any regen between pulls.

You may not like it, but this is what the peak paladin looks like.

Agreed there!

Pickpocketing my way through sunken Temple and brd nets a good gold or two extra per run. It's 100% worth doing before you open up on your terget
---
I imagine that you should grab any healing items you start to see drop.
---
Pro tip for minimizing the risk of being a target dummy in STV:   
---
1. If you can, do the three parts (North, middle and south\*) while in general 3 levels higher than usual, like being around lvl 33-34 when you start the first quests, and going for a couple of levels mid 30's before doing the next parts. 
---
2. If it's possible try to do the quests which often are done by groups (trolls etc.) early in the morning or really late at night. 
---
3. If possible try to kill your way into the middle or behind the pack density of mobs in the different areas if possible, so the enemy has to clear quite a few mobs just to reach you.
---
4. Group up if possible.
---
No, he's the asshole for damaging you!!
---
Thanks for the advice! I started in BC and remember people complaining about a vanish bug then too, so I'm guessing it took them a while to work that one out. Anyway I'm glad I leveled my first aid while I was at it, and I have a few anti-venom already in my bag.
---
i would actually bother higher level mages to make food n water for me. some would get mad and most would understand
---
Thank you much!
---
It's never to early. 
---
Just keep in mind - there isn't that much plate stuff with int pre-raid. Rolling need on any other armor class is fine.
---
Had an level ?? Orc Hunter attack me on the boat when it was approaching BB. I waited as long as I could and then bubbled, as the boat pulled in the bruisers attacked them. They tried feinting death but the wise bruisers saw through it and killed them while I stood their laughing.         
---
It was a good day.

---
Where are you playing from?
---
Tank for RFC?
---
You‚Äôre like the father I never had :‚Äô)
---
What level do you get it at?
---
If you do more damage, you're killing things faster. With a nice slow 2hander, those whirlwinds will be hitting like a truck, compared to just sitting there auto attacking. You might take more damage per hit, but you'll take less damage overall in a fight.
---
Ah, thank you

&gt;I had more rage to play with 
---
lol and what did you do with it?
---
They should just open up paid transfers.
---
I'm starting to see a pattern.
---
The mechanics and social structure of Classic encourage teamwork and being nice to people, if you want to complete difficult quests and dungeons and have your name be remembered fondly by others (resulting in more invites to things).
---
Retail is the opposite.
---
OMEGALUL! i can do twitch teen speak too
---
yea, you sir are a nazi.
---
The farming of them before raids, the fact that they don't stack...
---
What server are you on? If it's Incendius you are not the only one. ;)

I was messing around with keybindings in Booty Bay. Pressed shift+F to check if something lights up, but it wasn't bound. What happened then was F fired off, which is kick. That resulted in me, kicking and missing some ?? Nelf Hunter, whose pet then agro'd on me, resulting in the BB guards nuking him. I felt great. From now on, I always attack hunters, just in case the pet isn't set to passive.

I was there a couple of days ago and I couldn't.
---
You sound like a pathetic bitch
---
You are most welcome.
---
I ran a dnd game using the Defias quests in Elwyn and Westfall leading to Onyxia. 
---
Started out in one of the Elwyn mines where they discovered the kobolds were being lead by a pair of gnomes and were teleporting the ore somewhere else with teleportation circles. 
---
They report back to Stormwind where they recieve a very cold reception from Katrana Prestor, but Shaw with SI7 knows something is up so they are sent west to investigate reports of the Defias in Westfall since there was evidence of them with the gnomes. 
---
Party makes it to the keep at the western boarder where unbeknownst to them, a succubus has murdered and replaced the lord of the keep. Party says they'll be heading out and he insists they stay while he sends for reinforcements to Stormwind.
---
The party decides they need to leave and let Shaw know they've been made before the keep messenger can notify Katrana. They use one of the teleportation scrolls to make a circle and land in the mage district of Stormwind. Party stealthily lets Shaw know what's going down and he gives them the rune address of a circle in Westfall that hasn't been used in ages. Some wizard had moved out there ages ago but got killed in the last war so the tower *should* be empty. 
---
Party heads out only to find the tower *is* occupied... by a necromancer. Quick 3 level dungeon later and the party goes into hex crawl mode in Westfall where they quickly discover all of Westfall has been taken over by open revolt from the Defias. The Sentinel Hill keep has been abandoned and the forces there regrouped elsewhere.
---
Eventually the party meets up with Gyran Stoutmantle where they learn the Defias has a huge force at the Deadmines and that is where their leader, Edwin Van Cleef, is assembling something big there. 
---
The party organizes an attack on the main entrance of deadmines so they can slip in the back entrance in the chaos. When they finally make it to the port inside they find Van Cleef IS assembling something terrifying: an air ship dreadnought. 
---
As they are finishing off minions on the dock, the ceiling above them parts and the airship begins to take off. The party jumps aboard at the last minute and has a battle while the ship careens through the air. 
---
Once they have secured the ship they land it in the ocean and sail it in to Stormwind harbor. No way they are going to let the army take their hard earned air ship so that act like it's just a regular boat. 
---
Big celebration in Stormwind for the defeat of Van Cleef, but Prestor tells the party there's still problems to the east in Redridge. This part was just a bit of filler but I was establishing Prestor's link to the Black Rock orcs. 
---
At this point I mentioned the magical engine was running suboptimal so the party looked into who built it: a mage named Arugal. This leads to a brutal double normal length dungeon where they fight Arugal and retrieve the Scythe of Elune. 
---
This is where the game ended as it just kinda petered out. The Scythe is an evil artifact in my game and where do you take artifacts to destroy them? Volcanoes! This is where the party would have met Marshall Windsor and done Jail Break and the first major arc would have ended with the heroes having the only means of getting to kalimdor quickly enough to fight Onyxia before she recovered from the battle at Stormwind.
---
&gt;I'm hating my life leveling a druid 
---
Really? Druids are an S-tier leveling class. Really outshone only by Hunters. Ridiculously mobile, excellent sustain, great survivability. And yes, your TTK will rocket once you get cat form. Drop two points in feral swiftness ASAP and questing through your 20's and 30's is a breeze.
---
That's Fine, but you're all gonna start tipping warriors for their repair bills if you want us to tank dungeons for you.
---
Or tall green human, yeah. That's my whole point actually, just play Horde
---
I never got a tip all the way up until 43 and a guy decided to tip 20g for 2 stacks of food and water plus a port to org. Made my mage day.
---
So you value your time and abilities at $0.  Essentially valuing yourself at $0.  Cool.  But not me.
---
I was a total noob when I started playing wow (in 2007, early bc) and actually played a melee hunter for a while until someone told me the bow wasn't just for looks and enemies running away
---
The main Defias storyline in Westfall starts in Elwynn Forest at like, level 3.
---
That's just sad.
---
old enough to shag your mum
---
Well, it must be so. Otherwise it would require an alliance killing a horde, or a horde killing another horde, both of which our troll scientists have deemed impossible.
---
Run away and cry for your horde sisters to come and outnumber a single paladin running at you
---
Probably won‚Äôt be caught tbh, we have the P√¥onHunter in our guild and he is lvl 36. I got caught at lvl 11. Just stay out of general chat where the snowflakes live. All I did was offer to help people with hogger and got caught üòÇ
---
Well, if Blizzard was "allowed" to change stuff, you'd actually have an alternative to warrior if your aim is to tank ...
---
Why so mad
---
Shimmering flats has been almost exclusively high level people ganking low level people on my server.
---
I notice several alliance set up camp at the great lift "welcoming" Horde to a pvp zone.
---
Thats just what it looks like on mobile ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
‚ÄûI can‚Äôt afford to send anyone else... so you go.‚Äú what?
---
I named mine fartbox and got reported and now i cant rename him from cat :(
---
You look the shattered necklace from a mob, have to take it back to IF, turn in 5 silver bars, then get sent back to uldaman.
---
The Rune costs 21s according to WowHead
---
Frost shock would be on a 5 second cooldown making it an infinite kite spell.   
---
Earth bind for when the frost shock resists.    
---
Ghost wolf for full resets.    
---
 Bonus: warstomp for extra stun/interupt on a short 2 minute CD.
---
You can get a cat and a bird from DM.
---
Pretty sure you need lvl 39 for tuxedo in classic i could be wrong though.
---
That's great thought, I'm going to charge 10 silver per heal, 50 per resurrect. And rogues can roll on the chests all day long!
---
This is never what classic has been about.  All classes bring QOL or special advantages to a group.  If rogues didn't unlock things they just become a basic dps.
---
&gt;rend, execute, b shout, cleave?  
---
All very easy to do without sundering. If you're spending rage on sunder, you're not cleaving. If you have time to stack sunder and then cleave a few times you are grinding on mobs that you shouldn't be.
---
You can also use an add-on called Plater and it's magical.
---
Hah, I went to get my first aid training in Duskwallow Marsh, and started cursing and hopped on the FP when I could not find the "trainer".  I did not realize it was a manual you needed to buy and then learn.
---
&gt; Hey I knew people from the Horde side who did a major trek to Dun Morogh just to play Gnomeregan back in 2005. 
---
Why? They get a teleporter directly to the instance
---
Good idea but not right now :) ! i note it
---
"when not raiding, guildies are expected to grind for top tier grays"

Ngl I laughed out loud on my bus ride to work just now lol
---
Yeah, my roommate refuses to accept Windows 10 exists, but deals with it, so he hides it from himself by candy coating the UI with some crap that turns it into Windows 7's UI.
---
Agreed I have 2 days played time on my guy and my guilds transfer doesn‚Äôt represent how I felt about the previous server stalagg, now I bit the bullet with everyone saying ‚Äúit won‚Äôt be dead people won‚Äôt be able to stand ques‚Äù and it‚Äôs like.... really dead to the point the games unenjoyable because I‚Äôm just playing by myself.
---
and you sound funny, amuse me you moppet, wut you gonna do? talk to me some more
---
You'd be better off as arms. You'll also do more damage if you're allowed to tank in your dps gear with a 2h (more rage from taking damage as you mentioned). At that level, you could also auto attack the primary target while sundering a different mob with a mouseover macro. This will allow you to do more damage to that add after you kill the primary one. It's probably more damage than wasting white damage on cleave.
---
And shit it was kinda fun üòÇ
---
Health low? Lol  ‚Äúbitch I‚Äôm dead!‚Äù
---
I‚Äôm not selling teleportation.  Someone asked me to port to their city to craft something for them they tipped me 10s
---
How about you watch your pet?
---
Slower ranking! I wanna be a k night sometime.
---
You don't notice how paternalistic and condescending that is? 
---
Maybe if the tank had just taunted the mob back, or mocking blow, or intercepted, or anything else, he wouldn't have died and there wouldn't have been a wipe
---
Yesss make it 10x better lol
---
The entrance to BRD.
---
seriously though, say someone made a "newsmail" character and pushed real company ads through mails, would this be again the TOS?
---
As a warrior leveling mostly solo STV is literally impossible. Going to farm SM runs at 34 has been way more profitable
---
Loving mage but there's a slight annoyance when someone just opens trade and waits, expecting food or water without going through the basic motions of just asking.  My RL friends do it too sometimes and I'm always tempted to deny them until they ask politely.
---
Yeah, brings back the dnd vibes. How an mmorpg/rpg should be.
---
Who is praying? It's simple math. At no point will I pull aggro over any other dps warlocks don't even start a burst rotation and until all dots are on the damage ramps up which gives everyone plenty of time to gain threat, assuming the tank can't hold aggro I still wouldn't be hit keep in mind i'm regening health this whole time I won't be one shot I sustain during pulls. That's literally how warlocks work. They exchange mana for health and health for mana.
---
It really does lol
---
I'm curious about the rage pooled between mobs though. Maybe on a single target just spamming HS to 0 Rage would be better DPS, but what about if you take like 5 pulls in a row? In OP's method it seems like it'd be easier to go into the next pull with some rage left and potentially make up the difference in DPS over the multiple pulls.
---
What is CC? I keep reading that everywhere.
---
Doesnt work, weve tried that.
---
I should name my cat "Broken Tooth" and shadowmeld with him out near one of the spawn points for actual Broken Tooth...
---
Is this sub full of a bunch of brainlets? What is with the god damn camera pictures.
---
No.  Warriors need the heals and dps to gain the experience from the kills. Mages are providing a financially viable service they do not benefit from.  Totally different things.
---
The post is either a shitpost and is misleading new people or the guy is a moron and is misleading new people. Either way, this thread should not have the traction it has. It‚Äôs very misleading and poor information.

If you're a warrior and the guild wants you to respec they will pay. Any good worth anything will do this.

Btw, 8 respecs a week? Wtf.
---
I use to play on a pve server. Then I got wise. Went to a pvp server.  Just before cata launched. Moved 5 toons.  Well worth it.
---
Yeah, I guess you play a hunter and not a healer. Your pet is a liability not not an off tank. Also, I‚Äôd be willing to bet you are ‚Äúhelping spread the damage‚Äù but actually just pissing people off. If the group is formed with this in mind, fine. But understand that your thought process here is not something any healer or tank generally shares. Use your mend pet and have a nice day.
---
Had similar issue but with brothers :D
---
Aside from some people ive run into getting more into character than usual its mostly the same. I quested with two undead last night who were telling world appropriate jokes and i played along. Had a blast. If your thinking about it i say go for it im new to it but its almost exactly the same as regular, with a little extra. Come over to Deviate Delight!

I have 0 expectations that a mage give me food or water either. If they do, that's nice of them, but not expected.
---
It absolutely works on players. I remember back in the day being able to actually cancel spell casts in PvP (if both you and your target are out of combat). You just cast distract right behind them the split second before the cast bar finished and they'd spin and lose the cast because they aren't facing you. Worked really well against mages.
---
I agree as a mid level healer , a lot of people don‚Äôt realize that this is classic and mana pools are a thing.  My heal/flash heal / lesser heal are 10-15% of my mana pool. I can‚Äôt afford to spam heal your vw when the tank is eating dmg. I‚Äôll heal the pets if I can but that‚Äôs not my priority.
---
&gt;#nochanges community will be angry
---
They are angry at everything that they aren't directly profitting from. The game is different from when it originally released, somehow you rarely hear someone complain about that.
---
I was invited by a random group for Maraudon full run.
---
Having been only level 46 hunter, i badly needed the instance for the Gryphonwing Long Bow that is a reward from finishing Corruption of Earth and Seed in Desolace.
---
We took off things slowly, pulling pack by pack, killing, kiting doing everything by the book. And we didn't even wiped once, the only casualty we had was at the last boss Princess Theradras, where our DPS Warrior died.
---
I was tired, i was exhausted, i wanted to go to bed. But! But upon finishing the last quest and returning it, i instantly got filled up with energy ready to continue questing or go back in Maraudon for another fresh run!
---
This will never happened to me back in BfA or Legion, this is only that rare moment repeating from 14 years ago.
---
Another big issue is in the tunnels with a higher and lower walk way if you have someone in your group that's a little underlevelled, they can end up pulling the entire other walkway if they don't hug the wall.
---
Ice Block and Divine Shield can't be dispelled by any means in Vanilla.
---
Well this discussion is now turning into food/water but that‚Äôs not what I intended.  Reagents cost silver though
---
There is a difference in dps when you factor in gift of arthas.
---
Can you go into some detail about how exactly you made that much gold in such a short time?
---
I will award you no buffs, and may god have mercy on your soul.
---
Hmmm my rogue friend also uses A and D to strafe. Is that common?
---
It wasn‚Äôt like the healer said F U. The tank got priority over the temporary meat shield that thinks he can pull. It wasn‚Äôt worth the mana to dump heals into the dps and the tank can‚Äôt keep up with everything the dps pulled.
---
No, but can we stop the bleeding heart narrative that other servers don't also have to cultivate their community?
---
Can't believe this is upvoted so much, and even gilded. It's just not true in most situations, and there are much better ways to optimize warrior leveling.
---
As a warrior, you should be looking to grind on green mobs, not yellow or orange. Therefore, the time to kill is far shorter than you might expect, and therefore HS should have more value, as you won't really be starved on rage due to charge and bloodfury. Pre-36, my rotation looks something like:
---
Charge &gt; AA + Bloodfury &gt; HS &gt; HS &gt; HS/AA+Ex = Dead
---
Post-36, it looks like:
---
Charge &gt; Bloodfury &gt; Berserker Stance + Whirlwind &gt; Battle Stance + Mortal Strike/HS &gt; HS &gt; HS/AA+Ex = Dead
---
Incorporate crits into that and TTK is even lower. Also, if you are arms, it is always better to try and pull 2 mobs at a time and do:
---
Charge &gt; Bloodfury &gt; Sweeping Strikes &gt; Berserker + Whirlwind &gt; Battle Stance + Mortal Strike &gt; Cleave &gt; Cleave (or HS/Exe if 1 target is dead. Both targets might honestly be dead after the first cleave, or even MS).
---
It is worth noting that this is obviously for an Arms leveling spec, as I use a combination of Sweeping Strikes, Improved Charge for 6 extra rage on pull, and Improved Heroic Strike so it costs less rage. 
---
I also found this to be a bit faster to level since you can pull 2 mobs at once, kill them fast, then single pull, then pull 2 mobs again since SS is off CD, rinse and repeat. I find that I only need to stop and eat/bandage once every 3-4 pulls.
---
Is he in game? Wow head said he was added 1.13
---
Find some monsters that drop stackables. I watched a video that says they basically just grinded mid thirties for those stacks. Stacked by 10 about 60 or 70s max stack.
---
Yup, this is exactly my experience in Vanilla and BC.   Not to mention that skilled players would use more casual guilds as stepping Stones for attunement and resist gear, or just get bored if they weren't moving fast enough and you would lose all the investment put into that player when they jumped to a further progressed guild.  I wasn't hot about raiding (still not) but it's something I did to play my characters that is already but so much time and love into.  Wotlk was definitely the sweet spot for accessibility etc.  At the end of the xpac that's when the whole gogogo and gearscore culture took over and killed any sort of grouping for me.

HS crits aren't that much bigger - at level 36 for me, they're less than an extra 100 damage over an AA crit. 
---
But again, you're missing the second point - the extra Overpower procs are a huge benefit to this and you should have Improved Overpower talented. Your AA and HS are going to crit maybe 5% while leveling - Overpower is going to crit so much more with the talent! That easily outweighs the infrequent crits with HS.

No, please no fucking timed content. I am all for adding new stuff, but timed content is one of the reasons I am not an avid MMO player anymore (others would be flying, dailies and throughougly instanced worlds).

It was really cool in BC where you basically get the, "Who are you? Get out there we got demons to kill!" reaction when you first arrived. I actually liked that in Wrath they're like, "Oh, you've done some things I guess, you can skip the recruit line." By the end of Wrath and beyond though it felt like every lore character knew me after fighting in their (random) tournament and killing a God of death.

Sure but not when the profession is maxed. Then you're paying for what you want made.

No I will keep abusing it and I will keep playing until it‚Äôs removed from the game.

I've been dungeon grinding on my main because I need to hit 60 asap, this week, so its giving me good xp and I'm getting the gear I need for prebis, but thats only for my main. I need her leveled and geared for raids as soon as I can.
---
If you are new to this game or actually want to enjoy the majority of the content it has to offer, do not dungeon grind. My alt wont be, theres a decent chance my alt will only ever do 5-10 dungeons total on the way to 60 because I want to go back and experience and remember things.
---
If it wasnt such a rush to prebis for my main I'd be doing the same.
---
I ran Gnome yesterday with a friend. I as healer underestimates the range of those mines and died again immediately after using my soulstone. 10/10 would recommend!
---
Cherry on top: this particular situation occurred RIGHT AFTER I was told how this happened to another friend a day earlier!

Except neither healthstone or underwater breathing cost money to cast.

39 is really far ahead of the average player right now, you're not "only" 39 haha

My problem is that I can't navigate such a sprawling complicated dungeon without a map. Not sure if it's proper term in English but we call it topographical cretinism. When the tank has the same thing it becomes a hell.

I understand gating the raids/tiers to simulate a classic experience. But for a lot of people PVP is solely why they play WoW and people really loved the classic wow PVP experience. So them releasing WoW classic without any kind of pvp/honor/BG system in place is just odd.

Why let it bother you so much?

I really hope that from this wow classic experience blizzard learns what truly makes the community hooked up on wow. It's the small things as 1 level matters in killing a mob, a simple greenie with +2 intellect and is centered about leveling experience. Yes raids are awsome but leveling should mean something and classic surely embodies that
---
How do a prot warrior AOE grind? But nice try.
---
Just because they are using an alt code doesn‚Äôt mean they should be reported. There are up to 10 characters per server there are bound to be some crossover names. Only time someone should be reported is if they are using an alt code to have an offensive name.
---
I had this lol, made my PC a lot slower but I still kept it :D IIRC you could download it from the official Blizzard site

As long as you're wearing plate with stamina, you should be fine up to the level 50 dungeons.  You'll want a shield for some situations, but you won't regularly need one until late 50s.
---
Same though, I'm a lvl 26 lock with tailor/enchanting and I need level up to gather the materials I need, as opposed to my retail toons where I level up then buy my way to max level professions

Yes, engineering is a requirement from a min-max perspective, esp. for hunters. Hunters can FD/trink swap in raids, so you can bring battle chicken/the dragon thing, use them on CD, swap back to stat trinks after using. Plus, FD/cables is a great wipe recovery mechanic to help speed up the raid, and bombs are easy to weave into a hunter rotation.
---
Yes, enchanting is worth it. The only people that ever gold cap are enchanters. Hunters can just DE the BoP loot from dungeon spam to sell enchanting mats.
---
Only reason I'm doing it is for that Shield and a good 1H so I can respec Prot Paladin.

I'm at 40g on level 36...while selling all the cloth, leather and ore I can find...

I thought I would miss the meeting stone summon, but fuck that too. It is just redundant and takes away value from having a Warlock in the Group. Want summons, have a Warlock, want to open Locked Chests, bring a Rogue...

Using it too but have noticed some buggyness with the cast bars staying full after a cast etc.

I'll give it a go!

Thanks alotmate, lots appreciated!
---
Why not both? As others have said ravager is mainly a dungeoning weapon, while whirlwind (or bone biter or whatever else) is better for solo content. The extra stats help bring WW roughly on par with Ravager for dps, but the stam is good for survivability.  Also, can you dodge/parry while spinning with ravager? Or is it a channeled effect that makes you lose all of that? If you lose dodge/parry, it makes it WAY worse for solo content.

Just here for the gnome question (1). I am not a gnome. I have a hatred so deep in my heart for them that it burns. 
---
IME gnomes are rude, unsociable and downright nasty to the core. They always run around in little groups with other gnomes. When you ask for an invite for a simple hack and slash quest, that it is not loot dependant they simply ignore you. Unless your a gnome of course.
---
They ask you for invites for quests. You start of by saying to yourself, "sure why not give this little guy a chance. He might prove my opinions on gnomes to be wrong!" .... Twenty seconds later *gnome whispers "gotta go my friends are online now so I'm gonna quest with them instead" .... Sure... Run away little man.... Leave me here agrooed by the mobs you pulled and run off to your fellow gnomes as they are so clearly a superior race... (Sarcasm)
---
Gnomes are an arrogant race and I honestly just wish they would shimmy on off and fight for the Horde somehow because at least that way I'd be able to inflict damage on them. 
---
Also all gear looks like poo on gnomes.
---
That is all
---
I'm still confused....how?
---
Not sure about whispers, but you used to be able to use the /me (allows you to create custom emotes (which normally read as, X makes some strange gestures to the opposing faction)) but under MC the custom emotes would be readable. So you could MC someone and /me says "got your nose!" or something along those lines.

I can't help it if I tap to 20% and the healers OCD kicks in and he tops me off and wastes everyone's time. I have siphon life, drain life, and demon armor. By the end of the next pull I'll be &gt;70% again. just relax
---
Careful. Blizzard does ban waves for things they deem exploitative. And layer-hopping *is* exploitation. It's not (currently) against the ToS but it is using a system in a way that it was not meant to be used.

Gameplay and story segregation. Like how playable characters in RPGs only die in cutscenes.
---
Well I've leveled through questing and enjoyed the game before back in the day. With my main I kinda want to rush 60 so I can start raiding with my guild. I also plan to level and alt and enjoy the game, but for now I would like to get my main to 60 asap.
---
This is what I did originally but found it wasn't really needed at lower levels. Saved myself the bag space. Might start collecting but honestly I've had no problems so far healing and keeping up. I'm good on the big pulls and drink between fights as needed. All I've really needed to do far.
---
That's a very ignorant comment and as someone who has successfully healed every dungeon so far as a feral-druid with 3.5 second-cast time-heals I have more than enough reason to doubt what you say is even based on the reality of healing.
---
Hunter pets have really good armor values compared to anyone who is not a tank.
---
So let's say theres 3 mobs. One on the tank, one on the hunter-pet. Not because the hunter made a mistake but maybe because he saved your ass as a healer by offtanking a mob that broke lose.
---
It is very rare that I cannot keep up with healing throughput wise. Only happens on complete mispulls. Other than that mana-efficiency is my main-concern because not being efficient here increases downtimes. But healing a pet is clearly better for the overall success of the group than having the hunter use mend-pet or having the pet die.
---
Of course you don't heal the pet it if a player would die otherwise. But talking like it's always the choice between having the pet or the tank die is completely unrealistic compared to my experience.
---
It usually is no problem to keep tank and pet alive in the vast majority of situations.
---
Epic mount quests aren't in the game until phase two for pallies/locks.....RIP.

I found Gnomer fun, but not like spam run fun.

I used to have to lead the runs though so I guess that was a sign.

Even if you go full Tank you want at least like 11 Points in Arms so you build up resources infight. So until lvl20 you're not going for Prot anyways...
---
Also tanking with Ravager is superior!
---
And then you pass by three alliance players 20 levels higher than you who gank you out of nowhere.
---
No professions are must haves. All have different benefits. I got to rank 12 in vanilla as a skinner / Leatherworker. 
---
A hunter will be my 2nd class I level, and I'm definitely going engineering and enchanting. I can run instances for greens and BOP blues to get gear to DE....selling the enchanting mats on the AH to pay leveling engineering. 
---
Engineering means you can craft your own high end bullets, guns, scopes, as well as great PVP stuff, grenades, jumper cables, etc. 
---
Overall, engineering is great for a hunter.
---
Not at all for me. It is just ... WoW. Tho, might be because I played vanilla way too much and I might still simply be saturated ...
---
I'm playing on Stalagg which has a very healthy population (though still has queue times in the evening), and haven't once seen someone type in anything other than English.
---
Ok perfect that‚Äôs exactly what I wanted to hear ty
---
Nice read man a pretty well deserved victory!
---
Somehow, through decades, this never clicked to me.  I knew it as the dungeon you run to complete a few quests and get some good quick EXP, but never made the connection that the *reason* you don't find much loot in it is because, duh, what kinds of prisoners have a bunch of valuable loot???
---
I named my cat LUL...
---
i have yet to encounter a group that does even use a single CC...
---
no wonder i have to drink so much... 
---
but it works, so....
---
wait what
---
Big brain time
---
When I use it I can't copy quest names anymore :(
---
Priests have fun unless it's more than one. And they don't gank you when you're low on mana.
---
As a rogue, that dude was a jerk. Picklocking is part of my usefulness and if I lose the roll I'm still happily unlocking the chest for whoever won. I feel like this is just common decency
---
How did I not know? First time playing Horde
---
How do you teleport? I have no idea.
---
I'd be surprised if you manage to recreate the "first time" feeling while doing the exact same thing.
---
Nothing to do with money in a way, at least in the way you seem to mean: hunters go eng for DM solo trib runs.
---
Now maybe that won't work in classic, but if it does then all hunter will go engineering 100%. It's potentially a ludicrous way of making lots of gold fast.
---
Haha sorry. Get 2 mage friends that will let you tag along!
---
"I just inspected the rogue, and his dagger is GREEN! His DPS must be in the double-digits!"

---
I am 23. :P
---
I think you don't understand classic. You came and post somthing because a youtuber/streamer play it and you thinks if they have this i will play it. But the community, how was fighting to have vanilla/classic back, don't aprecciate any change (except fixing bug).
---
There's no set rule on etiquette so it's always best to set rules before or during a dungeon run. 
---
I'm a Blacksmith and used my key to open a chest I lost. Looted it all and traded it away to the person that won. It never really dawned on me that I spent my own materials for the keys (especially silver bars) and that I received nothing in return and to be honest, I don't care. In my experience, if you're a nice person in the game, karma will reward you later on. For example if it was an upgrade for me in the chest I'm sure the people I ran the dungeon with would have no problem trading that to me.
---
In another dungeon I was in, I was the only one who could mine iron ore so I received all the iron ore. I took the time leveling the profession and I will reap the rewards. 
---
All in all, in my opinion of course, for chests everyone gets a fair with their rolls but when it comes to gathering professions, if you don't have the profession level, you have no right, otherwise you take turns mining, herbing, skinning, etc
---
LMAO you can get your account suspended if you make a habit of filing lots of false reports.
---
I got an honor system when it comes to ganking, i never attack first, unless it's a Rogue.
---
Some classes cause more pain to their players while leveling then i could ever dream of inflicting.
---
Even in vanilla they made guilds with the best of the best and it was the 40 man pugs that were headless chickens. Close to 0.01% of players cleared Naxx40. Naxx was *hard as fuck.* Not just because of the mechanics, but because of the gear you needed. You need to be insanely dedicated to clearing the previous raids for gear sets. Geared warriors wouldn't just have a "Best In Slot" set, but need multiple sets for different fights. 25% of the raid at least would be subbed in and out to rebalance classes/teams for different fights.
---
I think much of this will be easier due to modern aspects like better PCs, solid internet connections and better documentation of specs, gear and fights. But I still think it'll end up being rock hard for the average players.
---
I just really hope the community doesn't get pissy/shitty as right now it feels like time has stepped backwards to where everyone is decent, friendly and helpful. I fucking hated the WotLK and the "link gearscore and achievement" approach.
---
&gt;The only timed content suggestion, Leagues, is 100% Opt In. 
---
I kinda went '#nochanges for a bit there and didn't even read far enough after reading "leagues". :D
---
Sorry.
---
Thanks! I meant to say I'll be supplying the mats such as linen/woolcloth and silk from my mage to level up tailoring on my priest for the Bis robe, but yeah I'm not sure if I should be trying to get that done asap to drop tailoring sooner rather than later for something else.
---
What I mean more is like a personal note system that can be shared between friends / guilds via links or something, shared by request only with tags like ninja,  toxic, bad player (for bad), then good heals, good dps, great attitude for good, and the. Kill on sight, or not bloodthirsty (or friendly enemy) , or group ganker for opposing faction type of notes.. I mention this in case it's easier on the programming to create this simplified notes system? Maybe also add a 5 star system to this? Someone toxic might still be a good player and it would be nice system at a glance?
---
Can‚Äôt wait to do this on my hunter.
---
Only retards care
---
Wow this is so washed out it looks under water.
---
Forgot about ungoro crater.
---
glad i'm not the only one missing this. sadly luna unit frames doesn't show them either
---
Someone did this in my guild the other day, they didn't get it after the first few tries.  People literally just started saying "leave" repeatedly until the guy FINALLY got it right...  It's now become a great inside joke within the guild!
---
Unfortunately, that's not the case, and that belief is the reason that the country's budget is so mismanaged. I don't want to turn this into a political debate, but money will always win. Eventually the system won't be able to run because there's no money. It's like the person who keeps opening credit cards, because up to X point there's been no repercussions for doing so. Eventually that trend stops. 
---
However, back to my original point, I did some more research to have hard facts, as I haven't actually looked at the data in probably 6 months. Social Security is expected to be depleted by the early 2030s, with the exact year varying depending on who you listen to, but I believe 2034 is the most often quoted.
---
I mean "story wise" yeah, presumably that dungeon should be full of dead people once you clear it. No need to run it again. In reality, of course we all run them multiple times, but that makes for a crappy story.

It's fixed now, just had to reset all my old Addons that had anything to do with maps/dungeons/raids whatsoever. After that I freshly installed:

Why would you need a arrow? Just look at the map and go to an icon?
---
Yeah im 44.5 atm and it feels like molasses. Started questing in badlands and felt like I ran out of quests pretty quickly. Guess I should go to STV or tanaris
---
Damn I wanted to run it by my friends who played vanilla said no way. I may run it at 42 just to see it now.
---
This happened yesterday. I was running down the road in ashenvale when a mounted human passed me. We /wave to each other. He went out of site and a gnome my level appears. Well, I‚Äôm sure you can guess what happened to the gnome :)
---
Obviously the RP realms would migrate to PvE servers and RP-PvP would migrate to PvP. Same rules that apply for normal transfers.
---
Is it still possible to MC and talk to the opposite faction?
---
No it's just super super good for *everything*.
---
It does make ammo though for hunters too.
---
Yeah for Portals I can understand it.
---
The school of our lord and savior.

One of the days I said in guild chat ‚ÄúI heard they‚Äôre targeting EU servers right now so I think we‚Äôre good for a bit‚Äù

If your prior trainer isn't referring you to a new trainer, then you're not eligible.
---
9 times out of 10, you're not going to generate enough rage to MS. It requires a big crit. Regardless, this is a tip for leveling. You're not going to have MS for most of that time.
---
I got a sidegrade from RFD last night, but it‚Äôs an upgrade because it‚Äôs a LOOOOONG CLOAK, not a toddler outfit stapled to my back
---
Classic Tim
---
This plus snowballs
---
It also doesn‚Äôt feel as grindy as I remember, because there are so many ‚Äúrun there‚Äù quests which move you and you can kill mobs on the way. They are annoying, but I guess they change the feel. 
---
Also there are many zones for each level and you are forced to moved zones because quests are very different lvl in the same zone. 
---
And instances are far apart which again forces you to move.
---
Wrong, we do. Fuck Swedes.
---
Upgrade &gt; AH
---
Though it's a bit contentious as private servers were often AH &gt; Upgrade so there's a lot of grey area.
---
Thats a nice advice for sure xD
---
Welcome... to HARD Hardmode Ulduar! (5 man)
---
Those were added in patch 1.10. IIRC, dungeons will have their loot tables as of 1.4, maybe 1.5? I honestly cant remember what the new info before launch said. But I know it included more than jsut the 1.2 loot tables.
---
It‚Äôs not irrelevant it adds to the time it takes to get the drops. Maybe it takes more kills maybe not but when in a group and the group kills at least you get XP and your less likely to get your target tagged by someone else.
---
Right? And this FORCES some measure of cooperation. Alright all the stuff I want only drops I. This area, all the stuff they want drops in this area, neither of us can do it alone so let‚Äôs work together and do both areas, plus we give you a little reward(group xp) to sweeten the deal! 
---
It‚Äôs so fantastic.
---
It's fine, I'll be close enough by 40 to get the mount, but I'm poorer than I could be because I want to be caught up and maxed on everything.
---
Most groups: everyone greeds and only needs if it‚Äôs an upgrade
---
Some groups: everyone needs sellable boes, ask before you start.
---
Let's not be ridiculous in our overstatements. BFA is arguably the worst expansion mechanically in WoW's history, but retail as a whole has a lot to recommend it and is still one of the most popular MMOs on the planet, and not without reason. It's just a very different game, in arguably a completely different genre.
---
Usually rogues are the ones most likely to be stealthing waiting for someone to get low from a mob for easy kill, so I'd say no.
---
Depends where you are at. Some areas just don‚Äôt have enough xp or it‚Äôs better to go to certain areas at certain times and they are just passing through to those areas and/or doing dungeons. Also, Undead start in the Eastern Kingdom.
---
Do you need to do this every time you refresh the UI or just once?
---
lol what a terrible example of when that is going to be used.
---
99% of the time it'll be used when looking for people to join the dungeon. You will always specifiy which part of it then.
---
The fact that you had to used such a useless example really shows how bad an argument you have. 
---
Your example doesn't even work, you are going to know your friends level so they wouldn't have to clarify between deadmins and dire maul.
---

Read this post yesterday. Tried replacing Heroic Strike with Sunder Armor as a level 26 "Arms" warrior. I was skeptical since I played warrior all through Vanilla, BC, and into WOTLK. I thought "I was young, but I couldn't have been THAT stupid back then." and I also thought "Doesn't Sunder require Defensive stance?"...well I got home and to my surprise I was incorrect on both of those fronts...**I am that stupid** and..no..**Sunder Armor does not have a stance requirement**..lol
---
I logged in and tested this out this morning...Sunder Armor is a much more effective spell then Heroic Strike for level grinding. Especially if you are rage starved during fights...the difference this change my rotation made was INCREDIBLE to mob kill speed, as such also in life remaining after kills. 
---
**Game...changer...**
---
Have you thought of buying a lottery ticket before?
---
I think you‚Äôre  giving me just a bit to much credit. I only undercut in small amounts to get my stuff sold, then I move on. Perhaps the ‚Äúpeople like you‚Äù you are referring to, are the ones simply leveling engy who make 10-20 of these things for skill points and dont want to just vendor them
---
Q and A?  Which one is left and which one is right? With A and D it's keeping it pretty similar to WASD but instead of having A and D turn, you change it to strafe (A for left, D for right).  So I guess A and D is more natural for a lot of people.
---
"I'm reroll into a rogue after my hunter, which was a disappointment."
---
why did it turn out as a disappointment? i consider rolling either hunter or rogue myself so I'm curious
---
I keep getting lost in fishing man, it‚Äôs like gambling with almost no risk.

DME =Dire Maul East

And then you can always ask for Tribute.

You don't ask for:"LFG for ET" when you want to do BRD do you?
---
Should have gone w/ The Rake for that tasty 1.2 attack speed.
---
Do you need to be logged in to share a macro?
---
Thanks. Unfortunately even though I followed classic very closely I somehow missed that on the forums and found out long after we started but before they recently started offering transfers. I'm bummed because I don't want to change names and it makes my participation in early naming completely pointless but it's a small price to pay to enjoy the game that much more.
---
A couple of them are fairly quick. Sfk can be done in under an hour
---
Can confirm they are reportable  I've reported at least 100 names by now.
---
Get an Owl*, Carrion Bird, or Bat. Screech is just completely overpowered.
---
Does the single target component do good damage? No.
---
Does the AoE debuff massively decrease damage taken? No.
---
Does the agro from the AoE debuff mean you can mend pet and multishot when you've got adds? Absolutely.
---
\* Horde: If you die in Rutheran Village before the portal to Darnassus, you appear at the Dolanaar Graveyard.

I have a rogue friend that I've run several dungeons with, and he's experienced the same issue. He's currently level 36, but he said it's becoming harder and harder to find groups the higher level he gets.

Full of Horde scum. Time to wipe out this slab of beef!

Man I love being a pally and decking myself out in whatever good gear I can get my hands on. Not having to worry about a mount until the level 60 quest chain is grand.
---
True, although for a bit of money you can instantly boost to 110(soon to be 120).
---
I just ask that the person that Need rolls on it equips it.  If they don't, then they are labeled a Ninja and word will spread.
---
So far, I have been in this situation around 4 times and all 4 times the person equipped it with the quickness.
---
This one right here is the dream.
---
Only the pets get thorns. Four buffs is too many.
---
The void walker benefits from Fortitude MotW, thorns and Blessing of wisdom.
---
Rest of the pets aren't meant to hold aggro, so you can just buff warlock instead.

---
shameless plug for me as an example but you get the idea. and when these links are shared via whisper or in guild chat or party chat or raid chat it updates the add-ons' notes based on this share? Also a +agree or -disagree button for when someone agrees with the rating or not? Adding names of players who agree to prevent doctoring of said notes.
---
Like: name_server_guild (+) or (-)

"my server was wrong 15 years ago so i'm going to be wrong today"

Artisan LW at lvl 27?
---
Kudos!
---
While i think rogues should open chests in dungeons, leveling lockpicking absolutely takes an investment of time and effort. It's kind of a pain to lvl to 300
---
As far as I understand it, in order to not have millions of players all fighting for the same thing (think when you logged in immediately after classic went live), players are sorted into what they call layers, it's basically (as I understand it) a slightly different version of the area you are in which may be dependant on a number of factors, including where you are in a specific quest chain.
---
Instead of all players being in just 'The Barrens', you will only see players in your layer, though you will be able to communicate with and group with players in other layers, you just can't see them until you are grouped. You may be in The Barrens L1 and someone in The Barrens L2. You could be standing in the exact same spot but will be unable to see each other and will see different mobs, different players and different resource nodes.
---
By grouping with people who are in other layers, you may swap to their layer (though they may swap to yours) and it may give you access to their layer's nodes and mobs. Things like mining nodes usually have fixed points so if you are able to find a few close together, you can mine your own L1 nodes, and then repeatedly group with other layered folk, mine their L2 nodes and then ungroup, group with someone else, mine their L3 nodes ... rinse and repeat for easy fast mining and hence lots of cash.
---
No you can't roll need if you plan on selling the item. Well, you could but will very quickly be blacklisted by a lot of players.
---
Golemagg and same, fucking hooray for actually playing when I want to not when I can.
---
Sorry I'm just excited for features I don't find programmers often
---
When I played priest in vanilla I had bars sometimes filled with 3-4 different ranks of heals. It's a major deal in end game content. Everyone can be oom except the healer and eventually the boss will die. (Except bosses who enrage fuck those guys.)
---
Dropping a random quest in a mid tier leveling zone isn‚Äôt going to impact your end game experience at all, that‚Äôs his point. Obviously if you drop an attunement quest you‚Äôre not going to be able to get the attunement until you go back and do it. As far as I‚Äôm aware none of the attunement quest chains require you to do anything to unlock the chain itself though. In retail practically each zone is comprised of one big quest chain where you have to complete all quests to move to the next town, and you have to complete all zone quests for achievements in order to progress your character into later game content.
---
sad that some people get so greedy about some innocent QoL helpful things like portals/food/water. I throw stacks of food n water at everyone who might need it when I'm out n about questing etc. Portals cost money per cast, it makes sense to pay at LEAST 21S to cover the cost of the reagant, and tip a little if you have the decency to show appreciation. We're all in this game together, lets be nice to eachother guys.
---
Doesn't swapping weapons trigger a gcd? That would make this strat pretty inefficient.
---
Odd? The original Vanilla WoW didn't have the Honor System or BGs until later patches, so you can think of it as "re-releasing" that content in a sense for Classic. Plus, I'm sure it gave them more time to work out any issues with those areas while letting us enjoy the rest of the goodness they've been able to produce.
---
It's a lot of micro-management even if you set it up properly. Sure you can just have 5 mages spamming frost bolt but if you want anything that resembles a diverse party you pretty much have to bind your entire keyboard. And things you have to click to use like blizzard is a pain because camera angles are hard to keep lined up.
---
I had been taunted by those damn lotus and their wild vine for two days and I finally had the slillups needed. 
---
I spent two STV corpse runs, and like 45 minutes, trying to get one purple lotus in STV. It was guarded by murlocs(hence all the dying) and if that was not one of the most satisfying feelings ever.
---
Fucking hero.
---
I don't know the answer to this, but if you do you could just make a macro out of it
---
Yeah I just then die if I might die. But I can rez so there's that.
---
Well, your server was wrong

Try WoW Classic
---
ive checked everytime i learnt new spells, no you dont have to manually place them.
---
I meant Q and E not A. Q is left and E is right of course. That's natural to me because it's the default that I've been playing for over a decade. Can't see myself changing it now, but I'd like to improve
---
What you are doing in putting your idiotic game preferences and play-style over mine. Being too stupid to tell that it's entirely subjective. 
---
"ooooo, i dont care about questing, y this man care about questies when me dont?? HEAD HURT WTF"
---
Yes, questing is a very enjoyable part of the game, it's pretty important to me, it's what I do a lot. When it's complete garbage and we are in a thread and conversation TALKING about questing, I will mention it's severe drop in quality. When some idiot walks up to me and tries to ARGUE with me about this, I will argue back and explain to him why they are wrong. 
---
Though you assume your shitty sub-human level fucking excuse for a brain just can't really wrap itself around these complex ideas. So please, do everyone a favor and fuck off somewhere.
---
Aww, so I'm not allowed to search for a guild on a tuesday then? :(
---
So managing my own fun is paternalistic?
---
Have you healed before?
---
If you heal a DPS that's overpulling then they JUST KEEP DOING IT. They'll moan at you for not healing them MORE too, even though you ran out of mana specifically because of them.
---
If they don't have the defensive stats and moves to absorb the damage then it all comes out of the healers mana bar and they don't have any left for the tank.
---
I think you're hearing people moan about shitty DPS and you're reacting as if they're talking about good DPS. The good ones aren't the problem lol.
---
Gonna swing my dick around a little here and mention my first shoulders were blue ;)

Kirtonos is a good choice if you want to stick to PvP/EST. Originally I was on Herod and I ended up on Kirtonos due to the queues chasing us around. You could also just start queueing via Teamviewer in advance before you get home. You can even use it through your phone.
---
I'm on Stalagg, another high pop server, and my solution has been Teamviewer. You install the teamviewer program, put the teamviewer app on your phone, and it lets you remote control your desktop from your phone.
---
If I'm not going to be home until late, I use teamviewer to enter the login queue an hour or two before I get home. It's really convenient.
---
No very simple, you just come across as a fucking cunt.
---
I usually tell them I love them first
---
Thats what I was doing, spam serpent sting and multishot. I dont know how far I was behind on DPS since I dont have a meter.
---
Which is ridiculous in itself. The whole warlock class is an ebb and flow of health to mana and mana to health. They sustain themselves as long as they don't pull aggro for the most part.
---
Your bank alt is the same level as my main. Damn you adulthood.
---
Feint is a move that 2005 me didn‚Äôt even know existed playing a rogue 1-60. This time around - been using it a lot.
---
I don't play on PvP servers, so this is a very uninformed answer but..... Isn't that the point of a PvP server?
---
- Cruelty alone is fucking amazing
---
- Piercing Howl is an absolute must have on PvP servers. It's your only chance to ever close a gap before intercept.
---
- Impale is an absolute garbage talent before you get some crit (axe spec/cruelty). It's a 20% bonus damage increase on yellow crits. So it's 10% more damage on a (roughly) 5% chance on half your attacks. A .5% DPS increase for 2 skill points.
---
- Deep wounds is also quite bad before you get some crit. 60% white hit damage without rage generation on a 5% chance is okay, but not outstanding. Definitely worse than Enrage. 
---
The real debate is Tactical Mastery and SS vs. Enrage and Flurry from 30-40. At 40, MS wins the race without any question.
---
WHAAAARGLGLGLGLGL
---
There are a good number of folks who play in character but for the most part its the same as any other server. The biggest difference I have noticed are the large RP events in major cities that guilds will put on throughout the week. There are only a couple a week right now because most folks are focussed on leveling but I expect a lot more down the road. Server: Grobbulus

Wish I could log in now. Tonight I will resume my journey but I am not sure I will be in Tanaris. Azshara is calling.

Redeidge is a popular ganking zone but I wouldn't be to to worried this early on cause we all just want to get to 60. But most of the people I know kill alliance on sight.

But Dire Maul isn't even in the game yet!

They chose to play a hunter.

As a warlock, a single frostbolt isn‚Äôt so bad.. We didn‚Äôt have a mage for decursr and I swear I busted an Amplify Curse Curse of Agony on them at least twice and just had to eat it, not to mention the immolate with corruption button being spammed immediately after the cast.. At least the priest could dispel those but we did Gnomergan at 28 so he was pressed for mana as is..
---
God that place was a nightmare, we managed to only wipe twice on the last boss though which came as a surprise. All for the tank/rogue‚Äôs sweet sweet dungarees..
---
Spots taken ;)
---
I‚Äôm only up to 30 doing that. It‚Äôs a nice place to relax.
---
The only thing I consider bad manners is corpse camping a much lower level player. People expect pvp on a pvp server, but getting camped by someone twice your level is just obnoxious and ruins the game.
---
do that again, I dare you, I double dare you! :'D
---
My guild master can be pretty grating, unfortunately and, not that long after the game was launched, he made a bit of a reputation for himself by making bad jokes on World chat and being generally obnoxious. A lot of people (myself included) found it rather amusing but the sheer volume of messages resulted in enough people being annoyed that they reported him.
---
Now, that's totally fair, but here's where things get a bit more sinister. At the moment he can't write a message *anywhere* (be it in General, Trade, wherever) without just being instantly reported again and, with no review, losing his ability to speak in the game.
---
You can watch the video to hear the story from his own mouth, but it's clear that Blizzard support don't even read appeal tickets and even automatically banned him simply for questioning what was happening.
---
Where I him, I'd keep my head down, but the abuse has reached a point wherein he can't even participate in the game (after his mutes lift) without just getting muted again because a core of people report him any time they see his name pop up.
---
Like I said, my guildmaster is obnoxious, but isn't this clearly an indicator that any system with no human review on the part of Blizzard is open to abuse? Make a minimum of five enemies and they can keep you perpetually unable to communicate in a game that's about communication.
---
I'd really love to see a return to Blizzard's old GM system where you actually spoke to a person who was ingame with you, rather than some call center operative.
---
Hunter is the worst with this since auto shot will just pull with no regard. Know from my old vanilla huntard experience lol
---
this is way too funny.  i don't have much interest in rogue but it sure does look fun at times.
---
I'm interested in joining. How do I go about applying?
---
Well crap, now I feel dumb. Did that quest and picked the other reward, since it vendored for more and neither item was useful for my character. Having never played vanilla, I didn't know these sorts of items were a "thing".  To Westfall it is, I guess.
---
My favorite so far was my Nightelf rogue doing his class quest. Supposed to pickpocket a satyr, and if you get caught he summons 6 adds and beats your face in. Sneak up perfectly behind him and... *resist*
---
Oof.... HYYAAAACK!
---
It isn't efficient unless you pick up the 10% instant cast reduction and the 15% renew healing talents; then it's pretty close.
---
There are a few advantages to renew though: It adds to HPS if you're in fights where there's just too much damage, and it is instant cast. So if you heal the tank to full, you can throw a renew before you stop casting and it doesn't really increase your downtime for the 5 sec rule.
---
Also, with spell batching, you can do a gheal/renew and then go back to drinking as you enter combat. It's a nice trick for combat healing in cleave/farm groups.
---
EXPOSED
---
yeah isnt HS a rage dump?
---
only the american ones
---
Because I'm indecisive about which realm to join so I thought of posting it here and just join the realm of a nice stranger that invites me to join a guild. :)
---
/target Kryme-
---
/cheer
---
I mean I'm 90% sure your going to get a lot worse than a 48 hour mute for abusing game systems to grief players lol
---
To be fair, it'd be stupid if all of them saw you like a random soldier when you've saved the world more than five times already.
---
At least kul tirans and zandalari don't care about your past which makes sense lore wise.
---
Does curse of recklessness work? It stops runners.
---
Maybe it's my own personal experience, but I haven't had this much of an issue as I did in vanilla. In fact, I'm noticing more and more healers using dps spells/skills or auto-attacking/wanding. I think more healers understand this more than they did 15 years ago.
---
That‚Äôs okay
---
I found 10 guys and I have highlighted 8 bows at once:
---

Ughh... closing down a banks online/mobile banking would be FAR more devastating and trolling than some video game...
---
People literally would not be able to use their Debit cards, Mobile deposits, sending money, withdrawing from ATMs...
---
These have REAL consequences.
---
As a mage I made a grand entrance with a frost nova yesterday in the Duskwood catacombs only for the person to bail and leave me holding the bag.  Managed to extricate myself from the situation OK.  Actually I pulled a bunch of people‚Äôs asses out of the fire around there, that place can be kind of a shitshow.
---
Yeah no doubt. Thank you man I appreciate it. 
---
Are you a hunter player? I can‚Äôt figure out if the bow or gun is the better choice at the end of the quest. I‚Äôm a Nelf so my initial thought is the bow, but I could be wrong haha. They have the same DPS, but the gun has a higher high end number.
---
Ah yes it just needs some horde bois standing on Nelf corpses to make it truly beautiful :)
---
[World of Warcraft naming policy](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/34530) 
---
Character Naming Rules
---
The character name must be between 2-12 characters long.
---
Accented characters are supported.
---
Numbers and symbols are not supported.
---
Mixed capitals and spaces are not supported.
---
It's a keybind to hide the user interface
---
Yeah bud, gonna need a link
---
ok thanks
---
I agree, just be upfront about it though. I would have had no problem healing a half-run if it wasn't a hidden objective.
---
I'll DM you
---
The sole fact that the system does not let you put numbers in your name, but allows you to put special characters in is enough proof. If blizzard did not want people to make names with special characters, they would make it so their software does not allow it.
---
Well your gimping your chances for a new chest to spawn, at least throw it out of the box and destroy it.
---
You have a source for the centaur tents being made out of tauren skin? I know they have tauren heads hanging
---
Another easy way to be able to afford your mount is to stop buying skills at level 30.
---
I didn't have to farm or anything at all.
---
Adding to that, you do not really need new ranks of Kick, Gouge, Feint (arguably later on), certain poisons (as you'll only be using 1 for PVE), etcetera.
---
So other peoples names offend you that much you report them for alt characters. You seem to be new to WoW
---
We're talking about having a god complex and here you are trying to be the arbiter of who lives and dies and who deserves to receive your heals and all sorts of other bullshit. You fit the mold to a T.
---
No, but I like the Allstate mayhem commercials where they say ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù back and forth like 10 times.  I was trying to get that going.
---
Unless you step into Opposite faction territory; There is no PvP really. You can flag yourself, and others can flag themselves... but unless you engage you'll be untouchable. Not many flag themselves unless they have at least one other hidden friend around ready to gank you... it's usually a trap. Your faction and contested areas are all friendly. There generally isn't much world PvP.
---
To train yes, but not to cast them. But its tue, i wouldnt teleport/create a portal to someone if they dont pay the price for it or if im ok with spending the money. 
---
Doing it and then expecting the other to tip for it just feels stupid. Set a price for it before you actually do it as then there wont be any problems.
---
Red is dead, the cycle of life.
---
Yep, that‚Äôs right.
---
It adds your healing power to the total healing done.
---
So max rank renew does 970 over 15 sec (194/tick) If you have 1000 +healing, it'll make it 1970 healing over 15 sec (394/tick).
---
I would prefer a low buff over no buff
---
!who (name) to trigger app to whisper updates?
---
Gravediggers get out!
---
Ah, I never really got to experience those as I started mid BC and didn't hit level cap until after WotLK was announced. I was thinking more MC as a raid or boss mechanic.
---
It's been an hour and I'm almost leaving for work, is it out yet?
---
Nobody ever thought classic was a perfect game.
---
Only if they're playing an ugly race.
---
The amount of down votes on anything positive on this thread is embarrassing lmao
---
You mean lore?
---
WotLK was the end of the story line. They just kept going because of money.
---
They're a little bit gear dependent like Warriors, but they have a fantastic TTK (pretty much unrivaled on single targets) and the ability to completely bypass a lot of nuisances. Try wanding or auto attacking everything to death on a Priest or Paladin and you'll feel the true pain of a slow leveling class.
---
It really depends on the group I think, even if the tank is using a 2h if they maintain aggro and the dps is good I usually won't have to drink that often, plus while if they pull sensibly you drink during the start if pulls which lowers downtime as well.
---
When they fail to hold aggro, overpull, run out of los/range while you're drinking, group dps is low etc is when it becomes and issue
---
The amount of times people have just stood there and watched me bubble and try to run away from *their* mobs, all because I healed them....
---
Sorry, not tabbing out of full screen WOW, just to find where the screenshot saved and upload it to reddit just because some people cant take seeing pixels or lower resolution images...
---
 I can just whip out my phone, take a pic directly from the Reddit app and post, plus then its available in my google cloud backup drive to share on any other app I wanna share it on.
---
Talk about a god complex.
---
"This guy doesn't play the game the way I like to play the game. Therefore I won't heal him!"
---
Get over yourself.

Sorry mate not me. My name is a reference to the Author of the book Pimp: The Story of My Life. Perhaps your comrade was referencing it too :)

warlock tried to fear me off the boat last night.  thankfully it sent me down the stairs instead.
---
IDK, none of those complaints are things that bother me in the slightest, different strokes and all...
---
gaylord fokker :D
---
It seems everyone is a little more considerate as well. I suspect a bit comes from the slower pace for questing, the fact that you don't phase out to never see a person again, among other factors. It feels beautiful and it's odd to see classic feeling like vanilla did. I thought we'd have the same level of careless douchebaggery from retail, but it seems in this case the gameplay promotes socializing which is what became a missing factor the further down the rabbit hole the game has gone with phasing and the quick reward system.
---
Yeah, theory confirmed... Damn shame.

Holup, There is a reason for this. Sometimes I don't know what I want to name my pet yet. Sometimes I have to wait until inspiration strikes. Naming is the hardest thing for me. It's literally why writing code at work takes me extra time. I have to name everything perfectly! Don't rush them, they will name that pet when they discover who that pet is! Maybe that pet is "DoesntGrowlRight" Or maybe its "SwitchesToPassive" or possibly "LetsHordeMurderMe". Dont rush me man I got this!
---
I mean both games have flaws and both have positives, I'm currently enjoying classic alot, and like you I'm older, kids and all but just doing it at my own pace.  And I get what you mean with the kids having more time, but for me its all about PVP so i'm sure I can make it work.  The social is fantastic, the difficulty is just right to attract people to group up and everyone is generally friendly, that family atmosphere is kind of there.  
---
I like the talent tree's, the ranks and the way professions matter.  I used to find on BFA there was so much to do, I wouldnt actually do anything or too much to focus on, where its streamlined and better in my opinion for me personal needs from the games.  Private servers have been going for a while with a strong player base, so I can't see that happening here.  I can see a good healthy mix for both, patches and expansions will draw players to both.  I think the last part for you is, well it depends what the devs decide to go at the end, do they go TBC, do they add new content to classic?
---
Had a bald gnome leave our DM group right before we got on the boat and we couldn‚Äôt kill the last boss without him. His name was Cancerboy, and he‚Äôs on my shit list now.
---
Do you play a dwarf for fear ward or because you want to play the ugliest race in game?
---
If you only played in TBC, then you missed out on the awfulness that was casual vanilla end game.  Let me paint a picture for you.  I had commitments meaning I couldn't manage the regular schedule of hard core raiding especially with the expectation of farming consumables as well as running raids.
---
At level 57 or so I was able to start on LBRS and Strat, once I hit 60 I could add Scholo and try for a PUG capable of clearing UBRS.  And, well, that was it.  That was my end game.  I hit 60 in summer 2005, and TBC came out 18 months later.  The reason I couldn't get to MC was nothing to do with skill.  The problem was I wasn't part of a guild that could field a 40 man raid.  I couldn't commit to the schedule that "raiding guilds" demanded, so I didn't go.  Enjoy your 4 instances for a year and a half.  Want to PVP? Well you're up against players who have been able to get into those raids, and their gear means they can one-shot you.
---
TBC was an absolutely huge change. Once you had the basic end game instances down, there were heroics that were both properly hard and had decent loot.  Then there was Kara, that only demanded 10 players, but but had much more of the experience of actual raiding. for the "serious" guilds, 40 man was gone, with 25 man (oh the drama on forums about that change destroying raiding guilds).  That meant there was a  much smoother progression of basic 5 - heroic 5 - 10 - 25.  That meant suddenly someone like me who was in a social guild that could count on perhaps 8 end-game players on an average Sunday night could actually progress through heroics and (with a bit of friends list) into Kara.
---
From that perspective it is understandable where the motivation for LFR came from.
---
The creativity and hilarious-ness of the classic community never ceases to amaze me.
---
It's not for everyone. The things people complain  about in the linked posts are the reason I love the game. They are annoying, you have to deal with dumb people and assholes, and things aren't handed to you. This is what makes it rewarding, this is what makes it an adventure, no 2 people will have the same experience ever because "the main character is the world."    
---
These same complaints existed 14 years ago and as they were addressed we slowly got to retail where it's mindless smooth sailing and upgrade everywhere you look until the absolute hardest content. Take the bad with the good, that's what makes it interesting
---
If you did this as Alliance on most PvP server you'd never get anything done. Horde have a substantial population advantage, so all they have to do is bawl in zone chat and you're quickly outnumbered.
---
I typically only care at about 60%. If it's more than a single flash heal can take care of then I'll toss something out. Less than that you are just wasting time/Mana.
---
Shit. I'm in a guild run by Swedes...

Your dwarf looks like he's late for dinner at Bilbo Baggins' place.
---
I think of it as exploiting and spamming, which is why when the Message box popped up I specifically stated he was spaming me asking for a group to get to a different layer.
---
I toss hots on lock before going into bear so they can lifetap lol.  Seemed to help the healer since they kept drinking
---
It's not so much because you need it early on. It's so that as soon as you find that you DO need it, you already have a semi-decent set ready to go.
---
Yeah, I agree. To be honest he took things a bit too far in those early days. But the point is that even if he were to choose to totally reform and never speak again, he just gets reported the moment he's spotted by those people he originally ticked off.
---
So should he just delete his character or what? :/
---
Not your fault from the sound of it. As a tank it's generally a good idea to use your ranged weapon to pull, so that you don't aggro other stuff and so you can pull mobs back. Then, when they flee/get feared, they don't run into as much stuff.
---
The older much wiser trollier me thinks it's hysterical. The fresh WoW me that barely knew the way a PvP server worked hated it. Now I just shrug it off and keep on trucking if shit like this happens, cause to be honest I know I'm gonna just do the same shit to someone else.
---
I'm on Skullflame In a full Swedish guild called "StarkaM√§n".
---
That's a good question. I subbed to musclebrah during beta and downloaded his addon folder as a sub perk and Lorti was in there. I have been using this same version ever since. I wonder if he just used retail version and it works just fine, I know a lot of UI addons seem to work okay for both (you'd have to manually download it and put it in addons folder for classic of course). If not though I could probably copy my Lorti folder and upload it online and send you a link, just PM me to remind me and I'll try to do that.

---
Not sure
---
I love that stuff on warlocks, I wish muscular orc warlock was a thing.
---
Shame that game didn't make it. I was really looking forward to leveling up a guy leveling up a mage.
---
You haven't been in any melee cleave dungeon groups whole leveling?
---
Unfortunatley you cant just force and squeeze Battle Royals into every game.
---
Especially Classic WoW where the whole motto was #NOCHANGES.
---
 Maybe in BFA... But nothing will be added to classic WoW, that's what the new expansions are for.
---
I can‚Äôt run down a deserted road in the middle of nowhere without getting buffed up the ass.  Maybe it‚Äôs your server.
---
TBH I think it‚Äôs an easy enough culture to start, just get a few friends to regularly do it in high pop areas, if people have it happen to them a few times they might start thinking it‚Äôs the norm and do it themselves.
---
Funny, I maxed mining in RS2 doing somewhat of a quasi-ironman back in the day.  I mined mithril, addy, and coal all the way to 99.  I always enjoyed it. But then again, runescape brings out the masochist in me.
---
I mean, I get that one could just conclude with "play stupid games, win stupid prizes," but what should you do if you find yourself in the position that you're being repeatedly muted just on-sight? If you completely stop engaging and yet are still targeted, that's obviously abuse.
---
And I appreciate you don't want to watch the video, but fairly early on he describes his contacts with Blizzard and how it was eminently clear that his messages weren't being read. He was just getting copy-paste responses and default extensions to his muting simply for contacting them.
---
I mean, I appreciate that this is his word against theirs and all, but it at least highlights a potential issue that should be watched more closely on our part.
---
Damn boomers cant hit level cap in retaand think classic will be a cake walk lmao
---
This guy models
---
Whats ur tech stack
---
Is there? AFAIK Gift of Arthas is on a PPM system.
---
two handers dont hit fast so there's little value to it. booming voice lets you keep your shouts up, which will save you rage in the process and have your offensive shouts hit more enemies.
---
You know working? Because i can tell you, loads of people do working during the day. Its mostly pretty boring but you do get rewarded with real life gold (called money, Euro in most places EU).
---
That RL gold is required to buy food and stuff (just like in the game) but also to rent a home so you have a place to sleep ( sleeping is pretty much Real life logging out)

Because it is roleplaying. You're playing the role of another character. You dont like that, dont play them, but still doesnt make them not RPGs.

Wanding the whole way down isn‚Äôt worth the time to me. I do just wand if I have a party though. 
---
I haven‚Äôt done math around that but I‚Äôve somewhat confident that the time to regenerate the spent mana is less than the extra time needed to kill with a wand. I usually end a fight with 50-70% mana remaining with my strategy. 
---
Although, I would have move mana in reserve to heal when I get low, so it might be less dying ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You can eat and drink simultaneously.

I had no queue yesterday but there was an ungodly amount of people online and in game, took me an hour to do a kill quest in stonetalone with a group because there were so many of us

You think you cant quest because of too many people? You're in for a real treat.
---
As a lvl 41 with barely halfway to having enough gold for a mount this quest reward gives me hope.
---
Oh, I just realized your using a Hotspot or 4G device in general.  I do not know if there is a fix for this.  The hotspot is going to dictate your TTL and it will be out of your control.  Unfortunately due to the exploit used in the attacks, hotspots in general were one of the items that got blocked just like default Linux systems.
---
Does your hotspot support IPv6 in it's settings? This might mitigate the issue, also Google your model and see if anyone has found a way to change the TTL.  Alternatively, can you run it on a normal ISP or a friend's connection in the mean time?
---
I even had 8g left for a respec and a few key spells! Didnt train a single skill from 30-40.

Okay I'll keep that in mind!

And it's indeed horrible that people use words as 'spastics' or 'cancer' so freely while there are other people and their loved ones who are suffering because of this.

6 quests, good loot for nearly everyone though. Gnomer has like 3 Horde quests and awful loot.

Angular8, Express, MySQL
---
That's good to know. I'm an enchanter also so I'll have to decide to disenchant or to vendor
---
This is what i've been seeing in practice while leveling.  I'll often play around with mobs seeing how much sunder armor impacts the fight and how much HS impacts the fight.  Whenever fighting any mob close to my level or just under sunder armor is such a waste.  I might use 1 and leave it at that, but they're always dying before I can really stack it.. and they could've died faster has I just been using HS.
---
I just killed mobs for a whole level the last 2 days to get a rare recipe to have a benefit over the competition. And I never felt like I was wasting time because I got exp, gold, loot and in the end the recipe.
---
I always at least toss a Renew while passing by, if someone's close to dying I stop to heal.
---
Only times I don't buff or heal are people with obnoxious names or people who overpulled out of greed. If you make the conscious decision to tag 4 mobs so no one else gets quest kills, better be prepared to solo 4 mobs.
---
Not really. It's just not worth it to have it on yourself. I'd rather another player save their Mana than buff me with something that isn't useful.
---
Lemme give you some tips that I gave another poster. Tanking can appear hard at first but in general its really easy. Feel free to PM me if you want and I can respond as work allows. I recommend leveling Arms for Tactical Mastery. You do NOT have to be Protection to tank while dungeon leveling.
---
1. Use "Spatial Awareness"
---
2. Charge in if you can and then switch to defense stance, otherwise ranged pull.
---
3. Use keybindings for stances. Less clicking = less time lost clicking = more time spent focusing on tanking
---
4. You'll want nameplates on, this helps you see information at a glance so you aren't looking up at the portait and tabbing around...
---
5. I always demo shout first thing. Otherwise a priests renew, heal, etc.. could pull the mob off of me.
---
6. Use Bloodrage like its going out of style. Helps generate needed rage for pulls, etc..
---
|[NeatPlates](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/neatplates)|I use this for coloring  the plates based on threat. It also adds the debuff above the nameplate. This allows me to quickly see mobs that I've lost threat on and allows me to select and taunt it back.|
---
* If a mob is potentially going to do a lot of damage, I'll disarm them if I can see their weapon.
---
   * This allows me (while tanking) to Press 6 \[Taunt\] and then F1 and 6 \[Mocking Blow\] on a different mob.
---
* Keybind raid icons to num pad or function keys. This lets you quickly mark targets for CC or kill priority.

* Taunt puts you at the top of the "threat list"
---
* Mocking blow is basically a timed taunt, when it runs out the mob should go back to what it was hating before you, unless you surpass the threat of that person.
---
* When you first get in the open area, you can "/target Lady" to target Lady Anacondra so you can mark her with Raid icons (skull, etc..) so you know where she spawns.
---
New expansion? Newer than what, there haven‚Äôt been any expansions yet.
---
Just get ShareX, it's like snipping tool but auto uploads to imgur and puts the link in your clipboard.
---
I always resurrect hunter's pets, because a lot of time people don't know you can do it and watching their reactions is priceless.
---
Gold and Cloth just like other humanoids
---
Just do it lol it‚Äôs not like insanely difficult just use a map that shows level ranges for zones and go to zones when appropriate and probably leave to another zone and come back later when the quests get too high level.
---
Rlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrlrl-rlah
---
ok thanks.
---
They did eventually, then I logged off for the night
---
People ran out of things to get angry at Blizzard about, so they turned their impotent rage to the fact that Blizz said they would change player-skeletons.
---
In what way did they change them? Well, back in Vanilla one player could die again and again and leave a skeleton at each of the places he died, they wouldn't despawn for a long time. Now Blizz made it so skeletons despawn once the player died again, so every player could only leave one skeleton at a time. That's why people raged at Blizzard.
---
To be this dense, yikesssss
---
For some reason I read this in Matt Berry's voice
---
I liked the medal system actually, but I think it should have influenced the amount of loot at the end rather than the quality. That way you're still rewarded for skillfully executing the dungeon, but aren't absolutely denied if you mess up slightly.
---
I think they could have nerfed the raid attunements from gold to silver or something, but I wasn't against the entire concept personally. I was lucky enough to be good and have a similarly good group of friends to clear content with though, which I'm sure makes all of the difference.
---
&gt;You defeated all those enemies with 25-40 other people
---
Not only that, but I literally wasn't there for half of these things. I skipped a few expansions, and parts of others. Other great heroes killed the Lich King and Deathwing, not me. Others took on Garrosh, not me.
---
It‚Äôs correct - shaman and Paladin were both pink in vanilla.
---
New and newer are not the same word.
---
Only thorns melee classes and pets
---
And people said that BC had the clown suits.
---
I am severely macro challenged, this could be a god send!
---
Wha-
---
We need to talk about your skill bar.
---
Green quests offer full XP.
---
I didnt mean to but this just blew my head off reading this. Yes, thats exactly what you have been doing at the first place havent you? Guidelines are just a bit more optimized for efficiency but its pretty much the same. Are you horde or alliance?
---
Easy fix for this is playing the superior faction.
---
you brought shame to the horde, you are exiled!
---
I think you really need sweeping strikes before you can start cleaving effectively.
---
Sure, I agree that he took it too far. But his current issue is the fact that he's just getting banned on-sight even when engaging with the game normally. It's just repeated muting after muting.
---
Obviously if you play stupid games you win stupid prizes, but what is he supposed to do now? Delete his character? For the sake of approximately five people?
---
What about Badlands? Would that be a decent spot as well?
---
You need to pull or the mobs arent going to focus you and you won't have the rage you need to keep aggro. You need to be the one to pull
---
Mark a skull target and an X target. Dump all your revenge procs into the skull target and start building some threat on X once skull is halfway or less.
---
Your only AoE threat abilities should be battle and demoralizing shout. Use battle shout when there are more melee party members than mobs. Use demo shout when there are more mobs than party members
---
Dont spec into protection. Fury or arms is better until raiding, but you definitely should be using a shield in defensive stance when tanking
---
Look at this alliance joker, standing up straight like a woman.
---
I dont believe you.
---
shadoweave set starts at lvl 32 up to 40 something
---
I used to think this but playing as a mage now 30-40% of my time is spent conjuring or drinking. We hate anything and everything water
---
Didn‚Äôt get the flight path either. As soon as I got the expert fishing book a bunch of horde saw me as the wounded gazelle and decided to have some fun. 
---
10/10. Would spend an entire IRL day swimming there again.
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs true or not but I remember reading somewhere that in original wow there were actually no shadows they used different colors on the ground to make it look like shadows
---
Yep definitely, the only problem is that spec is pretty much only good for farming so you'll have to respec again to do anything else seriously. Having either 10% more dmg from succubus sac or the health regen from VW sac would help a ton .
---
I planned on getting my alt exactly to 35 to max out alch so this is good to know lmao
---
Weird. You may have been cured by a passing druid, or it's justclassicthings.
---
Haha you are so wholesome
---
He said these are three examples. Read the post more thoroughly, perhaps. In any case, we don't need him to provide his own examples. We can see this for ourselves in every other comment and thread here as well. It's predictable that in a few months the chorus of people demanding ret become a viable specc etc will increase.
---
If you power leveled to 41, you didnt quest in the bad lands. Go to the bad lands. Its a great  map for your level. Find it in your guide and go there
---
xD
---
Honestly yes always!
---
"You can't interact with that in Shapeshift form." 
---
Literally can't even turn in quests because the quest giver assumes they're about to be mauled to death before you turn back into a sweet gentle cow.
---
&gt; 10 years ago, I was one of the folks who wanted that.  But now I don't.
---
Yeah, both Blizzard and the vanilla gamers have learned a lot of lessons about adding too much "quality of life" to a game.
---
Honestly, I hope more MMO's reset the way that WoW did
---
Dear Warriors, as a Prot Paladin tanking dungeons, please don't go all in within the first few seconds.
---
No are you stupid lmao, a lot of PvP matchups fundamentally rely of hunter deadzone to even be balanced. Also why do hunters need buffs, they are an extremely consistent PvE and PvP class?
---
Been maintaining my farm runs pretty consistently since Classic's release.  Herbs, hops, and Hespori mainly.  Definitely worth it.
---
It was quite dark as IIRC it had a permanent night cycle in the instance so we never saw it in daylight, but it was pretty dark and gloomy. Lush, sure, but certainly not vibrant.
---
Same issue with me. I'm sure this is just a maintenance issue because I can see it installed on my computer.

---
We couldn't find a tank for scarlet Monastery cathedral.
---
We asked the arms warrior to tank with a 2 hander. Cleared entire dungeon no problem.
---
Especially for these leveling dungeons, I don't know why people are so stuck up about roles, specs, and equipment people choose to use. This is exactly how things were done in 2005 too.
---
The key to good tanking is understanding threat and aggro. Also managing your rage. . .You should google "WoW classic Threat" or "WoW Vanilla Threat" and read a few of the guides/articles. (Reason I didn't link any is because they all read slightly differently, some guides look wierd, others were useful for me. I can't seem to find my favorite one anymore.)
---
But a couple of High level points:
---
* Aggro is harder to take back then it is to start with. So if someone else has Aggro, then you have to generate More threat than them to get it back. .not just a little more threat, a lot more threat, which is generally hard since you're geared to take damage and they are geared to DO damage.
---
* You gain rage by taking damage. So if you do the initial pull the more people hitting you the more fury you get.
---
* Learn a ranged weapon. . use it to pull if you don't think you can face pull without pulling too many. You don't even have to hit with it.
---
* All shouts generate threat. Battleshout generated more threat with the more party members you hit with it. . .A good way to generated a lot of initial threat, is to do your ranged pull, run back to your casters, cast battleshout, then run back and meet the oncoming mobs.
---
* Don't be shy with your BloodRage, you have a healer, and early on Rage is a serious issue, so just spam that thing. Don't be shy with it. You burning HP for rage to keep threat will save your healer more mana than him having to heal some clothey that took aggro.
---
* Defensive stance Generates lots more threat then any other stance. However you generate less rage. Tactical Mastery can save you by stance dancing to generate rage, and back to generate threat. A typical opener is to charge mobs, use the charge rage to thunderclap, hop to defensive, Demo shout. . then start sundering everything.
---
* Lastly, it benefits everyone if you're new to tanking to just slow down. Communicate it, "I'm new, let's take it a little slow." Mark the targets you want to dps first so you can concentrate keeping threat on those one's.
---
We all realize that. Just that when you come in somewhere and say "it's only hard if your bad LOL!" 100% of the time people are going to look at you like Bobsponge here.
---
Lol yup
---
Shadow leveling post 40*
---
Pre-40, shadow abilities are pretty lackluster outside of spirit tap. IMO I'd go disc after spirit tap, and respec at 40. However, in a duo que doing a smite spam holy build is probably not terrible; you don't need the added tankiness of shadow, and smite is pretty good at sniping last hits for spirit tap. 
---
Make sure you work with your wife to let you last hit, so that you can get the spirit tap proc.
---
Sounds like you have some traumatic past experiences with these guys.
---
The tank is your main priority. Let them die if they are going to be dumb and expecting mass heals after Life Tapping or drawing aggro at low HP or getting hit by AoEs. They'll learn fairly quickly. The tanks dies, you are far more likely to wipe.
---
Ha took me a second but I get his joke. ‚ÄúThree cheers for Timothy‚Äù
---
those people have a fear of missing out disorder. they need to play because of it, but rather have everyone not play so they dont have to miss out on it.
---
Did this yesterday lmao
---
How the hell is asmongold streaming and playing DURING maintenance???
---
Yeh vacations over adults have to work. I‚Äôm hitting 60 this weekend hopefully.
---
Holy shit, I'm level 47, and I kinda knew it replaced my auto but never registered the loss of rage. Wish I knew this earlier. Great post.
---
Please tell me which one of the sources is correct then.
---
Arcane shot POWERRRRR
---
Oh, I love Dos2. But, as you said, not open world MMO, which is different feel.
---
I concur that 100 quests is ideal.
---
You should have essentially zero downtime with a priest unless you are doing multi-mob pulls. Follow a wand progression guide and keep your wand up to date. Shield &gt; Mindblast &gt; SWP &gt; Wand until dead &gt; Repeat. Priest is not the most efficient leveling class but it's certainly not terrible either.
---
Isn't that cheating? Feels unethical.
---
me too
---
Allow me to clarify: I am not suggesting a re-tuning of difficulty. What I am suggesting is the *removal* of nerfs that was implemented throughout Vanilla as catch-up mechanics by making PvE easier. This is the difficulty we have gotten and seemingly will get in Classic; content that is nerfed to the teeth to make it much easier to plow through.
---
Nah. Literally just stated in the ticket reply that it was because the DDoS, it should go away, I should try again, and connecting through a VPN shouldn't cause a suspension/ban, and that I should try that...
---
The same patch they did this they increased xp gains from 20-60... nope.
---
you will have such little +int via gear that divine int doesn't really help you much.
---
Yes and no. I don't think Undead could use the light in the lore, and speaking of which why can't I use exorcism against them as a paladin?
---
There were some lore cuts to protect gameplay, there had to be.
---
This is classic ofc it's normal
---
38 - was doing a dungeon with buddies, and honestly, its like 45 seconds when i OOM - absolutely horrible. On the plus side I still do the most damage even when afk drinking half the time.
---
Mine is only looking for retail at the moment. No dropdown to select Classic.
---
A severe case of "git gud."
---
Well... victory or death I guess.
---
Hi, /u/Fjoppy

---
Learn how to kite.
---
100% agree with what they said. If you want to be tanking and want to be taken seriously, you should be playing Warrior.
---
I totally get the sentiment as I have played Paladin since Burning Crusade, but Holy is the only "real" raiding spec for Paladin in Classic. That does change in the next expansion (if they decide to go for it), but for now it's the sad truth.
---
I just can‚Äôt connect to battle net at all maintove is over tho? I thought it was still on
---
same problem
---
Probably was an add on doing /who and spam inviting.
---
Four people have now linked you the source stating character names with alt characters are allowed.
---
So keep reporting these names and enjoy getting your ban for wasting GMs time.
---
Why are you stirring up random bullshit? Just play the game.
---
Yea fucking deleted wow somehow? Thought I was retarded and did something but maybe not
---
A better artist than I should make a comic of someone repeatedly mashing a mage's nose yelling "VEND WATER! VEND WATER!" and the mage is pissed until he perks up like he's laying an egg and then conjured water drops out of his butt.
---
I think only on Normal servers can you have Horde and Allies. I do know I had a buddy who on a PvP server had two accounts. One was Horde and the other Alliance. Don't know why until I realized he was farming items hard to get for Allies on his Horde toon and vise versa and would then go and sell the Gold he made. I always told him, "So your paying 30 bucks a month just to farm gold." He said, "Yup and I'm making anywhere from 85 bucks to 250 bucks a day." I called bullshit till he showed me some PayPal receipts. It was at this point my eyes were opened that people willingly bought gold back in Vanilla.
---
Exact same issues. Doesn't see the game and won't go online.
---
I'm not counting bugs or queus
---
Nothing can top the Tailslasher Eggs.
---
thats genius
---
This explains why my first guild had to change names even though I really liked it. It was the name of a song, "Whorehoppin" by The Eagles of Death Metal. It took like 10 years but I see why now lol! Its my favorite song too!
---
i just did /roll ingame and roll 69
---
Because you don't retain older ranks, check your spellbook.
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/566/702/3f2.jpeg
---
I don't even try it, even if it works, the whole point of a keybind is not having to use an action bar slot, there is an "attack icon" already in your spellbook for that
---
I think I saw you, did you sit with an orc rogue while he ate?

Enjoy it while you can. It will go back to the usual 60's ganking lowbies soon enough

---
1664 blanc, you french madman !! I prefer Hoegaarden
---
Except for streamers, lulz.
---
Oh, fuck off. You use the conjured stuff yourself so it has without a doubt already paid for itself, nobody owes you shit. Don't be surprised when people kick you out of dungeon groups, who the fuck would want to share the loot with some stingy mage that won't share his free to conjure foos/water? Pathetic.
---
Jesus christ, your gm sounds fucking autistic as hell.
---
He blames EVERYONE but himself, which makes it so obvious he is the problem. 
---
First attacks the GMs, then the people reporting him, then goes back to the GMs.
---
One of those classes macro count is not like the others.
---
My group of 10 RL friends got to be screen shot of the day waaaaaaay back during TBC. The hype could not be overstated.
---
Down for 2 hours
---
Only thing I know of is the Neutral AH's in Tanaris and BootyBay but they have a hell of a mark up.
---
I'm a paladin and my friend is a warrior we have the exact same armor and I love it
---
Yeah as a druid I love adding thorns to the hunter/ lock pet and MOTW to the hunter or lock.  Granted the pet would probably like motw as well (and the hunter would like thorns) but if we're just passing by each other those are my priorities.
---
Hahahahaha
---
If you use one of the neutral AHs like the Booty Bay one, yes. Though you either need a second WoW account or the help of a friend, because you can't purchase your own auctions even on a different character.
---
Oh I misread then, my bad.
---
Mount coincides with the level range where you start making a lot more cash though. I'm 47 with no AH'ing whatsoever and donating all my cloth I don't use for bandaids to the guild and back up to 70 gold. Lot of pickpocket grinding to be sure but it's not that bad.
---
I am level 23, and have had only two of those "cladsic moments". Usually people just want to be left alone and think its funny to steal herb nodes or for high levels to blast me with spells and run away.
---
In dungeons everyone gets water for free. Out and about you pay for it.
---
I feel like the people complaining never played vanilla. You chose to play a mage the class with the best AOE who can farm gold better than anyone but they are the cheapest sob's I've met. I'm fine with paying for a portal not an issue but the moment you're peddling food/water expect me to start charging you for heals. I don't need you as bad as you need me as a healer.
---
Nah, you're good. Once battle.net is functioning properly it'll locate your game.
---
You bound A and D to spells? What do you strafe with? Q and E?
---
I just did Gnomer for the first time yesterday and cleared 5 quests with two more unfinished.  What do you mean there are 8 more gnome quests?!
---
One hell of a run.
---
I say it depends.
---
You are right in general but I really have a problem with those "rules" as there are situations on bosses where you need to heal up everybody.
---
Same goes for lowlevel heals... you have to find the balance between high level heal and mana regain.
---
Spamming low level heals is poison for you mana regain and it depends on the situation when you do what.
---
I fear that your posting, written with well intention, will only lead to discussions like that:
---
Raidlead: "Healers, what is wrong with you, heal up all members before event X and after event Y, cause then will be event Z and we need all dmg at that point"
---
Healer: "But some guy on Reddit said damage dealers are responsible for their health"
---
I did raidlead for years (WOTLK) and the last thing that you want in your raid is a discussion like that.
---
I'm lost
---
You're making many assumptions of my beliefs. I personally want the population bloat to decrease - so I can quest in peace etc. My desire for tourist to leave doesn't blind me to the fact that there are plenty of people being negative about the game. Perhaps negative is a strong word. Sceptical of certain game-play mechanics is more accurate. And we all know how this will end up down the line. 
---
There's already a cash shop in the character select screen. Sure, it's just for a 'Free Transfer' now, let's see how long that lasts.
---
Also, don't be duped by people making the same post over and over, riding the hype for free karma on reddit.
---
Eh, I understand reserving the coolest gear for the best players, but for a lore-head like me, knowing I'd never get to see Naxxramas because I wasn't in a top 1% raid guild was a bummer. I think having the easy mode way to experience the raids (without big loot rewards) is generally a good thing.
---
I played pvp back when I was a teenager and could afford to waste 3 hours trying to get revenge on some rogue who ganked me while grinding.
---
I'm older (obviously) with a family, kid and a full time job. I dont have the time to waste getting frustrated with wpvp. I'm in this for the pve and when I get the pvp itch I always preferred the structure of battlegrounds.
---
You will notice I said a lot of I's because it's a personal decision. Theres no wrong answer. Analyze the pros and cons for your personal situation and go from there. Good luck
---
You should be  pulling w half a rage bar, spamming 3 sunders instantly, overppwer if proc, stop sunder if mob less than 50%.  Then just white hit so you have rage for next. Its faster than hs and overpower procs alot when spam sunder
---
Can't tell behind those bangin' shades brah
---
You take both, and skip Divine Strenght and Spiritual Focus.
---
It is, you have to use the BB AH, however if I'm not mistaken it'll take a 20% cut.
---
The cross faction ah yes. I think there's one in booty bay
---
Mages have to buff also.
---
Also shaman tank, of course.
---
I use food buffs on my priest all the time. But, I often forget on my mage. Spirit isn't quite as useful when I have to park my ass and drink after every 1-2 fights, and in theory I'm not getting hit enough for the stamina to make a big difference.
---
this is just garbage, i mainly test on rogue category
---
when i switch into spell power my damage changes on the character sheet, so thats misleading
---
The only logical solution!
---
I showed that to my roommate who's never played classic. Apparently he stayed up till 3 in the morning doing it the night before last. And was doing it all yesterday.
---
To all the horde on Stalagg just trying to get to Ratchet; I am sorry.
---
Booty bay has an AH you can list stuff on as either faction.
---
SimpleEnergyBar
---
I am moist now. Thank you.
---
i managed to log in right as servers went back up and somehow dodged this issue. so yeah, game is definitely playable right now, just not through bnet.
---
It's the zoomers that never even played it and think that only new games thrive.
---
They need to go back to fortnite.
---
I come to this subreddit for fun and interesting posts, not a bunch of people that are already bored of the game and think that everyone else will be too.

A level 40 priest gave me a +3 stam buff and did /bow.

I clicked it off and continued on my way to see in the chat box.

Are they just... handed a mount? Sorry, completely clueless here haha

I vaguely remember this food...
---
Hey Crix, fellow Skeram warlock here.
---
I've just hit level 30 and I'm in a bit of a rut as to what I should be doing to level.
---
I have several quests in the shimmering flats, but the enemies are all 30+ and take a long time to down, doesn't seem worth it.
---
I have a quest in hillsbrad, which is where I prefer to level - I also prefer fighting humanoid enemies since I need cloth drops for my tailoring.
---
If I have a few hours almost every night, where do you suggest I do some leveling? Dungeon grind? Lower level mobs?
---
I was glad for a second that I don‚Äôt play rogue.
---
A proud dwarf should not lower his standards to surround himself with elf gold diggers.
---
I have the wired g502.... I have it happen like once or twice a day maybe. Only ever experienced it in wow classic
---
Because the quest isnt a chain, I believe it was meant to be done while traveling to different locations of the zone's storyline. That's why the condors are spread from the entrance, towards the north mountains by the gnolls and all along the southern east edge
---
It is
---
I was in game and got booted 15 or so mins after getting in
---
Even Rend ticks bebefit from sunder. Sunder spam makes overpower proc. You dont just 5 stack sunder every time, you use it while mob is high hp.
---
Half the time I buff randoms on the Horde-side I get a /yelled thanks in return. On the Alliance, no recognition and usually no buffs in return.
---
You can heal in BG's pretty successfully as long as you have a buddy. I healed my rogue bf (at the time) to Grand Marshal, and then subsequently two guildie warriors to Grand Marshal as well. I ended up with the rank of Commander and got the epic mount for 90g.
---
OP is a salty retail player looking for non existing confirmation that classic will die. Fuck off pleb.
---
Dude, I camp in the roads and distract alliance players into nearby mobs. I killed a few like this so far.
---
KEEP YOUR HANDS ON THE STEERING WHEEL
---
So you rather choose the get flamed route over taking simple, high quality screenshots - that can be done with the push of a couple buttons and uploaded easily. Ok pal.
---
I could translate it for Portuguese if you want.
---
The deadzone adds some planning and strategy as you level your hunter and attempt to finish some quests. It was bugging me in the first place but then you learn to deal with it. Would you attempt to shoot a bear with a goddamn bow if he was 1inch in your face? Not so sure
---
Nah dude, it's a hunter weapon.
---
Yep, happening to me as well. Only in classic wow. I‚Äôve read reports about fixing this with turning off max foreground FPS or some console commands regarding rawmouse... tried the former to no success. 
---
So far, just putting up with the kind inconvenience.
---
So I can use my 5 man multibox for even more evil!!!
---
Haha, that sounds amazing! :)
---
I can think of at least one spot in Stonetalon that has that same cave design. But I think you're right that it is much more rare than the others.
---
No human could invite this fast
---
Earlier on if you have a good healer I think it‚Äôs feasible to do with enhancement, maybe from 20-35ish
---
Remember though, most parties at that point could and should just run spellcleave, so no actual ‚Äòtank‚Äô is required
---
Ah a fellow Tim. I'll cheer for that.
---
I was in, got booted cant log in at all even manually launching the client
---
Sarcasm.
---
It's been 15 years, but if I remember correctly this worked better on alliance players.
---
I mean, Alliance has more plate wearers and the plate repair cost are greater so it's clearly superior trolling. Also you can play as troll, quadrupling the troll factor.
---
You can't tell me what to do! I'll give Unending Breath to whoever I want!
---
Wait, what are we talking about?
---
Myopic? Because I (and several other people) can see at no point was that guy rude to you; then just recommended you come back to it at a later time to hopefully see it in a different light. The guy had a different opinion, but wasn‚Äôt rude about how expressed it. 
---
No one has actually been rude to you in this whole string. We‚Äôve just pointed out a difference of opinion; wherever you are from, is it rude to have a different opinion!
---
But, at this point it is appears that you just want to be angry and pick fights with people.
---
Focus is basically a "keep it on the backburner" target.  You have it as your focus target in case you need to quickly affect it somehow, (ie: with blind, kick, gouge as a rogue), but you don't actively do things to it in the moment.
---
Yes.  I don't think any of the recipe quests are chains, really.
---
&gt;And if you don't use your taunt just to "prove a point" you're going to slow everyone down including yourself.
---
We're discussing dps that pays no heed to others here, doesn't listen to instructions and repeatedly makes the same mistake. Of course any tank worth his salt taunts accidental overaggros, but there's a 10 second cooldown on that spell. If a dps overaggros all the time, doesn't take a hint when I tell him to be careful and try to bring a mob to me if he overaggros, then I'm going to let the death do the teaching.
---
Sorry, I only ever played retail.  WTF is that?
---
Lol but as a diablo fan I‚Äôm still pissed
---
ZT is the BEST!
---
Are there blue posts that explain exactly what content is disabled? Obviously I know what the stuff that was announced in the phases. But I've also noticed that the Argent Dawn turnin item (Savage Fronds etc) aren't in. It's got me wondering what other surprises lie in store for me.
---
Okej, hade to ask becuse some people dont do that and expected it to work :)
---
You can try to add net.ipv4.ip_default_ttl=128  
---
to /etc/sysctl.conf to make the TTL persist.
---
Hmm maybe Swifty is trolling then?  He‚Äôs still online atm.
---
Or just buy the potion on AH.
---
Nice one man, only I'm not pathetic enough to waste my time photoshopping something that literally holds no meaning.
---
Git gud. And leave hunters alone. You're making all of us look bad with your post.
---
kromcrush seems pretty balanced
---
I'd say up to lvl 25 you could. Because before about 25 actual tanks don't have much in the form of aggro pulling abilities anyway lol. Like horde RFC at LVL 16 ... There is no tanking, there is just a dude labeled tank lol.
---
I didn't mention it, but using a PW: Shield before pulling is also a good idea, although that one really is mana inefficient (but allows you to cast without pushback if/when taking damage and prevents damage as long as it stands), compared to your heals.
---
Also, avoid using Renew like the plague, that's another very inefficient spell.
---
unless the rogue has a 1 shot ambush sub/assasination build - then the priest dies instantly, and there is much rejoicing.
---
I've been told /console rawmouseenable 1 helps with that.
---
If the rest of your group is solid then yeah. Shamans could tank up to level 40ish dungeons depending on their group.
---
2 talent points bring you to 36%.
---
Troll or retard
---
Gotta get that darnassus rep - 3k to go till exalted!
---
The quest says these were used by Naga, so no Pandaren connection
---
I'm gonna need you to send over to my bank alt Runaan.
---
Consoleport + Immersion mods and I've read every quest and am actively looking for quests to continue the storyline.
---
He meant skip it at 60 take it for leveling
---
Tbqh warlocks shouldn't go oom or tap to death regardless. Their rotation doesn't take much mana at all and if their out tapping demon skin repeatedly they need to learn to conserve mana as well.
---
its from the harvest festival thats on now
---
I should clarify im 2h Fury/Arms leveling. I know how shit dual wielding in is in Vanilla.
---
I think during leveling most people just take what they get and aren't planning out comps heavily. Maybe post 50 that changes but I don't see anyone requesting specific healers, dps, tanks, etc.
---
No point, leathers leak everywhere with layering and maffia is only profitable if you have monopoly on the server.
---
Try 
---
/console rawMouseAccelerationEnable "0"
---
/console rawMouseEnable "1"
---
That's /r/wowcirclejerk since Classic released.
---
That is the trippiest, seeing the players more than once outside of your guild
---
like- i know you... we rolled some murlocs in Westfall, 15 levels ago
---
This is true if you play WoW as a game where you need to move on to the next big thing, but I never played it that way--and I think most players didn't. Fact is, almost no one saw naxx and it was like what? 50 or 60% saw MC? Yet, the game had an appeal. I do think that players who want a loot grind will fall off. As fun as I think grinding for the Dungeon set is, anyone in progression raiding will get bored. But, for those of us who, again want a fantasy world to do stuff in, there's still plenty to do even if we never get to kill Rag or Ony.
---
no......wait...
---
How long did you run around with completely full bags lol... smh
---
The point is that a healer can sit and drink while everyone else is moving on to the next pack.
---
It is more efficient for a lock to tap then get healed so said lock can immediately start doing the next pack.
---
If groups are bringing rogues to unlock things and not just to fill a DPS spot, then why do I never see anyone asking rogues what their lockpicking skill is before letting them join? Nobody gets upset if you say you haven't leveled your lockpicking enough.
---
It‚Äôs a joke, pal.
---
Probably until you get mail. Then Warriors and Druids will have it A LOT easier. Your group should also understand how Aggro works and hopefully all attack the same target you are.
---
mongol is still in game, so are quite a few other streamers looking at twitch
---
Yeah at level 40 you go and train the mount skill through your trainer instead of having to go buy the skill and the mount seperately
---
No honor? Horde still corpse camps me everywhere I go. Hmm.....horde.
---
Man I wish the y-axis was larger.
---
Oh god thats going to be an absolute shitshow for some of these hunters
---
Man I hit Thousand Needles two days ago and ran into so much iron that I was 7 levels too low to mine. Ran back up to the Barrens and spent 30 minutes looking for tin to bring my skill up. When I got back to Thousand Needles I found two iron deposits in total, the rest were copper with a couple tin. Shit is just disappointing.
---
It's....not fact tho. That's not how facts work. That's not how any of that works. 
---
And yes classic dungeons ARE brain dead. What makes them difficult boils down to basic class design flaws and inflated numbers
---
So I'm new to WoW, can someone explain to me what a bank alt is used for and how to use one? From what I understand you mail items you're not going to use and want to sell to them and have them be your liaison to the auction house. Is it mostly used just to save time on traveling to cities with auction houses? I was reading online that people also use them for enchanting/disenchanting, how does that work?
---
I'm barely hanging on with Classic.  I really just wanted to pvp in WSG and AV again.  Playing BG's periodically while I leveled up is one of my fondest memories of early WoW and I'll either be level 60 by the time they release, or no longer playing the game.  
---
This isn't just a whine post, the fact that I'm even playing at all is a credit to Blizzard and Classic.  I had been away from WoW for several years before this.
---
You say genocide, we say mass recruitment drive.
---
My friend is playing WoW for the first time and named his rare spawn cat "Dog" as a joke. He then laughs and says okay how do I rename him.
---
His cat Dog still is irritating the hell out of me...
---
You don't believe pets, name changes etc will make their way into classic wow? Or you don't believe that people are making low effort praise posts for free karma? 
---
Enjoy your blissful ignorance.
---
If you don't want pvp as a rogue, don't stealth.
---
I guess it depends on your perception of the community as a whole.  I actually made a post recently, where I did get some responses saying what you are, but I also got some really good feedback.

I'm only 5 gold away, but I'm also at level 40.75 already. :(
---
are they down right now? I logged in, walked around org, decided to install a bar mod, and then couldnt log back in. Trying to figure out if i messed up the files, or just incredibly good/bad timing
---
Weird how alliance can read signs that are likely in orcish, and horde can read ones in common. But neither can speak it.
---
I use \` and zxc as well because it's near the space bar with naga mouse for macros
---
Cookie's is the best upgrade from Greater Magic Wand, yes. Your next goal should be the wand from Blackfathom Deeps quest which you can get around 25, and will last you a LONG time (there's basically no big upgrades from it until Maraudon at 46+).
---
Hopefully this might mean we're getting a separate icon/tab/game for Classic now, instead of the dropdown menu.  It's a small gripe, but it would certainly be nice imo.
---
Nethergarde Keep EU alliance is quite busy which I guess is good for finding like minded guilds and players. I am Oreg on there (human pally)
---
Biggest threat to my sanity in STV is every. single. spawn. camped to fuck and back for half the quests.
---
The vast majority of my interaction with alliance players has been hopping around and waving at each other because no one has time for that BS yet.
---
The fact you called people ‚Äúsnowflakes‚Äù means I automatically downvoted your comment because it sounds stupid as fuck, even if you‚Äôre agreeing with me.
---
Damn dude save some pussy for the rest of us.
---
If I‚Äôm worried about mana i fort the pet and divine spirit the hunter.
---
This should just be part of the maintenance that is going on until 9am PDT.
---
Just checked, severs are up.
---
I'm actually in game right now and dodged the issue, just like many others in the thread. Awkward for you I guess.
---
&gt; A rogue can ALWAYS lockpick. But everyone else has to pay for and work on professions
---
Rogues have to level lockpicking from 1-300 just like any other profession. And most of the time you open lockboxes for people it's grey to you, and you don't get a tip anyway.
---
This guy knows, dont forget Tab/`/Z/Caps...As he said above about bind them to shift as well, I also do Ctrl and Alt(Only a few on Alt)

well this is super helpful, thanks a lot mate

95% of the time? the majority of posts are positive...
---
i've definitely run into dps issues with 2h tanks during SM runs - i'm on a rogue, and can pump out some pretty hefty dps, but with 2h tanks i'm always finding myself holding back because the aggro just doesn't stick even after waiting for a few sunder stacks. The warrior might feel good topping the DPS chart, but overall it's hurting the maximum damage output.
---
Oldgrimmar.
---
While we're at it. Pallies, blessing of might is for **melee** attack power. It does nothing for our ranged attacks.
---
I think your plane is getting DDOSed
---
I don‚Äôt get it.
---
The person above you was being more tongue in cheek about it.
---
Is cooking ‚Äúmeant‚Äù to be leveled as you level? I can mostly agree with that, but who is to say that whatever you need in Desolace is a soft ‚Äúcap‚Äù on where you should be in cooking in relation to your level? Just because you think you want to level cooking now means a whole zone is flawed?
---
I went to Desolace at 36 to an abundance of quests that were nice and Grundy and it was a lot of fun. If you went there before mid-30‚Äôs just because you had an arbitrary idea of where you needed to be for a secondary profession, it‚Äôs pretty ballsy to claim that a whole zone is flawed.
---
This is a mechanic that should never have been removed.
---
Don't like it? Don't play a hunter.
---
Right, but that's why I mentioned orc. Orcs have 25% more stun resist from Hardiness. Also not sure how you are using a single judge and hammer. Your one weapon swing is 3+ seconds of the 5s stun. Youd need a huge Seal of Command, judge and hammer to all crit to do that and even 1s of a gap the rogue can vanish, gouge or blind then reset.
---
Is this true for  [\[The Azure Key\]](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?quest=8236) ?
---
30-40 is a really awkward time. The number of quest zones are limited and most people (horde and alliance) converge on a few of them, notably: Arathi, Hillsbrad, STV, etc.
---
You have a few options:
---
1.) Go to less populated questing areas. An addon like Questie can help a lot with showing you where the quests you can do are located. If you don't like the idea of having quest objectives marked on the map, you can disable that. 
---
2.) Level in dungeons. If you enjoy group content, this is actually a wonderful way to get through the 30-40 bracket. Scarlet Monastery is a dungeon broken into 4 that will take you from 30 to 40+. It has incredible loot for most classes and is extremely lucrative in terms of a gold farm which is useful for saving up for the mount. Because the game is so populated, finding groups is usually a non-issue.
---
3.) Wait. It sucks but you're basically right in the middle of the bell curve if you're in the mid-30's right now. Which means the majority of players are around your level and in the same zones. Even the less populated zones are still going to be *quite* full. And as long as you keep up with the pack, you're always going to experience some element of this. If you hang back and let yourself fall behind a bit, you should have a smoother ride all the way to 60.
---
Take this post, summarize in one sentence, then put it in game chat. Problem solved
---
You can! They're just a little more... blasted now.
---
That's fine. To each their own man.
---
If I'm giving people food/water for questing, I ususally give 3 stacks of food and 3 stacks of water.
---
Although if I'm say, level 30 and my current food sucks, I may not waste your time with it, because it'd just take so long to eat to full HP with it.
---
Yeah, modern WoW has problems but lighting really isn‚Äôt one of them, especially with how much more extensively doodads in the world actually cast light.
---
I think people accuse modern WoW‚Äôs graphics of being ‚ÄúDisney‚Äù they‚Äôre probably referring to character models, which is a tad hyperbolic maybe, but it‚Äôs true that the new models had a significant shift in art direction that ramped up the cartooniness quite a bit ‚Äî big glassy eyes, noodly appendage motion while running, and even use of the same ‚Äúsquash and stretch‚Äù animation techniques which are typically used by 2D animators.
---
So we're in agreement then :)
---
Same here. Can't even log in to B.net. I at first thought that this was just another occurrence of the issue Linux users were facing yesterday since I use Linux, but it seems that this is affecting Windows users as well, so I dunno.
---
Tbc resto druid underpowered for pvp? Am I reading that right?
---
Was in the Charred Vale last night in stonetalon and this group of horde started camping out party for over an hour ( especially this rogue who was quite a few levels above our party) while we were just trying to kill harpies... I'm down for a fight with anyone but don't camp someone out... That's just sad....
---
Finally got a group of alliance together to swarm the Vale and take it over for the night. Got revenge on the ass a couple times in the process too. Sweet sweet revenge.
---
I'm looking at you Jawbless the rouge on Bigglesworth... You earned a spot on all of our kill on sight lists for sure
---
That's because they're all playing as well.

Well then have fun, something probably fucked up and let some people in for a brief period or something, have fun while the rest of us wait for the maintenance period to end.

They do this every tuesday, just expect it to be down for an hour or so.

Mages can do it solo, I've done it. The giants before her are honestly harder as a mage because of mana problems, I've got evocation for the first ones but after that the second giant takes like 3 mins each time just because I am oom.
---
Princess herself is easy, just kiting her back and forth across the bridge with flameblasting, I'm not hard casting anything and whenever I need to turn around I just wait for the stun, blink and keep running. Every other turn I need to bandage.

Ohhh I remember that Error... Back in - I think it was 2006 - I came across this Little fcker for the first time.
---
I called Blizzard after hours and hours of searching in different Forums...
---
When I got the first Blizzard employee he told me:"Server maintainance is ongoing. Are you blind?"
---
Since then I read the maintainance notes :)
---
And, up until the most recent raid, there were in-lore reasons why you do every raid every week. 
---
Bungie's writers are very clever at weaving the story and lore through the gameplay, 99% of gameplay related things in that game have a story element tied to them.

Boo this man

I highly recommend an addon called immersion it's so good for reading quest text.

Kromkrush - don‚Äôt have a legit faction split yet but that classic realms website has it at almost a 50/50 split but a lot of people think it‚Äôs a lot more horde leaning, guess we‚Äôll see when the data comes in.

That's stupid. *You're* not paying them a skill up. You wouldn't tell a restaurant you're not leaving cash because the waiter has a little more experience for you having eaten there.
---
Okay, thanks.
---
If I can beat them down in Int/Spr cloth/leather/mail using a 12DPS +Healing mace, you should be able to crush them, unless your weapon is well out of date.
---
Yep,  people bitch about lfg, and sure it reduced dedication to finding a group,  but if all those people were on your server the rules would still apply. 
---
Youd earn a name as a loot ninja or the guy who bails after a bad fight, people would blacklist the dicks.
---
I saw a group post that they needed a tank. I asked to join but warned them I had never done it before and would probably need someone to tell me where to go. At the first intersection I asked which way to go. No answer. After 2 hours or aimless clearing and luckily running into a couple bosses we got lost and gave up. I'll never go back.
---
Exact same thing happened last night. Then I ended up lvling up my BSing to the point I could make shoulders a couple hours later. Still felt like a god having shoulders at 16....on the other hand I only have 1 bag.........
---
Right click your portrait -&gt; Reset All Instances

Sad truth, 79% of the Hunters I've dealt w/in Classic so far don't know what they are doing. We were in Gnomer and the Hunter kept sending his pet on Mobs I wasn't even tanking, he wouldn't dismiss his pet twice when we jumped down. He then causes a wipe and blames the mage and leaves, rogue ends up leaving right behind him.....I fucking hate Gnomer Dungeon btw.
---
learn how to use shift binds. 
---
shift+1-5, shift-q, shift-e, shift-r, shift-f, you get the idea. 
---
most versatile binds and there's no accidental clicks. if you've played an FPS where you hold shift to run, it won't be a huge learning curve. completely changed how effective i was at this game when i started using them in cataclysm years ago.
---
So the reason classic cast is one of the only cast bar add-ons working is that the API for castbars is locked down in classic. So the add-ons can't see the actual cast, so it makes an assumption on the spell rank and cast time. This is often wrong, meaning if your slow to interrupt the cast has already finished dispite what the cast bar may say.
---
On Hunter they are usually solid until you get access to Mail at 40.
---
Yeah, I honestly don't mind getting killed in fair open world encounters and I don't chase down lower level players to gank them but last night in Ashenvale I was reaching my limit as some over leveled hoard player botting around a crazy number of warlocks all named a derivation of Brains was ganking everyone in site.
---
I have the server status in front of me all green.
---
Stay out of Barrens ally scum! :)
---
are tier 1 sets dropping in MC and ony? i thought they werent in the game yet.
---
People wanting a major class mechanic to work how it did in vanilla, when Blizzard clearly claimed that there were no changes being made to any part of gameplay, and here we are, with things not working how they did in vanilla. Imagine that?
---
Don't take this the wrong way but, yea, no. Barely.
---
Also, Metzen is garbage. The majority of his career as the creative force behind Warcraft is riddled with generic cliches and a lack of originality. Granted, if you were to compare each town in WoW to a town in Witcher 3 - yes, each town most definitely has its own story and feels like it is its own thing, compared to Witcher 3s towns which are all entirely garbage except for the major cities.
---
Hmmmmm. To shreds you say?
---
&gt; It is a pain to run honestly I enjoyed it as a no life 16 year old but as an adult I'd hate it.
---
I remember it and even at 16 with nothing to do I hated it. Skipping it for sure this time.
---
Yeah. I used to use a naga mouse since it had 12 buttons, but i haven't needed once since wotlk, so a regular mouse worked fine with my 3 usable abilities in retail. I forgot coming back to vanilla and reaching max level how many abilities I have now. So the click is everywhere and i'd like to minimize as much clicking as I can.
---
I was a clicker through vanilla, and upon joining a server first raid group in BC, I had to learn key binding quickly. Basically all I did was I started putting essential skills to various keybinds, and I would only do one keybind at a time.  
---
I started with binding Q, once that became second nature, I moved to F, then E, then V then Z, and slowly branched out from there. As far as the numbers went, I bought a Razer Naga as soon as it was sold and I have always just used a naga for MMO's
---
There's an addon called Blue Shamans which will change all the shamans in the world to the dark blue.  I downloaded it and it has changed EVERYTHING
---
So they fix the queues and yet you find something negative to say.
---
 My server is listed as medium population and I am level 27 and it feels packed at any time of the day even at 3 AM. Plenty of people LFG for dungeons, camping and fighting for spawns for quests etc..
---
Still feels very alive to me.
---
I'm still sad about not being able to take my garrison followers with me into the subsequent expacs. Leorahj was my pocket healer.
---
it goes to Camp Taurajo, at least
---
Yes, it saves time of having to go to cities on your main character, as you can mail everything (for a small price).  
---
You can also save bag space out in the world by sending the items to them to sell (mostly greens and up).
---
If he gets this change I want my warlock to wear plate.
---
Make warlock tier items plate
---
30sec-1min well wasted.
---
You've gotta make your own group. I've gone it several times and had no problem putting something together quickly.
---
I always tip for mage food/water in major cities, but yeah...in a dungeon you're expected to do it since it speeds up the run inmensely.
---
As a lock, I usually only soulstone and give out health stones to the tank and anyone else who asks. I'll summon if I get there first though.
---
One of my fav moments so far (as a completely new player) is saving someone with who is an inch from death while they're running from a mob. Its such a great feeling and on the other hand you know when someone repays it back
---
1. What's wrong with DOGZ?  I don't know what this is though I presume it's a guild?
---
2. If DOGZ is a guild that you dislike do you just automatically assume everyone in that guild is of the the character you dislike?  Unless they've all become known to be ninja looters I highly doubt anyone deserves to be automatically treated as trash because of who they associate with.
---
3. Regardless of you feelings about a guild, your response to his request to join the group was pretty douchy.  You're basically saying "You'll never get an invite from anyway because you're friends are shit so level to 60 the hard way."  Adding a "sorry man" isn't a fix for being a dick to someone.
---
Excluding the part in the screenshot actually shows that you are a judgemental prick is fairly trashy.

---
Retail just doesn't have any soul left in it...
---
Its just one mini adventure after another, so disjointed.  So many micro transactions, pets, mounts, xmogs, M+, dailies, multiple raid levels, Islands, PVP, etc.  All about "engagement time" statistics now.  Players no longer have to spend time learning a character, playing with the builds, crafting, exploring, and no real socialization anymore.  Just a ghost town full of shadows... the wraiths of players moving from place to place, event to event, daily to daily.  The world with nothing but the lost souls of players.  The next expansion should be called "World of Warcraft:  Fractured Souls"
---
Most of the true gamers from Blizzard that started this amazing WoW journey have moved on.  As a result it is no longer a game built by gamers.  It's now just a hollow shell of what once made it great, built by programmers, marketing teams, and board room members.  The gamers have been missing from this equation for a long, long time.  The players and the gamers developing the game were the soul of the game...
---
Anyway, as I said, retail is just a soulless game now.  Maybe this Classic experiment can reeducate Blizzard on what matters most.  Maybe show some of them that yes, we really DO want this.
---
There is a saying out there that goes something like "Employees don't quit companies, they quit managers."  I would like to adapt that to what has happened with Blizzard and WoW.  "The players didn't leave the game, the game (Blizzard) left the players."  Think about it...
---
You should download TRP and try it some time. I used to think it was the lamest thing in the world until I gave it a good try and now it‚Äôs really the only way I can play the game. It completely changed things for me and really made me focus more on my character and the ‚Äúworld‚Äù around me. But I totally understand it‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea and there‚Äôs no problem with that of course.
---
Sword spec can proc off any swing or attack, there is no point in waiting to use SS.
---
Once you have your BIS from LW you can drop it and still use the items.
---
Well it wasn't exactly a secret that they'd be doing the content schedule this way. They announced it months ago.
---
Idk why you came in expecting different.
---
When World of Warcraft was launched, it had several patches before its first expansion. Many of them introduced some pretty big changes, such as revamped talents, skills and even new dungeons with better loot than the older ones. 
---
So when WoW classic was going to be launched, a question remained: at what point of the "classic" timeline should it be set to? What's the "classic'est" patch? 
---
If you release it just before the expansion, then the only dungeons and raids worth doing are the latest ones, because they have better gear, which trivializes the rest of the content.
---
But it was also fun content, so launching without it would feel incomplete, and wouldn't make some people happy.
---
The compromise was to launch different phases: that whole "phase 1, 2, 3, 4, etc". What this means is that right now we're on phase 1, where we do have the revamped talents and skills because they helped balance the classes (not saying it's perfect, but it's way better than if it were an earlier patch) but not all of the content. The content is going to be gradually released, to better recreate the original timeline.
---
The phases are as follows:
---
* Phase 1 (Classic Launch): Molten Core, Onyxia, Maraudon
---
* Phase 2: Dire Maul, Azuregos, Kazzak
---
* Phase 3: Blackwing Lair, Darkmoon Faire, Darkmoon deck drops begin
---
* Phase 4: Zul'Gurub, Green Dragons
---
* Phase 5: Ahn‚ÄôQiraj War Effort begins, Ahn‚ÄôQiraj raids open when the war effort dictates, Dungeon loot reconfiguration (Tier 0.5 Dungeon gear, Relics, drop rates and location changes)
---
* Phase 6: Naxxramas, Scourge Invasion
---
If you haven't played WoW before, the names don't make any sense, but suffice to say the newer the content, the better the rewards compared to related content (usually)
---
What happens after phase 6 is a mystery to me. Stay there? Continue with Burning Crusade expansion? New and unrelated content?

Servers are up I have guild members online playing rn battle net is fucked...
---
Or better yet allow them to have multiple pets out that do all the work for them, all the have to do is sit there and brew some tea or cook some food while their stable of pets attacks the mobs for them.
---
Meow.
---
I summon some stacks before doing a dungeon to give some to the healer/dps so they don't have to dip into their stock too much.  What I don't like and refuse to do is summon 3 stacks of food and water for every person in the group.  It's fucking tedious to summon half the damn dungeon because the group is lazy and/or cheap.  People seem to forget that often times mages are not summoning a stack of 20 every cast.  I just got my new water and I summon 2 bottles per cast.  I'm not summoning 60 for each of you.
---
Sunder armor is also great for leveling weapon skills.  Find a mob that's several levels below you, equip weapon to level and go D stance, and sunder your heart out.  Depending on initial weapon level when starting, you can get around 100 skillups on a single mob.
---
Everybody is aware of the maintenance, everybody got kicked, the issue is that the servers are back up now and people can't login to play. Check the realm status page and see for yourself.
---
Ok so that to me gets rid of the whole horde vs ally? I remember seeing an ally and wanting to kill them just because they were alive!
---
The respawn timers on those things are so goddamn high I killed 2 while questing yesterday on Skeram. Add in layer abuse and I don't think there's going to be any kind of "mafia" any time soon.
---
Then, do dungeons? You'll meet other people around your level range and perhaps make new friends.
---
It's a little ridiculous.  I'm super against QOL addons like Questie which just tell you what to do ala retail, but I downloaded it just so I can turn it on occasionally to see where all the quests are for my level that I dropped back when they were red
---
Nah, your faction sees what you write, the other sees ‚ÄúX makes some unintelligible gestures‚Äù or something like that
---
Wish I had bought all the Calico gear on the AH to monopolise the market before making this post
---
I DO care about questing, the only thing I'm doing is calling you out for being ridiculous.
---
You've teleported through time and space both via magic and technology. You've captured wayward spirits both through magic and technology. You've been communicating via technological devices since level 10ish of Vanilla Warcraft for gods sake but here you are, pitching a fit over doing so again.
---
You want to insult my intelligence, but it is specifically known to be a trait of stupid people to get angry over silly, inconsequential things.
---
You are truly, TRULY ridiculous.
---
I edited my post immediately recognize this horrible mistake. Now I'm petitioning Blizzard to change it.
---
Because they have a fixed resource cost regardless of rank, unlike spells
---
LOL if that dude is serious about about his name he would get a /gkick so fast....
---
correct. The oceans were also basic texture, no reflections at all and not very see-through.
---
My retail bank alt is lvl 5.
---
We need to unionize.
---
The Mages Union demands Wages for Mages!
---
I would join this guild so fast.
---
Stranglethron PvP is great but I love SM PVP better
---
Noticias Urgented
---
Those are usually good to read
---
No challenge? Whenever someone says this I'm convinced they just did lfr and thought that was it.
---
If I see you running by and you are a caster, I will set my felhunter on you and be on my way without stopping. It‚Äôs good to put the fear of ~god~ warlock in some people :)
---
it's the principle of the matter
---
Yes, there are options in the Interface Options, you can get it to show numbers, percentages or both.
---
yep
---
Tradeskill master or auctionator. I use tradeskill master (tsm) because I have heard auctionator can cause you to get disconnected and there are ques on my server. 
---
TSM can take some time to figure out and set up but it is a very good program with a lot of functionality.
---
[I use this one](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/global-ignore-list)
---
You're just as in the wrong here.
---
Why are you like this?
---
He was tanking. And the gear had a effect that would passively regen health. Basically it would be a perfect addition to the Warlock Demon Armor.
---
But a really good healer wont go boom and keep everyone at full
---
Never could do something like this.  Quests scattered across tons of zones.  I have a few that were orange in Loch Modan that I never got to before leaving for Westfall to get a vulture.  I couldn't just get a damn bird, no.  I had to pick up a quest *since it was on the way.*  Now I have half a dozen quests in Westfall with two or three glaring quests left in Loch Modan that is rapidly going from Orange....to Yellow....to Green....
---
"Guys, guys, I just figured out a great name for our guild!  It's a pun.... Oops, I crit my pants!  Haha why isn't it letting me create it?"
---
Hey bud, why don‚Äôt you go fuck off.
---
Hahaha his post is somewhat accurate though. The 2% or so hit is meh with a 2h when you‚Äôre killing mobs in the 3 or less swings. 
---
The reason the axe is chosen is because it impacts all your on demand abilities (cleave, overpower, retaliation, MS etc.) the higher the top end damage &amp; slower swing timer results in the more damage each of these do. 
---
I would say it‚Äôs a bigger deal for horde players to pick the axe for windfury. The sword is going to scale down your dps a bit, but you‚Äôll hit more. If you‚Äôre fine forgoing the massive damage of the above abilities, then you could go with the sword.
---
Do addon's send data back to the developers?  Is there anyway to provide feedback vs just sending an email?  
---
Where is this data pulled from?  It had to come from somewhere.
---
PVP servers are fun at first, but you have to remember once you're around 35ish, you will see the other faction everywhere, and that can really slow down your level grind.
---
Basically, after 35ish, you will be looking over your shoulder allot.  It's fun for some, but a nightmare for others.
---
Get a job and shit to do no life loser. Are we done here?
---
I was looking for this the other day and gave up, but this inspired me to look again and *I just found it.*
---
[I know this link looks sketchy as fuck.](https://world-of-warcraft-desktop.software.informer.com/) So as proof I took a screenshot of my desktop:

Oh man I hope those calico stuff isn‚Äôt actually worth anything on the AH, I already vendored like 2 pieces
---
&gt; (General chat is not a comedy podcast, all evidence to the contrary).
---
they aspire to be, though
---
You really can tell, BRD remains the best old-school D&amp;D dungeon crawl ever made and remains my all-time favorite dungeon. Meanwhile on retail it's a giant fucking mobile game full of mobile game bullshit. Nothing feels like an RPG, not even remotely. Classic was made by D&amp;D players, retail is made by lawyers and accountants. And dear God does is show.
---
Kills one horde AND gets to join the Alliance? Huge upgrade to be honest
---
You may get a small increase in DPS by using a swing timer if you are sword specced. But Sinister Strike does not, in of itself, reset the auto attack.
---
I would just move guilds!
---
Blizzard can't even filter out gold spam. They probably allow it because they can't figure out how to stop the idiots who use them.
---
No kidding- I just got rank 3 and went from feeling like Oprah to choosing which 2-3 people look like they deserve it most.
---
The leather is selling for 10g a piece on Skeram. Pretty cheap honestly, but still worth it for me to kill any I find while questing.
---
If I didn't have aggro I'd like to do PWS-&gt;MB-&gt;SWP-&gt;WAND.
---
If I had aggro (e.g. patrolling mob) I might want to do SWP-&gt;PWS-&gt;MB-&gt;WAND
---
i'll give it a try.
---
No he logged off but this guy is still waiting at this corpse for him to come back.
---
It's particularly jarring in WoW because they switched from one style to the other. It works much better in FFXIV because that one has always (at least since ARR, don't know much about pre-ARR) been written as a single-player JRPG (that just happens to have MMO gameplay elements).
---
lol :)
---
Hahaha oh boy..
---
The sense of progression from that game was absolutely insane. I played a dwarf cleric and had an absolute blast, and leveling up felt unlike almost any other game - you don't just "heal harder" as cleric as you level, you get abilities that were absolute game-changers. Death Ward or Slay Living for instance are insanely potent abilities that can't be quantified. 
---
It's inevitable of course, but it's a shame that WoW hit a point where characters stopped getting new feats. I remember back during Burning Crusade how absolutely hype Shadowstep and Cloak of Shadows were. Other classes got cool new shit too like Druids getting flight form. There were a few big-ticket abilities that really made you go "wow". Vanilla kind of set the benchmark for what a vanilla Warcraft character could do, and then Burning Crusade and WOTLK took it up a notch and really made those characters feel "super-heroic".
---
It's the internet that's why. Don't pay attention to everything that everyone says, just ignore him. People talking shit is nothing new around here
---
I own a B2B flower company, cry more.
---
That‚Äôs why hunters get so much hate. There are way more opportunities to fuck up than compared to other classes. Everyone can play a hunter but not everyone can be good at it.
---
So therea not really any pvp in normal servers because everyone is just too busy to get max level so they can raid?
---
Agility grants 2 ap, for rogues, strength grants 1 point only, idk where your getting the range part
---
And fuck your sanctimonious attitude.  My response was not being an ass.  But the way your are responfing makes me wonder what the fuck your problem is.  First empty rage bar swap pop enrage plus zerk and iintercept which stuns swap defensive taunt and done.  Also if i have lots of rage available in defensive then i am fucking up.
---
OP is the only issue here
---
I literally do this. I have a level 1 named noaltchars on every server to rid the game of these stupid names.
---
yes, but that name gets taken very early on each server, chances are it's not me.  my main character is a druid now
---
‚ôÇDUNGEON‚ôÇMASTER‚ôÇ
---
nope, needs a calico cat pet
---
Sells for 10G a piece on Skeram, pretty much flies off the AH any time I put it up.
---
Auctionator/neer, TSM (but only if u want to go in-depth)
---
Counter reported for your re-report.
---
Yeah, i know that.
---
My question is if I can keep the buy menu open all the time, or if I need to close it and open to see the new items for sale.
---
Feign does not drop you from combat now, it takes a few seconds, which means Feign+freezing trap does not work.
---
When did this occur? My level 1 warlock from TBC is full on Tuxedo. I‚Äôll have to log in and see what happened to him.
---
OP refused to invite the dude because he was in some guild.  The "Good luck grinding" wasn't an actual wish of good luck but a dig indicating no one will ever group with him.
---
Yeah, it's a nice idea on paper, but in practice isn't very good.
---
That's what happens when you accept the first guild invite you get
---
Well, when you're in your late 50s and everyone knows you as "that rogue", and you can't find groups, I guess you'll know why.
---
And you do this shit with guildies and they will petition to have you removed.
---
Same lvl, ice trap, concussive shot, tame...
---
Blizzard was warned and told during the beta of Classic that this would happen... so I hope they enjoy all the appeal tickets and pissed of paying customer's of their MMO
---
Ha, noob. I just press the lap button on my stop watch every time i swing.
---
This is weird to see! That's my username, but that's not me. What server is this on?
---
Everyone says this but if you look at the unit from WCII the building on top looks nothing like this. They gave the building an Asian look on purpose IMO.
---
damn had no idea , I have cod an item last night and the person didnt paid yet
---
Will look into it
---
Yes, you'd have to look it up as I don't know the script off off the top of my head, but basically you would have one for something like Kick, for example, and it would Kick whatever you are hovering over (this still loses you your combo points though).
---
Should I be saving all the low level greens to sell on the auction house though? How does disenchanting work though, does it just remove the stat boosts from the item?
---
Same lol.. 30 players and not a single "ty" my ass. I don't even rez people often but every single time they've thanked me or said something at least.
---
This is also my reaction when people complain about queues
---
Caps can't be used except for the first letter.
---
I healed someone in Red Ridge without paying attention to why they were running.
---
Everyone died.
---
When I'm on my Lock, I just tell the healer that if they see me life tapping between pulls, to not worry, I'll be sitting down to eat or bandaging myself up, but they still throw heals on me and I'm like "SAVE YOUR MANA DAMMIT" in my head. I think there's a contingent of healers who still aren't used to the fact that not everyone expects to be topped up by them constantly.
---
When I'm on my priest, I wait to see if the life tapping Lock is going to eat or bandage themselves before the tank pulls, if they don't, I'll throw a down ranked renew on them with the idea that between that and their Demon Skin/Armor regen, they should be fine. I'm not gonna waste all my just refreshed mana on someone when the group is waiting.
---
you say 18+ to participate but majority of stream viewers are younger
---
He's toxic, you're toxic... should've just ignored the guy
---
Showed my guild what a Holy Paladin looked like in Vanilla. Nail on the head.
---
Care bear, cry more.
---
Good ol' barrens chat
---
Although 175 is tolerable, 200 is definitely the most logical move.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between killing for purpose and camping someone for hours for no reason. One is ‚Äúpvp things‚Äù, the other is a mental illness.
---
Any good guides or a simple list of quests to avoid? I'm good about dumping stuff like you mentioned, but it's easy to waste time before figuring that out.
---
Thats exactly what that is.
---
i chose the horde (was hardcore ally) because i finally read about the WoW lore. Horde is the most logical way for me when it comes to the lore. Never going to ally again
---
I did not know this was a thing, now considering rerolling.
---
oh word, didn't know about those. Well this method works well for without addons i guess, I gotta try those out!
---
Exactly this, it doesn't cut down on your number of keystrokes so it doesn't really save you any effort IMO. Still, if you wanna just be able to smash a single key as a panic button...that wouldn't be the worst thing ever.
---
Gender choice is only a 2019 problem. 
---
I pick the gender directly assigned to my sex. EZ CLAP
---
I thought adibags didn‚Äôt work with classic?
---
Mine started a few years back after a trip to Mexico.  Apparently I have really narrow ear canals which doesn't help.  My wife really wants me to see an ENT to get to the bottom of it.  Luckily it hasn't been as severe as yours but I know it does not take much to get there.
---
It's being abused and that is fact, it is also being abused in PvP to lock people out of Battlegrounds.
---
Then why was there such a massive outrage over an LFG addon? Gamers are just massive hypocrites who switch sides the second it suits them.
---
everynow and then ill just help someone kill a mob since i cant give battleshout to non-party members ;p
---
It is a great instance. Fun mechanics, cool dungeon, and nice variety of rewards.
---
I think it says a lot about why dungeons are the way they are in retail that everyone hates gnomer and loves linear, boring ass scarlet monestary.
---
Did....did that Tauren just Illidan "You are not prepared" you? Burning Crusade servers confirmed!!!
---
I‚Äôm a dude but play a femdwarf.  They have the only animations I can tolerate.
---
Gotcha, I had EST in my head
---
Hey, I looted a +7 Healing spells green last night.
---
From what I understand the servers are up atm, but the log in servers are down. So it has created a situation where those of us who got in right as the show log in down are just stuck in a small playerbase till they open it up.
---
God it makes me so uncomfortable seeing a Tauren and an Orc with red names lol.
---
That really depends on the games you play most often. For MOBA players, q/w/e is likely more comfortable. For MMO players the default is w/a/s/d so that would feel more comfortable to them. 
---
Personally I strafe with a/d and use q/e for spells.
---
So English speaking Brits then. So what he's looking for.
---
Whu...whaoooooo!
---
huh
---
I don't even have "World of Warcraft - Classic" in my drop down menu. I only have "World of Warcraft". Is this the same issue you're all having?
---
I know why you're groupin with me
---
I bet you wanna get some water outta me
---
Do I look like a vending machine?
---
No, I'm a fireballin M.A.G.E.
---
I cast Wisdom on the hunter and Might on their pet.
---
I've rolled on Zandalar Tribe myself and I have seen a fair share of shit names that go against the naming rules. I usually roll my eyes. My friend reported someone on launch day called "killurself" and got disconnected once he submitted it lol.           
---
A few players in my guild have been forced to name change, about 3 or 4 of them. So maybe when enough people report them its automated. One guy was able to change his name back to the original "reported" name and got a 3 day suspension.
---
Everything is a tank and spank. 
---
The reason people die usually is either lack of aoe threat by tanks, lower level aggro from distant mobs or healer aggro 
---
Dungeons start off and end in a 6 level difference for literally no reason
---
I'm not really sure what both of you are expecting.
---
People want to organise raiding guilds, and nobody is ready for them yet. Does this mean they can't prepare?
---
My guild held a pole with the current members to see when was the best raiding times. We all voted and they determined that X time was the best. It's likely that many of the organisers are advertising with the times we have set... which is Thursday and Friday between 7pm and 10pm.
---
Well if they aren't in def stance, it's like a 60% delta in threat... 80% to 130%.  the -10% dmg and not getting 3% crit from zerker doesn't hold up to the increase in threat, aka increase in the rest of the group's damage.  nothing wrong with stance dancing to rotate abilities, but sunder/cleave with a 2hander in def.  when I see tanks just body pull and sit in zerker while "tanking" it makes me sad, and want to level my war to tank even though i'm doing hunter first.
---
The torches in BFD also look quite phallic
---
Pretty rare at low levels, but yeah.
---
I Know I don't have to, BUT if I am bored I try to anyway.
---
My first shoulder drop is a blue item I cant wear with absolutely useless stats on it for men (3 health per 4 second cloth).

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d29bv9/trying_to_log_in_on_na_streamers_online_currently/). 
---
You can only take beasts that are your level or lower. Also if you lose aggro during the tame it is canceled so you can't have some one tank it
---
I haven't gone in.  Usually they just give you antibiotic drops.  Heating pad and ibuprofen definitely help with pain management.
---
Totally up to your playing style.
---
I prefer to play Tanks and Healers and rush to get to instance level and then stop questing.
---
Others like reading all the quests and exploring the whole world. I did that once, long ago with my main... and then again on the other side to see what their stories were.
---
But now I do Warbiking: I'm running through an instance while riding a recumbent exercise bike, killing 500 calories a day.
---
WoW can be played lots of ways. Some people rush to the end and grind the end bosses. Some spend all their time in Goldshire, tailoring up new outfits. Some solo the world, looking for PvP kills.
---
It's your game, play it how you want to.
---
So how does one connect to the game without going through the login servers? (If I'm understanding that correctly? I might now be.)
---
It's poorly placed. For gnomer's complexity and effort, you could spend the time out leveling it and it's mediocre rewards. Some players can't hit the "Abandon Quest" button, so they feel forced to run it.
---
As with most jokes, you need to know your audience.
---
Going into melee range and weaving some attacks, tagging mobs and kiting them while your pet finishes off another one, etc. Also, in pvp is unvaluable as it turns you from an inmobile tower to a slippery dps machine more akin to retail
---
Oh fuck I hate when I'm locked out of content that doesn't exist.  That's the worst
---
Any way to include mortal strike into this?
---
EU is up, NA is down.
---
At least that's my understanding of the situation after hopping in a few streams.
---
Wow, not only are you asshole and sad enough to report these people for no reason. But you're also pathetic enough to come and make a post specifically about it!
---
Maybe one day the odd dickhead inside of you will leave. But for now, you're a bit of a prick.
---
Chat on US Herod moves so fast that I could never remember a name unless that person was spamming and being toxic.
---
If he‚Äôs made this much of an impact to get auto reported any time he steps out then he must be crazy annoying and it looks like the system is working just fine.
---
Keep his head down, promote someone who can get stuff done to GM and come back at a later date when his annoyance has been forgotten.

Welcome back to server communities.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs not right here‚Äù classic edition
---
When I found a lvl 15 grey pair of mail shoulders I looked around Xroads until I found a 15 warrior with no shoulder and traded them to him. He was thrilled and thanked me! It's a great feeling to help people, even if it's something small like that ü§ó
---
&gt; It's not /gleave its
---
&gt; FormPlusFunction has left the guild.
---
r/thatsmyfetish
---
Yeah, as someone who just dinged 25 (but also with an duo leveling alt mage at 16) I feel like that is a huge waste of time haha
---
You realize the number of servers at launch were around 10 in NA? Now there's 3 times that.... But sure dude.... sure.
---
I thought even as fury, you want to rock a 2H?
---
It‚Äôs peepee smash time!
---
The more salient concern was more Blizzard fucking it up if they were allowed to change things.
---
For reference, I'm all for making positive changes and ultimately Classic+, but I understand the #NoChanges crowd.
---
People who actually appreciate the help are the best.
---
That rule of thumb is dumb; let‚Äôs eliminate ninja looting by just all ninja looting.  The majority of pugs I have been in have some form of decency and spine.  
---
Everyone is leveling, no one has gold, and that BOE is just going to rot on the AH and will sell for 5g after losing the deposit several times.  Might as well let the one guy which wears mail loot the fucking mail.  
---
I have a group of buddies to run with but they aren‚Äôt always on because life and stuff.
---
Sometimes Shadowplay like others mentioned. I stream online some, so I usually use Stream Labs OBS. You can use it to record offline and have it record your discord/music along with your gameplay as well.
---
"They say there's no business like show business, but up in the mages guild, we say there's no business like H2O business."
---
BoE world drops should generally be saved. Some of them are twink items for when battlegrounds are introduced. Thing is the server economies arn't healthy yet. That's going to take a bunch of lvl 60s with gold to spend first.
---
Also crafting mats but you can google lists of those.
---
Not tanking for ANY more Rogues!!! You think I spent all this time leveling my toon to waste my gold on repairs for a ROGUE? I'm a DRUID. You're asking the BEAR to growl and get smacked for a THIEF??? No. From now on, as far as everyone is concerned, my growls are only for ranged casters, and I'll come back at the end of the dungeon and give the rogue a /mourn
---
I hope they get done by 9am their time. Im delaying my lunch break to log on haha
---
Absolutely.  It makes more sense to have role specific toons if you are that seriously committed to wow.  Plenty of people will be grinding out additional characters early on while there isn‚Äôt much to do.
---
*Scratches neck*
---
y'all got any of that... Classic wow?
---
it depends for me. I love Mauradon and Gnomeregan, but I hate BRD and Sunken Temple.
---
Do you log straight into WoW or through Battle.net? Because I can't get back online on the battle.net launcher
---
&gt;I have made sure to borrow money from no one. i wanted my mount to be obtained at my own effort, not from a loan.
---
You called it. Since you mentioned this even before Blizzard, I assume you know what you did. You were caught. Get another account.
---
Ah that makes more sense, thanks
---
My friend never played retail wow so he decided to join the fun and play classic. I told him he would have fun being a gnome mage. He didn‚Äôt find out until it was too late that I was a dwarf priest. Now I‚Äôm not the shortest person in the group and I get water/portals/arcane intellect.
---
Walking to Tanaris from Theramore and then forgot to click on the flight path. I had a great walk of shame to Tanaris again...
---
I had never thought about it that way, but it makes so much sense. The only drop for my rogue in SM is the dagger from an inquisitor, literally a weapon of torture!
---
The macro is for auto shot, the default attack.
---
BFA was the first expac launch I skipped, and I even had already bought it. I have played far and away less time on it than ever, outside of sitting in Goldshire doing my thing which is totally independent of the current content. If you like BFA, more power to you.
---
I'm just giving my opinion. I have no desire to play it. But it's ok, we've got Classic now.
---
The Sunday maintenance was from the ddos attacks. Weekly maintenance is Tuesday like it has been since forever.
---
Why would you ever choose that name?
---
me too. I wouldnt feel comfortable playing a female character only for some guy out there to think the player behind the toon is actually a girl. Plus it ruins the immersion of the game for me. But i automatically assume every female char is a guy irl.
---
What are these shoulders called?
---
Moving from Incendius to Netherwind was actually a phenomenal experience. Players everywhere and have had all out war PVP brawls in Southshore. The AH still needs to mature, but with no queue and always seeing a group of people everywhere/populated chat has made it worth it.
---
Herod Horde side. If you want a guild with a Discord and raiding starting Nov. 1st on Mon/Tues let me know!
---
Holy fuck this sub is full of toxic idiots
---
Buy a new wand, get spell power gear.
---
I'm not going back until I'm at least level 35.
---
Thanks for reminding me that I just hit level 37. Time to tame him so I can sit shadowmelded in Stonetalon Mountains.
---
Yeah, I didn't know they were in PST. I do now!
---
Warriors are prized as tanks for several reasons: gear, abilities, and statistics. The class has set bonuses to improve their role, unlike paladins or druids where bonuses are chiefly focused on healing. If you choose either paladin or druid for tank or DPS you're going to enounter oddities such as your Boss weapon being a weapon from Gnomer, or the level 40 helm that's BiS for cat DPS.
---
However, a druid's bear form has abilities comparable to a warrior's toolkit, such as a taunt and Demoralizing Roar. While you might want to read up about defense, you would be an effective tank with good threat generation and Swipe, an AoE ability. Your spec would have a lot of overlap with cat DPS, too. More relaxed guilds might allow you to tank or DPS, but one's going for realm first probably won't. 
---
As a feral, people may call you a "meme spec" but I wouldn't complain if you excel. Some people would rather have a capable tank than wait longer for an ideal one - especially if it hurts group chemistry or causes them to abandon the run. Besides, I doubt people will be upset if you're willing to tank quest runs, lava runs, for fun, profit, and so on.
---
I mean you could even form the group around that and make sure a warlock was in your group
---
Quality shitepost
---
I like how it didn't occur to you that if it was not allowed they would have not allowed the characters when you make the name in the first place.
---
Oh I took ‚Äúmassive‚Äù to mean like a standard 40-man or something. I am unsure of anything to that scale. I would imagine it was impossible in Vanilla because that many people attacking and defending would have crashed their servers. There might be a possibility in Classic now though.
---
skinning is a lot easier for people to farm so on high pop servers it's gonna be a chore to profit on. the real strategy is using leatherworking to make the gear that brings a bigger profit.
---
You are correct, damn that reputation ruining my post.
---
That dress makes you look fat.
---
The player ego-masturbation went out of fucking control in Legion. So now we are the leaders of entire factions, agencies that have influence across the world? That'd be great if it mattered at all, but it doesn't. BFA just hand-wove away the fact that by all narrative rights, we should STILL HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF LEADERSHIP in our roles as organization leaders. We're not Horde or Alliance soldiers anymore, we're leaders of our own groups now. Except not really, because they can't change the formula that heavily.
---
There's no sensible narrative reason for my character to still be Sylvanas' grunt instead of using my position as Archdruid/Archmage/etc to fight for Azeroth's salvation.
---
It does.
---
Source: I use it.
---
Un Goro? Blasted lands?
---
I play my wl dl-tanking(dots and pet on targetand just spamming drain life(needs improved drain life). But i cant tell u honestly if its the best way.. Its okish for me.. Far better then "let ur pet tank and only use wand so u dont generate too much threat" maybe that works for some ppl but i lovelier spend some gold for drinks then falling asleep because i dont do too much dmg for the crappy voidwalker..
---
I hope they keep it to where you have yo run to wsg to play it...
---
&gt;Hey, I looted a +7 Healing spells green last night.
---
Like anyone is gonna believe that, buddy
---
Sadly there is no way to know if someone is actually going to equip an item when they say they will. When BoEs drop if it isn‚Äôt a twink piece or an epic I generally am okay with chancing it and letting someone have it as an upgrade since if they decide to hearth and sell it on the AH it‚Äôs not a huge loss for the rest of us, maybe a potential few gold at best, but if the person is trustworthy than they get a nice upgrade. For twink blues and pretty much all BoE epics though everyone needing is the best option, when playing with randoms, in guild groups you‚Äôre generally pretty safe to give it to someone as an upgrade or split the gold from selling it but in pugs it is far too common that people just ninja and drop group given the opportunity because some of the items can easily pay for a mount.
---
Let them drop; when healing a DPS is not productive for the group you're within your rights to make that call. There is no reason for a DPS to be pulling aggro on the regular. Your mana/not pulling threat is more important than keeping a DPS up that can't manage threat.
---
The tank chasing down rogue mobs is only going to have him lose threat on the remaining mobs. Keep in mind that like you, the tank only has so much resources to maintain mitigation and aggro generation. 
---
As tank I've had hunters or mages intentionally pull mobs off me to CC, or accidentally pull off me and kite fine. As tank I am trusting the DPS to know what they are doing or at least trust the healer to not over extend their resources. On an AoE pack, it simply comes down to DPS can pull aggro off at least one mob if they are trying to. Threat management needs to be a party effort.
---
I took the boat on Atiesh yesterday at evening at it was working fine :c Hope they fix it soon on your server.
---
Yeah don‚Äôt trust this guy along with the others for RMT. All I got to say. Less than a one percent chance blizz makes a mistake on these, they have logs I‚Äôm sure to prove it.
---
Do you have more info on this? I was under the impression that for pallys there was no 'additional' Holy Resistance but there was still level difference spell resistance. This is the first time I have seen the 39% number.
---
Must have been my pserver i was on last had the requirement @ lvl 60   
---
Was already level 60 in retail vanilla when i did it
---
So how much did you pay?
---
&gt; It may seem faster to just lifetap to 5% of your hp and let me throw a couple of big heals on you, but it's not. 
---
thats because youre not supposed to throw a big heal on them... just an efficient rank of renew and let their passive regen and lifedrain do the rest
---
you've worked yourself up into a fit for nothing
---
Just relax and go where the quests take you
---
Is there an addon that puts something like this in game yet?
---
I play on pvp server and i ran today from Teldrasil to Mulgore as lvl 10 for a pet, and i got killed only once by oposite faction.
---
If I recall correctly that comment was made during a panel for a new/upcoming expansion (maybe WoD?) after the successful but not so hotly received MoP.
---
Now, the choice of words was shitty, but I don't really see how else he could have responded to the question without giving the impression that their newest project is going to fail - you have to believe in what you're selling.
---
Players asking for the old means that the new isn't good, and they were sitting on a brand new package waiting to be delivered - it may have been hot garbage but it was hot garbage they spent a lot of time working on.
---
I still think that was one of the dumbest changes in WoW. I hated MoP.
---
I refuse to share it for free.  Yes.  Its a skill.  Pay me.  U get the DPS for free
---
I‚Äôve been farming Rock Elementals in Badlands. They drops rocks that sell for like 20 silver a stack so you make money and level pretty quick.
---
anyone who isn't selling or buying drugs?
---
" I am not sure where they think that money went, because I certainly do not have it. "
---
the mount. are you serious?
---
Shit, he is horde? If it was alliance I would understand. Horde? Nah, red is dead...
---
Thanks! Ive been one of those people with my nose up (lol) saying no to addons this time through, but this one seems like it doesnt take away from what im looking to get from the game. Ill check it!
---
Tank you!
---
*Looks at bank full of things that "will totally be useful sometime"*
---
 Esfand gave himself onslaught girdle this AM instead of the tanks in his raid. He's a Ret pally for memes
---
Thats exactly what i said im going to do in the post
---
Thank God I haven't run into this in Classic yet, because it's my biggest turnoff of Retail. "Hell Is Other People" is Retail's endgame in a nutshell. Nobody lets you in to groups unless you're so overgeared you don't even need the dungeon, and then they ragequit at the smallest amount of adversity because they're pansies who have probably had everything in life handed to them by Daddy's trust fund.
---
Well if you didnt expect different then what *was* the point of your comment? You say it's not a whine post but the only thing I get from it is a complaint about the content phasing.
---
Your kit is part of the deal. Lockpicking is part of your kit. That's how it is. If you didn't level it, fine, but if you did... it's fair game.
---
I'm having this same struggle myself, even having played since vanilla. First of all, anything with a gray name is vendor trash. White name stuff, especially meats that don't tell you how much health you get when eating, are going to be used for professions like cooking or engineering. These can generally fetch an alright price if you're not going to level the respective profession. Then there's the issue of greens. 
---
If you actually want to start making money on the auction house, definitely make a level 1 character and just run them to the closest capitol  and park them so you can just mail them stuff from your quest area without having to make a trip every time just to empty your bags.
---
Your biggest issue is going to be the cost benefit ratio of whether or not the stuff you're putting up is worth the deposit (if there is one) and if people are even buying that stuff. Secondly, think about how much money you have. It's not a lot, and most everyone else is broke too. Think of that versus the value of convenience when figuring out a price to sell stuff for. I see weapons up for 20 silver and I think to myself that's never gonna sell because they're gonna outgrow it before they get their money's worth.
---
A good rule of thumb for me on greens is if it's got both caster and melee stats, just vend that shit because you're gonna have to put it up on AH for so cheap the deposit versus the chance of sale versus how much the vendor will give you never seems to weigh out.
---
Simply having a bank alt will relieve your bag space problem and give you more breathing room to figure out whether it's worth putting up on auction house or just vending it. Plus the alt will be right next to a bank of you just want to shove something in there and figure it out later.
---
Hope this helps!
---
It needs to go its own direction to have sustainability.  Don't repeat the same expansions and content shifts retail went through.  Classic wow is good because it's not retail.
---
The answer is quite simple, do dungeons. 
---
At level 34, you're right in the middle of the population pack. A quest which should take 30 minutes will end up taking hours. Questing for leveling up tends to drop off significantly around level 40. Grinding dungeons is steady XP &amp; gold. Your gear will constantly be up to date heading towards 60.
---
You also benefit from learning how to play your class in a group environment. You learn how other classes play, allowing you to better yourself as a teammate. You also (depending on class) can learn a thing or two when playing with another of the same class member in a party. 
---
There are so many benefits to doing dungeons that you're only hurting yourself by avoiding them. I'm so far ahead of my friends who refuse to dungeon grind.
---
Hey Boss, what time are you logging on tonight? :P
---
Thats up to blizzard. I believe the issue with FD/Trap is coming from the incorrect processing in spell batching, let me explain.
---
The spell batching window is 0.4 seconds (citacion needed), but currecntly, when you Feign Death, the server will spell batch your input to the server,and then the response (wether or not the enemy has resisted it) will also be spell batched, so depending on your ping we are looking at around 0.9 seconds of delay. On top of this, FD sometimes doesnt even go off which makes me question how it is even being processed. It is defnitely up to blizzard tho.
---
None, walk to stores through town with just a lantern.
---
 Same here, no classic launch option.
---
Blizzard really needs to open up a server transfer from ZT to some low pop PvP server so all the people who don't care about rp can leave. It's not as bad as you describe, but people who break the rp server naming rules are there unfortunately. I have reported a ton of them so far. Only one person has shown Troll behavior so far.
---
If you go on an Rp server put at least some effort into your name. Nobody forces you to roleplay, but at least, choose a rp friendly name.
---
You're off to a great start already.
---
The first step is to unbind Q &amp; E, and change A &amp; D to strafe. This forces you to get more comfortable with your mouse.
---
Next step is to take any abilities you often use and move them closer to WASD. You'll want to set up the keybinds on a second bar for Q, E, R and F.
---
At this point, you'll just want to juggle your abilities around between 1,2,3,4,5,Q,E,R,F until you find binds that are comfortable for you to use. For example, you might not want any instant-cast on 2, because that's hard to hit while running forward and mousing. Same with E, Q and strafing - you'll find it awkward to hit either of those buttons while strafing in that direction.
---
Once you're comfortable with all those extra key presses, you can start expanding! I'd try binding \~, T, G, and adding a Shift modifier to some of your spells. That should give you enough keys to hit all of your abilities, without moving your hands or needing a new mouse.
---
I wouldn't bother with Ctrl &amp; Alt modifiers, or Z, X, C, V unless you're comfortable (or trying to PvP as a Shaman). Please keep in mind that different people have different sized hands and different shaped keyboards. I can't comfortably hit my left Ctrl, but I can hit my left Alt.
---
On retail, I have a schema that I use with most of my characters (q is movement \[sprint, dash, heroic leap\], e is reactive \[pistol shot, ignore pain\], r is heal) but that only works because of class homogenization, and is less applicable to Classic.
---
do you want us to start a PR riot on your behalf? go through the proper channels, they have like 3 ways to contact support
---
Nice, will definitely give that a peek, thanks!
---
How's that?  I got sunder from the lvl 10 warrior quest I thought.
---
Post removed. Send a ticket to Blizzard support.
---
I didn‚Äôt port him I just teleported TO him to make him bags at his request.  I thankfully broke even on silver but lost my time.  And as we all know *Goblin Voice* Time is Money Friend!
---
'Twas but a joke, my friend. Though 2h stave + shield would be pretty legit. And of course, only pallys could do it.
---
I have this but literally no idea how to use it. Can you recommend any guides for hunters like me?
---
If it's your first time playing just level at your own pace and enjoy the game.  Yes there are quest chains and things that make you spend large amounts of time running or flying around but that is part of the experience.  You'll get better at becoming more efficient in how you travel.
---
One word of note is that the first time you enter a zone you should immediately go find the flight path for that zone assuming it has one and get the flight path.  That saves a lot of headaches later but still won't help some of the long runs.
---
Don't do a leveling guide as those are just meant to blast through leveling as fast as you can and (IMO) ruin the experience.
---
He's like lvl 53, so far regardless he's been more efficient than all the people I know IRL lol
---
yep agreed. your wand is probably 20dps and your dots will do plenty of damage. Don't want your cloth-wearing feeble body to pull aggro from the tank anyway
---
All those things are part of the deal.  You get a rogue for the DPS.  Lockpicking is extra.  If its that important, tell me when you LFM
---
hmm, that's weird then. Let me recheck some more streams.
---
You can get a good one from Uldaman quest chain that starts from a necklace drop from dwarves outside the instance.
---
Yea that's what I'm trying to figure out &gt;.&lt;
---
I'm assuming it's "whenever you start having problems" type of answer. Was hoping for a "you should start taking gear more seriously at level 47" kind of answer.
---
I rolled a druid to travel faster in booty bay,
---
Now it's my 
---
EX-MAAAIN,
---
EX-MAAAAAAIIIIIIN!
---
That's funny. I'm English and I'd argue that spirit could almost be used as a synonym for willpower in many cases.
---
This shits so annoying at least tip your mages. Pisses me off to no end when I‚Äôm killing mobs and your standing behind me waiting for me to kill. I‚Äôm now oil and you ask for water. Go fuck yourself.
---
Priest is so freaking easy and efficient, man. Get a wand, put 5 into wand spec, 5 into spirit tap, the rest wherever you want.
---
Solo: Every mob, start with a holy fire, SW:P when it finishes, smite until it gets to you, wand until it dies. While you're on your way to the next mob, your spirit tap will have you full mana/hp, if not, renew yourself. Don't bubble yourself ever because it's an enormous waste of mana, treat your health bare like a mana bar (as in, a resource to be consumed).
---
Party: Do the above, but try to last hit the minion with a spell like smite/MB to proc spirit tap.
---
Rinse/repeat/try not to die from boredom. Just make sure to keep upgrading your wand as you level, makes an enormous difference in speed.
---
Hello ! New 33 yo player from Switzerland here ! I am toying with the idea of making a paladin but the slow levelling is a bit off putting. I saw your message and that‚Äôs exactly my idea of the game : blind and taking the time. I have time only in the evenings and pretty irregularly (intense game for some weeks, then out, then back again), but motivated to grind and advance with friends. If you‚Äôre interested, shoot me a message ! In any case, good luck !
---
I had quit after doing everything i wanted to in 8.2 until classic came out and im hooked. Once i've had my fun or get bored chances are i won't go back to retail unless the next major content patch that comes out interests me or 9.0.
---
Well it's just money... and we all know Blizzard only listens when you use your wallet to get your point across to them.
---
I mean, you did attack them technically, but whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
I also agree that they'll eventually have deserved it so it's probably give.
---
noooo sunder armor is much better
---
Heh. I got a little bit of that #nochange Classic WoW for you but... it's gonna cost ya. Only the first ones free.
---
Basically these games are the most fun when you are just some guy trying to make it in the world.   Also since mobs are actually very dangerous and dying sucks you do feel weak.  I mean these random elite orcs in Red Ridge can smoke an entire group of lvl 20s if you aren't careful.
---
Heals are part of the deal when u join a group.   Just like my dps
---
Queue Heroic Strike.
---
Wait.
---
Wait
---
Miss. FTFY
---
Have you spoken with customer service yet?
---
The thing is I have been dual wielding since 20. I‚Äôm level 29 now and I‚Äôm still top dps in dungeons with mages coming close. I just can‚Äôt see my self using 2h I love the animations and feeling of dualwield. Yes I have points where i miss quite a bit but usually only on mobs that are too high level, and that can be said for any class. 
---
I love dual wield because it‚Äôs just how I want to play my warrior.
---
I‚Äôve read quite a bit and yeah everyone says 2h is better etc slow swing speed is higher dmg on abilities , so I use a slower weapon (1h sword) main hand and a faster weapon (dagger) in off hand and it‚Äôs been amazing. Although I would probably yield better results with 2h I can‚Äôt ditch my strat just yet. Since the results (top dps) are still doing me well.
---
American Servers have always seen more support than european ones. Hopefully they will force some name changes soon.
---
You missed the part where mages hand out food/drinks
---
yeah, undercity elevator killed me 2 times in a row last night. i somehow wasn't completely off when it closed and dropped so i fell off the lip and died to the fall on the elevator wall about half way down, then in ghost form, couldn't res when the elevator was at the top, so resed as soon as i could and fell to my death again...
---
this i the WoW i love and remember
---
No changes
---
They can tank any 5 man with little effort. They can even tank raid mobs, but they just cant hold boss aggro. Druids on the other hand can pretty much tank everything up to Naxx if they have the correct set up. Druids are actually the better tank for MC progression since they are less gear dependent then warriors.
---
That's just the level difference resistance at +5. Pretty harsh.
---
Rofl I know, I hope this meme never gets old. Fuck, it's so good.
---
Its maintenance. They announced it a few days ago. Expected to last another 10 to 20 minutes.
---
As a former streamer with an average viewer count of around 1200 (lol) back in 2011-13 I can tell you that most streamers are broken people. Sociopaths even. They prey on others mostly kids for money and in game items. Of course there are some good well adjusted streamers, usually with families but it's been my experience that "streamers" are in the same vein as drug dealers.
---
Horrible role models, horrible people and best to avoid them. If you want to share your content do youtube in an honest way.
---
Very cool but he's only a 2.0 attack speed cat.  I get that he's white but you should have run to Mulgore and gotten The Rake, 1.2 attack speed.  He's the best pet from level 10-37 until you can get Broken Tooth and his 1.0 attack speed.
---
I have, you should take your own advice.
---
First of all, WW has a rage cost of 25. It does your weapon damage.
---
With my current gear/level, WW does 300 damage, for 25 rage.
---
Heroic strike gives 111 bonus damage, for 25 rage. (Don't include the autoattack damage since you would have autoattacked anyway regardless of using HS or not)
---
The only thing to consider is that WW doesn't offer any rage refund even if it doesn't connect. Even factoring this in, WW is still more rage efficient.
---
They life tap, so they can eat food, while the healer drinks. Only time they shouldnt do this, is while the healer is oom.
---
You are not the first with this issue today...I am even more sure it's the automated system going out of control right now because they literally have no humans employed to do this one by one.
---
But I want a god damn long cloak, no cloak above ilvl 20+ should be SHORT
---
God, the drama in Westfall for saying you want people level 18+! I don't think it's elitist to want a tank who can hit Van Cleef...but a lot of people have opinions about that.
---
Anyway, I agree; it's better to be at least in the middle of the levels, so that the final boss isn't red to you, and if I'm that level I expect the people going with me to be of a similar level.
---
We tried Uldaman with a bunch of 42s and 43s and we legit couldn't take down the final boss. Warriors hit him for nothing, my spells all got resisted... Only the hunter stood a chance. Couldn't carry us all, though. It was a valiant attempt, but awful.
---
I didn‚Äôt expect to be personally attacked like this today.
---
The appropriate channels take 3 days, and by then the ID is already lost and 39 people hate me for not inviting them to a raid they were commited to. I can't even tell anyone who to invite, since I can'T access the friendslist with a banned account
---
If you are playing a Tauren, you have a 1m deadzone. You can fuck right off with that. 
---
Side note: it doesn't matter because spell batching has broken your PVP effectiveness anyway.
---
Enjoy the crime, do the time.
---
It was common(ish) knowledge, then the game changed dramatically and the people who knew this shit stopped playing.
---
I haven't played since MoP dropped and am loving all the Rogues who forgot that Hunters are their fucking death in Vanilla.
---
Yeah I said "people like you" for a reason.
---
Anything with 5/5 Wand Specialization and 5/5 Spirit Tap will do fine at solo questing.
---
At 38, if you want to be in Holy I would consider something like: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/05-10505103002-5002
---
In fights you open with Holy Fire &amp; Shadow Word: Pain, put on Power Word: Shield, cast Smite until you're at 60-75% mana, and finish them off with your wand.
---
Basic abilities are part of the deal when u join a group.  Dps heals, rez, tanking etc...LP is a skill/profession.   Extra
---
I use S and Shift S on every ranged class, but I need backpedal on melee classes - especially when I'm tanking.
---
It depends on what weapons you have but there's not some significant reason to go 2h over 1h. Fury is about rage generation first
---
nope. just stops it from attacking you.
---
No, but you'd be surprised how 1 little thing can tear your reputation up. I can't wait for the first known ninja from a raid happens. That person will have to reroll or quit classic entirely. Whitemane already has people who are known in the community and I think that character might be finished.
---
I'm having the opposite problem. Guilds won't stop spamming with random invites. I find it very impolite.

Who the hell is gonna know yet man? No one knows what server, no one has any gold, no one knows what the demand for level 21 BoE blues is yet.
---
Oh, I agree but what to do...
---
Ehhhhh rip
---
Well, I think the culprit here is layering obviously. Because each time I am out in the world were experiencing completely opposite things.
---
Maybe he sold that green item in a private transaction with no proceeding communication between either player for 15,000% more than it is listed on the AH......
---
That lvl 24 blue chest, though.
---
Herod is pretty densely populated, good economy and community.
---
Blizz can't stop botters, gold sellers, and real money sales. I'm confident they only allow accents because they don't know how to prevent it. They can't outsmart the weebs who use them.
---
stalagg is awesome and pretty damn close in alliance and horde numbers
---
I mean the hamstring swing timer method is still very much a thing.
---
Outside of that if you're looking for a guide you're better off getting something like azeroth auto pilot and focusing on green mobs and quests
---
Ah, I wouldn't know then
---
Buy some of the fish recipes and scout some early game raw fish on the AH. Its beyond me why people sell so much of it and for so little, but hey it's there. 
---
The other day I bought 240 raw rockscale(?) Cod for 90 copper buyout a stack. Took me to 225 for basically free and I have loads of food for my pet now lol. 
---
The recipes that take spices have an unusually high vendor rate. Often you can buy some of the 125-200 recipe meats that are more expensive and end up profiting slightly or breaking even
---
WW and chill?
---
I have not AOE grinded, but as ive told, ive been 60 for 3 whole days, do you know how much gold you make on average for one strat live run? cus i do and its pretty fucking good money, do you know how fast you can find a grp as a tank? cus i do, and mount is only 900 gold not 1k
---
most effecient one is farmin SM GY, then lib, then armory then cath, then zulfarak
---
Aye, same thing, addons disabled, cleared cache and wtf folders as well. Doesn't seem to be something within our power to fix
---
Same here.
---
Idk about you but I can‚Äôt just ignore my gold. I somehow always find things to spend it on. My epic mount is 100% going to be a chore
---
~~counter strike~~ Doom
---
Tanked it as a 34 druid with a level 30 holy priest, breezed right through the whole thing. I seem to remember it being tougher?
---
This sounds fantastic, can't wait for the launch!
---
Sorry for the confusion. My guild actually captured a man from Poland and was holding him captive.
---
I leveled from 26-31 grinding there and got Two of them to drop.
---
On-top of Flame Sacs (Auction House sales for Fire Res Pots)
---
Large Claws and Sharp Fangs (Alchemy materials)
---
Plus they drop coin and a lot of Green items.
---
Whelps have low health, low armor and slow attacks. They also natively (all Dragonkin) have a higher chance to drop Green and Blue items.
---
I did not use Soul bags. I actually still don‚Äôt have one. I don‚Äôt prefer than for the same reasons you listed. I have a WA that shows me how many shards I have and I just arrange them in my bags when I running around or on a FP. I can see one BG‚Äôs Begin to get one and keep it full, but for right now, I just keep 4-5 on me and then when I‚Äôm dungeons about 10 on me.
---
no no no, that was a passive-aggressive "joke", like he actually meant it, but was willing to sell it as a joke.
---
&gt; black cherry
---
My sister grabbed the whole variety pack when we went to the beach for a family vacation.
---
I agree on most parts, I was impressed with the taste and the overall lightness of the drink.  I slammed a couple but returned to beer because i didn't want to drink them all.
---
The issue is price for me, I dont know how much a 12 pack is, but if it is over like 13-14 bucks, it is a bit much.  I can stick with light pisswater if I'm planning on getting blotto.

It boils down to where the chest is and how you even got there in the first place. If you want uncontested dibs on a dungeon chest then you need to go and stealth there yourself solo. If we worked together as a group to get there over X amount of time, then we all have equal claim to the contents of the chest. You wouldn't have even had access to said chest if it wasn't for the rest of your team.

Fine words for one born from the wrong end of a guar.
---
&gt;How can I overlay or hide minimap and / or chat? Or do I need to use some editor after recording  for that?
---
Are you worried about stream sniping? If you aren't streaming, you would need to cover it post recording. It just saves the last X minutes of gameplay, sounds and all.
---
&gt;Does it record game sounds AND discord or can I chat with my guild without it recording our super secret pvp strategies?
---
It records everything, BUT there are free programs out there that utilize VAC (virtual audio cables) that you can use to remove things like discord from the recording without losing game sounds. There's guides online for this, and a great free VAC program is Voicemeeter.
---
&gt;And, what's the best keys to bind to? Full keyboard. I use my mouse and keyboard binds to play, no keyboard turning and no mouse clicking on ui spells. The wonky apostrophe is my push to talk button.
---
I bound it to Alt+F1 but it's up to you really.
---
Hinterlands, searing gorge, feralas, Tanaris, Azshara. If you did ALL the quests for each of these zones (which it doesn‚Äôt seem like you have) grind ogres or something in southern Tanaris. 
---
People underestimate the power of grinding.
---
As someone playing retri for leveling I can confirm. I do no like half the dmg of a rogue or warrior of the same lvl unless it is undead or a demon. Still find groups en mass√©.
---
I thought q and e were defaulted to strafe in wow so that's how I've always done it. I usually unbind wasd for keybinds myself. Too used to moving with my mouse
---
BGs aren't in Classic right now.
---
Warlocks have so many health return options I will *at most* toss a Renew on them unless they take an AoE or limited aggro damage, then they can have some real heals. 
---
Otherwise, let the locks do their own thing. As weird as it sounds and coming from the healer mentality it does feel stramge to purposefully let a party member hover around 50% or less health but they're pretty much on their own fucking program as far as HP/MP is concerned.
---
Gotta jump zones. Hillsbrad, shimmering flats, stv, desolace, Arathi,
---
That‚Äôs not at all what I said. I understand the connection you are trying to make. I was just pointing out there‚Äôs no basis for your argument in this context; I‚Äôm also saying you cannot see past what you want to see. 
---
People are trying to have a calm discussion with you about WoW and you go off about how rude they are to you. 
---
Then people point out that no one is being rude, so you start insulting them and trying to use the excuse they are from a different country as a citation that they are ignorant. 
---
Literally, you have just been rude this whole thread ‚Äúlooking down **your** nose at **us**‚Äù. Because:
---
1) we have a different opinion on rage use in WoW 
---
2) we don‚Äôt see others as being rude to you (which you haven‚Äôt cited anything we have said that is actually rude)
---
3) for being from a different country. 
---
Then you play the victim. Please make some kind of citation about what we have said is rude, and not just a general claim of the entire comment. 
---
I‚Äôm literally here telling you, no one here has meant to be condescending. If you are picking up that tone, that‚Äôs not what we are laying down. Why are you trying to belittle people or get angry with them for having a different opinion?
---
&gt;you won't get banned for being rude.
---
&gt;&gt;I'm not talking about Blizzard banning anyone.
---
Maybe you should proofread your own comments before you get on your high horse flaming people for "misunderstanding a very simple comment."
---
Bankstack won't sort my bags. There's no response when I click to sort. Could be from my ammo pouch? Who knows. I'm sad though.
---
Then find a new game. I don't know what you're getting at. If it's not fun, then don't play. No one is making you, unless you're one of the chinese gold farmers because they're probably being made to play.
---
Same - disabled addons and deleted cache still not working
---
my game is crashing
---
You like it until you hit the new rank of water/food and need to make ik in 2's again.
---
I'm assuming its primarily because STV is also a warzone so people head to hillsbrad with a chip on their shoulder. 
---
I'm just a simple lil mage trying to start WWIII
---
Right, but you'll lose half your guild if you suddenly decide you're just going to be a PvP guild. They've got to make that distinction upfront.
---
twill or gtfo
---
There was no xp gain in BGs in Classic, except maybe in AV when killing neutral mobs/beasts.
---
I use a/d strafe and qerfgxcv with shift modifiers for my main spells and 12345 for the occasional ones.
---
Yeah i basically keep getting errors when starting up WoW agian
---
I'm glad to hear youre not bored of it, I was just saying at any point you get bored of the grind, creating a new alt will refresh that.
---
Reps to grind, I suggest Argent Dawn first(wear the commission and grind undead in plaguelands), timbermaw in felwood and winterspring depending on your current rep, cenarion circle (I dont know if you can farm it just yet or wait til AQ phase). If you are alliance, you can try farm winterspring rep for the the special frostsaber mount.
---
I couldnt not write it up. Its 100% what i remember vanilla being haha.
---
Great idea. I've been saying this as soon as classic came out
---
if youre on the west coast Rattlegore has a ton of people
---
Yea I‚Äôm getting a fatal error instantly upon login.
---
sauce?
---
Normal retail raids are way WAY more chill than any LFR.  The vast majority of times I've vote kicked somebody that was actually present it was because someone was raging at a random hunter so much that it actually stopped the raid from progressing.
---
Meanwhile most of the normals I've been had friendly bants amongst the members and if the raid lead said anything it was something along the lines of "just hit it until it dies".
---
I think it game later on if I'm not mistaken. Since people used to twink characters for BG's (get to 19 and sit there with the BIS for that range). I think the experience was added later to prevent twinking.
---
I was the 69 upvote on this post.
---
I think it's just cause they can't stand to see a decent, playable wow.  Retail Zoomers are cancer.
---
Damn, the remastered Radiohead - The Bends album art looks sick.
---
If you want to discuss classic + changes
---
there's a forum for that /r/classicwowplus also.
---
but this isn't it.
---
Don't give a Flying F about oldshool Runescape. Take this back to their subs.
---
Don't forget we're broke af.
---
Like MrBonez said, BGs aren't in classic right now, and no there is no XP in BGs in Vanilla.
---
missing necklace from ZF graves..
---
Great! thank you!
---
Your tank just isn't doing his job. If you do it right, then everything hits only you.
---
I started off giving hunters Wisdom until an overwhelming majority asked for Might. So now I give Might and not one of them has said anything. /shrug
---
Oh don't get me wrong all other classes can mess up. I've seen Lock's send their pet on the wrong trash Mob in Ubers and pull two additional pacts. I've accidentally gotten caught in stealth when trying to sap as a rogue. It just feels like Hunters do it so much more and on a such grander scale than most other classes.
---
Did you try it out this past weekend, when all the servers were getting DDOSed? Most people couldn't even connect, and those that could experienced huge amounts of lag.
---
Don't feel bad. You're looking out for yourself and your fun in the game. And having a good guild can make it a lot better so it makes sense searching for that right one. Or, maybe it gets to the point where you start your own so you can be picky with who you let in.
---
I don‚Äôt remember the name of the food and water throughout the game because almost every Inn has different kinds. But every 10 levels(5-15-25-35-45-55) you unlock a new Food/water and every ten levels just stick up. They can be kind of pricey at times if you‚Äôre not sitting good with money, so ask a Guildie Mage for some food and make sure to tip him.!
---
Your just mad their going to ban your dumb name.
---
You're level 25 and thinking about raiding??? What the hell??? Is your gear even enchanted????
---
No, today was scheduled maintenance. It's just now ending.
---
Yup having the same problem
---
 Yeah its crashing
---
That doesn't sound like a real issue
---
I'm so frugal I can't force my self to buy any gear or any materials. So I figure as long as I play the game the epic mount would just happen. I just wanted to know what I should do to keep my self busy that long honestly
---
Battlegrounds aren't in the game yet. They'll be released in Phase 3, and won't give XP. That's why twinks were possible before you could disable xp. 
---
For now all the PvP is world PvP, for no honor. The honor/rank system will be next phase and will be a world PvP bonanza.
---
same here
---
Yea, its rarely used due to portals, but it exists
---
People who enjoy inflicting emotional distress on others are people you don't want to turn your back on.
---
If you aren't spastically jumping/running around while playing melee, are you even really playing the game?
---
&gt; Lady Falther'ess' Finger from RFD
---
Pretty sure she was added for the scourge invasion events, so she isn't present in-game.
---
Whitemane.  All other servers are pleb servers if you disagree meet me in the parking lot at blizzcon
---
Thanks for the info. I'm an undead and at lvl 13 I see my only option would be a dungeon all the way in Ogrimmar. So I'm supposed to just travel halfway across the globe to do a dungeon? I assume that once you travel there you would grind the hell out of that particular dungeon and/or continue your questing there instead of travelling back?
---
Depends on what you want to do. If you just want to make gold, some gathering profession like skinning or mining will make you cash. It's very common to pair Tailoring and Enchanting, as tailor is the only gear crafting prof that doesn't require a paired gathering skill. Additionally, since you're a lock you'll benefit from your own cloth gear, and the greens made from leveling tailoring can be disenchanted to feed your enchanting level.  
---
Level-wise you're already good; requirement to entry on crafting skills is lvl 5 for the base 75 cap, and lvl 10 to open up 150.
---
It's sad but it's true
---
I have heard about that one before, but I also heard about it at launch being very long queues, will look into.  Thanks!
---
lulz. A hunters pet has no chance of matching the threat generation of a shaman.
---
Ofcourse i know what they are talking about! They wrote in their mail that i am banned for RMT, so why wouldnt i bring up gold? And no they dont have anything, cus i havent bought anything, the more comments you guys right, the more confident i am that i am getting my account back.
---
Wish I had been recording but my burly Tauren Shaman made a last ditch jump to get on that zeppelin and ended up right on the edge next to the cargo nets. Zoned in in Tirisfal and fell into the water. Long walk to UC lol
---
I'm brand new. I played a Hunter on retail in BfA to like level 90 but gave up because it was just a single player game and it was very hard to get help. Classic I'm a warrior and have no clue what I'm doing. But everyone is super helpful and when I tell them I'm new to WoW when doing dungeons they are quick to give pointers and assistance.
---
Its worth noting that often times people will train new pets to get higher ranks of pet skills that only the higher level pet has. These skills can be learned to you as the hunter to be taught to your other pets that are able to use them. For example let's say you have a cat with Claw rank 2, but you are a higher level and want your cat to have Claw rank 5. You can stable your old pet, tame a pet with Claw rank 5, use that new pet to fight a mob or 2 and you should learn Claw rank 5. Then you can abandon the new pet and teach rank 5 to your old already loyalty 6 pet.
---
I haven't seen a `tk` TLD being used since... well since WoW was a new game :)
---
But there is a difference.  One is a skill the other is a profession.  A party doesn't have a right to your professions unless you were brought in specifically for your profession.  With Skills every player's skills are part of the part whole.  If we agree that rogues don't have to use their skills for the party what is stopping any other class from having to use their skills?  Priests can just decide that healing isn't happening?  Tanks decide that taunt isn't on the menu? No, in a party all skills are part of the party's kit.  Don't want to pick locks? Go solo.
---
Really liking Kromcrush alliance.  We're not like the Alliance you read about on the forums hiding from the Horde and getting wrecked constantly.  Horde are running away from US in Stranglethorn.  It's probably the most balanced East Coast PvP server.
---
I completely agree w/you if I was going to go MS.
---
Ah right
---
Yes.
---
Only epic boe that dropped for me was the icemail jerkin. Needless to say I was quite sad it wasn't an actually good boe. Sold for a good 50g tho to some poor chap
---
That man is playing priest the right way
---
I've used a mouse with a 12 button thumbgrid since Razer came out with the first Naga. It's dead but I still have it laying around. 
---
Between that thumbgrid, the forward and back buttons on top of the mouse and modifiers Shift, Control, and Alt I have access to 56 keybonds without having to touch a key on my keyboard.
---
"it" means the AH thing. Could have been worded more clearly I suppose.
---
Thanks to you fellow Paladin for saving our land!
---
"You better be threatening me with a higher buff, no one got time for that 30 HP waste of unlimited buff slots."
---
I've read that as well, but I can confirm it's not true on classic. I've tried for a couple days and I've always gotten the Improves DS buff even with my pet still hitting the target. Either I'm incredibly lucky or pet hits count as yours in regard to the talent.
---

---
It's really not bad at all during the day. I live in central time so I get home from work ~2 hours before the west coasters so I'm assuming that's why I'm getting in so easily. 
---
Also a 20 minute queue queue isn't even that bad. Just go make a snack to eat or something lol
---
Oh yeah, for sure.
---
I had every race/class/profession maxed out on both factions back in the day.  It was a really fun time-sink.  Any time I got a world drop, etc, I knew exactly which alt needed it.  =)   And I could do all the professions myself, so I didn't need any help from other players, and I could really play the AH well.
---
lol mages are KOS to me at any level. just completely busted atm in pvp w/o trinkets
---
There‚Äôs no good farm in Mara. We tried a couple times. So ZF Farming graves is the best. However, it‚Äôs so damn slow at 50-51-52 that we went to like 50.5 and then went to Ungoro to quest until 52 which only took a couple hours since there‚Äôs SOOOO many quests out there. Plus one of our alternative Pre-BIS Offhands come from a long quest chain out there.
---
Because mage armor allows for mana regen while casting, thus bringing your spirit into play.
---
Try learning to strafe with a mouse with two thumb buttons sometime if you are bored. It's awesome
---
I feel like it'd be super confusing to be in your head.
---
I have a handful of similar macros bound to different keys for different situations. The one that gets the most use is my Charge -&gt; Defensive Stance macro when tanking dungeons followed by my Charge -&gt; Berserker stance as DPS in dungeons.
---
Classic wow is drastically easier than retail
---
Yeah if that's the case I'll probably transfer anyway but I'm going to message support about it and see what they have to say. If it really is the only option I will transfer anyway to netherwind but if possible I would rather get to a realm that isn't connected to thalnos. It's really unfortunate because I don't follow whatever part of the community this was broadcast on and it sucks being on a server predominantly populated with people from a different country with a different language and a very different attitude and play style than what Im looking for.
---
RATTLEGORE FOR ALLIANCE
---
Kromcrush ?
---
Every crash log contains some kind of battle.net gamer id from my friends list... probably related to battle.net friends list not syncing properly causing a buffer overflow in the client... perhaps people with only a short friends list are avoiding the crash.
---
Think of all the xp they'd get from exploring and grouping with the 60 that does the killing.
---
Does your pet need intelligence. I can do that
---
That could be.  I'm not aware of what MMO that might have been, but that certainly doesn't mean that it didn't exist.
---
Reinstalling the game does NOT work either.
---
I dont think it is my friend
---
It depends on your reason tbh. A toooon of people on PvP servers switched to horde because either they saw their favorite streamer was playing Horde or heard that the racials were sooo much better for PvP.
---
I'll admit that the racials definitely are better. But even if humans had their free trinket racial there is no fucking way I'd switch because of that. I just don't like people who choose race/class based on flavor of the month stupidity. Now we're seeing a huuuuge faction imbalance on almost all of the PvP servers
---
...and for those players who think it's cute to steal pick-up items in the world while we fight off the mob that was on top of it, please go back to retail where you belong.  I've seen way too much of this along with mob steals just so they can get done a few seconds quicker than everyone else.
---
I'm not sure to be honest. I don't really hamstring kite. I only use it when their health gets low enough to risk running away. But Charge - Demoralize Shout - Rend - Sunders is working for me so far.
---
Very reassuring.
---
Why would we try to troubleshoot when we are all getting the error...
---
This is what I've ended up doing, except I like to keep Heal 1 available in case shits hitting the fan and I am super low on mana and need an inexpensive heal to get off on the tank.
---
Yeah that was more of a "do you really think this is going to work" than a solution. They're saying follow their troubleshooting options (this) while they look into it- im just gonna go to the gym and come back later lol
---
It's really frustrating because the classic chat functions are what I am used to, not the newer retail functions.
---
Additionally, each point of stamina is worth 10 HP.
---
Cool name lol
---
Its very generous though. I ran to taurajo, forgot i had the timed quest and dicked around there for a while, killing thunderlizards. I still made it with 15minutes to spare.
---
So glad I rolled PvE this time and don‚Äôt have to worry about that. It was awesome when I was playing Vanilla at 20, but at 35 I don‚Äôt have near as much time to play. Not having to worry about being camped or ganked really makes my playtime much more enjoyable.
---
Can confirm, took and arm,leg and a bit of my soul to Max out my skinning and getting tribal leatherworking for my two devilsaur patterns.
---
As a dedicated healer,  I appreciate folks prioritizing tank target but I have noticed some very competent dps that does a great job off-tanking or small-loop kiting.
---
I think every dungeon I have done in classic has been varying degrees of great. Myzrael is damned good server for PvE.
---
This is actually about the highest CC comp you can have in vanilla with out duplicating classes. Mage/Hunter/Lock Sheep/Trap/Succubus
---
Oh is it a month ago again?
---
It did not.  Looks like a widespread, though not universal issue.
---
Thanks for the tip! I‚Äôll try that on the next one!
---
As much as everyone says to remove Q and E I just can't, I've played to 2.2k rating in arenas and have steadily cleared mythic raids on live and have just about everything else bound but I can't change those buttons because I'm scared I'll try to strafe and pop a CD recklessly.
---
That being said, if you suffer the same fate try out the following binds.
---
12345
---
Shift + 12345
---
RTFGCVXB
---
Shift/ctrl/alt + RTFGVCXB
---
Any mouse buttons, I have one of those simple razer mouses with 2 buttons on the side. I used to have an MMO mouse but I found that they were really unhelpful because of how often I'd fat finger a button while simply moving the mouse around.
---
That being said, if you have a simple mouse with no extra buttons, Mouse wheel up/down and pressed IN are really great binds as well.
---
why so?
---
You Mad bro? Classic is fun but it is a very flawed game, Which is why many improvements in the form of BC came along
---
Thanks ;) my ego can't endure that meh !
---
My sunder's currently bound to 8 üòà
---
ClassicWoah\*
---
Tanking and healing are absolutely skills, but they're explicitly asked for "LFM tank" "LFM heals" "LFM dps"  those are the necessary components.  The lockpicking is vestigial and doesnt actually contribute to the completion of the instance.  Also, those locked crates are usually worth up to a gold
---
Imagining being this uninformed.
---
Happened to me as well. A priest MCed me and gave me fort.
---
Level 40. Riperoni
---
Shattering, Sundering was the maelstrom thing ;) (i had to look it up for my post lol)
---
Agreed, questing was damn easy. I can't remember which expansion it was, and I'm 98% sure this actually happened, but I was questing with an alt in Redridge, I got the quests that took you to that elite keep atop the mountain across from the farm you grind lockpicking at. I was staring at the mobs and they were all elite, then they faded out and reloaded as non-elite... My best theory is I had the area cached at first and it took a sec or two to load the correct info from the server. It was weird.
---
I remember levelling was no longer a group based thing aside from dungeons as of that point
---
Yeah, gotta do a full clear \*and\* keep your eyes peeled for more. We did this and had a couple people that needed more (I think 3 total) after the final boss so we walked back through the dungeon and had people pick up some that had respawned.
---
depends highly on what objectives are contested. aint no alliance getting nifty stopwatch any decent population pvp server
---
Each full realm gets a specific server to transfer to.
---
Quest from the goblins in the engineering shop in Orgrimmar. One quest for the teleporter, another for some pretty amazing blues (especially the pants for agi wearers...they'll last you into your 50's and you can complete gnomer at like 30).
---
Yes. And remove it if it's not the maxed based on their level. /s
---
I think I‚Äôll look into it

Idk...
---
lol i "camped" one person so far (killed 3x in a row) and they eventually spirit rezzed and mounted up.  Why? because they killed me the day before while I had mobs on me.
---
No shame at all. not mentally ill I think.
---
That tower was always there in classic you could not see it.
---
It‚Äôs an artifact of planar reflections. They do a second render from under the water, and since this can be expensive they usually skip rendering minor details.
---
"Time is money, friend!"
---
True, I‚Äôll probably farm at 60 but want the base stat stick for leveling.
---
lmao true
---
Let's see, at that level I did, roughly:
---
\- Tanaris (45-ish)
---
\- finish up STV (some quests in that range)
---
\- Feralas
---
\- Hinterlands
---
\- Blasted Lands has a bunch of gathering quests that are level 50
---
\- If you haven't done it, a full quest run of Uldaman (you're a tad high, but boss is 47) and Maraudon (Boss is 51) will be a ton of xp.
---
Hope that helps!
---
No works ok for me and you can even set it to embed in your chat window to save space. Might just need to search for a guide because it has a lot of settings. But once you figure it out it's great.
---
I've been getting that error too.  what system are you running?  I have a ryzen 1700x and a 1050ti.
---
I‚Äôm not online to check. I can confirm later when I get back home. But I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs nothing to brag about. I remained logged in and used a program on my mouse to automatically strafe every 12 minutes so I wouldn‚Äôt get logged out when I slept and get stuck in a queue again. Lol
---
Imagine being this out of the loop.
---
Wasn't always a thing though, right?
---
I can't log in either on any of my characters regardless of location/faction/server. I'm getting the same error and force closed every time.
---
Strongly disagree. Obviously there is a situation for everything, but the vast majority of the time you should not deliberately top the party of.
---
Using low rank spells to avoid overheating is Mana efficient, it doesn't matter hope cheap the spells are. If you downrank, you are delaying your 5 second rule then which means more time drinking. This is in addition to the Mana and time spent casting those low rank spells, which also both mean more drinking.
---
Generally, you should only heal people if they are in danger or you can heal them efficiently (in both time and Mana). Often that means using high rank spells, not low rank, but it depends on the spell and your gear of course.
---
If somebody is not in danger, and you can't top them without overhealing or spamming some shitty low rank spell, then they're probably at like 75% hp. There is literally no point in healing them because their passive Regen and/or food will top them before the next pull. If you never let people passively Regen, you are wasting Mana which means more drinking.
---
If you just let him get 2-3 hits in he should hold aggro just fine.
---
Me and a friend camped a gnome warrior named finally on thalnos we saw him in swamp of sparrows and he immediately ran away cause he recognized our names
---
man i thought ja rule took all of those festival suits
---
Yeah I'm getting the same thing
---
sir retail is that way
---
This is the correct thing to do here.
---
Because they arent geared
---
I feel this in my bones, 400 mana per cast is no joke.
---
Well now that its happening to everyone maybe I shouldn't have jumped right to reinstall lol.
---
Hope you got that chest
---
What level are you?
---
No I just installed it and set it up. It took like 45 seconds
---
Spiritual guidance gives a significant +healing bonus, especially if you can nab a lifetap. In addition, there's quite a few bits of gear you can cobble together for +healing at late 30+: greens can give upwards of +18 healing (had a belt with that), SM hammer gives +15, SM orb gives +9, I think RFD drops some stuff... Down ranked healing can be completely warranted before raid content if you're interested in maximizing efficiency.
---
Or just bum water from a mage and not worry about it.
---
My Alchemist made a potion for my Rogue. I think I only had to kill one murloc. In and out in ten minutes.
---
Are you using the right version? The one I got from Twitch works perfect on install.
---
Yeah, I'm going to take a nap. Have fun at the gym!
---
stack overflow exceptions are bad news. Likely this has nothing to do with your computer and more to do with internal code issues
---
Holy fuck what a great post.
---
There dosnt even has to be collusion though. Your faction alone can fuck up your stock prices if they have a bigger presence than the other.
---
woke mans
---
GW2 has so many great mechanics and ideas, and I totally agree and want a successor to it as well. I want to get back into it again, but I've played it too much already I feel.
---
The game works fine for some people, not everyone is affected, i have several friends playing and about the same amount bugged.
---
I can understand being upset for being silenced, but your attitude sucks.
---
You really need to leave that guild, the guy is not mentally stable at all. Find a guild that doesnt threaten you unless you toady up to the troll GM
---
I'm getting the same thing, but getting a stack overflow error.  Disabled all addons and still getting it.
---
How do you taunt if you are not in prot stance?
---
Some are, though.
---
There is not

I see sooo many debates about the right level for Deadmines. "You can run it at level 16!" Sure, maybe a guild that's twinked out and has been practicing for two years on private servers and has great coordination can do it at level 16, but your random PUG can't. 
---
My friend is bad for it, and he's a hunter. Him and his pet are ALWAYS pulling aggro and it's so frustrating because he always argues when you say his level is too low.
---
Assuming it was quad-boxing that
---
Because they were added along side DM
---
Ain't no laws when you're drinkin' claws.
---
Yup, same here. Just happens at random, usually while I'm running around and also panning the camera. Suddenly it'll turn the screen like a full 180 degrees in an instant and then be fine again. We should list what programs we have running while playing to see if we have anything in common. I'll update my comment when I get home tonight to include mine
---
Same. Just uninstalled the game, redownloading it now with no addons. Hopefully it works!
---
Not cat related, but I stumbled upon Mazzranache at level 10 as a Tauren Hunter. Tamed him immediately and has been my boy ever since. 
---
However, I also tamed The Rake and I can't decide who to let go in order to learn better moves. 
---
It's a tough decision, abandoning your comrades.
---
Appreciate it.
---
Your character stays on whatever server you make it on. You can hop all you want, but you'll have to start a new character from level 1. 
---
PvP servers allow fighting in neutral zones. Sometimes you can get caught by a dick high level player that just kills you over and over, but that's rare. Mostly itll be people your level fighting with you for quest objectives. If you don't like this idea, go with a PvE or RP server.
---
Great thanks for the recommendation!
---
Thanks mate
---
Yep this is happening to me as well, I‚Äôve tried reinstalling the game and updating all my drivers.
---
Is there a primer on weakauras? I downloaded it for warrior and it put a million things overlapping on my screen. All I want is a battleshout reminder and overpower alert.
---
Yeah that's what I came to as well. Feels much better t rely on Sunder Armor boosting my swings. 
---
I regret every silver spent on Heroic Strike upgrades now. &gt;_&gt;
---
I went there, was reminded of how bad some of the drop rates are for the quests as a group of 50s came and shit on me. Just went elsewhere lol. I‚Äôm down for some pvp if it‚Äôs small skirmishes, but getting rolled with no chance of living while having to grind asstons of trolls... hard pass.
---
Haven‚Äôt seen this one in a while
---
I have an idea, Did you do the nameplate distance ‚Äùhack"?
---
I'll keep my eye out for him too
---
35 horde myself, so far the alliance have been cool and sometime even help kill mobs. Though we have our fair share of boat griefers I think the server is great. Lots of talk of alliance un balance but I think its a close 50/50 split. Though SM is a murder fest, but I suspect its the same on all servers
---
Personally I prefer the Night Elf i found that was selling erotic haikus for 1s 20c in Stormwind. Felt like it was more value for your coin
---
Yeah I remember people towering over me like buildings in classic. This needs to change then.
---
&gt; Worth it?
---
If you want to know where you stand versus other DPS for the purposes of getting better, than a DPS meter is worth it.  If you aren't reading up on effective rotations and DPS techniques for your class, I would say that it isn't important you have a DPS meter.
---
If you decide to raid, you will also need a Threat meter.
---
There are many different raid frame addons, go to the various WoW addon sites to find the one you like best.
---
It gets a pass because the reaction to Diablo Immortal was ridiculous. I really can't see any logic in being outrages over a mobile game just existing.
---
I only buff the tank and myself unless I have a vending machine in group to give me water.
---
I'm confused why anyone would want to report a bug that makes tanking easier ...
---
Same goes for druids, just put buffs on the pet.
---
Over 10 years later and the Alliance is still Salty Blood Elves decided to Join the Horde instead of put up with your bs lol
---
Still better than awkward forced conversations and crushing loneliness.
---
Wow financial problems &gt; real life financial problems
---
Dude your GM Messages show you deserve to be muted. I can only imagine what your other messages were
---
I would have gone with the increased wand dmg in disciplin. Otherqise it looks good. Am 46 on my priest and full shadow atm üòÅ
---
2 from dungeons and won both rolls? or just mobs outside the instance?
---
Absolutely love this post and story. Horde from Benediction but I appreciate stories like this that really capture the WoW classic experience!
---
The reason I said this is because add-ons work by utilizing data from the game/logs and built an interface or information based on that information.
---
Just a note, if you overwrite a buff, it removes the buff and then reapplies it. With Fort, their health drops to what it normally is pre-Fort, and then reapplies the additional health, which is why you see them lose health. They may in fact be using the wrong rank, but it can also be this interaction.  
---
With that being said, don't let it stop you from refreshing the buff for a fellow priest!
---
We see him, currently wearing the corpse of his victim to your left.
---
Yeah I get a stack overflow exception as soon as I enter the world (with and without addons disabled).. there was a patch, I have a feeling they may have screwed something up.. some instruction set for some processors maybe? (I'm on a ryzen 3700x). RIP :(
---
Haha I‚Äôve been in that awkward situation when I went to leave a guild and I wrote gquit instead of /gquit.  There was this awkward pause I logged off in absolute embarrassment, logged back in and kinda laughed it off.  Said I was explaining it to someone else :s
---
Great thank you for the recommendation
---
Ugh this is happening to me and of COURSE on my last day off where both the wife and kids are at work/school and I had the whole morning/afternoon to play lol.  EVERYTIME.
---
its makes for some good pvp, then whatever group that has control of the hill fights each other for 5 rock elementals that spawn
---
Tried, same error
---
You can report your chat ban and if you were a good boy they'll unban
---
Are you training your pet?
---
Because I want to give the alliance a gift
---
\#Nochanges just let us have this
---
Depends what you want to do. There is hybrid specs that heals fine. You have a couple of options
---
Its is bis until nax lol
---
I may be interested, have a mid 30s warrior I am leveling on Smolderweb now. I know you said you were interested in warriors, what is your warrior situation looking like? Also have 2 RL friends (Priest/Shammy) that would probably join.
---
Yeah I've had a lot of arms/fury warriors and feral druid tanks, no warriors seem to be going prot
---
yarp. Rockbiter on a dagger and earthshock and you can glue pretty much everything to you. Mark a target with a skull and you won't have to worry about dps hitting the wrong dude either, for the most part.
---
IIRC there was gear you could purchase based on the rep level you were with each battleground faction, but that takes a long time and you often had better gear already. The is going to be 14 ranks from PvP once implemented (both through battlegrounds and open world PvP), and at higher levels you can purchase gear. Keep in mind that getting to the level in which you can purchase the good gear will take a lot of time.   
---
Battlegrounds will be server-specific, and will require you to go to areas where they take place in order to queue.   
---
And no need to delete the answer, if someone else has a similar question and searches first, they will not need to post it again!
---
I'm pretty much generalizing with the amount of 40s to 60s you could see last week. Most people in my guild are also going on 7 to 12 hours gametime alone a day. The amount of upvotes for people bragging about hitting 60 already seems to go against everything people say about classic. I never played classic. I started mid BC.. but it doesn't seem anyone is actually leveling and enjoying the experience. Everyone is mass spamming dungeons with AoE classes. And I'm having a hard time enjoying the game tbh. The classes are so dull and gutted. I don't see how spamming frost bolt or getting invited to groups because you have one totem they like enjoyable. I'm just bitching now but classic seems overhyped and I think everyone is riding the nostalgia train.
---
No, they have to specifically choose to use the void walker to have a pet that taunts. They also aren‚Äôt limited by ammo or a dead zone. They‚Äôre also not expected to kite anything and have no cc besides fear, which is obvious not to use in dungeons. Much less room for error. Stop trying to make it look like hunter players are inherently stupider than any other player. It‚Äôs literally how the class is designed leads to more obvious errors.
---
Once you enter a dungeon (with or without a party) and you kill X number of things, to get them to resplendent you will need to (1) exit the dungeon, (2) right click your character profile, (3) select reset all instances or reset dungeons (I forget what it reads exactly, (4) re-enter the dungeon and you should find that everything is reset.
---
Cheers
---
They were added later in the game as mentioned above?
---
Updated all my drivers and restarted my computer and it is finally working now.
---
/console rawMouseEnable 1
---
This fixed my problem
---
I don‚Äôt even have shadow bolt on my bar.  Pet, dots, wand, repeat.
---
I see üëçüèº hope u get it fixed
---
I play here too, short ques at peak times. 36 and have experienced decent amount of balanced pvp.
---
yes and no, talking about let's say "fog of war" and yes mobs disappearing in quite short distance from me
---
how do people know these sort of things?
---
IIRC, doesn‚Äôt work on people holding right-click - can someone confirm?
---
That's beautiful.
---
No, I beg to differ, a 20 min queue at 11pm (or 2am server) on a Monday night is pretty awful. I'll stay on Benediction. High Pop, no queue. I tried to make some alts/names on other servers but Whitemane is so full I can't even get on! haha
---
It is the trade off between convenience and the feeling of accomplishment. I only ever played Vanilla, as the announcement of BC dropped the realization that I had literally wasted 4 months of my life on farming High level raids.
---
But I followed the changes and understood that you take away the satisfaction of an achievement by making it easy to get.
---
Catch up mechanics fall into this category.
---
In vanilla, it was an achievement to get you twinks geared. 
---
Running a dungeon for the 10th time is no different from daily / weekly quests. And there were some dungeons I genuinely enjoyed running every night....like Dire Maul.
---
After all...if you don't enjoy a game anymore because it got repetitive...take a break of move on. Giving stuff for free was obviously not the best solution as it does not yield the same satisfaction.
---
I don't remember what the item is, but there's some rando blue trinket that gives a chance on melee swings for an extra attack. Then a combat rogue can go sword specialization for another chance for an extra attack. But the thing is, they can proc off each other.
---
tried that too. no dice
---
I believe the shirt and pants do not require a level.
---
The queues don't typically start until 3pm.
---
&gt; as often as possible when shield bash and revenge is on cd
---
It doesn't matter if shield bash and revenge are on cd or not. Heroic strike doesn't use a gcd as it's an auto attack skill. You should literally be constantly spamming it.
---
I let Boomkins cast thorns themselves, they're druids...
---
Up your game to a brown one son.
---
That way,.. it's already brown and you don't have to make it brown.  This is the route I'd go..
---
Brown town.
---
Damn thats interesting and explains why I love Booty Bat so much.
---
I've played a healer from Vanilla to current retail and that is the biggest issue I've had to keep reminding myself. There doesn't seem to be a ton of mechanics that instagib people so there's not as much of a need to worry if a dps is between 40%-100% health. Although I love topping someone off with one max rank holy light from 30% hp.
---
you aren't alone! I also get in to the world then crash moments after. I've tried disabling my addons and fresh install and no luck either
---
Seems fixed for me!
---
And I support your right to do so. Play as you like. 
---
And I'm not saying you are a monster or anything. Though I would keep an eye on you if you were in my guild.
---
cool, man! excellent macro. thanks for the hard work :)
---
Thorough testing.
---
If you do the quest during the day you may not even notice they are werewolves.
---
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúsketchy,‚Äù people use macros for all kinds of stuff like this all the time and it‚Äôs perfectly acceptable.
---
A dwarf in Ironforge helped me craft those fast when I was looking for just a few more wool cloth to get the level requirements. He's earned some appreciation for my banging new hat....helmet....head piece thing.

Long time no see, fellas!

---
Overplayed, childish comment.
---
You get faction rep turning in quests.
---
I understand its subversive and douchey.  I didnt want it to be like that.  I wanted a small cut (tip) instead.  Its not uncommon in this game, but i dont wanna get kicked for it.  So here we are
---
This stereotype just keeps on becoming true tbh
---
No kidding, this has been driving me nuts.  The game looks great, I can't tell if the herbs do though as I cannot see them.
---
I commented below but this fixed my issue immediately: 
---
Yeah I just simply explained why that's hurtful to people, but people (like the guy who replied to me) seem to think that asking not to use slurs is some sort of attack on their identity. 
---
Everyone deserves to play the game without being harassed
---
Won‚Äôt be released till P2
---
There is nothing wrong with locks doing so, but they can regen in battle easier than out of combat so there is really no point unless they are low on both mana AND hp or going into a boss fight or more difficult fight.
---
those are good people They make me free gold.
---
Absolutely, ill grab a snack, make some tea, etc...
---
For your build/ human passives I think that would be the better and more fun choice
---
I have wand spec now but will I really be using that in pvp or when I'm healing in molten core?
---
Yeah I don't know what expansion the "big kahuna" bs started, but i know it went back at least as far as the-expansion-that-shall-not-be-named. Running into Lion's Watch and the NPCs are announcing you as the commander. Like hell...you say that to every player that comes in here...I'm not special?
---
Really looking forward to playing when I get off work..... Please Blizzard, please!
---
Wow an elitist noob. Rare combo. Should have screenshotted lol.
---
CoOL bRo
---
Pretty sure Fairbanks is a strong west coast horde PvP server
---
Shoulda seen Faerlina than, in Sun Rock Retreat we had a massive Alliance attack which went on for a solid 4 hours, they kept killing whoever landed from the bat and all the npcs. When i was flying about to land i legit saw 7 red names and a couple green names, as soon as i landed i started running, and some skull alliance guy saw and chased me down.
---
Dude that is the most evil thing I've ever seen.

**&lt;Dump Truck&gt; | Horde | NA | Kirtonos|** 
---
**About us:**  &lt;Dump Truck&gt; is a guild comprised of RL friends and some folks that we've grouped with on the server.  There are 20 of us now, but we're looking to grow!  We have a number of members spread across 20s, 30s, and 40s (I'm currently the highest member at 44).  We do dungeons every night, and are definitely planning on running 10 mans, and eventually MC at 60.  I can't say whether or not we'll end up doing this as a guild, an alliance, or if we will all migrate to a bigger guild as a group - right now we're just having fun leveling!
---
Everyone is a (mostly) functioning adult.   We don't spam guild invites/advertise in channels -the only members are folks we've grouped with or friends/friends of friends.  Many of us played Vanilla as raiders, but we have quite a few folks who are brand new as well.
---
If you're looking for folks to level with, or just miss seeing the lime green text, message me here on Reddit or Ainwein in-game.
---
Hi, /u/Livetoserve91

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d2af4q/will_he_live/).

11 points into Holy for Consecrate, 13 points into Prot for Redoubt/Precision/Guardian's Favor/Improved Righteous Fury. This'll get you all the way to 60. You can go deeper into Prot for better tanking but it's not *absolutely* necessary. Here's how I manage pulls:
---
-Mark targets. At least skull, I usually do X too
---
-Pull. Cast SoRighteousness, Judge on skull, cast SoWisdom (or Righteousness/Light if below level 38)  
---
-Consecration  
---
-Autoattack Skull a few times, then start autoattacking X
---
-Drop a second Consecration if there are 3+ mobs, just to be sure. Not always necessary.  
---
That's about it. Once you get SoWisdom mana becomes a nonissue and really helps with fast clear times.  
---
Use BoWisdom on self, swap to BoSanct when/if you get it. I start the run with Might/Wis/Kings on the group but if aggro is a problem, everyone gets Salv (except the healer, always Wis for them)  
---

It's part of my fishing attire

I think you're in the wrong sub
---
Ahh yeah just the chat, having a separate tab for party chat doesn‚Äôt seem legit
---
I look on those days real fondly. Here I am 14 years after all that happened and stumbled on this post randomly. Playing classic of course. 
---
I still vividly remember meeting up with the Canadians in Ironforge working on the merge over vent. I can't remember the warrior's name who was the guild leader, but there are a lot of names I still can recall... Hellmage, Fomaliat, Daphnie, you Zaziel. We overcame a lot of barriers back then, language being just one of them. 
---
Hope classic is treating you all well, it was a pleasure to work with all of you all those years ago. Keep your feet on the ground!
---
The only problem here is you FILMING your screen
---
I love that everything has people in it at all times.
---
Bigglesworth !!! Best west coast pvp server by far. Max q is only like 5 mins.
---
Thalnos, no discuss
---
pseudo randomness is practically indistinguishable from real randomness. Most rand procedures use the current time (in POSIX timestamp form, which is unique) as a seed, guaranteeing effective randomness.
---
Basically, this guy is just lucky. Im sure for exploit-prevention reasons the loot drop code is air-tight.
---
Brutal.
---
Yup, had a quest in stone talon and couldn't see the seeds, turned it off after that. I'll check out 6 per another persons suggestion.
---
&gt; I mean the hamstring swing timer method is still very much a thing.
---
Only in isolated cases.  Melee leeway makes it much more difficult or downright impossible.
---
This brings back so many memories (of BC though) of Patch Tuesday, the servers being down till 11pm or midnight and Blizz shutting down the forums just because of all the QQ. Glorious!
---
Alright "Cpa"
---
Fucking stupid
---
This is the shit I look forward to reading about
---
if you choose a pve server      the only way pvp can happen is if your right click on your portrait and flag your self for pvp.     however next to no one does this
---
I almost see more alliance than horde in certain contested zones it feels like. I think we have a great split.
---
You don't need to launch via the blizzard client.. Just open wow.exe
---
Us Burglars in Lord of the Rings Online would stockpile the fireworks from various seasonal festivals, so we could light them off on the corpses of creeps we destroyed with our tank squads in the Ettenmoors (PvP zone). Good times!
---
yep, and not only that but it means he ran around with his bags full for eons, only picking up quest items and losing a crazy amount of money.
---
I don‚Äôt know for sure, though there were some people I tried this on that seemed to correct themselves inhumanly fast. Perhaps they were holding right click?
---
Blaumeux sounds like "Blowme" or "Blammo" depending on who you ask.  Most of the other criteria is going to be opinion or conjecture.
---
its 2 pieces of gear per rank that you can buy. so buy rank 3..maybe 6? youll have a full set of blue pvp gear. i said maybe 6 because it might be by rank 3 you can buy the gear, i cant really remember.
---
Holy shit what is this from? It‚Äôs been so long
---
I always thought it was the camera clipping the surface causing it to spin wildly.  It's really disorientating.
---
The psudo-random number generator requires a key to work and in most games this key is regenerated all the time to keep everything feeling truly "random" and not "computer random."
---
All pvp servers are horde favored. Take your pick of any of the West coast servers with a short log in queue.
---
BUFF ME YOU BUFF SLAVE

To some I might be gimping myself but that faster AS w/the WWS and the +5 racial just finally sold me to go with the sword over the Axe.

I did /lick on someone who was afk and he sent me 12 PM's about 10 minutes later how I'm a fleabag druid shithead  who deserves to blah blah blah and how he wanted to do blah blah blah to my family

Called my armored RFK boar ArmoredBacon

Good idea, I was just gonna make these for myself, but now I have to check what the AH status is :D
---
He‚Äôs just a fucking salty asshole that has been spoon fed some bullshit propaganda against streamers and regurgitates it. Zero self thought and critical thinking.
---
Renew is actually not that bad since it allows to activate the 5s rule and still regenerate some health although I'm using renew mostly when healing in dungeons but for that very reason.
---
Thalnos is East Coast
---
I'm not sure about horde, but as alliance, you're definitely going that way sooner or later.  Even if you aren't questing there, it's on they way to SFK and SM.
---
Teldrassil was never exciting.  I played several Night Elves and couldnt wait to get outta that place.
---
Same. Enjoy seeing the starter areas bustling again
---
Drops for mobs are determined on spawn, not on death.  We learned this during TBC with the Rogues going for Warglaives camping out in Black Temple on reset.  While I have no inside knowledge on how the loot is decided, I would guess it brings up a number based on the time and date of spawn (like old school authenticators) and compares that number to a loot table.  So your own character's information has no impact on drops.
---
This is just a statistical improbability.
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone has missed this part at all mate, it‚Äôs great. As more and more people hit 60 the main cities will be even more bustling! 
---
My personal favourite rejuvenated city is IF. I love it!
---
It‚Äôll give you a few extra casts per fight though. That translates into speed while leveling. It‚Äôs a no brained if you have the recipes and are sitting anyway. 
---
You can drink and eat at the same time iirc. Been a looooong time since I‚Äôve eaten any food for the actual health (priest)
---
What happens if you kill someone in a pve server? Loot? What about a pvp server?
---
That's a good point, but during the general leveling to 40, I don't think Impale is taken very often because it really doesn't become useful at all (since you don't have many ability procs) until you get WW and MS. So I think some people will take it in the late-30s after you get WW, but that is when this post starts to become less useful anyways, thanks to WW and MS.
---
What were u killing?
---
yep that was my exact thought seeing this.. he probably lost at least 15g doing this.
---
5 second before he gets ambushed by a purple Mohawk undead rogue called ‚ÄúKiller‚Äù.
---
Grats though!
---
The fish are QUIVERING
---
I'm almost 30 and watch twitch daily. Its not just a zoomie thing
---
And to think I had people saying 'i fucked up' for choosing BS over alch for a warrior.
---
Uggs, black leggings, and a north face
---
If you play on a PvE server you do not have ‚Äúnon consensual pvp‚Äù aka you cannot be ganked. You have to manually type /pvp to enable pvp flagging to attack other pvp flagged players.
---
On a pvp server you are always flagged for pvp and have no way to turn it off.
---
I miss seeing that sort of thing happen, but I am also very happy to be on a PVE server. If I played on a PVP server, I'd still be level 15 probably instead of making 40 by the end of the weekend.
---
Exactly! Add stoneskin totem to the mix and you've got some passive mitigation to boot, or Earthbind Totem to slow mobs in an area. Shamans might not necessarily be *optimized* for tanking, but they can certainly do it. ;)
---
&gt; Mages Pay reagents that cost money to teleport or portal. 
---
Yea dont leech on mages like that
---
&gt; If you ask a mage to teleport to your city to craft you something fast please tip more than the cost of the reagent 
---
Wait what. why? You don't even give an explanation.
---
Glad to share it. It took me a while to find the pieces I needed to pull this off. I haven't written many script/run macros. Glad I got it figured out those. Works great! 
---
Now if only I could pick skull/x/moon/etc for action button icons.
---
I'm 38 right now, and constantly run without a proper sword-and-board. Groups rarely CC, most AoE. Everyone knows where to go, what to focus, how to pay their class, and what gear they need.
---
I'm not sure how else to show you that the playerbase is far more competent. What evidence would actually convince you?
---
Shhh, I got the rake at lvl 11 because it's so under the radar.
---
Your comment is clearly a snarky one, but this is exactly what us locks want. We are self sufficient. Undead can cannibalize and they can all drain life and siphon life (I'm assume aflic locks here). Plus they have a per 5 second hp regen and bandages. Healers should love having a lock on the team because that means they need to focus on one less person. Throw a lock the occasional HoT and they are g2g unless they pull aggro. They shouldn't be at full hp.
---
Leveling through STV is a right of passage.  Everyone is there to haze you.
---
Vietnam, but ok.
---
Gimme your account info I'll set up parental controls
---
I can only speculate as I haven't done either of these in Vanilla, but it's hard to imagine that you won't have ANY downtime where you don't have to heal. You could argue that using offensives spells might be more effective in this case but you'll want to conserve mana and not increase your threat, which a Wand is great for
---
Healbot is a must have for me over the years
---
Shh.   Give a man a fish feed him for a day, teach a man to fish, you loose a perfectly good business opportunity.
---
Set a timer. Set a goal and kick yourself off once you reach it. Tell a friend to remind you to get off.
---
I mean, there's nothing holding you back except your own self control. If it's seriously detrimental to your lifestyle, then I'd look into it.
---
come on guys
---
its classic, be nice. 
---
BOTH of you were assholes to be honest.... just drop it and say sorry, you wont out argue the other side.
---
I always reply, ‚Äúbeen working on it‚Äù
---
Disgusting.
---
Blizzard fixed it on their end.
---
UC isn‚Äôt that populated ever unfortunately.
---
Mind blown.
---
Yep, at one point I was in bed at 8pm daily, now its like 12 or 1 daily, I even bought espresso to help wake my ass up in the morning
---
I‚Äôd lose my fuckin mind if someone did that when I was fully buffed as a ret pala. To compete we need melee AND caster consumables so it would be tons of gold down the drain. I‚Äôd make them pay me or g quit and find a guild that doesn‚Äôt do this kind of asinine behavior
---
I'm only level 29, but I keep a Lesser Heal Rank 3 (Heals for about 150) on my bar for topping people off, but I only cast it immediately after another cast.
---
I'll delay the 5-second rule to top someone off, but I won't take myself out of it to.
---
Good code will always be independent in this regards - it doesn't matter who kills the unit, how it does, where it dies, when it dies, or how quickly it dies, all that matters is -when- it dies, it has a chance to drop loot.   Enter:20 year old code base!!
---
Now, here's where the real code fuckery could happen - let's say there is a bug that triggers this 'drop logic' more often based on a player performing some action, but doesn't actually yield any drops (i.e. the game rolls when you /sit for example, but since no unit died, there is no loot, but it still tried to run the loot roll program).   
---
Let's also say there's any form of luck/protection involved (I e. Your odds increase as you kill more units). Cool. So, this player might be getting extra 'phantom' rolls, through some weird bug, increasing some form of loot luck, and yielding more epics when that luck is realized.  
---
Alternatively, You could also look at the specific units. Let's say a Dev tested a increased drop chance on a murloc tidecaller and shoved some code in a 25 folder deep library that only listens in when a particular unit dies, resulting in increased hurricane drops.  But, let's say the dev also made it specific to a class/race killing the enemy for debug or comparison purposes (nelf Hunter vs human mage for example). Well, there you have it, obscure code that got pushed to prod resulting in increased epic drops hidden in a folder.
---
Tldr, it's possible, but really hard to prove without source code access.
---
Lol even website thing ,said something went wrong loo
---
Interesting. That is sort of what we have been doing. I just grab 2-4 mobs and cleave them as he auto attacks.
---
how about this?

Check out that bow speed - that thing will eat arrows like a fat kid eats cakes at a birthday!
---
Those BRD quests are bothering me though
---
Ooocio
---
I spent an hour getting ganked while questing in Hillsbrad and then finally find a safe spot, start farming some silk for more bandages, and this gnome mage comes along and just watches me. I get low struggling against a double pull and I'm like ok, this is it, they're waiting to execute me to troll. But they frost bolt the 2 enemies for me and then sheep me for the heal. Very refreshing.
---
so you bind all your spells ? You should be able to silence even fast heals
---
&gt;I had a day off work yesterday and just played all day.
---
Priorities and time management seem in order, why would you need any tips?
---
Man, I wish I could find a cloak that was white and looks longer than your average cloak or cape.
---
How about a general category? Like the macro to sell grey stuff from inventory isn't linked to a char. Or a melee attack macro can be used to multiple classes.
---
Back in vanilla, i kited a 40 elite in desolace as a 34 warlock.  It took forever, but I was super amazed with myself.
---
&gt; Shattering, Sundering was the maelstrom thing ;) (i had to look it up for my post lol)
---
Thx. Fixed it.
---
&gt;  I was questing with an alt in Redridge, I got the quests that took you to that elite keep atop the mountain across from the farm you grind lockpicking at. I was staring at the mobs and they were all elite, then they faded out and reloaded as non-elite. 
---
That sounds *exactly* like zone-phasing (Mobs and other entities phase out and and others appear), where characters that are on or have completed certain quests see an area differently than others. The point of that mechanic was to address the 'complaint' that no matter what players did, the world never changed.
---
Its a decent idea (and protecting low level players from griefing is a good use for it), but Blizz just used it as a gimmick. The quests just became perfunctory grinds to hand out xp for leveling, and the narrative and gameplay just seemd to become a wrapper for the grind to get to endgame content. it's when I just totally lost interest in WoW. If blizzard can't be bothered to create engaging quests, it's unfair to expect players to feel engaged with the game.
---
Samuel, this is your father. Quit making these posts and get back to your homework. You're grounded.
---
Except that poor warrior who though he'd go ahead and take my Bhag'thera spawn....he never saw that shadow bolt crit coming
---
It's actually Blough (pounced like Cow or Ow! but with a B sound) + Moo
---
Blowme just has a more refined ring to it.
---
There‚Äôs even people inside 
---
Just like when the bnet launcher was down lol
---
Download Diablo 2! Such a fun game when downtime hits
---
OP's micro phallus is banging your slutty mom and the cheap whore loves it!
---
I have to drink aprox. Twice per dungeon the rest I manage by pure spirit.
---
Bagnon wasnt updated for classic like 2 days ago when i checked. Was there a way to get around that? Or did they update it?
---
5 points in and I still miss on green mobs lmao
---
I think a level 1 tuxedo recipe was available from the Nobelgarden event, but that holiday doesn't exist in Classic iirc
---
That's funny because what you're supporting is a change from vanilla.
---
Your reasoning for why its necessary is garbage, it wasnt an issue then and isnt one now.
---
Yeah but tbf I spend half my time looking like a cat so you can't really tell
---
When I get buffed by a sub 40 player I will sometimes party up, put them on follow and put on aspect of the pack if they are running somewhere to give them a boost. Hunters can buff!
---
Items are cool, I still think that it is pretty boring to lvl it up
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/34719 This worked for me
---
And worse case we can just Drain Life on the next pull. 
---
If I know the next pull is 1-2 target with no threat to me then I'll just wait instead of wasting water/bandages/cannibalize.
---
I just got mine on Sunday, it's crazy how naked you feel without them
---
Questie is helpful, but Azeroth autopilot is a bit too much for the "classic feel" IMHO.
---
Once you can start fishing in lvl40+ zones, you can catch the things that go into higher end food / flask buffs.  Nightfin, Stonescale Eel, are nice.  I believe Oily Blackmouth and Firefin Snapper are useful for alchemy pots as well.
---
I feel like by the time I'm 60, nobody will want to do the earlier raids anymore and I've never done them before so I want to experience it
---
This is perfect, cheers
---
Yeah....I know
---
I was called a traitor for turning into a bear and taunting a mob off of a dying horde player.  I shall point them to this thread and have them rethink what "traitor" really means!
---
Aw, I'm so sorry for your friend. It's nice that he has you though, even if you guys can't do much together. I made the jump back in on my own and it's been hit or miss finding a guild and people to talk to for longer than one questing party. At least you're there in some sense, which I'm sure helps. Love to all of you guys. &lt;3
---
Preach it brother! 
---
Sincerely, a fellow priest healer.
---
I find I have far more success in "can I buy some lvl X water please" than " can I get some water please".
---
For a full trade screen I'll give them 2g and a fish.
---
I haven't had any issues with the WeaponSwingTimer, i did change it to the 2nd option because the red/white in/out bar was confusing to me, so the other bar is much easier to read and understand.   Really helped me to not miss auto-shots when using multi-shot.
---
WHAT HAPPENED HERE WAS A MIRACLE AND I WANT YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT!
---
Appreciate your input. Btw i only ever posted one screenshot and it was really a screenshot not mobile photo. So its not about me posting those rather than me thinking those are completely fine to post.
---
I use an addon called WIM which creates a little chat window for my IM's.  I'm pretty sure you continue typing in whatever chat you were before, unless you hit the reply key.
---
What's so special about it?
---
That's not what I meant but yes, wide quest log gets the elvui skin (i have addonskins too).
---
Well they're not going to change it since it was part of the patch originally right?  What's the point of this post?
---
Too soon.
---
12 silver
---
PCs are useless right now since nobody has much gold to spend.  I would save it until later.
---
Some people just want to see the world burn..
---
nope not possible
---
Bout 200g is fair.
---
when i played in MoP, my bank alt was also my alt raider. 
---
i played a lot during mist
---
I think a lot of that stuff was added in TBC
---
As a horde rouge on Stalagg I guess I'll hafta distract him.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
I guess if it‚Äôs cheap. I‚Äôm extremely frugal because I want to get my epic mount right at 60 just like my reg mount right at 40. I just don‚Äôt see the point with countless upgrades. Not to mention for every upgrade now I‚Äôm selling the last weapon for 1-3gs.
---
And this is why a feral spec Druid can still heal most leveling dungeons as long as they have some decent int/spirit gear.  Healed Stocks yesterday with no issue and I didn‚Äôt even have an int weapon.  Tank pulled 2-4 at a time and we didn‚Äôt wipe once.
---
How am i entitled?  Theres nothing to stop me from getting it by myself
---
I was lvling in goldshire earlier this week and the number of warriora i have to save from getting dropped by aggro mobs was mindboggling
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/34719  Worked for me
---
Of course I'd be in Defensive Stance, I'm just asking about tanking without Prot talents. :)
---
I just got my first blue the other day at wailing caverns‚Äîslime encrusted pads. I was pretty pumped.
---
Looked like you forgot how to move at the end there lol
---
I use auctioneer currently. It works at scanning the AH and telling me if they are below/above average. But thats about it is auctionator better?
---
Burning Crusade is Classic WoW, but with more abilities and viable specs
---
Does this work for bear druids? Im having a hell of a time on aoe pulls
---
Oh jeeze without getting to in depth and linking the various quests and flavour items:
---
The alliance is very much fractured post third-war. Many of the guards, military, and adventurers are either dead or stationed far away from Stormwind. 
---
Sooo the kobolds which were previously just a nuisance have become stronger over time and now have the numbers to take over entire mines etc and Stormwind doesn't have the military might nearby to stop it.
---
Kobolds, doing what kobolds do are taking candles, and no prisoners.
---
Imagine not thinking Dwarves are badass
---
I tried that a couple times only to come home and realize I've been disconnected because somehow I got in early and was afk too long while driving home
---
I love being a PVE bitch, i can troll you guys easy and bully lowbies kek
---
why you have to be mad? is it because you can't corpse camp me lol? just be honest, yous lot wish you could ruin my fun but yous can't haha
---
I want this in the game so that I can be an asshole.
---
How was the ally horde ratio?
---
It feels clumsy healing on my 33 priest. My Mana pool is so limited... is the proper rotation really to try to cast "heal" irregularly enough to regen mana between casts? That's what I've been doing and it works, cleared SM Arm at 32 and gnomer at 30 only wiping on big overpulls. 
---
As soon as my group starts sharing aggro with the tank my mana's time is numbered. Does this ever change? Is it only like this because I'm shadow/wand spec? Just feels a little awkward at times.
---
I kill everyone I can. More mobs for me,  more corpse runs for you. I‚Äôve eaten my share of the same.
---
I mean 15 years later some of the quests are still an absolute hot mess
---
Most of the quests are already mindless with poor drop rates
---
I'd see if I could get 30-40g for it depending on the server. The game and servers are still quite fresh and not fully developed yet.
---
I stopped using Demoralizing Shout because taking less damage also reduces how much rage you gain from damage taken.
---
There will ALWAYS be guilds doing lower level content.  The "big boys" wont, but then again, chances are you're probably not experienced enough for big boys to want you now in the first place.
---
That said, findign a spot in a guild as a tank is harder than it seems. Most raiding guilds have tanks already set, and just rotate dps over time. You might get lucky with an offtank spot somewhere, but generally raid guilds want healers and dps more than tanks.
---
But... new guilds pop up all the time. So if you really want to tank, then pick warrior, button up and go at it. Just be prepared for a painful time :p That's the life of a warrior. It hardens you. Prepares you.
---
Most polls seem to indicate 55-45 favoring horde
---
I know. I'm playing on Linux and didn't have anything installed to record the screen
---
Heartseeker is a newer server but still growing daily. Not as dead as people claim either.
---
This is my fear too. They don‚Äôt have the grapes to pull this off which is unfortunate. My ideal scenario is that they do make wow classic+ and start added content that is in the same spirit of classic wow. But Blizzard is literally never not done the safest, easiest, most straightforward thing since wow came out. Risk taking is not something I would trust modern day Blizzard with
---
Lok'tar Ogar brother, we shall have our moment of glory!
---
I miss Shadow Word: Death I think it synergie really well with Spirit Tap.
---
Yep used that staff till i got corpsemaker. Even slightly small increases in DPS at that level has huge implications for damage output.
---
Because battlegrounds in 1.12 are basixally the same as LFD.
---
Weird, my ignore list is 4x as big as my retail list ever was
---
Alliance say it's 4-1 horde.   I don't know who to believe.  All I know is you guys are making it impossible for my dwarf priest to level.   I try to help all the horde I see just so we can earn trust.   But some of you play dirty.   If you ever see a dwarf priest named merxer, don't worry he won't attack
---
It's called a robe.
---
No, sunder is always superior. Heroic strike is garbage, dont use it.
---
You can mail to characters on your server on your faction. I think there is/was a way to exploit this between factions with the neutral auction house but I‚Äôm not sure, I‚Äôve only ever played Horde.
---
Oof. The paladin healing trinket is so good.
---
Man, I felt like such a boss when I had 3G at level 19. Then I hit the trainer at 20, realized I had missed about 6 levels worth of skills, and was back down to 70s. I only got the important ones, too.
---
Was a different server. I first assumed he was attacking me, my pet went after him by default(defense) but he emoted shook his head and wandered off, and I connected the dots that he was actually helping me.
---
Yeah, another one.  
---
Stop making loot posts.
---
It's not a dress, it's a kilt. I recommend disabling the cape and putting on a tabard to hide the clothiness. Colorwise Scarlet crusade one should work fine if the guild one is too garish.
---
It is how it was, but Blizzard could justify changing it based on how people used it.  I haven‚Äôt heard them say one way or another, but I would not be surprised if they said it was deliberate and not being reverted.
---
If the rogue is a bad player yes. A rogue controls the entire fight. A war with worse gear doesn't even survive the stunlock before crippling kite.
---
&gt; I would think you'd get auto'd before completing the second MF
---
Yeah you have to back up after the MB while casting SWP to make the MF‚Äôs work. Any proc of the shadow stun helps too.
---
Thanks for putting words in my mouth. "Choose to skip quests" was not mentioned by me as something WoW has. What classic WoW has that adds the RPG element in agency in how your character grows via the talent tree, which lets you be different and possibly unique from others if you choose to. Its professions let you change your play-style combined with your class. Potions, engineering kits, unique items with use mechanics. These and other elements give you agency in how your character grows and is different from the next guy in meaningful, non-cosmetic ways.
---
Depends entirely on your server pop and time of day/week. 
---
Remember the typical 5-man is 1 tank, 1 healer, and 3 DPS, meaning 60% of any group is DPS. That's still good odds. But if your play time is limited and you want an easier shot at groups, a multi-role class like Druid or Shaman should have an easy time.
---
In the end though, you gotta play what you want. You'll spend so much time exploring and questing solo. Don't let fear of this one thing control your decision.
---
Pretty casual player, will probably never be able to allot more than 1.5 hours to a single play period. And that is pushing it. I know that means raids are not going to happen. As for dungeons, is there a good resource that shows how long each is estimated to take? I can hit quicker ones maybe avoid the longer or out of the way ones.
---
How much did it cost you to get to 222? I'm lvl 30, have 3 gold and about 60 copper ore. :)
---
Smashing an unmanned base isn't hardcore in any sense of the word.  It's just an effective means of depriving an opponent of resources.
---
Those resources are important when it comes to PVP engagement, which for my group is the point of the game.  
---
And in sandbox MMOs my groups inevitably have their greatest resource losses when people can't make it to defend territory.  Doesn't matter if it's an Eve citadel/station, castle, or ark base.  When we do show up and the opponents do as well is when the fun happens.
---
There's an add-on called Leatrix Plus that's like an extended options menu, you can get it on the twitch app. One of the many things you can toggle is to automatically dismount or stand up when you try to perform an action that being mounted/sitting prevents.
---
Kurinnaxx is where the fun is
---
Not a warrior but the same thing happens with blade flurry sometimes. Not a huge deal because taking a step in any direction fixes it but still mildly annoying.
---
And that's why I consider it lazy writing and design. The game moves on even if you haven't done something yet it is implied you did it. In Legion you could see Argus in the sky no matter where (or when) you are and when you hit 110 they told you were there and actively contributed. By making everybody special, they made everybody the same type of special, which is to say - not at all.
---
It's not that hard to find a group as DPS. Remember that for every 1 healer or tank you need 3 DPS. So while there are more DPS than other roles, it's not massively beyond a 3:1 ratio.
---
You're a cool little one. I'll scratch your name of my death note (anime reference - I'm not a serial killer). Don't let them taint you with their elitism! For the love of Azeroth, venture forth and change the reputation of gnomes across the lands! You're out only hope Indaochan!
---
P.s unfortunately I'm in the EU :(
---
*All* bows are faster than that. There aren't any with over a 3.0 speed, so you're clipping auto shots no matter what.
---
Not at all. Cruelty is an excellent talent early on (doubles your base crit chance essentially) and Rmproved Rend is a requirement for Deep Wounds and Impale later on. 
---
You can easily keep this until level 30 or 40. At level 30, you can look to respect into full Arms because you can get Sweeping Strikes and easily attack 2 mobs at a time instead of 1 (huge game changer IMO). But you can also wait until level 40 when you get Mortal Strike, which is the single best ability and absolutely worth respeccing for. 
---
For now, save the 1 gold for respeccing later. Rush Anger Management --&gt; Improved Overpower --&gt; Deep Wounds and that's all you really need in the arms tree.
---
Ah OK. Ya badlands is your money. Or find a good market with your alch and started setting up cyclic income
---
That may be true for some end-game builds, but ignores the fun leveling experience having a talent tree is. That alone makes it worth it even if "serious raiders" have their cookie-cutter builds for level 60.
---
No, thats not what im saying. In BFA you can pull a hell of a lot more than is possible in classic and you dont need to be as organized in BFA as you need to be in classic. But this mentality of one pack at a time is ancient and boring and worst of all unnessecary.
---
Pull 2 pack and AoE or even 3 packs if they are melee. It all depends on your group how much you can pull, but if the speed levelers have proved us anything, its that AoEing dungeons in very few pulls is a viable tactic.
---
Now im not saying to play like them, om saying do as much damage as you can and let us healers pick up the slack. Rogues can evasion, mage can frost nova and ice block, hunters can FD and so on. Threat isnt something to be so deathly afraid of that you dont dare to pull more than a singel pack even if you have the means to dealing with it.
---
I get that you want your vanilla experience back and this way of doing dungeons ruins that somewhat. But that experience is already ruined by the sheer knowledge we possess about the game and the vastly higher skill level of the playerbase.
---
Downrank spells
---
yeah, that is super weird. Everyone know you use Q and E for spells and change A and D to strafe
---
The people upset about the lfg addon are morons.
---
We have queues from cities because we had that in part of vanilla and that's what blizzard went with. 
---
Retail has nothing to do with it
---
I've been wondering about this too. I looked for it but gave up pretty quickly. 
---
If I don't see an answer here, I'll probably just macro my opening cast to dismount rather than everything as it's nearly always the same thing.
---
You can farm them, no one says you aren't able to. You just wont get any XP from the kills and the lowbies questing there might not be happy. What you can also do is find a spot and if people are there ask if you can buy their mats from them for a very low price since they will probably vendor them anyway.
---
Yeah, you don‚Äôt really need to, but as a disc priest i almost never go oom and will throw some renews out when needed so they are more comfortable pumping out dps. If they are low they may hold back in case they get aggro. Especially for warlocks that want to spirit tap!
---
Quite sure, I was asking for a decent amount of gold that I would realize was gone if I had sent him money. Not sure about the timer but I've not received the items back yet
---
Definitely happened on Quin's stream.
---
You break MC with the Fort cast.
---
That's perfect I'm actually primarily an angular 8 dev with experience with express. Only one I haven't don't is MySQL, I've mainly used NoSQL like mongodb
---
No Diamond-Tipped Cane?
---
That is just the run back after a wipe in mauradon. Guys, I‚Äôm lost on the orange side cave!!!!
---
Yeah, I barely use it anymore, but while leveling is one of the few spells on the rotation. This aura is not mine and it shows all the CD abilities. Cheers
---
This was also bothering me since I was very confused for a while
---
Removed Interface, WTF, addons
---
Restarted computer
---
Reinstalled WoW
---
Bought a new computer
---
Bought a second new computer
---
Nothing still
---
Truths are spoken here. I was getting a bit fixated on keeping everyone topped off at first but I was ooming too fast and stressing out the groups. Now I just heal the tank and wand their target while I regen. Then I have the reserves to deal with unexpected adds or a bad pull.
---
Had some hairy pulls in RFK and Gnomer last night and really only pulled through because I didn't try to keep every one alive. 
---
Really loving this game again...
---
This is a typical patch day for vanilla, its part of the experience.
---
&gt;then go and get it by yourself
---
Or, you know, after everyone leaves.
---
Also if you wanna talk equity,  the rogue definitely has more.  Its my lockpicking skill that opens the thing.  You cant tell me thats worth 0% when theres nothing stopping me from ninja looting the whole thing
---
Yeah, I will be using this trinket, hand of justice, and I‚Äôll be farming Ironfoe (for a reckoning build), but beyond this I have discovered it is impossible.  Only shoulder, gloves, shield, trinket and a ring have chance on hit/get hit effect.
---
Tagging a mob then running it through the blizzard is better.
---
yeah i did this the other night as well was really fun
---
Only one of those places is a dungeon though.
---
BRB, reserving "Fartdick" on my server.
---
I collected the grey sets also back in 2005 I was wearing the twill set.  So much fun showing up to raids in it. Giving RL a heart attack.  :)
---
Honestly i agree only because i dont wanna delete the screenshot from my computer
---
I don't bind strafe but I still strafe with A and D. I use the right mouse button to turn my character, which automatically turns A and D into strafe, allowing me to keep the default turning when needed.
---
Don't see this happening anymore.  
---
  Warriors and rogues are the new huntards from my experience
---
You can get this one and tweek it to show only what you want. I'm too lazy for that tho
---
No u
---
No you both
---
DEM FEEELSS
---
Ah, ok, I always though they were slightly more efficient the higher rank they were, good to know!
---
Hm ok, not quite sure that has much to do with RPG though , at least in my view - but there's tonnes (go read places like the RPGCodex for discussions on 'What is an RPG?', heh) of different ones.  Was just curious what your's was.
---
I wouldn't say WoW's lost its immersion, I still see all the towns and zones have things that I wonder at their function, etc.
---
Not sure but try to get into a medium pop one. Low pops are a bit dead and high pops end up with queues. There is a list of servers if you Google that separates them by pvp/pve and pop and time zone. That's how I found a west coast.
---
Leatrix plus op. Yw
---
omg people use the print screen button instead of recording with your phone. we went over this yesterday.
---
Question, do all quest items that you have in your bag get removed after you turn in your quest? I have a ton of quest items (items given to me by the npc or had to pick up from mobs that aren't normal drops) in my bag that is taking up like 15 spots but feel like I don't have a lot of quests that use them.
---
It will take you longer, but definitely doable. If you don't see anyone advertising for the dungeon you're wanting, just start your own group. You might have to advertise for a bit to get a tank and healer, but in the mean time you can do quests, work on your professions and bank, etc.
---
Don't pick something you don't want just because you'll get faster groups. You'll regret it.
---
Same, It seems you are only supposed to learn skills that benefit teammates if they pay for it.
---
Not OP but that sounds awesome thanks for the info
---
Big true
---
Yeah, there is definitely a place for this, but the post was geared towards Arms warriors leveling 2H. The slam weaving is a bit of a harder skill and requires addons (swing timer). 
---
I have very little knowledge or expertise with Slam but if you can recommend a Slam guide, I will reference it in the OP.
---
But if you have 0 downtime or near-0 downtime what does less damage matter? You're missing out on serpent sting and attack damage from the cat; if I'm already jumping mob to mob I don't care if my pet is at 90% hp or 80% hp. I'm trading time for bandages, and I'd prefer my time over a couple pieces of cloth any day.
---
first thing I do is unbind A and D and replace them with spells. lest a be called a filthy keyboard-turner
---
STOP HEALING THROUGH MY LIFE TAP. I HAVE CANNIBALIZE, BANDAGES, AND FOOD.
---
I don't get it lol. 
---
Every group I've had has been perfectly fine. People need to pay attention and focus. Can't be half adding it cause you will pull stuff. Feel it's the perfect dungeon for 30ish. Prepares you for the craziness that can come later.
---
This may be the best option, I'm not the most knowledgeable but I can't deny how fun dual wielding is. I am put talents in down to impale and then going down the fury tree. It's probably not the best but it's a lot of fun!
---
Favorite is when enemy mage polymorphs you to save you from having to eat/drink
---
If I slap your name on these said lists, who's to say you deserve it? Who is making sure you arnt just adding every player you want any time. That is my concern with these types of addons.
---
TIL that icon is a sword with the "swing" thing.
---
I always just figured it was some blue crystal or some shit.
---
‚ÄúTop players‚Äù lmao
---
We really don't care.
---
#5 don't be gnome.   
---
/Cries in gnomish
---
Ok. I think BFD is a little high for my level? May need someone to carry me through it lol. Thanks!
---
Weapon dps is king. That said it's considered a dick move to need on a caster 1h if one of them needs it. Getting an upgrade isn't worth the potential risk to your server reputation.
---
You would be surprised how quickly you can get effectively blacklisted if you affend someone petty in a big guild.
---
If you miss the jump, 50 dkp minus.
---
But then you have to remember to delete it. If you take a pic through the reddit app you dont have go worry about storage space
---
Just limit the number of transfers, easy way to combat this. Would make it nice for people like me who just want to join friends.
---
People who do this cancel their auctions if people bid on them. This is just so people without auction house items tend to see them first.
---
Gotchu fam.
---
&gt; But the thing is, they can proc off each other.
---
For a while during vanilla, holy spec had a talent that gave a chance for an instant smite.  It could proc off itself, giving priests high-dps chains of instant damage spells (though it drained mana like you wouldn't believe; fortunately well-attired priest had enormous mana pools). That was apparently a bug, but they tried and failed at least three times to patch it before just changing it to a flat damage increase.
---
Not at all. I remember back during Wrath, some player challenged me to a duel. We were about even healthwise, and i used a healing potion. He called me a cheat for it. I told him it was a duel. And i used every advantage at my disposal to win.
---
Holy Fire is a great opener and has great DoT. I use it every mob encounter.
---
I played for the longest time in wow without using any bar mods as I like to be as light on mods as possible. On retail I'm using Bartender4, but I'm kind of holding out on installing it on classic for nostalgia purposes.
---
It's expensive to heal DPS, speccing holy/disc would mitigate this some small amount, but ultimately every healer has that issue.
---
Looks like you have the idea, try to lump your spellcasting together to regen mana between while wanding (of course without letting anyone die). I actually like to use renew for this purpose rather than downranked heals on non-immediate threats, it's slightly less mana efficient but because it saves me 3 seconds of cast time, it becomes slightly more mana-efficient (for my level/spi/etc., you can take a look at your mana regen rate and figure out what 1.5 ticks is). I'll throw one on the tank after a set of heals.
---
Maybe the outside is the friends we made along the way?
---
NO CAP IS THE SUGARY TREAT
---
Hillsbrad is ruthless man. I finally caved and broke my code yesterday. I had one rule and that was to not kill alliance side druids to preserve that class kinship, but man none of them seemed to respect that rule. Kept getting ganked on sight.
---
One time I was running back and saw this one druid getting chased down by a gang of horde and I'm ashamed to say I joined in on that killing.
---
I have one guy written down as a ninja, but I'm pretty sure he already quit, and one guy for being a toxic dumbass who can't tank, and one guy is KOS for camping people.
---
Those are pretty much the only things I can imagine actually avoiding people over.
---
Also, If players aren't eating between pulls don't top them off and then waste more mana. 
---
Just keep the tank topped between pulls, drink mana only if you're under 40%. You shouldn't be going OOM every pull, if you are you're spamming the wrong spell, or the tank is doing something horribly wrong, possibly dps getting aggro and splitting heals up.
---
The key to zooming through a dungeon at a reasonable pace is to minimize downtime between pulls, as a tank I usually do this by doing 4 pack pulls, 1 mob pulls, 4 pack pulls, etc. Ideally I should always be attacking something if I'm not under 60% hp to keep rage pooled. If DPS want to drink they don't need to attack until they're full mana.
---
This, Watch Xaryu, he will explain what hes thinking and why hes doing it. Until you get your own feel of what someone is about to do and what you need to be doing to counteract it, watch high skill players who commentate.
---
Only read about half of it. I'm not the most familar with alliance zones. Would it have been easier to go to booty bay&gt;ratchet?
---
huh, there's a lot more to damage calcs than I thought. Is there a guide that has all this kind of information in it? like how crit damage is calculated, diff between dodge and parry, etc?
---
I'm not saying to stack sunder armor on every mob. I rarely get more than 3 on a single mob. But it is far better to use Sunder when the enemy is above 50% HP than HS. Look at the spreadsheets that were added.
---
My wife redirects, buffs and heals everyone she can. Anytime she sees a dead body we're stopping for at least 10 seconds. Last night she saw a body and tried to resurrect it. It was a troll and we play Alliance.
---
Only difference is you can identify an asshole mage at the start of the run instead of when there's treasure in front of him.

Fait moi l'amour!

Do bank alts need to be level 10
---
For the record, I was wrong lol. You need +100 healing power before they are equal: https://tegas.github.io/legacy-sim/#/heal
---
I think this was later changed and my info was bad, because I read another post (again, probably pertaining to a later retail patch) that spells were normalized post 20. I have to go check that source now.
---
That's why you use crossbows.

completely different imo, no one was spamming bg finder to level and bypass the entire game and transform it into a series of instances, it added organisation to something that is absolutely better with organisation, it‚Äôs not like a raid where people can just schedule it because they happen all the time
---
Like I said, you play how you want to play. If you legitimately think ransoming loot that you all worked together to get to is your preferred style then by all means go ahead. It doesn't change the perception of the act simply because you feel entitled to said loot.
---
An orc has no name. An orc must work-work

Little do you know it‚Äôs a guy on a RP server whose character is a female human mage named Ana L Secks
---
If you're going to PURELY tank and never do anything else, those are 5 points you might as well spend at some juncture. 
---
If you want to flex into cat or healing, those are usually the first 5 points dumped. It's a very small mitigation bump at the end of the day (it's just items).
---
It‚Äôs been working fine for me for the past hour now
---
So everyone focusing on negatives ,i will tell you benefits .For raiding great healer (but i am gonna go feral screw it ) with great benefit in Innervate .Great in pvp as well .Feral is great in 5 man dungeon but yeah loses in raids ...you can dps but its gonna be hard to reach rogues ,you can off tank as well fine.
---
Best benefit is that they are hybrid and they can do multiply jobs in raids depending on boss fight .
---
Hah, I like to think the internal logic of the Character is: Hmmm, forced escort mission or severing the head and bring it back...yep I got the bag space.
---
I posted a full simulation that is now in OP.
---
Yes, and Chen's keg is in the game and is an homage and the quest mentions him and Rexxar. These aren't an homage to they are even mentioned in game (WoW) as naga landing craft, and are modeled on the unit from WC2.

The naga carriages are used both in battle and in transportation of their supplies on to land. The naga do not treat their mounts well, and often let them get killed.
---
Also add in felhunter and GG
---
Must be that setting then. I'll be back to test it out soon, hopefully the advanced interface addon has default settings to revert if needed.
---
A holy paladin that went ret for soloing. I can heal just fine. Ret paladin is cool because you can do dps (not much I know) and heal. Just be patient when you're the only healer and the tank always pull too many mobs.

Not a single streamer that matters is playing retail.

i think pugging and guild consortiums are going to be common in P1
---
a lot of guilds have small numbers of old raiding veterans that are sticking together but still need warm bodies
---
if you have a core of 10-15 solid players, theres little downside to forming aliances with other similar guilds and just rolling for loot in MC with how easy it is 
---
BWL+ will go back to the old system but there will be more 60s then
---
That is a ... Surprisingly uncomfortable logic.
---
Lvl 12 mage easily solo‚Äôd Hogger, the real boss during vanilla really was the internet and now it‚Äôs queues

Players spam bg finder so they can earn honor faster to buy gear. Its literally the same thing as dungeon finder especially since 1.12 is crossrealm as well.

I had a female night elf demon hunter with a somewhat feminine name, got catcalled once asking if I like naughty... he wanted to make an erp video fof his youtube channel that did not exist as I looked it up. Claimed he had 600 subscribers lol. Kinda put it in light what some women go through.
---
I was doing the ungoro gorilla escort, was 10 yards from the finish when the server restarted. I started the quest right after the 15 min warning.. then it suddenly changed to 5 mins warning. Knew I was probably hosed at that point.
---
To be honest there's a big difference. Nobody is waiting to find an opponent in PvE. If you want to PvE with 4 other friends, you find four other friends and you're ready to go. When it comes to PvP the ability to quickly find a match that provides a worthy challenge is CRITICAL to the success of such a system. The game shouldn't punish the player for the game not immediately delivering content (other players) to face, so it shouldn't be strict about letting you participate in other activities when you wait because the system itself is responsible for the wait rather than you the player (as compared to PvE where you can jump into an instance as soon as you're ready, so the burden is on you).
---
Right, avoiding it like the plague was an overstatement, it certainly has its uses, especially when specced into it, but personally, I almost never use it.
---
In what possible situation would you want to delete a quest item and keep the quest?
---
Like 7 silver max  in the AH on my server for those, it‚Äôs okay to splurge a little
---
Maybe I'm alone, but I disagree.
---
It can be done to great effect, you just have to suspend the belief when you encounter other priests.
---
SWTOR did it amazingly well and eventually leaned more into the single-player storyline because it was so well done (it's a shame the gameplay mechanics were somewhat stale for an MMO or it would have been much more popular. The idea is that, for multiplayer content, YOU are the special dude (and they even sort of 'force' one person to dictate the choices of mini cinematics in dungeons and whatnot), and the people in your party are your helpers - except for THEM, they're the special dude and you're the partner.
---
Here's how I see it:
---
* In Vanilla, you're a grunt that shows promise, you go through the grind, doing a few deeds that get noticed on a small scale while also helping in the grander scale.
---
* In BC, you literally help defeat Illidan in a small team of 10-25 people (I think the raid went up to 25 at least, could be wrong). That's, like, important.
---
* In TFT, you're recognized and an integral part of the war against Arthas. I specifically remember getting one of the first quests and the commander is like "oh thank god you've arrived [player]!" You're legit important, but haven't reached 'legendary' status yet.
---
* We all sort of skipped the next two expansions, so I can't speak for them! XD
---
* In Legion, you've accomplished so much and have been *so fucking integral* to so many victories that the only *real* common factor is you and the other 'leaders of their class'. You've legit *proven* that you are the leader of your class. The leveling quests in Legion were amazing and story-rich for WoW, I was so impressed by their team, and the raids, while not "Vanilla hard", were challenging and again - story rich. They were fun, too, and felt like real dangers.
---
* I played BfA for like a month and couldn't really get past the fact that I *literally* just killed a god/demon, as well as several villains who have been around since Warcraft 1, and now I'm, like, helping trolls or some shit.
---
WoW is your story. That's why I love it. It's not the story of me and 5 million other people, it's my story, and it's been going on for 15 years.
---
My two cents.
---
How?
---
Almost all of that is easily searchable public information.
---
My crafts are too strong for you traveller
---
As one of the only people I have seen who have stepped into MC I have a question for you, or anyone who knows 100%.
---
Does Major Domo drop the leaf and eye right now? In Phase 1?
---
your just mad you have downs syndrome and get treated like a pet
---
Wouldnt it have been quicker to get the boat to theramore?
---
get gnomed
---
Get TSM and get it setup for Classic cooking. It will tell you what bits you can buy and make a profit from. It‚Äôs a bit of work to setup. There are tutorials online.
---
Female warrior i mean seriously. And no i had one other name hit a couple months ago for my OG worgen druid "Ieatyou"
---
Skip the talent while leveling, not worth.  Almost every talent in that tree is more valuable, because it gives a new capability, rather than boosting a (fairly meaningless) number.
---
Yesterday my internet died right before the boss with a reallllly smooth aoe clear group. I feel bad. It feels bad.
---
Don't know whether to laugh or gasp at that comment. (I'm laughing)
---
Man i spend a lot fucking time farming mats for my lvl 13 night elf rogue's beastlaying +2 on both weapons, the only reason was that glow. Got it enchanted on these terrible daggers that i kept using refusing to swap them for another pair until lvl 25. I died a million times cause I didnt do enough damage but it was amazing and totally worth for the glow
---
yep leave us tanks alone the dps in half my runs are already suicidal please don't make my job harder.
---
Mark is nice for hunter too but I ain't complaining
---
One thing a lot of people forget, is to make sure you are putting the highest rank of the spell on your action bar. I'm pretty sure higher ranked spells are not added to your action bar by default.
---
Can you elaborate? There is a size cap active now in classic, and you want it removed or what? Im confused.
---
I just wonder if my alts will make it to 60 with either of these names:
---
Bigolcritties
---
Axhole
---
When I was lower level I would sap 1, evasion/bf to kill two and then depending on health either vanish or kill the third and vanish.
---
Once I got to the high 30's I could just sap, kill the 3 and then kill the 4th when sap broke usually with a gouge/bandage.
---
No blade flurry would make things pretty rough imo.
---
I'm not crying you're crying.

That's a Mage who stands behind the mob and whacks it with their staff.

I was there.
---
Poony - 41 Human Warrior reporting in!
---
Most of your skills are based on weapon damage. The rank up would increase the total dmg by a small margin. While worth it later on, because every bit helps... pre 40 you just want to save as much gold as you can for that mount!
---
Amen. I began playing near the end of TBC, and as is my habit in RPGs, I rolled a Warrior. It was a long and painful journey to 60, at which point WotLK had dropped and I rerolled as a Death Knight to first venture into the Outlands, and then Northrend. 
---
In Classic, I have rolled a Shaman, with a druid alt. If I see any warriors struggling, I will stop and help. Stoneclaw/Earthbind totem, Healing Waves, Earth Shock + Rockbiter weapon to pull aggro... whatever I can do to assist. I know how hard the life of a Classic warrior can be, so I feel like it is my duty to help them out as much as I can.
---
Thanks m8
---
Go get the fish used for that Deviate recipe?  Can‚Äôt remember the name.
---
Nice tip Sankir, Very Nice!
---
At max level with a friend (pref warr / pally / mage) you could farm SM for silk and split it 50/50. Not the best farm, but definitely not the worse.
---
Yes, prior to becoming kaldorei they were dark trolls.
---
I agree. In fact, I think if we'd had that 'do half the dungeon now and the rest later' mindset from the start, it wouldn't have been so frustrating.
---
Our healer was also pretty painfully bad, but in his defense, the end of the dungeon had a lot of spikey damage.
---
I don‚Äôt know why is so hard for you guys to understand it‚Äôs clearly a bug. Stop defending it as if it‚Äôs not
---
Agree to disagree.
---
I don't think we're going to reach a consensus if you believe immersion doesn't have much to do with an rpg /shrug

You can get a wand in BFD that will last you 20 levels

~5k queue at prime time which is about 1-2 hours. I wouldn't play on Whitemane when all other US West Coast servers are at or close to max capacity but with no queue

Horde has a reason to be ugly, alliance races look horrifying because of dated graphics

Considering the tone of this thread, it's easy to assume how it went down and why you got kicked, to be honest.
---
That's the beauty of language. There is no such thing as wrong as long as you are conveying the ideas you mean to convey. If people suddenly decide that they will no longer use the singular form of mice and refer to all mousies as mice irregardless of the quantity, "Look at that mice" is perfectly cromulent. The idea that you are using language wrong is an outdated idea from when people tried to define language instead of allowing usage to define it.
---
Oh yea, first name privilage is nice
---
That or the ability to set your level down.
---
Would make for even playing field in PvP.
---
Fair enough
---
just makes me think if its this bad now, imagine when the honor system goes online?

It's a pretty different thing. Before the battlemasters people weren't always spamming looking for groups to be social in PvP. Battlegrounds themselves were pretty anti-social experiences, travel to the location, queue up and end up in whatever group. If anything BGs themselves were a detriment to the social aspect of PvP as you didn't have to form groups to fight groups of alliance like you do in the open world. So no, I can't say I agree with you. Battle masters simply made queueing into BGs more practical, and ensure the queues aren't nearly as long.
---
Cook food for yourself? I mean you could try to AH mats that people use to level cooking. Find a guide online that shows you how to get it to 300 and farm all the items and sell it as a leveling package and direct people to that site
---
It's a dead talent level. Your options are increased bash and pounce stun, better prowl/tanking, better shouts, or armor.

I'd take the improved stun, some people swear by 1 point in feral instinct, but the rest is getting dumped into thick hide.

i do not.  i used it on a blood elf bank toon back in the day, but i don't have a shot of it.

Yes, shamans can tank raids. But I will demand a great deal of effort. I was a successful shaman raid tank making half my way into Naxx. By no means is it easy, but imo it's the most engaging and thrilling spec to play and imposes an actual challenge you can feel proud of upon completing. With WoW being a +14year old game many players are seeking a fresh new spin to the game, shaman tanking is one of those reinvigorating nostalgia moments of when WoW was actually hard. Also check out the Shaman Tanking Bible: https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150 Happy to answer any questions you might have.

This happened back then too. This is no changes my friend

If they are dickfucks, I name my pet after them, except &lt;theirname&gt;sucks. 
---
My starter boar is named Chainheals, after the Shaman healer that I first ran RFC with.

Be nice to everyone, and suggest that they name their pet after you. The hunter might laugh and do it!

In all reality they probably did something the reporters didn't like and sho they got reported.

Skip it
---
pretty sure there's only one
---
Yes, we did get matched with "random players" but those random players were from our server and in the lower level brackets there were so few people that this crazy unpredictably random player was Thomas. And then next round it was Thomas. Let me queue again, oh look it's Thomas again. 
---
I call him by his first name because we're still friends more than a decade later. 
---
The cross server battlegrounds already broke this and they'll be in classic too. It would be better without them but the faction balance is a problem.
---
Without enemy cast bars I think people have a more difficult time knowing they can interupt.
---
We find our true friends on the battlefield.
---
[Princess](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=330/princess) is a level 9 mini-boss and one of the first notable ones.
---
[Hogger](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=448/hogger) is the second notable questing mini-boss. He is an Level 11 elite which means he is an effective +4 levels, and thus a level 15 (usually) requires a (full) party (of 5) to take down. He can be challenging for new players who don't understand how the tank / dps / heal roles work (yet.)
---
The joke is that leveling is trivial if you just do quests -- most items are crap below level 11. :-)
---
Did you play during Wrath at all? I had that happen *all the time* in Icecrown. It doesn't really bother me. The issue that I had with Cata was how they just beat you over the head with it. The Mt Hyjal zone in particular was really bad.
---
"Did you kill those fire elementals?" 
---
*Elementals disappear*
---
"Good job, now go over there for something else."

And that's just *all it was for 7 or 8 cycles.*

but then you have to stretch more for zxcv; unless you use your thumb i guess.

The guild im in with my friend said yesterday that everyone who isnt 60 by the 20th of this month will be kicked. That's crazy right? Like I'm level 35 and I have like 3 and a half days logged. I know I'm shit at leveling efficently but that's kind of crazy right?

# &lt;FRESH&gt; [US][Thunderfury-PvP][Horde] Medium-core Raiding and PvP
---
 **FRESH** is a guild on the best named server Thunderfury. We have created a drama free and chill community for people that want to enjoy classic together. Leadership has extensive experience from vanilla and private servers clearing all of Naxx. We will be raiding guild with some PvP premades mixed in but our primary focus is raiding. Mediumcore means that you should show up to raids with consumables and be prepared to focus on efficient clearing. We are a group of players with jobs and family so we will not be requiring a hardcore amount of time spent on the game.

We're looking for players that can commit to the planned raid schedule..No less than 80% attendance is very much encouraged. And we don't just need a warm body to fill a slot on the roster. We need detail oriented players with situational awareness. And of course, someone that can work and play with a team. We don't just want people that will log in to raid and then be done. We want a community of players that get along both during a raid as well as after. We will be focused on clearing content fast and efficient.

I disagree mate. And like i said that is your opinion. No facts were stated only opinions casted off as facts. 
---
I brought up a mage who routinely destroyed locks on video, and i myself routinely destroy locks. This isnt retail this is vanilla mages can absolutely destroy locks 1v1 .
---
the man is telling people to get rid of social security and is too afraid to defend his senseless point. He's a coward. And in-authentically ending an argument with, "I don't want to argue, but you're uninformed, have a good day!" is being an asshole.
---
Haha, what a great story. Wailing caverns truly takes a lot of time when you have newbies with you.
---
I had a different experience, though I can relate. Me a mage and my shaman healer friend formed a group for WC. 
---
We invited a lvl 16 shaman who claimed he was about to ding 17. But he dinged somewhere near the last boss. He also claimed to be Pro in retail PvP, which wasn't very useful in this dungeon. 
---
We had a druid tank who went out form to heal everytime he was low even when he had 5 mobs on him. So he nearly died on every pull. Also he couldn't keep aggro of the shaman that was using earth shock.
---
Luckily there was another mage and we managed to keep 2 targets sheeped at all time. 
---
We gave them some handy tips and it went better and better. No whipes but still a 2 hour run. 
---
And that is my classic wow experience. Loving the game.
---
I was having these issues and tried just about everything in the book. Fully closing out my twitch app from control panel is what finally did the trick.

Start attack is not the same as auto attack it does not cancel the auto attacks.

Name it after the first player you see, or the first player that calls out the no-name-pet.

Clearing PVE content has purpose other than pure cash.  Exp, BoP loot, quest chains etc....the lock box is only about $$$.
---
I guess? I mean, either way, you played an hour of WoW.
---
Sometimes I like to blast through sometimes as quickly as possible. Other times going more languidly can be fun. My general goal is "how can I make this entertaining", as opposed to "how can I get this done as fast as humanly possible". The latter generally tends to invoke burnout/content exhaustion.
---
&gt;Its beyond me why people sell so much of it and for so little, but hey it's there. 
---
Because they vendor for 1c each and take no real skill or investment to acquire, just a little patience.

I guess, but he‚Äôs banned for fucking with the economy so it‚Äôs somewhat relevant in his situation. We‚Äôre just his peers though, and not the judge and jury, so our opinions are only opinions and in the end mean nothing.
---
You can reroll class at any time but your race and base stats will stay the same, the game brings u in at the same level as your main, but you only get level 1 skills.
---
Shitty mechanic imo
---
Red=dead
---
do you have any apps open in the background? Twitch app was giving me issues.
---
You understand this isn‚Äôt a screenshot right?  Screenshots don‚Äôt move.   It‚Äôs a Gif. Plus most people use their phones for pictures as they already have Reddit loaded on it.  Making it easier to upload instantly.   Seriously..  I can‚Äôt believe this is an actual issue people don‚Äôt understand.   Yes the quality is worse.  They don‚Äôt care.
---
It‚Äôs been around for 15 years. No streamer ‚Äúmade it up‚Äù

It is literally dungen finder foe pvp.

It is cross realm. You queue from a city. It teleports you into the instance. It pairs you with random teammates.

How can you deny this?

Is there a "transit schedule" addon that lets you know roughly when the boats/zeps will be arriving? Would be nice and would help out with planning long trips.

How do you make it so class colors show?
---
Tank controls the pace. If you don't like it you can roll a tank
---
Oops, looks like you missed the entire point about how locks don't actually need healers to babysit them. As a class, balancing mana and hp is literally how we function; we got this.

ID NEVER PLAY ON WHITEMANE IF IT WERE THE LAST SERVER ALIVE

Yeah I went addons free till like 35. Then my bags got bananas and my bars all cluttered. Trying to stay away from the flashing-lights-everything-you-need-to-read-out-to-your-face style interface people had by legion/bfa
---
I mean, that doesnt show who is offline so... wtf are you even talking about.

If you google Echeyakee, Wowhead is the first link and the third comment is a guy saying he named his pet "HelpTameEch" and did a /beg.

Only problem with macro'ing distract is that you cant see the range of it or its area of effect.  But it could be helpful in emergency situations.

yep, still here,drooling over my attention?
---
I thought you where 'too mature to play with children'' but your still here you pedofile
---
Thanks for sharing this idea, as I replied before I didn't think about going to Theramore, it kinda looks like a better plan. We didn't plan it well that's for sure, but if we ever try that again we'll use your method!
---
Okay there Mr money bags.
---
Shouldn't have taken the warlock VIP shortcut as a rogue.
---
Quest greens = soulbound, not what I'm talking about.

Minus the whole Tauren genocide thing.

Thinking I might try here just because I like the name :)

Still ez xp
---
Bloody brilliant mate
---
He knows what you did last summer.
---
The incenderite quest outta Stonetalon in the charred vale. I swear there was maybe 4 fire elementals in the whole area and about 7 people running around killing them all while dodging wandering mobs around my level (26ish).
---
‚ÄúClassic is such a better community‚Äù
---
Look at the shit people are talking...lol so much for the happy week or two you all had.
---
Do you know how many hours I sunk into vanilla 2004-2005? I do. And a large chunk of that time was spent grinding for a epic mount.
---
3 days lol. If it took that time I could‚Äôve bought epic mount for the entire server.
---
I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have money, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.
---
Yes, this is the current function of that addon. You have to spam the ability until it goes off really... Somewhat of an annoyance and macros may be more effective.
---
Close lol, its the peak.
---
see ya anus, /wave!
---
ah you are probably referring to this quest:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=483/the-relics-of-wakening](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=483/the-relics-of-wakening) 
---
This chain familiarized me with the dying process in this game, corpse running, and rez sickness.
---
no one did that in vanilla lol not to this extent
---
Also some players have found a way to change gender in game but from what I understand that‚Äôs a random perk during character creation.
---
The Gnomer map has incorrect info on the keycard locations...
---
Warcraft isnt recognized in the science world either...
---
What do the colors have to do with that name?
---
Funny how you're commenting here on how obnoxious and how he took things too far but yet, in his video, he claims he's the nicest person and has the nicest guild on the server and simply loooves to interact with others on the server.
---
You're friend was one of those dumbasses in general chat that think they can spew all the shit they want because they're "invincible" in their virtual world. Just hearing him complain in this shitty 30min about how easily people are offended nowadays and everyone is just a "grey NPC". 
---
On top of ALL this, you're the messenger boy on reddit for his pathetic excuse of a story or else you'll get demoted??
---
Your GM is a total asshat and deserves to be the known asshat of his realm. Heck this is the FIRST time I heard about someone getting muted so hard, what this toxic moron GM doesn't realize is that his own realm despises him. Doesn't even matter if he rerolls at this point, people will know.
---
Used to sit in vent with the top alliance guild on the server and do this to people back in BC!
---
I love the Gizlock's!
---
It also has a threat meter option.
---
I hear you, but this is really an impossible/stupid standard to live by. What happens when you're running into BRM and see a raid prepping for MC/BWL? You're gonna kill them all? What about when you're invited to a Scholo run and you see a level 56 Warrior questing? You're gonna hold up your group a little longer just so you can kill the Warrior?
---
I tried the "if red; then dead" standard for a little while and it's a dumb strategy. It's more like, if it's red, I'll kill him if circumstances permit me to kill him. That's my standard.
---
That's why you transfer so you can actually play the fucking game lol

TIMMAH!

He‚Äôs one of the most prolific WoW youtubers, love him or hate him.
---
The best part of this is as Prot you will win 100% of the time vs an Arms warrior.
---
I have *never* been beaten by an Arms war in a duel or WPvP.
---
Mages technically
---
Definitely SPI/INT over spellpower for dungeons, you could consider +healing which is usually more than +spellpower, but spellpower isn't a priority.
---
For soloing I would say play with both sets of gear. I swapped in a +shadow damage hat/staff and lost about 29 spirit and 5 int for about +40 shadow damage and it made a big deal as far as mana regen, so I switched back.
---
Happy to help!
---
Heartseeker is picking up, and you can help yourself out here by avoiding referring to the server as dead. The population has been doubling each day so far and the difference last night compared to two nights ago was huge. 
---
It's likely blizzard will keep the transfers open until it reaches an appropriate level (they said they would be closed after the weekend, but here we are on Tuesday with transfers still active.) It won't die without any external influence (like this post), but it is a self fulfilling prophecy if everyone calls it dead.
---
This is the experience you can expect. I would say, talk to the group before you even start running to the instance, if they refuse to pace with you post that; leaving there group would be their fault. Retail and the mobs doing shit damage in instances on classic has the players thinking they can just do what ever they want.
---
The worst part about it is, they auto-pilot with no consideration to how they are directly making much more work for you so that they can do very little effort work.
---
This should be daily instead of just on Sundays. Most people have stupid questions every day of the week. And we really need a no stupid questions thread to handle them.
---
Don't forget about priestbros!
---
Prot warrior leveling telling me to L2P. Bitch im alrdy 60 wtf
---
nah, some people keeps reporting it doesn't work properly.
---
"Mythology of the Titans" requires you to loot a book near the end of SM library. You can pick it up from the Explorers League in IF.
---
As a mage I‚Äôm more than happy to wait, and then some, because in my experience I‚Äôm always about 2 seconds into my drink when the warrior has pulled the next group.
---
Druids are garbage.
---
I do the second thing too much. I have a habit of killing every single mob whos level is at least green.
---
If you want to tank a bunch of dungeons as you level you could make an argument for both thick hide and feral instinct in that row. I would say take 1 of them and keep going down the tree. I'd personally take feral instinct. Put points into the one you didn't choose if there's no more talents on the current row that you want but need to dump points to unlock the next row.    
---
There's no one right answer, an ideal 100% lvl 60 tank build would take both. But you could argue for taking both of the top talents and skipping the second row for a spec that can tank but do more cat dmg on the side.     
---
Sorry I don't really have a clear answer for you. If I had to give a simple short answer, I'd say skip it most of the time.
---
Cookies Cove*
---
a spreadsheet with the same format would have taken less time.
---
Does spirit tap work in pvp on targets of same level or do I need to get exp for it to work? If it needs exp to work, does it work at level 60?
---
Depends on your role or spec and the rest of your teammates. My group had a 27 DPS paladin but also a 31 tank/warr and 28 healer/priest
---
Anything.  If a quest requires you to get gorilla giblets and you have 1, if you delete it the quest goes away.
---
You know you can move right?
---
You shoot, move through deadzone, hit, move out of deadzone and shoot again.
---
Thanks my dude. My shaman is an alt for when I don‚Äôt want to grind out the levels on my main, so I was hoping to do a spec/class that‚Äôs kinda off the wall. Doesn‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúmeta‚Äù but I wanted to know if it was efficient and how sustainable it‚Äôd be inching towards endgame.
---
*shot on potato *

Fuckin THANK YOU! I hate how scrunched up it is

Dont forget jaina and ronin also super OP mages

Mum says I'm an unexpected error.

increasing cooldown between switches
---
Nice dress, really brings out your girlish figure.
---
Speaking of which, why does nobody do hogger in Elewyn? Maybe it's just my server but nobody every is making groups for it and nobody asks to join when posting a LFG
---
Damnit, just caught myself sitting like an Orc again...
---
Haha I play as a NElf Priest and people just come up to me and ask if I can make em something. I carry around a stack of coarse thread and a few fine thread at all times just in case.
---
If somebody gives me a hand I typically give them a couple linen bags to say thank you since they can vendor them for 4s or AH for 6ish.
---
you act like this wasnt a thing in vanilla
---
Which items besides the world shrinker have to be used specifically by gnomish? Can't find the list anywhere.
---
I get that, but then, maybe the option to have "mercenaries" from the other faction would have solved that without involving the cross-realm solution.
---
Any tips? Can't get close enough to fear or drain life, pet wacking, etc
---
Grind it out.
---
I never really forgot any of the Classic dungeons. 
---
Best is and will always be Blackrock Depths. It's the best dungeon design in the history of MMOs, let alone WoW. Hugely atmospheric, ridiculously sprawling, absolutely swarming with bosses and loot, and optional pathways and locked doors and nooks and crannies. Feels like something lovingly handcrafted to be an epic dungeoneering adventure, inspired by the Mines of Moria.
---
Worst would be either RFC or Wailing Caverns. Both lack a lot of personality. The first is just a big fiery cave, the second is scenically drab and easy to get lost in.
---
Never been a huge fan of either of the Razorfen dungeons either. Pig overload in there.
---
Mages more than likely.
---
I know dude. Something inside me tells me that this isnt intended but fuck it. Its much more fun like this.
---
I thought the reason for druids not doing 1v1s was because of the nigh unending attrition cycle of bear form -&gt; heal -&gt; bear form.
---
Right? Conjuring water makes everything faster because you can spam it instead of trying to conserve your expensive af water.
---
It is dumb that there is a weekly one, but not a daily one. Do y'all only have stupid questions on Sunday? I have stupid questions every day of the week!
---
I'm a tad confused, what is this a solution to?
---
What server?  Took me a few tries to get 1 as someone else was always there and was a skull
---
Don't really want a "meme" name.
---
Why am I reading that in DJ Khaleds voice?
---
Rip heartseeker
---
Love it: faster XP, can be exciting for some people.
---
Hate it: gear competition between clothies, everyone usually gets aggro, class restriction happens, can be boring and repetitive to some people.
---
Personally I dislike cleave runs more since the type of people doing this have been, in my experience, far more likely to flake in the middle of the run, or not listen to the tank/group leader. They're just there for the fast exp. I've had more fun doing dungeons with a lot of different classes and following the tank's pace.
---
Nope, I see my horde brothers get attacked and I'll help regardless of if I can win or not.
---
Sounds a bit weird yeah.

A Classic WoW Guild for mature players focused on letting you play the game the way you want. We require no skill or attendance so it's almost like we aren't even a Guild at all! Go as hardcore as you want or take a year to hit 60 as long as you're having fun.  
---
Formed by a group who has played for many years together in high end PvE and PvP content and want to foster a good social environment of consistent players. We will take a laid back approach to all things and will be focusing on leveling, dungeons, BGs/WPvP, and Raiding with 2 nights/week events and activities. Members will be able to do any of these activities if they have the necessary items to approach the content.  
---
We are always welcoming new members with like mindsets.  
---
Feel free to message my character, Hoax, in game or reach out on this thread for more details.
---
Ok, so I will definitely roll an ally toon on this server and if it is alright with you, I could PM you later to get an invite to the guild as long as you don't mind having a low level join?
---
No, because you don't even stumble upon it as if you want to level up you move to another zone.
---
Try to keep up, mate.
---
yep i can still make you reply, because your ego hurts? you know i'm a shitposter right? we intentionally rile people up like right now and if you want to be the adult here, don't get into fights with children and master-baiters here
---
is you finally done using all your mental thinking? you know if you put me on ignore i will go away but untill you do, i can imply you sleep with horseradish's and the burden of proof that you don't have sex with food
---
Jaine in BFA is the most OP ass pull ever and if it wasnt for her the alliance would all be dead after the undercity battle
---
HAHA excellent. For real though? Could I get at least one more sentence of supporting thoughts?
---
That‚Äôs cause booty bay is made up of structures where as ironforge is terrain (with structures placed inside). Same thing with like the Zul‚ÄôFarrak walls. You end up being ‚Äòindoors‚Äô even though you‚Äôre clearly under the sky. Next time you‚Äôre outside a building with mortar you can climb on, try it. It marks you inside.
---
Just did a test run to see if this was true. Not the case for me, still broken.
---
Is there anywhere I can see the calculations to verify this kind of stuff? The guide I‚Äôve been using to level my warrior seems to suggest sunder armor is only better for dps than heroic strike under certain conditions, rather than the other way around. I‚Äôm not 100% familiar with all the systems at play so I‚Äôm wondering if someone who is has been able to prove one is better than the other for overall dps.
---
So for reference I‚Äôve played max level retail until the end of legion, I have a 30 on Mankrik and a 15 on bloodsail buckaneers for classic.
---
From what I can tell it really depends on your class.  Hunters seemingly have a much harder time getting in a group than a warlock in classic.  As a warlock I can generally get a group together within 20 minutes.  My hunter alt struggles to get into any group and any small mistake leads to a kick.  Average wait time has been around 2 hours. I have also found people tend to be nicer to my warlock.  Maybe it is just the server but the hunter stigma gives me pause.  
---
If you want to DPS on a class that can heal or tank be expected to fill that role, otherwise people get pissy.  I have heard that Shadow priests don‚Äôt exist or that druids can only heal more times than I can count.
---
Then there‚Äôs people like me who don‚Äôt discriminate and eat both. My favorite meal ü•∞
---
I thought hurricane season was over. /stonerchuckle
---
It's been 15 years, but I don't remember quest rewards ever being so anti-my class
---
Thats fair, now youve agreed that you're a coward. You dont realize the main point of the argument. The point is, you're the kind of player everyone hates.
---
You deliberately choose it that way. Thats fine.
---
And dont argue with "its just a game". Yeah it is. But you can still be a dickhead to others and impact them. And Altough you're doing things that are doable and not bannable in the game, there are rules in a community that you cross. End point of that would be, youre not part of the community and everyone dislikes you.
---
Live with these consequences.
---
None is salty. You didnt gank us, remember? We are not salty. We just dislike you, while your post is crying out for attention and for people to like you and be on your side. Dont say you don't care about that. If you didnt, you wouldn't have made this post in the first place.
---
Gnomergon isn‚Äôt even that bad I‚Äôm not sure why it gets such a bad rep
---
Kromkrush is my server
---
Fuck it just play all day that's what I do
---
After level 60, you will be spamming dgs to get to pre-raid bis items.
---
Just do that now to also get the exp.
---
58 is close to 60 and regardless of your role you can and will perform pretty good in the instance.
---
Honestly, good riddance.  
---
I'm glad that those who rolled a warlock specifically to grief fellow faction members and low level players aren't getting what they wanted and wasted their time so far.
---
I can get through a dungeon without ever needing a mb when the tank gets most of the threat, your way makes me need a MB after every pull slowing the dungeon down massively
---
Depends.
---
Is your class good for solo grinding? Then that.
---
Is your class suited for group play? Run some dungeons.
---
The problem is you're using sunder first
---
Better wait now then wait longer each time you drink because you don't want to spam extra waters because 1 water isn't usually enough.
---
Absolutely, but before the "wow must be like a mobile game in which you drop in, 20 minutes, and then out" came the cross realm. To me, that was the start of the decline. Not the only reason of course.
---
You cant have a horde and alliance char on the same server
---
I really dislike how each expansion gets rid of the stuff added in the last. Garrisons, artifact weapons, etc. Develop what you got, Blizz.
---
the other day I tanked SFK as a level 27 because my buddy needed to get through on his warlock, and we had 2 rogues as the other DPS. 
---
I wasn't in danger of dying at my level, but they were, idiots pulled a LOT of mobs before i even got there.
---
Planning on switching skinning to alch at 60 and banking my herbs on an alt, personally.
---
No real rush to get crafting now IMO, if you want to do a specific profession at 60 set aside an alt and send them all your whatever (i.g. tailoringaltrrquiggs gets mailed all your silk if you want to tailor eventually). Some people like to do it on the way, maybe even make a small amount of money rather than losing a small amount (though they lose from not having gathering as well), but it's a lot more time doing it that way.
---
I tried and failed that on a pserver a while ago. Mad respect.
---
I tried.  Bigballs.  Then I killed 30 or so horde in Hillsbrad, got mass reported for his name and 24hr suspension.
---
Downranking only works with spellpower modifiers. 
---
For leveling, downranking typically doesn‚Äôt really help all that much unless you are oom and trying to keep someone alive on regen alone. 
---
And leveling, you should always have 5/5 spirit tap in shadow. The regen and inside FSR regen is priceless for sustained mana.
---
In this thread, a bunch of redditors argue with a 4channer and end up shocked and surprised when he doesn't play by their rules and honour.
---
We are all low levels atm lol PM garroshi or licelia and we can get ya in
---
Its bis until phase 5 i think actually xD
---
Ya, everybody talking about 200g+ is tripping. Those are Phase 6 prices, not phase 1 2-3 weeks after launch lol. Nobody is going to spend 500g on Cassandra's Grace right now. 50g would be a great sell though, unless OP plans on holding on to it for 15 months when the economy inflates.
---
Kinda his attic since he pays for it, but pretty much lol
---
Reading this gave me chills. I love this game and I love all of you.
---
You mean devoted so much time.
---
There is no waste for something that's worth it. Keep on rockin!
---
Yes mate, just spent 10s on my first pair at 19 and I feel like a king. Treat yo self.
---
Questie is good. It helps out a lot, and I wouldn't worry about "brainless" questing. It's only brainless if you make it that way.
---
Questie does a good-enough job of showing available quests and quest objectives on the map. Some are still missing or glitchy, but whatever.
---
I'm fine with wisdom on my hunter. Who even cares, it lasts 5 min... Some people are just too picky.
---
This needs to be moved forward. Having an automated bot system is a massive exploitation. It's one of the worst I've ever seen in World of Warcraft, if not THE worst.
---
Damn, that's a bummer, I'm at work and was excited that it was fixed.
---
Boomkin is shit, feral is shit, resto is meh.
---
And with as expensive as water is, I wouldn't be able to buy that *and* my class skills.   Even with vendoring and some AHing, basic expenses are still pretty high.
---
Currently I just tip mages for water before going on a run, if I know that there's no mages in my run.   Then I just gotta hope I don't get DC'ed =P
---
Dunno, druids in bear/lion form seem to rip through kill quests with eaze while im there, sitting and drinking for mana on my warlock.
---
Yeah, I am a new orc hunter
---
It's remind me something uh
---
Didn't they just make it so you can't just keep swapping and that a internal cooldown is set for layer swaps so you can't just swap over and over?
---
Both retail and private servers are very much like this because everything in the game has been ‚Äúfigured out‚Äù and optimized to be efficient. So there‚Äôs very little mistakes going into dungeon runs. I know as a tank it is super frustrating at low levels. You are constantly rage starved so you can‚Äôt really do anything about it. 
---
Also stop running after mobs that you lose threat on. You have a melee range taunt and you already have multiple mobs on you so turning your back to them to chase after one is stupid. It is their job to come to you to get the mob off because they shouldn‚Äôt be overaggro and pull threat off a tank.
---
If it‚Äôs doing nothing but ruining your time then rerolling might be the best. Your fun and entertainment should come first always.
---
That's definitely gonna hurt in the morning.
---
Yes of course ,  but I only need the regular mobs  and as a hunter I can pull them at least 1 at the time and I am 27 so pretty mush all enemies are grey or green  but you are right  and I probably Skip the bosses
---
PW:S was changed during Vanilla to be party-only due to causing the Weakened Soul debuff to prevent griefing.
---
Having said that, while the target is Mind Controlled, they're considered the priest's pet, which makes them part of the party, so it should work.
---
It‚Äôs probably because in retail you can hop in right at 15 from LFG and everyone has heirlooms, making it a cakewalk
---
No, I died only twice. First time hunter killed me on the border of Ashenvale/Barrens, and second time i died on the same border thanks to the guard. I saw at least 10 people of the opposite faction on my way and that one hunter was only one who did anything.
---
Again I've never had an issue. I cast PW:S and renew on myself at times when I pull aggro so I can be a bit more mobile and bring the aggro to the tank (renew is almost always enough to full-heal me), but I rarely cast it on DPS (Warlocks being the exception so they can life tap and remain relatively healthy over a long period of time).
---
Benediction isn‚Äôt catch up gear
---
I'm pretty sure that should drop from Mara. idk why it wouldnt be in the game
---
Great to know!! Thank you, love this
---
It's not too bad, just get a shadow wand, do ~30 attacks, record the damage in the log, average them; then do the same with shadowform and the same with 5 stacks of weaving. A 20% and 15% damage increase should be pretty noticeable.
---
I personally do spell damage/healing over spirit/int in normal cases. + healing allows me to downrank spells to be more mana efficient, and shadow damage allows me to burst horde that tries to gank me. I might take more spirit if there is a long boss fight but I have yet to see one that I couldn't manage without.
---
NeatPlates for nameplate overhaul with debuffs shoving over nameplate. However there is blizz like skin in addon.
---
Nug Running - other addon which shows debuff timers of multipile targets in special frame, but also shows cool progression bars over nameplates.
---
I plan on grinding bats in eastern plague lands from 55-60. Just going to skin them for leather and sell anything they drop for extra cash.
---
Reddit is probably not your best place to look for a group as there are a TON of different servers.
---
Instead, when you're in Westfall, type "/1 LFG Deadmines". /1 is the zone's general chat and trust me, there will always be groups forming for Deadmines as it's a VERY popular instance.

I played vanilla and it looks to me to be working exactly as it did back then. P-servers made it too perfect. The old FD only put you out of combat for about half to one second and would take effect about half a second after pressing the key.
---
&gt; DPS shouldn't have aggro ever,
---
I haven't seen a tank that has been able to hold aggro against Siphon Life-Curse of Agony-Corruption consistently. Luckily as a Drain Tank Warlock, it's not been a huge issue because I can heal through a lot of damage (with healer's help of course).

You clearly didn‚Äôt understand the joke

Keys and and all attunements are first, than pre-raid bis. Epic mount, grind out at least one rep to exalted, work others. Could give you hundreds of hours of shit to do. Depending on server id try to pug mc
---
Only people from nice neighbourhoods roll their windows up in bad neighbourhoods, so by rolling yours up you make yourself a target.
---
IMO the benefit of berserk in PvE is not worth losing WotF and Devouring Plague for PvP. But they're both reasonably good, so I'd honestly recommend rolling for flavor. 
---
There's more pressure to play dwarf on alliance for PvE, no real pressure on horde (though you can still heal as other races).
---
Rattlegore was medium for over an hour, dead server!
---
Enchanting will bleed you dry since you will disenchant everything and use the materials to skill. I am curently tailor and miner, because i want to go for engi in the late game (for max dps). Herbalism always pays off. One black lotus and you got yourself 60-80gold on private servers. We still have to see how much they will be worth on official, since the respawn rates are 8 times as long (slower)
---
even better
---
AS a warlock myself, i know exactly what you mean. 29 seems to be a weird gap where you have to wait a bit longer (like level 34 and 36) to get some improved spells, as well as enemies getting higher resistances around 29. I dealt with it too. And be careful with casting Immolate first; you want the VW to get a coupe Torments and hits off before your dots start ticking. IF you must use Immolate, cast Corruption and CoAgony first, then Immolate, so VW has a chance to build up a little threat

This is how it's always worked since 2004.

From say [Billys Camping spot] to [Green Woods] to [Billys Camping Spot] etcetc.
---
There are vanilla videos of hunters being able to pull off FD/Trap seamlessly, so it has to be a bug. Its really annoying because once you get caught by a warrior or a shaman theres little you can do.
---
I think this is probably where the problem lies though - I'm **not trying to rush** the game, vanilla was all about the levelling experience for me; the zones, the dungeons, everything you discovered, not some mad rush to 60.
---
Pretty curious about this one myself.
---
Yeah I got home last night at about 730 pm pst and there was a  90minute queue
---
To those saying that corpse camping is terrible honor: it doesn‚Äôt matter. Honor per rank is all relative. If you are rank 1, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have 500k or 1m honor. Therefore, in phase 2, all that will matter is that you are getting more honor than other players. This means that corpse camping flight paths and only letting a player go when they are worth zero honor will be the meta, as if you are not doing this and someone else is, you are getting less honor than they are, and thus will not be top honor. 
---
tl;dr‚Äîprepare to be corpse camped
---
Yeah, from my personally experience tanking has felt the most rewarding for me to play. It‚Äôs always nice to see big dick numbers doing DPS but there‚Äôs a certain special feeling I get just knowing I‚Äôm this tank badass who is the only one able to not go down in 6 hits from dungeon mobs(2-3 if raiding.)
---
dude I remember running ZF in vanilla and we had to actually use polymorph or sap because if we didn‚Äôt the pulls were rough and we likely died. 
---
I know patch 1.13 and few prior ones made things a bit easier but I never remember just bull rushing shit in vanilla.
---
So yea it‚Äôs a ‚Äúdungeons are super easy now‚Äù thing.
---
Finished the last boss in RFK?!? Here's a 200 pigs to run through on your way out
---
I think the warrior was so underlevelled he didn't even have a taunt learned yet. Definitely a bit overagressive but hilarious to the end of the battle.
---
He probably shopped his copy
---
My first ear infection with complete loss of balance freaked me the fuck out. I thought I was dying. Stood up out of bed...BOOM...right to the floor.
---
No lol
---
There's also a reason that Drain Life exists from an early stage on locks.
---
Yeah I think I just needed to be reminded of all the options vanilla had
---
I do Skinning/Tailoring. I just like not having to rely on anyone else for most recipes. I've thought about dropping skinning for enchanting but enchanting is such an investment that I think I'm better off without it for now.
---
If you haven't played WoW before, and you're only level 12, then how do you know that tanking is pretty fun?
---
You presumably haven't even tanked a single dungeon yet.
---
As a Druid, I would always buff the player and his pet and then think ‚ÄúI bet no one is buffing his pet so he‚Äôs really impressed by my druid skills‚Äù. Little things like that makes me happy.
---
If you go some where that starts out with green quests don‚Äôt be afraid to do them because the next sets will be yellows or orange usually
---
Ok, I'll wait for evidence, otherwise have a nice day.
---
As a priest, it's a hell of a lot of fun
---
Using battle shout / demo shout in def stance builds alot of threat. Battle shout gives a huge boost because its always applying to 5+ allies.  Demo shout scales based on how many enemies are hit. These generate a bunch of threat but you cant just spam them and think everything will work out.  Use thunderclap is you have extra rage.  I like to tab through enemies and make sure 2 sunders are on every mob.
---
Green quests are actually pretty decen afaik, grey is when they need to be dropped.
---
Same with killing mobs, green dies a lot faster and are better exp if you are farming endlessly
---
Not painting all tanks with the same brush by any means. Just something I've noticed more often. Legit had a few drinks with a priest while everyone just kept going. Doesn't happen all the time. I look out for myself obviously. I just expect the tank to look out for the group too since they lead they lead it. Makes sense to me anyways. Not saying the tank should carry the group, but just watch out for them.
---
In Wrath-era Might was the norm for hunters, but especially while leveling, I'll take whatever I'm given lmfao.
---
Oh man, I am a warrior on sulfuras and 100% did this to a hunter repeatedly this weekend, usually with another random warrior haha. He eventually left. So satisfying smoking a 39 huntard on a 30 warrior, even if there were two of us üòÜ

As a 15 year veteran, it's something I only found out recently! Good old WoW.

New Dell G3 15. Can get it with a 9th gen i7, 512 GB SSD and nvidia 1660 Ti for $1000 when it goes on sale (once a month-ish). 
---
Runs WoW Classic at 10/10.
---
You sound fun.
---
Honestly, mark the softest target Skull. Hit it with your opening sunder then ignore it. Establish threat on all other mobs and come back to the primary target. It will either just starting to wander off or so close to death it won't matter. Let the dps have their way with it while you gather up the rest of the pull.
---
Without SP/+healing, downranking **never** makes sense. Even in the situations you describe, the lower rank heal is always less efficient than your provided max-rank *faster* heal.
---
For shamans, at level 60, with zero SP/+healing, your max rank Healing Wave costs 620 mana for 1850 health for an efficiency of \~3:1 health to mana. To downrank far enough to be able to cast it with 400 (keeping with your 2/3s example) you'd use Healing Wage rank 7, 340 mana for 874 health for a \~2.5:1 efficiency, with the same cast speed. To get a faster cast heal of the same spell, you have to go all the way down to rank 3 (which only heals for 163, AND still takes 2.5 seconds to cast.
---
If you would instead, just use your *faster heal* Lesser Healing Wave, 380 mana for 928 health at a 2.44:1 efficiency, and it only takes 1.5 seconds to cast. 
---
It really is a settled science. Until you have more spell power/healing, you ***should*** use different heals, not lower ranked heals. Yes, an argument could certainly be made that the tank just needed 50 more hp and you could've done it with a rank 1 heal, but it's still not what you should do.
---
The same goes for priests and pallies.
---
In vanilla I tanked ubrs with my enh shammy, unstoppable Force mace with wf and full black dragonscale armor. It was fun.
---
You won't be having mana issues at lvl 60 pvp with shadowpriest except against warlock and paladin. In a 1v1 situation either you kill him with 20% mana remaining or you died before you can even use 50% of your mana. You will wreck mage, hunter, druid, shaman. You will run out of mana against warlock and paladin. You will die against warrior and roque of equal gear level.
---
From what I can see it's PoM frost hybrid.  As for specifics ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Not only is it viable to level as holy or disc (with wand spec and spirit tap), but leveling as holy is actually superior to shadow before unlocking shadowform. Go nuts!

Oh he's definitely a dick.

At one point you'd get an HK for killing them.
---
If you are on blaumeux i do that all the time. I'm a rogue so I love jumping out of stealth to kill something about to take them down. Then I give and bow and disappear back into my shadows. I only kill horde that are ganking. The hard part is figuring out who started the fight. I play pvp because I like that there's that tension but I only grief those that pick on lowbies. I catch you killing someone 10 levels lower than you Im devoting the next 30 mins to making sure you remember my name. Skulk on the alliance btw. Toss my a wave or point at something you need help killing if you see me nearby.

STV is always horde dominate. The servers balance is healthy.

yeah but does it work with classic...Working with vanilla is not the same as working with classic.
---
Sure, everyone's BiS comes from irritating places, but that doesn't mean they're "gear dependent". "Gear dependent" implies they scale dramatically with gear quality, and that's Warriors and Rogues. Bears actually perform very well even in shit greens while leveling, due to how forms work, and remain the best tanks straight through a chunk of Molten Core as a result while the Warriors gear up. BWL and AQ20-40 gearing are the pain spot for Bears since the former raid has so much junk/non-upgrades for them.
---
In terms of pre-raid/MC BiS gearing they're probably the easiest spec to gear up in the game.
---
Dumbest thing aside from being able to disenchant in animal form but not eat meat.
---
Obvious troll but apparently got some bites anyway, hence the 2.
---
The book was [added in patch 1.10](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.10.0#Professions), without any details about the location. I think it took people a day or two to find it and it never really hit the mainstream.
---
Takes me 1h to drive home lol..
---
Tailoring is needed for some pre-BiS gear
---
I think It would be on the loot table at .01%. Not bad for a spriest. God tier for a warlock.
---
Renew is super inefficient for your mana pool. It can be useful if you need to be moving or there's consistent AoE hitting the DPS but it's generally not worth to be throwing out constantly when you have time to cast more efficient heals.
---
I'm sorry.
---
Classic sword and board tanking does work it's just 15 years down the road players have been rewarded with instant gratification for so long that they don't want to play that way.  Players want go go go and day 5 Rag kills.
---
Yeah but some of those green quests are chains and lead into yellow, orange, and red.
---
Depends on your class.
---
Hint: they're not talking about a staff.
---
Completely agree! Back in the day my fps was so shit I just couldn't really dps properly, or tank, so always ended up healing, but I liked the feeling of being more special in a group haha, and normally mained tank/healer toons. Never a warrior though, and it's just painful atm.
---
Are you pst? I‚Äôm cst and I would get on about 7pm server time and that‚Äôs were the que was
---
I completely agree, a 10,000 quest limit would be just fine.
---
You'll spend way more money on food and bandages than you will on demo shout and thunder clap. Which you'll have to buy anyways at 60.
---
I remember back in wrath my friends and I were all in the top 5 most geared people in our classes. We got bored of raiding and started doing world pvp. Camping the tarren mill roof was fun, but for boring. Moved onto summoning raids into the ring above UC with a lot of casters. 
---
Then we discovered the new meta. Why grief the horde when we could grief our own faction. 
---
One of our friends was a horde pally so we had him run into SW and kill the auctioneers solo until people got fed up with it. 
---
When he got low we'd get off a cluch MC and then throw on druid hots, earth shield and riptide, a pally's whatever little bubble that gave a hot from flash of light, and then the disc priest would bubble. 
---
He would tank the whole goddamn town until he got to the flight master where he'd do the oldest trick in the book. Make everyone think he was jumping off and send a wave of idiots into the moat. We got so much shit because we did it almost daily, but it was worth it.
---
I don't share the same experience at all, STV on my layers are Alliance heavy. Also dying 10 times is to be expected playing on a PVP server..you might want to reroll on a normal server if its ruining your experience this badly.
---
Is it though? 18 paragraphs of dick jokes just because "mages use staffs"?
---
Completely agree!
---
Retail isn't classic, they've said repeatedly that there will not be any microtransactions.
---
Plus, that would literally only make the problem worse? Alliance will just flee the server while more horde pile on. That doesn't help anything except lets people leave, screwing over the alliance who want to stay.
---
Mine wasn't working at first either for some reason. Might require an update or restart. If you're managing your add-ons through the twitch client it can auto update for you (highly recommend, I don't even use twitch otherwise)
---
Back in the day when I was leveling my Rogue and Hunter, it was 100% red is dead, as long as I had a reasonable chance.  Didn't care how much I outleveled them by.
---
Now I'm leveling a Warrior.  I will happily join in-progress fights, but for now I'm trying to focus on leveling and Warriors have a hard enough time dealing with equal level mobs.  It's not the ideal world PvP class, so I mostly keep my head down.
---
But next I'm leveling a Hunter or Mage or Lock or Rogue, and it's going to be 100% back to red=dead.
---
How does this work on barren chat? When I got to the Gallery thing it just seems to be stuff people have uploaded. Where do I find pic of the week for previous weeks etc?
---
Are you alliance? Because you're lying if you're horde
---
1. Getting mind controlled is not something I can control.
---
2. I enjoy the aesthetics, play style and class fantasy of ret, and I try my best to optimize it in raids. It‚Äôs actually fine dps if played properly and with correct consumable use, though still not top tier. It also bring utility rogues, warriors and mages don‚Äôt. If you have any other retarded comments to make please submit them to nobody, we don‚Äôt care.
---
3. I‚Äôm not mad at the game, I‚Äôm mad at idiots who think it‚Äôs funny to waste peoples time and resources. Which is a valid reason to be mad. If you think it‚Äôs not then you can kindly fuck off.
---
Roll on a pve server next time?
---
Don't delete the item if you want it or you're actively doing the quest, problem solved. "I accidentally deleted the item I needed" is a PEBKAC issue, not something Blizzard should have to fix. It even warns you in a dialog box before it abandons the quest. If you still delete it at that point, you pay the idiot tax and pick up the quest again.
---
Yeah so could he is the problem you don't quite get.
---
Right! I purposely shrunk viewable area and was a hot mess.
---
I've cleaned things up and learned not to click spells. ü§£
---
Not OP but I strafe using 2 and 3. Q-R,A-F and Z-V are all bound to spells.
---
I'll add that it's especially bad now given how most players are spread across only a few zones due to the newness of the game. I played vanilla on a server back in the day that was a solid 70/30 split, me being on the low side. It really isn't that bad once the population levels out and the player base is spread across the entire world instead of just the first few starting zones.
---
In fact, I kind of liked being the underdog race. My friends and I would get a lot more potential for world PvP that way. Occasionally you'll get unlucky and just get swarmed. But, for the most part, once the population spreads, it won't be that bad.
---
TIL. Thanks!
---
Not only are you a traitor to your faction you're a traitor to the priesthood!
---
I moved lol
---
Honestly, I respect and appreciate everyone's advice - but I'm inclined to take yours above the others. Additionally, I *loathe* Durotar's starting area and quest mapping. I'll opt for UD, if I tilt in that direction.
---
As for Alliance, that definitely does make sense. I've often wondered why Human isn't considered the meta because of the spirit buff stacking with the Disc and Holy talents, but hey - I've literally never leveled the class beyond 20.
---
its a super rare drop, i think less than 1%, I think i remember it dropping one top in actual vanilla
---
So?
---
DBM fixes that.
---
You did it Timothyüëå
---
I would not say it‚Äôs ‚Äúrarely used‚Äù. There are many mobs you fight where sunder armor is literally useless. OPs posts seems to imply that sunder armor will always increase your dps which is simply not true
---
!remindme 24 hours
---
post proof
---
Mortalstrike, orc warrior on blaumeux.
---
Druids should never main tank in raids as they can't become immune to critical strikes like warriors can. Meaning a druid could easily be 1 or 2 shot by a raid boss.
---
But they're great off tanks that bring a ton of utility to a raid group.
---
And cats are fine dps in pve just dont expect to be topping the charts.
---
well then yer fucked bud sorry about it
---
As undead, I intend on using cannibalize and bandages to heal myself and I don't ever need to drink. Don't really expect heals, I'll be lifetapping.
---
Nah, Kazzak literally cause servers to crash and have to be restarted. Eff that.
---
I was in stv and I, a benevolent god druid, allowed an alliance rogue to exist near me.  This kid tags a mob I'm running at like I'm not going to straight fuck him up for it so I pounced rake rip cast abolish right as the blind hits go bear bash him and let the mob durahit him. 
---
If the severs were less saturated I'd kill every alliance on sight buy as it is I'd literally never complete any quests if did that so I just kill the ones that piss me off.
---
once you take out all the enemies priests, that's when the tide turns. If they can't rez and heal, they can't sustain.
---
Also bring back that sweet cartoon section
---
Training DW is a dps loss for rogues before level 20, at least.  Either for precision or for poisons.
---

Which is hilarious because RP communities are just if not more immature than most other communities. Moongard Goldshire anyone?

I‚Äôm a pussy loser considering the switch just because playing alliance on stalagg (apparently not even the worse AH ratio) simply isn‚Äôt fun more often than it is fun.
---
So it's five seconds faster. Wow, big deal. Layers are going away and they've already put in increasing cooldowns on layer switches
---
I had a mage get mad at me at the exact same spot, when i said i was questing he said "im aoe farming watch", i dont think they even understand whats going on around them
---
You put it on the lock when their hp is full and they life tap.  Often when running to the next pull
---
Sorry you don't have a sense of humor?
---
congratulations on talking to a female, I'm not sure why you feel the need to tell a classic wow subreddit though
---
Catherine, Cat for short. Maybe you like. Fun story about how you cant decide yet, I like how important it is to you.
---
Kazzak's leash was confirmed intentional, he's not even in the game yet and they talked about it. It's a consequence of one of the things they absolutely won't be changing - less GM staff is available to resolve issues.
---
The infernal may well be bugged though.
---
Soul Shards FOR SURE are the worse thing about  Locks. That and our DMG in the first few raids are suspect at best. But think Locks are way cooler. The pets are amazing with utility brought to groups. There‚Äôs a Curse for every situation. So many gold farming options. I don‚Äôt know how many times my Healthstone and Soulstone saved me.  Being able to manhandle in almost all 1v1‚Äôs against other classes is gorgeous and of course literally stealing the life force of things for yourself is too dope.
---
I generally won't attack someone who is in a position where if I were attacked, I'd feel like they were an asshole. For example, if someone is level 20 in a level 20 zone and I'm level 50, I won't attack. That's just a dick move.
---
But if they're level 20 and in a level 40 zone, and I'm level 40, I'll attack. They knew the risks when they came in the zone.
---
If I see someone at 10% HP fighting 3 mobs, I'll attack. Some might think that's a dick move, but if it were me, I'd consider it my own fool fault for putting myself in a bad position on a pvp server.
---
I try not to attack/kill an enemy more than twice. For me the whole point is just to prove who is the stronger fighter. After I've won a couple times, I've proved the point and we can all move on.
---
That's a good point, thanks. Either way since it's comparative, with enough volume you should be able to pick up a difference in the averages.
---
Spent all my gold on this stupid sword. I was a fury warrior and while it was a sword....it had other stats I didnt need.
---
Was some blue see through sword (one handed) and oddly shaped. Hard to recall, kinda curved, again it had a unique shape.
---
disappointed there's not a screenshot of it in use
---
You reachin rly hrd for that one.
---
Well I actively avoid 'rush' 'cleave' etc groups purposely for this reason, but if you are forcing groups to go fast to have your 'fun' at the expense of theirs, that's kinda shitty.
---
Good advice for competent groups, but while the playerbase is on the whole better than they were in 2005, most pugs I run with are still too incompetent for most of this.
---
People only went fury on private servers because you could use /sit to proc enrage

all of my dungeons were with randoms too lol , up until i got guild
---
Back in year 1 of WoW the boats actually didn't have sails for the longest time.
---
Epics like this if I recall had a really low drop rates (like, less than 2%). Most people will never get this to stop unless they dedicate a lot of runs to it.
---
If only you have some sort of leverage, maybe he would have made an exception.
---
Your only options are to either grind or run instances at this point, unfortunately you're pretty much out of quests at your level.
---
If I run out of quests, I usually grind Hearthglen 59-60, it isnt fast but the mobs spawn fast and are decently closely grouped together.  Also, you'll end up with a ton of runecloth when it's all said and done.  But just about any group of monsters you can kill fast and arent running super far away for each pull is the best way to do it.
---
Only reason I have it is for wow addons. Web interface is much better for twitch.
---
I realize this is going to sound like I'm being sarcastic, but I'm not.
---
So what you're saying is that it could just be in my head? Because it absolutely *feels* like there's substantially more sustain working lower ranked spells into the rotation.
---
The thing I like best about classic is that it'll never change into the weak watered down game your requesting.

Naw.  We had to deal with the 'this is going to fail, no market for wow classic, wow classic was bad' for years.  From retail nerds to Blizzard we were told we were idiots and it was all nostalgia and that the game was bad, that retail improved on everything, that we were wrong for not liking it as opposed to not liking it because the game is fundamentally flawed.  We got shit on forever so if they want to come into our capital city they're gonna get ganked.
---
My eyes have been opened!

In MC, BWL and anything with dragons, they usually fear. If your tank is bad and got feared while in prot mode then your 40 man raid will wipe. Good tanks switch to zerker to anticipate the fear and rage out of it. But being in zerker rage you risk of getting 2 shotted by the boss even with fully decked out gear. So then comes fear ward, now the tank can just stay in prot mode and spam sunder armor making it practically a brain dead job. The priest anticipate the fear and place the fear ward on the tank. High end raiding guild exclusively recruit dwarf priest only for this reason because your healing is not better than healadin or resto druid.

Mana break

Mines going to 35 for 300 professions. An extra Arcanite bar / Mooncloth every 3 days. Pretty much gunna level on rested exp only
---
Leveling up I'm seeing people specifically looking for a 2handed arms tank. I think they are doing the melee cleave farm or whatever. All I know is pop sweeping strikes go into defensive stance and spam cleave, threats easy and damage is usually #1 or #2 on the meter!
---
I lose 80% equity because when I open the chest, I have 100% of the items.  The goal of running instances is to gain experience, loot, and money.  Not friends. I'm willing to be generous if my team mates are.  You've admitted that the rogue should be tipped.  I've yet to have a single person offer a tip in over 15 SM runs.  I'm tired of getting stiffed and kicked from a group for bringing it up, and I'm tired of people just rolling on chests without even considering who's opening it.  I don't *want* to ninja loot the boxes, but I have no problem doing so if nobody wants to reciprocate generosity and I'm not willing to risk getting booted midway through a run, which has happened more often than I've been tipped.

Does anyone know what the lv 50 warrior quest is?
---
&gt;If you figure out something Blizz could do, let them know; no one has figured out how to fix faction imbalances in the past 15 years.
---
Give free faction transfers for realms with a larger alliance population.
---
&gt; no one has figured out how to fix faction imbalances in the past 15 years.
---
Faction balance doesn't really get destroyed until TBC tho (where horde is the objectively superior faction). Removal of faction unique utilities (paly for alliance, sham for horde), removal of geographical advantages (alliance supremacy on EK and Horde Kalimdor), introduction of flying mounts and both factions are crushed together on a tiny continent which means that the factions doesn't have their own zone superiority (like in vanilla its easier for alliance to contest eastern kingdoms because they have better reach). Which means that whatever faction is more popular will always outnumber the other faction in every zone with their flying mounts which makes the game annoying as fuck to play, especally when there is only a few dedicated farming spots which are also impossible to hold as the smaller faction.
---
Vanilla works really well with a ~50-50 ish ratio, due to the vast spaces, long travel time and their own continents (one thing BFA did right imo), and a lot of the servers have really good balance.
---
The worst I've seen are like 40/60 A/H ish, but its nowhere near standard 80/20 of TBC.
---
I use the twitch addons downloader, it's a classic version as far as I know.
---
whatever you say, bub.
---
I saw it once in 2005 on my mage; I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs in the game, it just has a vanishingly small chance to drop.
---
59 horde here and im having a blast. Farmed Rend in ubrs last night with guildies. Such a blast!
---
I appreciate a dick joke like anyone else. When its not 18 paragraphs long and when its in an applicable subreddit.

This is actually a very rare pet that I know is BA.

---
life-tapping to drain life is dumb enough on it's own, doing it when your group is already waiting for the healer to drink is even worse.
---
Elites don't seem to hit as hard as the following expansions though
---
Thanks, i know it's a very rare drop, I'm willing to do the Grind, I just need confirmation that in the Current Classic WoW that it's dropping for people
---
As a follow up to my last question I wanted to ask if there are any specific macros i should consider using to make life a bit easier while leveling as a healer
---
I was a horde warrior in this fight (under the same name) and can confirm - it was glorious. All of us were between 30-40 and couldn't handle the guards at darkshire, so we regrouped at the fork in the road as the Alliance group started to match our raid size.   
---
\- "...we all ran from Darkshire to the Stranglethorn fork in the road, as a pack, as ONE. NO horde. It felt like a trap."-
---
That's because it was a trap! We were getting ready for another attack when some stragglers behind us called out the 30+ alliance incoming (which was a surprise). So on either side of the road behind the trees we hid 10+ people stacked out of sight with \~10 in the middle serving as bait. Possibly the coolest thing about open world PvP is the opportunity to devise this type of real time battlefield strategy and utilizing flanking maneuvers and the element of surprise as actual advantages.   
---
And as a warrior there is no feeling like charging ahead, taking out a couple casters immediately, and watching alliance scum collectively shit their pants and run in terror as more warriors charge in and rogues / druids emerge from the shadows and decimate the flanks. However I will say we did underestimate the Alliance, we had lost too many of our group to infighting at that point and it felt like maybe a full minute after what we thought was sweet, sweet victory, the alliance regrouped and kicked our asses. Still, this was so much fun and reminds me of just why Wow classic is still my favorite MMO of all time. 
---
FOR THE HORDE
---
I mean, he could be dead
---
I just got my green tinted goggles last night! I can‚Äôt believe how much fun I had just running from AH to engineering trainer to mailbox and back again. 
---
I love this game!
---
Please tell me you're on Deviate Delight. Doesn't matter the faction, I'll come show you how it's done. One you'll take a knee, the other you'll take a dirt nap.
---
We really don't want to, it's just kind of our nature to be right in the middle of everything and sometimes that includes respawns.
---
Pedantry for the sake of excusing a mistake that you and everyone else knows is a mistake, is the worst kind of pedantry.
---
Uld is great for warriors.
---
The professional would have pretended to not have lock pick trained and come back after everyone else left the group.
---
I just set my skada up to make a sound when my mb will take agro. Its going to be a fun one. Homer simpson yelling at me
---
The XP you get as a reward does not change when it becomes green.  No reason not to do them
---
It's to prevent shit posts like this
---
Hey, I can do you one better. What if instead of increasing the numbers... We just *hide* the number? That should work
---
Oh, that sounds like something I'd want. I googled it and I saw a few forums about the build but can't see a talent tree build to follow for it... do you happen to know where I can find it?
---
&gt;So aside from everyone's spoiled whining 
---
...sigh.
---
Cool. Heard anything from Blizzard yet? I haven't.
---
Dueling a druid as soon as the zepp leaves, fearing him as I win pushes him to the edge, poor guy walks right off the edge and dies, funniest and saddest thing I've done.
---
My first WOW experience, started a few days ago, watched a few vids on tanking WC and went for it.  First group was hunter and rogue for DPS that basically melee'd everything the second i pulled.  Team was shredded 3x.
---
Second group I straight up asked if everyone knew how threat worked, they said  yes, so I went.  Was great.  They let me corner pull, attacked my skull targets, sheeped the extra mobs that patrolled in or went towards the party, finished WC in very fast time with no deaths, best experience.
---
Pls let your tank tank!!!
---
From the 3 choices, I'd go for Warlock. I love seeing stuff go down with DoTs and a pet is lovely :).
---
That‚Äôs weird I‚Äôm on bigglesworth and the longest queue I‚Äôve seen in the last week is like 1900 and the estimate was only like 22 mins.
---
yeah also when I invite people to my house I have to tell them to not steal stuff lying around
---
Heres an old vanilla saying for you: "Want some bread with that whine?"
---
I'm glad I wasn't crazy because Earthbound Kiting was not efficient for me. Seems like Melee swings from enemy's have a much larger range than pservers.
---
Only reason a hunter needs a melee weapon is purely stats. So agi etc. In this case, Ravager has no stats. You know now.
---
tirion fordring.
---
Priest, shadow
---
I‚Äôm sure the teacher loved the music selection while this blasted in class
---
Is there one of these for hunter?
---
\+Hit is a rare commodity for warlocks, so this staff will lat a lot longer than one might think.
---
Im so excited to do it.
---
I think you might be missing our point haha.
---
Why the warlock?  You dont need eye to pull.
---
And the spring peepers and tree frogs come out at night.
---
This is awesome. I dig this. And I agree, that versatility is excellent. In my head it would be super cool if say a Druid‚Äôs stats at the end of the raid weren‚Äôt necessarily top damage, top healing, top damage taken, but maybe they had 550k healing and 550k damage where the Mage had 1mil damage, making the Druid a bit more valuable because he played the right roles. Or something. Love this perspective baphtt!
---
Fuck that finally makes sense to me.
---
I always wondered why low ranks were more mana efficient, when pretty clearly their mana/health ratio wasn't really any better.
---
But +healing gear makes complete sense.
---
So it's not really worth it until you start getting higher level gear.
---
They form instantly
---
A day hasn't gone by where I'm not hounded by invites that expire a moment after they're sent
---
60k xp/hr and ludicrous gold drops is a solid way to level up
---
The grind gets old though
---
I limit ZF to 3 or 4 clears then call a break
---
I don‚Äôt know about that most people who committed agreed that it should not be in the, so saying that a majority of players agree is not true at all. It‚Äôs p2w and I would be surprised if anyone wants that unless they are multi boxers
---
Ahh the mount of fun to be had with that when it crits!
---
What the actual Fuck! i just got my lock to 40 and NOW you tell me!?!
---
I think the chest was locked and a rogue opened it.
---
I think the WoW community has mixed opinions regarding locked chests.
---
Some people thing everyone should roll and the rogue should open it for the winner regardless of the fact that the group wouldn't have had the chest if not for the rogue.
---
Other people think it's completely up to the right whether he takes the loot or let's people roll for it.
---
I play rogue and usually do exactly what this guy did and wait to see if anyone notices/wants to roll for it. If no one says anything then I'll open it and keep the loot
---
Yes, I can justify it.
---
It was in vanilla, so it should be in Classic. Period.
---
It‚Äôll cost the same regardless of level. But the cost to respec goes up incrementally each time you change spec. (1g, 5g.... up to a max of 50g)
---
If you're not an enchanter sell it; if you are, use it.
---
If the stats are good and it's a big upgrade, just roll need. Nothing at that level is super rare, people cry about it but really they can just run it again.
---
I've always read from the guides that Gnomish is for PvE and goblin is for PvP.
---
I've got like 4-5 chat windows, you can customize your UI however you want.
---
I dunno man but his days are limited
---
I know its been said over and over but. I'm really loving the community aspect of this game. Last night I was killing some orcs in redridge and this mage comes by and helps me kill one. Then I see him off to the side killing some himself. I offer to group and we smash through the quest. Noticing we have another quest in commom we continue our little journey and find much higher level mobs that we have to carefully pull 1 by 1. We then came across a druid and rogue that we're doing the same quest as us. (Rogue was a much higher level). So we chat with them and end up all partying together to smash through huge groups of these mobs and finish our quests.
---
I dont think I EVER did this when playing retail and it is something I never knew I needed when llaying WoW.
---
Ya last night was 926 and said 36min. Now I didn‚Äôt wait for it to see how fast it was
---
Lore-wise, the answer is - and always has been - Warlocks, absolutely. Or at least, Warlocks have the *potential* to be the most powerful. Warlocks can cast some of the craziest spells imaginable, but it consumes their life force to do so - so a Warlock could cast a single spell more powerful than anything an individual Mage could ever manage, and shave 40 years off their life expectancy while doing it. It's why Warlocks have so much flavour revolving around draining life from an enemy - they need to regain the life force they spend on their magic.
---
Notably, Medivh was a mage, and probably the most powerful individual in the setting aside from Sargeras himself (despite, you know, effectively *being* Sargeras), but the Guardian of Tirisfal is a very special case. It's also questionable whether he counted as Mage or a Warlock as Sargeras' influence over him grew - or if he simply transcends class definitions altogether.
---
So was a decision made? I‚Äôm on bigglesworth, and while it feels a little horde heavy in STV, I think it may just be because horde have more quests in Zul‚Äôkunda. If it is horde heavy it‚Äôs likely not more than 60-40. I haven‚Äôt run into a queue in a while either, but I‚Äôm usually on by 4-5 central time.
---
Yesss I can't wait!
---
Oh wow this is great, thank you so much!
---
We definitely had excel in 2004 lol
---
Shaman definitely needed it more as that specific weapon has a chance on hit to do damage to all enemies around you. I'm assuming that shaman was enhancement which is their melee spec, he would get way more value out of it than you would as a hunter.
---
But dont feel that bad. It's not the most powerful or rarest thing in the game. He'll probably have his own by tomorrow.
---
Some people are rude. You should feel free to remove them for wasting your time
---
He is not doing to for quests he is just killing mobs. So you level way faster and get more gold as well
---
Yeah, you are right. I meant server transfer. And yes, that will be available on classic, so if Blizzard gives some out for free to keep the servers balanced I wouldn't mind.
---
Yeah, it goes against the spirit of vanilla of building a reputation around your character etc, but I think its still a good option.
---
There will be plenty of time for PvP when the honor system is released.  Unless horde are stealing your mobs/nodes, I consider it a waste of time.
---
It's 3:00 pm EST.   Please tell me this issue is resolved????
---
Warlock, loving it.
---
I didn‚Äôt know they existed at the time since no local stores used to sell them at the time. Back then my area had a very small market for pc gaming so most game stores catered to consoles. 
---
When I went abroad for college in 2009, I discovered the time cards at a gamestop and bought a battle chest instantly XD
---
Thank you for the advice! I really appreciate it. Seems I'll stick to what I have and respec once I hit 60. 
---
Is the first build good enough for leveling to 60, or is there a better one?
---
To answer your first question, that‚Äôs your call dude.
---
Do you want to trade killing things solo efficiently for more effective healing? If the answer is yes, then respecing would be the way to go.
---
I mean... The username checks out.
---
Man... lot of misinformation here.
---
You should 100% be dancing while you tank. If you're not using tact mastery and changing stances. You. Are. Wrong.
---
Not possible because this is handled by the server and not the client. The world environment is not the same as the mobs/entities that spawn on the land. They are treated differently because mobs are controlled by the server; position, movement, actions, etc. In order to optimize server stability and allow so many players onto the layer at once, they intentionally reduce the distance at which server updates are sent to the player. The higher the distance, the more bandwidth is used up because the server updates to players are bigger. I agree it‚Äôs extremely annoying and I really hope they increase it later down the line.
---
Thank you!!!!!!!
---
I mean both at the same time is fine as long as I get to play. Hahaha just kidding. But.. not...
---
Opposite for me. After playing WoW I used QE strafe in all FPS now.
---
It's a rogue, no mats required
---
For the most part, Lightwell is kind of entirely useless. It's not theoretically terrible, but it forces weird positioning for either you or the players healing from it, which usually just results in a dps loss. Spirit of Redemption is fine if you have the spare talent point (which you will), but personally I don't like going into a raid or dungeon with the predetermined mindset of "I'm going to die." A lot of the time, a random point in Spell Warding or something else feels better.
---
&gt; Fishing? Really? An adventurer of your talents?
---
&gt; It's a peaceful life.
---
I don't think they used special characters to get past the filter, the basic Cleavage was probably taken. I've seen 2 Cleavage with alt-codes on my server.
---
Yeah you probably should have let the shaman have it, id be pretty salty if I was that shaman losing the need roll to a hunter..
---
It‚Äôs funny I don‚Äôt remember that being a thing until around cata, maybe I just didn‚Äôt notice it before
---
Let me reiterate, if there are no wipes or death just low mana at the end of a fight, da fuc is there to bitch about? Being a skilled player shouldn‚Äôt be bashed for doing a good job just because it made it a challenge.  Most people start bitching when the game becomes challenging at that just plain sad. Point being people should stfu and just play the damn game. You people obviously didn‚Äôt play vanilla or much of it if you think rushing through dungeons is some new profound technique.
---
I support this mentality 100%.
---
Props to shaman tanking - might give that a go instead so it's just 'tank of last resort'.
---
Kirtonos is yikes. 2/3 in horde favor
---
I played vanilla thru wrath hardcore in high school but I had to constantly sit out the game weeks at a time to focus on school. It‚Äôs why I never was in a serious raiding guild in bc, why I never cleared bwl in vanilla , etc. I‚Äôm 30 now, career and make a great living. I graduated college almost 7 years ago now and I can finally play this game the way I‚Äôve always wanted to. So thankful to blizzard. 
---
When I was a teenager I knew that not focusing on school would mean that I wouldn‚Äôt be an adult with solid free time for leisure. Best decision I ever made that paid off with classic.
---
God I remember that, was some good fun back in the day! Full buffs onehit warrior squad. &lt;3
---
you trust reddit comments more than atlasloot?
---
.... Okay. Continue to be ignorant and play your class like a brain dead vegetable.
---
The math is right. .
---
Noone is saying sunder til mob dead. Its pull w 50 rage, instant three sunder, if mob goes below 50% hp cause of crit, dont sunder anymore, kill and pool rage. Next mob, instant sunders for overpower procs again, repeat.
---
In first 3.5 seconds I get a white hit and 2.5 sunders. You get a single heroic strike that doesnt even gen rage. Its pretty obvious what is better.
---
A stack is easily enough.  As a warlock, the stuff 1 rank down is pretty good too, since it's what I use in the wild.  I'll just life tap to half/half and eat/drink that way.  Though personally my life drain is net positive so I can actually sustain indefinitely just life tapping and draining.
---
You almost lost at the end of ShB, if was not by the power of PLOT DEVICE!
---
Jokerd has entered the chat
---
well hopefully some dedicated pvpers pay you a visit  in the near future and see how ya feel homie
---
Probably not since I've been leveling mostly solo with the exception of a few quests and other things here and there.... will stick to the first one until I hit 60 I think. Thank you for all of your help, I really appreciate it
---
could you guys tell me what you're gonna be mad about after layering is gone? I wanna get a jump start on the karma farming
---
Hey buddy. Maybe look at the actual damage numbers when you sunder mobs and you will see what I am talking about
---
It doesn't have too tho
---
lmao this is how fake news spreads
---
Are there any other ghostly pet?

I. Am. New. Thanks for the advice though!

Ninja..ninja RAP!
---
The tank level on the chart is 3 below the last boss so the tank can actually connect hits with the boss and hold threat. If your dps is -3 and the tank is -5, the tank has 0 chance of holding threat and may as well go battle stance with a 2h.
---
Prat.
---
I mean I don't think I was an ass about it, I asked if he would roll for it. We did and when he lost he just left
---
If the mobs are grey and you get no XP from killing them it's not worth the effort unless it's something you can do while doing a yellow quest or with minimal effort.
---
You are right, it's lvl 60 gameplay. It's all from when arena had just opened as trial. Got some footage from during arena as well if anyone is interested. (Even double warrior around 2400 rating)
---
congrats, you officially play a hunter now.

Point 5 is probably the most important, yes :D

cheer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

INTRUDER ALERT! INTRUDER ALERT!

And in TBC and after that experience would have been get ganked by 20-30 horde, mount a defense of 35 alliance, Horde all mounts and flies into the air out of reach until interest wanes, then descending on stragglers and solo players as they disperse and repeat. Zzzzzx
---
Lel
---
Hunter
---
Depends on your perspective.
---
This is from my perspective. I had tagged the mob, the guy who won the roll didn't.  
---
I gave more context in the comments. :)
---
Very treasureable
---
I was lvl 16 in Tb with no shoulders.
---
A random lvl 17 orc runs up to me, opens trade, gives me some grey shoulders and, runs away saying "loktar ogar, brother."
---
This would never happen in retail, this is why I love classic.
---
I'm ashamed to say I actually use these
---
IMO drop imp. nature's grasp for 5/5 HotW, not sure why people advise it? It isn't that good outside of PvP imo, especially since it can only be used outdoors. It's that or another 4% HotW buff, which seems pretty good.
---
What if the item was an item you could use and he couldn't even use it?
---
Currently at 37 in game and I've only seen it in general chat 1 time. No lie. 1 flippin time.
---
Were you able to do the escort quest at the end of the instance? I'd be very surprised if you managed it at level 16.

Princess must die is a really hard raiding dungeon man.
---
Idk I don't feel this picture illustrates effectively me dying 4 times, each times closer to the exit, before I give up and resurrect at grave yard and paying 60s to repair all my 0 durability gear
---
Correct, as long as they are not in combat they will look at the point on the ground where you cast distract (which is why I said to cast it behind them). It's really only useful to cancel an opener if say a mage is ganking you and you see it coming... or sometimes as a rogue you back out of a fight to fall out of combat and re stealth... those are your opportunities to use distract as a psuedo interrupt.
---
yes. i think that would help with the perception of imbalanced servers as well. if you can see there are more horde at say levels 30-35 compared to alliance but more alliance are 40-45, that could help people understand the statistics more. also would be cool to see those stats over time as a server matures.
---
maybe even a single chart that shows the gap between the 2 factions per level. there is a lot of ways you could display the data.
---
would be really cool to have a calculated numbers export. breakdown by faction, level, race, class as computed numbers. 
---
if you cant tell, i like data. it's fascinating to see what comes out of it.
---
Gnome is the absolute worst and I refuse to run it.
---
I have fond memories or running BRD but I haven't gotten there yet this time around.
---
I have a 22, a 16, and a 15. How would altoholics like me affect the statistics on these type of numbers?
---
This.
---
How the fuck have you managed to play classic wow without hearing that the game is soo fucking popular that every server is bursting at the seams with people
---
I'm just impressed holy shit
---
Hero. Thank you
---
Gandalf here to point out your missteps.
---
At the border guards, one of you should have pulled the guards and ran, allowing the rest to run through. He dies, runs back, then one of you on the Barrens side pulls and runs and the straggler then runs through. This runner dies, runs back from graveyard and you continue on your way.
---
At least, I think this works if it's two guards there. I don't remember how may are at that point for sure.
---
truth, having a bank alt can be a boost to just vendoring skins.
---
I don't agree that releasing a high level enemy in a 5-10 zone to prevent players of your own faction from completing quests and using NPCs is PvP as intended.
---
how do you get to more than lvl 2 without noticing 200 ping
---
good to know now
---
Gee whiz thanks for pointing that out.
---
There weren't many people on at the hours I was playing. And Scholo/Strath were still pretty hard since everyone was undergeared, trying to get Tier 0.5 gear. DM &amp; Mara hadn't been released yet. BRD was all I could really get into, and only when my guild was running. PUGs weren't really a thing. 
---
This is fuzzy recollection from over a decade ago, btw. I just remember grinding the plaguelands begging to get in on Scholo/Strath runs.
---
I can't tell you how long we tried to get Lucifron down. Or god, trying to get through the trash on the way to Luci. Good lord we had no idea what we were doing.
---
You must be confused about something because there's nothing unoptimal with using AD to strafe and using QE for binds. Almost 99% of PVPers and Raiders use this and maybe unbind S so they can't back pedal. There's a reason almost every game in the world uses WASD for movement, FPS/MMO/Whatever.
---
And you don't lose your ability to use mouse, I'm not sure what that even means or how it's even possible.
---
A truly righteous man. I just wish any of the horde races had paladin in classic. I might end up switching to... *the Alliance*.

---

---
For launch I bought code red and Doritos. My god did I have the worst stomach ache of my life the next morning. I keep saying Classic should be easy this time around since I have a fully formed brain, but maybe that's not 100% true lol.
---
I don't mind the layout. Probably my favorite location in the game tbh. It is a pain to navigate, but it has a lot of character.
---
You downrank while leveling because often your big heals heal for a massive chunk of HP and it's not always safe nor necessary to let someone drop that low.
---
Often a lower rank is used not necessarily for mana conservation, but just to have a heal that heals for less available to you. It tends to work much better to have 3 different versions of heal/greater heal on your bar to be able to react to different healing situations.
---
That's bad but not THAT bad. I have e-friends who were at 5 days played when we were seven days in..... they're probably closer to 10-12 days /played out of 15 now....
---
I know right
---
Thanks? I know PvE isn‚Äôt as popular so I figured I‚Äôd ask. No need for the sarcasm.

LMAO literally the same way I got the FP too.

You go 5/5 if you are horde and skip grasp since you have stomp.

Missholyz is having the true no changes experience, back to age 17
---
This kid had to send me a message directly to make sure I came back to his ridiculous garbage.
---
What a clown.
---
I am on a pvp server and I'd say while there aren't as many cool people there still are a lot.
---
Huh, I remember Destiny and Destiny 2 referring to you as the 'guardian', and your character is involved in the cut scenes that change the world directly. Especially the beginning of Destiny 2 where your character is literally kicked back down to earth by the big-boss guy in the opening intro. Doesn't seem like a 'one of many' type of thing.
---
I do look at what happens though. Do you know how often I proc overpower after three sunders and just 1 shot the mob?
---
Yeah, the old feeling is back for me. It feels the same as when I played for the first time.
---
I always come back to wow and I'm thankful I have something I know I enjoy to return to.
---
The new expansions just keep letting me down.
---
I'm in the same situation and I've had to cut down my gaming because otherwise I simply wouldn't find a new job...
---
Except for Tranix the warrior on Herod, who killed me while fighting three raptors. It was fun camping him on my lunch break and he‚Äôs KOS from now on
---
I'ma be honest here.. as a tank, this is how I think in terms of pulls / MANAgement (heh, get it?).
---
1. How big is the next pull? 2-3 mobs is pretty easy. 4-5... better let everyone mana up fully. Do we need to CC?
---
2. Do I have classes besides the mage in my group that can do good dps without full mana, like hunters, rogues, warriors, feral druid, etc.? How quickly have we been burning stuff down? If the answer is "yes, we have those classes" and "killing stuff pretty fast", then...
---
3. What is my healers mana? How has he handled the pulls so far? Are we struggling? If I let him start drinking, how fast will my HP drop while he is drinking up full mana? If the healer is at 50% thats usually good enough to pull a small - medium sized pack.
---
Now that said, I've seen plenty of not just tanks, but all kinds of dps classes, that don't wait and don't watch for mana. My hunter friend is particularly bad about this because he got to 60 faster than all of us and thinks he's a god now (we were all 56-57 when he hit 60). In all fairness, his gorilla pet was a beast tank when he was 50 and we were in our 45-47s and farming ZG and then ST later. I had to constantly say "Mana" as a goddamn warrior to let him know that the healer was oom. 
---
Now that we're running end game dungeons (BRD, LBRS Strat, etc.), it's been a bit of an adjustment. I miss the 2h arms tanking of the late 30s - late 50s sometimes, holding threat by just doing way more dps. SS/WW + WF totem is a beautiful thing.
---
do you guys have any fun?
---
I think TB is ok (though I did have to pull up the map a lot at lower levels to get around), but UC is a a fucking cancerous maze.  Even during phase 6, I'll still be pulling up the map to find my way around that place.  UC also doesn't have a shaman trainer.  It's the worst.
---
That's why I dont mind tanking WC on my Balance druid. I can sleep CC the beast mobs.
---
I'm on the West Coast  playing on an East Coast server and my ping is about 50. The fuck is up with your ping? I'm not sure this is a problem switching servers will necessarily solve.
---
No, the ghostly cat in Darkshore is the only one.
---
The old dungeons are one of the best parts. It‚Äôs not just a linear kill machine to give you loot, it has a story and everything is there for a reason. The end game dungeons are huge, have a lot of extra things you can go out of the way to do and bosses that you would not usually find. Hell I remember spending 6 hours in BRD way back in the day and still not finishing it.
---
I think TBC did flying right because it was a big achievement.  60% move speed mount and training was like 1,000 gold
---
Been playing a holy Paladin since vanilla. This gave me a solid guffaw

---
To clarify, its 9% hit to hit cap your YELLOW hits (ability attacks), not auto attacks. Extra hit past that still helps, but isnt as critical as other stats like crit. As a human, your 5 weapon skill equates to ~3% hit, so you only need 6% extra hit to cap your yellow hits.
---
There's a whole web page on it: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
I called story Mr. salty, and seeing how that made you butt hurt I‚Äôm assuming I was right. My comment was a response to another in turn meaning to understand the full meaning you have to read the persons comment I respond to, which follows you missing the entire point because you focuses on one sentence I said. So uh yeah ‚Äúreal mature‚Äù on your part.
---
You must be getting flagged somehow. The opposite faction cannot attack you if you are not flagged for PvP.
---
Not really b/c they could just sit there and enchant their own gear over and over for free if they just wanted skill points...and it would be faster than handing out free enchants to people.
---
I may be wrong, but I think it takes 315 to get an extra 1% hit chance. 1-14 just gives more damage.
---
Thousand needles.
---
you seem a little tense to get worked up over this topic
---
I was about to say BRD is the worst, but your post made me re-think it and you're right.
---
I was initially just annoyed because I never finished BRD in vanilla. I tried to do it numerous times with groups, but after 6 or 7 hours people tend to get fed up and leave lol. I don't even know how long it's supposed to take, but every time I attempted, I was in there for around 7 hours and never finished.
---
I am determined to complete it in Classic.
---
well yeah by the time you apply three sunders the mob should be dead, maybe if you used heroic strike it would die faster instead
---
Thanks, I saw someone mention changes to mage in phase 2 about mana but I don‚Äôt see anything about mage changes at all. I saw all the other classes but mages.
---
This is my first time in classic. I first played thru here during WotLK but I sped thru with friends and never took the time to appreciate the lore. I'm loving the quests up there so far. Darkshore was great. Combining Ashenvale &amp; Stonetalon was a bit confusing, but I'm almost done there. I was thinking of moving on as the quests are green now, but if you recommend this one that strongly then I'll do it.
---
Do you think I could really get 200g for it?
---
weaponised autism
---
Wait, that's illegal.
---
mistyped, rend no benefit from sunder. Sunder still good
---
&gt; he had already equipped it. (he was a mage)
---
as a rogue... this hurts
---
If the game is only based on T sets then there would be no reason to quest and blizzard could just make raid after raid and dungeon after dungeon... then again.... why would people do that? why not just do Diablo or Path of Exile if that's your thing?
---
Seriously, put this with the post.
---
And nothing wrong into the game, yes you leaned the hard way, he baited you to roll on the item, just like you baited people on clicking this shit.
---
/thread
---
Downvoted for the clickbait, next time put the text with the image, stop being dramatic because you don't know how the system works.
---
I feel like I'm doing something wrong then. My drain life doesnt move my hp a damn bit and it certainly isnt producing in the damage department. I'm level 29 and constantly getting frustrated now because void has lost the ability to keep aggro after like 5 seconds and my damage seems lackluster compared to most other locks I see.
---
Not terribly hard considering they need 3 of you for dungeons. I tend to latch onto the first healer or tank I see in chat and not stress about running the dungeon right this minute. Bit once you get a healer or tank the hard parts over. Also it's a major help to actually be in the zone near the dungeon. I can. Guarantee groups will form and someone will drop out, and it's much preferred to pick up a dps who can run their in 5 minutes than spam lfg chat and have a guy in the other side of the world respond.
---
There was a melee hunter in my guild back in vanilla/BC days, and I can personally attest that taking him was actually worse than just having an empty slot. If I had it my way any melee hunter would just be for nightfall and would not get any loot whatsoever, and then they'd be put in a cage at the end of the raid.
---
Well, maybe it's a mindset you need to get into. I don't know what aspect of tanking is so difficult for you but aggro and the pace of the run are all external resources you need to manage much like Mana or incoming damage. I'd say if your aware enough to be a good healer that will translate well into becoming at the very least a passable tank.
---
IMO 99% of the nostalgia wore off after the 1st day, now its just glorious gameplay.
---
I'd disable the S mode feature btw
---
Very interesting! Didn't think about that
---
Leveling as disc, with 5 points in spirit tap.  Those 5 points are so well spent, it's crazy.  Shadow doesn't have that much until level 40, 45 if we are being honest with ourselves and not respeccing away from 5 points in Improved Wands.  Disc has so much more survivability and gives more room for errors in healing.  I'll need to make a decision at 40 of course but until Shadowform, leveling as shadow doesn't give substantially more damage due to the volume of wanding.

Basically
---
You probably already know this but using a leveling guide will probably help make it go faster if you decide to level on alliance! :D
---
I think Brazilians could move but they also might be more reluctant to move from their ‚Äúdesignated‚Äù BR server while others like you and me will be motivated to move. Also, If the server dies you can likely expect get moved/mergers  again for free. 
---
I know what you mean tho, I‚Äôm frustrated and I am not even to level 30 yet. But i have been annoyed with all my dungeon groups becoming a situation where I cannot understand anything my party is saying.
---
Ah ok cool. Unfortunately she's playing a warlock but i'm trying to get my first aid up as fast as possible.
---
Both recommendations I've seen in response to my comment start with "Be horde" haha, not gonna work for me :(
---
Kirintoris or whatever it‚Äôs called is the one I‚Äôm on, can barely go two feet outside the faction zones without some PvP going on and it‚Äôs usually floating at high pop so it‚Äôs full but no queues
---
Shut up nerd!
---
We lost a few brothers but that dirty dwarf was taken down.
---
Plus addons, and balancing are different too. Tons of helper mods compared to maybe one or two, compared to yesteryear. Balancing is the bigger change though, things are abit "easier" than in vanilla due to buffs certain classes have now compared to when most of the content was first released and balanced for.
---
No. He would have ice shards that looks like a pve build.
---
I say lack of resources since they had layoffs fairly recent iirc, and because they seem to not be able to keep a good stream of content for retail, so it would be hard to then to dedicate similar skills sets to a second game. I doubt they have that many overlapping positions, it would be wildly inefficient.
---
They could certainly afford it but the will has to be there and someone who has a strong vision of how to optimize classic but still maintain what makes it great.
---
Why does this not make the guards attack the priest?
---
We don't know his spec, but we can assume Disc -&gt; Shadow. If he specced holy for the +% Renew and the +% crit that changes the situation. I'm not a theory crafter and I'm just stating what I THINK is optimal, but you are correct.
---
"Most people aren't interested in RPing, and that's totally fine by me, it's quite niche - that's why there's so few RP/RP-PvP servers in the first place." yet you seem to be super butthurt that someones father decided to name their kid 'Bigboilol' - maybe thats a really obscure ethnic name. i mean there are professional ball players irl named cocopuff, should we yell at them for their name?
---
SULFURAS
---
I was so stoked when I got my defias mask on my rogue, free early headwear!
---
Oh yeah... it‚Äôs better on a pve server.
---
&gt; You get a major powerspike going from levels 30-40 ... When you hit 40 and get Mortal Strike you suddenly go from being an "ok" auto-attacker, to Hercules, Warrior Supreme.
---
This cannot be understated, if you have someone help you @ level 30 get WW axe, you will be a god for a while.
---
About level 44 it starts to level back out, WW Axe will still last into your low to mid 50s.
---
Same I'm leveling in duskwood kromcrush and decided to do homework and play the next morning
---
Too bad I missed this
---
Interesting, i've never heard that before. Cool idea.
---
I tried it for maybe the first 30 minutes a while ago, but couldn't really get into it. From what someone mentioned earlier it's mostly solo, and if I recall it wasn't open world either.
---
If you're talking about Neverwinter, that one you can solo most everything early on thus not a lot of community feel.
---
You killed it
---
Nah, he was a shaman; just had to use reincarnation.
---
nah, but it‚Äôs safe to assume there‚Äôs considerably more horde in any given realm
---
Damn at 36? How much gold you got left?
---
Pretty much this.
---
This guy fucking gets it. Ideally you get ahead of hte quests by 2-4 levels and then the mobs are easy to cleave down, which is FAR more efficient than single target killing with sunder or HS. Once you get SS you're golden. Never do quests that are = or higher than your level as a warrior. Too much time to kill enemies, too much downtime due to damage taken.
---
Agree and support. I‚Äôm a new player and have lots of questions and I don‚Äôt want to make a new post every time. Also commenting on questions threads get faster replies.
---
EU - Mirage Raceway
---
Sunder can be used in any stance?  I'll show myself the door lol
---
I carry a stack of food/water.  It's needed after dying in the world to some pvp, or after a particularly tough pull sometimes.  New HS, SS, summon, and demon armor is a lot of mana.
---
This guy didn't play at release on a high pop server lol
---
I agree with this and it tends to help avoid wipes and deaths in general when you keep people's health higher. If someone accidentally pulls extra mobs after you've already started a pack and you're busy letting the tank get super low so you can max rank that heal, he may die before you get the chance. Or if the tank makes a pull he thinks the group can handle and partway through the group isn't focus targeting and every mob is partially dead, the tank is going to be taking a ton of unplanned damage and you're going to wait to heal him sooner to deal with that. 
---
A good healer needs to be able to adjust to the situation. There are no hard and fast rules in healing. There are guidelines but the best healers know how to make decisions on the fly.
---
Was front page like ~~3 weeks~~ 15 years ago.
---
They didn't look high enough level for Vanish
---
Get a slow 2 hander and learn to hamstring kite. Mobs generally hit more frequently (2 sec swing timer), so this approach w/ hamstring greatly tips the scales in your favor.
---
it will definitely be more common than it was in vanilla
---
Bananas don't have a glans.
---
It‚Äôs not weird, almost all high level arena players have been doing this for years.
---
Reminds me that I haven‚Äôt run WC yet.
---
Yea of course comparison with FF wasn't fair. But I was just curious if the difference is negligible. If it's +1 damage to the next autos, then it's better to simply dump the rage for extra +20 damage of HS you know. But if it's +10 damage, then the benefit is obvious.
---
If the mob is red spam hamstring and strafe the fuck out.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/5022021305001-235050020300055 this one isn't a bad start, but there's plenty of room for other choices if you deem them necessary.  You could also go majority into Disc if you want, depends on who you play with and what your playstyle is.
---
The virgin screenshot vs the Chad phone pic
---
After 40 shadow is superior for leveling. Especially since you can still easily heal any dungeon.
---
Though you can comfortably level as disc or holy as well. Shadow is just more efficent.
---
this is just petty on both ends. drama over a purple shirt recipe really?????
---
That's crazy lol, which phase would that be in classic?
---
If one 12 second Pally bubble doesn't get me out, I'm getting naked and getting pounded to that spirit healer.
---
Exactly lol
---
Oh yeah, those games are great but not MMO so it's a bit of a different experience to me.
---
Macros can tell you which quests are completed or not.
---
&lt; Naga Stole My Bike &gt;
---
&lt; Snakes On A Zeppelin &gt;
---
I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of WoW classic players suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.
---
Damn that loot though
---
No Mage tables in classic, but as a mage I dont expect groupmates to tip because that's part of my dungeon responsibilities.  Now if a healer from another party wants water I expect a tip since I'm not running dungeons with them
---
This reminds me of Ultima Online... Love how your view is in a smaller window. With the ability to have your stuff in a border. I would maybe consider doing that today.
---
Thanks, good to know.
---
For a moment a read ambulance, and I was like "....what?"
---
Woke
---
Man I keep reading posts like these and wondering if I should reroll on a pvp server.
---
They're great fodder for easy blacksmithing levelling and the bonus is nice, so why would you be ashamed about that?
---
I've never heard of that one myself I might take a peak at it.
---
You're a monster!
---
I dunno I ran it three times with pugs with zero wipes.
---
Depends where you are... I encountered this issue in Hillsbrad at level 25 but that's it. Overall I agree with you but once you pass your current "choke point" it should be good.
---
At minimum I recommend binding /startattack instead of the usual toggle auto attack.
---
I could wait it out been playing Gears 5 lately and my childhood game Medievil Remake comes out next month should hold me over a bit. Planned on getting Borderlands 3 but not using Epic Game Store lol I'll wait the 6 months for it to be on Steam

Yea, a couple of Apes members stream.

My priest appreciates thorns too, when leveling solo.  Shields don't last forever, and extra damage is extra damage.

Enjoy the extra love this will bring, Thunderfury and Bigglesworth!
---
It‚Äôs really no big deal. I took it lightly, just wanted to do it back tbh haha
---
I've started leveling engineering never done it before as I always used to do enchanting, which spec is the best for engineering? What would you recommend ?
---
Ok cool. I was trying to run a one hander and shield but guessin that's not as good in the long run.
---
Lol, wait for fucking years then and see if anyone here cares. Sorry that you don't understand how sharded servers, worlds without flying mounts, battlegroups, and arena PvP are different than classic.
---
Looks like the game wasn't made for you, best if you go back to retail.
---
Everyone‚Äôs experience was based on either random memories from 15 years ago and private server communities which are not really going to be the same as retail.
---
Um, that‚Äôs literally my gaming setup.  55‚Äù Sony tv, Logitech K400 wireless, G600 mouse with a long ass usb extension cord, and a laptop tray with mousepad.  Kick up the recliner and play in maximum comfort.
---
Yeah, 44 damage at level 24 is huge actually, considering you're only hitting for around 80-120 on white attacks.
---
On the crapper.
---
Yes I forgot how common +healing is on all the gear I'm so lucky to get to drop for me
---
If I take 50% less damage, but deal roughly the same damage as a cat pet, then how does it matter?
---
If you can‚Äôt figure that out, I‚Äôm not sure what to tell you, cats deal 3% more damage than owl.
---
 3% more damge &lt; 50% less damage taken.
---
imp thorns is balance
---
I do the opposite, I watch them die so I can listen to them bitch about how hard their class is.
---
yeah, I did actually
---
the starting zones were crowded, but people leveled more slowly and there was a greater variety in leveling rates, which meant that once you got out of the &lt; lvl 20 zones the population was a lot more spread out than they are on Classic.
---
The owls in teldrassil starting area.

I've see it with just coa+corr.  On the tanks **main target**.

---
I know. I speak Spanish.
---
Does demo shout just grab threat at the beginning, or does it really generates threat every time you use it?
---
I like those renews.  A good warlock will be balancing their resources properly, but a bad warlock will just be life tapping to 20% HP and 100% mana after every pull.  After 46, life drain gets pretty powerful, that a warlock can be net positive on mana/health without any healer involvement at all, so that simple renew can actually stretch us really, really far.

Hey man that wasn't very Lok'tar Ogar of you.

---
Taking rez sickness on purpose is actually a very popular strategy in speed-leveling guides.  Usually you are picking up quests or walking/flying somewhere new while the sickness runs out anyway
---
This was epic. lol
---
/e picks your pocket. is always good for a laugh.
---
I like bananies
---
In a way, those two are related. The faster you can safely dump your Mana into damage, the less we have to heal.
---
If your slow to the next fight because you were still drinking, the tank has that much more agro and your not taking damage.
---
A healer with good Mana reserves is a reflection of the group doing their job well. If the control is good, we can start batch healing and regen for the last 30%.
---
If there is a group of items though, you can pick them all up at once and they make a new stack. Apparently, though according to other comments, destroying those extras doesn't abandon the quest.
---

---
you shouldnt have to buy ANYTHING
---
if youre a rogue, you should be spamming sinister strike until 4-5 combo and then eviscerate.
---
use gouge, then use bandage from first aid to heal midfight.
---
you should be leveling first aid ASAP and cooking too. always carry food.
---
if ur an alchemist/herbalist, go out of your way to craft healing potions they are incredible.
---
if u see someone killing same mobs, ask to group.
---
search youtube for "SI:7 academy" for rogue advice, there should be a stream with 4 pro rogues.
---
use that information to build the character you want whilst still being effective.
---
you do NOT have to buy stuff from the AH to level. youll very much need that gold and you shouldnt get into the habit of buying. at lv30 that gear will cost you 1g for basic shit you can do without. not worth it imo.
---
you can also disregard all of this if you feel i am describing a game you wont enjoy.
---
Are you visiting the trainer and upgrading your spells? (Also replacing the old spells on your action bar?)
---
I play on incendius and yeah this seems right.
---
Nice. Ty
---
The taste of a liar.
---
You don't have any points other than moot blatantly inaccurate comparisons dumbass. Free xfers are totally different, aren't microtransactions, and were in classic. Keep QQing bucko.
---
Enhance can't duel wield in classic, so there's that.
---
Uhm ... humor me. DT? Void? What class are you? When I think Void, I typically Warlock Voidwalker ... but then I don't know what DT is. Unless you mean Destruction spec.
---
If so, the best leveling builds for Necro are high on Affliction as it's much more mana sustainable than Destruction.
---
I'll have to double check if that's the case when I get home.
---
Lies.
---
I mean that's great, and all, but if your alliance 95% of players will want to do all the quests, which you will not be able to drop without missing most of the quest stuff.  So, i've done Gnomer full clears, the jumps save time, but not that much time.

How can you simultaneously believe that I deserve a tip, yet am an asshole for feeling entitled to that tip?
---
I have literally had a pro quake player drunkenly yell at me that wasd is for scrubs, and esdf is the only way to play a competitive game. Even in that room, there were maybe two other people who used esdf.
---
Yeah you need better weapons and make sure you‚Äôve trained up your skills. 
---
Also try gouging to regen energy.  It‚Äôs not an optimal solution, but may help as you look for better daggers (swords you need training form Undercity).
---
Isn't princess like lvl45+?
---
I wish we had more distract videos on this subreddit.
---
Yeah, lots of mobs in classic have that. So when not all mobs in a village are ones you need, it is still better to kill em all.
---
This question is asked all the time and never answered.  Even Frostadomus engineering video left this part out.  I used Classic.db and searched the word "Gnomish" to pull up all items with a requires Gnomish tag, but I don't know if that's all of them.
---
Had to pull up a specific image of UO with all this talk.

Post a screen when you do, I wanna see.
---
But also horde dominant. Which is good I‚Äôm rolling horde. But for how uneven the pvp q will be horrible too  till phase 3
---
Can someone explain what layering is ?
---
I had a healer tell me "feel free to life tap as much as you need" in a dungeon a while back. I never stopped,  sometimes people get pissed but then its like OK dont heal me, jeez.
---
Like I said, we need more horde soldiers!   ( where are you getting that number?)
---
Talk to thrall in Org. Do the quest Hidden Enemies, at the end u can get a group to run the dungeon RFC and you get a nice dagger reward. Also another good dagger drops in that dungeon. Don‚Äôt spend $ on the AH there are plenty of quest rewards for good gear
---
Was approaching 40 when my buddy said he didn't feel like doing the Horde leveling zones again and rolled Alliance. Other buddy will be taking a BL3 hiatus shortly and other one plays infrequently and may be getting tired of it already. 
---
Kinda bummed.

Census only counts people that are using the addon and is unreliable as a result. I don‚Äôt play on that server or any other pst server so I can‚Äôt comment further than that.

The damage might scale with your engineering level. If it does, you might be able to one shot lvl 30's with it
---
Yeah, ended up finding out it was Questguru. I feel stupid haha. Thanks for the comment though!
---
Yeah, I think you hit the nail on the head. The "tourists" who will slowly fizzle out are the ones looking to min-max. By the nature of the game being 'figured out' things are going to get super boring for them super fast. There really isn't any mystery to min-maxing any more, and rushing isn't doing themselves any favors. Folks like myself and most of the others are just playing the game for what it's worth. I've got 2 level 18 toons and am taking my time leveling through the zones I missed, catching up on quests, and just genuinely having a good time. I'm in no rush to level but I also know for a fact that I'm not going to be quitting any time soon... mostly because it's actually going to take me a good long while given my available play time.
---
For the shift+ and ctrl+ hotkeys where do you put them on your bars?
---
I'm waiting until I can make my Hillman's Shoulderpads... need more leather.
---
I like how we update our war terms to account for current events
---
What is travelling xp
---
I did send it in lmao and they are sending me a new one. I'm allowed to discuss things that are relevant to my life in a section of comments with others who also have had problems. So way to jump to conclusions, and also being a dick over it :)
---
That guy had no idea how to jump. When parkour runners make jumps like that, they essentially throw their center of mass, and use their legs to project it. He tried frogging off the ledge and human legs will never be powerful enough to cross any kind of sizable distance doing that.
---
I had groups of 5-man mages clearing strath, ubrs, etc back in 2004-2006. AOE groups existed, you just seem ignorant of the fact.
---
?  what does "helping out friends"  and we have changed the game to be less punishing have in common?
---
(btw I really do like having the infernal run crazy Because its great role play! A demon doesn't WANT to be enslaved especially one that strong.)
---
Thunderfury, sorry!
---
Wow pop app spot. Add on info people upload
---
Rofl me too
---
How do you know faction balance?
---
Jumped, missed and didn't die from fall damage.
---
1/10
---
And for things like this, I will throw whatever non-essentials greens I have at you, or 'unneeded' crafting materials you can sell for a profit.
---
Perfect! 15,000 it is!
---
You‚Äôre making it sound as if it‚Äôs some crazy hidden script that players shouldn‚Äôt have access to. As if it was a GM script they failed to lock out. It‚Äôs simply automation of what they are doing now.
---
Also, did you miss the post by a blue last week? No one is making a significant enough advantage from layering misuse. Hell, everyone has access to its capabilities. It‚Äôs your choice not to do so. ***YOU*** are the one putting yourself at the disadvantage by choosing not to partake.
---
If I do I will. I am currently digging my current UI. I will send a link of it later.
---
Thanks for all the help guys!! Made me laugh and gave my the courage to start my journey through Azeroth!!
---
yeah, and you couldn't even get to some places (Tempest Keep) without a flying mount.
---
The skill upgrades only apply to abilities with mana cost.
---
While I understand your point, if the chest is locked the rogue can argue his lockpick is not enough and come back later.
---
Every class has its perks and utility, mages can give you food/water, locks can summon/HS, rogues can open locks.
---
If you agree with taking one of these classes and the person is a douche, kick him and grab another one, the only difficult spots to replace are tank and healer.
---
I understand some of you are new to this, but wow is about community, put him on ignore and @ lvl 60 he'll be a sad idiot looking for PUGs.
---
I think it's fair on inviting a rogue to the group to state the locked chest rule, it may become a thing.
---
Ever since Classic was just "WoW", I have had the white/blue gorilla from Un'Goro  as my tank pet. He has been named "Monkey" since immediately after I tamed him.
---
&gt; "Gorillas aren't monkeys, they're apes."
---
Yeah, I know. What's your point?
---
For leveling and a little bit into Level 60, I definitely recommend going BM.
---
For rotation, Hunters Mark, Arcane shot, Auto shot, Multishot, autoshot, SerpentSting and then rinse and repeat arcane shot and multishot, making sure not to interupt any auto shots.
---
For talents I would just look up leveling Hunter BM talents for vanilla wow.
---
If you you want your healer to be drinking at every opportunity and not 'slowing' you do down I hope you either have a mage or are buying some beverage stacks to give to your healer because that shit is to expensive to chug for 3 seconds and then get running to catch up to an inpatient group every few minutes.
---
Glad I could brighten your day! üëç
---
Lol just yesterday a friend of mine jumped in the way of the deeprun tram and got stuck going back and forth from Stormwind to Ironforge
---
New era, new legend.
---
Yeah but who really wants to live their life based around when the queue pops
---
I have a mace (2.8 speed I think) and 1.8 speed wand.  I do melee, then wand+wand.
---
Lok'Tar
---
RNG is a gold sink but for time.
---
thanks my man! i‚Äôm gonna give it a go!!
---
Roll alliance on Skeram if u want PvP. Well, sometimes it's PvP and sometimes it's massacre
---
Wow pop app is a site that people upload data from an add on that capture players online over lvl 5 and the complies the data. It‚Äôs decent to judge
---
Wait people think Elvui is too much? It's a minimalist UI and so easy to configure.. Would love to see your UI if you think Elv is too much.
---
Go ahead
---
Do you know how many items in WoW are called "Glaives" that are objectively not Glaives?
---
Pretty sure these dungeon boss epics have a literal 0.1% drop rate.
---
It generates threat with each cast, same as battle shout but I believe demo generates more.
---
Oh fk wow ok there goes my plans
---
They're like AI robots. Just use low rank renew to break their patience. After a few pulls, they will learn a new skill: eating.
---
Rule of thumb: if the warlock is using two or three life taps between the pulls, it's ok. Give him some love. Full life drain = AI robot.
---
They do. I wouldn't characterize it as short. By the time you kill the last boss the boxes you looted near the clean zone will be back. That's probably like a 20-30 minute timer, minimum.
---
FACE THE LED!
---
didn't see any proper hunter guides out for the live servers yet so i made my own.
---
Well my complaint is it killed world PVP
---
Depends entirely on level. I was in a group that was having trouble killing them (despite being told to do so) and I was scratching my head until the dps shared that half of their attacks were missing the mines due to being underleveled.
---
Transmog was a fantastic addition to the game and has been one of my favorite parts of retail. 
---
But I don‚Äôt want it in classic.
---
haha! Welcome my friend. we are glad to have you
---
Yep this is exactly where I‚Äôm at. Too high for everything I‚Äôve already done and way too low for the next zones. Feel pretty stuck. Gonna just grind SM and hillsbrad mobs for a hot second.
---
How do you figure? Some server show tons of player base so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs only people with the add on. I thought it was scans of online people
---
Every single time. If I just get the perfect line I can go in between these mobs. And they are both pulled
---
Yeah, it's more oriented towards people looking to pug these dungeons with your standard average group. You can do all of these way below the suggested levels, but you'll have a much smoother experience sticking to no more than -3
---
Yeah, I always struggle with ganking people just minding their own business questing. But when im with guildies I tend to be a lot more aggressive. Just felt bad because I know how rough escorts can be.
---
Omg I completely forgot you could do this!
---
Two wrongs do not make a right.  Also, the Classic community claims they are better than the retail community. That attitude is no way to prove it.
---
Why did you stutter on the landing and just sit there and strafe? If you kept running to the corner of the landing I feel like you could have jumped and had at least a small chance at making it on board lol.
---
"dead" silent
---
This seems to be happening in all dungeons with humanoid runners.
---
&gt; due to gaming culture
---
Lmao, can't be a gamer without opressing women and minorities!
---
&gt;BUT i wont accept people trying to censor more speech
---
Because asking people not to use slurs=government putting people in jail for saying things, those two are the same thing.
---
&gt;I probably wouldnt kick you, because im very accepting
---
Oh you're truly a generous God! you wouldn't kick me for not using slurs? Oh my your kindness and self sacrifice knows no bounds!
---
&gt;but again, i think you are on the wrong side
---
Yes, those people who like to spam the N word are the righteous crusaders for moral justice, and those evil vile creatures who ask epic gamers to no express their cultrue via racism and sexism deserve the gas chamber, you're right.
---
Yeah, he did die iirc
---
Some people made some on reddit. Id search "shaman guide" or shaman talents. Also Icy Veins has a Classic leveling guide.
---
Leveling a rogue is very hard!! Stop being shy and invite ppl who are in the area .
---
No they won't
---
Vol'jin for warchief 2020
---
I don't like razer mice in general.  Had a Deathadder die in just 3mo, and another one die in about a year.
---
It‚Äôs almost like the odds of something that has already happened are always 100%.  Woah.
---
I was under the impression that all mobs in SMGY were elite, but to be fair, I haven't been there in roughly 14 years.
---
Azshara/Medivh are super powerful mages. Azshara caused the Sundering. Nerzhul and Gul'dan represent warlocks, being the source of the undead and exploding the planet of Draenor. Shamans and warlocks are responsible for summoning Ragnaros and the Old God Cthun.
---
You can blame the near extinction of the red and black dragon flights on warriors/hunters, but really warlocks are behind that, too.
---
Pretty much it's all mages and warlocks.
---
Dire Maul is going to be armageddon on Phase 2 launch day.

I think you mean how great STV PvP is

Man I got to the mine part and was tired of running back there so I went to thousand needles. What am I missing out on?

no time now, i'll reply tomorrow

 Come join my ragtag group on Sulfuras.
---
https://gethuman.com/contact/Blizzard
---
That has a customer service email and phone number.
---
Honestly, classic wow has been flawless for me so far.  It was blown away my expectations.
---
Ah bummer. Sounds like somethings definitely screwy with the network routing or something.
---
Awesome thanks I use several of those in retail thanks big help
---
There's a difference between skill and time though. 
---
I don't have a huge amount of time to play, but I'm more than capable of doing M+ at 10-15 level. 
---
So, does someone who has a very low skill ceiling and stands in fire but has a lot of time to play deserve to be as far or further purely because of a time-based grind? 
---
I see the problems as two separate axes and there's no solution that's going to fit everyone.
---
I've always found self-promotion to be permissable if you're giving shit away. You'll get a bunch of temporary viewers who are only there for the giveaway, but one or two may stick around - that's what matters. Just don't suck.
---
Its like when you pretend for so long that you actually become your persona.
---
I am talking about people that actually put a lot of effort in their gear, not the guy that ran some normal dungeon a few times.
---
I was in the same position as you and am on track now at 39. The gold from vendoring/quests picks up significantly around 35 or so. Keep pushing forward as well as the other tips in this thread.
---
Tool tip is fucked. It generates rage in combat
---
Which can be beneficial when an enemy uses totems. Leave those suckers up and start the fight with a giant rage pool to go pew pew
---
If your current zone is too hard, go to a lower zone. Whatever 1-10 zone you did not do yet has plenty of green quests for you.
---
Is there any good guide on healing as a priest? I've always played DPS classes, but I'm maining a priest right now and I have no clue what I'm doing.
---
Much obliged. I'm almost 36 but still this is crucial information
---
RFC is soooo much exp if you're 13
---
Everything you're saying implies that without a sample size of 100%, it's impossible to have valid statistics. That's completely incorrect.
---
Man, I love ST. Don't be like that.
---
I'm 48 now, and I've had both really good, and really bad.  I shouldn't pull aggro with just a coa/corr, but it's happened on the tank's main target, and I've also had tanks who can hold aggro on 5 targets with 3 dots rolling on all of them + my nukes.  I've had spellcleave groups kite a pack through my helfire and then nova them right on top of me, and I've had godlike mages that could perfectly control an entire pull.
---
You never know what you're going to get with pugs, basically.
---
Census runs a bunch of /who's with strict filters, it will count nearly everyone logged when you run it. The issue is it doesn't auto upload anywhere and while there are a few sites now taking manual uploads they are pretty new and don't have much data.
---
Hybrids are especially useful in PvP (SLSL locks come to mind).  PvP is very much not about having the most dps and doing sneaky things.  Now without Armory or talent inspect you can develop your own secret specs!  That's a pretty cool aspect of it I didn't think about!
---
I've been trying to find a macro that will put a raid marker (moon or whatever) on the mob that I sheep. Do you know of such a thing? Or maybe a macro that will set the focus to a mob that I sheep?
---
Good point. Let's start reporting the weird cleavage exaggerations in random wall paintings on Azeroth.
---
Probably one of the [leaked expansions](https://pastebin.com/A1ufVsyz) from before release.

Idea: Automatically convert all macros from

to

---
I liked the idea of a prisoner riot!
---
Fear Ward mostly, but also Stoneform is a very strong defensive to have, especially in PvP.
---
Human is a better ‚Äúhealer‚Äù in terms of throughput, but they lose out on Fear Ward
---
It generates 1 rage per 3s. If you have rage. This tick does not care if your in combat or not. 
---
I don't know however if you will get the tick to start once your in combat. Or if you need atleast 1 rage to start
---
My cycle isn't working where you auto attack, aim shot, then auto attack should fire right after, but it doesn't. It was working before. It might have stopped working when I switched weapons to double-barreled shotgun.
---
Anyone know why? Ive tried to time the aim shot differently but no luck. I can succesfully cast instant cast shots (arcane shot) between auto attacks with no issue.
---
Experienced the same. Reinstalling fixed it.
---
Yeah 20 is rough but 30 , 30 is where its at.
---
Hoof sees you, and Hoof will have his revenge.
---
Ayy, played on Eitrigg (Horde) too, 12+ years ago.
---
I use shift modifiers on everything with q and e for main spells, 1 and 2 for big cooldowns or spenders, 3 for interrupt, r and f for status and buff cooldowns, z for self heals, c for movement, and 4 for cc.
---
I agree it does suck that the ability loses some flavor.  At the very least it should still be aggressive to the warlock who summoned it.
---
Blizzard has taken a stance on skeletons and kiting bosses to cities.  This may just be another place where Blizzard wants to avoid a potential mess.  We have to wait for an official stance.
---
It's more like McDonald's. It's not perfect, a lot of it is actually terrible, but it's quick to install, easy to configure, and saves you time.
---
I always hated elvui, but I'm using it this go-round because I didn't feel like spending a dozen hours fucking about with my UI.
---
It's not ideal, but it works and its easy.
---
I still had to replace a couple parts I just couldn't live with.
---
Made about a 100 of those guns. Had money for my mount. 
---
"dont do what everyone else is doing" - Thats waht I call a 'pro gamer move'
---
Check out a guide... there are some decent Warrior leveling guides.
---
I would say keep up on your first aid and make bandages as they are great to keep on going.  You didn't say what class your GF is but if she is a healing class you could be a wrecking machine with a dedicated healer following you around.
---
For leveling purposes most people go either Arms or Fury - you can tank instances with that build still.  Get yourself a tank setup (main hand + shield) and then also get a leveling setup - usually two hand sword or axe once you get to level 20 or so but you can also dual wield if you are into that.  Make sure to get your Warrior quests early on - at level 20 (I think) you get a quest for a blue chest piece - at around  level 30 you get a quest for a Whirlwind Axe or Sword and also at level 30 you get a quest for your Berserker Stance.
---
You really just have to learn your limitations with how many mobs you can take on, etc... but again that will be eased if the GF is a healer.
---
Because liking one more than the other doesn't matter; what matters is what's faster.
---
Iconic
---
Wasn't it this weird red nightmare?
---
There are no bgs, and therefore no queues, before phase 3 and we will (I'm pretty sure) have cross realm bgs after that
---
I am Chestnutz.
---
I mean, that's how you got DKP or whatever in BC. Mages just showed up to provide food and got told to jump a cliff and they'd get loot later.
---
I would disagree about Cata. That one introduced rated battlegrounds which was one of my favorite features.
---
Yes, no problem at all
---
Hey I appreciate the invite, but I just rolled a pally with my buddy. I'm gonna wait and see how it shakes out with the other two. I'm mostly just bummed because of the time investment and all that.
---
The community is unquestionably better in Classic WoW.  Is that even up for debate?
---

---
This is what my warriors bar looks like at the moment, i havent set up the ctrl+ stuff yet but on retail I place that bar right above where my Q E R T bar is
---
That's the biggest sike ive seen yet.
---
Too much lol, lots of sitting in trade spamming my services. No alt, just a banker
---
Are u a mod on r/amish
---
As a rogue, I actually anticipate and prefer this viewpoint. If I have accidentally gained threat that I do not want, I have about 89 different ways to de-aggro. If I have engaged an add and have not led it to you and then used one of those skills, it means I have recognized the need to peel because you as the tank are having your attention stretched, be it with adds, things that split off to attack casters, poor group position, or whatever. 
---
Between evasion, gouge bandage, and riposte, I can generally hold a mob's attention safely until it is dead without being an undue strain on the healer. If I cannot pass aggro, I'll ask for assistance, otherwise it's generally intentional.
---
The idea that it‚Äôs faster to kill things while walking backwards rather than stopping to kill them is so wrong that it hurts my head.
---
Yeah vanilla tooltips were misleading and classic preserved that lol Anger Management is awesome, hell, Tactical Mastery is just as awesome! I can't pass up these two ever! (Plus TM is needed :P)
---
Worked for me.
---
Blacklist I believe.   Friends made it, I'm just along for the ride
---
I stood around for like 15 minutes and I never saw Tooga appear :(
---
It does say "alliance" after all.
---
YaHT also compensates for the 500 ms ticks but it may not be updated on Curse, just on GitHub.
---
right, so try both and figure it out.
---
Ty
---
Yes the creator
---
yeah, him emoting at you to wait is pretty great though. I was so close/desperate to finally getting my drop that I bubbled and just spammed /beg when the last group started to kill me.
---
I've been trying for 2 daysssss please leave me aloneeeee haha
---
I did not transfer from  Skeram, and I don't regret it one bit. The longest queue I've seen is about 40 minutes. I hope everyone finds a solution they like.
---
But does it not just feel weird seeing everyone else have the same weapon regardless of their connection with their character? 
---
I mean, my paladins main spec is prot so I got Ashbringer as an afterthought.. so for me I think it completely devalues the item. And even now it's just sat there in my bank being neglected. Replaced with a very generic "Golden Empire Broadsword".
---
Musa?
---
Correct, what I‚Äôm saying is when bgs hit the que time for horde could be bad. Our limited windows for playing would hinder our playtime
---
I had the same ones drop! Also around level 15, currently just hit lvl 19 and am still rocking them proudly.
---
I'm out there opening lockboxes to raise money, but my spam line has the caveat "Tips are great, but if you're poor I gotchu anyway"
---
Our future Rank 14

I think the market corrected from 13-15 years ago. People are smarter and there are so many guides. I can‚Äôt give away strange dust, for example.
---
This worked for me, thanks!
---
He just can't hold aggro... if he did, Tinkerer would be a joke, and you could shave off like a minute of time on Princess
---
Wow, I thought maybe there's a chance it's just not me whose game just broke like half an hour ago. My game starts to flicker almost instantly when I log in game, audio freezes as well. Two times it has crashed pc entirely. Tried to play Warframe and all is well there, also clean installed nvidia gpu drivers and tried lowest graphic settings, still. How does it flicker for you?
---
Well, ain't that some shit.
---
no... NO! this is great!
---
Keep it up dood, give the people what they want!
---
I got one off a red whelp yesterday. I had time to kill so figured I would go try it out. It dropped on the second one I killed. Was truly amazing.
---
Well I mean think about it, really isn't a "High" demand for those higher enchanting mats cause everyone is focused on getting to 60 and then also getting their Epic ground mount. Once a bigger number of 60's are around there's going to be more of a need for high level enchants.
---
I'd say stock pile the mats you can afford to buy and just wait, I'm willing to bet it'll pay off when you can up charge for these mats and enchants.
---
Take your disgusting retail lore and go. None of that happened in my classic. Kael'thas is *still* trapped in a crack den.
---
I honestly think mop could be slightly redesigned by blizzard to be a classic wow expansion. It has a lot of wonderous exploration potential to forge your own path through a new land
---
Easiest way by far is to farm SM. I had a little more gold than you at that level but by level 40 I had 150 gold. You‚Äôre prime level to start farming GY and then start farming Lib around 33/34. Then go to armory around 36/37 and then finally cath around 38/39. Make sure to loot EVERYTHING. You never realize just how much those grey weapons/amor you loot at worth. That means open all of those weapon crates in the armory. On top of that, greens are always dropping so just hope you get lucky and you‚Äôll have even more stuff to vendor. 
---
SM without a doubt got me all my mount money with a ton of gold to spare. And as an added bonus you get great XP as you race to 40.
---
Meta builds dont make you a good player. But neither does facetanking a mob while spamming revenge.
---
I wrote that part to show character, it shows that it would be against my own morals to buy gold, cus it makes my goals hollow, i kinda understand you though, mount isnt something to be proud of if you bought it for real money.
---
I belive I did the border so it could be easier for me to see and click things.
---
Didn't have the best setup at the time:
---

---
Thanks. I was curious if you were putting them on some hidden hotbar, but I can see you have them accessible in front of you. I still use my mouse for everything when I'm playing casually so I need to balance things.
---
This is great
---
I heal and I honestly don't care if I have to give a DPS a heal now and then but I can't stand watching a whole dungeon or raid wander around like morons. The tank pulls something and the mage starts hitting the mob next to it. If everyone can just keep situational awareness at the most basic level it makes everything easier.
---
DPS heals distract from the game but it happens sometimes. Fix yourself before you complain about damage not getting healed. I know many people who will let a squirrely DPS die because they can't manage agro or targets to focus fire.
---
That's a weird way to spell Keith. :shrug:
---
A glaive in the realm of science fiction and fantasy is also a fictional weapon that is meant to be thrown and returned. Objectively, as this is a sci-fi/fantasy game, those are glaives.
---
What would you recommend for lvl 40?
---
In my runs, I am the healer. You can sit for more than 3 seconds, dont need to heal just because someone started taking damage.
---
Yeah im hopeful, havent done anything wrong, i will get my account back soon enough im sure.
---
The vocal minority üòÇ
---
It wasn‚Äôt there 14 years ago. ‚ÄúCleave‚Äù wasn‚Äôt used to describe compositions until Arenas in at least TBC, and people weren‚Äôt recruiting for all Mage/Lock groups at all. I mained a Lock in a racing guild during Vanilla, and never heard anything about running these sorts of groups until Classic started getting a following. 
---
The game mechanics might have existed, but the community wasn‚Äôt doing this in any significant amount. This just wasn‚Äôt where our mindset was 14 years ago.
---
Can start gathering everything you'll need for it early though, at least!
---
You don't use beer? Making ramen with PBR or Keystone was big in college.
---
I mostly feel the same way, and have been tanking a lot (currently level 36), but I've come around to it.
---
At the end of the day, it's pretty surprising how many hits even clothies can take. It's not a big deal if the DPS warrior or hunter pet offtanks unintentionally. It's pretty tough to get a full group wipe unless an extra set of mobs gets pulled when you're already stressed.
---
Ultimately it's just not the biggest deal that DPS pulls aggro. It's a little tedious, but basically nothing is gained by waiting for us to generate enough rage to stack a few sunders. If you can accept that and do what you can to pick up what mobs you can, you might enjoy it more.
---
At least, that's how I'm looking at it.
---
Cloak is only good if it has pockets
---
Go play retail then. It has all the ease of access and verticality you desire.
---
Still works. They cant shut it down unless they disable the ability for add ons to parse chat. Its not going away.
---
Turn on ipv6 in your router settings and on wow. If your isp gives you an ipv6 to the home itll work.
---
At least it did for me
---
If I'm out questing I'm not going to tame something learn the skill then run back to town to get my other pet back out. I'm just going to keep the pet until its time to turn in the quest and then I will abandon.
---
Bump back down to 7 in graphics settings.  I tried going full throttle at 10 and my system went into 747 taking off mode.  At 7 it‚Äôs damn near silent and still looks incredible for 15 years old.
---
I hear ya. I just found out recently I won‚Äôt be able to do my warlock quests for my epic mount until a later phase. R.I.P.
---
That actually explains why the AH in Stormwind feels stuffed into a random building, while in IF it feels like a nice dedicated spot right across from the bank. I didn't know that little detail.
---
thank you! Fixed.
---
As a druid, both the hunter and the pet get buff.
---
At 60 you can start solo'ing 35 to 40ish Dungeon content and getting way more gold than 12-15g an hour.
---
Limit FPS option may help, try with 60 fps.
---
Yah, the argument is really dumb, but many vanilla servers/factions called it "VC", even in 2004. Either way, everybody always knows what you mean because nobody is forming a dire maul group in westfall.

My computer gets to a point where it‚Äôs so hot stuff starts going slow af and basically melting lol
---
Lifetap can used once in a while, as part of a rotation, and then Demon Skin will slowly replenish health. But what usually happens is the warlock goes oom and then casts Lifetap a bunch of times in a row. It's dumb.
---
Maybe though gold is more scarce now as well so depends on what you want to do with the money. If making more AH purchases then it is probably a wash.  If cashing them in later for an epic mount then it isn‚Äôt a terrible strategy.
---
Cried because everyone there seems to know what you‚Äôre talking about and you forget how to do a print statement in c++
---
The thing I'm seeing now is this silly "LFM for X dungeon X piece of gear is reserved for Tank" or WORSE "Lf Tank, Gear that tank wants is reserved for Coward warrior who wont tank"
---
I'm all for trying to curate your party so that there is no competition if something drops, but people reserving 2 handers for their tank is silly to me. Just request certain classes then.
---
I remember doing BRD in classic for the 4th or 5th time and we got to a boss that I didn't even know existed.  The place was massive.
---
Thunderbluff, the Tauren racial capital and major city for the Horde. You'll have to run through Barrens to get there, it's a pain in the ass but a necessary one.
---
Lol = eye roll
---
I would say it's just WoW classic, but rocket league also has a severe latency issue.  I play a lot of games and these two are the only ones with the networking issue and my ISP has been out a few times about the rocket league one.
---
Thank you for doing the Lord's work
---
For sure, you would think your character would be like "okay there's this cave and then there's skull rock, which one?"
---
And sometimes its fine when they're not specific. "Go kill this mob, we don't know where they are". That's fine to me, because the adventure part of the quest is finding the mob, not just killing it.
---
I definitely prefer the /drool especially towards gnomes
---
LOL functioning he says
---
I've seen this for quite a few things. The biggest problem is there aren't as many people out there with gold to spare. Gold is gained pretty much exponentially- the higher level you are, the faster you will earn it. A level 60 can vendor a grey for 30s-1g easy. They can get 5g from going back and doing a single quest. But i've seen people sit on the steps of the SW bank and sell linen bags for 3-6s each for hours on end trying to make those first few gold so they can boost their professions or afford whatever they may need while leveling up and getting started. Those lower level people are holding on to their gold much harder than the higher levels, and there just aren't many higher levels running about yet. So yeah, 4g for a shard is actually very expensive for anybody under level 20 or 30 i'd say, that's probably almost all the gold they have if they've been buying skills etc. But like I said in the beginning, thats less than one quest for a 60. 
---
Another big thing is the pure quantity of a lot of the lower level materials. There are probably much more level 30s doing SM right now than there will be in 6 months, meaning much more loot being dropped and much more loot being disenchanted. Give it a few months and there actually might be more of a demand for those radiant shards because less people are naturally there doing it, meaning people have to take the time to farm them, and time is money friend. 
---
Give it time, I think prices will go up a little bit for quite a few things.
---
It was a vanilla forum thing I think, people used to say "cry more" or "QQ nub" or "diaf" or "ZMOGWTFBBQSAUCEPWNT!!!!1one!!". Life was strange! Haha.
---
Speaking from experience on private servers the biggest drop off is usually around AQ release, so phase 5. AQ40 is a huge step up from BWL and it catches guilds off guard. This causes rapid burnout which leads to many guilds collapsing. In addition to this many people are done with the PvP ranking and also the gear from AQ is so OP that players start to just one-shot eachother so people don't bother with PvP at all. 
---
I can't solve the PvP issue, but the key to succeeding in AQ40 is having tanks who can deal with when things go wrong. You need to train your warriors to be on their toes at all times. And not just the tanks, the dps warriors need to learn how to emergency tank when shit hits the fan. Vanilla has a tendency to make good raiders bad because of its lack of mechanics. Keep your raiders on their toes by doing speedruns, challengeruns, force them to PvP and so on.
---
A fair amount of people were like 12-13 when they first played vanilla, so they absolutely would have done that on paper and not known how to use excel lol
---
Spec demo/destro, then you can sacrifice your imp hit your target with fear, curse of elements make sure you have a Firestone equipped and hit your target with a Soulfire. You crit them and drop a tank 1shot, otherwise it's still massive damage.
---
Please nice community member, I've learned my lesson, don't call the WoW police!
---
Even towards the end of BC, playing my Druid felt like being a raid boss in PvP.
---
This is part of the issue with simple requests like "buff hybrid specs" that were well meaning in vanilla. Small buffs suddenly took marginally sub optimal specs and made them absolute goliaths. 
---
I actually think the problem with Vanilla was more of an itemization one than a raw class power one.
---
this is accurate. you also can kite around croc on the lower levels but it's not perfected yet and kind of a pain with bad gear.
---
Some say he's still charging to this very day
---
Its hoggers final form.
---
If a player is terrorizing a lowbie zone to the point where it becomes a problem you might call for assistance to deal with the situation.
---
Sounds to me like you need something to cheer you up. How about a nice cup of **[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]**?
---
Group in Barrens looking for tank for WC. I joined on my druid. Group members were 1 rogue, 2 hunters, and shaman healer. FML
---
True dat tho :)
---
This would be great, I would love to contribute if it was open source.
---
Yknow Reddit has a save feature
---
Buddy, I'm just biding my time til they rerelease BC and Wrath, glad you won't be there tho ‚úå
---
i know that but what‚Äôs FP?
---
Change your TTL to 128.
---
It's not just you encountering this. I'm at around 48 now and have been tanking ZF as of late, and just wrapped up Uldaman around 44. What I've noticed in both instances is that most DPS just want to go all out as soon as they hear the mobs make the aggro sound. Personally I blame a lot of this mentality on cleave groups in scarlet monastery since that seems to be how everyone is getting from 28 to 40. 
---
If I have a mage in the group, I can't tank an instance without them complaining that I'm not pulling fast enough. Nevermind the fact that the sole healer is a balance druid and one of the mages isn't even frost. Spell cleave is cancer right now and every PUG I seem to get involved in wants to do it even if we don't have the aoe for it. Warlocks just sit within melee range of a pack of mobs that I just pulled hellfiring when I barely have the first demo shout up, then wonder why they die. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a cleave group every now and then (did a 4x warrior 1x paladin group a while back and we demolished everything in ZF easy) but this mentality that every single group has to be a streamlined maximum xp/hour meat grinder is pretty annoying. We're all trying to level, and if you're a DPS that is purposely going faster than your tank you are increasing the risk of a wipe - which slows down the xp per hour way more than if you just waited 2 or 3 seconds before popping blade flurry and going ham in the middle of the crowd when your tanks initial white hit gets parried.
---
Thanks for the in depth knowledge. Seriously i can't believe you wrote all this for my question and i will for sure put it to the test and hopefully do it right! Can i ask what gear you run for for tanking?
---
Damn even the Whitemane players don't come here to recommend Whitemane
---
Also, for the love of god, dont PW: Shield the warrior unless he is about to die and you want time to cast a big heal. My Rage!
---
**[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]**?
---
My first reddit comment is on a wow gif. Thank you for the laugh.
---
ok that sounds amazing, I will take a look when I'm home from work. youtube is firewalled at work sadly
---
This is why you should join the Horde, we aren't evil like those gnomes. Just misrepresented.
---
Having an over-leveled prof feels so good. I remember being like lvl 18 crafting something for somebody level 32 last week.
---
I felt beyond powerful
---
Trade skill master is the only one I've found so far. I don't really like it but can't stand the tiny crafting window
---
You can't expect people who never played classic to just randomly know how to play it.
---
Ya trust me, ignore everything else in this post and just get those two weps, the second you do you'll be killing shit so fast it'll be a joke. (in fact, once you get just the Blade of Cunning you'll see a huge damage increase/difficulty decrease, once you get both weps you'll be unstoppable).
---
Miss boat by a hair's breath and then the next one pushes me off the dock so I missed it again.
---
They aren't intentionally exaggerating. They're basing it of private servers which probably has incorrect drop rates.
---
Go aquatic form then.
---
To each their own, but I despise silvermoon. It *could* have been the best city, but it has no value. Theres no point in going there for city related things.

In on this. Could be special.

yeah, mara princess runs can net an average of about 9gold per run, and you can do about 5 runs in an hour once you've got it down. [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/maraudon-gold-farming-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/maraudon-gold-farming-classic-wow)
---
I wish you luck my man, and even if you don't complete the dungeon the journey there will still be a memory to never forget!
---
addon?
---
From what I understand, an add-on like Atlas Loot pulls it's data directly from gear currently existing in the world.  So, if you zoned into Black Temple right at reset, and see a glaive on Atlas Loot, you know that Illidan is going to drop one.  So you can then camp inside BT until raid time.  If you don't see one, you can zone out and, if one one else currently online has a glaive, you can zone back in and look to see if a glaive populated again.
---
Makes sense, thanks!
---
Yeah, I was at 9 originally and I turned it down to 6 and it still happens. :(
---
Yea i play wow to get away from real life for a bit not to argue with strangers half of which are just trolls anyways.
---
/u/ketzo On top of this, keep track of their DPS numbers. The hunter pulling 100 dps has higher priority than the mage spinning in circles doing 30 dps while spamming "/train".
---
That said, if the hunter isn't controlling his dps and is pulling aggro from the tank because he's trying to BD the instance, sometimes letting him die will resolve the problem if the tank can re-establish aggro.
---
Very good advice otherwise.
---
Also - don't renew your mates unless you're going hard into Holy/Disc and/or have quite a bit of +healing. Flash heal them. Much better use of mana.
---
Apply dots. Put on shield. Cast wand till dead.
---
Rinse and repeat as needed.

I booked two weeks vacation to play classic wow and on the first friday my gtx 760 burned out on me. Purchased all new parts the next day and built the computer. I was back up and running saturday at 5:00 PM.

Flex post or not, was good to read your story!  Grats on whelps!
---
Layering doesn't affect drop rates.
---
At 58 I would just grind for pre-bis. Its not the fastest root but you'll be raid ready by 60, depending on rng of course. That's going to be route.
---
Yikes man! There are a lot of upgrades you could get at that point.....
---
Easy, but slow. Holy Fire-&gt;Mind Blast-&gt;SW:P-&gt;Wand... As you level up, throw in another Mind Blast. Mana isn't an issue unless you really go HAM, but it's hard to outdps your wand lol (Mind Flay does about the same).
---
I... should have known this. Thank you, I think I remember spamming it back in the day now, 14 year old me probably would have done the research to find the best way to aoe tank.
---
I crafted my first with leatherworking and it didnt feel as good as getting them from a drop
---
I dont know what yall are talking about, but on Fairbanks that shit is wildin'. Constant parties of horde and ally roaming looking to steamroll, and occasional skulls patrolling the area and killing everyone on sight. Both factions (but moreso horde)
---
After countless times of getting ganked just passing by horde while questing my initiative now that I‚Äôm a decent level is red is dead! And run TF away from big groups or skull level. It‚Äôs been pretty fun getting revenge in ashenvale after countlessly getting ganked there. Last time I ran through there as a low level I got punked by a Tauren that acted friendly only long enough to wait for his rogue buddy to stun me and they gank me, the Tauren then teabagged me while the undead rogue ate my corpse. So since that moment read is dead.
---
Yes I can't play how I use to anymore so wasting an hour waiting for a UBRS group won't do anymore. So I can understand you annoyance but hopfully you can find a group of people that play in your time frame and you can get more fun out of the game or if not then I hope you can find a new game that works for you better.
---
You're only slightly correct. He was being *possessed* for years by Sargeras himself, who was also manipulating Gul'dan. The books make it clear that Medivh was delving deeply into Warlock magics in the 'inverse' Karazhan. Whether that makes him a Warlock or not, and exactly how much of the opening of the Dark Portal was Mage magic versus Warlock magic, is not really known.
---
Besides, like I said, the Guardian of Tirisfal is kind of a special case. S/he's literally the focal point of the sum total of the magical potency of multiple  of the greatest mages to ever live. The Guardian is *not* demonstrative of the power of a typical mage, or even an archmage. And beyond that, it's not known how much of Medivh's power stemmed from being the Guardian, and how much stemmed from having a literal Titan possessing his soul, or how and when that power was applied.
---
If you're into that thing sure, not everyone is
---
Those are some impressive bananas you got there Sir.
---
They are very easy and straightforward. Level shadow/disc to 44, respec to shadowform, level the rest disc. Shield, MB, SW:P, mind flay mind flay wand to death.
---
Not many spots to pull over on the highway haha
---
The shaman was likely using Earthshock and/or Rockbiter Weapon. Both of which cause extra threat. You can inspect them to see which weapon effect they are using and notify them if they are making life hard for you. Earthshock is an awkward one because it is also a spell cast interrupt, but they should just use rank 1 when necessary. Before lvl 20, they just have earthshock and fire shock, so some of them may be careless about which they use.
---
I was tanking SFK the other night and had a shaman who was constantly pulling single target threat from me even with us doing similar DPS, I found out he was using Rockbiter weapon, let him know and he switched. Sometimes people don't realize what their skills are doing. I've also had issues with priest DPS opening on groups with Mind Blast, another high threat skill, and pulling aggro from me, but with less success on telling them to not open with it.
---
As a druid tank, I feel like losing aggro is especially brutal. Attack Speed is standardized to 2.50 and any miss/parry/dodge in the first couple hits means I'll probably lose aggro a second later.
---
I mean you can, just hope the mobs dont hit hard because I won't be tanking them.
---
Oh that's no issue, I have all pet stuff bound and utilize it, it's just strange seeing the peg behave this way as I've mained a hunter since vanilla up to MOP lol. Good to know I'm not alone.
---
Awesome story. Fun fact: Fitch is in Stormwind working as an Auctioneer.

Someone needs to make a Rattle Pals guild ASAP
---
Yes I'm having that problem as well. Joined a smaller guild I thought was promising after questing a bit with the leader. I spent a good couple hours the next day trying to get people to say anything in chat, with no success. "Hello everyone" *silence* "Anyone need pots?" *silence* "Anyone need bandages?" *crickets* They didn't even have a guild Discord yet, so that wasn't the issue. I just want people to chat with while I run up and down the Barrens for the 100th time.
---
what level are you?
---
An amazingly fun quest chain, which is the precursor for the hillsberad becoming a undead territory in cataclysm.
---
It actually doesn‚Äôt. With XP off. You can farm the best equipment for your level. Easily outpacing those who can‚Äôt stop their leveling. It is why when the feature was added in wrath. They got there own battleground brackets.

Let's be honest, alliance are scum compared to horde. I have yet to encounter anyone within 10 levels of me attempt pvp and when those skull marked alliance shits do it's always in a group.
---
You have no clue what you are talking about
---
I had maxed all healing classes through several expansions and played both PoE and PvP with many, many strangers. With that in mind I want people to know that a lot of us experienced players will help new or inexperienced players out! If you're trying your best, if you're willing to listen, if you want to improve, I will carry your ass anywhere.   
---
It's antagonistic, apathetic, low-effort-high-vitriol players that I can't stand. They're snobby, they're usually not as good as they think they are, they complain way too much, and they don't care about anyone else. I will absolutely let THEM die repeatedly until they ragequit.

Hey now, not all of us alliance warlocks are this dense. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Why shield? Inner Fire, eat the damage, healer after combat.
---
Truth be told I'm on Thunderfury (pvp) and people are GD delightful.
---
Yup go for it. Like i said, Blade of Cunning can be obtained in like, 10-15 minutes, and the Hidden Enemies up to RFC can be finished in less than 30, the hardest part is running to Thunderbluff lol, but well worth it. 
---
Finding an RFC group shouldnt be hard, I did it @ lvl 12 and thousands of ppl are running it right now. 
---
BTW, while you're in UC and TB make sure you pick up a few of the RFC quests there, I think theres 2 dungeon quests for RFC in TB and one in UC, you can pick up and they give pretty good shit like some decent leather bracers and the UC quest gives really good leather pants iirc (and a ton of XP; you'll be doing RFC anyway, might as well do ALL the RFC quests not just Hidden Enemies).
---
As a Tauren I agree. Should also be able to skin Centaurs aswell. But only half of them.
---
Get trade skill master , scan the ah as often as you can . Check all the drops you get if they can sell on the ah sell them ! I've sold tons of 30s greens from 25-35 for 1-2 gold and trust me you have definitely gotten a few and probably vendored em

That situation is Vanilla out of 10

Flight point. All major cities, and a lot of random towns and villages, will have a flight path that is signified by a green exclamation point above the flight masters head. The first time you visit a city you'll have to right click the flight master to "learn" the flight path, then in the future you can fly back to that location from other flight masters for a small fee. 
---
If you're in the barrens there will be 3 flight paths for you to learn: crossroads, ratchet, and camp taurajo.
---
I think I read that the level 50 class quests aren't implemented yet, they're meant as catchup mechanics and come later.

Join the Rattle bois
---
This was the hardest thing for me to adjust to...This isn't retail. You cannot over heal in Classic. Only heal when absolutely necessary, not because they are not at 100%.
---
In vanilla and in classic I generally do DPS or Heal. I don‚Äôt particularly like tanking, and I struggled to keep threat whenever I tried. But keep a good set of healing gear (even if cloth) and you‚Äôll be fine.
---
What is funny?
---
Doesn‚Äôt have First-aid tho.  Username does not check out.
---
Uhm ... what? Warlock are crazy fast to level and should never ever have to sit and drink at all. Assuming said Warlock is not leveling with a Destruction build, of course.
---
You guys should try divinity original sin if you haven‚Äôt yet
---
Logitech provides software that lets the thumb buttons mimic your keyboard top row.  1, 2, 3 etc...  then in game your main action bar is bound to those same keys.  Then you can just use modifier binds for additional abilities like normal, bind those to like shift+1, and then use the thumb key.  It‚Äôs very easy to get used to.
---
What I do is use custom action bars arranged in a 3x4 grid on screen as a visual aid to correspond to the thumb grid.
---
Is this the first recorded victory in history for the Alliance?

Infernal has a 1 hr cooldown. Get a friend to kill it.

At rank 1 yes, but you get higher ranks as you level.

There was a post earlier today indicating that the level 50 class quests won't be released until phase 2 or 3.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d26pr7/psa_level_50_class_quests_are_not_implemented/
---
I cannot comment on the veracity of that.
---
Yes, I am a waste of time for showing different definitions of words.
---
Not in the api best you can do is a addon that estimates the health of mobs by phrasing the combat log on how much damage they take
---
I'd still argue the second DoT is stronger for PvP specifically, but Trolls have both PvE and PvP aspects that make them more versatile overall.

I got the quest last Sunday and couldn't find the npc to turn it into yesterday. Where's the banquet today for alliance?
---
I understand it becomes "worth it" at lower + healing values, but for lesser geared healers in 60 dungeons using bigger heals more infrequently will speed up your runs significantly just by not having to drink as [much.](https://much.You) You can totally spam heals for better hpm or you can sacrifice a tiny bit of hpm with bigger heals for way more time in 5sr. like I said, just my opinion and playstyle.
---
They're safe but slow solo, but can get into dungeon groups very easily and so frequently level by spamming dungeons.
---
And you're not by executing every mob?
---
Do it! 
---
But! First go to Tinker Town and pick up the quest to kill Thermaplug! You will be rewarded with pants that give you +18 Agility!

Every Hunter should be doing this tbh.

It's very middle of the pack as stated. Easy, but not as easy as a warlock.

I'm never oom, I never have any downtime, but I'm very wand-dependant.

Easy to get into groups for instances as well - people always want a priest.
---
How did you afford the mats? And what level could you be if you didn‚Äôt waste time on professions. Like 45-50
---
Yea every time I have gone it is like 50 to 1 ratio of Horde to Alliance.
---
awwww that fucking sucks. They have ruined my fun!
---
What phase does Mankrik's wife release?
---
Hmmmm what could that be
---
get to level 13, get your greater magic wand, and you won't even bother casting mind blast or smite. Their damage is just not worth it for the cast time.  At least for the next 7-10 levels. Just SW:P, PW:S/renew, and wand. You'll have zero downtime and max mana/near max health after each mob.
---
I remember back when BC came out.  Getting off the boat in Darkshore on my Draenei Shaman.  Someone walks up to me and /says:
---
"Hey." followed by "That halter top looks great on you with those crazy hot birthing hips."
---
Good times?
---
This one is a big overhaul of damage and healing numbers right?
---
I hate this stupid argument so much.  Private servers are in no way evidence that classic will last forever.  
---
You know what private servers don't have? PROBABLY THE BIGGEST AWS BILL ON EARTH AND HUNDREDS OF FULL TIME EMPLOYEES ALONG WITH A ROOM FULL OF SHARE HOLDERS TO PLEASE. 
---
Classic has to be thousands of times more popular than any private server ever was just to break even. That doesn't mean it won't succeed,  but when subscribers dwindle when naxx is old news actiblizz will absolutely not sit on its hands and hemorrhag money for an art piece.
---
I never ran BFD and have had bad luck on drops in RFK (cough Corpsemaker cough). Once I hit 36, I plan on running Armory until I get Ravager (if I can get enough guildies on) or grinding the elementals for WW axe. I've been able to get by with it so I haven't needed to go out of my way yet but it's starting to get to that point.
---
You and everyone replying here are totally correct. I have to say, though, if you‚Äôre fighting mobs 3-4 levels higher you should probably find a more appropriate area for your level.
---
Completely random from mobs of appropriate level.
---
Yes, ret aura is great for tanking. Rets can heal and tank just fine while leveling. The dungeons from 1 to 50ish are literally designed to be ran by people in dps specs. They didnt intend on people leveling up to respec just to run a dungeon. Just hold onto a couple extra pieces of gear to bank while leveling and be sure to bring lots of water, tanking and healing both require lots of drinking. Tanking especially. 
---
Dont listen to people saying the opposite, they have absolutely no clue. There are a huge number of people on reddit that have no idea what they are talking about and think you need a prot warrior to tank things like SM and ZF, it's just simply wrong. You can even tank with a 2hander just fine. Trust me. If it's your first time tanking I would let your group know though, so they will know to go a little slower to help you out a bit.
---
You sound like just a bundle of fun to raid with.

Heh, mine first shoulders was on 23lvl from quest :)
---
Right in the feels.
---
The biggest problem with druids is their itemization; everything endgame is geared solely towards healing even though they are capable of so much more. If they are judged purely on healing alone, they're meh.
---
Thus is the curse of classic hybrid classes.
---
Maybe I just got lucky but I was able to finish that in less than two hours. Granted it was a bit late at night on a week night but there were only a few other people in the area at the time so we usually got 3 mobs each when they would respawn.
---
Tomtom is great. You can set waypoints to anything and it'll guide you there so you don't have to check the map as much. Only problem is it typically wants you to do things like go straight through a mountain so you still have to check it every now and again.  It will autoset a waypoint for your corpse but you can also hold ctrl + right click on the map to set a custom waypoint to pretty much whatever
---
That's real wierd too, because that message goes in lfg not trade.
---
Half of those items you listed were hotfixed almost immediately.
---
Really? It's to simulate lag? I thought it's to save on processing power on their end.
---
What about a bald gnome with a big beard?
---
My wife keeps a notebook next to her desk and writes down the name of everyone who is a toxic asshole. When we come across them again, they receive no help from us.
---
Then there's me... clicking every spell since vanilla.
---
Trust me, you are passed that point and dont even realise it. You need a new weapon asap.
---
Benediction &gt; improved might even for ret when levelling, imo.
---
We kill so many things, why not the fish?
---
It basically just scrolls incoming on the left side of your toon and outgoing on the right. Very handy and highly customizable
---
No, it's no different here. The opposite faction can only understand basic emotes. Any text or conversation you type out only comes across as gibberish to the other faction
---
Not as a batch, no, but if you get Auctionator, it will group them and allow you make multiple purchases quicker.
---
Lower levels of renew, bubbles, and lower level heals.
---
Healing power helps a LOT here.

It‚Äôs such an infamous ledge!

You can combine macros by using form modifiers for abilities. I have maul, claw and healing touch on scroll wheel :)

the '/' opens chat...unless you have rebound it....then you can use your channel code 'r' 'p' 's' etc to talk in the proper channel.  You can also /r and tab if your talking to multiple people.

It looks like it works fine !
---
Heals. Speed stealth?

Mixed bag on Deviate Delight, horde side. Spent an hour trying to rally (with no success) a force to defend the Great Lift from some 40s ganking lowbies. Disheartening, especially on an ‚ÄúRPPVP‚Äù realm. But also had some good bait and counter ganks in Desolace with nearby randoms.

Nah, the real classic is getting on the ship, and being dumped in the ocean to drown or falling to your death between load screens.

I have a [UtechSmart Venus](https://www.amazon.com/UtechSmart-Precision-Programmable-Computer-Recommendation/dp/B00FNKMVUO/) which is has been pretty solid and laster longer by itself than two Razer Nagas that I went through and for half the price.
---
I mean, sure, you can grind anywhere you want; everything gets gold in your pocket if you don't care about how much.
---
I just don't know why OP felt the need to tell us about this spot if it isn't anything special, most people grinding gold only care about g/hr since that's the only reason they're doing it.
---
Do multiple people do this? I swear I saw this screenshot before classic released
---
Numbers too close to 1488. Sus detected.
---
There were only 3 of them in the beginning when I asked them.
---
No I didn't.
---
4% is the amount that is considered safe to withdraw from a retirement account that is invested in stuff and have the account last for 30+ years accounting for market conditions which could and probably will include recessions. If you have a terrible market your money will last just over 30 years, if you have good market over that time span it may last much longer.
---
If you were to withdraw 4% per year and weren't accounting for any sort of interest or return, then you're money would  run out in 25 years.
---
[Here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/four-percent-rule.asp) is a more in depth explanation of the 4% rule and where it comes from.
---
Also it's assumed that you're getting to that 2 million mark via investing your money and capitalizing on compound interest and market returns. Not just sticking 2 million under your mattress.
---
Also, it should be noted that 2 million mark isn‚Äôt terrible to reach either. It isn‚Äôt a number that requires you to work some crazy high value career.
---
If you started at age 22 making $20,000/year planned on retiring at age 67 invested 9% of your income in retirement, didn‚Äôt get any sort of employer matching and hit average market return and got an *average* raise of a 3% raise each year you would retire with slightly over $2 million. I know many people don‚Äôt get 3% raise per year, but this also doesn‚Äôt account for promotions, so as an average that would have you making 25k/year at age 30 and 39k/year at age 45 both of which are very reasonable numbers and actually has you under earning an average American.
---
I recognize that if you are only making 20k/year it may be hard to put aside 9% of it. Hence‚Ä¶
---
With the same assumptions if you didn‚Äôt start saving for retirement until age 30 you could hit $2 million at age 67 if you started at age 30 with a salary of $35,000/year and put away 12% of your incom
---
Heck no, finding a good leveling guild for running 5 man's together is way more fun than using /5.  Also, you want to get to know people before you BAM raid with them. Know they're not ninjas, assholes, idiots, etc.
---
im a prot pally and im pretty comfortable not holding threat on any of the mobs
---
Because healing after combat wastes time.  You have more mana than you know what to do with.
---
Because if you shield, you dont need to heal
---
This is an interesting sequence lol.
---
Unless people are grossly underleveled, no one should be getting chunked so much that they are in dire fear of being killed quickly while you time them being in a health range that maximizes efficacy of a heal.
---
Downranking pre-55 is completely unnecessary. You don‚Äôt have to keep everyone fully topped off. A rogue can be missing 5-10% of their hp between pulls, as you regen mana/drink and wait for their health to drop lower.
---
Uhhhhh
---
You don't walk backwards. You strafe. It's much slower than face tanking, but you also take much less damage than face tanking and the time isn't important because the time will be spent running regardless.
---
This is a well-known technique.
---
They are players not designers
---
Spoken like a true lobster

Cnrtl + v shows health bars. There is a setting have them cluster or stack in settings.

It's literally just copy and paste.

I swear every morning I have an existential crisis about whether or not I even need this job
---
There's a difference between lacking the resources and mismanaging them.
---
If a small company can develop with so much less resources, something's going wrong on Blizzard's end.
---
Chestnutz embodies the communal feeding of Alliance against the dirty ‚Äúgod damn horde‚Äù.  He represents what all of us, Alliance, players feel. We should all try to be like him.
---
The hell do you do to earn gold? I know you bought a fuckton of mageweave and runecloth at minimum, and undoubtedly a shitload of other stuff. That ain't cheap.
---
There is fruit.
---
Man you're truly a razer hater. Have seen a few of your comments. I, for what it's worth, have never had an issue with any razer gaming peripheral ever. Period. I don't use them anymore because I don't like the green glow most of them have, but I still have all of my old 5+ year old razer gear and it all works flawlessly.

---
had this exact conversation the other day
---
Missed opportunity to have all the hand waves be other buffs, hots, mf spam, wand blasts, etc
---
Done. Altho my server wasnt on the list (Earthfurry) so i chosed  Herod instead since i xfered from there last week.
---
Never caused problems on private servers.
---
Well, hunters are the best leveling class if you're new, and it's not just the pet - the movespeed bonus, having strong range and melee, instant cast melee abilities so no pushback, feign death, etc. all come together for a decent package of tools to help a new player keep up their pace.
---
Anyway, you can either take it a bit slower on damage/pulls for a more calm grind with mobs, or you can pull out the whole bag of tricks for maximum speed.  It sounds like you're going somewhere in between.
---
What's he gonna do, bandage his way through every quest?
---
Man I was just there for my druid aquatic form too and I didn't even notice. The weirder thing to me is I know EXACTLY where this is without having realized it consciously in game at the time
---
lol do you do this too or are you just full of love
---
Okay looks like I need to just focus on one area for questing then instead of all over the map haha
---
You don't understand how tipping works, huh?
---
Have you never noticed when people offer free enchants or whatever in chat and say "tips appreciated"? That's not asking for a tip, that's hoping for a tip, there's a difference.
---
What you're doing is not hoping for a tip after the fact, you're literally asking for payment beforehand.
---
ie.: Tips are given out of gratitude to someone, not asked by someone out of entitlement.
---
As I've already said, I tip proportionally to the chest's value. Garbage chest? Little to no tip. Decent loot (ie.: item I'll vendor)? Decent tip. BoE Rare/Epic (ie.: item I'll AH)? Big tip.
---
Imagine you go in a restaurant and the waitress asks you how much you'll tip her before she even takes your order...
---
Until instances.
---
Then you power level by abandoning quests and just following a mad mob of murder hobos, picking up all the junk they don't.
---
I have played a lot of horde and a lot of alliance and tbh it honestly feels the same to me. there are douches and pussies in both.
---
&gt;What I remember from playing the Old WoW more than a decade ago, wandering around the world during leveling and changing zones did contribute to the sense of world and adventure.
---
This is what I remember as well and wanted to repeat that. I do remember questing in both stonetalon/redridge mountains so I apparently traveld all over.
---
Okay? I wasn't making a definitive list. As in my original post, I was just talking about the general feelings of people I talk to about WoW and play with. It's an active community that's been around since Vanilla with a few hundred players, mostly hardcore raiders or former hardcore raiders. I was simply providing an example of how different people like and dislike different things about retail, and how there's a group of players who, even in they're disappointed in BfA, are not going to play Classic.
---
LOL ... why would you do that to yourself. As a Horde player, I REALLY can't stand WC and will only do it once on each character for the blue quest reward. I'd MUCH rather do Deadmines than WC.
---
Thanks yo, I throw on defensive stand and try and taunt if I see someone else dying, so I appreciate the love.
---
Amen.
---
Yes, I know this. What is bugging me is that 'enter' used to only open either /say or /p, whichever was last. Now it opens any previous chat channel, including /1 and /w.
---
I ran SM Arm last night, was clear in my posting that we already had two warriors in group going for Herod loot and we wanted a mage or lock, while I still received pms from enh shammys and hunters wanting to join, for the most part lfg understood why we wanted certain classes.  I only got mocked by one guy for turning him down because we didn't want the roll competition that my dps warrior gm and I already had.
---
Noice
---
itll be like 3 hours of them logging on at reset, getting attuned and clearing it.
---
Hope I didn't ruin your day man
---
Get her addicted to peggle. Then take it away, and offer up wow w/ a peggle addon. So she'll just have to play wow to play peggle.
---
it's ok, I dont even know what sic macro is
---
You have bested me in a game of logic, I yield.
---
i downloaded quest is and i‚Äôm in UC but i don‚Äôt see the quest. is it ‚ÄòSlaying the Beast‚Äô by chance?
---
two of my friends were definitely ganking lowbies on bigglesworth flats last night lmfao
---
AAP is amazing for Retail. They basically shit the bed for classic. And they kind of refuse to acknowledge questions or concerns. Or provide a date for an update. Hasn't been updated since 8/24. Even the AAP discord is useless, aside from random members attempting to modify their LUA and fix it themselves
---
No upvote cuz no close up of the crotchal region 
---
Why are people like you on reddit? This isnt English class. On top of that I made the comment at like 3am.
---
This all day, er-day!
---
Horde or alliance btw?
---
Lure her in on the lore.
---
You dont even have to jump
---
I'd give this idea a double plus good if only because I can /join VC and leave the unwashed masses behind until DM is actually available.
---
Cool, thanks
---
That feels accurate, my Druid is still dead somewhere in ashenvale after I rage quit from getting camped for an hour
---
Those are FUSE drivers developed by third parties. They work fine, but aren't optimal in terms of performance and require extra software to be installed (distros you install on your computer do this, but uses on a router or the like don't). They're also of somewhat questionable legality due to patents.
---
How are they not burned out
---
Phasing is cool in the sense that you can actually affect the state of the world, such as the DK starting area, or Icecrown. The latter was notorious for being awful at what you mentioned though. I hope that it gets better by being able to join your party leader's phase, similar to layering, to avoid those types of situations.
---
Blizz's ability to make the tech to match the game need has impressed me for a while. Live patching, playing with a partial install, phasing, the perspective fights like Spine of Deathwing, your character involved in cinematics, and so on.
---
and that one won't be dead in 3 months but yea

Will of the forsaken is the number 1 PvP attribute. It is literally a free PvP trinket that allows you to dispell CC

Generosity isn't doing something and expecting to get something in return. You do what you want to do, but in the end, this whole non-issue stems from the idea you have that you deserve payment and most likely your attitude when asking for said payment.
---
Thanks man.
---
Lots of tips and end-game materials. Runecloth bags/fiery weapon
---
If we're not including professions in this discussion then Arathi is a safe place for Horde. 
---
Swamp of Sorrows/Badlands beast farming is actually very popular. You can get around 7-10g/hr from these spots. 
---
STV is the higher risk/higher reward scenario. More mobs and better loot tables for some of them but obviously there's the high chance of being ganked non-stopped (if on a PvP realm).
---
Wait people actually liked Wrath?
---
I personally like playing with the old models and effects intact, but see no reason they couldn't do this. Of course you are going to get roasted by the #nochanges purists, but there's already enough changes from vanilla gone into classic and this one affects gameplay at zero level. Wouldn't mind if it was a toggle in the settings menu.
---
I have noticed, I would never have thought of doing that back in the day. Spirit rez was the last resort not the free travel power.
---
I think I heard somewhere it's phase 3, like the DMF.
---
blessing of might for the pet

Yeah, I guess I'm not used to downranking yet. That's a good point
---
In case you didn't read the OP, neither was in the right.  OP first said:
---
&gt;No plus I don't play with people from DOGZ, sorry man.
---
Basically OP blew off the guy without knowing a thing about him other than him being in a guild.  Followed by:
---
&gt;Good luck on that grind to 60!
---
This isn't really a wish of good luck but more like, "no one will ever group with you so enjoy solo play".
---
OP was a dick in the first place and was called out on it.  The other guy did go on way to long though.
---
I don't want to associate with either of these people but you definitely went to supporting OP.  You guys should play together.
---
They are. OP doesn't know his WC2 lore.
---
pretty sure at most about 1% of players even have that channel activated.
---
It's my gd birthday you fuck
---
I like this way of thinking about it. Thanks.
---
but my dps meters:/ sorry bro
---
I chose Tauren Warrior specifically for the overhand dunking attack animation.
---
Adoon doesn't work for me, bar just stays at 3/4 and never fills up or anything.
---
I don't back pedal, I turn 90¬∞ and strafe to back.  
---
I don't turn either, and use mouse to go forward so I only have to movement keys, which are s and f.
---
then I use q w e r t 1 2 3 4 z x c v a d and modifiers
---
I've had good experiences in Krom. Other than launch I only had to deal with a queue once at like 10 pm on a Saturday night I think. It usually bounces between medium and high.  I play horde on there and have had a great time.
---
Ok, I need to go back a step here. Are they really re-releasing Burning Crusade? Dont toy with my emotions
---
You will get it someday!
---
Have a look at macros some can be done still clicking just have it so x y z in one click. 
---
Simple starting point is assign mouse buttons wheel up and down you don‚Äôt need to zoom so that‚Äôs 2 u can use off the bat 
---
1-6 for skills then depending how big ur hands are and the feel start mapping things to see what fits. Don‚Äôt worry about people using this or that just use what u like and feels good
---
Only if it allows me to build a home and dig deep into the heart of Azeroth.
---
I think while leveling in open world and in combat stance it's quite ok to have Sunder Armor in 7. I personally leave it on 6 for combat stance. When I'm tanking combat stance is only for charge, and hence sunder armor is 1 in the def stance bar. I'm saying what I do with my warrior, but just so you know I never got a warrior to lvl 60 &amp; raiding so it's not like this is a pro opinion lol.

---
&gt;To those saying that corpse camping is terrible honor: it doesn‚Äôt matter. Honor per rank is all relative...Therefore, in phase 2, all that will matter is that you are getting more honor than other players.
---
Your argument is "it doesn't matter if corpse camping will be an inefficient honor farm method, because everyone will want to use the most efficient honor farm method.
---
Horde on Sulfurus also, it seems like we come out on top 90% of the time in world PvP. Everyone really embodies the spirit of "For The Horde!!".
---
Get an addon like [Character Notes](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info17406-CharacterNotes.html) and/or [Global Ignore List](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=25034). Then share your experience(s) with others. Eventually, these type of players will not be able to get into groups.
---
Okay cool, thank you
---
Be careful with BoE blues that are not BiS for twinking. Those will not increase in value much.
---
I saw a slappy run through the oasis in the barrens and get shrekt by the Centaur. I go ahead and rez him and guess what he does? He runs back through and dies again without saying thank you. 
---
If you're out there reading this - i hope you enjoyed your run back to your corpse, slappy.
---
Rogue is definitely above the other three, but easily behind the other 5. Downtime kills them, they struggle vs. any mob higher level than them with miss/dodge/parries, no self healing, the only move speed bonus is sprint, and they struggle against any multi-mob pulls, and have weak multi-target damage.
---
It spawned Grizzly Hills, the best zone in the entire game if only because of the music üò§
---
On the like, grand scale I guess? But there are still open skirmishes happening, particularly in Kalimdor. Ashenvale is one of these places where the Horde and Alliance are in open warfare. Arathi too.
---
Exactly! Hopefully we'll meet on the battlefield for an honoroble fight.
---
WoW is a good gateway to itself imo.
---
Im going to have to agree with futterecker here. I clearly remember getting the new eviscerate and it doing nearly twice the damage as the previous. Ive read multiple articles telling you not to slice and dice until you get rank 2. This puts you eviscerating instead. If youre combat and pulling 2 mobs with blade flurry The eviscerate damage becomes really important.  Your arent going to have AR up every time you do this. The sinister strike damage is a pretty big deal too. It adds nearly half the damage of your weapons even up to the 40s.
---
They don't have jobs, families, or outside responsibilities. Once upon a time I also could play games for 14 hours a day and sleep for the other ten. 
---
Now I have obligations, as do most other Classic players.
---
As alliance you guys started it! I was minding my business doing an escort quest from Darkshore to Ashenvale when a hunter ganked me. Couldn‚Äôt you guys wait til after I finished the escort? Lol
---
Kinda sounds like you're the dick in this situation. Unless they advertised as a speed clear what's wrong with the rest of the group doing dungeon quests that take place in the area outside the instance?
---
Any for alliance?
---
Also OP is name shaming... so two wrongs on OP.  Keep defending that character though.
---
You can make a lot off of tips. I was tipped 2g last night for making some dude 4 runecloth bags. It adds up quick
---
We have so many other spells to use though why would anyone bother with Rend.
---
i want this but thats some random site ive never seen and dont feel like downloading something from it. can someone else take the risk and let me know how it goes.
---
Strong, ez, smooth.
---
Dude, I just said I was explaining why screech is considered good.
---
Did you not read that part?
---
I agree. Played as rogue in vanilla. As long you're smart with pulls and have cd ready, it was cake.
---
I'm leveling a priest now, do have to say I can solo multiple mobs at once and not even close to dying. Just need to drink a bit after.
---
totally cool to be playing for nostalgia but super weird to not play with your friends over what letters are in your characters name
---
It will just say me makes some strange gestures or something
---
Saw a Frostitute on Incendius too!
---
Wanna know if Hammerfell ever founds those 2M.
---
neither one, pve server lul
---
I‚Äôd completely forgotten that people play alliance for a brief moment there apparently lol
---
thats pretty dope
---
I killed hogger hard and i invited all the low levels around
---
Never said it wasn't.
---
If we're going to compare with restaurants, how would you feel if a waitress asked you how much you were going to tip her, or even worse asked you for a specific amount of tip, before she even took your order?
---
That's why it's unreasonable.
---
It's up to the client to tip based on how satisfied he was with the service receive, usually proportionally with the value of the meal.
---
You're asking for a flat rate, before you unlock the chest, that's not expecting generosity for a job well done, that's entitlement.
---
How much have whelplings been going for on your server? Have they actually been selling? I keep seeing them listed for 100s of gold but can‚Äôt help but feel there aren‚Äôt any actually being transacted
---
Go clean your room.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to be able to predict a market. We can estimate from vanilla but I have a feeling it won‚Äôt quite be the same. Especially when bg‚Äôs come out and everyone‚Äôs going to be undercutting to try and offload their BiS.
---
Why would we ask, it's obvious he doesn't
---
Easy to minimize downtime with first aid and target selection, so I have a hard time slotting them behind the tireless wand spam of Priests. Behind Hunters, Druids and Warlocks, I concur.
---
the layers are for the entire server. changing zones does not change layer
---
I've got the same experience. Started using one during 3.0, and that sucker lasted all the way into Legion before dying on me. Replaced it with a G600 just cuz I got a better deal on it.
---
Okay my friend I believe you
---
No idea. Seems highly possible though.
---
Oh yeah!
---
Notice it says "1-10" there? You don't make starting zones for "flavor".
---
I hate warlock who just spam life tap instead of drink( when they are out of combat), and I have to heal them up and drink. Before you say "why do you heal them? they can life drain", well yes but sometime they are dumb enough to cast rain of fire and pull down the aggro from the tank.
---
Classic is my first real experience of WoW and I'm loving every minute of it. Just hit level 25 :D  
---
But...Borderlands 3 drops soon. I also play other games like Smite on the regular. I don't know what to do about my schedule :(
---
If you pay the fuck attention it's easy
---
Hey-- asses are gender neutral!!
---
:( 
---
Sad. A gay game BF would be dope. Id just have to outsource butt picd

Might also be a reference to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17_Again_(film)

Well done little lion.

What?

what addon do you use to see movement speed etc?
---
Ska more character info

 ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú◊ô?

Chill unconfirmed.

I‚Äôll admit to popping a ‚Äúwhat server are we on again?‚Äù As I leave trade chat
---
You used to able to do this in vanilla just by using a hex editor. So you could make it look like you had any gear you wanted, but only for what you looked at client side. Back in the day a lot of files were client side which allowed for some pretty crazy "hacks." But really it was just some advanced hex editing. Some of the big ones were removing the gate in warsong gultch so you can just run right through as it didn't exist in your game. 
---
This reminds me of when my friend went on the PTR back in the day and leveled a priest for mind control. He hex edited all of his terrain to be a few feet lower so everyone looked like they were standing above him. So he would go to org as an alliance and start mindcontrolling people from underground which would then give their character the physics of their own client. Thus dropping them under the world. He could run them around as long as the MC was active but once it was done they would fall forever. This was before blizzard put in "bottoming out" where you would die from falling under the world. So the only way to get your character unstuck from this infinite fall was to ticket a GM or get summoned by a lock.
---
Pretty messed up, but also really funny.
---
I had a bit of trouble because all I was seeing was tons of fly by night guilds with dumb names spamming chat non stop. The I ended up running RFK with a friendly dungeon group. One other shaman, two warriors, and a priest healer. As expected every physical damage class wanted the badass axe that drops from to he second boss. We ended up farming that boss like 15.times until everyone got their axe just for the hell of it. The priest didn't really get any drops so we all agree to give him our cloth drops (there was a lot) for his tailoring. A couple of them were in the same guild and seemed like a cool lot so I asked for an invite.
---
I know cleave sucks for tanks while leaving but isn't swipe better than roar? Which has a high threat per rage?
---
PDAnet was blocked but not my phone's tethering.
---
Water walking and ghost wolf are a hell of a combo.
---
I guess that's the difference between you and me. I'll happily lose a bit of gold so that 9-39 other people can have a giggle. My guildy's enjoyment of raid night is worth more to me than a half hour of grinding some mats that I'd probably be doing anyway.
---
Blizzard is kind of stuck, here. People want #nochanges but they also want the game to *seem as hard* as they remember it seeming. But if this is an honest recreation of 2005, and it seems like it pretty much is, what are they supposed to do without changes? AOE is to strong and mobs are too weak. I'm not in love with this meta. I came into this ready to sword and board a single target at a time with perfect CC and I find that style of clear more engaging. But cleaving and chaos are flat-out better and ordinary players are capable of playing that way.
---
&gt; it may be because 20 people are camping one named mob 
---
100 times this. Guns of Northwatch, the peasant quests in Hillsbrad. There are so many of these that I've seen camped by 3-5 FULL groups of players. I have better stuff to do than sit around for 10-minute respawn timers for an hour+. If you can get on during off-hours, it's usually cleared up, otherwise skipping the quest is almost always going to be better from an XP/hr standpoint and just a general better use of your time.
---
nah bro, me and others that have experienced are not renewing our subscription until Blizzard does something about it... I have almost 1,500 games on Steam so I'm good to go 
---
ps: it's toxic trolls like you that ruining the game and you are one the ones that abuse the Report Player function

The new filter options have a filter that removes all gui elements. Works on classic.

Dude according to google there is an engineering supplier that is a bag but I could not find it for the life of me.

I'll have some fries with that salt please

Please send me the not noob guides.
---
Gosh, if only I'd been alive to play WoW in 2004 at the age of 29, I wouldn't need this ridiculously condescending rant to tell me "the way it was". Alas.
---
I'm aware people min-maxed in Vanilla. They min-maxed in the games preceding it, too. Min-maxing wasn't invented in recent years. It was just a lot harder to do in 2004-2005, with limited resources and an extremely underdeveloped understanding of both the game and the genre. Hardly anyone even MADE it to Naxx, let alone walked into the game on day one with an ironclad comprehensive understanding of every last i to dot and t to cross along the way. And latency being what it was, and computers being what they were, and add ons being where they were at, the content was functionally more difficult. We didn't have an intervening decade and change of Mythic + and Mythic Raiding to contrast against it. Now, it's trivially easy. There is no NEED to min-max it. But people will anyway.
---
&gt;The saying in vanilla was "the game doesn't start until lvl 60". 
---
No that became the saying, and particularly calcified in BC with "raid or die", and the ceaseless arguments between people who wanted an endlessly tiered end game and those who did not. The content at 60 wasn't "boring and tedious" at the time, because we barely understood it and hadn't seen anything like it before. Virtually everyone playing Classic today has probably walked through those raid instances solo a dozen time, and engaged in modern raids...which are mechanically far more engrossing and challenging. 
---
So, I don't know what your perception of "my mentality" is, but if it helps, my mentality is that Vanilla WoW's long, raid-soaked end game is the least compelling part of it and the least likely to hold up well in direct comparisons with its retail counterpart. It's also where power creep started settling in, a long term disease that eventually completely fucked the game's scaling and all but broke its underlying RPG mechanics outside of whatever the latest expansion or patch was.
---
It was mostly tongue in cheek :P
---
Yeah this. I already have 5-6 pieces each of my pre raid BIS prot and fury gear. The exp is not amazing, but I'm way ahead of my guild, which are mostly 40-50, while there are about 10 of us at 57-60. By the time they're ready to do what I'm doing, I'll be the geared to the teeth tank and help gear them all up for MC in a week or so. We've been doing arena / Emp runs in BRD, full LBRS clears, and tonight we're doing Strat. LBRS was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Yeah, those orcs hit fast when enraged, and they do hit for 200+ per hit, but with nearly 5K health as a level 48 with a good bit of +defense and 6K armor... pfft. Easy.
---
That's why I said **pooling rage for**; e.g. pull one mob, sunder it to death, and pool rage to pull 2 mobs next so that you start out rage positive rather than neutral in order to SS+Cleave them down easier. It's the standard Arms questing tactic once you reach 30 (supplementing Cleave with Whirlwind at 36).

It‚Äôs good while leveling since you should not level MM, so no aimed shot. Though the 1.6 speed would still get annoying with repositioning and chewing through arrows.

&gt;I‚Äôm sorry you couldn‚Äôt come up with anything.

And this shows that you're no different than the OP or the guy OP refused to group with.
---
&gt;Unless it turns out that a raid full of Mage and Warlock AOE, with a handful of tanks and healers, ends up dominating?
---
I don't think you want too many warlocks due to the dot limit. Mages are really good though and it's common to see raid groups stacked with mages.
---
oh shit my bad i read the first part in the link and no further lol
---
You need less reddit politics and more Azeroth in your life my friend.
---
Who sells the recipes?
---
I‚Äôll probably never know this feeling. Currently level 37 and using thermapluggs arm. The upgrade will be either ravager or bonebiter

You can choose to ignore the escort.

TIL 60% of the population isn't a good enough sample size. Oh boy are scientists the world over in for a bad day!
---
/who is not layer locked, according to a blue post the other day when they called out people bitching about layer exploits. It sees up to 50(?) people in a zone, regardless of which layers those people are in.
---
Back to sample sizes - [here's a calculator for you.](https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm) An **incredibly strong** sample size for a population of 100k would be 14k. But you think a sample size of 67k for a single server isn't good enough?
---
I was telling my friends my void can‚Äôt hold aggro and they were convinced I was doing something wrong. Glad to know I‚Äôm not the only one
---
Every dungeon group I have to tell the healer:
---
/p  "hey, yeah don't worry about my health unless the mob is actively wailing on me. I'm just gonna be life tapping a bit".
---
Life Taps. Get's full heal.
---
/w no seriously, don't worry about healing me. Save your mana.
---
Warlock is a few levels above me, makes mistakes, no one helps either of us. I thought it was a fun clip to share of me beating down a high level and then killing the person that didn't help him. Take it easy man, not every video has to be nothing but sick engineer reflect kills and grenade predictions lol
---
Certainly, I'd love to see a zone actually built around the use of flying.
---
Then again, that's basically what Vash'jir was, and people hated it.

this was an emotional rollercoaster.

i thank you

That's smart I went with my main professions and man I regret it haha.

What's the benefit to a tallstrider pet? I thought they kinda sucked

Pah, learn the warrior true skill way:

Charge, harmstring, jump, turn to get hit from the front, intercept, harmstring, miss, dodge, daze, spirithealer.
---
I need this recipe
---
&gt;You run Naxx because its fun?
---
You overestimate how fun raids are after you've cleared them already. I personally never enjoyed the "farm" portion of it.
---
&gt;and the rest of raid may need gear?
---
For what?
---
Cool but tell me how to get tmorph or an equivalent running &lt;3
---
That moment when you'd rather wait 20mins for your hearthstone cd, than attempt clearing/corpse running.
---
What server do you play on? As a leveling warrior I oftentimes feel people assume I‚Äôm a selfish prick or an asshole.
---
One can hope.
---
Damn!
---
I started on day 7 or 8, I can't remember which because I started in the early hours of the morning, and I'm over 5days 6hours /played so far. :/

I went from depression sleeping all day every day to getting out of bed the minute I woke up just so I could log in. lol

20-30 I believe.

So after 15 years, you're the first one to think of this?

Lots of games have daily or weekly (depending on popularity) question megathreads default sorted by new.   I dont know why something like that wouldn't be perpetually pinned right now.

I am the same way, I level solo a good deal and buy my upgrades to stay ahead of the mobs. I tend to never have money or, when I go to town, tend to find things for leveling to spend my money on.
---
There's really no way to regulate this.  It wasn't regulated back in 2004-06 and it certainly won't be today.  As much as I like immersion on my RP non-PVP server, there are those who don't care about the RP and just want on because you can log on quicker than any other queue, and they are more than welcome to do their thing on it as long as it directly doesn't affect me.
---
Besides, if you *really* want to split hairs here, if you *really want to be "fully immersed" in the RPG,* turn off Names above everyone's head.  Identify your friends by looks alone.  *Ask* people their names in character and remember them.  Don't rely on the bubble above their head.
---
To be fair I feel like UC is less multi level. There‚Äôs a central ‚Äútower‚Äù with 2.5 floors, and then the remaining 90% is two concentric rings.

Thanks for the info. I played alliance long ago so I am unaware of what the shaman abilities do. I 100% know that they were using their interrupt. I assumed it was doing a good amount of threat. Which again is tough because I almost always landed my shield bash at the same time and using both is a waste.
---
Or just keep it pinned and default sorted to new, like other game subreddits do.
---
My (pally) priest friend and I have been doing this for a while now. We haven't grouped in STV though so it probably wasn't us. We've done it 10+ times so far and was always appreciated, except for by one hunter who decided to attack us afterwards. He didn't have our buffs for very long...
---
Horde are ugly and they don't have flips. I need flips in my life! I could make do with the twists of blood elves but alas I cannot be a blood elf.

On TSM, Auctioneer likes to take its sweet time.

Newsflash: The LFG addon as it was supposed to work at first was also possible exactly like that in vanilla, so technically deactivating parts of it ARE changes.
---
Pets have a base crit% of 5% and 10% with talents in BM spec.
---
You are trying to taking solid numbers and compare them to random numbers.
---
You are depending on a 1-10 chance to get a 30% attack speed boost, on a pet that already does subpar damage range. The best benefit from Frenzy is spell pushback.
---
At least he gets it back :P would not recommend EVE if you think cod scams are bad :D
---
How are you not the founding Guild Master of this guild??
---
For solo content I recommend using power word shield - mind blast - shadow word pain - then wand. You can add in another mind blast usually when the mon is around 25%.
---
It's acceptable to purchase upgrade wands if they aren't too expensive (less than 1g). 
---
When grouping. Downranking isnt worth it before  the high 40s, so use flash heal and heal. Dont shield warriors as it will interfere with their rage generation.
---

I started using Excel in middle school. It's seriously one of the best pieces of software ever made and it just keeps getting better.

Just outside IF
---
Your definition of fun and there‚Äôs may differ.
---
I think his point was that people with less time will **always** progress through the game slower than people with more time, but when the game also obfuscates systems (in this case questing), that person is having to spend more of their limited time simply figuring out where to go/what to do, which doubles down on the issue.
---
I know
---
Well I was 13 at the time and had no idea what adding were. I was unaware. Also my nochanges remark was 100 sarcasm.
---
If you have to stop moving (you do) people aren't gonna do it lmao.
---
Whirlwind‚Äôs a long questline, if you get comparable weps it all works out!
---
Haha. I was in a chain of 5 of us yesterday and we were all headed to the same spot. Great way to pass the time.
---
My wife dated a guy in college where literally all he did was play WoW. No job, no school, no showers, nothing.
---
I'm lucky she let me get back into classic.
---
Boy do I have a former dwarven King for you to meet
---
So do I, at least when dealing with trash mobs.   Wanding doesnt use up your mana.   And its better than just standing there waiting for the next healing opportunity.
---
Also, for the record, if people dont like how raiding is in vanilla COOL THEY CAN GO BACK TO RETAIL! Like I give a shit about those people. They can play wow mobile and spend hundreds of dollars a month buying gold. Fuck em.
---
You're going to make a lot of locks cry if we exclude them too.
---
I've already seen about 10 hunters with humar on my realm lol.
---
God I‚Äôve missed the nifty stopwatch. Still have it in my bank on retail.
---
I got my Mrs. to play some playstation games with on "date nights" as my choice activity and tried to make it fun for her / us. I feel it definitely helped as well I am very involved with gaming and streaming ect. I shared podcast 115 from Countdown to Classic with her, there is a part in the episode where a couple talks about how they ended up playing together. She enjoyed listening to ALSO she wanted to hear the follow up portion of the pod cast then wanted to take the personality test they talked about... so it was a great conversation starter about it.  [https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/07/31/episode-115-the-calm-before-the-storm/](https://countdowntoclassic.com/2019/07/31/episode-115-the-calm-before-the-storm/)   
---
My Mrs. is not a gamer but she has said she is willing to play some with me so maybe... that could help you as well.... but remember make it a thing for both of you not just oyu playing and her sitting there not knowing anything.  GOOD LUCK !
---
i didn't imply that you couldnt do well. i just meant it in general.
---
Discuss with the group. It's a bit unfair imo to be able to sample from the leather table and still have the mail loot table usually all to yourself, but - Hunters gotta hunter
---
Enchants and weapons man
---
They were horde, wortog and i cant remember the others pc name
---
Your username is too familiar. Do you play Xbox?
---
Yeah, they should ban for BFA gold but it should be OK as long as it's runescape.
---
Pretty much if you arent so misogynistic to think women cant play VGs- then you"ll be well rewarded with an exceptional lady ass pics.
---
Man, it's day 15, ton's of guilds have fully cleared all the raid content, and here I am only level 3! Loving every minute of it though!
---
It's a shame their T2 is borderline useless.
---
What more hunter bugs exists?
---
Transmog is probably my favorite thing about retail. But like the guy above me said, it takes away from the classic experience
---
Well edit it so people can make sense of your question and you can find an answer.
---
Absolutely. Some of the hunter BiS gear on phase 1 is leather gear
---
I regret to inform you that it is not. Tried it as soon as I got there the first time, and the ghost door is now a real door : /
---
How does a joke about shitty circa 2004 pet models in Classic have nothing to do with Classic?
---
Feign death.
---
they generated gold, but they were also tied to a reputation that gave rewards in terms of items (one in particular that was very good) and access to the heroic version of a dungeon that dropped crazy good loot for a 5 man.
---
it's similar to how i view the flying mount issue: it's bad, but not a massive problem that completely ruins tbc. the issue lies where it inevitably takes the game, but in tbc maybe it's only 10% of what it ends up being later on in the game.
---
as far as tbc goes, daily quests are by far the least problematic of the three issues i listed, though.
---
Oh yeah I killed wortog more than once haha he was one of their few 40+
---
og blizzard devs were memers confirmed
---
I‚Äôll be joining ya on that same boat from Portland. Cheers to this incoming winter season of Warcraft
---
Yep, you got it.
---
You could even do something like:
---
    /cast [mod:shift,@mouseover,harm,nodead][mod:shift] Gouge; [@mouseover,harm,nodead][] Kick
---
That would cast Gouge if you're holding shift and press the button, or Kick if you just press the button by itself.
---
The game allows anyone to roll need in classic.
---
Wands can often be higher DPS than smite, especially if you consider cast delays and if you do take wand spec.
---
Yes same user name
---
Who actually is enough of a virgin to report players names?? Unless it‚Äôs racist then I just find it funny.
---
Feral is ok dps especially post 32 with ferocious bite. 
---
Do you spam wrath or star fire?
---
I can DM foot photos with the date on it to prove my cis womanhood.
---
Also if you like feet- i can take more photos too. Ill even sit on my feet in a thong!
---
Yea, I think a lot of people don't realize that DW adds an additional 19% chance to miss for both weapons. Unaffected by your SS and other abilities, sure. But when most of your damage is white hits, is an off-hand weapon, doing 50% damage, worth going from 5% miss to 24% miss on your main hand too?
---
You are still misinforming everyone leveling a warrior. You‚Äôre arguing that heroic strike is less rage efficient than sunder armor - maybe so, considering that hs overrides your rage generating ability. But the goal of leveling is to kill stuff fast. And I haven‚Äôt seen any information that proves that sunder would do that in the least. 
---
As a warrior, minimizing down time is the most important part of leveling. Hence why killing something fast is far more important than having to create spreadsheets to prove out rage efficiency.
---
See, I agree with you.
---
My main critique was more to do with tone and feel of the game. It's just personal opinion, but I've always found that doing these odd Wailing Caverns runs where you spend a lot of time dispatching of a small band of cultist who are casting a spell to ruin an area was a lot more rewarding than the constant "save the world" thing. Because the emotional impact of it for me died with the Lich King, after that it's just another Big Bad World Ender. There is no catharsis. That's why I've always been an altoholic, because I loved these intimate small scale stories rather than grand epics, where everything you do up to that point is just busy work to get levels. 
---
But as you've said, they should make quest lines more befitting a multi time world saviors because after you defeat the Burning Legion on another planet going back to killing wolves that are killing a farmers flock of chickens is just so meh.
---
Night elves are trolls who were exposed to the moonwell.
---
One more, tell me an rpg that doesnt have power creep rofl. Why else would you play an rpg. To role play? Even in DnD there is power creep. That's why so many people play high lvl DnD campaigns, to skip all the weak levels lol.
---
Red path is what it takes blue is what it could do kek
---
It‚Äôs allowed in most games because it‚Äôs not RMT
---
Like trading between PoE leagues or old diablo leagues when trading mattered. You can also trade gold between two different servers on classic or retail.
---
All at your own risk of being scammed, but it‚Äôs not against TOS
---
I think Corsair's Overshirt should last till whenever.

As someone from Northern Wisconsin....can relate.

We can eat tauren as well.

Pretty sure we‚Äôre friends on there. Krazy Ninja III lol
---
Stop running like a fucking tiger so I can target you while you're in range.
---
This is correct. The random generator is not ‚Äúpure random‚Äù, it is an alghorithm deriving a number based on a dynamic variable such as a time stamp.
---
Total badass. I think the weapon Cenarius gave him made him more powerful and he made the axe more powerful the more he fought.
---
I like to think this created a feedback loop that made him scary strong after killing a mountain of demons.
---
Fucking damn it. Do you have any idea how many times I've clicked my macro for it?
---
Does whistle work correctly?
---
Of course he would, that‚Äôs the Classic WoW way!
---
On the bright side, at least you dont have to deal with several feet of snow and -40.
---
Yeah but they‚Äôre not actually scanning for that stuff are they? And again, thanks but you‚Äôre not telling me how to get it.
---
pw:s stops pushback and if most of your damage isn't the wand, then you're just fucking everything up. you can't kill shit any faster than pulling with holy fire, mind blast x1, sw:p, wand to death
---
with average gear the mob will die when swp is at 0-5 seconds. 
---
why in the hell you wanna stop pushback is beyond me. you're not casting with a mob on your except that first mind blast (and that's only if you're too stupid to pull from 35-40yds away to start with)
---
I use 1 2 3 4 5 e f g v r t q. Shift and control variants of each. 3 full bars of bindings.
---
Depends on what level this is, post 30 you just become one with the rage and pain.
---
Agreed, then it would just add another layer to PVP instead of breaking it entirely.
---
If the boat ain't at the dock when you get there, its simply faster to just swim between.
---
If you do this your moms a hoe
---
Only had some resist in the last room and path going down to the boss room, was mainly an issue for the tank because of taunt resist sometimes but he still managed it pretty fine, we had a ret pally help him by off tanking a few mobs sometimes and as dps we just had to be more careful (as a warlock resist aren't a big deal, my main damage source is dot and a resist just mean i wasted a gcd)
---
Almost everything before that part was yellow so it was very smooth.
---
The only really challenging part was the boss, the ret tanked the adds while we were on the boss and we managed to kill him before the healer was oom (was pretty close but still we did fine)
---
Wouldn't be so poor if you had place for all the vendor junk. That shit adds up man.
---
Thank you for standing up for the lowbies just trying to be left alone.
---
Seems highly improbable, good luck not getting scammed lol
---
Moonfire, pretty much spam different ranks of it.
---
Yeah have that and they still do not respond immediately right now.
---
What level is this zone? It looks like a good one to explore!
---
There is so much being flooded to the AH on all servers that prices are super low. Spent 2 hours this morning farming stoneskin eels only to find out they are 30s/stack on my server.
---
As a rogue, I will definitely try to make you feel like you shouldn't roll, but you totally should.
---
This is my guilty pleasure, yesterday I did the run from stv to swamp of sorrows and I buffed so many low level ally in duskwood! Most of them freak out and try to attack or run but I got a couple thank you emotes, until the 3 people I had just buffed hanged up on me when a guard start attacking me D:&lt;
---
Yeh sorry not done EK yet, I did mention in the title.
---
Just let them die lol. When DPS get over zealous and dont wait before they start AOE I let them die and type out that it was their own fault.
---
Gotcha.
---
Yessss!
---
&gt;Mark a target with a skull and you won't have to worry about dps hitting the wrong dude either, for the most part.

If only that wasn't a colossal lie.

Please share a link about how to get it working for classic (if there is a classic compatible version)
---
Fair enough, but IMO just as bad are the people who spend all their time blasting Retail, often over things that aren't even true or years out of date.
---
Yeah people leaving a group immediately without even saying bye is something different from my vanilla experience. I mean there were toxic people back in vanilla, but they were usually people who didn't plan to get very far or they were only into pvp. The couple times I had items ninjad from me in vanilla those people never seemed to log in again after that.
---
It was indeed that setting. You can really notice how well you kite especially if you try without Concussive Shot. I'm now always able to get 1 extra shot in without using CS that would normally "almost" shoot before entering my deadzone. My only complaint with this setup is that sometimes it skips sounds/animations, but still does the damage. I'm guessing it's going too fast for the game.
---
Alliance on Blaumeux, I've actually ran a dungeon with him. He's a super good player. 
---
I like this server so far, people generally like taking fair fights and I've only been ganked like twice.
---
Litterally why I rolled lock, fml
---
It most certainly is up for debate. You see the things posted in-game, on the forums, and on this subreddit. It's not hard to see, if you aren't biased.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs pretty much common practice. If you don‚Äôt unlock a chest because you lose a roll you‚Äôre just a dick
---
I'll have to give it a shot someday, thx.

like it or not.. it's part of the game and it should be

Not come across that addon before, what does it do ?

Pet pathing is sometimes very... interesting. In gnomeregan my bear was unable to walk under an archway in the Electrocutioner 6000 area. Just kept teleporting up and down the cliff, throught I was gonna aggro the entire instance
---
Bleeds like garrote and rupture will hurt warriors the most. So keep those applied while not getting hit.
---
&gt;I'd say as long as it's better than what you have ~~and nobody else needs it~~, go for it.
---
if its an upgrade, it's an upgrade. There is no bonus in all mail gear (other than the extra armor) As far as dps goes, there are plenty of good leather pieces for hunters and warriors
---
Its all levels. If I can get a rogue to unsub at 59 its a feat of strength. 
---
If anything 40+ warriors and rogues should be camped by top level clothies because those are the ones that might just make it.
---
Loser gnome got shown his place.
---
completely wrong. you 100% want spirit tap and you 100% want wand spec, it's also just as fast to kill shit with a mostly disc spec unitl level 40 when you get shadowform and shadow pulls ahead. 
---
priests benefits are 0 downtime because wand spec makes it the highest dps ability you have. smite is a waste of time and mana, holy fire is good only on the pull, mind blast once is fine but only once or you're losing dps casting when  you should be wanding. 
---
spriests have worse survivability and the same or even less damage on melee mobs (pushback while casting after PWS is down makes them inferior to disc with wand spec)
---
Yep. Movement is Q, W, E. Keeps things simple.
---
As a tank I do this on purpose, your time spent drinking means I have time to generate threat .
---
I chain pull until I see healer is OOM
---
This is the preferred method, I believe.
---
You act as if 10 minutes is a lot of time when setting up an addon.
---
Yeah, the general idea is to bleed them and then kite them with crippling poison, keeping them outside of melee range but too close for them to charge.
---
If I'm not sure, I play them both.
---
Nah went through wc and had to dismiss my pet 3 times jumping so he didn‚Äôt do something stupid...only 1 was to the boss serpentis and everliving
---
I sold for 60s each the first week but as time went by and there were more players levelling engineering, supply was growing faster than demand
---
People aren't willing to pay 95s for that, especially something so fucking easy to find and make
---
No, too much alliance
---
As a warrior I died so many times trying to get Fizzles claw in Thunder Ridge. Was infuriating to say the least. Still trying to figure out what class I actually want to play though. Giving mage a go now.
---
I believe you could rep grind all of the dungeons with tabards too. I did very few dailies in BC.
---
It says that ingame benefits won't apply.  Where does it specifically indicate what is and isn't an ingame benefit?  Gametime isn't an ingame benefit?
---
The title says trading gold between BFA and classic.
---
&gt;"Hey, I'll give you 100k gold in BFA if you give me 100g on Classic!"  
---
&gt;"Make it 150k and you got a deal!"
---
This. Or vice versa, "Trading 200g for 200k on retail (server x)! Pst!"
---
My undead mage would take a second look at you. Kudos for making your gear look good. Mine looks like my character shopped at a thrift store.
---
If you continue the grind like that you'll get burned out and not want to play anymore anyway.
---
I mean... isn‚Äôt extreme an extreme use of the word extreme for the subject matter of open form speech?
---
Can we talk about how pets don‚Äôt attack mobs as they‚Äôre running toward you if you aggro? They just run next to them
---
There's Harvest Fruit as well.
---
This existed in gnomer back in vanilla and was never fixed iirc. Essentially, gnomer was the most horrifying thing I had to do as a hunter back then.
---
to blow, this opportunity only comes once in a lifetime
---
Definitely does, it was as "short" for over an hour (which when you hover says &gt;30 min)
---
Also, after some back and forth bids it hit medium for a second (30-2hours) then went to short again
---
cya
---
Nugenergy?
---
I fixed mine by turning v-sync and G-sync off. I also unchecked the FPS limits in the advanced system setting within game.
---
You've been fighting bad warriors, warriors are the deadliest class next to rogues when facing a hunter.
---
How do you escape charge, hamstring root, intercept?
---
Consistent builds are more popular than random proc builds. 
---
I like screech.
---
Frenzy is good too, better on cats and really good for pvp. 
---
IDK what else to say.
---
At level ten, that sounds normal for how many mobs you can pull. Fight 1-2 mobs, heal up, regent mana, rinse and repeat.
---
if you look closely, you will see that this guy is actually the #1 NA warrior
---
You mean an addon that shows you when your energy ticks?  I'd like to know as well.
---
You act as if everyone wants to reconfigure their entire UI to have the functionality of a single addon...
---
I get ganked like this all the time from parties of 5 horde on Kromcrush. It happens on both sides.
---
I count at least 2-3 threads about warlocks and life tapping every day. I had no idea when I rolled a warlock that it would be this controversial.
---
Trust me I run back and forth to the vendor a lot. Sure I‚Äôve Probly missed out on 25-50s but I‚Äôve prioritized my professions which should make bank right now on what I have in the AH
---
Nah lvl 5 for disenchanting.
---
Go to YouTube and do a search on classic classes
---
Both are cool
---
We used to do this back in Vanilla but it was mostly geared warriors tanking with a 2hander . 
---
It‚Äôs more popular now because back then there wasn‚Äôt 100 sources of efficient gameplay on twitch to get tips from .  There were few sources for high level players to share advice including mIRC channels and what not. 
---
Also the advanced patch of classic makes the content a lot easier as you can see from guilds already killing rag pre sons phase . Lot of the gear is better itemized and talents better suited.
---
Q,E strafe is bad because in all other games you usually use wsad for so many years my muscle memory is used to wsad. Changing it to q,w,e only for wow and playing wow + other games constantly switching the movement keys is impossible and you will make mistakes all the time.
---
STV pvp?
---
Try SM pvp.
---
Faerlina must be 70-30 in favor of Horde i swear.
---
wtf is this shit
---
Alright, don't take this personally but I'm beginning to suspect you're something of a moron. Probably best we cut our losses on this discussion now.
---
Badlands isn't a random flight path tho, its the closest to blackrock for lots of endgame content
---
Same with Stocks shit
---
I‚Äôm running holy/disc priest and it‚Äôs really easy to solo. My rotation is:
---
Holy fire - shadow ward pain - wand 4 times - holy fire - wand.
---
Ensure you are reapplying your bubble every time you can. 
---
I can take on mobs that are at least 4 levels higher than myself with no downtime.
---
The best thing about BFA was the trailer.
---
My husband and I used to play only pvp servers (both factions). I 100% of the left the other faction alone because it's just not my style to be bitch like that. Now if I was jumped, it was on.
---
Not faulting others for ganking or participating in world pvp though, it's in the game for a reason and if you don't like it you shouldn't be on a pvp server lol.
---
I'm on a PvP server as well, and people generally leave each other alone. Even in STV and Shimmering Flats. Not that I care; if they only leave me and my brother alone, then it's fine, which they do, because we'll fuck them up if they don't.
---
Sometimes the runs are really easy for the healer though.  Ive had healers tell me to go nuts.
---
Human mage is slightly worse than a gnome mage from a performance view.
---
As for The actual difference you have a stronger class in the mage both pvp and pve, you are also more than welcome to every single group for your amazing aoe, cc and st dmg.
---
Hunters however have the easiest lvling and a solid endgame aswell as pvp. Kinda gear dependant and to hard to master with different pets and ranks of skills, shoottimers etc. Id say mage if you wanna be the most desired and hunter if youre lookin for a smooth ride solo.
---
Thanks alot.
---
I think you can buff enemies in classic. New possibilities!
---
Yeah, I'm not sure why they are so different in speed.
---
Says its a chick booty, 10 bucks says its a weird Snapchat filtered pick of two bowling balls placed together.
---
Yeah itll clip like that however you get glorious double helicopter hair when casting so its #worth imo. You can always hide helm.
---
Yeah man I'm tailoring/enchanting and at level 32 I only have 6g.
---
Oh yeah, for sure.  Especially as a frost mage.
---
Happy cake day dude üëçüèº
---
Yesterday I was questing in STV as a healing priest, and I couldn't get a group for hours. Asking people if they wanted to team to share taps, buffing people and asking if they wanted to group.  
---
Couldn't take anything that was more than a single, so I was taking hours to do anything, and absolutely no one wanted to team up.
---
I think I am close to abandoning Classic because the community that was awesome under 30 is completely horrible over 35.
---
New Item: 
---
Luke Warm Milk: Restores 2% Mana Per Second for 20 seconds
---
"Just don't ask where it came from..."
---
Pretty much everything in Western and Eastern Plaguelands can drop them. Anyone level 50+ can farm them.
---
Buffing someone pvp flagged flags you as well
---
Greed lockboxes.
---
Rogues keep chests in dungeons.
---
Happy cake day üëçüèº
---
the alliance used to include lorderan
---
Yep, WC has 2.  There is one that everyone takes that you can literally walk off of and make it.  Then there is a second that you do have to jump that is within those winding paths that no one ever takes unless they choose that route.
---
I got a wave of anxiety just remembering my first couple gnomer runs. I‚Äôll probably do the first couple runs without a pet just to be safe.
---
Wait until they pull 2 mobs and then stun lock them or do a 2v1. That‚Äôs what you weirdos do to me all the time
---
which enchants? did you charge or just on tips?
---
Well I don't want to be excluded since I play lock, I'm just trying to understand if there's something I am missing.
---
Still no one is talking about trading gold from a Retail character to a Classic character. Obviously that isn‚Äôt possible, nor is it what OP is implying in his title.
---
You trade your Retail gold to a Retail player, who in turn pays you on a Classic Realm, there are going to be various conversion rates.
---
Wow seriously?
---
I got my 15 greys when I was in my 20s and was over the moon with them. Shortly after, I got green ones with stats from a quest üòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt get the point of this post, go play what you like lol but with a title like that you‚Äôre just begging for people to downvote the shit out of you
---
Title should be ‚ÄúI think they were right for me personally‚Äù
---
gonna need a top /r/classicwow post about this, please. thanks!
---
I've always seen classic as pure nostalgia, I don't think it has alot more to offer than that to me, personally.
---
Everything has been explored, played through, beaten.
---
Like where is the living world that we explore and defeat together, new challenges to overcome that no one has seen before.
---
Feels like beating a dead horse, it's Hella fun for a while but I do t think I'll stay around much longer than getting lvl60.
---
Then you let them die. What I hate is when I have food, so I life Tap to 0, but before I can start eating somebody heals me or the healer gets angry at me, because it can take like, 7 GCDs for me to tap all the way down.
---
 You can do multiple mobs, but why?   You don‚Äôt really ever do a shit ton of aoe damage.
---
exactly that
---
why do you feel the need to share this in the first place? what are you wanting to accomplish? you want someone to tell you to stick it out? classic isn't for everyone. you folks who are younger are especially not the target audience. you guys are used to games that steadily feed you rewards of some kind and that's not what classic does. 
---
you're used to a spoiled gaming experience but that just leads to games that don't have time to do much but give you more rewards. 
---
quality gaming is pretty niche, the shit making money is reskins of last year's games.
---
I've yet to see anyone create a thread about having more alliance on their server so probably
---
I'd smash.
---
Yep, I don't know how people miss it.  You can literally walk off the ledge and make it.
---
rep tabards did not exist, you simply gained reputation for the faction tied to the dungeon (CE for the coilfang reservoir, for example)
---
however this is completely irrelevant as i am only talking about one dungeon (magisters' terrace). dailys were not in the game until that patch.
---
Lmao you brought up ninjaing and changed the posts in the first place. Master looter i's an easy fix you brainlet
---
&gt; GRUG'ILLAYO GROM'ILLAY
---
My sides.
---
After around level 40 it's higher dps than wand and more efficient than spamming shadow bolt and drink between every pack
---
Ugh was running WC with a priest friend the other day and he kept throwing me heals at like 80% health and then would complain about mana. Like bro I‚Äôm gonna Lifetap like no other for the mana. I even told him to not worry about me if he‚Äôs concerned about mana and dude got like upset I was ‚Äútelling him how to play his class‚Äù
---
Skin everything basically. I've gotten a significant chunk of gold just from skinning everything and passively letting it sit in my bank. I haven't actively searched for skinning routes. I did a bunch of SFK which helped, I spent probably 12+ hours in auberdine while questing. 
---
I'm now in SS doing quests, skinning yetis, panthers, etc and passively growing my heavy leather stack.
---
Just dumped 300+ medium leather &amp; 150 heavy in AH last night that i collected from questing over the past 3-4 work days. ( I only play 3 hours/day but a lot of weekends.)
---
Same as Thunderfury
---
Grobbulus is majority Alliance but it is an RP-PVP server
---
Are you using Tukui ElvUI? I've never been a fan of it or really fully understood how to set it up. But I Love your setup with your action bars.
---
I tried installing it last night and it was a complete mess. To me, it was very difficult to set up and I eventually gave up because it had messed up so many settings I had.
---
Classic WoW is astronomically easier than Retail. It's just paced far slower, with much more necessity on travel times, a far slower gear-up process, and with far more variance in class viability. You can tank as a Shaman in Naxx, but you'll be hard pressed to find a group who'll want to take you over a Prot Warrior.. Nor is there any real benefit to it, other than finding groups slightly easier when levelling.
---
End-game dungeons are far harder and more mechanically intensive in retail than end-game dungeons in classic.. They're just shorter. Same with raids, especially when you get to doing mythics.
---
&gt;when WoW was actually hard.
---
Is such a croc of shit. Retail has its fair share of problems. But easy difficulty has 100% never been one.
---
idk? It's a very common trope.
---
I remember being part of not one but TWO military guilds on Alliance and One on Horde where everything orbited the GM and his RL officer buddies who were basically protagonists, everyone else had to be a faceless grunt and god help you if you tried anything heroic or individual. Only the officers and GM get medals. Only the officers and GM get to fight the bosses. Only the officers and GM get to have any influence on any story events. Etc.
---
It's soured me on military RP guilds altogether even though I know good ones do exist.
---
The only bagnon I could find was for 8.something. Is there a classic version I'm missing?
---
nice b8 m8
---
The feeling when you go AFK and a bunch of people spam campfires under your character.
---
it was sarcasm
---
I'm sorry you're not enjoying it as much as you thought you would. 
---
But Blizzard was wrong. They were wrong because they spoke on behalf of people who knew what they wanted, even if they were right about some people (you and others I'm sure). 
---
It's wrong to assume and speak for someone else when you're making such a bold statement. We wanted this. 
---
And if you ever decide you wanna give it another try, you certainly can!
---
&gt;Any major downsides apart from the soul shards?
---
One downside is that Warlocks need to keep DoT's up to maximize damage, there's a 16(?) debuff limit in vanilla and sometimes you can hit the debuff limit in raids which limits your damage.
---
Join the Forsaken, then we'll talk.
---
I think the worry is that if the warlock pulls aggro right away by chance then they could easily die.
---
Are you using a sharpening stone or something? Any kind of temporary weapon buff will block WF.
---
It's considered poor form to roll on gear that isn't your max type unless you OK it with folks in the group ahead of time.  Avoid strong opinion suprisr with a simple ask regarding the drop table and possibly find a different group if you can't agree. Best example where this happens and is OKed is after you get plate, caster chain alliance side is considered fair game for Pallies. Otherwise you should ask about those Devotion shoulders and clothie healing stuff/Agi gear.
---
Likewise, weapons: if you're DPSing and a healing weapon drops, do you compete because you CAN use it or are you going to defer to the primary spec person even if it weirdly has higher DPS?  Ask.
---
Can anyone recommend an off the shelf laptop that could run classic hopefully on decent settings? I don't know much about computer specs other than the fact that my desktop runs it just fine. I have no interest in other games at the time so if an expensive gaming laptop can be avoided (which I imagine it can be) that would be ideal. I'm mostly going to use it for Classic, browsing, and email. The backstory here is that I suddenly had to leave home unexpectedly (quite unforeseably) and I don't know how long I'll be gone for. 6 weeks? Six months? A year? There's a decent chance I'll be bedridden for awhile too, so any specific laptop recommendations would be really excellent. I'm looking for playability up front with cost being a distant second (I don't mind spending a bit more for a quality product) and availability. 
---
Thanks a ton for the help guys. Hope to see you back in Azeroth soon.
---
is there a good guide that tells you what you should use to raise engineering?
---
I was following one but it was very old and i have no clue if its efficient lol
---
Feral can be great dps, the biggest thing is how good the player is. The rotations for feral dps can get tricky and it's definitely not a class a person can just automatically perform well without some research or time invested. You could say this about any class, but I do think feral near the very top of the list of player skill impacting quite a bit of overall dps. Energy management is deceptively more difficult than it may appear.
---
I don't understand how levels make so much of a difference
---
Dont you only get 1 of each stat when you level up (plus a 25 increase to your weapon expertise cap)?
---
Isnt a piece of gear with +2 in your primary stat better than a level, or am I missing something?
---
All good, just means you‚Äôve changed since you last played classic. 
---
Weather or not for the better, that‚Äôs up to you.
---
I like WoW Classic. I don't even play Retail...but to count this as a strong point of vanilla is weird to me.. like . Cool 10 more defense skill! wow what a cool talent!
---
Posting this to remind myself to check this out tomorrow when I get home from work. Looks interesting.
---
I respect doing it without guides, but personally, I wouldn‚Äôt consider getting your mount to be guide-gated knowledge, nor purchasing all of your spells. Things are expensive and you can‚Äôt have everything. 
---
However, maybe my view is biased because I started in early BC and it was pretty common for people to be talking about saving every bit of gold once they hit 30 for their mount. Maybe you just weren‚Äôt fortunate enough to run into people talking about this during classic.
---
Well, it's all about getting into groups with like-minded people. You can't force them to go slow just like they can't force you to go fast. You just need to set expectations up front when looking for group members.
---
WoW is my favorite game, I don't have a job, I don't have money for WoW, I live in Brazil, I'm sad.
---
This was me last night,  I even missed that jump up from the stairs
---
You can also see the rose petals on the ground, and the blood smatter from the crown falling on the floor.
---
I didn't say anyone did or didn't. My point is that many helpful addons can take time to setup, and that 10 minutes really isn't that much given how much time is put into playing the game. 10 minutes for a quality of life addon isn't much time when you're putting countless days worth of time into a single character.
---
More fucking clickbait titles to get you to click on fucking twitch videos. STOPPP
---
This is the type of stuff I play for. So cool!
---
Your entire point is that all people buy are rehashed, recycled games that they probably played growing up that have consistently failed to innovate and push the boundaries. 
---
And you are making that point while suggesting that Classic WoW, a re-released, recycled game that literally made 0 changes or innovations from the original is somehow superior.
---
See how ignorant that is? Get your generation bullshit out of here boomer.
---
For now that's fine. 
---
At lvl 20+ you can spec Consecration Prot which is one of the better leveling specs. AOE pull 10 mobs with 1h+shield, ret aura, consecration, and watch em all die. Also good because you can both heal any dungeon up to 55+, and tank any dungeon up to 55+ with ease. (bonus advice is to keep a solid 2h wep handy in ur bags for whenever you are fighting just 1-2 mobs at a time out in the world).
---
I don't feel bad about drinking all the time cause the mages and warlocks drink every pull or 2 anyway ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The non i7 models have no fans so it's prob melting inside
---
I remember someone saying something in general in STV (HORDE SIDE) that they ambushed an alliance group. Same group probably. Really cool!
---
We got an antifa badass over here
---
I've heard of them. I've decided to stay clear of the whole PCU v Anti-PCU warzone. Problem is since BfA started and the entire narrative hit the shitter, most Horde players I know quit. So it's basically just the PCU on Horde now and uh... yeah I've not heard great things. 
---
I'd rather just stay out of it altogether. Though I have noticed the person you mention has his own army of fans who'll follow, like and back up anything he says on the forums. No matter what he posts he gets near 30 likes instantly, and anyone who says something he doesn't like gets ripped to pieces by about twenty people in the span of a few minutes... shit's weird. It's like a cult.
---
Doesn't the GM of Rotgarde "run" like five guilds or something? I seriously doubt any one person has the _time_ to give that many guilds quality time and attention. To me that's already a major red flag.
---
I recall they had ties with an Alliance guild at one point. Which allegedly disintegrated on the spot after one of the officers got caught doing ERP involving... a horse. Big oof if true.
---
Can't really use ENG bombs as a counterpoint since both have access to them, in reality it depends on the use per case basis. But the reality is once a warrior is in a hunters deadzone there is not much they can do.
---
lmao. As the tank, I made my group stand there while I skinned all the raptors in WC.
---
They masked the phasing pretty well in the DK starting zone because all the changes occurred when you were back in the Ebon Hold or wherever. If you didn't spend much time doing in Icecrown and Storm Peaks running dailies, you may not have had the opportunity to see that crap in Wrath.
---
Upgrade that thing. I have 16g ram and an ssd on my 2012 mbp and it plays brilliantly on classic setting. Fan almost never needs to kick on too.
---
They took on twice their number and it was a "fierce battle"
---
For the Horde!
---
Did you miss the blue post from about a week ago when they said every realm only had a single digit number of active layers, many of which were on the low end of single digit numbers?
---
I went from thermaplugg's arm to bone biter and it was absolutely fine. I honestly think the WW axe is not worth the effort.
---
Check wowpop.appspot.com
---
This will give you a better idea.
---
The key detail is after you start defending someone another guy shows up, then an ally, then an enemy, then all of a sudden it's a bloodbath and a guy 10 levels above you l comes in and murders everyone just when you thought your AV-sized team had the upper hand.
---
That's my STV experience anyways.
---
Who cares about doing the best possible dps you can unless you're raiding bosses you haven't downed yet though? You seem to be in the retail rush rush mindset. Most people are just playing this casually, combat looting, not drinking between pulls, etc etc. Warlocks using drain life might add a couple seconds to the dungeon run time. Who cares.
---
why would you want that shit?
---
NugRunning already does something similar. Is there something like this but as a fixed list instead of moving, overlapping nameplates.
---
My 10-year-old laptop can‚Äôt run retail for more than an hour without overheating to the point of spontaneous shutdown, even using my lap fan; I have to prop it up on a severe angle to improve the air flow. It‚Äôs a laggy, stuttery mess. Classic runs like magic, and my laptop barely gets warm after hours. No ridiculous, precarious laptop jenga. I‚Äôm head over heels for Classic. It‚Äôs awesome.
---
I didn't downvote anything dumbass, though since you brought it up sounds like a good idea. IDK why don't you go figure it out? Asshole.
---
I was able to sell them for about 4g each for about 2 days.
---
Then the second seller got the recipe, he undercut me to 3.5g. I contacted him and we both kept 4 Spurs @3.5g on AH. I was able to maintain this with the 3rd and 4th Crafters... Then we gave up once a lot more copies of the recipe came out. 
---
As of last night they are 2g value.
---
I did the same for other rare recipes when the server was younger, e.g. silvered bronze shoulders and green iron shoulders.
---
I like to think of it as a trade union, squeezing out those extra few days with no undercuts got us all some good extra gold.
---
Isn't retail primarily written in C++?
---
Yes. The blood is the best detail
---
Fishing in game
---
Just one or the other. They're built so that they can understand one another, so your TRP addon can read profiles built in MRP and vice versa. And yeah! The normal retail versions work with classic just fine
---
then you fucking use fade, a priest at level 25 is walking around with 1k health and 25-27% armor, you can take a few hits. in THIS PATCH an spriest tanked onyxia in a 10 or 20m raid. priests aren't squishy as long as you keep inner fire up and with instant heals and instant shields, pushback is just not a factor in anything but pvp
---
so again, you're flat out wrong and that's why all the guides say you are. that's also why you started out this whole thing with a qualifier of "i'll probably get downvoted to oblivion blah blah cry" or whatever
---
don't give this noob bad advice because you wanna try to reinvent a 15 year old wheel. there are NO secrets and 100% of everything has been tested and figured out.
---
Had the exact experience when I first started back  in BC. Made it a point to get it done within the appropriate level range in Classic.
---
That's it, underwater breathing for the pet, best of luck hunter
---
i had just an amazing healer while doing RFK today and with me being a pretty good tank with relativly good gear we just blazed that shit two full clear runs in a little bit over an hour. with clearing our bags of junk.
---
the typical pacl was the healer would wand the entire time the pack dies he throw a single heal on me and we go on the next pack. if shit hit the fan he throw the small heal needed on the dps as i would have gotten everything back under controll by then and we just continue to just plow our way threw.
---
this made me realise that 90% of how pleasant your dungeon experiance is in the hands of the tank and healer. since in classic it is pretty hard to be a shit dps just like wait for the tank to pull and then do the 2-3 abilties you have and we are done here.
---
Meanwhile, I had [Robes of Insight](https://classicdb.ch/?item=940) drop during a Mara run....and a fucking Warlock won it. He said he would use it, but it's not even an upgrade for him. (he had [Robe of Power](https://classicdb.ch/?item=7054))

I‚Äôm doing it right now on a warrior-priest dual box. It‚Äôs pretty smooth. One of them was like: go to barrens. Find ‚Äònowhere‚Äô. Delete hearthstone. Magically sent to in Sentinel Hill. Turn in quests. Die by hogger. Rez in Goldshire. Etc. saved like 20 minutes of travel time and was fairly silver neutral without flights.
---
It says a lot about the industry.
---
Nothing has pulled me really since halo 2 and WoW. Now that one is back I can't wait to play forever.
---
Exquisite response
---
Nope nothing Outlaw Saber (No buffs) Main Hand Sword of Omen (No Buffs) Off-hand
---
May want to filter your account name.
---
Hmm. Kind of frustrating but alt, shift and ctrl modifiers would be doable in a pinch...
---
As much as I love warcraft, I can't recommend the lore. It's extremely binary with lackluster character development in my opinion.
---
Don't get me wrong, I really love the lore in a campy, nostalgic way but I'm biased because it's been apart of my life for decades. As I've grown over the years and branched out, I realize now how shallow the lore is. 
---
All I'm trying to say is tread lightly. Avid fantasy readers might be disappointed, but newcomers could definitely get hooked.
---
Problem is that other classes can't wear as many armor types as you. You would have a big pool to choose from while other classes are limited to one armor class or maybe two. Making it harder for them to get an upgrade. Therefore everyone should stick to their armor type to make it fair and even.
---
I have btw. never seen someone needing on an item outside of their armor type without asking if there is someone else who needs the item in question. That's obviously fine. Would someone in my group roll on an item that is not his armor type and it's needed by someone else that would be an immediate kick and ignore.
---
Almost certainly. Just download it and try it.
---
Leave it to a horde to not know how to read a post and properly understand what was asked
---
The Alliance really isn't sending their best, are they?
---
I feel like I must have. Especially having every class above level 80 but I powered thru Northrend for pretty much all of them. Trying to recall phasing in Wrath... didn't come close to the issues with phasing in cata, as you said
---
Hey there fellow Benedictite!
---
Pinkness, and among the lower tier pets they're among the better ones, they have average stats and can learn Dash. I really don't notice much of a difference vs something like a Wolf or Owl.
---
Classicdb is based off of private server databases. IE, it's not accurate to Classic.
---
Smiling me at like an idiot when he's dissing you makes you look dumb as hell, like your brain doesn't have the power to come up with a real reply
---
Oh yeah, I got it running on a 12 year old Toshiba.
---
I dunno. Delete WDB folder or something.
---
Druid mage is a beautiful combo, Druid can take care of healing and tanking and mage can blow shit up. Hunter comes prepackaged with a Druid (pet) the best hunter experience is solo because honestly there's so many bad hunters that pick up aggro with their pet on accident that nobody wants to party with them.
---
About half are non elite
---
Damn really, I thought a few people may be going it.
---
Only day 15?? Oh God, it feels like a month.
---
I just think I got a bad one is all. Nbd like I said in my other comment, I sent it in. So I'll get a new one I'm sure it'll work just fine!  It's a great mouse actually.
---
Are you on Herod?
---
I'll try that I haven't tried that yet.
---
Dismounts you and then has you use the skill. It is useful because if you try to use a skill on a mount it will tell you that you are on a mount and can't use it. Saves you a click, which can save you a lot of time or a life.
---
I'm playing a druid too and all I do is just save +intellect gear to put on during dungeons. It doesn't matter if its cloth or leather and spirit isnt that big a deal since I usually dont go oom and I cant just drink between big pulls. Intellect is the main thing to look for as it raises your mana cap and adds spell crit chance. Plus healing would help too it's just a little more difficult to come by. But definately stay feral for leveling as that's the best build for solo play and the 30% speed increase is really nice to have.
---
Ah yes, more dip shittery from you.  Typical.
---
I appreciate you taking the time out to give me that advice man and I will consider it moving forward
---
How could you? There is way too much to do. And no is the rush to 60 more than anything.
---
Sure the die hards with more time than me get there, but my group of friends at the same point in our lives now are around the same level and can play together like never before. No more just max level, we are LIVING in the mid game.
---
Yes and in order to actually share the video, you must get a second phone to record the video playing on the original phone. That way you don't lose your original video when you upload it. You only lose your recording of the video itself. Roll safe, fam.
---
I was healing WC on my Shammy the other day and the warlock said he would drink instead of tapping. Told him I don't mind healing him just not when I'm low on Mana. It worked out well, if was full of Mana I would get him to tap all the way down and if we had a crazy pool he would eat and drink next to me. Nice lock.
---
Quiet as the grave.
---
You get the quest for the whirlwind axe at 30, but you won't be able to get it then without tremendous help.
---
I guess the way it's communicated likely makes the difference. If you word your broadcast succinctly yet diplomatically(somehow) then surely there'll be fewer salty messages coming in.
---
That said, I definitely have seen a "LFM, X weapon reserved" and the very next message there in chat "rofl weapon reserved? NO".
---
Can't help but wonder what the cross over in terms of players is in both games.
---
The game is from 2004 shit emachines were running it back then youll be okay
---
On the toolbar at the bottom of the screen there‚Äôs a vertical bar right of center that is green, yellow, or red.  When you hover over it a pop up will tell you the ping.
---
i personally love to do the drink pull you at 5% i am not going to pull you at 50-60% and drink yeah i am pulling a normal sized pack (not the 7-8 mega end dungeon pack blizzard loved to do in vanilla - WotLK) and by the time you or the DPS is full mana you can join in on the fun no need to stop 4 people from doing there job when you are not needed to your job for an other 15 seounds.
---
MISS YOU IN THE SAAAAAAAADDEST FASHION!
---
1. Yes there will be pvp, not just open world but battlegrounds. There just not open yet, gonna be just alittle while longer.
---
2. Super duper non-intensive.
---
3. Monthly subscription needed, think it's like 11$ a month. No startup cost, no xpacs to buy
---
You guys do have phones though?
---
Am I the only one who never had issues with pet food on any of my Hunters? By the time your pet reaches max loyalty, you only need to feed it like, every 2 hours. A single stack of food was often plenty.
---
Where did you get these and are they still available?
---
Has it been reported as a bug?
---
carebear
---
Didn't think of that, you're right.
---
However, I don't think we're going to be seeing that happen in widespread numbers anytime soon.
---
People are barely establishing their mains and the alts that share a faction with that main, it will be a considerable amount of time before people start thinking about making enemy faction alts.
---
I was gonna make some videos but I broke my pc and no longer have the best gpu so I don't have shadow play to record. Not looked into Radeon recording stuff yet. I already have a channel where I upload stuff however only have 1 wow vid so far.
---
When I am fully spect healer at 60 this will change
---
But have you maxed out all weapon skills?
---
I think we healers understand that no problem, the push/pull warlock dynamic where health is a resource.
---
It seems to generate more of a stink when the healer and casters are all sitting and drinking, and the warlock's just standing there. Then everyone's at full mana, healer throws warlock some heals, and then he promptly taps himself all way back down to zero again.
---
The attitude seems to be "warlock don't drink, they tap and bandage" or something. But sometimes you get the ones who won't bandage because well, are *you* supposed to keep them topped off, ol' healer buddy?
---
I want to know about this as well!
---
I guarantee you if he is Dwarf you will lose. Stoneform your blind and you are dead. I never lost to rogues on private servers as a dwarf reck paladin. The best rogues on the server refused to duel me after a while.
---
You make most of your gold on the tail end of your 30s imo.  You‚Äôll be fine
---
I wonder if this spilled over from hillsbrad. I was up there around 7-8pm and there was just groups going at it over and over. Best part was I was busy and they just let me keep killing bears and lions. It was like unless you started in, they respected the hustle.
---
hold onto it! super worth it, you will keep it for a realy long time in dungeon situations
---
As someone who Mained a healer for a long time. 
---
This toes a fine line. Some healers look at this mindset and think to themselves, ‚ÄúYeah, DPS shouldn‚Äôt be taking any damage. If they die, it‚Äôs their fault.‚Äù And then they just let them die on purpose, while they sit on a healthy mana bar. Any healer that does this sucks. 
---
Everyone takes damage. There are some petty PoS healers that think they‚Äôre above everyone else, and their only role is to keep the tank topped off. It‚Äôs not true, and a good healer can carry bad players as they‚Äôre learning.
---
i remember in TBC i was over at a friends place he needed to do a quick gruul's lair and at gruul it was expect of the dps to bandage and pot themselfs inorder to survive. that is just how the game was played back then.
---
Nice what server is this?
---
Little harder now though, a lot of keyboards don't map to F-keys by default anymore
---
I would check this first. 
---
I have exact same setup as OP (minus older CPU) and I get 144 fps when game is focused and 30 fps when not.
---
Cool. Looks like my Kromcrush is pretty even, and few people have passed 25. Druid is *not* popular.
---
Healers won‚Äôt be drinking within each pull, but you will be if you shadowbolt on each trash pack. Shadow bolting will also run you OPM before larger trash pulls are even done, and the efficiency of drain life will overcome the marginal damage difference.
---
But at what cost?!
---
Level 54 here. Cant relate
---
Weren't dwarves and gnomes created by the titans? I.e. completely separate genomes to trolls?
---
Because I‚Äôm still not convinced. I‚Äôve not seen any evidence that it‚Äôs not a bug. I don‚Äôt see how it could not be a bug. I‚Äôm fishing in some fish school/floating wreckage, bobber goes down, I right click bobber, window opens with a fish/chest in it for a split second then the window closes and I have nothing in my inventory.
---
The majority of my server hasn‚Äôt even hit 20 yet.
---
If you haven't cleaned out the dust buildup inside in the last 6 years, this might be the time. Guaranteed to run much cooler and quieter.
---
For extra bonus cooling, it's probably about the time that it would benefit from replacing the thermal paste on the cpu.
---
We should be able to skin all but Forsaken and Murlocs.
---
Go take a nap. But don't forget to get 300 Unarmed and every wep skill once u wake.
---
As attractive as power infusion is it's not great for solo content. It's really a PvP talent or an end game raiding talent. If you insist on using it, at least duo with a mage or warlock
---
Trying to level in hillsbrad is the scariest thing so far.
---
Yes, yes you are. They are high in the sky and you are not.
---
Stormwind sucks way more than UC
---
Did you try turning it off, and then on again? (Sorry, I'm an IT admin)
---
Jesus, Blizzard really does hate fun. Even abused it's one of the most harmlessly fun things you could do.
---
It is the best pve dps if the tank/raid is using gift of arthas.
---
Yeah i guess! It‚Äôs just the fear of missing out on a game that meant so much to me when i was younger! Thanks man!
---
this may take precedence over unequipping all your gear
---
We can tame bugs?
---
Northeasterner here oh yeah this is me
---
I mentioned I got a grey leather drop on my warrior and then I pleasantly surprised when a guilty sent me some blue mail shoulders in the mail!
---
You know the thing that always gets me as a personal touch is every time you loot a letter, book, or are otherwise given an item with implied writing on it, you can read it!
---
Jesus when Blizzard went and got rid of that, having a bunch of white quest items with the flavor text along the lines of "Juicy details within" I wanted to slap someone. Did everyone read them? Nope. But neither does everyone read every book in Skyrim. World building is important! Blizzard can make a zone look marvelous these days, but they forgot that little touch.
---
&gt;Being able to shout between packs, getting rend / Thunderclap / demoralizing shout off asap.
---
LOL. We're talking about efficient rage usage and you're wanting to TC and demo shout mobs. Hilarious.
---
That's the funny thing. In a previous WoW life I was once a warlock. When the mage and priest were sitting and drinking, so did I.
---
The hunter proceeded to give me crap for it "warlocks don't drink, you tap and bandage". I replied, well if the other casters are sitting and drinking *anyways*, shouldn't I do likewise? And he wouldn't have it.
---
playing priest
---
THATS YOUR PROBLEM.
---
Priest is nothing but bubble and auto wand. Terrible slow class that isnt fun in pvp. 
---
Reroll a hunter or a shaman, aspect of the cheetah and ghost wolf make up for not having a mount. You just completely delete people in pvp. Even a druid would be better in your case.
---

---
You're not even behind, there are content phases for this reason.  People who are ahead are going to have nothing left to do but farm gold here shortly.
---
I'm not even a warlock and I can see this is care bear nonsense. #nochanges As a horde player I am happy to defend the honor of the horde and beat off demon incursions in the cross roads. Villains are part of what make the game fun. Don't be that guy. Don't be the wet blanket always complaining when shit isn't fair. The lack of fairness is what makes it fun.
---
80 gold in 8 levels, sounds a little far fetched but sure
---
Thanks mate! I find it somewhat reassuring that people have been playing it on private servers for so long! Cheers!
---
LOL, he's finally worth something!!! HAHAHA
---
Yeah, but I'm only using it to move tooltips right now. I don't know if it would throw errors on other UI elements.
---
Unless you're grinding on things you shouldn't be, it objectively isn't.   
---
&gt; HS is a massive waste of rage. 
---
If it turns your rage into damage and it's literally the only thing you have that does that, it's not a waste.
---
Don't u mean Bestial Swiftness?
---
I haven't ever heard of anyone getting banned for it. I personally have been using it for almost 2 years now.
---
To be fair 99 times out of 100 that poly isn't with good intentions, also some mages will spam it just to mess with people and if they are a warrior alone a mage can literally just perma cc them.
---
Because this is a team game and there is a good chance the people you meet today might show back up in the future. Being respectful gets you invited back. The ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in this for myself, it‚Äôs all about me‚Äù attitude gets you kicked to the curb.
---
Your time matters. My time matters. The PuG picked up to fill a slot matters. If *we* fought to get to that chest, if we helped deal with the mobs to allow it to be opened, it‚Äôs *our* chest, not *your* chest. If the chest wasn‚Äôt cleared it would be no one‚Äôs chest. If the chest wasn‚Äôt unlocked, it would be no one‚Äôs chest. 
---
You roll on the chest and/or it‚Äôs contents should a specific item drops because everyone involved getting the chest out in time and effort getting it.
---
One-handed Swords, Axe, Two-handed Axe and Defense
---
I think I know the mage that killed and spit on you lol!
---
Been starting to do that, slowly learning. Was used to pulling a two comfortably as a shaman
---
I feel like I'm constantly zooming in and out in MMOs, how do you guys get used to using scroll for abilities?  And how do you change your camera distance?
---
(I've also got a finicky scroll wheel that likes to click back the opposite way after a scroll sometimes so that could be part of why I can't imagine doing it well)
---
Its also one of the few times in the entire game where its needed as well, you don't even need to jump in BFD technically, you can go around.
---
It is going to take a lot of people a month+ to get to 60, a good portion of the players have lives outside of wow and cant play everyday or for hours at a time so you're really in the same boat as the majority of the community. Stick with it and take the game at your own pace, there will still be a lot of people raiding for awhile and a lot of veterans will probably stick around to help out the people that never experienced vanilla.
---
As a hunter, here pet target every mob in front of me, youre doing a great job! Ight ima head out, you ok pet?
---
&gt;How are you not getting that this is relevant to the discussion?
---
Because it's not. You're making me wonder if you've even leveled warriors. You aren't generating 30 rate in 6 seconds? You're making shit up or you're terrible. I'll let you pick which.
---
39, make him a twink too for double value on that grind
---
The problem of undead rogue is everyone is an undead rogue.
---
I also have strafe on Q and E. I feel between all the Number keys, Function keys, and Shift + Number keys I generally don't need any more key binds.
---
Probably a zep you can't see because of settings/ lagg ECT..
---
Nice!
---
It's so easy to make though...
---
Calling demoralizing roar/shout "ridiculously good aoe threat" is kinda crazy imo. A rank 3 demo shout (lv 34 war, picked a decent middling level) does 21 threat to each mob. In def stance, thats 27 threat per cast. If any ranged class hits the mob for 34 damage or more, they will pull that mob off you. That is like an auto attack at any level. A non rogue melee class needs to hit for even less to pull it off you. Similarly, a battle shout that hits 5 party members for a lv 32 war will do 130 threat spread across all mobs. So for a 4 pull, that is 42 threat per mob in def stance. Ranged need only hit for 55 or more damage to pull it.
---
Now, your advice isn't wrong, but the key is that you CAN'T hold aggro in AoE pulls as a war if everyone attacks what they want. What you CAN do is use this threat to outpace healer threat, while marking a kill target and having people focus it down. Having a properly marked main target that everyone is killing is the most important aspect of tanking in classic.
---
Enjoy your victory, warriors have it tougher
---
Yeah, i gues i‚Äôll try to not ruin it by letting the stress of getting to max lvl overshadow my love for the whole experience of lvling up!
---
That's what I'm trying to convince people of! You're a smart one.
---
Undead rogues can eat the corpses of enemy players. 
---
Need I say more?
---
Yea this makes me very worried. I wanted to gather as many Warlocks who could summon Doom guards as possible. Then raid IF and open up a straight up portal to hell. Could you imagine like 40+ doomies stomping around IF? Would be amazing.
---
Anyone have the weird error where after you do the quest, you don't see the NPC or table outside of Org to turn into?
---
Can‚Äôt you with bartender/dominoes?
---
A lot of people are taking it nice and slow. The people who played back in the day are adults with full-time jobs now.
---
I had that feeling last night until the 2h warrior tank that couldn't even be bothered throwing out a sunder armour blamed me when he pulled and died while I was drinking at 13% mana. 
---
At the end of the day you are going to take some blame, but don't let people walk all over you when they don't even want to learn the basics of their role.
---
Hahahahahaha I can‚Äôt unsee it!!
---
Your first mistake was trusting any gnome ever
---
They are also among the best tank slayers with their bleeds, which ignore armor.
---
It was never a thing, or at least not in Vanilla. Everyone assumes that's the command, but it's never worked, it's always been gremove
---
Ok, do it, then come back and tell me I'm right.   
---
I like how you logiced your own post into being terrible.
---
Yes, there was. There are consequences for being a shithead.
---
Why cant they just attack you?
---
Keyboard turning. Keep it Classic.
---
Came here as a druid to say this. I have 3 to 5 different ranks of spells on my bars.
---
You might as well uninstall. You're fucked. lvl 15? After a whopping 2 weeks after release? Yeah, you're screwed. Now you'll never get a chance to raid, by the time your 60 every guild will be full and no1 will be recruiting for MC, every1 will have full T1, there's literally no point in you playing now. You're WAY too far behind to ever catch up. Uninstall and /wrists. Fucking casual.
---
These are only pvp servers. I should have did that in the title
---
Repost
---
Hehe thanks for the reply! I‚Äôm glad to hear i‚Äôm not alone! 
---
Good luck on your mount though!
---
There's nothing that you have to do every day that you miss. 
---
We're still in phase 1 of 6. There's still a lot of game to go.
---
There‚Äôs a way through the mountains, near the fp landmark that got revamped in cata, on top of one of the towers that sticks out of the mountain, a mage can blink through and slow fall into old IF
---
Loving all the 4minutes playtime huh? :-)
---
That's because it's just objectively the best choice.
---
It's probably going to take at least a year, if not more, to run through all the planned phases of Classic. You've got plenty of time.
---
Oh i like the font, name pls:)
---
Yes, there's also macros to equip from Actionbar (so you put the weapon/shield to action bar first). However, I don't know which macro snippets work for classic.
---
I was 3-6 levels below most mobs and had rank 2 instead of rank 3 on CoA
---
My thoughts as well. 
---
Early UD and scenery points to tirisfal. Tight grouping of folks points to vehicle.
---
I mean do what you wish. As a member of the horde myself I mean I say yes go undead.
---
AFAIK, all the streamers are on Faerlina.
---
Shift t
---
Just like everything in wow and this world, only gonna sell for what someone wants to buy it for.
---
Going into melee after ranges makes me swing my quiver instead of my axe.
---
This makes me want to kill myself
---
Azuresong Mageblade + Drakestone of shadow wrath is better.
---
Go for it.
---
Oh my God the arena mapping is genius
---
I have trouble using a few of the buttons, but I have utility stuff on my naga like hearth, mount, autorun, whistle, etc
---
Barely! I had missed to update Coa!
---
Unless there is a war going on, this is similar to what I do on mage just poly random ally and run
---
I've been camping Takk for literally 5hrs and have not seen him, all the info on his location is old and I hope I'm not in the wrong spot lol. If his speed is unchanged I will happily wait another 2 days. Are there any addons that might help with this stakeout?
---
The female undead animations are the best, main reason I rolled one. The flip when you do eviscerate is the best.
---
College advisor here: You can be a good student and play lots of WoW! But don't make any sacrifices to your life to play WoW. Trust me when I say this - this is a lonnnnnng haul. We have no idea when Phase 2 will even HAPPEN, let alone be announced. It could be 2 or more months before we even get a timeline for Phase 2 content. Unlike retail WoW, the phases are truly progressive, but don't "erase" old content. So if you have friends who are doing MC soon, don't worry - they're still going to be doing MC when you eventually hit 60. They'll have more stuff to do, but it's not like they're going to be dropping everything and you'll miss out on doing cool 60 things. 
---
Classic content is slow. Both naturally and intentionally. Questing is meant to take some time, not just be a hub where you talk to people and they give you things. Dungeons are meant to be run multiple times, yes, but part of classic is striking it rich with a good group that communicates and gets 5 good clears in a night rather than silently doing the same anonymous dungeon grind for 15 times. 
---
Like others have said, the content is not going anywhere. Take your time. I work 40 hours a week and am level 29. I'm excited that I'm going to maybe hit 30 tonight. I have friends who took time off from work and ground it out to 50-60 by now. Trust me, they also know that the content isn't going anywhere. Many of them are starting alts, working on professions, and just gathering materials to sell. 
---
WoW shouldn't feel like a job. You already have an important one: learning. So make sure you're doing lots of that.
---
imo it‚Äôs more fun on a pvp server, adds completely new aspect to the game but choosing alliance might make you flat out hate the game
---
I would check this video out. Very helpful for me when I was making my macros.
---

Life tap that
---
Thank you :)
---
pwnt
---
I‚Äôve done that now and have a macro set up but ok I wasn‚Äôt aware it was actually like that, thanks for your help!
---
Just quest to 41-42 and you‚Äôll have the gold required. Farming for gold won‚Äôt actually save you any time.
---
It's just called spying I am doing it for the Horde! Don't blow up my cover!
---
I know right? I didn‚Äôt get my shoulders till 19-20 lol
---
Classic is the first time playing WoW for me and the community is just so awesome. I  love the constant shit talk in the Barrens chat, everybody is willing to help out on quests. Can‚Äòt wait till work is over tomorrow to get back grinding.
---
You should know that some flight paths are unavailable depending on your start location. For instance, on horde side trying to get from Freewind Post, Thousand Needles to Shadowprey Village, Desolace, I have to go FWP - XR  - Stonetalon - Desolace. However, if I fly to Thunder Bluff from FWP, I can then talk to the flight master and hop on another bird, and go direct from Thunder Bluff to Desolace
---
Pretty sure you fall off if you just walk. They changed it in Retail at some point to be walkable.
---
So, this kinda makes sense from my perspective. Making water when we just learned a new rank is a drag. You make 2 at a time, then 4 the next level, and so on - but it costs the same amount of mana to make just 4 waters.
---
Sometimes I don't want to spend my entire night making water to give people a full stack because the process ends up going make 2 water, drink 1, make 2 more, drink 1, so on. I've actually done just this before in a dungeon in BC where I just sat at the entrance making water the entire time and the rest of the group finished the run, took their water, and we said our goodbyes.
---
Or you make 20 of the lower rank and it's not enough to even fill half your mana bar in a full 30 second drink. Just a bad situation when the mage is level x0 or x1, so I totally get making one water and just handing it over begrudgingly (and then having no water for yourself).
---
Is soloing deadmines a waste of time to make gold?
---
Cool. Now say goodbye to your life.
---
Aim for the bushes
---
Man, just looking for some reassurance from someone with a bit more knowledge than myself regarding this!
---
your point has merit if warlocks only level via dungeon grind. however, 99% of locks are leveling aff spec, many of us level drain tank spec. in that case dots + drain life is sustainable dps and god tier solo leveling spec.
---
shadowburn is really out of the way for leveling specs until late game, and it's not feasible to only level via dungeons as a lock.
---
Maybe try to back date the GP driver to the previous version?
---
GIVE MY VW FORTITUDE! I'll pay you in waterbreathing/detect invis lmao
---
None
---
I want REAL gamer bathwater
---
I get BSOD when I have a monitor attached to my laptop, have to launch without monitor then plug in again
---
Basically a popular name like the stupid PvP comp names. Like "beast cleave" or "dot cleave".
---
I'm currently 56 on my Mage and haven't logged in for 2 days. The grind gets a lot worse before it gets better, I'm afraid.

I still think my experience with Classic has been great overall, but the 40-60 grind is very, very real. It feels like quite the slog.

DDO was like my ideal game. The dungeon felt like real adventures. Every class felt like a D&amp;D class, and they all felt useful as you explored.
---
You are absolutely right. 8 extra points into affliction and 2 relocated to Improved Life Tap and I'm melting through everything. Even killed a level 38 guy for a quest solo!
---
maybe i am just so hardwired from having played so much tanking warrior in vanilla - WotLK but i am just super used to tab targeting heroic strikes or sunder armors for maximum threat i normally have my taunt off CD if the DPS gets some insane crits.
---
Where at? Rough coords?
---
To be honest I never got the whole "I refuse to pay to play a game thing" when most people would spend 15 bucks easily on junk food, smokes, booze, movie tickets, or $40-60 bucks on new game every month.
---
I gotta disagree there, UC is this cluttered mess of three levels where nothing is where it should be. Stormwind has an order to it and you can easily find what you need to by just looking at the map.

Majority of people are grinding away prolly lvl 20-45ish. I mean i‚Äôve played all weekend both weekends, my main is now a lvl 21 hunter. I‚Äôm getting nowhere fast. I‚Äôll be 60 in like 2 -3 months at this rate. Then I get to raid and do that stuff. So yea i‚Äôll be here a while.
---
So yea in a few months the pop may die down some but then we get server merges. I highly doubt it will go down enough in even a year to worry about it tho imo. I think it will last a while.
---
And if you go to retail no one talks at all. Maybe inside guild but that‚Äôs it. Looking for raid/dungeon killed all social aspects. Just sit in town and search for group is all you do 95% of the time
---
I can confirm, let a horde of murlocs swarm me so I could get all the way back across the map to turn in a quest then fly to the next zone, took nearly 10 minutes so by the time I was there my rez sickness was gone. Too easy.

but where is the outrage in that ?
---
Yeah I've been saying this for a week. All my settings are maxed naturally but I have to zoom in my mini map in fully sometimes and literally scan my mouse around to find it. 
---
I'll have to look into this macro or reduce ground clutter
---
Threat values for classic have been tested and are known, so it is possible to do math to determine the best option. Take a level 34 druid (rank 3 swipe and rank 3 demo roar). Swipe does fixed damage and does not scale based on attack power, but does 175% threat plus 130% for bear form. So typical swipe would be 82 threat per mob hit (up to 3 mobs). Demo roar is 20 threat baseline, 130% for bear form, so 26 threat per mob. Demo costs half of swipe, so threat per rage for roar is 2.6 versus threat per rage of 4.1 for swipe.
---
So even ignoring the rage talent, swipe is better damage per rage than demo roar. The issue comes with timing, which is exactly why as you said demo roar is best for quick threat (with furor you always have 10 rage for a roar when swapping to form) then swipe is best as long as you won't lose the mobs before you get the 20 (15 with talents i think) rage for a swipe.
---
But swipe falls off quick with bigger pulls, since you generate no rage against things you aren't hitting, and you can hit a max of 3 mobs per pull.
---
Typically yes due to racial passives and such. But nothing is as bad as Illidan back in the day. At worst we have some servers that appear to have 60/40 splits, but that varies widely based on timezones and who's actually online. I don't think the split matters as much as you think it does.
---
Vanilla players....
---
It's usually 100, only 90 if you're honored
---
If it hasn't been mentioned, the add-on "let me cast" does this. I've been using it since I got my mount.
---
Youre both idiots.
---
I mean more so from friendlies, if I DOT my buddy while he‚Äôs MCd during a raid will he keep it even after the MC wears off?
---
I‚Äôm on mobile atm, but this feels like something you could accomplish with a macro. Anyone able to whip one up for OP?
---
Well you haven‚Äôt really experienced any classes yet. Those levels are far too low to get the true experience. With rogue for example, it‚Äôs not even fun until you can start pvping in the 20s.
---
I like to heal and planned on maining a priest as i did in vanilla. I also to have a decent dps class. I ended up choosing shaman as i can do both, I may level up my priest later but so far am enjoying shaman with my buddies warrior and solo as a hunter
---
Milking should require manw
---
I feel you. I‚Äôm on Old Blanchy too and even the lv 20+ non contested zones are pretty bad. Took me 2-3 days to finish a kill quest to kill 10 Brutes!

Unless you're specifically using the VW as an offtank, the imp or succubus is better. Too many wrath babies telling other people how to play their classes.

Just because a small group finishes all the raids doesn't mean the server will be done raiding.  This will be going on a long long time and most guilds won't have that kind of progression.
---
Tell me sensei
---
Literally the only reason to being tbc is for flying mounts. Your opinion in my opinion is completely retarded and I would never agree with.
---
It's funny seeing all these posts about healers not healing warlocks when they tap.
---
Your job is to heal the group. It's literally all you do. Make green numbers. It isn't the warlocks fault if you're bad at managing your mana, lmao.
---
Was waiting for someone to do this. I love you.

Thank you Mr. Baguette! Voulez-vous couchez avec moi? Omelette du fromage? Bon nuit!

Pardon my French that was all of it.

It's like max 2 minutes of terror that you can outrun and then has a 1hr cooldown with a material cost to use. 
---
I'm more concerned about the lack of attacking unless attacked, that's straight bullshit in pvp as enemies just wont attack it and watch it nicely despawn.
---
Based on what you said on the rotation, as in shadowbolt, would you say the late warlock gameplay is a bit dull? Or is it made up somewhere?
---
Is there something later on that allows me to drop threat?
---
Yeah, pretty sure that got killed in the alpha with all the trash talk... lol

The fastest way, you mean. Not easy at all for some classes.

That would be more than welcome from me for sure! Shorter BG queues for everyone is a blessing so I hope that's true.
---
Kromcrush checking in! Hail GIRTH!

So we're doing a priest vs warlock thing now eh?
---
&gt;Talents
---
The Blizzard slow talent is the best one for AoE farming, other than that, the freeze/resist talents are good. Pretty much anything that adds damage or slows the opponent down are good.
---
&gt;locations
---
Most of the 'good' locations will be full of players farming, but generally I find that any cave with mobs 1-2 levels below you is a good place to start. You can abuse LoS so casters arent an issue and the spawn is generally good.
---
&gt;skill use
---
Blizzard, Frost Nova, Cone of Cold and Arcane Explosion are your go to abilities.
---
One thing to note is that it may be hard to AoE farm early due to your limited mana/hp, your available attacks, your lack of talents and your lower damage, after you get a few levels you get more comfortable farming AoE.
---
If your SO doesn't play too, find a new SO. :P

---
This is my issue too, been getting worried last couple days if my performance has dropped since classic came out. Struggling with 5 hours sleep and trying to write up that report tends to make me stare into space and think about being home in bed :/
---
I added it up and (for a mage) it's a bit over 37G to get everything pre-40, and another 12G to get all the lv 40 skills. So in total that's almost half the total cost of riding. Obviously you can't/shouldn't avoid buying everything, but you should definitely be choosy, especially as you get to higher levels.
---
Pally buffs last 5 minutes, or 15 with greater. This would be ineffective.
---
I Love that people have been rediscovering these things! It's great we have a new "generation" in a roundabout way, finding things I did when I first played. I love it!
---
This is very true. Even as a Allie I hate the Gnome laugh.

Also an Execute R kind of guy.
---
No one is killing epics fast enough to need layering involved.  And even still I‚Äôm not sure if you read the chances of it dropping or not but this still wouldn‚Äôt be any less impressive
---
Mage : \*laughing in flamestrike, arcane explosion and blizzard at level 20\*
---
the real pro-gamer move is to know to let the tank die rather than the frost mage when you go oom since the mage can kite the mobs and kill them.
---
My mind is blown, I love the rp of this. So cool!
---
It's that retail mentality slipping in. "Gotta go fast, no need to be careful"
---
Picked up The Rake. Taming rares are a lot easier with the layering system.
---
Prepare to have my new Sulfuras in your face, you mean?
---
I for one would try to get into the ‚ÄúComplaining about complaining‚Äù meta before it comes circling right back. With the latest changes to layering, you are but a spicy meme away from raking in tons of fake internet points.
---
Youre missing the point entirely. It's not about the griefing which is what I said immediately in my post. It's about the RPG elements of the game being taken away for convenience. That's what happened with retail and while i'm not a fan of the infernal griefing the game cannot be taking the flavourful mechanics away.
---
This. Early threat is such a pain and if I have leftover rage from the last pack I'm not letting it go to waste unless the healer needs mana.
---
I'm actually super excited for it to not be 95+ with 80% humidity every day. Nothing like getting back from a ride or run and looking like you went swimming.
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think it's a thing in classic. I'm sure you can make a macro for when you click on something you auto dismount.
---
Ya no eta or I haven‚Äôt seen anything since the interview that was actually about 3-4 months ago not last year lol
---
Linux
---
Yes I know, its garbage quality. I was overly excited.
---
This really surprises me as 1.12.1 was the patch where they swapped mount and training costs to make the skill the cheaper part.
---
&gt;This change was implemented after the latest revision of the patch notes was made available for inclusion into the 1.12.1 patch binary. It will be documented in a future revision however.
---
&gt;There will be effectively two riding skill levels, Apprentice and Journeyman. The cost for the riding skill will be significantly higher than it previously was, however this is offset by a drastically lower cost for the actual mount.
---
&gt;For current players with mounts there will be a seamless transition to the new system. You will continue to have your mount; you will continue to be able to use it, etc. What this change does for players who don‚Äôt yet have a mount or an epic mount is take the emphasis off of the mount itself, and put it on the riding skill. This helps give players access to more variety without requiring a large monetary investment if they, for instance, just want to pick a different colored horse.
---
Not gonna lie I just dropped the quest right there and moved on to thousand needles.
---
So the thing about warlock leveling is that you don't necessarily have to take the "boring" route. Using a voidwalker as your personal tank can be super efficient, yes, but it can also get monotonous. Try drain tanking with a succubus. Try getting all the talents for your imp and just blow things up. Try going full Destruction and setting the world on fire.
---
Personally, I have a lot of fun with the imp option. It's sort of a clusterfuck of talents that no self-respecting person should ever use, and there's definitely more danger involved - but it's FUN!
---
Point is, every class has a "most efficient" way of leveling. But it doesn't mean you have to do it that way.
---
What‚Äôs even better is how much act hat there is right there. Haven‚Äôt seen that type of guild banter on any character in years
---
It would be epic to see a full undead raid and cannibalise an entire town
---
the /e channel worked on mc'ed enemies and would allow you to do one way communication.
---
Except they had changed this by 1.12. Or at least, I'm pretty sure they had. I remember leveling my warlock and thinking about doing this. And a friend warning me not to because it was considered punishable griefing. Then, instead of having to punish people, they implemented these changes.
---
Classic has brought back a lot of people who either haven't played wow in a very long time, or occasionally play private servers or whatever. 
---
The average skill level of people playing classic is a lot lower than it is on retail, and thats most of who is complaining about healing warlocks who life tap. Healers who can't manage their mana, or flat out refuse to heal warlocks because of the outdated 'i keep tank alive only' mentality. 
---
Good players won't complain about healing a warlock who lifetaps, because they know that warlock mana = dps = faster cleaner run.

Mortal Strike is 30 rage, they cost the same. 
---
MS is better with less gear, like while you‚Äôre leveling. BT is better with more AP/crit/hit (at higher levels). Think of the health return as mitigating a bit of damage. It‚Äôs not the best designed mechanic, but it works better while DW.
---
And the video is fucking dumb anyway. 
---
He‚Äôs being an asshole ganking an afk player. What happens? As soon as he gets back and starts to fight? Run awaaaaaayyyyy! Bye Ally scum
---
Downranked spells are less efficient without sufficient +damage gear that your are probably lacking while leveling, btw.
---
Yes, rogues cannot beat reckoning Paladins. Ret on the other hand is easy. 
---
But reckoning Paladins are rare because they are so gimmicky and basically only work vs rogues.
---
Unfair to assume mismanagement without having some actual insight into what drives their decision making. I would love it if they dropped everything and put resources into classic; it has single handedly reminded me of why I spend 15years playing MMO as a fucking lifestyle, but we haven't even gotten to the point where they can gauge a stable population. It is unrealistic to say it is mismanaged or to expect them to dump resources from the core product, that is retail.
---
As far as smaller companies being able to maintain "better" development, cycles/environments, what smaller mmo devs are you referring to? 
---
Most I see have pretty long content droughts, on par with WoW, it worse, and what they drop isn't that compelling.
---
FF14 and ESO are probably the most actively developed exceptions but Bethsoft and Squ-enix are of a similar scale to Blizzard, and I think they have more active players.
---
Blizzcon is coming, I'm sure we'll hear something.
---
Github to contribute?
---
Active subscription should give you classic and current expansion.
---
All of the rotations in vanilla were extremely simple. 
---
Frost mages spammed Frostbolt. 
---
Fire mages spammed Fireball unless you were the scorch bitch. 
---
Rogues spam sinister strike, keep up slice n dice and used excess combo points for eviscerate.
---
Warriors spam bloodthirst / whirlwind / heroic strike. 
---
Hunters probably have the most ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù rotation in classic, but anything compared now to retail or past expansions is very minimal.
---
Demo is really strong in classic as it generates more threat with each mib hit. Demo shout quite ineffective sub 3 mobs but if you're cleaving 5+ mobs then it's almost impossible to lose threat. 
---
Battle shout is already decent aoe threat as it adds threat to each mob based on how many friendly targets are buffed by your shout. 
---
I'd suggest googling something like "vanilla warrior threat by spell" or some variation and  be familiar with how much threat each ability ca  deal. I'm almost certain there are working threat meter addons that exist now so once you get in tune with how much threat abilities deal you can decide how to start certain encounters and prioritize certain abilities. Sunder is good early on but in a raid setting our tank never had time to waste a global CD pressing sunder. The furies would put up 1 sunder each. 
---
As you get more experienced you'll know your boundaries. Our leveling group my tank used a 2h weapon like 95% of the time. Bring able to charge in, sweeping strikes whirlwind is such a good way to keep mobs on you vs having stuff run around and the other dps taking damage.

What level is the food? My damn pet eats 1g44s per stack, god damn that has got to add up. Of course probably made it all back in armor efficiency and grinding time.
---
i was at badlands grinding elements from 39-40 and made enough for my mount
---
When was it patched out originally? Did it remain until TBC?
---
Because if they fixed it originally during any point if vanilla, they probably won't reverse this decision. Even though classic is 1.12, they most likely consider griefing tactics fixed at any point in vanilla as "authentic" to the classic experience.
---
It's worth reporting. I just wouldn't expect a reversal if the fix came in 1.x .

I'm not saying they don't *want* to PvP, it's that they don't want the fear of PvP *happening to them*. They'll only ever want to fight when it's convenient for them (they have an advantage), so when both factions feel like that you're just not going to get fights.

I think fall and winter are my favorite times to play wow. The cold gloomy weather is the perfect back drop for exploring deathknell and other locations. No better time to cozy up especially with Saturday morning coffee and a wow session.

I think this would be a great idea
---
You want advanced shit? Turn aspect of the Cheetah on fire an auto, run in and melee attack, go out in time for your next ranged auto to come off cooldown. Does about 20% more deeps, which is crazy fast for levelling if you get bored just autoing.
---
Requires weaps that are close to 3.0 speed though.
---
In the sense of the game... how are you supposed to read that?
---
our bodies are piling pretty high in Hillsbrad lately
---
Keep in mind shadowmeld doesn‚Äôt work in combat.
---
If you really have 251 tailoring which I doubt as you would need a ton of mage weave, something along the lines of 400 to be at 250, you could sell the +shadow damage boes from tailoring. They sell insanely high because they are BiS for spriest and warlock until the next +shadow dmg set in the high 50s.
---
I buy deviates on my war so I can have a fun animation
---
My rule of thumb as a priest? As soon as we‚Äôre out of combat, the warlock gets a renew. Then, I can forget about the warlock and focus on getting the rest of the party healed.
---
And remember to click on it _once_ and don't move until you stop the casting animation.

Alphabets certainly make it easier to read, but pattern recognition is always possible regardless of literacy. For example if there is a box of apples at the store and a sign in front of them I can be reasonably certain that what's on the sign says apple/s even if I can't read it. Then whenever I see that symbol or symbols in the future I can mentally read it as apples even if I don't know how to pronounce it in the other language.

More that I'm amused. 
---
You come in, basically scream "Here's my big dumb American opinion!" and are now upset that someone noticed you were American? Why?
---
I wish I knew this meme before rolling a gnome and maybe I would have gone human, lol.
---
Hehe. About 9-11 silver I recon.
---
I think either can look better depending on the setting, but personally I just love the ripple effects when moving or jumping through water. They look nice.
---
I've felt similarly disenchanted at points. Lowest for me what around level 38 in STV where it was just impossible to do anything thanks to overcrowding. Collecting 10 raptor feathers or whatever and just got hit with a feeling of how shitty it all was. 
---
But its gotten better. Obviously getting a mount feels really nice. Maybe you can borrow money from someone but at lvl 42, 40g shouldn't be too hard to get if you just stop spending money on other stuff. 
---
Also have to recognize burnout. Yeah crazy people are already 60 but honestly even being in the 40s right now represents a *lot* of time invested for a person leveling normally (ie no organized dungeon aoe grinding, no guides). Like hours a day since launch. And you have a 26 alt.
---
Reroll to the good faction
---
Renew may be inefficient but its delayed healing after a big bomb still lets you stay outside the 5SR for longer.
---
I'd say he sounds pretty realistic.  Even if it's ceramic, it looks like a plastic kid's toy.  Fake wood, bunch of fake nicks in a fake metal base.    It's pretty lame looking for $50.
---
The other steins they made looked way better than this.
---
Those people roll night elves
---
Nice, i will try that at 40 :)
---
Look you have no right to make fun of the special needs Ogres who make those signs for us
---
Sounds like you should play druid
---
the yeti cave was brutal
---
Huge burst dmg in pvp, short but 1000 suns type of flames. With offensive purges,healing, and kiting abilities they are a beast.  In pve they are shit because they have no mana replenishment. Once they oom, they are worthless as dps. 
---
Enh for roughly the same reasons, purge, self heal, and totems (tremor and grounding totem utility are insanely op in classic). Also want lucky wf procs, but it's very satisfying to purge an ice barrier and frost armor, then wf proc 100-0 in one go.
---
Winter time wow is the best
---
It'll die down eventually, just like any game.
---
I had no problem getting the quest on horde side. Iirc in thunder bluff the druid trainer asked me to gi to moinglade to continue the quest. Then off to get the fragments
---
Shut your mouth , us druids just be taken our time and enjoying nature
---
Honestly don't bother unless you're on a very very quiet server.
---
This made me legit laugh out loud. Nice.
---
I think explosives are for doors only. I could be wrong though.
---
Not going to lie I have a kill on site list for those that try to gank me. So far it's only other rogues and warlocks. There's about 6 so far and 1 was successful but he had 4 levels on me and teamed up with a rogue that had 4 levels on me. I think im nicer to horde because I'm really good at getting away when they hit me out of nowhere. Though.. I will have revenge on that warlock and rogue one day. I keep catching the warlock ganking but he always has too many horde backing him up for me to get that sweet revenge. Long story short.. I hope I can keep treating horde as innocent till proven guilty while I level my mage lol
---
Now that's a bummer
---
You have to speak to the druid trainer in Darnassus first. He will then tell you to speak to who your talking about. Annoying I know.
---
I thought that's how it always worked.
---
TIL I didn't understand how stats work, my bad. So we're "basically sure" of the numbers reported in that site.
---
Low drop rates with high competition aren't worth it. Low drop rates with no competition, all the greys, skins and any other nearby nodes of chests are absolutely worth doing.
---
Gotta be honest - it sounds a lot like Chris Metzen is just telling the classic community what they want to hear.
---
Just wait
---
I love that we have to actually travel now, the boats and Zeps are awesome.  That tension of running to make it on time is classic.
---
Yes it was around 600-800 mageweave especially when i made bags for most part as they are still luckily only 5-6 silver loss on each one + i bought all my mageweave for 4-5silver each waiting in AH everytime for more cheap ones to be posted but thanks for the tip with shadow dmg items
---
Nah the waterhead (stavistupid duh) still crumbles crayons into the mouth and even butt
---
you know your fighting with 2 12 year olds online and losing? how sad is that? getting owned by a child? you the big impressive adult is reduced to mongo words and emjois, because he's too angry to think straight since i called him a downie, you can tell how stavi's types different like hes enraged and wants to slam an answer to 'lol i win'
---
yeh kid that downie comment  got to you and we all know it, if it didn't then why did you start in 1 word replies and bitch smiles? instead of the hard man act?
---
This is why PvP servers are so much more worth it.
---
and none of this would have happened if this was a pve server. Great story man.. loved it
---
2015*
---
"Close" feels a lot less close when it's still 20 hours of grinding and questing... but yeah, home stretch.
---
They shouldn't be there till 1.12 naxx patch. Or which ever pahse they drop that in.
---
Yes please
---
That's what the tank wanted me to do too. He was probably yelled at for dotting everything and has been scarred ever since.
---
boo you're a jerk
---
wand spec healer here topping dps like a fucking BAWS
---
They did enslave the Orcs first.
---
Not really sure, in game tool-tip doesn't give a level and wowhead says 55.  My pet is 49 and it's working the same as other high level food.
---
Im on Blaumeux as well as Horde. I was in Ashenvale the other night looking for pages. I was killing mobs and leaving the Alliance alone. No sense in ganking. We have grinding to do. Then another undead mage about my level comes over and clears the area of alliance. He leaves and I dont assume anything of it. Im just chillin, after all. About 5 minutes later a group of 4 roll up and kill me. Now normally it is to be expected, considering there are plenty of people that roam around and kill the opposing faction, but this was different. They camped my body for 30 mins. They would have probably gone on for longer if I hadnt been able to sneak away. 
---
My theory is the allies that got killed said something like "undead mage at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is ganking us. help." and then a posse rolls up and makes sure i rue the day I picked on the alliance, when i didnt do shit. 
---
TL:DR: I was framed.
---
That's why I love level 40.  Dark pact I just steal the 1100 mana from my succubus and dont lose any health.
---
Also... Heal in bursts! Your spirit regen is null for five seconds after casting. So you want to heal in bursts to capitalize on spirit mana regen. Most the time you can ride out DPS having half health because they shouldn't be taking much damage, worst case priests use your bubble if they take another unexpected hit. Wait till your tank needs a heal then top of DPS. 
---
In my experience as a priest I'll wait till the tank is down 400-500 HP (amount my Heal spell can heal) then use Lesser Heal to top of DPS then depending on the incoming damage hit the tank with one more Heal or Lesser Heal. Then sit and wand while my mana regens.
---
Worth it.
---
LOL Afraid of getting ganked!
---
Too bad..great representation of the Herde!
---
One time I ganked a guy who had a fishing pole equipped. It was the only time I felt sick with myself after a gank.
---
More like Druid just taking it's time, not becoming a real class until BC.
---
And no hard feelings, my class of choice wasn't real until MoP!
---
According to a streamer it's 35g-40g an hour. He already has his epic mount.
---
spells also ignore armor
---
I‚Äôm also horde on Kromcrush. Wish there was like a community board for factions on each server or something
---
It's the mage equivalent of the elusive "Rouge"
---
how did you find this?
---
Thing you need to understand is the playerbase is bound to diminish. In a couple of weeks no one will be starting to play the game, so there will be only quitters. Granted the population is high to remove layers right now, but ppl arent taking blizzards new servers transfer to flatten the population
---
Need the Peggle add-on.
---
If  you think you can go around act like a moron, say completely idiotic  things, insult other people when they call you out on said things and then just "leave" the conversation after just repeating your  wrong nonsense one last time, yeah you need a wake-up call. There is  nothing more childish than going "I got the last word in I can't hear  you anymore lalalala".
---
Also I  wrote I would send this to you in a private message INSIDE the message.  Which of course, you didn't read, because you're an immature childish dumbass, and maybe somewhere deep down know you are just talking bullshit so you don't even want to look at the response.
---
So  in the future if you're going to start a completely idiotic argument  you know nothing about, and that is in reality probably just your shitty game preferences frantically trying to excuse things wrong with the game. Try  and at least your "brain" a TINY bit. Maybe you'll avoid future  embarrassment.
---
Am level 10, did nothin' in game last night but shootin' the shit in Mulgore general chat. Was wonderful. In Classic WoW, the journey IS the destination. Take your time, find a nice guild with a temperament similar to your own, make friends, run dungeons you don't even need with them, it'll be great, promise.

Ive seen herbs hidden:
---
- entirely inside large bushes
---
- blended into the color palettes of tree groves
---
- in a not obvious corner of a barn

They all take a second of head scratching and double checking. If you don't know which piece of foliage it is you'll be scanning with the mouse as highlighting it does nothing unless you already know where to put your cursor. Come off it dude you're being a douche for practically no reason.

[PvP + PvE] | English language
---
Our Philosophy:
---
While our leaders happen to be World of Warcraft veterans, we also have several new players and are happy to help guildmates regardless of skill or experience. Here in Blue Slide Park, all that matters is that you show up with the proper attitude / mindset.
---
Progression:
---
Many of our players will undoubtably rush end-game content, but we also hope to establish a community where players of all levels can easily find others for  dungeons, PvP, etc.
---
Who are we looking for:
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a chill atmosphere with friendly people. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything else is optional.

I have a question: Did the implementation of raising the level cap lead to the decreased appeal of retail?
---
And do you think they're going to increase the level cap for classic? And was the purpose of increasing it to try to get players to stay?
---
I'm not sure how post 60 gameplay works exactly but were they actually in dire need to raise the cap? Even though I've heard post 60 gameplay is actually fun though?
---
Same omg I needed that LOL
---
Sunder armor does turn rage into damage , at a better rate than HS, on most mobs, not just a small subset.
---
Why do you think sunder is only effective on "mobs you shouldnt be grinding"? Thats very untrue.
---
If you spec frost, mage also has ice block. Not quite the bubble, but can still bypass some mechanics in the same way.
---
I think your weapon is holding you back the most. I think I had replaced that by level 10. You're looking for a weapon that does more damage per swing specifically. You can probably find a better one from a weapon vendor in town.
---
My cousin has never even had a battlenet account before now. All he had to do was create account, subscribe, install.
---
Nice, so if you farm it for 2 hours a day that's only 12 days of grinding.
---
I'm being completely sarcastic by the way it's a waste of time
---
My older brother raised us using a as forward s for backward and ctrl and alt for left and right playing CS 1.6 it was such a wierd set up and now i can't play cs in any other way haha all other fps's I'm fine just not cs
---
Unless they're making a shaman or 2 tell em to go alliance with you. I wouldn't do that grind again and also not have any money or stuff. No if you're interested in trying another class, why not go for it. But I wouldn't get to the 40s on another rogue.
---
the instance portal is inside and seems functional, but I'm not level 50 so I can't enter

How much dps are you doing on the next pull after going out of mana?  You're the lock everyone's talking about who life taps to 0% and expects the healer to use all their time drinking for you.  
---
I'd rather do 100 dps and stay full resources and ready for the next pulls than 120dps and have to drink for 30s.
---
I like this guy's answer. I do remember a quest about them now that I think of it. I'm intrigued.
---
I don't know how I never considered that.
---
My main is only level 15, you've just convinced me to make a rogue alt after work.

Has this seriously never been confirmed? lmao.

220 engineering lvl 40 druid here. No mount either but am druid. Death ray scheduled by this weekend hopefully

More importantly, it allows you to initiate combat. People panic when you jump on them. I'm sure there are many PvP fights I would've lost without the initiative. As a Hunter, if they run, you've already killed them.

Cool

So again, how is a horde player able to read an alliance sign when the alliance use alphabeticized language signs vs the horde symbolized signs?
---
WTB detox
---
Yeah that's when it's super useful - dire situations. I just see a lot of people casting it on cooldown instead of heal
---
So, does happiness decay change with loyalty levels - that must be what you're insinuating here, right?
---
Always doing that, but its not that much what im getting out of these boxes. Maybe i pickpocketing the wrong ones ü§î

That was probably more of a BC thing, but hey if i can go for both sure.
---
Welp, looks like I'm re-rolling a dwarf pally on Kromcrush
---
Try a massage, it might help relieve some tension...
---
1k health and 25-25% armor is not really relevant to the discussion as health and armor do not mitigate pushback.
---
It's usefulness is situational, that's true, but it's convenient and ultimately, it's 2 talent points and not gamebreaking either way, especially while leveling.
---
hmmm... horde have no honor
---
Yea the first 2 or 3 times in there it was a maze, now I could go through it with my eyes closed... except maybe the apothecary area, that shit is ridiculous
---
I'm tailoring/ench 38 and have 42g. I did make a mini bank during the early days selling greater magic wands, but that market is pretty much dead now. I was also quick enough to make some bank on silk bags, but thats now also dead. TBH my primary source of income has been selling savory deviates to the alliance via Goblin AH.
---
Also once I outleveled certain enchanting matts, its pretty easy to sell to usable ones on AH for solid price. Even better considering there is no deposit on those. Greater Magic Essence etc. sell for way more than most green items will vendor for. Ironically its the shards which are worth literally nothing since no1 uses them to level skill and no1 is going to pay for lesser impact weapon enchant (lol).
---
I feel like I'm annoying my team because of the sound effect of dark pact spam but it beats using my own hp lol.

How is the material quality? Is this easily washable?
---
assuming it comes with it or do i got to goto website to dl the software? and I don't understand the shift+1 mouse button thing. Never used modifiers lol sorry
---
get big bags asap.. its a good investment.
---
loot everything, vendor most, ah select few things that are guaranteed sales at reason prices. 
---
take skinning.  skin everything. vendor everything. -&gt;15-20 gold by 40 (dont train past 225)
---
don‚Äôt train useless skills, no. imperative skills.  ie rogue gouge rank 1 only, kick rank 1 only etc.  
---
never buy gear.  quest rewards.
---
grind.  grind beasts w skinning.  grind whole levels.  grind until your bags are full.  sell everything and repeat.
---
seeing lots of people get mount at 40 nowadays!
---
Yeah, but your dagger skill sucks! /s 
---
Nice job man!
---
As a warlock I would like to know this as well. We need more clarity

this guy fucks

I really don't know

Not on Horde we don't.

Oh man, totally had this on my computer!

It probably was. Can‚Äôt remember what xpac.

I didnt level tailoring until I was at 60. At 60, I spent the gold I earned from selling leather to vendors to buy cloth. Cloth was even cheaper than it is now, and it isn't expensive now either.
---
One thing has been consistent since vanilla, and that's the fact Warriors will never wait for squishies to recover mana before engaging.
---
And also creating excess healing aggro for no good reason
---
I believe the meta is to go gnomish, get all the goodies and then drop engi and go goblin.
---
Great this has me worried that I won‚Äôt be able to kite Kazzak to SW when he gets released.
---
&gt;the most important battles are instanced to let you fight alone (or with some important NPCs) vs the BBEG.
---
Wait, really?
---
How does that work with raids?
---
On a single pack, sure shadow bolt wins.  Chain groups of 2-3 mobs without stopping, your group will progress faster with a lock draining life and maintaining 100% resources without making the healer drink all the time.
---
No you cant fucking read, you mongoloid. Maybe your superior Non-US EDUMACATION should teach you some reading comprehension.

&gt;then hover the mouse around beneath me till I get the gather icon.

---
How are you getting that at level 36?
---
I think anybody serious ‚Äúis to say Darkbob is not an RP name‚Äù. It‚Äôs not the presence of emoji‚Äôs which define wether a name is RP or not. An RP name simply means that the name fits in a Fantasy universum - that an actual Warcraft character could have been named that way or that you could have a character with such name in a fantasy novel.
---
like the place where grom hellscream killed mannoroth in ashenvale... chills man
---
Yes... no... 
---
A medium size server has more people playing in it then original vanilla servers. Do you enjoy queues?

I would aim for medium but that‚Äôs me.

I literally skinning everything i see xD Thanks man, i'll try that.

I picked Faerlina before I knew a bunch of streamers were playing on it. I've met nothing but cool people. Not really sure why someone went and made a whole ass website to avoid them.  I myself don't tend to watch other people play wow, but it is what it is.

I see. I use clap mostly for the reduced damage as the only time i tank is when im funnelled into it. I usually charge&gt;bloodrage&gt;clap&gt;def stance&gt;demo shout&gt;battle shout then start sundering everything. From memory im currently at 12/8 arms/fury with full points in tac mastery because of how often im asked to tank. In saying that im not a very confident tank and i personally dont think im a good tank so i dont like tanking.
---
But if clap is a wated rage spend then i will drop that and maybe just cleave instead
---
I think it really comes down to expectations. I‚Äôve logged on sporadically since the launch and between server queues and rerolling because my friends ditched the server I was on, so I‚Äôm almost level 15 on my undead warrior. I‚Äôm fishing, I‚Äôm cooking, I‚Äôm questing. Giving people food buffs for free just to hopefully make someone‚Äôs day a little brighter. I know I should be vendoring/auctioning the stuff I make so I can afford a mount at 40, but that‚Äôd ruin my experience. I‚Äôm having a blast!
---
Last night, I had a random quest to turn in to Brill and a rogue asked for help in one of the last quests you do in that zone. I ended up helping him because I remembered what a pain it was for me and a random mage to do at the time. He seemed genuinely grateful, and I logged off feeling pretty good.
---
My expectation is that I probably won‚Äôt hit 60 until after the New Year, and that‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm just doing whatever sounds fun to me. Even if undead is the weakest warrior horde race. Even if questing as Prot is slower than any other spec.
---
So just do what sounds fun to you. Go roll on an RP-PvP server and become a mad warlock bent on summoning a dread lord into Azeroth or something.
---
But If it‚Äôs not for you, then maybe it‚Äôs not for you.
---
Best of luck.

Don't forget to downrank when/where applicable.

But did you try
---
As a druid tank I havent had any issues, had one group that aoe'd every pull with imp blizz 1 second in. I just got what I could and then they were on their own. I dont usually sweat it, most classes can handle 1 trash mob as long as its not on your healer. I have never lost threat on a boss, just 3-4 mob pulls where threat is spread all over.

Right, my point was just that if that person is a big fantasy reader (tolkein, martin, pratchett, brooks, etc), warcraft lore might feel pretty watered down. But if they're new to the genre it's an excellent way to get your feet wet!
---
Do whatever you want, that's pretty much what I've been doing and I've been doing just fine
---
I'm so with you. I kind of regret not playing on an RP server just for the name policy. I played on one for most of retail. Granted I am full embracing the lack of RP names with my characters: Dune, Karana, Nagafen, Fippy, but I feel okay that they aren't strung together statements like Ieatsisters.

Probably should use an example that blizzard hasn't already said they're going to recreate.

It's garbage content too. We've been playing the game for over two weeks and you bother to post a phone cap of the INSTALL SCREEN? TWICE?
---
I did kind of the opposite, warrior is slower leveling so I took warrior to 43 and then started my mage.  Having the mage to 60 first is nice as far as being able to farm gold is concerned.  I wanted my warrior to a level that he could sit while I leveled the mage and the rested experience would be more substantial.  So now once a week I can go work off rested on the warrior making the leveling faster.  The mage doesn't need help leveling as it's not a pain like the warrior.  The mage will hit 60 and then hopefully I'll have the warrior closer at the same time.  That might not help with your predicament, I would probably just stick it out on the mage then work your warrior.
---
As far as synergizing professions, I would say engi is more important to the warrior rather than mage as the warrior doesn't have the aoe arsenal the mage has so those explosives help a lot especially if you plan on tanking so you can hold threat from those mages dropping aoe fast.  Really though, while leveling the professions don't need to be a priority.

Man i reeeeally wanted to enjoy my warlock. got him to 15 and just couldnt keep going. Wasnt having fun but i really wanted to play a caster this go round. Rerolled or hunter and im having so much fun again :)

I won‚Äôt hate that üòè happy cake day!!

Some people are rabid about how others use their keyboard and mouse. Making fun of clickers is the biggest one, but I have been made fun of for not explicitly binding strafe. I assumed your question had hostile intent.

I will name him LoseYourself

what do you mean

No doubt.  I know I vendored at least 6 of them

Real Mob Health and Threat Plates no Tidyplates, they just worked right out of the box of me.
---
Yeah but with a drop rate of 8%, you should have averaged one in 20 kills. Either your luck is the worst in the game or you were farming mobs, I averaged one per Deadmines run :(
---
I was running through Ashenvale on my way to Astranaar yesterday (level 31 human priest) when along the way I saw two level 15 night elves standing with a level 30 tauren shaman.  He killed one of them and the other started dancing with him.  I was confused about why they were even there so I stopped and looked at them and /say "What's going on here?".  As soon as I said it, the shaman attacked me.  He was successfully murdered and the remaining night elf said "That was my friend".  I said "Then why did he attack me?".  The response was "You looked at him wrong".  So I said "Well then he deserved to die" and went on my merry way.  Sometimes there is just no winning.
---
They should have released a single player game where you play Jaina or Thrall or something then....one of the actual heroes/leaders of Warcraft...
---
wow did not think of that, might get the trinket instead of the staff now lol
---
Basically, the statisticians are not surprised that someone wins two lottery jackpots. It'd be suspicious if no one ever did.
---
Really doubt it.
---
first of all, use Control+V in-game to show combat health bars, and use tab to cycle through enemies. What you‚Äôre asking for, there really isn‚Äôt an add on for it atm, but who knows what addon‚Äôs might show up in the future
---
Not at all. They are positioned differently. They have sheep effects, silence, and resist spells is a thing too. You're oversimplifying it to bolster your argument.
---
OH! I completely forgot (guess I;v never actually done it, lmao) of pressing tab to switch target. Thank you!
---
And VendorPrice
---
Haha gratz dude!  I remember doing an escort quest with you in 1k needles and you literally said you would only heal.
---
Dude use a quiver. Drastically count down in inventory manahement. Feeding a pet is temporary. At level 6 loyalty you'll feed it rarely, even on death. Its trivial. Dwarf and nelf are good, it's the rare circumstance that optimization isnt a factor.
---
Are there really no confirmation prompts for these guild commands?
---
Which was?
---
When I first started playing I legit got lost trying to get out. Forgot about the elevators. Not my proudest moment.

How do I use it?

They key to mana management is not spam casting heals. Ideally you want to Cast a heal wait for the first mana tick (5 second rule 5SR) then cast another heal. ALso if you want to use renew always use it immediately following a cast heal as it won't add to the 5SR. Keeping yourself in the 5 second rule with make you go oom very fast.
---

---
Fun Fact of the Day: Vampires don't have reflections in many portrails due to the fact that mirrors were mostly made from polished silver during the time of their creative conception.
---
Go back to retail.
---
Imagine being so elitist you call actual Classic for casuals when people say retail is for casuals, can you gatekeepers make up your mind?
---
Maybe on the tryhard servers. Pugs are still absolute trash on one of the late open reroll servers.
---
I say that as a trash pug, but I'm having fun. Dungeons are rarely a cakewalk, there's always a mage ice nova-ing in a trash pack and getting instantly popped.
---
Yep! With that large of a sample size, it's pretty damn difficult for it to be more than a couple percent off. Short of an impossibly low chance, the only way for those numbers to not be representative of the entire server would be if there was something wrong in the way they gather data. Which is certainly a possibility!

Campfires also don't damage friendly players. We used to use those to kill afk bank alts.

What happened to \#nochanges?

So you can shoot out without breaking your windows.
---
Some people claim they prefer, and to be fair there was a new item added in the current expansion that lets you shoot people off their mounts, it's pretty hilarious. But it doesn't really change the tactic, as people can outrun the dismount gun, fly \*really\* high, and otherwise hide until they feel they're ready to counter-attack. Yet if both raids are in the air, you basically start playing chicken to bait one side into landing first so you can get first strike. Otherwise we all decide it's not worth it and leave. I don't think it should be understated that, while WPvP didn't die with flying, it certainly was damaged by it. My best WPvP moments after flying were in zones with none. Quel Danas, Timeless Isle, and the old world zones pre-Cata.

I kinda wish trolls were less traditional
---
Being the oldest native race itd br cool and unconventional to have trolls be the technological powerhouses instead of the dwarves and gnomes
---
Dont get me wrong, I love dwarves and gnomes- they're my two favourite races, but them being the tech masters in every single fantasy setting gets a little stale (and I hate voodoo shit, so trolls dont really appeal to me)
---

---
It's because I think all of the gnomish items only need gnomish to make them then you only need appropriate engineering skill to use them once you've made them.  So you drop engi and then go goblin for all the boom stuff and you still get all the gnomish stuff you made already.
---
Thank you, I actually never knew of pressing tab to cycle through enemies. This should be the thing I just need. Thank you! :)

Turn off the in game max frame rate thing. That did it for me
---
What does that do
---
Damn. My server has been selling rough/coarse stone, etc. for usually over 50S a stack. Didn‚Äôt even bother trying to level my Engineering by making blasting powder.
---
Make a macro:
---
/tar name
---
I was told that I should wait until the 30s to pvp...
---
The beta only went up to level 40 and this guy is raging about a level 50 skill. Of course Blizz should fix this but at the moment we have no reason to assume it's not a bug.

---
I‚Äôm leveling the engineering on my mage strictly for pvp purposes. I do agree that engineering is very beneficial to the warrior as well. I‚Äôll probably end up dropping a gathering profession once I‚Äôm 60 on the warrior for engineering because I want to pvp with him as well.
---
Try turning off the max frame rate thing in options. Solved it for me
---
&gt; At level 6 loyalty you'll feed it rarely, even on death.
---
Incorrect.  Each stage of mood is 350 "points"; death wipes out 350 points and a full duration Feed Pet gives 350 points with appropriate level food.  You need to feed after they die or you miss out on 25% of their damage.
---
@OP, just keep a stack of whatever your pet likes.  It's not hard, just feed it when it becomes Content (yellow face).
---
You can definitely solo a lot of stuff, I used to farm the elite doomguards. In tainted scar where you eventually get your doomguard summon spell from, they hit like a truck but if you manage it correctly you can solo them.
---
Hahaha. I would, but they don't make me more intelligent and paladins can't use staves so I am hurting as a healer right now, but I'll keep pushing forward.
---
I'M DOING MY PART
---
True but I'm just saying that's what an active subscription gets you
---
Someone else posted in this thread saying they did it with no points in MoD at 40 and it was fine!
---
Oh shit we share cakedays! Happy cakeday!
---
Correct - rudeness is a well practiced tradition, lol.
---
I imagine it's just something to do with mages. But after reading these posts I wont be healing them as much anymore. Gonna start focusing on the tank more and of the mage dies he'll learn.
---
But like I said the sheep and water make up for it.
---
I'm still fairly low level, and this is what I tend to notice. As a holy paladin I usually end normal combats with no less than half mana in dungeons, while the locks and mages are empty
---
The commitment to the arcanite reaper angles made this for me
---
I've been trying that, the mobs stay in the same place, I dont move layers. Do the friends have to be in my zone?
---
Yeah, I got mine in about 10-15 min.
---
the only thing true in the statement is the lightwell stuff
---
I wonder what they think about modern WoW truthfully. I feel like modern WoW feels like a very arcadey inyourface version of older WoW whereas classic feels like a real RPG. In modern WoW one of the biggest things that bugs me is transmog for instance, in classic what you see is what you get. You instantly know if a player is in quest gear or has bad ass epics and has seen some top end shit to get to where they are. Plus there's just this oh shit effect in world pvp when you see a dude decked in epics coming at you. In retail you even see people questing in over the top flashy tier gear and it's so bizarre.
---
Refreshing to hear, and what I figured! :) Thank you.
---
Pretty sure anything under lvl 30 is high supply low demand.
---
Sure that's fine too. If you're a casual player though you might have trouble keeping yourself in materials/gold.
---
I‚Äôve gotten some world drops that are all for the 10-19 bracket. All mail, and bought Redbeard Crest for 60silver. Hoping to make a few gold by holding them, but if not I will make my own warrior or pally twink.
---
Alright. Thanks for taking the time.
---
Dude, I can't wait to get ^^^^rid ^^^^of these.
---
Could have sworn it was STV, but obviously not since it hasn't been edited.
---
What changes for you in phase 2?
---
In retail it can be used in combat but has a 2 min cooldown.
---
Voodoo tablets quest sucks.  Especially that one. Mob pathing there is borked too. Was there the other night -it was reminiscent of crushbone zoneline with huge trains of pathing mobs that couldn‚Äôt seem to find their way back to their spots.
---
I thought that was spell crit?
---
My thought was after Icecrown and the fall of the Lich King, what if instead of Deathwing being the dragon aspect that loses it, Nozdormu becomes Murozond (End Time dungeon, end of Cata) early and we deal with the fallout of that, or potentially attempt to reverse/stop it, creating a new timeline?
---
This way we get the game thru where many people agree "peak WoW" was, and then get new content afterward.
---
For real.  On my healer I usually tell people to keep pulling until i say stop.  As long as noone actually dies, me still drinking while the tank charges in is no big deal.
---
Even guild chats are dead in retail. It took a while in classic for me to find a guild that was actively talking.
---
I have leveled engineering to 300 twice for the death ray and battle chicken then back to goblin for the sappers :) haha and 60 with all 300 profs what a grind that was but it‚Äôs over can focus on gear now
---
You also forgot what the "print screen" button does.
---
Holy sheet.  How?  Solo or help from people?  I am 29 and only 130 each.
---
You know who hates original ST and BRD? Scrubs. Don't be a scrub that likes linear loot hallways.
---
As a warrior main for years I rolled rogue this time, but who knows what the future holds, I might make a warrior.
---
Exactly what you describe here is what makes classic as brilliant as it is. This game brings people together, people don't care about getting to 60 in a rush, or get epic drops, people adventure, do fun stuff, walk for 30 minutes to get new hands from a quest reward. I find it amazing the way you describe how you felt last night and I hope you, and we all will get more of these moments through out azeroth.
---
Ah, makes sense. As a lock, I wish I had a buff I could give when people give me stamina.
---
Nah. Anyone that plays fps's rebinds a and d to strafe, q and e to spells. There is no reason to have turn keys when you can turn with your mouse.
---
i think you have to reloadui after getting new ranks to fix macros. or put ranks in the macros themselves.

God I wouldn't know dude. Vanilla Gold was a different beast then the later xpac's. Buying your 40 mount a feat, buying your Epic mount....you felt God tier for sometime. Now I remember playing Vanilla but I couldn't tell you the Enchant prices. It varied greatly dependent on the enchant, how hard it was to farm said enchant recipe and also how hard it was to get the mats.
---
If you wanna get an idea, look up what is required just to farm the Crusader enchant.
---
I used to use gyazo and got annoyed when people shit talked it but seriously, switch to ShareX it's so much bette.r
---
Because half of it was a copied from Return of the King. Not saying it was bad or copying was bad, but at least give credit to the OG that is Tolkien.
---
My favourite is somewhere in between the Vanilla trailer, the WotLK one, and the Warcraft III cutscenes, but I can't decided yet.
---
Classic always was for casuals. Ask eq players.
---
But wtf is bad about being a casual?

---
We dont have real res but honestly, we have enough heals to last a whole 5-6 mob pulls or a boss (plus innervate is op), battle res can also be useful especially in critical moments. Since there is always that one man that SHOULDN'T die (except us healers) in a group in order to win a pull. Although I do understand the pain cuz i main resto druid and ppl in my guild does say resto druids are shitty... but, if we play our cards right, we top any healer out there :P RESPECT TO ALL RESTO DRUIDS
---
They're pretty decent quality. Washing them you just can't put them in the dish washer and gently washing them with a rag is harmless.
---
You think a regular ass thing, is a bug, and youre bitching like a retail baby. Yeah man, youre an idiot through and through. I wasn't "resorting" to name calling. It was the only appropriate response.
---
The sails in bfa aren reflected either i think
---
ok let me adress this.
---
I dont think speech can opress anyone, opression is a strong word.
---
I feel like we shouldnt compare people (and children) speaking online with authoritarian governments (like china or nazi germany)
---
You weaken the meaning behind opression, if you call every little thing opression. (its like the boy who cries wolf, maybe lets only call opression where it actually happens, like in china or other parts of the world)
---
To the thing about slurs=government putting people in jail, you are right the US government does not do that right now.
---
(Im from germany, here insulting a person verbally is actually AGAINST the law and u may have to pay him for his damage in return if he feels hurt)
---
But when it comes to places like twitter or facebook or other private platform that are being used by more people then any public platform is.
---
They can apply their own Laws and Rules.
---
If you say the N-word (or F or R word)
---
You get banned in World of Warcraft and on twitter (idk about facebook)
---
And i feel like a permanent ban for those words, is actually just one step behind "jail", you suspend peoples accounts permanently for speech.
---
The last thing, which to me proves my point (at least abit)
---
Is how much you over react in your satirical comment at the end.
---
I just said i think you are on the wrong side.
---
No reason to compare THAT to a gas chamber or shit like that.
---
What do you say or compare north korean concentration camps to if u already get that worked up about my comment?
---
You want to have a safe space for everyone. 
---
In that process you dont care how much you have to discriminate, insult, hurt or attack people who are against you.
---
To me thats the definition of any authoritarian (fascist) regime.
---
If we arent careful your persuit of a safe world, destroy equality in the world.
---
If we truely are all equal, everyone should be able to say anything.
---
And you should not be able to forbid me any words (otherwise i could just forbid you the words that trigger me) 
---
And there is nothing that should give you power over me (or me power over you)
---
So just think about what world you want to live in.
---
A free one or a orpressed one, in which you get banned from all platform if you dont watch your speech.
---
(and it could go to an extreme where new rules come faster then u can learn them, and u simply dont know about those, spastic for example does not seem at all like a triggering word to me if im honest)
---
If you have any disability i really feel very sorry for you and i hope the world and modern medicine can help it (soon) 
---
But you really shouldnt try to forbit other people their speech.
---
We all free people and we all gotta accept that fact.
---
his retail boast was shit but I don‚Äôt see any keyboard warrior talk?
---
You can definitely AOE/speed-tank in Vanilla, I know because I did it.  
---
When you pull, taunt your primary target and then ignore it.  Let the DPS go bonkers on it (it will really get their pixels hard if you know what I mean).  Spend your time managing the others.  Blood rage, revenge spam, sunder and shouts - tab+spam.  All the mobs are gonna die.  You only need to focus on protecting the healer in most cases, because when the DPS pulls threat (which they will) the healer will go ham to save them usually, thus pulling aggro themselves.  
---
You should be ready to pull as soon as the healer is ready to go.  Essentially, tanking an instance is like driving a car.  You let the DPS get off on killing the current pack, you should already have eyeballed the next pack and determined who to target first.
---
I used to start in battle stance, pull, blood rage, clap, def stance, demo shout and cleave.  Tab+spam sunder, etc.  Eventually you parry and dodge more with gear and talents then your revenge spam will go off the hook and you'll have no problem.
---
I think if you get over that "i'm the wall that defends my party" mentality that a lot of new tanks have, you will have more fun and have less friction with players.  DPS know that if they pull threat that they could end up dead, and most of them have mechanics to mitigate that, let them use that stuff when they screw up.  Low level instances are not serious business and shouldn't be frustrating to you.  If your party can handle the pull, let them.  You're literally a team of 5 people spending an equal amount of time on something, you gotta find middle ground - that goes for you and them.
---
Don't give up, just lighten up.  If the instance party sucks, leave and go back to questing - no one can force you to stay.  Alternatively, just straight up say "I'm not interested in aoe/cleave" if that's a deal breaker for them then at least you sorted that before you got to the instance.  But I think rerolling is a bit dramatic.  Good luck!
---
&gt;I am looking for a semi-balanced population and queue times around 1-2k
---
Do we tell him?
---
I don't spend any money on food. I always start my questing day by asking for 40 x conjured food from a mage in SW/IF. If I can't find one quickly I use food I gained through grinding. The bandages I use are the ones I needed to make for skill-up anyway.
---
I don't need demo shout for tanking leveling instances. Sweeping Strikes + 2H tanking while weaving taunts/MB works just fine. Maybe it's needed if you run with three mages AoE:ing, but I don't go out of my way to run that comp.
---
No, I didn't mean Blood Craze. I'm level 35 full Arms with 5/5 Tactical mastery. I meant Bloodrage, which is used to stay in combat to preserve rage, combined with bandage to make an immediate new pull possible.
---
And also, even accounting for the missed rage from the white auto-attack, HS is still more effective in terms of damage/rage compared to TC.
---
To be honest all servers are heavy horde in NA, I‚Äôd suggest staying alliance but finding a better server for sure...Fairbanks is nice, insta wines mostly peak hours an hour maybe and hour and a half if you‚Äôre unlucky
---
"God bless us, every one"
---
Of course
---
 **Windseeker - Alliance - NA**
---
Currently a level 15 Night Elf Priest. tend to play all day long and would love to have a leveling partner. as a priest using Holy spec damage is pretty lacking so solo leveling is a bit tough. would love to have someone to roll with till the eventual goal of 60 and beyond. feel free to add on Discord @ Jokerlolz#4696
---
Have a good one :)
---
ah gotcha how do i set up a modifer is that something i can do in the base game or do i gotta get an add on?
---
I'd go a step further, and say it's not even to keep everyone alive, but to perform enough healing to allow the group to complete the content. Especially in raid content, there will be triage decisions that require tactically letting someone die.  It's not so apparent in 5 mans, but sometimes letting a dps die will save you enough resources to keep the tank alive.
---
This made me laugh pretty hard, my wife just woke up :')
---
I think it would be significantly better as a main hub for players compared to stormwind, at least in an aesthetics sense. It‚Äôs very open design would be awesome to be able to look across the way and see tons of players in the other part of the city.
---
I think the reason there are people asking for TBC and WotLK are really simple. More people played them than Vanilla. It is no surprise that people want to play the version of the game they started with.
---
I've been trying to get this for so long... Let me know if you manage to find a way
---
Meanwhile I sold  5 stacks of briarthorn instead of leveling alchemy and got a few gold in the bank
---
how much does it hit for?
---
All that you've said I experienced and also enjoyed, but now at 40+ that old amazing rub has kind of come off which I felt 10-35. But playing slower is definitely I'm going to do moving forward.
---
Those people roll druids
---
Holy comments, I was going to read through until I saw how many there were. It was a pleasure killing the alliance at first, we messed up when our raid leader told us to go to Redridge. We should have stayed in duskwood.
---
Look forward to future battles!
---
I‚Äôve used it 5 times and all were almost exactly 1k. Which is weird, not even close to PServer hits. pServers were 300-who knows what. Sometimes 3k
---
Because if people took 2 seconds to Google "record gameplay on windows" and 10 seconds to download a program (shareX) they would be doing it quicker than they would on their phone...sharex even automatically uploads it for you. If you take a video of your computer on your phone you are lazy.
---
Man people on here are so dumb. Just because they shouldn't take damage doesn't mean they don't and that you should only heal them in emergencies. Like it's the "principle" of the thing? 
---
Same type of person as the smug tanks back in the day, where if someone aggros they just let them die
---
Sure let me leave the entire party at 50%, so if the tank loses aggro for one second the DPS can get one shot. Fucking idiots circle jerking over a moronic thread lmao 
---
Especially in dungeons, you guys know you can drink while the tank pulls right? 
---
Glad most of you guys are still questing in Westfall :)
---
Here's an actual PSA: Unless you're actually going to go oom before the pack / boss dies - try topping everyone off.
---
Wanted to get into a new game.
---
Babies who want loot hallways hate Gnomer,ST,BRD, etc.
---
Not on Paladins at least.
---
Flash of Light is spammable even at the highest rank you have, with a very nice mana/health ratio.
---
Pala healing in dungeons is just wait for them to get low-ish, then spam Flash until full, then do nothing until you have regen enough to do it over again
---
This has a converse though.  Mana remaining is unused healing.  It doesn't really matter yet, but one sign of a bad healer is being more conservative with their mana so they don't need to use consumables.
---
you are a godless heretic. Be glad you don't play on Failrina, or it wouldn't matter how many of Asmun's garbage Empire of Man knockoff's you bring, we'll still steamroll you.
---
was a fun read though :)
---
It's faster to just grind dungeons if all you care about is xp/hr.
---
&gt; would of
---
This is crazy
---
Say it isn't so, father!
---
Renew is actually kind of inefficient in terms of heals from what I remember.
---
I've had an issue like this, opening the macro menu, selecting the effected macro then exiting the menu fixes it for me.
---
&gt;MikScrollingBattleText
---
Got a link for that?
---
I agree. I an lvl 32 on my main and I made a Dwarf warrior last night. Got the Warrior to lvl 8 then sent him some green boe gear from the ah on my main. The dwarf is pretty tough for a lvl 9 now. 
---
Doing this for a warrior when your main is at 60 would be a great idea.
---
While I'm not disagreeing with you, I didn't make the rule here. I started calling BFA retail because everyone else was to differentiate between the 2.
---
Undead warlock named smeagle. I hate you, made my life hell in burning steppes. I'm 60 now bitch, let's go.
---
I love world PvP. It's great cause he recognizes me as well. We see each other and it's instant fighting, even if we have mobs on us we will both die to kill each other. Love it
---
No enchants? Pffftt cheap ass
---
Taking a break is never a bad idea. Except in a relationship.
---
There-a-no-more
---
On this note, the timer for the 5 second rule begins when the cast lands and not begins.  There's nothing wrong (actually you should be doing this if you have a long cast heal) with starting the cast, only to interrupt it if it's not required.
---
I've heard there's a few twinks happy to  help you get on top.
---
I think everyone has seen it at this point.
---
it is crazy addictive. welcome!
---
There‚Äôs your issue...just have to remote into your computer via your phone a few hours before work is over and queue.

Mark+Thorns on pet, then Mark on Hunter :) &lt;3

Buddy of mine and I consider that grind a rite of passage for a Horde rogue on a PvP server.

Everyone is so nice and wants to meet up immediately! They keep asking how big I am, which I guess is just WoW slang for what level I am and they‚Äôre all super impressed even tho I‚Äôm just a 10! Such a great community.

Haha

You learn gnomish in STV and goblin in ratchet.
---
Buzzek in tanaris can teach you artisan engineering.

Can't get this working on my priest.
---
I unzipped it in my AddOns folder, but WoW does not recognize it at all.
---
he knows his gif's watch out for his master genius at work brother
---

---
or more likely to claim that he can't understand us which i get since he's naturally fucking stupid

YOURE GOOD YOURE GOOD YOURE GOOD

My guild camped Nessingway for 45 min last night.  Took down the Alliance raid there and continued to camp after they left.  Welcome to open world STV pvp.

You can actually profit even still on retail using AH add-ons to scan below vendor price. 
---
I have no idea why this is a thing but across the years I've made hundreds of gold and I rarely ever remember to do it.
---
I mean you do, but it's on a 30 minute timer :D
---
Need an add-on like miks scroll combat text.
---
I was saying the other day we should be able to skin hunter pets
---
You really should
---
Oh shit I recognize some of these names. I'm in exile from Hillsbrad right now because I stirred up so much shit with you guys. All started cuz a lvl 32 orc warrior attacked me from behind while I was fishing and spat on me near Tarren Mill. I have 3 names on a notepad next to my computer. I love how stuff escalates in this game.

People that cry about free speech when others ask them not to use slurs care more about the slurs than the free speech.

As long as a lock box isn't automatically yours...this meme is accurate.
---
That intelligence level sounds about right for an alliance player
---
That first jump was NOT worth the risk. Another half step up the spiral ramp would have made the hop ~99% successful.
---
I like Vendor Price.

The challenge was thrown, accepted, and completed!
---
True, I guess I'll look into both and see what I'd rather do
---
It runs fine the fan just makes a ton of noise. Also I‚Äôm a student I don‚Äôt really have the funds to build a gaming computer. 
---
If you‚Äôre feeling charitable I can pm you my Venmo though
---
I honestly would do the same thing in your situation. You just can‚Äôt pass up an opportunity like that. You did however lose a potential friend in the process. Definitely don‚Äôt expect an invite from that guy in the future lol
