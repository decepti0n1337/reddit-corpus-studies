Don't underestimate the power of +3% hit chance while leveling.
---
---
---
How long is the stress test for though?
---
Rock on home skillet!
---
The fact that you mention "making" your friends but a subscription probably means that they won't care about it.
---

---
Your best bet would be to show them why they should be interested in Classic. Explain why it's so great and how much there is to do. Show them some Kargaz or Madseasonshow videos and let them decide for themselves if they find the game interesting.
---
If they get more curious, they should have no problem spending $15 to try it out. If not, oh well, you can make many new friends in Classic.
---
That's when p3 will hit so bgs and bwl should help, but I doubt there will be any dead servers.
---
Middle of the day for the people who have a life lmfao.
---
Just level as ret.
---
You can heal dungeon just fine as ret so long as you have a healing set
---
&gt; Nah, I'd rather see them never introduce flying again
---
It is pretty astounding how people here can't seem to understand that Blizzard has the ability to make servers for each expansion.  He can have his WotLK and it will have zero impact on your ability to play Classic.
---
People tested this during beta, they managed to get levels 12-16 in 2.5 hours just grinding RFC
---
Which means always in Classic.
---
Take ret long enough to get the movement speed boost.
---
Best warlock spec is summon spec.
---
Video please :)
---
NO
---
I don't condone the low effort ones. This one is actually alright.
---
&gt;o
---
this is also a great idea!
---
Why would you want to do this?
---
Niiiiiice!
---
Go to Menethil Harbor or Booty Bay and catch a boat.
---
Break it up with sm
---
Yep. I've been getting dragged more and more into these shit discussions as well.
---
This place has turned into a meme fiesta and shitpost central. When you really do try to have a discussion about something people like this tard will barge in and try to drag everyone down to his level of stupid.
---
In short, r/classicwow has become a regular reddit game sub.
---
I sure hope not.
---
That's not what he said, though. He said "updating classic up until...".
---
I very specifically mentioned that if WotlK happens in any capacity I'd want it to be what you just described so I am absolutely puzzled how you can even think of starting your reply with 
---
&gt;It is pretty astounding how people here can't seem to understand that Blizzard has the ability to make servers for each expansion.
---
They aren't doing this stress test so people can have fun. They are testing hardware.....
---
Thex
---
Thix
---
Thax
---
Thox
---
Thux
---
And every other imaginable variant will be on every server now.
---
Come on kid, use your little grey cells.  The next thing they'll release is going to be TBC.  After TBC servers have been out for a while they'll release WotLK.
---
Ohhh I see.
---
Would I be able to go to menethil Harbor and then quest in Darkshore as a dwarf?  I think that would be ideal.
---
you are arguing over 15 sp that more likely than not you will not be getting. The website is clean and easy to use compared to a spread sheet/13 minute video.
---
Yeah, I think you're unfortunately on to something. Luckily Classic isn't far off so I'll be preoccupied by actually playing.
---
Yes, you can get over there at any level, but depending on your class you may want to wait until 10 or so.
---
"How can you not care about the world?!... 
---
Of Warcraft."
---
It's the circle of life. At least it was fun for a while.
---
Take care brother, and enjoy classic :D
---
very strange to see that many people saying they will play shaman. very surprising considering shaman usually make up about 5-6% overall.
---
Maybe Blizz will give us a new quest to find Thex's wife.
---
Getting Consecration isn't terrible-terrible if you're often in a group. It chews up mana, though.
---
Spiritual Focus is enough to heal while leveling. 
---
https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?c=paladin&amp;t=HBHCHDHEHFHcHdHeHgHf
---
After that you can go deep ret. SF + conc aura = no spell pushback when you're healing.
---
Anecdotal. We had a very active R14 community on our server. I've heard of a couple burnouts but from my experience that was hardly the majority.
---
At the end of the day, though, I want to make it clear that I am not disagreeing with - let's say being worried about the private lifes of R14. I merely think that there will be some for who it will be worth it. 
---
As for the quitters, they're not the ones who'll be running around with this gear so they are out of this argument :p
---
Unless you don't have room in your budget and can't get overtime at work or you enjoy farming for gold.
---
Do not tell anyone but Hycan is in his house.
---
4% spellpower is 4%....also it doesn't give any alternatives that you can get...nor does it tell you how much spellpower to aim for on each of its items that have "random enchant" on them. So yea ok if you want quickness then by all means use a less accurate guide
---
I think your window of opportunity is before launch.

Those two songs always take me back to Vanilla WoW PvP.
---
Considering you just accused me of something that is very evidently untrue I am confused by you acting all smug about brain cells
---
Is that the top half or the bottom?
---
There was a group of people doing this during the beta on stream and Tips references them in his "It's finished" video, thats as much as I can give you atm. But seeing as dungeon exp is 2.5x normal, it's certainly not out the realm of possibility it will carry on through higher levels too
---
Yeah, fuck no. That was the original promise they made when they gave us the new models in the WoD pre-patch.
---
Or tbc servers.  Changing classic would be the worst option because although it may appeal to a few it would ruin the game for the others who didn’t want that option.
---
The g600 is a gamechanger dude! I wore one out after like 8 years of solid use and got another. Absolutely worth every penny. I actually need a second one now for my wife
---
The path I was suggesting was for running over to menethil without running through wetlands. You could actually run there at lvl 5 or 6 and not miss much. 10 would be best so you can finish your class quest for defensive stance first.
---
Dear diary
---
Defensive stance and a 1h green weapon would be race specific I believe.
---
pls b ~~trex~~ true
---
These are the Vanilla graphics I remember.
---
Nah just an experienced and r14 spriest that’s peeved at the ignorant boner this subreddit has for the class. You really proved your point though
---
They might start putting these bad boys back on store shelves.

Upvote for Thex.

The Nicker
---
I’m just playing Chrono Trigger again. It’s my go-to game while waiting for release dates.
---
Myself.
---
League of Legends, can’t wait to jam classic around a less toxic community 😂
---
They subbed for beta
---
Or how about a Rogue and name it Stabbathu!
---
I've been playing Harry Potter on my phone. Walking around is pretty darned different than playing WoW, so I figure it won't have any sort of bleed-over effect and make me burn out quickly on Classic.
---
Also, the calories I burn should make my soon-to-be morbid obesity take a bit longer to kick in.
---
Can i get in without an active sub?
---
Do you need an active sub for the classic download to be an option? I still only have modern on my app
---
Same. I got it for ios so I don’t have to emulate it
---
Just tell them to unsub from netflix, spotify, prime etc etc.
---
For those in AUS (AEST) its Friday 9th Aug at 4:00 am.
---
yay?
---
well almost all multiplayer games are free to play nowadays and we've been playing dota for ages. it's not like they're desperate for another game, i'd just really like to try it with them for a little. and 13€ is a slightly outdated single player game on sale you'd have forever. we also only really find the time to play together with all people once a week. i'd be happy to have a trial and i'm sure there's people who feel the same, but i also understand the hardcore players searching the new tab can't relate lol
---
Besides myself?
---
Now imagine being AWST
---
I'll name my undead warlock Lockathex.
---
Oh it’s the WORST when they’re chill until a girl joins VC then they try to take over every conversation and be loud or obnoxiously unfunny
---
It’s awkward for everyone because it’s so obvious and the person doing it isn’t very charming
---
This was great, thank you.
---
&gt; We ask that players please log-in and play as much Thex as possible during the first two hours of the test – 11:00 a.m. PDT to 1:00 p.m. PDT, as that is when we’ll be actively monitoring for Thex issues important to launch.
---
My shit ass PC can van run it. Hype.
---
The only healer in Classic that doesn't cut the mustard is Druid because HoTs of the same type don't stack and they don't have a 'proper' rez or a spammable emergency heal. Even so, healing is so in-demand that a Resto Druid will easily be able to find a spot in a raiding guild.
---
As far as Shaman vs. Paladin is concerned, they both fill different healing roles in a raid. Paladins are single-target healers while Shamans are multi-target healers, and they both fill their particular niche better than a Priest, which is more of a general-purpose one-size-fits-all healer in vanilla.
---
Middle of the day on a weekday to stress the servers? Good for Europe I guess but horrible for NA
---
There is no plan.
---
I played a warrior all throughout vanilla, and I think people who are new to the class really need to be told some harsh truths about the class so they know what they're getting themselves into. Will you eventually have a rewarding experience? Yes. But you have to put up with a lot, and I mean A LOT of bullshit. Moreso than any other class.
---
You WILL be the slowest leveling class.
---
You WILL get ganked a lot and there's really not a whole lot you can do about it unless you're in a group because you're the weakest 1v1 class in the game. Limited mobility, very easy to CC, and really no self heals besides finding an opportunity to bandage = GG.
---
Soloing WILL be difficult. An elite mob that is the same or near same level as you will destroy you unless you are in full epics.
---
If you join a serious raiding guild, expect them to put serious pressure on you to spec prot if you want a raid spot and/or want to tank. 
---
If you decide you want to raid as a dps warrior, prepare to have a difficult time finding a raid spot. And once you do, you will be bottom tier DPS until you are at least BWL/AQ40/Naxx level geared.
---
If you're a tank and you want to have fun toys like Ashkhandi to have fun outside of raids and be a PVP God, too bad. The DPS warriors in your raid will most likely get priority on that. Which leads me to my next point:
---
If you don't want to be an MT or OT and just want to chill in the back and be a dps warrior who only tanks the occasional trash mob every now and then, make that known to your raid leaders early on! 
---
Also, don't let your guild pressure you or funnel you into one role or the other. If you want to raid as dps then stick to your guns and tell them you want a raid spot as a dps warrior. Similarly, if you want to be a tank but your guild doesn't want to give you a tanking spot, then go find a guild that WILL give you a tanking spot. Play the game in the way that makes you happy! I can't stress this enough. 
---
I've seen many a warrior (including myself) take up the mantle of tank because they genuinely wanted to help their guild succeed, only to burn out later on and start to get resentful that their fellow dps warriors got priority on all the fun toys like ashkhandi and chromatic boots and whatnot, while they're having to be prot spec and can't even farm outside of raids unless they have an alt. Know what you want and make that choice early on because once you do there's no going back. Tank burnout is a very real thing and it sucks for a guild to funnel all this tanking loot to their MTs and OTs only for them to quit 6 months down the road.
---
Be prepared for big repair bills.
---
If you want to have fun in BGs, unless you're decked out in BWL/AQ40/Naxx gear and have an Ashkhandi or Dark Edge along with a pocket healer, prepare to die. A lot. As I said above, vanilla warriors were an absolute uphill battle to play as in pvp. 
---
If you plan to be a very extroverted player, make lots of friends and constantly roll in groups, then a lot of my points are moot. You will have a good time. Especially as a pvp'er where warriors are absolute wrecking balls when they have a healer. THIS IS NOT A CLASS FOR INTROVERTS! Warriors moreso than any other class absolutely shine when they're in a group.
---
I think I've touched on most of the points I wanted to make. This post is probably coming across as bitter and resentful and I really didn't mean for it to, but it's mainly because I made a lot of mistakes back then that I wish I could have sidestepped. Also I'm a pretty introverted player and even though I raided through most of the content back then save for the last half of Naxx, outside of raids I was kind of a loner, and I think this really hurt my experience a lot as a warrior in vanilla.
---
I'm not saying you wont have fun. You probably will. In fact I will be rolling a warrior alt at some point because I'm a masochist and enjoyed tanking in vanilla. But just know that there is an absolute mountain of bullshit you have to deal with. With that being said though, for some that makes it even more rewarding. At the end of the day, play the game the way you want to play it and have fun.
---
Keep up with everyone? No.
---
Keep up with the median? Sure.
---
Eventually experience all the content? Yes.
---
Exactly, I’d put my money on wow classic becoming an umbrella for the rerelease of BC and Wotlk. Now with that said vanilla realms and expansion realms should probably be separate. The reason I would bet they take this course is it’s easy money cost significantly less than developing new content from scratch. It will help reduce the drop in subs when an expansion is received poorly in the live game.
---
&gt; less toxic community
---
lol
---
Don't worry mate. It took them years and years to split RuneScape and Old School RuneScape.
---
^shudders
---
Even naxx?
---
Seriously, can we be friends? You are the first person I've met that openly admitted to playing alliance. All my friends are opting horde...
---
What is dura loss?
---
Snagged one. Thex be with you.
---
What the Thex your problem?
---
And as soon as people find out?
---
yeah i’m sure, i also have a full gaming desktop so i’ll be able to play either way. just would like to not replace my macbook for when i travel since it’s still kicking ass for everything else
---
I think semi-casual guilds will enter and clear some wings of naxx eventually, the only real wall is four horseman as getting 8 tanks with the required pieces to not miss any taunts can be nasty.
---
Durability loss. It gives your enemies a repair bill. Killing another player doesn't damage weapons and armor, but killing someone by mind controlling them and making them jump off a cliff or running them into a bunch of mobs does.
---
They're a lot less difficult on beta than private servers, though still challenging, its not to the point where you can do everything perfectly and still die.
---
The stealth buff I want to happen is that instances are shared between Horde and Alliance.  If the Horde have an active raid going, and no Alliance are in it, when the first Alliance group enters the instance, they're put into the Horde instance.  Full on PVP flagging happens.  GL HF
---
Probably warlock with mage as a close second.  
---
A well played warlock just has soooooo many tools.
---
Pjosk seems like a good name to me
---
Most guild will be raiding around 3-4 hours 3 days a week.
---
You'll probably need another 10ish hours per week outside of raids to farm for raid consumables. Maybe less depending on server economy and guild expectations.
---
Then however many additional hours you want to dedicate to other activities such as pvp and alts.
---
So if you can dedicate about 20 hours per week (part time job) to wow, you should be able to raid.
---
Everyone will experience the content who wants to. Even if they buff it to 1.0 difficulty, casual guilds will see it and clear it, though if it's 1.0 difficulty, they might not full clear it the first week like they would otherwise. 
---
I think you're greatly understimating how much of a joke MC/BWL/ONY are with 1.12 talents + 16 debuff slots + buffed itemization..... it's legit looking for raid level ez.
---
Attack speed debuff never hurt.  Thunderfury was being used on the regular until Sunwell release by people who had one.
---
So... world bosses.
---
I know you’ve already gotten quite a few replies about the G600 but here’s one more vote for it. I was just in the same boat as you and ended up pulling the trigger on the G600 for less than half the price of the Scimitar or Naga. Superb mouse so far both in form and functionality. My hands aren’t enormous by any means but this mouse is incredibly comfortable for a palm grip for me, while still allowing full accessibility to the thumb keys. And the G-shift button is actually awesome, it allows you to shift to an entirely new set of keybinds on the fly. I’ve found it super useful so far. I used to use a Naga years ago fwiw, and I honestly like the G600 better so far, especially in terms of comfort.
---
I suppose, guess we'll have to wait for launch - no doubt RFC will be faster than barrens but I'm not convinced by any of the SM runs since they were 30bis and people who were out questing were not very far behind.
---
Horde.
---
Solo player.
---
Will play with 100+ping.
---
Love PvP.
---
PuG Raiding probably, hate having a schedule to play.
---
Warlock or Hunter ?
---
Oh duh lol. Thanks mate
---
Yes, but as a surprise.  The freak out that would happen the first time it was encountered would be never forgotten by either side.
---
That some people think it's a "joke" doesn't matter at all. Blizzard is not going to buff the difficulty of raids in Classic for any reason. Everyone knows exactly what Classic is going in - if that doesn't appeal to you, don't fucking play.
---
Oh okay, I feel you. I've been looking into laptops just so I can play WoW while I'm on the go.
---
Blizz won't be changing encounters - at least not on purpose. They've been pretty open with their intention to recreate the experience without changes.
---
That being said - I think you're underestimating how bad the baddies are. Lava Surgers in MC are gonna have a field day.
---
The difficulty of vanilla raiding was always the social elements - getting 40 people who can follow 1 or 2 mechanics while only goofing off in chat/vent minimally.
---
So what exactly happened to that spell/ability. Before and after?
---
Its a mmo not a 100yd dash.  The content will still be there if you take an entire year to level.
---
Not for a 1 day stress test. Maybe if it started Friday morning and went until Monday
---
And look where its at now. Dumpster fire. Don’t waste your time trying to convince me.
---
Same thing for [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=23219/girdle-of-the-mentor](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=23219/girdle-of-the-mentor) Instead of Ragna belt in phase 6,  
---
But i'm not sure of this, it's 20 Attack power against 1% crit.
---
Yeah, some people work the vaunted 12-8.  They are the envy of the work force!
---
Since when does simplicity determine fairness?
---
I don't care to convince you. Your micro opinion on the macro success of later WoW expansions doesn't matter. BFA has already generated more revenue than Classic ever will.
---
Does target need to be hostile? What if it’s a non hostile mob
---
I mean sure however in the valor set he’s always at 2+ vs 1.
---
You can still be ok with a paladin support.
---
Even in TBC that was a problem, even with summoning stones, etc. I remember being on "stone duty", spam summoning everyone. Getting responses like "summon me again in 5, just finishing something up", or worse "Summon pls" right after everyone zones in. UGGHHhH
---
The new Dacio Sandero is coming?!
---
Are you not aware that the RTS game Warcraft is not the same as the MMO World of Warcraft?
---
This looks about right. There could be one more EU English PVP, US East PVP and US West PVP realm (2 total each).
---
I avoid tipsout like the plague anyways.
---
100% you will have time to experience enough content that is meaningful and fun. 
---
https://youtu.be/6V9FyWhtT5M
---
Here is a good video explaining how someone with just 5 - 10 hours a WEEK can experience fun content
---
The only things they could possibly stealth change are numbers (armor, damage, health, resistances) and we have more than enough Vanilla footage to compare those to.
---
I feel like you are just reacting without reading. The whole thread that your responding to is just about how I had to make a plate only BiS list to play MY way. I've never changed my argument you just didn't read very carefully which is half the fun of you making arguments against a point I never made.
---
I would also love to know, frm what I can see though, they have not yet decided on that
---
I've never once mentioned resto shamans. Again, like with the warrior vs shaman debate, I'd primarily base it on attendance. Do you think the resto shaman should get it in all cases just because he specs resto? Why would you give a resto shaman, who's raiding as resto, priority on a weapon he can't hold without a respec?
---
How do you know if we played vanilla or not?
---
I’m still active on them.  Getting flagged does not get you banned, believe me. I’ve had posts completely removed from downvotes and reports  and not gotten a ban.  The process normally is you get a message saying your post was removed from a mod, you get a 24 hour ban until it’s further reviewed then you get an email on the ‘worst’ thing you said. 
---
Don’t get me wrong though you can get banned for really dumb shit.  One of my bans was talking to this guy, who was famous on the forums for saying “If they use 1.12 AV I’m leaving these forums and never touching classic”.  But I saw him posting everyday months later so I simply said “Hey I thought you said weren’t goin to post anymore, what’s up?” And got a week ban.
---
I’m just saying to get a 1000 year ban you gotta do more than just that.
---
Not on launch there won't be. There's just no reason to have multiple servers of the same region+timezone+language+type until Blizzard has actual numbers from Classic launch and can better project what the concurrent player population will be at the start of Phase 2.
---
Und mein Bogen
---
Oh, man, you're so clever. Such original ideas in your post.
---
haha that actually sounds kinda familiar to some of the stuff going on with the beta lol
---
I wasn't being serious.
---
You dont need 60. Save hours by doing it at 58 or 59.
---
You can heal all dungeon content as ret if you keep and int set. Leveling is long and doing it holy will add so unnecessary time to the leveling process.
---
That is absolutely false lol
---
Ok dude.
---
Amazing thank you so much
---
North made a [Preraid PvP guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orHNEYnkkbM) for mages a while ago. You might have to swap out a few pieces since you're a warlock but it should be usable for the most part.
---
I am Thex from Costa Rica,  Mucho gusto!
---
What happens September 4th?
---
Got one! Thanks for the heads up!
---
I think it's because we have lives now. We need to afk and what is better then some stealth. my guess I don't play alliance.
---
Wow that's a lot of words my dude
---
How can anyone be entertained by this or think this is an accurate representation of what we will see anytime soon on classic? He is fighting solo in blue dungeon set against an obvious Naxxramas premade. 1/10
---
Uhh, no. Priest is the defacto main healing class in Vanilla WOW.
---
Why is that a problem? We can only get through it as fast as they give it to us. Also, not everyone is going to be hardcore like they claim. People have forgotten what its like to get 40 people to execute mechanics to perfection. The first firelord most raids encounter is going to cause a wipe.
---
All I jad to do was mention the game. His eyes lit up and all of a sudden he was even more excited than I. I Didn't have to advertise the game to him.
---
I think this is more a reddit education issue more than subreddit problem.
---
Nice
---
But if you’re getting hammered by a boss you can have infinite rage in situations, so the faster the better.
---
Secretly im a Gnome like everyone speculates. Its just a tiny chair/desk/room/house that makes me appear normal size. SSSHHHH...
---
Horde has meaner looking dudes. But Alliance has "nicer" looking dudes.
---
Horde women are ugly as fuck and not really mean looking. But Alliance women are hot, especially the gnomes.
---
You're losing 'meanness' for 'prettyness'. I don't think it's a huge loss I.M.O.
---
How many gameplay changes?
---
#nochanges
---
There isn't really an "Idiot Noob's Guide to WoW" that will have any value to a complete video game virgin.
---
Your best bet is to help him setup a private stream so you can see his screen on a second monitor. That way whenever he has any questions, you can walk him through it precisely. Just be super patient.
---
It's also a lot of people started on pve servers and never left because of friends and now it a fresh start with something a lot more fun.
---
Even if it lasts 8 months from launch to p3 - the game will be fine :)
---
I'm sure there are plenty of other people like myself that will never go back to retail wow now that classic exists.
---
When I stop playing classic daily (probably phase 2) - whenever I get the mmorpg itch - classic will be there.
---
Can't have TBC if classic isn't a monstrous hit, and I plan to do everything in my power to make sure it is.  Mostly by paying my sub and a few other friends I am trying to get in on the fun.
---
They're lubing.
---
Lol I squinted when i read “boat to stormwind”.
---
I always level as Holy these days because 21 points in Holy buys you a ton of utility (10% int boost, Consecration, 70% pushback reduction, 12% increase to healing, free crit heals, a guaranteed free heal every 2 minutes). I usually stop once I get Divine Favor and then start filling out Ret, ending at a 21/0/30 spec, which allows me to main heal or DPS with a gear swap.
---
Many people dont have plans and are just waiting for a awesome opportunity to arise.
---
Night elves are the only race on alliance that does this run/swim.
---
Sucks to hear but best would be to just throw him in and hope he keeps up with it.
---
If he can't move around and attack things it's likely not going to pan out
---
Then we're reading very different threads, lol. People do not seem like they are satisfied with the general "Okay, but not better than warriors in 95% of cases"-status druid tanks currently have and want to see it bumped up.
---
Right rent Paladins can’t carry other ret Paladins
---
Ok thanks. I didn’t see that anywhere
---
That is another option. I struggle to think they would make separate servers for it though. I may be wrong. 
---
I am sure many others hold different beliefs about how the game should be managed; that’s just the inevitable direction I see for the game to grow at all. 
---
On a side note, what do private servers do after Naxx? Do their communities grow or dwindle or remain unchanged?
---
Hey, keeps us updated for those live streams !
---
Read this in Rags voice. It was satisfying.
---
This would be tons of fun. I'll keep an eye out for your stream :D
---
It either healed ppl at full health or only healed your party, cant remember which, its been a long time.
---
Yeah, I’m really not one to complain but what the hell is the hold up at this point?  Got 3 separate groups of good friends that I need to try and coax into the same server and being able to get in all of their separate ears sooner rather than later would sure be helpful.
---
Low IQ confirmed
---
It takes quite a long time to gear up an entire guild in each raid tier which will prolong the server enough by itself. Only the super tryhard guilds that split-raid MC by week three really stand a chance of being “done” with t1 by the time BWL launches, and those players aren’t going anywhere anyways.
---
No changes !
---
It’s almost like what company’s say and what they do don’t always match up...
---
Hopefully this month.
---
Get on it people!
---
Not to the player base. Do you work for blizzard or something? How long do you plan on keeping this going? Just so you know i might disappear for a bit later as I have a raid. I assure you I’ll be back to keep your attention though.
---
They should just have a different section for Retail and Classic  
---
Much like how Runescape split into Old School and RS3 on Twitch
---
You don’t need gear for those raids. Greens are enough.
---
The only base that Blizzard needs to care about is the shareholder base.
---
Each to their own I suppose
---
If I could pick, I would bring 8 resto shamans 1 priest and 1 Druid
---
The trial was 15 years ago
---
Yeah this is all people cared about on private servers. It was more intriguing to know that guilds could clear MC in under an hour. It devolved into memes whenever a guild said they got "world first" on xyz-pserver.
---
yeah who will carry them ?
---
So no healers? lol.
---
I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!
---
It's not quite that bad because mages/warlocks love crit and hit but spriest doesn't have as near much value for either so it's often pretty clear whether it's a spriest item or not.
---
Which is exactly why people that are in progression raids will have multiple raid teams and clear it more than once each week.
---
Those that just want to kill rag and uninstall will have that chance too.
---
Yeah you'll be fine. Most people playing will be working/school full time plus other obligations and priorities.
---
Genius!
---
Raids aren't the only thing people do in Vanilla WoW, its not retail it's not some holy grail everyone goes for. That was the beauty of it.
---
So far to be honest, I'm liking Mixer much more. Just the site/app itself I mean, I haven't really watched a heap of stuff on it yet.
---
Or ya know... the players that support the money that goes to said shareholders.
---
Keep in mind you'll have long periods of time in between school to put a lot of hours in if you are interested in raiding naxx - those hours will get you set up to only have to log in during raids :)
---
Remember a lot of guilds will not allow a priest to pass +55healing on a weapon for +30sp.
---
Eanchanting for 2sets of gear is extremely expensive too.
---
Felcloth item set is a good start. +150 shadow damage.
---
[removed]
---
Pretty fair if you aren’t accounting for super sad builds. Holy shadow weaving, hunter nightfall bitch, etc.
---
They said recently in an interview that they forced extra layering in the beta to test it, so here's hoping that they get the balance right!
---
I'm making it my mission to earn Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros some day. I don't care how long it takes.
---
ill sub when i can play
---
blizz sucked me into using a wow token to try and get into the beta
---
they cant test the servers themself cheap bitches it should be open to anyone who wants to try it to load up the servers and gague interest
---
Good suggestion. I think teamviewer is still free for personal use.
---
Removed as a repost.
---
I forgot about the Felcloth set, that helps. Enchanting would be for longer term items anyhow, the farming set would likely remain unenchanted.
---
Probably like 3/4th of people on reddit have very high thoughtd of themselves and see themselves in that leadership role. The reality is most won't cut it at all. I ran into someone that seemed exactly like the caricature of a WoW redditor and him trying to lead the dungeon was just bleh.
---
Micromanaging way too much, being way too controlling, and quite frankly doing a pisspoor job at tanking anyways. Being overly cautious and micromanaging like that just gets frustrating for people, good luck controlling a guild when everyone quits.

Just become a Guild leader and ninja loot it like that one druid chick did.
---
Sure if you think so
---
That’s my name
---
yeah true. There are a lot of variables that can be taken into consideration though. For example, quest choke points, there will be points where there are a lot of people grinding for a specific mob or drops.
---
In truth I think that a mix of both questing and dungeons is probably the way to go. For example, running a dungeon once efficiently and making sure you pick up every quest you can before entering and then maybe hitting it again straight afterwards once or twice to farm for a bit of loot and then heading back to questing, that's the way to go IMO
---
Well you can split the pick pocketed loot if you want to, I just won't force you to since it's too complicated, but by all means if you want to...
---
Can you please explain to me how I misinterpreted the message I quoted? It is clearly not the case unless that was pure sarcasm.
---
Whoah Whoah. As someone who answered the survey that way let’s be clear. I liked legion, so I bought BFA the day it came out. I have an active sub because I wanted to play on the stress test, and many others have active subs so they can play the beta. I did not like BFA and have not played it in months. I am currently playing on private servers. I’m not “addicted” to BFA.
---
Needs more Thex.
---
Maybe that’s why they had to take it down or whatever?
---
While I love Teamviewer, it is not a good solution for this. His father's experience will be greatly diminished. Just use Open Broadcaster System and rather than give Twitch the stream link, just open it with VLC.
---
Hunters cant use it. Only paladins warriors and rogues. Iirc
---
Are they though? I mean aren’t people quitting bfa? What happens when classic is bigger than bfa?

All the other stress tests were in the middle of the day on a weekday too, though.

It's my last semester of college, BS in Computer-Science (I live in the Bay Area)

I also work 28 hours per week at two part time jobs doing accounting :(

I've been using some simple math to tackle this:  
---
Using Joana's /played time of 4 days 20 hours to 60
---
116 hours
---
Assumed 6 hours / week of play time
---
I come up with 19 weeks to 60, so roughly 4 months
---
So let's say once a month, on  a Saturday, I get to play a full 6 hours.. I'm at about 15 weeks.
---
Change your name to Snowflake_tv
---
I think this is exactly what the doctor ordered
---
I want BRE on a hunter just to tilt all the warriors
---
I’ll spearhead the crusade against the sexual deviants in Goldshire.
---
It's not the slowest leveling class, stop lying to people.
---
If I never switch off of the classic client then I’m actually only missing the retail app in the list right? no problem.
---
I’ll give you live is more interesting once combat starts, but even then, live wow is a far cry from the pinnacle of most specs combat design—imo. 
---
I’d argue Wrath, Cata, MoP—despite being the “homogenization years” had the most interesting combat rotations. Especially as class sets altered your rotational priority from tier to tier. 
---
I’m sure some People prefer legion, wod, bfa rotations, but for me, many feel wack a mole, spammy, click-the-highlighted-button, builder/spender rotations.

That's what I'm sayin

not everyone, more like a handful. Definitely an overly forced meme.
---
Yet in the Bnet app Classic is under World of Warcraft together with Battle for Azeroth featuring BFA art.
---
My GTX760 died a couple of days ago. Currently on Intel HD 4600 and sadly it won't be enough even for leveling.
---
Also, very strange decision to not support integrated GPUs on Mac.
---
How is it an mmo?
---
In my experience on there you rarely see other players. If it is an mmo it's a dead one with no players. 
---
And how is it an rpg? There's no role-playing no meaningful decision making, no progression as everything scales with you. 
---
If it's not an mmo and not an rpg how can it be an mmorpg. 
---
Just because they call it that doesn't make it so. 
---
I could call watching Netflix an mmorpg but it doesn't make it one.
---
Uhhh....what? That doesn't sound like clientside data
---
These kind of comments is why I love making Druid content! I hope it answered some questions bro, best of luck to you come launch!!
---
I have flair now
---
Maybe, but until Blizzard has actual launch day player population numbers, it's the best decision they can make.
---
because shammies could do it better anyway :P
---
I mean... I use a regular mouse. Not like I'm using the pad lol.
---
And gnome shaman..... I want mini totems xd
---
Just be a Warrior Enabler class, a healer.
---
flasks for tanks to lesser the chance the only way vanilla raid will wipe you, a tank dying
---
you have to be subbed to play it, btw its up to level 15 not 20
---
&gt;Coming from DAoC, would I like classic WoW?
---
Tl;DR: Yeah, probably.
---
I remember my friends calling me a huntard if I needed anything.
---
Not in classic tho. Blizzard opened it up to more later on
---
Someone made a post about how to name your character easily by using the first 2 letters of your name and the 3rd and 4th letters of your country. Example: Bill from Canada would be Bina. Tom from Australia would be Tous.
---
He ended the post by saying "my name would be Thex" and every comment that follows was about skipping the rules and naming themselves Thex. It's silly, but it's a classic meme right now. 
---
Tldr; we're hungry for content and starting to go delusional
---
got changed somewhere down the line, amongst the first who got a thunderfury was a raidleader/guildmaster as a hunter cause nobody back then knew what those bindings could be used for
---
Gotta be a pocket healer. Priest is the strongest comp in my opinion.
---
Just start calling him Thex, it will stick eventually. I’ve been calling my 3 year old human child Thex all week, it’s working.
---
there's literally already guilds full of dedicated raiders who have been doing this together for a long time.
---
This is also what I've read from a few sources but as always there is tons of info out there.
---
yeah, people with real jobs work 12s, what is this 8 hour pansy shit?
---
I have a problem. After months of endless change, I finally decide to roll a druid. As I spent most of my time lhg Alliance, I was decided to roll Horde to get a fresh feeling.  
---
But I reaaaallly don't like Tauren. It's a race that never clicked for me. I don't like being "big and slow", I don't like their mount, I don't like the look of sets on them.  
---
So I have 3 options :  
---
1 try  it anyway   
---
2 play Alliance, nelf is far better for me, but that also mean I won't be able to reroll Shaman easily (was my second choice)   
---
3 back to the class choice
---
Prove it because that seems [wrong](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Thunderfury%2C_Blessed_Blade_of_the_Windseeker).  Look at the section on patch note changes.
---
it's all super easy because we use flasks and what not. the challenge is the speed we can do it in
---
yes
---
I was a holy paladin on a private server about a year ago that had 95% pre raid bis gear and I feel like I can play my class well. I was able to do Tier 1 Raids (Molten Core and Onyxia) easily provided you can do fight mechanics properly. I never got to do The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj (Tier 2 40man) but I did do Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj (Tier 2 20 man) and it was challenging-doable, but the mechanics were more difficult to accomplish. I was given the opportunity to tag along in a Naxxramas group (Tier 3 40 man) and I pulled every trick, consumable and effort I could muster. I truly gave it 100% and I could just not keep up with the next to last boss raid pulsing frost damage when healing just my group of 5 people. Someone had to help me. 
---
TLDR : In my experience while wearing Pre Raid BiS and you know how to play your class, T1 is easyish, T2 is challenging-hard, T3 is impossible.
---
NO CHANGESSSSSSSS
---
if it's requires more than the minimum amount of efford people will not bother anyway
---
Ah, earlier today the the first "leaked notes" said 20.
---
I feel like you're overestimating the difficulty of melee groups
---
progress? 
---
didn't like a handful of officers get banned for account sharing tho?
---
An extra con for paladin/warrior while leveling is shared gear.
---
Ouch.
---
played a little last night after about a week off now my wrist is red cause the wife was sitting beside me on her phone and she snapped it for me every time lol
---
This is so meta
---
You would very much like Phase 1 and 2, not Phase 3 so much.
---
This feels right.  I mean the Orc vs. Human is obviously a classic Warcraft trope, but the fight against Ragnaros is a very iconic WORLD of Warcraft memory.
---
Anybody else stuck deciding between class and race? I think I'll enjoy playing Paladin the most but I'd also really miss the Forsaken lore.
---
As a rogue on pserver shadow priest was the only class that scared me 1v1
---
As others say, play what you don't mind looking at for hours and days. 
---
I don't really like dwarf but decided to level a dwarf hunter because I had already rolled Night Elf as another class. 
---
I got my Dwarf to 60 and then never touched him again. 
---
I hate to be making you change your mind again, but I would suggest to make the switch!
---
Some guy made a post asking what people are playing and he included that he’s playing a troll shaman named thex. Then everyone was saying how they’re going to steal the name. And so, a meme was born
---
I stayed away from a lot of the private server stuff so I honestly wouldn't know who does what but thanks for the knowledge man,
---
Just download the Battle net client. It's on a dropdown menu on the WoW tab of the client. You might not be able to download it until closer to launch or on the stress test next week.
---
Care to extend on that? Naive of me? Naive of Blizzard? Why so? I mean, you say naive but my reasoning is pretty sound (at least to me). What part of it do you not agree with?
---
Why are you asking internet strangers? Contact battle.net support.
---
Pretty sure NEs could still main tank in vanilla? The stat diff from war/human was like, very negligible once you have gear.
---
It took me a min to figure out what "at lunch" referred to, lol.
---
Do furies not take mask of the unforgivem?
---
They won't need to. Nobody is watching BfA streams lol.
---
Considering launch is set for 3pm PDT, no, it's really not a bad time to test NA servers.
---
Inc 1000 year Reddit ban
---
Got it! Thanks op
---
0 reasons??? I mean, have you looked at subscription numbers over the past few years??? Yes, I am obviously projecting, that is true, and I mentioned that in my original post stating how I felt. It doesn't make my statement wrong though... I mean... just look at all the shit that's happened to Blizzard since the Activision takeover... you really can't just wipe all that stuff under the rug.
---
O I c. Mine is stupid. Biit
---
If you are going to duo lvl you might as well pair two of the worst solo leveler so duo warrior this will work ok and it's also cool for dungeons if one dies the other can tank. Shared geared but you can gear one for tanking and the other for dps.
---
You can do any role as any race completely fine in vanilla. Just like you can level fine with any two classes very easily.
---
Shouldnt the paladin be dwarf aswell?
---
Thex is with you.
---
Do you have a sub?
---
Are you subbed?
---
There is no problem to connect US realm with Korean client. So I think, yes. Maybe.
---
Why do you need a Chinese client to play an EU server? Just download the EU client and change the language.
---
Yes, I agree.  I think someone made a mistake with the Mac requirements though. An i7 is absolutely not required, since an i5 can be very powerful also.
---
Fair go :-)
---
I really hope you get get your name ahead of the memers and, er, trolls.
---
I think you heard a bad rumor. Devs have never once said that will be a thing.
---
You do not
---
There's no difference. When you change the language in Battle.NET to Chinese, it downloads the Chinese client and can only be launched to connect to Chinese realms (which requires a connection within China). When you launch the game and connect to an EU realm, you can ONLY change the language to English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese.
---
I just fucking hate this old NA farts holy fuck. They are so entitled and oblivious as fuck.
---
The plan at this time is just vanilla. The devs said bc and wotlk could be a possibility if the community shows enough interest but there is no plan to release them at this time.
---
Been working on this for a bit and ready to begin more public testing. If you're interested, shoot me a message and I'll send you the bot link.
---
I'm also looking for any feedback you all might have. If something isn't clear or you think it's missing feature X, let me know!
---
Me and my 3 of IRL friends all have the UtechSmart Venus MMO mouse and we love it! Super solid gaming mouse. Seems sketchy cause it's some random Chinese company but they're great! None of us have had problems and all got them last Black Friday.
---
I remember pet management not being great in my vanilla experience with a hunter... how’s it with warlock?
---
Yes. I'm not a sociopath.
---
You’ll find you and maybe 2 other people feel that way.
---
Fest Ward is dwarf priest only?
---
But for real, I couldnt play WoW on chicklet keys to save my life...
---
I don't know what you mean, but the foreman of the datamines and his crew are some very reputable fellows, and all the other data in this mine has been proven correct throughout the beta.
---
Blizzard said no. They said classic is classic and retail is retail. No overlap between the 2. Nothing in classic can move to retail and vice versa. Blizzard said that.
---
Yep. Took a few big streamers making the leap to finally get people to switch.
---
Lol it only downloads additional language pack (I play in English at Taiwan server months ago)
---
lol yep. OP.
---
Late response but you pitched in to make his last days some of his best, that's an incredible thing to do. Big kudos to you and the other guildies.
---
It's a sweet weapon, so many arcane crystals though :(
---
For every thousand trying out and quitting, 50+ will stay for a long long time. The classic crackpipe is no joke
---
MS warrior + holy pally is arguably the strongest PvP combo there is.
---
But if you don't care about that and just want to level, than warrior + hunter would better imo.
---
Hunter will do all the work, you're just there as the 2nd pet
---
Just be sure to make a troll shaman named Thex and you will be fine.
---
This is insane man, brings me back to Croatia's run at the world cup earlier. insane stuff from them
---
Yes, because the Taiwanese client supports English. You can try it right now. Make an EU Starter Account, change the language to Chinese, and login. It won't work.
---
TF as a rogue.
---
That sounds incredibly painful
---
daoc was like 20 years ago lol.

Shaman are rather mediocre healers.  Priests will shit on you in every fight you can't make liberal use of chain heal.  Even then, you will just be on par.
---
Paladins basically become on par to priests.
---
You are better than a druid, until they get tier 3, and then u r the worst healer in the game.

Idk what kind of new information this dude is looking for. The games been out 15 years, there’s plenty of guides and discussions that have been talked about as nauseam on the internet.

Yeah priest is strongest for sure - have seen paladin warrior but if you are going for 2 NE only then it has to be priest warrior :) happy flipping papa
---
I am thinking hunter, shaman, and feral druid.  Going horde more than likely.  pve server.
---
Hunter - don't want to do the melee/range weaving bullshit.
---
Shaman - don't want to deal with whiny warriors wanting me to twist totems to elongate their stupid epeen.
---
Feral tank druid - afraid I might be forced to always heal on the worst healer in classic.
---
Probably so Blizzard employees are actually at work. The number of people hammering the stress tests servers will be enough with even a local base, so expanding it globally will even more stress it. It's all about the scale of what they are testing really.
---
Every horde melee dps wants you in their group in a raid.
---
I bought wow tokens today, since I figured they're gonna be more expensive closer to name-reservation and such. 173k~ a piece for 7.
---
I downloaded it a few days ago and I do not have an active sub. I did however use those 3 free days Blizz gave out early last month to get on, sell stuff and buy a bunch of wow tokens so maybe that triggered it.
---
Haha wow that’s super neat good laugh :)
---
As someone who went from DAoC to WoW back in 2004-2005 I think you would. 
---
The combat is much more fluid than DAoC and the world is much more alive. There's no real substitute for RvR but world pvp has a very similar and dangerous feel. 
---
Phase 1 and 2 will be the best for this because the battlegrounds won't be out yet, though there isn't any reward for pvp until phase 2.
---
13 minute video for a simple spreadsheet. Lol no thanks

Are you a Dwarven Overlord by chance? In any case, hail by Dwarven brother!

Assuming it makes all shirts in the game free, I'll go buy all the insanely overpriced shirts in Dalaran!

That being said, I will probably forget about it before it starts anyways, and Classic isn't long after!

We used to tell people to have people try it to level 10 then say nothing... the person trying it will  be like how do I do this level 20 class quest without realizing they are hooked.

Whats the right way?
---
can anyone recommend a good laptop or pc to meet these requirements?
---
ZG and AQ20, people did this all the time when starting new guilds. Chromagg would take a bit of preparation with your tank consumes and buffs, but otherwise BWL wouldnt be too bad with the right consumes and good people.

Huhu would be a pretty hard DPS gear check, but id think its doable. Twin Emps would be very difficult, possibly not doable. I dont think Cthun would be possible at all.
---
Naxx, Raz would still be pretty easy, hard to say about the rest of the dungeon. Anub and Faerlina might be possible
---
We're just trying to get back in the mindset so we can enjoy classic exactly as remembered.
---
i'm hoping for a stress test just so i can set up addons
---
You should play.  It's a unique experience and there's nothing too overwhelming early.  
---
Remember when it came out it was considered one of the most accessible MMO's for a reason.
---
I heal because I have been in too many raids where the MT just dies. No hots, no shields, no 25% armor buff from crit heals, no nature swiftness heal ready, the tank was not given a health stone or it had to be said 10 times to buff the tank. 
---
Healer being on the same page as the tank is 90% of every fight.
---
&gt; So basically you're not only moving the goalpost to fit your narrative to an EXTREME degree 
---
Where did I do that, you moved the goal post with..
---
&gt; Do you think warlocks hardcast into a non-CC'd target? Do you think any of the casters set up burst into non-CC'd targets? 
---
You might find this hard to imagine emotionally, but I genuinely believe based on my experience playing the game and my intuition, that if you have mages chain spells on a target dummy and then have warlocks do the same, the numbers the mage creates will add up to a bigger number than the warlock's. Just breath in and out slowly.
---
Now you tried to circumvent the heart of my point which was sure they MAY deal the highest numbers (I later changed my mind and said maybe mages are highest), but I don't consider them the most reliable in a pvp setting, duels and 1v1's maybe, target dummies okay, WSG and AB, **I'm skeptical.**
---
&gt; you're also sticking by the 3 min meme specs 
---
So you admit they aren't the highest burst, they are the highest burst without cooldowns in your opinion? Now this opens up the discussion, what do you consider a meme, I consider running into 20 yard range more memeish than 2 lightning bolts into chain, then instant lightning bolt, and it takes less time than your combo.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; chime in with rolling ignites. 
---
Not an argument.
---
&gt;  If you're that offended by the fact that warlocks have more reliable  and harder burst than two specialized memespecs that only functions  every 3 minutes, then maybe you should get off reddit my dude. 
---
Emotions emotions emotions, get a male role model dude.
---
yea... don't do that.
---
If course they have plans for the future of Classic. They know if they never expand in some way, the game will become stale. They either haven't made a final decision on the direction they are going or don't want to say anything that would prevent people from playing.
---
Hi kettle, I'm pot.
---
It was way later than TBC, like Cata or Mop. RAF was in since vanilla but it was just a free month bonus, then it went to 300% xp bonus later in TBC I think. It was many xpacks after that the &lt;20 free thing came out though.
---
Do you have friends who played?
---
If you have guy friends 20-35, I think you’d be surprised at the amount who played.
---
Just this past weekend, I was with 4 other guy acquaintances douching it up in las Vegas, someone mentioned it and we came to discover 4/5 of us played. They told me about classic and here I am.
---
Option 3 is for sure the best. Who cares about the slow levelers anyway.
---
Thirthex
---
Actually I love finally witnessing a meme being born.
---
He is 100% wrong. It was always Hunter, pally, warrior, rogue.
---
78% of Americans have little saving and are living paycheck to paycheck.  Some people don't want to spend $15 a month on WoW.  Not everyone is middle class or better off with lots of extra cash.   
---
In soem countries, exchange rates make a WoW sub  the equivalent of paying $30 a month. Again, some people don't want to spend $30 a month on one game.   There are also students on a tight budget and kids too young to work who play WoW.   
---
Everything is not black and white, and everyone doesn't have the same life and disposable cash.  
---
  
---
In some countries it's almost impossible to get a job.  The people who say just get a job or mow some lawns are incrediblely ignorant about the world.

Epic  comment

Thunderfury on my Hunter is my literal dream. That and scarab Lord (though I'll settle for zg raptor)
---
I'm completely new to wow, never played any version before but will be going at classic. I'm set on playing alliance on a pvp server. I'm mainly deciding between warlock and paladin. Warlock seems pretty fun and it's nice cuz you can dps in pve, I have heard paladin you can only heal (idk if healing is boring or not tbh, maybe it's fun but idk). So in terms of pve it seems warlock is the move but paladin seems to be better for pvp because of the undeads ability to negate warlocks spells is what I have read. As of right now I kind of want to focus evenly of pve and pvp and I'm a casual not min maxxing player. Anyone help clear it up for me? Are alliance warlocks really that bad off in pvp? Can I be a human, i dont rly like gnomes.
---
Any idea how long it lasts for on Friday? I'm flying back in from a work trip that afternoon and would love at least 1 hour to play
---
I suppose this kind of thing is clientside data then.
---
you are right.  we should turn of classic servers and force everyone to WOTLK
---
enough with the "i got mine, fuck you" bullshit.
---
No one would be able to find the server.
---
yeah ive always wanted a wow 2 (or world of starcraft? I'd prefer wow 2 but not super picky. Just give me a new MMO in the spirit of classic)

Classic is much easier to get into for someone completely new to WoW because it's the original experience.  It's the way everyone who was new to WoW originally played it.  Because of Cataclysm what you get in Retail WoW kind of expects you to already know something about WoW lore.
---
Have the stages of content listed in this presentation been updated?
---
Notably Dire Maul being 'stage 1' stood out. I've read them being referred to as phases and with some differences.
---
To be fair, what did you roll need on that he needed?
---
Yes, and what I'm saying is that you can test that right now with an EU Starter Account.
---
It's not the best for home use, but nothing beats a Macbook on the road, especially if you're in development.
---
Intimidation tactic to lower new warrior players...
---
This makes sense what you said.   
---
Many people have i5 1.8 GHz and i5 1.6 Ghz and might think they dont meet the minimum requirements, when they absolutely do.   There are a ton of people with MacBooks and MacBook Airs that are 1.8 GHz (which is below the minimum specs) and can run Classic fine.
---
 I am 100% wrong. Sorry to spread the misinformation like that. I'll try and be more vigilant next time &amp; do my own research. I have edited my original comment to reflect this. 
---
Confirmed: Thunderfury is a hunter wep.
---
From raiding it's a hard sell because you're last priority after locks and mages.  
---
From pvp you can get a lot of reputation epics, and the R10 set for blue gear.  
---
Shamans are different because no one really competes on spellcaster mail, so you are only short on rings/trinkets/cloak etc.
---
blizz hates you, and thus you are the perpetual underdog.
---
School is until 12pm / 1pm usually here in Germany. 
---
Later (when you are 17-19) you sometimes have until ~2pm.
---
Destroy how? Would more flasks on ah ruin the game? I disagree.
---
There's an internal cd now apparently.
---
Why though? It does nothing for you
---
Except it doesnt work like that as you need to be in a rested zone yo change layers...
---
No worries and thanks for the kind words!
---
&gt;100% broccoli if we get TBC servers
---
?
---
Yeah under the week maybe 1-2 hours. 
---
Sometimes Family is sleeping early so I can game in peace already around 9pm :D, that gives me ~3 hours then.
---
On Weekends I usually Play the whole nights, so 4-7 hours sessions :D
---
is it a dead horse yet?
---
Good luck with a bunch of ungeared people.
---
Are we back to making shit up now? We're doing this again?
---
I agree it won't be 100%, but your argument was the same as "we can't stop all murders and rapes, so why try?" The point is to aim dead center and get as close as possible, not to add "My little Ponies" because they are in the same league as a 97% accurate remake.

Hey man, different people enjoy different things. I can acknowledge that the things I enjoy and the things you enjoy are not the same.
---
I did not find daily quests "nice". They were unfun and grindy.
---
&gt; You can't claim outland invalidates the core world without acknowledging the good
---
Sure I can. Outland could have been the best content in the world, but if it literally destroys the rest of the game, I (personally) can't justify that. Taking away something 'great' and giving you something 'good' is not a fair trade.
---
&gt; Why you so salty about TBC?
---
Because it took a lot of what I liked about a game that I loved and destroyed it. It then set the developers on a path to completely ruin the game (In my opinion) to the point at which we are today.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szkScab2iOQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szkScab2iOQ) watch the entire thing but go to 31:48 to see the final graph showing off weapon enhancements, I think aside from the fun factor rockbiter might be better than windfury.
---
The first 5 talents in the resto tree aren't **very** important, but I think 5% reduced cost to heals is probably 1.5% reduced mana costs overall, could be even less, it wouldn't be more than probably 2-3% mana spent overall, so not worth it compared to surviving a single encounter once per level from the reduced healing time.
---
I don't like the enhancement talents are as good either, 5% increased mana pool is very very weak and compared to reduced shock/lighting costs which you said you'll use on pulls it is even worse, 5% crit is less than 5% crit because it only applies to parts of your damage, not your spells or totems. 15% fire totem damage adds a few points of dps to searing totem which is more valuable than 5% melee crit and after 2 more points spent on utility it opens you up to the very abusable clearcasting. Without abusing it, it is roughly 5-8% off your spells overall, but you can abuse it to up the number to (guessing here) 20-30%? There are times where you will rank 1 shock or rank 1 bolt for pulls and get a free chain lightning, especially in longer fights or when dealing with multiple mobs.
---
You can justify two-hand mace/axe if you have a great weapon upgrade but you can plan around that, there are good staves, Maraudon has a 2h stave on par with **Kang** in the same level bracket.
---

---
5,760 mana and 3600 hp if you don't cap resources, this is more valuable than some cooldowns being used constantly. Better than blood fury I bet.
---
lvl 40 healing stream is 25 per 5, this is equal to 1/5 of your totem running constantly healing you to put it into perspective.
---
It was quite smooth. Maxed graphics, didn’t have any problem sitting at 144fps. Then again, I use a desktop. BFA has a lot more animations going on though. There’s a ton of abilities with particle effects and all that extra jazz you won’t see in vanilla, so I wouldn’t use it as a benchmark for how classic will run. Stress test is the 8th though, you can sub and see how she plays yourself
---
Only because of cleave in MC.
---
The i5-3427U boosts up to 2.8 Ghz on a single core and 2.7 Ghz on both cores. Your fans will go crazy and your battery life will be next to nothing, but you should be able to manage.

What do you need to do to get into the stress test?
---
Just an active subscription
---
Actually, being part of aforementioned group is the literal definition of "we" so yes, I have a part in defining "we".
---
Got that covered already. I freaking hate the current content. Can’t get motivated to do more than one or two quests a night. I’ll check out the stress test.

Lad, I've played Crysis and ArmA II on a $500 laptop made in 2012. I'm pretty sure you could run WoWC on a reasonably powerful wristwatch nowadays.
---
Correct; the biscuit requires level 45 but replenishes 2148hp and 4410 Mana (lvl 55 conjured gives 4200) , so is essentially level 55 water.
---
At revered, however, the argent Dawn quartermaster sells "Blessed Sunfruit Juice", another level 55 refreshment however it only restores Mana (again , 4410, so more than mage 55 water) *as well* as giving a +10 spirit buff .
---
They just released minimum specs a few hours ago. It is much less demanding than BFA but is going to be slightly more so than a 1.12 client.
---
Yeah. Arena was the only thing that kept me playing. Haven’t been subbed in months though. Opening night on the stress test will be chaos, but you shouldn’t have an issue logging in a few hours later or the following day
---
Etsy?
---
Probably will be able to get away with it then
---
So we just need friendly then :D couldnt see biscuit regen on the vanilla sites i checked

oh look another herp derp chain heal noob.
---
Yeah for sure.
---
Thank you! I may give it a shot and be a cheap skate. 
---
I’m tempted to pull the trigger on a new/used windows pc for classic but I feel like a grandparent when it comes to the gpu/cpu/core(dual vs quad)/video card/processor is like another language to me.
---
right?! or if they had normal sized totems and you could run around and be the same size as them... that would be amazing
---
Thanks.  You have great knowledge about the different Macs and hardware inside.   
---
Did not know that about the MacBook Pros.
---
Cool, will do, thanks :)
---
You can't heal dungeons shadow spec.  You will go out of mana quick.
---
Looks awesome, did you make it yourself?
---
What the Kentucky fried fuck is wrong with you?
---
I do what I can brother! I try to make up a little for all the negative connotations the class gets in Classic! Haha.
---
Both are great to have around. I hope you can find the beauty in both.
---
Correct yep, shouldn't be too bad (and thx for pointing it out, I corrected my original comment!) 
---
Very cool that it gives more than mage water. The only thing is, the stacks of biscuits and the juice are 54s per 5! 
---
Assuming you buy a full 40x or even 60x , that's 20-30g  (21.6g for 40x )
---
I think a lot of people have this romantic idea that the community will be as chill as it was back then. The reality is that even mediocre guilds from today will be better at the game than the most tryhard guilds back then. The people who will play as bad as they did back then will be a very small minority. This in turn makes a lot of the "fun" in Classic unviable unfortunately. By that I mean the countless stories of people who did something that went against common knowledge and worked because people's standards were so low back then.
---
If you can run BFA and it's passable, you will be fine. It might start becoming unplayable in any sort of Raid situation, and you might get some hiccups during peak hours in Org/IF, but yea, you can get away with it.
---
i love lamp

Thank you! I don’t completely understand that but I am sure you are right.

I used to build bootloaders for hackintoshs where you had to spoof the hardware IDs of various real Apple devices to get OSX/MacOS to install. As much as that knowledge is now (mostly) useless, it stuck with me.
---
No, you won’t fall behind at all. People will always be competitively raiding, in retail it’s more so who gets world first. World first will be significant for any of the raids but the real competition is going to be when real optimizations and new strategies start popping up, the competitive side is essentially who can complete it faster than other said group. Though the raids in classic are much easier and more approachable to the casual player which means more competition.
---
Ah, well that explains it. My first job out of undergrad was a .net project and I still went through the hassle of using a Mac by running a Windows VM (this was long before Visual Studio had any real support on MacOS). 
---
Back then it was because Apple hardware was far superior to anything a PC manufacturer was producing. Now that gap has all but disappeared, but everything deploys to unix now, so working in a unix environment is much easier. Though I've heard some good things about how far the Windows+Ubuntu stuff has come along.
---
I used to play and I’ve no idea what that means. Would you be willing to rephrase?
---
You consider 3-4 hours LONG ? Damn, I sure as hell enjoy not running through an instance in 20 minutes. I fucking loved it when we were trying to beat Hyjal and we were there easily for 5-6 hours a day and we were dying, a lot.

I know it's a meme but I hate the Naga Hex. I currently have it. I don't know why they stopped making the razer naga with the buttons to the left of the LMB and instead put them below the mouse wheel. Shitty location for buttons for anyone who doesn't claw the mouse. The hex button layout is extremely difficult to get used to and very counter-intuitive.
---
I'd wager you can clear MC and BWL entirely and get up to Cthun in AQ40, whether you can actually DO Cthun in full prebis I'd say it's theoretically possible, but at this point it's becoming excessively hard to hit the DPS thresholds for the mechanics.
---
Then in Naxx I'd say your hard limit will be Loatheb (lack of DPS), 4hm (lack of healer and tank gear). I'd be willing to bet money that those two are impossible without at least some raid gear. This also locks off frost wing obviously. Thaddius should be doable, but very consumable heavy. Maexxna is definitely doable as you can hit crit immunity on a tank with prebis alone. Every boss before the bosses I mentioned should be doable without too many problems, assuming the whole raid plays well and has good consumable usage. The only other challenge could be Patchwerk, but luckily he's very cheesable by just stacking a billion healers and in fact, you could kite him to death if you really wanted to with a couple of mages.
---
WHATS UP WITH YOU DOG
---
You will have so much fun. I can't stress this enough. IF you aren't having fun by level 30 then you might need to consider rolling another class. I started this game at release not knowing anything about it and chose warrior. I didn't spec right for leveling and hated playing to the point of quitting after level 40 or so. My good friend convinced me to give it another shot with a different class completely opposite of Warrior; Hunter. Well I ended up leveling that hunter up to 60 in about 2 weeks and went on to be the main hunter for a guild that ran and cleared MC, BWL, ZG, and got through to Twin Emps and the four horsemen in Naxx. I loved the game so much back then. I tried to love it as the expansions and changes came but it just was not the same. I played my Warrior later through TBC and up into Cataclysm when I ended my subscription. Leveling up you will learn to play your class. Learning to master that class comes with time. You will find friends in the people that will become your guild as you will easily be a group of 40+ that are all striving for the same goals. Good luck out there.

Ok, so not really "international law" as the troll here said. Also it won't really affect you being able(or not) connect to private servers.

 I don't know that we have any plans right now. We're focused entirely on  WoW Classic and making sure it is going to be as correct and authentic  as possible, and we're really excited to see what fans say when they're  experiencing it. We started this whole project as a love-letter to the  fans - they've been demanding this from us. We wanted to respond and  give them what they've been asking us for. We will continue to listen to  community feedback, and we want to know what people think and want to  see next.  
---
It seems to me that you are the one reading too much into it.

Also it that very thread people once again (as always) started arguing about their "game+" ideas.... if that isn't enough evidence against changes i dont know what is... the same thing in every single thread that suggests them.

If it's a success, and people want TBC or WotLK, give it to them. But for god sake.... stop with the "tweaks" im yet to see a SINGLE thread in 2 years where people actually agree on a change....

A lot of us are from private servers, where we know what we’re getting in to and have done it many times.

10 shards minimum doing what? Again, DM E solo lashers won't be possible - grouping up is though. And you will not get 10 shards an hour soloing DM E anyway. The average is more like 1-2 and the bulk of the profit comes from vendorable grays.

---
Have you tried playing the 1.12 on a pserver?
---
If you can handle that I'd bet you could handle Classic. Unless there are Mac specific issues...but you can bootcamp windows or linux right? My chromebook has ubuntu and uses wine to run 1.12 on all low settings and can also play the classic client identically. And I am well below the minimum specs.
---
I have usually worked better with shaman than I have paladins as a warr, both skill levels being extremely high. 
---
Having earth shock, grounding totem, purge spam, and WF is so good.
---
Something tells me if you're reacting that way you must hear it a lot.
---
Have a link by chance?
---
Ah well, it was changed in 1.12. So for classic it will target raid members, but it didn't do that for the majority of vanilla.
---
Thats the reason downranking is powerful in classic, lower rank spells get just as much benefit from spell power if they have the same cast time, hots and dots also tend to get 100% of the spell power bonus over their duration. Renew probably ticks 9 times so 11% increase per tick.

So those leaked minimum specs were correct. Neat.
---
Even average raids will usually bring 3 tanks and ~12 melee dps. Out of the 3 tanks 2-3 will be warriors and out of the melee dps 5-6 will be warriors.
---
&gt; Risking serious health consequences though.
---
Never stopped anyone doing anything.
---
I will 100% take Ursain Bolt's advice in this scenario. And any other scenario involving running fast.
---
Thanks for your responses. It sounds like it’s a non-issue if I can just spec true shadow and still manage to heal 5mans effectively, I’d much prefer to do that than go down a hybrid route anyway
---
Why is everyone portraying Thex as a male troll? She's obviously female.
---
I like Yonkers
---
I can't find the post, but people said they tested everything with or without people, entering the instance in multiple ways, inviting people before or after etc. and none worked. But the dying method works, which I just learned from u/[Zaro-Likse](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zaro-Likse/) \- so I was wrong.
---
We will see what the prices are. But remember that if it's the LBS you're looking for, lashers are not a good way to get them. I was getting 12-20g/h on a saturated market, as an enchanter, doing all packs, dungeon locked. So I'm pretty sure we will see a lot of "Where's my 40g/h" posts later as people realize just how slow a method this is compared to hunters and mages.
---
As much shit as Blizzard gets these tests are pretty smart and not alot of companies are willing to go above and beyond to prepare for launching a popular game. Both Legion and BFA launches were smooth and I saw no issues. WoD on the other hand...
---
If you're turning to wow for a similar experience to Daoc RvR you're going to be sorely disappointed, they are nothing alike.
---
Daoc is the best RvR/PvP focused MMO ever made (honorable mention to GW) with a side of PvE.
---
Wow is the best PvE focused MMO ever made, with a side of PvP.
---
Daoc character improvement is focused around killing other people.  You can see the fruits of your endeavors immediately as you watch your RP count increase for killing people.  Your progress via rps/ras never goes away.
---
In Wow character progression is through gear, and your progress is diminished if you ever stop doing PvE as the gear progressively gets better and better as new PvE dungeons/raids are released.
---
In Daoc you go out in the frontier to _hunt_ other people, that is the endgame.  That is your focus 90% of the time you login.
---
In Wow, you often ignore people of the opposing faction when you encounter them naturally in the world because killing them is a waste of time.  90% of the time you login is to do PvE.
---
The only real satisfying organic wow PvP is when groups collide around PvE objectives (world bosses or on the way to BRM, etc).
---
----------
---
Outside of that, people who "PvP" in wow do it mostly in battlegrounds, which are similar to the lowbie battlegrounds in Daoc, but they are focused around objectives, and not specifically on winning your fights like Daoc is.
---
The Honor system in Wow is vastly different than the RP system in Daoc.  
---
You spend your life spamming the same 3 objective focused battlegrounds, and as you rank up it allows you to buy gear.  Gear which is (roughly) on par with people who do PvE content.
---
This means you can spend your entire wow life PvPing only for your character to be equal to someone who spends their entire time PvEing.
---
That's like grinding out rank 10 in Daoc by killing 20k people, only to find out that your character is 'equal' to someone who killed the Dragon 100 times.
---
So ya if you actually know and understand Daoc, then Wow will be totally different for you....but
---
You said you only played 6 months of gaming in the last 15 years?  That's nothing.
---
If all you did in Daoc was template a character and go zerg around for a few realm levels then you probably won't care what Wow PvP is like and that it's opposite of Daoc in almost every way.
---
Both games are fun, but the experience is not even remotely similar.
---
For me, i find the paladin playstile very boring, i wouldn't recommend it as first champ.
---
WL on the other hand is easy to lvl, good at pvp and pve.
---
Ideal setups with 5 competent players can grind out XP/hr almost as fast as ideal speedrun questing XP/hr. 
---
From what I’ve seen though this requires fairly specific 5-man combos. You’ll also rely on your team being as committed as you in terms of efficiency, pace and time online.
---
I haven't played WoW in nine years, and I was able to download the Classic client.
---
You won’t be able to kill people but you won’t die either

My uncle was a R13 alliance warrior on sargeras, was about 1-2 weeks from R14 when we went on our annual camping trip. He refused to skip it and refused to let anyone play his account so he never made it to 14. I remember watching him destroy people for hours as a kid, and he is the reason I'm rolling warrior this time around. Hes returning to classic as well but has zero desire to pvp and intends to play all the pve content he never did.
---
Umm, ok. Pserver knowledge again? 3 minutes Vael was pretty normal in Vanilla. In 3 minutes you get 8 burning adrenalines on mana users, which means around 3-4 healers get hit by then.
---
I'd guess, if you heavily stack rogues and warriors and only bring a handful healers, your assumption is correct. But for the average raid with 8-10 healers and ~25 mana users in the raid, as was normal in vanilla, it's not.
---
Competitive does not mean you no-life week 1. you could start a month later than launch and still be competitive.
---
He plays a paladin. No Changes.
---
I subbed in the desperate hope that I could get into the beta. Now have a sub to a game I cannot stand. But lesson Learned. At least 6 months sub you get a discount.
---
My shit ass phone can run it.
---
Well theres not much to discuss atm so people will just latch on to whatever they can. J wouldn't worry. In a couple of weeks this sub will be entirely different.
---
Is the Horde one WOW Lamp 1 or 2? Not pretty clear for me on the shop page.
---
Is the Horde version lamp 1 or 2?
---
2gb of Ram? Idk seems too much for me.
---
My vanilla guild had an opposite faction rival guild. We held a dueling tournament in the Dire Maul colliseum before the patch that actually added the Dire Maul dungeon. After a bunch of 1v1s we all got naked and had a massive fist fight to end it. 
---
I would love to have such a guild rivalry again.
---
Yeah, no one needs to raid real quick.
---
I suggest  you to watch Oyoyo Vidéo, a very well geared and skilled Resto druid in Pvp. He is not very well known but he derserve some attention !
---
What? Source please
---
&gt; Reckoning bombs are basically on par with shaman triple windfury procs. (Random, and rare)
---
Err what? Reckoning is not random. you get a stack for each crit you take and unleash all stacks on an attack. Against a fast attacking rogue, you are nearly guaranteed to have a full reck bomb up when you get out of the stunlock. Against other classes it's harder, up to nearly impossible to get a full bomb in a normal fight, but in alterac and world pvp you can use npcs and duels to collect a reckbomb beforehand.
---
A shaman triple windfury proc is basically a 20% followed by a 36% chance followed by a 36% chance, so a 2.6% chance total. And it's also not possible as this was patched out in 1.4
---
Ah. That makes sense. I was the panda mage or something. There’s a spell that would blow everyone into an abyss I’d you used it on the right PvP battleground. Fun, fun. Are the bots still running rampant?
---
Just a quick one to say thanks for the laughs. I saw the original post and comment and then have been amused to just watch how the entire subreddit has just run with it to the point where you just browse the comments for every post expecting a Thex-related comment.
---
On another note I also think you may have done me a massive favour as I expect everyone will be so busy trying to get all their Thex-related names such as Thexx, Thexy, IAmThex, TheRealThex, Thexed, YouGotThexed, NotThex, FedThex, etc that there should be less immediate competition for the name I want myself on name reservation day (which is Thex, obviously).
---
I want to be Thex Warrior, The reaper of gods.
---
Indeed. Setting up server communities, rivalries (and to know what streamer server to avoid) isnt a priority ? Jeesus fucking christ, 95% of this game IS about the community after a while.
---
If thats not a priority, i dont know what is.
---
I mained a holy priest from wotlk to legion. Was rogue in vanilla. Healing is crazy fun.
---
Seriously. Even if you were into the meme this post doesn't even have humor. It's just a picture of STV.
---
Nah you won't fall behind. Once you hit 60 maybe all that sweet mc lot will just go to you
---
Yeah they are really scraping the bottom of the barrel here.
---
I'm guessing that was the Orb of Deception.

Aeitiesh on my feral Druid
---
I said an average of 10 hours. Obviously you get to play more on the weekend.
---
It accounts for about 7-8 hours of sleep per day unless your commute is super long or something.
---
I use a g600 since years and i can not play a game without it. But stupid logitech removed it from the swiss shop. Even the suport will not make it happen to get me a new one from the US shop since they do not ship to Switzerland.
---
Stupid decision from logitec to stop selling them in Switzerland/EU.
---
I looked it up in a dictionary since english isn't my first language.  
---
you misused the word 'original'.
---
I could imagine the client might need the values to display tooltips correctly? Or did the tooltips show base values in the beta?
---
uhhh no?
---
Also, even if you are behind a few weeks hitting 60, some of those hardcore guilds might be looking for additional fillers. People flake, or can’t maintain the raid schedule
---
My Fuhrer...
---
The Shamans...
---
The Shamans in our raid are not Restoration.  Two are Enhancement, Five are Elemental and one is a druid feral cat that I mistook for a ghost wolf.
---
ya computers are only for games
---
Define "holding their own", I define it as doing enough dps to comfortably beat every boss in the game. Which they do.
---
And when specced "correctly", they don't bring all of the buffs. A holy paladin doesn't bring judgements unless they go for the hassle of jduging every 30 sec. Plus you usually don't use 4 or 5 holy palas, so a ret will bring an additional useful blessing. Can also use nightfall.
---
A resto druid doesn't have the crit auras a moonkin or feral brings.
---
A shaman is the only class, who doesn't bring a lot except nightfall.
---
Nobody will carry moonkins and ret palas thorugh raids, you could clear raids with nothing but ret palas and moonkins. And if moonkins and ret paladins get carried, the hunters also get carried. So will people switch to guilds, who don't use hunters then?
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
Wait people are still excited for this even with layering? 
---
no thanks
---
Thex seems to be the agent Smith of WOW. Where ever he goes he transforms other characters into a copy of himself. Agent Thex!
---
Norway and Denmark up there too
---
You worked 3 shifts in order to not have one ? Did you have math at college ?
---
It's crazy how wrong these posts are. How do I do that bot reminder so I can laugh my head off at you in 4 weeks?
---
Hunters don't scale well with gear and can kill certain classes without being geared, specifically melees. Overall, they do require some loot to be effective, though.
---
Mages do scale pretty well with gear, but they can do just fine without it, mostly because of inbuilt survivability and utility. Sheep is always going to be a very effective CC tool, as is Frost Nova. Shatter means you have 50% crit on frozen targets regardless of gear. Imp. Counterspell will always silence and thus has the option to turn the tides of the battle. Ice Barrier simulates the Stamina you're still lacking because of poor gear. And once you DO acquire some gear, those shattercombos become even deadlier than before, and specs like Elemental become viable. It's a very smooth progression in my opinion.
---
And we demand RP-PvP!
---
When you create lamp but accidentally put wrong logo on it.
---
Seriously good job, looking good !
---
To be fair, nat pagle‘s would be replacing gear but even that one is not needed.
---
Exactly. Twitch is a sexist/cancer platform anyways.
---
Norway and Denmark are Sweden, they just don't know it. Norway is our happy little brother that doesn't know better and just smiles. Denmark is the black sheep of the family with a speech impediment.
---
Germany got 3x US and they didn't want to give us our own servers...
---
Patchwerk and Sapphiron would be stretching it tbh.
---
So i got 19941901, so if i take the 94 separately it would be Sidsa, i think i can work with it.
---
I would just go with the addon allianceroute. All info in-game while you play step by step.
---
Well, im dual-boxing a warrior shaman. Mainly because i love the warrior class, but hate dying to two mobs  :P 
---
Also - That sweet WF + sweeping strikes comb...
---
ELI5: Why are people so hyped about playing with Asmon/Streamers
---
Just rebind your A and D keys to strafe instead of turn and use your mouse to turn.
---
Probably a good idea to delete your S key as well as back peddling is bad lol.
---
Otherwise just start it up and learn as everyone else did. At some point you may want to look into modding your UI. But you can look into that when you're stuck at lvl 30+ and need a short break.
---
I'd try a DPS class first as you won't get crucified like a bad tank or healer might.
---
&gt;I played better surprisingly 
---
Naw bruh.
---
Im jealous of that and I might do that later on- plan on dualboxing mage/lock to 60 since I've never done that for vanilla :)
---
He’s talking about fury as a dps build tanking. Are you all playing dumb? He wasn’t talking about a dedicated fury tanking build. The first guy in the thread was saying to just tank as whatever spec so you don’t have to worry about a tank
---
Tbh I think you'd be more lost starting in retail wow than Classic. 
---
In retail the storylines make no sense jumping between expansions if you don't already know the lore so leveling is wonky and if you boost you'll have no idea what you're supposed to do at end game. 
---
Classic is one cohesive world. Sure you wont have the advantage that people who played back in the day have but they were in your shoes once too learning the ropes. Classic will be grindy, frustrating, and tedious at times but much much more rewarding in a traditional sense than retail wow. I dont expect the learning curve to be as steep as stepping into retail wow for someone who has 0 knowledge of the game and 0 friends who play.
---
You'll have an easier time making friends too. Need to clear a cave but the mobs are too tightly packed? Group up with the other guy on his way over. Boom made a friend.
---
Malkovich Malkovich
---
Some of them will definetly be available, but I wouldn't recommend it because of this: "Hi, can you invite my friend Børre to the raid?" "No, I don't know how to write that"
---
Please explain to me where i can get the best gear instantly at level 120 in bfa
---
Prot pally doesn’t work because they can’t taunt it has little to do with items.
---
It's at 20:00 here in Sweden so I guess it should be the same for you?
---
World PvP will never really die. People still need to run to instances / raids, farm mobs, veins, herbs and people level alts.
---
The beauty of vanilla is that you cant sit in a city and get spoon fed.
---
Main something different this go around. Rogue is a good change up, experiment with builds.   I used to be die hard daggers until I twinked a combat mace spec. Get a sick dagger at 60, try hemo, go for a rogue killer build. Go for a dagger one shot clothies build. Rogue is so much fun ove almost convinced myself - but I've mained 2 rogues and am going spriest lol
---
More like next thex test
---
Thenx
---
You sound like a 30 year old lesbian gnome. Please stop making videos.
---
I’ve been away for a couple expansions, but usually I went to the vendors in Org.
---
If you are referring to keeping them happy and shit? No there is none of that.
---
You subjugate demons and make them submit to your will. There is no pet 'management' in that way.
---
If you're talking about how they perform in combat they are all a little different.
---
Two of them are 'ranged' so to speak, while the other two are more up close and personal. You'll spend a lot of time using the Blueberry Voidwalker who tanks for you while you burn enemies down.
---
I like it better than the hunter pets IMO, no upkeep, jsut need soul shards which you will have a ton of. Variety of pets and you can pop a different one out for a different encounter. Need the ranged dps? Pop out your Imp/Succubus. Need a tank? Blueberry. Anti-caster? Grab the felhound.
---
The Infernals and Demon Lord's are a lot of fun too but you wont be using them as regularly due to them being high level summons and also requiring a bigger investment than just a shard to summon.
---
I would second that War+Druid is probably the best choice as alliance. Druid alone is a really really strong leveler and it becomes even stronger with someone to "tank" mobs, allowing for easy shredding. The classes also have synergies through Battle Shout, Fearie Fire(as mentioned) and Leader of the Pack. And since you're already duoing healing will be minimized as well, which means the druid runs even less risk of OOMing due to shapeshift costs.
---
Also, in this case it would allow both players to start as NE.
---
No, because of abilities like bloodthirst being buffed already and items like Deathbringer being in the ultimate form.   
---
It's like 46DPS in its old form and 56DPS in later one. 
---
Savage gladiator chain is +13stam/agi/str +2% crit in its patched 1.10 form.
---
In the beginning it gave +13stam and +20defense.
---
You can see how a lot of abilities and items are directly catered towards fury warrior DPS in the later patches while they truly sucked in the beginning. 
---
Fury DPS will be strong and top DPS the second they step into MC with their preBiS. They are squishy as hell with 3.2k HP and 50% leather+mail gear, but the damage they deal will be there.
---

You are just here to shit up the subreddit aren't you? What an absolute piece of shit you must be, go enjoy your elemental shaman called thex for the month your ADD will allow you to play the game and then leave us the fuck alone. 
---
Fucking wanker.
---
I just want to chime in that this was hotfixed in vanilla because I (ab)used this to farm some pretty sweet stuff and become mega rich.
---
Once you start playing WoW, you wont need to worry about friends, or RL
---
Shaman resto again or Tank warrior, still don't know what to choose, REEEEEEEEEEE.
---
Both are great choices ! Warlock might have an easier time finding PuG raids since they are often less played than hunters and there are more raid spots for them
---
All they have to do is make it so when you go in a group with a friend, you switch layers. 
---
But try to do it a second time and you won't be able to switch layers until you're near them. 
---
Or just make it so that it doesn't switch layers until you're near them in the first place.
---
naw
---
Suggestion: Maybe add a picture of IF where to train the professions?
---
Question: You go into Darkshore at level 11 untill 15... That means no spell upgrades from 10-16?
---
Question: You suggest going into The Shimmering Flats at level 31. This will just turn into a gankfest on a new server, no?

PvP on specific worlds with both sides fighting for rare resources.

PvE early game fighting breakaway factions, late game the remnant of the hybrids. Then into new threats.
---
Meleeweawing is really really hard to do perfectly. You pretty much need to have the Xbow from Nefarian since it is really easy to fuck up with a faster wep. It's far from a cheap exploit considering how much micromanaging it requires compared to other classes rotation.
---
Thanks heredawg. I really appreciated this post too
---
you know the rest of the world exists...?

It do, ax anyone
---
http://www.wowclassicbis.com/
---
I have two questions, not sure if this thread is right for all of them:
---
1. I want to main rogue. I know many people are leveling their mage first in order to grind some gold and gear up their warriors or whatever later, but in phase 1 there's no DM, for example, and farming potential of mages could be somewhat diminished. Now, I've never played vanilla other than leveling and know nothing about goldfarming besides some youtube videos/forum guides I've seen: whom should I level first? Or maybe rogue itself is enough to farm for my basics? Pickpocketing/mining/herbgathering in dungeons (ZG is phase 4 tho), organized devilsaur skinning, other kinds of resource gathering and grinding. 
---
I'm not entirely sure on the best phase 1 goldfarming strategies and I want to stockpile gold for future consumables-heavy activities.  
---
I have a ton of free time to spend, especially during early stages of classic. And I mean like whole months of gaming with breaks for food and sleep. 
---
2. Can you give me a rough estimate of dps percentage that is lost by choosing undead over orc? 
---
With all the proper gear, WF totem, cooldown/proc usage and on fights where dps matters. 
---
BF is like 80 AP I heard. Not much, but such cooldowns tend to combine rather well. 
---
WotF is kinda imba tho and not random like stun resist (and FAPs exist), and those front flips of undead females....
---
This is great!
---
I once bought a so-called "2D lamp" from Ebay. Sure enough, when I opened the box, it was actually a 3D lamp.
---
Consumed an entire bottle of the Red Pill.
---
I enjoyed heroics, otherwise I agree with everything on your list. Also, I hated that many, perhaps most, comps needed resilience to compete in arenas, and that you had to farm BGs to get resilience, which resulted in over half the population of any BG being afk farming for arena gear.
---
Mah dude! That really is the dream!

Hi, /u/XenGlaris

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cl0wjr/wait_a_minute_is_this_isekai/). 
---
Uh, soldiers in the front? Are we talking about Denmark? Because Sweden definitely didn't have any soldiers in any front conflict. Only UN peacekeeping missions afaik.
---
as a side note , this can also be performed without the macro by turning about 90° away from the target.Special attacks like cheap shot / garrote will still hit but auto attacks wont.
---
The "[harm]" is a boolean or condition, if the target you have is an enemy it will cast the spell after the condition. If not it won't even try to cast the spell. Without the condition you would get error messages if pressing the macro with a friendly marked. For the same reason you don't want to cast most spells on dead targets.
---
You can also use the conditions to have multiple spells in a macro!
---
/cast [harm,nodead] Smite 
---
/cast [help,nodead] Renew 
---
/cast [help] Ressurection
---
/cast Shadowform
---
The macro above will do the first thing on the list that is true.

I hope my Surface pro 6 can run it :( it runs RuneScape 3 fine... Guess we'll see

I made a FF-style sprite of a Judgement Paladin using Perlers!! So cool!

How long will the stress test last?
---
Thats not the point. the point is to have a fair raiding experience for everyone involved. Bringing really crappy specs is not a fair experience.
---
How is it fair to Mage A that he has to spec arcane frost for raids, when he wants to be full frost so he can pvp and aoe farm. But we bring a boomkin that does crappy dps just so he can be a special snowflake. Whats fair about that?
---
G15 Logitech Keyboard I still have since WoW launch (shit sturdy AF), 10€ mouse and loads of Doritos Thex Mex

Finland is a bunch of though motherfuckers, noone messes with them.

Norway got the most fantastic natur in the world (probably) and The people is super Nice.

We should honestly just be one country, we speak the basically the same language anyways(except Finland, but they can usually speak swedish)
---
Plus side: Get to play Classic WoW
---
Down side: May die alone...
---
But hey, swings and roundabouts I guess.
---
But people who were in beta can still see the game in their launcher, whereas people who were not (mostly) can’t.
---
Crafting is definitely worth whle in classic, but it will take a lot of extra time if you are going to keep it up to speed with your level, so most people do it after they reach max level.
---
But You can craft lots of item upgrades for yourself while leveling since you don't get a lot of good items from quests or drops usually.
---
At 60 you can also craft several expensive or pre-raid bis items depending on your profession.
---
The 2nd ultimate sacrifice. Devorce wife to not bother you when you play.
---
Because its advertisement is the audience that already knows about who spread it to each other.
---
Its not some new game they are trying to get people who have never played an MMO before to play.
---
Blizzard maybe wanted to be a bit more sure they were going to make the release date before putting out a bunch of advertising.
---
This is beautiful

Where did you get location-specific WoW Classic data? I smell bullshit.

Seems I'm in a minority. I live near belfast yet I'm an alliance player.

You don't need friends just ask in general chat or /who and whisper. It's really not that hard

So their is a vendor in org where i can just buy mythic level gear?

The South Park episode is what got me to play.

I’m having lunch in a few hours.

&gt; Its not some new game they are trying to get people who have never played an MMO before to play.
---
Why wouldn’t it be? Is it bad thing to get more players?
---
That's German for "the Insect" /Sideshow Bob
---
A WoW Classic advert would need to attract 5 new players for every single player a BFA advert attracts to be worth it. There's just no point for Blizzard to spend that kind of money.
---
This is great.
---
You do understand that the MMO market is niche now, right?
---
Teenagers nowadays arent a target audience.
---
Anyone who is gonna play Classic has either played WoW or played it back then.
---
It'll be 6pm my time when it drops, I am excited.
---
Not to rub it in your face or anything :)
---
Amazing, this is EXACTLY what I was hoping to hear. Thank you very much!
---
Undead good
---
it dose not need advertisement, literally everyone that is wanting to play it already knows that it's coming, and when, the rest will hear about it via retail and twitch, and word of mouth...they do not need to spend anything on advertising.
---
I hate to disagree so I agree
---
Damn stress tests always scheduled right in the middle of lunch...
---
You think you're being smart but you're really not - no shareholders are ever going to get into the nitty-gritty of caring about in-game policies or bans. Furthermore, an example of Blizz putting resources into losing money was when someone was (presumably) paid to remove the RMAH (which they got a cut from) in Diablo 3.
---
Most likely. If not there’s probably a portal to it somewhere. I’d check google.
---
No, lunch is usually at 12pm PDT for Blizz
---
The first time i played wow was when my college roommate was going home for the weekend and said i could try the game out on his account. I rolled an undead rogue. I played for 13 straight hours, took a nap and played 16 more hours. (i don't even like rogues but he said it would be easy) i had no clue what i was doing but i had the time of my life. I got to like level 22 before he came back. 
---
A few months later TBC came out and he bought me a pc and sub to wow.
---
Wait rly? I can still see Classic and even do the updates. And i only got on the stress tests.
---
you are right, but not helping
---
Yep. Add 5% to that total 14k for tauren.
---
&gt; edit: also it should be one name per account
---
It's three names per account.
---
Again those specs are not "really crappy", they are all good enough to beat the content.
---
It's still absolutely fair, because I'm pretty sure the moonkin pvp spec is different to the moonkin pve spec. So the moonkin also brings the spec they "don't want" to the raid. No argument there at all. It's absolutely bonkers of you to compare a pure dps class pve and pvp spec to a hybrid class completely switching roles and saying it's unfair. An apt comaprison would be a pve ret paladin and a reckoning specced paladin. That's something akin to oyur arcane frost vs deep frost comparison. Moonkin vs resto isn't even in the same ballpark, as it's a completely different role. And again with your special snowflake? So all hunter players are special snowflakes, because they do "crappy dps" and want to get carried by the real specs? Nobody is a special snowflake, when they bring the required to beat the content, which all dps specs in the game do.
---
Also, let me introduce to the revolutionary idea of letting the mage raid as a deep frost. Isn't that something? He doesn't have to spec arcane frost for raids. Yes, it's better, but for one you want one deep frost specced mage anyway for winters chill and the dps loss from not going arcane frost won't effect the overall raid performance noticeably.
---
I’m not saying that they need to. But why pass on opportunity?
---
Let's start simple - Do you understand for example why people get autographs or want to hang out with famous movie stars or other celebrities?
---
Haha, I had a gankers.txt

And by the time the other two run out taunt is back off cool down.

Because the profit margins aren't nearly as large as Retail adverts.

It also seems to apply to stress test. I haven’t been in either (and am not subbed) and don’t see it.

No. No need to white knight her.

Probably the alcohol making me think I was ;)

They can also look at site traffic. Even if you don't sub if x million clicked on the link it's a pretty good indicator of what's to come.

And a large portion of the year is cold, dark, or wet. It's simply not pleasant to be outside that much.
---
for you maybe but for a new account or not a beta attendant it wasn't
---
Paladins are going to be subpar as dps and tanks, but bring valuable buffs. They can still do any role in dungeons, but expect to be a healer for raids. Paladins will also level significantly slower than a warlock. I wouldn’t avoid being a warlock just because of the undead on the other side. Also it’s very important that you make a character that you can enjoy seeing for a long time. Don’t pick gnome for a slight stat edge if you don’t like how they look.
---
A fun fact: When me and a couple of friends went to Copenhagen for a concert, we asked for directions. People didn't understand us (we spoke Swedish).
---
Until my brother spoke Swedish but tried to sound like a Dane. Then we got directions ^^, They're kind of weird :D
---
Interesting. Doesn't really surprise me.
---
That makes sense. That sounds like a good work around. What about ways to adjust GP on a per-item basis?
---
If you think there's enough people that don't want consistent raid times, create a guild and recruit, but most people don't want this.
---
You must be fun in groups

Wow, those Mac requirements seem quite steep.    
---
But for Windows you could build something around a Ryzen 5 1600 and use the APU and it ought to be fine for 1080p I'd reckon provided you didn't skimp on the RAM.
---
Not to worried I hope the best for her as well.
---
Flask is 150 spell damage, not healing.
---
If you plan on doing raid releases and continously clearing top content all the way through naxx, then yeah it's going to have a strict schedule for 99.999999% guilds.
---
But that's only a part of all raiding. Most guilds will be clearing content for alts or benchwarmers on off days. If you're still desperate there's always pugs. 
---
There will be a place for you to raid somewhere bud
---
Dont'cha kno!

It's funny how Minnesotan accent still has it similarities to the english spoken by naitive Swedes and Norwegians.

Classic will get extra attention on every phase release but not sure how long that will last.

This shit is gonna get nerfed as soon as anyone abuses it

Indeed you shall!
---
US only, wow thanks much blizzard... So glad this """preorder""" worked out for the scalpers on ebay
---
Just downloaded it (EU). I dont have an active sub for a few months.
---
That’s not how it started. Someone posted asking people about what names they were going to use and posted his own (Thex) and then everyone started trolling him
---
The official wow Instagram posted a story that classic is releasing this month. I think this is all we're getting
---
I have the Corsair and while the mouse is really nice and, the buttons have adjustable placement and are designed in a way that you can without displacing your finger click any of the buttons with different part of your thumb without activating another key - so IMO much better than Razer Naga for example. Unfortunately the software is shit so while the mouse definitely is up there, the iCUE application that comes along with the mouse and which is required to record macros causes me to have mixed feeling about the product.
---
wtf?
---
Maybe people are getting the client to allow as many people in as possible for the stress test
---
Norway and Denmark represented in top5 as well?
---
Coolt!
---
Thanks man! :D i will most definetly use this to ruin someones day
---
I hope this happens
---
How so?
---
I have paid more for games I never even played ... so ...
---
Thanks for the update man. Rolling mage myself haha. Anyway, I think its fair to say that warrior with a healer is an S tier pvp class(especially paladin). Of course mages are in general the bane of warriors existance.
---
And why wouldnt a fury "dps" have some prot talents too? I know this sounds wild, but not everyone needs to have 100% minmaxed talents all the time. In fact, most vanilla players opted for a middleground where they could both dps and tank in the same spec.   
---
My friend is going fury prot as a dps warrior, also you can tank 5 mans as a pure fury build too.
---
You suppose right. Furthermore, keep in mind that shamans can't dual wield in Classic (and they need 11 points in Enhancement to wield two-handed maces and axes).
---
What Vanilla had and retail does not?
---
Strat has some blues you can get without too much drama. Combine that with the blue pvp set, felcloth pieces and some leftovers from raids and you will be fine.
---
Would classic be worth installing on SSD? I assume load times would be minimal either way.

Do you really think I would keep T2 pieces if I was on a pserver?
---
https://youtu.be/iF7t7P9xBwA
---
You can see me here at 0:35, this was before I got T3 shoulders
---
Warriors and druids can use them use as well. Druids can't dual wield them though.
---
I see. Is it Rogues primarily that dual wield then?
---
&gt; 100% broccoli if we get TBC servers
---
What do you mean by this? I played feral and resto for TBC and it was so much fun.
---
[https://ibb.co/JzvvXF1](https://ibb.co/JzvvXF1)
---
&gt; There wont be nearly as many hunters
---
what gives you that idea? Everyone is saying hunter is the fastest and easiest to level so my guess is there will be a lot of people who play it just for this reason ( bad i know but i do really believe it as bad as it sounds)
---
Outside of the Rank 14 weapons, there are only 7 level 60 fist weapons. Only one of them is best-in-slot for any phase and that's the Silithid Claw for Hunters in Phase 5, which is essentially just a stat stick for them.
---
The only other two classes that would ever use them are Warriors and Rogues and it's mostly for the meme. Druids and Shaman *can* use them, but neither class can duel wield so they want two-handed weapons instead (plus Druids can't benefit from the many on-hit effects present on these weapons).
---
Yup, and Fury Warriors.
---
A reminder to every aspiring warrior player: if you're not ranking to 14 choose a different class
---
Feral Druid DPS in TBC was so much fun though, mangle, shred, rip, rake, savage roar, timers, trinkets. Hooooweee it was deep, WoTLK and TBC were my favourite times to be a feral druid.
---
Talent tree overhauls between 2004 release and patch 1.12.1 makes a **huge** difference, that is indeed correct.
---
1h/shield is viable up to 20 but starts to fall off around 15~, at 20 you get Seal of Command and then a slow 2h will be much better
---
I would like to see the team add new content to the existing world in areas that are unavailable, loot wise I want to see different types of sets rather than higher level items to give the players more options on how we can build our characters. Level cap remains at 60.
---
I will probably make logos just for fun ;)
---
There is a tangible reason tho. If I want to watch a classic stream, I don't want to go through a messy combination of both. Having them separated would be much more convenient for viewers. With that being said, I don't think Blizzard would like them separate because high classic viewership may reflect negatively on retail and it is more beneficial for them to have a single section with a big viewer number
---
Thank you for the useful information. I think that’s settled my class choice as I really like the idea of dual wielding.
---
Sorry shit happened man. :(
---
Ironfoe on my healing drood, to flex on those warrior

Rule #5: No real world politics or religion.

The ultimate thex style!
---
It went by so fast on my PC i thought it failed. Literally few seconds. But i did have updated beta/my old retail client ( they have updated beta at least once or twice after the beta ended ).
---
Theres basically nothing under the "Classic" folder (just like there isnt much under "classic beta". Its all under shared data files.
---
I use the hex for all mmos. It’s pretty good!!!
---
in vanilla he was right though. Warrior talent tree before AQ was kinda bad when it came to DPS-performance.
---
Maybe you should join a server in another region if you are working nights?
---
It's a hunter? xD They can dual wield first weapons as well
---
My lock in t2 had nearly 6k hp unbuffed. Really not that absurd.

You joined what was a civil discussion on my part until this guy who you probably knew beforehand(probably why you pretended to talk about me like I wasn't clearly going to see you talking about me) lost control over a discussion over whether purple wizards have bigger numbers than red wizards. Go fucking figure.
---
You made one comment that was childish
---
&gt; **Can you just stop please**. Warlocks do the absolute highest burst damage  in T3 gear. Not saying ele shammies can't boom, but nothing booms as  hard as a warlock. 
---
From that point on I think me calling you out on implying I was being irrational somehow made you angry instead of you reflecting on that way of talking to someone. Highlighted the part where you seemed to imply that I should **stop talking about WoW on a WoW forum.**
---
Thank you, useful comment poster
---
Ser fram emot ett bra spel fritt från micro transactions.
---
Not Safe For Warriors!
---
People who are saying MC will be cleared week 1 are delusional to time constraints. Getting to 60 alone will take even the fastest most efficient levelers and classes speed running 4-5 days /played time. So working out a system where a character can be leveling 24 hours for 5 days. Healers and warriors will likely take longer. 
---
Then on top of that they need to get 7ish people to grind hydraxian waterlord rep high enough / do the quests to get quintessence or whatever that water shit is to put out the runes required to summon domo. Grind/farm/craft the fire resistance gear that the tanks are going to need. Grind consumables to be used for the raid. Get the attunment done. Find 40+ people willing to do this bullshit. And then after all that they’d probably need atleast 4-6 hours of time available to clear molten core but probably closer to 6 since they’re gonna be dragging their asses with greens, blues, and mage level 45 water since they won’t have the higher level water shit yet. 
---
People are going to be most eye opened to just the sheer level of time consuming tedious bullshit vanilla wow gameplay was. A week one rag kill would require one of the the most coordinated and impressive speed run attempts in video game history because they would be starting at level 1 and slamming all the way to the moment ragnaros dies. It would require 24 hours of extremely efficient mistake free game play for 7 days straight, all the while the game servers are being slammed with all the new players / typical launch shenanigans. At best this requires 40 people with an extremely well coordinated multi box work shift schedule and flawless gameplay efficiency. At worst this is an astronomical event that requires the coordination of 80+ people taking turns playing. 
---
Someone killing rag on week 1 that the servers open would probably be the most impressive thing ever done in wow. Not necessarily because of raw skill. But because it requires extreme planning, coordination, and unwavering commitment. Even 1 of the 40 running into a snag could throw the entire attempt into derailment.
---
the problem is my work schedule is all over the place, I can work nights, days, weekdays and weekends and there is no way to know before monthly list posted
---
It was added i think yesterday, from the drop down menu under WoW, there should now be Classic option (non beta one). Select that and press install.
---
To be fair, it's good they see it as a research project. As much as I loved my time in late classic-bc/wrath, I do like seeing new content and check into bfa from time to time. If they manage to turn this vessel around and bring back the gameplay and rpg elements of classic (or even just inspired stuff) I would be extatic.
---
I find the hex perfect. Naga has too many buttons and I can’t click a single button without clicking their neighbours.
---
&gt;  it's just one of those 'back to town' side trips you're going to have to take a bunch
---
or you just stock up whenever you're in town so you dont have to go out of your way for it? for me hunter ammo is a positive of the class, not a negative
---
Rogues are the master of Dual Wielding followed by Fury Warriors, but Rogues are the only class that dual wield in PVP. Hunters *can* dual wield, but if they're ever actually using melee attacks rather than just holding onto the items for their stats, then they want to be using a two-handed weapon. Outside of some meme PVP specs, Rogues always use swords or daggers.
---
Yeah, I'm not looking to modify the GP willy-nilly, but to be able to increase costs on multi-class BiS items, whose values are greater than equivalent rarity/ilevel pieces of gear.
---
BiS gear should imo be weighted based on how many classes need it and how valuable that item truly is, not a static formula of ilevel and rarity. I don't mind flexing those values myself, but that would be done well in advance of a raid so everyone could give their input as to what pieces ought to cost most. As we know, Vanilla itemization is very finicky. Not all weapons, amulets, trinkets, etc. are created equal, but if I'm not mistaken, the formula would not take those nuances into account.
---
No, haha not based on dual wielding fist weapons. I seem to have wrongly assumed them as part of the class fantasy of Shamans. So failing that, a dual wielding sword or dagger Rogue looks good to me.
---
For the alliance! 
---
Oh, wait...
---
It's easier than charting the stars to try and find the next raid night 40 people with rotating schedules might line up.
---
Night Elf zone only, NE are very racist and won't let you speak to them so you won't be able to take any quest.
---
I think Rogue is how I’m leaning then.
---
It wasn't just the bonuses. In patch 2.0 they hadn't added the crit/hit rating system yet. Items still had % based values on them. 1% hit at lvl 60 was 1% hit at level 70. All that naxx gear had absurd levels of hit on it compared to prebis dungeon blues/t4
---
I would say that unless you are in a guild of equally crazy people you will just sit and wait on guildies for 3 weeks if you stress to max level. Wow classic is very much a marathon, no use in burning yourself out with reaching 60 in 2 weeks and getting BiS during the 3rd week...
---
Not everyone who voted to leave is a retadin, but every retadin voted to leave.
---
My logic was the warlocks don't have down time due to life tap and the priest, would this not make up for it?
---
I only ever tried DaoC back in the day so I cannot boast of any real experience to compare to wow, but gameplay-wise I seem to recall DaoC gameplay and character movement to be very sluggish, clunky and clumsy. Very hamfisted overall. WoW in comparison is incredibly fluid and 100% perfectly responsive to any movement by keys and mouse.
---
Classic-wow is a great adventure that has something for all tastes. If you love PvE then you're LOVE WoW, likewise if you love PvP you will also LOVE WoW.
---
Also 3 mages is not a possible comp for us
---
You'd be amazed by the number of guilds that aren't able to clear BWL on Pserver due to low skill from some player.
---
Well 2 mages then, the priest can watch I guess.
---
If only launch time was 7pm as well..
---
1. Don't do them.
---
2. If people didn't like outlands they wouldn't have gone through the portal.  Older content wouldn't have gotten "destroyed" and "invalidated" if people preferred it to the old content.
---
3. Shadow Priest PVP was shit on in TBC, and in turn they became loved in PVE content.  They weren't homogenized, there were no pugfinder dungeons and raids, TBC didn't start wow down some crappy path outside arguably flying.
---
4. Don't run them.
---
5. Don't play in outland.  Azeroth didn't go away until Cata.
---
6. You don't get flying until 70.  After you've done the traveling and exploration on foot.  I already pointed this out.  Stop going back to it.
---
7. Don't do them.
---
8. I suppose you wanted to use an arcanite reaper forever too?
---
9. You are in the vast minority.  A lot of people like classic AND previous expansions as well.  No one has said they want to take your binky away.
---
you will have the same problem if you tried to join something like a sports team. games and training will be on set days. thats the downside of shift work, it fucks with your schedule
---
Make that 1 and 3/4th of a year
---
Well the system does allow you to pass in an explicit GP value if you don't want to use the calculated one.
---
If you do want to go with your own values, I'd highly recommend coming up with a mathematical model for it. If you don't want to go that route, loot council backed by a dkp system you can reference might be more what you're looking for.
---
&gt;Even Blizzard doesn't want to give Classic a separate directory on the launcher.
---
Stolen right from the 2007scape sub
---
And my bow!
---
Just an update to any spectators I am gathering up the coefficients of the spells and their base damages and will be posting the math behind my educated guess sometime soon to settle this drama fest, I think Mjolnoggy calling this much set up and cast time the most reliable burst damage in the game is probably wrong and requires seduce trains or other big cooldowns that aren't as reliable especially when the warlock has to run to 20 or so yards to shadowburn, but I'll accept that range and add fireblast to the mage and calculate blastwave and cone separately if he wants to call those 2 short range spells unreasonable. Gnight. /u/FeistySink is invited &lt;3
---
In the end I was trying to argue my opinion here (**warlocks are the** **garage sale version** **of mages and shamans**, and we only put up with it because they can teleport useful classes around the map).
---
Show me a screenshot of your original Thex character and we can talk
---
Horizontal progression content or release of BC without the gamechangers and flaws ( although inguess that if they think about releaseing BC I don’t think they are open to change the core systems of the expansion)
---
I leveled prot in tbc after watching wowhobbes too much. 
---
If you get a quest in an area with tightly packed melee mobs then it's glorious, watching your health go down then bubble healing to full never gets old. But if a quest is less optimal then it's very slow, although if you pop on a 2hander im not convinced its much worse than ret, and both specs have 0 downtime.
---
If endgame tanking was possible id do it again
---
Harder dungeons that actually require CC
---
Harder raids that can't be cheesed with world buffs
---
25 man easier to manage than 40 people
---
Every spec is viable and provides some sort of buff to your raid
---
Unlimited debuff slots
---
Arenas
---
Haste stat
---
T5 in the game at launch, all you need to do is get attuned no waiting for content phases
---
Most raids out of any expansion
---
Attunement chains are long and compelling
---
I hope you got every one of them banned.
---
That should be perfect then! Thanks for all your hard work.
---
I believe you're overestimating the amount of time you need a bit. 
---
Some of the more motivated guilds I've talked to have plans that sound feasible. They'll level in spellcleave/meleecleave dungeon farm groups or as Mages/Hunters for fast leveling speeds. According to their calculations it'll take approx. 3-3.5 days /played to 60. They will then split up into boosting groups, rep farm groups, and gear farm groups.  Also, there are players in the guilds whose main job is to provide professions, or to level warlocks for summons, to skip most of the walking time. They're saying they don't even account share, but all play 18-20 hours a day. I can't say if that'll turn out true, thoguh.
---
I think Week 1 is possible and we will see multiple Week 1 kills. Some guilds are insanely motivated and well prepared.
---
The only thing you said that's true, is that Paladins are Alliance only. You wont have trouble building a pvp set as a Priest. Hunters are not the most populated class.
---
Iirc from back in the day they released the list like a day or two before launch. And I'd bet they'll follow a similar strategy this time around (replacing launch with name reservation).
---
Company was much different then and I grew up in times where you don’t be a bitch because someone said something mean to you online.
---
Yes shaman started dual wielding in TBC. They largely used 2h maces / if they could get a nice axe in vanilla as enhancing.
---
I literally come to classicwow to escape bs like this =(
---
So having a simple quest you can in a few minutes daily is like a job but tediously doing repeatable quests for hours on end was fine?
---
Here I thought that was an improvement.  Oh, and you actually got a reward for doing them.  There are a lot of things I am looking forward to in classic, but grinding classic rep is not one of them.  :D
---
When BWL came out, [Claw of the Black Drake](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19365) was the #2 weapon for non-human rogues and was only narrowly beaten by  [Chromatically Tempered Sword](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19352). By the end of Naxx it's beaten by three better swords, two better maces and the R14 weapon, but that's not bad for a phase 2 weapon that looks totally awesome.
---
The #2 best offhand rogue weapon in the game (and best PVP offhand) is also a fist weapon -  [Claw of the Frost Wyrm](https://classicdb.ch/?item=23242).
---
As a PVP hemo rogue I'm hoping to join a BWL boost run and buy the Claw, I did exactly that in vanilla.
---
Shared data folder means that if it sees the same data in the World of Warcraft folder it won’t duplicate  the data thereby reducing the download size.
---
Do you hotkey each instance of the game and play them all at the same time?
---
That's true, but doesn't change the fact that if you expect progression to take months for "the best guilds" because that's what it was back then you'll disappoint yourself. People have min-maxed this game to hell and back.
---
https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/229093-ragnar-os-part-of-a-balanced-raid.jpg
---
There are 28 epic level 60 swords in Classic, 21 without caster stats.
---
I have no doubt guilds are going to make the attempt and have plans to do so. But I’m going to be extremely impressed by every single guild that succeeds in week 1. Even planning and coordinating these dungeon groups, assigning people to provide professions, farm groups ect if impressive in itself.
---
Thanks for the explanation, i had forgotten the index part of arrays, so it does actually make sense that you'd wanna subtract 1 from txt since it starts from 0 as you said.
---
I am still abit confused about the modulus and some of the rest, but i will dig down and see if i can't make up some console.logs etc to make myself understand it better! this is quite interesting from the pov of someone still learning the basics!
---
i thought this was a meme post but wow...
---
I dont get it. Whats the joke?
---
From experience, no it's not possible to keep up with school when addicted to WoW
---
As a rogue , im still praying that the leeway , for ANY reason, wasnt real on the beta. Fighting a Warrior will be crazy hard if not.
---
Love wins!
---
When you tank a raid in vanilla the boss will hit you and your rage bar will be near full. Also you usually want to start a pull with a ragepot + dumping rage on heroic strikes for burst threat since the pull is where most aggro mishaps happen.
---
Literally the post above it on my feed.
---
It reminds me of all those RL grudges grown from nothing.
---
A: "hi!"  
---
B: *deep in thoughts*  
---
A: "wow, he's ignoring me, what a dick"

B: "hi!"  
---
A: *yeah, sure, I'm not talking to you anymore*  
---
B: "wow, he's ignoring me, what a dick"  
---
A: *oh, great, that dick again, let's pretend I don't see him*  
---
B: *oh, great, that dick again, let's pretend I don't see him*
---
This is awesome, you get to learn the game like a true OG!
---
I see your point! That actually makes sense. I heard higher Tier Sets actually start becoming useful.
---
Someone posted it above, there are Spell/Melee-cleave groups already up and assigned. These will get mages/hunters to 60 in 3.5-4 Days. These are then assigned to repfarm for douses, BOE Gear Farming and Boosting the rest of the Raid.
---
Weirdly I don't remember watching Creed, but I do remember watching his "special" cousin Breed.

You only wear defensive gear for a handful of fights. Bosses don't hit that hard and threat gear is better anyway.

If you're from EU, feel free to fire me an inbox. I'm rolling Horde with a few irl / online friends and I would be more than happy to show you the ropes / shoot the shit with you on Discord while we level
---
They are completely different clients so that is not a good measure unfortunately. Classic wow uses the modern client.
---
Hardcore Guilds WILL clear MC in 7 Days.
---
Ony CAN be cleared by 10 People (not in Stage 1 tho).
---
I was in one of the most competitive Raidguils on PServers. We were fighting for the Speedrun record week in, week out for years.
---
All i spent for Raid-Prepping was done in 3 hours per Week. Then MC/BWL which took 1.5 hours together with walking and porting out.
---
So up to AQ i spent 4.5 hours per Week for Hardcore-Raiding.
---
well, you set req lvl to 60. I didn't and I count Krol Blade as a top level weapon, as it's often used as a pre raid bis item. 
---
The only other item you knock out with all of your filters is the paladin aq quest sword, which i wouldn't define as a caster weapon. It was supposed to be a tank weapon for paladins, but it just ended up being crap.
---
So, that's how I got 23.
---
You don't need to be level60 to enter MC.
---
From lvl50 players can enter through BRD, from 55 they can do the attunement quest.
---
Don't be afraid to flesh out the raid with lower levels.
---
I have been considering a Rival 500. I honestly dont need so many buttons as the g600 and I like the buttons on top of the mouse. Possibly a better shape, just not sure of the quality. Reviews are mixed. 
---
I bought a tartarus awhile back and honestly used it for 20 minutes and wasnt feeling it. I think I would need quite some time to get used to it, only not sure I really want too. The thumb buttons are the only thing going for it. The 8 way directional stick I could never use for movement and this is what I was hoping to use. It felt so wrong but binding them to other keys could be workable.
---
I highly doubt all 3 letter names will be 'camped'.  You're looking at 17576 names..
---
Fucking great, just when I am on a work trip out of country. Fml.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Absolutely. If you're playing from launch, PVP servers won't be that bad as you won't see bored 60s running around killing lowbies. I played on a fresh private PVP server recently and unwanted PVP was barely a hinderance.
---
The best way of avoiding being ganked is to never gank anyone yourself. If you are ganked and you feel you're likely to be camped, the easiest way of handling any frustration is to move to a new area or play an alt.
---
my best bet will be trying to switch with my colleagues when there is a raid on my work hours. and maybe asking the list maker guy to not write me on raid days if he listens to me :)
---
HD4000 is also an onboard from 2012.
---
For all german fellows this is 20 pm
---
"haha". Can we not bring politics in here thank you?
---
Amazing, I was looking forward to this. Keep it up
---
Norway and Sweden used to be Danish, the glory days
---
Harddrive? What are you a caveman? SSD or GTFO
---
That seems pretty accurate to me since renew should benefit from 100% of spell power at max lvl (20% per tick) but spell learned before lvl 20 have a smaller coefficient.
---
Pretty much just horrific accidents, war, and cult things.
---
thats part of the meme
---
It also launches midday on a weekday.
---
Get him boys
---
Yup. Want to work something out with two groups of friends and with loads of people away on holiday or would be nice to have at least a week to sort everything.
---
My PC #2, which is a 3570k from 2012 without a GPU has this.
---
Ok I'm getting a new GPU for my Ryzen 3600 so my 280x will go in it
---
It's like making lockdown on toddler. You check up on him "are you calm now?" and he's REEEEing all over again so you just keep the lockdown and go watch show for another 15 minutes.  
---
Jesus fucking christ to think op is an adult.
---
wtf sonofabitch i was constantly poor because i could never decide whether i wanted to pvp or win the deeps (at the time combat swords was the only pve rogue spec people knew of).  I never got an epic mount in like 1.5 years of vanilla lol
---
I ran the stress test on a 2009 computer with a gtx 760 at over 300fps, everyone will be fine
---
BIS literally means best-in-slot. Is Krol Blade ever BIS? No. And your price estimate is WAY off and completely baseless. The historical data for every major private server AND the archived auctioneer data shared between speculators suggests it will be 800g or more. In the ~16 hours it will take for you to farm that, you could have farmed a Dal'Rend's with your guild.
---
Wern’t they able to tho somewhere in the beginning?
---
I think this should only be your worry if you want to join a hardcore/world first guild. Semi-Hardcores won't care. You'll still run MC months after release until every tank and dps that wants Thunderfury stops crying.
---
Ok just shipping it to Europe would probably be double the cost of that t-shirt.
---
Balanced as all things should be.
---
Bingo! No particular plans for the first 2 hours of the test as just logging in might be a game in itself, but at some point over the two days I'll use the time to get all my macros &amp; addons set up so I hopefully won't need to do much setting up on release day.
---
It's okay classic has such low requirements you can play it on half a computer!
---
TALLY HO
---
Omg it's getting closer!
---
The class icons? That would be sweet
---
Give and take I feel. Addon is much nicer even with two monitors, but the route seems meh.
---
Don’t worry about it in advance. Create your charatcter, login and discover everything like we did a long time ago. You‘ll be fine and have agreat journey :)
---
They do.
---
Well, I want to play as a tank, and nothing else, so half of what you said seems like pros toward warrior to me.
---
Doesn’t that hydra boss that you need to fish to summon in zul gurub drop a turtle mount? Or did I just hallucinate that.
---
That's why I'm tanking. Every death is clearly the healers fault.
---
its like the general forums now, full of morons and this shit actually gets upvoted...
---
What if I want thex thexx thexy and thexxx. “Why should one man have all that power”- Ghandi
---
Yes can confirm I am downloading it rn. P.S. I am so fucking hyped and I never even played vanilla.
---
Time to setup our addons boyyyss
---
So cool, thanks for that. I do wonder how many expansions they can do before the community is thinned out beyond sustaining a proper community for any of them (if that is a problem at all)
---
I see a Thex meme, I upvote. 
---
It's honest work.
---
Not visible for me either. I am in EU tho. 
---
/u/Siebolic, are you in EU as well? 
---
/u/sacerdose are you also in EU region?
---
The problem is that bis is the wrong term. The correct term would be equipment guide. But instead we get bis-lists. It's not my fault people mislabel it, because they only care about the absolute best choice.
---
Oh right, private server data. Let's take that instead of historical vanilla data, where Krol usually went for 200-300g. Everything is heavily inflated on private servers. I've never seen this weapon go for more than 400g and I've had 5 people in my guild who raided with krol around 3 months after vanilla launch.
---
No this guy is lying. I had the original character name. I am thex
---
I was dumb enough to sell all my Hunter vanilla gear when tbc launched, I wanted the flying mount ASAP. Full t1 t2 t3 armor , dozens of unobtainable items, only rhok delar left. I regret it so much even after all those years.
---
Yea that's how I read it I'm just baffled that nobody is discussing this here. There have been so many ppsts and replies by people who dream about classic+ and yet when the Devs hint at the actual possibility, nobody talks about it...
---
Thanks, I wasn't sure anymore when the redemption NPC was added to the game, I knew it was around the end of Vanilla, but had hoped it was already in 1.12. Disappointing, but it makes sense.
---
I hope it isn't Roziku
---
You mean the Football season starting? Yeah - I hate that too :/ Football suxx
---
OMG MY DAD GOT A RAISE I CAN'T WAIT TO DONATE WITH MY BROS TO ASMON
---
I really appreciate the kind words brother thank you. I try to be open minded as I can lol, I’m new to this whole YouTube thing so I’m definitely learning as I go
---
Lmao yeah I was tripping when I saw a -1
---
Been revisiting warcraft 3 to refresh on the lore/get that nostalgia flowin right
---
Nope already taken... I think it was some Troll dude... called Thex
---
To add to that
---
&gt;  Also, is it better recruiting random pick-ups to hit 40 players even if  they underperform or is it okay just going in as 20-30 guildmates? 
---
People that hit level 60 quick are usualy above average players and on top of that I never understood why people think that " a bunch of friends and friends of friends " are better than random players.
---
Hey man! Yes, in short — you can’t use consumables and items (like grenades) in form. 
---
But on use gear/ trinkets  like the ones your mentioned CAN be used in form, and I HIGHLY recommend you get then all especially if you pvp :) hope this helps!
---
Unless you absolutely hate PvP for me the biggest argument rolling on a PvE server is time constraint. If you are a player with extremely limited time to play and still have a goal of doing lots of endgame content I could see why it would make sense to go PvE.
---
My g/f isn't a gamer but she wants to try Classic with me. She likes the concept of warrior the most, in part I think because she seems to think it will be more straight forward to be a big brutish melee.
---
We probably won't party with others and I don't really care how she performs but it isn't fun to play if you feel weak either so I am curious is a warrior decently straight forward in dps gameplay at lower lvls? Just to learn about the game for a newbie.
---
he's showing footage probably from an instant 60 server where people have access to tier 3, no matter what you play you'll get creamed with t0.
---
Yeah that’s fine. I remember people fishing for attention in guild chat all the time by writing about every level up. This annoyed me so much. I might say go in pug groups as well, we’ll see
---
Joa

Did you force and schedule the divorce closing particulary with regards to the release of wow classing on 27th?
---
Please see my benchmarking post, [found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c23tlc/i_spent_600_buying_old_pc_parts_to_benchmark_the/)
---
It runs much better than BFA, and in a separate test (not shown in that post), it ran better than the Vanilla 1.12 client.
---
Back in my day, we used to work 3 shifts of 24 hrs each, twice a day.
---
I'm playing with a chinese mechanical keyboard with red switches, as for the mouse, it's a roccat nyth. Pretty good stuff.
---
I just find it really interesting that most of the people who are interested in playing (70.5% at the time of my posting) started in Vanilla, though that might have been a no brainer.
---
Nice. I'll wait in STV so you can stealth me out of the bush.
---
Courtesy isn't a currency to be exchanged. It is not owed or earned. Courtesy is an attribute that defines the quality of your character, and is only limited by your own pride.
---
retail is around 60gb IIRC. but you have to remember, retail is on it's 7th expansion now and the size only increases with each new expansion. Can't realistically expect for retail to be smaller. Not only is it essentially 8x the size of vanilla in terms of dungeons/raids, practically everything from cata+ also has a ton more detail. The amount of polygons lets say the final room/boss fight of antorus has probably equals to all of naxx combined and i don't think this is an exaggeration.
---
Just take it, plz
---
No. BIS has always meant BIS. And 17 sets of data is a LOT more reliable than the bullshit from a single anonymous reddit user you doesn't know what "best in slot" means. And you really don't understand how to compare those two weapons at all.

I think it's harmless because it's a meme. Comments about politics because of the meme should be deleted, not the meme.

The fundamental issue with retail is that while the content isn't bad, the game play is sub par to those who played pre-pruning/pre-cross realm zones/pre-premade group finder/etc.

Class design essentially turned into designing any given class to be able to be played on a console controller. When you factor in 4 buttons, the 4 bumpers (XBox and PS), and the combinations you can make with those buttons, current classes are too simplified for even that. I don't know if there was a half-hearted push to port to consoles, or if it's more for the sake of less things to balance, or even if they wanted to do more of a moba, "here's 2-3 buttons to smash until the last one lights up" style game play, but it really doesn't seem like it had an intended effect besides making classes feel bland. Game play doesn't need to be mind-numbingly difficult, but the "smash then nut" feels too much like an arcade game. The current talent trees have no character to them and its basically all based on whether in PVP or AOE/ST. Yeah, old talent trees were "cookie cutter," but as players actually playing the game, it feels like you have some sense of control of how the class plays. Do you want to go 2H or DW? Do you want it to play faster or do you want more emphasis on one of your abilities hitting harder? I don't understand the defeatist, "meh, it's gonna be cookie cutter anyways so it doesn't matter" attitude. I'd rather pretend that I have control over what I can do. In a sense, besides gear, classes just play like "champs" instead of characters you design. Stat weights aren't meaningful outside of the top 1% of PVE where the .1% extra mastery instead of crit has a better output. As much as systems like enchanting and gemming make gearing somewhat of a chore, it feels more like progression when you can stack stats and test different builds. Say 100 haste makes your resource-generating attack x% faster while 100 mastery makes your resource-spending attack cause a DoT effect for x% of damage done. What's more important? If balanced, they can be similar output and just be a matter of taste. 
---
As far as content goes, I feel like there is (or should be) instance fatigue where having tourist mode&gt;easy mode&gt;hard mode&gt;impossible mode for every instance means that the average player is seeing the same stuff over and over again as they progress along. There's no feeling of progression when you're basically treadmilling from difficulty to difficulty with the same bosses, the same scenery. Beating/seeing a boss doesn't mean anything because you can LFR your way from start to end and see everything. Blizz needs to stop being afraid of exclusivity with content. If I'm not in a raiding guild, I can accept that I don't deserve to see the last boss of a raid when it's current content. 
---
The game has a lot of "content" but it's the equivalent of ordering a 24 ounce steak instead of a 16 ounce one because you expect it to be more filling and half of it being fat. Sure, you can "eat the fat" and do the "extra" content like pathfinder/world quests/rep grinds/etc., but for a lot of people, the chore content isn't fun. It's just more busywork. There's a lot to do, but it's to the point where it just feels too overwhelming for what it should be.
---
Don't worry about the time you'll take leveling. Many people will burn themselves out by going as fast as they can. You'll have plenty of time to level at your pace and take on raids afterwads.   
---
By chillmode leveling, you also might meet some people you wouldn't have met otherwise, maybe create a guild together, improving your chances to build something solid for your competitive desires.
---
Tell her to be an enhance shaman. Totems are fun, the class is strong and has heals. Warrior leveling is all about your weapon. Plan your leveling around getting routine upgrades, and it’s not that bad. First aid, good amount of agility for deep wound crits even if it comes from leather
---
I miss those times man
---
It will be 8pm in Europe
---
Yeah, a post that suggests Horde players voted for Brexit is inflammatory at best and definitely not a harmless meme. The only reason it hasn't already been deleted is because the mods aren't awake and online.

New wife is on classic. The original online dating service

There isn't some magical vendor. 
---
To get BiS gear in BfA you have two options really: Do the mythic raids (you probably can't do this unless you are in a very hardcore guild) or farm heroic raids, PvP etc and hope to get very lucky by titanforging some gear into the same iLevel as Mythic raiding gear.
---
it's not that late, pretty sure the punishment is only for sub lvl20.

2pm on August 8th for EST.

My Macs all have active cooling, and I WoWed on portable and desktop versions ~15 years ago.

I mean she'll lose interest very early on as a Warrior if she's new to gaming. Even for me Solo-Lvling as a Warrior on Classic was annoying. It's not "yeah finally I got this mob down"-difficult, it's more like "3 Keyboards later I finally didn't get crit by this same level mob and survived"-difficult. I'd say level with her or advise her to play hunter/warlock for the Pets maybe. Girls love Pets.

We're the best. End of discussion.

Yeah man, you're right about the leveling speed. I played a druid on a pserver recently and found the levelling to be a breeze. It was more a comment on the video itself, it's a strong video that highlights some amazing parts to the druid but its focus seems to be on PvP. Maybe throwing in PvE reasons is a good idea as well. Cheers
---
Hey friend, do you want to raid casually? Because most casual guilds I've had contact with didn't mind if you miss some raids out.
---
Strict days are obviously the easiest choice and makes the most sense.
---
Why not buy a real computer?
---
He is using Dota and Lol as the source, although omitting CS/CSGO is kinda weird, not as big tournies as the two other, but just as many people playing.
---
Umm, the top end damage difference is 2. 81-151 on dal'rend and 80-149 on krol. What's the big deal?
---
&gt;A spy alt.
---
They will be far less common than private servers due to the subscription requirements. Far fewer people will be willing to buy a 2nd BFA and pay a 2nd subscription than there were people willing to make a 2nd free pserver account.
---
i guarantee you there was a trial because i talked to someone in the ud starting zone back then and we couldn't trade because of the restrictions.
---
So field "**Field\_1\_13\_2\_30073\_008"** is supposed to be the "coefficient"-column in the list?
---
Then [Blade of Eternal Darkness](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spelleffect&amp;build=1.13.2.31209#search=17780&amp;page=1) would have a 100% coefficient as well and could potentially be BiS for every caster?

Wow, thanks a lot! Happy to contribute :)

Yes, thanks...!

I'm in EU region, and have the option for WoW Classic...!!! Installed it yesterday!!! :D :D

downvote is a poor arguement to make

Joana's leveling guide for Horde is the only one I can think of right now
---
I have a question regarding this, you think that I will be able to enter in the game and pick a name on 13 of August with the 14 days of  World of Warcraft Starter Edition?
---
Thanks
---
Actually on reading what you've said, you're right. Engineering is **the** best profession for PvP. The point I was trying to make is that your time out of forms (if pvping) is when you're vulnerable so you want to minimise this, so engineering will be semi-useful. Your point still stands.
---
Low lvl warrior dps depends on what gear you have(mostly the weapon). Besides that the biggest downside to their dps I can think of would be their lack of healing.
---
I recommend everyone that wants to play a warrior to pick up first aid and cooking. These professions speed up their lvling by so much, that it's almost mandatory.
---
Lvling will obviously be much faster when you lvl together with a class that can heal.
---
Well-placed hype indeed. Vanilla is just... fuck maing...!!! :D :D :D
---
I never said krol was bis. I said it was used a pre raid bis item. Meaning, people would get krol and call it good enough, because, well, it is. Nobody, who got a krol blade farmed a dal'rend setand many people would rather buy a krol instead of farm a dal'rend set.
---
Classic have also the advantage that is on separate hardware. The last interview confirmed that a lot of hardware was deployed for Classic, on all regions, something Blizzard haven't done since 2005.
---
Caught wind that tanking is best done with a dagger due to swing speed. This contradicts the builds that see swords/ axes being classed as bis. Can anyone confirm for me, what is best to use? Or does it vary depending on tier progress?
---
Can someone explain what this means: 
---
“Metal capable GPU with 1 GB VRAM”
---
I plan on playing wow classic on my 2015 MacBook Pro until my friends sells me his second PC. I’m just gonna assume my MacBook Pro has enough power to play since I used to run mists of pandaria on it but I just wanna be sure.
---
I’ve only seen throttling while doing a GPU mining test. They handle WoW graphics no problem.
---
Was still very new to the game, like lvl 20 or something in ashenvale. Was jut running down the road and all of a sudden I see like 60 green names running in the opposite direction, so obviously I start running with them. Was a random guild called Invaders and they were going to raid Astranaar, I quickly got a guild invite and we camped that city for hours for not other reason than we could and that among other things hooked me on a 7 year wow addiction.
---
Just do what I do and assume everyone is a dick and don't talk to them. It makes life a lot simpler.
---
ESO is pretty big. Its on its 3rd expansion...
---
I will do it for sure. Was doing it anyway for the name reserve, on 12th. Makes zero sense not to do it on 8th.
---
I feel like it was just straight up forced to become a subreddit-wide meme. The post was funny by its own though.
---
Soo I'm not sure what I would call myself. I like to Play the occasional BG when I'm 60 - besides that I really dislike ganking People even once because I feel like I ruined their experience while leveling :P
---
At 60 I usually won't attack either because I just feel bad afterwards :3
---
I have never played on a PVE Server still and I never felt like I was abusively ganked by other Players. I don't even feel like I have been killed an excessive amount of times Overall while leveling. 
---
Of course STV is a War Zone but I guess - a lot of People feel the same I do and just don't bother with killing others...
---
Personally I think I would miss the PVP aspect if I was to Play on a PVE Server even though I'm not too much into PVP.
---
What class are you planning to Play? Mages have a good time leveling on PVP Servers while Warriors will not have so much fun I guess :P
---
In the end I would recommend PVP either way no matter what you Play simply because danger you always feel. It's emotional ups - and downs that really get you into the game I think and you will probably have more of those on a PVP realm!
---
Jesus this dude always talking about his ridiculous tests lmao
---
I had the corsair and its a pain in the ass. For one the side buttons are too low so my thumb drags the mousepad while using the lowest buttons. Its advertized as an mmo mouse but i had to fight 2 days with the software to get it to work with WoW. 1/5 would not recommend.
---
And to install addons:)
---
While this is true that you \*can\* enter, I think you're missing the fact mobs in there are levels 61-63 and lower levels will get hit with crushing blows, and also do next to 0 damage at all given the fact hit rating will be lower cause of gear, topped off with needing more than normal to even hit anything.
---
That's what I've done... I suspect the load times would be a bit long on HDD, no? That's what I remember from playing WoW vanilla on my old Dell Inspiron XPS (HDD). Now with an SSD, retail (starter edition) loads much more quickly. Well, you can always test it on HDD first, and then see...? If it even cut the time down by half (though I suspect it's more than that), I think it would be worth it. And Classic is a small game, so even a small SSD (120/128GB) would be enought to install an OS and the game. G'luck!
---
Could be, I haven't needed to downrank for a long time so I've forgotten most of the fine details
---
For a mafia to work, it needs total control. The moment a larger competing group shows up, you lose that control.
---
And no, a mage cannot poly fast enough to stop a whole raid just FYI, the poly heal would only tick once/1,5sec and it is not enough healing to stop the mob from dying
---
They likely have a solution, the issue is they're just designers and their opinion doesnt carry the same weight as a data analyst looking at numbers to decide whats good instead of intangible factors such as "is this actually fun, or are people doing these things because they have too in order to progress"
---
Example: data probably showed people enjoy mission tables since it shows everyone spending so much time there. The issue is they HAVE TO, but that doesn't mean they're having "fun".
---
Aha, that explains it. Yes, that's great for LBS and even better if you have a miner in the group.
---
I'm surprised that the other user hadn't tried the method shown in the video. :o
---
I mean if your level 55 dudes are getting aggro then you have other problems. Dps does suck but it should be ok for the first couple of bosses, especially if it’s mostly healer/decurser classes
---
I second this. You can hate on Blizzard for many things, but their customer support is always helpful.
---
No, do you have any data that contradicts this massive survey taken by 14000 people?
---
Stuck between choosing a druid or warrior and due to IRL circumstances I will probably never see the insides of aq40 and naxx.
---
Topping meters doesn’t give me a hard on and taking/supporting is what I find most satisfying. 
---
I find feral druid quite interesting, either as the 14/31/6 build or 0/30/21 build where I can switch between tanking and healing, but I am worried about the stigma. On the other hand rolling warr would probably give me an easier time getting into raids. 
---
What would be a better choice for a casual gamer like me?
---
It is never worth waiting for the slow guys if the difference in speed is more than one or two raid resets. 
---
You'll hit 60 then farm some dungeons and then what? Wait for the slow guys to hit 60 2 weeks later, after which they will do dungeons for another 2 or 3 weeks?  
---
Needless to say that some of them might take breaks or quit.  
---
Meanwhile your most hardcore and dedicated players are twiddling their thumbs waiting for people who will likely have lower raid attendance, less consumables, and overall a more casual attitude? No they'll be looking for another guild to raid with if you don't give them raids.
---
Pugging and guild cooperations aren't solutions past those 1-2 raid resets I mentioned earlier because other guilds will fill quicker.  
---
Your real problem is reserving raid slots for people who won't hit 60 until it is too late. This is the reason most guilds distinguish between their raid team and the non-raiding members ("socials").  
---
If someone wants to go from social member to raider they need to be able to keep up with the rest of the guild. They'll catch up soon enough and then they might have to wait until a raid spot opens up - or might not get one at all - but that's preferable to making everyone wait for the slowest guy.
---
Just keep recruiting as many hardcore players as possible (as long as their attitude and behaviour is good).
---
Lol - that’s awesome
---
XM1 mouse. I love lightweight mice with 2 keys on the side, and they promise the fastest response time, and that's nice.
---
Well no one who speaks German could be evil.
---
Looks like you haven't really been involved in the mafia.. We could easily take on raids of 40ppl with about 15-20man group so it is no issue. And 2nd if we miss 1 or 2 leathers it is not the end of the world, you just buy them away from the AH
---
Interesting! I'll look for some info on what that would actually look like.
---
I am. A troll shaman.
---
Classic in 4K? Is that even possible?
---
This is great and all, but it really needs its own category. Having Retail under the same search just ruins it.
---
what is a Un'goro/Devilsaur mafia?
---
I hope your will respect the prenup, it is so easy to overthrow it in court and for your wife to take everything from you, divorce courts are sexist man.
---
With your attitude you are going to have a raid of sub par specs doing way less than optimal dps and healing and taking way way longer to clear content. Leaving players who dont want to spend an hour extra just because selfish people can be all "play how you want, im a boomkin and we still clear the raid". These memespecs are called memespecs because they are really far from optimal and thats incredibly selfish. 
---
I dont surround myself with selfish people. But as i said id bring them if we had a spot. But they will be last prio for loot. Team players that dedicate themselves to improve the raid get loot first.
---
That's fair, I played BFA for around a week at most.
---
My point is that people here are generally more interested in retail that they've wanted to admit, and that his 90% figure is contradicted by the data we have.
---
I wasn’t talking about them pulling aggro, just them getting hit in general, both by attacks that hit multiple things, and AoE, and just came to me now, the amount of stamina on gear isn’t going to give them the health to stay alive from AoE damage. 
---
Also just considered their agro range, as in body pulls.
---
I’d consider it for classes with decurse I guess but beyond that I’d rather run with less players
---
I am Thex.

Omg we spammed the dowload botten but we cant plaay. Plls blizzard let us in
---
In TBC they can.
---
Healed as Shadow Priest even in the easier raids (up to BWL) and never had any issues as a young 14 year old noob.
---
Sure, if people find out you might get flamed, but tbh all this min-maxing that this sub claims will happen to 100% of the community isn't how the game was (or will be if it's similar to private servers) by any means.
---
If I could do it as a dumb 14 year old (first char to 60) anybody can.
---
Does anyone know of an MMO-mouse which is wireless? I haven’t been able to find one and am considering a Logitech wireless pro.
---
Danke mein Freund.
---
Why stress????? Are they Classic WoW will stress them out?? I don't get it.
---
Haha you said "ass"
---
If you didn’t like WoW in 2005, you’re not going to like Classic.  It’s still going to be cartoony and easy compared to DAoC.  The PvP is quite a bit different, although I’ll say Classic’s PvP System is lot closer to DAoC’s than later version of the game.
---
Oh boy you're in for a treat!
---
Where were all those enthusiasts when random devilsaurs were ambushing my ass when I was peacefully gathering herbs in un'goro 15 years ago.
---
.. and it's under attack. No more X words please but me some slack.
---
I have a similir list for people who say ”ding” in gchat on every level up.
---
For the level 30 whirlwind quest, everyone can find the item drops off elementals in Arathi Highlands. It would be sweet if people would not vendor them and AH them for cheap. Help get your tanks up to 60 so we can tank yo dungeons and help you farm those pre-bis!
---
You can play it in 8K if you have the hardware. Wow will use ANY windows supported resolution, from day one. The new widescreen ones just showed a cut down picture, due vanilla having fixed field of view value (need a mem hack to fix it).
---
In the client.
---
Sorry I should have clarified that we are leveling together and I am a healer. She will never lvl solo. How is the actual gameplay of warrior? Is it very complex early?
---
HEY THEX YOU BUDDY!!
---
&gt;hunter doesn’t scale well with gear, which put me off.
---
This is primarily for raid dps, not so much for pvp.
---
Enhnancement shaman is a lottery spec. Yeah sometimes you oneshot other times you do nothing. You have no mobility and no way to remove CC, so you are gonna get kited by basically every class.
---
Con of Hunter: Your DPS is akin to cutting steak with a butter knife.
---
Con of Shaman: Your DPS is akin to cutting steak with a spork.

I'd group with him. No grats for you, buddy.
---
Yes I can't wait for raid finder wing 2 😁
---
Ironically it sounds like a lot of weight is about to be heeped on as well. I'll be here all night (until I have to go to bed for work)
---
I’d wager many of these folks are on the classic “10/11am-6/7pm” tech schedule that was the norm for me at places like Az, Gg, Ms.
---
I definitely started playing wow in TBC with a free trial disc that came with my South Park DVDs. It wasn't a level 20 trial though it was a 14 day trial.
---
I have seen a couple of People talk about rushing to 60 and farming devilsaur leather for a couple of days.
---
It can give you enough Gold for the next 2 years to come if you are quick and farm a lot... Those leathers sell for 20-40 Gold later when the Devilsaur set Comes out...
---
You seem knowledgeable, why doesn’t hunter scale so well for pve and but ok for pvp? I know the pet is not affected by gear, any other factors?
---
You wanna buy a comma?  
---
    
---
Or are you actually trying to tell us that you single-handedly were responsible for a hotfix involving flask of supreme power?

Claw of the black Drake is great if there aren’t enough swords dropping, that’s about it.

For this remote there is an app, so you dont need it :-)

I sure hope so. There's going to be a big mess if they don't.
---
Yeah sorry I should have mentioned that I am a healer and we will always play together. She won't be soloing. Was more thinking about how complex the actual gameplay is. Since she isn't a gamer she somewhat struggles mechanically just running around more than those of us who are used to it.
---
Mindcontrolling the AoE casters (Battlemages?) and dispelling the early diseases makes a priest the best healer I'd say.
---
pretty sure they are using the modern client which even has directx 12 support. 
---
in the dev video they explained how they took 7.x client and stripped it down but left some improvements like graphics options, etc..
---
You wildin'
---
Real tanks are ret taking the big hits from 99%-98
---
4k 60fps on a 40man raid might be pretty difficult. Questing? You are fine
---
It's kind of funny to think about how little of that world is actually used.
---
They could cut out like 75% of the game, and max level players wouldn't lose anything but transmog runs.
---
It is some retarded subculture formed from twitch
---
Yeah, that's actually my plan. Just get the inferface to be ready for leveling.
---
Only time ive heard of daggers on warriors is for fast rage gen in execute phase since execute only scales with how Much rage you have and not weapon dmg
---
We are going alliance. Good tips for gearing though, thanks!
---
Hunters do scale less than other classes on gear, but it's not a big factor in pvp compared to pve since pvp is about burst and survival, and hunters gear does increase that significantly.
---
Pet is of course a big factor, but just generally their attack rotation has a decent cooldown which limits ap scaling and they have no consistent way of increasing attackspeed which is a huge damage modifier, rogues and warriors has a near 100% uptime of slice'n'dice and flurry.
---
Thorns and fire shield doesnt stack.
---
Nope. You had to put effort and time into it. It's more like congratulating the kid for doing his homework, which isn't a bad idea. 
---
I also congratulate my girlfriend for being on time. She's usually always late.
---
Again it doesn't cost me.
---
But to each their own. Seeya in classic, my friend!
---
Hey man, I've been making a custom route for launch that gets rid of some quests I don't think will be doable at launch, mostly things that require the AH to complete, specifically the quests in the Blasted Lands that require Frost Oil.
---
When trying to add additional quests to compensate for this, I'm finding it impossible to add quest chains... 
---
When adding the quest pickup for the Sweet Amber questline to the westfall step at experience 42.05:  
---
    {  
---
        "coords": { "x": 44, "y": 80 },  
---
        "header": "grimbooze thunderbrew",  
---
        "starts": [["sweet amber", "p1"]],  
---
        "type": "quest"  
---
    },  
---
Importing this crashes immediately once you reach this panel.
---
If I exclude the quest chain step (i.e., exclude the "p1" part and fix the array) it works 100% fine. If I cut and paste a different quest from another part of the file, it works until I change the name of the quest (including the part subtext.)
---
Nope. Remember they are considered two different games.
---
Amen! Its not even a cool or empathic story...its just "So I got divorce but its not a bad thing, now I can play WoW as much as I want! The End."
---
this game just felt like magic. so happy to re-visit it once again.
---
If you are a healer she gonna have a easy time
---
This one? [Mastering the Elements](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=8411)
---
Hunters don't scale as amazingly well as warriors do, but generally they are very solid throughout the whole game both PvP and PvE-wise.
---
Enh is a lost cause in PvE and PvP unless you're going full hardcore (r13 gear + Sulfuras).
---
Yup. I’ve tried to explain this to people before with no luck. The problems arise from being able to offer other players access to resources on your layer that you are not postured to harvest yourself in the first place. When I’m able to invite someone to my layer while I stand in Orgrimmar and give him access to all of the mining nodes on my layer out in Hillsbrad, I lose nothing. I am able to offer access to resources I otherwise would not have had access to either way.
---
But, force me to be near the other player before the player actually changes to my layer: suddenly I *am* positioned to harvest these resources myself. Inviting the other player is a choice to give up my stake to these resources and pass them directly to another player. No more “cost free” resource access. Now all resources player 1 can offer player 2 from his layer, he directly forgoes himself.

&gt; It's not like you have a fucking drop-down menu with layer numbers to choose from.

&gt;  you don't know in which layer you are, and your friends are.

I mean, it's not as simple as that guy claimed, but MN among others demonstrated how to abuse it.
---
You can basically create characters until each one matches a certain layer, and then do some fuckery to access your desired layer on your main.
---
I used it for months on a private server because those swords just weren’t dropping. I think it’s the biggest, most eye catching one hander in the game. It’s almost comically oversized really.

---
It's all part of the fun really, in a casual(ish) guild with the initial excitement of first raid I don't think people mind if it's a little bit of a shit-show.
---
I don't think trash-skipping is really something that'd be happening because of those sweet sweet trash epic drops so as long as the raid stays a good distance behind the tanks and you've got your eyes on patrols it shouldn't matter.
---
Honestly I don’t like the Rag statue very much. It’s probably the muted color palette.
---
Do you want to be thex?
---
every day we stray further away from God's light...
---
Wth is a pauladeen
---
Has any site been set up specifically for classic compatible addons?
---
First time I've ever seen a "This month in Azeroth" video. It really feels like they're trying to milk Classic to promote retail. Classic deserves its own promotion. It's the game that took the world by storm 15 years ago.
---
Weapon speed barely matters for tanking unless you're Rage capped - which is pretty much Vaelastrasz only. I can't really think of a situation where I would pick a weapon with worse stats over another, slower weapon. Maybe Quel'Serrar - Spineshatter, but that's not entirely fair I think.
---
he probably means 6 months /played.
---
and i'm pretty sure pve/pvp gear in classic will never be on par to one another since one is for pvp and the other for pve.

I’m not someone who thinks people should rush to 60, and nothing against those who do, but I think the lowest level I’d be okay with in raids is 58, beyond that I’d rather run without.

That said if other groups wish to take 50-55s then that’s up to them, I don’t want to sound like it can’t be done or shouldn’t. Just not for me.

Classic was designed to be much more of a “team effort”. You aren’t nearly as strong in comparison to to the NPC’s in classic as compared to Retail. So you end up in dungeons and raids a little bit longer and end up really having to cooperate with these people. Small feats in Classic just feel more rewarding and the random people you meet along the way who help you overcome those challenges, sometimes, turn into friends or guild members.
---
In short, yea you’ll meet friends.
---
Id say get over it because reddit is not the golden source of helpful information.
---
That's the one!
---
Is there a summary of class spell differences based on races? Like undead priests having devouring plague (i might be wrong here) while priests from a different race don't.   
---
Just now read somewhere that only horde warlocks have access to succubus? Is that right by the way?
---
To be fair, both of your examples are about positive reinforcement.  :)
---
Don't get me wrong, I am a really friendly guy (unless I have a reason not to be). And I will congratulate on good item drops because they are random and feel more special to me.
---
are you using old.reddit.com?
---
Of course you don’t “need” full MC gear to do BWL, but everybody still wants it and will keep clearing MC weekly. 2-3 items per boss for 40 people means it takes a long time to get enough ToEPs, Rag weapons, Bindings, etc. Nobody will clear MC twice and then stop raiding until BWL releases so the fact that MC is easy will not cost Bliz any subs.
---
I can't wait to build both a blacklist and a list or Horde's who's corpses I've camped.
---
Why are you wasting so much time on being wrong?
---
But why would it be possible to offer a skill spec that doesnt work ?
---
I mean that should at least be overhault, so that every spec is viable.
---
Why do people want to even join these stress-tests? I would only bother if there was some kind of reward when the game officially releases
---
What is the best profession to pair with Eng for a min/maxer? Specifically talking about fury PvE and arms pvp. If I need to tank something, I'm cool with using whatever pieces I pick up along the way. If there aren't any BoP items from BS worth using for Fury or Arms, then I'll do the obvious choice and pair Eng with mining. But if I can squeeze 10 more dps from mining on an alt, I'd do that.
---
The fact that you guys can even consider different classes, makes me so jealous.
---
No matter what class I start on, I always end up on a warrior again. I can't help it.
---
I really want to play either paladin or rogue, but I will only get them to 15-20, before I'm back to warrior again. Happens every damn time
---
Even only looking at Dota and LoL Denmark has far more pros than for instance Sweden, Finland, Russia, and The Philippines.
---
I will report everyone of you to Blizzard for griefing the game. Have fun with the bans \^\^
---
Ooh, the red symbol is poop. 😯 Hard to make out when it's 4mm big lol. Great, that makes sense now.
---
I imagined warriors would be amazing levellers. :x
---
Roflmao waste of time

if you want to minmax, you continue casting instead of writing

If you want every spec viable play BFA

No, you can't trade that item, but to make it you need 8 each of [Thundering Charm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4480/thundering-charm), [Burning Charm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4479/burning-charm), and [Cresting Charm](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4481/cresting-charm), which are tradeable (and worth 50s to 1g each based on historical prices from many servers).
---
This was an interesting read would love to see numbers to go with it, no weapon swap numbers over a 5min peroid compared to weapon swapping.
---
It will be done through the client, you'll have to make your character like you normally do but won't be able to actually enter the game.
---
no but /console spelleffect 10000 ftw?

:D That one's funny as hell, and I think you as a Dane will find it funny. Well, In Swedish S and C is pronounced as S. But it also depends on what comes after. SH and CH are pronounced differently.
---
We speak fast because our language is so superior to yours that we actually can speak that fast and understand each other ;) ;) ;) ;)
---
To ensure everybody has a nice time at launch ?
---
And  this  is why you  reply to  all  the whispers  in kind eventhough you  sold  that item 40 minutes  ago, not for them but as an investment in the future, server rep is huge in vanilla.
---
Yeah that sucks. It'll be hard for you to raid consistently, you could try raid more casually with a guild that also has an alt raid, that way you have 2 chances to make it to raid.
---
If you like your guild and guild mates then loot council isn’t a problem
---
45% reduction is quite a lot, we would need to know if it's a flat 45% reduction in which case quick casting spell with lower coefficient would have a near 0% benefit from +SP/HP or if it's a 45% reduction based on the max-lvl coefficient of the spell.
---
Pretty unlikely.
---
Spell batching was 'abused' the entire iteration of the game by pvpers that knew how the system worked. 
---
They didn't fix it in Classic, they brought it back. They don't really give a shit about balance, they are trying to recreate the game.
---
Wasn't there a way to sub for classic WoW and not BFA at a discounted rate?
---
That is very hard to say. Shamans are definitely no paladins. A paladin could probably clear entire strat without drinking.
---
Didn't seem.to be to me...
---
There's really no need to hurry except 
---
- you play in a hardcore guild that is going for a world-/server first kill. 
---
- you want to kill low levels.
---
Even at the end of Vanilla people did MC and Onyxia with alts or just for fun. And since a lot of people asked the same question as you do, there should be many players to form a raid with when you hit level 60.
---
you prolly started on wrong foot if you had to sign a prenuptial in the first place. Well, good for you i guess?
---
Come for the GUI alone.  DAoC was so spartan.
---
Germany will drop from this list sooner or later. With those hot summers and mild winters we got lul
---
What you’re saying is, hunters now need MORE weapons
---
Yeah I guess so
---
Is this the same client the game uses? I wont be subbing for test or name reservation but I do want to preload
---
In that case: What's your favorite cake?
---
I'm so torn, we are indifferent on which faction to roll so where looking for a little push in the right direction
---
This reminds me of the awkwardness of getting into guilds and/or parties where you have people in the ignore list. The others would ask you to clear the ignored person and you had to choose either do it or leave.
---
I have the basic Macbook Air 11" from 2013-2014 that runs Retail and beta-tested classic fine. Not my main machine, use a 27"iMac for that, but have had zero issues running WoW. But if I'm not home, and need a WoW fix, it works fine.
---
You just have to run on hatred instead of companionship.

There where already 5 man raids to Onyxia.
---
Congratulating on level up is also positive reinforcement. To keep them playing and leveling up even more.
---
But yeah I'm not saying you're not a friendly guy or anything. And congratulating someone on something doesn't mean you're a good or bad person.
---
As I said, I hope we see each other in Classic.
---
For me is to see the models, with ingame portrait so I know what to pick the 13th. And just goof around, might wipe to hogger.
---
I'm very sure someone said [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]

Isn't this private server trash?
---
Gratz, want a medal for knowing how to use youtube?
---
There is a claw that comes out of BWL that is pretty good for fury warriors. Obviously not BiS but it's certainly not a meme.
---
Does that mean we can also use that time UI setup, addons testing etc?
---
Everyone dies alone, no matter how many people you have around you, you will be the only one in your head.
---
I disagree. I think the demand for Classic completely disproves that entire idea.
---
You have lots of 1 button rotations and specs with mediocre gameplay, but its still fun because of the social systems and progression the game is built around.
---
Except in Classic there aren't specific stats for PvE/PvP. Although Classic PvP lacks the same amount of hit%, they're still very much on par, power-wise.
---
Actually the opposite would be gnomes, because they are the race without an own capital.
---
Ehehehehehe, very funny Caper! You know the things we have to say sometimes to get people on our side though. Grease the wheels...
---
so you get one 100damage + your\_spelldamage proc every \~30 seconds (proc on cast or also on tick?), compared to something like +64 spell permantent from claw of cromaggus does not sound too crazy for me...?
---
i think cg on every level is retarded. its fine when you reach 60 or get your first mount
---
Everything you said is true, the problem is people want it to be more serious and competitive than it is and are going to try and force that min/max mentality because they think they are being hardcore and want that image
---
Most tanks running that are going to have a friendly healer who knows how to heal which makes the pulls go faster/more often. Typically 3-5 orbs per run, sometimes more or less. But the prices of each depends on server supply, demand, and inflation. At the very least it should be worth more than just straight fishing or equal to farming herbs and that’s taking into account splitting the orbs.
---
Many guilds simply find other people for the Raidgroup that don't need to be in their guild. Fusion with other Guilds can work out well, but talk about loot-stuff first. Also: As soon as you're 60 you can gear yourself and enter MC for rep aswell. Don't even have to attack any bosses.
---
Fair enough. I will be playing from launch with no major commitments for a month so fully geared lvl 60s won’t be a problem for a while.
---
In response to your ‘Why not?’, I’?ve been hopelessly bad at MMO PvP in the past. I can distinctly remember back in WotLK days as a lvl 80 getting beaten by a lvl 70 in a duel. Yes, I’m THAT bad :p
---
Excellent. We will wait to see how it runs before doing anything drastic.
---
Dude thank you so much for speaking about this, but do you know why it still scales in the datamine? Did it get hotfixed later on, in one of the pre-BC patches you think?
---
if you are having trouble thinking of a name just ask people here
---
You move in a direction while using your excellent toolkit to keep your health topped off, dispel bad stuff, ps buys you space on a short cd, MC buys space at will, I explained how above. Forgot to mention Levitate helping out if you can find a body of water.

As a priest you don’t have “mobility tricks “ (I’m assuming you mean speed buffs for you and debuffs for your opponent with these words) but what you do have are spells that will keep your opponent off you when they close, keep you moving, and keep your health bar full while you are moving.
---
We'll certainly see attempts to try that. 
---
As far as I can remember, there were small groups that tried to defeat Onyxia. If you look at some speedruns on MC, you quickly realize that the groups are split again and again to achieve the speed needed.
---
So it's certainly a challenge that some can't resist.
---
Have you got a 4k screen and an active WoW Sub? I have a 1070 and can run Modern WoW at a mix of Medium/High at 60 in non raid/city environments, and from what I remember the classic beta ran even better.
---
Upvote this or you like retail. Confirmed.

YOU 👏 WILL 👏 GET 👏 A 👏 RAID 👏 SPOT 👏

Wow, thats alot O.o

Interesting points here- I’ve seen this sentiment a lot, not being a PvPer but still needing it for the proper experience. Thanks for taking the time to comment! I’m going Warlock main :)

God, people min/maxing vanilla is the same people min/maxing maplestory 2.... Pathetic. Come play dota IF you actually wanna use your brain and stop pretending
---
I think they said this won't happen. But I think there actually are newer animations in there that weren't in Vanilla. But it's rather basic stuff.
---
2007scape's meme game is on point. /r/DunderMifflin has seen a recent spike in quality, if you're into The Office.
---
C'mon Thex, you're better than than this. People wanna plan out and synchronise with mates. They already have the number of servers they will release and their names, if not now then after the stress test they will.
---
- Thex
---
3pm PDT is 6pm EST.  Which means the 9-5 east coast players will be home or almost home and ready to play on launch.  The difference between a 2pm stress test and 6pm launch is monumental as far as the east coast NA Players are concerned.
---
I know a stoner from Helgeland called Børre.
---
Great points. Thanks for your comment!
---
I think the racials were never a heated discussion. We all know that the racials won't have a relevant impact on the invites. As for classes, I guess the discussion is not if you get a spot, but that some people are better choice.   
---
My opinion, you will get raid spot with anything, but there will be some raids that will exclude you if your spec is not ideal.
---
Sounds hilarious, would want to see.
---
I’m just afraid there will be login queues just to reserve your name..
---
Hunter doesn t have mana issues. Mana pots, dark runes, mana oils are a thing. You should never go OOM.
---
Yes. This is a pre-order.
---
I'm not seeing getting the item in October is a surprise.
---
You shouldn’t be FD-eating anyways. Use r1 multishot, pop pots/runes or just autoshot as a worse case scenario.
---
Everything people say on this sub is just to have an excuse to talk about classic. They’re all excited so they say a thing they heard a youtuber say, or they want to flex their vanilla wow knowledge. None of it matters, none of it is important, and everyone will do fine even if they don’t know anything.
---
Agree with everything you said but you didn't mention having "meme" specs in your raid, just not making a race choice based on min/max. Out of curiosity how many feral/ ret/ boomkin/ spriests/ arms wars did you guys have? I've progressed to AQ on a pserv and our raid group had 1 ret, 1 spriest, 2 arms warriors and not many people were the min/max race for their class and we did fine.
---
I can't wait to look dumb as fuck. I will probably have one set that randomly looks good somewhere from 1-60 and then it will just be garbage.
---
Even though this might look an actual concern: You'll spend some time waiting/flying/autowalking where you can easyly set up everything and eat/poop/sleep nearby. No worries.
---
So did I. And I'm looking forward to meet and help new players that never played Vanilla. That's the nearest I can get to that first time feeling.
---
From what I understand most of the "You won't get a raid spot talk" is aimed towards people who want to play as a Boomkin, Ret Pally, or other non-optimal spec.
---
Sad part is that everything you do comes with a reward. Frankly /u/lolisbae is just too stupid to notice.
---
I prefer Thex memes to this shit
---
The horrors Nessingway has witnessed!!
---
The reason for using a dagger is because even though daggers generate less threat and rage, a miss is less punishing because you’ll still get some rage on the next hit. With a slower one hand weapon a miss takes longer and is more costly.
---
However from a math standpoint it doesn’t really matter. I’d argue a dagger is good for the start of a pull on lots of mobs but I wouldn’t sweat it too much. The only time I’d go daggers is from 50-60 when you get the blue from a Sunken Temple quest line or the epic, I think it’s Alcor’s Sunrazer
---
I can see myself becoming quite a dedicated player in Classic so i’d want to be in a server with likeminded folk. Thanks for the comment!
---
Is the cap forever or does it reset weekly/monthly? iirc it resets every week but then again maybe my memory is totally off
---
Most guild wont care about your race, but your spec will absolutly make it harder to get into guild, especially the better ones.
---
There's no shortage of mages and rogues out there, so why would you bring a boomkin or ret to your raid for dps when you can just easily fill that spot with a class that will do more damage?
---
Does it mean that rets and booms will never get raids spots? Absolutely not!
---
But they WILL get declined a lot more than the meta specs.
---
Never said I could, priest dispels are ficking annoying and everyone knows fighting healing specs are aids up the ass.
---
Btw use uBlock Origin instead of AdBlock, Adblock Plus, or uBlock. They're sellouts and whitelist adds.
---
Seriously, i don't even tell people my age or where i live in WoW most of the time, and people are out here giving their life stories, talking about their dead family members, about their childhood memories playing WoW with their dads or some shit.
---
Or it's some really sad shit too. Like they just got fired and their girlfriend left them and WoW is all they have to live for. Like sorry dude i just come here for some Classic news and a meme or two while i'm pooping, not to get bummed out.
---
&gt;75%
---
Probably even more than that.  If we're talking about max level players we could cut out everything except the current tier of content I'm guessing &gt; 90% of the game could be just destroyed and I wouldn't even notice unless I went for a transmog run.
---
As good as this sounds it also sounds like a massive slippery slope to me so be careful my man.. i'm glad i have some irl responsibilities this time or i just know i would go back to the no life grind and next thing you know months have passed you've rarely left the house your getting fat and it's all down hill for awhile!

---
Yeah, fuck everyone who doesn't play games the way I play them! Fucking losers!
---
&gt; you can not datamine this as it is not handled by the client side.
---
As someone else reminded me elsewhere in this thread, Retail WoW displays coefficients to the player on their own client. Considering that Classic is running off of 7 or 8.x, it wouldn't be impossible that this data would be still available until they take that out of the files.
---
&gt; the files have more than one error. the original files show the succubus seduce cast time as 2seconds when in reality its 1.5.
---
Where are you seeing this? I can't figure out how to read the cast times sheet. At least the coefficients were proven correct throughout the Beta.
---
As far as I've seen/read it only makes sense to hybrid when you can still easyly clear everything. Even though it might be possible on the higher Dungeons, it will just take more time, unnecessary time.. and resources.
---
I've seen reference to 1.12 and 2.0 on this. I guess I'll find out soon enough unless I can find a beta hunter that tested it.
---
They said worst case scenario it would be up for all of phase 1.  Which phase 1 should be relatively short if you look at what phase 2 is.
---
you don't login to a server to reserve so we good

Oh shut up lmao

When you see 720 which means 720p and the icon is thepiratebay, I'm pretty sure it's the torrent.
---
I don t see why you d think that. Polite behavior.
---
Me after getting 99 cooking.
---
I never got chance to try the others tests so I guess I'm just expecting the worst. I know it won't happen or even if it does it won't be for 2 hours haha.
---
Sounds like you've got quite the experiment planned, good luck and have fun.
---
You are 100% correct. The number 1 biggest thing is showing up on time. Being nice and having consumables are a plus but even those can be over looked. People underestimate how many people will want to raid but not be hardcore about it.
---
Funny thing about that one is that the Rogue might actually *want* to get hit here and there just to be able to self-heal for more threat!
---
Well said my dude.
---
I mean you made the point right there—instead of being a game that's popular because of the game itself, it's popular because it's a platform for personalities. BFA just had world first hype, but as you said, beyond that, it's just streamers using it as a background to talk over. I don't think that there's a real need to split WOW and WOW classic streams, either you're watching Classic game play with talking over it or retail game play with talking over it. 
---
There's likely a rivalry between Classic and Retail because retail has been in a nose dive as far as giving people something to support. I don't want to see retail fail, but hopefully Classic gives them some indication that retail isn't as exciting as 15 year old content and their direction for retail isn't on point.

Yes, Thex memes are much more effort.

Get back to work Thex. I read your post history and you are clearly a senior developer for the ue4 release of world of Warcraft 2 - sorry for ruining the first one edition.
---
Besides Sword of Zeal, which is only good as pre-raid bis (bogling root is used if you really have too much time on your hand). None of the rest of those items are used by good rogues, so not sure why you think you are better than the best. 
---
And you still haven’t shown me any items that increase attack speed for rogues. So still what are those crazy builds you’re talking about? 
---
« Whay to throw a tantrum » uhhh... you were the one who starting insulting me for no reason...
---
I enjoyed this Ted Talk.
---
21holy 30 Ret is great for what your after.
---
This is impossible as we all know that private servers were $100% Blizzlike and there were absolutely no flaws or discrepancies.
---
True, but not that hard in trashpacks
---
So far, you and I have been polite.  Are you saying you're argumentative style is a submissive one?
---
This but unironically
---
Even though Classic will be more time-consuming than modern wow, i4 also more rewarding of that time. Things
---
ding
---
If you dont want to sift through retail streamers, then dont scroll to the bottom :)
---
I will definitely play during the stress test, if only to install and configure the add-ons I want. And I hope for an event similar to the beta-end event a few weeks ago. But even if there isn't one, I'm sure I will have a blast. It's Classic after all.
---
&gt; Our highest DPS on some Bosses during BWL was a night elf Hunter.
---
What a fantastic argument.
---
No, because you weren t rude to me. I said it s submission when you re polite to people who insult you.
---
Sure, but these are just extreme examples. I don't think anyone was feeling nostalgic about being able to go back and use Flame Wrath to AoE tank everything, so getting that nerfed would be fine. However, the more eyes we have on obscure procs, the closer we might find ourselves to optimal Ret or Enh specs, or even potentially new builds entirely. And maybe that stuff won't be too insane to get nerfed.
---
&gt;You shouldn’t be FD-eating anyways.
---
That depends entirely on what you're doing. 
---
Hitting a target dummy? No. 
---
Killing a group boss? No. They'll likely die before you mana runs out regardless. 
---
PvP? No, see above. 
---
Killing a raid boss with an LOS mechanic? Yes. Manna biscuits will also help out your healers. 
---
Solo levelling? Yes.
---
Oh no, you have spoiled our secret announcement, I guess we will have to delay WoW2-SFRTFO edition
---
Have I missed out on something? First 15 levels on thursday? For pre-subscribers?
---
Depends on server economy but I wouldn’t sell for less than 20-25g
---
I was rude to you.  I said you have no courtesy.
---
A hogger-raid sounds like a good idea 😄
---
it was the unofficial swe server chosen back then. our guild that formed in the beta chose it for that reason (The Alterac Deviants).
---
Yes, but why I'm wondering why 'stress' would be a related topic in the trends page... Why would the two ('Classic WoW') and 'stress' be linked...? Don't know if anyone has any idea... ^^
---
Why would he bookmark it tho?
---
Wow you still exist? fuck off.
---
how do you reserve a name if you dont login into a realm ?
---
Damn, you creep hard man. Good thing I have more than one name I've cultivated over 15 years.
---
The first one wasn't an open test.
---
The second one was an open test exclusively for NA.
---
I mean, you know all this, but now you got to make a comment saying you got invited to the stresstest, gz i guess.
---
Wondered where you'd been. Glad to have you back.
---
The "hot scene girl on myspace" comparison is deadly accurate LOL
---
For what its worth they sold for around 50-100g on my server back in the day.
---
No just the stress test
---
You don't get to keep these characters it's just a test.  Yeah it's for subs only.
---
This is some extremely petty childish bullshit.
---
It’s 42 degrees over here so we’re stuck inside as well. Been playing apex legend since release in February and I so want to get higher level in this 2nd season but for some unknown reason I’m busy watching YouTube videos about classic.
---
Ohex as in o heck’s they dun took my name
---
Lemme guess. Thex is on that list?
---
I find it hard to argue for a warrior compared to a mage. Mages are very powerful, flexible for pvp if she's ever interested, and come with nice utility. They get a lot of spells, but your damage rotation isn't particularly complex.
---
Give her a bit of guidance on which spells to use and I think she'd be a lot happier.
---
If the stress tests taught anything, it's that you wait in the queue before you get to create your character and pick a name.
---
Claw of the black drake is an absolute steal for any rogues that switch to hemo spec for pvp. There are so many rogues that will pass on anything that's not a sword or a dagger. Also imo it looks super cool.
---
If there's a cap on ignored players still, it's really really high. 
---
Clearly they should reduce the limit back to 100 for Classic. \#NoChanges /s

---
Is this the attitude you are planning to play with in Classic?
---
I think a lot of people are underestimate the effort and pain it takes to get 40 people online at the same time every week. Only the most hardcore guilds can afford bis setups and most optimal combos. The rest of us will gladly take some shadow priests and couple of druids just to hit that 40 player cap.
---
If it's for the recently announced Timewalking Firelands raid or for WoW:Classic. I don't know but i'd imagine its for Timewalking Firelands because i'd find it hard to belive the World of Warcraft category on Twitch is not getting split into two categories once classic releases.
---
Do EU accounts get to login? I just want to sort my UI and addons out.

background music too loud relative to your voice

Transmog runs have become a major part of max level gameplay for the majority of the players I know. They'd definitely notice 😛

Thought I was having a stroke the first time I read this
---
Too late );
---
the thing is that most people are aware now of that gold method and I am sure there market will be flooded with orbs. Back in Vanilla, 90% of players just enjoyed leveling and didnt go "pro" on how to make gold. I was using mana potion on my warrior when I started playing the game, to give you an idea lol. I didnt even cared for enchants or anything.
---
I am pretty sure the groups that run Stratholme for orbs will be 100 times more than what it was in vanilla.
---
At what point did OP mention timelines? Your combativeness is proving his point - not everyone is hardcore and pushing for server firsts. 
---
You can be a casual / semi-casual player, play an off-beat spec \[race\] and still have an opportunity to raid and experience Classic in it's entirety.
---
Playing wow all day is a desaster for mental health. Users in this sub are either in denial or too immature to grasp the concept.
---
Follow up question, why can Druids wear fist weapons when all of them have effects they can't use or set bonuses they can't compete?
---
If you're not a human rogue, having the BWL claw instead of CTS doesn't really matter at all. It's such low difference it wouldn't change a raid boss or a PvP fight. And if you're human, you ask? Same thing, with combat talents for +wep it doesn't matter much.
---
And it looks so much cooler.
---
Thanks! I changed it :)
---
I'm coming from Horde.  Played that faction solely the entire time on retail.  Figured I'd check out the classic fantasy vibe that Alliance has to offer.
---
1000% better to be alone than in a bad relationship. Classic FTW!
---
In my experience 95% are there for their pre-bis, luckily the other 5% can wait another hour for a tank that wants to run Strat, sellers market :P
---
I know it’s a clear /s, but no one in the private server community even says that...
---
You're gonna have trouble finding a raid group
---
Looks promising! Some thoughts:
---
- Possible to allow raid leader / officer add attendant to raid? Having ever raid member do it themselves seems logical.
---
- Exporting data?
---
- Individualy priced items not following your cost rule?
---
No boot device is 90% of the time just a bad hard drive.  RIP to all your documents though, this seems to be the week for this crap as I've had at least two different PC's lose hard drives this week.  If your old drive is also M.2, lookup an M.2 to USB adapter online to go with your new drive.  You can connect your old drive via USB to maybe have a chance to pull important documents off of it.  Paragon Backup and Recovery can sometimes work to pull data off of dead drives, unless it's really dead.
---
Good luck to ye!
---
If you have a blue weapon or a bad MC epic and this drops as rogue or warrior, you have enough weapon to run around with until AQ.
---
It looks cooler and isn't that much different in DPS than other items in Phase 3.
---
Essentially everything has an AoE. You cant have a whole CD raid in greens in MC. Pserver raiding isn't a good representation. 
---
You'd die in 2-3 seconds max to lava packs

Also, if a hunter topped your meters in BWL, then your other DPS-classes are bad at the game.
---
You are in for a suprise my friend.
---
Ah ok, ty for the elaboration
---
Hm maybe you could play in a  different server region so that due to different time zones, you would end up playing during prime time. Not sure how bad the latency will be though.

Try another laptop from stores with good return periods. If you like it, keep it. If when your current laptop is repaired and you decide you like your current laptop, then return the purchased one for a refund.

Wow-capable laptops from AMD chipsets are probably cheapest with best bang for buck. Go for something with a ryzen cpu and vega8 or vega10 integrated graphics. Great balance of battery, performance, and price. Sub-$500 with an ssd and vega8! Check www dot slickdeals dot net for deals.

Thunderfury is not a p1 item.
---
Bro, read the post. 
---
I'm referring to the private server I just played the last 12 months or so.
---
Everyone talks about these perfect raid comps and I remember screaming in chat looking for any warm body to come roll their face on a keyboard.
---
Truestrike Shoulders. Warriors, rogues, and hunters need them. 
---
Most good raid items are "hotly contested". Thunderfury should not be among them though, at most you will have like 2 tanks that you have to choose between.
---
Out obviously fight back. My point was that those classes can generally just take the rogue out with sustained damage.
---
Use the Brave Browser (chrome based), no need for those addons 👍
---
I think it was yeah.

I know this post is a joke, but I wanted to point out that I'm pretty sure they weren't commonly called boomkins until TBC. That was when they actually got strong enough to deserve that name.
---
I know, this is purely speculations about Activision only. and why it isn't in a seperate category.
---
That's kind of my point. The servers are going to be released on the 12th/13th. You have two weeks to coordinate.
---
I do not recomand you any Razer's mouse anymore. Razer Naga first of his name and Molten Core were the best but the new Naga or Hex are not very good..  
---
Top of all, their durability are now very very low. They included a 2 years life and after that, the right click start to not working well. I don't know the shape of your hand but since the first Naga, their mouse are now too big and not comfy at all.  
---
I am using now a Trust mouse (MMO like). Not the best, not the worst.  
---
I think any 12 button's mouse will be better than any Razers now.
---
You'd be level 6 or so after 30 minutes 22 is like 10 hours
---
Congrats. You'll probably be better off without them.
---
I hate your answer, but I appreciate you answering.
---
Basically the Tauren hitbox thing is very strong in PvP, depending on the situation, it will be harder for rogues to deadzone you, and easier for you to play around hunter traps. That said, it's very rare in BGs that it's a straight up 1v1 between you and another player, so I would say it's kind of irrelevant there. All in all, nice, but not stronger than the orc resist.   
---
The hamstring kiting problem seems to stem from a mix of the leeway mechanic, and the Legion mob pathing.   
---
It is possible to hamstring kite, but you will need to be moving very differently than on vanilla classic or private servers.

Here's a video explain how to do it:

40 man ret raids here we come!!!!
---
Not saying you're wrong.. but I barely read anything like that and I'm basically addicted to this sub atm. I think I haven't read once that you don't find a raidspots because of your race. It's exactly the opposite. It seems like everyone agrees except if you want to do world first.
---
The same goes for classes. We seem to agree that a Ret Pally probably won't have an easy time against a Fury Warrior when the choice would be between them. But that they still have a chance to find Raid groups that take them just to get the 40 filled.
---
Wanna change, you get to think about classes so that you almost don't want to play, because you can't decide whats the right one for you. Funnily enough i am thinking of going warrior rn.
---
Looks like the sub is back to normal.
---
I only get annoyed if it's excessive. Like one guild I was in, literally every time anyone got any item, "gz gz gz gz gz gz gz gz gz gz" EVERY FUCKING TIME
---
Even if it was a healer rolling offspec for some garbage weapon that nobody wanted, there'd be a wall of "gz" in the chat window. Like, calm down guys, it's just Earthshaker.
---
i need mana regen, agility, +hit, +AP, +sta, +crit, +spirit, and +spellpower, 2 handers, 1 handers, leather, mail, and cloth.  
---
not my fault your class is 1 dimensional.

---
Not necessarily. One party of the marriage could have been the sole breadwinner, and it’s just dumb to allow someone to leech off you this day and age, regardless if it’s the wife or husband. 
---
Shit can go south too, modern marriages typically don’t last as long as they used to, so it’s just safer for everyone to prenup so no one gets fucked
---
I hope 90% of the players are like you!
---
I really hope the problem is the old m.2 and I dont really have anything stored on it besides wow. I have everything backed up on my main pc.  
---
I will take your advice and buy a m.2 to usb adapter if I have the same problems in the future.  
---
thx for the advice
---
Rogues and warriors, primarily, but I think hunters could equip them, too. Oh and technically shaman could equip mainhand ones.
---
The thing is, there just weren't a lot of fist weapons and many of the ones that were in the game were underwhelming. They were usually pretty fast which made them undesirable as mainhand weapons for most classes, and due to how they were built/animated in Vanilla, they were almost always exclusively mainhand or offhand which meant they didn't have much versatility. 
---
Also, no race had a weapon skill bonus for them, I don't think there were any unarmed +weapon skill items, and I only rogues had a talent that benefited them (but because you were less likely to have two good fist weapons vs. two good daggers or swords, you were often better off with the dagger or sword spec).
---
Lok'tar ogar
---
It worked on the beta - kind of..
---
You need to /sit before the enemy attacks you and at the same time as the attack comes you need to stand back up, the game will think you are sitting for a short period of time triggering a crit, but then it will see that you are standing so the rule that sayd /sit crits don't trigger reckoning won't take affect, so you'll get the reckoning charge anyway.
---
It's a bit tricky to get it to proc every time since the time window you need to time to stand back up is very small, but with some practise it could work out pretty well.
---
Not sure if this is a bug or intended, but that is how it worked on the beta, I think Esfand might have a video showing how it works.
---
Respec, no other real option apart from that.
---
Screw you guys, it's all about Xeht
---
I noticed that too. Am i able to trim things through YouTube you think?
---
I believe Thunderfury Bindings will be available starting with BWL - and they shouldn't really be contested.
---
Personally, I think it's best to give the first Accuria to the MT and give the Quick Strike Rings to DPS. Big ticket weapons (Vis'kag, Brutality Blade) should go to DPS first I think, and get a Quel'Serrar for your tanks in p2. First Ony head to MT for the necklace.
---
Maybe they need test... their stress...
---
Hunter is a king in WPvP, with range and traps (despite beta fix which is kinda rip, no more pretrapping warriors and mages). They can beat most classes, though casters (especially the dot classes) pose a threat **if** they can close in. 
---
PvE wise they’re decent, but fall off around AQ and Naxx. 
---
Forget enh shammy. They’re worthless in PvE and you’ll be probably forced into a healing role. Prepare to get kited or just destroyed by ranged classes in WPvP. Only classes you pose a threat to are warlocks if you can close in (even then they can destroy your totems with pet and fear you and bandage up). Other melee classes are the only somewhat fair match, despite rogue having evasion and warriors/pallies being plate. 
---
TL;DR go hunter.
---
Jesus Christ. That sounds like a long night. For the setup I'd guess Pala, Warrior and Warlock?
---
So excited!!! Stress test next Thursday 11am PDT - Friday 1400 PDT!! Level cap is 15 😊😊😊😊
---
The migration happened during WoTLK :D
---
One priest in the raid needs it - it's one talent point for +1320 spi for your raid (33\*40). I know only some classes really benefit but that's a nice soft regen buff. Priests benefit the most from spirit and most raids will have somewhere between 5-10 priests depending on guild makeup/availability - those specd into holy will get a few points of +healing in addition to the regen buff.
---
This might be the most childish thing I've read all week. You're either a teenager or a man child. Not really sure which.
---
Please let people play how they want.
---
Honestly when I first seen the announcement I seriously considered not playing it but I feel as long as I keep up my exercise (helps me a lot with mental) social life and playing casually I will be good to have some fun!
---
Is (2h) weapon speed really that big of a deal outside of pvp? I know certain things like slam and hamstring kiting are ineffective with a faster weapon, but I mean generally/all-around/pve leveling.
---
I remember rerolling my warrior a couple times to play with friends, and picked the whirlwind sword once. It didn't seem any different to me at the time, but everyone talked insane trash despite normalization already being in place.
---
There have been times where someone with an alt code in their name didn't get invited to my dungeon because their name was too difficult to type.
---
We'd message 1 more for WC and two whispers would come through, the hassle mattered enough to lose that player the spot.
---
We used to invite random hunters along (or alts) just so a sinew didn't go to waste. MC on farm was a tourist attraction.
---
Um, the EU is multiple nations.  So, yeah.  It's international.  
---
Most private servers are hosted in France.  So, it'll be illegal to host them in france, ya.
---
Bro... SHE is the warrior and YOU are the healer?
---
Anyone can get a raid spot in a crap guild that will take 4 hours to clear MC. But honestly who wants to spend 4 hours in MC? It's fine for phase 1 but once BWL comes out you're not gonna want to be spending all day clearing farm content. That's where speedrun guilds come in. If you want a spot in a guild that's gonna clear MC in an hour you're gonna need to put some effort in. That means as a rogue using consumables, bc if you don't there is an army of other rogues who are willing to pop consumables who will take your spot.
---
widepeepoHappy
---
FD/drink doesn't work in raids. It's not that you shouldn't, it's that you literally can't.
---
I was in the top guild in on my server Hellscream US in actual vanilla. We had 6 rogues in our raid, and all were night elfs except one. You'll be fine :)
---
I ran balance during real classic and got 5 bosses deep in Naxx.  Crit-hungry fire mage group LOVED the aura.
---
he submissive lol
---
Replied to wrong comment? I'm not either of both and already corrected myself.
---
yeah, :) also, i've been thinking of a zin-malor dodge rogue tank.
---
I don't know what you mean by 15 seconds cooldown. It was widely reported to proc at a rate of 10%, so if you're casting the fastest spells in the game like Scorch or Moonfire (1.5 second cast), then on average you're hitting one proc every 15 seconds. 
---
Field_1_13_2_30073_008 is indeed the scaling field. Don't know much about Thorns interaction with on-hit stuff, I think there's only 4 items in the game that interact with spell-on-hit chances.
---
hehe :)
---
Yeah, wrong comment, sorry.
---
Agree, that's what I mentioned in the video that 3/3 inner fire were filler points that you could use on improved fort or divine spirit
---
&gt; Claw of the Black Drake
---
I was lucky enough to get this on my first ever BWL run when I joined a raiding guild.
---
personally, i would have mentioned immunitys aswell.
---
when people discuss vanilla, alot of time things like immunitys come up aswell.
---
the regular argument is that those gameplay elements further the sense of realness and it makes sense that a fireelemental is immune to firedamage.
---
the usual counterargument is that 1: a fantasy world is not bound by real world logic and 2: gameplay takes priority and annoying elements should be dismissed.
---
that ties very nicely in your model of world coherency in wow. while both arguments hold some form of truth, the pro immunity side is aware that the coherence of the world is important while the counter side thinks its not important at all.
---
i believe that difference is one of the reason why there is so much misunderstanding between modern wow fans and fans of more oldschool rpg styles.
---
Deep
---
I'm pretty sure that if you FD and your pet is still in combat with a mob you don't go out of combat yourself.
---
Thanks!! Installing now
---
thats actually very encouraging :P Night Elf it will be then!
---
A lot of times when developers give "minimum specifications" they're intentionally overshooting a bit to make sure people who buy the game still gave a good experience, and not just "can barely run the game".
---
It could also be that they ran some raid tests and/or were giving some headroom for addons.
---
Hi Thex,
---
thanks for the shared content.
---
I shad a tear as well. :')
---
Cheers,
---
I mained a Disc PVE priest in WOTLK. I loved that game style, it was so unique, and complimented very well with the other healers. Lots of people thought it was a meme spec, but the theory-crafting behind it was real solid. I will miss penance so much.
---
Based on us playing classic for 2.5 years and experiencing this ourselves during that time you dimwitted motherfucker. 
---
Despite what /r/politics may have taught you, screaming "SOURCE SORUCE" everytime a post doesn't contain a hyperlink isn't a fucking counter-argument to *anything*. Do you think we're all collectively imagining the way raid spots and specs used to be viewed 15 years ago? Must be some fucking coincidence for thousands of people to all have false memories that are near identical, right?
---
A stress test is never about sinking hours and doing progression stuff anyway
---
Can you go somewhere else ? We are trying to have fun here.
---
Recently played on a pserver with same values, was an enhancement shaman there doing 1k+ damage procs with double [Wraith Scythe](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=11920)......
---
&gt;Bg’s won’t be introduced until phase 2
---
Sadly BGs won't be coming until phase 3, so there's even more time to get to grips with the class.
---
You wanna talk?
---
My actual guess is probably wrong but it’s to do with the Activision “Leaks” that may or may not be true. Something that stood out to me was there’s a tension between the Classic/Retail team, not in a hostile way but an implied assumption that which ever version does better will become the “Main” WoW in Activison’s eyes. The Retail team would be the one choosing for Classic to be a hidden tab as an attempt to downplay it. 
---
Just my tin foil hat theory
---
Depends on how results-oriented your guild is. The spec is sub-optimal for dps in raids, sure, but not to the point you will get called out for low numbers.
---
Basically, your idea will work on the 2 polar opposite sides of the spectrum: either in a relaxed casual guild that doesn't check their player's specs or in a uber-hardcore speedrunning guild because that's what they will use for a main tank (see Skarm's youtube channel).
---
However, specifically for tanking dungeons I would ditch Defiance (you don't need it outside of raid tanking),  and some points in DWS. Instead, take Piercing Howl (good for kiting in 'Oh Shit' moments and generally for skipping mob's autoattacks), max Improved Sunder, and get more points in Anticipation and Toughness. Threat might be more valuable than mitigation on average, but not in Phase 1 when you are trying to tank in quest greens and blues.
---
There's a spec for orc warriors who want to be Arms in PvP and tank a little better in PvE than you do with a traditional Arms/Fury build. Technically any race can use it, but for orcs it gives you a whopping 45% stun resistance which is just insane.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxdAio0zVZxbto
---
For PvP, you lose Enrage and Piercing Howl from the fury tree. That's pretty much the only thing you lose that matters. Enrage is a lot worse than people are used to on private servers where triggering it was so easy, so while it's still good, you can totally live without it. In exchange for that you get Last Stand, which is surprisingly good in PvP, and another 15% stun resistance. You'll basically resist half the stuns and grenades thrown at you.
---
For PvE, you get a lot of tanking mileage out of the one point in Improved Shield Block. You only need one point since additional ones simply increase the duration. Shield Block basically guarantees that you block your next attack, and this talent makes it the next two attacks instead. Given the short cooldown of Shield Block, you can block practically all melee attacks from a boss. Blocked attacks can't crit. This is the best single talent point in the Prot tree.
---
The rest of the Prot tree is kind of underwhelming. There's some threat stuff, but the points in Arms go a long way toward compensating for those. Shield Slam is great but you can live without it if you're not literally a guild's main tank, in which case you shouldn't use this spec in the first place. The shield talents and Last Stand are honestly most of what you want.
---
In this spec, you can be more than just another OT in raids. You can just say you're Prot and noone will be able to say otherwise because popping Last Stand is normally how you show you're Prot. Noone's gonna know that you're only 14 points deep in the tree. It's only ever gonna be an issue if you have to MT a boss and the DPS is really pushing the threat limit. Contrary to popular belief, most players never push the limits of anything. The idea that you need to painstakingly maximize TPS is just spreadsheet gaming that most guilds never need.
---
So if you want to be, say, the #3 tank for a guild without having to respec for PvP, this is an awesome spec. You get enough from Prot to be a "real tank" and you get the PvP shit.
---
Must suck
---
Ah yeah... That would make a lot of sense. Stress testing... d'uh...! :o)
---
Hunters in tier 2 do quite well compared to others. Considering getting geared for a hunter in early BWL prog, especially on alliance, is much easier than other classes, I doubt they were terrible players.... Hunters scale well until aq 40.
---
You want to Mana drain a warlock? Lol
---
You just lost the fight ;)
---
Racials sure but if you really think any of the semi-hardcore raiding guilds will let an enhancement shaman take a spot I disagree. Also have no idea how a hunter is doing more DPS overall than everyone else....I would be concerned.
---
Meh running with 4 good people will not cut the run time 4 times shorter so running with dweebs will still be more profitable imo
---
But...but but the game is hard, we need to play it with absolute min-max notions to defeat bosses (sarcasm)
---
Spell ID 20555 isn't a Periodic Heal, it says "Apply Aura: Mod Health Regen %" and "Apply Aura: Allow % of Health Regeneration to Continue in Combat"
---
&gt; I'm doubtful any of this stuff is gonna work on release.
---
Diamond Flask also counts as a Periodic Heal, was confirmed to scale 100% of +Healing in BC, and was patched out immediately. It was datamined to be back at 100% in Classic, as it should be.
---
As a total aside, WSL rules.
---
Idk whether it is an age thing but i completely agree with you man, I watch the odd stream and always turn the chat off.
---
The ones that pay them.
---
esp if you're rolling Shaman
---
Overkill check✅ looks great tho, specs?
---
The grind to 11 took me months and was quite terrible. (I wasn't particularly good). Then my dad pulled the plug so I couldn't continue,lol.  I played 16hours a day.
---
On pservers they established a monopoly and were able to control prices and make stupid money by doing it. They had effectively total control over it since the servers are global, so when NA players were sleeping EU dudes were patrolling and vice versa. The devilsaur leather is a core crafting mat for the BiS gloves and legs of rogues, DPS warriors (two most played classes) and hunters, so there is a very high demand until at least BWL, but the presence of regional servers makes such a thing hard to achieve unless you have people who stay up through the night for the sole purpose of sitting around and killing the mobs whenever they spawn.
---
I will test of my personal Addon is compatible with Classic WoW... I really hope it is.
---
Debuffs use a priority system and Deep Wounds is the lowest priority.  It will not knock off more important things.  You might consider using a Dungeon Tank spec until you have some pre-raid best-in-slot gear and then swapping to Fury/prot for raids.
---
Dungeon Tank:   [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/05002-050501-55200110530221051](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/05002-050501-55200110530221051)

---
Keep in mind that Fury Prot will NOT let you tank raids until you have amazing gear and amazing healers in your raid, but it should be more than enough for 5-man dungeons after you gain some experience in the tanking role.
---
I don't know why people are freaking out over someone else's decision to not take vacation in 6 and a half years.  It's really not that big of a deal for extremely high performance workers.  
---
You say you're a COO, so there's only one of you for hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of other employees.  
---
For everyone else's reference, the people that perform at the highest levels of society (1%, .1%, and .01%) are able to crazy hours without getting the same fatigue others would.  That's why those kinds of people (CEOs) get paid so much.  
---
I commend your dedication to your company and am happy that with all of your work you are looking forward to getting some relaxation with a game you are looking forward to.  I'm trying to improve my ability to perform consistently at a high level and I really admire others that are able to do that.
---
It’s the easy decisions that screw you.
---
I've always thought about how effective an all stealth leveling team would be.  Dungeons would be really easy when you can skip all the trash.
---
only 1 DK? what the hell man
---
Well the thing is he just proved that nobody knew how to play given that a hunter was top DPS

I didnt have beta myself but a friend used the guide to 40 and got 1d18hrs as paladin which is very similar to my repack times.
---
I havent done many full 1-60 runs since I've been constantly changing the guide over and over and a full 1-60 takes a lot of time, so I've mostly done segments like 1-20, 40-50 or 50-55 etc over and over after changes to see the better results every time.
---
I would expect to hit 60 in about 4,5-5d played (as a Paladin) if I get ahead of the pack early and don't run into any big time sinks along the way.
---
Unless your life is already ruined and you looking forward to classic as something that can give you some peace and comfort.
---
Maybe it's because I'm a first-gen Millennial who uses 'no problem' rather than 'you're welcome', but I don't want congratulations for things that aren't difficult.  I never understood when guild chat was all:

*Ding!!! 22*

*Yay!!*
---
*Grats!*
---
*grats*
---
*Grats*
---
*GRATS YOOO*
---
*grats!!!*

*ty ty ty :) :) :)*
---
Nah man, it’s a cool game, but it won’t take you where you need to be and you already know that.  Gotta change that attitude brother, talk to someone, see a doctor, it’s not as hard to fix as you think just gotta be ready to accept help from others.
---
I don’t think boomers will ever see an Ashbringer, they can’t even equip 2-handed swords
---
Don't ruin your game living!
---
You might be better off just reserving your BiS items during phase 1.  Everyone will be needing Orbs for their enchants, so fewer people might be willing to let you take the first one.  Even less if you reserve them all.
---
Unless you're after the balnazzar drops (crown of tyranny and demonshear) and the cannon master boots, a better use of your gold farming time is mob farming with sweeping strikes, fishing, or gathering professions. Unless you're an AH goblin in which case BUY LOW SELL HIGH
---
Did you still use maces after getting it tho
---
I challenge you to find me a nightime weekend raiding guild then.
---
(I'm kidding - kinda).
---
that's why you have put pet passive on your FD macro and then make it re attack once you started drinking.
---
Th... never mind.
---
Yes you can lol. FD puts you out of combat and you can drink immediately after. Yes you will be put back into combat but once a drink is initialized it will continue until you interupt it or take damage.
---
Along the same vein, Blackcrow is technically BiS for Hunter, Rogue, and Warrior. But Hunters should probably go for Carapice Spine Crossbow from Strat instead since it has better damage and is easier to get.
---
This is what I’m saying, strangers are ready to trade their time and energy for you man, people want to see you well.
---
The GM was a priest and loot decisions were decided by a combination of loot points and group decision by the guild leaders.
---
Ah ok thanks. I was wondering if there were specific quest rewards to target (a la Whirlwind Axe). Or from dungeons, although I recall most of the good leveling 2h’s from rolling Enh Shaman in Bc.
---
Well, moonkins earning their boom was a significant moment in wow history. Renaming spellpower to spelldamage was a ~~footnote~~ patchnote.
---
Well I didn't try the bfa content because I couldn't justify buying the expansion but I took my 70 druid I hadn't played since TBC through to legion content. 
---
Questing felt pointless because there was no danger and it seemed like nothing I did mattered. And all the story quests were may as well have been on rails. 
---
Dungeons were horrible because there was no time to actually experience the content, it was just go go go. 
---
And leveling up and getting gear also seemed pointless as all the mobs just scaled with you so you never felt like you were making any progress.
---
Because they don't want multiple categories for the same game? Imagine how fucking cluttered it would be if BfA, Classic, TBC, WotLK, Cata and so on each had their own category.
---
&gt; Druids can't benefit from the many on-hit effects present on these weapons
---
There've been some theorycrafted Melee Moonkin builds revolving around the on-hit effects on some of the higher-level Fist Weapons, so there's a slim possibility we'll see some one-handed Fist Weapon action someday.
---
Lol that was my first "honor" kill, ever, too. Could never figure out how to expunge my record :(
---
Or
---
STV? Why? = must be playing RP server
---
Yes.
---
Day of the Dragon and the Well of Eternity series had me so hyped for Deathwing in Cata...  It was such a disappointment I quit raiding entirely and even quit wow for a couple years and started only playing at the start/end of the expansions with WoD to see what's new
---
happy waiting
---
Thanks for the tip! Finding a 2h will be easier than 2 one-hand for sure (less competition on loot).
---
I try to not have more than 1 Druid in my raid.
---
My guild is accepting all classes, specs, and levels of raid experience :).
---
I love the rogue 100% dodge build
---
It's funny because TF isn't even near BiS for rogues in terms of DPS. It would only be used for the debuff / aoe clearing 5man instances.
---
Undead rogues were so common back then its basically a meme, similar to NE hunters. Human rogues are fine, dont worry about it.
---
Because he's strawmanning? You'd be hard pressed to find any post on this sub that says "if you don't play the best race for your class, you won't get a raid spot." 
---
Maybe, MAYBE, people might say that for alliance priests as the fear ward is actually huge, but most "min/max racials" are just a tiny bit more dps/tps. 
---
What people say all the time, though, is that if you play a meme spec, you will have trouble finding a raid spot. Which is true. OP is arguing against an opinion that no one holds.
---
"Umm, I said 'DING!'"
---
I've read all the books up to the one released for BFA except the one about the giant protodragon. They are all pretty interesting if you enjoy the lore like myself. My personal favorite is the Rise of the Horde book.
---
No.
---
&gt; Show up on time and be respectful
---
Unless you're the absolute "method level" type of progression raider that's truly all you need. Everything below that usually wants warm bodies that don't fuck up.
---
Glad to have you back!
---
&gt; also https://sixtyupgrades.com/ shows how many people in a spec selected each item in their personal BiS list.
---
How?
---
Have not played it but DAoC is back just FYI.
---
Nice!
---
Don't ruin your life not playing!
---
If you were happy with a faction previously, stick to it IMO. You can always visit either faction for the music/scenery. If you want to "do something new", playing a different Class is good enough.
---
Wish they had ray tracing in WoW.  My IMMERSION!!!
---
Warsong Gulch
---
There just isn’t a horde equivalent to the Menethil Harbor docks.  It’s the main port used by alliance connecting the two contents and menethil is contested meaning players are flagged for PvP and ripe for ganking.  The main port for the horde is Tirisfall / Durotar which are both horde zones meaning there is little to no ganking opportunities.
---
There's a slim possibility that some of the chance-on-hit procs from Fist Weps will be exploitable somehow, they were recorded to proc as often as 25-33% chance-on-hit (as opposed to the typical 5% for other weapons). But that's theory stuff.
---
See you in the fields. Victory for Sylvannas.

Basically what you do in case of over-eager healer is you right click the hots and start with several Battle Shouts.

Thunder fury is a P3 item and it usually goes to which of the MT has a higher raid attendance

As a dane who just took a vacation in sweden(and fuck me it was hot), I don't understand a word what you guys say either
---
You will, however, will have hard (more like impossible) time finding raidspot as Ret paladin, Boomkin, Elem shaman etc. What you listed are sensible things that most semi-hardcore guild will look over.
---
Hell yeah. My vanilla guild ran UBRS as  a 15 man over and over to prep for Molten core. Hell some of the gear from UBRS is better than MC gear anyway.
---
You will learn things one step at a time, like we all did, don't worry !
---
I started playing alone when I was 15, no IRL friends. Don't worry, you'll make friends online ;)
---
OP, how many shadow priests have you seen?
---
If only style of writing was better. Some are ok, but majority feels like a work of a teenage writer wannabe.
---
This indeed. I've seen guild run with Ret Paladins and Boomkins just to fill out the DPS spots.     
---
Was it optimal? Nope      
---
Was it fun? Hell yeah!
---
Yeah, people got better at figuring out who's dead weight and who isn't. Good insight.
---
TBH there aren't really any other professions that you can't leverage from just having someone else do it or craft it for you. Personally I would go enchanting so I would have a steady source of income that doesn't require gathering beyond PVE grinding. DEing greens for dusts/essences that you can sell is a good money maker, and getting rare enchants can be a huge gold maker if you get a good rep on your server. Plus you can enchant your own gear without having to find someone to do it for you.
---
This post gave every min/maxer a seizure.

They are like big ol man puppies that just got let out of their cage and they made my bfa raid life a living hell. Listening to the cringe banter made it so tough to swallow that I was interested in the same hobbies that these cringey ass motherfuckers were also into. It caused a lot of self reflection of my hobby choices.

These things are still around?!
---
What's the point of using the ability slam? In what situation would that be better than for example and auto attack or heroic strike?
---
Do a quick run through of my anticipated main, then maybe level an alt for a few levels. Really just chill.
---
Grom gol would be the closest, but its in the middle of a pseudo war zone already with higher average level players, or players looking to PvP already.
---
Alliance is better off campaign the hillsbrad fields. Tbh
---
So spec tank, get good tank gear from endgame dungeons, then spec fury/prot (so i can tank since i will have good tanking gear). Got it! As for raids, i wanna raid as fury but heard you can off tank only on some raid trash not raid bosses of course.
---
Esp if it's a shaman named THEX
---
Gnomes get an unroot
---
Dwarves get an unblind
---
Night Elf gets best Stealth
---
Humans get an unstealth
---
Humans also get +5 sword
---
Well said
---
When you replace a piece of gear it puts the number of users for each piece on the list.
---
Of course you'll get flamed, but it's irrelevant. Cloth Paladins are the best Paladins in Vanilla. You'll run around like a drag queen in any case, if you want to get good stuff.
---
It's not really much of a hint though. Even if internally they had already decided the only futures are vanilla forever or adding TBC they'd still be saying they can't talk about it right now. I do think it's possible they're considering classic+ but this comment is just too purposefully vague to really add anything to the conversation. 
---
I guess to be fair to you plenty of other conversations got started out of nothing. I bet if you made a post saying "Look, the devs couldn't say anything because they decided to shut classic down in 2 years and don't want us to know already." That it would have gotten thousands of upvotes.
---
And your wlfr supported you? I could never imagine mine supporting me and neglecting her. Hell i guess she would leave me.
---
Priest tank and 3 mages.
---
Sure, you don't need to min/max everything to put out good numbers. You do need to play one of the 5 real dps classes, though. You might be able to play a meme spec if you join a shit-tier guild and you farm consumes/wbuffs while everyone else doesn't. That's really the only way I can think of not getting hard carried while playing meme specs. But then you're in a shit-tier guild, so you gotta really want to play your meme to do something like that.
---
Preach it.
---
Don't tell me what to do.
---
No fun allowed
---
Thex IS the list
---
This was not my experience in vanilla at all.  There were always mages and rogues available for DPS slots.
---
Hmm ok, would it also be OK to press need on damage gear(for questing) when I joined the group as the healer?
---
In fairness, in some ways private servers represent what Classic will be better than vanilla. Classic is very much not vanilla. We're getting 1.12 mechanics, talent trees, and pre-raid itemization but starting with MC as top-end content. Class at launch content wise is closer to &lt;pserver that rhyme with Sonos&gt; than it is to Vanilla, what impact the more accurate mob mechanics have remains to be seen.
---
retail bad give upvotes
---
At least it's an upgrade from the dell it all started on 15 years ago! I ONLY GOT 2FPS IN THOSE DAYS
---
WOW was considered a carebear easy game when it released. And for the most part it still is. You don't need a perfect group to do anything in this game, it was designed to be EASY. This isn't EQ we're talking about, here.
---
It doesn't really define the quality of your character tbh
---
Harder as alliance, because orcs stun resist.
---
Nah
---
So I run the game at 1440p using a nVidia RTX2060 and AMD R5-2600 (Keep in mind it's all overclocked).  
---
In Windows my FPS ranges from about 90 up to about 200 depending on where in the world and what in the world I'm doing.
---
 In Linux using the same rig my FPS is about 60-140 (CPU overclock only) in the same scenarios as windows.  However I'm not done optimizing this version as I move from Windows.
---
This might give you a point of reference in what GPU you would want for the client.  Keep in mind though, my limiter here is actually the CPU and it will be even worse in classic than retail due to how it's threaded.
---
I would say that the RTX 2060 in Windows is more than sufficient to pull off the 4k resolution, if not overkill.  However certain battle areas like AV or the 40 man raids will dip lower FPS regardless of your GPU.  This is once again due to CPU threading limitations of classic.
---
yes. classic is easy enough you don't need an optimal raid comp.
---
that has never been in question.
---
what's in question is why should we bring along meme spec if we don't need to?
---
Warrior solo is so shit, warrior in a party with a healer/buff friend, you feel ENABLED. 
---
I remember my old friend refusing to level/play by himself on his warrior so he would wait till I was online with my dwarf paladin. Watching him fuckin crit for like over 1k blew my mind when I was a kid. And with new ways to communicate outside the game (discord) leveling a warrior should not be as bad.
---
I played a pandaren monk for horde which is non existent in classic wow.  I had fun but yeah my lvling route was 1-15 at pandaria (best starting zone) 16-60 at random places like wintersong durotar.
---
Retail Wow has many more players currently than classic will have and too many guilds struggle to even get 20 people for mythic raids. There will be plenty of guilds that take anything just to have warm bodies. Sure they won't be top tier, but most people aren't running for world firsts in an already solved game
---
Because autism
---
I understand most people want/enjoy vanilla, but the honor system could get a rework when (and if) they start developing content for classic in a couple of years.
---
Maybe turn Honor into a currency and sell items for said currency, except for weapon and mount maybe? Meaning that if you have a life, don't cheat and only play 3 hours a day you'll be able to get the best gear after 2 years of grind, instead of never.
---
There must be a different way to punish people who can't play a lot and reward those who can.
---
I know that it was possible on (some) pservers. I pretty much just copied what the other guy posted a couple of comments above :D
---
I thought he must know it because I was sure that it was possible too - but I have been wrong too many times confusing things with private Servers so I tend to believe other People now xD
---
&gt;Gona be real here I suffer from Anxiety and Depression 
---
Yeah, just like half the population nowadays.

Slam is useful if you have a big top end / slow speed 2 hander. Typically these have 3.4-3.8 swing speed (3.4 seconds to 3.8 seconds between white damage auto attacks, which generate rage.) Heroic strike acts like a "on next swing" ability, so it consumes a white hit and adds extra damage to it. It also makes that next attack not generate rage. The way slam works is it replaces your next auto attack with a cast bar that does weapon damage + bonus damage. The cast timer untalented is 1.5 seconds, and it is 1 second if you are 5/5 imp slam in the fury tree. 
---
Basically, if you JUST land a white hit and mortal strike/bloodthirst + whirlwind (both instant attacks) are on cooldown, you hit slam instead of heroic strike because BOTH attacks would consume a white hit and not generate rage, but slam would take 1--1.5 seconds to register damage while a heroic strike would take 3.4--3.8 depending on your weapon.
---
Unregistered preview conversion &lt;3 fraps?

It’s just being decent and loving you your fellow Guildies mate. Your saying leveling to 22 isn’t difficult. What about someone who plays with one arm? Or has kids and a job and very little play time. To them level 22 is a big feat. We say grats to show support and caring no matter how trivial something may be to someone else. Nail on the head with the millennial thing though 👍
---
Nobody cares you weirdos
---
You actually made me think of something.  I played on some pservers recently and due to loading times being MUCH shorter, I rendered over the ocean and got flagged when flying from UC to Org.  Is that something we'll see in classic?  It quite possibly was there but never happened if people had slower loading times.
---
&gt;This might actually be doable now thanks to Classic having overpowered 1.12 itemization right out of the gate. Historically it was hard thanks to how important that extra 3%hit from protection was, but now... Lionheart - 2 Truestrike - 2 Battleborn - 1 Brigham's Girdle - 1 Bloodmail Boots - 1 Blackstone Ring - 1And that's before considering Black Dragonscale or Devilsaur sets.
---
What do you hope is bugged about it? Also it'll take up a lot of your itemization, especially if you're a dwarf or use axes or polearms.
---
LOGITECH G600 is no joke, I hope they keep making this series. I have big hands as well and it fits in them great. The buttons on the side are big enough to not mistake them and they're angled to make it easier to tell which one you're pressing. I actually have my strafing keys there and click down both buttons on top to move. When you get used to that you'll be a master of movement, your left hand will be free for all the spells on your key board.
---
Eh, choosing a class and spec in game is not remotely the same as enjoying a book or show that others hate. WoW is multiplayer, as in your actions affect 39 other people when it comes to raiding. No one has a responsibility to shackle themselves with players that are running suboptimal shit just because they can. You're going to be getting straight up carried in a raid if you go boomkin for example and you shouldn't expect gear to fall to you unless no one else can use it.
---
That's the attitude!
---
Are you trying to jump on the thex train? If so, miserable...
---
Yes I know - thats why I wrote even People that don't know how to Play. 
---
Obviously they were all raiding and (probably) weren't the best when a hunter topped them in DPS. 
---
So it doesn't matter really - up to AQ40 the Raids tend to be very forgiving and you can have 10-30% slackers in your raid
---

Dwarf ret pally inbound!

Alliance Shamans named Thex NEVER get a spot

You know, i am not entirerly sure that it's because of +5swords, but rather because they are, well - humans.
---
true enough. ten years married. not much thex going on anymore.
---
Yeah that work in PvP but in PvE your pet is still on the threat list of the tagged mob so even if you put your pet on passive, the mob will still attack him and you won't be put out of combat.
---
Or maybe I'm totally wrong about this but that's how I remember it.
---
I feel you on that one.
---
I love it, seriously was dreading attendance through the spreadsheet.  I'll try to break it when I get home and give some feedback.
---
So many of you will not clear more than 5-7 bosses in naxx. I am waiting for the trash after twin emps and cthun to break the casuals' collective spirit to raid. You will realize why we want to go fast from the start. Its the only way to prepare for the phase 6 gauntlet.
---
I know I will get downvoted to Oblivion but it's the truth - many, many guilds will fall apart at cthun because all of a sudden, you will finally have to hold your raiders accountable for performance and they won't be ready to deliver after two raid tiers of mediocrity. Keep saying the game isn't hard.
---
Because Slam costs 15 rage, sure MS has less of a +dmg bonus, but you can slam twice for the rage of a single MS. If you can weave slams not not clip your auto attack and the target is not moving and you're not getting much casting pushback, slam is better dmg per rage. Slam can also outperform BT as well when you're not world buffed out.
---
If you can clear with 34 people, then you can just charge 6 people gold for carries
---
For sure a big problem. Had some ax kward ass moments in beta

Really cool screenshot, rank 11's horde-side Lieutenant General title has always been sort of a dream for me.
---
But I do wonder, did Shadowpants ever find a miner generous enough to donate him one copper bar?
---
Who are you shouting at?
---
Just look at Method as examples to keep you grounded to the fact that it's absolutely doable. 
---
They're playing hardcore 14 hour days and still manage to work out and stay in shape, some even to absurd levels of fitness. Playing less and with a more casual mindset should make that a non-issue.
---
I like to follow the mindset of 'sometimes I hate getting up and working out, but what I hate infinitely more is who I become if I don't do it'.
---
I wouldn't roll on cloth in low level dungeons. The items are replaced quickly and an item like robe of arugal will serve a clothie the entire time, while you will wear it for a few dungeons and that's it.
---
Try to pick some intellect/spirit mail or plate when you can, that's good enough to heal levelling dungeons. If a cloth or leather piece drops you find interesting for healing gear, wait for the clothies to roll and only roll need, if they don't need it.
---
Once you get to close to max level +healing gear starts appearing and being the healer in the group, you should get first priority on those items anyway. And that's laso the point, where you start collecting a healing set for raids, so then it's certainly ok to roll on any healing gear regardless of armor type. I'd say sunken temple is the first dungeon where you should do that.
---
PvE in classic will be suprisingly easy because players are so much better. You don't need to be min/maxing raid composition and buffs like you used to. I mean private servers have guilds starting Naxx content after like a month from a fresh launch. 
---
I've always played ret and I don't intend to change because it's not the highest DPS class.
---
Best part was I played Undead so its like I'm the risen undead Menethil that the Naaru brought back.
---
Guess it comes down to the demographic, if the ratio of tanks is the same as in vanilla and every private server it should be no problem, but who knows maybe there is ten thousand extra tanks per region waiting for Classic
---
Is the lack of hamstring kiting confirmed? Did people try this technique in beta and fail due to leeway?
---
Humor tag ? It's reality :D
---
It is an attribute that defines...  Not the sole definitor
---
Doint ruin your lice playing again*
---
yeah me too but don’t want to spend if i don’t have to! i downloaded the sandbox version and it ran...sort of OK on classic settings so hopefully will be the same for full fledged game
---
only need on your current role gear
---
/r/choosingbeggars
---
People are really exaggerating how hard vanilla raid content was. If you have progression raided in BFA, Classic content is going to be a joke. You really don't need to be optimal to clear content.

If you’re the healer of a 5 man dungeon you’re gonna be the only one needing the healing SP items. For the plain SP items these normally go to DPS first as all the healing SP is worthless to them.

Solo leveling warriors will want to hamstring kite- which could be a bit challenging for people unfamiliar with games. 
---
If you're heal-botting her then it will be much less difficult. She can tank hits for additional rage generation and then just heroic strike all the time. 
---
At some point things like sweeping strikes and mortal strike will enter the rotation, but it doesn't get all that complicated if she just face tanks the mobs. 
---
Be sure to keep her weapon up to date and get a whirlwind weapon ASAP after level 30.
---
If you're alive, your life is not ruined.
---
I agree that it is costly but it is definitely cheaper and by a pretty decent amount unless the economy is extremely wonky on that server. At least that is what every paladin I have talked to said and how I personally remember it.
---
Right, I should have included that in there. I did mean to imply level 60 for me and opponents.

Sigh, guess spriest and feral is back on my list of "what should i main" /weep

You're not allowed to post anything about being non-optimal, or playing for non-obsessive amounts of time.  You think people would know this by now.

LUL
---
Hey man, appreciate the feedback. You are probably right, should be boring and now slow persay as they are really consistent. Good catch.
---
Eh, it's cheaper. You have roughly 500g material and pure gold cost for the mount. It's time invested as well, yes. So if you convert that to gold farmed, then it's more around 750g. But I'd rate spending 5h doing a cool class quest as more fun than spending 5h grinding gold.
---
This board has been filled with posts arguing for troll vs ud shadow priest all week. If you are hard pressed I’ll throw up links but all yo need to do is to scroll down.

Master of deception is overrated. Especially if you plan on going engineering, just make goggles. Save yourself a few talent points.

you might be just right Thex
---
Barring extreme server instability, there will be a week one Rag kill, I have zero doubt about it.
---
You're absolutely correct it will be an extreme feat of coordination between 60-80 people, and I can't wait to see it happen.
---
this.  i spent pretty much all my free time as a teen playing games, or reading books.  I was also an air cadet 2 nights a week and would play in golf competitions so it's not like i didn't go outside and do things
---
it maybe hurt my social development a little bit, but not too bad.  it was better than loitering around a park with other kids, doing fuck all
---
now, i'm 29, and i spent the last year and a half having a 'proper' social life - and guess what i'm sick of people asking me to go do things, suggesting fun things to do that cost loads of money, gossipping about people, having awkward encounters... I can't be arsed I'd rather play WoW with my guild full of cool people lol
---
buuuut me and a friend are about to try and start a business so i might not get to play much haha

That sounds good too

Is it OK?  Yes.
---
Will you get flamed?  Yes.
---
Those people are gonna get bored and go back to retail when they realize the challenge in classic is farming gear by raiding consistently for a long time. 
---
It's not that the rotations are hard to execute or that the fights are complex - its that almost every person in the raid needs to have fared up enough FR or SR or NR gear to pass the stat check. The only way to do that is to farm, and farm, and farm. 
---
There was less loot awarded per raid member in 40 mans than in modern 25s. It's gonna take a WHILE to fully gear whole guilds. The hardcore min/maxers will get bored well before Naxx.
---
what's your beef?
---
that is not correct
---
wow this is really well done
---
I know that haha, the option wasn't there.
---
Wasnt it 20?
---
Erm honestly what is the point of doing this?
---
Serious raiding guilds are probably 25% of those clearing content when it is current.  Play your meme spec majority raid team but STFU about getting them buffed when you can't kill rag a year from now.
---
The only cure is exercise and self love(healthy body -&gt; healthy mind, healthy mind -&gt; healthy body). The pills try to trick your mind.
---
And don't forget Redridge and Duskwood being contested leveling zones while Horde are still safely questing within the bosom of the Barrens at those levels.
---
Dude have you played during actual Vanilla? Fury has been dominant all through out.
---
I think because SRG is actually quite a bit more than the top 1% of players, maybe like 15-20%. Also, most of the arguments are for semi serious raiding guilds too, at least when it comes to things like 1 spriest, no pally MT, preferring dwarf priests for fear ward. The semi serious ones have a looser preference but still have the preference.
---
80% of this is sub will be joining pug raids....looking to get in to whatever they can. Wipes will happen. Raids will fail. Raids will succeed. 
---
There really is a lot of delusion around this sub tbh.
---
I was going to ask this, I don't understand it.  So we all select a name before we even know what server we will be playing on?  I've seen people saying they are going to enter their name on many servers to reserve, but that is no longer a thing?  For example, If we have 500k players playing there will be only 1 named 'Tank' in all of classic wow?
---
I haven't played in 10 years I don't know how things work anymore.
---
Or both and then you're really invisible
---
Sounds completely pointless. Why not just do both on one? PvE gear is going to be best for pvp in your situation anyway.
---
Great work this would be very useful for new players.
---
Whoa there OP. Can't be saying logical stuff like that. The dipshit hive mind here will REEEE themselves into hysterics and attack you for saying that you can play what you want.
---
I altered it somewhat in the guide now to emphasize the cost more. Thanks for the feedback!

The main two reasons to pick a class/race combo is mix/max or fantasy and they are both valid, but there is no boost to level 60 easy peasy reroll option, telling people that they need to pick their class and race with care is not a joke it's a warning that you might waste 200 hours if you end up wanting to reroll.

Hey, if you're willing to spend 16 hours a week raiding in the environment he described, more power to ya
---
I’ll try to use that with my guild asap, seems pretty awesome!
---
I think you're looking at this the wrong way. It would be *great* to have an offtank with this fury/prot spec. There's going to be times the raid will need a dps warrior to offtank, and you're not only excited to do it, but spec'd in a way that makes it easier. Most fury warriors do not want to put on a shield. 
---
I think having a spec like this (and being willing to tank) is an asset for most non-hardcore guilds. Just have to make sure you're not dropping too far behind in damage (which you shouldn't be).
---
except for the part that colluding with the enemy faction is a bannable offense according to blizzard, it will be really funny seeing pserver kiddies/ching chong boters crying on the forum
---
you must be able to farm more gold//hour seperately as 6-10 people than waiting for the leather?
---
I suppose on pservers people could have an easy second account to stand around the devilsaurs, but in Classic it would require to either have another subscription, accountshare, or not farm with your account in favor of standing around.
---
I personally would still contest putting ret pally at an 8 in terms of WPvP, and 7 is overrating enh shams. I think rets should be put at a 7 and enh rating should be a 6 or 5.5.
---
takes way way way longer to level up and gear up a second character than it does to just pay for all the respecs, and you won't be able to use all the raid gear for pvp or all the pvp gear for raiding.

Pre-nup is just a good idea even if everything is sunshine and rainbows.

HA HA HA HA HA.

Yea never in my life seen a raid fsil to launch due to lack of dps.
---
And I led midnight, suicide kings, iron forge chat pug raids on ZG and MC
---
Op is pissing on his own face and bitcbing about the rain.
---
No one said it would be impossible to raid. 
---
Any mouth breathing keyboard turner will see MC if they really want.
---
They wont get in *good* raids.   Ones that farm their gear in a few hours each week and dono waste 40gold and 4 hours every night wiping.
---
Has your marriage been that terrible, to have you so excited for smth mundane as playing time? I mean, I dont know and dont judge, but Im curious if you dont mind
---
If you step into Naxx, you're not exactly a casual player though. AQ40 has a high barrier to entry for sure, but mechanically it's not that complex.
---
Exactly. Seems that if you want to simulate server stress you should aim for peak gaming hours.
---
I’ll Lok’tar Ogar to that!
---
„Guys pls“ I found the orc who wants to be anduin
---
&gt; Obviously, it depends on the comb as you want to have some other classes to make up for the lack of damage but their utility is extraordinary
---
There is very little lack of dmg when levelling. We are talking about 85-95% dps of a pure dps class. Don't correlate naxx dps logs with levelling. Especially if the ret has a strong up to date (eg verigans at low lvl 20s or an uldaman drop in mid 40s), they can also be top dps in the group. You only get into trouble, when your weapon is heavily outdated, which does happen (eg the uldaman weapons need lvl 44 and you can basically use them till 60, there's no real upgrade till then).
---
 
---
Another thing I noticed: Enhancement a 7 in raids? Where does that come from? elemental is much better and is rated 5.5 (which is fitting, as ret pala is a 6 and ret is better than ele)
---
Idk if fan bearings will ever be made to work for as long as the GPU
---
My 1080ti started to sound like a helicopter after like 2 weeks and I'm too lazy (and scared to fuck up my custom loop lol) to remove the GPU and fix it manually
---
I rolled an affliction warlock and no one ever told me about the 15 debuff limit in my raid group. Still cleared most of AQ before Naxx collapsed our guild.
---

i made a comment in here, its pretty long but i dont wanna copy and paste it again and spam
---
Yea I cannot agree with you more - You have all these people who never played Vanilla WoW and joined up in Cata or some shit, who think you need to min/max the Vanilla content.   
---
In PvP there are a few Iwin specs out there, that is for sure. But in raiding, people need to play a class they enjoy and play it how it is comfortable for those long ass fights.
---
Was going to post this exact thing. 
---
 If just looking at what exercise does for mental health it's basically an antidepressant in every sense of the word. Best medicine there is and something people working in the mental health field should make a huge effort to encourage their patients to start with.
---
This makes considerably more money due to the fact these are huge cartels, and they can control the prices of leather on AH due to the monopoly they have over it. Idk exactly how it works but if you’re involved you do make a hefty amount of gold.
---
If you want to not constantly respec go daggers. Also, try and get MC daggers before going hard in the PvP scene.
---
You do not want to play with people who force u into optimal roles. They are mechanically bad at the game so they need every ounce of help they can get. They are also ragey will blame others for their short comings and generally make low wages while knowing everything. Me I can go soraka adc and still win.
---
How long we talking in terms of hours played for solo and with a premade?
---
Warriors are hard carries. They suck for a long time until they are finally good, and then a month later they are insane.
---
Yeah, what he said: a vendor.
---
who cares, today potatos are more expensive then gigabytes
---
Ahh yeah probably, hehe.
---
On the bnet client, the left side bar should have buttons for various blizzard games. Highlight world of warcraft. Then near the bottom there is a smaller box that is actually a drop down menu that when you click it, it let's you choose "classic wow". Check closely, it is definitely there. Just not obvious. I installed last night.
---
I'm assuming they will release the server list and we'll be going through the full character creation on our chosen server. We just won't be able to load into the world.
---
On second read through, i cannot even find the quote you were referring to. Can you help me out a bit?
---
Rude.
---
You know what, it probably isn’t. Shiiiiiiit
---
at low gear levels, your best bet for pvp is hemo and combat for pve. It sucks, I know, but you'll learn to deal with it. Once you get better gear, you can go with a SF build that will work for both.
---
For healing I’d just be considerate of the item. A lot of those dungeon cloth pieces can carry one of the clothies for 10-20 levels where an upgrade may show up for you in 5 or less. If it’s +healing which will be a rare piece then take it if you’re healing that dungeon. Overall though, gear from levels 1-55 really doesn’t matter all that much. 
---
So it’s not a huge deal to most just explain why you need something. It definitely was extremely annoying at times running with that stereotypical loot whore hybrid (whom was typically a paladin to be quite honest). They would request to roll need on the dungeons best cloth piece for healing. Then they’d swear they need some shield for their tank set. Then they’d swear they need some really good two handed off Herod later in the same run because they’re “main spec is ret”. Half the time you’d wonder if they truly used all this shit or just had enchanting as a profession. And people would be sort of wary of these people for groups just knowing that they have a reason to need virtually everything in the dungeon except wands.
---
so edgy
---
Well what does it matter what type of player you are stepping into naxx. Day after day this same shitpost appears at the top of this sub, meme spec/race okay, raiding isn't hard, I'm just telling you all - have fun being 5/9 aq40 3/15 naxx until classic is over. Even those figures might be a stretch for the average casual NA guild
---
That's weird.
---
If so powerful you are, why run?
---
I think you misspelled it... it's called ***oomkin*** and is a very rare beast. Some say it is an actual player, only with a chicken head. I doubt you will ever find 7 specimen at the same realm.
---
yeah I know that classic bot, but I decided to implement the feature because the cropping in that bot was weird and the classic bot doesn't support multiple result searches (it just picks the first result).
---
SURE. i mean they can always use extra resto druids sitting on the bench.
---
I like how, like a metaphor for the angst I keep bottled up within me, this document is also compressed.
---
Does that mean you also can't trinket swap on classic?
---
Race doesn’t really matter.
---
Spec absolutely does matter.
---
Nah that was the leaked cap, 15 is official
---
It's always very hard to tell these things. The more hours you play weekly the less weeks it takes, but getting rank 10 with something like 20 hours weekly for 2 months should be sufficient. As for premade group well phase 2 wont have BG's so you rank by killing people in the world. But doing phase 3 and further it is definitely easier to have a premade(and imo more fun) premade makes things about 50 to a 100% faster.
---
Account Sharing, thats how we did it. Unless they add the 2.3 banking system it is what we will be forced to do again.
---
I wasted hours last stress test and couldn’t get past the login screen, not making that mistake again.
---
Only in the form of suggestions at the moment.
---
How To Be A Petty Brat.101
---
It does indeed, maybe you could implement that hook of the image, and change the current !item to !search or something for when people aren't sure of the name?
---
Every server was different, I didn't have nearly as hard of a time as some of the people here are suggesting.
---
I got a character to rank 9 and one to rank 7 playing fairly casually.  But that was with really bad queue times and before battlegroups were implemented.  
---
When I started my big push I played anywhere from 2-5 hours a night and got more than a full PvP rank every week till 10.  It went something like 5-7 in a week, 7-8.5 in a week, 8.5-9.5 in a week, 9.5-10.25 in a week, and then 2 weeks from there to rank 11.  Solo queueing till 10, then I got in the main PvP group on my server for the last bit.
---
I was on a smaller server, and closer to the end of vanilla, but still, not nearly the time commitment that some people here experienced.  But even then, after rank 11 things were much tougher.  We had a couple rank 14s in my group, and I don't know how much they played, but I would guess around 18 hours a day.  
---
My plan is to stop at 10 for any characters I make the grind with, that is when the curve starts to get really steep.  I anticipate the first 6 months or so after the honor system is turned on to be pretty crazy, but eventually the initial wave will die down and the honor amounts will get a little more reasonable for pre-12 ranks.
---
just do it!
---
Yes, I'm also talking dungeons. A ret paladin does do comparable dps to the other classes in dungeons. Rets dps problem are gear related. While levelling your stats don't matter so much, your baseline does and rets baseline is very good, as long as the weapon is good. But ret scales much worse than pure dps with gear, that's when they fall behind and that's not a factor before raids. Yes, when you run dungeons in bwl gear, the ret will be worse, but in questing greens? The gap is quite small.
---
&gt; I might have gotten carried away by the possible usefulness their kit and the nightfall axe. I am not sure I agree that ele are better though, unless it is in the context of them off-healing.
---
Well, if you include nightfall, you should bump up rets raid rating too. Rets are better nightfall users than enhancement. With nightfall, yes enhance beats ele. But you don't mention the weapon at all in the guide.
---
Regarding dps, I can only go by the numbers I've seen and that's ~750 dps for ele and ~450 dps for enhancement on patchwerk. The sample sizes are very small, but that's a big gap. (For comparison, AP ret gets ~800 and spelladin ret ~1000)
---
Yeah, I have just read on other threads that it may be an EU issue but that it has been fixed. I'll check once I get home tonight.
---
Cool story man, especially liked that bit about what 2 of your buddies did in WotLK in arena. Really good stuff. Whelp, see ya later.
---
“On par with pure damage dealers”
---
::strong doubt::
---
this looks really easy to use, nice!
---
TF was amazingly overpowered for Rogues when it was originally released, but then it went through several changes from patch to patch to bring it to a more reasonable level. If you google Thunderfury Research and Testing, you’ll find a very in-depth article that explains the various changes it received, both announced and unannounced.
---
I got my first of two Bindings in Patch 1.8 (after the first nerf to TF) but didn’t actually receive the sword until Patch 1.9 (after the second nerf). Despite having a twice nerfed weapon, I still did amazingly well with it (as you can see in the 3/5/06 screenshots).
---
What about half-dings, and quarter-dings? I need people to know I filled up 5 bubbles on my xp bar!
---
PvPing 20 hours per week for 2 months? Ouch, I don't think rank 10 is for me.
---
I don’t even know who you’re arguing with because at this point I’ve seen way more posts like this than I have people saying the opposite
---
&gt; Fill in gaps with consumables
---
Those consumables will cost you more than respecs.
---
A rogue with proper pvp spec can get by without consumes and be one of the best 1v1 classes with consumes.
---
imo about 15-20 hours premade and 25-30 solo weekly for 2 months. But it's so hard to say because it depends how tryhard your server is and when you are ranking.
---
If you check the at war button neutral mobs turn orange and you can fight them
---
I swear I commented on this exact same question like a month ago.
---
Check the search bar.
---
If you don't know or can't decide what race to pick, you might as well pick the one with the strongest synergy with your class. There are a lot of situations where it makes sense to pick the strongest combo, unless you are heavily into the fantasy/roleplay aspect of wow there is no reason to pick the weak combo.
---
Orc rogue &gt; undead rogue for PVP. Every class can stun you but only three will fear you. However gnome/dwarf are at least on a par with undead for PVP and probably orc as well, so you'll be fine. I'd struggle to decide which race to play if I was alliance.
---
or how about no changes?
---
Legality is questionable but I still got to listen to a bunch of halo and GoT audiobooks on YouTube
---
Question regarding class!
---
I know this is repetitive for this sub, but I was planning on rolling warrior for Classic. Now I’m not sure I’ll have the time to put into leveling and gearing a warrior. Lately I’ve been thinking shaman would be better to play, I’ve never really played shaman so it would be new. Any advice is greatly appreciated!
---
Noted. That's a very attractive alternative. I guess I just don't like relying on Cooldowns, especially a 10 minute in order to win a single fight. I mean the class seems to be fairly reliant on big cooldowns in general so I guess it makes sense... I just wanted to minimize the use of cooldowns by maximizing poison activation, damage, and especially combo point buildup. Is SF in general just bad for pvp or something?
---
What quote do you mean? The feral druid one? It's the 2nd sentence of the first paragraph under feral druid.
---
I've given ret a well deserved buff in the article. As for ench vs ele, the truth is I am not experienced enough in vanilla rating to be certain but I know elemental shamans have major mana issues and while I am sure they can do more dps over a short period I think enh will take over in longer fights.
---
&gt;	classes without stun aren’t worried about the stun resist racial
---
I played a hunter from launch to tbc. We would totally fd drink all the time.
---
Great. Finally EU gets to play along. 
---
11 PDT converted to Central European Time is 20:00 btw.
---
If you have the gear, skill and willing to pop consumes for every fight, than just about anything will work.
---
A proper pvp spec will work far better for your average player.
---
I would expect lowlvl healer paladins to roll both on Cloth Int/Spirit gear and the big 2H weapons alike. Same as the tank who will roll on both 1H and 2H weapons. Lowlvl means everyone is primarily concerned with leveling, so gear helpful to leveling is needed by everyone.
---
It wasnt always a smart heal.  That was the fix.
---
Thex, Thox, Thux, Thax, Thix.
---
The multibox gang.
---
Well it depends. You can start off easy and only do 20 hours for the last couple weeks. It's really impossible to say these things. Play pvp for fun and see how it takes you, then make a plan.
---
R10 is not hard. You don’t need a group and you can get there by playing a couple hours a day for 6-7 weeks.
---
R11 and beyond is what requires a stupid amount of time and grinding.
---
Pretty sure you can do it with less, and only do ~20hrs the last few weeks.
---
box?
---
We are talking levelling and dungeons. Rets baseline is good and gear is barely relevant when leveling. The gap is very small then. Once people get better gear, it starts to open up, because ret doesn't scale as well as pure dps classes.
---
Formula 1 baby
---
pew pew laser panda. you are welcome.
---
Yeah this seem awfully biased towards Taurens since all of the people commenting have no stuns in their kit..
---
Can’t downloaded to many so fresh cd’s from limewire.
---
That's just sad bro. Youd rather spend real money and waste real time leveling two of the same class on two separate accounts to avoid spending 50g for a respec. Mate get a grip
---
I play a Troll mace rogue. Empyrean Demolisher, as well as exalted with Thorium Brotherhood to craft an Ebon Hand, are my goals. Thanks for sharing your story! You seem like a worthy rival!
---
Yes so you need to do it right after an auto attack.
---
I'm a PvP main so yes I would b respeccing alot
---
Idk why the downvotes are coming down on you.  I hear what you're saying.  If they dont want to play then that might just be how it is.
---
You can invite them over to play your account for a while and see if they like it, but they'll most likely be playing solo at that point.
---
Do a dungeon and have them watch?
---
I've noticed this trend alot, the hardcore players playing the classes that don't require it, and the "casual" players wanting to play the more hardcore classes. This is exactly what I plan to do too, got other stuff to do, still want to play a warrior. You're a good friend :)
---
Shaman has multiple builds that are viable for PvE and pvp without respeccing. The amount of time you are investing for the payoff is nowhere near worth it
---
Yes, exactly. Still noteworthy to point out: If you are aiming for server firsts and if you want to join one of the best guilds, you should definitely pick the optimal race/class combo and min-max almost everything.
---
LoveMeThexi is a great guild name too.
---
Meh orc stun resist is annoying but I like to sit on the second level of the drag in org and gank non suspecting commuters. After a while you'll get a bunch of people looking for you but you're a rogue so you dont give a fuck. You just run to a random corner all stealthed out. So maybe you decide to find a different spot or kill a guard because why not.  
---
I've also fallen in love with sitting outside the dm west entrance and ganking chinese farmers who reset instances.
---
Sons of Thex
---
No, multiboxing is perfectly allowed but botting is not. Look it up
---
2-3 nights won't be enough time to do naxx and AQ progression in a casual guild. I know this from personal experience. We would do BWL and MC in one night and dedicate two whole raid days to progress but this wasn't enough. Often naxx takes two nights on its own. If your guild isn't in a position to skip MC/BWL gearwise it's very easy to run out of time for the content.
---
 If you joined as a healer you only roll need on healing gear. If damage gear drops which you want for questing you check if any melee players is needing on the item. If they didn't you ask if you can need on it.
---
 Also if you want to be greedy so needing even if a melee is needing you simply state before joining a group "I can heal but I will need if boss x drop item y". You are going to get less invites but some groups might take you up on it anyways if they have trouble finding a healer.
---
Would 2 pts in Deflection be better than 2 pts in Imp Heroic Strike for someone who wants to tank dungeons and raid DPS (17/34/0)? 2% parry seems better than 2 less rage on HS. More parry = more revenges in dungeons, and I shouldn't be using HS much there.
---
awesome thank you. i dont mind going slow!
---
In most testing environments you don't work a standard 9-5. If a test needs to be conducted early morning or afternoon/evening, you shift schedules to accommodate. Whether more people are at work is irrelevant: they'd have the people if they are conducting the test.
---
Not recommend since only one can be named Thex
---
ok great thank you for the info. I dont mind going slow. I like crafting more than leveling anyways :)
---
You're right. But the people saying this stuff are just hardcore newbies who played during classic but haven't played since. Classic is way easier than retail by comparison when it comes to raiding. Min-Maxing was only somewhat necessary back in the day because your raid would be full of carries. You're talking like 1 good players for like every 3 carries. The reason for this was because of the following.
---
1. Bad PC's
---
2. Bad Internet
---
3. Little Experience with gaming. Half your raid was probably clickers and keyboard turners.
---
Gaming has changed a lot since then. Min-Maxing is completely unnecessary for classic.
---
&gt;Obviously, it depends on the comb as you want to have some other classes to make up for the lack of damage but their utility is extraordinary
---
Even when ctrl+F checking I cannot find it. You might have an old version of the article in your browser if you watched it yesterday, have updated it a lot :-)
---
Oh, well that's better then, from the look of the screenshots it looked like just a list of matching named items and nothing else.
---
Ideal then.
---
You can also use demo shout, and always save your taunt until something actually run away from you.
---
Hellscream was right....

Are usoboxer or hotkeynet legal as far as tos goes? If so yeah probably otherwise it’s a lot of alt tabbing for me :’)
---
yeah as athena already said, it returns the picture of the tooltip. Unless you mean if you type a broad searchterm that will most likely result in multiple results, but you want the first result to be returned. Then, just use !item 1 searchterm, e.g. !item 1 sulfuras will return Band of Sulfuras immediately.
---
You’re a role model to me. I envy you. All hail
---
Hope ur on eu servers. Finally the segregation from eu begins. "Mate"
---
Consider it as a high cost alternative to heroic strike or cleave. If you need a rage sink and can't execute, it's marginally worth it to slam into your rotation. Talentless slam can hit twice and a bit in the space of a long autoattack. Talented Slam can hit almost 4 times in the space of a long autoattack. Slamming resets your AA timer, so it is only ever marginally worth it when taken immediately after hitting.
---
Scenario 1: Hit, Heroic strike. You've gotten rage from 1 autoattack and the extra damage from heroic strike.
---
Scenario 2: Hit, Hit. You've gotten rage from 2 autoattacks and no extra damage. This is the best situation to be in if you have something good to use the rage for that does not prevent you form autoattacking. Like Mortal Strike or Whirlwind.
---
Scenario 3: Hit, Slam Slam. This can be considered equivalent to scenario 1, except it takes 15 more rage and deals damage equivalent to fitting in an extra autoattack. If you have the rage for it, and don't need it for something else, this is better than heroic striking. It may also be better than cleave, depending.
---
If you can only make 1 slam, or if you can take a mortal strike instead, it is never a good idea to use slam.
---
Good post, lots of truth here
---
Unless the bot ran on a server with access to a database.
---
Eh ppl will always disagree but what can I say. I was there.
---
That's not pettiness. That's doing your duty of making sure that the community polices itself.
---
Yep, that's much better functionality.
---
You are scum. Doesn't matter if the tos allows multinoxing or not.
---
No real need to. I understand that my plan is not against the tos. I was thinking about yours.
---
U clearly don't play vanilla shaman. It's either ele/resto or resto for pvp
---
Ahh this post brings back memories. 
---
05 06,
---
Such a group has no solution to when random allies join up with them and start leaching the honor
---
Probably no description on where he acquired such a beauty.
---
If only there were some sort of function built into Reddit that allowed you to quickly find posts asking similar questions.
---
Or maybe some kind of engine that allowed you to search the internet for news and updates on things that interest you.
---
Leave and go to another zone? 
---
Solution :D
---
Also I'm sorry ur broke.
---
Just checked on youtube, looked like some interesting videos. Thanks for the suggestion might listen to a video or two later.
---
Ah, didn't know that.. thanks! Do you happen to have a source for that? Can't seem to find it anywhere
---
The shouts generate very low amounts of  threat and are not reliable. I've always found an initial Thunder Clap the most helpful in keeping aggro until you manage to tab target through all the mobs and sunder them.
---
The point system seems to be far more subjective than objective; I mean Spriest has a 7 for raiding while Warlock is at 7.5?
---
It’s called practice.
---
Multibox programs are allowed as long as you don't do certain things.
---
I'm not certain what they are, but I think you are only allowed to take the keys you are pressing on the keyboard, and send one copy of them to every box.
---
I was a GM for a server first raid guild in Vanilla. We weren't even close to the world first level. But for our server we were first from MC-about halfway through Naxx when everything fell apart.
---
I don't remember us ever telling anyone besides some tanks, priests and paladins what spec to run. Everyone else just ran wtf they wanted.
---
&gt;Will be at the same time as the name creation.
---
That's an assumption
---
That may be why it doesn’t appear for you.
---
There needs to be a method to check the attendee's rank in discord and determine if that person is a "core" member or an initiate. If initiate, then classify them as an alternate.
---
Don't let your dreams be dreams, Fr13d_P0t4t0.
---
u/LiterallyABlackBear could be our GM... with great power comes -

I only play ele/resto.
---
Spreading this type of well-meaning but completely ignorant advice can only be harmful. You are very much free to believe in what you want to believe in, but don't try to present it as factual. Meditation works for you and many other people. But contrary to what you believe, having imbalances in brain chemistry is a real thing. Many years of scientific study tell me that it is not, in fact, a poor connection to the divine.   
---
OP stated that through hard work, medication, and talking to a professional, they made it out of one of the worst places in their life and your first thought is to tell them how wrong their approach is? Just.... wow
---
What do you not understand...I’m saying you can go talent builds that allow you to perform sufficiently both in pvp and PvE. You don’t have to swap talents every time.
---
&gt;Activision “Leaks”
---
Do you have a link to anything regarding this? Not saying you're wrong, I just want to read the leaks for myself.
---
rank 11 only requires like 4-6 hours of play, but you need a good group who wins BG's frequently.
---
I am *WEAK* right now. The comment above this was deleted, and a mod message showing so, and your response of 'Thanks cunt' just chills here untouched. That's hysterically funny to me.
---
I love how in Chat almost everybody is looking for some help. Classic will be so good
---
Yes. Practice how you’re gonna play.
---
No, you're being dense.  Everyone is telling you the same thing.  The respec cost isn't worth it.  In fact, if anything level a mage/hunter separately and farm gold instead.  It would be faster and make more sense.
---
I'll pass on that name. Mine is much more big dick.
---
Fair enough - play the game how you want. I just ask that you understand that the majority of the player base will not be this way. It looks like you recognize that though :). Min-maxers that are helpful and friendly are equally a boon to the community as they are rare.
---
It was like the most watched thing on twitch last week I think (albeit during a world first race)
---
PvE is for people who play 2h a week and use the mouse to press abilities. Go PvP.
---
During leveling, Slam is awesome to supercharge your Hamstring-kiting. Instead of trading 1:1 hits every, say, 3.5 seconds, you can trade 2:2 hits every 5 seconds, which is a significant DPS up, even if you won't hit it perfectly every time.
---
In raids, you'd want to pool Rage and dump it in between BT/WW by chain-casting Slam.
---
Since Slam resets your melee swing timer, you can't 'weave' it in between auto attacks like what hunters do. Casting it right after an auto attack will still increase overall DPS though.
---
I’m actually with him and I raided a ton in Vanilla. It seems often we have people who preach two extremes instead of right in the middle like how a lot of raiding guilds were. You did some of the stuff he mentioned a few times and you likely wouldn’t be coming to raids very long in the guilds I was in. It wasn’t ever a bring consumables or get kicked but if you were an active detriment to the guild you didn’t deserve the spot. And honestly if you get into one of the top 5 or 6 guilds on the server (even if you are the top guild on the server it doesn’t mean you are competing worldwide) filling a raid isn’t usually the problem that people claim. I raided through AQ40 and we were never had issues filling a raid. Maybe we were lucky but again I think it’s more of the average, instead of everyone assuming it’s going to be the hardest thing in the world to get 40 people together.
---
I've had it in the first drop down for a few months now.
---
Not even close. Some will stay open with classic launch. The one I play on is moving to tbc. I’ll be in classic though.
---
And that's why you respec.
---
Rogue with standard pvp spec can farm 50-60g per hour from BRD pickpocket runs, so it's not like money is that much of an issues for them
---
Out of curiosity, is it against the tos for a guildbank to run off with everyone's stuff?
---
I was wondering if the amount of agility you need per point of dodge / crit is lower for a lvl 1 warrior than a lvl 60.
---
Same thing for AP. I feel like the 14 pts/dps might be constant while the dodge and crit are substantially lower.
---
This might make agility a much better stat for leveling than Str.
---
attendance recording, no. admin can edit, add, remove users. At this time the event closes for all edits when the set time is reached (minus the deadline set), so for example if deadline is set to 24 then the event will close for signups 24 hours before the raids set time.
---
Now this feature could use some work, because editing is in fact also locked when the the deadline is reached. I will look into this part soon.
---

Yea I’d need to start getting paid to put that kind of time in
---
Now all I have to do is to learn Dutch…
---
The only way I'd go human is if it had that long on sides, bald on top Hulk Hogan hairstyle. They pull it off pretty well.
---
You’re all breathtaking!
---
Yes, looks pretty good now. :)
---
Though I'd kick the "non-existent aoe" line. Consecration is a pretty good aoe (~85-100dps to all enemies in the area). Yes, it's no blizzard, but it beats a hunter volley in the later stages and certainly outperforms the classes with real non existant aoe.

Regarding ele and enhancement you may be right. Those fights with high dps values tend to be short, so mana is less of an issue.
---
Macro for follow. Macro for start attack.
---
Not sure what the loot table for MC will look like in phase 1 actually.
---
Back at launch, MC had T1 and T2 in it, but far less other epics.
---
Then those were replaced with random epics like brutality blade etc in 1.4 or 1.5.
---
So who knows what phase 1 will be.  MC without T2 or added epics?  Or will it be with 1.4/5 loot?
---
Me.

Ah, another player of DOA: Beach Volleyball!

Classic WoW is a simple game. 
---
It's just tedius. Chances are if you're accustomed to modern gaming, you will not like classic.
---
The people who are going to like classic are people who played it to begin with. Everyone else will probably be put off by it.

World chat? I thought that was only a ps thing
---
That’s what I like to call a pro gamer move!
---
The editing would be a huge bonus, thanks for the work so far. Excellent tool
---
Completely disregarding bass damage of spells, sure. Ret gets roughly 2/3 of the benefit of +spell power that fire mages do.
---
But one, spell damage is exceedingly rare on leveling gear in classic. As a result, base spell damage is *much* more significant while leveling than it is at cap (and still very relevant at cap...).
---
Also, you’re completely ignoring mana. If a ret actually spams abilities like you’re describing, he or she is going to go oom super fast, making both their damage as well as their utility drop significantly.
---
White damage comprises the majority of ret damage while leveling. And that damage is basically just their AA’s and SoC procs. It’s still garbage, even with excellent on-level armor and weapons.
---
I don’t contest at all that ret brings excellent utility. And hey, if you have a Druid healer the Rez alone is worth bringing a ret for. But they’re a support class with some damage, at best. Even at lower levels, they can’t compete in terms of raw dps with other classes. Maybe if you stack shitloads of consumables and already have great gear, sure, they can compete. But what’s the point of spending all that time and gold prepping for a leveling dungeon?
---
50-60g per hour? On what, private servers? Pservers were broken, we all know this.
---
it's realistically more like 20-30g per hour, if that. And that is all dependant on how much loot mobs actually have to pickpocket in Classic. And since nobody has done a BRD pickpocket run yet, its impossible to say.
---
I'm not saying don't respec, but its a giant waste of time in the end if you could just pick a 1 size fits all spec and play with that. But if you're a true min/maxer and dont mind fighting every War/Rogue for swords i guess go swords.
---
Be prepared to heal when the raid needs it and they will keep you around.
---
Oh we have the discord but the voting system is noice. Thank you xantek!
---
Its OK to need if there is no cloth user that needs. 
---
It's similar situation to warrior rolling on leather. Sure, some BiS dps items are technically leather, but prepare to be flamed to oblivion if you  roll for leather pieces that rogue in your group needs. 
---
Armor is absolutely crucial stat in leveling, as it causes 95% of monsters to deal less damage to you. A a paladin you have luxury of being able to use all kinds of items and taking them whenever nobody else needs them, but cloth user can use only cloth. Taking a valuable item from them is 100% rude.

---
Hahaha lol, fuck me :D all good then
---
I think you’ll find it’ll maybe be comparable, or initially slightly slower ... but part of the reason the wand rush is so viable is because it sets you up to get the Greater Magic Wand at level 13-ish which is insane dps for that level
---
It's pretty clear you don't understand what 'entitled' means.
---
I know raid management (using discord) has come along way since Vanilla. Is there a megathread on this topic, or a good site/thread for information about using discord and google sheets etc for raid/attendance/loot management?
---
If you're primarily a PvP player and plan to join a PvP guild you'd be perfectly fine raiding with something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hiczybMqZZVcbp0xo) spec. If they ask you to respec every raid then they aren't a very good PvP focused guild.
---
For me it's sort of like an interesting homecoming.
---
I played Alliance in vanilla, but then switched and stuck with Horde in BC through Wrath. Decided I am going to go back to Alliance in classic.
---
Excited to see some zones that I haven't seen in a long time. I also hate to admit this, but I really do like Alliance cities more. Nothing feels quite like home like Ironforge.
---
I am 99% sure that is the rating given by calculating the given EP for your spec for each item. No way 0 people has used Edgemasters in the pre-raid bis list for example, but since the site cannot calculate gain from weapon skill it has no number next to it.
---
Thanks, I feel old now 🤣
---
I think every one has 5 %. Been awhile
---
Even boomkin and ret pally will be able to find a spot as long as the player is semi-competent. Probably not on most world/server first guilds, but for everyone else it’s usually better to have a good player in a non-optimal spec than a bad player in a more optimal one.
---
No, if it's in your bank, it's yours.  But this was the same with Guild Banks. The guild owner could take it all if they wanted.
---
Good point, thanks again man :-)
---
Ya but I'm not willing to do that. I have a very specific spec in mind and every point counts. If u put me against a shaman with a hybrid pve/PvP build I'll destroy him with reduced nova tick, 5 sec CD on shocks and 100% chance to resist pushback when I'm critted
---
When they try to login the server will reject them
---
LOL
---
OP: “should I do this?
---
Everyone unanimously: “No it makes literally zero sense.”
---
OP: “y’all are dumb and broke I should obviously do this.”
---
I noticed a huge difference in fps compared to retail. Could put everything on Ultra High, while on retail I have to put everything on Medium
---
I am broke but that's far from the point
---
Well if you work at a Chinese gold farming company I’m sure you can make like $0.15 an hour.
---
A shaman named Thex
---
Yes it is. If you let this sort of mentality fester in your guild from day 1 then it just continues to build. The people who are pulling their own weight start to see those who aren't. They see the inherent unfairness in a guild who rewards two people with different levels of contribution to the guild exactly the same. Long term, that sort of disparity will 100% affect morale.
---
You bleed all of your good players once you start wiping in aq40 and never recover.
---
Wait... so are you implying that spending 50gp in game is more costly than the additional subscription in real money?
---
Not while bging
---
This is simply not true. I played all the way through vanilla and fury was far more prevalent in raids.
---
Personally I never take imp. Heroic strike. 2% is always better imo
---
It's a big world indeed and transporting around in it takes time, valuable time. And whos to say the allies won't follow them? Look if I'm ranking but I can't find any team and I know ranking in a team is the best thing to do, obviously I'm just gonna go and find myself a team? add the people on friendlist and follow them around so I always have backup to get free honor with. 
---
There's no place to hide from such players.
---
I would early on, in lesser gear, mitigation is more important, and later on, when the dps is well geared, the potential increased threat from having more rage is more important.
---
What's the time difference between 10 and 11 like roughly? I really want the PVP mount but that's kinda it.
---
Have they updated the old addons yet to work with Classic?
---
Whatever mate, waste your time.
---
I was going through the same thing but with a mage. It came down to one thing for me, I didn't want to roll a warrior because I was worried I wouldn't have the time to get all the gear I'd need and keep up with everyone else, etc. I didn't want to roll a mage because I want to play a Warrior. 
---
Once I realized the only reason I didn't want to play a mage was because I wanted to play Warrior, I have no need to change my mind again. Classic wow isn't going anywhere, even if it takes me 2 or 3 years to gear up through MC/BWL/AQ, thats fine. I'll get there eventually.
---
Hope that helps!

Then go your pvp build and be slightly less optimal in raids. You’re welcome, I just saved you a lot of time and a sub.
---
I see what you’re saying, and I would agree with you *if* there was another expansion coming that would make the current content irrelevant, but there isn’t.
---
Unlike in 05/06 we now have all the time in the world. We have the luxury to run MC/BWL until they’re no longer needed and then move on to Naxx/AQ if that’s the route we want to take.
---
This is why I’m saying people are in too much of hurry. The notion that you’re going to run out of the time to the experience the content is just simply not true.
---
From a non-raiding non-minmaxing person, I’d say that the deflect sounds better for fulfilling the tank role.
---
I would assume that if threat was your issue and your rage was getting bottlenecked, then Imp H would be potentially better.
---
I’m not a qualified expert though, so maybe someone can correct me here.
---
I'm a first gen millenial. This has nothing to do with "not wanting special treatment" and has everything to do with "edge-lords can't be nice to people". Throw out that praise and love, you might be making someone extremely happy with very little effort from your end! I agree with you completely Cap'n!
---
Yeah he's talking absolute horse shit. There was a trend for people starting off arms and transitioning to fury but it was always recognised that fury was superior if you had the gear for it.
---
Its either you'll have trouble finding a raid spot as x class bc they don't take many. Or x class is overpopulated you will have too much competition for a raid spot. Some negative people on this subreddit you will be fine with whatever you pick.

Exactly! Lazy people are so annoying
---
No. Blood DKs were unique in the insane self healing they could do. No class in vanilla can self sustain like that.
---
Gp?the fuck is that lol.
---
Depends on how hardcore are people on your server really, as you are competing with them for the top spots. If you finish in the top 3 brackets every week it should be around 2-3 Months. But since we won't have BG's for a long time it's gonna be interesting to see elite roaming gank squads in all the high level zones.
---
Every race that can be a priest has a unique spell. Trolls have shadowgaurd, undead have devouring plague etc.
---
False.
---
Also yes, yes I am saying that.
---
50dkp minus
---
Nightbelf racial is actually trash for druids/rogues. 
---
Sure you get 1 more stealth level (5points) if you shadowmeld while stealthibg, but then you need to be standing still and doesn't really cover you if you are approached from the rear where they will still see you before you can see them.
---
For the record, shadowmeld does not work like it does in retail or later expabsions.  Its far more useful on non-stealrh classes.
---
Nice! I'm doing the same... Well almost. I'm cutting down on my coffee intake so that it has more of an impact around launch.

It would really benefit you if you cut that mentality out for classic.  Private server veterans have been playing the game (or close enough to it) for years as recently as weeks before Classic releases.  They *will* have valuable insight in to optimising the game.  Will some of the mechanics and values be off? Sure.  Will they adapt and overcome? Absolutely.
---
They can learn from you retail guys too don't get me wrong, but preaching from a position of ignorance will make you look dumb.
---
Haha I'll try man :D
---
&gt; they changed it to spell damage and healing somewhere in tbc, altho tbc did start off with spell damage
---
In Vanilla it's "spell damage and healing" too, but the shortest contraction I've seen so far for that stat is "spelldam". Although the combination of the two into "spellpower" was partially complete in BC, when they modified the +healing stat to grant 30% of its value toward +spelldam.
---
When I was 16 playing vanilla $15/ month was a big deal and I wanted to play 24/7 to "get my monies worth". Now that I have disposable income I'm thrilled to play a game that will only cost me $15/month and I don't expect to feel the pressure to play as much.
---
Ppl are looking at Classic with the Retail "feeling".
---
Stop trying to mix/maxing, in Classic knowing mechanics and having the right itens its much better than being a specific race/class/spec

Uhh.. it makes way more sense to RP that you're playing the human warlock from before they died and became forsaken.
---
&gt; Like yeah it's not min/max but it's not a handicap either
---
Depends on your definition of min/max. It's objectively the worst choice for warrior on Alliance.
---
But that doesn't mean it's completely broken and unplayable.
---
Rank 11 wasn’t super hard if you had the right group and was efficient in farming pugs. And by right group I mean you had a Druid for flags, 1 geared enhance shaman, 1 heals for the Druid the rest of the team 3/3 mages and rogues. 
---
Rank 12 and higher was when the grind really got slow. I to stop at general because college grades, my relationship and my life in general was falling apart.
---
This is what makes me laugh when people say you can hit rank 10 "casually".  I know there are a lot of variables in how long you need to play to hit certain ranks, but some people are saying you can hit rank 10 with just 2 hours played a day and that seems impossible from all the stories I've heard.
---
Your tanks would have to be all feral, but realistically hardly anyone runs feral tank. and finding enough of them would be rough. You could also replace your rogues with even more Ferals. But again finding enough that farm crowd pummelers is nearly impossible. Then just to be consistent it’s probably best to replace your mages with Balance Druids. And to give enough mana for your balance Druids, you’ll likely need your healers to be resto druids.
---
I had a completely different experience in both vanilla and on private servers, where we got through Naxx with at least a couple of what everyone today is calling meme specs. I'm not sure how retail raids are, but in vanilla there's a lot of mechanics in raids that don't call for persistent top dps/top heals; utilities like buffs, stuns, cleansing/decursing, interrupts, crowd control (like druid sleeping dragons in BWL), combat reses, innervates, etc. are pretty important.
---
Okay cool, unlike the other ones like Diamond Flask and Flame Wrath. I won't count on Bloodfang scaling until I see it anyway, and even then from what you're saying it might get patched out if it was an unintended reversal of the hotfix.

You will not hold threat against any DPS with comparable equipment as 31+ Arms without Defiance.
---
Also, I thought Improved Hamstring was really important for PvP? So you'd be losing that too.

Eye for an eye doesn't work.  If you hold a grudge, you'll lose your grip on friends.

I'm leading my own guild for progressive raiding and PvP events so it will b split and although I am the leader that's no excuse to run a suboptimal build in my raids. I may totem twist for melee group and offheal but I'm not sure i like that idea either.

They say evolution is survival of the fittest. It isnt: its survival of the good enough. Wow is survival of the good enough. Both in development and in characters.

Make sure you educate yourself on both sides of the issue. Breggin is a man who advocates that people shouldn't take medicine for their schizophrenia, despite the many scientific studies that show it is an issue with brain chemistry and neurotransmitters in which no other 'treatment' or otherwise has been offered by him.

The left click always gives out. I fixed my first mouse that did it but I had to open the mouse and spray WD-40 on the click sensor. But the mouse isn’t designed to be taken apart so it messed up the bottom a bit. And yeah I used to play WoW 7 days a week. Haven’t done that for a couple years now
---
Yeah they were shit talked because they were bad for most of vanilla. I don’t know if you realized this but blizzard changed the warrior talent tree which buffed fury warriors during vanilla wow. Prior to this buff fury warriors were terrible and that’s why people deemed them a meme spec. Fury is good on private servers because private servers play on 1.12 talents. Fury was also good during vanilla after they got buffed it just took some time to figure out, I remember in my guild during naxx we had a few fury warriors and they did amazing DPS.
---
It depends.
---
For pvp a shaman will not be able to dispel CC effects from the warrior.
---
They'll be frost nova'd or entangling rootsed the entire time so having windfury totem doesn't really matter.
---
Yeah because horde don’t venture into STM, Ashenvale, or 1k needles at any point...

I've got a group of 5-7 guys from high school that all played TBC together and we're all coming back and have a group text going.  Finally nailed down what each of us are playing, got some ideas on who is doing what professions and then the bomb dropped:
---
"We have to find 35 other people to show up for raids."
---
Yeah.  Fuck "optimal" specs and builds.  Just plz DPS Heals and Tanks show up relatively on-time a couple nights a week.
---
I haven't played the latest patch, but for the month I was playing there was 100% not a vendor that sold competitive PvE gear anywhere in the game.
---
Battle rez. It's tauntable.
---
The amount of agility per crit does scale with your level, yes 
---
Even while leveling, agi is an important stat. I wouldn’t say it is always better than strength, but you will want a healthy amount even during leveling
---
I don’t believe AP per dps scales with level.
---
I'm probably mistaken, but didn't the respec cost consistently rise in Vanilla? It's been many years lol. I didn't think there was a cap until later on, and then they just finally did away with the cost all together (which I might add was because it was becoming to expensive to purchase respecs all the time and players were constantly complaining). Also, it was much more difficult to obtain gold back in Vanilla. 50g back then was a decent amount of hold to have...
---
If you look at it this way, how long will it take you to farm 50g Vs how long it would take you to make $50 IRL I think you'll find your answer.
---
If you're willing to pay for the extra sub so you don't have to farm gold and that's what will make you happy, then fk it dude. You do you.
---
Except that isn't effective.   It's just epeen bullshit.  It adds maybe 3-4% dps, and you effectively can't heal while doing it.  If healing is that light, you are better off just not bringing one more healer, or letting the healer dps.
---
&gt; already was planning on NE if I level with a Priest for this exact reason
---
Keep in mind that NE is doubly bad for Priest, because you are sacrificing the OP priest racials that dwarf offers.
---
Desperate prayer and fear ward are both substantially better in pvp than just being able to afk invisible.
---
I plan on using it while leveling just to join groups without having to wait in the major cities, playing a healer or tank it should be fine even if you get in a group with 4 dps just kick one and find a replacement.
---
At level 60 it's kinda pointless you might as well just spam the chat channels.
---
Life is all about moderation. Everything in moderation, including moderation. It's fine to fucking binge out on things, booze, drugs, computer games. It's not fine to do that at the expense of responsibilities/social life/family life etc.

Technically it's possible. You don't even have to clear other bosses before Garr/Baron. The hard part is probably convincing ~20 other people to go kill 2 bosses in MC every week with you for (likely) months with little or not reward (and using their lockout). Trying to PUG for just 2 bosses and no warriors/rogues sounds almost impossible to my ears. Trying to PUG an entire MC clear with no warriors/rogues just sounds like a miserable experience since those are 2 of the top 3 dps classes.
---
One thing to encourage people to play the game....Great video games are one of the best things life has to offer. Sometimes I get down on myself because I see people on social media who make more money, have better friends, better relationships with their families....Especially the superstar pro athletes/musicians/actors...but what do those people do in their free time? They play video games. When I have 3 of my best friends with me in a Fortnite squad and I'm having so much fun, I just think.."This is also Gordon Hayward's favorite thing to do, and I'm doing it right now". I'm not in the NBA and I don't have a super model wife but I go home after work and play the same video games as Gordon Hayward. So even if you have all of those things you think you want, it still doesn't get better than WoW.  It's just a level of experience I'm grateful I get to enjoy.  I won't ruin my life playing them, but I will try to play as much as I can because for certain types of personalities it brings more happiness than anything and why rob yourself of that.
---
Agreed.

Everyone has 5% stun resist. So 40% +5 % = 45%

When som1 says "that's just sad" or anything along those lines when I'm asking for advice is gonna get some words it should be expected. U sir must be a Democrat because u totally twisted this the wrong way. Fakenews
---
Yeah this was my first thought.  I don't see almost anyone saying there's a problem getting a raid spot as a certain race.  Getting a raid spot as a certain spec is a whole different story.
---
We're here for you buddy. We might not understand your pain, but we can help and I can assure you, you won't have been the only one to come back from where you are.
---
What if its a 13 y/o thats just genuinely  excited about leveling and doesnt understand that saying ding every level is a bit strange? Why pass up the opportunity to possibly make someone feel good?
---
Try a logitech G600.  I used nagas almost from teh day they came out.  Consistently killed one in 6-8 months.   Got a G600 and have used it for something like 5 years without any issue so far.
---
And here I was thinking I was fully prepared for launch 😂
---
Some people actually believe this.
---
Really?
---
I am currently working on a bot myself and I want it to remind people that did not sign up or out.
---
I also want it to connect to Google sheets.
---
I also want to enable a feature for auto sign ups.
---
I can’t find the source for your bot, are you not publishing it?
---
I probably will once this mouse craps out then. Thanks!
---
A weight may have been lifted, but a weight will surely be gained.
---
The better gear you have the faster you can farm = more gold.
---
If you farm dungeons on main and you have good raiding gear = pull more mobs and get done faster.
---
So if you are farming without professions the better gear you have the faster it goes.
---
So if you are not gonna raid on your mains it would be better to level gathering professions.
---
But you can of course still farm on a low geared lvl 60 without much trouble, better gear just makes it a bit faster i guess.
---
Mmo mice are for plebs.  Get an fps mouse.
---
Raiding helps a hunter alt farm, specifically 3pc beaststalker.
---
I assume you'd only have one active farming alt and the rest will just generate passive income. Raiding doesn't help you do xmutes. Some raid enchants (e.g. spellpower) sell well.
---
I'm also keeping tailoring, so it's not like I'm wasting those skillups.
---
Interested to see how it all pans out. It also heavily depends on how much cloth I get organically, because I'll be leveling with 4 other players.
---
So if they can feed me cloth it should be ezpz.
---
Oof, rule 5.

Gonna use a CRT Momitor with my crusty old ball mouse and IBM ps2 connected keyboard

With fast weapon attacks, heroic strike becomes more and more useful for threat generation. Because it has such high base threat, having a faster weapon scales it better than a slower, higher per hit damage weapon would 
---
Of course, the only times you’ll be able to spam or use HS liberally is when you are flooded with rage, which isn’t as common when you’re tanking 5 mans compared to raid bosses. 
---
I wouldn’t expect either to make a significant difference. As you mentioned, parry will provide a little more survivability while HS will be a little better threat generation 
---
With shield block and the rest of your avoidance, you’ll typically be able to revenge on cool down. So I wouldn’t worry about that as a factor
---
&gt; 3rd loot release of phase 1
---
What do you mean by this? I don't think there will be multiple loot releases per phase.
---
Yeah but you are still going to have an issue getting groups to gear up for raids, at least from what ive seen. People are OVERLY elitist (at least on private servers, experienced it back in the day too) If you give them any silly reason to not take you, they wont. I used to love tanking but people are tools, they want a geared tank, no they wont help you get geared, you need the gear from the instance already in order for them to take you into the instance... So im going to just be a jerk hunter and make people pay in world pvp. The End
---
good idea. I fear a bit the setup required might become overwhelming with this implemented. raid leader would have to set which role in discord is considered core and which role is considered initiate. I think the leaders should also know who is core and who isn't, not sure if the bot needs to take that off their shoulders. The uncounted, italic signup was initially intended to make signing up with alts on top of your main possible.
---
I don't listen to the virgins who have to control other peoples gaming experience.
---
Yea, see ya, have fun being absolutely miserable the rest of your life.
---
Stop getting people's hopes up. I play on a private server and I've only been in a raid a handful of times that had maybe 1 ret paladin. It's very niche, only a handful of guilds will take 1 ret pal on all their raids, and it's usually so they can apply the Nightfall debuff or something like that. If you plan on sticking with ret you will be lucky to find a guild that will give 1 spot to you every week.
---
I agree.  It gives people time to actually sleep.
---
Light forging my soul xD
---
Have a hit capped hunter since you have no backup if the first one misses.
---
I'm gonna have a hard time finding a raid spot because i cant find a group that I like that has raid times that works for me.

*This test will be available to all World of Warcraft players with a current subscription or active game time in all regions.*  
---
***We ask that players please log-in and play as much as possible during the first two hours of the test*** *...*  ***as that is when we’ll be actively monitoring for issues important to launch.*** 
---
So instead of a real stress test, it is pay2win to setup your addons/ui ahead of launch and reserve a name a few days later.
---
If they wanted to really stress test, it would be free&amp;open to all and have some incentive to actually log in.

For that amount of money you can get decent AAA games in sale or support great indie developer instead of giving it to Activision :D

A sub is a non issue. I am not gonna run out of money but I will run out of gold for respeccing
---
That's more due to bad guild management. If it was never hardcore and never focused on recruiting top-tier players, then everyone's on the same page.
---
If the guild never bothered to set any performance standards and enforce it, it was never really hardcore to begin with. Those wipes in AQ40 have more to do with bad guild management than having a couple "meme specs" or some underperformers.
---
There's an entire year's worth of MC/Ony/BWL raiding where guilds can fine-tune their standards that you're just completely ignoring. Raid composition isn't the first thing you change to improve success. You're overstating how important it is. It's not honest to assume everyone trying to raid as a boomkin expects to clear naxx in the server first guild on the progression kill
---
If you’re alt focused you’re probably not gonna be raiding much unless its a casual raid guild or you get in the occasional pug. At that rate you’re not gonna accumulate gear fast enough fir it to really benefit.
---
Enrage does not kill the tank outright, and it’s a fast fight if your ranged dps know to outrange the fear. He’s killable with zero tranq shots if everyone is actually pulling their weight.
---
yeah I'll make a blank space emote for it, alternatively for now you can use " - " to separate words.
---
We are gonna get downvotes, but i totally agree with you. Having 1-2 keybinds on your mouse is ok, but having 18 is not.
---
it still has its uses ... but it’a largely a relic left over from an earlier patch level in which it was Fury’s main attack. see: https://youtu.be/hM94UkLBEOE
---
it is closed source, for the time being.
---
Probably not. There was high competition though
---
Referring to druid
---
&gt; Least played class in Classic Wow which makes it easier to gear up and get a spot in groups.
---
Not really. It's easy to find a group as a druid tank, but not as a healer unless the group has a res already, whigc is unlikely if you are applying to be the healer. Also you compete pretty heavily with melee DPS for gear, and healers for gear, and since you do everything a bit worse, you are likely to be last in line for items. What you don't have to deal with is more than another druid in the raid, so you don't have much TIER competition.
---
&gt;Is here any idea of how time-consuming that might be, in terms of hours per week and number if weeks?
---
I got to rank 10 while I was in high school in a raiding guild, maybe rank 11 but I forget now. I would pvp from when I got home (~3pm) until raid time (about 6ish, give or take) every day and then PVP from 8-9AM -6pm on weekends.
---
So, quick math that's 3 hours a day 5 days a week and 10 hours 2 times a week, so 35 hours a week give or take that I put in. One thing to take into consideration though is I was on a high population server that had multiple people going for rank 14 at the same time (like, at least 3 or 4 people grinding constantly with their premades), so you may not have to put as much time in provided you win most your matches if you're on a low pop server. 
---
&gt;Can it realistically be done solo-queuing, or do you need a premade group?
---
Premade group would help (if your team is good), but not necessary. I pugged for the most part, only doing premades if a good group invited me or our guild was doing on, which only happened 2-3 times a month.
---
I have no idea personally, I wouldn't think so though
---
Fair enough
---
It's ok if I was a failed streamer id get salty all over classicwow subreddit for no reason as well lol
---
When we got our first binding there was no info on the interwebs what it was for - so we gave it to a rogue
---
I lived through it the first time round. You absolutely will.
---
R14 chars cost literally thousands even on private servers. Can be a huge moneymaker.
---
The really scary part about this picture is the keybindings - or lack thereof.
---
Lol it was a joke since he just typed a paragraph about how to get it from mythic/HC raiding or PvP 
---
I guess my comedy is just 2 gud
---
What does Bobby B think of this ?
---
This will be very close to the DPS of a furyProt OT when they can go full DPS on a boss. From experience, I'd say you lose about 10-15% DPS vs a full-fledged Fury, maybe 20% world buffed. That is a lot of damage still, you'll be fine.
---
I'd try to make room for 2/2 Improved Execute though - it makes a really big difference. I would recommend taking the points from Improved Sunder Armor, but you could take them out of DW Specialization and still come out ahead I think. 
---
Also, since you'll be a DPS 2nd class of sorts anyway, maybe volunteer going for 3/5 or 5/5 Improved Demo Shout instead of Booming Voice. Someone has to do it.
---
I WARNED YOU THIS WOULD HAPPEN! BACK IN THE NORTH, I WARNED YOU, BUT YOU DIDN'T CARE TO HEAR! WELL, HEAR IT NOW!
---
Wow both bindings in one run, that second rogue musta been stoked
---
So far, Dota 2 has 47 pro players with one team contending at the international.
---
Denmark has 20 pro players with no Danish team even invited to the international.
---
So for dota 2 (i don't watch lol) they produce about the same amount of pro players when factoring in population size.
---
They're definitely not producing far more pros however, not even close.
---
Source is liquipedia.
---
Awesome! Do you think I'd still be able to revenge on cd without one pt in imp shield block?
---
For real.  My first time in MC I was an arms warrior in half greens.  They just needed anybody that was available.
---
I got big hands and fat fingers. My wife has the g600 and I cannot hit just one button, i end up mashing several at a time. So for me, the naga hex (thex) is perfect for me. 7 large buttons on the side is the perfect amount. I've gone through 2 of them so far, and when this one dies, I will buy another.
---
That won't matter though, because people will still try to enforce whatever is meta. The playerbase has changed, it doesn't matter how it was way back in the original classic. People will bring the new age meta shit regardless of what game it is.
---
Indeed, my Lord
---
I can guarantee you all content barring maybe Naxx is clearable with 20 Druids and 20 Hunters.
---
I agree, and I’m by no means saying the intention for me (or for anyone else) should be to be a part of sloppy, poorly run guild. But I also don’t think the majority of the player base is going to be looking for a guild that’s trying to push the envelope of how quickly the content can be cleared either.
---
change

Thanks for your comment.

I saw on a stream in menethil harbor. Only once though and midway in the beta

You just have to be masterlooter.
---
But RP PvE
---
The topic is bout RP PvP
---
I remember wayyyy back doing MC and we would be 4-5 people short. We invited any shitter and his Nan to fill spots. Everyone think they are Method until they raid and realise peoples stupidity is 1000x more a problem than the class they are playing. Hell you could clear MC with just offspecs
---
Tbf most of those same people dont want to spend 4hrs in MC and will want efficient raid comps.  Now I think people who go as far as shitting on race choices are taking the minmax too far.  But I can see how people with lives outside of the game might not have as much patience for a guy who insists on dpsing as a paladin.
---
Someone is triggered.  What meme spec do you play?
---
Real talk...Paladins and dwarf priests are a bigger PITA to warlocks than 40% of your fights being against UD with a semi-long CD.
---
This sub *greatly* overvalues Horde locks over Ally ones. 1-2 Paladins in a BG will make your life as a lock a friggin' epic level annoyance.
---
Fair point, I'll consider changing it when I get back home :-)
---
Thanks!
---
This thread is kinda insane,  and who's upvoting you??    
---
" If you have Asperger and ADD it means you are not normal and what normal  people should do does not count for you, especially if that's what you  aspire (a good thing actually since it means you have accepted the fact  that you are not normal). "   Like seriously,  wtf.    
---
Got news for you,  having Asbergers / ADD doesn't automagically make someone "abnormal"  This whole quote is incredibly condescending.
---
I have big hands, but long slender fingers so hopefully the buttons on the G600 I already ordered will be usable by me. I could never buy another Razer mouse. I have owned three Razer mice in my life and not a single one of them still works. Every Logitech mouse I have ever owned is still functional.
---
You're one of those people who don't like getting heals, aren't you? Tiny little hard-to-click bastards.
---
Meh. I've been at the same job for 12 years and in remission from cancer. You can't ruin my life anymore than it already is. This is an improvement.
---
Eventually it will be, but I'll take my time while I'm still actively working on it. It is not \*supposedly\* possible to confine the bot and restrict it so it can't do any harm, it simply is. The discord permissions it asks are visible on invite and from that you can exactly determine what the bot could do.
---
I must have been on a bad server, it was a god damned nightmare finding a raidspot as a NE Hunter in vanilla. Especially since I never got tranq shot. Dungeons weren't hard, but no one wanted another hunter for raid. I look forward to this magical land that will get you in raids by simply showing up prepared.
---
Now you make me doubt. I read that on a forum, which added up with poster formula. But indeed i dont remember kidney shot resist unless VS orc or warrior
---
Just wanna say thanks for the priest and warrior gear guides, wife and I will be referring to them extensively. I took screenshots since level 9 in vanilla. I made an album if you wanna check them out.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/P1peL](https://imgur.com/gallery/P1peL)
---
That makes no sense... If they had developed their society they should be able to afford proper welfare and universal health care for their citizens...
---
Very helpful information, thank you. Might be too much for me, but I'll see how things go.
---
100% this.  I think people have really blurred memories for just how hard it is to find people to raid with.  This isn’t retail, there is no group finder that goes across every server... this isn’t a private server where there’s 15k people on one server.  If they keep populations near vanilla like populations down the line, good fucking luck finding 40 reliable people to raid with who are all picking the min/maxed classes/racials/specs.
---
That’s a good point. Though $2000 for 500 man hours worth of work over a month doesn’t sound great
---
Exactly. Can we please just continue our daily round of Bingo!
---
Except good guilds won't be taking a ton of hunters and druids.   The shit guilds will be the ones forced to take the leftovers.   They're the ones that will have 5 druids and 7 hunters.
---
Stacking the raid with OP classes while ostracizing the weak ones is one of the reasons the game is a joke now.
---
Right, but as of now we expect each content phase to bring the loot that roughly corresponds to the patch that introduced the content.
---
So some MC loot is in phase 1, more is added in phase 2 (all of Domo's chest, for example) and then still more in phase 3.
---
As far as we know, MC is the only raid that will see its loot tables change over time though.
---
Base 5% chance to resist?
---
THANKS FOR THE POST! 
---
My melee DPS Balance Druid thanks you for it! LET'S GO RAIDING!
---
LoL
---
Form an all Druid guild
---
:)  being "Normal" is overrated.  maybe that sounds cliche,  but it's true.
---
It mostly depends on how competitive your server is, but you’ll need to play substantially more hours per day for a few of weeks to get there. R11 is no joke and that’s why they reward you with a mount.
---
In a guild? Probably no way, unless maybe it's your 10th TF 10 years after release.
---
In a pug? All MC pugs have bindings on res anyway, yours wouldn't be worse.
---
God damnit my guild is named Moon Moon.

Tbh it’s hilarious that everyone thinks there’s gonna be a huge drop off of players yet no one is saying they will stop playing. Also, why assume that’s even the case? People just want to act like they know everything.
---
You can post the event into a channel where nobody, apart from admins, has ANY access apart from viewing. The players do not need more than that, they can't delete the message that way. clicking reactions already posted are always permitted, so that doesnt require any extra permissions.
---
Need if you need. Don’t be a dick though.
---
If it marginally helps your leveling (or does not benefit you), leave it to someone that actually gets a boost of it.
---
I don’t think you benefit from that sort of high spirit gear a priest would want. Armor is probably one of your most important stats, too.
---
Thanks, good post! You played on private servers, and so did I, but I also played back in vanilla. I'm not saying that raids should be full of hybrid specs who don't heal, but there were always a few and that was true through Naxx.
---
I agree, and I’m not saying I *want* to spend 4 hours in MC. But if early on that’s what it takes as we begin the gearing process, it’s not a problem because there’s no rush from the perspective of a timeline that will make the content irrelevant.
---
And I think it’s a bit exaggerated if you think that one dps paladin is going to bring down the pace of a run by any noticeable margin.
---
Benthic.
---
The building has gotten way out of hand now, soon as you engage someone they build the fucking Taj Mahal and turtle up in it. Nice of you to assume I was getting shit on when you don't know jackshit about me you little wank stain.
---
That statistics are scewed. Did you look at the class and race distribution? Troll Shamans are heavily underrepresented!
---
This actually breaks the rule on having titles in your name.  Lord/King/Queen, etc.
---
Warriors are a terror in the right gear - however, I think people forget how bad they are in shit gear. Regardless of this video.
---
Yeah that all sounds correct to me, although I haven't seen any timetables for the MC loot release/progression. Would make sense that they do them with phases though, because then bindings would probably come WITH bwl, making a ton more sense (and following the arc)
---
And yeah I never would've suggested BWL , AQ40, or naxx had changing loot tables like that, tbh it's kind of weird in the first place and I chalk it up to vanilla being blizz' first experience into mmorpg, they were also adapting , adjusting, making audibles that they saw fit.
---
Wait, how old were you in 2004 if you're just now graduating college?
---
11PM (UK) August 26th
---
I hope people with little Vanilla experience take their time to get the job done. Personally I'm just going to go level 'hardcore' and after that I'll just be there for raids. I don't want to be busy playing all the time. Luckily I don't care about the PvP ranks (and as a healer it also doesn't add much), so I can just play for fun when bored and spend 2 hours in MC with a very experienced ex-private server group. I've spent enough time in Vanilla that there is little left to discover so I'll even be sticking to dungeon leveling to not do the same quest for the 5th time or so.
---
Yes they can. You can have a raid of 40 druids if you want. Go nuts
---
But what if classic is a success and TBC is coming? Wouldn't you want to be with the first wave of people who transfer their characters?
---
This is the exact mentality this vid is trying to prey on lol, don't pay it any mind. This dude was charging into like 1v7 situations without a healer. Warriors are not bad at 60 but you can make any class look bad for a joke vid if ya just rush in with 0 teammates nearby.
---
I think there are delusional folks on both sides of that one, I see posts like "classic will grow to 12 million players!!!" .... Yeah pretty unlikely and I also see "90% of players will quit pre 40!" 
---
Nuts on both sides lol
---
of course, they can just click another reaction to delete the old one and add the new. Can also press the X reaction to remove themselves entirely. Pressing on Absence reaction also removes any signups that were previously added by that player.
---
Don't be a casual, you can do that ez
---
BRE, Spinal, basically anything that drops off rag
---
You did get shit on lol if you were good at building you wouldn't be crying about people building the "taj mahal".   Just say it man you couldn't build so you quit because the people who built took a shit on you.  It's okay buddy you too can learn to build.  Practice some 90s and box fights and you'll be okay.
---
 As someone who farmed 99.99% to rank 11, yeeeah  that's not gonna happen again.
---
College will always be there but the grind may not!
---
It's theoretical optimisation. Ideally you have the best version of every class/spec. But you know what? One of your Paladin's might be a shockadin and that's ok.
---
I played a Feral Druid, had only a basic idea how to play, and still got to see AQ and BWL.  Fear not friends, even *you* will get a raid slot!
---
i thought it was gonna end differently when you said naked :O
---
half the spots in a raid are pretty much just for warm bodies anyways, a competent player can easily get a spot especially considering how much work has been done on the theorycrafting side since retail vanilla
---
You mean now that you're older you don't have any friends asking you to parties?
---
In case anyone watched the trailer and wanted more, they actually ended up making the first episode before scrapping the idea. Most of the scenes from the trailer aren't in it, but it's quite good imo. Here you go!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI9LJtXjG7Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI9LJtXjG7Y)

What do you guys think of my lvling spec to 60? 
---
Could I improve something? The hardest part for me is to decide if I should max imp overpower or impale first.
---
I'm not sure if it's better to get 2% extra damage in 2hand weapons instead of maxing imp hamstring.
---
I leveled 1 to 60 as a resto druid with probably 95% of my exp being solo.
---
I solo q'd. Rank 13 on US-Arthas.  Like it's possible but 20 hours / week for rank 10/11 is probably correct.
---
Dumbest post I've seen in a while, and judging by your replies, you're serious and not trolling. This scares me. Thanks for the laugh.
---
I miss playing
---
Except that PC would be way more than $2000 haha.    But point well made!
---
Why does everyone say rogues are slow levelers? Between riposte reducing your incoming damage and cripple kiting to pool energy, there is no downtime with first aid.
---
Only on alliance. 
---
Horde warriors spam hamstring to fish for windfury procs. They ignore slam.
---
Exactly what I did too.  57-60 on owlbeasts.  Also funded my epic mount when Helm of Narv dropped.
---
No effort
---
In vanilla, they were added in 1.6 (BWL patch). I would assume they won't not drop in Classic p1 and p2, but there is no way to know at the moment.
---
I was testing that on a pserver (and it could be wrong) but it seemed like I still go stunned just as much when testing it with the bats in Trisfal Glades.  Which it is odd considering it should be a 25% increase.  Maybe I just had horrible RNG.
---
It’s a ~2 minute fight if you have 32 people doing 225 dps each.
---
If you're a hunter and you are good at pulling, kiting, and can tranq shot reliably i don't give a damn what race you are or what gear you have i want you in my raid.
---
I had a razer naga epic a few years ago, the wireless and plethora of buttons made it amazing but the thing is so poorly made. Within the first year the right mouse button gave out and the scroll wheel broke. I've moved on to Logitech and haven't had an issue yet, not very many buttons but the g502 has 5 buttons I can program.
---
You won't get raid invites as a human warlock because reasons.
---
Critical thinking is hard when you're dumb, that's why he's so defensive.
---
Pretty sure this is where boomkin took off. 
---
https://youtu.be/-kfr3602ANI
---
Which yeah, is TBC
---
For clarity I did Undead and Orc Warlock to determine the racials on that.
---
Yeah it’s definitely not okay, no way. No one should play how they feel comfortable.
---
&gt; Once I get a piece of gear, it won't change in 3 months. 
---
And on BFA you won't change it for like 6 months till next patch.
---
Difference is in classic you gonna look at a spreadsheet someone did to see what dungeon/raid you gotta farm to get your BiS while on BFA you pray the million RNGs give the correct object with titanforging/benthic and socket
---
That's time put into one area of the game that you are not putting into another area of the game and you know how much fun you have in each area of the game
---
Agreed /s
---
Honestly, I agree with this 100%. People are way too focused on hypothetical min/max'ing and not on what OP is talking about. Everyone needs to chill, you will find raid spots, relax...
---
and you didn't even know your "then" from "than"!
---
Generally speaking they are one of the slowest levelers. Experienced players can always bend the rules a bit but the leveling speed rating is really only useful for new or old returning players:-)
---
I funded my epic mount, robes of insight, staff of jordan etc, by doing an AH scam where me and a friend would buy out a cheap epic (icemail jerkin comes to mind) then put one on the AH for like 300 gold. Then make an alt and say in trade "WTB icemail jerkin for 350 gold" someone without fail would buy it off the AH in hopes of making a quick 50 gold. then i would log off that toon and never log back on it.
---
You should start a female gnome only guild called the Powerpuff girls, and your friends should start a orc/troll only guild called the gangreen gang.
---
Do you think I will get a raid spot as a ret pally if I advertise myself as a dedicated nightfall bitch?
---
Real minmaxers kiss the loot council’s ass mid cast
---
... you’re a mad genius
---
I'd just pick up a G600, Razer products are more cheaply made to prey on people who care about branding and will continually buy Razer gear when theirs breaks. If you don't care about brand, G600 is a way better investment.

Travel, study, learn new stuff, meet people and experience new cultures. There is a lot of stuff I wish I did in my early 20s that I didnt do because I played WoW. I don’t regret playing, but I don’t think it would hurt if I had played a little less and maybe taken the time to see the world.

10x elementium bars required to summon Thunderaan
---
So, for the sake of the hypothetical let's say you're SUPER lucky and get both bindings before BWL (tbh it's unlikely for most people, it will definitely happen, though, to many people) 
---
Let's say you're super lucky again and get the elementium ore to drop 5x two weeks in a row (5% drop rate and theres probably about 30-40 techs in all of BWL, 5x in one week I've never actually personally seen) 
---
That's still week 3 of phase 3. There will be honor for like 3 months by then , maybe more. 
---
I definitely think the big hardcore guilds will form raids to prevent one another from defeating Thunderaan, but I don't think smaller guilds will see an issue with overpopulated wpvp by that point . 
---
I think the first 4 weeks of phase 2 will be best wpvp in history of wow it will be fucking INSANE
---
The mafia only existed on pvp servers. Also with layering at start it’ll be impossible to stop people from killing them.

I once got temp ban from Forums for posting a thread on why Michael Jackson was innocent and was not a paedophile.... lol! I was about 14 (still very old to be doing something so facepalm).

those were the golden days of the forums. the good kind of toxicity not like we have today..

This is what the game was about. People exploring what interested them and finding others who clicked with them to do the harder content, together.

Looking forward to all of this again. :)

Here’s another vote for the G600. Super comfortable in palm grip, much more comfortable than my old Naga. Thumb buttons are easily accessible and easy to differentiate due to the shape/angle of the buttons. The G-shift button is awesome too because you can switch to another set of keybinds on the fly. I love this mouse so far, it makes the game much easier for me. I’ve also read that the G600 tends to last people for a while. Plus it’s only about $30 on Amazon.
---
I ranked to 11 (have a screenshot as a thread-starter of another post) and it took me roughly 6-8 hr a day, every day, for roughly 3 months, beginning at rank 4 or 5. YMMV
---
The chance of a failed run with 4 fresh randoms is pretty high. Orbs don't even drop until you actually get to the scarlet side and kill a couple of bosses. And then you get those people who "accidentally" hit need on your orbs (unless you master loot the entire way, which is a pain in the ass).
---
I did this on a private server and I know from experience that PUG orb runs are godawful. Better to have a consistent group.
---
I think about this too... Former rank 13.... I want the title and the gear... But that time investment my god....
---
In that context your complaints about the game are very valid. But levelling through old expansions is a tiny tiny part of what people do in modern WoW (and a lot of people never do it). So you look a bit stupid when you extrapolate your experience there onto the entire game. It's a bit like playing through Elwynn Forest in Classic and then going on reddit saying Classic is a terrible game because of what you experienced there. 
---
Actually, it's more like playing through Elwynn forest in TBC and then complaining about the new expansion based on that. 
---
The game is in desperate need of a levelling overhaul, I think everyone agrees on that. Blizzard has said they are working on it too, just not sure how they are going to implement it. 
---
&gt;Questing felt pointless because there was no danger and it seemed like nothing I did mattered. And all the story quests were may as well have been on rails.
---
This is a problem throughout the entire game, not just old expansions (although the "pointless" part is more prevalent there). If you want story in your MMO then WoW is definitely not for you, not classic wow either. I've heard people recommend FFXIV for that though, so maybe check that out. 
---
&gt;Dungeons were horrible because there was no time to actually experience the content, it was just go go go.
---
That's always the case with old content people have done over and over again, it will also be the case a year or so into classic when everyone has ran the dungeons multiple times and just want to get it over with. Playing at launch of new content is the only way to "experience" stuff like that for real with pugs. 
---
&gt;And leveling up and getting gear also seemed pointless as all the mobs just scaled with you so you never felt like you were making any progress. 
---
This is also only the case while levelling. Modern WoW, including most of your character progression starts at lvl 120. Don't let the 120 levels before that fool you, they are only there as a carryover from older versions of the game. Most progress now is stuff like rep and AP and gear at 120, when the world is no longer scaling with you. 
---
So basically, yes, levelling in modern WoW sucks balls. Everyone agrees on that, even Blizzard.
---
TBC was by far my favorite expansion and I would absolutely transfer to a TBC, and do so right away most likely. 
---
But two things; I think we have a couple years before they consider further legacy content. I think to really see if this is a viable option for the future they’ll need to see the player base stay consistent for at least a year before they pull the trigger.
---
And two, at least I’ll get to make that choice when it’s presented and not have the new content forced upon me without the option to continue to enjoy where I’m at.
---
OP going to have a hard time finding a raid spot with all that rage...
---
I'll admit I never played 2H Fury as Horde. I would guess it comes down to gear, ie, spreadsheet time.
---
i see your Purple rain and raise you one choclate rain.
---
10 pushups every time you die.
---
It is only a private server thing
---
I paid someone else.
---
Is headmasters charge (epic scholo staff) phase 1?
---
If you've never farmed bindings before I'm letting you know now as someone who has completed thunderfury.
---
Farming weekly lockouts for a year shouldn't surprise you before snagging both of them.
---
Just be sure you are ready for that level of commitment.
---
I would assume so - but not certain.
---
On curseforge, you can search by version, specifically WoW Classic version 1.13.2. I've got an addon in there and i can click a checkbox on a file upload if its Classic compatible :D
---
The issue isn't whether you will find a guild, it's whether that guild will be any good.   The good guilds will be recruiting like 3 druids and 3 hunters.   Ideally they want like 2 to show up, so some will be bench warmers.   That leaves a lot of extra druids and hunters floating around looking for a guild.  Which means a lot of the "casual" guilds will end up with a lot more druids and hunters than is optimal.
---
It’s all relative unfortunately. 
---
You get rank points and the number of points you get depends on what rank% you are on the server, each rank gets a certain amount of these points, with the maximum honour farmer for the week getting 12,000 (I think?)
---
Then each week you take the cumulative total rank points you had at the start of the week, reduce them by 20% for the “decay” and then you add on the rank points you’ve earned based on your rank for the week. This is how your rank for the week is worked out, and each rank requires more and more points.
---
Only a certain % of players can be rank 14,13,12 etc. at any given time, obviously very few can be rank 14, but loads can be rank 1.
---
If you’re on a server where the average player plays 10 hours a week of pvp and you play 20, then you can probably get in a higher rank points bracket, and get more points and rank faster. 
---
But if you’re on a server where the average is 30 hours and you play 20, you’ll rank up much slower despite playing the same amount.
---
Obviously I’m assuming everyone is accruing the same honour per hour, but it’s just for example purposes. Also horde and alliance have their own rank points, so you’re only comparing your points to your faction on your own server.
---
Were these lists that common? I know gank and do not party lists were common but gratsing?
---
Same man. I was sheeping the wrong adds on majordomo and we wiped. Doesn't matter, we try again. It's a game. A fun one!
---
I know we have tons of comments like this one, but when I was 12 and played classic in a private server, I rolled a warlock, made my talents myself, choosing mostly stuff that would allow me to heal myself and life tap so I wouldn’t be idle during fights. I didn’t use my wand and my rotation was pretty much just drain life and DOTS, life tapping when OOM. Don’t even mention downranking, I used the highest ranks because the numbers were just bigger.
---
Now, I’m not gonna say I finished a raid, because I never did.
---
But I did get into AQ several times, did many bosses, and had a couple epic items. I didn’t even know how raids worked. Heck, I even had to reject invitations to raids because I thought ubrs was better than BWL. And i wore whatever circlet showed my undead face better, didn’t care about stats there.
---
I agree you definitely fair better by spreading the loot out. Decking out your MT in everything, even incremental upgrades that would have a larger effect on a dps, is idiotic.
---
It also puts way too much value in a single player, which can effectively cripple your raid if he/she quits or is scalped by another guild.
---
This is my arms/prot build for Classic. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LcGxdIboxzVZxfzs
---
Human, 5/5 sword spec+Sweeping strikes+Trash blade= Excellent tanking. By level 50 you'll have Last stand and points into shield. If you're a main tank like me, you'll be doing alot of 5 mans in prep for your first MC. This build will give you the edge you need to ensure you're clearing BRD, Scholo, UBRS everytime without issue.
---
Sure you can do your cookie-cutter ArmsPVP spec and be able to tank just fine. Chances are though you're going to run into trouble with your AOE game. If you're an experienced classic warrior this is a really fun build. 3/3 revenge proc is invaluable during your pre-bis grind.
---
I don't know if I should be happy you saved your ass, or you had to have one made before you got married.
---
I mean, I am happy, people in divorces try to take things that don't belong to them, yet it seems like you knew it was coming :'&lt;
---
boomkin is legitimately a decent spec. can do more dps than hunters depending on the tier of content.
---
https://forum.classicwow.live/topic/726/by-the-great-winds-i-come-classic-balance-druid-theorycraft-spreadsheet-v1-1
---
The private servers were much bigger. To the tune of 10,000+ and no layering.  
---
If the cartels can control 90% of the devilsaur leather, they can effectively price it at whatever value they want.  
---
This means that a small cartel can easily make enough money to cover the time they spent because the price of the leather is drastically inflated.
---
Just a subscription

eh
---
Don't forget suicide pacts and doing butt stuff in church (cause God will smite both your asses).
---
Assuming they have a best in slot weapon, and ignoring all but literally one talent in the frost tree, as well as crit chance entirely, sure. Ret can be competitive to a frost mage's damage assuming that frost mage has 0 +spell power.
---
But in reality, where crits happen, and not all rets automatically have their BiS weapon, whereas virtually all mages have their highest FB rank and more than 5 points spent in frost (and crit chance, and occasionally some +SP), it's less close.
---
Never said it was...
---
dwarf priest
---
It won’t be anything like that in a month.
---
It doesent matter if you are playing the ideal race for the class if you suck at what you are doing.
---
The only way you *MAY* have a hard*er* time finding a raid spot is if you play a spec that's not optimal (balance druid, ret paladin, etc). If you're willing to spec the optimal PVE specs for any class, you'll be fine.
---
It'll only ruin your experience if you let it. If you're concerned that it could then don't go on Twitch or YouTube...
---
Just don't tune in to them. I'll be streaming some but I work 6 days a week some weeks and have 2 children to take care of. I'll be like you and I'm fine with that.
---
Even this comment &lt;3
---
Alliance shamans doesn... oh. I see what you did there!
---
Just follow some APES members on twitch and in a few weeks you’ll see how a bunch of fresh 60s in green leveling gear take down Magmadar and every other boss in MC.
---
Yeah im the same but there are almost no choices available.
---
Dont forget that there are just a few models and alot of them have early 2000s style. So most wont suite anyone.
---
You can even see it on pservers where every second female human player looks the same.
---
Hahahaha
---
Yes..I am..it was hilarious. Won it from my husband. It was a guild run. He got it later on but it became a running joke in our circle.  We called the mount 3. To this day we laugh about it. Most people forget..your supposed to laugh and have fun. That is why I still love the game so much. Not sure what I am being downvoted.
---
Our problem is that we currently are arround 40 people, trying to decide if either play on a random english server, or wait for the Spanish community to chose the server for us so we get people who speak Spanish.
---
So.... Play with Spaniards like me, (Which I dislike because they are a bunch of casuals most of them) or random server... 
---
I hope my m8s don't make me go into a second "Spainbreaker (Spinebreaker back in the day)".
---
People also underestimate how much easier the raids were back then. Playing **any** class optimally is going to be fine. You can clear MC with a group that has mostly greens.
---
Congrats brother
---
boomkins shouldn’t be considered meme specs tbh, they do fine and can even outdps hunters depending on the tier.
---
Noope she a shaman and she hits you will the ole Oprah Windfury

Rawr loud  noises
---
I’ve done a fair bit of research on leveling warriors and have learned about the hamstring kiting tactic! So you’re saying that leveling a shaman would be around the same speed as leveling a warrior anyway?
---
Here's the thing you should do.
---
Step 1: run the raid in a normal raid group
---
Step 2: if bindings drop, ninja them
---
Step 3: amongst all the rage /g quit
---
Step 4: find new guild
---
The wowhead timeline ist notoriously bad. wowwiki lists it as implemented in 1.6. But whatever, believe what you will, nobody knows anyway.

Battle shout &gt; Demo Shout &gt; Cleave

Thunder clap in classic isn't what it was in TBC. You generate alot of threat with your shouts to start and follow up with cleave and tab-sunders.
---
Michael Jackson picking a gnome. I heard he had a thing for the little ones.
---
Depends how competitive the server is. Seeing as the gear will be more impactful it could be more difficult than vanilla.  I played on Outland / Haumarush and reached rank 13 / 11, but it was much easier on Haumarush because there were less people trying to get the higher ranks.
---
I like points 2 and 5.
---
I do hope you forgot the /s because you don't even need a full 40man group if you're fully optimized...

How hard will it be for me to find a guild as an Elem shaman?

people don't watch asmongold for bfa
---
True..the fun of farming...my friend has most if not all the dragon mounts haha. He will enjoy this.
---
In the Lock section you call the Infernal an "inferno".
---
Also, I think Priest leveling is a little underrated here. You did touch on them hitting easy street once they get a wand, but I'd rank them better levelers than mages even if they kill things slower simply because of how smooth the experience is. You're never in danger of dying, really, theres almost zero downtime between pulls, and when you feel like bursting down a couple mobs you totally can.
---
But regardless, this is a fantastic writeup and probably the most accurate priest guide I've seen on a non-specifically priest-oriented work
---
I wanna be a jerk hunter too, but only to enemy rogues in the area

---
Check out this addon for classic guild banks. this should help a ton!
---
It wasn’t that way back in vanilla why the f should it be like that now? Yes there some guilds going hardcore min maxing but the vast majority will not. I’m sorry to tell some people this but in this day anything raiding in vanilla is piss easy for the average raider maybe except for a few bosses in naxx. There are no requirements, you could probably clear all the content with 40 druids although slower.
---
So many people on this sub think theyre joining world first or even server first guilds
---
Feral isn't a meme spec though. DPS ferals can put out decent dps and offtank trash- tank spec'd ferals can tank just about anything too. Ret paladins I know of 2 guilds that regularly bring 1 ret along for Naxx. I've never once raided with a single moonkin.
---
You can travel when your done working. If you save money etg totally possible around age 40-50. Thats what Im planning to do, buy an apartment abroad and spend winters there.
---
Study Im doing now age 30 with 2 kids, its never to late to change job. Its just excuses.
---
I even got time to squeeze in classic.
---
I post on this topic a lot because my initial goal was to hit rank 10 and it's obviously hard to get a good estimate on how hard it was to hit rank 10.  My conclusion is that it seems much more difficult than many people say and I don't think it's reasonable in 2 hours a day.  
---
I have read a few in depth stories of pvpers and they mention it taking 4-5 hours of premade play a day to hit rank 10.  The people that say you can hit it casually tend to throw it out without any details.  "rank 10 hm sure 2 hours a day should do it" or "it's not hard" (very specific right?).
---
This is going to help a lot! I think my most recent song has slightly better percussion in it, so I am getting better - it's just a matter of practice and feedback. Thanks so much!
---
Great! Didnt think battle shout does good threat!
---
lol you have no idea what you're talking about. Joanna hit 22 during his Vanilla world record run in 12 hours 49 minutes so if you can hit 22 in 10 hours you've literally done the exact opposite of fucked up.
---
But you know, continue having no idea what you're talking about
---
I mean, casual guilds will definitely accept even meme specs, that's for sure and that was a thing back in the actual vanilla too. That's true.
---
However people playing meme specs should be also ready for situations when they want to join a PUG group or some more hardcore guild and they get denied many times. I feel like many people coming from retail simply don't realize this and saying something like OP does, without even mentioning how it actually works on pservers where you don't see many meme specs in raids at all, also isn't the best thing to do. I'm not saying people shouldn't play what they want, definitely not. But I'm also trying to be realistic.
---
When I'm pugging HC Palace on retail now, of course we're taking anyone who has a curve because you can clear heroic with every spec in the game easily. People should just get ready for that it's completely different in Classic PUGs.
---
Going to have to correct you on the 
---
&gt;Since Slam resets your melee swing timer, you can't 'weave' it in between auto attacks 
---
part. Chain-casting Slam is about the worst thing you can do in a PvE situation; you're missing a TON of rage generation from AAs that you would otherwise have if you performed the rotation correctly. Like u/igdub commented below, ideally you cast Slam right as you perform your AA, effectively never resetting your AA timer because you start your Slam right as the swing timer is 0.0. As you cast Slam, your AA timer goes on, so in an **ideal** scenario, you cast Slam at 0.0, 1.5s later you finish the Slam cast and you are already 1.5s into your next AA.

Is it not possible to have more than one manager role?

PÄRKELE
---
Rocket league has been a very stable always enjoyable game for me for like 3 year, I'm playing it until release and I will probably still play it sometimes casually after release. It's a great game to pair with another main game.
---
As opposed to just doing one quest over and over for four hours in vanilla for the same progress.  -_-
---
Agree to disagree I guess.
---
Thanks a lot for the videos!
---
Exactly. "Meme specs" will have trouble finding raid spots in the top 1-5% of super-hardcore guilds. The vast majority of guilds will be far more interested in a RELIABLE player above all else, regardless of spec. The bottom tier guilds will just be happy to fill a raid spot. "Meme specs" have nothing to fear, unless they think they're getting into the likes of Method.
---
Sounds like you have a cold, take 26th off.
---
I see your point, but netting 1 orb per run with a solid group is most likely worse g/hr than doing normal farming tbh. I will try going full out cancer and tank for people while reserving all greenies for disenchanting and orbs, everything to minimize time spent outside of raids. Not very nice but only way to keep somewhat of a normal life outside of the game :P
---
Yup, and it's incredibly easy to force it for exactly the scenario.
---
* 3% from talents
---
* 2% from brd quest shoulders (or ts if you're super lucky)
---
* 3% from warmonger.
---
Though admittedly, getting warmonger might be kinda rough if you're shooting for week 1 kills, but anyone else doing slightly less hardcore should be able to pick that up for very few gold, that is, if you can't afford devilsaur set.
---
r/ihatesportsball
---
So I get the sentiment and it is somewhat true (our guild isnt requiring specific racial class combos for instance) . But a raid isnt going to have 5 or 6 hunters. It just isn't. 2 to 3 max per raid is what you'll see. Why take a 4 or 5th hunter when you can take a warlock, mage, rogue, or warrior? Yes there are fights where hunters do well. Yes we bring lots of raid utility across different encounters. Yes having at least 1 if not 2 of us is essentially necessary. But finding a guild with a hunter raid slot is just plain harder unless you already have a guild organized to raid. Shadow priests are 100% in the same boat. It's easy to justify having ONE in your raid but you wont see 3, 4, or 5. In addition, some class specs are just not viable to the point where their dps or abilities might as well be an empty spot. Prot pallys, enhancement shamans, and elemental shamans (until AQ40 that is) are just a plain liability. Prot pallys dont have taunt and can pull threat like. Feral druid or prot warrior, and enhancement/elemental shaman  oth go oom too quick and have threat management issues. Boomkins and retadins are sort of an in between in that they aren't going to put out good dps, but they still bring raid utility. Feral tanks are great so that's a different story.
---
Look, play what you want. I would never discourage people from playing what makes them happy. But as a hunter myself who also has played on private servers, I would simply advise people to level-set their expectations.
---
If you get a high level alt, having a raiding main helps a ton. You essentially have a whole group of overgeared players who'll help your alt get gear by steamrolling all the 5 mans.
---
And if you get your alt to 60, your guild will also steamroll 10 man &amp; 20 mans for you. Hell, you'll probably even get your alt into an MC farm run or even a BWL farm run.

I use Ghostery tbh, works great.
---
Nope the game comes out the 29th.
---
You'll be fine. Everyone will likely be so packed together in the starting zones for the first hours that leveling then will be super slow anyways. You can catch up the day after when people are more spread out.
---
Nah the difficulty of levelling in Vanilla is more about it being tedious, it's not the end of the world to die a few times. Pretty much anyone can level in Classic, it generally takes time rather than skill - experienced players just level faster.
---
Picking a strong solo class like warlock or hunter also makes killing mobs a lot easier.
---
Yes. It's an instant attack.
---
I would say so. There's not really a set leveling speed for any class because there are a lot of variables - but a warrior playing right in the way I described isn't sacrificing damage for survivability or minimizing downtime. A shaman playing at a similar level is going to be careful with their spell usage in order to get the most out of their mana regen in order to minimize downtime, but this does come at the expense of kill speed, so they are more capped by their mana than warriors are by their health.

Brandon Eich, the creator of Javascript and former Mozilla CEO is behind this. On a couple occasions a site was broken where I had to use Chrome. Overall I'm happy with it. Ads are one thing and uBlock Origin is great and all, but the trackers and bad cookies are another thing.
---
Honestly man these are really poor solutions. "Don't do outland"? "Don't do the quests"? Seriously? That's where the players moved to. Once the level cap is increased, that's it. It's done. It's over. Anything prior to that level bracket is purged of players, and the community as a whole moves on. You don't have a choice.
---
Why are we on the classic subreddit? Why are we waiting for WoW Classic? Because the game we used to enjoy is no longer playable. It's gone. There are permanent changes with every expansion, and the community moves with them.
---
Ray tracing would be outstanding for a game like WoW. I saw how good they made the original Doom look with RT... It would make Vanilla WoW look better than modern WoW by far. Really hope they implement this!
---
Hah! I get off work 90 minutes before release. Then the next Monday is a bloody paid holiday. Go me.
---
The only thing more powerful to a raid than being a min/max'er is not being a dickhole.
---
No one wants to play with a dickhole.
---
(Well some people do I guess)
---
You don't need to totem twist 100% of the fight. But if you feel some gaps where you don't need to heal, then why not do it?
---
If it adds dps, even a low ammount, then yes, it is effective.
---
This comment is the real focus which the post ignores completely. Yes hunters can be good dps in early tiers however later in the game they are way less and if you have 48 people showing up at raid time you may be sat unless the guild needs tranq shot or you are willing to be the wing clip buff bitch. The other argument of a dwarf warrior vs a human warr is silly since having stoneform to remove debuffs is also beneficial. It is also still a warrior not a bear druid, prot pally or the meme shaman tank that this post says is acceptable. Should i bring 5 boomkins since it doesnt matter what we bring in a raid?
---
A close friend of mine was denied from several guilds in vanilla because his priest was human and not dwarf. I shit you not many of his applications came back with "not dwarf, pass", or something similar. 
---
Just think about it. Back then knowledge was hard to come by. You didn't know for sure what the best thing was. And you STILL got people getting denied because of things they couldn't have predicted. These days there's basically no excuse to not know certain class/race combos are just objectively better. If you roll a boomkin druid with the intention of raiding as a boomkin, you basically looked at all the info telling you it's a stupid af idea and decided to do it anyway. Why should a guild accept that?
---
And in the 40man raid it's all about cpu.
---
It was great, he made an alt to yell at me, then when i ignored that he sent me an in game mail. I made a copy and will keep it always.
---
Minimum 2 hunters required in AQ and beyond, guilds usually just bring 5+ as that's what was geared already. I'd prefer a well geared hunter to a crappy geared warrior taking up more melee dmg gear.
---
Indivually TBC raids are a fair bit harder than vanilla.
---
Heroics are slightly harder than vanilla dungeons, but normals are way easier than vanilla dungeons.
---
Remember to take into account that consecration costs alot of mana. especially as prot/ret due to smaller mana pool.
---
So at most you are able to cast it maybe 3-4 times before your oom. 
---
If a paladin is tanking i would fully  expect them to use a lower rank conc (to not go oom  every pull) for the extra threat generation they get from  righteous fury which only works with holy damage... and conc is their only aoe holy damage ability.
---
Or am i talking out of my butt? :F
---
And here I am trying to find a GF to play with.
---
Well Sweden has more or less always delivered plenty of pros. Especially in the cs community, from 1.6 &amp; still going strong I believe? Im not as invested in the PRO scene as I used to be :/
---
Grats! :)
---
Don't focus in raiding. If you only care about end game content don't play classic.
---
Zo ne grote vuurbal jonge!

I think i have an old GT 710 lying around.. where do you live?

This right here. 
---
My classic guild is ***planning*** on two 30 man MC raids.  Why?  We know it's easy and we'll get the guild geared up more quickly.  So the entire "you won't have a spot" attitude is laughable to me.
---
Nice, now I'm only deciding between rogue, warrior, warlock and hunter. Please send help...
---
It's really interesting to see warlocks being the most picked class just in the another poll again, over warriors, mages, hunters and rogues. I know it's only poll of a few hundred people mostly from this sub right now, but still.
---
Also, really well done guide! I'll probably use it many times until the release.
---
Wow so many negative comments here it's pretty easy though if you wanna save gold by leveling 2 shammies go ahead.
---
Also this would make farming alot easier I bet. 
---
Time is a commodity as well people tend to forget   end of the day its just 15 euro, where I'm from that's 2 packs of smokes or a trip to mcdonalds.
---
8 hours leveling in a hugely overpopulated server, so about level 5?
---
What makes a 1h weapon a "tank" weapon vs something a rogue might roll on?  My only tanking experience in wow is wotl and during thst time it was clear which swords were meant dor tanks and which were meant for dps from the stats.  Is it just something high stamina and strength  and ideally a threat generating proc?

That is the same reason that you take 1 shadow priest if you have lots of warlocks. But bringing 7 boomkins over 7 mages is never going to happen.

This video is full of comments failing to replicate this on ND and K3. 
---
You don't auto attack during the cast, and the swing timer is reset after the cast. You might see some delayed animations or something.
---
That’s fair! Thanks for the input.
---
You can’t publish the card with that glaring grammatical error.

---
Lots of people, it happened on pservers when the premades had 10 mins queues. If you are trying to farm honor, the best way is to be in a group. If you cannot find a group, then you just "join" some group by following them around. That's how it's gonna work and that's why such "premades" won't a big advantage compared to how they do in battlegrounds.
---
I've been trying to have a conversation, but apparently you just want to whine.
---
What
---
I’ve never been a part of a guild that was spreadsheet level. Don’t think I’d want to, and honestly don’t think I’d make it long before getting booted. 
---
I’ve mained a Warrior tank from Vanilla to Legion. I’d like to think I’m pretty good at it, and have been told as much often enough to believe it to be true. But I’m no where near a technically flawless tank, I don’t have perfect parses. Hell, I barely even understand what that term means. 
---
I just enjoy playing and grouping up with my bros to see if we can best some raid bosses, and the beauty of WoW is you can do that without having to have the perfect group dynamic.
---
I recommend watching Loui CKs bit about how divorce is the best part of marriage while you grind those mobs.
---
nay.
---
Torn between gnome warlock or orc shaman, depending on my friends and how i feel that day.
---
Troll shaman
---
I would avoid taking cloth from cloth wearers while leveling simply because you can heal with even the shittiest plate with int and you're not going to wear a dress while outside of a dungeon while cloth wearers will.
---
2 hours a day will definitely not do it. MAYBE if you played those 2 hours very efficiently and you took 4 months to rank, but else ? nah.
---
This is a thought I was having. Maybe it could low key make my life easier. What if I took that whole day off, and wasn't able to log in at launch because of issues and spent my whole 1st day just sitting at my computer mad.
---
Woah you are winning!
---
Might have better latency going through a VPN set to the region.
---
My friends think I’m crazy for wanting to play classic. They don’t understand how excited I am to spend 2-3 hours in a dungeon, only to MAYBE complete it. For people who didn’t play, they have no clue what the value is. They just see a time dump with little to no reward. We see experience and a good time. 
---
Beyond excited!
---
Thanks for this, man.
---
but but shardz and layerz

Name?

Being free of Americans will be great.
---
3-5 orbs per run for the group. You're not going to get many willing groupmates if you try to claim more than like 2 of them. Back on my server in vanilla, they sold for 50ish gold. It really depends on your servers economy, what content phase is out at the time, etc. Crusader is one of those enchants that's best in slot for warriors and it is available at launch so they will always be valuable.
---
Rank 10 is a 2-month grind that will require 6 hours of PvP per day minumum. During that grind, you can't do anything but PvP or else you'll fall behind so you need to make sure you get BiS dungeon items before you start.
---
Thats hilarious. I like the cut of your gib.
---
I hate to admit it but I'm really looking forward to rolling priest - if people need shit they shouldn't over anyone in my groups they ain't getting heals. Not even booted, just a repair bill. And also booted before last boss.
---
Small groups are best for World PvP farming. Never had anyone follow while doing small group farming while queued.
---
&gt;Private server veterans have been playing the game (or close enough to it) for years as recently as weeks before Classic releases.
---
Yeah, that's my point, I have seen this shit 11 years ago on Tauri with TBC and Retail TBC, private server shills said Illidan was much harder than retail but in fact a kill video was only 5 minute long whereas a retail video was at least 7 minutes.
---
The mentality we need to get rid off is that all these pserver shills envisioning 2k dps in MC and all that shit.
---
Seeing the downvotes on my comments like this makes me think this place is just a private server veteran echochamber. (Also based on the fact that PVP players are way too over-represented here.)
---
So, you're saying if I main a shadow priest and my two alts are a moonkin and ret paladin I will always get a raid spot?
---
I appreciate the sober response, so I don't have the wrong expectations. Maybe I'll go for rank 8 or something, and then see. I don't think I can spend a ton of time on it.
---
Fuck the you wont get a spot. Classic is tailored around having enough room in a raid so everyone can join and enjoy what the game has to offer. Retail is tailored around min max shit bull crap, it has become a competitive environment. Classic is not a competitive game its all about putting the MM into ORPG
---
D add
---
I'm probably going priest. Want to be a healer in PvP.
---
Yeah that's my goal now too.  Grinding for 3+ months for 30+ hours a week doesn't seem worth it.  At that rate as long as the RNG gods don't hate you, you will get better raiding gear.
---
You're not entirely wrong, but when the developers design entire content around the idea that you'll be doing it again on a higher difficulty, they make changes.
---
These dungeons are smaller.
---
These dungeons are simpler (until re-ran later)
---
These dungeons are less inspiring (Where's my post-vanilla Maraudon or BRD??)
---
But perhaps the main thing is that they just feel cheap as a player.
---
For something like re-running scholo, strat, or otherwise, you are re-running the _same_ difficulty level of the dungeon, at (roughly) the same level you first saw it at.
---
But from 60-70, you run all these dungeons, and then you hit max level and suddenly they just tell you "go do it again, but for real this time". It's like, I dunno. Unimmersive? Disappointing?
---
Scholo / Strat / (L/U)BRS / BRD were either _new_ dungeons that you got to farm for reaching a new level bracket, or dungeons you could finally get to the end of because you're finally strong enough to do so.
---
Mana-Tombs is a bland blue crypt I didn't find particularly engaging the _first_ time I saw it.
---
Wait you forgot to mention dont roll a human lock because of WOTFS! fucking idiots.
---
I've *only* played Classic. You mean raids can somehow go differently than the ways you listed?
---
I'm going to need at least 5 of those.
---
While I enjoy the sentiment and completely agree, for leveling it's not really a viable option, unless you have a bunch of friends who are ready to "sacrifice" their xp to help each other and enjoy the run.
---
If you pug dm, by the time you're ready to do bfd you'll likely be at a different level than the people you did dm with and as such you need to find new people, then repeat this for stocks every instance going forward.
---
Ya he never made it to Mr T or Chuck Norris levels
---
Cross faction collusion was 2 week ban for first offensive in vanilla.  You can't win trade in BGs, or stand an alliance and horde character on every black lotus, or work with the other faction to monopolize devilsaurs, or funnel those leathers through the neutral AH for enemy guild profit.  You're simply going to get banned.
---
Your guild and names of the monopolizers are going to be all over the server forums, players are going to lose their shit, report tickets, you'll get banned because the squeaky wheel always gets the grease.  You can't just piss off everyone overtly and expect Blizzard to not take action.  They're already hammering people for harmless crap like standing on someone elses totems.
---
&gt;Everything people say on this sub is just to have an excuse to talk about classic. They’re all excited so they say a thing they heard a youtuber say, or they want to flex their vanilla wow knowledge. None of it matters, none of it is important, and everyone will do fine even if they don’t know anything.
---
Bingo. Saving in case of deletion.
---
Theyre completely different
---
don't waste time on retail it'll just make you sad
---
Looking at his HP par, and watching it go up, just do it in the rythm

I JUST DONATED ANOTHER $5 BECAUSE ASMON DIDN'T READ MY FIRST DONATION
---
I was pointing out an ability, not advocating it. You seem to be assuming that I am advising people. The opposite. it was a warning and not just about thieves, but that Blizzard will not help.
---
The best is when you are tank/healer duo, and rule over the dps with an iron fist of justice
---
Take it at your own pace and enjoy the fresh look. Most of us returning players would love to see the world again through fresh eyes. Even if you drop it after a month you still can have a lot of fun just exploring.
---
Indeed, you'd rather run the raid with suboptimal players than not raid at all.
---
you need to be a dwarf for fear ward or you will NOT get a raid spot. 
---
\~ Thex
---
So wowwiki is wrong? I'm not saying it isn't, but I'm saying I'd be interested in a better source that says otherwise.
---
Do you lose any of your gear if you derank after you buy it at the rank it requires?
---
its not just super casual guilds, finding 40 people constantly showing up to raid nights is a struggle for every guild barring the top .1% as long as you show up and are decent you can find a spot in any guild.
---
this is the accurate post ever lol 
---
from: someone who just got back from vacation
---
You don’t even need a full 40 man if you are specifically not optimized
---
This is why I loved GW1 so much, it taught me to enjoy the experience of the game more than requiring a carrot on a stick to keep going (max gear wasn’t difficult to get). The only thing comparable really was capturing elite skills to make your build better.
---
That’s not to say I won’t want to increase my stats via new gear but that isn’t a requirement for me to enjoy myself.
---
You don't really need to min/max until naxx.
---
Druids are inferior and are only brought for MotW, no more than 1 Druid in my raid.
---
*just quoting some elitist from earlier today*
---
Sorry, moving on.
---
quit it
---
YOU WILL NOT GET A RAID SPOT
---
Exactly. The hardest part about a 40 man raid is getting 40 people together. What makes a 40 man raid run smoothly is all 40 people doing what they are supposed to do. Whatever class and race you play, the biggest factor will be “did you show up for the raid and did you do what you were supposed to?” If so, and everyone else did too, it won’t be hard.
---
I get you, but as someone that is reading similar threads for over 2 years now, ive noticed very worrying stuff...
---
"Keep the philosophy" When asked to provide specifics (which is the actual hard part) these people either simply ignore you, or if they do point specifics, we get drama all over the place between people and their problems with given ideas. The other thing that often happens are massive holes in their idea of "vanilla philosophy". I remember a guy that when pressured, his idea of  "keep the philosophy" involved Arenas and scaling gear... i mean, how silly is that?.
---
There are few issues here, people want things, everyone want something that according to them is a "change that won't affect the game".
---
Blizzard+ that community which we are supposed to trust, actually led us to BFA, why do it again instead of simply TBC/WoTLK? Why take a risk?
---
Another problem.
---
Faction balance will be severely affected if all kinds of servers are launched, this in a closed community can destroy the game, that gave us sharding and CRZ over the years, including the LFG tools etc.
---
Over the years i've seen this...
---
Classic
---
Classic+
---
TBC
---
TBC+
---
WoTLK
---
WoTLK+
---
PvP/RP/PVE/Language servers/Fresh servers, these will be needed for every version. I mean, how many people will actually play this? 10 million? Nah... it's not a new game, its a re-release. It doesn't really matter how good it is/was. 
---
Retail "failed" because blizzard tried to make everyone happy, and the day i see a "classic+" thread that doesn't consist of massive drama and arguing, then, THEN i might get hope for a potential project.
---
Thing is, people are different and this will never happen, let the museum be museum, fresh servers are enough. If people want better game, then give feedback to Retail, so we don't have to play classic in a first place.
---
just not in the top .1% of guilds FTFY
---
lure them into your windowless van with candy
---
&gt; Will be at the same time as the name creation.
---
There was a forum post confirming it realms will be revealed before the character creation date.
---
I also hit Rank 11 back in Vanilla, and don't recall it being **that** bad. I wasn't trying hard, maybe 3 hours a day of PvP. I do believe that the time investment for Rank 12 became much more steep. I am certain it varied significantly by realm/bg. Legacy PvP titles are awesome, only title my Rogue has worn in retail since I returned to the game in Legion.
---
Ya it's cheap and I couldn't imagine not using it now. I have the extra top button as a g-shift/control mod and I've bound things I would never have even considered binding before, for lack of space. 
---
Let's just say the possibilities of tiberium are limitless! I mean that mouse.
---
I can't speak for classic beta, but raiding in retail on a 2GHz i7 was actually impossible for me, we're talking drops to sub 1 fps.
---
The servers will be dead for the first few days. Wouldn’t worry about it.
---
This would make a great meme guild name
---
I can't help it. "I'm an ex top-server raider and plan to be hardcore, but I can't find simple answers to my problems and need information spoon-fed to me"
---
That's what worries you?
---
The epic class mounts also will not be available until phase 2.
---
89% Upvoted, 78 Upvotes - yet 2 Gold 2 Silver?
---
Sounds like someones trying to get some clicks for their article so they bought themselves gold. It worked, to be fair.
---
There is a retarded part of people here that really have no fucking idea how Classic will turn out. I think its the Retail Mythic Raiders, who think MC and Ony are just like Mythic Raids in Retail where everyone has to play the FotM Specc, have perfect Gear and have 99% Logs. 
---
If you are active, you will get a Raidspot. No raids until the very late end will even require 40 People. MC and Ony will be farmed by 20 People, because 40 is absolutely useless.
---
Pretty much
---
None of your examples include a ret paladin or a balance druid. I'm assuming this still applies?
---
ok... you got me there lol
---
I would not let an ele/resto heal in my raid.
---
Gamechanger from Vanilla to 2019 bro. Skip the Dishes
---
https://i.imgur.com/zHfAYK0.jpg
---
When it comes to dmg output, even w/o heirlooms it is not comparable in the slightest. 
---
The zones of vanilla&amp; retail might have the same names, but they are two different worlds in terms of quests.
---
If you want to prepare, try playing in a private server.
---
We sure didn't start that way and weren't quite "hardcore", but good enough to be a respected guild with good end-game progress. Once someone got in their head to start tracking things on spreadsheets and use them to push certain optimizations it changed things for the worse. The game started being much less fun. I say this as an engineer who can fully appreciate efficiency and optimization and certainly knows my way around MS Excel. I don't want the things I do for fun to *need* a spreadsheet.
---
Not at all. 4 bucks? So fucking worth
---
maybe for the very very top level guilds, spots are definitely not highly contested though, its hard as fuck to fill 40 of them.
---
There was a thread about launching the game in sand box mode to test out all you UI, and mods. So you don't even need to have a sub, or bother with server instability/downtimes etc. 
---
I'm just going to do it on the fly. Feels better to slowly add abilities while I level up. Mods are probably going to be made/updated during the first few months anyway. Is it the best way to do it? No probably not. I just like doing it that way.
---
Blizz only lets one copy of each hot. So two different druids swiftmend, only the strongest sticks. They are good aside from that mess.
---
That means you actually have to leave your keyboard to pick up the delivery!
---
My roommates are bringing my food/drinks on demand. Living the good life.
---
No they are not. Bindings were not on the loot tables until the BWL patch and will not be in Classic until the appropriate phase as per Blizzard’s progressive itemization explanation.
---
Paladins dont have decurse. They have cleanse which removes magical debuffs, only priests could do that too.
---
Only druids and mages were able to decurse.
---
This \^\^\^\^
---
thex on the beach
---
Proc specs became more powerful as armor values increased with better gear. A TF rogue playing combat or hemo could annihilate in PvP, so TF is certainly extremely valuable for that side of the game. Plenty of videos out there demonstrating this, but Akrios 2 comes to mind.
---
Oh, I misunderstood what you meant by cartel.  Nothing.  That's how Magtheridon was, like 80% Alliance by the time TBC rolled out.
---
GM would tell you PvP problems, PvP solutions.  You'd have to be on a PvE server or a guild of night owls to compete.
---
I see what you mean now.
---
a ton of well established guilds in legion fell a part because of roster issues, at least on the server I was on.
---
Don't. It'll bore you and ruin the experience.
---
Rather read up on a few guides and maybe check the locations yourself with your main in retail wow. If you really want to.
---
I'm not going to follow a guide. I plan to group level with random people. even if it mean doing quests I've already completed to catch up my party members. I'm going to socialize while leveling and have fun meeting new new people as I play.
---
This is a great guide for a new player (like me), thanks!
---
Now to decide whether alliance or horde Warlock. I want to roll a gnome but racial abilities sound good on horde. Thoughts?
---
Yeah, what this guy said. All those examples from the past of servers being buttfucked into oblivion by streamers cannot happen if you just don't go on youtube.
---
Upset that your realms population just decreased by 90% in a single night? It's all good man, just '''don't let it effect you''''
---
Also, I think there will be a lot more druids in classic than vanilla
---
Troll and Dwarf don't even need all that.
---
I'm just in it for drunk ZG and AQ20.
---
It's certainly possible I'm wrong, but me and like 20 others from my guild left to form our own during the week of bwl release, one of the people who didn't want to join our new guild got the garr binding in a raid I attended, so it would've had to have dropped for us the exact week of 1.6 release.
---
You'll be able to launch the game before "Launch." The "Enter World" buttons will be gray until they flip the switch. Once the realm is available the button will switch to red and you'll be able to join immediately. 
---
This is exactly how the last stress test worked.
---
Exactly.  If anyone did everything on this list, they would never raid with you again.  But every raid, out of 40 people, you had at least a couple of these.   And sometimes you were embarrassed as hell, because it was you.
---
I was a hunter lead and in AQ40, we were in the middle of a twin emps attempt when I ran out of ammo.  I couldn't believe I'd forgotten to check.  It was the first time I'd ever forgotten to stock up before a raid.
---
The totem twisting enhancement shaman still heals. Just with improved totems.
---
I mean. He's not even auto attacking. He's just sitting there waiting to be killed.
---
There is pretty much nothing you can do unless you want to attempt the run. Human and dwarf starting zones will likely be worse though.   Layering might help but we'll see.
---
Just need a Chuck Norris reference.
---
Bring back the office memes, those were gold.
---
Not sure what the spawns are gonna be like and how hard the mobs hit, but on private servers “the relics of awakening” is really tough to solo, and if you do manage to fight your way through the mobs the 4x items you need to collect take quite a while to spawn
---
Thats one word for it, lol
---
This post is correct, but I think you go to far in the opposite direction.
---
In the end it will come down to the state of your realm. If you end up on a low-mid pop realm because tourists left after phase 1, then yes, you will likely have to get what's thrown your way. But don't believe for a second that your Elemental Shaman or Ret Paladin will have an easy time finding a raidspot on a healthy realm.
---
Oscar Wilde, Dante Alighieri, Martin Luther. All these people produced life changing works while imprisoned or captive in some way. 
---
and fuck your extremist trolling.
---
For what? I feel like all these points are pretty obvious and any random commenter would come to the same conclusion.
---
I got to rank 11 as well, mounting the black war raptor on my troll mage was one of the best feelings i had in vanilla :)
---
Yeah guess I won't be participating during the crunch hours.
---
#7 Especially. The little NPC battles and other clutter all over the place in various zones in modern WoW really detract from the feeling of peaceful exploration. That stuff was supposed to make the zones feel "alive," but it didn't really work, and detracted from the atmosphere.  It'll be very good to have the old zones back.
---
Don’t let your dreams be memes. Go out there and get it. The best/most reliable rogue might be like 3rd prio on TF.

hmmm, would anyone think this is the date they "announce" a realm list? doing research for my guildies. Blizz has been silent about the realm list and it's getting closer to name reservation day.
---
S.phuk
---
Weird, that’s my char name
---
A mouse and keyboard helps too.
---
You arn't wrong buts that's so nitpicky. I can't think of a boss in mc off the top of my head that doesn't have a magical effect to "cleanse". So who cares what the fuck ever the button is called. It still needs to be smashed as hard as possible lol. Plus the add-on that removed debuffs for all classes was decursive so it's all decursing to me.
---
It's peak gaming hours for Europe.  Just because it's not YOUR peak hours doesn't mean it's not a valid stress test.
---
You forgot replacing your gaming chair with a flush able toilet.
---
My main concern is that you lvl holy, in dungeons you roll on cloth int gear, because not much mail int gear, clothes will they allow it? You roll on mail str gear for lvling, tanks will they allow it?
---
Because it benefits me.
---
I don’t know about the most comprehensive written guide, but it is a great one!
---
Slaughtered Lamb is one of the few reasons as to why i would want to play an alliance toon, it's just such an awesome warlock's hub.
---
ps: the other reasons is Stormwind's park.
---
you assume there's a shortage of rogue, warrior and mage...
---
look, if you want to raid as the cheerleader spec, it's fine... you have 2 options : be a popular streamer ( esfand) or get rid of those gag reflex... but enough with the '' MC can be 20-manned, so why won't you carry me?''
---
I used to run a logitch mouse with 4 side buttons but it died recently and they have stopped making them. Found a second hand n600 for €25 that I am picking up tomorrow. Ask again on Sunday. :)
---
We dropped Bosses back in the days with everyone discussing whether to use Int or Spell Damage on their weapons. With 5 Affliction Warlocks (one of them didn't get her pet and forgot to buy spells). With a Priest bombing the raid 5 times in a row (!) at Geddon. With a Feral Druid. And an army of Elemental Shamies. 
---
But.. today, I'm not so sure about your post. On a hardcore level where people can acutally play it might not matter. But in a PUG, eveyone will go looking for those Mages and Rogues while telling Oomkings, Rets and other Meme specs to wait if they find a better class.
---
MOM BAFFROOM BAFFROOOOM!!
---
The thought of spending an hour before raid farming soul shards puts me off ever going back to a lock in classic.
---
“Tree” instead of “three” when talking about shaman specs

TL;DR just play what you want and play with who you want, and you'll have no problem being accepted no matter what you're playing.

You are a saint and a scholar, thank you for the urgent reminder
---
You dont understand proc rates in vanilla.  The proc % is normalized for weapon speed.  Slower weapons have higher proc rates, which makes them better because it is a higher proc when you account for abilities.
---
I dont remember the math exactly, but the DS proc rate was almost double when using the xbow of smiting vs the needler or whatever due to abilities and the normalized proc rate
---
Also interested in this.
---
The thing is that it does not really matter how much honor you get when it comes to ranking up. What matters is how much honor you gain compared to the other players on your realm and faction. Basically the top 0.03 % honor earners get the most contribution points (which are used to calcuate which rank you get), so it won't really matter that the # of honor points is low since everyone else will have just as difficult time getting that honor. [Here's an in-depth explanation of how the honor system worked in vanilla and how it will work in Classic](https://www.powerupguides.com/2019/05/guide-classicvanilla-honor-system.html). I suggest reading that if you intend to try for a higher rank.

I've been happy with my Razer Trinity.  It comes with replaceable panels with 12, 8, and 2 buttons accessible to the thumb. I switch between mmos, strategy, and action games and I've found to actually use the different attachments based on the type of game I'm playing. However, if you are only playing mmos then i've heard the button placement of the dedicated 12 button mouse is slightly better though.
---
I second this.  As a 19yr old idiot back in vanilla I had the blue Helm and Shoulders as a hunter; must have been Rank 10?  I do not recall playing nearly as long in PVP as others are suggesting and I never backslid in rank either. 
---
I remember once I finally hit R10 I only had enough gold to buy the helm and shoulders because.... once again, I was an idiot and didn't know how to make money :)
---
Interested to see how far I can get this time but not looking forward to waiting for the queues.
---
Haha well I had to sell it didnt I?:D either way, I do think it's the biggest guide that focus on broad strokes out there. There are insane leveling guides and stuff but that not what this one is about :-) 
---
&gt; Why do you only have 1 tranq shot?
---
Tome of Tranq Shot drops off Lucifron. First week would mean only one Tome.
---
Good luck finding a raid spot.
---
Zones feel alive if there are actual other players in them. Something they removed.
---
I gilded him. I just appreciate all the effort and want to reward people actually posting content instead of tired memes.
---
I got rank 10 on nost without even trying. Got there just casually running AV for my offhand and the occasional world pvp. Really not hard at all.
---
Over a full resto shaman, I wouldn’t either. But if I need another healer and that’s what’s available, definitely. They’re missing Mana Tide, but that doesn’t seem like enough of a liability pre-AQ.
---
Ty!
---
Oh, well there is that. Thanks kind sir
---
Level 6 after 30 minutes is literally top tier speedrunning time.
---
Good for you. You’ll feel better soon bud.
---
[Here's a list of how much Rating Points you need for each rank in Classic](https://www.powerupguides.com/2019/05/guide-classicvanilla-honor-system.html). It's not that big of a differece between R10 and R11, but the problem is that the weekly 20 % decay really being to feel noticeable at this point. But getting to R11 for the mounts is pretty doable, but you must be prepared to push a lot the last few weeks imo.
---
If you're only going to use mail/plate as a holy paladin, you're going to be a shit holy paladin. 
---
As a healer you care about stats and not armor value... unless its pvp that is.
---
But seriously, ganking multiboxers is really easy.
---
This. Also there will be a massive difference between PvP and PvE servers. You need a certain number of honorable kills in a week to be part of the rank calculations (15 maybe?) which will include large portions of the PvP server populations and a much lower number of people on the PvE servers.
---
Ok, then it's probably a bad idea to track attendences that way. Anyways - it's a great tool and if everyone in my future guild uses Discord I'll suggest it. :)
---
Because tranq shot isn't learned from a class trainer, it's a tome that drops from the first boss.
---
No idea what you are talking about Hunters have 0 mana issues with talents, mana pots, demonic ruins and buffs....it's literally not even worth mentioning.
---
When people (rightfully) ask if joining a server with streamers would be detrimental to their experience, they obviously aren't talking about you and your 5 viewers. What impact could you possibly have that a guild couldn't? They are talking about streamers with a viewcount that has been shown countless times in the past to be catastrophic for the average player, not ''annoying'', catastrophic and game-breaking.
---
Mageblade.
---
No, you can't depend on gear at all in preparation for a week one kill, ESPECIALLY a random world drop.
---
3% from talents, 3% from using literally any Bow/Gun, and bam, you're hitcapped.
---
THIS\^
---
&gt; I understand that speculation, but I think we will look back on this and clearly settle on Tauren as the better PvP race. 
---
As i said before, we'll wait and see, saying CLEARLY settle on Tauren as the better PvP race is hyperbolic/biased behaviour.
---
&gt; Even looking at it now, mathematically speaking its strictly better to be a Tauren 75% of the time
---
This is not how reality works, you cant think of it his way. Imagine you are fighting a Paladin, you either resist HoJ or you dont, increase melee range doesnt offer you anything. Any battle could have been won by resisting a stun, however battles can also have been won beacuse you got 1 or 2 more auto attacks of because of your increased range.
---
Its all relative to what situation comes up, you cant just say that its better to be a Tauren 75% of the time. Maybe you go up against a rogue that cant deadzone kite you as well as pserver duelserver pros, if you resist a few stuns thats a won battle over increase melee range. Maybe you fight more rogues than mages that day? How about that 75% then? Its impossible to set a number on that like you have.
---
&gt; That wasnt the case on pservers servers as Tauren offered zero benefit other than Warstomp every two minutes 
---
Taurens have increase hitbox/range on pservers servers.
---
You are confused mate, I'm not argue ng that BRE was usefull or BiS in vanilla, I'm staying that it was never BiS.
---
I want to play ret but sure i dont wanna get stuck with a piece of shit too, so ill roll rogue
---
Actually, the official osrs twitch account was the first to switch.
---
I wanted to not have to work Christmas. Is that so hard to ubderstand?
---
That is not Vanilla.
---
REEEE NO RETS NO MATTER HOW GOOD
---
Esfand would be the happiest boi
---
To each their own.  If your perspective works for you, I respect the heck out of it.
---
I’m sure that the ret pallies would enjoy it.
---
Basically how the rank system works:
---
Every week you gain points depending on your standing. The highest standing the more points. The amount of points per honor goes down the more honor you say 10 hours a week maybe gives you 8k, but 125 hours gives you 13k. 
---
Every week doing the reset the system calculates how much you gain, you first lose 20% of your current points, then the amount you got this week is added. So the higher rank you get, the more points you lose weekly. On the lower ranks it's not that big a deal, but once you get high rank it becomes quite heavy and you start having requirements to reach a certain standing before you even gain anything. 
---
At rank 9 you lose 7k points weekly. The maximum points you can get is 13k, to get 8k points or more you have to be top 6% of honor gainers, in that case you will only get 1k points (which is 1/5 of a rank). 
---
So basically what I am saying is, if you play a couple of hours a week and that is enough for you to get top 6%(which granted sounds high but remember most people aren't actually trying, they just randomly get 15hk and qualify), then you can very slowly hit rank 10. But you would never be able hit 11 or higher with that few points.

That's not kiting, that's using a pathing exploit that was later fixed.

Login during the stress test and setup it up.

Honor without BGs is hard because with BGs the good premades can just farm BGs in under 10 minutes and get way more honor than anyone else. This way the best premades could even have their weekly honor "done" after 4-5 days of ranking and have 2 free days. With world PvP only a guy without any friends that just ganks 24/7 can get the same honor as the would be premades. That makes it way harder for the premade tryhards to get bracket 1.
---
It's less "how long" but how much you want to invest weekly. The more you invest the quicker it happens. But as you decay very rapidly you can't just keep going with the same hours.
---
TM vs SS battles will not be very active tbh.

Just a minor mistake in the Druid section, It says:
---
‘Restoration: Improves and perfect the druids healing capabilities to become the ultimate healing-over-time support class of Vanilla WoW’
---
It should say ‘improves and perfects’ it’s just missing the s.
---
Dude.
---
Yeah, no point "deciding" now when it would change 10 times before the release.
---
It takes 12 weeks of basically being #1 to get rank14 from scratch. 
---
But yeah we don't know how long the phases will last, but remember phase is BWL. If we start at patch 1.2(mara) then on blizzlike timeline there was 7 months until BWL came out.
---
Healer is your main spec
---
There’s a chance you’ll be designing your character the same time you reserve your name, as name reservation may just be via the in-game client and then “Enter World” is greyed.
---
If it’s the case you can obviously delete and recreate at launch but that would run a risk.
---
Wasn't he the one who commented not the OP?
---
Is Icy Veins a good place to find accurate builds? I’m planning to tank and have 0.00% interest in dpsing, but I’ve mostly been a paladin and am not familiar with the warrior tree. 
---
From what I remember in TBC, there was a pretty cookie cutter Prot pally build with only 5 or so free points. Is it the same for warrior? Also, Icy veins is showing that some talents are only good on paper and some of the Prot builds there have several talents than only have 1 or two points in them (like imp shield block).
---
Is there a skeleton protection build out there with points invested only into must have talents?
---
I agree. I’ve “decided” a few times now.
---
No, it's a Classic thing too. Everyone was in a world chat channel on the beta.
---
Probably under a minute. I know what face and hairstyle I am going with.
---
One of two things are going to happen. The server you are on will be heavily populated and there will be plenty of raid group to where any spec should be able to find a home. Or, your server will have a lower population and you’ll get in regardless of spec because everyone needs warm bodies. 
---
The servers aren’t ever changing.  Eventually everyone is going to be on their second or third character and nobody is going to give a shit about optimal classes.
---
Even at 5% crit, deep wounds and imp overpower offer significantly more damage than cruelty if you don't clip the dot (and that's not even an issue for imp overpower.). Like "by the time you have 3 points in deep wound, imp overpower is providing you about 90% more damage than cruelty, per point. "
---
Furthermore, imp overpower and deep wounds stack with each other. So as soon as you take the plunge and put the first point in (which is not even worse than cruelty other than the rage generation), you go from "slightly better than cruelty, to "much better than cruelty". 
---
Cruelty does offer significant rage generation, which is very useful super early on.... but frankly, I would not delay sweeping strikes by 5 levels for it and I certainly would not max it before improved rend, which is the strongest it will ever be from 10-13, and still better than cruelty until you are fighting level 15 mobs and not reapplying rend (Which means you are probably level 16-17. Even if you can KILL a level 15 mob at 13, you are probably reapplying rend to do it).
---
The people who say "You won't get a raid spot if you're not a (Dwarf Priest for example)" are the people who probably never actually played vanilla. 
---
I was raiding MC and BWL in mostly Blues and some Greens as a holy paladin when I was like 15 years old, clicking my spells. The only addons I had were Titan Panel, Damage Meters, and deCursive. 
---
I then later started to raid on a 30/0/31 Rogue in similar gear and did just fine. 
---
You will find a raid spot no matter what race/class/spec you play. 
---
Make that boomkin. Make that ret pally. Make that ele shaman. You'll get to raid. 
---
Might not get into Naxx, but you will see pretty much all other content in the game.
---
6 hours, and if you are minmaxing then you can easily get them. You just time when the last buff happened(very easy to tell because everyone afks in org and buff duration tells you exactly when it was popped), then you log on an alt 6 hours later and scout thrall for lvl60's who look like they are about to turn it in, quickly log on main with high IQ SSD and you get the buff. This is how pserver players used to do it before they removed the cooldown.
---
Already exists for Classic: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg
---
That addon plus world chat and your realm Discord means the days of waiting in a city and spamming LFM/LFG will never exist in Classic.
---
4 warriors, 1 priest/shammy is all we really need
---
I think it was pretty mixed on that one.  I don't think everyone wanted 96 hour AV matches.  That's cool though, you spread your little propaganda, maybe you can spin it into a YouTube outrage video and get Asmongold to watch it.
---
How hard was it to get into 5 mans ?  There’s less space to hide when your accountable for 30% of the groups dps and utility is more muted because you don’t get to scale, but the fights are a lot shorter and you can cheese it later on
---
Very fast leveler 
---
Leveling: 3/10
---
🤔
---
it's not a hard concept.
---
Ignorance of game should not be followed by preaching on reddit. 
---
Tranq shot is not taught by a trainer.......
---
It is dropped by Lucifron...... so in week 1 after only 1 Lucifron kill..... you will have only 1 tranq shot. 
---
You are welcome.
---
This best be a joke or a way of testing if people will actually like old AV. But I feel like they just spit in my face.
---
Lol this is kind of funny, but I doubt the retail version will be closer to original AV.
---
Finally a voice of reason on here, nice break from the min/max fidget spinners.
---
.... unless you're an Oomkin or Retadin of course.
---
I don’t think that’s 100% accurate as people were able to gather bindings in MC but not the elementium to forge with until BWL was released.
---
uhh not really comparable duskwood and redbridge are more like stonetalon mtns and 1k needles. it is nice in the barrens because it goes to early 20s but you cant just quest in barrens from 12-22 without going into contested zones.
---
I'm not 100% on the exact date, but even if it was in the prepatch, wouldn't that still technically be "Vanilla"?  It was before BC dropped. :P
---
I used to (later on) ride the epic kodo with my mage - totally stupid looking but totally awesome, too :)
---
Thanks for that video, great to see actual evidence.
---
However, I very much disagree with your assessment of the necessity of hamstring kiting. I've leveled...6 now I think warriors to 60, I only ever lean on HS kiting when dealing with over leveled quest mobs, for the most part I find it not worth the hassle, certainly not "vastly harder" to level a warrior without using the technique.
---
You can get it reliably as alliance with a bit of coordination and a second account. 
---
The real difference is that ally is stronger, but horde can get MC'ed and get full pala buffs, though they only last 15 mins so on short speedruns horde has advantage.
---
Hey /hypotheticalgorithm I’ve thought about this a-lot... 
---
It turns out, having Goblin engi AND Gnomish engi is the best. /s 
---
But really, for a min maxed warrior (with a successful raid guild) you will have access to the guild Alchemist to send herbs too, the guild enchanter to get enchants from, and the guild BS to get LH/Titanica/Anni/what ever from.
---
Hopefully you have a level 50+ alt w/ mining/herb for BS runs for arcanes and BL’s.
---
Also youl have a 20+ warlock for summons... level him to 30 for 300 alch if youd like..
---
So with access to max mining, max herb, max ench, max alch, max bs.... this leaves us w/ pure damage or effectiveness minmaxing ONLY.
---
Asfaik nothing besides Engi gives you such direct dps boosts/survivability/skill capped utility.
---
So what comes to mind as the absolute endgame be all 2nd profession...
---
 Blacksmithing offers the fear break item(it does not take a trinket slot!). My fave r14 warrior on a ps i still play on swore by it. This item is great for non warrior classes minmaxing for endgame pve and pvp as well. There is naxx trash this is v useful with.
---
A smaller benefit of having bs is direct access to elemental sharp stones.. these will be bis all thru to naxx if you get tired of farming the undead ap stones. (Tbh its easier to farm ele earth then the naxx ones)
---
The other thing id mention...  the trinket from enchanting... ?
---
So tbh if you have all the other proffs covered thru alts.. guildies... 2 accounts.. then really Engi/BS seems like the tits...
---
Savage! haha
---
It really is. Also, having an undergeared warrior can really make you feel the 'grass is always greener' sentiment when faced against other classes in pvp or just not being as geared as your peers. I keep going back to warrior myself. I wont have time to gear up quickly, so I'll have to make concession here and be okay with the blues I'll be rocking for a long time. Another thing to consider is the content release. Most people will be undergeared for a while anyways, or still leveling up by the time phase 2 hits. Even by phase 3 some people will still be collecting preraid gear. You're not always going to be the most geared and hardest hitting warrior, but if you make it to 60 in phase 1, you'll have plenty of time to ear up and master your class. 
---
And on the point of shaman vs warrior leveling, shaman is significantly faster. Heals and ghost wolf alone are huge. With a shield and 1h you can take on multiple mobs, and even hold your own against elites while questing, your kiting abilities are really nice.
---
Totaly disagree with you there.  
---
Imo, the need/greed system is exactly as it states in the names.  
---
Need an item for the role you perform? Press need.
---
Ofc, you can be a considerate human being (aka non-asshole) and pass some items that are only marginally better for you but a huge upgrade for someone els.  
---
In the end that's up to you, but not needing on an item that you "need" for you to perform your duties only because of some PC madness is total bullshit.
---
Also, stating that "while leveling it doesn't matter" is total horseshit.  
---
You play the game from lvl 1 to lvl 60 and then some. Some people seem to think the leveling process is just to teach you the game... IT IS THE GAME. And it matters as much as you put value in it.  
---
If someone rushed to 60 because they think endgame is the coolest1337 place to be, They probably don't care to much about an lvl 23 blue chest.  
---
If someone plays the game to have fun whilst leveling, they might value it more.
---
Not everyone has to think about the game the way you think about the game, doesn't give anyone/you a reason to flame. (rant ending here, sorry :P)
---
Revery you are the bomb. Can’t wait to watch this at home. Keep on keepin on :)
---
It depends on how the PvP servers organize themselves. If they win trade or kill trade it's against the ToS but if they plan a PvP encounter at certain times and zones it shouldn't be right?
---
We have peaked and there's still 3 weeks to go.

Shamans are a really fun class to play in PVP, but they're much better as a caster class than as a melee class. Elemental is very strong, and if you try to make enhancement work I think you'll really just end up wishing you were a warrior, even with the bonus utility.
---
Is it leveling PVP you're concerned about? I do think shamans will have an edge just by having ghost wolf and self-healing. If you really want to give yourself some more utility in WPVP while your leveling as a warrior, I highly recommend alchemy. It'll be some extra effort leveling it up in the early zones, but having rage and health potions will level the playing field in PVP, and some of the buffs you get will noticeably improve your grinding speed.

IGN: Wow classic - 6/10, too much water.

Your raid scoring seems a bit wonky.    Like protection paladins.   They're more or less totally useless in raids, so how are they a 3?   How is that not a 1?

If memory serves, it wasn't a linear progression from rank to rank in terms of time commitment. As in, rank 10 -&gt; rank 11 was much worse than rank 9 -&gt; rank 10. And it got harder and harder as you progressed, which is why rank 14 was so insanely hard, whereas rank 10 was much more common.
---
ERROR: It's not about you, it's about me, I promise! (WOW61969696)
---
Every dedicated player knows this, but your description is also a simplified lie. Even casual guilds will not tolerate people putting out less than half of their expected contribution just because they wish to play what they want. 
---
Your rant is just encouraging people to be stupid and expect to be included anyway. 
---
Also maybe under the correct conditions your hunter topped do’s in BWL, but if that happens after your guild is in mostly BWL gear, then your hunter is exceptional and your guild is bad. 
---
Stop fighting ignorance of one kind with a variety or your own ignorance.
---
Sure it is! It's from Vanilla WoW after the 2.0 Patch hit, but *before* TBC launched. I was still clearing Naxx at this time. Essentially, it was a tiny window where we had 2.0 talents but still chilling at the level 60 cap.
---
you're my herocw no matter what they say
---
I think it really depends on your server's PvP population.  But rank 10 can be "casually" done.  You just need to make sure you're never in honor decay and eventually you keep ranking up.
---
If this Data is saying it took them months and playing 16 hours a day.  I did the Rank 11 grind twice (well I did get Rank 10 on my rogue, decayed quite a bit and then decided to go for Rank 11).  All this while raiding in a Naxx clearing guild and going full time to college and not failing out.  If his comparative 16 hours a day.  We were doing Naxx 3+ days a week.  Between my classes, sleeping 6-8 hours, raiding, PvP.  There's no way I was going 16 hours a day.  
---
I know there were the top players doing the 16 hours a day, but you're REALLY getting into this huge jump in time vs weekly rating.
---
Looks like feralas
---
I feel these people who say rank 10/11 was hard, must have been on an ultra competitive PvP ranking server.
---
I don't make friends with people who repeatedly try to take advantage of others.  That's not a circle I would like to be a part of.
---
Yeah that's true, but I was thinking in terms of what fraction of the dps comes from my weapon and what comes from AP. I'd wager that I get a lot more from my weapon if I keep a current dungeon blue one up compared to 60.
---
Not sure I follow - at 5% crit, Deep Wounds should increase your damage by about 1% per point, same as Cruelty. You need to deal with a DoT and no extra rage though. That doesn't look significantly better to me.
---
What is this debuff limit?
---
If your highest DPS was a hunter, your mages, warriors and rogues are all retarded and don't know what they are doing, or hilariously undergeared. We dont need your anekdotes, the numbers speak for themselves and that is why hybrid class DPS is called memespecs.
---
Sounds like a fantastic all nighter for you EU fellows
---
If you can hit rank 10, you could do rank 11.  I just seem to remember getting to 11 took a few weeks of grinding.  Getting the earlier ranks of 1-7 went by quick as long as you were ranking high.
---
We could be mastering skills; learning languages, not dancing on the bank in .org. Progressing careers not professions.
---
No, it really isn't. Every class was reworked, especially the talent trees, and you had access to 41-point talents. Those 42 days should be included in TBC, not Vanilla, and anything that happened during them is not relevant to Classic at all.
---
Well, he was clicking his way to r11 couldnt have been that competitive :-)
---
Can be interpreted either way!
---
All the power to you to roll PvE server but I can’t suggest PvP enough :D it changes the way leveling feels. I personally could not quest for 240 hours and not kill those scum bag alliance. There’s something magical about killing someone for no reason, knowing someone, somewhere just sighed. Then moments later a rogue opens me and I sigh. And the circle of life continues.
---
Another heavy Warlock poll. I swear two months ago nobody wanted Warlock. My snowflake status is in jeopardy.
---
Just a few levels away from helms. So close.
---
So hyped that people will be dropping hunter due to the freezing trap/scatter shot nerfs! Less competition for me woot
---
Your C:/Program Files/World of Warcraft folder [should look like this](https://i.imgur.com/NnTTqz4.png)

_classic_

_retail_

folders for the separate games.
---
\Interface\Addons will be in the _classic_ folder for classic addons

He is just another good reading posts and trying to sound like he has real experience.
---
I'll stick with my Undead brethren.

Link?

most of all #2
---
Nah just stupid I wanted to play a resto druid for pvp I ganked everyone I saw.  I was way more into guildwars back then
---
How many NA vs EU servers do you expect for wow classic there, professor? A proper stress test should stress the server stability. It makes little sense to beg people to log on while planning the test at the worst possible time for the largest group of players.
---
God damnit, now I'm once more torn between Warrior or Warlock!
---
Great guide!
---
I feel like deciding what other people should/will enjoy is a mistake. If their enjoyment comes from the number of maxed toons instead of the number/difficulty of raids completed or highest rank in PVP, they should roll that rested xp like a boss!
---
The world don't move to the best of just one drum. What might be right for you may not be right for some.
---
Welp it will start here on the midnight from 26th to 27th.
---
So I will have to only work monday from 9am til 1pm. After it I go shop, then I would only have to go for work on the 2nd of sept 4pm.
---
Hahahahahah cant waiiiiit
---
Yes, everything you say is true. Why discuss how to beat bad players though? Just hit buttons that make some kind of sense and you’ll beat bad players.
---
Ironforge IS home. No other place have I idled more or checked my mailbox more often.
---
So I can't say this with 100% certainty but I believe they'll be the same. The beta had a different path to the addons folder because it was a separate download. The stress test seems to use the actual live game client.
---
What part of the tos bans win trading?
---
Probably WISH.
---
This post gave me PTSD...
---
Is 225 dps low for undergeared players?  People are talking about going into MC with people under 60 even.
---
I was going to downvote, but I was stopped by my giggle.
---
First time wow player here. Gonna be a blast or at least entertaining for a little while for those without games to play.
---
Where I work it's illegal to demand personal information as a pre requisite to using earned vacation time.
---
A lot of fun if you like to PvP
---
If it makes you feel better, if you ever switch to resto or ele Tauren is an amazing choice for the warstomp stun in between casts! And as enhance you are going to look like a beast with any two handed weapon
---
hooray, now you have to get buff and impress all the dudes
---
I started a death knight.  Just trying to see if I can get a good run at MC before classic.
---
From someone who hit Rank 11 on my main (rogue) and alt (priest) I would say you can do it.  I'd say you can get into that 8-9 range pretty casual, it will take a while.  But you'll have to buckle up for a few weeks and put in some more time to push in the 10-11 range.  More so on the 11 range. 
---
It's all relative to your server.  In theory, you could get Rank 14 playing 2 hours a week, but everybody else on your server would need to play 2 hours a week.  You need to figure out how try hard the top players are going and adjust to that.
---
Rank 11 doesn't require you to be #1 every week, it just makes you get there faster.  There are breakpoints where you will decay/lose standing.  But as long as you stay above that breakpoint (all based on server rankings and that breakpoint raises the higher your rank is) you will gain rank every week.
---
They respawn really fast on beta, like &lt;5secs.  It the quest is still hard af. Def want a solid group to venture in there.
---
You are not prepared
---
I guess I'm looking for the cost/reward.  I know it will be faster, but is the degree to which it is faster worth the time to get there.
---
For example, planes are faster than cars.  But it's faster to drive from Seattle to Yakima than to fly, because by the time you get through TSA, you could have already arrived.  So is it better to just farm instead of sink the time into raiding (drive from Seattle to Yakima) or is it worth the initial investment to fly from Seattle to Miami.
---
If you have never FD trapped or FD drank in emergency situations in raids then please stop inserting yourself into conversations. 
---
You should never be FF drinking during fights, it is a huge dps loss and fights are not that long. 
---
You have consumables to aid in mana issues and you are fully raid buffed. 
---
But FD does remove you from combat in 1.12. 
---
Asking for evidence of something people have been doing for over 10 years is just a kids reaction to not understanding the actual mechanics.
---
lol'd at The Smiths reference.
---
I think Lucifron (not that he's hard lol) is actually easier with less people. During Vanilla launch my guild had a bit of trouble with Luci with 40 people but when we first killed him we had 27 and some people weren't even level 60.
---
If you don't want to be a "meme spec enhance shaman" you should probably listen to Holder. \^\^
---
I would most likely have one character farming, yes.  Maybe more if there were specific farms I felt like doing.  For example, a Mage, a Rogue, and a Hunter all have different farms.
---
I haven't really considered passive income.  At this point I'm just planning on going dual gathering on everything.  I don't know if that would change when I have more 60s.  That's another investment of time and money to powerlevel a profession.
---
Classic will be dead by the end of this year.  Obviously this is Blizzards fault. It's clear they're sabotaging classic in every decision they take. Even now they still refuse to listen to what the community wants. Personally, I cannot say I am suprised by their decisions. It's obvious they have been setting up classic WoW to fail. Here's why: 1) They obviously see retail and as the superior version and the one that brings daddy Activision all the money (microtransactions are a big part of this). Since they cannot implement microtransactions into classic as they do in retail and  milk it as much as possible, it's clear they don't care about it as much. 2) J.Allen.Brack is still bitter towards what happened 3 years ago. He was made a fool out of everyone for what he said at Blizzcon. He was memed and mocked for years until this day.  Why shouldn't he use his position of power to undermine classic and prove to everyone that he was right -  people don't want classic - "You think you do, but you don't". - J.Allen.Brack.
---
In other words. Blizzard has clearly set up classic for failure, since this will allow them to have legitimacy over the community in terms of what is/isn't right in hopes of dissuading the old school players ONCE AND FOR ALL whle also  maintaining retail WoW stable and healthy. 
---
Do you  really think they don't feel threaten by the fact that, somehow, there's the chance that retail ends up in shambles because people prefer a 14 year old version of the game? What would that do to their reputation and profits? Imagine blizzard-activision being blue balled by the community and not being able to implement their lovely microtransactions into a succesful game.
---
This was my concern.
---
I think you needed mods to actually show correct key binds on your hot bars.  I know that was an option on CTmod in vanilla.
---
You just made up half of those scenarios.
---
How can you critisice someone for wanting two of something that you want one of. Get real.
---
Mutant Cave Crickets
---
Woah chill bud it was a joke
---
Is this not how everyone plays?
---
Warlocks never have trouble finding raid spots alliance side anyway!
---
The word I’d use for those people are “jerks”.  A circle of them would be a circle jerk.
---
I agree with your perspective, but I like to add it a bit of world PvP here and there. Enduring the Vietnam of WoW (STV) is a part of the experience, as much as roaming calmly through the plains of Mulgore or Westfall.
---
It's hilarious how the company that made the greatest MMORPG of all time destroyed the MMO part in their own creation.
---
&gt; FD/drink doesn't work in raids.
---
It definitely does work.
---
Thanks for proving you have no idea what you're talking about.
---
don't get me wrong, i have FAR better, i just found it amusing that a PC i was using for media storage that i got dirt cheap would be able to.
---
I hear you but speaking from experience with the buff covering about 1/3 of progression raid time. The alliance would have to do %17 more damage across the board for the entire remaining 2/3 of the raid encounters to just break even with the horde min/maxers who got all the buffs. 
---
Side note: You can get the buff on both sides with the priest tech. and it's a valid argument for Dungeons. But not Raids as the coordination to maximize world buff cycles is almost impossible because Crossroads/ Org is just too far out of the way to be able to finesse it while also maintaining the DM/ ZG/ Ony/ DMF buffs in tandem.  Leaving the Alliance nerfed for min/max endgame raids.
---
I hit rank 11 as casual player in the sense that I just solo queued usually with a few beers in me instead of running premades. The last few weeks I had to play in pretty much all of my free time, but still had a normal work/school life. I would think going much higher as a solo would cut into RL too much for a normal employed person to do it. I proudly still use the mount and title to this day. I'm definitely not trying for ranks in Classic though, but I'll still be in the BGs a lot to help those that are. GL to them.
---
Yeah, about 5% for yellow hits instead of about 9%.
---
Jesus. It's so insane to me that I got around the same rank but with 100,000 HKs.
---
The amount of grinding that I did back then was obscene. I certainly won't be able to play nearly that much this time.
---
It's hard to quantify Druid specs in PvP because most PvP druids will run some form of tri-spec hybrid built to get the most out of their versatility. Deep feral can be deployed as a hard counter to mages but deff lacks the sustain of a 21 point dip into resto.
---
Also the main flagrunning spec, while also technically a 3-spec hybrid, is mainly resto, as you go as deep as swiftmend. People rarely run flags as deep feral (although it's not unheard of).
---
&gt;2. Alliance racials is not superior than Horde in PvE. Except for Fear Ward which only applies to some fights, but is very strong in those fights.
---
3. Its the Paladin class that makes Alliance so insanely LFR mode PvE, not their racials. This is because of Blessings and judgement debuff applied to the target. Paladin &gt; Shaman ANY DAY
---
You are right  and I mispoke: 
---
Obviously, alliance racials and especially the paladin class make them the superior PVE choice.
---
The blessing of Kings is in fact a 10% nerf to every encounter. 
---
Paladins are also the superior healers and they have plenty of awesome utility aspects. 
---
The only true utility shamans bring is the windfurry totem. 
---
&gt;4. If you intend to tank, there is even less chance you will be the receiver of The Corrupted Ashbringer. Even if you make your own guild, manage to have steady progression in almost 2 years when Naxx will be released and then to clear The Four Hoursemen, taking this weapon as tank won't be welcomed by the dps.
---
There is 2Hand tanking; it might be viable in Classic. 
---
Since classic is probably/ hopefully much harder than the pservers, this remains to be discovered. 
---
In any case, I will play tank or dps, whatever my guild needs more. 3 years into classic I'm sure that everyone in my guild will get his / her ideal gear / weapon.
---
Thanks for this. 
---
I started playing WoW right at the launch of BC and I finished towards the end of WotLK. PvP was my favorite part of WoW. So I was hoping I’d be able to hold my own in PvP without having to no-life the game.
---
&gt;You actually are making people think that a Classic Wow Raid is 8 Mages 8 Locks 8 Warriors 8 Rogues and 8 Priests and the Utility Classes get fucked.
---
A fully min-maxed raid will only bring 2 warlocks. Also as your *core* gets progressively *harder* priests will be replaced by shaman and rogues will be replaced by even more warriors.
---
To be clear, that only happens once the guild no longer needs any gear from those raids. Can you imagine trying to gear 22 warriors during progression? It would be a nightmare.
---
There absolutely will be raid leaders that minmax the crap out of their raids. There will also be raid leaders that don't. Do whatever you want. It's just a game.
---
Fast, and/or gives defensive bonuses.
---
I disagree.
---
It affects people. My best friend said "everyone says Hunters can't end game so fuck that." 
---
He actually believed playing a Hunter would be a waste of time because people that have never raided Nax said he wouldn't be able to raid Nax. 
---
It does matter.
---
&gt; So we all select a name before we even know what server we will be playing on?
---
How did you come to that conclusion?
---
&gt;For example, If we have 500k players playing there will be only 1 named 'Tank' in all of classic wow?
---
And how did you come to *that* conclusion?
---
I honestly have no idea where you've been getting your information.
---
How you could have gotten all the time off you wanted, regardless of vacation time accrued, plus some extra perks:
---
In mid-May (when the release date was announced), you should have told your boss/colleagues that an unexpected pregnancy had entered your life and that she was ~5 months along, and that while you know federal law allows you up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, you value your work and team too much and don't think you'll need more than a week or two to get the baby settled into a routine.
---
Have your wife/girlfriend put a pillow under her shirt and snap a few photos to share around the office. You'll have to talk about the baby around the water cooler, but you'll also probably be given some hand-me-down baby shit that you can sell on Ebay/Craigslist to pay for your subscription.
---
Why wait so long to announce? Well, there were complications that needed extensive testing and you didn't want to announce until the doctors gave the all clear.
---
Not married? Well, you're a man of principle. Just because birth control isn't 100% effective doesn't mean you're going to force a kid to grow up without a father.
---
For the next 4 months, you'll have the perfect excuse any time you're late or slacking. "Sorry, she was having terrible cravings this morning and I needed to run to the store to grab pickles and orange sherbet vanilla swirl ice cream" and "Sorry, I was up late last night, the baby was kicking something fierce and I needed to comfort her"
---
At the end of August, you're beloved by the entire office and they throw you a pot luck party before sending you on your way.
---
Classic launches, you're completely in the clear, go ahead and level to 60 and get that world first Ragnaros kill.
---
But what now? Well, shortly after your made up "due date", post something on Facebook about how the baby was stillborn due to the previously mentioned complications. Give it a name, Thex will do. Then a couple days later, send your boss an email stating that you're ready to return to work whenever, that you think it would be good to take your mind off of everything. You'll probably be given even more time to mourn.
---
Once you're back in the office, no one fucks with you. Your work responsibilities are minimal, everyone bends over backwards to help you, and you'll probably get a promotion.
---
And that unexplained WoW habit you now have? Well that's just your way of coping with the loss by escaping into a fantasy world. No one could blame you for that.
---
Well, crits account for AP while Deep Wounds does not (I assume). 
---
But I concede that going straight Arms seems at the very least not significantly worse than 5/5 Cruelty into Arms before lv30. Past lv30 there is no competition, which is why I like to respec then.
---
Because you are too lazy to fucking google search? So we should do it for you or else you will make up lies and spread bullshit?
---
You are getting reported by the dozens for spam of bullshit. 
---
Stop being a child, there is not a single patch note that mentions anything like you are saying. 
---
FD removing you from combat is literally on the Blizzard tooltip description.
---
I don't understand at all. Leveled 60s don't do anything for alts after 35 which is all you need for artisan crafting, and leveling past 35 means you feel obligated to mount which will be the biggest gold sink in the entire process.
---
Are you leveling alts because it's fun, or bc you think it's lucrative goldwise?
---
Undead Warlock.
---
Not triggered.
---
Grinding in Burning Steppes, hit 60 on some Saturday morning in 2005. I might have been on the 'kill black dragonkin' step that leads up to Jailbreak. I then completed the quest chain, got a Jailbreak group, got my necklace, and was able to make the 3 PM Onyxia raid that day.
---
You just described Reddit quite succinctly.
---
Uh, when I did it, I just had a bank alt that the stuff was sent to.i would distribute as needed. If someone asked about getting something, I would check. We only kept guild level mats I'm there, such as stuff from raids, needed for raids. Only gold kept there was that we got from selling runs. We used it mostly for helping out the warriors repairs and respecs as much as practical.
---
I guess at the end of the day it doesn't matter too much.  Once pvp is out I'll do a little and see how it goes.  If it's too hard then you don't really lose much.
---
The people in that group would run circles around you. Stop embarrassing yourself.
---
&gt; Everyone talks about these perfect raid comps and I remember screaming in chat looking for any warm body to come roll their face on a keyboard.
---
I remember that too. You just need to make sure the warm bodies know how to avoid wiping your raid. I'll take a hunter doing 300dps over an empty raid spot on the condition that they know when to dismiss their pet and also don't bomb the raid.
---

No, that's my name :)
---
\^ Big Facts
---
Question: is the hunter a noob?
---
Not all, but most - if you don't enjoy mmorpgs then you aren't apart of the 8 month discussion... they'll be gone within the first month.
---
Yeah nobody did this, bc it required standing still at the dungeon entrance lol
---
Everything here sucks, we have nothing better to do. Not that there is anything better then classic wow.
---
Ya that's gonna be fucking nightmare if you're still leveling.
---
I play Undead Warlock. 
---
...but thanks for playing.
---
I can't count how many days I tried to farm those plans... managed to get it after TBC...annnnd its worthless :(
---
At worst, you can have offtanks/DPs warriors taunt him and shield wall through it.
---
yeah, that sounds right(er). it's been so long, i've completely forgotten my zones.
---
Horde PVP and Calgarian here - let me know once you do pick a server.
---
I saw this and immediately though it was a chair.   It would actually make a great chair back.   I might try to do something like that one day.
---
Incorrect.
---
Thank you, guys!
---
My main macro types out Thex into the character name bar
---
That alone is reason enough to be undead....
---
Yep.
---
I can't wait to be grinding instances for specific and meaningful items.  Here I come Shadowfang Keep.
---
Oh shit, thanks for pointing that out man. I played a druid back in Vanilla but were obviously a complete retard and ran deep feral all the way through :P Many of the posts and videos I found listed feral as the best flag runners. 
---
While I have you here, what are ferals place in bgs then? If any.
---
You don't have to give a reason. However, my manager is a close friend, so I straight-up told him I'm playing WoW.
---
hardcore guilds won't need pre bis to clear MC lol
---
They'll already have good gear and fire resist items from quest rewards in their optimized leveling route
---
Doesn't help that our last several expansions keeps driving us further away from existing content.
---
Then he's clearly not someone who would have made the cut for end-game anyways tbh. If you can't do enough research to know better, you probably aren't going to be given a raid slot in a progression guild for end-game anyways.
---
I think it will take 13 weeks for standing 1 player to get r14 and 12k RP people to get r13.
---
So phase 2 must be longer than 3 months to get r13-r14.
---
9 weeks to get r10 with 10k RP, so a lot of people will be able to get blue pvp set if they pvp much.
---
I expect the people that go for r14 will basically camp flightpaths.
---
I expect tarren mill/southshore to not be that great honor per hour (with honor split among raid and diminishing returns).
---
Nvm I see that druid is broken out differently 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
That's not what OP is asking
---
Make it known upfront what you plan to roll on. Don’t wait for it to drop before surprising people that you’re going to be competing on gear. 
---
Also don’t be a jerk. You don’t want a bad reputation and you may need to group with those people again. You may even become friends or at least earn a reputation as a reliable team player. I’d also say being a team player is what paladin is all about. 
---
I think it’s reasonable for a paladin to roll on any gear that will help them. Again, consider it in the context of the group - and this goes for any player. If there’s a drop that barely helps you, and helps somebody in your party significantly, consider letting them just have it. This is assuming you’re not at endgame yet.
---
I was like "Dude, there's nothing showing in this screenshot" and then I looked in the right corner "Oh boiii, shit's goin wild !"
---
&gt; Hell you could clear MC with just offspecs
---
You could clear MC with raids composed entirely of druids. 
---
I've never seen it done, but paladins and shaman could probably do it too.
---
The Horde was never gone, stop trying to gate keep the inevitable because you’ll be disappointed in the end.
---
It will be OK! Just as OK as me being a Hunter and rolling on all leather items.
---
1) Not looking forward to the insane inflation that players always intentionally provoke.
---
Otherwise, yep, can't wait.
---
Well, they are theoretically able to tank MC so not entirely useless but almost. Its a good point though, bumped it down to a 2.
---
I never said it didn't remove you in combat. I said you can't FD/drink in raids.
---
For someone so bent on calling other people childish, you're acting quite the part yourself.
---
While I agree. I vividly remember a good amount of wpvp in my Arathor PVE server back in the day. In Xroads and STV aswell ...In duskwood also. Obviously not in the same scale but enough to satisfy my needs
---
That's the exact spec I'll be using to level on a pvp server! So it's got my vote lol
---
Pretty sure I was 21/30 holy/ret for about 90% of classic.  Solid spec.
---
I'll trust my opinion a bit more than that of a person on Reddit tbh. I know that my guild along with a few guilds I was considering joining will have 0 enhancement shaman. The guilds I've joined on various private servers had 0 enhancement shaman all with way to KT progression. That's not even my opinion lol, it just is what it is. Rets are probably even lower on the totem poll.
---
Will some guilds have them? Sure! Will they be slightly worse off because of it? Most definitely! But don't let me dictate the way you want to play the game.
---
That hunter shit is whack though. Legitimately twilight zone levels of DPS charts if they are out-dpsing your other classes on a consistent basis.
---
I've seen MC done like that. But I'm pretty sure BWL, NAX, AQ have mechanics that prevent it.
---
Congrats on kicking cancer's ass!
---
Dude I'm ruining my life checking this sub all day, once Classic releases there is no hope.
---
Hit still has a positive value above 9% when you a dual wielding, but it's not as significant as under 9%. Abilities (aka yellow hits) cap at 9% but dual wield auto attacks (aka white hits) still have additional miss chance.
---
Improved overpower generally isn't worth it because you can't use it in Berserker stance. You will have Tactical Mastery so you can swap to Battle Stance and retain 25 rage, but it's tedious to make sure you aren't wasting rage while doing so and also not delaying BT/WW usage. I assume you could potentially squeeze out a dps gain doing it but it's probably not much if at all.
---
I think your biggest challenge will be just finding 40 lvl 60 druids.
---
That's like an entire server's total population of druids
---
I thought you also get reduced honor of the enemy is lower level than you
---
As a Paladin tank I want this to be true......but....
---
We've decided that I'm Thex.
---
Fewer
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
mage AOE grinding is sooooo much faster than questing, it's easily under 4 days /played
---
TBH I’m deciding between the two for a very specific reason. Do I want to bubble-hearth while emote spamming horde or do I want to MC people off the boats for that sweet fatigue bonus..
---
Early-mid WOTLK is when players started to drop off, Been going down since then.
---
Back in early 2006 there was a hunter named Thechosen on Shattered Hand EU with a Thunderfury. What a legend
---
I feel that way about Org; UC and TB are so meh imo.
---
12-13 depending on how long p2-&gt;p3 is
---
So basically expect to DPS unless you're the MT and OT certain fights?
---
I don’t need this myself but this is some real high quality content. Very well done.
---
I have a vague memory of this in Retail Vanilla.  I remember the camera falling about 5 meters in bear form.
---
It is but still not enough to have warlocks go ham in raids :-)
---
I doubt this matters. Almost all proc rates in vanilla were below 2%. Many were 1% or lower.
---
I think proc rates are where pservers are the most inaccurate.
---
Section C xi 2 of the TOS specifically addressed "Deliberate Inactivity". Also sites the code of conduct for a more in-depth info.
---
\&gt;I'm aware of layering but I feel that this will be turned off once the HUGE spike of tourists dissipates. 
---
Blizzard actually said this.
---
No kidding, I played a druid, arguably the worst class only needed for motw, and always found a spot. That said, I really hope the apply some balance changes that came later cause vanilla druids were the worst.
---
Today is the 2nd...?
---
I think the term "decurse" came from the mod "decursive" which handled removing debuffs for all classes able to remove any debuff, thus it includes the removal of poisons, diseases, curses, or magic debuffs.
---
It's also less clunky than saying "remove debuffs" or "dedebuff".
---
Something something Escape Artist
---
Exactly, super annoying...
---
225 is too low even for horrible, sub 60 gear. But even 70 seconds is *ages* for MC standards. And in the first 1-2 MCs it is not unheard of for people to die at Magmadar.
---
We don't have to specify but my boss is well aware I'm playing a video game for a week as a grown man.
---
Since your only other choice on that side is a gnome warlock, I don't blame you.
---
There were tests of procs on rare and lower-level items proccing 10%, 15%, even 25% and 33% across thousands of strikes. That's just from old comments. Private servers are the ones trying to "balance" everything by lowering random procs to minimal-impact levels (although I'll admit that many procs in Vanilla were relegated to 1ppm according to the records).
---
I get Tuesday to Thursday mornings for 2 weeks.  Not too much, but should allow me to keep up to the middle of the pack.
---
Nice that you ask. As others pointed out it's not as necessary for you while leveling and you can replace it easyly as you can wear anything. If you'll main Heal in the Endgame I suggest you start competetively looting healing EQ at the 50ish mark.
---
You are correct i was looking at the wrong format on my dates LOL feelsbadman
---
Click on the wow tab and then the pulleown menu, you should be able to click on classic wow and install it now.

It can do more than enough even with minimal permissions tbh but I value privacy, which includes Discord ids.

haha Deztox is indeed a friend of mine but I simply asked him to upvote. Seems he went slightly overboard.
---
&gt; A good warrior already essentially hard counters a rogue
---
Alright dude, i think you can ask any good rogue if they have trouble with warriors in a 1v1, UNLESS they are Orc and resist. Tauren is also good here because the leeway can fuck up the deadzone kite, but warriors do not "counter" rogues in a 1v1.
---
&gt; No they don’t. I’ve already researched this. For example the most popular pserver for the last many years hasn’t had it. 
---
[Again, they do.](https://i.redd.it/ssfp7xmkzvy21.png) 
---
The extra hitbox size is a double edge sword that actually, because your we all know your reach is longer, but so is your hitbox for AoE spells and triggers on the ground (Such as Frost Nova/traps/grenades and several other ground effects). 
---
&gt;&gt; Orc also has Axe spec and Bloodfury (which are both insanely good), Tauren have not.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Warstomp is much better than these two traits for PvP, not close. 
---
Classic WoW is way more than JUST PvP, i said this in my earlier comments but seem to be ignored, unless you're going R14 you will HAVE to do PvE, and there Axe/Blood Fury is alot better. Bloodfury is definitely not useless for PvP, its good for 1v1s. Warstomp is better probably, but the Orc racials are 1000 times better for PvE (DPS/Threat)
---
&gt; I know you think I’m biased, but I mained an Orc Warrior. I’m just following the logic.
---
I dont think, i know you are by the way you write.
---
We could go on forever, if you're set on playing Tauren, great for you, you do that. We'll just let other people decide what they want to play based on data gathered rather than subjective opinions that we might have.
---
Do you need a healer? Thats all I want to do too lol
---
Surely you don’t out looking for a job dressed like that, do you? On a weekday?! 
---
Is today a, uhhh... what day is it?
---
You're one of the good guys now.
---
I just asked my boss face-to-face if it's ok to take few days off. I'm pretty sure he doesn't even care.
---
I'm the most antisocial MMO players out there and to this day still talk to people I met on WoW 12+ years ago. You'll make friends even if dont intend to make friends.
---
That's the same patch version I have from the last stress test. Has Blizzard confirmed this is the final client?
---
Faction is the most important, defining choice you'll make. I wouldn't base it off of min-maxing racial abilities, which can be helpful but are much less of an impact than just being a smart player. If playing a gnome warlock speaks to you, then play Alliance. If you want to be one of the cool Horde races, go Horde. Everything else is flexible from there.
---
*coughcoughdontforgetaboutferalcatsandlolhanceshamancoughcough* jesus i need some water here.

Your loot counsel has to be people that other people trust explicitly to make fair decisions based on what is best for the group.

If it's a bunch of KeK retard sperglodites that couldn't act right at an RNC event, say goodbye to progress.
---
10/10 I laughed so hard
---
maybe thats because the retail version of WoW is a sack of festering dog shit
---
This exactly. It is so annoying. I rather have "bad" Classic itemization but therefore actually have the need to play all the content. No matter if I join at start, 3 months or 1.5 years into the Addon. How comes an Addon is just played Patch by Patch and nobody cares about old Raids? This is what I call bad itemization.

I know right, its literally what happened to me...
---
You know it brother
---
Outside of ganking location, the horde racials are more geared toward PVP. Meaning particularly Orcs and Tauren pose more of a threat out the gate PVP-wise than any other races.  That being said the better player of the two will usually win regardless of class/race mechanics.

Nice, but aren't all lamps 3D?
---
You won't find a pvp group unless you go undead.
---
/S
---
In case anyone doesn't realize, you can't split your raid up to get two Lucifron kills, then merge into one group to continue on to Magmadar. Once a boss dies in a raid, everyone that killed that boss is locked to that unique raid's ID.
---
Should change hunter to warrior and it’s more accurate
---
nice dishonorable kill nerd
---
diddnt some guild in classic have a 40 druid raid team and beat pretty much everything in MC and BWL?
---
I think “valuable” is the key word there. Don’t roll on gear that’s obviously a much better improvement for another player. Particularly when you’re already heavily benefiting from other items that have dropped.
---
Mostly fixed... except for that one time i got thrashed by Prince and hit with three crushing blows in the half second between Holy Shield falling and me putting it back up. &gt;.&lt;
---
I tanked quite a bit in classic as a Paladin, but only in 5-mans, and mostly the undead instances.  You can be OP in  there if you know what you're doing.
---
No. They said they want as few as possible.
---
As everyone that said it's probably pretty pointless but if you did the Iron Man challenge that might be your closest bet to what classic will feel like
---
Hunter is the best PVP class till Cata.
---
Why would you level holy...
---
Right...
---
Retail players literally want everything spoonfed to them. Jeez getting your first pouch/bag at level 6 is an amazing feeling haha.
---
FUCKING POGGERS
---
I think at some point they may have made them a lot harder, but I definitely went out of my way to kill them and make the other side wait for the respawn (sometimes killing them multiple times).
---
The worst thing I did was I was in Crossroads as Alliance (started on Horde) and I knew what a pain being in the middle of nowhere could be. So I sat there and I kept killing the Griffon rider over and over so people would be stuck there. You can tell that I was a really mature 20 year old.
---
Definitely go with what you like. Especially as a warlock which aren't that common, people will be happy to have you around.
---
Only if you plan on aiming for a top2 hardcore raiding guild might it matter some, and even then not so much since people know the content and will clear it easily.
---
So check out different animations and pick what you like.
---
It won't be very good... you're overhyping it. There, I said it.
---
The thing I personally look most forward to is how the leveling feels in vanilla. I'm not a raider, not do I particularly care about PvP, so what made WoW fun for me was always the leveling content. Creating lots of alts and leveling them up. And there's just a stark difference between how that used to go in Vanilla and how it goes now. 
---
In Vanilla every level up gives you *something*. Sure, it may just be a new rank for a spell, or a talent point that will give you a miniscule percentage increase in damage, healing or whatever, but it's an immediate reward that makes you feel like you've achieved something. In the current game you can go 15+ levels without getting a talent point, which just makes leveling up not all that special anymore. Sure, you still get new spell ranks (or rather, your spells increase in level automatically) and all those small percentage increases of damage, healing and whatever are still happening, just under the hood - but the thing is that it just *feels* a lot better to spend a talent point yourself than have the game automatically add stats without telling you about it. 
---
I feel lately Blizzard kinda forgot about making the leveling content fun, due to the whole "endgame is the true game" mindset that a good part of the community seems to have (and, to, be fair, already had back in vanilla, this is by no means a new thing). But while that mindset already existed in the early days Blizzard didn't really design the game around it.
---
You might just avoid 24 hours of server problems so it's probably for the best
---
Any one handers that have 2.00 or lower speed, stamina, preferably armor and other defensive stats. Honestly though it's a loaded question because sometimes you will want a more DPS oriented weapon with hit/crit/str on it for better threat generation. See: Chul'Surokh from nefarian.
---
Instances start at 15 right but duel spec isn't till 20 I though
---
Wooooooaaaahhh! +
---
I don't understand the grade rating at all - what's the point of having a 1-10 system when no class gets a 10? There won't be more classes than there is. The best class at a particular thing is *supposed* to receive a 10 because they're *the best* and by *the best* we don't mean *the best so far* but just *the* best.
---
It was one of the only PC games in the mid 2000’s to support 180 degree screen rotation so it’s always been very popular there.
---
That is why those sentences end in '?'.  There is NO information on name reservation and I am trying to understand how it even works.
---
There is no such thing as dual spec in classic.
---
Gnome are made for punting.  :3
---
Balance druids at higher levels of gear can start to get really insane burst, and before that they have strong self-sustain and kite potential. Moonkin form is a waste of points, if ur getting melee'd you are doing something wrong. Instead they go for the dip in resto for Nature's Swiftness. 
---
Because their playstyle is about drawing out a fight, kiting and outsustaining, they don't have a ton of use in a battleground situation, which is more about diving the enemy backline and on-demand burst. But their world pvp potential is extremely high, as they take the kite/sustain meta of druids to its apex.
---
Well being able to see the bank alts bags and bank without having to log over will save a lot of time. This makes it more convenient if guildies whisper op’s main.
---
yeah, 3 improved rend + 2 deflection is the typical MS warrior build. Imp heroic strike won't be used that often since you'll be using instant attacks most of the time.
---
The thing is, specs like ret were completely fine in vanilla. That doesn't mean ret paladins were dps'ing in raids, certainly not in progression. A ret or similar spec could do just fine in the healing department though as long as they were geared for it. I played ret all of classic and had the best ret gear on the server, but I healed in raids. Sure, I would DPS for fun in a drunken friday night farm mode clear, so it's not like I never got to play my spec in raids. I was in a guild that cleared AQ and Naxx in vanilla btw, so it definitely is possible.
---

Fool me once, shame on you. But teach a man to fool me and I’ll be fooled for the rest of my life.
---
What would you suggest using from \~28-38 when the deadmines weps fall off hard?
---
We can't make your decisions for you - so you need to ask yourself. What do I want to do? Do I want to tank and dps with very low self-sustain? Or do I want to heal and support my group, and dps sometimes? If you know what main role you want to play in this game, the choice should be easy.
---
I mean if you're playing role you should go out of your way to antagonise the opposing faction, right?
---
My two fav classes as well. Just decide if you want to heal or dps in dungeons and raids. Don't worry about questing. Priest is not much harder that lock. Bubble, holy fire, pain dot, wand, maybe a smite or mind blast in there. If you make sure to upgrade your wand as often as possible, you are mostly g2g.
---
I'm going priest because I want to heal in raids. Will have an alt lock possibly for farming later on.
---
Experience and practice
---
Feel like the next most important part is "dont fuck up mechanics" at that last part. Being bottom dps but you are doing the mechanics correctly is far far better than being middle and failing the raid cause you aren't doing mechanics
---
Great guide. Still undecided between Priest and Warlock though. Warlock was my main in vanilla, Rogue in BC and then Priest in Wrath.
---
I said the same thing and that I didn't want people to do it for me, but somehow got called 'entitled' and downvoted by OP.
---
Entitled for *not* wanting special treatment; that's a new one for me.
---
Even if you do end up with different paths you can solve this very quickly.   
---
X:\\Y\\World of Warcraft\\\_build\_\\WTF contains your configured settings. The WTF folder contains a [Config.wtf](https://Config.wtf) with your World of Warcraft settings (graphics etc) and that folder contains 2 folders.  
---
\- Account  
---
\-- 1 or more folders (depends on how many WoW accounts you own). There will be 1 per account that you played with.  
---
\--- caches (server-side stores macros, bindings and settings0  
---
\--- SavedVariables (contains your settings per addOn)  
---
\--- Servername(s) that you played on  
---
\---- Charactername(s) that you played on  
---
\----- Settings for your character (characted bound caches and characted bound addOn settings)  
---
\- SavedVariables  
---
The only thing you have to do is fix the servername to match what you will actually be playing on and the character name that you eventually use. So even with the same client, doing anything on the stress test will be pointless since your realm name will not match whatever you will end upon when Classic goes live, unless you fix this folder structure as I described it here. If this is too complex you should browse through the WTF folder by hand. It isn't rocket science.
---
PS:  
---
\- = folder level  
---
X = drive  
---
Y = whatever your prefix path is  
---
\_build\_ = \_retail\_, \_classic\_, \_classic\_beta\_ and so on
---
Turns out [there's been a specific bug even mentioning this subreddit filed for months](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1556243), also confirming that it's fixed on current Dev Edition. That bug puts the rendering slowness down to a large repeated border-image (eg .content and .side). That's obviously bad for scrolling, but combine that with any kind of animation or frequently rerendered content (probably including ads and chat) and things blow up.
---
Either Acherus or something similar (quest green) or the RFK axe
---
Yeah, I'm pretty disappointed by this!
---
&gt; I also congratulate my girlfriend for being on time.
---
That sounds more sarcastic and patronizing than a positive reward.
---
When she left you may finally replace her with a virtual girlfriend
---
Mom said its MY turn to be Thex!
---
Ah awesome, thought something like that was possibly, awesome to get confirmation. Thanks again :-)

Looks like classic isn’t for you.
---
Who do you mean by they? And which old addons are you talking about?
---
Yellow damage hit cap is the same no matter what type of weapons you have equipped. With a 2h or 1h+shield your white hits use the same hit cap as yellow hits. If you are dual-wielding you get a large penalty to your hit chance for white hits. 
---
+%hit gear is very valuable for everyone up to the yellow cap. If you're 2h or 1h+shield, +hit on gear past the yellow cap does nothing. If you're dual-wielding it continues to provide a small amount of dps. 
---
Effectively you will never be able to cap your auto attacks while dual-wielding. Even if you could, you shouldn't try because past the yellow cap the value of +hit pales in comparison to attack power and crit. You'll usually end up with more hit chance than is required for yellow hit cap, but you basically just take what you get. You don't seek it out like you do when you're under the yellow cap. 
---
Some exceptions apply, particularly when you're dealing with world buffs. For more information on how attacks work see here: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table

---
Hammer wielding pedophile is the most Russian thing I've heard all day.  Think you know what class to choose.
---
Nah I’d go demon hunter
---
I remember people getting invited to MC first times as really low levels. Like 58 hunters/healers and such.
---
Nobody even had much experience and we still downed lucifron at least, don't remember if more.
---
I'll think about if this is doable, it would require to set a Raider role at least so the bot knows who to DM on the server. And then it would be a command and not automated, I don't want the bot to have any automation. So f.e. a command !DMslackingRaiders \[message id\] and then it would message all Raiders who are not signed to the event with the entered message id
---
good point.  Nothing like having someone join the group and they are on the other side of the planet.
---
Grats on your reply to his post!!
---
-patiently awaiting my own validation for providing you with some-
---
I remember back in the day having a Gnome Mage and took the 59-60 farming on 2 days. half bar one day and another half the second. now. will take the same mage journey...but for the horde!
---
Classic will start with a patch that has a higher debuff limit right? Is it 40?
---
Personally I think you're somewhat right. I don't think that the hardcore players are the majority I think they're just the vocal minority. And the fact that some of them have a voice through twitch or YouTube makes them even louder. I really really look forward to seeing what the numbers actually come out to with a lot of these meme specs excetera and how viable they are compared to what is optimal.
---
LOL yeah happened to me a few times to.  Get a bad string of parry gibs that eat through your Holy Shield and get crushed.  Good times...
---
Still, plenty workable in BC.   Just not in vanilla :(  I've been trying to make it work on a private sandbox for a little while and finally had to throw in the towel and plan on leveling a warrior.
---
Pretty sure it’s gonna stay 16, somebody more knowledgeable should correct me if I am wrong
---
My point exactly. Strength in numbers. I dont know these exact figures but lets say a warrior does 500dps and a ret does 350. If you had 35 people in a raid and your  warriors went on strike and had to take 5 ret instead. Bosses are still going to die. Everyones minds are stuck in the top 1% players, min/maxing everything and aiming for speed almost. Its insane. You look at crazy numbers when you need to clear a portion of naxx in an evening or speed farming mc with free for all loot to get a few spot farm items for certain members. PLAY WHAT YOU WANT!
---
Harder to gank orcs due to racial.
---
Harder to slow gnomes/dwarves.
---
&gt;	i think you can ask any good rogue if they have trouble with warriors in a 1v1, UNLESS they are Orc and resist. Tauren is also good here because the leeway can fuck up the deadzone kite, but warriors do not “counter” rogues in a 1v1.
---
Not sure if trolling. At equal skill Rogue needs all its CDs to win the Warrior matchup in 1.12. I almost don’t even want to dive into this because if you don’t already know this it’s hard for me to have this discussion with you. Also, Tauren hitbox only moves the deadzone kite further away and leeway
---
&gt;	Again, they do.
---
No these aren’t the same pictures and it’s been tested plenty. I played a Tauren Hunter on LH and the Beta was insanely different. It’s been in their bug reports for quite a while and they just don’t care. People actually complain about it.
---
reddit.com/r/lightshope/comments/8q57ct/tauren_range_confirmation/
---
&gt;The extra hitbox size is a double edge sword that actually, because your we all know your reach is longer, but so is your hitbox for AoE spells and triggers on the ground (Such as Frost Nova/traps/grenades and several other ground effects).
---
Correct. Where the hitbox shines is after intercept and charge. It’s a double edge sword, but the favorable edge completely and utterly dwarfs the negative edge. For Tauren Hunters it’s the opposite.
---
&gt;	Classic WoW is way more than JUST PvP, i said this in my earlier comments but seem to be ignored, unless you’re going R14 you will HAVE to do PvE, and there Axe/Blood Fury is alot better. Bloodfury is definitely not useless for PvP, its good for 1v1s. Warstomp is better probably, but the Orc racials are 1000 times better for PvE (DPS/Threat)
---
This conversation is about PvP. In PvE Human is king followed by TF Troll and then Orc. 
---
&gt;	I dont think, i know you are by the way you write.
---
We could go on forever, if you’re set on playing Tauren, great for you, you do that. We’ll just let other people decide what they want to play based on data gathered rather than subjective opinions that we might have.
---
Obviously I know you’re wrong about that first part. Again I mained Orc Warrior and plan on playing Hunter in Classic. Luckily I’m just following the facts, and obviously people can play whatever they want.  glhf
---
And that’s all we really need
---
Lots of players are giving anecdotes from private servers with 3-4 times the population and players that are much more dedicated than the average player 15 years ago. Some people misremembering from way back when. 
---
You can get R10 slowly too. You just have to beat the 20% penalty and avoid getting pushed down. People are saying you can get from 9-10 playing 40 hours a week for two weeks and thats true. You can also play 15 hours a week for two months and get it.
---
Well, hope your guild last longer than the six months tops, that interest in Classic will last.

The raid where the hunter tops DPS - and I need to stop embarrassing myself. Gotcha Chief
---
As an Arms pvp warrior, which is the best weapon specialization talent and how big of a diffrence do the weapon specialization talents make?
---
Ex: if Axe Specialization is better than Sword Specialization, how much better does a sword have to be than an axe before I get more value out of the better weapon with the inferior spec option?
---
The ranking process is exponential and it hits critical mass going from 10 to 11. 10 isn't *that* bad but it's certainly not easy. Everything past it though is just taking it to another level.

Leveling takes a couple months. Don't believe people who say they will do it in a couple weeks (similar to world record) with lower density and longer spawn rates on mobs. One day or two will not change anything at all.
---
No, max Respec cost is 25g per talent reset 
---
Still quite pricey.
---
Addressing your original question about downsides, as long as it's not against ToS and is "legal" to do and you want to do it, then go for it. 
---
I don't see downsides besides more time spent and maybe wishing one of the toons wasn't a shaman, just cuz I personally get bored of one class, but that's a personal preference thing so
---
Not sure how much you consider way more. But you could do that computer around 2500 for just the tower. The parts listed can be had for around the 1800 to 2k mark.

Dude, youre lucky. Classic wow is like that 10/10 movie you wish you could unsee just so you could have the experience of seeing it for the first time again. See you in azeroth
---
All the top guilds were alliance back in he day. There's a good reason for it.
---
You wouldn't make it pass a druid class call and fears on the tank no way. To do this would probably be around the same difficulty as killing KT with the whole raid blindfolded.
---
You forgot about tacos. Tacos are pretty great.
---
Not yet.
---
I would say we will know after the stress test as Blizzard have said they will release server names etc. before the name reservation/character creation goes live on the 13th.
---
You mean Seal Fate? around what gear should I go for that?
---
Yeah wpvp/pvp is my main concern. I was planning on going mining/skinning or even mining/blacksmithing but I see what you mean with herb/alch.
---
Basically, any warrior who isn't willing to put on a shield and tank 5 mans doesnt deserves the loot.
---
I'm not going to put up with rolling against someone else on gear because they aren't prepared to tank. If anything we could get 2x the runs in by both tanking.
---
In short, a lot of people get drawn into the warrior class because of the DPS potential they had on pservers due to inaccurate coding. If you aren't willing to play your class to the full potential roll a fucking rogue.
---
Tranq has a cd and 2 hunters can barely keep mag tranq'd, you beat him week 1 by bringing too many healers and bresing tanks
---
if you are the main flag carrier you will always have a spot in a premade, regardless which bg it is. they are a very mobile support class and effective. Druids are a needed in pvp so I do think the 9/10 is correct within the role you are performing.
---
you just arent a rogue, nor a tanky warrior.
---
I am going to make a troll shaman called Thax
---
Hit has roughly the same value as crit after 9% and even higher if you are approaching white crit cap which is around 40% which with world buffs can become troublesome. Having higher hit increases the crit cap.
---
Thanks for your advice, I will lookup how dagger rogue seems, and also thanks for advice on pickpocket farm, seems like a pretty good method.
---
I'm outright saying the Pally buffs is less of a damage boost than an hour of this world buff alliance can't use.  They can't effectively use it because they would have to sacrifice one of the other buffs such as  DM/ ZG/ Ony/ DMF.
---
No it wont be enough but it will be a massively help.
---
If you want to be in the most elite-gated hardcore raiding guild on your server, you might run into trouble if you are 100% min-maxed. If you just want to have fun, join a casual or mid-tier raiding guild, understand the fights and do your best, and really that's all you need.
---
lol it was my first one "honor" kill ever! Stupid npc... and i never figured out how to get it off my record! /cry
---
I did play LoL and getting hardstuck Silver 5 was definitely detrimental :)
---
Going over 9% hit is still beneficial because it raises your crit cap. Fully raid/world buffed you will hit like 45-50% crit chance but the hit table will only allow for something like 36% crit on white hits depending on your hit gear. I recommend googling vanilla hit table to see the exact way everything is calculated. Also hit is nice because it will smooth out your rage generation and give you more white damage overall.
---
As far as imp overpower, it's one of the high skill cap mechanics of a fury warrior, if you are low rage, it is higher dps to stance dance to get the overpower off. Once your gear gets better this will get harder to pull of to make this worth doing, but it's generally only done when you are rage starved and not wasting rage to stance dance.
---
The concept of making yourself more marketable will always be relevant. It even happens now, where classes and specs in M+ aren't taken as seriously as classes that are tried, tested, and proven.
---
You won't have trouble finding raid spots, mostly because they need bodies, but the time it'll take to find groups will be lessened if you play a class that's higher demand.
---
Sorry to hear that, although sounds like you're going to be ok?
---
A lot of people seem to recommend the G600 over the razer naga, which is understandable however I just want to point out that the G600 have a ring-finger button and not a lot of people know that when they buy it. I've heard and read that it can be pretty annoying and hard to get used to for some people. Some people disable it entirely but even then it's annoying when you accidentally click it or mistaken it with the actual right click button. Just something to keep in mind.
---
I played since mid vanilla and never played a warrior until wrath and I completely fell in love with all the stance dancing and really had to learn to use macros. I played a shaman mostly up until then I never really used macros.  Then Cataclysm hit and Deathwing fucked everything up =/
---
Shouldn't be too hard for a guild to farm a few devilsaur sets week 1. Won't be much competition out there unless there are multiple guilds pushing for a week 1 kill on the same server
---
Yes, real choices with meaningful gameplay consequences. 
---
I also prefer the organic lore first design vs the quest hub and spoke design.
---
NOMEGALUL- better farm runecloth
---
Eh I'd like to see the logs. I can't think of any fight where a hunter should out-dps a warrior or rogue.
---
If you as a paladin need on robe of arugal, the clothies in your group will notice. It will almost for sure make them not want to group with you again. These things will matter on classic, where the server pop is much smaller than certain private servers.
---
Its really not. If you look at pserver recruiting literally 0 guilds past aq are recruiting hunters
---
invite to wpvp layer pls
---
Its probably about right for people in a mix of greens and blues, 16 debuff slots will help a lot here too
---
Any idea how close id be?
---
The stars have aligned
---
You can swear on the internet
---
Shammies. 
---
Priests have Shield and Psychic Scream but that's about it. Shammies have mail, Ghost Wolf, Earthbind/Frost Shock for kiting, and a bunch of other useful totems.
---
There really isn't. [This video explains why pretty well.](https://youtu.be/H6H2Zctz3-M)
---
Yeah, no tank in their right mind would say no to a Vis'kag, CTS or Deathbringer because of the speed. I believe a lot of this bias comes from a bug in Nost/Ely servers back in the day where Rage gained from damage taken used damage before armor in the calculation, so tanks were essentially Rage capped all the time. 
---
Personally I still advocate to hand the slow 1H out to the DPS first since they actually benefit more and tanks can 'just' buy themselves a Quel'Serrar in p2.
---
That age thing would explain a lot and it probably is the case with a lot of em but I have a feeling a big chunk of them are in their 20s and older because they're returning to classic from when they played vanilla as a kid. That's the sad part.
---
This is awesome
---
I hear the RP servers can be quite barren. I think I'll be lookin for a guild with some like minded battle hardened warriors
---
What? Druids are projected to be ~8% of the Horde population and ~10% of the Alliance population. That's 3 to 4 Druids per raid team.
---
Absolutely, won't be impossible, but you get 1-shot at it, 30 minute cooldown on shield wall is pretty brutal.
---
I totally agree.  People are acting like there will be a shortage of DPS classes.  Everyone goes on and on about 40 warm bodies.  But it's not like those 40 warm bodies can all be dps.  You need some healers in there too.
---
Ive had so many people on this board tell me there will be no problem filling healer slots in raids.
---
The issue is over the quality of raid you may find a spot in. I suggest going with meta choices *to increase your ease of finding a raid spot*.
---
Shaman are great.  This time around on one server I'll have a NE priest and on another a shaman.  I will primarily be PVPing/BGing.  They are both loads of fun.
---
You have fear and bubble as a priest for your escape, but you have frostshock and ghostwolf (and totems) to escape as a shaman.

I hope I can find a raid spot as a Tauren Druid.
---
Then someone realizes they missed a quest objective in an area that has already respawned...
---
Hand of motherfucking justice.
---
Great article. It's a shame that a post this valuable will only get a few hundred upvotes because people don't want to leave Reddit to read something.
---
Brah, listen, he understands, and thinks anything at level 60 before you could level is vanilla.  Let him rot in hell, save your breath.
---
Thank you for posting and you raise an interesting question. I don’t think most people on this forum will get to naxx. This is largely the point, as it makes even less sense to be biased against a hybrid class for the majority.
---
But for those that do go to naxx the answer to your question has to do with measuring expectations. I haven’t not seen shadow above bottom third dps in Naxx but  raw dps is a poor measure of what a player can contribute. 
---
But considering raw dps for a movement, if your raid has several locks (and it should have at least 3 in naxx), shadow will buff their damage by 15%. If you include that additional damage to the s.priests own dps you’ll see a significant increases to  your place on the chart (generally this will land the s.priest at the bottom of the top tier or top of mid tier dps).
---
What? If D2 launched without the ability to create characters, no one would ever have been able to play.
---
There is no inaccurate coding making warrior dps op. They will be top dps as soon as tgey get prebis. So no, dont roll a rogue just bc this guy thinks you have to play the way he says.
---
It doesn't gate any bosses outside domo and rag, you can move on and come back if absolutely needed. Though probably you'll want shield wall back for some other fights
---
YES
---
Signing a prenup isn't a sign you expect to break up. Just like insurance isn't a plan to get in a car accident.
---
Congratulations OP, happy you're happy amigo!
---
I wouldn't even argue that Vanilla/Classic is difficult or even more challenging - it's just slower and takes longer to ding max. Leveling in Vanilla was never *hard* and it was in fact *easy* relative to almost any other MMORPG at the time of release.
---
Sure, the threat of dying while leveling in BFA is lower than it is in Classic, but that doesn't mean Classic is by any means difficult regarding leveling.
---
1 point in Imp. Charge can give a lot of utility early game as it allows you to have a usable amount of rage long before you get the max rank. Charge gives 9/12/15 rage at levels 4/26/46 respectively.
---
I normally get 1 point at lvl 20 so I have 12/15 range on charge and then respec at 40.
---
I was in a top 15 raid guild and I never knew about the debuff limit either.  People are really being anal about nothing, this is pure revisionist history based on the words of a few elites.
---
Light be with you ;)
---
Just adding dissent for anyone else reading. Many including myself consider hamstring kiting to be quite easy , even enjoyable as it’s more engaging, and extremely beneficial for leveling.
---
Thank you so much! Really appreciate all that information very much. 
---
I think i will go with the used one then. Reading up on some tips when buying a used laptop now. If he barely used it like the ad says, should feel comfortable there.

---
You can do whatever you want.  I had a BIS-geared Enh shaman but I specced 0/30/21 for awhile because you just get your face ripped off in toe-to-toe PVP, so I played more as a support and protected our clothies from rogues or mages that got too close.  Otherwise I used most of my mana for lesser healing wave and totems, rank 1 frost shock to kite warriors, and max rank shocks against targets I was trying to DPS down.  
---
This was arguably a more fun and effective playstyle than full-on DPS enhance since everyone sees you as an easy target (since you are) for bursting down.
---
First of all: swords &gt; axes. An extra hit is always more valuable than extra crit because the extra hit can also crit.
---
Second: The difference between a sword and an axe is not very big. Use the best weapon available to you and then adjust your talents accordingly. If your best weapon happens to be a mace, then that's totally fine for pvP, but note that mace spec is useless in PvE and you should probably use the next best sword/axe instead. Or just go Fury.
---
Could you be a bit more specific over why you think that warriors are doing too much damage on pservers? what specifically should be different that makes them weaker?
---
“Playing the game wrong”
---
Lol
---
Just my 2c:
---
Enhancement shamans should have a higher rating for world PvP (you have them at 6) than in BGs (7.5). They really struggle more in organized context than in the more chaotic situations of world pbp
---
We were all clickers! LOL (and if they weren't, well, they kept getting beat by one!) Competition is relative, dammit. :( Besides, let's not pretend WoW in this flavor was in any way twitchy like a true FPS (CS:S at the time, comes to mind).
---
Leveling is more challenging in vanilla but everything you group for is way way easier. Dungeons are meant for level 50 and raids mechanics is a joke. It's more about farming resist gear.  
---
Retail the game starts at max level, in some ways vanilla ends at 60.
---
Agreed. That absolute worst thing about bfa was no new talents/skills after lvl 100. Hitting 120 didn't even feel cool.
---
Can agree. You need on cloth as a mail/plate user sub 60 and you can assume I’ll not group with you again.
---
I’m looking forward to the old zones as well, along with that I’m really excited to go back to a time before they went so off the rails with the lore.
---
You do not raid as arms. Period. Mortal Strike was nerfed late in Vanilla and people stopped using arms for tanking. Dont do it.
---
I didn't know what healer to play between shaman and paladin, but after I've read this article I'm going to play holy paladin, it seems amazing for both PvP and PvE.
---
You work in the US and you don’t have off Labor Day?
---
How many of that 8-10% are actually going to hit 60 though?
---
From what I've seen - no, not really, I guess.
---
Perfect response. Let's tilt our heads back and laugh at the peasants.
---
But what will druids be doing?
---
i'm surprised we still have to tell people this crap.
---
tho, tbh, i think the only not-quite-viable raid spec is Protection Paladin, if you're going in there to tank, just because they don't have a taunt and their aggro is entirely based on how much mana they have and even chugging mana potions off cool down, their mana pool won't last very long... and, of course, for those fights with fears, they can't stance-dance.
---
they can still work on quite a few fights, tho.
---
 I agree with every single one of these things for the same reasons.
---
Yeah.  Esp as priest.  Dispel can do TONS of great stuff.  Your best defense is usually to make sure that friendly warrior/rogue/other DPS near you is free to do their thing rather than be stuck in poly, fear.    You can also take away important buffs from enemies like paladin blessings (BOP, BoF), pw:s or pw:f, or even arcane power/ presence of mind =P
---
Similar to paladins, cleanse is used almost as much as flash of light.  Keep your friends free to do their thing.
---
we actually added "Chuck Norris" as a rank to our next guild :)
---
Especially considering the fact that most raids are 40 man in classic most groups are going to be more concerned about filling slots than min maxing. Plus like you said optimal choices for race/class/spec only really apply under the conditions of equal gear and perfect play which almost no one is going to achieve.
---
Oh, I agree. It's not difficult. If my dumbass 13 year old self can get to level 40 without much issue then I think anyone can.
---
Not that inaccurate lol - dispel might be the most powerful and efficient spell in the game.
---
I would say the only thing wrathofroc is missing here is one item in the priority mix:
---
1) Dispel
---
2) Heal/Shield
---
3) \*mana burn opposing healers
---
4) contribute to damaging/debuffing/dotting enemies
---
The Dungeon experience is also different. Is no longer a 1,2,3 final boss, done type of deal.   
---
There is gonna be mobs, the ones who you have to pull with a cc and/or LoS pull. The creativty behind it and living with the bad choice when you agrro'd the pat. One example I'm looking forward is BRD. Such a long dungeon that you don't know if you'll complete. The dungeon itself is broken down from low 50s to the mid/high 50s so you know you wont finish the higher end portion if you go in at 50-52, and guess what I'm ok with that !
---
&gt;  they said approx 2 months between phases until 3
---
Where did they say this?
---
So you think a disproportional amount of Druids will quit before hitting 60 versus all other classes?
---
That's when you crank open the first beer.
---
Wow is actually the only game I've enjoyed playing while drinking beer. If you don't include some drinking games on others but those are a different case.
---
And what mechanic would keep you from drinking? After being called out on your nonsense crying wolf, by posting dozens of times actual lies about ability to FD drink removed, you get defensive. 
---
Why would you fabricate lies about a game you obviously never experienced first hand or cared enough to research yourself?
---
Also no one needs to be angry or upset to tell a child he is fabricating material just to draw attention.
---
You can run low-level dungeons without a tank. Not _well_, but it is possible.
---
You can't run them at all without a healer.
---
Indeed, it just requires a higher skill level to pull it off. I was considering Boomy even if I don't like the other Druid forms because its just one of the coolest dps specs in the game. What turned me off was having to level as Feral, I despise physical dps. So probably just going to play what I know best and roll Shadow Priest hoping a find a group that'll let me raid with them
---
You're still capable of tanking while specced into arms.
---
Nothing is easier than semi-AFK'ing in AV.
---
I absolutely do.
---
i just wanna do raid for 3 hours with 40 ppl.
---
if raid leader take fully min/max we finish faster.
---
if he takes any spec we dont finish or kill few bosses.
---
either way we will have fun and laugh on discort. we are no trying to be server first, but enjoying the game
---
a lot of ppl are hc pvp and other pve semi hc players, and ppl with play pve with pvp builds, and reverse, and most ppl wont even notice that
---
no only chocolate rain
---
I plan on wandering around the world somewhat aimlessly, finding interesting people of the opposite faction, and killing them.
---
Kinda like how a child book helps you to read. Who won't use questie anyway?
---
That's another excellent point honestly. Leveling alone in Vanilla can be really annoying and sometime you run into things you feel you simply can't accomplish. As soon as you add a friend into the mix it's a bit of a cake-walk.
---
I'll be the first to join your ridiculous Hunterfury guild if you promise that I get to be the scepter bearer when the pre-AQ event happens.
---
Alternatively, I'll take Atiesh.
---
You didn't lol you gave a vague answer about logging out. Which duh. 
---
Also that's the Lights Hope Private server you just linked. Which doesn't have cool downs and has adjusted timers.  So still no answer...
---
doh - forgot 1A: if you are at lumber mill in AB you MC people off the cliff
---
It’s not even a good dungeon tank spec
---
No, I'm saying you can't count on all of that 8-10% of the people hitting 60 to be available for your raid.
---
We have a source for the 2 months thing? I have been hoping they rush out BWL early, but seen nothing on it.
---
Well that's just baseless speculation.
---
Questing bro
---
Thank you, I tried to post the macros in their most useful format.
---
I wonder if you could get block rating high enough to solo something like Garr? I know it was possible in TBC. I doubt anyone had time to theorycraft/try it in Vanilla.
---
Why is a mage going to try to melee you?  I don't see the point.  I can already just sic my pet on them and have it stun them.  Or I could spec into tranq shot and move away, or I could scatter shot, or I could trap...
---
I mean there's probably some niche thing you can do, but I'd never consider it as my standard PVP repertoire.
---
I'd imagine orcs/trolls/tauren don't mind bad smells. Hell they might even enjoy them.
---
People need to just chill. 
---
I promise you a lot of people on the hype train wont even make it to 60 and raiding.
---
U a cute little fucker u know that? 😂
---
If you want to be efficient and not waste time wandering around figuring shit out, go ahesd and use a guide, i see no shame in playing a game the way you want to
---
Fuck cancer! I'm glad you got a chance to play classic with the rest of us nerds. Haha.
---
It’s not about clearing content, it’s about loot. People raid for loot and vanilla is pretty easy all content should be on farm status even if you let some meme specs in. The problem is people aren’t going to be happy when Jimmy the Balance druid gets a staff of the shadowflame or insert BIS caster gear here. The mages and warlocks will be upset since they’re doing way more damage and scale way better with that loot. So do you give Jimmy the loot or not? If you don’t then Jimmy is going to be upset since he’s showing up to raids like everyone else but isn’t getting rewarded for it. If you give him loot then the other casters will be upset. Meme specs just cause dysfunctionality within guilds. Instead of dealing with potential guild drama with meme specs feeling entitled to loot just don’t invite them.
---
I was a 13 year old tauren dps warrior and I still got a raid spot back in vanilla. The bis min maxers are a minority. Most guilds just want 40 people to show up regardless of what they are.
---
im sure that will stir up some heat lol. whenever it's multiple people attacking its way more enticing to join in than some1 saying help rogue is ganking meeeee! when i see that im like oh piss off u baby im not sitting around waiting for a stealth rogue to try and 1v2
---
I realize my specs look better than the min requirements but curious to know what kind of FPS/performance I could expect using the 'Classic' setting and medium/low for the majority of the features.
---

---
 Lol it’s not abuse to deadzone a hunter.
---
Pallies use a lot of their stuff too =P
---
But yeah you can get by pretty well with just flash of light, cleanse, hammer, divine shield, and BoP. 
---
But good paladins use Blessing of Sacrifice or Freedom extensively, aura swap when appropriate, divine favor+holy light when possible, knowing when to judge light (rarely, admittedly) rather than just judging command or righteousness for more damage.  Also using your own seals effectively.. There can be a lot that goes into paladin PVP other than just heal heal heal cleanse heal heal cleanse bubble.  An easy class to learn but plenty of things that more experience can bring to the table
---
Wrong
---
Looks like you're in North America. WoW Classic launches on the 26th for you. ;)
---
One of the guys I know who plays on a private server doesn't want to play Classic because he runs "the top Alliance guild" on his server.  I guess he's assuming he isn't going to lose his raider base when Classic drops?  I don't understand the though process.
---
That "evade" on that level 70 warrior definitely hurt :P
---
Those polls are very misleading and dont represent the actual population of each server.
---
People who take those polls are likely to be far more invested in the game and have better understanding of it than your average player, thus far more likely to hit lvl 60.
---
WPvP
---
Mages are constantly abusing the Deadzone with Frozt Nova, and the Hunter can not melee or range them.  
---
This is not about Mages meleeing you.
---
No you're wrong retard
---
You can easily Google the weap normalization formula to get a full understanding, its not hard. Slower weapons still hit harder than fast ones,  its just less of a difference. Just google, the formula pre normalization was like double dipping on weapon speed.
---
You just need a way to attach a spray nozzle that will rinse the bottles and PVC with water after each emptying. Totally sanitary.
---
The percentage doesn't change just because ~70% of people won't reach level 60.
---
If there are enough level 60's to create a 40-man raid team, the best estimate is that it will be:
---
Horde: 7 Warriors, 6 Shaman &amp; Warlocks, 5 Rogues, Priests, &amp; Mages, 3 Hunters &amp; Druids
---
Alliance: 7 Warriors, 6 Paladins &amp; Mages, 5 Priests, 4 Rogues, Warlocks, Hunters, &amp; Druids
---
The things you mention as bad, I view as an enjoyable challenge.  Sorry, but TBH, this post seems like one giant advertisement.
---
I’m going to have trouble finding a raid spot
---
I believe at that point, especially with the world buff meta currently, crit diminishes after a certain amount iirc so it’s not as valuable/big as many think. Spriest give a flat 15% damage to locks and people using Shadow Oil but a Boomkin giving 3% crit to 4 other people along with their low damage just isn’t enough to justify the spot to many RL’s
---
That's how I got in my guild back in vanilla, offtanked for Ubrs runs constantly with almost the same people, and that group evolved into an Mc raid and beyond.
---
It did have cooldown on WCB back when this was recorded. And what the fuck you mean by "adjusted timers"?
---
Here's how:
---
Step 1: Go to DMF if it is up. Spam DMF every 2 hours until you get a % you are satisfied with.
---
Step 2. Run to DMF and grab a leach(already cleared ID).
---
Step 3. Get a portal to Darnasus 
---
Step 4. Fly to Felwood
---
Step 5. Log off and get ready with the squad. 
---
Step 6. Have your Summon team in orgimmar ready. I can tell you how to get a summon team to org if you really want but I'll leave it for now.
---
Step 7. Grab the songflower with the squad and start getting summoned to orgimmar. 
---
Step 8. Log off
---
Step 9. Scout on your horde character(yes you have a horde character, this basically demands having 2 accounts) when the next buff will be available. It's 6 hours after the last one.
---
Step 10. When the buff is able to be popped have one of your friends who isn't getting WCB(it's only for melee) sit at thrall on his second char. When there's a level 60 approaching then quickly call out for everyone to log in on their char.
---
Step 11. Get MC'ed by your alt horde character with mind control helmet, this is available at lvl20.
---
Step 12. Get the buff 
---
Step 13. Log off and wait until you can get a summon to SW to get Onyxia buff.
---
Step 14. Either go to SW normally or log out after buff and wait for summon.
---
Step 15. Destroy the speedrun timers
---
In the retail melee way, no. In the utility over damage way, yes.
---
Druids are also really good in world PvP where they can pick and choose every fight they want to take and win pretty much any 1v1. I think they’re good in AB too in long, protracted flag defenses plus having the ability to stealth defend. Idk why he said they struggle in other areas, really the one BG they’re lackluster in is AV
---
Absolutely, so it will probably be really rough for most guilds to be able to down week 1, most likely week 2 and beyond will be easily killed.
---
Yup, Gotta start killing Luci early for Tranq shot.
---
Yes, Savory deviate delight normalizes Tauren hit box to the humanoid standard size.
---
undead locks will be welcome in most guilds, including mine, actually. Are you pretending to be retarded?
---
So... still relevant, especially to the comment I replied to that says he used polls but did so incorrectly.
---
I had already put in for a weeks vacation for the week that Classic launches due to a family vacation (yes, I am missing the first 4 days of Classic).  
---
I haven't told my wife that I am taking the week after we get back off as well to play Classic while the kid and her go back to school/work.
---
Nah its rfd.  Someone ran ahead and started the escort before people turned in the oathstone.  Group disband in anger.
---
Not even close to what we have nowdays. We have platforms with way bigger range than those days, we have an actual job for those who do it, nowdays being a pro is trending.
---
BFA is an anomaly of bad RPG design. You actually got weaker as you leveled from 110-120, the same mobs would be harder to kill on a fresh 120 than they were at 116. It actually felt punishing to level.
---
This is becouse of addons dps metters. Wow was a fun game in the past, but now It is Just numbers and numbers and If you don't have the numbers, I don't play with you. Item level Addon, remember?
---
Because arguing semantics over talent trees would invalidate 90% of Vanilla WoW due to the fact that talents changed *far* more from 1.0 -&gt; 1.12 than from 1.12 -&gt; 2.0. That's why I said I understand your point of but, but still disagree.
---
It creates class identity. All druids have innervate. All rogues have evasion. Its so bizarre to think there are hunters playing in retail right now that don't have traps.
---
All right then. Don't play retail to prepare, it have no value at all. Better off just wait for classic.  
---
Your in for a disappointment if you think Vanilla is the best thing since sliced bread. Vanilla is not that different from retail. Your talking to an adult who played both games for 15 years.
---
At level 60 the majority of your pre raid BiS for holy spec is cloth, leather and mail, and you are 100% okay rolling on that. While leveling I would not worry about cloth at all and people would be upset if you took it.

Na na na na na na na na please dont

Exactly, but a big group? Fuck yeah I'm down!

8 cores isn't enough. Get a threadripper 2990wx if you want to play at 1080p60.
---
Cool, now do mouseover sunder, mouseover concussive blow.
---
The OP mentioned watching twitch streamers and I assumed they meant tuning in and seeing where there are in the game not talking about being worried that the streamers will ruin their own server/leveling experiences. Hence the just don't tune in to them and you do you kind of thing.
---
No. Not at all. The extra hit can also miss, glamce, be dodged/parried/blocked.
---
More crit means your whirlwind, cleave, sweeping strikes and mortal strike and all abilities also crit more. More crit means more benefit from impale and deep wounds. More crit is always better unless you have alot of procs on hit like HoJ.
---
And why is that?
---
IIRC you get better dps just spamming Shadowbolt with CoS and Shadow Weaving anyway. The only DoT any lock might want to apply of their own is Corruption, and only if you are an Affliction/Nightfall lock. I think the 3/5 cast time of a Shadowbolt that you use for the GCD to cast Corruption only nets you more DPS on average if you have Nightfall, and even then, each tick is only a 4% chance. In conclusion, I think a lock can effectively "max out" as a DM/Ruin just spamming Shadowbolt with a CoS and Shadow Weaving up (and maybe a Shaman giving Nightfall procs, heh).

Best thing ive read in a while. Loved the baby dying part, that was genius.

Shitpost, go away.

---
Torn on this part, the talent system makes it a bit cumbersome depending on what you want to do.  For example, as a Frost Mage for PvP I'll definitely want that Freeze talent but for leveling / farming I wouldn't.
---
I thing I love about Vanilla was the way people experimented with builds. There was a lack of cookie cutter builds for quite a while. 
---
Full resto is certainly doable
---
Ally side priest is kind of an exception, humans and elf priests will still be welcome in guilds but dwarves will have an edge. For every other class, it doesn't matter. People are arguing that some race/class combos are BETTER, not that's they're MANDATORY. Learn some reading comprehension.
---
I'm fairly certain it was one of the dev interviews from a yt content creator. There was no precise date he just said their thinking is approx 2 months for the early ones and they don't know for the others but longer. 
---
It makes sense if you look at the calendar too. I bet if you compare the release content cycle with classic they are staggering to keep subs up. We're getting classic right around when release content is going to stagnate and then everything always slows during the holidays. Having some easy hype content that doesn't require much Blizz staff makes a ton of sense.

You can tell it's legendary because the tooltip says so! Nevermind its common drop rate

Spriest seems like a meme spec but they are actually by far and away more useful than any of the other classes listed. The more Warlocks you have the more value the Spriest brings especially if Melee are using Shadow Oil, so currently Spriests seem to have moved out of that “meme spec” light
---
WSG: Flagrunning as full heal spec
---
AB: basically you are useless as hell lol. Premades bring you because you carry them in WSG. You throw out some heals and go bear form to annoy people. You can also anchor something if the premade is low on anchors
---
AV: You heal or tank.
---
This is for premade but you pretty much do the same thing in pugs.
---
The reason a lot of players play wow, is because it is playable on a potato. And why add stuff when the game is good as it is?
---
Didnt play the same since we lost artifacts and got nothing in return. So it was even worse than just getting nothing.
---
Sweet now finish the other classes so I can reference your list against mine
---
Yeh the simple fix is to not watch streamers!
---
One great show I would recommend that you can watch while lvling, search on Youtube after the channel named Wonder, than sort their videos by popularity and than watch the 36 or so most popular videos.
---
It's just survival stories narratad but I have found them great to watch and listen to while lvling.
---
As long as you dispel right?
---
&gt;I signed a prenuptial

She got the whole computer then, huh? Sorry to hear that. I've still got my 2005 emachines with a 64 bit single core AMD athlon that I used to play classic on sitting in the basement somewhere. Onboard graphics built right into the motherboard! I'll cut you a good deal.
---
People really are underestimating how difficult it is to get 40 people in a raid and keep them engaged.
---
Some guilds still had (and have) problems with 25 man content, now add in 15 more.
---
You won't be overly picky after a while, at least if you are an average guild instead of one of those top dogs.
---
Agreed the numbers are all over the place. Hunter is one of the best dungeon dps classes. They have cc, can off tank, can easily hit higher level mobs, have high damage, and yet they are rated lower than the meme specs that will go oom every pull like balance, ele, and shadow..
---
I would agree it would be better to judge qualitatively. While a warrior dps may be 9/10 dungeons, good luck getting an invite to a group with a warrior tank, I'm not having you come in and roll on all my loot.
---
How is this any different than any other togglable graphic setting in the game???
---
It's an insight for people who don't know.
---
I remember when I went from Wrath of the Lich King to Vanilla. I didn't know what I'm going into.
---
I was confused that a 20-30 zone isn't taking me from 20 to 30.
---
I heard alot about much grind you had to do in vanilla but I was like *"it can't be that bad"*. It was.
---
Nothing can be more fun than a Windfury warrior.  It feels soo good.
---
I'm going to be using maps that show where to get quests in a zone. I will start by just doing what I find, then checking the quests map for hubs or lone quests.
---
On top of this I'll be following a leveling equipment list for bis and upgrade items that are good from quests.
---
10000 people on a server
---
70% don't hit 60 (the numbers re out there, it's something huge like that, pick something else if you don't like that)
---
3000 people at 60
---
1/2 are horde
---
1500 on your faction
---
150 are druids
---
You said 100 guilds, so we say 50 are your faction.
---
That gives you 3 druids per guild.
---
with needing 40 people in a raid, the OP is true. Often times we saw raids start 3-5 people down.
---
Resto is great in AV but in smaller pvp healing is kinda useless. Its more about utility like dispelling/purging and helping with burst and offheals. As shaman in smaller pvp you will use lesser healing wave and you dont need deep resto talents for that.
---
And everything that's not BIS or wowhead talents is a meme spec right?
---
hell yea - it's awesome floating down there and saving the day last minute
---
Nope
---
Made my day, perfect with lion king just coming out recently too!
---
It doesn't unless you can hit all 5 people in your party with it. It's one of those things that people talk about on the forums but in practice, your healer should never be within 20 yards of you, which means he doesn't get the buff, which means Battle Shout does less threat than it should.
---
Stick to Demo Shout and tab + Sunder Armor.
---
I'm not normally one to peer pressure but you should play classic. Come on, all the cool kids are doing it? Just try it. Play it for *one month*. What are ya, chicken?
---
Post specs
---
I disagree with what he said. Pservers have been overturned and armor values are way higher than normal. So wars will do more damage in comparison to pservers.
---
People pick war because it gives the true vanilla experience. And they are the only class in the game with all 3 specs viable in pve and Pvp.
---
You're welcome. I don't have much experience buying used laptops (I tend to keep one for years and years, then buy the best open-box one I can find at a retail store), but as long as you're confident in the product, I think it can be a great way to get a good product at a reduced price.
---
I've recently put up hotkeydotnet. I can share my script if you like. Glad to help a fellow dualboxer.
---
I am not going to do 2 attacks with one button. It feels like cheating to me. So I will control the shaman with my razer chroma while I play the mage with the keyboard.
---
This is funny because I didn’t think ANY of my IRL friends played until I posted a FB status asking who would be playing classic upon release. To my surprise, 10 or so of my friends (most of whom I would have never thought even played video games) responded saying they would be playing.
---
Yes, it was "given" back just for that, an orderly deletion.
---
I am going Horde with my friends.  Nothing is going to change that, I just wanted to see what people think World PvP will be like before BGs.
---
Played retail 2 expansions ago on a 2014 macbook pro and it was fine.

Which means im going to get a decent 2h on my Ret when every warrior on the server is fullequipped?

But if a mage is loading a spell in front you in your deadline, you can pop out of form and hit with Raptor.  
---
See the point?
---
Try to start the classic client directly, various folders are formed then including the Interface/Addons folder.

-4.8 crit. No less hit at all.

No reason to expect rogues to magically pull ahead of dps warriors. Sorry mate.

Classic WoW
---
Most tank warriors never go back to dungeons once they get their pre raid his. The amount of dungeon tanks is correlated to the amount of main tanks in the game or guilds that are forming. 
---
Once a tank hits raiding he never goes and do dungeons. And if a tank is doing dungeons he is gearing up for raids. And most raids only need 2-3 tanks max compared to the huge influx of wars in the game. This is why it is so hard to find a tank for a dungeon of ur not willing to pay for one.
---
yup gold goes a long way in wow.
---
Through the beta they found a lot of missing data, including a -1% hit penalty on your first +hit from gear, along with negation of +crit from gear.
---
Also, threat cap will be lower because of an increased parry chance on bosses. This will make rogues, with vanish, much better.
---
ALSO ALSO, pservers had wrong armour values, some even flat armour values across all bosses.

Okay, I must admit that I'm taking 60 frames + as a standard, so I doubt a 300$ card will be able to maintain that. But consider that the development of a minor feature like this will come at a cost. Not even considering the fact that the engine might not be optimized for this feature.
---
If a hunter was your top dps you might wanna check that half of your dps are still alive and didnt die a raid tier ago
---
Lol only in the very rare case that you get two crits will sword be better. What about the average case, where the hit misses or is dodged or blocked?
---
But is the IBM keyboard mechanical?

Blizzard has very strongly implied there will be realm lists before name reservation. Even if not, once you go to create a character you would have to select a realm first. You can not and have never been able to create a character without first choosing your realm.
---
Names will be sever specific like they always have been.
---
The 13th
---
Itll definitely run on lower settings just fine, just tweak them when you start playing.
---
Well the math I had there was assuming *every* 60 wanted to raid, and that just isn't the case.  There is no "disproportional amount" involved in this.
---
The time it took to organize 40 people was more then enough to farm some shards. Remember you shouldn’t be the only warlock in the group with summon or create HS
---
Lines like that really are easy when you understand the API. I recommend you check out a guide.
---
The real head scratchers are stuff like the HS/Cleave macro. That took me like a month of tinkering to get it to work and fit in the 255 limit. I actually found and fixed a bug while I was writing this post.

Yep, me saying that couresy isn't what defines your character makes me a shit person. Sick.

Ok, i hope low settings will work, I will just level on my commute to school
---
Tfury is legitimately the best weapon for a hunter tank, i'd suggest to pursue it and make a name for yourself rather than just farming shenanigans.
---
Dennis is asshole, why Charlie hate?
---
Your first % hit from gear is negated.
---
The crit negation doesn't apply to casters.
---
Threat cap is lower because tanks have to deal with 14% parry, making vannish much more valuable.

Aight. I'll do that

Do people plan on asking this every five minutes?

I think that you think that ray tracing automatically means you need a gtx 2080 TI to run it no matter what game. Sure, you need a 2080 TI to run BFV on Max with raytracing enabled. Ray tracing essentially cuts your frames in half, and considering that on my GTX 1080 @1440P can run Vanilla WoW at 200-300 fps, taking a 50% cut would not be bad at all.

Now I'm definitely going shadow priest!
---
It’s just the elitist edgy 20 year olds that propped up that ideology when private servers started coming around. Sure there were min/max guilds back in the day, but by the time the math was coming around, vanilla was more than halfway over with a majority of the playerbase preparing for TBC, which imho, is where serious theory crafting started taking place and where we saw classes and specs getting literally denied, rather than sitting in the back of the raid just playing.    
---
   
---
It’s sad really, though some of the specs are just flat out bad in vanilla, does not make them straight up non viable and “never able to find a raid spot”.. like shtt, on feenix we had a paladin tank all the way through AQ40 and parts of Naxx. We had boomkins/Gerald doing some decent damage after being straight up fed BiS gear, just so we could see how they actually performed rather than on a spread sheet. Having 12 hunters on some of our AQ clears just because some of the raiders were bored. Having night elf priests or human priests as officers in a “hardcore” guild.   
---
This notion of people gatekeeping a game because “the math says you’re at the bottom” is just stupid. Plenty of guilds will clear content and plenty of those guilds will have unorthodox raid set ups. It will happen. You people can’t stop it.    
---
Gatekeeping a video game based on math.. how pathetic and elitist do people have to be?
---
I played on an awful IBM thinkpad in vanilla and it was fine, I did not notice anything that put me off the game as I played for a long time.
---
RemindMe! 22 days

It's costly and time consuming, but still overall less than having to farm 1000G

Source: got my Charger on retail vanilla
---
Back in classic 1.0, players didn’t have addons that allowed them to spot and target healers with 0 effort. Most of the opinions for pvp on Classic now do not take those into account. When I was a priest in old classic healing in AV, someone had to take notice and come after me. 
---
We’ll see how it goes with addons now with hybrid specs. Could make it harder to autotarget you, or it could be like retail where half the enemy team is targeting you before you’ve cast a spell.
---
Not when you have a bunch of friends who owe you favors.
---
But when you crit with cleave or whirlwind, you crit multiple. When you proc sword spec you hit one person, or you consume a charge of sweeping strikes maybe. Better to consume one charge and crit than two and not crit. 
---
Again, impale and deep wounds make crit even better.
---
I got 3 (!) 6 slots before level 10 while questing on the last stress test and I felt like a fucking king.
---
Raptor strike critical hit on my BWL geared hunter hits another player for approximately 400. My bow auto attacks normal hit for 800. Why the fuck would you take the time to BE INSIDE your dead zone.
---
How do I save this thread
---
&gt; 8% to 10% of the available raiding population
---
Raiding population and general population are two different things.
---
Also, different classes will have different percentages of people interested in raiding.
---
For example, a lot of people roll rogues purely for pvp.
---
\&gt; ... from the time I get off work...
---
OK, you've done phase 1. I think we both know what needs to happen now.
---
I just got off the phone with my boss.  I now have to travel Aug 27-30th.  Oooooooof.
---
Good to hear thanks mate. Seems fine then at low settings no need to buy another computer. I played on nostalrius 1.12 client with ease, no raiding but this is reassuring.
---
The official minimum specs say "Intel Core i5 2.0 GHz or better" and it doesn't look like the MacBook Air has that.
---
The specs also require a Metal-capable GPU. The MacBook Air doesn't have that either.
---
I'm going to go with "no".
---
Also, feral druids aren’t flag runners. The spec generally gets feral charge in feral and a few points in balance but dumps the majority in resto.
---
Well the lowest spec 2014 MBP had a 2.6 GHz processor.
---
The lowest spec 2017 MBA only has a 1.8 GHz processor.
---
Soon (tm)
---
Battle shout generates 55 threat per buffed player spread to all mobs. I use this to generate blanket threat so I have time to tab sunder all mobs I’m tanking, before threat gets ripped from the healer or aoe.
---
Holy shit, you’re right.
---
If you know some useful macros for priest I'd love to see it.
---
For the racials and Dwarf priest thing, here's how I think about it. The horde doesn't have fear ward AT ALL, and they get along just fine. Noone gives a shit if not every single priest in your group is a dwarf.
---
It sure feels like it
---
Yourself
---
If you're using these macros when you're low level and don't have all the stances yet, can you leave them as is or do you need to remove the stances you don't actually have access to?
---
Yikes
---
Resilience (as a stat) doesn't exist, that was a TBC thing (unless you just mean they have insane 'tankiness', but as appropriate as that concept is it feels very off to discuss it in classic terms).
---
***
---
They're obviously horde, hence no Paladin.
---
I like pally, holy and ret. I played one and me and my friend are planning a pally and warrior duo.  
---
Again i'm just joking, people who think healer are just healing rods or that class have only one viable spec are in for a disappointment.  
---
Healers are the most challenging class to play.
---
Minmaxing is the greatest blight to this game and I only noticed it during private servers. I wonder if gaming culture influences it with speed running and attempting to "conquer" every game as if it were a series of tasks to be completed
---
I often feel like this minmax culture is the reason for Wpvp and RP guilds disappearing during Pservers, too. It takes away from the adventure and the RPG, if all you're doing is trying to 'win' instead of enjoying the fantasy mmorpg for what it is: Adventure! 
---
It's about the journey, not the destination. 
---
I really hope Classic WoW release brings back players who enjoy playing for the sake of playing, not to be the best or have the highest numbers and quickest times.
---
16 is already higher, the limit was initially 8.
---
Sweet. Thank you.
---
The worst thing about tauren hitbox, very seriously, is your easier to click in a big fight. BGs are chaotic, you move your camera a lot. Tab targeting takes a few seconds too if your not the first target. 
---
I could see how the fish could help in this situation but as a deadzone thing it does not have value.
---
No, no. He looked undead after all the surgery. And he likes to play with gnomes.
---
I actually didn't know it was that bad, I couldn't find a thread about it.
---
Well now I'm concerned about my 9590 and rx 580, I hope its enough
---
I find it funny how many people seem to think raiding is like an RTS game where you just select your units, their upgrades, and send them out in any order you want.
---
It's actually incredibly difficult to get 40 people to coordinate for anything! You're going to have to budge a little and MAYBE let that shadow priest come.
---
8.6 % != 8%-1%
---
All in all, warriors will be far more reigned in than people think, also a lot comes from the player and not the class.
---
Needless to say, I won't be giving any warriors a free ride to roll on pre-bis gear because they cant be asses to tank their own dungeons. Our guild will benefit much more from double the runs with no warriors doubling up on runs.
---
Vividly remember first time seeing a flagged PvP Horde so many levels above me they had the ??? Level and skull icon on their banner. 
---
Just sitting AFK on their Kudo mount near a random lake in the Arathi Highlands while I was questing from Rrfuge Point. Motivated me to continue leveling just to get mounted up!
---
Please quote me where I said anything about raiding crowd.

I said people who are more invested in the game, that does not mean hardcore raiders
---
No, you're wrong, retard.

I think they're both very camparable, however if you're geared well and have access to rank 14 sword or BRE, you should always use those. Arcanite Reaper is a very strong pre-rank Axe, if you don't have the gold for it, I would suggest using demonsheer, which is a sword from Strat living.   
---
However, the best PvP weapon in the game is Dark Edge of Insanity off of C'thun in AQ40.
---
i love the 2019 version of this joke lol
---
He's a kid in school. You could have found the specs yourself in the time it took you to write that comment.
---
Difference of opinion then, I'd rather people have options in how they play without repercussions for it.  EG on retail I always tank for dungeons but do everything else as DPS, no way am I doing that in vanilla so that just means there's one less tank out there
---
No it is MoM off Kel Thuzad.
---
Hey thex this is your nephew nimeral.
---
Ahhh, I was just lowkey trolling there. I thought you said undead because he was dead x.x
---
Reading all of this really brings me back to playing my warrior in vanilla.  This is a great refresher and amazing information for people who are unfamiliar.
---
I assuemd that was implied by saying it goes up each time you do it.. But thank you for clarifying.
---
Wtf, why is GoW so big?
---
Also you can finish people off with starshards for the ultimate embarrassment
---
I'd say no because at those levels the extra skill you have is negligable. You will likely be fighting mobs at your level or a few levels below, whereas to my understanding weapon skill works best against mobs above your level. Might be worth it if you are playing 2h fury but I'd say you'd get more milage out of the axe.
---
Wtf is this? Your lying to me.
---
Will Deep Wounds be a high priority debuff or w/e, causing warriors to not spec for impale in raids? Or was this only a private server concern?
---
&gt;4) No flying: Walking and running everywhere makes travelling a challenge to overcome and getting to your destination is a reward. It allows you to see the world and it also makes the world feel HUGE because it takes time to travel places. Azeroth has never felt big since flying.
---
A thousand times this. Flying took far more out of the game than it ever put in. Immersion wise, this did huge damage to the game.
---
I would take Dark Edge over it anyday, the stun from dark edge is basically mace spec, but you also get 5% crit from axe spec.
---
Yes wow consumed my life in my teens, it also kept me away from the coke, crack, and meth my "friends" started playing.
---
How about you try searching the sub before posting if you haven’t been here in months
---
Nope. Axe all the way. Slower wep speed = more damage with MS and easier hamstring kiting.
---
"8.6 % != 8%-1%"
---
???? What. Please explain your math more clearly. Though I guarantee you, mine is right. The blue post leaves out critical information. Each point of weapon skill decreases your chance to miss, beyond the 1% hit special condition. Confirmed in Beta.  My numbers are correct, as were private servers. This does make 305 much better than 304 weapon skill though.

He doesn't use every class call every attempt. If you keep trying you'll eventually get an attempt where he doesn't class call druids.

Mages should be a 10 in dungeons. They are the best 5 man dps, period. Best hard CC, best soft CC, best AOE, strong utility in portals, food, buffs -- no other dps can bring even half of that to the table.
---
You should really go gnome for the +5% intellect :P
---
Good point. Ty
---
Why would I google someone else’s laptop?
---
&gt; The official minimum specs say "Intel Core i5 2.0 GHz or better" and it doesn't look like the MacBook Air has that.
---
With Turbo Boost, which can run 100% of the time, the 2017 MBA runs at 2.9 Ghz.
---
&gt; The specs also require a Metal-capable GPU. The MacBook Air doesn't have that either.
---
Every single Intel processor that runs HD 4000 or later graphics supports the Metal API. He's two generations after that.
---
On retail vanilla, I was raiding 6 pm - 11 pm / midnight 4-5 nights a week (until Naxx wiped my Guild).  I think I missed out on some good parts of high school because of that, I'm 31 now and no way am I going to let WoW dominate my life again.
---
I'd like to raid for fun and hopefully with the knowledge available and the generally higher skill level a raid can just be a fun activity for a night.
---
I'm definitely surprised... I wonder how reflective of final numbers it will be.
---
Honestly, they're all going to be downranking with modifiers, mouseovers, and stopcasting. For example:
---
/stopcasting
---
/use [@mouseover,help,mod:shift][help,mod:shift]Greater Heal (rank 1);[@mouseover,help][help]Greater Heal;[@mouseover,harm][harm]Smite
---
It'll check for a mouseover, then your current target. It'll cast Smite against enemies, or Greater Heal for allies. Holding shift will down rank the Greater Heal. It will also stopcasting on repeated button presses, so you can pre-cast effectively.

Skarm is pretty confident that druids generate higher amounts of threat than warriors and can tank every boss other than a handful just as well as a warrior, and are preferable on a few bosses.
---
Rofl nice Logic plsnuse google this is common knowledge u unanalytical piexe of mind
---
Prot warrior got a 10 for raids
---
The fact that you have a "bench" probably puts you in the top 1% of raid guilds. Anyone who has done recruiting for a semi-serious guild can tell you how much of a pain it is to get people who don't quit after a week.
---
If you have 5% crit and you add 5% crit from axe spec, then you increased your chance to crit by 100%.
---
If you have 15% crit and you add 5% crit from axe spec, then you increased your chance to crit by 33.3%.
---
This is what I mean when I say that the flat crit chance gets worse as you get more of it.
---
Before name reservation is all that we know. And yes this does get posted every day in some form, a lot of them get removed I think.
---
Yeah I hear ya, good news too - it's still part of retail and you have access to both retail and classic with an active sub! So you can still enjoy that feature! POGGERS!!
---
Ratings are tricky, there is no such thing as a factual rating and there are so many different situations within each type of content so it would be impossible to be 100% on the mark. However, I do think it is a pretty good indication. Again, feel free to point it out if you have any specific ratings in mind :-)
---
Haha hell yeah. 
---
I discovered 6 guys I was in a frat with, an old college football kicker at a pac 12 school, Scottsdale Az nightclub bouncers, and managers in decent companies now. Off the top of my head. About 2/3 are picking back up classic. 
---
The kicker and the manager I was with this weekend and didn’t have the slightest clue they played/will play classic.
---
There's always a need to have at one backup  MT / OT to progress gear. The OT will often lead farm runs or just fill on bosses for practice.
---
I feel like this should be stickied somewhere at this point
---
You see that '2' in '2.0'... that stands for tbc
---
D2, since it was incepted, has always had the "feature" of deleting accounts that werent active. 
---
I don't know what else to tell you.
---
Original and Reforged Warcraft 3 will both be using the same client and engine, graphics will simply be interchangable.
---
Gnomes are clearly the master race. Forget about that whole gnomeregan incident. Just a small speed bump in world domination. Stand tall my gnome friends! Ok. Ok. Stand up a tiny bit!
---
Yeah, this is all part of the classic time and effort to reward system. A sense of accomplishment is found in deciding to put in the work to earn the gold to change your specialization,
---
Every single one has the same face though.
---
Armour values depend wildly on the server.
---
No confirmation can be had yet, because it cant be tested, but some servers likely had caster way low, or bosses like Garr and Golemagg high. Others normalized in the middle, so melee could see a buff on caster bosses.
---
The Crit and Parry nerf will effect warrior way more than rogues (Impale and threat cap), and anyone that isn't Human/Orc with correct weapon pairing will eat a Hit nerf.
---
Overall, casters and rogues are in a better place, and warriors got knocked down a peg.
---
-Druids don’t spec feral to run flags they do a tri spec with natures swiftness 
---
-You say they are great base defenders but wasn’t specific. They are the best point defenders in AB, they should never defend flag room in WSG
---
-Shadow priest rated waaaaaaaay too high in raids and BG’s. You are nothing more than a shadow weave bot in raids
---
-In BG’s you run out of mana too fast, especially if you are horde as priests are the only class with defensive dispel
---
-You say they have good burst damage but they have literally only one DD spell
---
-Prot Paladin way too high for dungeons, you will be running out of mana and slowing your group down
---
-Hunters rated too low for 5 mans. They have good dps, pet can off tank, and a CC that is not bound by enemy archetype (human, beast etc)
---
-You say “mages can crush any class in PvP”. I say “SL lock and spriest”
---
 -Ret is grossly overrated in the article but I know this subreddit has a hardon for them so I won’t even get into that one
---
I would often come up to a vendor, tab out, check something on the net, go for a smoke or whatever. Then I come back, "why was I standing here again? oh well", walk across the zone, kill 2 mobs, the bag is full. 
---

---
Yeah I love playing 26/25/0 paladin.  Divine favor + reck bombs and the other bonuses in Prot to PVP.  It's a really fun and strong healing/support spec plus the potential to one-shot people.  Helps to have BIS gear + corrupted ashbringer =P
---
It's such a big achievement because of the effort and time that has to go into it. Instant gratification holds no pleasure in comparison.
---
Same exact situation as me. Gnome master race
---
Yep, the gear was clearly made to fit the human models and the female orc has (by far) the closest thing to that body shape for the Horde.
---
Haha sorry man :D
---
Wait thats not shitpost, no way I am reading this.
---
A disproportionate amount of people play them, a disproportionate amount of people will main them, a disproportionate amount of people will be happy with the communities bias towards them... i don't understand the confusion.
---
Easy: Sword spec proc is more fun than more frequent crits.
---
That is actually crazy lucky.
---
Thanks for clarifying, remembered it completely wrong. Just remembered it was low and got higher. 16 seems so absurdly low still though, kinda crazy. If it was the original still, all the better.
---
Why play vanilla if you're not in it for struggling to learn bosses with a bunch of people. Sure, you can go in with an elite raid team and clear MC in an hour and then...? Is it really that much more fun than progressing slowly through the bosses?
---
I’ve leveled on those servers really late stage too and yeah it sucks, but it kind of just made me more hostile to the other faction. I wouldn’t let anyone live no matter their level after it happened to me and I became one of them by 60 😂😂
---
Everyone just used the addon decursive anyway, that's probably why
---
Omg this is the best thing ever haha
---
Yeah but retail sucks 😂
---
I’d assume they’d also want to keep an OT pretty geared in case the MT drops/gets poached.
---

Www.avoidstreamers.com

This is a legit honest question but don’t casters at that stage seem to prefer one hands like mageblade? My guild gave my resto druid staff of dominance as funzie PvP gear cause no one wanted it. Just genuinely curious
---
I'm rolling the most beautiful one, last one on the left
---
The good t h i c c
---
It sounds like you are scared of facing the shaman known as Thex.
---
You’re doing gods work.
---
They aren’t keeping anyone in the dark. They said the realm list would be released before character creation.
---
Take them head on like any other player?
---
Interracial mounting? In my WoW?
---
Best answer in here
---
Excellent post, thank you.
---
As a mage main, I'd only take issue with the idea that mages beat every other character/spec, easily. Depending on the patch, I'd have to watch out for warlocks of pretty much any flavor, BW hunters ("big red" could be scary if you were caught unaware but wimpy once it wore off), shadow priests (they really did melt faces) and, later on, geared druids who could either out-heal my mana-dump and/or break my line-of-sight to heal... and then moonfire spam when i'd try to drink water.. Stupid moonkin (i hate night elves lol) :p
---
Perfect 6.5/10!
---
If it is a need for the spec you are playing, in the dungeon, unless stated otherwise, you should need on cloth/leather/mail (since this is all you'll see until the way higher dungeons, especially with int/sp). Anyone who gets mad that a paladin (or clothadin) took cloth, while leveling, in a group, needs to stop acting like everything is theirs simply because its "their armor type".  
---
There's a reason paladins rock a crap load of cloth, especially going into the raids at 60.
---
Calling people holding dissenting opinions "snowflakes" is a sorely rehashed meme by now. But you're right, I'm deterred. I sincerely hope you have a great time come the 27th and that this kind of passive-aggressive toxicity can be avoided if we ever end up on the same server.
---
&gt;Shamans don't really heal in PvP
---
That's a slight misconception. Ele/resto is still a support and expected to do supporty things. They dispel poisons from allies, purge buffs from enemies, drop windfury for melee and heal the team when needed. And then they also drop thermonuclear bombs on the enemy from time to time.
---
Love the Swedish guild banter
---
Wow, thats amazing. I didn't know that honestly. I guess it'll be mostly night in Azeroth since that's when I'll play the most. You?
---

Oof too real, I didn't want to go to school because I'd just play WoW all day and night. Caused me to skip school a ton of days and have a truancy officer come and take me one day. Told them I'd behave blah blah. Well that didn't happen. Dropped out of my local high school and went to an online school and that worked fine. Just had to do assignments by midnight and it was fine overall. Following year I went back to a normal high school but BC came out halfway through it so I went right back to fucking everything up. Had to level my BE Paladin! Dropped out of that, went back to the online school. Finished high school with the online classes but lost all my friends that I made at both of the other schools just because I wanted to play WoW. 
---
Now I've got an ok job and took a week vacation to play WoW. Round 2 baby!
---
im all for #no changes ! oh wait! moonwalking was in vanilla and not in classic!
---
720P, low settings, you'll get solid FPS in the open world. Might even be OK at medium settings.
---
Nice, I will come back with results :)
---
I constantly use Wowpedia's commands and conditionals lists. They also have good guides for understanding the components of a macro.
---
I'm less familiar with Rogues. I can give a little bit of a summary for Shamans here. You'll want to use mouseover targeting and heal/harm on your spells:
---
/use [@mouseover,help][help]Healing Wave;[@mouseover,harm][harm]Lightning Bolt
---
You can also condense totem deployment with cast sequences. Keep pressing the same button to plop down totems in order. Probably the coolest cast sequence is for totem twisting.
---
showtooltip
---
/castsequence reset=7 Windfury Totem, Grace of Air
---
This will cast Windfury Totem, then Grace of Air. After 7 seconds the icon will change back to Windfury Totem and you'll know you need to press it to keep up the buff.
---
I'm really looking forward to banding together (and making friends) when getting ganked by the other faction in contested areas.
---
Played priest healer a lot.
---
What I found is in premade it's great as people look after you, but you are a dispel bot, still weirdly fun and great.
---
In random BGs, priest is far too squishy and you don't get looked after, ruins the fun when a decent group just keep targeting you first. If you feel you have people that will Keep you alive, priest is a great choice. Get engineering too.
---
I was wondering about this, do you need a VPN to do this? I'm probably going to be moving us -&gt; EU some time after classic starts, do I need a VPN then or have to start over?
---
My brother started playing before I did and he would tell me "you can't do that raid" or "you'll never get into a group for that". I ended up doing content that he never did, and he ended up joining the guild I was in. I think so people have to many preconceived notions and are too afraid to try. Just try it, it's a game, you don't have to play by any set of self imposed rules.
---
Strikers should never go to a tank over a fury. Onyxia head should be tank prio tho, for the neck, then fury, then rogue. Rogue has their T1+T2.
---
What ?
---
You didn't need him to post the specs. "cheapest MacBook Air from 2017" was enough to know exactly what he has.
---
no EU streamers to care about
---
Agreed, I played fem troll for so long once I switched to orc I was amazed how good everything looked :(
---
We will finally have to talk to people again. In legion there was no need for talking outside of raiding. You just solo everything, and even in dungeons there were no conversations.
---
But in classic, it will become necessary again.
---
I'm not disputing you, but the thought process would be why bring a boomkin just because they can outdps a hunter over another mage or warlock. The mage or warlock (assuming equal gear, or in some cases lower gear) would still easily outdps either.
---
Sad that there's not an option for RP PvP. Have we given up just because Ian said one time very vaguely that they weren't gonna have it? We can still make a lot of noise before release.
---
&gt; As all of us old gamers that we are now
---
Lol wut. 
---
&gt; i don’t have the slightest clue about streamers
---
Then why are you trying to dodge them?  Just because you heard somewhere that they will ruin the entire server if they even so much as make a character on it?
---
Just roll a paladin and carry your team in BG's/wpvp with heals, blessings, and buffs then turn on the rogue that opened on you and one shot them with reckoning. 
---
Don't know why people think it's all about killing blows when at the end of the day it's about winning and HK's which you will usually get more of anyway if you are a reliable healer keeping the group afloat.
---
When a Holy Paladin and a DPS warrior PvP in their raid spec and gear, and your getting camped because their nearly unkillable. 
---
We'll talk then.
---
Also Pally warlock duo leveling is a thing. I'd steer away from them if I was you.
---
This right here. Play what you feel like and just enjoy the game.
---
I have a class picking crisis just as much as anyone else, but it's purely because of aestethics and the relatability to the various races and factions.
---
they added gifts in sometime over the last year or so
---
Deep wounds will not get a debuff slot.
---
Getting lost and absorbed in the forests of Ashenvale/NE zones. And yes, NE music is simply sensational. I actually felt immersed in a virtual environment. Simply amazing.
---
You won't care about in on launch night.. you'll just be rushing to 60 just like most people that will stop playing by december.
---
Fuckin’ fantastic.
---
Thanks man! This game is meant to be a trip down memory lane for a lot of us, and a trip into the unknown for even more!
---
I'm glad your post has a lot of traction. I made one a few weeks back about it being okay to play on a PvE server and that you don't have to be on a PvP server. This community, while at it's core is great, has some incredibly toxic outliers. 
---
I'm ultimately going to play the race/class combos that I want based purely on what looks best to me. And you know what I think looks best for a hunter? That's right, straight up Night Elf. I'm going to play on a PvE server. I'm going to raid, and I'm going to do BGs. I have zero interest in rank 14, and I'm not gonna be upset if I'm not in a cutting edge raiding guild. 
---
The more posts and comments I've read about people freaking out on others, the more I"m leaning towards making my own guild so that I can make sure that anyone who has even an inkling of an interest in raiding can come get some.
---
I have no idea, i think someone said or i read somewhere that your subscription is bound to the region, so if you wish to play bot EU and US servers youd need to pay two subs. Sorry but thats all i know about the reagions.
---
Ah, ok.  I haven't played retail in a long while now.
---
I didn't find that to be true. 
---
I was a serious player from Burning Crusade through the next two expansions. I was in a small guild that worked with several others to form a raiding combine. 
---
I supported my guild, farmed pots and food and engineering tools to use freely for everyone. Was respectful, early, signed up, did my due diligence... but always seemed to lose my spot to some other higher ranked dps. And how did you earn rank? By running raids. See the toxicity?
---
I must have run a total of 10 over a three year period only because other higher ranked dpsers flaked or changed plans. Even when I did, I almost always lost out on loot rolls. Serious upgrades that would have really helped me, but only marginally helped the other regulars. 
---
Yeah... I'm a little bitter.
---
Eventually, I got tired of doing dailies and farming mats and slinging pots and weave and gold to the guild bank. I loved my guildies (not so much the combine folks), but there was a certain point where it just seemed fruitless. If I never got to see content or beat the expansion raid bosses, what was the point?
---
So... I gave it up. All of it. Canceled my sub and went back to single player or shooters. Freed up at LEAST 4 hours on a daily basis. 
---
Ultimately, I think it was for the best.
---
So, when you say that's bullshit? Maybe things have changed, but I didn't find that to be my experience.
---
Damn you kids and your dastardly cryptocurrency mining. 
---
Seriously, thanks for this. I get that everyone gives people a lot of shit for possibly actually making something of value BEFORE reposting it here, but it looks a lot cleaner than vanillaguide, and I don't know how people are expected to find new apps if they don't see them posted. 
---
Looking through the "popular" section of addon websites is kinda hit or miss. you find a couple things you already knew about, then you find a bunch of stuff that you have decided not to use for a reason.
---
RnG can mean a guild only sees 5 mage blades well after BWL comes out. Also, notice how the item went to a druid that raids resto? The druid who got the item will continue to raid as resto becausr Boomkin are a meme spec and nothing more.
---
This is absolutely true.  I played a vanilla tauren hunter, and you know what pissed me off in AV?  Gnome warlocks with a blueberry.
---
I actually went out and got a mod that helped select clothies.
---
GS + prenormalized xbow of smiting (or the 32 green) was money.  So OP in AV.
---
Thanks alot! Lots of knowledge 🙂
---
Check my post history, I tested a slightly-newer laptop in the Classic Beta. It was solid.
---
Make the only correct choice and ditch Horde. Roll Alliance and be a paladin.  Heal and blessings and carry your entire team to victory.  Be loved by all (except the horde crying because they don't have bubbles or BoF).
---
Is the glowing hands bug in classic?  They patched it multiple times in vanilla so I'd assume no.
---
Damn, really made me feel the feel.
---
Also you have a giant lightning sword, striking fear into the hearts of your enemies.
---
Too bad rogues never get any t3 pieces because of warriors. :(
---
the elitism / gatekeeping in gaming are catching up with the real world.  the parallels with poverty are absurd, we now see the "poor" of the gaming world -- those who live by the charts and texts -- deriding the other "poors" for simply living their lives -- playing the game -- in a way that works just fine, and is arguably better.
---
i've been playing video games online forever and people are now so sold on the idea that you have to play the game a way an errant video or forum post tells them they have to.  used to be we just played the games and did well or not.  it sucks.
---
Not a single mention of Escape Artist or Stoneform, which can easily win fights on their own. Nice try kid.
---
Well done! I really like the complexity that simplifies stance dancing.
---
It's going to be way easier on Classic. Recent private servers launches had pretty aggresive dynamic respawns that made it though to navigate that cave. The respawn time has been wrong aswell.
---
In classic you can expect a respawn timer of around 5 sec for the chests and the mobs wont spawn on top of you. Good luck!
---
Great post and guide
---
Just what i've been looking for to be honest (the ally one). A guide that I can jump in and out of as I please.
---
Whats with all the hate? OP obv spent alot of time on this guide and the post is alot more helpful/relevant than most posts on this sub.
---
Appriciate it OP
---
The weak ones do
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Yeah. I feel like the phrase I would use is "possible to fail". 
---
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to be level 9, see a prowler, and hit it until it dies. 
---
The difference is that it is POSSIBLE to die doing that. You can get greedy and attack when you aren't at full health. after all, you don't want to waste your time eating level 1 food, but level 5 food might be kinda scarce and expensive. 
---
Or maybe you forgot to repair your armor. Or maybe you accidentally get too close to a bear and it aggros. or maybe you are level 7-8 and you fail to notice that this prowler isn't level 9, it's level 10. Or maybe you cheaped out and didn't buy the gladius at level 5. 
---
Or maybe you are in frostmane hold and you got that -5 damage per hit debuff on you from the shadow casters, and you try to duel a hideskinner.
---
Any of those things could be enough. 
---
Killing prowlers in eastvale is not "hard", particularly. But it is possible to fail at it. It actually matters if you say, are well geared, or have a food buff, or have high quality food, or have rallying cry of the dragonslayer. 
---
These things can make the difference between able to do something you might want to do, and not able to do something you might want to do.
---
It's not a meme, they are terrible. Blizzard just botched the spec design.
---
Gnomes are KoS. I'll find you
---
Sure there is. Just kite Neff around and Battle res people that die.
---
Pretty much. It's not even every warrior on the server tho, just your guild. Hopefully most of your warriors are running dual weild and have death bringer and Cho axes before Ashkandi drops. 2hs are low demand for most warriors, you'll likely get a hand of rag, untamed blade, or an Ashkandi if no one needs it main spec.
---
I've been playing on private servers for a bit of time, you sound like you have been out of the loop for a while. Do you realize how little you will use the zg set and how much it takes to get to 300 in tailoring? You use the zg set to get better sets. You will spend more time getting it than you will use it, it's just stupid to only go tailoring for that alone.
---
This. Also racials matter very, very little in organized PvP
---
I'm torn between a human Warlock or a ne priest.
---
As fun as a warlock is and as good as it would be to just fear the shit out of everyone, stealth and mind controlling people off cliffs sounds fun too...
---
Argh. Must choose!
---
Thank you.
---
That's how this sub is. If your post isn't a low effort meme picture then it's not going anywhere.
---
You have to go thinking the min/max is a waste of time and don't have any real value in the game.  
---
The real difference would be someone who pop a potion vs the one that do not. Someone that have his cooldown ready vs someone who does not. You could have the best abilities in the world, if your teammate suck you will lose.  Other things have way bigger impact than racials.
---
yeah, when most of them will be ret/reck and be useless in group pvp.
---
Holy is awesome in group pvp, but for some reason people want to play a meme spec.
---
In the meantime, most shamans will go 30/0/21 cause it's the best by far, and super fun, and destroy alliance pugs
---
Yes, and even at 60 you can tank dungeons as Arms or Fury. You just might want to make your life easier by grabbing 15 or so points in Prot for that endgame stage. Full prot is in no way necessary unless you're MTing raids.
---
A roll in the hay that is
---
In classic wow there are very few mechanics to help get mana back during a fight, which is a big part of why several classes are meme specs or considered bad, moonkin just doesnt have the mana to sustain damage to keep up with other caster classes
---
Inb4 everyone dead to breath or cleave
---
Even casually you can gear up through dungeons.
---
You will still be fine for BGs, as they are always filled with people in various states of gear.
---
You can also get some very good gear out of ZG and AQ20 which can be PUGed.
---
You could kite him around with cat sprint and just B Rez people. I'm not saying it would be good, but it COULD be possible. Imagine if you all had naxx gear for the attempt!
---
Yes its wierd that none of the healer classes gets a 10 at anything healing related.
---
Maybe something along the lines of;  
---
[Duxy's BTEX Skins: Elven](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info22475-DuxysBTEXSkinsElven.html)  
---
or  
---
[Xart Skin - Warcraft 3 Orc](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7126-XartSkin-Warcraft3Orc.html)
---
Not the worst thing.. the starting zones are going to be grueling. Anyone not playing a hunter is going to have a heck of a time even tagging mobs.
---
I don't think Warriors are a good class for casual leveling or gearing.  They're incredibly weak levelers (unless you just spam dungeons) and incredibly gear dependent.
---
I would pick a class that can do a lot more with a lot less (like a Mage)
---
I had to re read that a couple times. Haha
---
Well you have a threat meter you can assume who is going to be the target in order. Hence the battle res. It's going to be incredibly difficult and require Olympic levels of sycronization.
---
Reminds me of Gravity Falls:
---
“Ugh! This is like ‘Homework - The Game’!”
---
His enrage gets overstated. A preraid BiS tank with appropiate consumables can soak it without issue unless the healers are bad (not precasting heals).
---
How does the guide handle jumping in and out of?  
---
For example, say the starter areas are packed and you do a fedex route to level 10. Are you find just hopping back in at the 11-13 Loch Modan section. Or if I grind out a couple levels somewhere else with friends, is it easy enough to just hop back in whereever?
---
You can see the amount of honor you have, but I don't think there is a way to 100% know the results of the amount of honor at the end of the week, since you don't know the amount of honor the other people on your realm have.
---
But there seems to be addons out there which calculate in which "bracket" you were in the previous week, so you know what you can expect with the amount of time you invest. Haven't seen one for classic yet, but if it's possible with the api I'm sure someone will remake it.
---
In the end it depends on how active people on your server are and how big the population is, I would assume it takes less time in classic then on private servers, since on official servers there will probably be more casual players then on private server.
---
Don't see why not
---
Congrats man! Have fun
---
I get the impression you want to play shaman but they're horde only in classic. Alliance racials aren't that bad, perhaps more situational than the hordes. Night elves get invisibility, good for avoiding fights in open world. Dwarves get immunity to bleeds and poisons and 10% armor increase, good against rogues, warriors and feral druids.
---
No where hard as you think it is :)
---
Important as a tank, you will get whispers to tank dungeons a lot, if your busy or not interested just reply with a "sorry cant" or something, it goes a long way.

It was definitely nice to have in PVP, but there were still some downsides. When you’re waving that giant lightning sword around on the battlefield, you instantly become a target. There were times when I considered using a weapon swap macro just so I could swap out of it and be a stealthy Rogue again...and then I came to my senses, popped Adrenaline Rush and carved my way through enemies like the whirling dervish I’d become.
---
Until you wipe at 3% because your dps was too slow and your healers went oom, or a boss enrages. Assuming you had 5 loladins over warriors, that's 750 dps you are losing overall. It doesn't sound like a lot of damage on paper until you're lacking burn to kill Nef or Huhuran and keep dying sub 10%.
---
Great Job.
---
Ya I'm not sure why he lists human. Part of the problem with alliance players is they always roll NE and Human, which have the worst racials. It would be like all the horde rolling troll.
---
I considered mage seeing that I’ve never Maine’s a caster. But I’ve always enjoyed more of a melee play-style. Hence the interest in shaman
---
Success tip #12
---
Will nefarian only use class calls for the classes that are in the raid? If he does, there is nochance at all. 
---
But even if he just have random class calls, I do not see how you will survive a druid class call with no healers.
---
On very low settings.
---
Filthy casuals playing 6 hours a day and saying "oh God I'm such an addict". I play at least 58 hours a day.
---
I've played WoW since Vanilla and still don't understand Macros.
---
Yes sure, just on low settings for a playable peformance
---
&gt;alliance rogue: you'll face stun resist, which counters rogues, plus you don't have wotf
---
Horde rogues have to deal with dwarves. It honestly can crush them if stoneform is used properly. It's definitely up there with the stun resist, for being incredibly frustrating as a rogue.
---
Oh no, I can agree the leveling can be quite boring but I always spec into prot once I get 40 and group pull everything.  That make things a bit more fun.
---
There is a lot that is good about vanilla, but flat out broken specs is not one of them.
---
I played a gnome rogue and their racial ability escape artist was great for escaping being rooted.
---
Or humans for bags to Sell in /1
---
imagine not having every quest memorized LMAO
---
Avoidance doesn't replace Crits on the Attack Table, it bumps Hits off the table first.
---
A crit doesn't get bumped until you are crit capped.
---
Sword spec attacks CAN miss, or be avoided.
---
They are very close overall, and both are fun. Just go with whichever fist your best weapon.
---
I know, it's such a big part of the game that has been missing for so long.
---
Ret palas too, if we are gonna go there.
---
I mean the obvious solution was leave the guild. Not be their bitch boy for 3 years, farming their mats.
---
Nobody is going ret/reck because it doesn't work.
---
Wondering if Icecrown looks like in W3:FT (icy throne in the middle of the zone) and then actually travelling there through Crystalsong Forest and seeing the nasty saronite architecture and hordes of undead creatures...completely mindblown. I also really enjoyed the Argent Crusade/Ebon Blade questchain in Zul'Drak (lower floor). The eerie atmosphere was just perfect.
---
I don't know why getting this replay was so hard, ripperino karma for one simple replay that could have been posted instead of trolling a post that is a legit question and curiosity.
---
Just play horde you baby lol
---
Wow actually helped me with anxiety and depression. I'll spare you the details but it was a dark place and sort of hopeless and WoW gave me a sense of purpose and stability that helped me. Peace.
---
It’s good to have a few shamans for raid healing and totems, yeah, but better than priests? No.
---
Fair enough.
---
Well I cant comment, levelled as an UD healer priest back in the day alongside an UD warrior. Needless to say we did well in WPvP
---
Already did the math for you.
---
Crit does nothing to affect the damage of your abilities that are already crits. Sword spec can proc on abilities that crit (and then those extra attacks can also crit).
---
Agreed. It's crazy that Blizzard has totally removed any real talents from the retail version..
---
Dropping the tired ass 2004 memes. Nice.
---
Actually, I was hesitating between warrior and mage so far. Warrior has my clear preference gameplay-wise, and I love how humans look, but I think you need much more ingame time than other classes to play a warrior, also while human is good in pve, it has meh racials in pvp
---
This is terrible. There is more incorrect information than correct information in the answers here.  Come join the Fight Club discord if you want real answers to your questions!
---
None.  You don’t make gold farming mobs between levels 10-20.
---
That could work too! Thanks for the suggestion
---
It's unlikely. The x5-z8350 is barely half the speed/power of the recently announced minimum specs for Classic (Intel E6600 or AMD 8750). Also, that processor only supports up to 2GB RAM. The other 2GB you have installed is not being used.
---
I can't wait to see a mob that's 2 levels higher than me and think "oh christ, please help me."
---
I spent my life killing people in the ah.
---
Sit there in stealth and when they buy an item their character waves it's hand in the air. When that happens you know that they are stuck on the auction page and cannot fight back ;)
---
Don't worry man, sometimes people just don't make sense
---
I love seeing you debate with a brick wall. (Not sure who it is because I have them blocked due to previous shenanigans)
---
I was gonna take a leave from work on 27th, but a coworker screwed me over and took this time for his leave, so I managed to pry 27, 28 and 29 from my boss and will take my leave on Sept 2nd. I still will have 2 or 3 days of work before my leave starts and after that I still will have work so I won't be able to play that much and I think after the first 20 days my hype will die down and I will still play but not as much and will go back to my old playing of 2-3 hours per day and have the rest for real life responsibilities.  
---
I don't know how much will I play of Classic, but I'm still very excited at this point and I don't plan on nolifing it any longer than my 3 days off, the 3 days before/after work and my leave. I love WoW, but I don't think I can addicted as much as I did back in 2007-2008 when I started. Back then I had to repeat 10th grade because of WoW. xD
---
I love this post please let us know the results.  Also send a selfie of you on the bus playing.  Do what makes you happy bro.
---
You can group with anyone really, but if you are much higher level you will hurt their xp gain some and you wont get much xp at all if you are doing content too low of level.
---
Ripperino karma in a thread that’s 15% upvoted

OMEGALUL
---
Ignore this guy. There's plenty of stuff you can do while on the bus. Gathering, crafting, farming mobs. I've got no idea why he's being such an ass.
---
Perditions Blade BRE easy.
---
Yeah man, really annoying ... "Yay, level 22, whoop whoop"
---
Sorry. Maybe gold is the wrong word. I’m just looking for a way to make some money while waiting on my main
---
Just get a warrior friend to pvp with and pocket heal them.
---
Logithex G600 baby
---
I’ll mainly have a lock friend but sometimes a warrior friend so this could be an idea
---
I get that, I've *only* played melee classes (Paladin in vanilla, Rogue in WotLK-MoP, Warrior in MoP, DH in BfA).  Shaman's okay but you're *really* going to be subpar with Enhancement/Elemental without gear.  Even with gear you're good for bursting people in PvP and that's about it.
---
Arms is a thousand percent better than prot until you can stancedance and have anger management. It just makes life so much easier as a tank. An arms warrior who has those points will be a better tank than a prot warrior who does not at any point until 60.
---
Having said this, anger management + deep prot will make life easier, but it's still very much doable to go no prot and fury or arms.
---
It’s not worth it.
---
Most raids will have 2-3 tanks , mainly because it is worth gearing multiple incase of absence.
---
Overall I would expect 2-3 Prot, with another 6-8 warriors in the raid.
---
What lotsa people seem to not mention at all is server balance. I played on a 70% alliance server... which resulted in 30 min minimum queues to 2-3 hours for arathi. There was pretty much only 1 really good team on the horde side. Ours had 3 grand marshals. So for me pvping ended up 90% farming herbs or doing nothing  and then win a bg in 5 min or something. So depending on what you want choose wisely cause what I experienced was annoying as fuck. Something which lotsa players here don't seem to remember.
---
I'm playing hybrid paladin and theres nothing any of you can do about it.
---
There is no mentoring system like EQ2. If you are significantly different level from someone there is unfortunately no way to play with them where you can both receive experience.
---
Survival hunter are great at PvP and dungeons. While not as great as BM for leveling and solo PVE they are still top tier.
---
I read everywhere that Fury is preferable to Arms, is it such a big difference? I want to play Arms Orc Warrior with Axe Spec like I did 13 years ago.
---
LOL awesome.
---
tons of people will unfortunately, then they'll slowly understand how useless it is and slowly switch to holy for pvp
---
It just seems weird to me to tell a potential raider "play what you want", because you're just assuming for them that they won't go past BWL in that case. There's nothing wrong with telling them the realities of end game raiding as a meme spec so they know what they're getting themselves into, in case they have aspirations.
---
As for shadow weaving, as the quote above states and every veteran priest I've heard talk about this comes to the same conclusion: it's not worth going full shadow for shadow weaving. They'd much rather you go holy weaving and take a healing decrease than be a mediocre dps that is only there to buff a few others 15% and run out of mana. 
---
This all goes completely out the window in the case you're good friends with the right people of course
---
This is sounds right, but still: swords &gt; axes
---
Error speech is easily removed with a interface toggle. Getting rid of the red msg is usually just a quick addon away.
---
A certain number of your attacks are already going to crit, with or without axe spec. Crit chance does not increase the damage of your abilities that are already crits. On the other hand, sword spec can proc on abilities that crit (and then those extra attacks can also crit).
---
It doesnt fucking matter though. 5% is 5%. Yes, there is a chance you crit and proc. But that dps difference is tiny compared to impale. Do the math. 
---
If we had a talent that said "All your extra hits gain 20% damage" or "All your extra hits apply a bleed", then it might change. Gymnastics bro.
---
I only play a little of Cata, less than 20 hours, and WoD, quite a bit. I am so pumped to get to experience vanilla now that I have a steady job and a friend to level with that has played since the game started.
---
I can’t wait to duel wield one handed weapons as a warrior.
---
They remade classic character models and it's not accurate and its gonna ruin everything for me
---
No half measures.
---
I'm taking Notthex.  Just so there's no confusion on my server.
---
I’m going to solo level a warrior. And thought it might be nice to have some more silver in the early levels to buy a piece of gear from the auction house etc. (I’ll Level kinda slow and want to optimize my time used in wow)
---
I spent months planning the class for min/maxing and rushing through the game and even tried out multiple routes and such on private servers, I was decided to make my lock on the Horde because of all the fuss around UD raciais and yada yada yada. Until the point during one of the “tests” I noticed It felt more like an obligation. I always played Horde and I really want to try ally, also I love the way the cloth sets look on Gnomes, and find them supper funny ( can’t understand why so much hate on those lil people)  so I am trowing all my plans out of the window and will peacefully play the game on my own speed on the character I fell like I enjoy the most. Not saying you should do the same but, dunno, think about it.
---
Ps. That was until few days ago. Now I’m deffo running a Troll Shaman named Thex!!!
---
You generally get -50% experience for grouping with one person and then +5% experience from there for each person added to the group. 
---
Then, you get -X% for the level difference between you and each party member. 
---
Anything past 5+ level difference equates to nominal experience.
---
I'm planning on making a Tauren Night Elf, will I have any trouble finding a raid spot?
---
you only need quest reward gear to heal while leveling.  Zero reason to roll on cloth early game.  So yeah, SFK in particular don't touch the robes, they're good for casters and you don't need them.
---
On the other hand, roll on the +STR ring from SFK or Corpsemaker from RFK even if you're healing.  This changes endgame, you do roll on heal gear and don't roll on melee.  Around Mara is probably when it starts to change, pala rolling on stuff like the +hit ring is questionable.
---
Depends. You'll almost certainly not be first, but there's a lot that goes into a guild's choice. If you're a friendlier, more reliable player who's closer to the guild than warrior #6, you'll probably get it before them. Guilds aren't super egalitarian. If your raid likes you more, they'll let you get loot before your spec might otherwise deserve it.
---
If the mobs are grey to one member of the party, the experience reward is divided in half.
---
You shouldn't need much money for anything until your mount at 40. And you make way more money farming lvl 36-40 mobs than you do anything lower level. So don't worry about farming gold at all until your nearly 40. Then one you get your mount, don't worry about farming gold again until your level 60.
---
Minus three karma FeelsBadMan
---
Case closed.
---
I don't know that that data is out yet. You could go to classicdb.ch and run spreadsheets for mobs to compare expected value (and I did), but I quickly became suspicious, for a few reasons.
---
First of all, there are some weird drop rates that I think need to be tested in the beta. For example, the level 1 wolves in northshire abbey? look at [their drop tables.](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=299).
---
That's crazy. HUGE amounts of vendor trash. if we figure that the average drop for a 1-2 item is 1.5, they are dropping like 8 copper worth of teeth and pelts on average, at level 1, per mob. 
---
Now compare to [kobold vermin](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=6). 
---
The expectation value of this mob is nothing like as good. As in, "1c vendor trash instead of 5, one third the drop rate, two thirds the average quantity, and a trivial amount of money (2c). 
---
Young wolves literally drop like 4 times as much money in vendor trash and gold as kobold vermin... and this kind of holds true across the zones. Find the weakest beast in the zone, it probably has an insane drop table on classicdb.ch.
---
I started the project you are asking for but I quickly abandoned it as I realized the numbers just wouldn't be useful without beta testing. Is this actually a true to the beta/live version thing? or is it just some mistake?
---
Also, there are some systematic errors to be introduced to the data that make even generalizations hard. For example, beasts versus humans. The typical method of collecting drop rates is for the databases to record loot results from people with their addon installed. but how does the game even know to include results where a beast drops nothing? 
---
What if a beast has no vendor trash, but no one bothers to loot it because it obviously is empty? This is likely to skew drop rates, just as quest items will also skew drop rates.
---
If you compare two beasts, what is to say that they have the SAME chance to drop nothing and therefore not be recorded in the databases?
---
Okay thank you for your help :)!
---
Weaponskill is only every really important if you're fighting things 3 levels above you. The trick is to be within 10 points of the targets defense which is 5x mob lvl.
---
So + weaponskill will have a very swingy benefit in a leveling scenario where you won't have your ws maxxed out most of the time, and the level of the mobs you're fighting also varies wildly.
---
But weapon speed is always great. 
---
So go with the axe.
---
Also the nearest upgrade is either bonebiter or spin to win from Armory, so axes is the name of the game for the next few levels, saving you a respec with arms.
---
Hah I was the same. My buddy was on a top progression guild on another server. I wouldn’t get home in time for raiding from practice and his raid started like an hour later than mine. He’d hop on my rogue and he was flashing up top DPSing and shit and then there’d be me popping in. After 2 weeks of that I eventually just had to ask him what he was doing. I got good because I got exposed. But would have never changed if you we didn’t start doing that.
---
Most of the threat issues in dungeons I find come from being rage starved rather than being out DPSed. In that case Imp. HS isn't going to help you anyway.
---
That's what I thought, all though I've never played classic wow before there should be something I could do on a 30 minute trip. Looking forward to it! I will update on how everything works out :)
---
A lot of good points, moonkin did get quite a bit better by the time 1.12 came around.  One other thing is that the next rank of Starfire drops in AQ20 and helps quite a bit.  I believe druids were the only hybrid to get a new rank of a damage ability from AQ20.  Still, in high tier raids as everyone points out, their damage doesn't measure up.  But I found moonkin enjoyable in smaller raids/dungeons and pvp.  Unlikely to get the top quality gear for a long time because there isn't much great leather dps gear for casters, and mages and warlocks will get priority on the cloth.
---
Or buy weapons from vendor.
---
I think it is a good idea for someone who is maining warrior at launch to have something to do at downtimes
---
I got rid of my thistle tea recipe too! Not because I didn't want it but because I couldn't be bothered to level any profession above 30.
---
I thought that shamans were decent in pvp and were good at 1vX in certain situations? Doesn’t their mobility/utility and ability to heal make them formidable? Or is the damage output too inconsistent to make a difference?
---
Make Wetlands wet again!
---
Even though I don't want dual spec or cheaper respects, just know that in the beta they needed respects to silver. So it was 5s to 50s max, not gold. So blizz is def aware of the cost of respects, but I doubt anything will come from it in classic.
---
This post hits hard. Literally why I gave up on trying to raid/this game because I felt like I couldn’t play the classes or races I found fun because I feared rejection from groups.
---
Yup, honestly I was getting sucked into all this min max bullshit then realized when I first played WoW I picked a troll because they looked cool and a warrior cause fighting people was badass to me as a young kid.
---
I still got into a few raids, but I wqs a young brat so I got kicked out of the guild. I rerolled a undead mage because undead looked badass and mages magic looked fun. I was able to raid more than before found a good guild I liked.
---
All that matters is getting into a solid guild. If you don't have a raiding spot, big whoop find another. If people in my guild were acting like people on this sub I'd quit or tell them to cut that shit out or fuck off. It's annoying. I'm about to roll a dice 50 times now to pick my class since I'm deciding between 2 this sub wouldn't want me to have and I love both anyways. Gonna do the same for my race. Undead or troll warrior or mage, gonna go to just playing for the fun.
---
I will sure do that! Hope it works out fine need to use all the time I get to grind those lvls and enjoy the game :)
---
People have this misconception that raiding was hard in vanilla. The only thing that made it hard was we were playing on a machine that had less power than your average smart phone.
---
leveling, I disagree.  Shaman in RFK helps the group by filling the healer role, you think that means they shouldn't roll on Corpsemaker?  Why?
---
I'm extremely suspicious of these numbers representing any final population. I've seen a private server launch, and even if the balancing was a smidge off, it looked very much like this guide describes and not how the poll shows.
---
Most likely it's a selection bias towards what the hardcore/tryhard players will be maining more so than what the total population will look like.
---
Ehhh. The second they realize they can't abuse that /sit macro to proc it, theres not a lot of reason to keep the talent.
---
"Under-rated comment"

---
No, it's not that simple: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Formulas:Mob_XP
---
Well its not Classic because it doesn't say Classic on it. And it does match the artwork from the 15th anniversary collectors edition they debuted a couple months ago.
---
They do replace crits if there's enough of them. That's how being uncritable works. 
---
Not that relevant outside of a rogue popping evasion or a warrior with shield block, which, lol.
---
What's the deal with that damn third finger button? I feel like I could never get comfortable resting my ring finger on the mouse.
---
I mainly focus on end game but to me a leveling Shaman is just a worse Rogue
---
Otoh, if you have any procs, they will work off of sword spec and not off of axes.
---
It'll depend on the rate of procs for swords.
---
And if you have a sword, axe or mace.
---
Well really it's not a hard rule, ask and establish ground rules with the group
---
Listen, your opinion is fine and all, but that sort of attitude will make it so you can’t find a raid spot.
---
Just for vendor gold you probably just want to get leather.
---
Farm cloth, craft robes, disenchant, make wands and sell to lvlers. Or leather (need skinning+LW+enchanting then).
---
At a little higher lvl (~23) you could try to farm Tiny Crimson Whelpling pet and leather. That pet won't sell for much until people have a lot of gold though.
---
I think wool cloth has great value but probably not great when so many lvl.
---
Can fish Deviate Fish, Oily Blackmouth, Firefin Snapper and use herbalism for stranglekelp in the areas where those pools spawn (valuable but not too early). Also gives no xp.
---
Awesome lol
---
So you’re saying that a Ret Pal is better right?
---
Balance druids: So that was a fucking lie
---
summoning takes about 40 seconds with log out included lol
---
How else do you think they had 50 min uptime on the video i linked?

Everything hit goes to tank. Strikers is bis until AQ for tanks
---
You'll be just fine at low-med settings. One of my computers is a 2016 MBP with the Intel Iris 550 and it plays modern WoW at medium around 30fps or so.
---
Sadly not. You need level 5 to pick it up, and 35 to max. Dont remember the level required for ranks in between, but either way some leveling required
---
While leveling, "healer" should be nobody's main spec.  You can't heal mobs to death.
---
That been every expac since cata bud
---
I mean yeah it's technically possible, like I said, about as hard as killing KT with the whole raid blindfolded
---
The time turner messed everything up.
---
this sub is full of people telling me what to do, pls stfu and let me do what i want.
---
It absolutely does matter. If you have 15% chance to crit, then 15% of your attacks are already going to be crits. Adding more crit chance on top of that does not improve the damage of 15% of your attacks.
---
Sword spec can proc on that 15%. And then the sword spec hits can also crit.
---
Pretty much this, when you go in as a healer you can (and should) roll need on anything that you can need as a healer. The people who will cry about for loot in classic are the ones who won't be playing classic for long anyways...
---
Ret is better than oomkin, atleast a ret can nightfall
---
Cause he thinks he knows what he wants to do, but really he doesn’t, right? You saying it will bore him and ruin the experience is no different from Ion telling you that you don’t want to play classic.
---
I’m not saying you’re definitely wrong, as Ion was probably also right for many people. I just wanted you to know what you’re doing.
---
It’s the same shit in the current base game. Everyone always asks what the top dps specs or tanks are, but at the end of the day, the only thing raid leaders care about is if you can show up consistently.
---
It was CPU throttling, so it doesn't really matter but
---
8GB Memmory

I was a paladin, 13 years old, and with a computer that froze every 15 minutes, aka. utterly useless. 
---
One time the guild leader asked me to fix my computer, and as the immature child I was, I started cursing him in the middle of our MC run in our TeamSpeak raid channel.
---
Guild leader took me in another channel and reprimanded me a bit, but I wasn't kicked from the raid or the guild.
---
If I could get a raid spot back then, I'm 100% positive you can get one, even if you're a paladin with no weapons, role-playing as a monk.
---
You just answered your own question there.
---
Link to a video?
---
While a decent spec for solo, farming, and 5 man's, I can tell you that deep holy is leaps and bounds above deep ret holy. 21/0/30 misses so many good talents and crits that make paladin healing the best in the game.
---
You won't get a raid spot if you're a prot paladin tho.
---
You’re better off learning how to play the Auction House and using that second account to watch it like a hawk, snatching up any deals.
---
Would love to see the script too!
---
I hated grinding so around 55 I just started running dungeons over and over.  I did BRD dozens of time.  It actually benefited me in the long run because I knew these dungeons like the back of my hand and I was one lf the early level 60's on my server so the knowledge came was good to have when organizing runs later.
---
listen, you will easily get a spot as a boomkin, ret as long as you're not going for top 10 guilds or some shit. People over here seem to not understand that you can play mostly whatever you want if you do it good and not going for min/maxing
---
Ty but doesn’t seem to have it on mobile :(
---
Nothing because I don’t have to. I just submit the leave and they approve it.
---
Quests are all different, classes play very different, there is little danger.
---
No - play with people your level.
---
I don't like the memes either but your post reads a lot like a "you think you do but you don't" post. While also advertising your guide.
---
Wow, thats not good.  That FPS was going so low.
---
You should level in the undead areas because those quests give Undercity rep, which is important because you want to hit honored before level 40 for the 10% discount on your mount. That's why it's a bad idea in general to leave your starting area.
---
Why wouldn't it be in phase 1? Isn't MC and Ony in phase 1?
---
Not sure. I don't use the app. I've saved stuff on mobile using the desktop site before.
---
Either way, just jump on reddit next time you're on a computer and go back to this comment and you can save it.
---
Not really. Warlocks are largely a support class and ideally you’d bring 2-3. It’s not until BWL that they start doing decent damage, and even then, you’d rather it be any other class doing said damage, because warlocks have no way to drop threat. Stacking shadow damage isn’t a very viable strategy. Sure, it’ll work, but it’s not worth optimizing for.
---
No they do not.
---
Weapon Skill can REDUCE your chance to be crit. That is why uncritable requires 410 Defense, while Uncrushable only requires some avoidance and shield block. Otherwise you push things off the bottom of the attack table which looks like this:       
---
Miss
---
Dodge
---
Parry
---
*Glancing*
---
Block
---
Crit
---
*Crush*
---
Hit    
---
This is how you get to the Soft crit cap when attacking bosses, with a 40% glancing chance pushing off all your Hits, but crit Cap is unatainable in PvP.
---
&gt;Ret is better
---
LETS CONSECRATE THE INFIDELS!!!!
---
Yep!
---
Don't forget any potential server issues lmao

2. Enh shaman (again contribution dps)

3. Feral

4. Elemental

5. Ret

6. Boomkin

Oh I know exactly how you feel.

I played on US server from Europe and also got to Rank 11.

Even though I kinda had no life during those months and the grind was awful (plus the time difference -.-), I had fun.

We were an awesome group of 15 people who took turns (first come first serve) and we kinda ruled the WSG. Not many groups beat us :)

I played since 3rd day (US release), played through all expansions, but I don't think I'll play classic. 
---
Mixed feelings, tbh, but I tell myself it just won't be the same again, since this time I'd know the content.
---
I wish you luck!
---
Of course people will get raid spots. It’s 40 man raids lol
---
And impale makes your crits do MORE DAMAGE than extra swings. God, maybe at home ill type up the math for you. But really if you weren't so lazy you would see I am right.
---
You and me both. Luckily the game has enough people where you can be reasonably sure someone will do the work and let you copy off them.
---
i agree with everything you said, yet it is all irrelevant
---
In levelling dungeons you shouldn't roll on the cloth pieces (unless nobody else needs) because you're only wearing it for dungeons, it speeds up other people's levelling, and you're most likely going to find a comparable quality int item from a quest while levelling towards the next dungeon.
---
BRD+ you should definitely roll (if you're there as a healer), but at that level caster loot and healer loot are usually pretty easy to distinguish (if not, the item is usually bad any nobody should care).
---
Uhh how is he gonna know if a streamer is ruining his server if he doesn’t even know any of them?
---
This is my whole point. 99% of the community have no idea who sodapoppin is or asmongold. They play the game just fine.
---
two reasons, and I'm pretty sure it's the same for tons of alliance warriors:
---
1/not going human means you'll deal less dmg in pve, and you'll generate less rage
---
2/gnomes are awful visually, just not what a warrior should look like.
---
Escape artist is amazing, but I wouldn't trade that for awful look and doing 10% less dps in pve
---
Enjoy responsibly, as they say.
---
You probably want to get to around 30 before you start to grind for gold, frostadamus on youtube as a video series on where to grind gold.
---
Rolling shammy about to make soo many friends with mele dps lol.
---
Cool, glad to have a more experienced response! :)
---
Holy paladins &gt; Horde racials
---
Humans have good dps and threat racials. But gmones and dwarfs are better at pvp.
---
In all honesty moat of the high ranked warriors on my vamilla server were tauren
---
Oh yeah for sure
---
Seriously? Maybe the hordes of idiots following them around?
---
Shaman are more about utility in PvP. You throw a heal here, you do some damage there, you Purge, and you make sure that you have the proper totems down for every situation. 
---
The nature of that job means that you have to be fairly close to the action. Which makes you an easy target. And you have no escape tools. And your healing output is reduced to exactly zero when someone is attacking you.
---
I think you're better off playing a Priest or Paladin if you want to stay in the back and heal.
---
dont know i know only at level 45 and above its easy to making Gold.
---
The only thing you miss is the 5% crit, that’s not a huge difference until AQ40 gear. Nobody uses holy shock because it’s to mana costly and the only thing else you miss is lasting judgment and imp wisdom. You definitely have to make sure your pally team covers all blessings before you do that tho.
---
Thanks for feedback.
---
* I've gone back and forth on this. The idea with the raid is that you have to be present to participate in the raid so shouldn't be getting points if you aren't. I haven't come up with a use case where its necessary to add someone else though, if you have one let me know!
---
* I've thought about creating a web-api into the data, but that would be down the road.
---
* So the system already allows you to pass explicit GP costs if you don't want to use the built-in formula. Even that was only out of necessity as it's very easy to break the system if you don't have a consistent GP formula. It's kind of a case of protecting someone from themself.
---
Vanilla doesn't have gearscore does it? But seriously, I was playing the other day and someone that was lvl 21 said they were too low for WC. I went there with my 18 and we cleared it in no time. People are shooting themselves in the foot by falling for echo chamber opinions.
---
Works fine if you're really good at stopcasting
---
You do know these streamers streamed retail for YEARS with no problems? They had zero effect on the server. Asmongold has been on KT for over 10 years and yet you have no idea because of how little impact a streamer has on a server.
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.

Cheers man. Saved
---
Sword spec procs can crit and benefit from Impale.
---
People seem awfully optimistic about pugging MC shortly after release.  They shouldn't be.  Organized guilds will wipe on the first trash pack.
---
I will drag dead weight all the way to KT if they bring me mana pots
---
I'm not lying. The 27th is a `Global Release` date. The 27th pertains to 12am in Paris. Which is 9pm Eastern/3pm Pacific on the 26th for NA.

---
This is why it's important to read articles and not just the headline. ;)
---
Exactly!
---
I believe you could finish mobs off after your lower level friend tags them, but it would be more fun just to level a different toon that's at their level.
---
Or you can let your friends group you hang out with them, let them tag the mobs and then you help kill them they’ll get all the experience.  I think that works.
---
Warlocks the “main damage dealers?” Never. Warlocks are largely a support class brought for curses. You need 2 of them, maybe a third. It’s not until later tiers that they start doing decent damage. However, even by that point, any other pure dps class would be better, because warlocks have no way to drop threat.
---
Your graphics card does support vulkan so the game should be able to load, maybe it will be playing at the lowest settings.
---
You can how it run during the stress test if you have an active account.
---
It amazes me how badly they screwed all of these aspects up. Cant belive classic wow by blizzard will be a reality soon.
---
Someone obviously didn't watch them stream the beta tests for Classic.
---
The most important racial is the Tauren hitbox.  It let's them get healed around corners that would interrupt line of sight for other tanks.
---
Can we stop saying certain specs aren't "viable" in pve? I'm pretty sure there is more to pve than hardcore raiding. I love bringing moonkins to 5 mans, questing or even UBRS. And let's face it, this is what most people will be doing.
---
Roll Ret, Moonkin, Enhancement, Elemental, Prot pally if your heart so desires, these bring a new level of play to lower levels of the game and endless fun!
---
If you ever find this please pass it along to me :)
---
This is amazing.
---
Hey. Are you ok? This really seems to be getting you bent out of shape. Is everything ok in your world? Do you need someone to talk to?
---
Okay so you say you have less time to play no a days but say you are fine with a 3 to 4 hour MC? That makes no sense. Anyone who has played into AQ40 doesn't want 4 hour MC raids. Ideally, you want your guild to clear MC and BWL in 4 hours, including world buff and travel time, so you have more time to focus on progression.
---
These speed clears are super beneficial for the casual player. My guild is going to raid Monday / Tuesday bi weekly until AQ40 drops. Clear MC and BWL in one night before reset, come back and clear them again on day 1 of the new reset. This leaves a week with no content available since two weeks worth of content is cleared in 2 nights of raiding. This is superb for the casual player as you are getting more done for less in game time.
---
Honestly farming consumes is a bit more time consuming, but keep in mind if you farm up 30 mongoose potions you won't burn all of them unless you are in guilds taking 4 hours to clear MC once. Slow clears double dip on ruining your time played as you will burn more consumes and spend more time banging your head against the wall.
---
This is why people don't want meme specs. 5-10 people too greedy to play a viable spec wasting the time of 30-35 others is what breaks guilds.
---
Thix has to be a female tauren gg
---
Yeah thats even worse... Gonna be a bad time either way though
---
Group up with 4 hunters ;)
---
I really wanted to play a shaman but the aesthetics and atmosphere of alliance leveling zones is too good to pass up. If only you could make one opposite faction character on a pvp server :(
---
lmfao honestly man. The one dude was writing like basicaly he was sorry he had a kid because he could not spend all his time playing classic, asking for advice on what to do about it. Most of the replies were pretty harsh on him as they should be... but FFS. Another guy joked about telling his wife and young kid to fuck off when classic comes out because he wont spend any time with them.... I mean I dont know how you joke about somethi0ng like that, where is the humour? Ha ha im such a fucking weirdo I'd rather play this game 24/7 when it comes out (again) than spend time with my young family? ItS juSt a jOkE!
---
The one thing that is bothering me the most is i hear u should level as enhancement and elemental doesn't become worth it until level 40?
---
I really enjoy queueing for random BGs while leveling and enhancement won't be fun for me in a BG.
---
Apparently ele has mana issues leveling but how bad are they? And why does it suddenly become a viable option at level 40, how can these mana issues just disappear?
---
Would i be severely gimping myself if i leveled as ele... Drinking after every pull would be boring and expensive.
---
Uhh are you trolling? 
---
Because to me, it seems like you’re comparing a single beta server, with over 40 streamers, to retail wow, with hundreds of servers spread across the entire thing. 
---
Is that what you are trying to do? Say that beta is the same as retail?
---
Like I literally just told you they have zero impact on retail. We have seen how they effect servers already and not just one single server with all of them on it.
---
Given your horde, initially there won't be a significant difference because you can hamstring spam to proc windfury. But by BWL onward, Fury will begin to significantly pull ahead due to how well flurry scales with better weapons.
---
I will, because of my timezone and work schedule. I finish work at 4pm HST, glhf me
---
This comment is so great, I'd cheat on that other comment from before, marry this one and raise a family of tiny little comments.
---
- Dr. Cox **slightly modified**
---
"Meme" specs in vanilla are just pvp specs.  There will be plenty of pvp guilds that will raid just to get better gear for pvp.  Join one of those and you'll fit right in as an elemental shaman or whatever.
---
Well... get naked and have a fistfight... What did you thought?
---
me too dum
---
Are you trolling? It's not like the streamers were all running around together at the same time in the same area.
---
Anyway, the person had a legit question, stop acting like they're an idiot for not wanting to be anywhere near these asshats and their fanboys.
---
same, i noticed it when they sent me some free hearthstone packs(which i also dont play, lol)  
---
the icon shows up on the b-net launcher when you do get one though. its located near the top to the right next to your name(ish)
---
!RemindMe 30 days

Lol yea imagine wanting to avoid someone so much that you go out of your way to learn about them
---
Good logic 😂😂😂
---
Gotta take player skill into account.
---
&gt; "Azshara, I think it's so cringe these days with the Goblins and the rocket train."
---
Indeed, Azshara was a quiet, mysterious zone, then the goblins came and fucked everything up. They're like a bunch of 5 year olds coming in and messing up your garden.
---
Cataclysm really messed up a lot of good zones and destroyed most of the lvl 60 endgame content with it.

Yes, you do

Ignoring deep wounds, ignoring the benefits of aoe spells + crit,
---
(x + 0.05) * 2.2 + (1 - x - 0.05) * 1  = x * 2.2 + (1-x) * 1 + 0.05 * (x * 2.2 + (1-x) * 1) 
---
The left side is damage with axe spec. The right side is damage with sword spec. X is your crit chance when sword spec starts being equal or better to axe spec. Solve for X.
---
But its hard to factor in deep wounds and cleave crits.
---
Ya I would agree with that. My point is that alliance have some pretty good PvP racials. It sucks being a horde rogue if there's a large population of dwarves on the enemy team :/
---
As of right now, what is the most reliable place to get recommendations on leveling a warrior? I keep hearing conflicting info.
---
&gt;This test will be available to all World of Warcraft players with a current subscription or active game time in all regions.

---
&gt;10% less dps in pve
---
Woooa 10%? Where are you getting that number. It's a bit less PvE dps but I would never sacrifice the utility of escape artist. Gnomes being small is also another of their advantages.
---
They added loot to the MC loot table in later patches. It’s assumed that the loot that came in later patches won’t be added until the appropriate phases, but we don’t know for sure until the actual game is playable.
---
In case you mean it won't get an assigned debuff slot by the raidleader you two are talking about different things.
---
On private servers deep wounds would keep pushing off other debuffs, essentially leading to a ban on the talent for fury warriors, in turn leading to lower fury dmg because you can't specc into 20%crit multiplier.
---
I read your answer as "you won't be allowed to use 1 out of 16 slots for your deep wounds", but I think his question was rather if it is intended behavior that it pushes off other debuffs.
---
You won't be able to raid or do anything where there's more than 20 players in combat.
---
Incorrect. Mob scaling came with Legion and the whole "pick any zone you want to quest in"
---
Sure kid.
---
I didn’t say *I* had less time, I said *most* will. As I said in that post I’m single with no kids so I have more free time that what I expect the average Classic player will have. I also said I wouldn’t be mad if it took that long, not that I hope it takes that long. 
---
The main point I was trying to stress is that there is simply not a time crunch this time around which plays to the benefit of the casual more so than it did before, which is why I think many that have left the game will be returning (half my friend circle is in that category).
---
Again, there is no such thing as “time wasted” if there is no ticking clock. If you don’t want to allow meme specs in your guild, cool. Do you. But since we have all the time in the world to get gear I’m not so serious about it that I won’t stop people from playing the class/spec that brings them the most enjoyment.
---
Take that racists!

The Fight Club discord: [Https://discord.gg/6cvQBZ](Https://discord.gg/6cvQBZ)

What specific topic are you hearing conflicting info on?
---
Actually a double damage mortal strike is alot better than a mortal strike + 1 swing. There are tons of factors you are failing to consider here man.
---
This needs about 1000 more upvotes, holy crap. This was funny, badass (That Tauren infront of Rag, yoo), made me be emotional...Man.
---
If that was an official ad, and I wasn't sold already on Classic, I'd now for sure buy it.
---
But you also have to remember that was 15 years ago and the knowledge and videos and guides that we have were no were near as plentiful as they are today.
---
If your in a guild even trying to somewhat get through content, when you hit a brick wall the first people there going to look at is the people who are pulling shit numbers or who have no clue what they are doing. Its a different time and with that comes different metas and expectations.
---
Or you could just join a guild who doesnt care about any of that and be absolutley fine. No right or wrong answer here there is going to be a place for any sort of playstyle and that is a good thing.
---
Just dont expect to breeze through all content when your im a guild who doesnt care to optimize.
---
I think it will be fine. Only a percent of a player base actually watches the esport. And that being said most people who will tune into wow classic will be current wow classic players. Definantly people coming in to learn tips from the pros but I hope they all dont just roll meta picks. What I would like to see is streamers do power leveling on some none meta characters :P

I see his mouth moving but all I hear is weird al's version
---
I'd advise to take the axe over the sword/mace even as a human, simply cause most of the followup upgrades are axes aswell and since youre probably lvling as arms axes net you 5% extra crit via talents, which atleast in my opinion for lvling is alot better than the 2 other specialisation taltens.
---
Shit, I had my keybinds set to from 1 all the way to 0 so I had to move my hand off WASD to use half of my abilities, and I don't think I even used modifiers like ctrl+X until BC, and I keyboard turned. Still had a raid spot, still got DKP.
---
Is this classic vs classic on retail graphics settings?
---
&gt; Vanilla
---
/run if not IsCurrentAction(59) then CastSpellByName("Stealth") end
---
lol no:
---
/cast !Stealth
---
"since your windfury swings can proc more windfury swings." I don't think this is true in classic.
---
I agree almost entirely except for Shadow Priests, Shadow Priest raiding really is a clique thing, if you are a random person it's very unlikely you will get to raid as Shadow Priest.
---
Fairly certain that this isn't japanese but chinese. But yes please, I'd love a translation, too!
---
Dwarf Rogue is a beast to be sure.
---
When was 1.4? Either way, I saw Baron drop his bindings on the first kill my guild ever did of him. I just can't remember specifically when that was.
---
Nah, it for sure worked after that.  I played a few years back and it worked then.  But [nostealth] should be still work just fine.
---
Man I love this community so much lol
---
Maybe. All I'm saying is that not all experiences line up with yours.
---
This guy gets it!
---
You spelled  “gatz” wrong.
---
Please do one for rogues
---
The Enrange really shouldnt be an issue to just heal through.
---
Tranq shots make it a lot easier but the damage is not high enough to really be a problem if healers are ready for it.
---
Found a video where the boss isnt getting tranqed for a while. You can see the tank is soaking a lot of damage, but it's something you should be able to heal through just fine.
---

Yeah it was so so good. Especially when Factions was fresh and ABs were constant and competitive. 
---
It's a bit easier to click in that game as theres only 8 skills, but yeah, definitely not the best way to play haha. I just remember this nutty ranger in my guild who was very good at rupting who clicked, it was insane.
---
hmmm. thanks! I'll test it out again come classic. It definitely worked a lot better.
---
Y’all got any more of that WarCrack? I’ll suck yo...
---
On any character: Need what you Need.
---
Just let them know what you'll be rolling for. 
---
Healers are casters. They roll on caster gear, with exceptions (hit, specific spell damage, etc.)
---
its a more incel friendly game.
---
Lmao how does every xpac outsell previous ones when they went from a peak of like 17 million players at one point to sub 10 and now don’t disclose them. Just because someone buys the xpac doesn’t mean they are still there playing it by a few months later.
---
Things that they fixed as bugs in Classic should not come back.

What is this some sort of time traveling?  Next you're going to tell me you're from the future 2019 and I'm in the past 2004.  As if WoW gets worse and worse post release and people would time travel back.  YEAH RIGHT.  You aren't fooling me this time Cartman.
---
I think BM hunters and full demonology locks were not good for dungeons/raids right through to wrath. Maybe BM hunters became viable at some point though.
---
Got it fixed. 
---
A helluva lot of swear words, coffee, sweat and satanic prayers later it works again raised from the dead.
---
I was just curious if you could actually tank as fury or arms in 5 man's. What I'd really like to see is stance dancing explained for classic with rotations. Single target vs multiple targets
---
Everyone I’ve met that still plays retail the last few years usually buys it cuz they feel obligated from old friends and guildies. Get bored within a month and sick of grinding that by the time the raids hit they stopped caring lol
---
Exactly this. You basically only need to avoid Asmon &amp; Soda if in US, the rest is simply too small. Not mentioning Esfand because he's on Asmons Server anyways.
---

i'll fite you irl
---
Any tips for hunter macros ?
---
When filtering for players that say Battlegrounds are their priority in Classic, 52% of survey respondents say they’re rolling Horde and 48% say they’re rolling Alliance, which is a smaller disparity than the margin of error.
---
In conclusion, your faction choice is unlikely to have any bearing on your BG queue times in Classic,
---
You're both correct. Avoidance will push crit off the table, but it will do it last, so you need a ton, for example, using an ability that gives +75% block.
---
It's all downhill from here might as well skip to Cataclysm.
---
But none of them are so big that they actually overtake the server. At max they will be like the big guilds you know from back then.
---
Ah, ok, thanks. Is it just me, or do all the updated faces look the same? Too bad. I always make an orc female bank alt and design her to be as "orc"y as possible
---
Alright this is getting ridiculous. You are talking as if someone is going to have 0% crit unless you take axe spec. That's not true. You can still crit with sword spec... and also get a sword spec proc on top of that hit... and that sword spec proc can also crit. That's why it's better.
---
Wait, you don't think dwarf war is best ally tank? Highest base stam and str, only usable racial is the best one for tanking. With blessing of kings dwarf war tank has the highest raiding HP of all war tanks, yes higher than tauren. In any given raid dwarf tank has highest HP. 
---
Buddy, you dont know this game after 15 years? You are going to have trouble getting a raid spot.
---
There were tonnes of paladins, rogues and hunters with TF, mostly because bindings were dropping for ages before we even knew what the end reward was.
---
this comment makes me feel like wow is a creepy cult.
---
I remember it being better for some reason
---
I raided on a human priest in vanilla through Nefarian.  There was a short time I wished I had rolled dwarf for fear ward, and there was definitely hot drama about racials on the WoW forums at that time, but honestly our tanks learned to stance dance after a while, and it wasn’t really an issue in practice, PVE-wise.  I feel like it was is showing up and paying attention that was way more important than anyone’s racials except maybe the very first time or two downing Onyxia.
---
Well there are add ons for original vanilla and I am sure there will be a bot at some point.
---
But excel spreadsheets are a great way to do it yourself
---
I don't think they confirmed anything but sinced it popped on my client even though I haven't had a subscription in years I figured that's the finished client that will be used for launch
---

I guess questing through Elwynn Forest for the first time in 10 years is the same experience to you as the second time in a couple weeks.

Full spec Resto Druids were SUPERIOR healers to Priests in mid to large raids.

Also continuously buffing raid groups with blessings.  What was the duration in vanilla, 10mins?
---
Hunters are on par to set applies for raising?  You cannot be serious.
---
I'm hesitating between human and gnome warrior right now.
---
I really dislike the way gnomes look for warriors, and I love weapon skill in pve. However, I'm scared of being drastically less effective in pvp due to the absence of escape artist.
---
What should I do in this case? Should I just pick the race that I think look the best, that I prefer (as I prefer humans by fa), or should I min-max in pvp and go gnome despite disliking how they look?
---
None of those Riposte or opener macros will work. In Retail/Classic, if an action fails, then the macro stops.
---
The easiest way to fix this is using a macro addon like GSE: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gse-gnome-sequencer-enhanced-advanced-macros
---
Retail lost so many subscribers that they stopped recording the fucking sub count. If you think the rise of one of gamings juggernauts and current wow are the same you’re a Neanderthal. I’ve played vanilla and I’ve played every expansion including this piece of fucking trash BFA. I’ve been a heroic raider since heroic raiding existed. Vanilla is 10X what current wow is and the sub numbers prove it, and the fact that the fan base for vanilla is so rabid shows that classic is still one of the greatest MMOs to exist. You’re and adult that doesn’t know the difference between your and you’re. Modern wow is so dumbed down my dog could hit the whole rotation of a warrior against 10 NPCs and live with 90% hp. Classic allowed for a high skill cap that modern wow can not encapsulate in nearly any aspect. Going from modern wow to classic is going from Elmo goes to grouch land to Darksouls 2.
---
Same I don't get the hate DKP gets.  Both my guilds cleared C'thun and both had no loot drama DKP systems.  Only slightly different from each other.
---
I'm going to prefer a DKP system because in my experience the officers and GL have a higher chance causing drama from nepotism or favoritism instead of performance based valuations.
---
Bis for hunters, too slow weapon for rogues. Perditions blade mainhand and corehound tooth/dragonfang blade offhand are bis until AQ.
---
I wonder if theres a crit cap now with the crit aura reductions, or at least one you can reach.
---
Righy but that was 2004-2006. On average the player today will be much better. That same player from back then wouldnt get so much leeway today. But also, would a player like that still exist with how much information is now out there.
---
Thank you and mad props for making this!
---
&gt;I know it’ll be cross realm  
---
How do you know that? I've seen no news either way regarding x-realm/battlegroups/etc
---
Not really sure what the point in racing 15 year old content is.  I can log onto retail right now and speed clear MC, one shotting every boss.  Nothing that any guild will do on classic is a world first.
---

Idk man, I think your experience is skewed from being on a private server where people probably don't care about meta as much and have to deal with smaller player pools anyway. As soon as that shit opens back up to the masses again it's gonna just be a bunch of dipshits that Reeee about meta comps.
---
you can't put shaman tank in the same bag as prot pally, and you can't put prot pally in the same bag as bear druid. Prot pally are perfectly viable 5 and 20 mans tanks. Druid are totally viable 40 man tanks for most bosses as well.
---
Just further shows how people like you are short minded. Just play with your elitists friends, you'll be fine. But you have nothing to contribute to such a thread, seriously.
---
A strong point against the class mounts, at least from a lock perspective, is that the mount is not only off the GCD but is also unaffected by silence effects as well as allowing mana regen to be uninterrupted. The QoL of a regular epic mount is worth more than a special class mount imo
---
&gt;aning cause it's like "You should be in 
---
Just make an orc warlock and name him Forc
---
Yes, but there is much less chance of double swing and crit vs just a crit. 5 of your crit chance is how often you double swing and crit on the swing.  The correct comparison is 1 double swing no crit vs MS critting because 5% is 5%.
---
This is very important.
---
PvP wise I really don't think there is a superior Priest Race combo to Dwarf Priest. Fear Ward is superior to WotF in that you can have multiple fear wards and it's CD is far, far, shorter than WotF. Not to mention Fear Ward can be shared with vital allies such as healers or flag carriers.
---
Stoneform is also the most busted thing for a Priest to have at their disposal. The ability to instant remove Viper Sting and all possible Rogue poisons is absolutely one of the greatest things a Priest could possibly wish for. Not to mention the ability to remove Devouring Plague without actually having to leave Shadowform to remove disease. Not to mention the armour buff, on top of your inner fire, grants you even more longevity in hard fights against Hunters/Rogues/Warriors.
---
As for Desperate Prayer, Shadow Priests are often forced to drop Shadow Form and self-heal and Desperate Prayer is ideal for a desperate situation, offering an insane amount of healing at the last minute. An un-interruptable instant heal for that much can easily turn a fight in your favour and even without shadow form you should have more than enough damage to finish off an opponent you've already plowed a load of damage into.
---
Dwarf Priests are insanely good and I honestly think dismissing them as inferior is pretty laughable.
---
It wont be, because alliance doesnt like to pvp
---
No. It's never better unless your gear is absolutely terrible.
---
Forsen? He probably has the most disruptive of viewers
---
Couldn’t agree more, but there are guilds out there legit trying to down Rag before 9/3
---
I love boomies
---
Replying so I can find this post later on a different computer. Thanks for a nice resource.
---
I probably should have specified old content dungeons, if that is where the doubt is coming from. I am not trying to claim you can solo current content dungeons.
---
Soon Omar will Take Us Home!
---
Yep, exactly.
---
Either spec works fine - Arms is superior though. Make sure to bind marks to F1 - F10. Makes tanking a lot easier when I just mark a main target skull/X. I'm approaching this from 5 man tanking:   
---
For tanking what stance dancing means is swapping between stances to use abilities gated off from protection.   
---
1.) Multi-target AoE pull   
---
Enter defensive stance -&gt; Shoot mob with ranged wep and break line of sight around a corner  -&gt; Pop bloodrage -&gt; Use battleshout in range of all team members -&gt; (situational) switch into berserker stance before the mobs reach you pop berserker rage -&gt; switch back into defensive -&gt; use demo shout -&gt; Begin cleave or sunder tab-target spamming as needed. (If non elite - Cleave is used when mobs die fast , if elite -  sunder/revenge tab target is used when the mobs will die slower and you need to keep long term threat - ie sunken temple 4-5 mob pulls)   
---
(situational) - I typically use bloodrage and berserker rage on opposite pulls to keep snap threat early on.   
---
2.)  Single Target tanking 
---
Enter defensive stance -&gt; shoot the mob -&gt; press bloodrage -&gt; berserker stance -&gt; berserker rage\*\*\* -&gt; defensive -&gt; demo shout -&gt; Priority rotation: Revenge &gt; Sunder armor &gt; heroic strike (if excess rage).   
---
Ideally have battle shout refreshed before pulling the single target mob/boss to maximize threat per rage  
---
\*\*\*DO NOT use this if the boss fears, switch to berserker and pop this in anticipation of a fear
---
Other tips:   
---
a.)When you have &gt;5 mobs demo shout is superior in agro generation when you have &lt;5 battle shout is superior
---
b.) In the rotation, if you have a dope healer you can take a few hits in berserker stance and use whirlwind to snap agro and increase group damage. 
---
c.) If someone pulls &gt;7 mobs on accident, you'll want to use retaliation -&gt; challenging shout -&gt; and switch back to defensive. This will  will give you solid agro on all the mobs. Using tab -&gt; cleave  would be the best bet while throwing up a focus target. 
---
d.) Heroic strike is trash - it costs more than 15 rage because you lose out on the swing that would generate rage. It's only used as a rage dump which should generally only be used when raid tanking/rage capped. 
---
e.) Shield block can be used to mitigate incoming damage/proc revenge on demand. 
---
f.) when in an oh-shit-healer-has-no-mana, switch to battle stance and get hamstring on as many mobs as you can and run away while the healer regens mana. 
---
g.) shield bash can be used to interrupt spells - best used on a heal on a caster mob.

I hit rank 10 in high school while playing sports after school. Mostly just AFK’d in BGs while doing homework on a medium sized server. It was tough for the amount of time I had but doable.

Amen.

*ANISE NUTS*!
---
Prove it man. Why do you theorycraft but wont do math?
---
If you mean top 1% and someone else doesn't.. then that's the problem.
---
For me a serious raiding guild would be a guild that almost clears every mythic content in retail. In Classic, even though I haven't experienced it yet, it would probably be clearing AQ40/Naxx.
---
Maybe you don't care about those, but this isn't applebear07's Sub, but classicwow and everyone can talk about whatever he wants. I think it's exeggerated to say every discussion is about those guilds aswell. There are barely any top tier discussions, it's mostly casual or overall discussions, where everything is included.
---
Most comments that I read are like "if you're casual this is fine, if you want semi-hardcore this and that needs to be taken care of and for the hardcore/top tier/worldfirst this kind of stuff is important". Which is completely fine and just includes all possible facets of the post/question.
---
Very nice. Melancholy and funny.
---
Right, even if you don't hit exalted by 40, you've saved yourself a ton of gold by getting as close to possible as you can before having to start cloth turn ins.  That's my plan at least.
---
Not to be nitpicky but... Moonwalking was never fixed in classic (in fact I'm pretty sure it was only fixed late TBC or even wotlk, I remember doing it in TBC). You can go on a pserver with a 1.12.1 client and see it's still there if you want proof.
---
Shaman?  That I'd pay to see.
---
This is so ridiculous that some people need such a thread to take decisions like this. I hate elitist assholes so much right now. It's unbelievable.
---
I hope this is/becomes a thing. 40 paladins or 40 druids clearing raids.
---
Tank 1 use shield wall, when it's down tank 2 taunt it and use shield wall as soon as it's needed, then tank 3 etc....
---
Haha alright, I didn't think such a bug would've taken this long to fix. But at the same time it's probably not worth the effort. :D
---
IIRC, this is just in the settings somewhere; either Audio or Interface.
---
I can actually look at myself in the mirror again thanks to this
---
Rogues can absolutely push the crit cap below achievable levels when they pop evasion. 
---
Warriors too, but lol.
---
Wow me 3
---
But that whirlwind tho
---
My point is that you won't be CRIT capped in PvP making that aspect of his Cons for Axe Spec moot.
---
Where as a CON for sword spec is that the extra attacks CAN be dodged, blocked, parried, or miss.
---
I can give a perspective from what it's like as a gnome warrior. Any sword/mace that drops you better hope every other human has it first or else you'll be passed up for it because they'll get better use out of it from weapon skill. It got annoying having any human instantly call for that with loot priority. But I get it. With DPS you won't be topping someone equally skilled as you on meters. Human will always come out ahead. 
---
Now for PvP. There were tons of times I won a fight against a hunter, druid, mage, shaman I'd have lost as any other race, thanks to escape artist. Escape artist is on such a low cool down and if you can predict frost nova/roots/snare you can precast it to break it instantly. 
---
Ultimately it boils down to wanting to top meters or PvP. If you plan to wpvp gnome instantly becomes better. Premades it's a bit less important with pally/dispells. But there will always be times when you might not have one where escape artist can save you still.
---
The main tank naxx
---
Played Alliance Rogue in Classic...
---
I will absolutely, 100%, agree with this person. I will take a thousand resisted Kidney Shots over a single, horrible, tilting, Stoneform outta Blind.
---
I spent reagents on that Blind, man....
---
Hmm, better sprinkle some salt around my pc then.  That helps against zombies right?  XD 
---
Glad to hear yer up and running again!
---
I swear people are just finding old posts from the forums...
---
The overwhelming majority of the time you'll have 2 tanks active, and most of the time you'll have 3. Occasionally you'll have more.  
---
For example, MC off the top of my head:
---
Multiple tanks:  
---
Giants/destroyers: 2  
---
Annihilators: 2+  
---
Fire packs: 2  
---
Luci: 2-3  
---
Corehound packs: 3-5  
---
Gehennas: 2-3  
---
Double firelords: 2  
---
Shazz: 1-4  
---
Sulfuron: 3-5  
---
Golemagg: 2-4  
---
Garr: 2+  
---
Majordomo: 2+  
---
Rag: 2  
---
It's also nice to have someone ready to pick up patrols near the start.
---
Single tanks:  
---
Imps  
---
Surgers  
---
Single firelords  
---
Corehounds  
---
Mag  
---
Geddon  
---
Probably forgetting some stuff, and it can *almost* all be done by one person when your gear is better than what you can get in there, but the trend of needing at least 2 tanks active for the vast majority of a raid continues in later raids too.

---
Yea, Shamans and Paladins can ONLY heal my dungeons and they cant roll on cloth needed to heal them. Whats hard to understand about that? Just like when I hire entry level people, they need 7 years of experience. Same concept.
---
Nah it was common back then. And it probably still will be there at least a bit. The world of casuals is not the same as yours.
---
Hits and Crits as two types of attack so for every % crit you get you have 1% percent normal hit (as its not a Crit + Hit).  
---
Unlike spells which crits are (in the case of 20% to crit) would be hit chance * Crit chance = actual crit rate.
---
So with 90% to spell hit and 20% crit chance you actually get 18% crits (not counting the + level crit nerfs). You roll two dice, one for hit then another if hit for crit. 
---
With melee 90% hit, with 20% mob avoidance, and 20% crit would actually give 20% crit (not counting the + level crit nerfs). As the avoidance and crit replace hit rolls. You only roll a single dice with 70% chance to roll a hit, 20% chance to roll an avoidance, and 20% to roll a crit.
---
i mean, that’s argued by the op. spots aren’t going to be competitive for most guilds, so the answer to the question “why bring x over y” is just “why not both?”
---
all i’m saying is that boomkins should be considered on the same tier of dps as hunters, at the very least. feral too. if druid dps specs are meme specs, then hunter would be a meme class.
---
i can’t convince you to bring a boomkin over a mage (no one can, even the aura doesn’t outweigh the dps difference and a team should never need the druid’s backup tools), but if you are in a spot where that’s a serious question, then you are in quite an enviable position, as far as raid leading is concerned.
---
It's about WoW Streamers, isn't he variety?
---
Heaven forbid somebody make a posting with sure-to-be-popular that won't be monetized.
---
&gt;Definitely superior to Shamans in utility.
---
Oh hands down. Alliance premades have a massive advantage if the pallys are sacrificing, cleansing and freedoming properly. They are an invaluable addition to a team
---
That’s the way to do it.
---
As a tank?
---
I've been playing on private servers from nst to ndale, much of that time on a caster. If you were talking about mage I'd slightly entertain your thought process, however for warlock you are completely wrong. You don't drop bvine on warlock until you have every other good piece of spell hit in the game including some AQ items.
---
You will be using bloodvine for a good 6months+ and that's assuming you are lucky with drops. If you dont think having 2% more crit for that amount of time is worth it then enjoy not being taken seriously. Even mages that don't need spell hit as badly will be using bvine for a while.
---
You seem like you have never been in the loop period.
---
Bubbleoseven...thats pretty smooth
---
Would love to see what you've got for Rogues!
---
Shaman does not counter mage, my friend,
---
How did you all know the character name I was gonna reserve?? WTF!?!
---
Most meme specs are hybrid classes, that require either a different gear set entirely or learning how to heal. You can't tell someone who is under performing that they need to get better playing something they didnt want to play in the first place and that they need to learn how to do something new when the content is getting harder. You can bring a boomkin, hunter, shaman dps from the start but they need to know that they are going to be a utility player and they need to know their shit. Each of those classes has jobs that can be beneficial to the raid but if they are seeking personal glory they will not get far.
---
Unpopular opinion: Flying its not bad, but blizzard trying to balance the game for both the people who wants it and people who don't want it its what it ruins it.
---
I hope that with classic wow release, retail finally accepts the Y axis in the world and create the world with flying in mind and not just a way to get from A to B quickly
---
Wth is intestinal fortitude
---
Yeah I was also wondering about this race talk as well
---
Theres been a fair amount of talk about specs that only get 0-1 spots in raids having a harder time finding a guild, but I cant remember people saying race will make it harder. Tbh Im surprised that so many thinks its a trend on this sub
---
Ahh yes, i do miss the good ol' times of doing arenas back in vanilla
---
That's an instant quit for sure.
---
You just have dps use cooldowns and nuke the boss.
---
Better get that new Ryzen before character creation.  Your Intel chipset can't handle character creation.
---
Hahaha. It's also removes all the stacks of crimping while taking you out of blind and makes you immune for 8 seconds. If you use it properly its very good. 
---
Once I used stoneform when I guy blinded me in my Blessing of Protection (normally a very good counter to a shitty human Paladin) and the guy used prep, waited but timed the second blind poorly. Burnt both his blinds on the same stoneform. Felt bad for the guy.
---
There was a Dev interview right before beta where they said it would be cross realm. That was the last official word on it so the assumption is that's still the case.
---
My love and passion for Tanking came from classic wow
---
Its only theoretical if we dont convert all the subpar players into desirable classes and specs first on a forum. If we scare them to play the good stuff from the start we dont have to deal with it later.
---
So does reddit but you're still on here
---
Booooo
---
Holy pally is the only way to raid. Ever.
---
40 holy pallies.
---
Shamans are the second best caster in terms of dammage. They DO HEAL but ONLY IF there is no important target to nuke, like an overextended war, or a healer or something. Or if your FC is going to die you want to pop a NS heal on them.
---
The spec is meant to be flexiable and it is why they are regarded one of the best casters for horde side behind an overheated warlock that one shots everything with conflag and instant cast NF procs
---
It's not always, great, but when you build a good friends list of solid party members to call on and work with a few times it can be really fun.
---
Did you also find math class ridiculous?
---
Classes were overhauled multiple times during vanilla making them vastly different. Why do you still count all of those changes as vanilla?
---
DKP is better with shitty officers for sure, but having shitty officers causes issues outside loot distribution as well.
---
Ya I know, I was being sarcastic.  I was making fun of op.  I was pulling my hair out because we get to see a bunch of these posts everyday that do nothing except show that op is too lazy to spend two min looking through the sub.
---
yeah, maybe it was a little different. i'd take that too!
---
Sure, but you guys also appear to be disagreeing over something that you're both correct on. 
---
I'd add that player avoidance tends to be lower than warrior crit in PvP, so the con of sword spec procs being avoided is not as significant as the upside of having them crit.
---
I'm gunning for the Deathcharger, myself.
---
I've always had mixed feelings.  On the one hand, all the haters are right.  Immersion and the threat of things in the world is just gone.  Both pve and pvp threats.
---
On the other hand, flying is awesome and getting a bird's eye view of the world is so cool.
---
I have an old Surface Pro 3 that should be weaker than your machine and that runs classic fine for as much as I've done on it so far.
---
Its never stated in the article that it isn't viable, but certain specifications are definitely suboptimal.
---
This is awesome, but something to keep in mind with macro’ing warriors really thoroughly is you add to your total keybinds. Some of them are definitely worth it, but if you start having to keybind things in uncomfortable places, try to cut down.
---
The extra attacks are white hits, so they won't get the benefit of Impale.
---
The white hits will generate rage, but can miss or be avoided. 
---
In general Swords have a flat % bonus to DPS, while Axes has a diminishing return based on your crit.
---
I.e. the more crit you get, the lower a % increase to DPS it will be
---
I may have missed a post but I don’t think anyone would say dwarf is anything but bis priest race. That’s why they are short and fat though otherwise every priest would be a dwarf.
---
Shadow priest is going to stomp, i'm so excited to level &amp; wpvp with mine once Classic comes out
---
Best way to avoid that is if you use dkp to get an item you use all of it, stops people hoarding it as well
---
It's an entire genre called [Incremental Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game) or Idle Clickers. Most hate the gameplay style. But I find those who dig it, play it obsessively.
---
it’s just a general warning? not a specific direction to you. but obviously hit a nerve.
---
You know what time it is?
---
Adventurine Time!
---
Even Prot Paladin brings a lot to the table in PvP. Especially World PvP. Just try and kill a geared Prot Paladin. Just try. You may be able to, but in the end you're just wasting both our time.

Memory lane is why we're all here. Bring it on!
---
Do people call it WLK? I have only ever heard it called WotLK before.
---
You realize that you need that spell hit chance over 3% for raid bosses right? Other than that there's other gear, and you get 2% crit chance vs raid bosses, congrats, totally worth the money and not getting a different profession that you actually want to do.
---
Zug zug
---
I do think that, in a first scenario, that is what will happen, but I think that, as the game get more to the endgame scenario, the meta will grasp a lot of players. Only my guess.
---
I've always taken the mantra "show up on time and know your class" 9 times out of 10 a raid leader would rather take the guy that does ok damage over the premadonna who might do more damage but never shows up on time and acts like an asshole.
---
I'm not really sure how the deep wounds debuff stuff works. It's entirely possible those debuffs just constantly overwrite each other making it completely pointless. The reason fury really wants it is probably for the +20% crit damage that comes right after it. But Idk because I've not played on private servers in over a decade.
---
Any recommendation for a leveling build where I want to do damage but be my groups tank while leveling? Should I avoid prot gree altogether?
---
It’s about the booty.
---
One major thing im looking forward to is logging in after getting that first burn out, maybe youve been gone for like a month or two, and there aren't a ton of nerfs/ rebalances you have to sort out! Everything is the way it is, and it will be that way for the rest of the game. The game is the game, and that is glorious.
---
Yup! You make friends!
---
I'd like to know this for mage+int since I have no way of seeing my spell crit chance...
---
With that attitude you are going to have trouble finding a raid group.
---
let's be real.  It's pretty shitty.
---
From my experience it wasn't that way. But maybe my guild wasn't the best with handing out loot. It makes sense to hand out axes that way but I'm sure people will argue that it's still equal value for human and gnomes since the axe can be used as an offhand still because getting two weapons amongst all the rogues/warriors won't be that easy. 
---
I'll be rolling orc warrior this time around so luckily I won't have that issue, but I'm also worrying about how easy I had it leveling with wpvp as a gnome with escape artist.
---
Preach brother!
---
Preach!
---
Hello friend same here
---
I imagine that a good number of Redditors that frequent this sub a lot (and thus see links to polls like these) are going to play it. But it will probably not be representative of the whole population. Guess we'll see soon.
---
&gt; I really enjoy queueing for random BGs while leveling
---
BGs won't be in until phases 3 and 4.
---
I logged into my rogue not that long ago and I still had the merciless gladiator maces on, and I hit 80 in wrath lol. 
---
But yea blade flurry + hemo was ridiculous. I could solo a 3v3 group (and had to on many occasions cuz the people I was playing with weren't all that good, but RL friends, what can ya do). 
---
One of the specs I had a lot of fun playing around with tho was shadowstep. I remember in AB I had the beserking buff, used premeditation on a preist, chep shot them and got an extra combo point because of the initiative talent, used shadowstep and bam, 5.6k eviscerate.
---
Have you tried getting a spot as a ret pala? I think not.

For ally you have to run through the little bunker/tower and that’s a major chokepoint in AV it’s nearly the same

what in the world is the difference between how long you invest and how much you invest supposed to be
---
Just try to avoid spending money. Once you get to 36-40, I'd skip questing for a bit and grind Jaguars in Swamp of Sorrows or Badlands if you are short.
---
Real time based on the server's time zone.
---
Yes
---
thanks captain obvious, gotta farm the karma somehow, huh?
---
Still lost as to why The Forsaken are Horde.
---
They're made from Lordaeron Humans and High Elves (both allies to Stormwind Humans).
---
Did someone tell the Ranger General about what Garithos and his ilk put their prince through or something?  Even then, wouldn't that be isolated and forgivable compared to what the Horde was doing back in the WarCraft 2 days?
---
I know I've got the exact same plan as you. Let's make a blood pact to not roll on the same server and faction, k?
---
Holdin your poops to win that BG bro
---
I think mages are better at leveling than you let on, and I don't see AOE farming typically as a good leveling strategy. The best thing mages have for leveling are teleport and evoke; mages have less than 1/2 the downtime of any other Mana based class other than locks because of how much evoke rocks. Teleport just isn't about getting around (which is great) but running further and longer than other classes.
---
Frost mages have A+ cc, but fire/arcane really doesnt. Yes, polymorph is the best single cc spell, but everything else is off the frost tree and fire has too many dots for ccvto be super helpful.
---
Their raid rotation is pretty boring, but frost pve rotation has a ton of variety. There are a ton of cooldowns to juggle and mages can solo 95% of what a hunter can. There are few places that a mage can't go it alone.
---
OP lolisbae literally asked about that.  At least.. that's how I read it.
---
From what I have read and remember from my time playing a druid exclusively, priest were king when it came to healing. Druids were valued but generally only one to a group for mark and supplemental healing.
---
I remember very clearly they were never the best healers in the game and bear and cat form were useless abilities.
---
You won't have trouble finding a raid spot as a troll priest against undead ones and main tanks can be orcs ofc.
---
But nobody invites a survival hunter or an enhancement shaman to a raid. So i support people warning the new folk of the meme specs.
---
yes, salt and virgin scented candles will do the trick. The only risk is that it may attract some horned up catholic priests.

Yeah it most likely was a mix of shitty council and shitty members who would complain or use being human as their priority for pve items. 
---
Yeah rogues didn't get axes until wotlk. Sometimes weapons are so scarce that if axes are all that drop everyone will want them even if swords will be better and they'll upgrade them. 
---
100%. If I was going alliance I'd go gnome again. As a warrior you're still up on meters anyway and if you care about pvp, having an extra escape out of warriors biggest counter is pretty huge.
---
I think you mean BC...
---
We are stealing /r/2007scape memes now.
---
We really are low on content
---
TyrannosaurusHex
---
Though pretty sure only Rogues have the built-in Talent that makes them harder to detect right? Not the best talent pick however, as far as I know
---
Is nice looting mana potions and trading them to the healer!
---
PSA
---
Right but what are the orbs for and are they guaranteed drops from sthratholme? I think theyre used for naxx attunement and paladin mount quest.
---
Looks great. Do you plan on doing more? Maybe the horde or alliance insignia?
---
It is of critical importance that you maintain at least one 1h weapon skill while leveling if you want to tank dungeons. You just throw a quest reward or instance drop on while questing. honestly, if you get a very good instance quest reward, it can actually be just better to run around with a cruel barb and shield than say, the miner's revenge (consolation prize 2 hander from deadmines.
---
But to be clear, not only can you not tank an instance without weapon skill, if you pick up, say an axe in the instance, and you only have swords leveled? you finish the instance with your sword and only break out the axe while soloing. 
---
You CANNOT tank without weapon skill.
---
Hmm. I too am a huge fan of realistic resistances and immunities! However I'm not sure if it's directly related to world coherency. For example, if Ragnaros the Firelord has 0 fire resistance and takes full damage from a fireball, it would be "unrealistic" and totally weaksauce, but so long as he has 0 fire resistance for everybody that fights him, it would still be a coherent element. 
---
Thank you for sharing.
---
they said they were able to get it to run on 2006/2007 hardware so i think you should be fine on lowest settings
---
This is great- what about the ability to add an overflow/wait list AFTER the raid hits 20 or 40?
---
Don't judge him for scientific curiosity
---
Shoot, I think you are right.
---
Shadowstep has been added with patch 2.0.3.
---
Bummer.
---
It's possible just slower. You don't have your higher spell ranks, int or spell dmg gear and go out of mana quickly.  If you have a mage supplying you water you'll save a ton of money you would otherwise have to spend on food and drink setting you back for your 40 mount.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
not supported atm. Check here for classic enabled addons:  [https://willitclassic.com/](https://willitclassic.com/)
---
The game doesn't hold your hand.
---
But it does more than enough to guide you through the leveling process. You start out with just a couple abilities and will learn how to use them before getting new ones.
---
By the time you get new abilities, you should be pretty well aware of how your old abilities work so you can learn your new ones.
---
Finding others to play with will not be a problem. There will be plenty of newbies and plenty of regular people who still need your help in a group quest or dungeon.
---
My recommendation:
---
Look over the classes/races and decide on one or two you *really* want to try out. On launch day, create a character or two and play them both to level 10ish.
---
Whichever you end up liking more I'd commit to playing that one *more* than the other one.
---
Level to around level 20 and then start looking for a guild to join.
---
Guilds are a huge part of the game. A good guild will mean you've got friends who you don't even really know but are willing to help you out cause they are part of your community. You can ask for advice in guild chat, and guilds are an easy way to make friends.
---
If you get to level 30 and feel yourself starting to hate your class, you *can* reroll another class or race combination. But the game starts to slow down significantly around level 30 for most classes.
---
This isn't because your class sucks, but because progression is getting harder and you probably need to find more efficient ways to spend your time.
---
The game is *NOT* all about getting to level 60 and doing raids and shit. A lot of the experience is just getting from level 1-60 and seeing all the stuff along the way.
---
By the time you reach level 60 you will know your character intimately. You'll know the animations, the spells, the time it takes to cast an ability or how capable your class is in a given fight.
---
The experience is definitely centered around being social online.
---
MMO means Massively Mulitplayer Online.
---
It's designed around you making friends *in game* and does not require IRL friends to play.
---
But keep one thing in mind: Socializing is important and if you are a nice guy whose a good player you'll get a good reputation.
---
But if you're a raging douche who gets into spats with people and drama and shit other people will blacklist you and you'll have a hard time getting into groups/guilds.
---
I am looking for Warrior macros. Specifically equipping sword + shield when I switch to defense stance. 
---
Any other useful macros would be helpful too.
---
Most people saying that every raid is piss easy, 15 year old game, la la la.
---
Hand of Justice and Ironfoe will be contested like crazy all the time. Ironfoe, depending on procrate, is BiS for prot warrior threat, fury warriors for a long time as well, rogues with maces really like that thing, too...
---
These 2 alone will be highly contested, that's for sure! Will do many Thaurissan BRD runs over and over cause of it.
---
I'm a vet and I'm going to get steamrolled by the vets.  
---
I have never been so taken by a game in my life. The only other one that comes close for me is Grand Theft Auto or Diablo 2.
---
Not at all. If you’re interested give it a shot. The game is really for everyone. There are so many different things to do and ways to play. You don’t have to be a hardcore player to enjoy the game. Most people will help you out if you’re a new player
---
Yeah if ur rolling on a pvp I'd advise going arms for leveling cuz ur gonna get in pvp fights probably, and if u rolling on pve server I'd go fury. Don't spec into arms for leveling, all u need is a one hander and shield for tanking, that's it.
---
Too many Warlocks, only need 2-3
---
Too few Warriors, should be +12
---
I will fight for a place in a raid! Onwards, fellow boomkins!
---
Wrath Lich King — why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?
---
Hahahah, I have NFI. He hasn’t even commented on actually playing it, was apparently installing it to check how his new PC runs.
---
Best mobs to farm are the basilisk on desolace or STV aroun levels 32-38, at level 20ish is not worth to farm.
---
Honestly, if you have time to sink into it, then I find the original vanilla experience to be exceedingly rewarding.
---
Leveling is a journey, from speck of dirt to something resembling a hero. It's a rewarding process and the world is quite vibrant when it's populated.
---
The game will be rock solid, even if you play it at your own pace, so I would go for it dude!
---
Not from Phase 1 or 2 though, so not entirely relevant to OP's question.
---
Play on a pve server and you’ll be fine.
---
That's why the best dkp system is to have a set value for each item, but the person with most dkp gets the item
---
An Ultima Online reference in the wild!
---
God these people willing to lie just to encourage the community to be absolute dog shit so they do not feel bad being gimp themselves. 
---
Being able to clear a dungeon while in a shit spec does not make it OK, the high amounts of additional downtime and overall reduced efficiency of everything you are doing makes you a lazy bad player.
---
if you are much higher lvl you can rush them through the instance a couple of times to just get the gear, quests whatever. xp will be heavy penalized.
---
Hi! I love the bot. I played around with it on a test server for awhile, and it deleted my messages after I wrote commands. When showing it to my friends on the real server, though, it wouldn't delete my messages and reacting to an event didn't sign me up.
---
WOW does have some level of skill required.
---
But it's a much more technical game like an RPG.
---
Games like Overwatch/Pubg/CSGO/Fortnite and all those games have people who have deeply intuitive hand eye coordination after years of playing first person shooters.
---
WOW is much more technical and your build and ability usage is far more important than how fast you are at aiming and shooting.
---
You wont get steamrolled, and if you follow a few online guides about what kind of talents to build and what rotations to use (and what those two things are) you'll find yourself doing pretty well next to the vets.
---
If you have 100% equal talents and gear to a veteran, you will find that the skill gap between you two is probably not a huge burden on your personal ability to complete content or enjoy the game.
---
I'd definitely give it a go. WOW is very friendly to new players.
---
8 is also very true. As OP said, you think before making a choice
---
Everything is a learning curve, you got Google, YouTube, reddit etc that will keep you informed, yeh your first 20 bgs you might get rolled but like everything you get better.
---
Perfect re-creation of the WoW logo in 640x480 res.  It doesn't get more Vanilla than that.  Take my pixelated upvote.
---
Oh wow I think you're right. Vanilla demo seems boring now. Sure it has its uses though.
---
So you don't understand the difference between depending upon and keeping your options open?
---
A good Rogue can completely change the tide in a WSG premade, make great defenders in AB, and can backdoor objectives in AV.
---
There isn't really any class that can't find success as a solo player, as a BG player, as a world PVPer, or that has trouble with itemization. Some classes might be better suited to one aspect over another, but the difference isn't so major as to completely nullify the other class.
---
I have that same one on my wall I bought it from amazon
---
Why are warriors so god damn whiny?
---
All class groups can agree to do this. DKP doesn't reward based on efficient distribution of items but rather rewards loyal players who show up.
---
Yes, like everything in life it's All or Nothing. I thought you have so much fun you gain an extra life or you have a stroke on the spot from getting wrecked.
---
Im hoping to stay in control this time and I think it will be a hell of a lot more manageable for several very key reasons. I almost found myself divorced and paying child support last time during Vanilla because I allowed it to consume me, I neglected my wife and newborn children utterly for years and still breath a sigh of relief my wife stuck around until my shore duty ended which basically snapped me back to reality but even then it was an uphill battle to rebuild our marriage and responsibly play retail WoW (kind of easy when it's sucked dick since Cataclysm)              
---
             
---
The magic and mystery is gone, yes I will have a blast playing the great original but i'm no longer left wondering whats the best spec, wheres the best gear, how to effectively perform my rotations and just whats at the end of the rabbit hole. Unless "Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind" is a documentary there is no chance in hell any of us will slip back into that mindset with even just a small amount of will power.                
---
               
---
Also again not to be dramatic but WoW really did come insanely close to ruining my life, I was uncontrollably drinking and playing and at one point contemplating suicide. Once agian I have this key component called memory and would have to be insane to allow it to get that bad again and with all the information avaliable on here, youtube and just common knowledge if you played Vanilla theres not a giant reason to sink 100 hours a week into the game. Wana raid well there 500x videos telling you where the best gear is and what the best strategy is and what consumes to bring and lets be perfectly for god damn real, the real raid boss in WoW was a super shitty internet.              
---
              
---
Retail may be trash and getting 40 people to pay attention and show up is a chore but if you can stomach LFR's nonstop shit show and your not still playing on a 56k modem Vanilla Raids are not going stress anything.
---
For me its starting over that im excited about. Cant wait to start with the name and class ive always wanted. Im the epic troll shaman Thex!!!
---
I share that feeling.
---
&gt;Can you please explain to me how I misinterpreted the message I quoted?
---
I can't know why you are misinterpreting something because that happens inside your head. My best guess is you are reading it like it's a stand alone statement without reading what I responded to. Context matters so if you aren't paying attention to it you won't understand most things you read.
---
&gt;And if it was all about your personal choice, then why are you even trying to support it with arguments like "the only sets for warriors in the game are plate"?
---
I guess because it's a fact and it supports my personal understanding the game. I like to use facts to support my world view.
---
Craft the Community experience you want to see.
---
College schmollege.  Classic WoW &gt; education!
---
Your vulgarity and insults does not strengthen your arguments.  
---
Layering proves that the game is hyped and people will be leaving in mass.  
---
People will be leaving unfortunately because of the lack of content at level 60. 
---
There's no skill needed to play this game, like every old MMORPG this game is about grinding. I would be curious what you consider difficult in Vanilla?
---
I remember when hunter 1-10 pre pet quest was sooo boring, then i tried a paladin for a few then decided fuck it ill be hunter and never looked back.
---
Someone get that bingo thing so we can cross this one off
---
Troll or undead? ^_^
---
K, dude
---
If a guild actually gives a boomkin caster gear over a mage, that's a massive red flag.
---
Get outta there.
---
Wow, really? You managed to cap, get attuned, and make it to Ony all in one day?
---
Impressive...
---
I've seen several Boomkins on Pservers in raids.  Once you're AQ+ gear and you melt through BWL and MC, all those specs that suck because they run out of mana don't have worry so much because every fight is over quick.
---
Phase 1 in Classic?  Yeah, probably not that many.
---
Stress test has nothing for WoW classic total servers.  This is a global release, they're testing it during Blizzard's office hours.  
---
How many servers were in the last stress test?  They make a server that has 3500 slots available, they get 30k people trying to log on worldwide, great success for them.
---

---
Get a less shitty guild
---
That guide is ok, but it's based on private server experience where voidwalker dps was overtuned.
---
The most standard way to level a warlock is to go affliction straight to shadow mastery something like this https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IA0bVRbkA 
---
Warlocks are very flexible though. The core talents are 5/5 improved corruption and 2/2 improved life tap, after these you can go with whatever you want.
---
Mage.
---
I would really not recommend this unless you're purely in it for the questing/lore. So much of what makes the experience is the world pvp.
---
Swapping shields is really easy:
---
&gt;/equip Nameofyour2Hweapon  
---
&gt;/equip Nameofyour1Hweapon  
---
&gt;/equip Nameofyourshield
---
This was made with Arms in mind. If you play Fury, and if you use an off-hand weapon that can be equipped in either hand, then you will need some more lines in there. (Otherwise it will just replace your mainhand with your off-hand instead of taking off your shield.)

This is a Chinese song called I'm Still Young, I'm Still Young by Lao Wang Band. Here are the lyrics in English:
---
In this world
---
You seek your dream.
---
You ask me where the dream is
---
I'm still young; I'm still young
---
They all say
---
We leave our ideals
---
in those wild days
---
I don't cry
---
I don't escape
---
Give me a bottle of beer
---
And give me a cigarette
---
Let's go now
---
I have more than enough time
---
I don't want to cry alone in the the days to come
---
that I won't be able to go ahead
---
I'm struggling on the edge of youth
---
I'm gazing from the end of freedom
---
I'm wandering on the desolate grasslands
---
Looking for ideals
---
Looking for, looking for ideals.
---
Your bis chests for Phase 1 to phase 3, and phase 4 to 5 are both  tailoring you twit. Robe of the Void and Bloodvine chest. I think a guild might care that their raider is too lazy to get full on bis chest items for 50% of the game because he's a stubborn fool. 
---
Any guild in the top 25% will absolutely care about tailoring on their casters. I'm sure your guild wouldn't care if a warrior never got lionheart? Rogue didn't get devilsaur set? 
---
Tailoring is incredibly powerful in vanilla for clothies and you are doing yourself and your guild a disservice in cheaping out.
---
Because the burden of carrying everyone through the entire game takes a toll.
---
I mean this is prolly not even the first ‘Battle Station’ post today even...
---
Hopefully the day/night cycle actually works on Oceanic servers. Retail OCE is always dark during peak hours.
---
Did you raid before 1.7? Before that limit was 8 and you had to be careful. When it went up to 16 iirc we stopped caring.
---
one thing to note, you sometimes sunder in battle or zerker stance as a dps warrior
---
No, thanks tho. The one I'm looking for has mob levels for each area of each zone. Like very detailed, each little section of each zone labeled with what level the mobs are that spawn in that area.
---
Thanks everyone for all the love from the last one! This week to make things easier, I figure'd id make a strawpoll for everyone to vote for the next class they want to see
---
http://www.strawpoll.me/18416963
---
And, as it was brought up alot, my wife's (the artists) website is found here http://dawndragonart.webstarts.com/index.html , incase you love her art and wanted a comission or to just see some awesome art! 
---
and, if you wanted to support her art in other ways(another common question from last time), her patreon is here https://www.patreon.com/dawndragonart
---
So why dont they just ask blizz to buff the other classes or nerf them?
---
Hmm, I don't have this problem. On PC where I have Retail and Classic installed, I can swap between versions using the dropdown. On Mac where I only have Classic installed, there was no configuration necessary.
---
Though, right now, there is no way to filter game versions to Classic-only when browsing or searching for addons.
---
did you mostly click? The things you have keybound are some of the last things i would think to keybind if I was mainly a clicker
---
Great guide!  
---
Typo correction:  
---
**Why you should play a Hunter**  
---
A good hunter is a **devastating** foe in all types of PvP.
---
At first glance I swore you wrote "Stress test Thex".  Damn memes.
---
I don't think it's for raids lmao
---
