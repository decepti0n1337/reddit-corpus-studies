I think the expected skill cap is pretty low but the actual skill cap is pretty high. Every class has 20+ skills and while a large number of them may be situational that can mean the difference between a dungeon clear and a wipe.

---
---
feel like everyone in this thread is glossing over the fact that they were master looting an ubrs run lul
---
Where is the lie?
---
Guys, this is what we're upvoting now?
---
Wait, as a mage a group pulling when I'm oom gives me free license to AoEtard the next pull without waiting for the tank to get threat?
---
Apologies on behalf of the Horde.
---
Came looking for a Yega reference, was not disappointed! Lol
---
Switched for good, my man
---
Just thought id let you know that its VC. Anyone that says DM is a retail player like OP.
---
I retired a 45 paladin and rogue life is amazaing right now. I'm 49 and a 51 warrior tried to gank me, I wiped the fucking floor with him.
---
mind sharing the macro?
---
Its pretty much a do anything item for a warrior.
---
This is venoxis EU, i was in Crossroad where all startet. Funny seeing something from the server where i play.
---
&gt;contains mobs
---

---
Are you asking if I understand that it's an area that  has mobs or an rea the confines them to a specific location?
---
Honestly I feel like the downward spiral started in wrath, around ToTC and the addition of LFG. Vanilla through wrath at ulduar was a progressional grind all the way through. To see new content you had to put in a lot of effort to keep a guild, go through a raid progression to see the next content and blizz didn’t care if you were late to the party. When the next set of raid content got dropped, if your guild wasn’t good enough to finish the content you were on, you didn’t get to jump into the next raid, and they didn’t have as many catch up mechanics (even in tbc and wrath, badges didn’t completely supplement raiding). So while you’re limiting players from seeing everything, it gave the game a lot of purpose that’s been stripped away since the addition of lfg and Lfr, but even more so with flex groups and normal and heroic raiding before mythic. Yes there’s now content for everyone, something for every player level. But with every difficulty level is a stepping stone to the next things that’s easy to follow. Heroics dungeons&gt; Lfr &gt; normal &gt; heroic &gt; mythic. And if for some reason you get stuck say on heroic raid, and new raid drops, you have 0 incentive to stick around and progress through it, as the normal mode version of the new raid is better gear and easier to clear. So you never hit a way or have to progress. This is only worse now with raids having no unique reward like tier sets that change that seasons game play for your class, you can keep growing your ilvl without ever having to raid. And it makes the game feel really empty when all you’re looking at is ilvl increases every so many months when new content comes out. I truly believe that destroying the raid structure that existed in vanilla and the burning crusade and even early wrath (once ToTC and ToTC came out it truly began the never having to finish the previous raid trend) that the work that needed to go into your character truly died. It means nothing to have ICC gear because EVERY ONE had ICC gear. While in TBC having gear from BT or MH was an accomplishment that was recognizable, I don’t even mean to be conceited by saying this, but when I’d stand around a capitol city and people would whisper me and congratulate me on getting an item or something because it meant more than me playing the current basic content that everyone else can clear and getting random item slot with random ilvl. 
---
And this goes to the sense of community being destroyed with lfg, Lfr, cross server groups, and whatnot, on retail besides your current guild, you have 0 interaction with players from your actual server with how merger and cross realm everything is. In vanilla and tbc and wrath, and eh even cata up through the addition of Lfr, you would group with players on your realm, you knew their guild names, probably followed their progression, knew who to group with and there was a genuine community within your realms. Classic is thriving by simple stuff like the struggle of getting a 5 man together and traveling there and knowing you don’t want that group to fall apart because it’s not as easy to replace a player as just queuing for another slot. Turns out players like actually having to interact and whatnot. 
---
I really hope classic becomes its own side game that never immediately follows into tbc and so forth, I just want this to be a second chance for wow in general. A reboot of sorts. Because at this point I don’t believe blizzard can undo what they’ve created on retail.
---
Are you guys memeing? No consumables in a normal duel is not a very difficult rule to comprehend. I can start using greater frost protection potions against mages in duels but that would defeat the entire point of dueling in the first place.
---
Yep. Dungeons went from being thrilling challenges with cool rewards to AOE tunnels built to satisfy methed out tweakers who can't even wait long enough for someone to loot bodies before they're starting the next pull.
---
Oh I was thinking epl/wpl mobs would drop it
---
I'm asking you if you understand that there's mobs nearby which means nothing is preventing him from killing the warlock.
---
At one point a game developer in the face of players asking for something said something along the lines of "People think they know what they want, but they really don't." They got an incredible amount of shit for it. It is basically a saying that several extremely successful business people have said previously, but it definitely applies to games like WoW.
---
People THINK they want all of these abilities of convenience...and yeah they do save time, but they also impact the game in other ways.
---
In an MMO players interacting with players is critical. All those conveniences drove players away from the interactions with people. You never got to know someone. If you leveled up using LFG on retail, people could gain 5-10 or more levels in a night. You almost certainly never saw them again even if they were great to play with. In Vanilla and Classic, it isn't uncommon to see people over and over again. Doing a dungeon with someone in your 20's and 30's and seeing them again in later dungeons.
---
The interactions with other players is a major part of what made WoW great.
---
The changes they made attracted more people to WoW, that too was important and why it found success. Now those people also get exposure to what it used to be like.
---
as much as people like to hate on it for being the "streamer server", i've found faerlina to be pretty well balanced and its super populated. i rerolled off of a medium/high pop server and the difference is night and day.
---
Oh god its Keyori...
---
Nah I’m a human paladin named Arlyon. My warrior buddy and I were farming devilsaur the other night and had a literal 11 man horde raid come after the 2 of us after we camped a couple rogues who jumped us once.
---
Those 2 rogues were part of the raid and it was the only way they could beat us apparently lol.
---
Dumb to do if the tank and healer aren’t in on it.
---
The chores in cata made me quit the game. So fucking bad.
---
You're missing my point. The fight is different on mythic. It isn't the same boss with only extra health that hits harder (some entry bosses are admittedly). Every role typically has different responsibilities and significantly more things to be weary of.
---
I think mythic first came out with WoD, so take a look at heroic Margok and mythic Margok difference.
---
My guild has found that the best way to do it is to have an off tank stay around #8 on threat in p1, after only lands in p3 she might go chomp a few people but will eventually land on an off tank fairly quickly and from there you just finish her
---
I dont mind at all. If im oom before a pull I sit.
---
If the tank dies because they didn't wait np ill rez em and they learn their lesson so they don't do it again =)
---
tea bags are part of the game.  your safespace is someplace else
---
PM me if you ever need to talk
---
Ok
---
if theres only 1 person in the group from a guild its not a guild run
---
So there was this item called the Censer (or some variation) and it basically nearly killed you, but then you could fight anyone that was flagged. 
---
At one point the new level boosts spawned in the middle of timeless isle, and were IMMEDIATELY slaughtered.
---
Fullproof logic :D
---
Go ahead and explain yourself bud. You are being intentionally vague as usual.
---
I personally got mine from voone, i havent seen urok drop it myself but i speculate its similar to the HoJ from Angerforge not emp, older atlas loot versions operate off the patch that shifted some of the loot tables around, including moving (or adding?) HoJ to emp's loot table. The newer atlas loot fixes this as far as I remember.
---
I've seen people be bigger dicks to other players since the beginning of the game. So it's always been an experience
---
Oh I would too. I just wasn't sure if it was a thing because classic wow is so full of bugs
---
I didn't know that mobs hitting players needed an explanation, I'm sorry.
---
This is only really true if you use a level based system. I think the next big innovation in rpgs is to do away with leveling entirely. This might look like GURPs (though in a way that's just leveling with extra steps) or it might look like Planetside 1 (which had leveling, but leveling made you more diverse instead of more powerful).  
---
Warframe sort of does something like this, but there is still a clear level curve to content.
---
I said earlier in another thread. Just farm Stock for wool or SFK for Shadowfang drops. 
---
Shadowfang is more of a long con for when phase 3 hits and people will want it for their twinks.
---
Oof I'm not a Skinner I haven't had to deal with the devilsaur mafia but I hear yang gang can be pretty disruptive down in ungoro
---
Do you remember the guild name?
---
There's always a few guilds that start shit, Alli for Incendius has like 2-3 I could name haha
---
Is your sit macro just /sit and then youre moving to get hit during the standup animation or are you tapping a macro like
---
/sit
---
/stopattack
---
/startattack
---
And what about switching from DPS to tank while im leveling/at end game for dungeons and raids without spending a ton of gold for talents?
---
Congrats
---
30 spellpower
---
Nice. We did all bosses with me (60 warrior tank), 53 or 54 druid heals, a high 50s rogue, 57 mage, 58 lock. 4.5 hrs. The only reason it was quick was because I had a map pulled up on my 2nd monitor and I had the shadow forge key. Once you complete it, it feels like a fucking marathon.
---
My eye balls
---
Except i did dotdotdot
---
And what is the right macro?
---
Atleast you can try fear them.
---
CONVENIENCE KILLED WOW, CHANGE MY MIND
---
This. Deleted my level 43 troll hunter weeks ago. Rerolled into something I wanted to play in the first place (night elf) and didn't regret it till now that im level 60 and raiding. You can find nice guilds everywhere, but your character will never change appearance.
---
Bis is raid gear.  Not all drops fall into that category.  A lot will serve dual purposes but not all.  Priest bis will be woefully short on mana and stamina for world pvp.  It also isn't optimal for 5 man's either.  Highly tuned bis lists assume raid conditions with people covering roles.  It also assumes certain rotations of spells.
---
Should a fury warrior dps in leather or mail in a 5 man?  He certainly can but if he is nervous about being the tank mid pull, your gear bis changes.
---
Even as a healer. If I know a fight will only be possible if I dps too, is +healing going to help or do I need spell power
---
Raids do not have the same circumstances as dungeons and pvp.  Assuming that there is only one bis piece per slot, regardless of content will make you into a fool quickly.  Pvp needs burst, stamina, and mana.  5 mans need flexibility and adaptability but less hit.  Raids need max dps and mana efficiency.  It is rare to find all that in one piece.
---
How is he being a dick though?
---
Now THIS is a quality post. 
---
Good job
---
Ok but they live in piss water
---
Then why are you posting this?
---
That makes literally no sense. Keep being a disingenuous ass like you usually do or just man up and explain your opinion properly for once. How is a druid going to kill a same faction warlock in this area?
---
And? It's not world first.
---
the wowhead looter tracks which quests yoy've done.
---
Nah don't forego coldsnap or anything , 2/3 imp blizz is fine
---
Another important talent for PvP in the arcane tree is imo CS
---
well, i wouldn't sell you a lucky charm with that attitude... I'm lying you want some good luck on your rolls? i need to push the lucky charms... lol
---
Isn’t barbarous blade better, let alone the blackblade?
---
They changed their goals. Before they just wanted to make a good game. Now they're concerned with metrics and engagement. 
---
Some of the streamlining really hurt too! LFG, LFR, Flying and the MoP-styled talents really hurt the game in the long run. 
---
Now a more personal take; they became obsessed with reinventing the wheel each expansion. Also they didn't future-proof how they dole out content; they make previous content obsolete, and they keep trying to push higher with numbers and the threats in game. This is unsustainable. 
---
For instance, instead of adding levels and bigger numbers, our 'levelling' experience could've been unlocking a new talent tree (but you had to choose a max of 3 of your trees to be usable). So sure, that'd only be be a 4 total with BC, but by Cata that would have been a total of 3 new trees per tree; you could have entirely replaced (or mixed and matched) the talent trees for different playstyles.
---
Have an upvote fellow Gelkis
---
Have you tried making multiple chat tabs.
---
I was wondering this.
---
It is.
---
They just think everybody lives off welfare and has no life. I mean dedication is fine but there is some limit in each persons life.
---
There's so much stuff in start UD you might as well run it.
---
What weapon enchantments interfere with Windfury Totem?
---
Apparently the capacity to learn escapes you.
---
Stop digging that hole.
---
Tbh it is you who is being ridiculous. You know what they meant but highlighting that so stfu.
---
I have epic mount and 500g in the bank so obviously it's worked out for me not running to town every time I think I have something worth selling on ah
---
Simple.
---
It's a real MMORPG.
---
Retail WoW does not even resemble an RPG.
---
Meh w/e they feel like, I mean waters are free to make it does take time tho, to make 120 55 water I actually have to drink/evocate more mana. Most I’ve gotten was 3g for 120 55water
---
Amazing
---
People like him are never happy with themselves, let alone other people and their achievements. Grats on the dope weapon.
---
Thank you for posting some examples on how removing spell batching would change class balancing. Which is why it should stay in the game, just like the debuff limit, among other things.
---
I did not know that but that’s pretty sick tbh
---
There is a copy pasta here.
---
[Reminds me of something...](https://imgur.com/a/BmZkQQb)
---
Whats up with the clickbait? "Make 1000g in one day". Unless you play all 24 hours, you're not gonna make 1000g a day.
---
i expected a different outcome\^\^
---
That’s a complete dick move, and downright genius at the same time, I love it.
---
Atlas loot.  I don't need bis guides anymore
---
sounds like you should leave that guild.  I run a LC guild as the war class rep and Daggers are really good for tanking and good OH for fury as well.... Having to choose is a meme
---
Khadgar.
---
Its just obvious he used the ingame map. The lines in the fatigue water are the same, the non fatigue area is outlined, The vile sea is in the same spot, the islands are all perfectly placed. If he did it by walking the land there would be a ton of small errors. He did an amazing job of recreating the map.
---
 I just dont know how peoples first thought was buddy had enough time to walk and scale all the locations to size. I guess the question wasnt dumb, it was low effort.
---
I'm not sure what that question has to do with my comment but sure?
---
Was this impromptu or planned?
---
Poisons and sharpening stones. Basically, any temporary buff.
---
Permanent buffs like weapon chains or enchants do stack with windfury.
---
Dude it's really easy to tell a bot from a player. Like reaaaaaly easy. It's pretty safe to assume this person can tell they're a bot.
---
Imagine caring about BiS in a game that was finished more than 10 years ago. People cleared MC not even at level 60 just a couple weeks ago lol.
---
If you try some whack shit like this and fail, you earned the teabag.
---
Only thing that was planned was 3 say macros from when I got revived, everything else was improv by me and randoms that just happened to be there
---
We need one night so [insert fart noise].
---
idk how i feel about this
---
I'm doing the generic 2h fury hamstring spec as hord but with 3/3 cleave. Works great for dungeons and still very good dps in raid
---
WoW is an MMORPG. Retail is a game.   
---
Casual players responded well to game elements and such so Blizz went that route. If you played vanilla back in the day then the writing was on the wall.
---
Haha thanks bud. Appreciate it! Was surprised by his speed lol 😅
---
This is the first female dwarf I've seen in classic
---
I just did it because I hadn't ran it fully since vanilla. I only did a/a/g farm.
---
let’s see some PvP against actual level 60s. 
---
most of those kills are people in their 20-30s.
---
[removed]
---
the mass fear after p2 is the main threat wipe
---
have your tank activate berserker rage when she lands and the rest of the raid should suck the fear and you are g2g
---
What action bar add on is that?
---
Yo dude, how are you so bad? Everything you did was insanely terrible, that was some true 2004 WoW!
---
I just leveled up a rogue to farm, tbh.
---
People have been killing princess solo for cash, but I find that to be a pita even if it takes 10 minutes per run.
---
As a fan of their leveling method and the dedicaton they put in to achieve their record, can I not enjoy the game?
---
Bahaha that’s great
---
It doesn't work the same as private servers, you have to be standing up right when you get hit. It more mechanically intensive, and takes practice. But watch the video, I can get it to proc most of the time.
---
There are plenty of "recent" videos you can watch showing you how it's done
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXX8URSUWm0
---
So many people do no configure their weapon swing timer
---
&gt;I wanted to test this out because i had 100+ stacks of mageweave from farming ZF all weekend and selling the cloth alone would take a while because there is not that much of a demand for mageweave.
---
Why not just turn it into mageweave bandage and vendor it? Will net you 80s a stack.
---
That's the vanilla experience
---
Trying to get a friend who has never played to start playing...  What class would you recommend for him?  Hopefully a tauren so I can roll a druid to level with him lol
---
Yeah no official data but alliance here is pretty strong . Never feels empty even in off peak hours
---
That's hilarious. I wish I was on a RPPvP server :/
---
IMO an MMO without leveling wouldn't succeed
---
There’s little else to worry about as DPS, it’s not like staying alive is hard. So topping DPS or parsing as high as possible is the only thing to strive for
---
God I love that movie
---
Right? I mean, back in vanilla the pvp videos at least were of someone attacking someone else of the same level and doing incredible things (for the time).
---
This is just pathetic /u/Flurry23
---
Jesus
---
....Turn off your add on.
---
doesn't work well for druids, as when you're in a different form it tries to cast whatever you've bound in Clique.
---
Is that code for gamer girl piss?
---
Yes
---
Owls are everything a gorilla wishes it could be. More AoE threat, less cooldown, tankier and can actually use a mobility ability (Dive).
---
meh, really.
---
I speak as someone who leveled as a warrior in tbc. It felt good to use a ranged weapon, especially for pulling, but it was clunky as hell for any other use.
---
We got heroic throw and similar spells on retail and we're pretty much fine with that without the hassle of finding ( and having to contest) a ranged weapon with hunters.
---
Thought, i always imagined as a opportunity loss not having other classes to use ranged weapons more properly. Like, pass the warriors that are more like barbarians than soldiers, but for rogues that have 3 very similar specs they could have done something voer that, like they did to survival hunter.
---
Luigi out here looking jacked.
---
I got one of these as a drop a few years ago and it’s my only note worthy piece of anything.
---
Yep. For me once I'm done getting the stuff I need I start working on collecting cosmetic stuff. It's funny to dress up like a rogue or a mage on my warrior and fuck around, and if people are rolling just to shard I'll just pay the difference if it looks like a fun toy.
---
This is what peak performance looks like.
---
I like how you just smashed your butt on his butt. I would've guessed you to be a head sitter-onner.
---
Hmm have to check wool price on my server but i kinda feel thats not worth cuz the game is so fresh that a nice wool stock is stilll around.
---
I was actually wanting to charge another account and boost till 40 something with my ele..maybe ill just do that and meanwhile i boost it on dungeons i get a little bit of gold lol
---
He aggroes as many mobs as he can, runs right past the warlock and throws him a buff then just runs away. When the mobs stop chasing him they will all turn on the warlock.
---
we get it, it's just too meta to merit a response
---
Yeah a lot of the ideas and shit I see come from pservers are awful. Seems like the tweaker gogogo mentality comes from there, and they think classic is just another pserver and get confused when shit is different.
---
I think hunter's a good choice for a new player, especially with a little guidance from a veteran on some of the more unintuitive aspects of the pet system.
---
&gt; Mythic is a very different fight than heroic on retail though.
---
But that's not the flavor of an MMO. You click a few GUI buttons and change the game to be different. That isn't satisfying to many players regardless of how much superior the end result is. I didn't interact with the world, I interacted with a minigame within my GUI. 
---
This is a theme of MANY decisions Blizzard made for wow. LFR, LFD, group finder, achievements, spec swapping, complex DPS rotations. They take away something that used to belong to the domain of interaction with the world and other players and moved it to interactions with your GUI. This makes it easier and faster to accomplish, yes. But it incrementally makes it less of an MMO.
---
With shammy? Isnt her nature immune?
---
Been farming Lord Rocco’s for Mantle of Lost Hope but getting a feeling it’s not in the game yet. Could someone confirm this?
---
On a side note, why do most lists of pre-raid BiS items seem to have no stamina. Doesn’t seem wise to have 2k hp when there’s unavoidable random damage in a number of fights.
---
Only an alliance bum would go kick some children for not getting his way.  FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
That's where I was leaning...  It's an easier race to solo with if you don't know what you're doing
---
nice work. you got to also solo the patrols near there as well i guess
---
That's just for the group finder. Which, I guess, sounds like a big part of the game but really isn't. If you actually care about the end game you'll form groups yourself, though instead of spamming /2 there's a separate tab where you can list or look for groups. These groups don't have personal loot. 
---
Though admittedly I quit at the end of Legion but I've heard rumors that BfA has forced personal loot in every single group. I dunno about that though. Anyway, BfA has only been out for a year, so even if it's true there hasn't been forced personal loot "for a long time"
---
low levels are there to be ganked
---
Honestly, the GOGOGOGO mentality wasn't from pservers in my experience. That's seems a retail thing.
---
😂
---
The mechanics are different, but the model and name are the same. The guy understands that the fights are completely different, but since he beat the same character, he doesn't feel as motivated to fight him again where he has a new box of tricks.
---
Some of us browse by newest haha. Just peep the dudes post history. A lot of negative shit.
---
I saw a guy spamming that the other day for half an hour.  Once he dropped the reservation he only had to say it once.  Could have ran it an extra time if they hadn’t been reserving items.
---
How do you spend a million dollars?
---
One dollar at a time.
---
[Lazy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqM5L5JQseI)
---
This was my thought too haha
---
Yeah which is a super obvious and easy to avoid tactic. No where near as effective and easy as banishing mobs.

I maintain that while not perfect, i would play legion with just as much gusto as i do classic now. Legion was amazing. The specs were so, fucking, fun, to play. I would look past bfa's lackluster content if i enjoyed playing my character still. Its not the same as classic, and i dont want retail to become classic, i want them to fix what they done fucked up from the last expansion to this one and get rid of what they should have in the first place.
---
Gear score and dungeon finder.
---
What's stopping you?
---
I like Silithus. There is almost no one here on my server. The 5 people that are there are in the NW corner. It's been profitable.
---
Huzzah! A server of culture!
---
Try buying over a 100 level 45 water at a vendor and you can decide for yourself if 1g is "tipped way too much"
---
How would that work, though? If you remove someone from the party he still has like a minute to get out of the dungeon before he gets ported.
---
I was a huge classic hater. a very big "you think you do, but you don't" proponent. I actually thought it would take a special kind of nerd to enjoy this. but honestly with the WQs, the way retail plays, the abilities it's lost, and the lack of difficulty of the rpg aspect... it feels like some far-gone mobile game. obviously other than the amazing pve encounters, theres really nothing pulling me back. like the call of duty of mmos but without as good of an instant gratification. fucking unbearable chores like lfr, WQs, even normal raids... just a joke
---
Wow, this is exactly hte kind of response I was looking for! Really more than you needed to do but thank you :D .  
---
  
---
Looks like I'll start with freedom for all creature :D Then head over to Hinterlands!
---
Yeah that's cool, I touched upon that in my original post. Some people are motivated by the guild competition on server leaderboards, others might want to clear for story.
---
I’m a fairly new player, I’ve always wanted to play WoW, but my parents wouldn’t pay for the sub and I didn’t have a good enough computer for it...as I’m grown now I’ve tried playing WoD, Legion, and BfA, I always seem to get to level cap, then I feel lost or overwhelmed with the amount of stuff I have to do, and just give up to go play another game, even watching videos on what to do after capping is like holy shit..I also didn’t like the infinite power creep that is the HoA, just seemed like something to keep you subbed I guess. But when classic came out it was like I could live my childhood dreams of playing WoW, and I loved it, it seems so much simpler, a lot of different things you can do, but don’t really Have to do, and Seems like a lot less to take in overall and not having that feeling if I have no idea what’s going on or I’m stupidly far behind is really nice. Just from a newer players prospective.
---
I dabbled in Legion a little and it felt more like a FPS than an RPG.
---
Some company should make a virtual reality MMO like Sword Art: Online
---
Where did you find tbat original picture, OP? Asking for uh... a friend.
---
You’ve met with a terrible fate, haven’t you?
---
As an Undead rogue, terrorizing Redridge Mountains.
---
What level did you get to before you finished the series? haha
---
If you expect to play together he can pretty much play whatever he wants. 
---
Hunter is easy to pick up and is nice because it can solo well. But if you plan to level together I'd broaden that to any strong class.. warrior, rogue, warlock would all be viable also with a druid partner and if he plays orc or troll it's not a far walk to meet up with a tauren.
---
Time :/
---
Who hurt you?
---
Enjoy ❤️
---
Why have 3 difficulties. 
---
Heroics are all puggable.
---
I don't play on a server that has streamer cancer, and I wonder if that's why I see less of this nonsense.
---
Murder all around your level. I don’t find it necessary to gank ultra lowbies

You could chose personal loot if you were the group master, yes, but it gave less loot per boss (on average) so anyone serious about endgame progression never used it. Sure, group finder forced it, but ever since it was introduce the group finder has barely ever been worthwhile. Maybe a short period of time during wrath where badges of justice gave pre-bis gear, but aside from that no one who cares about raiding (and therefor bothered to reserve gear or join groups that did dungeon that could reserve gear) would do it.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
I enjoy the fact that I don't need to be pressing buttons 24/7 but also the occasional oh shit pulls where I really need to make the right decisions so nobody dies. 
---
Not wasting mana in tight spots makes alle the difference between a wipe and success when you fuck up with adds. And not wasting mana makes the party go quicker because they don't have to wait for you drink after every pull if you manage to pull normally.
---
So I guess I just really like mana management. It's a lost art. Leaveing someone who doesn't have aggro at 100 health is totally fine and may save you one more heal for the tank. It's super satisfying.
---
But the escort quest wouldn’t count for him anymore though
---
Palins to stack reckoning. But OP was a rogue.
---
that's hot
---
I mean your role as a dps is to do as much damage as possible. Is it really that unreasonable that people wanna optimize that?
---
Hee hee! Now that's a good look for you! You'll stay here looking like that way forever!
---
Then you are in the minority, most rogues don’t even start the fight stealthed, they just run in and start swinging.
---
I bet you play horde. Hah. You are nothing but dirt.
---
That's why I quit at wraith. It felt retarded that every one can just have epics for nothing.
---
Wickerman is outside undercity on way to tirisfal glades. 8pm server time they light it on fire. There are clickable piles around the giant wickerman. They give a great buff for 2 hours!
---
This? Dungeons are long now ,there is so many stories ,bosses and new things to uncover in retail its simple rush queue with total unknowns you will never see and go from a to b in lineral path. Just one of examples,dont even mention dailys and how easy everything is
---
Gorgonash
---
Burn it!
---
Outside UC there is a wicker man that is put on fire around 20:00. Using the ashes gives you the buff.
---
For alot of people if Blizzard removed Artifact Power grind, Titanforging (or tf replacement "corruption") and brought back master loot many people would come back to retail. Mythic Raids are amazing but it's a chore with no real rewards.
---
There is no point being a hardcore raider since you get equilevant gear from outside of the instance, not to mention you get to see content anyway on trivial difficulty. That makes it way less interesting... And blizzard is more interested bringing more and more microtransactions in disguise of pretty mounts and half assed allied races than actual engaging content.
---
Now that I mention mounts, there are way too many of them! After I got 400 mounts I just stopped caring about any of them since they don't feel special anymore.
---
Yes, all does not mean LiTERALLY all. You just be great at parties.
---
A huge part of what you talk about with classic WoW was eternally bitched about when it was current.
---
Imagine being a rogue and bringing fuck all to the raid compared to a warrior. Like the only advantage you get having a rogue is that you have someone you can give the rogue tier set pieces and daggers to. 
---
Imagine getting absolutely clapped in PvP with nothing you can do to outplay your opponent and it feels like Rock Paper Scissors and blizzard doesn’t do anything.
---
You want rated PvP? Most pvpers did. 
---
But that also means you have to balance classes around PvP. So goodbye rpg flavour, because that ele shaman isn’t going to be content getting absolutely demolished by the SL warlock. 
---
Want harder fights? Maybe the raid fights aren’t scratching that itch that they used to. 
---
So let’s put more challenging fights in. Oh wait, now the garbage meme classes are getting benched because the guilds actually need good classes to kill the bosses. 
---
If you want to have difficult pve content where dps tanking and healing numbers really matter, you HAVE to balance the classes. And goodbye rpg flavour if you do that. 
---
Many of the things that people love about classic are anchored around the pve content being easy and the PvP rewards being almost entirely based on time invested. That means that class balance doesn’t matter too much.
---
Is Bite an effective opener from prowl for leveling a BM (currently 36) or is claw better? I usually have growl/bite on auto use but wondering if Bite is worth the 40 focus to initiate a fight during leveling.
---
I healed every dungeon up to 60, including UBRS, as Shadow. You can heal *all* content currently in game as Shadow, assuming you gear correctly.
---
I keep saying this: #nochanges was a good thing when Classic was still being develop to clarify that we wanted a clean slate free of any bullshit that the following expansions added.
---
However, now there are plenty of bugs(!!!) to fix and then to QoL to implement. What is imperative that the team that develop WoW Classic understand, is what are some "fundamental rules" that shall never be broken, That should also be an open discussion with the community imho.
---
Personally? For sure it should be "Never implement something that damage the social aspect of the game", immediately followed by "Do not, ever, for any reason, ever, no more, not forever, and ever, not do, never, implement something that takes away choices from the player, ever."
---
Citation apart, seriously, don't take away choices from the players (blatant example, semplification of talent trees, flattening of class differences, class identity, etc).
---
You're missing my point. Nova doesn't root the Rouge or other melee dps. Why can't you walk away and take a break?
---
With DM out daggers is super viable too. Not that it wasnt before but distracting dagger is amazing.
---
It's totally not too late to make a new character. You don't have to worry about falling behind the curve, there won't be any new raids releasing for a long time, and even after that, there'll always be groups raiding MC.
---
&gt; and popping Blood Fury.
---
the second they drop below 50% health. These guys should really be playing Troll.
---
HotW/NS with a focus on bear skills down the feral tree. Dont take upgraded MotW from resto, just pray some other druid in your raid will handle that for you (bring reagents for that poor soul).
---
Healing is easy. Max rank regrowth and rejuvenation on tank early on and then basically juggle two heals: max rank healing touch and rank 4 healing touch. People will snipe your heals, they just will. Your heals are super slow right now. So when you're casting healing touch you watch the recipient of your heals like a hawk, if he pops up to near full health you cancel your heal and choose a new target.
---
Innervate yourself mid fight when you're getting low.
---
If you get low again after that: pop a mana potion and a dark rune. Oh yeah, go farm dark runes. Innervating before using consumables is gonna save you a lot of heartache, no one likes popping mana potions and dark runes for a wipe. When you're totally oom and out of consumables, wait until you get enough mana to cast 2  rank 4 HTs and do that over and over until the boss is down.
---
That's it, use innervate and consumables, use rank 4 ht, dont let yourself get sniped. And maybe install a healing addon that helps you predict how powerful your heals are gonna be on different targets. Using a max rank HT isn't a bad idea on targets with tons of HP. 
---
Oh yeah and dont forget about Nature's Swiftness. It's a life saver.
---
Liberal use of the ignore feature will improve  your gameplay experience.
---
You've entered a new topic here which is Blizzard's development focus. 
---
I suspect Blizzard would've performed an analysis of what best retains subscribers with the best cost ratio and determined the current model as most optimal. 
---
Frankly I can't fault them, the current content cycle would keep raiders of any level (except for world first, but they're perma subbed anyway) glued to the game due to learning curve of bosses.
---
For the players that don't care about raiding **and** are heavily reliant on the social aspects of an MMO, perhaps Blizz have found these players don't sub long enough to justify the content investment.
---
For example, for a player that only cares about the social aspect of 1-60, what value is there for these players at 60? If they don't raid, there will be a limit to how long they're subbed for. Sure, they can make alts, but this segment would be a minority to raiders.
---
I don't understand the prio of those sort of rolls?
---
Iv won the roll with same number as someone else not matter if I rolled before or after them, iv also lost stuff under the same circumstances, does the game just random choose one of the high rollers to win?
---
Do we really need another one of these posts? And you cant even take a screenshot, jesus christ.

I searched Leather BDSM - was going to make a different meme.

Heckin beast? Lmao

LOL @ the 60 overlaid on their actual level
---
At some point they should have moved onto a wow 2.0. With each new expansion the previous ones become less and less relevant. Eventually you have such a huge gap there’s no real start and finish anymore. Most new players come play and start at like 100 or 110. They’d have no reason to start over at level 1 when others didn’t have to now. your characters lose their time added value they once had. It reminds me of when Everquest started dying yet they kept making more and more expansions. You’d keep playing because you had already invested so much time and didn’t want it to be for nothing. And if you hadn’t played yet still you’d have less incentive to start playing with each new added expansion.
---
haha wild

They're all wrong. Rogues with wep skill and 5% hit talent only need 1% hit from gear

Heavily horde favored, but theres no lack of Alliance either since its a server with a very high population
---
32.25*0.8 = 25.8g total gold
---
77.75g (DEing masks profit) - (125*(0.18)+125*(0.0022))(silken thread + bleach expenses)=~55g
---
By DEing you earn 30 more gold.
---
there is Action house cut that you need to think about it and Selling bandages is super fast but I mostly did the crafting/DEing while i was eating or taking a break so I like to think of it as afk money making!
---
We actually only have one fury warrior (RIP). His DPS is around the middle of our pack of hunters
---
You can turn the error speech off
---
The writing was on the wall in late Wrath...the whole Argent Tournament thing.  Not only did they implement the 'get tokens not loot' so you could farm it for specific gear sets that were astonishingly good at the time, but the instance *didn't even bother* to make you run through a map of the obligatory mobs/mobs/mobs/boss, it literally FED them to you so you didn't even have to move.
---
Handy as hell for gearing alts...but the beginning of the end in terms of passing the convenience/reality boundary.
---
Imagine potting to win a duel and then proudly posting it to reddit
---
disgusting
---
10% more stats just for having a paladin. Best PvE racials in a game that was designed to be PvE with PvP slapped on later as an afterthought. More and better swords end game than axes.
---
Alliance get the game on easy mode. Blasted Lands fp might as well be Swamp of Sorrows.
---
Every individual change they made was good and perfectly reasonable in a vacuum - but in aggregate they made the game pretty awful.
---
Planetside did pretty well (the incredible shit decision of BFRs is what killed it, not lack of leveling). Warframe also does incredibly well from letting you level up your appearance more than your abilities. People will play for toys and cosmetics as much as leveling. Exploration is also a good reward, the first MMO that truly cracks making compelling static procedurally generated content is going to have a license to print money for 20 years.
---
Most of the playerbase was not happy that their class was almost strictly worse than another. 
---
Now with classic, people are content because they know what they are getting themselves into. 
---
But back in the day, when blizzard was running balance patches semi-regularly, everyone sort of expected that dumpster classes would be buffed and S tier would be nerfed. 
---
Nerfing the  hybrid tax was the biggest thing blizzard did from vanilla to tbc and players LOVED them for it. It was something people had been begging for for years in vanilla. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, people were happy with the game in general. But by and large, everyone wants their class to be good and to be perceived as a vital asset to the group.
---
Actually Ive visited Fungal Rock 8 or 9 times in the past 3 weeks and have yet to see another mage there.
---
Plus there's also the 2 spots that are in dungeons unaffected by other players. 
---
You may have gotten your gold via questing, not everyone plays like you though.
---
Never forget that he led the charge against General Nazgrim. Gamon is a hero.
---
I definitely roll my eyes at some of the messages I see in the world chat. If you are reserving an item then you need to bring something to the group that is unavailable without you to compensate.
---
This can be as easy as being he tank at a non prime time. Or organising Jed/rend runs where you make sure Jed is up every run.

Yeah I'm only buying the essentials now. Is vendoring all my extra stuff enough or should I also sell on the AH? I'll only need 90g thankfully. I haven't set up Auctioneer yet so that's why I was wondering if just vendoring will be enough. 
---
I went from like 6g to 25g from 29-32 though so I'm assuming it'll really pick up from 35-40. 
---
If all else fails I have a good friend that would probably spot me whatever I don't have at 40 but I'd like to do it myself.
---
This is super helpful thanks. I like the idea of going 2 handing, but the lack of access to a good 2 hander means I probably wont until I can get my paws on a decent alternative.
---
Im very salty about losing a roll on a BRE by 6 this evening :D
---
How do I get these Masks?
---
Don't use questie until you feel the need for it. What that means is that you'll be given quests with sometimes rather vague descriptions. Figuring out what to do and asking around is part of the fun.
---
If that gets really annoying for you and you hate all the wandering around then use the add-on.
---
Personally, I've been playing casually for a few years and I dont use it.
---
Right? I tank a lot and sometimes they do stuff like pull while I'm mining, and my philosophy is "Don't tank what you can't pull."  
---
This has driven me to adopt a "my sole job is to keep the healer alive" mentality for any dps who damage something before I have a sunder on it.
---
How do I make them raid frames?
---
uh ok, nice story bro
---
The majority of those cleaves in LFG spend so long looking for the perfect team they fall apart, even if they do get a group chances are that they will only clear a couple times before having to replace someone.
---
I firmly believe that most pugs would be more efficient if they simply ran it normally with a normal party, leave the cleaves for non-pugs.
---
This is my experience as a tanking joining various groups anyways.
---
Yea that’s pretty funny lol. “My game says they’re level 60, it’s a fair fight”
---
Remind me
---
retarded redditors thinking phase 2 wont completely kill certain factions (alliance) on most servers lmao.
---
Well you can only get AP and crit outside of hit, and both are very nice. Crit has a lot of value if you don't usually world buff, but with worldbuffs AP is way stronger. Ultimately you should try get an estimate of how much you value 1% crit in terms of AP, that way you can make decisions based off that. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Crit cap is 34+your hit chance. Basically crit cap is a soft cap, where your auto attacks no longer benefit from crit due to how the game rolls out attacks, but your spells including heroic strike still does benefit, so going above critcap is a deficient, but not a huge one.
---
Thank you! Yes that is one of the troubles I've been having! Thank you!
---
i'm not sure what you're asking. 
---
spell crit has no effect on dots. so both will do the same total damage.
---
they are still easy to kill, and there are only one solo farm that is close with it. How is it no longer viable rofl.
---
Truth be told, I was thinking of seeing someone do this. Thx for the info 👍

That is the most complex English sentence I have ever read.

Wetlands.
---
Which pet skill is better, bite or claw?
---
Sjæle you're at it and somewhat related I would read up on the +5 weapon skill as the hit cap is only a small part of it, reason you wanna use swords as a human is because at 305 weapon skill (and higher) you reduce the amount of clancing belows you do on raid bosses/trash mobs (its also why Edgemasters are highly sought)

Nah these are alts we are only playing together. Still recommend ret for now?

How do I make sure the rogue doesn't 100-0 me in 0.5s and I can actually get a fear off?

What would an mmo without leveling even look like?  I dont really know anything about those games but it seems like thats just taking away RPG elements which is what a lot of people like MMOs for
---
Ofcourse you'll see Rank 14 players before BGs are released, that's because it doesn't matter how MUCH honor you get since it's all based on what everyone else is getting. It's all about staying at the top. You can get a measly 300 honor every week and still get rank 14, if everyone else is getting less than that.
---
It's more than 3% and is easily farmable alongside arena runs. Also everyone in a 10 man hardly needs Reed as there's usually loads of warriors, hunters and rogues after Rend/Drakk or truestrike shoulders. Briarwood is also around a 30% droprate which is very reasonable, every caster in my guild already has it

---
+stam
---
I went 1-60 as full healing spec, because I care more about my performance in groups than when solo. Wand Spec is really all you need to solo, as long as you keep your wand up to date (snagging a Jaina's Firestarter for 3g certainly helped me out a lot). I didn't even put points in Spirit Tap until my last 5 levels, because I had so much spirit from the gear I got farming dungeons that it wasn't necessary. MB &gt; SW:P &gt; wand to death kills a little slower than most classes/specs, but has basically no downtime.
---
Can you heal late game 5mans as Shadow? Of course. But it's going to be a lot easier as a full healing spec, and you'll be able to better keep people alive when mistakes are made. If you plan to primarily solo, stick with Shadow, but if you actually want to be a healer at end game then you should spec for it. You can always level an alt to be your solo farming character.

Sold the bird for 85, holding onto the bow! Thanks

Apparently that's you lol
---
Classic, Warcraft is classic, WoW is new world man.
---
Just wand each boss until it's at 90%, then go crazy. You should have no issues then. Also, you pull aggro at 110%, so you're leaving a lot of damage undone if you're only dpsing to 80%
---
Pretty sure shred then FB is the correct move, always shred if you have the energy/omen proc even if you're at 5 combo points. I think tigers fury doesn't increase FB damage and will be gone after shifting

I mean i'm not familiar with what tweaks to the route he did post classic but he has been reliably doing it on stream for a while
---
Lol ur so mad, better check that bloodpressure if u want me to keep commenting.
---
Depends on how much damage you're taking and how your healer mana is doing. If the healer is 80%+ mana after each pull, pull out your 2h and do some damage. If you're getting thrashed or the healer is going OOM constantly, bust out the shield. Also, shield is often good for bosses, but not always necessary.
---
Ah I see, thanks!

Sometimes, you just gotta tank, even if that's not your spec. Having a piece of gear that's decent for doing that is a good thing.

While i wouldn't recommend you to do Mara cause really its gonna take a very long time killing princess as a Shaman, any caster can easily do Tinkerer. The little guy can be kited anywhere and whenever he stops to do his dragon breath you get a cast in and then keep running.

Yes the game chooses one of the person randomly, in the same way as it chooses who wins an item when everyone needs ; Through a dice roll. In case of a tie there is a second hidden dice roll between everyone who tied and the winner of that roll gets the item.

The loot table is not at all as it was before in vanilla, and on private servers. The whole value of farming lashers were for those grays that sell for high prices, however they lowered the drop rate of them considerably making it not worth while at all to farm.

---
DM West again: Mintap Talisman drops (+11 MP5). Warlock rolls against the Priest and wins.

LBRS: Slaghide Gauntlets of the monkey drop (BIS druid tanking gloves). Rogue rolls and wins. He could literally have bought greens of the AH for the exact same stats.

On the plus side, my ignore list is growing steadily.

Varian Wrynn. To me, that was the beginning of the decline. I roll up in WoTLK make it to Northrend and now there's this big statue of some dude who I'm supposed to know. Its the King! He's back! And he's this really really cool dude, you'll love him. What? Bolvar? What about him? Well he didn't have a comic written about him so we're gonna kill him off. What you didn't read the comic? Well how will you know the epic backstory of this really cool guy? Did you know he killed Onyxia like all by himself? What? No no no, a plucky band of no-name adventurers didn't kill her! The king did! Isn't that cooler?  Buy the comic, because this is just gonna keep happening.

When I played Wod, I found myself entering a dungeon, being worried that I wouldn't be good at the tanking because I had never tanked. The group told me "just do this one thing" which I did, and we beat the dungeon. I quit right after.
---
I played BFA for a couple days just to try and answer this question. 
---
I made a new character and started leveling since that’s what I’m still doing in classic. 
---
To me the gameplay feels more like Diablo than actually WoW. 
---
The constant spamming of abilities, the fast almost mindless pace, the lack of challenge/difficulty. Then add on the fact that nothing you do matters until you hit the latest expansion. I vendor literally everything I pick up. Professions are worthless. I run dungeons with people I don’t know and will never see again (might as well be bots...).  I never speak to a trainer, return to a major city, so there is no immersion or feeling that I’m in an actual persistent world. Everything scales to level with me, so I never feel like I’m getting stronger. I just keep spamming the same abilities over and over again as I barrel towards max level. 
---
That right there I think is where I think the heart and soul of the game was lost. It feels like they have lost sight of making a world for us to be a part of and experience. Now they just bolt on expansion after expansion without caring to seam them all together into a cohesive world. 
---
In classic we only have one world and everything we do matters actions we make from level one to sixty matter. The journey is the focus and is immersive and enjoyable. It isn’t a barrier to “getting to where the real game begins”.
---
Obvious solution is obvious.
---
Fair enough
---
BANANA MAN T1!
---
Did you make new characters until you got this because thats the lvl 1 starter gear for a mage
---
It can be a hail mary tactic for a pull that looks like a wipe anyways. It almost never works but there are times that its worth the gamble.
---
By all means kick the tank, then spend 30 minutes looking for a new one while that guy gets a new group right away and cleared the instance before you start.
---
Sounds *super* efficient!
---
I stand by that patch 3.1 (Ulduar) was absolute peak WoW.
---
Bad photoshop is bad.
---
Once again, you're stating your opinion as fact. Being a game doesn't magically make it not matter. Maybe it doesn't matter to **YOU**, and that's ***FINE***, but stop stating your opinion on an **OBJECTIVELY** subjective topic as fact. I could say football doesn't matter just because I *personally* don't care for it, but guess what? There are people out their that live for Football and the sport means everything to them. You're just close minded.
---
Also, only Blizzard knows what the plan for Classic is going to be. We don't know what model they're going to follow, it could be Classic+ for all we know. To assume they'll hit a ceiling a drop it when they've announced no such a thing is ignorant.
---
Every game has casual players and hardcore players. Everybody has a different mindset as well. Nobody's attacking your casual approach to the game, the least you could do is show common courtesy. The original comment's approach to the game is just as valid as your own. Get off of your pedestal.
---
So you shouldn't have taken the money. Asshole.
---
Yeah I know it's not normally out for a group, but for that boss if you don't have an OT and it's down to DPS to not die? Pretty obviously a time to use it.
---
If im buying best available 1h swords and axes for my lvl (31 atm) how much Will i miss out if i skip ww axe as human warrior? Love DW So far, doing better than with 2handers atm.
---
Why fix something that isn’t broken?
---
Most mythic fights are the same as heroic, but with amplified mechanics and stats and one or two extra abilities. They rarely have extra phases. Sometimes the additional abilities require a new strategy, sometimes they just require better execution. And when you kill the boss, you get the same items as heroic, but also slightly amplified. It's basically the ng+ version of MMO content. If given the choice, most people would prefer an entirely new game over ng+. The problem was people got tired of not being able to clear all content and started demanding Blizzard's help (because we pay the same subscription WAAHH), which Blizzard were shortsighted enough to give.
---
Why does flying for the last two expansions require a reputation grind for a brand new faction?
---
Answer: they are actively design retail to keep you busy.
---
They ran out of story before the pandas showed up and they've just been chucking shit at a wall and cashing checks since then.
---
That's the point where I quit. TOC is one of the worst raids in WoW.
---
Tanking/dpsing.
---
Time is money, you can still do other stuff in between LFG.
---
Yes, dynamic respawns are a thing. The more players in the area the shorter the respawn timers are.
---
Wrath would be sick if the shoulders weren’t massive, I like the T1 shoulders a lot better
---
Im pretty new still but I’ll keep an eye on our healers mana and kinda gauge how many to pull off of that. I’ll grab a few mobs and if they still have plenty of mana, I’ll go grab a few more while the group is finishing off those mobs. Make sure everything has a sunder on it and taunt anything that runs for the healer.
---
Cool, nobody here cares.
---
I know exactly how I feel about this.
---
Didn't start kicking off for me until level 3
---
**Greed over passion.**
---
That's fair, however i mentioned in another post i didnt cross reference the actual map so all those that don't know it as well as some wouldn't have known just how accurate it was. With the rerelease of classic some of us have only played for a few months :)
---
In any case thank you for actually presenting some thoughtful reasoning.
---
Not all of them. Usually the quests that reward Alliance/Horde rep are at the end of very long quest lines, and once they become grey they don't give much rep.
---
Okay
---
Well done, you played yourself
---
The flying was a mistake in hindsight but all the other things don't distract from the charm and are much welcomed changes.
---
Pots allowed in duels? 🤔
---
Interesting point you make with the interest of people on 60.
---
Im playing classic quite casually with wife and friend and will still take a little bit to 60, but overall it matters little since I don't see myself getting invites for raids and even dungeons as a ret paladin.
---
"Well, play holy then!" No, I won't play something that doesn't bring me any fun at all, I'd rather unsub and wait for bgs that who knows when will be here
---
Running dungeons there's no real reason to spam Maul. 2-3 on each mob should get you aggro on most trash, and then save the rest of your building rage for the next pull. Taunt/Maul if someone does manage to pull off of you.
---
Guys, I've smuggled in some rare aborigines lucky charms to Golemagg. These are ancient runes inbuned with voodoo magic far superior to that of average lucky charms. If interested, you can find me next to the ruined naga tower in Desolace. Also for the most esteemed of you who hate traveling, I'm willing to make a transaction via mail. Address your offer to the undead priest named Almatea, just keep this a secret from the Gadgetzan kingpins.
---
So you think it's just normal to struggle find some rage while tanking dungeons? It's kinda disheartening as with classic I'm not aiming for raids to be honest (no time for that) and until BGs are out I'll mostly play dungeons with friends.
---
NA
---
"....... How are ya?"
---
So basically don't talk?
---
Seriously. The amount of times I brez right when the party wipes, and then healer rezzes after mobs refresh are countless.
---
Phase 5 is a long way away.
---
Classic is bleeding players like nuts, you might see a surge of returning players once BG comes back but expect majority of these servers going to be dead af a year from now.
---
I have tanked a ton as feral (currently 48) and am specced 1/29/8 in preparation to be 1/29/21 at 60.  I probably maul at least 50% of the time.  I sometimes am out of rage, but it means that I have the fight squarely in hand and don't have to worry about losing mobs/etc. 
---
If you're always being hit, there's always a nice trickle of rage coming in that way.  It's not like you have to spam maul every GCD it simply isn't possible.  
---
Priority #1 is keeping monsters off the healer, #2 is keeping as many monsters attacking you as possible.  I like to keep a bit of rage 'in reserve' in case I lose one and then I make sure I have enough for a taunt+maul to build up a ton of rage.
---
This is actually a nice idea but it kinda force non-60 to sit around in the big cities doing nothing until a group is formed. Still better than the current global LookingForGroup channel with a constant flowing of text.
---
What is a man?!
---
pservers didnt have these balance issues they straight up showed the faction population. Nost was 48/52 and so was elysium
---
Ally scum are the same everywhere!
---
But I will try to KOS for you!
---
i just had an original thought, we should burn that tree!
---
You're dumb, VC doesn't come out until phase 2
---
mutant
---
The other day I whispered a dude looking for a healer for ZF. He asked what my build was I explained I'm a 47 shadow priest to which his response was "lol useless". So I just said "well good luck finding a holy priest mid-40's" and ignored. I've run it before, know it isn't that hard and don't have time to deal with that shit.
---
And the fact that those types feel much more prevalent as an option since before at least the expectation was that they would suffer serious consequences. Now you got entire guilds who support that behavior.
---
Found it in settings, thanks now I can spam without being verbally harassed haha
---
I'd much prefer log horizon
---
Thanks for your reply! 
---
Right now my healing gear is what I scrambled together from a lot of brd+ runs as tank so I'm missing trinkets and rings so far. Will be respecting to hotw NS asap. Is the down ranking worth it without good healer gear? I feel like doing fuck all with rank 4. Ofc, I didn't have 0,5 sec off my heal then as I was still in lvl talent deep feral at that point. 
---
I'm gonna look at some heal add-ons. Think more specifically raid bars add-ons. I also saw a macro that would heal on mouse over, that seemed like a big improvement
---
WAIT.
---
Every server will be different.  However the longer you wait usually the better.  However, 50g now may be worth more to you than 300g later?
---
I'll take one of those to go please.
---
Yeah that’s an opinion and has been proven wrong many times over. I wouldn’t read too much into what people think and try to come up with an opinion if your own. Try it out yourself. There are many factors other then what’s meta that comes into play pvp wise.
---
[That too reminds me of something...](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/56/8d/55568d87f0109f900b7765e7256348b8.jpg)

Hi, /u/UndaCuvaBrotha

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dkd2cv/hunter_is_the_most_boring_pve_class/). 
---
Thats why u add golem
---
I'm 20/0/31 and I've healed all dungeons, Onyxia and even MC to Shazzrah, so far no problems. You will need healing gear though.
---
Or Vanishing while your dungeon group is wiping, saving your money on repairs, and throwing something on YouTube while you wait for everyone to run back.
---
What does the "harm" thing do?
---
Also, isn't better to put a "combat" before the bloodrage to prevent an bloodrage out of combat?
---
I'll try later on my warrior, seems pretty good
---
group quest escort... not apart of the group when it started or ended. you get no reward.
---
They didn't lower it, private servers raised it.
---
Vanilla isnt about class balance in PVP. if you want balanced classes go to retail when every class have dmg cooldowns / heals / stuns / etc.
---
I'm sorry, but is the weekly reading of the grudges literally a reading of grudges people had made that week from other players?
---
It could be that you post your info, and then you can go do spething else if you choose. In this way, theres a trade-off that if you choose to do something else, you simply have to wait for psts, but if you are at the notice board, you have the option to search for people yourself
---
Shit like that is what did it for me.  Not flying mounts or LFG automation.  Weird loot/upgrade systems.
---
You're suggesting that mages who AoE prematurely or without thinking of the group do so because the first pull happens when they're oom
---
It's 50%. You either win, or you lose.
---
...
---
But seriously if you rolled a 98 (So yes, 1%), there's essentially a 2.5% chance someone could beat you. (2% outright win, .5% that they also roll a 98 and then a 50% chance of winning).
---
So to make it simple, each person has a 97.5% chance of not beating 98. With four other people, it's .975^4, so a 90.37% chance that they'll fail, or rather, 9.63% chance that no one will beat your roll.
---
So overall, 0.01 * 0.0963, there is a 0.0963% chance that you'd roll a 98 and have someone beat it.
---
I don’t see you providing any data to your claim that people are providing wrong info and not providing data. You broke your own rule. How am I supposed to know this is true with no data to back it up?
---
talking out of your ass
---
Yeah.. several people have told me about this 110%, 130% but i use [Clasic Threat Meter](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classicthreatmeter/files/2796221) and it doesnt go higher than 100%.
---
you can fix the bloodrage issue by adding [combat] to the macro so it would look like /cast [harm, stance:1, combat] bloodrage, then it would only cast bloodrage if already in combat
---
Ok, i'll keep them xD, i don't need money at the moment, i was only making sure.
---
And it could be a good thing to buy the ones actually on the market and resell those too later?
---
Only in UC?
---
the absolute state of this post
---
2/10 with rice would lol again
---
My weapon skill is pretty much maxed for 2h maces. That's not the issue.
---
They're part of the death by 1000 cuts. People now are happy when a warlock is in their group because it means we can summon. It's class homogenisation when every class can summon to every instance. Same with mages being pointless when you essentially have a hearth in every city at once
---
Pls don't kill our big tiddie goth priestess.
---
Also, it's not a full guild run.  There are two other guild's players still in the party, within this screenshot.  Caster's no less. And the other two are a warrior and presumably a rogue.
---
I don't know. I feel more information should be provided before trying to publicly shame an entire guild of people. Especially considering that only one or two individuals of that guild were in this group.
---
hes a troll look at his comment history lol
---
Anything in spellbook - Ok
---
Bandages - Ok
---
Food - Ok
---
Eng granades -Ok
---
Any other consumable is no go.
---
I will die there with you. What a shitty thing, "here's a summoning stone but haha you cant use it!"
---
Thanks my man. I’ll be taking this bby to r13 just as I should
---
bfa players: wait, i think ive seen this before!
---
Yeah I'm usually running on empty most of the time. Part of that is impatient dps not letting me build up threat before they dive in, so I'm always playing catchup with threat.
---
It shouldn't be a problem though, since balancing rage and threat is the whole goal of being a bear tank. Warriors might have a little easier time building rage, but they can't throw on a dress and heal the next dungeon you run. Everything is a balance
---
Too bad it was one of the shortest. So ironic tbh. Only 4 months i think
---
Trick or Treating at Innkeepers!
---
That's Lion's Pride Inn BiS.
---
I laughed. Good shit.
---
A 29 lock will not hit anything in library. Gy, yeah.
---
I'm sure if we're patient blizzard will reply
---
&gt;my philosophy is "Don't tank what you can't pull." 
---
I'm guessing you meant "Don't pull what you can't tank" lol
---
My man ^
---
It does let you report them for gold selling.
---
Oh my God..
---
I nearly forgot this... No, wait, I forgot it for real.
---
Thanks a lot.
---
Btw: I never watched season 4 and above.
---
Where can I stream it?
---
For those not in the know, gold sellers have been sending chat channel invites to people to advertise their selling websites. The option to block chat channel invites stops the obnoxious popup, but still tells you what you've been invited to, and that you've blocked it.
---
Blizzard, simple way to combat the sellers - just don't show the damned invites at all if they're blocked.
---
Do you people just not ever change your chat settings? you can make a brand new chat channel and filter away everything you want, so when you want a dungeon you can switch to that channel and find prospective groups, or make your own group and spam your heart out while looking at a none spammy text box.
---
Good effort on the meme recreation at least!
---
This is a safe space, you piece of shit
---
Winterspring and Hinterlands. I farmed those trolls for hours, and then I was high enough, the furblogs in WS. So atmospheric
---
yes.
---
fuck yes.
---
i know it won't happen, but, if they made summoning stones a thing, i'd be so fucking happy.
---
it's not as big of a deal once you get into end-game since all the instances are centralized and very close to flightpaths, but, the Alliance slog from Southshore to Scarlet Monastery, or getting to RFK/RFD... it'd be made so much more tolerable with Summoning Stones.
---
It's not possible to hit Exalted with Darnassus at level 40.
---
You can do it at lvl 47 with [Morrowgrain](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3803/morrowgrain-to-darnassus), but it's an absurd grind and better to wait til lvl 50 for Runecloth.
---
Just wish they were alliance.
---
Yeah dude! You tell him haha don't let him smile
---
Never played retail so...
---
Exactly, time is money. And in my opinion most pug cleaves are slower and less efficient than a normal pug.
---
Cataclysm was the catalyst for the biggest drop in players and their biggest mistake overall. You could tell exactly what blizz thought of their playerbase when reviewing all the new changes cata brought.
---
Throwback to Big Head Mode. Golden Eye and Turok.
---
It’s a little labyrinthine but should be 90 with a good group. Bosses are super easy.
---
Lol its incredibly obvious. Leveling guilds and even raiding guilds are full of people that have not logged on for weeks, activity way down on reddit, no queues anywhere and layer reduction for all those realms.
---
I still was until you said something
---
&gt;It wasn't until Cata that shit started to hit the fan. Classes got homogenized to high hell.
---
Homogenization actually was around Wrath, when classes were given tools from other classes to round out their kit. Resto Shamans were given more friendly dispels and druids were given a steady medium heal.
---
Regardless it’s not worthwhile to fame as the gold per hour is very low
---
I'll let you know when I find one.
---
NBA Jam also. lol.
---
Why is druid better for herbalism?
---
You have no way to enforce it though.
---
Seriously...got attacked by booty bay entrance and started healing myself,  guards are like that's a paddlin'
---
Dal'rend MH drop chance ~4%
---
Offhand ~14%
---
Savage glad chain ~7%
---
Chance to spawn orc boss, probably 1/6, so yeah basically RNG is RNG
---
As if prot warriors had reduced dmg from spells anyways...also judging by his gear he's as much of prot as my mage
---
Titan was not going to be wow2. Look at Overwatch, now imagine it as an MMO, that was what they wanted for Titan, but they couldn't make it work.
---
Part of what made it so cool is that only one class could teleport
---
Flying wasn't inherently a mistake, it was just never fully developed. Wrath did I lot of cool things with flying in terms of zone design. There could have been lots of things done with PvP in mind as well, like fair ways to dismount players that force them to dismount and fight without just killing them for dismounting from too high.
---
Your argument is they're slow because of replacements or falling apart, but you can still do other stuff during replacements.
---
Spellcleave aren't hard, they're easily more efficient than a normal group. Half of my leveling to 60 are mostly done through pugging spellcleaves
---
its better than being alliance who literally gets no story. most of the alliance story is just tagging along with the horde. so stupid and you can clearly see the horde bias.
---
and the worst part is that the horde story fucking SUCKS so you have all the horde players saying they wished they were out of the spotlight so they didnt have to lose more warchiefs. just a shitshow all around sadly
---
&gt; Whenever I see people ranting about the other version of the game, I can't help but feel that they are jealous that other people are having fun in an environment where they don't.
---
While I restrain my disdain for it, I think that if I were to allow myself to rant against retail it would stem from a sense of betrayal. There is a real feeling that the game that I loved was taken away from me.
---
I'm gonna have to look for the videos of the 20 minute runs. The fastest I've ever been able to do is 34 minutes from instance portal to instance portal. I don't use the alt-log-instance reset though and I stop to look for books and sell at Kreeg.
---
This guy would know hundo percent
---
Lol
---
“Repel the invaders!”
---
That set is soooo dope and I don't even play paladin. Heck, I don't even play *alliance*
---
I know this comment is most likely going to get downvoted into oblivion, but that's fine, I just want to voice this opinion.
---
I think honestly, the game would improve Immensely if Blizzard:
---
A) Split from Activision, just look how much Destiny 2 has improved since the split.
---
B) This is never going to happen, but if Blizz wasn't controlled by stockholders, I feel like they would spend less time working on the in-game shop and only looking at the game from a money standpoint, and gameplay/mechanics would start to shine again instead of everything just being them grabbing aimlessly at subscribers. 
---
I think Blizzard itself is a good company with good employees who care about the game, they're just trapped in a hole right now and can't do much about it. They've got controlling powers on every side telling them what to do, which is why I don't really blame Blizz.
---
Please have mercy on my soul for this opinion
---
For fun duels I agree it is common not to pot. But when you fighting for gold? You do what you got to imo.
---
I'd also like to add that taking the world away from azeroth to a much smaller outworld really were the first nails in the coffin. Instead of expanding upon the amazing world they build. They threw it all away to start over.
---
Not really free for a teink when you consider xp cost.
---
There's info for it on Google but FD is a spell so needs spell hit to guarantee and even then theres always a 1% chance to miss. I think the hit cap for spells is 17% but don't quote me on it.
---
A mob equal to your level has a 4% chance to resist which is lowered by improved FD but still has a 1% chance to miss iirc.
---
Blizzard has been doing that since Vanilla though and it only gained dmore popularity. Molten Core was a much more harder fight than it is in this 1.12 version. Onyxia was a much more harder fight than it is in this 1.12 version. The fact that classic wow is so well received disproves this point. We will eventually reach a point where the top 0.1% of gear will outscale the 99.9% of gear, with the great divide. And that's where Blizz made everything you worked for useless with the TBC global reset.
---
That’s a weapon timer bud
---
Lol eng grenades are ok? Bruh if you are allowing engi consumes and not any other prof that's fucked
---
No the subreddit is related to the mask lol check it out
---
Don’t feel discouraged based on what that user says. One look at his profile says enough; has never posted on this sub themselves but bashes other peoples post almost continuously. 
---
Your post might not have much value for anyone other than the person you were hoping to reach, but at least it’s positive. That already puts it’s inherent value above anything that user has done on the sub. I’d rather have posts like these than what users like them (there’s quite a lot of them, trust me) want this sub to become; a negative shithole. 
---
So, keep posting.
---
/rant over lol
---
I was mostly disc until low 50s then respeced to Shadow. Now I kill stuff WAY faster, and I can also heal 5 mans just fine.
---
They could of been banned for a period in between or given a caution by blizzard. I know blizzard ain’t in everyone’s good books right now but they are pretty good with this kinda stuff
---
Thanks!
---
I gave them to my friend he still uses them at lvl 44
---
Rogue - low repair bills. High uptime.  Extreme class flavor in poisons and lock picking. Off tanking casters and locking down heals. 
---
When played correctly they can be a tanks best friend.
---
Wish.com will get ya
---
Its not me who came up with rules. its beem like this for ages.
---
Ability to stealth, has forms of CC (root/hibernate) which gets rid of most mobs, when you do have to CC something after grabbing a herb you can shapeshift into travel and run away effectively. You can also herb in form as needed.
---
Also not having to kill anything (as skinning would require) is a huge plus
---
Thank you for ridding tanaris of another lowly hordie
---
Right click it and move to new window
---
Is turning and/or strafing actually better when considering melee leeway? I haven't been able to figure that out for sure. Back pedaling seems to prevent one extra hit
---
3 ways: all get naked and die, reset after death; all set hearth to Shadowprey, leave group and get auto kicked; same as last one, except everyone disbands and logs, leader resets and in theory it should put you at the start.
---
This was the best video I’ve seen in a while lmao
---
Thank the goblins haha
---
I personally don't use any macros for stance dancing. I just change the key bind (special action 1-3) to f1-3 and tap those
---
Join your server’s Discord
---
for one thing. in bfa solo content from 110 to 120 last like 10 hours. meanwhile classic 1 - 60 takes 10+ DAYS, or 240 hours+. this along is one thing, as there is a lot to do. heck a lot of people now still arent even 60.   
---
one of the biggest complain in bfa is that there is nothing to do. along side other stuff. repeatable daily quests and worlds quests dont count. i hate that
---
What movie is it?
---
haha yeah
---
The way I would suggest is that someone leave's the party and swaps to an alt. You invite the alt to the group and everyone except the alt logs off, after everyone has logged off, the alt can reset the instance and everyone can log on. After that all you have to do is re-invite the original party member (who was resetting with their alt)! This is generally the method used, albeit a bit less confusing with less people, by most dungeon farmers. Hope it helps!
---
Are you on a PvP server? If so... the mount.
---
Lol oh noes !
---
A redditor doesn't believe me
---
My life goal is now to prove it it you
---
10/0/41 take clearcasting, permafrost impblizz, shattet, no frostbite, iceblock barrier 1 point in winters chili.
---
Shatter makes u win every pvp encounter and helps with nova flamesteike coc in aoe farm. Impblizz permafrost clearcasting allows u to do all the aoe farming. 
---
Imp cs is nice and all but ur giving up so much in frost tree for it  i wouldnt take it unless you are very focused on pvp
---
F
---
With fap none of those abilities do anything...
---
Strong set, but mage t3 is the bees knees
---
smart! thank you
---
I just don't like the entire set. I would honestly hide the helm if I got it.
---
And not its not other engi items. Just granades.
---
Bump
---
Lvl 34 225 skinning. Should I spend the 5g to get to 300 or save for mount first.

Add guildy

Make them lead

Tell them to reset after we log out

Maraudon might be a special case where you need to walk out and use scepter port. I haven’t tried Maraudon yet.
---
You can start running BRD at 53ish I think, there's not too much for you there but you can get some upgrades and there's a ton of quests which make for good xp, and you can get MC/Onyxia attuned. At 58 though is where I would stop questing, as you can run every dungeon at that level so you may as well level the rest of the way while farming.
---
Im going to make an account and join that server Horde or Ally?
---
Oh lmao, my bad
---
Not sure what it's called but there's an add-on included with the auctioneer suite that does this. Not sure if it's compatible with every add-on out there though.
---
It's a fucking joke that engineering grenades are okay and pots are not. I know that these are the "common" rules for duels but it's fucking stupid. 
---
I'm already at a disadvantage in a duel because I rolled herb/alchy and not engi and now I'm not allowed to use my profession in a duel but he does? What?
---
Thank you, ill look into getting into a new guild.
---
Level up first aid and whenever you see a mage, ask for some bread. Also try to do quests like 1-2 levels below the level you are at, makes questing much easier. Also questie addon if you don't have it already
---
cats and dogs are not ungulates tho
---
Just report and ignore
---
I never said a damn thing about mages aoeing but ok. I swear people just read what they want even when the words aren't even there.
---
Imagine the tank hits a mob once for 100 damage. He now has 100 threat. For the mob to leave him and attack you, you must hit the mob for 110 damage/threat. If you hit the mob for 109 damage, you won't pull aggro, and your threat will be 109% of the tank's aggro.
---
If your meter never displays over 100% for anyone, then everyone is doing crap damage, your tank is a god, the meter sucks, or the meter isn't configured properly.
---
One problem could be that your tank does not have a meter installed, so he isn't communicating his threat to everyone else's meters. I haven't seen this case in over a decade, but old meters would display the aggro target at 100%, the person with highest threat who has a meter at 100%, and then rank everyone else in relation to him.
---
You need the same meter as your tank.
---
was this written by an 8 year old?
---
To be fair that was more the fault of arena than rated pvp in general - rated battlegrounds have a lot more room for class diversity as well as having more skill involved. They should have been the default pvp, not arena.
---
Nah this has been known for quite some time, its not an exploit.
---
Very easy to kill ony when you do it like this :)
---
Sry but noob question: reroll as in create a new toon on a high pop server? Or is there actually a way to change servers?
---
When isn't mages the answer?
---
Yes but its not really good compared to other drops. Shoulders from first boss in DMN is alright.
---
Class balancing? In classic? LMAO!!!!!
---
You can't post Kevin Spacey memes, he is cancelled, remember?!
---
 - Keep your weapons up to date
---
 - Level first aid and bandage freely
---
 - Imp Gouge great for gaining energy back or bandaging
---
 - If you're UD make sure to Cannibalize often
---
 - Riposte is great

I’m taking the same side as you in this argument, not sure how you interpreted my comment
---
He's at character limit, though honestly I don't understand putting shift modifiers in macros and that could be moved. Taunt could just be rebound to the same key plus shift at a different action bar spot.
---
but now you can still report them if you wanted to
---
A macro can't cast more than one spell that invokes the global cooldown. You could use a consequence but that would still require 3 clicks.
---
Not really, no. There's a whole lot of shit in vanilla that's really confusing for someone who has never played MMORPGs before.
---
My dad tried playing WoW back during WOTLK, and despite having a master's in software development, he could barely figure out how to play the game. Sure, he knew how to kill mobs and do quests, but his talents were all fucked up, he was using grey gear at level 25, and hadn't trained many abilities. Was still just spamming Heroic Strike.
---
I'd recommend starting with retail for a little while just to get a feel for the game, then try out vanilla, maybe with a guide on the side to help you out.
---
Goals.
---
Rutheran -&gt; Darkshore -&gt; Boat to Menethil -&gt; run to Ironforge -&gt; Tram to SW

As opposed to fake advertisement?

it has a lot of awesome functions
---
Yep, thanks, I'm pretty short sleep lately.
---
Thank you for reviving me!
---
Its not real vanilla without hunter bots running around killing mobs
---
I'm not an alt I'm just a super slow leveler
---
Literally every class has some beneficial tricks and some drawbacks connected to batching. I don't think it's wise to reduce this conversation to class namecalling
---
Nope. Unless your *opinion* is backed up by facts and credible sources, you are wrong. /s
---
Idk im level 44 on my human warrior and really wanna reroll gnome warrior but feel like I’m gonna get too far behind.
---
I thought it was called a "meeting stone" so you know where to meet your party before you start fighting your way through the pre-instance mobs.
---
Legion was a step in the right direction, then BFA happened...
---
Watch everyone's mana bars during your first few pulls and gauge mana consumption from that. Mobs come in packs; just pull one pack at a time.  
---
You should never have a panic scenario. If you do, your only option is to git gud and hope everyone else knows what they're doing. If you're close to the dungeon entrance, you can pop fear and zone out, otherwise just pop cooldowns, mark targets, and go down swinging.
---
Who dis is?
---
Been playing since tbc and have played on a good amount of *cough* alternative servers and discovered this on my own your pet doesn't regen focus enough intermittently and sometimes it can even feel like your pet gets a mass amount at once. The coding on pets also isn't ideal and so they don't always prio the right thing I've tested it multiple times and 1 or the other has always turned out more dps then both. Sorry I don't have a source, this is just from my experience over 15 or so years
---
People don't understand gear or stats at all. They have a list of what the best gear is and that is all they give a shit about, not understanding why things are on there, what specs are needed, what buffs are assumed etc.
---
Look at rogues... pre raid BiS bracers are Deepfury Bracers, fair enough they're not bad.. but what about the Shadowcraft Bracers? Those are super common and way cheaper. But what's the difference? Four strength. For rogues that means a grand total of **+4 attack power**. That's it. Shadowcraft even gives you a little extra stamina as well (Dead DPS do no DPS).
---
So sure, Deepfury is "better"... but on my server Deepfury bracers are going for 80-150g while Shadowcraft is sitting for 18-25g on the AH. You wanna tell me that 4AP on a blue is worth that kind of gold to you, at this point in the game? Hell no.
---
But idiots don't know *why* those bracers are listed as the best, they just know they are.
---
Try your server subreddit and discord.
---
Yeah I noticed that. All these cutscenes for years have centered around what the Horde is up to, and most of it has been fucking dumb. It kind of reminds me of when the X-Men comics went off the rails back in the late 90s/early 2000s and then basically stayed off the rails for decades. Bad story ideas piling on bad story ideas and no one able or willing to retcon things back to sanity.
---
So you want to post this every day now?
---
That is awesome.
---
If they can use it and it's even remotely better for main or off spec, you give it to them before you shard it. Every time.
---
🧐
---
Right? And it made no fucking sense based on who he was as a character. Shit like that is making me hope they do Classic+ instead of bringing out the expansions, as much as I loved WOTLK.
---
Yep just like daily quests... :p

You should upgrade claw every time you can, it makes a big difference.

Yes, we the ones that take hundreds of hours out of our live to make yours easier are the one that are bad. Not the ones not taking 1 minute to read through the FAQ.
---
Are you really that retarded?
---
Many years from now, i wish i can play video games with my son. If he will be into that
---
In its initial form, it required players to be at the stone to form a group, instead of in a city or roaming doing quests etc. If people did venture over to the stone, they would be waiting well over an hour… to not find a full group to play with.
---
This then became a Queue feature kind of like LFG, and the functionality to "Queue" was added to innkeepers to make it more convenient. This was all scrapped later on in the game's life, but early days(Alpha, Beta) this was how it was.
---
So yes, they was "Meeting stones" but they basically had Retails LFG functionality. 
---
Stop parroting everything you read on Reddit as if it's the truth, do the research first. The world will be a better place for it.
---
This garbage raid just about killed our guild in Wrath. Most of our core quit because it was such a garbage raid. 
---
Cataclysm killed the rest of it, sadly.
---
Well you still do gains, but instead of just increasing a number called "level" on your sheet what you are gaining falls into some broad categories:
---
1) new abilities that diversify your character. When you start you're heavily specialized. Maybe you're good at single target damage, or you're stealthy, or you're good at heavy weapons, or whatever. As you gain abilities you are able to fill more rolls, or even create interesting hybrids and synergies between abilities.
---
2) New gear that gives you new capabilities. Works best when weapons are a side grade OR when weapons can be customized to excel at certain things. Especially good if you have a robust crafting system and resources. Warframe is like this.
---
3) Cosmetic upgrades. This is a vital part. As you continue on, making your character look cooler is a really important part of the game.
---
4) (optional) point buy progression. Instead of leveling and having your stats, health, energy go up you spend points that you earn on various things. Think GURPs from classic rpgs, or Skyrim from something more recent (even though Skyrim also has a leveling system).
---
In addition to those things, what keeps people playing is exploring, crafting, finding new fashion items. There are also a lot of systems that most rpgs have only touched on like base construction/defense (though WOW kind of added that, my limited experience with it was that it sucked).
---
Doing away with leveling has some social benefits too. Having new players grouping with experienced players without that being a penalty to the older players means better, less toxic communities (warframe is very good about this). It also lets your friends play less than you or join way after you and immediately start playing with your existing characters (City of Heroes had a great take on this with Sidekicking, where  you could temporarily boost the level of a person in the group to one level below your own, thus making them powerful enough to join you in high level content, though they wouldn't have access to all the abilities of a high level player).
---
There's a lot of ways to do it, but it would require someone to have the guts to move away from the EQ/WOW model and try something radically different. Most MMOs don't have the guts to try it (look at what happened with Star Wars Galaxies, which ended up being a reskinned WOW when I tried it years ago).
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccastbars
---
if you want to kill something quickly in dungeon groups or even while leveling, multi-shot will be part of your single and multi-target rotation.
---
T3 Warrior &gt; T2 Rogue.  
---
T2 Rogue has been used too much on retail. I dont like it anymore.
---
Warriors..
---
strongly disagree, I played WoW expansions on a PvP realm until flying was introduced and then unsubscribed.
---
The rep grind half way through the expansion to unlock flying is to please the people who desperately want flying. The locking flying away for the first half of the expansion is to desperately please people like me, who don't have fun when flying is there.
---
i don't know how many people like me are left though, certainly a lot less after their recent changes to how PvP works.
---
I agree with your overall point that retail is designed to keep you on the treadmill, but the locking flying away behind a grind I don't think is purely for treadmill purposes
---
Level 33 horde warrior looking for good spots to farm gold/silver for my mount
---
It wasn't changed. He's stupid because nothing changed.
---
this guys right stop harassing him everyone
---
yeah I'm a healer and I'm usually looking for tribs. Mana pots are a part of that, but I also still need the healing gloves from King Gordok.
---
It's not a taunt like a warrior's taunt. An actual taunt equalizes threat to whoever currently has the highest threat plus some. Torment just deals "high threat." Like searing pain isn't a taunt, just deals higher threat. Same with mind blast.
---
If it was an actual taunt your voidwalker would never lose aggro, and as a warlock player, that definitely is not the case hehe.
---
Me seeing my dad online playing WoW when he’s supposed to be out getting cigarettes

You're rambling. You hover over them and they literally say "meeting stone". Not "summoning stone".

---
I started as a UD warlock. Got to 46 hated the class, so I rerolled. Made a UD rogue, wasn't feeling it, so I made a druid. Loved it and got almost to 51 and I made a orc rogue yesterday and am at lvl 10. 
---
  I will be maining the druid and orc rogue. 
---
 It's never too late to reroll. Plus if your on the same server you can mail your alt bags and gold and green starting gear.
---
&gt; Is the down ranking worth it without good healer gear?
---
YES.
---
I'm not sure you understand what downranking is for. It's not about throughput, it's about efficiency. If you're single target healing massive damage, sure, you just want to pump as much HPS as possible. If you're raid healing smaller chunks here and there, what you want is to heal what needs to be healed as efficiently as possible.
---
If you have two heals, one heals around 300 the other heals around 600, and a bunch of people are all at around -300/-400, you use the downranked version to heal up rather than overhealing.
---
As a healer, do yourself a favour and find some customizable unit frames and figure out how to display missing HP. You can display both (i.e current HP + missing in a format that looks like "2578 -657") or just display missing only. This is the information you want as a healer and will help you choose the appropriate spell for the situation.
---
Player choice is a really vague term though because the reason they took away the old talent trees was a lack of choice - people used cookie cutter builds and called it a day. The new ones are worth switching every once in a while so arguably there's more choice there.
---
Leveling toons during and after Legion is basically chaining dungeons, doing a clear; and going back into the queue.  You can pretty much do that until max level.  I wasn’t interacting with people, and any blue items I got usually didn’t match my numerous heirlooms.  Never even left Orgrimmar, and suddenly I am the class hall’s chosen hero.
---
Personally, I like being a random member of the Horde.  And I like interacting with people and working together.  Retail is lonely.
---
bad opinion
---
You take hundreds of hours out of your lives to wank your own egos off, nothing else. Go powertrip somewhere else loser, I dont engage with unpaid internet janitors for longer than I need to.

Deathcoil the second you get done being stunlocked, followed by fear. Dot and repeat fear . Also you should Succubus seduce when you get jumped if you can.
---
forgot how many classic wow noobs are playing this game now trying to question the clearly established (for good reason) status quo
---
Yeah Wrath launch was to me, peak WoW. By the time it ended though... yeah. Argent Tournament, the token system, daily quests, cross server LFG. Everything about it was heavily steering WoW away from being this massive world and towards being a multiplayer game with a really big lobby. Such a crucial difference that really spelled out the end for me.
---
I leveled in Cata, quit. Leveled in Mists, quit. Tried leveling in whatever came next and just couldn't get myself past 92. Logged out, done for good. Honest to god felt like I was playing on rails.
---
I logged in to retail the other day and everything about it seems so unappealing to me it's ridiculous.
---
I've been playing wow off and on with my dad for 12 years. I was in middle school when we started.
---
This was honestly a very painful video to look at. All of it.
---
When you try your best but you dont succeeeeeddddd.....
---
I play mage so these ppl saying 1g port tip is standard are ridiculous.
---
If someone is 60 and they offer a gold, I'll take it. I charge 50s though and if someone is sub 40 I charge the time cost (20s)
---
For food and water, I do 6x stacks for 1g, mix and match how you please. All 6 stacks of water or 3/3 or 4/2 idc, but it would be 3g+ from a vendor so 1g is fair imo
---
Breaks rule 3, so no.
---
everyone goes engi though.  it’s not optional unless you’re trying to be bad
---
shoulda just said that you want to throw it in your bank for when the dungeon2 set quests are released later.

You arent staff. But thanks for proving my point about your ego :)

Why are you so angry? You should really be following the rules of this subreddit.

Ask him what he likes to do in most games. 
---
I’m always partial to the more active classes being more fun. Mage, warrior (in dungeons, questing blows), Druid, rogue. 
---
If he’s a pet type person then that’s a good thing too.

You're god damn right I would've. That's a great idea to add to any game

It honestly to me was just them being to much into giving players what they wanted. (Besides the story)

You got to level 40 without poison?  Are you asking about [Mission: Possible But Not Probable](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2478/mission-possible-but-not-probable)?  Or the one that starts the chain: [The Shattered Salute](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=2460/the-shattered-salute)?
---
Actually it got removed as I forgot to put a Flair. lmao
---
ulduar and nax 40 are peal wow to me.
---
nax was just brutal and felt so fucking good after months of wiping to finish it and ulduar was probably the best in terms of fight mechanics and did the hard mode type stuff perfectly
---
ok, thanks everyone for some suggestions I will keep looking too.  I just want to make sure I get this all correct.

the reason you don’t use pots is because then you’re dueling outside org in durotar for an hour and it costs you and everyone else 60g. for literally no reason because if both people are potting it costs everyone the same and no one gets an advantage. is that simple enough for you to understand?

Only big difference is +healing tends to be a bigger number since +healing/damage is more “valuable.”

I hate the guy who goes afk right as soon as everyone finally gets there.  Slightly behind it is people LFG who are on the opposite side of the wrong continent of the dungeon.
---
From my personal experience with dungeon tanking the more important set of points are the 8 in Festo.  Unless i have a bunch of raged pooled (which i usually don't, things die too fast and i have to use all my rage to keep up with pulls), I start by shifting to bear into Farie Fire.  Improved enrage will allow you to hit swipe three or four times in quick succession on mobs. At that point you can tab maul targets for better threat.
---
Swipe isn't the greatest source of threat, but really what you want it to do is hold aoe aggro, which in the right conditions it can and use taunt on the main target if it gets pulled.  And yes swipe is going to generate rage better because it has 3 times the chance of crit and can be spammed unlike maul which is slow.
---
If you are aoe tanking maul isn't necessarily your first in attack anyway you focus on corralling the herd with demo roar, swipe and then use taunt if the main target pulls aggro, even if it does, one mob on your dps while the rest of the mob is contained is better than a mob hitting your healer.
---
If its single target just the act of shifting gives you your initial maul and you can shift again and make another 10 rage with Furor.  And if its a really important one target pull, just wait for enrage to be off cooldown.   Or if you know you're going to need enrage on the next pull maybe don't use it on the preceding one (its usually up every other pull depending on clear speed).
---
Also remember that having a ton of crit that turns into rage gets better at end game because before that you keep replacing gear. 
---
 None of that gear out scales its level, it gets further behind.  Once you get to 60 your gear gets more powerful over time not less which means more crit and more rage.
---
TLDR quickshift  out and into bearform makes 10 rage (15 if you have wolfshead helm on).  Enrage is your friend and improved enrage is really good for initial aggro.
---
Why’d you sheep him?? You healed him from like half life! And dropped combat so he can charge you! You totally got this next match man!

Fairly sure spamming hamstring (to proc wf amd flurry) is more reliable than slam.

Why’s that?

Slam isnt used to proc wf its just a rage dump over HS because more damage and you can spec into low cast
---
Is it a PvE server? If so you can just roll the alliance toon yourself and get it. Just need a friend to buy it off you on the neutral AH
---
Agreed, but I was purely speaking in terms of dps rather than impracticality. At higher dps windfury will lead to an overall greater output, but at lower dps rockbiter will outperform it.

I play a ton of alts at lower levels. I joined each one in a separate guild to find a good match and have since moved everyone into one guild.

Yeah sit on his dick, that'll teach him
---
Cool, now I want to make a gnome...
---
i’m commenting on your weak ass play not slinging desperate and unfounded personal attacks. Sad!
---
That was my feeling.
---
"I beat Deathwing on heroic difficulty" just doesn't feel as good as "I beat Deathwing!".

That doesn’t work anymore. You get xp based on how much damage you did to the target. So if you tag and a 60 kills you get like 2 exp
---
Classic World of Warcraft
---
Not Warcraft.
---
Two entirely different games.
---
Yea your definitely right. Saves us a ton of money and time in the long run, only big difference for me is that  it’s perishable on log out. If it wasn’t then I would def even pay more.
---
They *have* said so publicly, back when they wanted to not include it at all in Draenor then later caved to the whiners.

This right here.

Well that's not very "nice" of you

this is a great comment, it made me laugh

whoa there Nietszche you got me there.

It does though

He’s not your friend, buddy

EXACTLY! 
---
"Classic"   World of Warcraft
---
I was making fun, because WoW is much too new to be "classic".
---
I was commenting the classic should refer to you know, classic warcraft.
---
thats actually a very vanilla wow thing to do.
---
yup...
---
After looking at your post/comment history you’ve been downvoted into oblivion. Trolls will be trolls!
---
Hope you get the help you clearly need, perhaps a therapist? If you can’t afford one that’s too bad, so sad
---
I wish i knew my dad
---
Even if you don't have enough by 40, it will net you faster gold to level overall and by like 43 you should be fine
---
No.  Classic Wow refers to the re release of World of Warcraft.
---
Retail WoW is a worse diablo 3.  It’s just grinding, hoping the same gear with ideal stats drops.  While classic has the grinding aspect, the community depth is what separates them.
---
When a mage polymorphs mid-duel, their opponent recovers health but not mana. If the mage eats/drinks after polymorphing, the mage can recover both health and mana while their opponent only recovers health. Do this a couple times and you can starve your opponent of mana completely.
---
Classic is amazing but it is not without its flaws my dudes.. and they are very hard problems to solve.
---
I guess they tried to solve too many things and ended up fundamentally changing the game
---
I noticed the majority of warriors are looking for groups as DPS instead of tank lately.
---
You got lucky lol. I’m at least 40 runs throughout DM and haven’t seen one
---
valor is pretty good for pvp. People need to realize if warriors followed a BIS list they would be running around with no stamina glass cannons in mail/leather gear.
---
Captain?
---
We can share whatever we want. I heard putin is playing on zandalar eu.
---
I think what everyone is trying to say is to simply boot someone @ the end of an instance after they did the entire dungeon with you simply because they did not find his constant chatter funny is a shit thing to do.
---
Thanks for all your answers, really appreciate the feedback!
---
I'm well aware.
---
lol nah.
---
U dont have to be sorry. Just understand the fact that while it may be a special moment for you, it is not for the rest of the subreddit. People have these moments every time and i get that it is good meeting people you enjoy playing with. But it has no significance for the rest of us. Hundreds of thousands do SM every day. And they dont post about it. Just cheris the memory and get lots more of the same kind.
---
Thats still a form of leveling though, its just you wouldn't have a character level.
---

I am sorry, i have never really used reddit that much and was not aware not to make these type of posts and was a bit excited about completing this dungeon for the first time. I apologise and will refrain from making such posts in the future :)

Source, and i can add it to my post

I wonder, what games will be out 10+yeats from now. My son soon will turn 1. Untill his gaming time its long long wait.
---
It's the Cadaverous Chest from Scholo. Hence the leather.
---
How do you re-release something that is soooo current millennium? 
---
Its like saying, lets bring black the classic 2000's WS6 Transam or the classic Tesla roadster.
---
Its ok man, I didnt go looking for this sub, it just kinda passed my feed, and laughed at the word "classic" in front of WoW. At this point we are both wasting bandwidth, mostly me though.
---
Pity sex
---
Have you asked why ,
---
what year is it?
---
alright? i’m not too concerned about what the brain dead hive mind on here thinks of my posts. triggered your ass enough to scout through my post history though that says something about you. imagine caring about the upvotes and downvotes your posts get. yikes.

I’ve been getting the samw invites from the same guy. Reported, ignored and logged out. Time to sleep, a man can’t even fish in peace.

Great question, I have been lasher farming for the past couple of days, along with herb gathering, and have yet to see one.
---
For some reason this addon tracks shield and stuff but won't track my dots. Any idea?
---
This guy is warchief material right here.
---
You re-release it by rolling back 15 years of changes.
---
:(
---
Try SexyMap for some cool mini map frames.

 Sometimes with action bar addons you can find an option to turn off button text which might be worth looking around for if you don't like the font.

Been enjoying your guides, keep it up.

Classic Superman quote.
---
Then wtf are you saying about movies?
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
Imagine being a troll with anger issues lol bye Felicia
---
Classic.
---
Thanks will do
---
It was more of a rhetorical question, as in "its too new to re-release". Like a reboot of Spider-Man 3 fucking times shm lol.
---
Sssssssssssssssssssssssssssmokin!

Me seeing a post get shut down due to snowflakes getting butthurt about a mentally unstable climate activist.

You're getting swarmed by reddit idiots right now, but you're right. People should be pulling info from current release classic, not their pserver theorycrafting or 15 year old database scrapes.

I have macro that does just /sit, then I move to stand right when the mob its attacking. It is all timing. No fancy macro

Whoops sorry misread.
---
Played a few months in from WotLK into Cata, so never really did retail. Classic has been a completely new game for me in my opinion. I'll be sticking around as long as I can play enough to justify the pay. Been having a blast just leveling super slow.
---
Don’t re roll. If it’s high pop that should have plenty of raiding guilds etc going. Contact some other guilds that might be raiding already and see if they can spare a spot (even if you agree to not take loot from guild members)
---
Lol I was tanking Maraudon yesterday and we had a dps Warrior that would pop Blood Fury and then taunt a Primordial Behemoth off me so he could pop Berserker Rage for more dps :/
---
Check both auction houses, people on your faction may be selling them as well.

Thank you!

i like retail a lot for what it is. Personally, classic is a great game, an amazing adventure and world and community, but I play retail for PvP and high end raiding instead of classic because in classic PvP is determined by whether you have the time to grind raids every week or not - in retail, being much more casual friendly, it is easier to catchup in terms of gear.
---
Also, the pvp and pve in BFA requires more focus and mechanical attention which I find more enjoyable than classic.
---
We got here because 2 different communities want 2 different games, and that is okay.
---
I just dislike the unnecessary shitting on BFA. yes its over commodified - as a communist im strongly aware of this. But in terms of gameplay the two games are vastly different and appeal to different audiences. Let's let it be.

1. You will need Shadowforge Key 
---
2. Enchant boots with minor speed increase 
---
3. Mages use Dampen Magic   
---
You can continue to Warder Stilgiss, You will need: 
---
1. 1 lesser invisibility potion 
---
2. 1 invisibility potion 
---
3. 2 Greater frost protection potion (maybe 1)
---
1. In an MMO, I think players being heavily specialized is necessary to its success.   The fact that a player can't excel at most things creates a need to play with others.  If players cant be good at everything there becomes less of a need to group with others.
---
2. Eventually there comes a time where players get all the gear they need, and devs need to add more gear to keep people playing.  This means the old gear and the content that goes with it becomes irrelevant which is the main problem to begin with.
---
3. I feel like WoW already has this (specifically classic).  As a low level you look like a total noob but the more you level and progress, the cooler you look, ultimately ending with raid gear looking the coolest.
---
4. This is pretty much the same thing as leveling, eventually players will have spent all the "points" they can get which is equivalent to a level cap.  Unless you want to go with an unlimited progression system which isn't good imo.
---
I just think to do away with leveling is to do away with progression entirely.  RPG elements like leveling is what makes MMOs so fun
---
absolutely dip into holy for consecration, but dont go farther. You'll be able to hold threat for your mage friend and be able to tank dungeons better.
---
Even if you go prot you'll be fine on your own, its just annoyingly slow
---
Agreed.  Not only was the tourney a problem but by halfway through wrath, AOE dungeon speed runs were a thing.  And casting classes had practically infinite magic which made healing all about spamming spells as fast as possible instead of mana management and tactical triage.
---
Possible you were looking at the wrong class' trink?
---
Yeah dwarfs living in cities unlike the hulks and their mudhuts.
---
Tony Hawk Pro Skater
---
t is between 5 and 6 on the number bar, both of which are commonly used. its easy to reach. if you rebind a and d to strafe you can just keep your fingers on the top 3 rows and have like 25+ bindings if you double bind with shift, easily enough for me as a rogue
---
Yes... I was in the same boat. You won't look back.
---
Just check your neutral AH. Many pvp servers folks sell companions at a markup there.

GTA III and Vice City

Some one asked this yesterday and was suggested Sentinels Idk my self but maybe?
---
Tips on leveling for 37-44?
---
Demo shout was bugged and was scaling up the amount of threat it caused with the amount of enemies it hit.
---
Battle Shout and heals were splitting aggro across all enemies but that was fixed to work in line with the 1.12 client
---
IMO Tribal. You're able to make the two BiS devilsaur items.
---
Wrath was really popular, but by the end of Wrath I was so burned out on the game that I never wanted to touch it again and still haven't played retail since. At some point during Wrath was the tipping point for me personally.
---
Na they nerfed it.
---
No luck
---
Ah okay, appreciate it.
---
yea but considering gehennas is top3 biggest eu server and firemaw has 5000, 500 is very little.
---
The addon bis tracker is pretty useful for a general idea but it has quite a bit of false information. Like as an example for priests it tells you the pre-raid bis gloves are a sunken temple blue with “of healing” on it, when Gloves of the Exalted Herald exist.
---
What's the quickest way to get gold for a mount? i'm playing mage and currently lvl 37 with 37g
---
By negative values. Use CSC over DHC. Not only will you clip your shots less with the crossbow and do more damage overall, you won't have that god-awful proc ruining your scatters.
---
I did. That's why I'm asking if someone can put one up. They're weren't any over the last week.
---
A few times in vanilla I had a bug where I had ultra-fast mana regen. It was amazing. You could just spam anything without worrying. Went away when you zoned or died though.
---
For sure I'll just level, thanks man.
---
Whew must be nice to be a mage guess I’ll stick to competing for herbs Q_Q
---
The entire BiS list concept has been little more than an excuse for people to be assholes or get in asinine nerd arguments over nothing.
---
Unless you've got a fucking vending machine handing out specific items, people get what they get in a random fashion. You could run a million dungeons and not get whatever ring or dagger some wowhead list tells you is mathematically optimal for wtfever.
---
But nobody takes deadliness...
---
No one has gotten it yet btw.
---
Great influence on your children
---
..
---
Then be sure to post it to reddit.
---
Retail isn't perfect but neither is Classic.  There are good parts about both, but it's hard to compare the 2 because to me, they cater to 2 different audiences.
---
I knew about the elite guards but wasn't aware they could just be picked up! Too bad my little Human Warrior is only 35 😞
---
Ambushing, mostly.
---
Can you colour in the areas where I get the fuck ganked out of me?  Like, the whole map?
---
Pvp spec?
---
Been waiting for SP to drop MLNW PT:2 since classic came out. Have been very disappointed.
---
He himself said that so I was mocking him
---
I see, thank you (: So it definitely isnt worth spending 400 gold on?
---
yes! he is a great influence :)

Stable your pet, and tame one that has the spell you want, use the new pet untill you learn the spell you want. Then abandon and go teach it to your pet.

To make you waste your time. You're right

Lol only sorry assuming it was a stupid question, but I sincerely just don't know what it's referencing.
---
Arenas have never been very popular, but they have been *way* more popular than Rated BGs.
---
Rated BGs never even had enough of a population for good matchmaking.
---
&gt; trying to not take items thinking we'll reward them with bigger items 
---
because you will, unless your council is retarded you will 100% do this. rewarding a guy with 2  same slot raid items when people in there have 0  is not going to happen unless there is some shady shit going on
---
Are people stupid for asking questions? 
---
Get your head out of your ass.
---
These idiots swarm on any post about pvp with the same shit. Their brains function on the level of chatbots and they just respond to keywords with the same set of 5-6 responses. No reason to bother engaging with them they're not smart enough to understand what you're saying. These are the same guys who are losers IRL, only ever feel power over anything when they're ganking people who can't fight back, and if they somehow get a date with a real woman they call her "mom" on the first date and then get on redpill to whine about what a bitch she was.
---
BC Sunwell patch was pretty damn good, too.
---
That list is for reading gear. It sacrifices everything for dps. You need a separate set to be out in the world
---
SM Cath is a good bet if you can reliably find groups and you don’t feel like questing
---
I wish my dad would do anything besides pray before dinner that we should come over and see them more often and then sit down and look at facebook all night, let alone actually play a game or take any interest in what might interest me. Looks like to me you have a pretty decent problem on your hands as far as problems go lol.
---
Yeah and they get malice as well so this test is futile. A rogue will never have to pick between deadliness or malice.
---
laughed my ass off tbhe entire time and now have a nighttime activity to do on my rogue
---
i think me and my 4.0 gpa are fine :) thanks for your concern though!
---
bite, average damage 90, 10 second cd. 9 dps.
---
claw, average damage 51, effective cd due to focus regen 2secs, 25.5 dps
---
I would like to see your numbers
---
The forgotten coast
---
Yah good point
---
paladins
---
There are a few spots you can earn good gold per hour- anywhere with melee only humanoids (plenty of mage farming spots you can find by googling it). Rock elementals in badlands or arathi is good.
---
Honestly though you shouldn't worry about it. You make so much more gold at higher levels, the fastest way to make gold is to just level as quickly as you can. You might not have 100g for your mount at 40, but you'll get more money in less playtime for your epic mount and gear and stuff
---
it's the best playing with my dad. at first I resented the game just because he liked it, but now I'm more addicted than him lol.

---
So you think it's a good idea to create a problem to allow the problem to be fixed?  If I don't see their advertisement it's not an issue I need to report in the first place.
---
I could flip that on you. 
---
You said that most people *didn’t* feel that way. Could you cite your sources? 
---
Of course not. There is no source. 
---
I could tell you that on retail many players are unhappy with class balance. But since I don’t have a universal poll of all WoW players, you’ll handwave away anything that doesn’t fit your narrative. 
---
If you disagree with me, that’s fine. But you don’t have an argument, so you’re just saying ‘well we can’t know for sure so you’re wrong.’
---
yea, I'm really grateful for him and WoW for making our relationship closer. I hope things with your father get better.

Now this is the content I came for !

To be fair vendor water doesn't disappear when you log out

Time for an alt.
---
Most people here play Horde so you won’t get an unbiased answer.
---
The fact is that yes, Horde is heavily favored in a lot of aspects of the game. It’s ridiculous. Alliance has the edge on PvE but that’s it.
---
WotF and Hardiness are beyond stupid. Having SM, RFK, RFD inside your own territory is beyond stupid. Havind DM right next to your FP while Alliance has to swim in beyond stupid. Having easy FPs all across Azeroth is beyond stupid. Having zeppelins outside Org while Alliance has to go do the journey to Wetlands and STV is beyond stupid.
---
Just wait until TBC, when Horde has the upper hand in literally every aspect of the game...
---
54/55 logical?
---
Put him on ignore and move on. People like that are not worth raiding with.
---
Game has evolved. If they tried to keep vanilla as it was online for 15 years, WoW would be dead in the water by now. It is what it is.
---
I have it on fairbanks
---
just did it! was slow but easy and steady
---
The only reason they'd regret it is because it wastes more of the player's time not having flying which means more sub money for Blizzard.
---
Hey man I started playing Mario at 2. You’d be surprised

Fury warrior - aka being rogue curious.
---
Yup I help people regularly hoping they pay it forward.
---
Prove it
---
We actually mind control-heal kited him to AQ40 once. He deserved to see the world.
---
PvE gear gets chewed up pretty easily by the PvP set, though. When doing the rank grind in vanilla it was very easy to outplay raiders in even the blue PvP set; my rogue at rank10 had as much stamina as a lot of fury warriors. Raid-geared premades only really became a problem when in the tier2.5/tier3 sets. Nobody in a bunch of mixed tier1 and 'pre-BiS' gear is going to trouble someone climbing towards the PvP set.
---
My main is a mage, been considering rolling a tank alt since tanks are in pretty high demand. I don't really want to play a warrior, once I get to the higher levels will I be taken seriously as a tank if I pick a different class (druid/paladin/etc.)? Or will I just end up tanking for PUGs while leveling and then being stuck as a DPS when I hit 60?
---
&gt; There are a lot of wannabe tryhards who think BiS items are the only items that matter. They're too dumb to see otherwise and are really insucure as a result.
---
Fucking truth.  Much as I'd love to have Truestrike shoulders, I've reached hit cap without them.  At this point I'll take anything that's an upgrade over ZF pauldrons.
---
Haha that is rich
---
Unfortunately, not all servers have a discord, or at least an active one :(

Why you wearing a ring on your head??

&gt;In October 2017, Spacey came out as gay when he apologized to Rapp for the alleged sexual advance in 1986. Spacey said, "I have had relationships with both men and women. I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man."[82][83] His decision to come out via his statement was criticized by prominent members of the gay community, including Billy Eichner, George Takei, and Wanda Sykes, as an attempt to change the subject and shift focus from Rapp's accusation, for using his own drunkenness as an excuse for making sexual advances to a minor, and for implying a connection between being gay and sexually assaulting a minor.
---
Excellent post thank u for sharing your valuable insight.
---
"If it's an upgrade, go for it."
---
This right here is what those tryhards need to learn.
---
Sure that’s why
---
I just tossed you a DM!
---
For tribute runs in DM North, does that engineering schematic (major recombobulator) count as a blue?
---
We did a full tribute run but only got 2 blues.  Our whole party was sitting there scratching our hears to figure out what we did wrong.  However, looking back, we got 3 greens (including the schematic) when normally you only get 2.
---
Better than what you had? Good enough reason to roll on it.
---
I gotta get me a charm!
---
I respecced at level 58. I had no issues healing as shadow and could have probably continued until 60 but I started healing raids.
---
Can do on a paladin. Couple days ago had some really nice recipe and pattern drops over the course of a 4 hour farming session netting approximately 400g. I repeat, paladins can do this and I highly suggest it. Just takes a little more gear.
---
Is that the level next to their name? How do you do that
---
&gt; A lot of the pre-BiS min-maxers are going to be very upset in phase2/3 when PvP becomes a big thing.
---
I'm not going to run 1000 WSGs.  The BiS list is absolutely a guideline and not a hard requirement.
---
I've had this happen to me once but I caught it. Won a roll for a green and chat showed I won it and I moved on. A couple minutes later I look in my bag for it and it was nowhere to be found. Double checked chat and it never showed it being looted. Ran back to the body and there it was unlooted. Same as you my bags were not full, and I was definitely in the dungeon and close to the dead body. Seems like there's a bug where it will sometimes not loot you the item.
---
Holy crap, this is awesome! If you end up doing more, please post them here. Really high quality.
---
Yeah, I was just baffled and amused by the fact that I ended up on an ignore list after an interaction like that. One of the most curious random chat interactions I've had in this game so far.
---
I think its because they made the game so easy and convenient to play that nobody needs to talk to anyone or trade anymore. Why quest when you can get good loot and get teleported to the dungeon entrance, not to mention the dungeons for the most part have no challenge either.
---
Stopped playing retail after wotlk. Never came back and I’m happy about it
---
Sure.  Dps spec kills things faster.  Great to hear.
---
Don't care. 
---
I'm not blazing along.  I'm 42 and that's okay.  I don't use questie, I don't use profession add-ons, I use wow head as a sanity check to ensure I'm killing the right things, I'm not the 'optimal' player.
---
I am playing for my entertainment and I view the leveling process as an extension of it.  Why would I use a spec I don't enjoy in a playstyle I'm not going to find fun.
---
So far, I can still kill things and Choo-Choo between them due to spirit tap
---
Oldschoolcool :)
---
Nah, the person acusing him was killed, that makes him innocent again now.
---
Better than I thought.
---
The main flaw is very easily explainable. In retail there are many ways to a goal but there is also a pretty clear best way. And that is doing your dailies. Do your random dungeon etc. To get points. 
---
The problem with this is. The dungeons are made to be less difficult than the loot they provide. The problem with this is, you outgear all the dungeons within 2 days of reaching max level. The reason you run the dungeon is not for their loot. It is for the daylie reward. A reward that is a lot better than whatever the dungeon would give you.
---
So you are essentially farming a time gate. Nothing more nothing less. You cant farm the dungeon more to get your item faster. All you can do is to do it every day until you have it.
---
Meanwhile in classic. I'm searching for specific drops from specific bosses. I dont wait for the game to give me points. I run the dungeon until it gives me what I want. 
---
In retail, an item like HoJ would be just as expensive as any other item and you would purchase it with points. In classic you farm that BRD until your eyes bleed.
---
Also the difference of stuff to do in the overworld. More farming for rare ressources and stuff.
---
I subbed like 2 weeks before classic wow released and tried retail. I don't think I even made it out of the starting zone.
---
Yeah but this is absolutely a bug lol
---
I will always contend the biggest downfall of wow was cross realm and everything that came with it. I include LFD in that, even though I loved Wrath that had a massive impact. 
---
Once Cross realm hit the server community died. You met people you would never meet again. You could sit in Dal and just que endless dungeons without leaving Dal. Dungeons were fast AOE spams, I had fun but they were not hard. Those things really hit the server community, but we didn’t realize how bad it would soon be. 
---
Once you could see people from other servers it all fell apart. You saw all these people, but had no reason to interact with any of them. You also had no desire because you would not see them again. LFR destroyed the raid scene and made guilds pointless because you could solo que and see all the content. 
---
Now you can cross realm arena teams, my god. In retail I literally sat in Dazawhoevercares and spammed arena. Never left, never talked to anyone. Basically just spammed a lobby game. Never explored, no profs, didn’t bother to make friends. Just play arena and got disappointed by my chest every week. 
---
Many things have gone wrong, but cross realm I will always contend literally destroyed the very essence of wow.
---
Gruken?
---
Stockades is pretty worthless, deadmines I'll give it that it's a great dungeon for gear and it's really really out of the way for horde to get to it, but Gnomer? Horde accesses it just as easily as alliance do. There's a quest in Orgrimmar, you meet some Goblin in booty bay and he gives you a transponder, you can teleport directly to Gnomeregan through that Booty Bay thing. Ratchet is right beside orgrimmar and there's a boat to booty bay.
---
Looks like I won't have as much time to play as I thought, so I'm looking for a good solo class to play. I'm not as interested in Warlock, so I've narrowed it down to Druid and Hunter. Which should I play?
---
RNGesus curses some and blesses others
---
If you play paladin, you'll be able to tank to at least BRD just fine. I personally (as a mage) prefer having a druid or warrior tank for higher content (55+ dungeons). You'll be a great healer though if you want to do raids or dungeons at end game.
---
Bears can tank fine, though not MT for raids, but you can do a lot with druids and they are fun to level. 
---
I actually leveled a paladin tank to 41, and stopped playing it in favor of leveling my mage and now a druid tank- the paladin is going holy.
---
Many people dont remember because almost nobody played it. I have never seen sunwell in my life.
---
Just got my whirlwind axe on my Orc att lvl 30, grinding a warrior is though but damn i've missed the simple rewards of looking like a dangerous colourful axe wielding fruit.
---
It's true that the mageblade isn't going to go to the person with the sorc dagger, but it's also not going to the loot whore who tried to pass on sorc dagger specifically to get mageblade.
---
That hat really is the cherry on top. Nice fit!
---
Ah, gotcha. Still though, I'm just baffled by the fact that someone puts you on their ignore list for an interaction like that. It doesn't make any logical sense and I just found it funny.
---
I had taken a break from retail for a few months until classic came out, now I’m back to playing retail again with some classic on the side
---
Hunter if being solo is your main worry.
---
Druid. Go feral. Self heals, ability to root, able to stealth to sneak around for quests, ability to find a dungeon group very easily when &lt; lvl 40 since you can tank or dps or do a mediocre job healing. Also, pretty fun to play
---
if im being honest raiding in classic has made me miss raiding on retail. they don't compare.
---
if you took classic and keep everything the same and when you zoned into mc it was more like a mythic raid, it would be the perfect game in my opinion.
---
I believe the main reason was to get long travel times away as this was a common complaint. I ca understand it. It takes ages to get to the majority of locations. Especially as alliance. Try going strath as alliance. You will fly for 10-15 minutes.
---
I'm a little ninja short and stout, I'll pop your loot and hearthstone out. When you start a cryin' I'll log out. I'm the rogue with full devout.
---
so if a 11 y/o kid spends his holidays killing a mob because he was lied to is ok? this is a matter of ethics so there is no right answer, only widely accepted/contested and time isn't something considered too often so i'm understanding the lashback now. thanks.

* Daily quests, originally provided to help us pay our repair bills at max level, somehow became the game's primary content.
---
* Cross-server dungeon and raid finder hurt the natural formation of guilds based on people's positive social interactions with each other.

* Getting gear is far less rewarding when every raid tier gets a catch-up mechanic handing out the quality of the previous tier to everyone for free, because of the item level gap created by all the different difficulty settings.
---
* Class fantasy has been watered down, buffs have been homogenized and unique weird class abilities removed for the sake of simplicity. BFA doesn't even have class armor anymore. 
---
* Encounters have to be made overly complicated because there are no more interesting decisions to be made in regards to resource management in combat. Tanks aren't managing threat and healers aren't managing mana. 
---
* This is temporary, but classic feels good right now because you're playing the whole game with everyone else, and not just the most recent patch of the game like you do in retail.
---
What is this book?
---
not really :)
---
As someone who was not interested in warlock at all i would Tell you to give it a try! It's real fun and there are many different leveling and late game build . 
---
If not then yeah druid I would say is the way to go if you don't have much time since you can play all role one one character and have ton of utility.
---
This is the perfect scenario. Classic is easy which is good in this case. Fury tanks are the best. If the healer is a fresh 60 you throw on a shield otherwise it's game on. Throw on the dual wield or 2H and take the dungeon to pound town.
---
Retail was in an mmo.
---
Classic is an mmo rpg. 
---
The rpg part of the game gives players a sense of progression. Otherwise, you might as well just give everyone the his gear and throw them right into the last boss.
---
Maybe he thought bc you can get WW axe? Either way the point is moot. It’s a bit upgrade for you and you have every right to need.
---
foror dragonslaying
---
quel'serrar tbh is not that good but its for sure better than blue weapons especially for humans
---
Yes. So once it’s broken rogues can vanish. Do you shouldn’t do it to rogues. Hunters would be the same
---
They started changing the game for the people who didn't want to play the game.
---
Sentinels is highly active because pretty everyone in the guild has invite permission. While this means they have an absolute ton of members, it also means there are certain disadvantages from having no restrictions on who can join. Might want to check how much rp they are actually involved in first.
---
And so it begins..
---
You always use poisons no matter what. 
---
In pve and questing you use instant poison. In pvp you use crippling poison.
---
Starting to collect my gear for a 19 priest.

Can’t see myself going trough the hassle of getting the arena grab master or the furbolg medicine pound but I’m picking up the BoEs I need when I can.

If I remember the sacred texts correctly, even if the guards whoop you like that you lose no durability.  
---
A real asshole MC's you into lava but dips before you die.  Such as the " shadowmeld + otherside of the chain -&gt; MC jump into lava trick" thousands of years ago stealth only broke upon completion of the task and that made night elf priests potentially fun in PvP despite stupid ass racials.
---
Good times.
---
Deadly poison isn’t used at all?
---
While playing peggle
---
Poggle
---
r/TotallyNotNightelves
---
Crippling and Mind numbing is pvp (tho there are encounters where they might come in handy in dungeons but its situational) 
---
Instant is for raids and dungeons
---
Deadly cant be used in raids since it takes a debuff slot it also will break your gouge and blind. Also, for Deadly to be worth it you need to let it stack full and stay full. But mons and Bosses dies to fast. Personally wouldnt recommend them at all. 
---
This is my opinion and how i do. Someone else maybe has a better answer
---
I use deadly in instances sometimes.  not in raids because of the debuff limit
---
Funny, we raided xroads (and org, but unsuccessfully) at about the same time on Razorgore. I don't recognize any of these guilds, though I'm not too familiar with ones on horde side.
---
Now you know what it's like to kill things as fast as a hunter, congrats!
---
Just ignore them/him completely and move on.
---
Wow is not just about bis lists, even if that's what some people think.

Also on 5 am I was farming from 5 am to 12 am fire Elementals to get fire essence  to make my chest piece 
---
Robe of the archmage  
---
So I was already abit tired after that xd 
---
And then we did the Dung from 
---
12am to 19 pm
---
No you should never use deadly.
---
Were the friendly visitors from Atal Alarion?
---
I’m very sorry. I hope your last days are comfortable.
---
So I hit 60 as a hunter, but didn't get the sceptre from Mara yet.  I'd love to start farming some gold.  Can I do the quest to get the sceptre solo?
---
NO! NOT DARNASSUS!!!
---
Ive played since release and Grob is the best server ive ever been on.
---
Simply put....Be careful what you ask for. "You think you do" 
---
In all seriousness, quality of life improvements "we" wanted made the game less social/fun/rewarding.
---
Same, unless shit is going down already!!
---
how are we in 2019 and people still dont know how to make a screenshot
---
Ah, the classic 60 mage who watched youtube videos on how he can farm gold solo in ZF, failed because he sucks, and is now looking for help.
---
Thats..... thats what making money is. Extremely few businesses ever say "we're making enough money, lets focus on quality". Literally any publicly traded company has shareholders that want returns on their investment, which constantly means finding ways to sell more of the product. One of the simplest ways to do that is to have it appeal to more people.
---
A product that appeals to everyone slightly means everyone buys it.
---
A product that appeals to some people extremely means just that some people buy it.
---
There are ways to tax people for quality products but MMOs are in the subscription and gaming markets which tend to work on popularity.
---
Why? Current WoW basically has no leveling and it does pretty well, as leveling is only a tiny part of the game. The vast majority of time played is in max level. So you could just start all characters at 120 and there won't be much difference.
---
Woah. Missing last picture of the wipe though.
---
did he manually type that out or is that some kind of addon lmao
---
Because I’ve been drinking and used my phone, but hey let’s just be Mr.Judgy 2019 and comment since it bothers you so much lol
---
jokes on u i play on setting 1 so no bushes
---
You dont need to be shadow for mara runs. Dont waste your money respeccing. Disc or holy are both fine. For princess, make sure you have minor speed on boots, sheild when/if she catches you, renew, when she does dust thing, move away, throw a single mindblast if you can and continue to kite with SWP. Its just a little faster as shadow, but you still get locked in disc so its actually more convenient because you dont need to wait as long for lockout. Ive done over 300 runs as disc. 
---
Also DM lasher farm is around 30-50g per hour average with herbing if you know what your doing and optimise your route. With the added bonus if you find a good epic, you could make alot more. I actually find lashers more profitable than mara runs if you dont get any ring buyers.
---
Smelting won't help you get levels after 185 skill though, so it's better to e.g. sell Truesilver bars since you need 230 to both mine and smelt it.
---
Windowed mode too weirdchamp
---
Everyone in here has some valid points about this whole situation, but I just need to remind everyone that most of the changes that had made retail infamous compared to classic, were made because of us. Either directly like Gearscore and world quest group finder (the latter of which which Blizz actually tried to shut down) or indirectly like the homogenization gear and stats because of our use of guides and cookie cutter builds.
---
I doubt there are any that are exactly 50/50 but Blaumeux is supposedly very close
---
There's a name I haven't heard in Years Wowcrendor. Gonna go resub
---
So wait, Blizz got rid of crits on players that are sitting? So a rogue ambushing a drinking player doesn't work?
---
What the hell is he talking about “fake classic”?
---
Yeah I can see that problem too. Just so confused when how they don’t see that 9str, 6agi and 15stam is pretty sweet for a dps xD
---
You run in fullscreen? Lol
---
F that guy. This triggered me,
---
I was saying I don’t think it’s that low of a percent. Probably more around 1-2%.
---
Good for bosses, but takes up a debuff in raids.
---
Its easy to pick up, and has a high skill cap. 
---
Plus you get a little buddy to quest with and grow fond of.

I farm SFK as an ele/resto sham but i use my old enh set. Takes around 45 min as a 54, but i only do it when im taking a break from RL but don't have the time to spend to do otherstuff on WoW so doing SFK is actually perfect for me.
---
Ill get around 2 stacks of wool that are sold immedietly upon listing in AH for 80-60s.
---
The farm itself gives like 5-8g in vendorable loot. Ill get another 5g on AH for the various greens.
---
Ive also managed to get two guillotine axes (around 2-4g market), a face smasher (8-10g), and night reaver (56g). Other valuable gear includes rings (sell for 1+g each. Meadowring of agi/monkey/elusiveness sell for a lot more). You can also get forrest leather bracers and scouting gloves of the monkey which each sell for multiple G.
---
this  
---
spacing  
---
sucks  
---
dick
---
People playing classic with BFA mentality sadly
---
I feel like Blizzard have continuously made changes to make game development for future patches easier on themselves. For example, removing tier sets in favour of the azerite pieces, which means less design load and effort goes into gear for the future. Pruning of abilities makes it easier to adjust classes in balance patches as there are less abilities to balance. 
---
Mythic + is just an easy way to keep people playing the same dungeons for the whole expansion without having to actually introduce new dungeons and along with it new unique gear. 
---
Removal of PvP gear and PvP stats means they don't have to worry about balancing around those stats.
---
Man the latest video with Saurfang confronting Sylvanas was soooo bad (along with the entirety of BFA story tbh). 
---
Saurfang was a great and beloved character, but it still was one of the most meaningless deaths Ive ever witnessed.
---
Solo elite mobs more quickly*, you'll have some fights where you dont even need to move as the mob is frozen taking crit hits the entire time
---
Pillars of Eternity is more recent but it has it also.
---
Do they have dailies there?
---
Why is ironforge harder?
---
I remember taking every opportunity to go up for a bit of a joy ride. But to each their own!
---
I’ve tired that but still no luck
---
This is the first thing I thought of when I saw this post.
---
Nobody has the PvP set yet though, nor will they for weeks. Fantasising about how hard you will kick the arses of people in early Phase One gear using your maxed out Phase Three gear seems weird to me, but you do you.
---
I will still probably check out 8.3 but I haven't felt this *engaged* by WoW in forever.
---
Sounds fun
---
How is druid gold farming endgame, in case I am able to make an alt to fund it?
---
Sword Art Online is just 4.5 years away.
---
It's pretty sad. People had the opportunity to somewhat experience how Vanilla was, but choose to play it like you do modern games. Instead of experiencing the world naturally they came with a grocery list, addons, and fully detailed guides.
---
This.  Wrath was peak wow.  Many things were starting to go wrong though, people decided that dungeons should be "round 10% of the dungeon up and AoE that crap to death" which made many abilities playstyles and to some extent whole classes just less useful.  Mage dps was fantastic, rogues were not as great.  But why use anything that wasn't an aoe for tanking? Why worry about the party if the tank never loses aggro?  Why make an at if there's no way to make the gear needed to do those things as a healer or tank?
---
BC was much, much better than classic for me.  I hate stupidly itemized messes, and let's face it not everyone that plays a warrior wants to tank, yet T1/2/3 are total tank sets.  Druids, shamans, priests, pallys can all do more than heal.  But their sets don't really bear this out.  Feral gear is very limited, and the best mitigation weapon is a lvl 43 epic, the best dps, outdoing the last legendary is a lvl 30ish blue mace from gnomer.  These things are easy to fix, but blizzard couldn't be bothered to do so and just cranked out crap.
---
Wraith was crazy good, at first. Talents were never more interesting, though I don't believe I saw a hybrid spec I truly enjoyed,  like I did in vanilla.  That fact alone probably encouraged blizzard to do away with the ability to do so in cata to some extent.  But the second they made it ultra homogenized I quit.  Indeed I came back for vanilla, which I enjoy, but not as much as BC or early Wraith.  So much was fixed with allowing you to play how you wanted, and still find your niche that it boggles the mind to why retail reminds me of an even more generic Diablo 3 clone. Disgusting.  Will never play it in it's current form, and it makes me sad to see my characters which I spent so much time with completely boring and neutered.
---
SUWOOOOOOP
---
Not for leveling or PvP
---
$15 says she’s the undead rogue ganking them both.
---
It still crits, the crit just doesn't proc effects like enrage or reckoning unless the player is standing up right when it happens
---
dang, never would have thought I'd see someone from my deadish server referencing him. That guy wasn't nearly as good as this one Armani was kind of a jerk.
---
This is one of my favorite things about vanilla and BC. I can see someone do something or watch a video and actually want to make that class just because what I saw can't be done by whatever I'm playing.
---
It's supposedly second best after TF for humans. Even for threat.
---
Druids are great herb farmers because of the stealth and travel form escape, plus root enemies so you can grab an herb. Same for mining.
---
you can also solo farm mauradon like hunters and warlocks do for good gold, but I don't think you can farm Dire Maul quite as well as a hunter would.
---
I don't have a lvl 60 druid I just have a 57 mage and mage aoe farming beats everything else
---
Gutter can wait but WC can't.
---
Nice ! GZ !! 
---
It went for us smooth too ^^ 
---
But we only had a
---
Rogue 
---
Mage /me 
---
Warrior 
---
And a healer :D 
---
We never really got wiped it was actually only in the end at the school it was really tricky ^^ because of the fast respawn  
---
But!

GZ!

Also did many breaks and didn't know the way :P

---
As a mage, I usually charge 1g for 6 stacks of the buyer’s choice whatever that may be (4 water / 2 food for example) or 50s for 3 stacks and portals I accept 18s + whatever the buyer wants to offer but I am happy with just making the reagent cost back. Most people tip 50s to 1g and that is plenty in my opinion.
---
Occasionally I will charge more for water if I am in a high volume area with no other mages around handing out water. 2g for 6 stacks (1g for 3) of level 55 water is still extremely cheap compared to Argent Dawn water.
---
I stopped playing right at the start of WoD, mostly because of my computer and new job. Came back midway into BFA because I thought I’d might get a beta to classic. 
---
From TBC to BFA it’s like They turned the best mmo into a pewpewque. Just stay by the ah and que for dungeons and battlegrounds. Leveled all my chars this way rather quickly. they have heart of Azeroth in so you have to quest somewhat because it basically doubles your dps and healing, so it’s sort of obvious if you don’t have it upgraded. But I never met anyone on the fly, never would end up grouping with people on my server. With all the phasing, even questing in the field you never really run into anyone until your synced up at the finish line. 
---
I got to 120 on a few toons, upgraded my HoA, got some 420 gear. Did a lot of 8.2... I was playing a bit before classic launched so it was all i had) but it was more a big solo game. There is a lot of content, but not a lot or it feels rewarding, and thus not fun. On a whim I went into TK and ashes of alar dropped! That sort of sparked new life into it and I start mount farming more and more. then I realized I was just doing absolutely nothing. completely not about anything. 
---
I will say heroic warfront : stormgrade keep was very fun. Active instance, it felt like a true siege, better than the siege of orgrimar raid in MoP.  people don’t really play that more than once. Their are no real reward to keep you there. Other than that I was pretty much playing random Bgs always. 
---
Then you got these minion missions, which is Sort if needed to upgrade your HoA quickly, but again it’s like there the content falls into two categories; it’s either tideious and rewarding, or fun and not rewarding.
---
The fact that almost all mobs totally ignored you as soon as your feet lifted off the dirt was stupid. Probably necessary for coding reasons I don't understand, but stupid. Even just letting all caster mobs light you up, and melee smack you if you were too close to the ground, would have fixed most of the problems.
---
depends. 4 piece valor is tanking pre bis actually. id be mad if a dps rolled over me. but its whatever if i already have it who cares lol.
---
You sure showed him, asserting dominance by sitting on their feet
---

When I was younger I shared an account with my dad. He was away at work at the ol' oilrig, and I was leveling happily until I kept getting disconnected over and over again. 
---
It turned out that my dad was trying to log on and play at the same time I was, on his laptop whilst sitting in his truck. Tsk tsk.
---
Ahaha that's gold. Looks like Grubby approved.
---
Im currently a lvl 54 holy hybrid priest healing BRD pretty easy. I also quest a lot solo and kill quick. I plan on going full holy at 60. For now wand spec/spirit tap have been great for solo questing. No need to respec if u have a good wand. I kill extremely quick and have 0 down time.

---
Live classic isn't actually classic as it was during 2004-2007 era of wow. It's based on the modern wow system and is a mish match of different time periods of vanilla, such as enemies being on the 1.12 lessened difficulty yet Naxxramas is not accessible. World enemies are available that shouldn't be in the time when only mc and onyxia were around. Things like that.
---
but I made 100g in one drop so that means I'll make 10,000g a day!
---
As stupid as it sounds, the main thing I miss is all the music from retail.
---
They already started the streamlining with patch 3.1. 
---
In that patch they made it so that affliction locks can't use fire spells and removed siphon life. All because people complained playing affliction lock was "too hard" with 5 dots, 1 debuff and nightfall proccs/filler spells (and it was harder to do big dick dps in dungeons since everything died too fast). 
---
The 3.0 version was, for me personally at least, the peak of affliction warlock and i will forever be sad it was killed so soon.
---
VC is just some NA stuff. Naming a dungeon after its boss is pointless.
---
He never expected a foot rub ;)
---
We must prevent this shitty anime future at all costs
---
I believe there is a setting in ElvUI to prevent chat fading. However, I already had Leatrix Plus installed and they had the setting to prevent chat fade already...so I just used that. I’m sure there is probably a setting in ElvUI somewhere, but I am honestly just too lazy to check.
---
didnt know they are making game. I enjoyed the first season of anime.
---
Totally depends on your server. On Faerlina the mafia is so bad tribal LW is irrelevant because you'll spend so long competing for leather you may as well have just farmed gold.
---
Retail bad
---
I felt the same. Never played it back in the day but all my mates talked me in to trying it when classic released. Even at 15 years old it is honestly one of the most fun games to play and very addictive. Even as a casual player due to work commitments it makes it even more satisfying to finish a bunch of quests and level up.
---
Along as mana-users are drinking when we pull we are usually happy enough to start a little early.
---
The beautiful thing about the early pull is that the tank gets to properly LOS pull the next pack and get some threat before the aoe starts.
---
One thing is certain, steer clear from people that spam tells and ginvites.
---
There's probably a number of companies out there that haven't made the announcement. I'm just making the reference because the book starts in 2024.
---
I've ran separate wings 50 times so far. No drops, but we've looted about 15 class books.
---
Idk how you made it to level 44 and would ever want to do that on a warrior again
---
cringe
---
Use it before combat to stop warrior from charging etc or reset combat and use it to extend that reset period.
---
Are you in lfg or LookingForGroup? Lfg is dead.
---
Rattlegore. Always and I mean always poppin
---
Haven't done the raid, but the 5man dungeon that came with it was epic. But if I'm not mistaken, that's also when daily quests were introduced?
---
oh. woosh for me
---
Look at ff14 if you want to know how to succeed on an mmo.. which blizzard clearly fails at.
---
Plus it started at lvl 50 cap.. now its only 70... after sooooooo many years, only 20 levels.
---
Look at fuking shitty Wow... went up to 120 from 60.....lol like wtf,no one wants that garbage
---
So they poly you, wait out FAP and then do that, is that hard to wrap your smooth brain around?
---
Until pvp trinkets sheep literally hard counters anything a warrior can do to stop a mage from setting up the kite
---
This is probably a controversial opinion, but its Blizz making changes based on player feedback. It's an enormously complex topic and I am not blaming players really either but there are definitely some entitled influencers in gaming communities that can have a big impact. Games don't need to be perfectly balanced and developers don't need to put so much weight into what the community wants. Developers are the ones who have the experience and passion to know what creates a good and long lasting game and we should trust them. Another big issue all games are facing is PROFITS. The games industry is huge and corporate profits are dictating how and when games are developed.
---
Ayyyy, it’s me!

Seems like u need good players lol

Stop trying to act tough over the internet when you have no idea what you're talking about retard

Worgen starting zone was about the only good thing in that release.
---
Old Blanchy is a gem! Alliance has great raiding guilds as well.
---
Private servers is more fake though since everything they have is guesswork.
---
Never pass up the opportunity to run a dungeon if you see one looking for a DPS for your level.  It will put you ahead on XP and you do best when ahead of the stuff you're fighting.
---
one of many gifts...ok?
---
You don't get intercept til what..32? The guy who was trying to "school me" was talking about a level prior to 30.
---
Everyone had a different point they think was perfect but it's just a long and slippery slope from the beginning. Even in vanilla, dungeons got nerfed, raids got nerfed, epics got easier to get with pvp rep rewards and 20 man raids, cross server became a thing, along with transfers. Most of this was popular with a lot of people with some people hating it. It just kept going and everyone had a different point where it was too much. Me from 15 years ago didn't really like any of it, me from now thinks arena is kind of cool, I don't have a ton of time, even though I also think making pvp a mini game and introducing resilience was one of the worst things to happen that I'm aware of.
---
This ! My son soon will be 1 year old. and its so insane to see the charcter that he is developing. And this also is one of biggest things, it would be awesome that i could play with him, but if thats not for him, i wont push him, I dont want to be one of those who try to achieve something throu they kids, what ever my kid will be into, I will fully support.

I'm wondering whats the earliest lvl I could heal UBRS? Or can I only do so at lvl 60...? I figure as long as I have good enough gear 58 would be fine.
---
Looking at it lorewise, Imo it started going downhill after Wrath of the Lich King because almost every major character we have met from Warcraft 3 and the Frozen Throne were somehow already encountered in game. I mean putting Deathwing aside (who was delivered in the most terrible raid ever designed), Which lore character hyped you enough to stay subbed? Personally speaking I have never felt fulfilled or satisfied killing anything after LK 25 HC. Classic, TBC and WotLK is filled with our favourite lore characters therefore they will never lose their charm for some of us. That's my two cents.
---
I remember this in some old school videos for hunter solo stuff.
---
Real shame first boss has nothing for hunters though
---
Mother fucker dude, just bought my first mount like an hour before seeing this post
---
58 is ok but lots of groups want 60s only.
---
Let people be happy... beats 90% of the complaints
---
What an interesting question.
---
For me personally, the flying mount is a big game killer. When you can fly past all danger and much quicker then you are removing yourself from a huge dangerous world and suddenly you are playing a in small safe environment.
---
However I feel that most people dislike the dungeon finder system but I don't think it can be pinned down that easy. 
---
Some of the big things for me, like resetting the game on every expansion and making all old content irrelevant and all your work and effort means nothing is a big thing for me too. Blizzard never expanded their game either. They add some features, increase the level cap and remove all the old raids, world's and quests in a sense where they are still technically there but completely irrelevant. Making the part of the game that matters, very small. It's just not a world anymore, more comparable to a mobile game really.
---
The list goes on but I think this is enough for now. Good luck in Classic and hope to see you there.
---
Okay. Could give me an insight how the „rotation“ looks like? Spam harmstring till wf and flurry proccs than Continue with HS etc. ?
---
i think i wouldnt try this in the first place because of that exact reason.
---
At the very start of classic, when it first launched, there was an INSANE number of players logging in. Now imagine you have about 300-400 people who are all trying to do the starting quests. Firstly the mobs are limited, so you're going to get an insane wait times for the mobs to respawn so people can kill them for the quest, which as a problem increase FIVE fold when you have all these people trying to kill a NAMED mob. Secondly, collection quests, where the item they collect in the world disappears after it's been harvested, same problem as previously mentioned. Thirdly resources, where you've got this insane number of people trying to harvest all these resources.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Now, layering creates multiples versions of the world itself. The mobs will be present on ALL the layers, and even if one is killed in ONE layer, the OTHER layers still have copies of the creature in it (or resource or whatever). This allows more people to go and do their thing without having to wait for 10-20 minutes just to kill a single mob. Players are DIVIDED over these layers.
---
Emerald dream
---
if you're still relying on bodypulling and mobs hit you for a while before you want to frost nova them, yeah its proc could cause a problem
---
but if you're aggro pulling and frost novaing once things start hitting you, it's only helping you instead of hurting you

Interesting, yeah that makes sense. Thanks for the tip!
---
I saw Vulperas
---
truefaith is replaced by t2.
---
Bot?
---
Definitely not stupid, but the music in classic is what does it for me. Even though I started playing in wrath... idk what it is but the music in classic gives me so much nostalgia and hearing the barrens music or elwynn forest just like hits a spot in the feels man 😂
---
Tokens for tier happened from ZG. AQ sud the same and so did Naxx
---
Dad played a game once. I think it was Timesplitter 2. All he ever said about it was, "Oh wow that was an hour? No wonder you boys don't come down quick when we call you for dinner."  
---
He'll probably get hooked if he ever retires.
---
I haven't seen that dude screaming at his cats video in years.
---
We are doing that in classic with no end game gear. I haven't needed cc so far
---
I have to say 5.4 was glory days of WoW.
---
For the Horde!
---
Guessing you saw her on Supernatural?
---
I think a lot of people are forgetting about the basics - 1 is the time/reward cycle that classic brings that other expansions don't and 2 is that everyone is playing in the same area.  It's 60 levels compared to 5 or 10 per expansion. Each with multiple zones to explore (again). It's having a new talent every level and new spells (or ranks) every two. You literally feel your character get stronger the more you play. And then finally when you get to 60, gear makes a significant impact at WPVP. You can't actually keep doing that forever without diluting the game by making it larger.
---
So whilst nostalgia may of brought everyone back, it's the reward cycle (aka crack) and the amount of players keeping them there.
---
Which in turn made tanks forget about avoidance and just go the EH-mana sponge way
---
&gt; You have to be careful on pulls. You have to watch your life,mana and position.
---
If your trying to imply retail doesn't have this then you must not do high M+ keys.  These are all hallmarks of high keys.  I like classic and find it has things that are more enjoyable than retail but can we stop pretending that any part of it was difficult in any way shape or form?  It was a test of patience more than anything.
---
I’ve seen blue posts on this, essentially it’s against the rules to use any spot that guards won’t aggro and attack you, to avoid guards during pvp. People are definitely risking their sub when they do things like this
---
It took me 18 runs of strat to get mask of the unforgiven, but my very first ony ever deathbringer dropped and I won the roll.
---
Both would use one and it equals out, so both would waste resources.
---
Old but gold!
---
I am a warrior so I think I will just buy the gold I need for epic mount.
---
What happens to this color?
---
They were definitely around from earlier than that. The netherdrake mount's faction had daily quests, and so did many areas elsewhere (whose names I can't recall). With so many factions (*oh so many factions*), they put in daily quests for people to rep up or still quest for gold.

Gilneas!
---
it's less confusing if you use the word  'vanilla' for 2004-2006  and 'classic' for 2019 version.
---
Did you find a solution? I'm having the same issue.
---
Hahaha nice one
---
Grats dude!
---
What addon are you talking about?
---
Find different items for PvP like the necropile set out of scholo.
---
Dabu
---
I remember when warriors were men in vanilla, they wore plate. They also didnt spam chat "LF TANK". You bunch of pansies.
---
Do it! I put off doing it for fear of getting addicted. All my mates who played it back in the day told me to try out classic and I wouldn't regret it. I am 100% loving this game. It has the perfect mixture of difficulty, lore and gratification once you complete a quest as well as just making you feel apart of this massive world.
---
Yeah, not having imp FD is massive though :p
---
Oh for sure my man! The music in WoW has been one of the few things that has had a lasting effect throughout all expansions
---
Omen of Clarity is really great too, the clearcasting procs help a lot
---
&gt;When Vanilla first launched in 2013
---
W-what?

Hakkar or shadowmoon
---
Shattrath didn't have "portals everywhere" in TBC.
---
It had 1 portal to Orgri and 1 to IF/SW Jim not sure. 
---
With the sunwell patch a portal to quel'danas was added.
---
While I mostly agree with you, when you say stuff like "Most of the playerbase was not happy that their class was almost strictly worse than another. " its on you to back that up when called out on it.
---
If I said "All flat earthers are Christians" and you say "What? source?" I cant just go "Well, prove they *arnt* Christians!"
---
any chance of a curse client upload?
---
You can just use [mod] and save some 14 characters to play with, and then you could use shift alt or control at will for the same effect.
---
Loud minority on forums ruined it for everyone :(
---
Bloodfang is easily the best looking set by far
---
Pisses me off that they let this happen in the first place
---
This is also true, but setting up missing HP and famiiarizing yourself with the approx. value of your heals is a significant QOL improvement for healing efficiently (read, learning best practices to minimize overheal).
---
Thats me haha :D but i didn't look for help
---
Does Hurricane stack? other than that I we would see a swipe spam party? lol

I quote the part of the movies where the cops are chasing him while he’s doing the Spanish dance and the dumb cop goes “darn, I missed him” and the other cop hits him and yells “WE ALL MISSED HIM”. It was always so funny to me but no one ever knows what I’m referring too. 
---
Watched this too many times as a kid.
---
Oh she was on Supernatural wasn't she? I didn't really watch that show, got to about the 5th or 6th season after binge watching it daily and gave up on it. But she's been in a few other shows. Such as The Magicians which I absolutely love despite them killing off one of the main characters.
---
It's pretty much when you become crit cap.
---
The heroic dungeons weren't bad either. You didn't want to PUG most of those the first few months of the expansion before most people were raid geared.
---
Mists was an awesome expansion.  Loved every moment of it.  Those zones were so amazing to quest in, the sha aesthetic was amazing.  I'm half considering finally buying BfA just to see the Vale of Eternal Blossoms returned back to glory.
---
The things people didn't like forced them to make groups and work with people to overcome them creating real communities. If you don't like waiting for mobs to spawn join a group with someone else and share kill credit. Maybe do some more quests with them and make a friend. Don't like finding dungeon groups? Join a guild or make friends with people you can rerun dungeons with so its easier.
---
Dude you wont get in his groups again man, what will you do now
---
Lol right? First time playing wow and I have a 46 lock, 50 druid, and I'm working on a orc rogue now. I really like the druid, I'll still play on it. But I disowned the lock. Boring af.
---
No clue, but either way I think it would be hilarious. Considering Druids are "useless" I would honestly like to see a 40-man pure druid raid group.
---
You are more likely to get struck by lightning that see that mount drop, might as well use it to get runs faster

Dont tell him. Hate when you get people opening random trade windows with you. "Open?" Hes better off
---
It is good. If I have 1.5 hour of playtime after a long working day I don’t want to spend half of it with flying, waiting for boat etc.
---
This is not quite correct, you still do the same amount of glancing blows but the damage penalty of the glance gets reduced.
---
This guy is from the 'other' timeline
---
It's because the little inconveniences and annoying stuff is actually the game. It's the same reason when you play a game with all the cheat codes on it's boring after an hour. Working towards something and earning something is gratifying when its challenging.
---
def not "bis" for a prot warrior lol
---
So many things they changed. Like some other commentators said they kept making things more convenient. Here are some examples.
---
1. Giving every class healing abilities and getting rid of First Aid.
---
2. Adding flight paths _everywhere_
---
3. Removing the need to drink for mana in 99% of situations
---
4. Everyone being able to tap the same boss for quests/loot drops without formally grouping up.
---
5. Entering instances without traveling to them
---
6. Nullifying many social interactions with interface tools that make grouping up for specific content a mere click away.
---
7. Giving people mounts sooner, you can now ride in a chauffer driven mount at level 1 on your alts.
---
All of these things I just listed can feel like annoyances. What if you need healing and don't have bandages or materials to make them? What if you want to travel somewhere and the nearest flight path is 5 minutes away by mount from where you need to go? What if you just wanna keep throwing out spells and not drinking etc
---
All on their own could be considered valid complaints that are "annoying". But when you actually accomplish things in the game with all these things _in your way_ you feel a much greater sense of accomplishment or at-least I do.
---
When I know a dungeon is going to take 2 hours and I need to bring sacred candles for buffing, water for drinking, find a nice mage to give me a lot of conjured water, make sure I'm repaired at a vendor in a city I'm in (as no one has vendor repair mounts in classic) and then figure out how I'm going to physically get to the dungeon entrance with my friends etc
---
All that adds to the realism of the game. It makes the world feel alive and more like real life. If I'm going somewhere in real life I don't open an interface on my phone click a button and teleport do I? I figure out how I'm going to get there, get into a car, drive there etc
---
That feels real to me. Classic feels real, it feels more real than a lot of games. Now having said that there are levels to convenience and for me Classic is in the right balance on most of it. I just feel Retail has gone to a very extreme place of making the game overly convenient to a point where I no longer feel like I'm even playing an MMO. It now feels like I'm playing an Arcade version of Skyrim with a Multiplayer 3rd-party addon which just sometimes peppers in other players into my game world but they have little consequence beyond being a background to my single player adventure.
---
One last thing I'll say about retail that I don't like which isn't about conveniences. I don't like the time gated content and I don't like this feeling that you have to login every day to complete a bunch of objectives or those objectives are gone. I want to play the game on my terms if I want to play it for 5 hours one day and 0 hours the next I should be able to do that without feeling like I'm falling behind and losing oppertunities.
---
This constant push Blizzard is making to get us to login every single day to complete a time-gated task to maintain progression (collecting azerite, getting ur bg bonuses for the day, completing world quests etc) is just really lame and are the major reason I quit playing retail.
---
I already have a job, I don't want to feel like I have another job. I play games to be entertained not to work a second job so that I can have fleeting moments of enjoyment between the necessary daily grinds so that I don't feel I'm falling behind and to stay competitive in PVP etc
---
I know this post is long, good fortune to any that took the time to read it. I'm loving Classic!
---
Awh I wish my dad was cripplingly addicted to wow like me.
---
Chat add-on called Prat has that option.
---
9% hit is always priority  
---
holy shit you have ironfoe?
---
I can't believe they made a Hearthstone card into an item in WoW!
---
K
---
Blizzard listened to the fan base, nearly every quality of life change they implemented came because we the fan base begged for it, and likely initially thought it was a great idea because we didn't realise the unintended consequences of it.
---
The forums were flooded with requests for flying mounts, LFG tools etc. The only change I can think of that we didn't ask for was making the combat so easy, my theory is Blizz saw their sub numbers dwindling and tried to make it more accessible for people.
---
Is there a reason behind that? Iam just confused :D
---
I made the same discovery! And I keep wondering why am I leveling so slowly, while doing stuff like this :'D

Kargoz made a few Paladin guides. You will want engineering if you can spare the funds for the aoe assistance. You will need consecrate and everything else in prot. Priority is consecrate.
---
Holy shit that is pretty good, I'll just have to stop buying stuff on the ah, most of my money goes to health potions.
---
Best part is that Hunters are one of the classes that can easily solo Maraudon at lvl 60.
---
The person I replied to had stated that those voicing displeasure with class balance were a ‘vocal minority.’ 
---
So, they said that the majority *was* happy with class balance. 
---
For them to then ‘call me out’ on a similar statement I made is ridiculously hypocritical. It’s just shutting down the argument when you have nothing to say. 
---
And no, in this context it’s not ‘on me’ to provide citations. It’s not at all comparable to making a statement about the religion of flat earthers.
---
Here’s a simple question: 
---
Are you, as a balance druid, happy that you do 50% of the dps of a mage? Yes/No? 
---
I didn’t run this poll amongst balance Druids in vanilla, nor did I perform a statistically significant randomized poll for the general playerbase if they were okay with the current state of balance Druids. 
---
Even discounting that I’m talking from my experience and I knew some hella salty Druids, which is really what I’m bringing to the argument, for me this is just a given. 
---
Of course most players aren’t happy that their class does 50% of the dps of another class. Asking for a citation for that, to me, is just a way to refuse to acknowledge that it’s the truth. 
---
I don’t need to have a citation ready when someone who’s just arguing in bad faith ‘calls me out.’ I could have provided and in-depth player survey from 2004 and they would have picked at its methodology to discredit it lol. There’s no point, even if the evidence did exist.
---
Thought about it for a second when i realized i could, but remembered it died for me with cata release so i left it there.
---
Same here. Was gonna start tomorrow.
---
thanks again,*
---
I mained a rogue during classic (though only after ICC was released), and am not sure what you mean by rogues not being great. Especially for AOE. Popping blade flurry and killing spree allowed you to top mages in AOE damage. Yes, multi-target DPS wasn't good when those CDs were up, but that still meant I could beat mages every 2 to 3 pulls.
---
This because arena existed. If there is no arena, people will put more effort in rated BGs.

I am also not disagreeing with you, merely expanding upon your point
---
Both of those classes require minimal skill to play but actually learning the class gives the class even more strength. I personally prefer Druid.
---
&gt; overtuning stats
---
Definitely a big concern of mine. I'm worried about a day when people couldn't care less about visiting Strat or Scholo because by level 62 or 63 they'll have green gear that outclasses it. Why go to these places when you can head to outlands as early as....what, 57? And the worst part is, the world then feels more empty cause all these high leveled players just left Azeroth to go to outlands instead.
---
ZF is located in Tanaris which is a 40-50 zone.... 
---
There's also feralas nearby which is like 40-60
---
And with 73 silver to spare...not bad my man.
---
Is it really the same person posting Asmon vids here every time?
---
Real life time is limited, I'd rather post on the LFG channel and know NOW whether we can form a group or not, or find a group that's already nearly fully formed. Plus it makes the whole thing far more complicated and a pain. Currently not everyone is aware of the LFG channel, so you have people outside in the world in other areas who'd WANT to join for certain dungeons, but have no idea it's being advertised, but now imagine if the only way to form a group is to head back to a capital city and put up a post or search for someone.
---
The LFG channel is great, a noticeboard however would be a nightmare to make use of.
---
I think the bigger issue was probably that design decisions that made wow great were not intentional. No one said we aren't doing LFG because we want players to form communities and this will force them to interact. When players asked for it they didn't have a reason not to add it.
---
1-3 million is absolutely insignificant compared to mobile gatcha markets.
---
Look at one of the other most popular MMO on the market right now (and the most aggressively monetized one) Black Desert.
---
They released a highly cut down gatcha p2w mobile version of their MMO which has been running for 5+ years and the mobile version is already catching up fast. (  [https://mmos.com/news/black-desert-mobile-earning-almost-3x-much-money-pc-version](https://mmos.com/news/black-desert-mobile-earning-almost-3x-much-money-pc-version)  )

Rogue was probably ganking their alt.
---
And yes, I was very salty with them, they've been /following me for 2h straight xD.

Western mmo bad, eastern weeb mmo good

It takes a true neckbeard gamer to not only eat cheeseburgers for breakfast but also start whinging before the dungeon even starts, and then start acting bitchy after 1 wipe.
---
As a hunter, I like to think my side job is keeping the healer safe if something gets past the tank. :)
---
What plugin is that??
---
The thing is it kinda stands to reason. He has convincing arguments. If I'd played in vanilla, made a war and suffered through 60 levels of white hits, parries, dodges, misses, glancing blows and having to stop every 2 mobs to eat and seen literally everyone else whizz by with self-heals, cc abilities, resources not depending on my hit chance, ranged abilities, pets, absorbs, etc... I would've been mad as fuck.

STV is great especially if you have skinning. (Lots of beasts)

"You think you do but you don't ;)"
---
Yeah healing touch rank 4 is one of (maybe the single) most mana efficient heal(s) in the game.
---
So you may only be healing 600 hp per heal but the mana spent to healing delivered ratio is amazing compared to other ranks and heals.

This month he hit 30k subs, that's $105k from subs only in one month.
---
But then there is even less Horde to drop the bombs for the Alliance quest :(
---
Seriously though, I haven't seen any Horde successfully drop a single bomb. I even looked up what the bombs look like because it's as if I simply overlook them but I can't find any picture.
---
I've been thinking about a way to distract the guards as Alliance. I wonder if Helcular's Remains is able to distract the guards for long enough?
---
But doesn't classic have basically 0 world complexity?!?!  Maybe I just don't understand what you mean by it but in retail the amount of mechanics these days is insane.
---
So eating cheeseburgers at 10pm is breakfast now?
---
I've never played or gotten to 60 before but I feel like the gear would be better, 60% mount gets the job done and most of my running happens when I'm lvling not dungeon running so I feel like the mount would be near useless at 60.
---
I wholeheartedly agree. The downfall started with patch 1.12, as crossrealm BGs were introduced.
---
Instantly reminded me of that South Park episode lol
---
We are not your therapist though
---
It's tempting to go daggers just because of the lack of swords in the game. We've got perdition on our two tanks and a rogue already. Zero viskag or brutality blades across 2 groups with 5 weeks of clears. Several oeb's, the axe from ony etc.

“Had some really nice recipe and pattern drops”
---
Yeah I'm on ally side of Blaumeux it is very close. Horde always start fights in stv then we form a group and go hunting so it's pretty even world pvp wise. Alliance aren't as much of pussies as they usually are.
---
i’m currently saving up mats to get a tailor to make me robe of the archmage. is there a customary amount i should be paying/tipping as it’s BiS and high demand so recipe is probably expensive?
---
Yeah, same here :\\
---
1979
---
he is probably undergeared. ZF is a quite gear check and you need  at least 6000(ideally more) mana to do it comfortably.
---
He probably wants few 3s to help out with aoe/heals after he gets aggeo on them or something.
---
Still it would be shit gph since 30%of the money comes from raw silver which you gonna split x5
---
I most definitely like the rails over classic's random splattering of quests.  It really started to grate on me having to constantly run back and forth between zones, or having to come back to get spend hours finding groups for elites or dungeons and hoping there's no pvp so you can finally get things done.
---
I played a lot of Classic in the beta and on the release, and then recently went back to retail and started leveling a new character. The biggest most noticeable difference is how retail straight up feels like an action RPG in comparison to Classic, it does not feel like MMORPG combat at all. You're just speed running mowing down guys even without heirlooms on or anything and it gets incredibly dull and repetitive after awhile in a MMORPG setting, it just doesn't work very well, especially at lower levels with so much fewer abilities. You actually get way more abilities in Classic at lower levels and you have to be way more strategic about them, watching your mana, not pulling too many guys, trying to stay at ranged, etc. Losing all that strategy just made the game super boring, it's like playing a Diablo game but without any of the fun of playing a Diablo game, only the fast paced ARPG combat and that's it, it just doesn't work.
---
I'm tempted to re-sub to retail. I'm 34 these days, I've done Naxx on retail, Sunwell, heroics in week 2 etc. I dont have that sort of time anymore. Retail appeals purely, as a casual to LFR raid, set up Steam Link and play from the sofa.
---
They started pandering to community and strayed from being a group of impassioned devs building SOMETHING THEY WANTED TO PLAY
---
OMG i just realized the recipe is BoP ahhhhh. okay guess i am leveling tailoring..
---
I feel like the twirlling cursor over specific parts of the ground was enough to let you know where they are.
---
&gt; no queues anywhere
---
How about you stop fucking lying?
---
That sounds like you were wearing heirlooms.
---
I was thinking camel hump, but I like yours.
---
If I’m not mistaken, spell power is not that bad for ret.
---
I think you can search WoWhead by horde rep. But essentially they are quest chain ending quests. So let’s say you want darkspear rep, going to the Barrens and doing zebra hoof quest chain to competition will award 150 all horde rep and and can be done at level 22 for full rep award as this is the final quest level.
---
cant miss snd :)
---
I mean, that was the polite and nice way to say it.
---
No of course not. It's not an actual bot, it's just a useful UI add on that allows you to heal with fewer clicks.
---
Considering CSC is BoP, and in most servers DHC goes just under 300g, hell the fuck no it's not.
---
Sure you did. Shattrath had portals to all major cities.
---
Upvoted upon seeing this was downvoted. Question for you good sir as you are the expert on these matters: Hunter ammo. I am a Hunter, am I able to use the special higher dps engi ammo, or do I have to use the standard vendor ammo? Am I able to use ammo at all? I mean, it is a consumable, I have to buy a whole hell of a lot of it, so doesn’t that venture into the unwritten rules with regard to consumables? Maybe I have a certain limit? How many arrows do I get before I have to give up the duel? Maybe 10? 20? 
---
Also: pets. Clearly a pet is a massive no no in a duel as it costs resources (food) to keep them content and/or happy, thus leading them to deal more damage. I assume pets are just right out? Help me.
---
Damn, you reminded me of one of my 'favorite' dungeons in TBC: The dungeon where you eventually fight a boss called 'murmur' (the one where you have to all run from him when he's charging up, and then I think you all have to hug him when he does a different power). The dungeon layout was *terrible* compared to even SFK. I mean imagine that: SFK, one of the lower leveled dungeons being more visually appealing than the TBC one at post-60. I think even Scholomance and Stratholme were awesomely designed.
---
Wailing Caverns and Ragefire Chasm both suck immensely though. Wailing Caverns more for being confusing than design, but even its design is not as aesthetically pleasing as stockades or deadmines.
---
if you get out of bed at 10pm and eat burgers 30min later, it breakfast.
---
Certainly not in classic.
---
I would be careful about this, honestly think this is exploiting instead of „clever use of mechanics“. Gonna pass.
---
I once used google translate to communicate with a healer who spoke Italian. It went just fine.
---
Why do you type so slowly?
---
Use both.
---
you basically want your pet to have as close to 0 focus as often as possible. bite is better to have it spent on but you need a focus dump, bite alone every 10 seconds is worse than claw by a long shot i think. 
---
they fill 2 different niches, use both (or if you have a different group of focus dumps/CD nukes from pet, just make sure you have a focus dump).
---
I've seen them around 300-350 on my PVE server. May go slightly higher on a more populous pvp server.

cool dude but i don think illusionary rod is anywhere near as good as that, since its just raw stats
---
windreaver rod has +14 spell damage vs + 10 spirit. really really obvious choice.
---
So, so, SO many horses.
---
You know... there are some places around this huge world where 15$ is actually a big deal.
---
Just Arcane, otherwise I’d agree completely.
---
Moonkin form?
---
@Kushlax
---
So turn retail back into WoD? No thanks.
---
In the weeks before the launch I tried a bit of retail, made a lvl 30 char and spent an afternoon at the darkmoon faire.
---
I'm having trouble grasping what you're putting out here. So because off-hand damage is halved, somehow  crit is better than ap?
---
Same
---
Pretty sure it’s part of the quest for the warlock epic mount.
---
I’m feeling that

---
What a prick he could have helped you grind the rest.
---
No shit.  How many times do these people need to run down the same roads to "get a sense of scale"?  I can't be the only one that alt-tabs out when I take a fight path.  World of Walking gets old real quick, which is why everyone wants epic mounts.
---
Learn to spell.
---
Well done!
---
it felt so friggin goofy rolling up to jasperlode mine in my bike, decked out in heirloom gear to kill kobolds.
---
I think this was definitely the case.
---
There were changes made that they couldn't really justify, a key one I remember being "tanks want to do damage"
---
I never, ever met a tank that said this because this wasn't why people were choosing to tank. Sure, there are a few reasons but doing damage was never one of them.
---
What then happened was players started to get abuse in groups because tanks were outdamaging them and this would happen either when they were working on their gearing or the tank could AOE.
---
On Naxx trash and Sartharion as as a Frost DK offtank I outdamaged the entire raid. It was very silly and I doubt it's exactly motivating for DPS. In retail my Prot Warrior was in a similar spot and although people would joke about it you can tell they aren't enjoying being destroyed on DPS by a Tank.
---
Perhaps not the worst change by quite a margin but one made on the justification of seemingly imaginary player's wishes.
---
I didnt get a single flight path til I was 60. Was in such a stupid rush that I thought the walk to the bat handler would slow me down
---
On one hand, I know what you're trying to say, on another hand.
---
&gt;Dungeons went from being thrilling challenges 
---
Seems to apply to BFA dungeons more. The game is much harder mechanically. The amount of times I've had a good group fail a run is much higher than in classic. It's an actual *thrilling* race against the clock. 
---
&gt; AOE tunnels built to satisfy methed out tweakers who can't even wait long enough for someone to loot bodies before they're starting the next pull.
---
Isn't that literally the classic spellcleave meta summed up? Just a bunch of tweakers hitting two buttons while some dude pulls before people can loot?
---
Don't get me wrong, classic does a lot of stuff better, but I can't help but think people are going full rose-tinted glasses when they suggest classic's dungeons are challenging compared to BFA.
---
Clam slam*
---
Nah sitting in the queue is PvP, because err other players and you're doing things
---
They like to frost nova once the mobs get into melee range and not move away for some reason :D
---
"This isn't working like in the video, stupid game"
---
If I make a video called warlock mara farm and instead of showing you how to farm it I walk silently to the final boss and point at him is that a good video? I'm not trying to be a dick but I expect the person to actually do what they put in the title of the video...
---
I used the GeForce Experience instant replay. If you save it records the last 5 minutes of gameplay, I just used Windows 10 photos app to crop the video
---
~50 runs, never seen it
---
I've been looking for a version of prat that works in classic. Thanks!
---
I should have lol but went to bed right after. Hopefully I meet him again because I won’t back down from a fair fight
---
It might just be that all the pre end game content has been decimated making the colors feel irrelevant in retail even if they provide better information because items are streamlined.
---
That's exactly when I quit, actually. I saw the Argent Tournament patch, my guild was being bad at the hard version of Ulduar, and I just lost complete interest. Nothing about that patch was appealing nor was there anything to really feel accomplished about
---
Depending on your servers runecloth prices farming gold and buying it is probably fastest.
---
Where do these drop.
---
What the name of your auto shot timer addon m8? 😊
---
Haha this is pretty accurate, undead players definitely meet the standard of douchery. Don’t get my wrong I love world pvp, so they’re always a target of mine as long as it’s a fair fight
---
I'm sorry but I find this really hard to believe.
---
I can't imagine reaching 50, yet alone 60 without flight paths. Did you not train any skills?
---
Leveling in Searing Gorge through the sprawling mine with a random guy when an Executioner Cleaver drops. I rolled greed on it and kept moving, the other guy was afk and let the roll timer wind all the way down. I won the axe, but didn’t check to see if I actually got it. My bags were full and I didn’t realize I didn’t have the axe. After fighting my way all the way back to where it dropped the corpse had despawned.
---
Bit of a noob question, how do I find a group to do SFK as alliance?
---
As in where do people normally hang out asking LFG SKF
---
what servers still have queue? mine have not had one since weeks ago and was just playing on herod 3 days ago
---
People in cities whisper me sometimes for water, and I'm happy to do it if you ask nicely.
---
In an instance though if you have a mana bar you're getting a free stack and more if you want. If people want food I usually wait until they ask.
---
Pet peeve here. As a warrior myself if you are asking for a tank and you’re a warrior too... go fuck yourself lazy trash!
---
Epic mount. The amount of time you will save doing literally everything means more gold, more time spent actually playing/farming and more time spent doing whatever you like really.
---
Cameron Diaz in that film 🤤
---
They took out free thought and creativity. I have been pointing to the class specs for years. Each class has one viable spec and only several options. It’s so incredibly boring. They took out any sense of individuality.
---
Are you supposed to get masks for races that arent your own? I got a male night elf one and just assumed that for some reason they gave you a mask of your own character and didnt think about it again..
---
It's going to depend on if the GM is paying attention.  Subbing in letters to bypass a filter is called "masking", and it is absolutely a violation. Can be even worse than just saying the word- because you knew it was wrong and made an effort to still do it.
---
The only way it gets noticed is if enough players right-click and report. (no one actively monitors all the chat channels) I don't know if classic has the thresholds built in where enough reports will mute the player and generate a ticket, but if it only sends a report then it could be days before anyone looks at it.
---
Even so, good chance many of the players don't even know how to use the right-click report system.
---
r/hmm
---
This is where im at.  My server is so small people can only run joint mc runs at the moment, so each guild is bringing their own tanks (some specced fury because theres no room).  
---
I might stop playing to be honest.  I wanted to be a raid tank for classic, but unless you're the guild leader or personal friends with a guild leader it seems like there isn't opportunity.  I don't know anyone irl that plays so fuck me.
---
I guess the shitty part is that I still run the 5mans for people just because its a fun social thing to do, I just can't get any more leeway or make it easier or more effective.
---
Single target frost mage spec is fantastic pve and very good pvp
---
Killed myself close to menethil to do the whole run as a wisp which I thought would be faster. Ressed in front of ironforge at the spirit healer. Got teleported to menethil, because fuck you, if you res at any other spirit healer than the one you spawned at, you get tp'd to it. Fuck.
---
I haven't seen mob be treated as an acronym in ages
---
I feel old
---
That's a big ask for some people
---
Which is not even remotely the same. Even mages could only teleport to a limited number of fixed places.
---
Nowadays everybody can teleport from anywhere to any dungeon with the click of a button. In addition to teleport between capitals by walking through portals.
---
On guy from warson squad promotet for the raid on the allys. Firt a attack in ashenvalle. But ita rly funny that on the same time other hords are also attacking. We should do a date and time wehre all have a big battle on each server :)
---
0,001-0,000001 drop chance from world mobs.
---
&gt; why bullies bully
---
you mean the whole "all bullies have horrible homes and dads who beat them?" sort of nonsense?
---
Does it make me a bad person to say i wouldve blizzard'd if i saw those gnomes on the bridge?
---
what's the original in the comic?
---
It's made me stop running dungeons unless I really really need something from there.  I get a lot of whispers asking to tank, and I won't do it because the rewards of dungeon are nowhere near worth the time sink to do them.
---
Smart idea, even smarter of blizz to nerf that lol
---
I wanne see the reactions when you nonchalantly stand up, turn around, look sideways and straight up and jump out of the pot like „I wasn‘t even in your soup, mate“
---
3.0 warlock peak affliction? What are you smoking? 3.0 was blizz saying "fuck it we give up" and nerfed soul link to the ground, ruined felhunter and gave locks haunt, which did not do its intended purpose of making it so dots are spread easier and merely made it so you did less damage if you did *not* haunt, which is a nerf in damage. 3.1 didnt kill aff, it was already dead. Removing immolate was a little weird, but pairing sl to corruption was the right call as sl isnt a dot that deals significant damage and merely worth the gcd for the sustain it gives you. Pairing it with corruption means locks with less knowledge of their class do more damage because now they arent wasting that global.  
---
Nobody was complaining about playing aff being too hard, merely that it takes you *so* long to set up dots, you lack burst and thus have a super shitty time in 5mans because your dps is subpar. Haunt was a way of trying to fix that but it failed and removing immo+sl was a bandaid fix that also didnt work.
---
Level a holy priest... I’ve been a priest since forever but now I’m competing with atleast 4-6 other priest every raid.
---
buy two "of the eagle" rings for 5g each and go to town
---
Damn he is Keyori? Holy shit been some time since I've heard the name.
---
Didn't screencap? That's clear as fuck dude jesus Christ I bet you're fun to be around
---
I still don't understand why people get so upset about this. It gets eaten up by general/trade/world chat in 2 seconds most of the time
---
Usually in lookingforgroup, a worldwide channel for finding groups. To join, enter "/join lookingforgroup" and then ask away. 
---
Alternatively, in trade chat since Trade chat is shared for each city
---
I like having to spam to get groups. Gives me agency over what classes to bring and usually a small interaction (which goes a long way) with each player. It also means that when you find good players, you remember them.
---
I like that there are none raid specs, that you have to commit to be this or that. It creates identity and makes it so it’s not all about 1 aspect of the game.
---
Otherwise I do agree with your basic message. These things were changed and many thought it a good thing, but the magic is lost in the cracks those changes created.
---
😂😂 just get a spanish dictionary
---
This discord goes through extensive theory-crafting info, and isn’t your general warrior discord. It warns new people instantly on it not being a place for general or basic questions, and these types of questions will result in a ban.
---
Later learned you could just swim south of menethil and die of drowning to res at kharanos.
---
Be more aware of your party? get some unit frames so their health is more obvious? lol
---
This was amazing
---
The Flightmaster in EPL has been dead for 2 days straight on a layer on Mograine :(
---
Stayed up too damn late playing it.
---
That game is literally waiting for you to play it. Classic's quests are clearly all over the place so it gives you this sense of journey. Yeah it sucks if you like playing multiple classes, but its better than being on rails.  
---
Also if you really hate bouncing everywhere you can just grind mobs or instances.
---
It always makes me laugh when people act like this if they're wanting to take on the hardest content in the game. You know what you need to succeed in wow's hardest content? Other people. Any patch, any expansion, pissing off other people is a great way to hold yourself back. 
---
As someone who takes the game seriously and enjoys playing that way I go way out of my way to try and make everyone want to play with me. Need food? I'm a cook. Need enchants? I've got free mats. Need a player for a dungeon I don't need? I'll go to help you get geared up. Even when I get frustrated or angry waiting on people I keep that shit far away from discord or party chat. In return, I've progressed my character in the most important way - I've built a reputation that allows me to easily build groups of effective players for endgame content.
---
This guy could have his full pre-raid BiS but if he becomes known for being a selfish jackass who would rather DE someone's upgrade because it's not their BiS then it wont help him at all.
---
Rolled Horde
---
That is... classic :)
---
Yeah you hit the nail on the head.
---
You only get to tank raids if your the GM or raid lead. 
---
But at the same time the guild will tell you "go tank to help others BiS, but we wont bring you for raids"
---
225 skinning allows you to skin up to 45 level enemies. Save the gold for now
---
It's not that simple and there is finesse involved.  The mobs in there slap pretty hard on a cloth user. The biggest issue with gear is running out of mana before they die, can be fixed with mana pots, but then your cutting into profits.
---
Installing them seems fine, no issues in the addon list as well but it doesn't show up in-game... Anything I've could've missed?
---
I saw a boomkin in IF the other day. The first one I've seen since launch. I was beginning to think they had been removed from the game.
---
I agree with you. I can play about 2hrs per 2-3 days so I couldn't enjoy classic like wow. Most of the time I would wait for mob or wait for dung group.
---
BFA is not perfect but I enjoy it because I can do a lot in this 2hrs
---
Entirely depends on your server. Go check the AH.
---
ive seen 2 carapaces drop and still 0 mainhands AMA
---
Neeeerrrrddddddddd
---
I mean, the lore was already a garbage retconned mess starting with The Burning Crusade.
---
Phwoar does it work with ranged auto attack!?
---
It’s true.  And you know those are the same guys who will bitch out a tank for rolling on BiS items like HoJ or just simply not even invite you at all.
---
Little secret—you can tank any instance save for DM/UBRS as either full fury or arms.
---
Yeah i could live with that (although i pretty much only do guild runs anyway)
---
Yes!
---
no shatter yiiiiiiiikes
---
Why would you use that oO
---
I'm sorry. I didn't know that things like this are not welcome at all.
---
IF is also the closest cap to BRM.
---
Why would I lul
---
He's not wrong, it's like you're flooded with gold the second you hit 40. I went from missing about 60g (non AoE-ing mage things) to having enough to pay my friend back 90g (50% interest because why not) within 3 levels.
---
Reporting these does matter. To play classic you need account with sub, retail wont do. Just report them all, they will eventually run out of assets
---
I absolutely will try your Fury dual wield berserk spec. Anything is better than what I have at the moment. Cooking is 260, so doing the food thing helps. I spent days grinding the wolves in Ferelas. Finding the sweet spot for mob level against character level is a challenge. Thanks for the heads up.
---
I'm sure more slimy events like this will occur. I'll definitely give it a shot!
---
Hello fellow human rogue. I just got mine off.... Hey, wait a minute!
---
Content bis OH dagger is CHT which is 1.6
---
Getting hit capped is not really feasible for a while until later phases.  Also min hit =/= hit cap
---
It's doable on a Priest too. But then you only kill the lashers. With herb and essence of life prices down, I think the gold/h is around 40-45 now. Well worth it for a priest though, especially if you are disc/holy specced for raids already. Without herbalism it's closer to 30g/h.
---
Joker deleted the first lvl 60 character. I'm not sure if he regrets it though.
---
None of retails real PvE content has a queue.
---
Have been doing the same thing for over a month now, here some more stats in case anyone is interested.
---
Not all numbers are 100% correct. I can't find any statistic about how many Masks I've actually crafted, so I've taken the number of Bleach bought instead. That number is at **1526**, considering a 30sec craft time per mask, that's 45780 seconds, or 12.7166 hours spent crafting. Not including posting auctions / disenchanting etc.
---
Before you wonder how the hell I can spend so much time crafting those masks: I work from home and can just start crafting for an hour, come back, mail it to my disenchant alt and repeat. I have plenty of semi-afk /played time...
---

Is it worth it? I guess it depends on the time you have. If you're like me and can just log in to do this while doing something else, yes. If you have limited time to play, you're better off just spending that time farming.
---
Totally guilty of this lol
---
Imho, raids are not easier, people just got better. 15 years of theorycrafting and, voila, there is no mystery in what bosses do. Players know the one spec that works, healers sport healing specs, all tanks in def, damage dealers have dps meters. The only time a dungeon was challenging (in classic) was when group was at or below the recommended level. Pity :)
---
yeah I didnt want to drop it but I wanted clearcasting.  Have done zf and lasher farm without so should be fine
---
How do you figure it's a bigger benefit?
---
Hahaha, dont worry we will Get rid of the leather with chromatic boots and lionheart and flamguard gauntlets+ titanic leggings etc
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=14185/preparation
---
In my mind they ruined the game when they changed the talents from talent Tree to three choices
---
So you played for an hour?
---
Can't be that hard, just mark up the targets, plenty of body language and emotes possible. I'm sure it went fine.
---
I'm not strictly sure, but I think I remember swimming around the continent to get to Menethil. Certainly safer, and there's always that weird cabin that's empty except during noon time when there's an NPC standing on the ceiling, facing the corner. When you enter the cabin he dies. Then the news mentions something about a player who died in front of their PC while WoW was glitching for them.
---
... How? The proc only adds armor and defense.
---
QS is a relic of a time when skills could crit and broodlord lashlayer demanded 440 defense unless you wanted to get 8k mortal striked. This was changed in 1.9
---
Right now, qs is an alright option but straight up worse than almost any other raid weapon for threat. Brutality blade is better and drops in mc if we're talking swords strictly, and so is vis'kag. Both are mainly dps weapons though, as such I'd let your dps get em first.
---
If you're non human, don't bother with it. Sell it, use the gold for some other stuff. Get yourself a pair of aged core leather gloves or a muggers belt and go dagger, or just grab eskhanders.
---
The point is that there's no need to vanish or FD. Once MC breaks the guards will stop attacking you.
---
Yeah, they should have done faction queues from the very start.
---
Not spending is #1. After than, there are places where mages can frost aoe farm humanoids which give coins, vendor junk, and cloth.
---
I think this only refers to quest items, as in no more waiting in a que for your turn to kill that specific elite mob, with 3 more groups behind you.
---
Nothing. 
---
Right now, if we're being perfectly honest, being level 60 is boring. It's mostly logging in, watching LFG, and hoping that there's a group wanting to do a dungeon that you want to do, or some guild is hosting a raid. In the meantime, you can either farm mats, or level an alt. That's not really an endgame worth talking about. None of the dungeons or raids are really all that challenging, so the only real activity that takes any effort at this point is finding 4 other people, or 9 if you wanna do UBRS, willing to run a dungeon.
---
Retail has a lot of endgame, and is almost wholy focused on it, sometimes to the detriment of everything else. You can very easily find a Mythic+ group with LFG, do a raid with LFR, do some max level questing with world quests, etc. There's almost too much to do currently in BFA, although arguments can be made about how fun those activities are. That endgame is also always as hard as you can handle, with mythic+ keys and 4 raid difficulties making sure that you're always facing challenging content.
---
At this point, the two are kinda different games. Classic is very much about the journey. Levelling to 60 is a real accomplishment, but once you get there you really only have a handful of max level quests and some simple dungeons to keep you occupied. Retail is entirely about the destination. Everything pre-120 is meaningless, the goal is to hit max level and start grinding towards completing content that constantly increases in difficulty. Neither of those ideas is "wrong." However, they're opposing ideals, and they require completely separate design philosophies. In Classic, you want classes to be different, so that you can experience their intricacies as you level them and really feel unique. However, on Retail classes need to be homogenized in order to be balanced, because otherwise having harder content leads to people getting benched in raids. Making a mount an accomplishment makes sense on Classic, but on Retail you want players to have it at level 1 so they can get to max faster. There's plenty more examples available.
---
Both games exist very separate to each other, and I think that's good. I don't necessarily think that Retail should start trying to become Classic, and I desperately hope nobody from Retail starts working on Classic+. I don't think either are perfect, but neither are bad. They're just different.
---
'&gt;:(
---
Blizzard support absolutely sucks compared to vanilla and retail.
---
They can’t do shit except CTRL+C Ctrl+V canned responses.
---
Only way to get clicks is through bait. I really wish they would stop exaggerating about how much they earn honestly, but that wont happen.
---
Is [Executioner's Cleaver](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13018/executioners-cleaver) actually a valuable item, and if so how do I determine how much I should be trying to sell it for? Auctioneer is telling it's seen 13 with market price of 47g. I tried doing WTS in trade chat and got one offer of 10g which I didn't take because I wasn't sure if that was a fair offer or not. Currently none in the AH on Blaumeux so having a hard time figuring this out.
---
Screenshots? Proof? Anything?
---
The game has only been out for a few months. We have no idea if it will continue to have the player base into the next phases that it has now. Time was the issue, people eventually got bored and the vanilla fans got older and had less time to play. They had to adapt to draw in new crowds.
---
Right now, we’re all making time for classic and a lot of us are probably ignoring a lot of other responsibilities in our life because the wave of nostalgia is so strong. We’ll see if that lasts.
---
So...there's this trick some people do (people with no lives clearly) where they stand in front of the AH, hit search with an empty search box, and then just eye all the latest auctions. They immediately snatch up anything undervalued to sell at a proper price.
---
 ... Which any and every mc and ony weapon can keep up with or outdoes with additional dps stats, like Corehound tooth which had crit, ap and stam on it, or viskag which has more dps and an alright proc.
---
Qs isn't good. It's a cool looking option if you haven't had any luck so far. Since spells can't crit after 1.9 and we're on 1.12 it's pretty obsolete once you're raiding, which you need to do anyway to get it.
---
Lol at the massive tea bag fail
---
This, but times five because five working days.
---
I mean, you saying that just means you don't know how many things you can fuck up when doing AOE farming.
---
Is LTP also doing the silver dragon portrait?
---
Wetlands is best, then you can do stockades, go to duskwood, do gnomeregan, hillsbrad, shimmering flats, stv north, desolace, stv south, dustwallow, badlands, feralas. You might have to grind a bit towards the end.
---
Wait, what is the acronym
---
1. Too much forced story in Retail that isn‘t told the subliminal way but rather bam - in your face.
---
2. You are the hero, a god amongst Tauren, in retail, which is a boring, overused concept. We were simple adventurers once!
---
3. Legendary item system in retail.
---
4. Older gear plays no role in retail, whereas in classic,there are tons of items that are not max level which are relevant at max level.
---
5. Welfare epics in retail; everyone get them, so they aren‘t special anymore.
---
So to fix retail, Blizzard simply has to get rid of all these things.
---
Ewwy you must be one of the few running lightwell lol
---
My best guess is if he was rushing it that bad, perhaps he was the sort to move from area to area doing nothing but farming mobs?
---
That’s a HUGE variance and tells me that those numbers are bogus. 
---
Furthermore, the game has been out for a few months. The sub count will begin to dwindle again as people stop shirking their responsibilities for wow. For example I have to get back to studying for the CPA and will probably not have any time to play anymore as the audit busy season approaches.
---
Maybe better to ask in retail sub?
---
Priest are able to Mana burn druids in form too, you just have to begin cast before he switches in.
---
But a GM i asked stated that is how it wars, its abit hard to belive for me i played priest all the time and tryed stuff out and never known it worked.
---
What was the addon? Maybe there are better, working alternatives.
---
Depending on the devilsaur leather market on your server / amount of competition in un’goro skinning can be really good money at max
---
odd i got updates and still doesnt work :\\
---
what about this? https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/230005--02350233132251351
---
I think there's already risk in the download size. That's gonna take you years. Any chance you can upgrade the RAM?
---
Ironically enough it happens in BFA with high level Mythic+, not in Classic.
---
Ah, you're probably right.
---
What do you mean? Classic and retail are through the same subscription.
---
I agree that TBC improves on vanilla, but 'maintaining difficulty in PvE content'? It much improves upon the difficulty, because classic PvE is mindnumbingly simple, esp. with 1.12 tuning for dungeons and the early raids. Vanilla wow was in many ways a difficult game due to the limitations of the day (lack of experience for most of the playerbase, worse balance and tuning than 1.12, lots of bugs, lack of information, bad connections and PCs), but even then the dungeons and raids, at least before BWL, were considered kinda pedestrian. I remember thinking PvP was much more fun than PvE back then, because the majority of the PvE content was just tank and spank with very few impactful mechanics. MC was called 'the Molten Bore' even back in 2005 because of how simple it was.
---
I'm really looking forward to classic TBC, because all the available PvE content so far is pretty damn boring when you consider them as encounters. I imagine AQ and Nax will spice things up a little bit, but even then it's mostly just harder tuning, not more difficult or complicated mechanics.
---
I have felt the same.  I'm 8 days in.  I'd  say go for it. It's not p2w, the folks seem decent,  servers are active. I'll be renewing my subscription.  :)
---
Retail has higher hardware requirements than classic WoW. I'm unsure about how well it will run on such a low end laptop, but probably not great even on lowest settings, unless you are okay with low fps.

What the hell is an RTS?
---
lol just joking about how this sub is always complaining about people "exploiting".
---
when they avoid guards in towns even when its something as simple as jumping on a crate.
---
Please don’t tank for me
---
This clip could have been 20 seconds long, and we could have avoided the non-English spamming and XDDD
---
Hunter:
---
Could solo most content up to 60 by just kiting any elites for quest. Generally a breeze to level. Win most pvp engagement where there’s lots of free space to move around in.
---
If I can slip in a negative: the minmax crowd really killed my urge to play hunter. I must start every single grp my self. No one invites a hunter. They rather wait an extra 15-20min to find the right class.
---
BFA feels like it got so much daylie or weekly shit that you "should" be doing just for the sake of having content. Having this open end kind of item that you're supposed to keep lvling is something that seems utterly pointless and unsatisfying to me. In classic I don't feel like I'm forced to be doing something at all. I can go dungeons whenever I want and I don't feel like I'm missing out on something when I don't run dungeons at all for a week. In BFA I feel like I HAVE to run these dungeons and this is just really really annoying and kills the fun of the game. Classic is diffrent it feels chill and it's fun, even if my class didn't got alot of fancy ability's. Also I think the community and the interactions you have is just different from the BFA and this is something that makes the game alot more fun.
---
Is there a guide anywhere on getting into raiding once you hit 60? I feel pretty lost and overwhelmed about what dungeons to run and when I should start raiding/what I need. I pretty much get lost after BRD. Levelling a rogue on Arugal.
---
The spirit of the game is everyone needs on BoEs
---
&gt; You said that most people didn’t feel that way.
---
Please excuse me, but I can't see where he said that.
---
One place he said this:
---
&gt; Just because some people bitched about things doesn't mean the entire playerbase felt that way.
---
... which isn't the same at all.
---
&gt; If you don't get the exact same stats every time you get the exact same piece of gear, then you have to grind until you get the stats you need, instead of searching for a particular piece with the stats you need.
---
Soooo, like a lock/sp/mage in Classic?
---
I see you played tanks and healers only.
---
If you haven't seen the original crendor vids they're pretty fucking great.
---
I don’t lol. I also feel attached to my character now and already have a lot of great memories meeting people with that character.
---
Hello, what addon or WA show your barrier absorb amount?
---
Iirc it's actually a backronym (can't recall what it was originally short for) but I've known it to mean "mere ordinary beast"
---
Warrior from vanilla here
---
None of that happened, it was the same as now
---
Just trade then when they try to skin, it cancels it
---
Macro that shit
---
nope
---
killed her the last 3 weeks without any problems
---
but stick on the fireball tactic and keep on wiping
---
Hello, sharing a ZF speed run I completed with some cool peeps we had a 2h tank and some serious damage being put out was fun cleaving!
---
It’s a bit of a pain to get people to use, but it’s very efficient.
---
Wanna talk about those beautiful gloves?
---
You missed the point. He meant mythic+ and mythic raids.
---
A lot of people hate BC and Wrath, both games were trash and heralded the end of WoW.
---
So what your replying to is saying specifically about your shift modifier. Lets say this is you 1 key binding
---
You can go system&gt; keybinds&gt; find an empy spot and set it to shift-1
---
Then put taunt in the new shift 1 keybind on your action bars
---
Then you can remove the shift mod from the macro
---
No you play the game how you want. I'll never berate you for trying to minmax. But if you're treating other players like shit for not minmaxing we're gonna have a problem.
---
I use WeaponSwingTimer (using the Hunter option) thanks for tuning in!

anytime, if you have more question . feel free to pm me

/r/woooosh
---
Ohh boohoo
---
Good job on the ass to leg tea bagging.
---
Just for anyone worried about getting the drop - even at only 10% drop rate, you only need to run the dungeon 4 times to have a 70%+ chance of getting the pattern.
---
How to get these masks?
---
Absolutly. People can do what they want as long as they dont break ToS. And I can act acordingly.
---
Ah, didn’t see the “real”. 
---
There’s still definitely a wait time though.
---
they paid like $8 for domain xd
---
....go trick or treating. You might win one. It's not hard. And don't forget to bob for apples!
---
Pushed “0” one time to much In my addon: result. Bought 10x as much silk thread as I needed. Around 30g out the window.
---
no, but, honestly, i think it makes you a worse healer then if you didn't use it.
---
There's nothing wrong with this statement, I'd just add that for retail to be a truly rewarding experience you need a core group of people to do Mythic + content with. A close friend has been letting me use his account to play classic until I have enough for my rig/subscription. He only asked that I join him in retail to run Mythic + content with him once I have my rig/sub. Reasonable request, and although I have a hard bias towards classic, I'm willing to enhance my friends retail experience if I can. Nothing wrong with enjoying both.
---
... and a leatherworker, who sold them both thouse devilsaur leggings.
---
He didn't come across a decent mage haha
---
That's what I meant. The pve wasn't mindless spamming, each classes had at least a somewhat complex dps rotation to maximize buff uptimes.
---
Karazhan was very challenging if you did it at regular gear level. Probably tougher than most encounters in Naxx/AQ40.
---
TBC is something i can see myself enjoying for a solid year.
---
I paid 191g for the Robe of the Archmage pattern when the instance layer switching was still a thing. The price dropped to like 50g a few days later, still regret it to this day, even though I made a shit ton of gold by switching out tailoring for alchemy after I crafted it.
---
Brb rerolling as pally.
---
Please go be late to another conversation, lmao.
---
/cringe and blocked
---
Ruined my marriage :(
---
He farmed his own Mageweave Cloth and said offloading them took time so adding that extra profit on top of it is just extra for something that is mostly AFK.
---
... and finally a skinner, who never intended his trade good to contribute to something like that.
---
You can try delete your WTF folder, but this will reset all your add-on data. This is probably what blizzard will tell you to do first.
---
Have I got a deal for you!
---
Weakauras retail version, maybe it works for Classic? https://wago.io/EyIVaqp9f

Crowd control.
---
I think it stops resists but not miss

Dropping r-bombs in 2019? That says everything I need to know about you. Reported and goodbye forever.

Spawn timer 32/36-48h, only one on all layers, so at some hours 1/4 chance.

Ive heard that some bosses are less likely than others but i cant verify it forsure myself.

Thats crazy. Dont they respawn really fast in 1.12?
---

---
Tank fury prot, like a real warrior.
---
mobile objects
---
Is an owl better than a wind serpent for AoE threat?
---
I did the normal thing a 60 warrior should do.
---
Spec prot and farm for gear.
---
Easy and fast groups because so many people need tanks.
---
If your healer isn't the party leader
---
Seven hours holy fuck
---
Are you sure that was wotlk? Agro became faceroll in that expansion, it was the rise of active mitigation.
---
How it's even possible for a Frost Mage to lose to a warrior.
---
Just farm the gold and buy them
---
Eh, relying on RNG is just impractical. Bosses hit very hard and if you didn't dodge/parry/block a couple hits in a row because of bad RNG, you'd be dead if you didn't go for the max EH (Armor/Stam) build. 
---
Hit %/rating is/was one of the best stats for most (if not all?) DPS specs for a similar reason. You can ignore it and stack other stats and hope you don't miss, but if the RNG is bad you'll miss multiple times and thus do much less DPS.
---
Common leather is dependent on the level of the mob, just to give you an idea.
---
I'm not sure if there are any addons for that. In the meantime here's a skinning guide, at the bottom half of the guide it lists rare/unique leathers. https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/skinning-classic-wow-1-300
---
Apparently this fury warrior speciman doesn't know that.
---
&gt; I guess the logic is that you use arcane explosion a lot more than you get hit by by melee opponents? 
---
Yea that's true. But I prefer the 1 point in AR over IAE because I facetank a lot. When 20 zombies hit you, AR might save your life, whereas IAE likely won't (and I'm not using AE a lot in ZF - Nova, 3x Blizzard, CoC, Nova, FS, CoC kills everything for me).
---
I didn't mean "peak" as in "it was top dps". I meant the class fantasy.
---
Keeping (up to) 5 dots active, all with different durations, + haunt and the occasional filler spell/nightfall procc thrown in was fun and you always had something to do/keep track of.
---
Siphon Life only being there for sustain is completely fine. Removing it because it's not doing fat deeps and for people who can't be arsed to learn their class is exactly the reasoning that lead us to retail.
---
The idea is to make friends and associates, inside and outside your own guild, who you interact with and party with regularly while you level together. Then by the time you reach 50 or so, you have the bones of a raid team already and it's not hard to find others who know you already and trust you because you were worthwhile friends with them throughout the levelling phase. It is not a single player game.
---
The nose looks like a mouth and I can't unsee it help
---
Mega ornery bitch
---
It’s been 15 years &amp; I still haven’t got one, looks to be the same for u too 😂😂😂
---
 hope u got it tho
---
We asked for retail.
---
It wasn't all at once, but the first two expansions brought *objective* improvements to the game (at the time). These improvements were heavily requested by the players or they were solutions to problems that Blizzard invented and were applauded for (at the time).
---
It's not like it happened over night. It took a long time and plenty of problems that needed solutions. Right now we know the outcome is bad. But if they were to progress Classic into 1.13, the first things people will ask for are the same things they asked for back at TBC (viable specs, better itemization, QoL stuff like instant mail to alts, ...etc).
---
It's a natural progression. WoW today resembles what the current day MMO market looks like. Streamlined theme-parks. WoW Classic resembles the older MMO style of being closer to an RPG.
---
Cause blizzard doesnt like hunters
---
Turned out to be incorrect. I soloed to the Black Forge yesterday.
---
[What I thought of when I saw this.](https://youtu.be/UB0F_Jah_R4?t=1m20s)
---
War axe is a lot faster though, which is not good for mortal strike but fine for white hits.
---
Ah I see your confusion. He has friendly nameplates turned on and you're used to nameplates only being over enemies. This was intra-factional griefing.
---
I don't think weapon class matters. What matters is the dmg, speed and stats.
---
A miserable little pile of secrets.
---
Legolazx tells you "heal you fucking retard" but you have ignored his chat messages.
---
TF FTW
---
Faerlina still has 1+ queues at peak times.
---
And then take to reddit with it all
---
I think a huge problem is acessability for everyone. 
---
Classic has keys for dungeons to carry in your bag, attument quests for raids that take few hours, walk to a dungeon and wait for group- what feels very good for character progression.
---
Retail has premade group finder for dungeons and raids, every newb can join, instant teleport to dungeon - totally takes the charm of difficulty and achievment.
---
I farmed herbs and bought runecloth. I probably spent over 1k on the runecloth alone.
---
Hubert Cumberdale, you smell like spot and poo.
---
The problem when talking about something you don’t know is you look horribly stupid when you end up being wrong, like you just did. Luckily the circlejerk is here to back you up, so you can safely accuse people without evidence and still get your upboats.
---
I thought about it, but honestly I'm scared of go-go-go mentality, especially after Classic dungeon groups (not of them are ideal, but mostly they are quite chill and friendly). I just don't want to dive into a cesspool of toxicity modern WoW has become with time.
---
ItemRack or whatever it's called for equipment switching.
---
how are you doing man
---
Prepare you crowbar, just in case :D
---
Seems like you ignore rational thought as well, seeing as you don't know how to take a screenshot.
---
I've had so many "Damn, there are some genuinely beautiful spots in this game" moments playing through classic. Like, I've actually stopped and just appreciated the scenery more than a few times. It's such a surreal experience compared to back when I last played retail.
---
Definitely soinds like a journey to me...
---
list your addons here. easier to help if you do
---
the thing that upset me the most in all of this is the fact that your error speech sounds are on.
---
fuck you
---
Firemaw is one.
---
Not anymore, she's pretty much one of the biggest name in video game culture.
---
Or paladins.
---
I mean honestly you just shouldn’t holy paladins at all really unless you want a 15 min fight followed by getting absolutely nothing for your troubles.  Especially if you’re melee.
---
Mages *would* scare me but I’ve literally never been successfully counterspelled by one.  They always fall for the juke / dartols.
---
I healed it fine at 59 with shit gear on both me and my warrior friend. Enjoy spending 30min looking for a tank with plate only gear while I just cleared the dungeon in that time.
---
We did. And theres screenshots on staysafes twitter
---
In Prat, turn off "color names everywhere" option in "playernames"
---
Zandalar Tribe RPPvP feels very balanced.
---
&gt; can be fixed with mana pots
---
Mana gems?
---
Yeah but the difference here is that in retail you have to go out of your way and queue that mode specifically to get that experience. In classic its much more built into the entire world
---
Way too linear and railroaded. The perfect example of terrible zone design.
---
GZ :)
---
Thank you, already knew that but I tought about something like [Item Tooltip Professions](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25160-ItemTooltipProfessionIcons.html) addon. I have estimated knowledge about what drops what but I don't want to alt-tab all the time to make sure that this dragon drops scales and this not. You know what I mean.
---
I would love this. WoW is an interactive world, we need to know who doesn't need to be interacted with a y longer. Already made a personal list... but nowhere to broadcast it.
---
Used To crowbar those fuckers in hl2 !
---
Lol I like how you change your argument twice to dodge the fact you are just wrong. Then throw out an insult to try and be condescending. If you fap the mage can't poly, you pummel it. They can't space you if you pummel poly they can't blink. If they blink and try to polly you intercept, if they some how still get space and start another cast you intimidating shout, crystal of jinthalor, taunt a nearby mob, skull of impending doom, and many, many other answers...
---
Also warrior trinket doesnt break poly so I don't get why you are saying that it stops poly hard counter. Unless you are so ignorant on how pvp warrior works you actually don't know what their trinket removes in which case... lol...
---
And seems like u dont know anything about pvp
---
Retail graphics are more demanding, so that might be a problem.
---
Which is pointless
---
Has nothing to do with being an asshole
---
I just don't see a reason whatsoever to play retail even less now that classic is here
---
In the settings there is a new thing where it will run a /who query when you click in the world. It's a way to get around the auto limitations.
---
The server discord i am on (Ashbringer PvP) says it's 60/40 alliance/horde but i feel like it's balanced. Without official data it's pretty hard to say though.
---
"Hey let me trade you real quick so I can take a shit quality photo with my phone!"
---
And you're back at the same problem when trash is harder to deal with than the actual bosses haha
---
Awesome, ty!
---
Horde - EU - Bloodfang - PvP
---
I have a 60 rogue already and alts for every class between 15-35. I´m tired of playing mostly alone and am looking for some guys who feel the same and want to team up.
---
Doesn't matter if you do any of those things. You've decided to label yourself as part of a group that does those things, and have gone as far as to make a post complaining that people are talking shit about this broad group of people (not you, individually) that you've willingly declared yourself as being a part of. At this point you're just looking for a fight rather than minding your business.
---
yea its the TSM thing
---
Ive seen bankalts afk at the AH a lot
---
Im sure its an automated thing
---
Exactly my point.
---
Well, if you somehow only have awareness of NA conditions and that is all you care about, another poster stated that Faerlina still experiences significant queues.
---
One does not simply run "a couple dungeons" and have a Dal'rends.
---
Damn 6k mana how? I have a blue set with 1 epic and only have 5.5k
---
including bwl for Vael
---
Thanks. I hate it :)
---
You typed a book at me to say that poly doesn't counter FAP.
---
"Well if the warrior uses skull of doom or taunts a mob as the poly goes off!" What mob? This is the middle of a fucking town. What skull of impending doom? You think every warrior just carries that around?
---
You literally spent 5 hours thinking on this to "own me" but you look like an EVEN BIGGER TOOL then you already did dude.
---
Just stop talking dude, you lost 5 hours ago and it's fucking sad you keep coming back to get beat over and over.
---
I mean you're blocked anyway since you keep sending me fucking creepy PM's
---
Name of set?
---
Are you trying to get me to go talk to a fury echo chamber? Cause i'm good, the only reason i'm commenting on this thread is because someone who cares about playing arms might read it. But the fury minded elitist will just downvote away. But next phase most warrs will be playing arms or paying a shit ton of gold per week.
---
I thought you were talking about me, until the mad part, and double Dal'rends. 
---
I had a level 45ish priest open trade with me in Ironforge and I was like "uhh, I'm not a rogue guy, I can't open this for you".
---
i am catching onto the fact that dal rend's mh is a lie created by blizzard to keep all the rogues and dps warriors playing for easy subscriber money. the players i've seen with the mainhand are plants by blizzard to further support this lie
---
Sorry retard, dal'rends are still pre-raid bis level for hunters.
---
You're inbred and stupid as fuck sonny.
---
Fuck all
---
I've been r10 on every server. I have dueled around 5-10 hours a week minimum since the release of classic. And participated in large scale pvp today in ungoro. As well I have probably around 70%winrate in 1v1s in open world as warrior. I am not the ignorant one lol. But yeah make wild claims to try and discredit me, maybe itll work if you insult me to.
---
OLD AF
---
Lol this fucking retard honestly thinks Arms can beat Fury in a flat out dps contest.
---
Holy shit that's the funniest fucking thing i've ever seen
---
dont u run out of mana before you can deplete your entire bar? So casting faster just makes you oom faster?
---
I guess it depends on the server.
---
On mine it was like a daily chore for epics
---
1) I wouldn't recommend switching to prot until UBRS and other max level instances, I'm currently 58 and have tanked everything up to LBRS just fine as arms spec.
---
3) Wowhead has a comprehensive list of quests available for every instance and I'm sure they have instance guides as well, otherwise just try to get into a group and ask if anyone knows the way, that's why I did my first 2-3 runs and got the hang of it by then.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/dungeon-quests-classic-wow
---
Lol why would anyone do that.  Literally zero interest in retail.
---
Do you guys do slayer oaths too?
---
Install an addon that lets you see your mana bar while you're in a form. I use shadowed unit frames, but there are probably others that do the same thing.
---
This are just 2 casts. Earth shock is on gcd and this way it casts highest earthshock if you gave enough mana and lowest if not.
---
    #showtooltip
---
    /cast Earth Shock
---
    /cast Earth Shock (Rank 1)'
---
Something like that.
---
do you own / manage your own network connection or is it a shared / managed by someone else?
---
Thanks, \*
---
I am alliance :D
---
I’ve run to SM twice today, been 1 shot by the Aboms outside Burning Man twice as well. Guess I’ll never learn. 
---
But in my defense, I literally had no idea there was a burning man reference in WoW till I saw it the second run, and ya, I was kinda admiring when I went and got Patchwerk’d by them
---
I feel like this is missing a few huehuehues
---
There was no insult, no degrading word, no cuss word.
---
Paladin perspective: obviously having at least 13 in holy is pretty beneficial from like 40+ but you really don’t need it at all until ur doing endgame dungeons with low gear.
---
Priest is roughly the same.  However if I was leveling a priest I would go 5/5 and then the rest in holy until 40 then respec shadow.  Largely because you gain like almost nothing when you’re questing by going full shadow but going holy gives you quite some benefit in dungeons - even if it’s not required.
---
Once ur 40 though the best leveling spec is def shadow.  You really don’t *need* to respec for dungeons until endgame dungeons.  And I don’t mean brd- I mean like brs and strat/scholo/dm etc.
---
Lineage got this flashy solo-oriented way too. I think it was just the mainstream to simplify the core user experience in the game industry (at least mmo's).
---
I know it’s fun and all, but dpswarriors sucks for dungeons. Rather take 3 mages and a priest any day of the week.
---
Won't make it untrue.
---
Lmao. Because I said someone was bad a at video game? That's actually sad on your end.
---
What are those masks?
---
Original uses a pillow.
---
Good point, on the up side sounds like he could certainly join temporarily as it's easy to come and go.
---
T3 warrior, priest, hunter and shaman look sick though
---
Cheeseburgers for breakfast?!
---
With all the aggros, double packs and pats in farm dungeons being able to tank everything without having your healer dying is a deep Prot perk though.
---
Not saying I'm not going fury prot when I'll be full raid gear but atm, the slow and steady with no money spent on respecs for raids (if you have a MT spot) is very good. Just accept to always play in group.
---
Just remove 3 points from piercing ice and put them into shatter plus the one point you should have left anyways (your build is only lvl 59). It's not like 6% damage will make or break your MC raid.
---
It's not. All low level epics seem very cheap. Some might go up when bgs are released because of twinking though.
---
I'm not saying "Give Brutality Blade to a tank first and foremost", but eventually your DPS - especially on Hordeside - are done gearing for it in particular (Orcs want DB or Spinal Reaper mostly, maybe OEB and thus you're left with Rogues wanting Brutality Blade)
---
If you're non-Human, Eskhanders is a very solid option that does not cost 1500 gold.
---
If you're Human, QS is pretty solid because of its weapon DPS but the proc might as well not exist. If you're gearing for 440 Defense in any way you're doing it wrong.
---
If you don't know about Windfury clipping and still claim fast weapons are bad then you ought to look into that, or ask the Fight Club Discord about it, but very brief TL;DR: Fast weapons can abuse the way Spellbatching works that makes your attacks also get the AP buff from Windfury, which is quite a lot. Weapons like Bonescraper are awesome because of that.
---
Instead of CHT you could also get Gutripper, which isn't all that desired by rogues and Hunters either and also doesn't cost 1500 gold and requires a fairly lengthy questline.
---
QS is not the be-all-end-all option you claim it is. It's decent for humans because of Sword spec, and if you have 2000 gold laying around, or are decently lucky you can go Edgemaster + QS, sure. 
---
But WoWheads "BEST WEAPON UNTIL NAXX" shows how few they know and overhypes the weapon greatly.
---
52 arms warrior, about to respecc to prot. 
---
1) how much does the tank rotation change with shield bash? 
---
2) where can I get a good 1h sword? I got the shield from ST, good on that part 
---
3) I was planning on entering BRD now. Any good resources to learn about the dungeon, where to go, which routes, what quests I need? (first time playing)
---
Shamlife!
---
This gave me chills..
---
I used to agree 100% with this - and then we started raiding. I've farmed my pre-bis already, tanking for most of it, but I'm now in a spot where I'd love to tank dungeons for my guildies, but I just can't hold threat in a reasonable manner. I'm still wearing a sort of thrown together tanking set that has some very nice blues in it, but it's nowhere near even prebis, and they're wearing multiple epics on top of their mostly prebis, same as my dps gear.
---
I find that I get obliterated damage-wise in UBRS, Dire Maul, and Strat, even when I manage to hold threat for a while. All of these issues completely vanish when I'm prot specced.
---
I've largely stopped tanking for that reason. It kind of sucks, but I'm not about to shell out gold for regular respecs.
---
The 20 dps staff from the WC quest Leaders of the fang. I had it on a 15 warrior, it is sick.
---
haven't seen saladfingers since before classic.  lmao.
---
yeah boi!
---
Is improved overpower 2 something you'd pick over rage management?  Reading rage management seems underwhelming any practical uses that I'm neglecting?
---
The point about reporting to blizzard is so they know the patterns goldsellers use and can thus improve their systems to account for it
---
Horde tried to organize something similar but barely anyone RPs, or PvPs.  :(
---
The issue isn't epics like candy, it's about the progression curve from where you are to where you want to be. Epics are just a shorthand way of saying "high quality item" and that has lost all meaning in todays game tbh but that's not the point I'm trying to make.   
---
Earlier versions of the game had a curve which started off slow and then flattened out into essentially a straight line. It was difficult to get gear in the beginning, but eventually each piece you needed to get to the next level was then linear progression from there.   
---
Todays gearing functions more like an Asymptote, gear is heavily frontloaded onto you which gives you your "base", and then it takes increasingly larger time investments (on average) to get subsequent pieces. E.g. Once I have to rely on titanforges to get upgrades, I now need to be lucky in three different ways for any item to be useful, and for each item slot I fill with a titanforged piece, that reduces the chance the next piece I get will be useful.   
---
This also has the effect of desensitising you to the joy of getting an item, and to be honest I think the vast majority of players will eventually pick a point where they decide they're done and will just stop playing.  
---
I think this is compounded by Blizzard using items and gear as a crutch to keep people playing instead of engaging gameplay.
---
Oh my god, WHITEBEARD IS ALIVE!!!
---
Nice run. What kind of spec are you using?
---
Big trick definitely not treat
---
Has anyone else been keeping track of their dungeon stats? I've found DBM to be amazing for tracking how many times I've actually run, for example, Angerforge farms.
---
It's also been useful in general to see how many dungeons I've run compared to my own notes on how many toxic/bad players I've played with.
---
Just for perspective I've run about 86 dungeons from 1-60. I've only played with 2 truly toxic players. The perspective helped take a lot of the stress away when you realize how miniscule the population of cruel people are.
---
There are horde characters on Pagle?!?
---
Living WOW to the fullest &lt;3
---
Oh my god yes. It toes the line perfectly between total chaotic clusterfuck and delicate ballet. This actually reminded me that a rogue in my guild recorded the encounter and uploaded it to YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCAMznDLwC0
---
(unfortunately, he had terrible taste in music)
---
Look at their own charts, the hit table shows +1 level mobs being 5.5% hit when their own tests came out to a flat 6%. The +2 levels miss chance was 6.2%. 
---
Their own data contradicts their formulas and you're going to blindly trust it? 
---
These equations were pulled from their ass. The real world numbers, including many of my own logs that I have analyzed show the numbers I am calculating, and others who have done similar also show this.
---
Apparently you can't do math, you would realize that you do the operations in parenthesis first: 
---
(5+(315-305))\*.2 = (5+(10))\*.2 = (15)\*.2 = %3.
---
Again, let me teach you math:
---
(5+(315-305))\*.4 = (5+(10))\*.4 = (15)\*.4 = %6.
---
This is basic arithmetic and you want me to trust your reasoning because? You can't even proof these correctly.
---
Their own hit chart contradicts their data! They show 5.5% @ 5 defense points and 6% @ 10 with no weapon skill increase! Look at their own miss calculations for +1 and +2 level creatures on the miss %. It shows for +1 @ 6% and +2 @ 6.2%, which is what I am calculating!
---
its prat :)
---
ur isp is throttling ur connection to wow maybe?
---
thanks!
---
I'm not bored at 60 at all. There is so much stuff to do. Just farming pre-bis for one spec takes a huge time, if you not playing like 8 hours per day and optimize your dungeons runs. And that is before PvP is a real thing.
---
You may want to proof read before posting. Or turn on auto correct.
---
Farmed for hours on my warlock.. yesterday I decided to solo DM north first boss. Second try worth mentoring :)
---
All this time in Ulduar is also the peak of WoW for me. I liked Naxx 40 but it felt too hard for my guild at the time. Ulduar was good progress until hard modes that were fucking interesting. I didn't raid un nerfed Black Temple enough but I could see it win the whole thing though. 
---
Mention to SSC and its requirements (tank gear on Hydross, Lock Tank on Leo), only thing that bothered me was the massive difficulty jump on Vash'j.
---
CC in shattered halls?
---
Oh, you mean constant consecration.
---
Jk, but I remember the huge drop in difficulty if you ran with a pally instead of a warrior or bear. Same thing with hyjal trash.
---
That laptop gonna get hot in raids
---
Dude has a scrotum for a forehead
---
*Cries in Hunter.*
---
What Addon is that?
---
The only thing I take issue with here is the obsoletion of content.   
---
This is an incredibly difficult obstacle to overcome from a development perspective and I don't think it's fair to criticise them harshly on this one, especially on a game that's been going in one form or another for 15 years and 7 expansions.   
---
If they redo old zones, then you run the risk of ending up with Cataclysm which was very poorly implement IMO. If you continue to add new zones then it will eventually overwhelm players if they're all kept relevant. 
---
I mean, how many people got the island expedition quest items and just left them in their bags for weeks because they couldn't be bothered to go back to old expansion zones to hand them in?   
---
And if you don't add new zones, then people will complain that they have no new areas to explore.   
---
So really it's a damned if you do and damned if you don't scenario.   
---
Personally I think that we need another apocalyptic event to close the maelstrom and reforge the continents of the world along with the level squish. And then once we've explored all the new borders of the zones and stories that unfold at them, then we can have a look at what's on the other side of azeroth.
---
Actually, you get an epic quality trinket that summons a pet that helps you in combat, and it’s on a 10 min cooldown. Pretty bitchin’.
---
Get Perdition's Blade and Core Hound Tooth and then you'll be cookin. ez...right?
---
Duel in front of IF.. oh wait u on a dead pve server
---
You can tell which ones are females because the beard is actually just nose hair.

Classics endgame is miles ahead of BFA. Historically I've been an altoholic, so since I wanted to try raiding I decided I wouldn't be leveling any alts before my Rogue hit 60. Now I'm 60, and having too much fun on my Rogue to spend much time on alts. BFA I basically hit 120 and quit, it's an utter snoozefest.
---
Yeah, I've solo healed more than a few Arms or Fury Warriors in 5 man Rend runs, I don't get the community perception.
---
Im just going to play devils advocate but couldn’t that just turn into a hate club? You could just post someones name you don’t like even though they didn’t do anything wrong. I think keeping your own list is appropriate.
---
Probably because although it contains elements of the classic community, it's far more toxic. People sharing moments that they considered important in their classic experience get shit on regularly (Examples being people sharing their epic mounts, professions maxed, dinging 60, getting their BiS, etc.) I think people came hoping this would be an extension of the classic community on reddit. What they got was an extension of the reddit community with information pertaining to classic. Just my opinion.
---
Imagine using devilsaur on ret paladin
---
You absolutely could do that at the beginning of wrath.
---
I went in scared, thinking about TBC heroics, and we absolutely wrecked place in a mix of blues, greens, and TBC epics
---
Have you tried asking them to mark targets?  
---
I usually mark targets for the first few pulls and then stop.  Sometimes people ask for more marks, sometimes they don't.
---
Original one had cloud with "Shrek 5" written on it
---
The reason classic works is on setting 3 it’s the old school graphic settings. If you turn the classic settings up to 4 and above you would see the new graphic elements from the new retail client rendered on the classic content.
---
If you can turn it up on the classic client see how it performs. You would probably be able to run through the earlier xpacs but when you get to the later content like Legion and BfA it might start to really struggle. Minimum recommenced RAM if you are using integrated graphics is 8GB (4GB if you have a dedicated gfx card).
---
I certainly am. Unfortunately I hate the game.
---
this sub is full of morons don't waste your breath
---
+
---
I imagine he was referring to the complaints in this sub which it’s not really that valid. All i see are BoE epic drops, 60% mounts, ‘stranger sent me gold in mail and realm first eye of Sul drop.
---
xD so random ROflmao
---
Not as good!
---
&gt;Valor Shoulders
---
Absolutely disgusting.
---
Besides Kalecgos, difficulty was insane. M'uru was impossible for months if you except 2 or 3 world first guilds like Nihilum at the time.
---
Thanks for the list!  The link to Azure Shoulders should be https://classicdb.ch/?item=7060 - it currently links to Icefury Wand.  Thanks again for putting this together!
---
But we do. So you're not only an asshole, you're a useless asshole.
---
Just give us shield so we don't get inerupted ^^ .to help with healing locks should always use self heals after hs/death coil/drain life and on some packs its worth it to summon VW for sacrifice shield
---
Not to be rude, but why are you playing classic then? Time investment for rewards is a huge part of the challenge of classic.
---
Create my main character on a dead rp server to avoid loginqueue.. slowchat,few raids, AH empty
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
I'd give Badlands a try. Feralas starts from 40 too.
---
Sounds like you want mograine! Coukd always use some more horde filth the sharpen my blades
---
Don't worry, your post is fine, he's just an asshole :)
---
Huh wdym? I get to BRD within like 5 minutes. I hearth to Kargath and I'm there. I need to get to Scholo or Strath? I hearth to Kargath and give a mage 1g for an UC port. I need to get to DM? I hearth to Kargath pay a mage for TB port and fly to feralas.
---
Darn in such a beautiful city !Shame its not more populated cause of location
---
Are you saying they're a bad mage?
---
Hi, Im a little late to the party but still hope to get an answer here.
---
So far, your addon is really great! 
---
But can you tell me what channels it scans? 
---
On our server the channels „world“, „general“ and „lookingforgroup“ are all used for lfg.
---
It would be neat, to have an option to set the cannels manually or scanning every available channel by default.
---
Yeah but what kind of items can you get
---

Same. I have a 5-man set and a raid set. As a tank it just feels mandatory. No one's giving me shit cause I do my job and I'm not dropping purples cause they're just better overall.
---
No way i'm wearin' more than 3% hit in 5's as a human using a sword. Doing my own min/max everyday while stockpiling plate dps for future BG's. Probably working more than the sheeps always wearing their full pre bis.
---
Learning what to crowd control, and how to sheep-break-resheep.
---
Making sure you can judge when AOE is the best thing to do, and when it isn't.
---
Getting a friends list full of tanks and healers.
---
Oh I'm aware - but I'm talking specifically about pre raid BiS lists and generally, Nightslayer was never on those even though you can just purchase them without going to a raid.
---
Not us, never us. it's always them.  Them bastards!  ruined it for us! 
---
:D
---
Grim Batol was harder than SH. I mentioned SH in a previous post of mine, too, but Cata heroics were harder because everyone was running in quest items/couple of dungeon blues mostly. They were literally nerfed in first week, so you are probably misremembering.
---
&gt; Generally speaking I charge, Bloodrage, 2x Sunder, Demo, 3x Sunder, then revenge and shield bash off cooldown pausing to reapply a Sunder when the debuff is gonna run out
---
Without Battle Shout you are loosing so much AoE arrgo.
---
Horde which zone is better? Ima stay there until 45
---
It was disappointing to see they went with the nerfed version of AV, I think with 1.12 gear and talents the pre-nerf AV would have been less grindy and just fine.
---
That is the exact build I use.  Like the other poster said, shatter doesn't work on bosses and doesn't work on blizzard, so if you're primarily raiding and AOEing this is a great build for it.
---
Top kek
---
Can you save sets in itemrack?
---
It's nice idea, but it won't catch on. Nice people are already being nice, and jerks will try and find a way to abuse it. It's like with the New Year Resolutions thing; you don't need to wait until the New Year to make a change in your life.
---
Did you get reverse whooshed? Must I really..
---
Explain why they suck please?
---
Need help avoiding burnout. I just hit level 53 as a Resto shaman. With 14hrs/level I feel like I’m going so slow to 60 but on my server, nobody wants a dps shaman so i fear it’ll be slower if i respec to enhance or elemental. I want to hit 60 but also want to play a more appealing role to me (mage and warrior). I feel like I’m regretting rolling shaman but this is my first wow play through so i don’t know if what I’m talking about is a big deal. Any help is appreciated.
---
Razorfen EU Horde, this sells for 15g on average. Found one and hoped it would help me get my lvl 40 mount. Not even close.
---
Eh, I dunno. I have Pantaloons with +8 Intellect and I honestly don't think Padre's an upgrade for me. I'm deep Holy, so -18 Spirit doesn't sound better atm.
---
He hits like a lv 69
---
Fuck man we old. To think people would ask that question :((((
---
I can't really think of many fights where there's a cleave situation for any prolonged period of time. Maybe Gehennas or Sulfuron to name a few. But yeah almost all sims are patchwerk because that's what matters most of the time. And by your stance any spreadsheet/sim I'm gonna link you will not be credible by your standards because they are indeed patchwerk (the fight club one being most prominent). If you raid in a high-end guild, I'm sure you have some logs to throw around.
---
I tried to dig up some public arms logs to have a real world perspective, but honest to god couldn't really find any. What makes it extra difficult is that warcraftlogs doesn't filter the specs.
---
I've tried flicking every option around and for some reason, my unit frames just completely disappear when I enable it.
---
[Blurry screenshot to illustrate.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/168467062447013889/635425703076167680/screen.png) My unit frames in the top left have totally disappeared and no option seems to bring them back.
---
Warrior AQ set shits on both
---
Typical mage in every instance. Then complain to me that I didn't heal them. Even though they died in a nanosecond WITH pw:shield on them
---
Interestingly all of that math is fundamentally imperfect as wow is a very "situational" game.

Every single unique talent tree, playstyle, encounter, other equip, group, statcap...

Meanwhile in my lbrs group the mage is super happy over finally looting the archmage pattern, which he already got an hour earlier when i was in a party with him on my main. 5 min later a bankalt is selling it in tradechat.

Me running into plague lands for the first time as lvl 10 undead.
---
Scarlet Crusade
---
Staysafe has been saying this since the start of the beta. Hand of rag goes to a boomkin for memes.
---
In the water? Keep your feet on the ground!
---
You are supposed to yes but I cannot seem to get the sets part to work tbh.
---
What else is there? No PvP yet, besides the odd fight every once in a while. Raiding MC/Onyxia is the only content besides farming more gold. At least with Diremaul out finally we can farm dragon slaying book.
---
Ya supposedly, I've had to get layered to fly.
---
Waited for 30 minutes and did not spawn, returned 3 hours later and still dead, then i returned next day and It's still dead, so i just have to assume its bugged
---
Badlands is where I went - plus Uldaman is there so you'll be able to LFG while you quest
---
Flightmaster Is alive and well on one of the layers, so I've had to get layered to fly
---
Free action potions last for 30s. Frost nova doesnt affect the consumer. Neither does frostbolt. I would call you what you called me but that would violate rule #2.
---
That is nothing to worry about and in line with expectations. The goal is not for each server to have massive overpopulation, but to mellow out to a normal population:  Low in the morning, Medium in the afternoon and High in the evening.  On 1 layer.
---
Completely useless specs is bad game design. Making all specs viable everywhere is not the solution to this though. 
---
The other things are not necessarily bad design. Inconveniences make rewards feel more meaningful and this is completely missing in retail. And because of loot being easily available to everyone there, they gated the best gear behind rng. That is bad game design imo.
---
Now try tanking for these groups and you figured out why the game will be dead soon.
---
Not participating in circlejerks = trolling, got it my man
---
It's nice to easy to see you have not studied bullying or pedagogy at all. The fact you call it nonsense says it all. 
---
I never said anything about bad homes or dads beating them. It's about making someone else miserable to make yourself feel better.
---
It was a extreme comparison though as I said. I doubt all people who grief in video games are real life bullies.
---
I mean yeah you can probably heal it as Shadow but why? It's 1G for your first then 5 to respec back... That seems worth it to me for a considerably easier time healing dungeons
---
Not boring ass level 19 duels?
---
And their bis is basically same as rogues and hunters. All use the same gear.
---
Oh shit I'm sorry.
---
Just don't take dps warriors if i am the warrior tank while leveling (I may take the paladin tho, for memes and utility).  
---
In dungeons i usually run for a specific item so i reserve it, wherever they need the tank items or not i don't care (most of the time they ask before rolling).  
---
On a side note: As a druid you are open to do stealth runs with rogues to do specific bosses like DM:T runs with 4 rogues.
---
Ditto. I've had wonderful encounters with pretty much all mages.
---
Obviously those 4 specs do so much damage that you don't even need tanks or healers xD
---
That's only for WotLK lfr, in TBC it was not automatic so server reputation mattered, cause even if you could list yourself up no one would invite a bad player anyway
---
Le gem
---
I'm curious if we'll get some statistics on class breakdown. It certainly feels like there are a decent amount of mages, but not as wildly disproportionate as Reddit would have me believe.
---
Until you have the gear you often need both.
---
You wanna focus int and stam for AoE farming, sp is completely irrelevant. Prebis is focussed in Single Target dps so that's not what you're looking for.
---
Hah that exact thing made me reroll to a different server a couple weeks ago. Horde kept killing Chillwind and EPL camps while I was trying to level and I kept getting ganked over and over and I logged out in ghost form and didn’t log back in.
---
Tbh I haven't had too much trouble with threat w/o battle shout, but thats primarily because the rest of my usual group is ranged and out of range to actually be affected be buffed.
---
I wanna play my pirates LEGO on this map.
---
Always glad when traitors get what they deserve.
---
I loved every second of it.
---
how on Azeroth did it take 400 mounts for you to reach that conclusion?  I would lose track after 40  :D
---
We\`re talking about raids currently. You either have an imp on passive for stam buff - or you have a buff from sacrificing you succubus. And the fight definitely will last long enough to make the difference.
---
&gt; before ~~most people were raid geared.~~ they got nerfed to the ground
---
No you dont. The group on average just gets more exp. If you have a 5 man group than everyone gets around 30% exp resultin in 150% total.
---
Expect you ignore the fact min-maxxing is fun. Farmed 350ish arena runs to get my chest because I personally had fun mindlessly farming stuff and I could deal more damage in raids.
---
They don't, though. Votes don't really mean anything outside of popularity.
---
Join a decent guild that is new player friendly.
---
Take it with a truckload of salt. But someone commented on the retail sub about the devs having a culture of change for the sake of change.
---
According to [this](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shattrath_City), you're incorrect.
---
I wouldn't recommend respeccing to Holy until 60 unless you can reliably get groups as Holy is awful for levelling when compared to Shadow.
---
I've healed all of BRD as Shadow without too much trouble. That said it does feel like you've jumped a tier in gear when you respecc to Holy and encounters become noticeably easier.
---
It can be difficult to gauge at times though as the competence of your group significantly effects how easy it is to heal, which is true regardless of level. If you are unfamiliar with what people should be doing vs what they are doing it can be easy to think this is your fault.
---
&gt;Debuff/Buff issues also don't fly when several characters from the same guild are placing highly
---
Maybe that guild brings along a shadow priest and gives debuff slot for Curse of Shadows?  
---
&gt;The gear excuse doesn't work when there are sub-60 ilevel Warlocks in the top 10
---
And? Good stat distribution is more important than ilvl. Greens "of shadow wrath" with ilvl 58 are BiS for many slots.
---
BTW, how do they even calculate their rating? Current top-5 DPS for Molten Core DPS consists of 2 moonkins, 2 shadow priests and a retri paladin. WAT.
---
Fair enough. Mana gem was enough for me with 5200 mana as fresh 60.
---
That's a good point.
---
Wolves are +0% dmg, while the highest modifier possible is +10%, is that correct?
---
I was lucky enough to get broken tooth after searching for not very long. After I got my mount found my gear very lacking, so I started researching agi items that I could attain, spent bout 20g gearing up in that sense and the rest through questing. Some say it's unnessary to buy from AH at this level and wait till 60. But Im happy with it, hitting harder now.
---
[Excuse me wtf](https://imgur.com/a/dkYRWDt)
---
Check the forum then.
---
Yeah, you\`re totally doing this by using some complex skill rotation.
---
I bet you've made tons more money by selling your funny bones.  That'll be why you never struggled for gold.
---
WotLK didn't really have LFR. Raids still had to be done on the same realm. Cataclysm introduced cross-realm LFR that worked like WotLK's Random Dungeon Finder.
---
came here to say this :)
---
Yes.
---
Details and deadly boss mods should do it
---
Yep. Cats and raptors are the highest.
---
&gt; Yeah Wrath launch was to me, peak WoW.
---
For me Launch Wrath made me quit the game. Biggest issues for me were the homogenization of classes and most importantly the PvE content.
---
Dungeons and even the raids were so piss easy. All instances cleared in the first ID when we had 25 players at level 80. Mostly wearing level 70 gear (albeit from Sunwell). With all the people praising Ulduar I maybe should have hold out until then but hey. There was no real challenge in the game for at the time.
---
Green and yellow quests give the same xp.
---
Mobs give different xp depending on your level and their level
---
Quest, no you will get the same so if its green yellow orange or red. 
---
Mobs, yes you will get less based off green vs yellow and more from Orange but at the cost of it being a harder fight for you.
---
Welcome to the pug world.
---
What are survival hunters like to play?
---
I mean , if he does bad you can always just call ICE.
---
I tried to download more but it didn't work?
---
I started at 5100 Mana and if gotucky with clearcasts it was fine, but ideally you get to a point where you don't need a single clear cast ever. I haven't done zf lately but I'm dm lasher's/satyr at the satyrs I'd say around 6500 is a comfortable spot. I'm doing it easily and relaibly at 6200 but a couple hundred more for buffer would be nice.
---
Where is the best place to get a pumpkin bag!? And how much time do I have left to get one?
---
As stated before Dustwallow, Badlands, Feralas. You can also go to Arathi, maybe some Hillsbrad if you hadn't gone there before. Desolace also has a few Qs for you.
---
Yeah there's no doubt that making LoS pulls in order to maximize the threat gen from BS (IIRC it's 55 per buffed member divided by the amount of mobs in combat with you) is a good move.
---
Might have to do with 1.12 itemization and talents in 1.1 content.
---
Well it is a new era and times have changed. Addons were used in vanilla and did even more than they do in classic. There were guides and theory crafting back then too but generally only high end raiders looked at it since it was a single forum that did it (elitist jerks)
---
If there is gold on the line, ofc ;)
---
&gt; /run UseAction(8); UseAction(9); UseAction(10);
---
That doesn't do anything either. It won't equip any of my weapons, no matter if I already wear one or not. Does it need to include the "MultiBarLeftButton" part anywhere?
---
Flying was the best change ever.
---
Go away.
---
I don't know what the drops in ST or ZF are (I don't even remember what ZF's level range is), but do the drops in ST far outclass the stuff in ZF? I got the impression the item's power progression was a little slow.
---
People today (and back in Vanilla) formed TONS of group cause they were trying to get their T-0/T-1/T-whatever sets in those dungeons and would go again and again just to get their hands on them, but the TBC gear outclasses those *fast*, what's more is that they're *guaranteed* items because they're quest rewards for those levels. Quest rewards for just simply killing trash mobs, not going to an entire dungeon with a group of 5 people because *maybe* what they want will drop and *maybe* they'll win the roll.
---
Not to mention dungeons like BRD were *long*, and people *still* run those at max level for the gear, gear that gets outclassed in outlands fast. Why would people go back to UBRS/LBRS/BRD when they can simply move to outland and get equipment that FAR outclasses it, and not just by a bit, but also much faster.
---
Additionally people *need* XP at every level and every quest they can get. If you can hit 70 while questing in outlands from level 57, chances are you're not going back to Azeroth frequently. The quests in outlands are *not* lacking, what's more is that the rewards you'll get doing those quests means you're not *desperate* for better gear. People running Strat, scholo, UBRS/LBRS and BRD are running it repeatedly cause they *need* to. The players' focus simply shifts to outlands being their new world hub, what with its never ending things for you to do (repping up, leveling up, gearing up, questing, etc.).
---
Additionally, this was my experience in Vanilla. Maybe your experience was different, but after I went through that before, I'm not eager to see it happen again.
---
I heard they vastly underestimated interest in classic at launch leading to insane queue times. It proves to me they don't "get it".
---
Yeah, I'm at 7200 mana in my AoE set and everything is much more smooth, so I definitely know what you mean.
---
What I meant with my other comment was, that I didn't experience any need for mana potion at all. And even if you needed it, it doesn't really cut into profit as he said. You can just buy some of the cheap ones, no need to use major mana pot for it.
---
I WANT to play it but when I log in I just think about the gated content and azerite armour etc and log back out. 
---
I'll try it again on a fresh expansion so I don't feel so horribly behind.
---
Now i finally understand why every casino has a **Steak** House!
---
Thanks man! Hope you have a good day 😁
---
Farmed Angerforge over and over for Hand of Justice.  One night my priest and I couldn't find anyone to group with so we decided to duo it, knowing full well that we would be able to kill him (barely) and would then die on the adds at the end.  So our plan was to just dps race him down, and loot him right before the adds come and inevitably kill us.  Run back, revive at the instance entrance and reset it. 
---
We did this a sooo many times, each time getting junk loot and dying immediately after.
---
Until **finally**, it dropped!  I rolled need as the adds finished me off and I was over the moon hapoy.  ...until I realized my bags had been full.
---
That was the most stressful run back ever.  Lucky for me it takes longer for the boss to despawn and I got the item. But man I've never felt more stupid in my life.
---
I also want to see
---
What's the addon you're having troubles with?
---
Lol 10g for helping to kill 1 mob in STV???
---
Do people call them ice cones?
---
The addons I am talking about are those like questie that make the game more like retail. Sure, addons were used back then, but people used them because they disliked features in the game, features that retail no longer have.
---
 If you play Classic but avoid all the things that separate it from retail, then I don't understand you.
---
Not sure why you aren't being invited, Prot Pallies are then best tanks for AoE groups specifically but they also are just really good 5man tanks. Must just be a bad day
---
If you don't give a shit why replying instead of going on with your day? ;);););)
---
And how did you get between the dungeons and class trainers? Surely you didn’t think it was faster to run from a capital city all the way back to wherever you were farming than to take 5 to 30 seconds to grab flight points? At least not more than once.
---
Axe because it’s slowest and better for arms. The weapon skill isn’t super important until 60 when you’ll be fighting skill level mobs.
---
Axe is flat out the better weapon. Weapon skill isn't alllll that useful when fighting mobs your level or lower, which you should be doing as a warrior.
---
We killed a couple yesterday as a raid, when they die there are ashes on the ground which you can loot for mana/hpregen and + stam buff last 2 hours, every single person has to click on the ash and smear it over his/hers face.
---
have you tried Ramps at lvl 59 in half quest greens/half pre-portal dungeon blues? or mana tombs as lvl 65 group in ramps/BF/underbog gear? It\`s pretty hard, actually.
---
You need as much hit as possible to avoid losing threat. There’s no right answer as it’ll vary player to player. I’d try to cap because dps goes balls out right away and if you miss that first shield slam then you’re doomed.
---
Not to anyone used to raiding mythic retail or any comparable modern mmo raiding...
---
Most people here are keyboard turners and spell clickers. When you see comments about game difficulty and/or pvp keep that in mind. You can do DM and UBRS without a tank if you use CC. People 2-3 man DM with no tank lol.
---
The game has been around for 15 years.
---
If they could iterate from start, and end up at the same place, but without all the failed stuff that they scrapped in between, I feel like we’d end up at roughly the same spot retail is at now but with better feelings about it
---
Paladins should be fine during leveling but nobody will want a prot paladin at 60. If you don’t want to heal I’d reroll now.
---
Anyone else uncomfortable?
---
as a 60 warr i tanked the first half with a 2H and the second half sword and board and the whole thing was healed by a 49 pally. we had mid-50's warr, lock, and hunter for dps. 
---
had one wipe in the lycaeum when a group respawned on top of us 3 seconds after we killed it. 
---
i tried kiting the emperor to avoid his enrages but he was quick and stunned me as soon as i jumped off his dais every time.

Can't give you definitive info, but I struggle to see how you'd get banned for this. You're not exactly drawing attention being in Dire Maul, and it simply doesn't have abuse potential. You can get some okay wrists that you could farm with any semi-decent group anyways, and a cute back. You don't get important items, you don't get good gph, it's not a very profitable thing to do, you don't get an unfair advantage... I don't know, seems safe to me. Done a few runs myself.

TBC still had flying mounts and Shattarah as a high-lvl exclusive capital.

I've got herb and skinning, and am level 41 atm. Got my mount and 40g left. Are those profs still great for a lager sum of the gold needed for my epic mount or can i switch skinning out for say alch? I know some money will be lost but is it still that much?

We used to work to achieve. Now things are given to us. Feel of accomplishment is very rare in retail. Most of time I just feel that I get things I didn't work for.

Spell batching
---
Oh this would be awesome. Right now I'm trail and erroring my chat windows, always leaving me with stuff I don't want...
---
A few things here and there.
---
1. LFG. The implementation of this tool let players passively search for groups while doing other things, thus not only removing the player-to-player interaction achieved through manual communication, but also removing any chance of controlling who joins your party and who doesn't.
---
2. Cross-realm, layering, sharding and character renaming / server change / race change. The implementation of these features over time granted away any semblance of recognition amongst players. This leads to us people passively dehumanizing everyone we encounter as we level, as we never speak to them and will likely never see them again, even if they are on our own server.
---
3. The streamlining. This may sound gatekeepy or overused, but with everything being highly streamlined to a point where no player is forced to return to early zones for any reason, no one ends up leaving capital cities, no random world PvP occurs, and no player ever receives that burst of willpower from seeing a max-level version of themselves ride by in style. This makes the world feel hollow and empty, and more like a racing track everyone else already finished, rather than a living world.
---
4. The shift in philosophy. Ever since Activision became a part of Blizzard's development process, the company shifted from a feedback-based policy to a participation-based philosophy. This means that rather than listening to player feedback, the developers simply measure how many players participated in something in order to gauge its success.
---
These are, if you ask me, some of the absolute hallmarks of what went wrong. Now, I think most people would see some of these changes as neutral or even good at the time, but the long term effects speak for themselves.
---
Very helpful, thanks!
---
It did have portals everywhere lol
---
Just because you had to make a group still doesn't mean social interaction wasn't affected. You still need to make groups in bfa lol

Very accurate.
---
I saw on wowhead that Barbarous Blade is pre bis for hunters, even actually bis, lets be real  brutality blade and core hound tooth will always go to rogues/warriors first... but my question is, how is it better than 2x bone slicing hatchet..? 
---
You get +0.15% crit and +8 AP with barbarous blade compared to hatchet. The crit is negligible if you aren't hitting the next % treshold right? With hatchet you +10 stam and +0.98% dodge. Isn't hatchet just overall better? I'd trade 10 stam for 8ap lol
---
You can even see them in the background of the famous Jimmy video
---
ZF gear isn't outclassed by ST. And ST doesn't provide you with 100% guaranteed gear for every slot, unlike those starting quests at HFP.
---
A lot of people are raiding on their mains during prime hours so it can actually be more difficult to find groups for lower level content during that time. I know it can be difficult to play outside of prime time due to work and family commitments, hence, why it's called prime time, but the best time for low level dungeons are between late evening and early afternoon. 
---
And if you intend to tank, as it seems, then just make your own groups. Try make a similar level healer friend that will run dungeons with you because DPS are dime a dozen.
---
Enjoy, man https://youtu.be/Y9EKzvTo3g0

I joined a BRD run for the first time and the whole group was in the alterac mountains instead of in Blackrock Mountain where I thought the entrance was. I then got kicked. What happened?
---
Thanks bro. Real cool.

---
You can tank ANY instance (including UBRS and DM) as fury/arms warrior with a little bit of def gear. I do it every day, no probs at all.
---
It's good for tanks who need to pool rage for the next pack.  Not sure what use fury has for it.
---
Sold them for 400g on mine
---
Somehow the game displays grp members that already entered the dungeom to be in alterac mountains.
---
Of course! I'm not saying they're good things to do, but they are no less valid, unfortunately!
---
Cat is superior in phase 1 and 2 in pve. The highest dps build is 20/31/0, or 17/31/3 (dragon/human slaying). This talent build makes the most use of your pet. This is of course if you can control your pet to attack and not die.
---
If you go 2/31/18 then you might as well go wolf.. your pet isn't beefed up as much anyway
---
damn nevermind the beacon isn't on the item restore list
---
The bar is very low for redditors that's why there's daily PSAs from bad tanks
---
&gt;Looking for Group tool? Great idea. Paired with cross realms? Horrible idea.
---
This. Also auto-TP to dungeon from LFG queue sucks.
---
But the temple is still there.
---
This a repost btw.
---
I understand that viewpoint and I experience it myself as well. I am indeed enjoying classic. The problem is that this doesn't last. You'll have that magical RPG feeling, but only the first few months at best. And since this is subscription based, this isn't feasible for blizzard
---
Got one and sold it for 75g to a party member a second later :D
---
And this is how you protect your virignity. Lock ur self in ur moms basement and never come out. (Gratz)
---
Maybe it's because I'm a healer but every time I say I'm new or don't know what to do people are always helpful. Guess they don't want to spend another 20 minutes LF heals.
---
they don't mean "no queue" as in no wait time, they mean you can't just click a button, afk in a city, and get auto teleported to the dungeon/raid without interacting with anyone or going anywhere.
---
Ruins of Constellas or whatever it's called. The area in the south of Felwood. The drop rate is apparently 1% lower than I'm the north, but there are more mobs, they're lower level and the area is less contested than the place in the north. Farming Felcloth for Truefaith Vestment btw
---
Walking out into the open right before Princess in Mauradon was such a moment for me. It might've been that I was playing on a potato for a PC back then but I do not remember it being that beautiful!

Nostalgia. I want to see and do the quests and things that aren't in the game any more.
---
I have a draenei and got a worgen mask
---
Skinning will net you around 8s per skin later on, herbs will get you ghost mushrooms in maraudon and DM, which go for 1g20 on my server 
---
It adds up, I would drop skinning after Ungoro and keep herbalism
---
Comment for later
---
When people stretch out words vocally it's generally the first vowel.  
---
    
---
When people stretch out words in writing it's generally the last vowel or even a konsonant.   
---
I wonder why that is. Like, try vocalizing the title, sounds odd right?
---
I would personally hold onto skinning until lvl 60. It's a great profession while you're leveling, especially once thick and rugged leather start to drop. Once you're 60, you won't spend as much time in the open world or dungeons with a lot of beasts to skin, and that's when I think alchemy starts to win out with the endgame recipes (transmutes, potions, flasks etc).
---
&gt;but even its design is not as aesthetically pleasing as stockades or deadmines.
---
I like WC much more than DM. Maybe because I\`m alliance and ran DM 76546756 times, while only getting to WC on my alt in TBC private server for the set.
---
Burden of proof.

you won't be horribly behind, the game practically resets every raid tier with how easy it is to get catchup gear.

Lol this is too relatable, but for me it was a bad experience. I play on Thalnos which I guess is basically an unofficial Portuguese server. Ended up getting into a run of SM Cath as a healer with 4 Portuguese players. Our tank couldn't hold aggro for some reason and no matter how long I held my heal off all the mobs would target me and so we wiped. Afterwards he started typing to his friend in Portuguese saying how this healer is shit and that this healer cannot understand us and started flaming me hard. Thank God for Google Translate. After I found out I just left the party after saying I knew what they were saying. My worst WOW experience so far :/
---
You should tank BRD arena, reserve SGC, and run until you get it or hit 60.
---
It be like that sometimes

I love how retail players keep regurgitating this line over and over when it really only applies to Mage and Warlock.
---
&gt;This honestly just makes me think you haven't played retail in a really long time
---
I played Legion. What I wrote was true for both WoD and Legion. Almost every piece of gear was just "main stat + stam + (haste/crit/mastery/versatility)".
---
&gt;I find this rather contradictory when you seem to even acknowledge that raiding now is far more difficult then Classic raiding.

Try pugging C'thun and then tell me that "classic raiding isn't hard lulz"

I got mine for 290 on Incendius. I personally wouldn't sell them under 350, but it really depends on your server. Check how they're doing on the AH

Well, they're also the enforcers, so that's it doesn't matter if they apply the rules wrong.
---
Someone had great herbalism macro here that disabled clutter for few seconds and then automatically enabled it again and i cant find it anymore. Anyone know what it is?
---
A lot of the fundamental changes are simply better. Dungeon finder for example is great, but I would compromise with just having the premade group finder. What is an issue I think is the combat. Players are way too damn powerful. The game is filled with far more mobs to compensate, making aoe damage king. Almost no class has mana anymore. Instead of conserving and managing resources you are generating and spending them as fast as possible. There's no consequence for spamming everything. There are other problems of course like garrisons, and artifact power. But at least warforging might go away.
---
I second this!
---
I don’t think you can get forors from

The tomes that are spawned

I love classic but that's rose tinted glasses. Yeah Naxx and AQ has "pretty complicated mechanics" when compared to MC but it's still mainly a gear issue rather than skill. When Naxx was released on Lights Hope (they did content phases sorta like classic), it was cleared literally 2 hours later.
---
This is why relying on damage to generate your hate is such an asinine idea.  This isn't retail, DPS can and will overtake your damage and pull aggro.
---
Seems a bit low? My aoe set at 54 gives me 5.1k mana. I'm assuming if I can get a bit better blues and by the time I hit 60 6k should be easy. The bis guide for mages is really sp focused I find there are better items if you are just going to aoe

Stormrage look good only on night elves. On tauren they look precious.

Its very commonly out for less than 100 on Horde Mograine. At this moment of writing there are two up on the auction house for 95 and 100 buyout.

I have the same hotkey for soulstone and harthstone with shift and ctr as modifier respectively and they both have long cast time. I was tired one day and managed to port out of a dungeon...

Whisper a mage to open a portal for a small fee.
---
Social interaction required but works just fine 😁
---
Well release not even being two months ago doesn't really make a solid arguement, but good on you!
---
This was expected when most people playing would be returning. WoW is an awful game for someone brand new because it's been out for so long people forget (or just don't care) that not everyone has done it tons of times. 
---
Couple that with the selfish "me" attitude and you get groups that will want to do things their way only and fuck you if you need a quest or drop if they feel it's not worth their time. 
---
Expect this attitude to get worse as it progresses and more people get their parts done. When there were few 60s it was more common to have BRD quest runs and things because everyone needed them. Now it's all speed runs and if you need to do the attunements then GTFO because the others have done it already. 
---
People wonder why attunements were removed, and why LFG became a thing. Because after a while people aren't interested in helping someone else get attuned, even if it wouldn't be any issue for them. People won't run earlier dungeons because they don't have to, and for whatever reason "community" gets selectively applied when it's convenient.  So later on LFG was a creation of the community's unwillingness to be a community after a lengthy of time. 
---
I e. If you need a quest run, it's not the community's problem, it's yours and your should find a guild or make your own group etc. But if someone does something like ninja loot or is rude (apparently not to newbies though) that's the community's issue. So it gets selectively applied instead of "we are a community and help the community" like everyone waxed nostalgic for.
---
If believing that makes you feel better, then more power to you.

Also how does dodge work in pvp? If i have pve hit cap 9%, and opponent has like 20% dodge i'll still miss 11% of the time?

I still make bank with skinning at 60. Black dragon scales from ubrs are 1.5-3g each on my  server and I easily get 12 per run. Also I have Finkles skinner and have gotten 2 pristine hides of the beasts.

No roommate! Hm - How would you go about checking the priotization?

Perhaps. I could reach out to them - good advice ty!
---
They have to take it off us each expansion and only give it back when we jump through content loops. It's a bad cycle. It sucks that flying exists and that we have to be periodically denied it. Flight form for druid makes sense though. No idea how to balance that.
---
That's just group finder, except you have to run to stormwind then to the dungeon.
---
Yeah, OP has to delete it and re-post it as a blurry cell phone camera photo of his monitor. That's the rule.
---
15 years of incremental quality of life improvements removed all social aspects of the game is what went wrong.
---
RMT still leads to account bans, so even if the same account is creating many characters they would all be lost. And cost the owner money.
---
If they are banned before they sell enough gold, they've lost money, and even if they do, you are cutting into their profit margin.
---
Reporting works, apathy does not

The Mallet and the quest chain are actually completely separate. There is no quest for the Mallet; you just need to kill the specific elite for the initial mallet and then upgrade it in Jintha'alor. The quest chain you're thinking of takes you into Jintha'alor for the Ancient Egg, to summon Hakkar in Sunken Temple.
---
you can, its just a low chance.
---
My main tank that I run with for 5ms is a pure Fury/arms dps spec. He has prot itemization, but is pure TPS. as a hPal, i don't have any trouble keeping him alive, even in Dire Maul. This wasn't even really an issue when he was in some greens.
---
There are literally jobs that only exist because they can trick owners into thinking that superficial change equals progress.
---
Most of my runs have been good but silent so far :(
---
The video they should have used as the announcement.

No you are not. But I've always wanted to go there
---
It‘s better because BiS list are tailored towards PvE content, in which Stamina largely doesn‘t matter. 
---
Hit and dodge don‘t interact with each other. Hit negates misses, not dodges.
---
The farther you go in endgame, the more toxic and miserable people around you become. Competition usually attracts shit personalities.
---
What do you mean besides kalecgos?! My guild wiped for like 5-6 weeks 4-5days a week on that guy. We almost disbanded lol.
---
My experience is the complete opposite. I’ve had an abundance of spellcleave groups. Never had to wait more than 10 minutes to find a group. People were always highly competent and knew what to do. Averaged 4-5 runs pr grp before a replacement. And 1,5-3 times xp/h compared to questing and normal grp.
---
Badge loot was awesome for gearing recruits in an age where the attunement process itself was already a fucking nightmare. Gotta say it really helped from a guild administration perspective.
---
What a nice fellow, he wishes you the peace of crap
---
I heal for a tank in most of my 5ms that's currently Fury/Arms. By far a better tank than any deep prot pugs.
---
Havent logged into retail since

Just rerolled on gehennas and passed someone in the guild apes... had no Idea they were playing here and all I heard about them is that they grief, have people controlling zones 24/7 and are just overall good.

Switched Servers to play on the opposite faction. Got to level 40 only to realize that it's a dead Server and it takes 1-2 hours to get a SM group at prime time.
---
I read that if it procs in your OH it will make your MH swing again. A lot of raiders back in the day would keep THRASH in their OH with their tier MH weapons. Im currently using it in my OH with an Assassination Blade MH world drop in LBRS
---
That's a tough one to get because it's the same level as the cyclone axe, and bone biter is just a few levels away @38 dps with stats.

Still, should get something for it.

Should have gotten the maraudon bow but its w/e now, go for one in strat/scholo

---
Toc sucked balls and ICC was the main raid for over a fucking year. I also got burned out at the end of wrath because of this shit. We were promised multiple dragon encounters below the dragon temple and only ever got one more after release.
---
Which is why I said integrity and quality.
---
Also lots of businesses used to, they would do thinks like take care of their employees, pay a living wage, etc. The rat race to the bottom was not always the case give. The nature of communication being limited back a few decades ago.
---
Please tell me they have some rivals on the hordeside or that there are atleast some big and good guilds or is 60 going to be hell?
---
Fool-proof, too
---
You didn't really have a group of good players back in the day. Good enough for the time, maybe. But no vanilla raider would've cleared Sunwell Plateau when it was current content without systematic improvement. And onwards from there. My mother is an atrocious player (can't clear mythic +2s in time) but still manages to get content done in classic in an appropriate amount of time both when it was current content, and today.
---
They'll never know :-)
---
Generally bars are more pricey because you need mining to make them and a lot of peeps are boosting engineering without mining.

As an old Nethack player I did not expect Black Dragon Scale Mail to look like that.

---
Tbc still had a severe hybrid tax and for that reason I'll never rank it higher than wrath. Plus a couple specs were still just one button spammers just like in vanilla so it's not like the actual game play within raids was any better for a lot of people.
---
What changes? BC was just more hardcore than vanilla in every way.
---
The fucking daily quests and LFD dude
---
You're better of farming gold for 5 hours and just buy em of the AH than farm them youself.
---
But you're fighting the same model. I don't need to join a guild to defeat nzoth. I can do LFR and wipe enough times that the group of players and buff let's us pass the encounter.
---
The accesibility of raids gives stuff to do, but it removes most of the unattainable but aspirational mystery of barred content. The only barred raid content is mythic exclusive bosses and mechanics. I'd say loot aesphetics, but transmog may or may not affected that.
---
Where is this house?
---
If an enemy is rooted and you turn around and run away, the enemy will get extra melee range through leeway. If you backpedal, the enemy doesn't get that extra range. What I'm not sure of is if (or when) it's more worthwhile to backpedal instead of turning around and running

Societal goals

I liked flying. It made me revisiting zones and finding new content there. It was really cool.

Its so stupide everyone tells you warrior ist best class overall.

Im so glad i decided to just to for what i want even tho im 57.

Had so much fun in this early 22 lvl in my warlock. God bless me
---
Their first time should be however they like.
---
Not everybody has time to waste trying to find the mobs / items.
---
Why does it matter that much? Are you just going to not raid in Vanilla because of the inevitable reset? 
---
Whats the alternative? Needing Naxx gear to get into T4 raids? I just don’t quite see the solution.
---
Raandyy
---
Had a tank yell at me the other day because I'd quickly open up with aimed&gt; auto&gt; multi&gt; feign. He says, stop pulling before I charge in. I told him in feigning as they land and it's literally not doing anything to your aggro, but he wasnt understanding and was pissy the whole run
---
I quit a few months into BFA after having a good time in Legion (after unsubbing during WoD)
---
Tried retail once more just to see if they had fixed anything or if it was really that bad after a break.
---
a few hours later, yes, it was that bad.
---
What do you expect to see? What classic WoW content are you hungry for that doesn't already exist in 19 different locations?
---
How are these talents if I want to play retri Paladin?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/5-503051-052050512203151
---
Probably doing PvP most of the time at 60 since noone wants Retri Palas in their groups.
---
First bit feels like a checklist.
---
I don't do LFR because it's content which I do with people who I have no attachment with to "do" content that exists. My individual contribution matters not and I'm at the mercy of everyone else being competent. Which makes researching the fight pointless. The loot will be replaced by catch up gear next patch or definately next expansion.
---
Calling someone pampered is bashing? You should probably leave your bubble, snowflake.

Doing things manually will help you far more in the long run

Yeah but there's non-slam 2h fury (horde only) where you just dump your rage into hamstring instead of hs or slam. Not sure how the numbers work out vs slam spec.
---
Picked my nose as I was completing the brd escort quest and accidently ran out of the instance. 
---
Everyone else completed it and I just stood there like an idiot.
---
Had to re-do that pain in the ass escort again. :(
---
&gt;People wonder why attunements were removed
---
They were really detrimental to guilds in TBC when said guild struggled to keep up with the current tier, which was common. I got downvoted heavily last time I mentioned this but it doesn't make it any less true. The tier 4 guilds fed into tier 5 ones and so on.
---
That said I like to help people just because I can, with a caveat of I try to avoid dungeons I actively dislike outside guild runs.
---
OP is the type to post this interaction on Reddit. I have a feeling we’re missing some dialogue here. I would ignore you too if you were on my server.
---
That was mainly an issue the first few days of an expac though though.  I am leveling my alt on a constantly full server and never have issues tagging mobs anymore.
---
There are a handful of quests where its still an issue, but those could easily be fixed by just adding more spawns.
---
What is the most active alliance EU PvP server? I want to start an ally toon, but don't want to end up on a dead server!  
---
Yes, we have a couple of slayers in our guild. Absolute mad lads.
---
Huh.. Yeah only thing I can think of is maybe the combat inactive fader is at 0%, or theres another add-on conflicting with it? Not sure bud. You can try the other unit frame Zpearl but its kinda clunky.
---
Everybody is self-critical, friend. You should write more, this was fantastic!
---
That’s awesome!
---
My druid had the rogue under shirt because he wanted to have rogue gear.
---
&gt;They did make attunements and similar better in BC though.
---
They made them actively worse by them being linked to raid bosses so people would get attuned in a T4 guild and leave to join one doing SSC/TK, then leave them to join a T6 guild.
---
I mean... couldn’t you have just stopped instead of annoying him more? Regardless if you were right or not?
---
Hes a secret. Were all using abilities when the RL calls for white damage.
---
oh no someone didn’t like when i stole gear that i didn’t need 
---
and they called me on it
---
better cry on reddit
---
Haha this hits home +1
---
Man that escalated quickly.
---
Yeah the drop rate is very low. The easiest mobs to kill for these are the turtles in Tanaris. You'll find them along the western shoreline at the top right of the map. 
---
It's not a bad grind as a lot of the other things they drop sell well on the AH too, especially if you are able to skin them for leather as well. Even the zesty clam meat sells (well it does on my server anyway).
---
I grinded them for a couple of days, managed to get 6 golden, 11 black, and several of the other pearl's too. 
---
If nothing else, you'll make a bit of gold auctioning the other stuff to buy the golden pearl's if you don't get lucky!
---
Fuck this game is ugly
---
I ran arena to get the belt on my warlock and I got it on the 94th run, and I didn't even play that much, so his 290 claim makes sense to me
---
...and this is how grooming starts...
---
What is going on with Herald doing the female human dance and Thrall doing the Troll dance? Who btw. looks lit af doing the Troll dance.
---
*Cries in WotLK Dance Studio*
---
When I accidently walked into Searing Gorge on my 20ish lock from Redridge... I was like "oh what's this burning for" walks over all skull npcs comes out of the lava chasing me down... "DEATH IT IS FOR DEATH!!"
---
If you're having fun, its worth it.
---
Thank God our raid leader isn't like that. He designates that only hunters go full out at about 42% and head north. If we get her let her come towards us a bit then FD. If we don't get her, FD anyways.
---
You just get exalted with Booty Bay and it unlocks.
---
I'm kidding, my friend used Hallowed Wand - Pirate on me from the Halloween event.
---
Lol k
---
Made it all the way to lvl 18 on my hunter before I remembered that there is a pet trainer.
---
Thats fair, although this is rarely an issue after the first few weeks. They could certainly add it for quest rewards without much issue.
---
Most of the mob fighting now is over loot, and its important that this is scarce.
---
Big oof
---
I laughed. I watched it twice. I dont know exactly why though.
---
The Magram have a large amount of Water under their control which is extremely useful in a desert such as Desolace.
---
Thanks for the reply. Yea I assumed the risk of anything happening would be pretty low but just wanted to see if anyone else had some insight. Thought I'd give it a go since wrist gear with +spell damage is surprisingly rare it seems and everyone on my server just wants to do tribute runs.
---
You're playing patch 1.1 content with 1.12 tuning. This is the TBC pre-patch. Everything but Naxx has been hit with the nerf bat.
---
Sorry to rain on your creepypasta but that cabin is called Newman's Landing, and the story i've heard is that when you create a new character and log into them for the first time the game spawns them there (possibly only for EK or alliance), initializes the character, and then teleports them to their starting zone because as much as I love wow it's a janky pile of crap lol
---
Anecdotally people claim if you hang out there long enough you'll see level 1's spawn in then disappear and a /who eill show you that they're in the house and the phone line has been cut get out get ou
---
Yes and one that is either 12 or just behaves like a child.
---
I’m in the process of finishing up the tribal LW wursts,,, if not tribal then what? Elemental seems lack luster, maybe dragonscale for mail?
---
I have had this happen to me if I am still moving as in the running animation isn’t done playing and I am standing still. Or if I have another input on my keyboard as I FD.
---
Don’t know if bug or just the way it is. I can’t remember how it was 15 years ago
---
How so?
---
As a shaman I just purge em. Lol
---
So..mobs were nerfed af and still you do more gph than pservers.
---
Legit

.12 is soon
---
You just don't know how to properly cook em
---
It does. It will load everything around as if your character was there.
---
Just say hey guys it's my first time running this dungeon, please lead the way. After 1-2 runs you will be up to speed.
---
It's because tanking is hard in classic. Retail has basically been faceroll to tank since LK
---
Yeah, I just created a channel yesterday just for whispers. And learned that I have to mark Blizzard Whispers. To get whispers from my friend list. A total explanation would be nice
---
We can't stop here, this is flying spider country.
---
Models are classified/grouped by type, orc and troll is the same type so you can mix and match their dances. All player races are like this.
---
You also see the Maraudon Priestess doing the ogre dance but it doesn't work quite right since she doesn't have the same belly mechanics.
---
This is a platform for sharing media, not an art gallery.
---
Like others I prefer Might to Wrath, but (unpopular opinion) also Nightslayer to Bloodfang.
---
When you're minding your own business AoE farming gold. And a white knight keeps trying to *help* you get a quest mob you've done two weeks ago.
---
"Kite when I frost nova noob"
---
Yes, I'll kite the one mob that didn't instantly unfreeze due to concecration...
---
Stop dps when phase 3 starts!!!
---
Casters pull aggro as soon as she lands, whole raid wipes
---
Clutch play. The decision making under pressure was on point gz
---
I farm zf easily.  I saw a group in world chat looking for more for zf spellcleave and I offered to let them tag along.  I told them I will loot everything and all they would need to do is stand in a safe spot.  The leader of the group acted like I had just pissed in their cheerios.  They said I had  balls making such a request and put me on ignore.  That's the last time I offer to help anyone.
---
Just taunt/mocking blow on CD and ask your guildies to hold back. A slow tank is better than no tank.
---
Same with buying the Savory Deviate Delight recipe in BB and selling it on Alliance AHs for twice the amount you paid for it.
---
Yep, that's right, thought I would give pvp a try as Ally and it's not for me. I think you have to be a little masochistic to play Alliance on a high pop pvp server.
---
Rolled a war with the intent to tank
---
... only to find out there are no raid spots and now I’m stuck as the worst class in the game playing a build that’s useless outside raids.
---
I see, thank you for the answer.
---
Thanks for being on 24/7 repost watch! You stick to your post while the rest of us just go on living our lives!
---
As Alliance on pagle, i will be sure to /woah if i see you!
---
LOL, saw this exact same thing when I was questing. Saw a shadow on the ground and was like, "WTF?" Looked up and there it was.
---
Database database!
---
?
---
I'm just a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude.
---
Pandering.
---
On my server this lasted all the way to 60 and it's the same shit on an alt. Some days I just log off because stv is still camped to death in my server.
---
Just farm the satyrs in dire maul.  I got stacks of dark runes from doing that.
---
Mobile objects from the representation in the coding.
---
"Who's that a picture of Father?"
---
"That is the man who saved my life."
---
"Who is he?"
---
"Nutfixer"
---
Oh boohoo was a joke?  Hilarious... now run along
---
What were you doing there at level 17?
---
By "better tank" do you mean "holds aggro?" Because it isn't difficult,  at all, to hold aggro as Fury/Arms.
---
The difference in survivability between fury prot and deep prot is so small it barely makes any difference.
---
Unbelievable that someone who clearly isn't 11 years old actually admits to this out loud.
---
That was cool! Nice idea :)
---
That fucking ony lmao
---
Alliance Bloodfang. Tank looking for raiding guild that raid on Friday/Saturday/Sunday after 8pm. 3 T1 and have the book for Quel'Serrar. Contact me via Reddit PM.
---
They kept removing reasons to go into the world and form relationships with people in the name of convenience.
---
* heirlooms made level alts faster so you got done with questing faster
---
* crossrealm dungeon finder gave you access to a sea nameless bodies to fill you dungeon groups
---
* professions were made pointless because they didnt want them to be important
---
* flying mounts made it possible to simply ignore the contours of the world by simply flying over it
---
* each spec now only had its own spells. You were no longer a warlock. You were a destruction warlock so you forgot how shadow magic works. This resulted in homogenization of what you saw in the world. No more weird hybrid playstyles that made it fun to experiment.
---
should give credit to the maker of the video
---
Very well written and super fun to read!
---
Maybe? I'm sure it depends on the player. I've been playing since vanilla so I've already got the basics down
---
Look up skarmtank on YouTube
---
Wolfshead helm and or if you're only sitting in bear you should be prehotting/starfire-moonfire packs to get some initial aggro so that not having enough rage isnt too much of an issue.
---
You bounce around a lot. Some quests in STV, Dustwallow Marsh, Arathi Highlands, Feralas to name a few.
---
Stupid sexy Flanders
---
Yes but providing credit is good no matter where you are
---
EDIT: OP did provide a link in another comment
---
Just kinda sad that the whole point of his post is to say, "I helped him kill a mob and then he killed me." Who cares, that's the game.. Maybe he didn't like his name, or he wasn't too keen on an orc rogue trying to get buddy buddy with him. Whatever the reason, pvp happened.
---
Don't get me wrong, I kill with impunity, in my mind red is dead, and I hate seeing people watch instead of helping, but that's their prerogative. I do think it's all about choosing your battles and what hill you want to die on, but the solid and irrefutable fact is on pvp servers, pvp will happen, and I do think calling someone a carebear for trying to shame someone else for pvping is not only appropriate but should be encouraged.
---
This is going to sound cliché as all hell, but just because you are nice and kind to someone does not mean they will do the same, in fact, it actually makes you more of a target to those with a more predatory side in these games, if you show your metaphorical back to someone, don't think they won't stab it, especially if it's what should be expected from a normal encounter in these scenarios.
---
As a priest that’s been doing SM the past week or so it’s not that bad to heal tbh. I main priest in retail/classic so I guess maybe I just know how to heal but I just try to find any group I can and heal as best as I can and we normally always clear. 
---
Yes it’s probably just 1-2 runs with that group but I’ve been cool with it so far.
---
Gonna start runnin RFD soon
---
If you did that before he got.initial aggro and they start hitting him you are nerfing his rage gain and therefore the threat he can produce
---
I did eventually fix it after fiddling for over an hour. Apparently the downloaded .zip version is fucked and only the twitch version works for me. Appreciate the help, though!
---
Every single dwarf I've encountered in the wild has either been lower level than me, or attacked me on sight. When I'm 60, dwarves are KoS.
---
My friend and I like to mind-control horde to buff them and then, kill them. We just like to imagine their reaction from "fuck" to "ooooh" to "fuck" again. Yep... I love pvp realms
---
Die, Rez at spirit and grab a free flight path
---
Never played any expansions after TBC, but classic brought me back! Feels a bit like a too big gap to jump to 'current wow' after missing so many expansions. Maybe if they ever release WoW2 where everybody starts fresh i would go to a 'new wow' again!
---
20 agi =1% crit
---
Perfectly valid answer. Solo leveling a toon to 60 with bare questing and mob kills is fucking tedious and difficult. Thats kinda the point but I definitely get someone not wanting to die 1000 times on their journey
---
This is very simple. It all comes down to money. Majority of wow players by WOTLK are casual. Blizzard designed the game to cater to them. To make it worse, said casuals love to spend money on dumb shit like mounts. From there blizzard let the casual community design the game. Every hot complaint in forums Blizzard caved and implemented. Trasnmog, LFR, etc, all come from casuals demand.
---
There’s a reason Brazilians have a reputation in video games. Also, who cares what they thought if they were the ones messing up?
---
That's cause of phase 2 DPS though.
---
As someone who mostly plays a Dwarf:  I've always felt that dwarves are the race that people who want to be horde pick when all their friends roll alliance.
---
Ough streamer server
---
Yup this is a good spot
---
I assume he means expansions. It's very obvious that English is not his first language.
---
People have lives to live, they put their own time into reading guides for efficiency so they can do this. If you aren't happy, create your own groups on your own terms.
---
Madness. Have you raised a ticket?
---
&gt; Current WoW basically has no leveling and it does pretty well, as leveling is only a tiny part of the game.
---
At max level, leveling is replaced with item progression.  
---
But it's the same leveling system, just with average iLevel instead.  
---
Still leveling, but with gear. It doesn't matter how you call it, it's still leveling progression.
---
The only option that blocks chat invites will also block important system information, such as the one that appear when you /who someone.
---
In pve you don't give two shits about stam or dodge because in raids you shouldn't be getting hit outside of rng and aoe stuff. In that context and because hunters need to minmax so hard every bit of ap and crit matters far more.
---
From my own experience I found it’s usually gnomes that are aggressive little creatures
---
Hasn't this been posted 30 times by now?
---
Are they pretty low drop chance? Been thinking of farming some.
---
Drek thar
---
Bet he posts in /r/totallynotrobots
---
I'm fully aware that PvP can happen at any given time, and I always expect the worst out of anyone I encounter. I'm simply saying that sometimes that isn't always the case and you might be surprised.
---
In OP's case, I can see why it may be unnecessary to complain about because as I had mentioned, no one is bound to any one set of etiquette rules for opposing faction members. I just think that saying "You must kill on sight otherwise you're a carebear" doesn't hold much substance because everyone is different in how they play, even on a case-by-case approach. Then again, like you said and which does hold true, complaining about PvP happening on a PvP server regardless of circumstance doesn't do much. If it does happens to you, then it informs you as a player exactly how to respond to that player the next time you come across them.
---
AoE just means area of effect. Spell cleave means TONS OF DAMAGE!
---
Yes, close to the majority of your damage is from white hits.
---
Source: Topping DPS on rag by stacking hit.
---
That shit made me laugh the most
---
Is there an easy swing timer you would recommend? I tried weak auras but you need a computer engineering degree to figure out how it works.
---
Thanks
---
First things to do after dinging 60?
---
I've always been hated by cartels. It'll be the first time I dont go for the title
---
Is it a good leveling spot and are there many other people there
---
Takes 1 hr to send it to ur bankalt tho
---
The 2H raptor strikes are better than the stam and dodge for pvp
---
Brutal😂
---
I’m currently playing a priest, and love it.  
---
Sell me on the idea of a warlock
---
Just Classic for now. I’ll eventually go back to retail once there is something interesting to do.
---
It'd odd, i've been playing for 13 years, most of my life, I have actually run into these negative situations quite often. I will explain to someone what to do if they're new to the dungeon. But I gotta be honest, i've been attempting LBRS's Highlord Omokk boss since I was level 56, I have dozens of kills on him, i've had to clear this whole dungeon just for the first boss dozens of times, all I want are his cloth pants, and I hate to admit it but that DOES wear down my patience with new players. I try my best to never show my patience running out, but sadly it's just made me less helpful and sometimes I only explain the bare minimum so the run can go faster, or say "i'm sorry but we're skipping bijou's belongings".
---
Basically my point is, I understand why people won't deal with new people at 60, I struggle to myself. But some people are outright toxic about it. I was the toxic person a few years ago... i'm better, but i'm not perfect. But I still see *other* people provide negative experiences all the flipping time.
---
When the honor system comes and even more Alliance abandon ship, it will be interesting to see if the horde realize they have effectively killed the game for themselves.
---
How much ap is 1% crit worth?
---
HUH
---
Half the time FD wont even go off for me. Im spamming the button like a madman but nothing at all happens. And when I actually do feign the enemies just smack me to death anyway because they resist it 90% of the time.
---
Are casual raiding guilds a thing in PVP servers? Every guild advert I see is some hardcore raiding guild. 
---
I’m only like level 26 so I’m not raiding anytime soon but I’d love to join a non toxic guild to make friends whilst levelling and eventually raid in a few months time. But the thing is I can never find any on EU Mograine. Every guild is either toxic as fuck or just hardcore.
---
Not sure. That's all I really know
---
This is how it's always been. FD can essentially be resisted just like any other ability. It's certainly not game breaking. Annoying maybe... But game breaking? Gtfoh.
---
I gotchu

What can warriors legitimately do to farm gold in this game? It feels like without ranged or aoe it's pretty hard to make gold.
---
PM me when you've uploaded it. You guys should do a series (Warrior vs Mage). Credit me when it gets big :)
---
There is often this indefinable *"something"* which makes a thing oddly satisfying, captivating or intriguing. This "something" is an intelligible entity one cannot simply describe or convey with mere words, since it transcends that realm of inquiry.
---
But this video definitely has that "something".
---
Hunter in this video is a dick.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVT0sZzxtccbqxx
---
Yes, and the OP has deliberately shared it in a fashion that gives no credit or support to the creator. Why didn't he just post the YouTube link? I'll tell you why, because he valued upvotes more than the artist who created the video.
---
In classic I feel like a soldier in the war, contributing with what I can  
---
In BFA you are the chosen one (alongside millions of other chosen ones) taking down gods with your ax
---
I feel this change was gradual, starting on tbc and is the thing I hate the most, followed closely by flying mounts
---
Only thing I really lose is divine spirit, and a few points in renew stuff
---
You typically want your offhand weapon faster than your mainland. The slower the weapon swing the higher the weapon damage on swing. A lot of skills are based on weapon damage so you want your main weapon to maximize this. 
---
As for specifics on the thrash blade, studies show it increases dps by about 4% overall. 
---
If unsure, run a comparison with a training dumby or target dumby. Set a timer and compare after a few minutes.
---
Jupp. I play mostly classic but when I get tired of grinding my bloody ass off i jump on retail and do a few dungeons or Bgs.
---
Character boosts
---
Why have you assigned an icon when you are using #showtooltip? Also you can just shorten that to #show. If you want the icon just remove the #showtooltip.
---
Lol this is funny, wouldn't have thought of even doing that, but less so that it is "fixed" this way by Blizzard :D
---
My bad, I didn't think that you were dumb to the point that you'd change the order of operations in the formulas in order to claim that they're wrong.
---
I didn't think that you'd also be so clueless that you'd be completely unaware of the existence of margins of error.
---
You went and changed the formulas and then used those changed formulas as an argument as to why the *unchanged* formulas are wrong. You're literally strawmanning maths.
---
Your "log analysis" is just as equally laughable when you can't even do math right. Everyone knows the hitcap is 9%, 6% if you're at 305 skill.
---
I'm not going to argue with a troll. Keep living in your delusions, maybe one day you'll realize your maths are just as bad as your arguing.
---
I miss pre-nerf Cata heroics, the challenge was good and loot was satisfying.
---
Keep in mind everyone got to level cap sooner or later. So the game is very different when theres a steady tidal wave of people leveling vs the bottleneck we get later.
---
I feel like once the game shifted to that then the weight became a driving force for changes that ultimately werent healthy for the game.
---
An epic tale for sure. I was riveted.
---
Monster or beast
---
Hunters can feign death so for them it doesn’t matter
---
Whenever i watch this, i'm just mesmerized by Chromie's little dance.
---
Netherwind?
---
Mesmerising
---
9% is just yellow hits, white hits is like 27% which you'll never reach. So yes.
---
You say it like the person is profiting from it, no one gives a fuck about reddit points.
---
I’m not new but I could see how new players wouldn’t want to tell those tryhards their new though. Like right off the bat they’re usually just GO! Been playing since vanilla! For the horde!
---
Oh my God. I love it!
---
its not that obscure anymore lol. but maybe i just think that because all my friends r stoners
---
Only classic.
---
the beat, the blank pothead stare from the dancer, the dragon scream at the end....perfection. my boner has never been this hard.
---
I had an innkeeper cast that on mr for an hour! It was entertaining.
---
You're gonna get booted out of every raid ever for using that ^^
---
Dammit Chromie, we don't deserve you.
---
Nostalgia is meant to be a silly thing, when you take it too seriously you'll always be dissapointed.
---
Well then, care to explain why he didn't just link to the YouTube video? You obviously don't realise how annoying it is for content creators to have their work shared on social media with no credit.
---
I actually have no idea what #showtooltip does LOL I am completely new to macro and just saw some examples having it on the top so... Do you have any good guide to start acquiring an actual understanding?
---
How do you solo dm north first boss?
---
I was killed 4 times on the way to do Strat live last night - twice by 10 horde camping the flight path into EPL and twice by 10 horde camping the instance entrance.
---
At this point, dying in pvp isn't something we get mad, or even really care about. It's out of our control. There is no amount of gear or trying to rally other alliance players that will have any impact on the outcome.
---
Most of us will quit in on or before phase 2, but there aren't really any other interesting MMOs out there.
---
Healbot has been working for me.
---
is there any addon for textfonts? downloaded fontalisious or something but doesnt seem to be working
---
https://youtu.be/z8H4E9NyDjE
---
A little bit, yup.
---
uhm yes, if there is any server there is casual raiding its on pvp
---
ur comment about mograine probably has to do with mograine having many swedes, alot of them intend to be very toxic or nerdy aka hardcore
---
Dying and winning a rogue as an enemy? Rip that priest.
---
is there a addon for textfonts? didnt find any yet
---
No one asked for this...
---
BUT WE ALL NEEDED THIS
---
Being the organizer is more responsibility and effort. There is also a subtle sense of accountability and leadership with it too. 
---
In reality, as a tank, once everyone gets to the dungeon I expect somebody to mark where we need to go if I don't know the nuances, otherwise I'll take it over from there.
---
There is a part of me that wishes I rolled a strict DPS main to get away from my similar IRL  job duties, but it's so internally rewarding when everything goes well.
---
So showtooltip followed by any spell will show that spell as the tooltip (the icon you see). So if you want it to look like normal frost bolt you’d do #showtooltip frostbolt
---
/cast frostbolt
---
/spit
---
You can shift+click on the name
---
Smug dance not as cool on chromie..
---
I think she needs the hat
---
For 40 man raids 20/31/0 is still superior with good pet micro. In some fights he may be useless like rag, but overall raid it’s better since there’s a lot of trash to kill and a lot of bosses the pet can free attack.
---
There are 2 questions you are asking. Is BM or surv better, and which pet is better. First answer is BM is the higher dps spec. This only applies for p1 and 2 cause pets fall off a lot as we get gear. 2nd question is given a BM spec, which pet is better.. If you bring a fast wolf, the dps difference will be very little. The main thing pushing your pet dps over the top is enrage, fast aspd means more enrage uptime. 
---
But if you really wanna mix max, then BT is the best raiding pet, cause more aspd is more enrage uptime. Also the initial claws you will hit will further increase proc chance. Wolfs don’t have claw so if they don’t Crit on the first 2 attacks, it’s enraging much slower than a cat. Wolf is better in some bosses where your pet can’t go in, but overall the cat will come out on top, but only slightly.
---
Back to if you are survival.. then just go wolf, the whole enraging argument is gone, and without being specced in pet damage wolf will be better than cat.
---
same...most people are chill and willing to explain or help, with a few bad apples here and there...dont listen to the negative nancys
---
As a fury warrior who does tank, if its a dungeon I've not tanked yet I do like to dps the first time round so I will look for a tank, but after I've seen it done I'm more than happy to fill the role. I think a lot of warriors are just nervous of trying and fucking up, I know thats what gets me.
---
Probably so if someone invites you to a legit channel you won't miss it.
---
Some guilds have class-specific and/or tank/dps/healer channels for raiding so if you were to be invited to such a channel, you won't miss it.
---
Right after I started using it Hordes start ganking me more often LOL. I had to switch back.
---
AmaZing
---
Did the "show tooltip" thing automatically assign the highest level to the spell your casting?
---
I logged in to my old lvl 70. Walked from stormwind AH to the bank and “discovered” stormwind and leveled to 71 from the xp. Immediately logged out
---
The issue could be fairly unique to me. The issue I seem to personally have with achievements is that they flare up my "completeness OCD" but yet don't give me any real satisfaction upon completing them. So they exist just to torture me about not doing them. It's just a distraction from what is actually going to give me satisfaction. 
---
I don't think I'm alone though. The same sort of torture can be applied to other things that are commonly decried such as daily quests. 
---
To each their own, though. Surely loads of people get satisfaction from these types of features in retail, but I don't.
---
in Classic unfortunately it is...fd seems to be bugged and resisted/ignored much more tjan it should be
---
Name an ode to Peep Show?
---
As far as I know that's not how it works. There is a singular .5 damage modifier applied to the off-hand, and thus the off-hand will gain the full value of AP before the modifier is applied.
---
Lol I feel you man. The amount of duels I lose because I panic are ridiculous. I'm a scrub lol
---
Hey! thanks for the info, but I know the rule of slow MH and OH. 
---
I got mirah's song as OH, but I mean as a question, is Cho'Rush's Blade better than Thrash blade as a MH? It got more dps, and a bit higher dmg, but the proc from thrash blade could be better. I'm wondering if anyone got experience of what's better dps overall.
---
Dancing on makrik wife though omg
---
There are a few things that could be introduced (perhaps in a Classic+ later on). Some of these are things that later expansions did "right", based on the fact that I hardly ever see anyone complaining about them.
---
* New classes
---
* New talents (or even talent trees)
---
* New low-level dungeons, high-level dungeons, and high-level raids
---
* New quest hubs
---
* New zones for both low and high level
---
* New spells/abilities
---
* More balanced (not homogenized) abilities
---
* Itemization that helps fill in the gaps of certain specs
---
* New battlegrounds
---
Your reply sure took a odd twist.
---
I considered it, but I didn't know for sure if it'd get me close enough and I didn't want to die more
---
As always with questions of "how did we get here?" the answer is the same: One step at a time.
---
That makes sense, thanks!
---
Just got inventor focal sword for my lock on lvl 48, apparently it’s pretty good, but 1% crit doesn’t feel that good? Do I equip it already or is it more for raiding when I spam shadow bolt?
---
What did I just watch
---
Im on thundefury and I've grouped with plenty of &lt;Old Farts&gt; so let me save you the frustration... That Guild is trash, just leave now and do yourself a favor.
---
Thats about it
---
You bet! Already have a guild going for low level BGs on Kromcrush!
---
If the content creator didnt want it sharing they could have blocked video playback on other sites forcing a link to YouTube. Even the original creator probably gives less of a fuck than you do about this.
---
Yeah I might love or even HATE chips!
---
And people who use swear words in general chat.
---
Because that copy paste wasnt used 15 years ago.
---
Wdym, you got a big guild? With some planning it shouldn't take too long :p
---
This has a lot to do with classic.
---
Algalon realm first, is by far my finest and proudest memory of wow. I wholeheartedly agree.
---
They panicked at the subscription cancellation rate after Wrath of the Lich King and - instead of focusing on quality long term story development and expansion design, began throwing gimmicks and participation epics at players expansion after expansion in a desperate bid to draw customers back. 
---
   
---
It would be easy to draw analogies between WoW and Game of Thrones, the television series. 
---
Both were remarkable until the production exhausted the source material and story development was taken over by less capable people.
---
As a horde player, can confirm! Dwarves are the only alliance race I’d ever like to play. Plus their zones are beautiful
---
This is the perfect representation of classic wow change my mind
---
While I think you're over exaggerating as to the state of PuGs, I think that once you've done UBRS like 30 times you start to get tilted having to explain everytime not to step on eggs, backs to wall so you don't get punted, move your totems so you don't pull the balcony in Rend room, etc... 
---
Give people the benefit of the doubt. I know it's asking a lot to expect you to know how to do the dungeon and what trash is dangerous, but at the same time it's exhausting wiping because people have 0 spatial awareness.
---
It's a wickerman reference isn't it? Not burning man. I can see why you would think it was though.
---
&gt; the blank pothead stare from the dancer

"the dancer" is Chromie, or "Chronormu", probably the most important character in the Bronze Dragonflight.

Yeah i am trying to sell it now! I hope i get something for it:)

Great post.

i use these guides, might be better options out there but wowhead has been there for a long time and it has plenty of tips on how to minmax ur leveling or w/e.
---
Wow really!!!! I got it after like 8 big oozes!!!!:/
---
I don’t know what this is and I can’t comprehend why it made me feel sick and why I love it so much.

/r/cursedcomments ?
---
It was this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dd8opx/shadow_vs_discipline_or_why_shadow_sucks/ 15 days ago that started me on this grind.  
---
Had a bit bad luck with Devout Chest, lost it 3 times. but shoulders was by far the most difficult one to get.
---
/e spits on you.
---
Keep in mind that past lvl 50, your level doesn't mean half as much as your gear. A well geared lvl 52 can be stronger than a 60.
---
This maybe didn't apply in your case, buy what you said about the dull stretch made me think.
---
I really wish heirlooms were stats on a tabard instead. Loot drops are a fun part of leveling. But last time I tried to level, I foolishly wore all my heirlooms. Why wouldn't I? Well that takes up half my gear slots right there, certainly all my main pieces of gear and weapon. I actually took out that fun by doing it.
---
At first I was slightly uncomfortable, but then I was entranced.
---
When people say 'GD' after a duel, do they mean 'Good' or 'Good duel'.
---
I always thought it was the former - which was kinda douchey - but just occured to me it might be the latter.
---
There's a reason you keep all your aggro drops/resets for the start of phase 3, and also *stop fucking DPSing until the tanks move her*.
---
Seen it so many times.. land/taunt/start to move/DPS immediately unloads all cooldowns and goes nuts/Ony runs around murdering people and throwing them into whelps.
---
Personally I prefer a dead boss over being at the top of the charts, just me though.
---
Constant catering to the casuals, over several expansions. Making things easier, quality of life here, quality of life there, LFG finder (sit in org queue up dont talk to anyone), in cataclysm was the biggest mistake ever LFR, raids used to be this elusive thing for me when I was a noob, I wondered what it would be like to see the bosses deep inside the raid, in wrath I had a goal to see the lich king and when I got to him it felt amazing.
---
Y’all need some Raid.
---
Horde side fuck the rogues daggers are warrior prio. They can go combat swords until AQ, they want daggers for pvp weapons.
---
They are just very slow at farming gold yeah. You can do strat for Orbs, that's it.
---
&gt; do I keybind the two slots?
---
I don't personally use the addon but either under the options for the addon or via the regular keybindings place. You'll find it eventually.
---
Yeah! Im going to change soon i havent been in a instance exepct SM and ZF once, i know which weapon i am going to get :)
---
I've seen a hunter pull aggro in ony.
---
It's really the hardest thing about Ony, dps always wanna show off their dps meters when the meters are really unimportant
---
According to [shadowpanther.net](https://shadowpanther.net/weapons-pve.htm) it's only marginally better.  It's really going to come down to how much RNG gives you procs onn Thrash.
---
*pulls aggro and feint*
---
"Oh hey..look at you ground"
---
I don’t disagree that it was perfect, but Ulduar had something Kara didn’t:
---
Heroic versions of the boss fights that you actually activated during the fight (mostly), unlike the flippin toggle option they added in the very next patch (lookin at you TotC).
---
The implantation of the four towers before Flame Lev, the guardians surrounding Yogg Saron, whatever you did against Freya to make her heroic, etc etc etc, all of that felt soooo damn good it nudges Ulduar over Kara, SWP, and ICC for me.
---
(Though lore-wise, BT, SWP, and Hyjal are their best raids in that arena, imo)
---
is it really that much more difficult lmao? I can't help but feel like people are just sniffing their own farts when they say shit like this
---
I read an article about how rested experience builds 4x faster when you lot out in a city or an inn compared to a non-rest zone. Does it accumulate at the same 4x rate when you're logged in and standing in a rest zone, or do you get the fastest rate of gain only when the character is logged out there?
---
[I put on my robe and wizard hat](http://bash.org/?104383)
---
CHT is a dagger, and other swords are a bit too slow. For non humans, Eshkandar is the best I believe. I'm not a warrior but that's what I've been told by people that I believe did their research, so I can't really comment further on this.
---
Can we see these logs?
---
Fucking lost it at Mankrik's wife
---
I'm making a lot of assumptions here, but would have happened to be a priest shielding a warrior tank on pull? 
---
That is the only way it could have possibly been your fault for the tank not being able to get any aggro.
---
Improve is fun
---
He’s right, you know.
---
Well, first of all not all classes have built-in threat resets, like deep arcane mages etc. The option here is to blink towards tank position and pop a LiP.
---
Second of all, Onyxia is taunt immune.
---
And lastly it doesn't have much to do with charts, casters usually just melee/wand phase 1, shoot frostbolts /standard rotations normally throughout phase 2 and still get aggro in phase 3 occasionally.
---
But yes, every situation can be saved and this should never cause a wipe at least, just a few dead bodies at most.
---
IIRC, there are not any training dummies in Classic.  Those were added in later expansions.  Best method of testing is going to be finding an equal level pack of mobs and parse data from them over an extended period of time with the same gear/talents and using only autoattacks.
---
Have they ever done a raid akin to TotC since then? I stopped raiding after Firelands and put the game down after Cata, so I don’t know.
---
It’s possible that TotC was an experiment they tried and never went back to, I don’t know for sure obviously
---
Blitz
---
I have never experienced that. This sounds made up, or you're being hyperbolic.
---
Kmagine caring so much about votes that you realized that they dont show up right away, even go as far as comparing to other subs.
---
I got devout shoulders first kill
---
Greed roll on my shaman ;)
---
I see you got your nose back.
---
Check out WoW Pro guides. It's what myself and many others have used and it goes from level 1 to 60
---
Yeah I don't get the hate. Obviously I'm not gonna tank if I have no idea where to go.
---
I'd say 23g per hour IS good pre-60.
---
Honestly, that's a better representation of how dwarf females Should look like!
---
Idk how many times this has to be repeated here.
---
With 305 weapon skill which you will get from talents the yellow hitcap is 6%. However this is only yellow meaning your abilities. The white hitcap is really big you won't ever hit it(like 24? or smth). 
---
So going above 6% is fine, it's still valuable, about 60-75% of 1% crit.
---
im lvl 53 mage, im wondering if there are some must do quests i should be doing? i already did the linken quest for the "spirit of aquamentas"  is there another quest out there like this one?
---
As I said, it's a possibility that it could happen right as phase 2 starts. It's not the norm at all and 99.99% of your kills with your DPS doing their job correctly they will not pull aggro, ever.
---
Yeah... some people like to smell the flowers this time around.
---
Their group their rules.
---
Good duel
---
That’s awesome, wish I was more artistic and creative. I got the mathematic / scientific style brain. :-/
---
&gt; Appranetly one of the human rogues who had 8% hit and antoher human rogue who had 14% hit rating had the same amount of white misses during the entire raid, i.e stating that the rogue who had 6% extra hit recieved no benefit from stackis hit, as he missed the same amount as the rogue wtih 8%. 
---
This just isn't correct. 
---
But yes you don't need to stack hit, you never had to.
---
They do but noobs cry that they don't get a spot in their raid.
---
You replied to me first :)
---
But he did tag the mob and he claimed the skin expertly.
---
You're an imbecile. If everybody was like you, videos like this wouldn't exist. That's all there is to it. Just basic human decency.
---
You don't minmax to be able to do the raid, you minmax to do it better. How do people not underatand that?
---
imagine actually rolling a hunter on classic, most broken useless shit class in game tbf
---
A couple of things.
---
Get rid of 5/5 parry and put it into impr BoM as you’ll need the extra 37 AP as that’s equivalent to 74 Str
---
Don’t put any in Prot, you waste 5 to get improv BoP and freedom it’s just not worth it in my opinion. (If you’re human which you should be if you’re PvPing, you’ll get enough hit from gear as you’ll only need 2% extra for PvP) 
---
I’d put 5 in improv pushback, 3/3 in in improv heals, 1 in consecration to help find those steathies and the rest into intellect
---
Trust me, in PvP you’ll be thankful for the increased sustain and so will your allies
---
Flying is what killed WoW for me. If they want to reintroduce it, it needs to cost a resource of some sort. Flying shouldn’t be used to quickly get somewhere. It should only be used to get somewhere you could not have gotten to to begin with.
---
Not sure what to make of weapons. 
---
Does weapon DPS only depend on weapon damage, as in, stats don't affect it?
---
Should I ignore stats when comparing weapons? I found a weapon that has a few DPS more, but has no stats. My old weapon has some strength and stamina. I'm a 35 warrior.
---
Why aren’t you using an authenticator?  Don’t you have a phone?
---
You care far too much run along now little one.
---
Weapons do not have a chance to hit stat. Odds are, the add-on he was using to see his hit % hadn't updated once he'd applied the scope. /reload or a re-log would've fixed that for him. But yeah no the scope improves YOUR hit chance. Just, only with the weap equipped
---

Hey mate. Welcome to the club! I‘m from austria and picked a german server as well. Glad you having a good time!
---
I saw the post a few weeks ago about layers going away. What's the current status, are they pretty much gone altogether now?
---
hunter got the tag tho
---
&gt; You end up outleveling the zone before you’re halfway through, so your options are to abandon the zone halfway through.
---
Zones scale with you as of 7.3.5.  So this isn’t the case anymore.
---
To be fair, if you did those zones during Cata, without heirlooms, the xp was tuned fine. 
---
It really only became a problem with the MoP and then WoD leveling xp changes. By WoD/Legion it was impossible to finish a Cata 1-60 zone without outleveling it.
---
These are the entitled private server players who think their way of playing is the only way
---
next to Joe
---
What a dummy,poor guy can't read
---
95% of your fights are going to be your pet tanking and you doing DPS. The other 5% is where for whatever reason pull aggro, in which case you will be tanking for a few seconds before your counter measures are executed. Your base health and armour will be more than enough to cover these situations. 
---
So while not technically true, you should assume that you won't be tanking for the purposes of deciding what stats to prioritise. Why ditch a small dps buff for a large health buff if your health isn't relevant?
---
Best thing on Reddit right now ...

He doesnt have to buy his mount so he aint worried bout nothin, he'l equip that shit for the flex.
---
Classic only.
---
I think I had maybe 50 as a rogue
---
Most important character in WoW
---
I mean im level 30 and only have like 20 gold so 🤷‍♂️
---
Sure, but not great, because all it does is boost your auto atk dmg.  So, 1% hit beyond 9% s like 0.5% dmg increase.
---
Maybe you got triple whooshed
---
I had about 40 at that level.
---
&gt; Am I really behind everyone at my level  
---
&gt; I have 120G  
---
no  
---
&gt; said he has 300G and started mocking me  
---
He was either being defensive because you have way more than he does, or he's an alt of a level 60 and 300g really is the sum total of his wealth, which at 60, is not great.  
---
If you told me you were a level 33 warrior and had 20g, I'd say "seems about right"
---
Not rly for m+ dungeons, you still need 2 ppl to teleport you there. And if you do high keys you need to interact alot in the dungeon too trust me
---
I hate when your own kind steals from you in WoW. If a Thorium Batman isn't around there is no way to root out this time of behavior. 
---
I had a Liferoot stolen from me by a gonome. Twelveinches on Deviate Delight, if you read this know that you should eat twelve inches!

There is zygor which is kinda the paid verison of aap that goes from 1-60. I havent used it, but my friend said it was worth it.

Is that the best set to get?

I mean "may trick enemies" is pretty cut and dry. Only real issue he could bitch about is that his didn't even go off. But he's probably on a potato and doesn't know what latency is. I have never once seen what happened to him. Certainly not game breaking.

Look for gear with the most int on it, aoe skills have terrible spell damage scaling anyway.

No way I'm trying retail again. The game isn't good and classic has so much to do. I'm only 53

Ty guys :)

Masterpiece
---
We can kick your ass: If our seals proc.
---
We can tank you to heaven and hell: If we're not on CD.
---
We can straight up outheal your damage: if our heals crit.
---
So I know what you're asking.
---
What CAN'T we do? *Let me just roll this dice real quick and find out.* :(
---
I’m getting #1 dps as daggers, by a wide margin with my perdition.
---
Play what you want. Anything can be viable. Dont listen to forum whiners.
---
I probably had like.. 19 gold at that level
---
Not actually, i prefer to roleplay myself, and how I would be if i were in THAT world instead.
---
We're leveling as a group of 4. I'll be a warrior so I will tank the dungeons from time to time. Is it better to be fury or arms with regards to tanking or should I just go all in as prot?
---
Then don't play the game.
---
That reminds me, I need to buy some gold.
---
Heck.
---
Thought it's gonna be cringy meme fiesta.
---
Ended up subscribing. Amazing work keep it up!
---
If I’m not mistaken, you’re actually doing really well with 23 g already.  Do a couple dungeons, and continue to farm resources/AH anything extra..  You start making even more money as you raise a couple levels.
---
Everyone I’ve ever known that had a ton of gold at those level did an insane amount of gathering trade skills, often at the expense of leveling, or got some really lucky BOE drops they AH’d.  
---
I didn’t have the mount money at 40 (Im tailoring and enchanting and was buying whatever I was lacking to keep it skilled up) but I got insanely lucky shortly after, 4 Golden Pearls within 15 minutes at the same spot.  I’m 48 now and think I have 10 gold to my name.  But hey my enchanting and tailoring are 250+, and I’ve been very fortunate to have raiding guildies kicking me high level recipes.
---
It's Ironic that retail fails because they couldn't realize that when people botched about those little things that we think we wanted it changed, but we dont
---
It does matter. Tanks have harder time to build their threat even if you can feign in the end.
---
yea absolutely, I do get the most healing done in the raid but I waste alot of mana doing lesser healing wave on dpsers when they get chunked
---
This is insane
---
You couldn't do that if you tried!
---
Not even worth listing at that point. But yea it’s too easy to obtain
---
You forgot truestrike shoulders and being orc with both dal'rends. How anyone can min/max hard enough to wear full leather as a warrior but not buy axe if the deep woods blows my mind.
---
Perhaps try and start a conversation?
---
What was pre nerfed ?
---
They turned it into a high chair game
---
Back then you’d have different things like not every allowing a Druid/paladin to tank. Now it’s about the META and running things ASAP. Less about a slow paced enjoyment - but it was never intentionally a slow paced enjoyment of the game anyway, that was just a by-product of us being new and noob.
---
You can find this again but you need to seek out groups with your thinking. Advertise for a guild with your ethic and make the effort to add people to friends list when they are helpful/enjoyable to play with.
---
It takes work, but you’ll be able to foster your own mini-community. 
---
You could advertise that your an easy going - enjoy the moment - player and invite people to join a group channel as a way to make grouping easier.
---
Quit retail a long time ago. Classic only.
---
I've done the entire run with 53s. It should be no problem.
---
You got it mixed up, 1STR is 2AP, not the other way around.
---
37 AP is 18,5 STR
---
By no means am I expecting to be cutting edge raid master, I just want to enjoy the game the way it used to be. I have no idea about how to build the specs properly, or how to play it efficiently, or do this or that, and neither am I going to look it up on wowiki😆 I want the classic experience as it was for you lot back in 2006 :D, although like I said I don't want to be pumping hours in to be told 'nah you can't raid' either 
---
I was leaning towards Spriest tbf. I more than likely won't play Ret Pally because I have one on retail but it was just a scenario :D
---
It goes for about 25G on skeram. I got one as well and sold it for mount money
---
Agreed but for one part; they destroyed unholy DK tanking ability in patch 3.1.
---
I bought mine for my twink for 25g just two weeks ago.
---
ye boi das me B^)
---
I think either fury or arms are fine to tank dungeons to start off and you only really go prot once you're 60 because if you do any solo content it'll be a lot slower.
---
It ain't easy being an elf, apparently
---
Can corfirm wasted a lot of time on pservers
---
Didn’t show up in my addons after downloading
---
My input may not be incredibly helpful here, but I have only had my FD not trigger once or twice now, aside from being resisted (which the game tells you). It could have something to do with inputs, here is how I do it to lay traps (every time, no macros, each step very deliberately):
---
Ctrl+3 to pull pet off the mob
---
Ctrl+5 to FD as soon as my pet starts to move back (NOT immediately after ctrl+3, so that my pet doesn't land an auto attack due to latency/input delay and keep me in combat)
---
Spam the shit out of my trap button
---
I think the key here that may be lost due to time, is patience and deliberation. In vanilla, there was latency; local input, home network, internet. We were much slower to make inputs to the game because we had to be, and we were just used to it. Nowadays, there is such low latency in all of those steps that we tend to just mash through our sequence as fast as possible; that just doesn't work here.
---
I know that this isn't a solution to the bug. It's just my experience as a vanilla hunter who rolled hunter again in classic. Slow down your inputs, verify you get the desired response from each step, and continue your sequence. It might help minimize how many times this bug gets you killed.
---
Ret was just to get the point across, I have one on retail so I won't roll it. But I am seriously considering SPriest...
---
It's across the board as long as you have daggers equipped
---
we got 2 druids, 1 tank and 1 healer. gotta have battleress ^^
---
other than that shammys top the meters, fights are so short so if you bring enough consumables they shouldn't really oom
---
I believe if you're running a 2H you want weapons with a slower speed but higher top end damage. If you're dual wielding I think you go for dps on them.
---
Funny how you say that when you didn't even read the thread before commenting
---
Should put renew 1 sec before shield
---
wears off =)
---
Otherwise it’s wasted mana :)
---
Cool thanks
---
Nice! I just managed to complete this set as well. Not quite preBiS but i am simply thrilled!! Got the chest my very first UBRS run as the only priest in the group. The shoulders were indeed hell though.
---
You have to like hold groups hostage at gun point to force them to do the whelp encounter bc so many are traumatized by the leeroy video! When it first dropped (after about 6 or 7 runs) i lost it to a warlock and almost fell out of my chair.
---
It dropped for me on the very next run after that thankfully! We look so lovely in lavender!!
---
Cheers man, im happy you liked it. Thanks!
---
Oh baby a triple
---
(mage) Why doesn’t this macro work for me:
---
/use [mod:shift] Blizzard(Rank 1); Blizzard
---
/use [mod:ctrl] Flamestrike; Blizzard
---
I’ve selected in my settings for my command key (Mac) to be regarded as control. When I press it I see Flamestrike’s tooltip but it’s not being casted. Works for Blizzard(Rank 1) though
---
I’ve also tried this way:
---
/use [nomod] Blizzard
---
/use [mod:shift] Blizzard(Rank 1)
---
/use [mod:ctrl] Flamestrike
---
Any help? Thanks in advance
---
Level as fury or arms. Prot is not necessary until raiding, and really does not get much benefit when you only have 10 or so points in it. The extra damage you do as not-prot will make up for not having threat generating talents, and dungeons pre 50 do not hurt much at all.
---
Lower pop servers are at 1 layer. Higher pop servers are at 2 layers during busy hours.
---
Warlock is sick as hell
---
Tanks often only need one thing or don’t need anything, how is them selling a service “toxic”
---
Nope, I’m too old to call it that
---
In retail there is no talking because it’s 100% pointless. Cross realm means you will never have to interact with those players again. On classic you get to know other people. Get to know good tanks or rude players.
---
This is amazing.
---
Quicker leveling happened because of the sheer amount of people playing at max lvl vs people at lower lvls, so if people didnt make alts, you would basically left in a barren wasteland. 
---
Same reasoing with LFG (With cross-realm).
---
I did read it "huntard had 1 random event happen to him, bitches about game being broken, crys about" don't say resist"
---
I’m definitely in the same boat. A LFG tool, but it just doesn’t teleport you anywhere. I think it would make group finding easier. Right now it’s just spam the channels until someone finally responds and some people don’t know about the Looking for group channel.
---
Ret pallies will definitely be more desired than shadow priests, and do better damage in dungeons. They suck ass to level, though.
---
Maybe it’s this server specifically, I can’t be bothered to reroll again on another PVP server but everyone seems so toxic or unfriendly compared to Mirage Raceway where I have a level 42. 
---
Maybe I should go back, I love world PVP but part of me wonders if when phase 2 comes out we’ll see more of it on there.
---
After playing BFA for a while I stopped playing for months. I’m back now only on classic. My mate switches between
---
That doesn't make any sense.
---
I've played all the way through to bfa besides vanilla. Legion was the most fun I've had since wrath. But bfa wore down on me and the guild I was in real fast. So many problems, so much frustration, so much marketing that turned out to be crap content. I've rolled with every punch blizzard threw at me, but bfa and diablo immortal's announcement tapped me out, completely.
---
The idea is, you gotta adapt and talk to people. If you don't like what the tank's attitude is, you have to find another one and eventually befriend one that you actually like (ideally both as a tank and a party teammate).
---
Or, just become a tank.
---
If you'd rather not, because its too much work, maybe that's why they're setting some requirements? Back in the day, tanks were the leaders of the group, they decide how the run goes, but at the same time are responsible for the whole group. It's a give and take kind of thing.
---
Its very obvious... because they make the objective of the entire group about themselves. It defeats the point of an MMORPG.
---
I have like 9 of those, they never sell on the AH for me.
---
I uninstalled my dps meter cause it made the game less fun for me due to me caring about my dps.
---
IDGAF if I am not too dps, as long as we are winning
---
Of course he got the tag, he's a hunter. Try being a rogue or pally getting these tags. Idk why he's proud of getting a tag as a hunter.
---
Lol my warrior is LVL 32 and I have all of like 9 gold so....I'd say your pretty good bro
---
Maybe I'll just play safe with a mage or something then. I always enjoyed the class I just thought I might try something different. But maybe retail is better for experimenting with :D
---
exactly, one way for us farming gold is to reserv. so reserving sellables or none needed items is just fine.
---
Most warriors have like 20 gold at lvl 40
---
I do see a difference though. I have coversations in dungeon runs, but thats not the most important difference i see. Its that people take time for each other. If someone makes a mistake, or you wipe, you just keep going again. You take time in looking for people, walking to the instance and thats what makes the difference. In retail, if someone makes a mistake, you kick him/her and get someone els in a few seconds. Players are way more replacable in retail, that seems to make players toxic somehow. Im for keeping it the way in the current state.
---
I recently played Deep Rock Galactic which has the same kind of ceiling creeps. The first time it got me it was full on 'Nam flashbacks from Half-Life for me I was straight up unable to process it and was just screaming something incomprehensible to my friends. Some scars never heal.
---
Most raid groups might take 1 spriest. No one will bring that ret though.
---
Nothing besides tanking for a fee
---
Make an alt hunter or lock
---
Been shared a few times yes, a true Classic.
---
And the dance specifically is [the smug dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdi19AZvHkQ) from A Hat In Time. kinda fitting for Chromie to be the one doing it.
---
EDIT: I don't know where the dancing to that song came from there seems to be several videos like that but I don't think the song itself is in A Hat In Time.
---
Not really.  Besides your mage wand quest there’s not a quest reward you’ll want over gear drops from the late game dungeons.
---
I used to be the annoyed person with people saying stuff over and over until I became that person in the last alleyway with strat live. Every time I didn’t say pull it back the tank would rush in and cause a wipe pulling both side rooms.
---
Somewhere else (can't remember now if it was another thread) I mentioned that the base idea of giving talents more meaning, as in "every talent being more impactful in your playstyle" was a good idea.
---
The bad part was the execution, as "Let's give 1 talent out of 3 every 15 levels). Talents being more impactful? Hell yeah!
---
Making it so people still just use the same build with 2 slight variants anwyay? Bad execution.
---
No, you're gonna play a game with 2 digit poligon characters and you're gonna like it get back at farming dire maul young man
---
I understand this kind of. I lost the game one specc at a time... First was Prot Paladin I just gut in TBC but lost after wrath when the removed all his stuff and replaced with generic, unneeded extra resource system with some useless light points. Same goes for Shadow priest for me. Last was mage,who turned into a reaction pattern game, at least fire and frost I remember. Wait for Crit, screen flashes. Instant crit with fireblast. Flashes again. Press 3 for the Pyro instant. That's it. It's not more than spaming frostbolt, just,more stressful. 
---
For the visuals it died when everything starts to glow. Why has everything a yellow border? It looks insanly stupid and has no more immersion.
---
Except for war honestly. T3 is really awesome and I think it was never ever beaten.
---
Sequential casting does not seem to be available in classic. One macro press = one GCD only.
---
See you're a prime example of toxic behaviour. You're so arrogant to assume your role as a tank is superior to others. Yes tanking comes with its challenges. If you don't like it don't play one.
---
You're meant to be a team player and play the game as intended. Not assume just because you're in high demand its fair to reserve items or tell other people the runs going to go. Skipping essential parts. You talk about elitism but you're the only one trying to prove how important you are by insisting on having you way. Because you deserve it? Sure you do... you're the tank and everything resolves around you right?
---
That's why I said post with given proof/evidence, for example screenshots or video.
---
I was looking through the comment store make sure I wasnt the only one who got it. Phew.
---
Blackrock
---
I've been specced holy since I started aside from wand and spirit those will still be essential of you plan to solo grind
---
And then the resist happens :(
---
I see 5 paragraphs of text but all i read is hoes mad
---
What the French call a certain "I don't know what."
---
Except the top rankings are usually dominated by a few guilds, because the top guilds tend to have the top players.
---
Of course I know who's aggroing. He's me.
---
I got it
---
If you’re not actively making connections on your way to 60 then a lot of your disappointment is on you. By now a lot of the players have made friends, formed guilds, and communicate over discord or other services. I’ve been leveling, dungeoning, and raiding now with the same set of people I met on day and level one. I log on, and i recognize players in trade chat, lfg chat, and just generally around in the game. I wave at people I know in passing, get whispered frequently by people on my flist for dungeons, or for enchanting, etc. If you’re not putting in the effort to be part of any aspect of the community on your server, then your experience will not live up to your expectations; Especially now that more and more waves of players are nearing 60, you’ll end up as some “random” player in a pug group with zero history with other players. These people will overlook you if you’re not adding anything to the experience beyond just pressing key binds. Your predicament is of your own making.
---
You still get full xp for quests, even if thre mobs are 0 xp.
---
Honestly, if that happens to you repeatedly you're probably really bad at the game.
---
Glad I could help!
---
I mainly switched because the server I was on Sulfuras, felt extremely imbalanced, whenever I was questing it felt like I would never see alliance and got constantly ganked by groups of horde. 
---
Not sure if switching has helped or not yet.
---
They are from the Halloween event. Trick or treat at an innkeeper and you have a chance of getting one
---
Yeah, I noticed dungeons seemed way easier than I remember. Doing blizzard on elite level mobs was always a death sentence but now everyone is doing it with ease.
---
Sc2 is still somewhat active and wc3 reforged should at least for a while be big. But outside of blizzard I can't think of any recent successful ones
---
Watching this with no sound while listening to 'Babushka Boy' by A$AP Rocky
---
Thank me later
---
I find most of the less hardcore, chill people are reaching 50-60 now so i would expect more supportive groups. I am 51 now and have never had a negative group and i run dungeons almost everyday.
---
This was the post that made me unsub. Thanks!
---
We will not give someone Mageblade because they passed on Sorcerous Dagger or Staff of Dominance. If they didn't need either of those weapons then they don't need Mageblade.
---
Yes, try it for yourself and see. AOE tanking at least as a warrior requires a much higher APM than the other two roles, along with much more awareness of your surroundings and positioning than DPS. AND the meta of being expected to run the dungeon for the others and know all the packs, their pulls, and their kill orders by heart.
---
Onyxia at the end 🤣
---
Yeah its basically is. Now only use shadowbolts to not fill debuff slot on bosses 🙈
---
Na 100g is about right. 150-200g is a bit high. More would only make sense if you're on a low pop server.
---
A lot, not most. I understand your intent though.
---
I also use 'threat plates' I think that's what you're looking for actually.
---
Stop buying all skills and stop disenchanting everything. 
---
Some items better to sell than DE.
---
 
---
And simply continue leveling. At 42 there's 5 quests in Uldaman, that give 2-3 gold rewards, plus items that could be sole for 2-3 gold.  
---
Almost nobody got 100 gold at level 40, majority of players get mount around 43-44. And then at 50 you would be sitting at 200+ gold.
---
I was extremely disappointed when I found out gnomes don't have this dance in-game.
---
I saw a mob dodge a Spell I casted (even played the dodge animation) and it was casting a Fireball to my face.
---
I’ve got max characters in bfa, I’ll swap over and do some bg’s sometimes. Though my neck piece is way under leveled and my gear score is 400. I’d definitely play more if my buddies wanted to play 2’s or 3’s. I’m in the process of leveling another character to 60. If I was max level I’d dabble in retail pvp more.
---
Corporate greed, snowflakes and PC politics
---
Still sounds like a grind, brother. Good on you. Make more!!! Lord knows, I’m not going to attempt it
---
Was doing a advertised full BRD run, only to have the healer ask why we are clearing a certain part of the dungeon, demand we finish the dungeon because he has to leave, then next boss rolls on a tank item and leaves the group without saying anything. The classic experience.
---
they aren't worth the exact same to everyone. if you think about basic economics, the market is healthiest when goods are sold above the lowest price a seller would be willing, and below the maximum a buyer would be willing to purchase. the purchasing price for a BoE is below the amount of benefit received by the class using the item. 
---
If you're trying to tell me that overall benefit (this includes the emotional impact of receiving the item) of a warden staff, or any given BoE, is equal to the amount of gold that it's being sold for then you don't understand basic economics.
---
since I doubt you'd believe me, think about it like this. A BoE drops for warlocks. If a non-warlock received it, how much gold is their minimum selling point? If a warlock received it, how much gold is their minimum selling point? For the warlock it will surely be a higher amount. It is worth more to the classes that can use it. It is not an equal benefit to anyone who rolls for the item.
---
Retail sucks
---
Hm. Yeah late night world is a lot more fun when people go to sleep and we all get to shit talk each other at 5am. I'm not sure world chat could ever have meaningful discussion during the day due to the amount of people on it though.
---
I wouldn't complain if it was all force contained into LFG. Some kind of notice board might be interesting, but the problem is for some classes it takes long enough to find a group they'd want to be doing something in the world while they wait. And accessible anywhere noticeboards starts pushing things imo.
---
THIS is why I go on Reddit.
---
Why do we make such poor decisions. :(
---
the thing is, pre bis and bis are gear items you will use for a long time. so it makes sense that youd forgo picking items that arnt said long term items (like prebis/bis would be). because you never know whose been farming that item for weeks.
---
some like you dont care, they say "well i just want some gear" but its just bad manners to do so.
---
i gave it a slight mention before, but imagine your a caster dps (like a mage or warlock) and your farming strath left and right trying to get the magistrate to drop the crimson felt hat, this item gives 30 spell dmg and 8 int 8 stam with 8 spirit. by all means its a dpsers item...now imagine a healer comes in that has a green 25 +heal helm and they roll need on the dps item.
---
they win it and your left shit out of luck.
---
why is this senario bad?, because the priest in question will eventually see one of the 2 BoEs that ARE pre-bis for him/her on the AH and they will likely buy them (and then vendor the CFH). something the caster DPS cannot do
---
by rolling need on an item that player didnt actually need, they screwed the other player.
---
and this happens across alot of different specs, such as dps warriors rolling on tank gear. tanks rolling dps warrior gear ect
---
you roll for gear thats bis for your main spec so you dont bend other people over a table. at the very least you should ask the group to make sure (particularly the person that would likely be farming the item) if its ok for you to roll for a non bis item
---
most will be ok with it, its better to be sure then to be a cunt.
---
Being in demand does not give  the tank the right to reserve an item. Fair enough they can do it... nothing stopping them. But its important to know the only person here who has any concept of being owed anything is the person reserving the item... no one else is ever expecting to be owed anything... okay?
---
Its going to be a lot. A LOT more fun if you do those dungeons with friends, either real life or ones you've made in game. Dont focus too much on the loot, focus on having fun. If you are not having fun getting loot, why even play a game that has loot as endgame?
---
Anyone have enough gold ? Doubt
---
I want Thrall dance for Orcs! #onechange
---
6g each? Man what server, those are like 30s on Grobbulus everything is selling for pennies
---
Ahhh A hat in time that damn smug dance gets me so much
---
Original Original: https://youtu.be/dbn-QDttWqU (AHIT)
---
I don't *think* it's bannable, but if you get scammed in this kind of transaction, Blizzard won't help you.
---
Nope I’m not, I don’t care that I’m not, I try hard to make my runs smooth I invite anyone who wants to come to the dungeon and only blacklist players who are assholes or ninja, only 3 on my list so far. I explain pulls to new people and even if they are bad I don’t leave group or refuse to run with them in the future. 
---
I’m saying you are probably a shit player either in skill or attitude to have this much issue finding groups in the game. That or your a class that needs an item the tank keeps reserving and mad about it.
---
Can you make money from alchemy without having the high end recipes? I have herbalism and alchemy as professions and I am wondering if I would make more money turning the herbs into health/mana/fire resistance potions or just selling the herbs. I have been considering dropping alchemy for skinning. Level 32 warlock.
---
Is anyone going to tell this guy that a skill up is more important than the ore?
---
Someone making for threat for themselves doesn’t mean the tank is building less. As long as you FD before you the boss starts to attack you ofc.
---
This is magnificent
---
I learned to turn that collage setting way the fuck down early on. Damn near impossible to find herbs with it cranked up.
---
"Tight, tight, tight! Yeah!"
---
Thought mage trainers taught portals. Got to level 38 before someone made it known to me. I'm cringing at all the time I've lost travelling.
---
I say give it a run and if you find you can’t do it with your spec, then change it.
---
Ya. That and Kara. I raided Ulduar 3x a week in hardcore guild. Eventually became the top resto Druid on my server. Life loom for days.
---
My girl named her Tauren “Udderlycute”
---
What song is this? I can already tell itll pop into my head 6 months from now and drive me crazy because I wont remember what it is lol
---
Except for you, who believes they are owed full runs by every tank they play with. Are you actually challenged to understand this? The tanks aren't "owed" anything by reserving. They simply have the ability to do it and there is nothing stopping you from playing a tank or playing in a different group. It is YOUR problem and to take that further, YOU ARE THE PROBLEM by posting this kind of inane bullshit. Grow up and maybe make some friends who want to help you get geared.
---
User death imminent
---
Wowhead says 47%(that's close to 50%), I killed 6 dust devil when I farmed boar ribs and coyote meat and I got 4 magic dust.
---
Been playing MMOs for roughly 15 years now and not much has changed in the general opinions people hold. 
---
Players can almost always be split into 2 groups. Those who think the game should be harder/more punishing and those who think it should be convenient and more accessible. 
---
I have played FFXIV for several years now and I genuinely like the game - but it caters heavily to the so called “casual crowd” in everything it does. It’s apparent the devs believe everyone should be able to access all content. The combat classes have been heavily homogenised over the years so that you can play whatever you want without feeling like your class is missing out on something another has. With their latest expansion they really gutted a couple of the classes and that was the deciding factor for me to play Classic as my primary game. They’ve done what Blizzard did with retail and have hit a point where they’ve pushed the casual focus too far and it’s genuinely ruined the combat system for me.
---
This is why the WoW fan base is so divided and vicious towards each other at the moment (when really, we have the best of both worlds now and don’t need to fight). Classic was a smart move by Blizz that has allowed for these constantly warring points of view (hard vs accessible) to both get want they want without any changes for one or the other having an effect on its opposite.
---
Ur moms house
---
That stomp killed me. Top tier content
---
I think what's happening is the casual players who just want to have fun/dont care as much about bis are still lvl30-45
---
Individual greedyness ruined the game, find a community and you find a great home. Who cares about your God damn epic mount.
---
Cool, I hate it.
---
This video is based on an A Hat In Time video with a similar title https://youtu.be/dbn-QDttWqU it uses Hat Kid's smug dance!
---
The title is a reference to a song tied to the game. I'd seriously recommend people try  A Hat In Time if you like Mario 64/Mario Sunshine type games
---
On the last few packs in UBRS it's still a good idea to sheep one of two of the orcs.  Not unusual for a hunter to ice trap one either.
---
This isn't Wrath, you really shouldn't just AOE/cleave everything.
---
It's against the ToS. Because tokens don't exist in classic itself, you're effectively trading classic gold for cash (that you use against your subscription).
---
In classic, the playing field is supposed to be level. Everyone has to make due with what they can make ingame. I understand wanting time, but it means someone is getting currency for something they did outside classic.
---
Fury is trash until you can get + hit purps.
---
I made all my money selling the Schematic for Cloaking device... costs 20 silver or something and respawns every 15 minutes or so. Sells for over a gold each time on AH. 
---
I would camp the vendor while working from home lol
---
I’m not sure about that. I was just using a stopwatch, timing each Claw
---
Sounds like you got layered
---
Currently Level 34, I have 12g.
---
Leveling priest is boring as fuck but it's alright max level
---
farming gear and money is basically what wow is about. doing the same dungeons and raids over and over again is very literally what the game is designed for.
---
pvp and such is a filler activity in classic, nothing can be done effectively without the pve content we have to spam.
---
but that doesnt mean you have too spam them. just hit 60? take a break, do some weird shit...help some low lvls, explore do whatever it is youd prefer to do.
---
 then maybe do a daily dungeon, it'll take you a while too farm gear but atleast you'll have your sanity.
---
Hey guys, it's just a classic case of supply and demand.
---
The supply of tanks is lower than the demand, so naturally the price of tanks goes up:)
---
I'm a fucking idiot... :D
---
1: pick a class you think looks cool
---
2: focus on having fun
---
thats it go get em boss
---
Haha, I'll take my aoe farming any day. I'd rather kill 5-10 at a time and drink after every fight than kill one at a time continuously. But I did recently get my Hunter to 20. I like hunters. 
---
If only I knew that 3 points in improved blizzard would override CoC slow... Now I need a 5g respsec.
---
Good news is that after you run each instance once or twice, even if you get insulted in every possible way, on next runs you will know as much as these veterans.   
---
I know this feeling aswell. I am playing a tank and I had no clue about routes, aggro ranges ect for the complex instances like BRD or Scholo, but after doing these instances once, my next runs looks like I've been farming this instances every single day and know every single corner of it.   
---
So yeah - even if people flame you, just repord politely that you are new, finish the dungeon and on next run you will be on par with everyone else.
---
HAHAHAAH this is gold
---
I play a holy priest so its easy to get groups and no loot conflicts with tanks... so yeah. Some people just dont have self interest at heart all the time
---
The engineer’s lure adds 100 skill
---
Only classic.  Dropped retail when the first expansion came out.
---
&gt;Inefficiency is a pet-peeve of mine, and I'll be damned if I'm not riding a mount by level 40-42
---
Doing quests to make money, especially higher level quests, is still your best option tbh. Especially finding grinding quests you can do. Someone down here suggested farming basilisks and if that's true I would quest in Tanaris as there are basalisks scattered around so you can make sure to kill those while you quest. 
---
Truth is though if you don't have your mount by 40, the fastest way to get it is to keep leveling up. A level 42 can grind mobs faster than a level 40 and think of all the quest turn in rewards you get in 2 levels. 
---
Basically the most efficient way is to skip any quests that look like too much travel time and kill EVERYTHING you see and sell EVERYTHING you get and buy NOTHING.
---
when I raided a few months ago in BFA on retail, someone in my guild had this mod
---
he would use it during breaks but mostly our raid leader wanted to kick him any time he saw that shit spammed in chat
---
Thank you for calling me shit and then claiming not to be toxic. I really believe you.
---
“Odd Grps got the left, even grps got the right. That means 1,3,5,7 left. 2,4,6,8 right. 7 and 8 are whelp groups.
---
“Ok listen the fuck up. You are going to dps very very slowly. And by slowly I mean fucking slow. If you get aggro, it means you lose 50 dkp because you didn’t know what the fuck to do. And watch the fucking tail. If you get into the whelps, you lose 50 dkp again, for not being where the fuck you were supposed to be.
---
“There is no aggro reset. There’s some shit about an aggro reset when people don’t know how to manage their aggro. After 2 sunders you can basically start doing damage to it. Assuming you know how aggro works and don’t over aggro.
---
“Ok nuke it, dot it. Help the whelp groups. When it's in phase 2, nuke it as hard as possible. You want to get it down as fast as possible. Have dots up on every time, 2 rows, Shadow Word: Pain, Warlock curses, Rends, everything. I don't see enough dots, more dots now. Come on more DPS. Hit it like you mean it. You'll have time to rest in phase 3 while I'm getting the aggro. Remember, save all your aggro reducing abilities for when it lands. That means Feign Death, Vanish, fucking Fade, anything you can use to reset aggro.”
---
“At 40% you will stop dots, until then you will throw more dots. Throw more dots, more dots, more dots, come on more dots. Ok, stop dots. Now hit it very hard and very fast. Lee run to the center, Mulgras run to the center, Forsyte run to the center, Nurf run to the center, Isis run to the center. Whatever the fuck you do, do not stand next to other people. Mulgras, center. Just heal me. Lee do not... Go away from the head, Lee. Go away. Ok DPS, slowly. Come here you fucking cunt. Watch the tail!”
---
“Whelps!”
---
“Crushim was feared into...”
---
“Who the fuck was that? Crushim, what the fuck? Whelps, left side! Even side! Many whelps! Now, handle it! Fuck! That's a fucking 50dkp minus! What the fuck was that shit? If you stand in the right fucking place, there is no way you are going to fucking get into the goddamn whelps, whatever fucking Fear, tailswipe, whatever the fuck, OK? It's like one in a fucking million. From the fucking north corner to the middle into the fucking whelp cave, IT'S NOT EVEN FUCKING REMOTELY IMAGINABLE!”
---
I shall deliver yer words to that pinned comment.
---
No, that's due to poor execution of that idea.
---
Looks alright but I strongly recommend going into Prot to get Improved Hammer of Justice. Also grab redoubt instead of Imp Devo, Devo aura barely makes a difference and you will be using a 1h and shield.
---
There's a lot of dungeon farming, but you can skip a lot of it by being a bit cheeky. either by farming gold which is almost always considerably faster, or by just getting decent items instead of prebis, and waiting for raid upgrades. Lots of other stuff to grind though, gold consumables various pvp stuff.
---
Letting others pick your class is asking for a bad experience
---
Is deep frost or deep arcane (still geared frost) better for 5 man dungeons ?
---
She looks high as fuck.
---
What song is this tho
---
What do you mean?
---
You can’t buy that recipe from a vendor.
---
Yeah.
---
That's the shit that bothers me the most.  You're a fucking war but you're spamming LF tank in trade.  I don't let DPS wars join my groups.
---
Healers that throw around pw:s + renew like crazy and always run oom. So I say np ill take over healing. On my enchant shm, with no int gear.
---
Or healers preshadowform who probably dont even have heal spells on their hotbar. Its cool if you wanna dps shadow but can you maybe back up heal if you see our healer is oom.
---
This made me whole
---
i'm no macro expert but isn't it /cast not /use? /use is for items in your inventory. This is how I would write it (again not an expert so spaces and stuff might be wrong):
---
/cast [mod:shift] Blizzard(rank 1); [mod:ctrl] Flamestrike; Blizzard
---
It’s not against the ToS, it’s just not protected by Blizzard. GM’s have confirmed this.
---
Honestly I mostly watch anyone with an Apes twitch tag, all are very good players and normally pretty relaxed stream with no many viewers so they talk to chat.
---
Retail is only good for running through old content.
---
I do love the new level sync feature, though.
---
https://youtu.be/uq-gYOrU8bA sound the alarm
---
Skip, but anytime i see someone ask for it the group does it. Try asking the leader before starting the dungeon
---
I'm assuming for the last macro you'll have to press it several times?
---
Mexican tank on thalnos here, me love you.
---
Sooo your just being mad for the sake of being mad? Sounds fun, I’m sure your a blast at party’s in and out of game. 
---
Also all my runs have plenty of communication, about the game and other stuff. 
---
If your on skeram I’ll take you along for a fun time, first grey drop reserved for tank of course!
---
Me searching for Humar the Pridelion.
---
Hunter and warlock are easier because they have a pet.
---
Warrior and rogue are hard.
---
The rest are in between.
---
You should focus in having fun.
---
The hippigryphs in south feralas drop a lot of good vendor trash and they are only around lvl 44.
---
I know the struggle :D
---
It sometimes works to suggest it as a compromise... "If you have to go crazy right away, do it on the skull target". It's what you want to happen anyway, but you don't have to tell that to the trigger happy dps :D
---
If you ain't smug dancing on dead characters you ain't smug dancing at all
---
I can’t believe how far machinima videos have come
---
Congrats, thats something i never managed in vanilla, seen the wildheart legs once, lost to a rogue. Hell im still dont know if ive had em drop.
---
Holy crap they're listed for 6g+ on my server. Doubt they sell but damn.
---
I think it’s more of an issue on PvP servers. I really can’t think of a downside otherwise.
---
I was actually thinking paladin
---
Nah, I tank and never have a problem finding a group because of it, but this is my first time in WoW since a brief incursion when it was first introduced all those years ago, meaning I know nothing. 
---
The only thing you said that really holds any water is that a tank needs to have awareness of his surroundings, and the DPS others are dealing, which is of absolute zero consequence thanks to add on’s. 
---
Tanking isn’t hard, it’s just that fury sounds attractive because people inherently like to deal the damages, but again dedicating yourself tank means you’ll never have a problem getting a group.
---
You get so many random buffs in retail that most people don't even notice a drive by buffing. One more buff on top of the other 10 you have is hard to notice.
---
Welp, they beat the game.
---
&gt;whatever you did against Freya to make her heroic
---
Left the three elder tree guys alive.
---
The way hard modes were implemented in Ulduar was fantastic. I wish more raids had done it that way. 
---
Karazhan will just always be number 1 to me.
---
What’s SOP
---
Taunt and Mocking blow are oh shit buttons and if that's how you're holding onto mobs then you're not doing it right.  Tab, shield block, and revenge.  Spam battleshout to get mobs you come to you.
---
Don't wear mitigation gear in dungeons. In vanilla there is this paradox - the better your pure mitigation tank gear is the harder time you will have tanking content you outgear as you will never have enough rage.   
---
That's why in general +defence stat is so useless in vanilla except for couple super hard hitting bosses - it makes you mitigate so good that you don't get any rage.   
---
+str/+sta/+armor is better alternative - you have more hp and take less damage from all attacks, but still generate some rage
---
Chrome is best girl.
---
One press will do all of that once. You can then spam for consecutive heals.
---
Zul farrak zombies is good apparently
---
Nice. What about paladin appeals to you?
---
No, it' simply gearing issue. You shouldn't stack mitigation gear in Classic, except for very few hard hitting bosses.
---
Any camp that drops good loot should be good
---
This, they even said in an interview it’s okay, but won’t do shit if you get scammed.
---
My experience with that was that my PvE skills kept getting nerfed because of a gameplay mode I never even used (BGs). It was incredibly frustrating at the time.
---
For the horde!
---
My theory: the "classic experience" is mostly just "new realm launch experience". This doesn't wear out so quickly because the game at the classic state is designed for spending time in the field, travelling, interacting with other players for elite quests, dungeons, world pvp etc. instead of streamlined solo-leveling and match-made, teleported-to dungeoneering.
---
But once guilds settle down and isolate players from each others, and levelling is not a common thing to do anymore, "classic experience" will fade.
---
As a compary running this thing, you need to invalidate achievements to re-engage players. Launch a new realm to reroll or launch new major content patches to bring players back into the world. Realm-wide events like Ahn Qiraj opening are related too I guess.
---
This list is very wrong considering rogues arent s tier, only warriors are. Hunters are below lovks and mages (you scale worse) fearl druids are much below that. And i think it's agreed boomie is worst
---
Yeah int is always a good trait to go for, but that goes back into crit. Sorry I thought that goes without saying.
---
I got that. But that's not a reference, it's just an expression. A reference implies it's a direct quote from some well-known context (like a line from a show or a movie).
---
You're mistaking player choice with player restriction.
---
You are restricted to choose one spec and because those specs are mostly badly designed (*^1), you're forcing players to play with a spec that only works in a specific use-case (fine) and having to spend time doing something that is not fun (farming), oftentimes with a non-effective spec (tank? healer?) before being able to afford to switch back to something they actually enjoy. And repeat this every time they have to switch back.
---
That is not "giving a choice", it's forcing the player doing something they don't like.
---
*^1 The vanilla talent trees were clearly made by rpg lovers, not necessarily by people that also knew how to design a balanced system, check on TBC talent trees and skills for classes with 3 fully working specs that were actually fun and viable.
---
at the realm selection screen it will show you if a realm has layers or not at the moment. They've announced which servers are done with layering so you can probably find that list someowhere if you google.
---
Plaued priest forever. Tried warlock, it sucked. At least for me.
---
Now, if you want arguments.. 
---
They have the best 1v1 capacity of all classes. They are able to solo any (or just about) elite quest. They are great for solo play, and great for group play (read summons, aoe dungeons, raid dps). They have no downtime when drain tanking becomes available to them (roughly lvl 30-35). They get 3x the health most classes can get if using void sacrifice, healthstone and soulstone.
---
I want what Chromie is having.
---
A pleasure for the tips
---
Why did you reupload it to Reddits servers?
---
You are saying SPriest and Ret Pally like they're classes. They aren't. Those are specs, meaning if you decide it isn't working for you you're still able to regear and respec so you didn't waste leveling 1&gt;60.
---
The golden rule: "In classic, you do not play a spec, you play a class". If you want to play a class, be prepared to play its primary role and work on its meme specs as a hobby.
---
Also worth noting, this isn't just "meta". The 4 meme specs all have a related trait. Mana inefficiency. DPS Shaman, DPS Pally, magic DPS druid. All of the hybrid classes in dps forms that use mana. All 3 are pretty good at pvp, but their damage is bursty which is why it's kept inefficienct. So if you want to play these specs you need to pay the price of either wiggling into a raid socially, running in pugs with low standards, or gearing them as  adifferent spec. Their mana inefficiency is tolerable in 5 man content, but raid fights drag on long enough that their sustained damage drops to 1/3-1/2 what traditional specs can do.
---
The 4th "meme" spec is shadow priest. Not bursty, highly mana inefficient. But holy god they are ridiculously good at 1v1 pvp.
---
~~~
---
What classes/specs are having trouble raiding on my server (horde): Pugs have no issues taking enhancement shammies, they're happy to have totems whoever is willing to drop them. Shadow priests aren't viewed favourably but I've seen them. The hardest slot for raiding probably goes to rogue and tanks. While leveling the game demands 1/5 be tanks, but endgame the demand drops to 1/20 all of a sudden. Rogues have the issue that there's just a ton of them (good dps, lots of fun in pvp), and you don't want the class loot to get split over too many people or everyone's unhappy.
---
Heck even boomkin get brought along because druids are so rare and their utility is nice enough.
---
So could this all be done on a rogue but easier?
---
=S that's highly inaccurate why wouldn't you look at something concrete like logs?
---

Not to get the heal I wouldn't think, berserking isn't on global cooldown
---
What kind of xp/hour was this without quests?
---
Man I tanked UBRS almost daily as arms fury back in vanilla. You can absolutely do it without being prot. 
---
But yeah I agree with everything else you said
---
Better in every way - takes a lot of dmg so generate a lot of rage, thanks to that he holds aggro like no1 else on multiple targets and on top of that he top the meters thanks to lots of rage generation.   
---
And for healer it is way more comfortable to heal tank that takes way more damage, than a tank who will not lose hp, but will keep losing aggro on mobs.
---
Ret pally, spriest and moonkins are not meme spec... idk who's been telling you that
---
You don't need to be prot to run 5 mans and UBRS I was even an OT as fury back in the day in BWL +.  Prot is for when wars need to up their threat generated because the raid is geared as fuck and will generate more threat than the tank.
---
Lol, a month. Dude, you are still on the hype train. Everyone is, for the most part. The game is still full of new, interesting things every play session for most people. Everyone's happier and easier to get along with. I'd give it another few months before being so certain you'll still be playing 2 months in the future.
---
As for what classic does right that's missing from retail:
---
Classic has leveling and base dungeon content that can be difficult to survive. This naturally causes players to group up to defeat it, which makes connections. You add people to your friends list for future groups. Those connections turn into friendships over time. Classic got the social aspect right. The game breeds personal stories every play session.
---
Retail actually has some of that, but it's reversed and most players never experience it. Instead of the game naturally leading you to making friends, you will rarely interact with people UNTIL you start seeking out groups for high level content. Meaning raiding guilds, mythic+ teams, arena teams. Once you get past the step of seeking people out for that initial connection, the same process happens. But it requires people to put themselves out there instead of it happening naturally and the game is less spontaneous.
---
Personally, I think flying and cross-realm LFD were the biggest mistakes retail made. Flying obliterated the scale of the world. Instant teleports to dungeons did some of this as well, but they could have implemented that differently to avoid hurting the scale as much while still addressing the long travel times to dungeons. Cross-realm LFD was a huge boon to low/mid pop servers, but it made consequences for your behavior (good or bad) non-existent. Players simply had less reason to be polite and patient with each other when they'll never see one another again.
---
Peace and Tranquility indeed.
---
The problem is Activision/ActiBlizz. Blizzard could have clawed things back to the good old days but I'm pretty sure that will never happen with Activision in the picture.
---
SoC was only worth casting if you are fighting 5+ mobs, which typically, you are not. Theres nothing to "understand" about SoC like some hidden mechanic or like if its true power is unknown. I highly doubt you were top dps in every 5man unless you did massive aoe pulls in every dungeon.
---
I don't think we will ever agree on this. You think players can reserve items. Yet the only players who seem to be reserving items are tanks. Why? Because they are in high demand. I see it as exploitation. You see it as fair play. I also would expect to play a video game and see all the content.
---
Imagine going on a boat tour. You get on the boat. Someone on the boat is screaming they only want to visit 2/10 stops. Everyone else wants to enjoy 10/10 stops. The person screaming is the boat driver. The boat driver insists we are only going on 2 stops. Everyone else just sorta agrees because 2 is better than 0 and well someone has to drive the boat.
---
Some people leave the boat... they say I will find another boat with a better boat driver. They end up in the same situation. Over and over. 
---
Yet the people expecting to visit 10 stops on a god damn tour boat... as expeected... should not assume such things!
---
Where's hans with the flammenwerfer
---
it's also illegal to sell humans but that doesn't stop 'em
---
Ultimately it's your choice and a lot of it depends on how you want to play the game; there are many routes you could take! Your experience will be different if you're interested in player vs. player, raiding, roleplaying, casual, tanking, healing, damage, etc. I'd say read up on the races and the class and put some thought into where you want the game to take you. The first 10ish levels go by pretty quickly so if you're not feeling a certain fighting style/race lore you could always remake or create an alternative character. If you have a more specific question about anything lmk but choosing what appeals to you is a lot more fun than choosing "the best"!
---
That’s funny I was set on horde until the guild I planned to roll with right before release went alliance and I picked dwarf. Feeling confirmed.
---
heyyyyyyy!! lazy al's unite
---
Just say at the start that you haven't done the dungeon since vanilla and that you might need help on directions or fights.
---
Being preemptive about this kind of thing usually leads people to be more helpful
---
When I first posted WoW back in 2015 I leveled up a Paladin and Warlock at the same time. 
---
Both get free mounts at lvl 40 
---
2 completely different playstyles
---
Rested xp helps
---
Who buys those for 6g each? They may be Alliance only, but they’re pretty useless
---
Trying to find something other than arena/angerforge runs frustrates me, i swear its all peeople do
---
Twitch, try to find a god forsaken version of Slick that isn’t taken
---
Rogue is easy, see a group you don't want to fight? Vanish! See a gnome eating, drinking, or just existing? Ambush! It's a lot of fun.
---
This seems like an exaggerated pity post or you're doing something without realizing you're inconveniencing the party.
---
Sometimes runs are advertised for specific bosses or events so don't expect to add other things into that mix without having party approve prior to entering.
---
I got like 7 by now. I wanted to sell them but they're bop. I suggest farming at jangelode mine
---
What about gear with +fishing gear or the arcanite rod, I think you are missing some skill points.
---
It depends on your weapon skill. You want to start with low lvl mobs but at the end it's important to kill high lvl mobs for the last points. I'd go spam some dungeons at 293.
---
Yeah idk man I've played for 13 years and these kinds of things are rare. Consider that if every group you get into is like this and kicks you, maybe you just suck.
---
Prat starts causing weird lag spikes when looting in dungeons so unless they've fixed it in the last 2 weeks I don't recommend it
---
There is a reason that every single person in APES is a gnome or a dwarf and it has nothing to with aesthetics.
---
If you plan on grinding Rank14 you should be gnome for sure - you pretty much can’t carry the flag without it
---
Well it's your job to keep the tank alive not the dps. They can take care of themselves
---
[10/10 song choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XFudmaObLI)
---
I farmed my epic mount pretty easily with a few hours a day for about a week doing ZF zombie runs. I wasn't even speed running and had a few deaths each time
---
Every time I post a strat live run with an orb reserved as a tank I get 2-3 people telling me im a joke and should die, and typically get 2-3 ignores. As a consequence I no longer run strat live. No good tank gear drops there, and the community seems to think tanks should have to run everything even when there is no gain. I wonder if these DPS will ever stop and think why it takes them two hours to find a tank.
---
Orb reserve runs seem to net an avg of maybe 25 gold/hour, which is about half what a competent DPS can achieve doing solo gold farming.
---
That seemed unreasonably salty and hostile given that I just pointed out that this banger of a karma-farmer has already been shared on the sub before.
---
Tank here.
---
If you need something, ask. I can't see your quest log. I'm not going to inspect your gear and plan out every boss I need to hit.
---
Left to my own devices I'm going to try to clear the dungeon in what I believe to be the most ruthlessly efficient manner possible.
---
It takes an INSANE amount of effort to figure out what 4 PUGs need/want from me. Talking to the tank in a non-entitled manner goes a long way.
---
Also, I've been on the Ironfoe hunt for a fucking month. Hundreds of MC attunes. Dozens of healers and DPS kitted out from BRD.
---
My Ironfoe res is happening, and I do deserve it.
---
Perks of the job.
---
Nah pretty sure they are doing it for the aesthetics, also the hunters are NE.
---
Your wrong and don’t make any sense
---
This seems to imply that they have the dragon turned sideways - which will indeed cause the tail to point directly towards the whelp cave.
---
Or bitching at the tank about not holding aggro.
---
I can almost make my own boat tour. Almost. Just so happens I need a boat driver and the boat drivers all have something in common. They strike if they don't get their own way! So sometimes I get lucky. Most boat drivers want limited stops for their own personal gains. I can't blame them but they are certainly not good boat drivers... not for tours anyway. They should go to a job which goes from A-B. The tour boat industry is not made for them.
---
I was also born in the 1960s. Assuming someones age and putting them into a category based on a reddit post finely demonstrates how much of an assumptious idiot you are. Do you disagree? Please don't because you will level up your idiocy skills.
---
That's as long as it took to hate the talent system and unlocking abilities and to realize what made classic great was just not in retail anymore.
---
I'm still figuring out rogue so take my advice with a grain of salt. Your 2 stat split in the assassination tree seems really odd. I also think initiative is a little overrated, especially for 3 points it's a heavy investment.
---
Your combat tree looks alright in order to do a little bit of both pve and pvp, but I'd probably move the points from the improve offhand damage talent into maxing sword specialization.
---
It's a 2 day cooldown per transmute. Become friends with an alchemist or get an alt to 35 for the xmute, or sell the crystal. If you pay for xmute it'll be the same profit as selling the crystal plain.
---
You could equip them both and compare your DPS. It's show in the stats: Put mouse over damage and you will see your DPS.  
---
And you definitely should include stats, when comparing weapons.
---
If your dying to DM trash farm then you definitely won’t be able to do ZF or BRD, which are by far the best farms in the game right now.
---
I’d pick a single target spec and head to Silithus and start farming Elementals.
---
From what I can see at an crystals and bars are so rare and labor intensive you’ll get good gold for them either way. On my server they both go for around the same price on ah. 20-30 each
---
Somehow this is made even better because they need the healer and tank.  Who would seriously waste their time babysitting a group like that?
---
It's 'would have', never 'would of'.
---
Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
---
society is headed in such a great direction lol
---
I have leveled with only holy talents this time around. Just as fast as when I went 1-60 as ret. Theres not much of a difference
---
I played on a private vanilla server where I was the only english speaker in my guild (Mexican and some Brazilian players), and got by with my rudimentary spanish and google translate.
---
I stuck around because they were the least toxic guild on the server, even if they only wanted me in voice chat because my accent was funny to them. Silver lining, I placed out of entry level spanish at school the next year.
---
Imagine hoping for a kid and getting you
---
Mage if you're melee. Warrior Charge at you? frost nova Blink, Intercept? Repeat.
---
Legend has it they are still looking
---
I haven't dealt with shadow priests yet. Most of them kind of walk around me and leave me be. But if they are that strong it's probably a "you don't want this" type of message
---
Actually back in the day guilds used to coordinate events like live auctions and craft fairs. bassically a guild would advertise and set a location and offer crafting services have mages hand out food and water and have a buff booth. maybe set up a spot for dueling
---
Almost nobody get 100 gold at level 40, without special preparations.  
---
That's because at 34+ cost of skills skyrocket and get past 1g.
---
Majority of people get mount at 43-44. And it's nothing bad.  
---
Higher level means that you will farm gold quickly. At 50 you could easily get 5g per hour just from pick-up silver.
---
Wow 3 replies all at the same time from different accounts on a comment/post that's 4 months old, is this you and your alts? So lets start off from the beginning... 
---
1. the game was at its best when it had an elitist attitude to content\development and that's a fact. As soon as Blizz started catering to every single demographic the overall quality of the game began to dwindle. 
---
2. TBC actually had the hardest heroic dungeons although Cata wasn't far off at it's release. The problem was that after 1 month of release they nerfed the fucking shit out of them because every shitter and their mum started crying that they couldn't queue up for them and easily waltz through it all like in WOTLK. Again this was Blizz catering to casuals/bad players who don't have much time to put in or improve at the game and just want to be walked through everything for instant rewards.
---
3. It's an MMORPG, the whole RPG aspect is lost by having multiple difficulties of a raid. The awe is killed, the wonder is ruined and the desire to progress is lessened. It was so much more exciting when you've cleared the first tier of a raid and then you get to unlock the next raid which is more difficult, more exclusive,  and is a place that not many people have even stepped foot in on your server. Nothing kills my PvE boner harder than clearing a raid and then being like "woohoo now we get to repeat it again with more dmg and 2 extra mechanics". 
---
Want some proof of this? Just look at the sorry state that retails currently in, but no the big bad elitists are clearly wrong.
---
mesmerizing
---
If you can find friends to chat with you may enjoy it more, but YES you will be farming dungeons throughout the raid tiers and may need to find a way to make it fun
---
never played classic as well. got into a guild at 60 and people seem pretty nice
---
the only thing most guildies I know would be kinda mad about is if I rolled on something that was bis for another class that was only a minor upgrade for me. 
---
so I ask before I roll in guild groups because I don't want to memorize everyone's prebis/bis lists
---
Yeah I’m wondering this too
---
Or turns and tail swipes them into the whelp cave
---
I have to wonder if they were being serious, or making fun out of how stupid lfm but reserved has gotten.
---
Que server es?
---
Augenweide. The word you want is Augenweide.
---
God I hope it’s satire.
---
Oh, so you're just an old fuck who never learned. Got it, even worse because you have less of an excuse. By the way, YOU can be the boat driver or did you not understand that part either? I'm saying you can make a tank if you've got such a problem with all the ones around you moron.
---
That’s an alcoholic quilting cold turkey
---
I sold Pendulum of Doom for 25g.
---
excuse my stupidity but what does it stand for?
---
Why do i feel the urge to watch this over and over
---
wow haha originality nice boomer insult
---
Uh... Yeah. People in the appropriate level range still run Lib, just like every other dungeon in the game, even Gnomer.
---
I think I saw this guy in Hillsbrad yesterday getting ganked near me by some allies. He must have had enough. RIP Arbon.
---
Mages aren't awful for me but I have freedom, cleanse, etc. If I can stick on you it will hurt but I have nothing for gap closing unless you count stuns or repentance.
---
You should have your dps run to where your tanks tank her if they have aggro, much less chaos
---
Completionists
---
ZF if new
---
DME with herb + satyrs if experienced
---
People do, they’re just being jerks about being higher level
---
Dude Maitoz literally has a video where he talks about all the benefits they have by all being gnomes and dwarves. 
---
Don’t just make shit up, wtf
---
Depends on your server and time of day.  SM in general is heavily run in my experience, but not until the evening.  Unless your server has a disproportionate number of high level players and no one is making alts, there are definitely people still running Lib.
---
Uhh okay. You can sit here and post logs all day, but there wasn't a single time during my testing that my pet actually casted Claw within 2 seconds of another Claw. Not even close.
---
\*Of course, after the initial focus dump at the beginning of the fight.
---
sorry, reread this and want to say I'm not trying to brag, I'm trying to tell you find a guild, and if you don't like how they treat you find another.
---
they are plentiful, you'll find a place you fit in.
---
Never had a problem finding people for my groups spamming the usual channels. The LFG addon API access got blocked so i don't know what you're seeing. 
---
Acting pro is telling people about chat filters? shit i should show a screenshot of my Raid geared rogue, that would be "Pro"
---
Just fix your chat settings and stop complaining about it, fucking baby.
---
Yes I understand how percentages work. I killed at least 30, and I got two. Do YOU understand how percentages work? The probability of that happening is extremely low.
---
And that figure on Wowhead is clearly WRONG. Go read through the Wowhead comments, everybody is echoing my sentiment. The drop rate is nowhere near 47%.
---
Why do people like you find it necessary to post? "Do you understand how percentages work"? Do you know how condescending that is? Who the fuck doesn't know how percentages work?
---
Hell
---
It's not a New thing. The info was avalible from the start. They Just made it more obvious.
---
I remember when I first missed with this, I re-read the tool tip like 8 times, still didn't register.
---
You ask the impossible!
---
Yeah I reckon the lowered downtime from holy talents puts it at least on par with faster kills from ret talents, so might as well go holy so you can heal dungeons better.
---
At first I thought this was stock dances, but as it goes on I realized they rigged a lot of these themselves. With some serious attention to detail. Fantastic job by the creator.
---
I would like to lower the number of my key binds, I could map Raptor Strike with Serpent Sting on a key and this works pretty well, but I guess that is the exception because Raptor Strike is not instant but on next attack.
---
 I would like to do the same with other abilities, e.g. Concussive Shot &amp; Wing Clip. 
---
Does anybody have an idea on how to create such a macro ?
---
“I cannot do that yet”
---
“Not enough rage”.
---
Unneeded instructions aren't worth following. I've prevented wipes by not following instructions.
---
Unfortunately it was not. I didn't see him post anymore after he got roasted shortly after posting.
---
This post is a life saver. It helped me understand the wow macro language a bit more. There’s at least 3 of these I’ll definitely be using.
---
Check out the guidelime addon, there are different guides you can download and use with it.
---
How does Paladin cleanse help with Mages?
---
Thought it was just poison/disease.

He's referring to his money, idiot.
---
You don't need pre-BiS though, and it's not that hard to get outfitted in a full set of pretty good dungeon blues. Even so, you can't honestly tell me that a dungeon like say, Scholomance is anywhere close to competing with something like Waycrest Manor in terms of difficulty. I've been in UBRS groups where we accidentally pull and kill bosses without even realizing it. As I said in my post, the only real challenging content in Classic is finding a group.
---
I never asked if you were mad. I know you're not mad. I'm mad but not in the angry sense. I'm insane. Look here I'm going to make a tank and follow in your footsteps. I will make the rules.
---
Thank you for showing me the greater picture. Also lets remember anything you post on the internet does not matter. Facts do not care about feelings.

Here's a quick video of me kiting a Wickerman Guardian to get the buff called: " Invocation of the Wickerman "     
---
The buff does: Increases health and mana regeneration by 25%, and Stamina by 25%.  Lasts 2 hrs.    
---
That was my first try (I did many mistakes) and it took me around 9 minutes. I have mind flay but it's not necessary, anyone with a decent DoT should be able to solo it.
---
I did it and it really wasn't hard at all. It was maybe 30min from the Zoram FP. I died twice in aubergine. Then once outside the portal in Teldressil, then I rezzed at the yard and an owl was fifteen feet from me.
---
How do they decide the venue and how are they able to prevent griefers in the tourney so far?
---
Around 9 minutes, I decided to try to solo it because no one was doing it at that time. There's no advantage to solo it I guess, if you have a grp you should def. go with it and take the buff in few minutes.
---
I think there’s an addon called “move anything” or something like that. Or just use something like Bartender.
---
This is the grooviest.
---
never try to quest in STV other than during degen hours
---
i try and fight them when possible because i need practice, but they definitely fuck me up way more often than any other class/spec, as a rogue.
---
You could lie...and maybe you get away with it, and maybe you don't.  Depends really, on a few factors.
---
If someone cared enough to pay attention, they could figure it out.  MoTW for example, if your full resto, it's expected that you've got 5 points into that.  Any druid who doesn't, is NOT Resto spec'd.  This would be something very very easy to check.
---
After MoTW.  Then it becomes a bit more challenging, but not impossible.  The next easy method, is to track your crits on regrowth.  A true Resto spec'd druid has spec'd into Improved Regrowth.  This is a fantastic talent!  Cheaper to cast than max rank HT, and heals for a slightly downranked HT, (assuming a crit). 
---
The next method, and a bit more difficult, but not overly hard to figure out, is going by your rejuv.  They can inspect you, get your gear, add-up your +healing, then start tracking the healing of your rejuv spell.  If they fall short of what your rejuv should be doing, (A Resto druid will be spec'd into at least one, if not both of the following talents: Gift of Nature, and Improved Rejuvination.  I'm spec'd into both), then they'll know your not Resto Spec'd.
---
So yes, you could lie, and likely get away with it because most people would be to lazy to at least check your MoTW, much less anything else.  But don't be surprised if someone notices....
---
How do I sound mad? Do you have text to speech enabled when viewing my posts? I like your style.
---
I didn't even hit 100g until almost 50 lol.
---
Retail went from an MMORPG and turned into a single player rpg. I like to say that retail turned into Diablo 3... Hack and slash souless zerg through content. I mean a lot of diablo 3 devs switched to WoW so makes sense.
---
This has brilliant
---
For sure, it’s still Phase 1 after all. Casuals still are leveling, and those who have hit 60 are leveling alts. I see folks looking for dungeon groups at all levels all the time.
---
Anyone think ST is one of the worst dungeons in the game? 
---
I see very few LFG/LFM messages about it, so organizing a full group takes forever. Running it even with a group that's only partially pug is still a never-ending nightmare. There were puzzles everywhere and we argued with each other non-stop about how to do the puzzles. The six mini-bosses required to summon Jammal'an have irregular pathways leading to them, and our tank insisted we got all six despite the doors to Jammal'an being locked. We ended up clearing through the entire circular hallway again before finally finding the last one. 
---
The pathways throughout the entire thing is just confusing and team members frequently got lost or went to the wrong chamber. Not to mention since final boss is level 55, you are pretty much ready to start doing BRD by the time you can comfortably run through ST. Yet the loot from ST is absolutely crap compared to end-game dungeons. Sure, there's stuff like Drakestone and Atal'ai Gloves, but their drop rate is crazy low and have *random* stats. The only reason I wanted to do ST was for Drakestone of Frozen Wrath, but after realizing I'm trying to get an &lt;10% drop rate item with a 3% chance of being the correct type, I just gave up and decided to keep questing until I'm closer to 60.
---
make sure she has the auctioneer addon to make sure she's not disenchanting a bind on equip piece that's worth gold on the auction house
---
Why have i watched the whole thing several times?
---
Using macro API it fetches vendor price of times, if an item can be sold in AH, you can tell FarmLog its value by typing \`/fl set \[Black Lotus\] 50.5\` to set item value to 50.5g. Shift-click the item to place link in the chat box.
---
Purge what? Since you can't purge their shield.
---
So here is the decision. If it is a BOE then the person that needs it can easily buy it off the AH, right? So all you are doing is saving them the price of the piece of gear. That's the same net gain/loss that you are taking away from someone that doesnt need it and will put it on the AH. IMO all BoE gear should be needed.
---
*Screams internally*
---
Yeah there's not a need/pass system, it's a need/greed/pass system.
---
your optimal gear and talents change with things like killspeed, we don't know whether or not this person is in a top guild killing bosses in 30 seconds, the population doing that is comparatively small. It's better to assume that they are more average players.
---
The thing about classic is it's never too late to join. You can level at your own pace and play as you want. You'll get to 60 eventually and can start raiding.
---
Ashbringer is a very good server. Lots of people and the faction is nearly 50/50. It's a very healthy playerbase.
---
Again, play the game however you want. You are getting downvotes because you are being a hostile idiot about it, not because people don't think you should play how you want.
---
Why does this matter to you?
---
Like at all?
---
The GetCoinTextureString error will be fixed in version 1.6.
---
Cheers, I'll have to have a bash at that spec, gears gotten a little better since I started tanking so I'll have a look into it. 
---
Looks pretty solid for out in the world grinding / mopping up quests too.
---
I've leveled many alts and will always do gathering professions while leveling to pay for everything. Pick your actual professions when you get to 60 and find guides to level them most efficiently.
---
Dodge does open you up to more overpowers by warriors.
---
Grats on the drop ;-)
---
Probably not, we're all 60 and are going to laugh at you as you level.
---
This is the quality shitposting that I signed up for. Just needs more Ricardo Milos tbh.
---
Well, here's the logic behind it - I read up online that Imp Evisc doesn't do much, so I went for Crit. Now the S&amp;D is a must have, just not sure whether 1 point is enough. Lastly, a single point in Ruthlessnes is an infinite increase because if you don't take it - you have 0% chance, so just looks too good to pass up. With that said, I'm not that great at this game either, so yeah.. not sure how good this overall is.
---
How much time did it take? :O
---
Do these people actually expect to get replies asking to join?

How about a rematch every 10 levels, add me next time you’re on

Imo any boe blue or purple should be need. The whole group. Need. BoP is different story.
---
If they are higher level than you they got a higher chance to resist. At 5 levels over they will allways resist.
---
Did you accidentally poke a hole in the middle and are now calling it an eye of Sauron
---
Negative if it’s a real upgrade the person who needs it has the right to roll for it, how is it any different than getting an upgrade from a boss you greedy twat?
---
It's basically free if you make a few mistakes or its 100 gold a week if you are raiding with a different spec is how I read that. Sucks for some folks for sure.
---
DM east jump runs. Just need a healer friend and a dps friend. 3 man it. Especially if you keep mining. 2-3 guaranteed rich thorium veins at end.
---
Yes for sword rogues it’s very valuable to go over the yellow hit cap since most of your damage is white hits. More white hits equals more poison procs, more sword procs. 
---
For dagger rogues crit is more valuable past the yellow hit cap.
---
Only time you're using cleave is as a rage dump for single target, or for some cleaving. You're almost always hanstring spamming instead.
---
I've enjoyed it quite a bit for farming e'kos and grinding out mobs. I like that it's basically a dual spec in one spec. You can switch to dps on the fly and do pretty solid damage if needed.
---
Back to chorin'
---
What do the fox people say? :)
---
If you’re horde, you can do the shellfish farming in desolace. There’s a repeatable 55s quest. Just get underwater breathing pots and a second monitor to watch tv. I think i was making ~9-10g an hour doing that.
---
As a druid I love the versatility and no pvp fight seems the same.
---
Max level doesnt work this way. In modern wow low level tanks normally out dps the dps until you get to 100+
---
At 120, tanks have to actively work to keep threat above the dps especially with aoe groups.
---
Setting up loot rules and following them is literally the opposite on ninjaing.
---
Nice post, thanks!
---
Nah, can't change stupid.
---
I see this behavior a lot actually. You say one thing, someone strawmans you a bit, gets some upvotes, and then suddenly everyone is against you because now everyone assumes you meant what the strawmanner said you meant. Even if what you said could only be interpreted one way by rational individuals, someone will always find a way to read into it.
---
You don't have to respec prot until 60, but you do need to start playing more like a true tank with a shield and all that through your 40s and 50s, the 2H tanking that blitzed through SM starts to become more and more of a liability as content gets tougher
---
Man can people stop with these lame ass post?

BRD is undoubtedly the best dungeon in WoW and possibly the best dungeon in all of gaming history. The sense of scale is epic and you truly feel like you're adventuring through a foreign city. Every dungeon should be as big and nuanced as BRD frankly. Or at least one BRD-esque dungeon per expansion.
---
BC kinda sucked by reusing dungones. Just when you thought you were tired of ramps you had to run it on heroic all of a sudden. And the shortness of the dungeon took a lot away from the satisfaction of finishing them. They just became loot vendors in a lot of ways and their linear nature killed any sense of adventure or exploration. Compare for instance shattered halls vs mauradon. I'd take one mauradon over 10 shattered halls any day of the week.
---
People get incredible nostalgic for BC for a lot of good reasons but the aforementioned dungeon problems in conjunction with flying and too many rep grinds make it kinda shitty in a lot of ways. They did a great job expanding the talent trees though and increasing hybrid viability without crushing pure dps specs.
---
Why do I like this so much to watch this more than 5 times?
---
Hey look more people who never played a hunter in classic. This is exactly how it worked back then. If you feigned while something was hitting you, the hit can still go through and knock you out of the FD before everything deaggros. This is why you always turn on Monkey before FDing to help avoid that.
---
Click to move
---
You don't drop combat instantly, atleast it never do for me. I allways have to wait 1-2 seconds before the mobs stop off. Also you have to remember spellbatching is a thing with classic as the game was designd for slow internet speed with big delays.
---
Probability is extremely low, but not impossible
---
Claiming that its your (shitty) opinion that all BOE's should be needed isnt setting up loot rules.
---
Its justifying being a dick.
---
These fucking mobile phone screenshots are a bigger travesty than what happened here
---
My life is better today because of this video
---
The loot there isn't amazing, but I really dig the atmosphere in Sunken Temple. Having a guide/map over the place is a must tho.
---
Frost AoE
---
i didnt bought every skill but as i said i leveld enchanting and tailoring. Which means that i didnt sell any colored items and had to buy some materials.
---
Also, I don't have any gathering profession and I didn't grind mobs like some people do
---
This happens to me too
---
It really is. Dps is so relaxing and easy. Ive only ever dpsed once in a dungeon and loved it. As a tank most of the weight of the smoothness of the dungeon falls on your shoulders.
---
It's a hold over from original beta when you had to put skill points into specs and abilities. Madseason has a video series about vanilla patches including the pre 1.0 beta patches. Pretty interesting stuff. For a while you could make a toon with just crafting skills and no combat skills.
---
Watched a video of someone using levitate to walk up the side of the mountain

---
Id rather not pay 1g every time I want to go to a city. Its fine if it works for you but id really start to dread when I want to hearth because its going to cost me 1g.
---
How much of the Classic community came from retail? How do you think Classic would be different if nobody had years and years of knowledge coming from retail and rushing through content?
---
Not because of levitate, had this happen to my gnome when just on the ground normally.
---
I play the game to enjoy the game. Gear is the cherry on top. Chasing this shit seems like such a waste of an immersive world.
---
Made a burner account just to talk shit on classicwow subreddit?  Cute
---
Can't you just pass the lead to your alt before logging off?
---
Oh what a dick then
---
Sorry wasn’t familiar on how to take in game screen shots but anyway just pinged 53 and joined a random group for my first ever BRD run. Before the dungeon starts we are lectured on not needing ANYTHING we don’t truly need if it doesn’t have an immediate upgrade by our lovely tank. Fast forward to a mob that drops an epic and everyone caster included who could’ve ALSO benefited from the drop immediately congratulate me on the dagger drop as they all greed. The tank then switches the flip and says I’m needing anyway and rolls 1 point higher reassuring that these are the exception and that’s just how the game works. Confronted him about it saying that everyone followed his lead not hesitating to greed and told him should practice what he preached with a prompt yet firm “kys” lodged in there for setting a false precedent. He promptly left the group before pulling a mob and reported me for the threat. Currently waiting on a new tank as we speak lol
---
So happy we aren't on the same server.
---
World of Warcraft is like 3 seperate game modes in one. 
---
1) The Leveling Experience
---
2) The End game Dungeons and Pvp grind
---
3) Raiding (Because honestly, there's a large portion of people that never seriously get into anything past MC)
---
Some people play Wow just for part one, they are called altaholics. The second they get to 60 they are planning new characters and enjoy experiencing it over and over from different zones and different class perspectives. 
---
Some people LOVE the end game grind farming for different loot and being a perfectionist with different professions and trying to get the perfect styles and just well, all the stuff. 
---
And then there's the raiding group, from the "casual" raiders who just do it sometimes to the hard-core raiders who min-max everything and downed rag during week 1. 
---
Many people are an awkward blend of all three types of players, and that's totally cool too, because this is a game and it's about doing what you enjoy and having fun, as long as you don't force anyone else to do what you find fun. The second you try to make other people do what you want, you are ruining the game for them. Find like minded people, progress with them, and enjoy the World of Warcraft.
---
Yeah tanks rarely mark even when asked. Every tank or at least someone in the group should mark targets in dungeons, it makes it way smoother.
---
Whats 4 targets when you pull 15-20? Sure it’s cute but thats about it. Never seen a dpswarrior shine (since vanilla) in a good group (regarding dungeons).
---
yeah i missed where it said arcane. but even still mages spam arcane explosion all the time aoe grinding. its not a lot but id value it higher than spirit.
---
Any thoughts on how to value this drop? Swashbuckler's Eyepatch of Healing (+55)
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10187/swashbucklers-eyepatch](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10187/swashbucklers-eyepatch)
---
In general, I'm not sure how to value +Healing compared to the general stats at this stage... for an example, the Eye of Theradras drops in Mara with +20 Int, +13 Sta, +11 Spi... would anyone pick the +55 healing over that kind of item?
---
You’ll find a solid group/guild don’t let it get you down. You have your elitists like that in any game.
---
That place is nearly as much of a maze as BRD, but MUCH less frequented so fewer people are actually familiar with it.  I wouldn't say that it's one of the worst dungeons in the game though, it is great in its own mysterious way.  It has the capability of being hellish for sure, just like BRD and some of the other higher-range dungeons, but it is a unique and iconic place.  IIRC it's the first place you run into the big dragon model, and that was always an amazing sight to see.
---
Because you know what server I'm on.
---
The class quests for sunken temple aren't out until p2. You'll see it run more then.
---
The second M in MMO is very important to this whole thing working out.
---
Sick off these cringey boomer posts.
---
Not familiar on the keybind and didn’t want to lose the evidence homie, my b
---
That sounds reasonable! Thank you for answering my question
---
See this is great! My luck has unfortunately been different, for example I was told I was talking too much during a dung run earlier for typing 5 one line messages in a half hour as Tank
---
People who play gnomes are weirdos.
---
Change my mind.
---
Ok easy on the name calling. If I am a mage and the pattern for the warlock tailoring chest drops, I can sell that on the AH and use that money to buy the mage pattern. BOEs are equivalent to an upgrade for everyone.
---
my raid this weekend had a ret pally and a shadow priest in it. didn't wipe once throughout ony and mc. raids are really not so hard that you need to min/max and not bring less-than-optimal specs. that may change with AQ40/naxx, though.
---
How about you try to use logic instead of childish emotion.
---
“You are assuming everyone has these addons...”
---
No, no I’m not... I however am not afraid to communicate when on my runs, and will inform those not in the know when I come across them. If they choose not to use them to monitor threat and whatnot after being informed of their existence then they are their own problem at that point. 
---
Pretty ironic that you were assuming what you thought I was assuming though, lmao.
---
Except I’m the dog frantically jumping around waiting for the escort to hurry the hell up
---
Rush to 60
---
BRD also has complicated layout but the loot are much better for pre-raid. That makes it somewhat worth it to put up with BRD. ST is just an hour+ long experience of agony.
---
Yep. I started healing BRD at 48 and shadow spec. Was actually the most fun I had because I was actually having to do more than just straight up heal and renew.
---
Hes bit the one with small tits mate.
---
Yeah, "OP" not only didn't credit the actual OP, but they stole the video and reuploaded it, so people couldn't find the creator even if they tried.
---
And "OP" got 3 awards for this post.  And people not knowing the actual creator is the real crime, because they're the makers of other masterpieces [like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FghTLPayfkg)
---
Tier 3 warrior is best and it's not even close
---
Round 500-600 iirc on AH but heard of them selling for less than that in trade chat on a couple occasions
---
Now go ahead and explain how it is ninjaing if everyone is instructed to need.
---
if everyone needs ninjaing is impossible so you're only creating an environment where ninjas can exist by rolling anything but need.  additionally it's asinine to think someone is entitled to a very expensive item that anyone can sell for gold and buy themselves class appropriate items.  
---
Anyone who thinks needing is ninjaing is terrified of change and has no logical arguments for it.
---
Maybe it goes without saying but get your mining leveled up, keep both gathering professions up to level, and mine and skin everything. All of my toons have both gathering professions while I level to fund the trainings, equipment, mounts, etc.
---
I literally just did.
---
Yeah I know I should. I don't have allot of time to play tho. And I use the potions only while raiding, in dungeons if I go OOM my wand will do. My epic mount just needs to wait a bit longer :p
---
&gt;How much of the Classic community came from retail?
---
Not much I reckon.
---
&gt;  How do you think Classic would be different if nobody had years and years of knowledge coming from retail and rushing through content?
---
That was WoW in 2004-2006.
---
so I'm about to hit 20 on my mage. I'm looking to speed up leveling a bit but when can mage really start to AoE farm? And is there a video or site that can show me what areas are good for appropriate level progression?
---
In the early levels you don't have vanish and leveling is a bit harder than other classes.
---
Congrats man! I feel you, before I started playing Classic, I had barely any experience playing games with strangers over the internet. My first time running Deadmines, I was too nervous to even talk to my group. Lots of levels and lots of quest groups later, I find myself often being the one who starts the contact in the first place! The game's community is great and the relaxed environment makes it very easy for me to talk to people online the way I do in real life.
---
I feel like you aren't reading the OP or the conversation in this chain. No one is saying he should have to sell it for 20g less, what people are saying is it's ridiculous is how he put the guy on ignore for offering that, especially since prices on things like that fluctuate constantly, that 100g offer wasn't ridiculous or bad. Something may be "going for 120g", but if it sells slow as fuck and there are a good number on the AH, you either keep waiting forever until it sells, assuming it doesn't drop lower from other people undercutting, or you contemplate lower offers that will probably end up being in your best interest anyway.
---
If the price drops to 100g on the AH before he can sell it, that 100g offer OP made suddenly becomes 90g or 80g instead. He then loses out on even more money or at the very least an easy instant sell. Again, he can sell it for whatever he wants, but the problem was him being a dick because the guy offered less.
---
Higher level target higher chance to resist FD.
---
Yup. They're too valuable to justify giving someone an incremental upgrade for a couple levels. My epic mount is more important than your improved dps for 10 levels. Even something like stockade pauldrons there's plenty of equivalent or better items. They should absolutely be sold for gold.
---
Games amazing better to start now rather than phase 2/3 when contested zones are hectic.

This is actually awesome
---
got anything to help me for figuring out what gear rogues need/want
---
Elixir of the mongoose recipe is a very common drop (I've gotten 2 or 3 just from doing quests in the area where it drops) and they sell like hotcakes.  You can sometimes just scoop the mats off the AH and turn a decent profit by combining the potion and posting them up.  There are a few potions like this that are cheap to by the recipe and easy to farm the materials.
---
Purge seal of command, they just auto attack.
---
Will trade upvotes for screenshots.
---
Yeah. Basically.
---
Still better to farm gold. Farming SM for 5 hours will net you 100-150G. Farming the Pearls themselves is 100% RNG and could take days.
---
I only play this game casually with my friends so I don’t really care if I’m terrible or not you weeb.
---
You're mistakenly assuming that he's doing something other than just voicing his opinion, and what he would do in a situation where a BOE drops.
---
I have the map open on a 2nd monitor and still take wrong turns all the time, especially when trying to find the minibosses before Jammal'an.
---
Combine that with pug groups where everyone has their own idea and people who claim they've run ST 7+ times yet refuses to follow my direction after they run into the same dead-end 3 times. I just felt like it's not a dungeon worth going back to after finishing the quests there.
---
So many good guilds for enjoying it true.
---
Why take the extra time out of your life to let people know that you don’t like something?  Ignore what you don’t like and move on
---
Onyxia murdered me.
---
That is more or less the tabard used in Undying Legion [H]. Its a very small guild with very few 60:s, but it's a friendly bunch.
---
I'm approaching 60 and kind of stuck in the same stage as you. Big shots in my guild are mostly done with end-game dungeons and have partially cleared MC, yet guildies whom I've run dungeons together are still approaching lvl50 and friends I've made during leveling are also only around lvl50. At this point I have no choice but to find pug groups solo. After spending 8 hours in 3 different dungeons (with about 2hrs spent trying to find a tank), I just felt completely drained. 2/3 of the tanks I found were 2H Fury tanking so the healer was somewhat distressed throughout the whole run, yet these two tanks were cocky, refused to listen to our directions for navigating the dungeon, and were rushing mana users by pulling packs non-stop. Healer during my 3rd run quit after being verbally mocked &amp; abused by the tank, so I decided to call it a night and logged off.
---
I'm trying to at least get MC attuned to join my guild's scheduled raid on Tuesday, but at this point I feel like won't make it. Might be easier just spending my time farming gold and waiting for friends to catch up with leveling.
---
I'm making a pally solely for dungeon runs as well, how do you handle LoSing pulls? The main appeal I saw in holy shock wasnt as a taunt but as a way to actually pull packs since we don't get the avengers shield in classic .
---
This is hilarious.
---
I've made it to level 55 (Warrior) with doing no dungeons, but am running low on quests.
---
What are some monsters i can camp for xp, with the potential of decent drops?
---
Drakestone of frozen wrath is bis for mages right now, shadow wrath probably is for warlock too. But compared to a +20 green or a spirit of aquamentis not worth the effort yeah.
---
Classic Onyxia is weird as hell. It took my guild 5 lockouts before we saw her do the first deep breath. On private servers she did it 2-3 times every single fight.
---
I'm mostly thinking about this with aoe farming. An extra attack from 5 or 15 mobs can mean an easy death.
---
This video is amazing if I had any awards it would get them all
---
I care :D I enjoyed the post. And I think you must've cared too, since you took the time to comment
---
I max leveled a priest after my lock and it was fun, but I did lock first, and found the spriest lacking. You're coming from the priest side first, so I don't know... What I loved about the lock was affliction: dotting, fearing, owning, and running off whilst cackling maniacally. It's effective in dungeons, raids, pvp, and with Life Tap and Dark Pact, there's almost never down time.
---
The last point I'll make is priests are a dual use class, healers or dps, and those classes usually don't excell in dps, compared to purely dps classes. Look at druids and pallys. Boomkins, cats, and ret pallys aren't out dps'ing locks, mages, rogues, etc. Locks can do some serious damage where spriests might be underpowered.
---
i love when rogues pop up evasion (im arms war). that usualy end fight in couple seconds :-)
---
But people don't go back to zf after outleveling it.
---
There is no point.
---
At every point of wow life after people started getting to 60 the only relevant content had been the maximum level.
---
At 60 you ran brd-brs-strato-scholo-dm, at 70 you ran lvl 70 heroics, then lvl 80 heroics and so on.
---
Some content in the game has always been obsolete after the leveling process.
---
YEAH, Doobies..!
---
Different weapons but everything else will be the same.
---
I didn't mind the nerf.  By the time it came around, I already ran the dungs enough and it was nice not having to spend so much time in them.  Made it feel like less of a nerf.  Plus only like 20% of groups were getting past Ozruk, because he had a *very* narrow margin of error for an insta death mechanic.   It got to the point that most tanks wouldn't even run it.
---
The flaw in that , Is someone who actually needs it and will equip it will get screwed. The all need method is alright if no one needs the item, but if someone does, it’s simply just a group ninja. Needing on BoE to sell is only ok if no one will use it.  All needing just because you can sell it for gold to buy an item, defeats the purpose of dungeons, and getting the loot that drops in them. If you are in the open world it’s a little different. Just by saying everyone is entitled to a BoE for gold vs equip is bad logic. If you want gold go farm, everyone has equal rights to this. Dungeons are for loot, and gearing up. Farming is for gold. If you lucky no one needs the BoE and you get a chance to make some extra money.
---
Don’t come into dungeons if you are looking to need loot for gold. Go farm if you have that mentality. Otherwise have some lot etiquete.
---
At the time quel danas was out there was no attunement process anymore
---
Did you dot them up? They can’t stealth when dotted up. If you can dot them and fear them after the opener you should win most battles.  
---
This is exactly why a rogues toughest matchup tends to be a warlock. Dots and fears. The only chance to get out of that is a complete reset (which is hard when SWP lasts so long) or to use sprint to close the distance and try to get a quick kill.  
---
Have you maybe fought a couple of shadow priests and had an easy time? Once you start rocking more consistent pvp and discovering matchups, you’ll find that you will be able to beat most rogues that don’t get a jump or poorly execute their opener.
---
Written "je sais sais quoi" but yes
---
Yeah, that was what made me curious, why a priest would have to solo it.
---
i semi agree but there are some items that are long term.
---
like freezing band or the elemental mage staff. these both are used at lvl 60 by mages, there pre-bis, and unless someone gets lucky...theyre going to keep it for a long long time. (and other classes do have similar boe items)
---
theyre also worth ALOT of gold. the freezing band on my server is between 700-900g. its a fucking epic mount
---
but at the same time, GREED does not not outweigh need.
---
i can understand it, we all need gold. but you dont NEED an epic mount. there a nice to have type of item
---
gear&gt;mounts
---
TBC pre patch is 2.0.
---
Just gonna go ahead and escape artist sprint that.
---
Never played retail, enjoying classic too much to give it the time.
---
Is that a guild in zandalar tribe eu ? How i contact them?
---
Mistakenly? So you know what he would do? Alright, buddy.
---
&gt; except you're not bringing your Warlocks for damage *either*.
---
Would you explain this for me? I'm a warlock and planned on going ds/ruin
---
Curse French phonetics rules lol thanks. I think there must be an “n” in there though, right?
---
As a rogue, it’s the warlock hands down. If you’re dotted and feared it’s pretty much over. The only reset is to get out of combat range and try to stealth and heal.
---
Classic isn’t for you.  People in classic don’t complain like this
---
Nightfall and imp exhaust is essential imo
---
Heck, you can even consider it as such; it's not Stockade Pauldrons that dropped, it's X amount of gold. Those Stockade Pauldrons might not be BiS for that Frost Mage, but the Staff of Jordan or Freezing Ring he could buy with the money from selling the Stockade Pauldrons most certainly are BiS for him.
---
I'm literally wearing 1 piece of plate. Definition of a glass cannon.
---
No unfortunately that doesn't work. Can't pass lead to an offline player.
---
A wonderful piece of art and litterature
---
Beasts in winterspring or stuff like nagas in azshara will be good. You can also mindlessly kill undead in western plaguelands for argent dawn rep, but you'll get a lot of diseases doing that
---
Those stupid ass repeatable daily quests were so soul sucking too imo.  Fuck randomly jousting target dummies.  I can't believe they did that argent tourney and then kept a bunch of that for future content.  That shit was horrible but mistakes happen.... But why did it become the norm?  Tokens, garbage dailies, spoonfed content.  That's what made me quit in cata.
---
You didn't get shafted, you were just about to win the equivalent of 400g over everyone else
---
Play a real class. Avoid druids, Paladins, and shaman. Those are way too niche and would require way too much know how to level and play effectively at 60 unless you are healing. 
---
If you want to ignore that advice, then play whatever you enjoy playing. If you think ret paladins are cool because a streamer guild leader makes it look fun, then by all means. But average joe ret paladins have a miserable time because no one wants to bring you. You just are a waste of a slot unless they actually cannot fill that 40th slot. 
---
Try out a few classes, or all of them, up to like level 10 and see which one feels the best. Just know at 60, for the most part paladins, druids, shaman, and priests are healing for PvE. Warriors are the only good tanks. Rogues, Warriors, Mages are the best DPS. Warlocks and Hunters are easiest to level or solo with. In my opinion druids are a dumpster fire of a class in Vanilla and I would never suggest playing on unless you had really specific goals in mind.
---
I’ve seen this same person starting nonsense on several posts, just ignore them.
---
I mean boe purps I always roll need on 
---
Also elemental mage staff isn’t bis
---
If it's a guild run, sure. I passed up Foror's to a tank of ours.
---
If it's a pug run? Hell no. My gold need is just as valid as your equip need. If an item is worth 300g, that's either you saving 300g on buying it, or someone else in the group making 300g. "I need an ITEM to equip the ITEM, you need an ITEM to sell for gold", yet you need the ITEM to... save gold. Sorry, but i'll reiterate; my gold need is just as valid as your gold need.
---
He can trade that 300-400G he got from needing the Elemental MAGE Staff and selling it for something such as Stockade Pauldrons, which are _his_ BiS. Think about it that way, and "All Need" makes a lot more sense. You can simply consider it that the drop was in-fact "Any classes' BiS BoE worth as much or less as this BoE that just dropped"
---
But then there's things like Warden Staff which are BiS for all of Classic.
---
That sounds even more retarded. Minmaxing content equal to LFR in difficulty is literally flushing gold down the toilet, for no good reason.
---
Alright undead rogue it is. Any add ons i should get? also i'll be playing solo pretty much since all my friends are still on PS4 LUL
---
I can totally relate to this! I’m a super closed off person and I HATE any form communicating with someone I don’t know and between the chat channels, the quick group for a quest, or a long term group for dungeon run, I’ve felt I really came out of my shell!
---
why don't you use a macro to switch stance and cast overpower,much easier, weak auras to show you can use overpower already are, stance dance macros are your bread and butter, it should be
---
I have never been in a pug where no one talks. I always start talking right away, ask people how they are doing, sometimes how they wanna run the dungeon, etc, but not a single time has no one talked. If I talked and no one responded i would leave the group before getting to the dungeon, no exceptions. It would creep me out.
---
It doesn’t defeat the purpose of dungeons. Nobody runs a dungeon expecting a Krol Blade to drop, you are there for the boss loot tables. 
---
If I don’t need any gear from the dungeon, and I’m only there to gold farm, by your logic am I entitled to roll need on BOE epic items? That’s what I’m there for.
---
Chromie doing the Hat Kid Smug Dance fucking kills me.
---
Cultists over there doing cultist stuff.
---
Arcane crystals exist only to be transmuted into Arcanite.  As far as I can see, there is no other use for them until phase 6 when they are used for some trade ins and maybe attunement to Naxx.  The reason people need arcane crystals is to transmute them into arcanite.  The reason arcanite is more expensive than arcane crystals is the 2 day transmute cooldown.  I buy an arcane crystal every 2 days, transmute it, and sell it for a 5-10g profit on AH every single time.  If you're buying arcane crystals with the intent of hanging on to them for later (as prices climb), you will be wasting a ton of time if you don't transmute them into arcanite on every CD.
---
I can have fun with content that isn't difficult.
---
The greed button is a gold coin for a reason.
---
That’s not really fair when the whole group contributes to farming the BoE in a dungeon or raid setting. Why would anyone else care about your epic mount either? In my opinion the fairest situation, would be someone that equips the item and gets a big upgrade, or pre bis. You can go farm in the open world for your epic mount, don’t make people running dungeons for loot suffer from your greed. It’s a group effort, the rolls should be discussed as a party before people just automatically roll need without thinking about the item/situation first. It’s polite to ask.
---
I'm on my 4th character now (keep re rolling for reasons I cant explain)
---
They are all close to level 40 and each and every time, no matter what I was doing there were always other players around my level all around me. 
---
Server: incendius
---
Honestly, while I have no doubt OP is running into some real assholes, as they definitely exist in the game, I think he's joining very specific runs for very specific bosses and then wondering why no one wants to help him do some random quest on the other side of the dungeon they never pretended they were going to do. Most people are speed farming certain bosses for their BiS, if he wants to do dungeon quests, he needs to join groups that advertise quest runs.
---
You'll probably compete for some items especially at lower levels, but eventually he is going to put an emphasis on armor rating, stamina, and strength/agility whereas you will care more about strength and agility, so you'll probably only need about 75% of the same gear while leveling...
---
It sounds perfect for one of you to do skinning/leatherworking since you can make better items than you'd get as drops for both of you
---
Meh, we all needed on a rare BOE epic and it wasn't me that made choice to need. I won it and offered it to the person who could actually use it and even he said it was worth a lot and to think about it.
---
In the end he told me to just sell it. Sold it and was able to buy two BOE rares for me, a bunch of enchants, and had gold leftover for epic mount money. Really is the case that everyone can use what drops in ways that still gets them gear or what they need.
---
Can confirm this is me, usually win items the first or second time I see them. I'm a warlock and the most farming I had to do was LBRS, took around 20-30 runs before I won both gloves and pants (saw them both once and won them 2nd drop). Now they're both replaced. Considering I won Reed second drop, Skul's Touch first time I ever fought Skul, the shadow neck piece from Vectus first time it dropped, a Sorcerous Blade from MC pug off of a /roll against about 9 others, the %hit belt won on third drop after only maybe 10 arena runs... Yeah I'd say I'm in the minority and I'm totally aware of that.
---
Great episode on podcast called countdown to classic if you want to hear the creator describe what went into making it
---
Honestly warrior is a bad class for a new player, start up a hunter or warlock, you will hit 60 faster than continuing on your warrior.
---
And that warrior probably used the money to buy himself a BOE epic. See why people want to need?
---
While leveling doing instances, prot spec only gets you some bonus armor, bonus +def, and last stand. Other than that you really don't need to spec prot, you just need a sword and board, easy. Shit, if your heals are competent you can 2h tank most instance trash probably until around maura, maybe further.
---
People want instant gratification, not realizing its fun for a good 5 mins then there’s nothing left to do. It all sounds cool getting full epic that fast omg... but now what?
---
Simple. You don't need it. By definition, everyone should greed if the goal is to sell. If someone is going to equip, they should need. It's how the system is designed, and intended to be used. If you're needing an item you don't intend to equip, that's a ninja loot.
---
Now that obviously opens the chance up for someone to ninja, but that's a different issue. We're assuming people follow loot rules here.
---
120 is literally a fortune for that level dude, that’s all you need to know. Don’t worry.

---
Something something tianamen square
---
If it's a high value purple i'm needing, i don't trust anyone else to not ninja it.
---
Shadow healing is insufferable starting  at BRD if your tank is undergeared. Holy gives leeway if you get a bad tank, or they’re tanking brd in zf gear. With shadow you really need your tank to be decent
---
Less drama if all roll need for valuable BoE
---
Ret paladins are one of the most useless DPS classes IMO. They really shine in PvP though. You’ll be a cleanse/buff bot and more than likely pressured to go Holy.
---
No, they went humans etc on the earlier private servers, before they really knew what they were doing
---
the issue with this, is your taking the entire concept of greed and applying too some peoples pre bis or bis gear.
---
youd be livid if an important part of your gear dropped and the entire group rolls need on it just so they can sell it to you later.
---
yes if everyone rolls need it doesnt prevent ninjaing, it just turns everyone else into a ninja
---
if you have ever rolled need on an epic boe particularly the ones that are pre-bis and bis; then you are just as bad as the people who roll need on gear they dont NEED. because both of you are trying to sell the item
---
there is no justification for this, a person gears means more then your mount. but people decided to break the need&gt; greed rule because they didnt like the idea that someone MIGHT ninja an item.
---
this is why anytime real gear is involved its best to just group with a trust worthy loot master. (which alot of ppl hate because it means they cant ninja shit. they always say 'well this guy might ninja stuff!" but we both know its because they wanted to the option too roll need on some shit to sell it)
---
Arms is best for leveling
---
I would advertise in world chat that you are looking for an active guild to help you level and experience end game content/raiding with. You'll probably get plenty of responses. Make sure you specify ACTIVE guilds cuz a lot of guilds are not very active and guild chat is silent.
---
I have a macro for power shifting. I'll editing this post when I get online. it's doable.
---
I always use icehud and put a marker on mana bar. so if I'm above the marker I can safely powershift and not get left out of form.
---
This is the best thing Ive seen all week. the dances are fantastic. I was hoping for more Ricardo though
---
Usually there isn't an "after the opener". I don't live for world PvP, so I don't walk around in PvP gear. Not to mention you are talking about exactly what I said never happens, or I wasn't arguing against. 
---
It annoys me that you glossed over WotF and the situations where the Rogue opens up on you with 10s of stun which will usually 100-0 you. I just cannot fathom a world where Rogues who get the cheapshot kidney shot combo on a shadow priest do not win that fight. There are no pvp trinkets, and the literally only CC the priest has is RNG blackout procs and a single fear on a 20 second CD that gets broken if you are undead. So again. What exactly is the issue?
---
I wait to see how everyone else rolls.
---
From cata on I was an on and off player. Every new expansion I leveled one char to max (except of legion. Actually sad because I was told this one was good) and quit after that. Before classic I was willing to give bfa a chance because I rly needed my doze of wow. Couldn‘t play it at max level. Everything seems so redundant. Now I only play classic
---
It's still immaterial in a pvp situation. Taking one extra attack to gain an additional 10-15 yards of distance is well worth the trade off.
---
But above all, he should play the class he enjoys. If that happens to be warrior then he should rock on.
---
Pot kettle. But thanks for admitting it.
---
Bartender has a feature where the icon is red if your out of range. No actual range display tho but still handy
---
I like the idea of Roleplay servers, but does that not have PVP in it as well?
---
He's been told. Part of the BiS mentality is that if you just do one thing well, like DPS if you're a "DPS class" (doesn't exist; the class would be Warrior) then you're doing what you need to maximize your effectiveness. People don't even want tanks to grab aggro anymore. If Warriors did what they needed then a lot of issues would be solved before we could discuss them - like here - but this hyperspecialization leads players to think they only need to do one thing.
---
Okay good advice , bc the guild I'm in now theres a lot of times where I'm the only one online
---
/use [mod:shift] Blizzard (Rank 1); [mod:ctrl] Flamestrike; Blizzard
---
i get that you are funding multiple mounts, but dude, you have to be out of touch with reality to think that 140g is not much for a level 33. That would be more gold than 99% of players have at that level. Keep doing what you're doing.
---
ye and thats wrong.
---
his boe didnt drop, a mages (mine) did. he sold that staff to some poor mage who likely lost one previously, then goes to buy a boe that some random caster probably stole from a warrior.
---
its a vicious cycle because ppl become greedy.
---
like as a mage i already won the lottery just SEEING the item drop, then i have to win another roll vs 4 other ppl just so i can equip it.
---
and if were being honest, they likely spent that gold on an epic mount.
---
So to avoid the 1% chance that someone ninjas an item you deny people that would actually use the item an upgrade? Sounds like you are just looking for a reason to make some gold on the AH.
---
Yeah i went through a couple of those guilds before I found my current one. There are always 20 people online and making parties for dungeons/raids.
---
the population of those "bad classes" versus others is really very low. if op is one of only a handful trying to get into the raid it should be fine. your math doesn't check out.
---
Tier 3 gets a boost from matching [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] really well
---
One can be traded and the other cannot. That's the entire reason.
---
If you need on a DM:N item to vendor for 3 gold over someone's upgrade, that's a dick move, because the item would be worth a lot more than 3 gold to that person.
---
If you need on an item worth lots of gold... you need lots of gold, that's not a dick move. Same as the guy who can equip it does. He needs the gold, otherwise he would've bought it if he had the gold. Or he doesn't think it's worth the AH price. In which case, why equip it when you can sell it for an outrageous amount? If it's a guildie, there's at least some trust involved. If it's a random pug? Not a chance.
---
An item worth 3g to a vendor or 3g to DE, is worth 3 gold to you, but it's an upgrade to someone else. An item worth 300g on the AH is worth 300 gold to you, but also 300 gold to everyone else. I'm not passing up 300g because Timmy the mage who uses Blizzard and AE on 2 mob pulls needs his Freezing Band.
---
Where is this?
---
Same but I'm always up front by saying I don't know the dungeon.  I just let them know I don't know the hyper optimal pulls so we may be killing more stuff and if I need to know a boss mechanic let me know.
---
If you're not playing properly, *your talent build no longer matters.* At that point, conversation about how good talents are, is completely irrelevant. That's why discussion of optimal talents never circles around an assumption that the other 39 people in your raid are retarded.
---
You're also ignoring auxiliary benefits like being able to move more when you cast faster.
---
You dont happened to be on Bigglesworth Realm ? 😅
---
Nope high worth BoE items will be needed on. Sorry
---
I have completely stopped trying to make a wand macro work, all of them bug out, usually when you move while it’s active. Does anyone else have a similar issue?
---
Well this is true.
---
Part of it is to keep the game fresh.  It kind of makes sense.  Would you want the exact same abilities and rotation you're using now for years?  Probably not..
---
Yep, je ne sais quoi. Also an [Austin Powers reference](https://youtu.be/a6Acigj8isc)

I was playing shaman, I don't even have a shield :u
---
There are always more people joining and leveling alts. Never a bad time. Just pick a high pop server so it doesn't die when the population starts to fall a but later on.
---
Or maybe it’s a valid concern that the person who controls the loot, if it’s a random, is going to take it or give it to his buddies.
---
Like damn, at least use some common sense in the discussion, don’t be so cut and dry with your opinion.
---
Yeah if they’re anything like the dogs in DM:N it might be tough
---
That's not a problem though, you'd be competing with someone anyway - if you were playing a mage instead of rogue, you'd probably have another rogue in your party anyway. It's probably better when you can decide who gets which pieces, and if you want to farm a specifuc item you only need it to drop twice instead of potentially losing it to a different rogue every time.
---
I buy all kinda recipes from ah that i know i can get somewhere else. Im just too lazy to travel for em.
---
Its literally still the beginning of the game. And most people are not even 60 yet, only the super active players. I started about month ago and have no regrets. Yes there are people who are 60 and full bis raid gear, but so? Doesnt mean i wont catch up
---
I recommend playing an RP server, even if you don’t RP the people are a lot nicer in general in my experience
---
As soon as you get improved blizzard talent.
---
I feel like swp was the perfect level of difficulty. I remember going on trial runs with an alt while my main raid guild was kind of stuck on progression. The guild I was doing trials with had us go in, clear trash up to the first boss to get trash items and the epic gems, then we'd all zone out and reset the instance. We did that 2 or 3 times and got tons of stuff. So, I took that strat to my main guild. We'd organize swp trash runs and getting those epic gems, trash drops, and shit loads of gold helped push us over the edge to the point where we were able to get bt on farm including Illidan. It also helped us recruit because we'd pick up random people in trade, they'd see us melting swp trash and be impressed and come join our guild. I loved that time of WoW...
---
There are tons of all lvl players playing . Its never too late.
---
No your not entitled to rolling need on BoE items if your running dungeons for gold. If that’s your method then the whole party deserves a portion of the gold if you plan to just pawn the item. In a dungeon you are getting an item that you otherwise wouldn’t have obtained if you were by your self. So if someone actually will use the item and they lose te roll because of your greed, and disregard for their gearing/class effectiveness, you should share the gold as well. It’s not really fair when the whole group contributes to your epic mount you merely need for convenience.
---
Serious question. Have you tried using the global LFG channel?
---
I agree, but you can't avoid it in classic, cause everyone is going to press need anyway. The rule in vanilla was simple, you need? you wear/learn right away.
---
Yeah his post history is nothing but shitting on other players. Must be such a sad exsistence.
---
Well this is a perfect example of something i didn't know i needed until i saw it.
---
yet the stockade pauldrons didnt drop.
---
to put it simply, were all fighting rng trying to get our items too drop.
---
if the stockade pauldrons drop and i roll need on them then guess what? i just ninja'd them
---
the idea is if you win the roll to get the item too drop all you have to do is win the roll vs the people who are of a similar class/type as you.
---
yet people have turned it around to make greed the all defining rule
---
and you wanna know why?
---
because they hate that mages can aoe farm, "well that mage can farm ZF or Diremaul for gold so i guess its only logical that i can steal his item and sell it back to him!" even though the richest players are not aoe farming mages, but AH flippers and no-life normal grinders. (meaning the warriors in question are just lazy)
---
Biiiiig oof. Ouch man. I’ve already seen that sell for 1200g
---
&gt; why do you keep arguing this pedantic bullshit?
---
why do you think i'm the other person. I have a problem with your reasoning, not your conclusion.
---
Nice duel. Don’t macro weapon swaps into your stance changes. You’re incurring an extra GCD every time, and in this example, there was no reason that using a shield was necessary—defensive stance with a 2H would have been preferable.
---
It is in mine the other day the other day as I flew over people were talking about how Jesus was actually a cow the whole time. Hehe
---
pre-bis, which unless your lucky enough to get the mageblade in MC, its effectively bis.
---
It's restin'
---
Rolling need on something to sell for gold IS THE LITERAL MEANING OF GREED.
---
it's a dumb addon and list
---
He said, she said, you don’t know them, but you should believe what I say instead of looking at the actual data and math.
---
And yet weirdly they're the most confident. I get lectured about how to play best by people who started in *Mists of Pandaria* and *Legion* confidently - and worse, I teach math so like, I know the math better than they do. But they're so involved in this world that the cognitive dissonance is alarming. *Classic* is simply another game.
---
It's gold for everyone man. I won't roll on your bis but every purple that isn't ill roll
---
that i would of then equiped, and it wouldnt of been worth 400g anymore as a result.
---
so i was going to win 0g, and they were going to win 400g. seems fair
---
Guy in my guild, who is new to WoW, said he was having a hard time as a hunter. Turns out he had made it all the way to lvl 48 without training growl on his pet 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
If you are a tank and halfway competent you will find groups.  Take your time and don’t rush through the zones.  Most guilds would love a tank who studies content and wants to master their class.  As a warrior I would make friends with a healer and level with them if at all possible.  Having a pocket healer saves money and downtime.   Most Importantly have fun and enjoy the journey.
---
This is what i thought but i dont have an expirience in  postlvl60 wow so i wanted to be sure. Thank you man for a deep explanation.
---
Yes pal. What else does it bring to the table?
---
I was struggling with a build too. Personally I went 4/5 clear casting and 3/5 WC to save some points. Without dual spec it’s hard as hell to get a perfect build without sacrificing something. I’d probably agree this build is ideal for raiding but I refuse to get rid of shatter. It’s one of the most satisfying talents in the game.
---
I’ve honestly debated on just throwing out the arcane tree completely and soaks up 10 points. As much as I like clear casting, it’s still RNG as hell. And to be honest with better gear, mana pots, evo, and my robe of the arch mage, mana is becoming much less of an issue. Ragnaros/Ony don’t even stay alive all that long anyways. They are pretty damn quick fights
---
Nope on Heartseeker.
---
About to start Trib Farming. Does pet choice matter much? I've seen people do it with a Cat with Prowl but I'm wondering if a wolf works as well.

No, Ill sell it and buy something I do need you entitled brat
---
I feel robbed , i wanted Ricardo
---
Everyone should do that.
---
The guy is asking for advice and is saying the game has become a grind and is playing a Prot warrior which is mind numbing for even the most seasoned players.
---
Pvp is not so much a filler as it is the true endgame. But the grind first commence. Geared pvp is the goal of pve in classic, imho.
---
But I need gold.
---
What I meant was that taking 1 s-priest is more valid over taking 1 ret paladin. And that depends a lot on the amount of warlocks you bring.
---
Yuge
---
Your time is probably better off spent farming Mara/dm lashers for money and buying then to be honest
---
don't even need escape artist if you're combat! yeah, i haven't really had that much trouble with mages, personally.
---
Found the entitled baby.
---
It's not unique equipped?
---
Purple BoE drops, it's need.
---
If someone can use the BoE, make sure they equip. If they don't they're a ninja.
---
Blue BoE drops, it's greed unless someone is going to equip it.
---
Mounts/Bags drop, it's need.
---
It's the only way you can prevent people from being assholes and stealing items. This is what I've seen through most of my dungeon groups. Most people agree on these rules on my server, pretty standard stuff.
---
If Staff of Jordan drops and nobody can really use it for whatever reason....I'm not going to greed on it and miss out because someone else wants to wait until everyone greeds and hits need.
---
fist one is general tab with tradechat etc. 
---
second one is party/raid tab with group, raid, whisper, say, emote etc 
---
third one is whisper and bnet whisper only 
---
4. is dedicated to "loot" messages
---
5. is empty to make the chat invisable for a clean interface
---
That is a great point, aftermath might be the better option. The thing I'm struggling with is not having corruption. We could move a couple points from destro and get at least 3 points into Corruption, but the cast time could be better used for a direct damage.
---
Just reroll.
---
You didnt clarify, you repeated yourself. I understand why a lot of people think this, but the truth if the matter is that a BoE is as big of a upgrade for anyone that gets it as it is any single person in the group. Everyone can buy items on n the AH that are significant upgeades.
---
Then it’s a shame that your upgrade didnt drop. Don’t fuck over the person whose upgrade DID drop. If you want an upgrade and it doesn’t drop, solo farm somewhere/somehow and buy it. Or farm with a friend/guildies who have an agreement on what happens. Don’t poison the well for PUGs everywhere with this NeEd Evaraything muh gold attitude.
---
lol says the entitled baby crying over people that can actually grasp basic logic.
---
I think you’re confusing WoW with The Sims.
---
It’s not that complicated man. People need gear to play the game, and be effective. Most of the time, people don’t actually need BoEs and they aren’t a huge upgrade, so you will get your roll, and have a fair chance at it. People that expect to make money off of BoEs and dont have an alternative source of gold, or can’t flip BoEs on the AH instead, are entitled little shits....
---
Don’t expect to have groups carry you for your epic mount and personal gearing because your source of gold is needing BoEs Im dungeons lol. It was always need if you need, greed for greed. Like I said es not that complicated..... oh and MS&gt;OS always. Otherwise you ask about the item. Wanted to throw that out there, apparently you need some schooling in loot etiquette.
---
Sounds good and all but ppl don’t know other classes bis and cba knowing
---
I care.
---
That is what I was using before too with my SM/Ruin build. I just love Conflag. lol
---
Pew pew vs stab stab. Saved you a watch
---
Well there champ, when gold drops you can roll for it. Otherwise ROLLING NEED ON AN ITEM YOU ARE GOING TO SELL IS THE LITERAL MEANING OF GREED.
---
if you're engi (and i totally recommend you go engi, if you're not!) you gotta get yourself a https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector. absolutely a game changer against warlocks, and pretty helpful against spriests too, though it can't reflect their fear.
---
LOL
---
Plenty of people being ret Paladins. People are FAR too obsessed with this Min/Maxing bullshit, just as in vanilla, guilds progressed through all of the raids with sub optimal raid comps.
---
There are easier spots than that for the giant egg. I got mine in the hinterlands at level 42.
---
Nope
---
imagine for a second that the gear bosses dropped wasnt bop but instead boe.
---
do you honestly think that the current "GOTTA NEED MAN GOTTA NEED" rule set wouldnt get abused?
---
thats what this is, but on a much much smaller scale.
---
just because it only effects a small subset of items doesnt mean its a good system. it doesnt mean im an entitled brat (we'll get to this later btw) because i want people to roll on gear they NEED instead of forcing greed down everyones throat.
---
what it comes down to, is people hate farming money. and they see it as winning the jackpot. when really they didnt win shit, the class that the item is for won. not the random warrior, rogue and hunter rolling on a caster item.
---
part of me always wanted all gear to be boe, so we could just farm gold and buy it. but the other part of me knows that if that happend groups would adapt this shit system and people like you would accept it because theyre the entitled brats.
---
because see; your not an entitled brat for thinking an item ment for your class should go to you. your an entitled brat for thinking any and all boe gear is rollable.
---
Well that doesn't help with bubble hearth
---
Here it sits on my server for about 200g....My server's Auction House is trash. I make gold every day by scanning and buying items below vendor value and reselling to a vendor. Send help.
---
I'm a little hunter short and stout.
---
Here is my pet I'm sending him out.
---
"Why the hell is growl on?" They scream and shout.
---
Everybody votes to kick the huntard out!
---
- dungeonfinder and raidfinder
---
- different dungeon and raid difficulties
---
- transmog
---
- titanforging
---
- class pruning
---
- shitty character progression and removal of meaningful items especially legendaries (can you even name one item your character is wearing except for maybe a trinket?)
---
- mobile game mechanics that are tailored to make you come back every day (fomo) and you never are done with anything
---
- way too big power differences between items, making everything useless when a new content patch comes out
---
- in game real money shop and trading cards, promotion items etc.
---
Prat
---
I had Eye of Flame drop for me today off trash in Felwood. There are a few in the AH for 30g. Should I hold onto this and sell when mages switch to fire spec?(Zg,AQ ish?)
---
But then he or she wouldn’t get any attention.
---
Ah, I see you've discovered the reasoning behind the changes in the loot system over the years.
---
Need before greed being codified in later patches happend for a reason. Personal loot happened fir a reason. No system is perfect, and the one in classic is one of the worst.
---
Do large seaforium charges work in place of The Shadow forge Key?
---
I can't figure out how onyxia lock out works?  
---
When does it reset? I've heard people say you can do her twice per week?  
---
My guild is going to do her this Wednesday, would it be possible to do her again later on the week again then?
---
DME jump farm. It’s nerfed but if you have herb it’s worth. Got 28g in two runs which took a little under 30m.
---
Also, I’m Arc Frost. Imp Blizzard is not needed
---
Trolls can't be warlocks though
---
55 healing is equivalent to green lens, and considering greens can go up to 64 or so, it's not rly worth a lot especially since it's not cloth. Leather helm from rend is better I think.
---
I joined vanilla 6 months into the life of my server and still had a blast. It really isn’t about a race unless you’re just into that Kinda thing. It is definitely more about the experience.
---
iiiiiiii knnnnoooowwwww rrrrrriiiiiigggghhttr????!?!?!!11
---
Relentlessly farming elementals for your robe. This is what I did and by the time I hit 56, I had all the mats saved up for it and crafted before I could even wear it. It’s BIS until a long ass time, so it’s worth it.
---
Seriously take advantage of knocking out 2 birds with one stone. You grind out XP + your essences. Post 60 I don’t think I could stomach farming it.
---
Just classic.
---
Being a mage:
---
Getting to make my own food/water
---
Being able to teleport around the world is incredible
---
So many tricks to solo a lot of things not meant to be soloed 
---
Having access to some of the best gold farms in the game
---
Being able to turn Xv1 ganks around
---
I honestly love being a mage
---
This. I also hopped on for the event, thought I would do a world boss while waiting in the horseman queue. Within 10 seconds of the fight I had like 15-20 random buffs/spell effects and didn't know what a single one of them did.
---
Yeah got a good chunk of my money from selling Airs
---
Fantastic thanks!
---
I haven't tested that,  but if rogues can pick it i would think so.   The key is easy enough to get,  i always got it while leveling in BRD.
---
So I can tell.
---
How many WC mages do you have?
---
This is high quality content.
---
Everyone needs gold.
---
If I need something specific I'll let the party know beforehand that I am looking for x. I'll greed/pass everything else.
---
Sometimes it doesn't work and people need it still, but that's life. And I'll just keep grinding, because I enjoy the game and don't let that stuff get to me.
---
I’m not sure how you can mention FC and eskhander’s in the same comment. Eskhander’s is absolutely terrible and if you go search for it in FC you’ll see abundant ridicule. Not being able to build weapon skill seriously neuters any weapon choice.
---
Do not stop piercing ice dear lord
---
This is so wrong man.
---
5 days??
---
&gt;because youre an entitled brat doesnt mean everyone should bend the knee.

---
There’s a warrior named Executive on Whitemane Alliance that reserves all orbs for Strat live runs. Yeah I’m naming and shaming, fuck that guy
---
Fury tanks do more damage, more threat, and the mit hit they take isnt unreasonable for me to heal through. I love good fury tanks. 
---
Bad furies are worse than bad prots, which are worse than good prots, which are worse than good furies.
---
Dude, being in high demand for dungeons is why we make a warrior what are you doing
---
And if you roll need and don't equip the item, and in fact sell it for another item THAT'S GREED. If the Mage could and will and does equip it, that's need. If the mage says he needs it, takes it and sells it THATS FUCKING GREED. 
---
I don't understand what is so difficult here. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins
---
NEED is not one of the deadly sins. Quite clear.
---
Just go Arc Frost. You’ll pound meters and still be able to AoE DME no problem.
---
**Seven deadly sins**
---
The seven deadly sins, also known as the capital vices, or cardinal sins, is a grouping and classification of vices within Christian teachings, although it does not appear explicitly in the Bible. Behaviours or habits are classified under this category if they directly give birth to other immoralities. According to the standard list, they are pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and sloth, which are also contrary to the seven heavenly virtues. These sins are often thought to be abuses or excessive versions of one's natural faculties or passions (for example, gluttony abuses one's desire to eat, to consume).

I made a lot of alts before I settled into my priest main who is currently level 36.

There are always more players leveling than players running end-game content at any given moment.

As they say, the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The second best time is today.

Come join the party!

Right click the frame and select unlock frame, then click and drag where you want and lock it back
---
I'm not sure where you got that idea from, they said they were going to release things at the same speed of original classic basically.
---
Imagine for a second you dont sit there and come up with ridiculous instances to back up you failed logic. 
---
If you cant grasp basic logic then I cant say anything else, people like you will never change, you will always cry about not getting yours. So yes you ARE and entitled brat, every single person in the run has a shot at the 100g item, YOU dont deserve shit.
---
Still for the next year and an half only max level zones mattered.

Anyone know if the mage quest - investigate the alchemist shop is bugged? I've used that scroll in every corner/surface that I can and no mobs appear.
---
People are trying to hawk them in trade for 110 on Grobb which is a full server
---
Pots in duels are bad form.
---
It was a meh class on pservers and on classic they are hard nerfed
---
&gt; Do YOU understand how percentages work? 
---
My degree would suggest I do.
---
&gt;And that figure on Wowhead is clearly WRONG. Go read through the Wowhead comments, everybody is echoing my sentiment. 
---
I seem to recall that a bunch of people believed the Earth was flat... didn't make them correct.
---
&gt; Why do people like you find it necessary to post? "Do you understand how percentages work"?  
---
Because a) I can and b) I wanted to check in case you actually didn't understand them rather than being a whiny bitch.
---
&gt; Do you know how condescending that is? 
---
Yes but don't you worry if you don't
---
&gt; Who the fuck doesn't know how percentages work? 
---
Erm... you?
---
And then the timer runs out and no one rolled
---
My game has been acting weird since yesterday and I'm not sure what to do. I was leaving a ZF instance and got stuck on the loading screen.  I restarted the game and I was dead and as soon as I revived I saw no npc's and none of my spells were working.  I /reload a few times and it fixed the issue eventually.  Now today the same issue is occurring but will not fix no matter how many times I /reload.  Anyone know how to fix this?
---
What if I plan to donate the gold to war orphans?
---
i dont think this is true but id love to see evidence. afaik every race has a unique rig (not including allied races) and the dances are only animated for their intended rig. all of the animations in this video are custom, not copy pasted from one race to another
---
If it makes you feel any better, there are things I’ve played through for years but just now made connections with.
---
In undead strat for example, I’ve known that you can target and /dance to CC the neutral ghosts if your hunter pulls them with multi shot, but it wasn’t until classic that I realized that’s why the piccolo (AoE dancing trinket) is in the dungeon.
---
Thats not true. Every group I have ever been in all greeds unless they are going to equip it.
---
Any greeders?
---
For sure, just make sure you roll on a high pop server.
---
Cool still had to run tons of recruits tbrough older dungeons to attune so the fact that they made at least gearing easier was a huge God send.
---
Passing on an upgrade because it's not BiS is intentionally gimping yourself. Why would you suggest someone gimp their DPS intentionally?
---
Besides, it's a fucking video game. It means nothing. Focus on what's important in life (hint: it's not a video game).
---
there are a LOT of casters wearing greens of healing/+school damage. i agree that sacrificing stats isn't always the best idea, but that type of gear is extremely popular.
---
Yes... obviously it's not going to go for THE EXACT SAME PRICE AS AN ARCANE CRYSTAL+TRANSMUTE...
---
.....
---
Triggered.
---
The west side of Feralas, overlooking the islands.  Or the west side of Desolace, near the Troll village there.
---
The problem is it shouldn’t have been an upgrade win the first place.
---
And it’s not just a video game, it’s other people’s time.
---
Agree, this is definitely an all need situation.
---
Then we played different games.
---
Thelesamar seems lovely
---
That scream at the end tho!
---
When something is just 100% obviously written sarcastically do you just assume it's so sarcastic it has to be honest?
---
I was in the shop, but I guess my spawns ONLY happened in the area near the meat wagons...weird. got it
---
You can't have it all. It's as easy as that.
---
Destro is not that strong yet. Destro shines in later part of vanilla (AQ gear).
---
You're wrong.  The need/greed system is designed for BoP vs VENDORING item. 
---
BoEs, by definition, represent a need. 
---
That's the default.  If you want it to be different establish it before the run.
---
Bingo. That’s the one situation in which I think macro info the weapon swap to the stance swap is good. However, once you have pummel you’ll always use that over shield bash, and even without pummel, I think shield bash is questionable in a duel.
---
&gt;I know you people will never get it, its beyond the scope of your feeble minds. 
---
Lol case in point
---
Azshara is a zone not just a character.
---
And it's a shame, Planetside 2 completely abandoned any sort of actual benefits. For the first couple of years, you didn't even get _Certs_ for leveling. Now you only get them to 15, but only 1500 in total (a gun and a half.)  
---
Oh, and Planetside 2 was killed by Planetside Arena, so there's that.
---
Hinterlands seems quiet . I like the beach full of turtles
---
This is a special place

And that was rookie numbers, there's some av's that took entire weekend to finish

Got perdition last night and hitting 300 dps :D 600+ dps with AR on.

Far and away #1 dps now, big gap between me and #2 on dps.

Don’t think I saw our feral hit top 10 once last night
---
The community was asking for a game that prioritised immersion over convenience.
---
Iron forge for sure. I love the snow.
---
It’s the one below improved devotion aura on the Prot tree. 
---
PM if you want me to send you my setup I’ve read a lot into ret pala and have played since vanilla.
---
Human is better for ret because of the increase wep skill by 5 for swords and maces.
---
As standard all other classes at level 60 have a hit cap of 5% against players to ensure they never miss. For humans wielding a sword or mace this is only 2%
---
Which means if you increase your hit chance with gear by 2% as a human you’ll never miss against a player. Very vital for ret as you are trying to get a slow 2 handed because of SoC
---
Not even the same person man.
---
&gt; you entitled brat 
---
Oh, the irony.
---
Yikes, lots of idiots in the comments trying to get people to greed on BoEs which is just going to cause more drama because someone will ninja it. WHY, WHY would you ever give someone the CHANCE to ninja an item when you can prevent it by ALL NEEDING on it? If you win and decide that the warrior deserves that 400g epic shield, then you can trade it to him. There's just no reason to allow a ninja the opportunity to take something though, that's absolutely ridiculous.
---
If some people instant-greed and you feel guilty about them not knowing that everyone needs BoEs, then tell them to /roll and if they beat your roll, then you can give it to them, but what you guys are advocating for is chaos and drama in disguise. Maybe you aren't doing it on purpose, but everyone needing is the definition of fair. The winner can choose to follow his own morals and rules and do with it as he pleases, be it greedy and keeping the gold, or giving it to another member to use.
---
Also, there is nothing preventing that warrior from selling the shield anyway. Just passing or giving him the item is very likely to be the literal equivalent of 400g dropping and letting him need roll it uncontested. It would be nice if we lived in a world where no one would ninja things and people would use expensive BoEs the second they drop rather than selling them, but we do not live in that world and never will.
---
Feralas or Teldrasil
---
A zone heavily inhabited by Naga.
---
it 100% is a ninja, but it's somewhat basic etiquette to need on purple BOEs in pug groups simply because everyone knows that some people are snakes. You avoid the drama when it's understood that you just roll need on them. 
---
Usually when I see one drop in a 5 man I just yell in all caps for everyone to NEED it. Can sort it out after if needed, but everyone got their chance.
---
Someone having spent time and effort on their own to get gold and get good gear should not get punished as a result. 
---
Being a fresh 60 or having full green level 30 gear should not entitle you to a ton of gold and guaranteed rolls on super valuable items.
---
Absolutely ridiculous
---
You won’t do very well in raids when none of your class’ / spec’s gear drops then. You should get used to the fact that when a purple drops another class other than you will probably be rolling on it, including BoE world drops.
---
As a mage, I would be totally fine if I was in a group and a warrior rolled need over his group so he could use the Fiery War Axe.
---
Why the fuck would he whole group roll need on it over him just so they can get gold? That person just got extremely lucky that their wep dropped. We’ll all have our lucky day too. Welcome to  MMORPG life
---
Actually I think I get what they're saying. In Everquest classic for instance, dps rotations are not complex in the least. However, pulling more than one mob can spell death so being proficient and quick with cc is a vital skill. The most powerful class in that game is on that focuses almost primarily on control, only dpsing if theres nothing else to do.
---
Cat isn't the best raid pet at all. Wolves with furious howl are best, and until rare pets get nerfed Snarler and his bonus resists is the best wolf for raiding.
---
He can buy it.

"Das gewisse Etwas"
---
Berserking takes a global and energy. It's actually a DPS loss. Yes they are Horde, that said being human and being able to hit +8 swords exactly with weapon expertise is almost assuredly going to keep swords above daggers ally side.

I buy lower potions all the time on the AH 2-3 gold for a bunch of stat increases can make dungeons super smooth

How do you install Healcomm? I downloaded it and moved everything into the standard addon folder but that did nothing... I have the daunting feeling I'm missing something rather obvious.
---
I stoped replying to them lol it was a fair fight 
---
Glad you agree, especially considering I was at a disadvantage being a warrior and all haha
---
A bad troll keeps responding, a successful troll says one thing and everyone else argues from then on. I'm sorry you've only seen bad trolls if you think they should keep responding.
---
Right? I usually have blue gear in the bank waiting on me to level so I can use it.
---
I just got my whirlwind ax and earlier I almost got Ravager from SM. Shammy won the roll...
---
Hinterlands, Un’Goro, or STV
---
Following their logic...you realize that they'd also pass on high value drops they can't use, right? I'd happily pass on edgemaster handguards if a fury warrior needed them...as long as he equips them!
---
How could you call that entitled or selfish? It's sensible gear distribution. If no one can/will use a drop then all need makes sense but I'm not taking upgrades from people who are lucky enough to have them drop in the first place.
---
What's selfish is taking an upgrade that drops from someone because you want to sell it. I don't know how you can argue any other way.
---
As a sword rogue absolutely, if the majority of your damage is from white hits as dagger you’re doing it wrong.
---
not everyone can afford 100g a week in respecs depending how much you play.
---
The biggest shock for new players at 60 has got to be the difficulty in finding groups as a DPS. If you want a specific item that the tank also needs, like Cape of Black Baron or Savage Gladiators Chest, the chance of you getting into a group with that tank is next to none. The reserve meta took hold of Classic something fierce.
---
It’s bis for fire resistance, that’s about it buddy. No int/Stan/crit/hit. 36 is good.. but you can get near enough that plus some stats.
---
Edit: why downvote me? Withblade+Spirit of Aquamentis is 34 spell damage and 8 intellect. You really wouldn’t sacrifice 2 spell damage for 8 int?
---
Moonglade
---
Going for 300+ on my server so i would hold on to it
---
I’ve done the same thing selling straight to Horde n the neutral AH. I’m on Benediction and sold each pattern a couple times at that price. The market has kind of stagnated now though.
---
I love how this game 15 years later really brought out the trash players who can actually justify things like that.
---
It's honestly amazing to watch people like you try to have a conversation.
---
sure. but today its 1 night cleared without any buffs or flasks. mc is not hard or complicated. and i say this respectfully, i honestly love classic overall, just very disappointed with the endgame.
---
I did thanks to posting this video, honestly never knew you could turn it off!
---
Sally Whitemane flossing is the best thing I’ve seen all year
---
Look if u have a server Discord, i found my current guild on it and its active !
---
I’m currently at +316 daggers
---
I swapped +11 spirit offhand for +20 healing, and swapped my +3 spirit wand for +11 healing wand...
---
I kinda sorta feel like 14 spirit is a lot, but 31 healing is also a lot, and +healing wands are rather hard to come by at lower levels...
---
It also goes very nicely with my +healing mace from SM Cath, and I'm still sitting at 251 spirit at lv40
---
There was a Holy Shroud on the AH for 5g... I was tempted to snag it but I'm not sure if the int and spirt sacrifice from SM Cath hat is worth it, I don't have the MP5 gear yet to support a heavy sHP build.
---
Hell ya right next to the flight master , hollering at all the hotties on vacation
---
This video made me feel like every character in old Azeroth is as excited to have Classic again as we are
---
Someone insert the Paul Jr/Paul Sr chair throw meme here
---
I know a bunch of people that still raid and do arena on retail.
---
Thanks!!
---
Looking through your recent post history, all I see is you commenting on random posts about how wrong OP is and how superior you are to them. You even show off how many friends you had! Sad to see it was so few... Good coping mechanism but you might want to get a life :)
---
But it is an rpg game which is why people who love the rpg aspects say retail is shit. It stopped being an RPG and started being actiony
---
Thats actually the optimal choice.
---
Haha, hell yes
---
The AH takes a cut you have to account for.  Also paying for transmute means you get the money instantly.
---
This is why I only run shit with my guild. We just look at it like adults, talk about it like adults, and its never a problem. If someone needs it, they need it. If someone needs money so bad they want to need it, we figure out why they need money that bad, and fix that problem. Back to only having people need things they will equip. Greed if no one needs, then you can sell. Anything else is justifying ninjaing.
---
That part of desolace is so nice
---
Some crazy gymnastics there buddy

Great content!

Off topic but song name?

Most people struggle to afford their mount by level 40, so I think you're doing ok ;)
---
lol you're all over the thread calling people babies and talking about logic. What did you ninja recently my dude?
---
*Bounce bounce bounce*
---
Thank you! had no idea i think i might try for a +22 int then since doesnt boost that healing that much
---
its been explained a million times in this thread alone, if you cant grasp it then Im sorry, youre a lost cause.
---
Ungoro for life
---
Looks more like a smoke break.
---
Nothing, But i cant WAIT for the day I roll need on something and someone comes crying to the forum about it. Which btw, still isnt considered a ninja lot, just because your feelings are hurt doesnt mean you can change definitions :)

Are you really still this upset?

300dps isn’t good. You should average 350+ with dal rends

Pure creativity, love it
---
Alliance can’t gank you if you kill them first :D
---
That would actually be an ideal solution
---
Be big brain like me. I play tank so if I catch you doing something bad you get put on a list.
---
On several occasions people from my list have shown up. I tell the group what they did and ask if they would rather have that Hunter or keep looking for a tank.
---
Yeah but which one
---
The song is not. But the dance is. And the dance is in the game because they liked a fan video: https://youtu.be/LMeWnLUH4A8

Can I piggy back off this post? I'm horde on smolderweb aswell collecting companions! I've grinded the black and green whelps, and bought all the vendered I could but alliance companions are a dream for me too!
---
I’d finally form an army and take back my homeland of Gnomeregan!!! Someone’s gotta do it if Mekatorque just wants to sit by the cogs in Iron-forge.

That's the impression a ton of posts give me around here. They make me feel like some people take vanilla for the ultimate version of WoW that was never surpassed ever again. Gives me the impression that vanilla is flawless to them. And while it's certainly not everyone, and possibly not even the majority, those kinds of posts still get upvoted and they're most of what I see on the front page. I guarantee you a "vanilla is awesome, retail sucks" post will get way more upvotes than "hey guys, retail isn't that bad". That baffles me, as I've run into way more obviously flawed game mechanics in vanilla than in retail. The only "redeeming" factor is that it was the whole point and people were supposed to know what they were getting into.
---
As for what you said, if the market wasn't accepting it well, Blizz wouldn't keep on releasing expansions. If it wasn't profitable, they'd stop or change things up drastically. But they haven't because WoW is still popular. Maybe not as much as during its golden age, but still more than enough for all intents. They've made some great improvements over the years, things that just aren't there in classic at all and that I'm dearly missing. I took them for granted like everyone else before I tried classic, and only now do I realize how much they've improved. They might've fucked some other things up, but WoW is definitely still a good product for me, my friends, and a whole lot of people who're still playing it.

All the top parsing sword rogues are horde, Im alliance.
---
Then it's not BoE.  BoE's are intended to be partywide loot and allowed to be sold on the AH. They are intended to be part of the economy.
---
Blizzard is very clear about what ninja looting is and that requires stating loot rules before the run.
---
If the loot rules aren't stated, I need. You can give it to the person that needs it as an upgrade if you win it if you feel like it.
---
Edit: downvotes don't change the fact that blue posts weighed in on this.  It's not hard.  You don't have a right to complain about this because you're too lazy to simply state loot rules.  The solution is easy and available, use it. Just macro them.
---
This is purely amazing
---
Also, I tried finding the song but it’s not as lowkey as this one. Did the creator edit the song?
---
blizzard killed the census addons, so probably not
---
No, you still payed 400g in opportunity cost.

You don't get it, she's waiting for her husband to come pick her up.

Thanks man I do appreciate it! I would have uploaded original audio but I was watching netflix thinking I was completely solo, little did I know the guy that had been corpsecamping me for almost a week was sitting in shadowmeld ready in the perfect position
---
Afterwards I realize just how easily I could have lost it and been stuck camping for another endless amount of hours. Lucky to have used my SS, usually I'm too lazy.  If the hunter just sent his pet instantly, If he just killed mine, if he just purely focused on killing me. Hell i dont know what would happen if he just feign death'd after killing me, does it go on his pet or does it legitimately just instantly evade and poof I'm fucked. What if I spent another simply 2 SECONDS killing another mob elsewhere. It spawned right as I swam towards the direction of the boat I think. 
---
 A video doesn't describe the amount of emotion, pressure, stress after having camped something for  many, MANY hours and the guy who has been shitting down your throat during that entire time with 20 level lead is on top of you.  Going from completely unprepared laid back definition of lazy, careless grinding to highest pressure situation (solid 50+ hours of time on the line) a game can almost provide. All I can say is I hope I can find something in WoW gives me a taste of something similar.

Underrated comment.

Next time a world drop happens in your dungeon, I’m glad I won’t be in your group!

I sold a pair like week 3 for 250 and thought it was undervalued, good to know I was wrong
---
Thanks. Much appreciated. 
---
Does this logic also apply to a Holy Paladin?
---
Fair point. I'd need to dig into logs to confirm for you, but I'm still fairly certain swords is going to be your best bet, especially considering we have examples of straight Dal'rends beating Perdition's CHT combos. Swords has been the consensus spec from day 1.
---
As an aside you're likely itemizing incorrectly with what you have if you're at 316 Daggers. The glancing blow damage reduction stops at 308. Your last 8 points are giving you less than 1% hit in total benefit. If you have ACLG you don't need Mugger's Belt or Distracting Dagger. Better to use a Bonescraper or a t1 belt. Also smart to take a point out of weapon expertise which is nice for the flexibility of your talent tree. 1 point of weapon expertise plus ACLG gets you 308 perfectly.
---
Don't underestimate the laziness of some people. I've also been checking regurarly for Horde recipes on the BB AH, and they rarely come up tbh. Probably higher demand than availability
---
Nice gesture m8, hope more people take your example😄👍
---
Yeah but you would have the flight path for the future.
---
Nah, I bet it's alliance.

Good way to get /gkicked

It's been almost two months worth of play time.

Almost every zone is heavily inhabited by something that wants to kill you. I fail to see the issue.

I havent laughed this much for a long time.

Perfect voice acting.

ITT: people who don't understand what ninja'ing is despite Blizzard being very clear about what it actually is and enforcing it.  State your loot rules before making a run or it's *not* ninja.

Rain Fire might just be the best way to get your team to flame.

You're right... I won't kill you... But I don't have to save you.

This could have been the dance studio announcement.  In another timeline.

You mean guarantee a ninja roll.
---
This video has two or three of those "something"s.
---
No idea what this video is about but I love it!
---
Or if you're an opportunist like me then you don't say anything when you notice ninja looting and just try to counter ninja loot it yourself
---
To further clarify; spell coefficients for direct casted spells are based on a 3.5 cast speed. Something with a 2 second cast will likely be a 2.0/3.5% coefficient. For classes with reduced cast time talents, it's based on the original cast time.
---
Ding Ding. 
---
I played all the time trying to improve my toon so i could raid to see content, I did this all the way to Lich King.
---
As soon as they made it so I could see it thru LFR I had zero desire to see the same content on a harder mode. Adding LFR and Different difficulty scales ruined raiding for me.
---
Definitely a naga.

This is how you don’t get invited to groups.

they've made a work around that basically triggers the /who whenever you interact with the game

About to start playing classic, which EU PvP server should I go for? I will play horde. 
---
Thinking between Ashbringer and Zandalar Tribe since from what statistics I could find these are the only 2 high population servers with balanced factions.
---
Greed doesen't work since need takes priority over it.
---
What they should've done is something they actually introduced at some point i belive, where if you click Need on a bind on equip item it casued the item to become soulbound.
---
What guarantee do you have that the guy you've never met before and likely won't group with agian rolling need actually intends to equip the item and not just sell it himself?
---
True, I have run scholo 7 times to get my shoulders and they still have not dropped

This is wrong and was never the rule in classic 15 years ago. Source: 200 days played in classic WoW.

I used to have a buddy that I played with shortly after launch. We ran Deadmines with a pug. He needed every single drop. He started getting tells from other party members and I even told him to stop. His response to me was, “I NEED the gold.” I whispered everyone else and asked them not to boot me if they booted him. He got real mad when they booted him a minute later and not me.
---
Obviously only when she's in her native Dragonform.
---
? you missed the point? everyone has access to pots. not just alchs. the only advantage alchs have is instead of buying the pots on the AH they can just buy the mats instead.
---
Add dodges, parries, and crits to that. Miss an execute and your dps suffers a lot.
---
Mimiron firefighter was the most intense fight in the game imo.  Ive done almost every fight as current content and nothing tops that.
---
I mean the way you start it just lets you know youre in for some shit.
---
Unpopular opinion: I think everyone should hit need on epic BOEs in pugs. It protects everyone.
---

---
Chemo isn't good for cancer.
---
So because of your class, you are entitled to 300-400g? Fuck that. We all need that gold. Farm the gold and buy it.
---
You can't split gold because nobody is going to wait a week for your item to sell. Everyone rolling on the item is as good as you can get.
---
I don't know about that. There's nothing challenging about MC and when BWL releases it will be " how long do we take to clear this?" not "can we clear this?". Majority of raid content in classic is just a matter of time. If anything, each expansion added more challenging content for the bleeding edge, which is the one thing retail still does right.
---
I have been skipping most of my skills on my warrior, including pretty much every tanking skill as I level as Fury and at 36 I only have 62g. I have been somewhat keeping up with my Blacksmithing, but even then I've broken about even or a small profit from leveling it as I also have mining to keep costs down.
---
That mother fucker is literally up and down this thread calling people entitled brats lol
---
I don't think he's trying to convince anyone else at this point.
---
More specifically I bet it's a dwarf. I don't know why but they are always spouting something stupid in trade chat. Must be all the booze now that I think about it.
---
By giving it to ther person that "needs" it all you are doing is saving them the money they would have spent to purchase it from the AH. It is literally the same thing.
---
Isn't it uninhabited long term? I seem to remember (in Vanilla quests) that you could only enter there for a short period of time without getting sick.
---
Thats sad, i think alot of lower levels would appreciate u helping out
---
&gt;Honestly for me mostly, its classes and what they can do. Back then classes had roles, niches they filled. Now it's all basically the same. Everyone has a heal, everyone has a stun \[rip shamans, only killable stun in game\] and everyone does essentially the same thing of build up to blow spender moves.
---
Exactly this. I went back to retail PvP and BGs are an absolute mess. Everytime I try to discuss it with players about how messy it is, the usual response is that BGs aren't "real pvp" and to go to arenas. That's...not a good usual response. And when the response to why can't I kill healers is "Oh, you usually can't 1v1 healers"...why? 
---
It is something I see in a lot of MMOs. Developers never want to decrease, they only want to increase. Class keeps getting kited too easily? Give it a gap closer? Oh now another class is getting gap closed by too many classes? Give him a leap. Oh now classes can't catch that class? Give a few stuns. Oh now another class is getting stun locked? Give it a break and a leap. So on and so forther. Overtime it just turns into an absolute mess. 
---
My friends and I have been calling it high availability, low impact balance style. Classes have access to a shit ton of stuff, but each individual item has less of an impact. Gw2 became the same thing very fast too. 
---
I'll probably get downvotes for this too, but a lot of the QoL and changes made to WoW make...sense. Classic is popular, but I think retail is still more popular. By a lot. If they didn't make a lot of these changes, another MMO would have come along to take its spot. For example, LFG. I'm on a low alliance population side. Finding a group is an absolute hassle. Sitting there spamming for a group as a tank for 20-40 minutes. It gets boring, fast. The server combinations/battlegroups thing? Oh yeah, I can see that. My server feels dead at many times. Especially at endgame when there's \~7 people in plaguelands.  So many times I've given up on elite quests because I couldn't find a group for it. Raiding is also a hassle, so the LFR and raid changes also make sense. I've been in a lot of raids (or seen them) where like 3-4 people keep a majority of the loot in the whole "loot council" systems. Multiple raids in a row. There are BIG time obvious favorites and it fosters a situation where everyone is trying to brown nose the higher ups. The RK system is a bit better, but still frustrating. I come home usually max 2 hours to play a day, maybe 4 on the weekend. I deal with politics all day in real life, why would I want to deal with more politics in a game. Then you have try hards that do things like not allowing paladin tanks in a dungeon group, and they just regurgitate something they read on a streamers stream about them being bad. So they sit there and look for a tank for another 40 minutes. Or the "cleave" groups where everyone wants to do these super specific farms to rush to 60. It surprisingly difficult at times just to find a regular group to do a regular dungeon. I think in short, there are a significant number of QoL improvements that were made to help people who can't spend 4+ hours a day playing and to help reduce the impact toxic players have on the game. And its that why it seems that retail is more popular than classic. Classic is still popular/successful, don't get me wrong. But I think retail resonates with the majority more. 
---
In all honesty, if they did the following (in order of priority), retail would be 100x more fun. Rework classes to make them feel more unique/fun. Make them feel more like the power fantasy of the classes. Rebalance the game to make PvP feel more fun/rewarding in combat and in rewards themselves. I had a 18 minute RBG (not large/elite) queue on Saturday during peak hours. That's a bad sign on the view on PvP. Finally, make gearing a little more...interesting. Make it require thought. If you look in Classic, you're paying more attention to just the ilvl. You're seeing the stats, you're seeing the special effects. I mean you've got level 50-55 items that are BIS for 60 players. And it is many times a special stat combo or effect. I would love to see that kind of gearing now. But That may be the most difficult one to accomplish, which is why I put it last.
---
I'd say at least 30% of classic players have come from retail, probably more like 50%.  Last year during blizzcon when they did the classic demos, I came across it on youtube and resubscribed for the first time since WoD.   I played retail probably a few hours a week mostly running through old raids.  I basically only came back to retail because of classic - now I'm just 100% classic.
---
Curious...Do you check everyone's gold amount upon entering an instance? How much gold they have is irrelevant. No one is more entitled to a BOE just because they can equip it and no one in your group owes you anything. What if that "fresh 60" is someone's alt? What if they're only planning on playing casually and don't actually NEED BiS gear? What if it actually has shit stats for the spec they want to play? None of that matters because everyone gets an equal shot at the roll. Unless I'm doing a guild group run, I don't give a shit.   
---
Side note: an epic BOE dropped in a guild Strat run in vanilla. We were all allowed to roll on it then the guild leader tried to pressure me into giving it to one of our off tanks after I won the roll. I bought my epic mount instead which allowed me to farm herbs for guild flasks more efficiently and the warrior survived fine without it.
---
Yup.
---
Hahahahah
---
This is common. There are a lot of freaks on this game that will ignore you for basically nothing.
---
Yeah people are so fucking greedy on this reddit. Not like I should be surprised
---
When you see someone ninja a boe, you yourself then roll need to win the item. Then start a fair /roll for everyone in the group!
---
You are incorrect.  That was exactly how it was done in classic wow at least before BC.  Loot ethics developed over time as people better understood the system, but it settled into this long before I quit. 
---
Source:  played beta and had well over 100 days played on one of the original 6 pvp servers just between launch and AQ coming out.  So I'm not corrupted by BC and later.
---
Although it's slightly different issue since it's not a true drop and not equipable.  I remember a specific amount of drama over the Chromatic Scale for this same reason.  Need vs greed.  Everyone said it would be rolled on by everyone.  But a minority of people got butt hurt because not everyone planned to craft something.
---
&gt;That was WoW in 2004-2006.
---
Yeah, that dynamic is what made classic so "hard".  Go back and read the WoWhead comments from 2005/2006 and contrast what players say today - it's hilarious.
---
How could using gear that drops which is itemized for your class possibly be more entitled than taking away a rare item (with no guarantee that it would even be on the AH to buy) just so you could get gold.
---
That’s the epitome of greed by definition.
---
So much this! Its astonishing to me how many people cant make this simple 2 step process in their brain to understand how liquid items work. it is just a big of a gain for anyone that gets it.
---
You either ask somebody to pull with wand/gun or you body pull behind a corner. It takes some workaround but nothing drastic.
---
The good thing is that not many dungeons require LoS pulls. Strat Undead is probably one that requires the most effort on that part but you have Exorcism for that.
---
Yall are the ones who brought valuation into the equation all I said is that its worth more to a fresh 60 then it is to a geared out player with an epic and gold to spare.
---
&gt; they said they were going to release things at the same speed of original classic basically.
---
No they didn't.
---
They really weren't that dumb in the lore though, they had entire Kingdoms and shit so obviously the Ogres were pretty sophisticated before they got assfucked and split up. Just watch the Lords of War series, there's a few cultivated Ogres there
---
Point of view A: "Everyone rolling need and the winer gets to do whatever he wants". It's fair for all the players of the group. ( usually common from those players that value more minmaxing, and making the best of their time in gold/progress).
---
Point of view B: "you only need if it's an instant upgrade and if it's to sell for gold greed". Can be ninja'd, stadisticaly unbalanced since some classes/specs can roll up on more valuable BOE, also players that had invested their gold/time on gear upgrades should pass as a punish for doing so. ( usually common from those players not that tryhard and that value more the RPG, community experience and immersion the game offers).
---
Me, having "point of view A" I'm not saying your "point of view B" is wrong, I'm saying "dude we don't have to agree but my loot rules are fair for everyone while yours aren't".
---
Your attitude is why I only run with guild mates
---
Yeah, and doesn’t that also send it back instantly so you’re not stuck waiting the hour?
---
Ya the addon in question would be helpful to know.. also if you’re using the twitch app to install, make sure you are installing the proper version ie. ‘classic’ or ‘beta’
---
I literally level through dungeons so I have been in hella dungeons. Without fail the rule has been that you need on purple boes/recipes and greed on blues. This has been the etiquette in 99% if my runs. I have seen 4 epics drop(won 2) and 2 recipes(won 1).
---
If people apply the logic its an upgrade for everyone then this is the same for bop items.
---
They are also an upgrade for everyone. Its just a smaller upgrade. (&lt;5g usually). 
---
So needing bop items is okay to exchange it for gold and then a BiS item.
---
If u get stockade pauldrons its also only a part of the gold of freezing band.
---
So there is no difference between bop and boe. Leta just roll always need until the point a player has no upgrades left. Then he is only allowed to greed.
---
What do you mean "then it's not BoE"? That's how BoE looting has worked in retail for 8 years already. It can be sold if it's greeded.
---
"we only need healer and tank"
---
Group finder was here because finding a group to a dungeon during leveling when 90% of the players are at max level and everyone is divided into 3/4 continents was a fucking nightmare.
---
People should remember that every "bad decision" was made for a really valid reason
---
Now that you said it, yeah Loch Modan seems like a chill place to live.
---
The only problem with TBC was that only a very small part of a server raided. It was just too time consuming to do. It's why wrath was so much more accessible.
---
Let me guess. Something from zul'farrak? Zoomers love farming that one
---
Is this in the game yet?
---
I have no issues, being that the majority of players use common sense instead of crying on forums.....
---
I already have stance dance macros.  The issue here is that every weakaura I tried to make to alert me that a target dodged/Overpower was available to use didn't want to work outside of battle stance.
---
went to brd to farm a bit. forgot the key.
---
well, thats not so bad. i just teleport back to IF, get the key and fly back.
---
now im standing infront of the door again and it still wont open.
---
... i took the wrong key out of my bank...
---
made me log off for the day
---
No one is going to change the minds of people sitting on the other side of the table. Make loot rules clear at the onset of a dungeon run, whatever those rule may be, and stick to them.
---
Feedback made from the same people who are complaining from those changes today, too
---
Not really, most are grown up and not selfish brats that demand 400g items for themselves.
---
But... how?
---
41 Undead Mage - Where should I be getting levels? Done what I can in badlands.

It's not an attitude. It's literally how the rules of the game function. Sorry you dont like it, or that it does not fit your fantasy of how the game works.
---
WoW is full of entitled weirdos who's motives are barely discernable, that's why my long list of weirdos on Ignore keeps growing
---
Lmao, what a tool (the healer). “Blacklisted” because he couldn’t get to the last area. Don’t pay attention to this guy. Who cares about some Uldaman dungeon where the under leveled healer couldn’t get back to his body. What did he expect you all kill yourselves and slowly clear to the boss? He was the healer how are you gunna clear to him. Yeah this is stupid and if anything they should be “blacklisted” for falsely “blacklisting” others. Wtf is up with this stupid “blacklist” lol.
---
Theres LITERALLY nothing you get from that dungeon tanking.  ? So what his time is literally worthless or something

I see you're RPing as a Darnassus citizen in BfA
---
Seriously, the amount of shit Warriors on this game is unreal. If you’re trying to pre BiS grind as DPS, you’re doing it wrong.
---
Reading your comments, I really can’t tell if you are doing a bit. How you type reads like the rick and morty copy paste. Who unironcially calls someone a simpleton?
---
Dont go Zandalar if you won't respect the RP rules. Other than that, it is recommendable. Dont know about the other realm.
---
What good use could you possibly find in binding X that you can't already bind with 1-9, shift+1-9, ctrl+1-9 and alt+1-9?
---
Unrelated, but same sort of culture, seems to be a trend of not helping clothies get through the elites infront of dungeons and just waiting inside the portal like the dungeon starts there (which in Classic, it doesn't, it starts at the elites that your squishies cant charge through like your tank can). It would be especially bad in WC, but that cave is farmed so heavily at peak times its never an issue thankfully.
---
This is a nice and chill little series.
---
As for tanking advice, try pulling caster mobs back by breaking their line of sight to you (LoS pull for short). That way, you won't be fighting them right on top of the next pack. Of course, this requires your dps to wait for a bit as the mobs run to you.
---
It's where you go to preform rituals so that your drop happens in your next raid. We did for a pally friend of mine and we all ate tel'abim bananas in hopes he would get his pally T1 shoulders. Needless to say it worked.
---
He prob already had it when he won the first one too, and sent that to his alt..
---
As a tank...no, man. He has absolutely NO right, other than what his stupid party members grant him.
---
I would not make such demands, nor I would play ANYTHING with whoever made them.
---
Lfg was made because everyone was at max level and making a group during leveling was a nightmare.
---
It didn't killed interaction. On some servers you had no one to interact with in the first place

I have said this a million times. Retail is mostly trash because everyone can do everything and it's all just reskins. They call it to balance. I call it boring.
---
Is a ninja looter not an opportunist? You are taking the opportunity to make gold
---
Hence my top level comment.
---
At the end of the day it doesn't matter what you call it, you didn't get the item and I didn't get ripped off by a ninja
---
It is a "meta" that evolved on private servers.  If you are in a group of four strangers you can not trust the group to follow any sort of rules.  All rolling need is the "best worst" option, so to speak.
---
Right? Greed keeps it boe, need makes it BOP
---
Can you keep aggro off my biblioteca por favor

Just completed this quest by running and dying but getting to the inn and rezing in the room with the 2 lvl 15s. Your comment isn't accurate.

That's an option too. I didn't find it an interesting one personally, because even now at 60 (with terrible gear though) my Mana regen is only 131 per 5 seconds. With that talent maxed out at 3/3 only 15% of that continues while casting, which is 19.65 MP5. In one minute, which is much longer than a normal pull would take, that talent would give me 236 Mana, which isn't even enough for one Arcane Explosion. And it's not just those three talent points, it's also the extra talent points required to even get to that talent.
---
in fight hard modes are the greatest thing ever, i cant believe they scrapped that
---
Yea it stacks
---
And expose you to be ninjaed.
---
I just say at the beginning "cheap Boe I don't care, all greed is fine for me, but if something worth hundreds of golds drops i'll press need and I advice you do the same"
---
For pvp, i saw on YouTube videos that i just 3% of spell hit. But how if they have resistance items, would that mean that i need more spell hit?
---
Not really, they're just assholes
---
Bro how the fuck you get 60 in 5 days??? im 45 on my lock and im at 4
---
I tank tribute runs as dw fury. Need a mage tho to sheep otherwise I need to swap a shield
---
I am actually in a similar boat to you. I have solo leveled almost everything and am up to level 55 now. The guild I joined is almost never active and I am the highest level player. I, like you, am inexperienced in many things.
---
Having put a lot of thought into it I am going to look for a new guild that is active and has at least a raid team running. However, I want a guild that isn't a mass recruitment type which seems to be the only ones actively recruiting. I want more of a social group that I can remember most active members. I'll let you know how my hunt goes and let you know if I learn anything along the way. 
---
Unfortunately I am on Pagle so cant really find one for both of us.
---
thats not how feign death resists, bud. when it resists you still lay on the floor but the mobs don't get fooled. blizzard have confirmed in multiple blueposts that the spell is bugged and they're working on it
---
Really feels like the most appropriate character to ding 60 from, happy I did it.
---
I see you don't understand basic economics. oh well.
---
What’s your in-game name?
---
Stonks
---
This is one of the highest rated videos on this sub and you didnt even wait a month before reposting it. Nor did you credit the creator. Douchebag OP confirmed
---
No. While the roll system is simply tiered and can be used however the playerbase decides.... Need implies an intent to use an item yourself. Greed implies an intent to sell. No one really "needs" gold. Not from rolled loot, at least. There's plenty of it rolling around to cover the various gold sinks.
---
Either vendor or AH, the result for the winner is the same, they get gold. However, if someone actually will use it, they should get priority *over your literal greed*.  How people don't get this is beyond me. I suspect years of ninjas caused a paranoid playerbase, and perhaps rightly so. But that doesn't make it right.
---
Idgi
---
ulduar was awesome. lore, fights, gear, aesthetic, that raid had it all. 
---
of the the mmos ive played the only other raid that ever had so many things going for it was rift's hammerknell fortress, sad that game crashed and burned so hard.
---
As a Druid I really don’t want to engage against shadow priests.  Warlocks are a close second.  I feel comfortable against most anything else that is at least the same level as me.
---
I notice you write Tank warrior, are you specced protection right now?
---
I see some inexperienced players do this, even one guy in my own guild. And it's so wrong in so many ways it's difficult to explain.
---
I highly advice speccing into the "right" side of Fury talent tree. Giving more crit, More rage generation and more attackpower and later with Enrage and Flurry you will be a killing machine.
---
Arms is nice for PvP lvl 40+,  Protection is nice for tanking lvl 60+, but these are speccs at end game.
---
The only thing you need to be a tank is a sword and board and your taunt ability.
---
At first I was thinking, drunk Chromie, weird. It just kept getting better with all the references, Mankriks waifu and then Onyxia head banging was just too funny.
---
Didn't even notice that but I wouldn't put it past one of them sly bastards to find a way to be a class they got no business being.
---
Then you are a ninjalooter
---
Yea but arent the people who couldn't take the time to try to help him so they could just finish their dungeon the ones avoiding their issues?
---
dft, accuria.. some people might attend 100% and still not get those before aq
---
Im on a grindstone.
---
No shit.
---
I've been playing classic, jumped on retail after 2 months last night and didn't enjoy it at all. I feel more attached to my classic toon now, he's been on a long journey and met a lot of good people along the way, willing to help out. I actually enjoy getting to the dungeons instead of being teleported there. All my gear feels earned and not given. Cant wait for battlegrounds.
---
Point is you can't make sure he equips it. Once the item is in his bags it's over.
---
At that point you can't really make someone equip the 500 golds he just won
---
Basically, divide the current skill by 5, and that will tell you the max level of enemy your weapon skill is good for.
---
&gt;a lot of warriors are just nervous of trying and fucking up
---
That and the fact that dps players are horrible at managing aggro. It's anyoing being a tank.
---
That's fine, I can leave you be, as long as you don't scream at me because I'm not a LeEt SpElLcLeAvEr!
---
It's hilarious that people don't get this.
---
Install retail wow into a separate folder and point WMV at that.  The WMV database doesn't know how to handle side by side retail/classic installations.  Also don't have wow open when loading the DB.
---
Source: hit this exact problem last night and resolved it.
---
I wish i didn't see Princess dancing
---
I'm sorry that you aren't self aware enough to understand when you are coming off as hostile. That's your problem though, not mine.
---
He’s completely within his rights. No one is forcing people to play with tanks who reserve orbs, greens, or otherwise ask for payment. They are free to wait. Surprise surprise, however, the demand for tanks is so high and the supply so low that people will agree to this every time.
---
Source: am tank. This is how I make money on my warrior. My class doesn’t do well in pvp out in the world, and can’t AoE farm dungeons. If I’m tanking dungeons that I don’t need things from, I’m reserving all orbs if strat OR all greens otherwise.
---
And giving them the use of the item for the rest of the run, to the benefit of you all
---
WASH YER BEK
---
Warriors are the most populated class and yet they're somehow "exclusive" and get to charge fees and reserve loot. Fuck that.
---
is it actually?! I have some questions about the murloc, thrall, and vancleef animations lol
---
You inspect and ask them to equip. If they don't you just kick and put on your guild black list. 
---
There really isn't a way to prevent it other than running with your guild/friends. These just help.
---
You could still sell it, but only if you won it fair greeding it. Greed for money, Need for stats. Simple as that.
---
Opportunist*
---
so did it drop the trinket?
---
My view to your particular situation is that you could have offered up cash before the roll to be split amongst the party members or the outright winner of the roll. Boe drops are need all,  bop drops are need before greed. It’s been this way since vanilla and anyone disputing this has a small group they run with and that’s all. Go out into the community ugh.
---
If you are a good paladin player your seal doesn't have a proc chance kek
---
I use the system the majority uses. The fair system. If you don't like that, I don't know what to tell you. No one gets fucked in the runs I run. When someone accidentally greeds a BoE, we tell them to /roll and if they win, they get the item. No one gets fucked on the runs I am in and 90% of them default Need anyway, so rolling isn't even required.
---
If you feel "fucked" over because a BoE drops and no one wants to GIVE you 400g, whether you would "wear it immediately" or not, no one cares what you think. The group earned that drop, and they can all use it to sell and buy THEIR BoEs that they need. You aren't entitled to BoEs, get over it or be in the small minority crying over spilled milk. No one really cares and it's no big loss either way.
---
this post by you implies you had no idea how feign is supposed to resist. thought i'd educate you. have a nice day :)
---
Why so serious? I'm sharing a spontaneous and fun occurrence from my Classic adventures.
---
Ahhh alright.
---
war orphans ain't gonna fund my epic mount.
---
Multiple chat bars?
---
400g dropped, in the form of a staff.
---
It could've been krol blade, or stockade pauldrons. 
---
A Boe is golds. If you want it that much but it from the winner.
---
Concussive shot and pet stun tho tho
---
I hear ya brother. Retail elitists and in some cases even classic elitists think everyone else is below them. 
---
I am an old head I guess, but I even get triggered when I see people reserve gear. That's not acceptable to me.. like ever.
---
&gt;other than what his stupid party members grant him 
---
If he's up front about reserving and people still join then they did grant this right. There's other reasons to go to Strat than the orbs. No need to get self righteous and insult people for that.
---
When some like an epic, travelers pack drop i'll just tell everyone to need its not really fair if someone takes something thats worth 50-200g
---
I did a raid once in wotlk with a Brazilian guild using Google translate. I explained what I was doing, asked them if I was making any sense, and they were like "eh we can get the meaning". It's not great, but it works.
---
So instead of using a fair system where everyone can benefit, you would kick and blacklist the majority that have been following the community rules for 15 years. Cool. I don't think anyone cares and you would be doing them a favor by blacklisting them so they don't have to group with you either. Keep doing god's work.
---
Evidence to the contrary. I 100% have never seen a troll rogue, and I have only ever fought maybe a handful of orc rogues.
---
That's fixed in classic
---
I farmed most of my Pre-BiS before hitting 60 (DM came out when I was 55), so now I'm basically done with the game until my guild starts MC next month. Got enough consumables to last me three raids, and I don't feel like farming gold for the epic mount yet. 
---
Since our tank is like 4/8 T1 already, I feel like my guild is going to survive MC without me having the Black Baron cape or a second Elven ring from Tribute Runs.
---
Tunic.  Weapon dps doesn't matter at all for ferals, only thing that matters are stats.
---
Bloodfang is very nice and balanced between factions.
---
Nice1
---
i didn’t get the item cause i rolled greed and you rolled need cause you stole it. so yes at the end of the day i can call it that
---
Try reading the entire thread.
---
After reading your replies to posts, are you alright man? Maybe seek some counseling, all that hate is going to lead to some serious health issues down the road.
---
What dots/Debuffs are supposed to be used on a raid boss? As far as i know as a lock i shouldn't use Coa/Corruption because of other Dots but my raid group with 4 locks had no problem doing all of MC having us all use corruption and me (being the one with the most gear) use CoA while the others put CoS and CoE, etc.
---
In my opinion there is more than enough space for Warlocks to use their dots, what are we doing wrong? This is my first time raiding in Classic btw, what would be the essencial 16 dots/debuffs on a boss?
---
El güarlock
---
I mean as long as it’s 1 that’s all they need
---
When I see someone announce they are doing master loot I assume it means items are going priority to their guild members and I might be allowed to roll on an item if they dont need it or want to shard it.
---
They are just missing the mana regen from tbc which makes them bad for long raid fights but they are great tanks.
---
They are also far less likely to be dungeon tank pre-Madonnas like warriors.  At least on my Priest and Mage I'm far happier seeing a prot pally is the tank when I join a dungeon group.
---
Hi, /u/RandomGreekPerson

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dko20a/gadgetzangot_so_many_people_killed/). 
---
I’d go for the tunic (unless you get blackened defias armor on the run).
---
You should be able to have zero downtime as a Druid without much spirit.
---
When you get 20 whispers a day asking to come tank things, you too can reserve items on your runs.
---
Please explain to me what you think the term ninja means
---
Now is the time to join! It’s still phase 1 so there is plenty of time to get to max level.
---
These are useful, thanks. My only difference is I actually put 2 fear spells on my hotbars instead of relying on a macro. That way I can easily swap them out with other ranks if needed.
---
You are the minority on my server. I have never seen anyone use your system in game in 15 years.
---
andorhal
---
get a blacklist going, not sure why more and more people dont just name and shame, take a screen shot and post it for all to see
---
but in your comment you said it can resist like any other ability.... did you watch the clip??
---
sweety just accept that you were wrong!
---
And, honestly, they're doing you a favour by ignoring you.
---
They are outing themeslves as complete idiots and saving you the trouble of finding out the hard way at some later date.
---
Has anyone levelled a rogue as  anything other than combat? I rolled sub after getting the 40% crit chance in assassination, and have rolled a dagger ambush build, that by lvl 30, has a 90% crit chance on ambush for solo levelling if used within 20 seconds of a kill and its a blast jumping between mobs. Does this slow down any time later game, and should I look at respec into combat for 40-60?
---
Any advice from anyone else avoiding the cookie cutter sword build would be helpful!
---
I spec in Arms right now just so I could level up easier but I'll consider protection when I'm lvl 60 since I'm so inexperienced for those end game raids
---
"it's harder more realistic" is using addons I bet you use questie as well. Guess your points are only for show.
---
I think herb/mining will be the most profit (with herbs better than mining).
---
Most items will be better to vendor than disenchant.
---
Im a 60 SM/Ruin Lock. What's better-- Shroud of the Nathrezim, Kentic Amice, or Deadwalker Mantle? I have SotN equipped at the moment as the crit feels pretty powerful but I'm curious what ya'll have to say.
---
Haven't heard anything, I just ended up taming King Bangalash and I'm careful to put a trash pet to see if I end up triggering it again
---
Good luck to you in your search !
---
That's quite an eloquent solution.
---
Let's see how you feel about this when **you** make the whole group roll greed and one guy doesn't give a shit and needs that 400g item. You will want to find a system that prevents this from happening in the first place. Everyone needing DOES achieve this. Either only run with people you trust, or you accept the fact that you can get betrayed, but nobody cares if you ignore that guy or yell out his name in /2, the people will NOT remember that name.
---
A little while ago I was on the other side of the argument, but people convinced me with good arguments. Unfortunately it also took me getting ninja'd for me to understand clearly.
---
Assuming it's available....
---
It works in the room with the two lvl15’s?  Sweet.  I’ll give it another go!
---
This for some reason just makes me so happy
---
Of you want that type of gear distribution,  you have two clear options:
---
i) start a group and clearly state the loot rules at the beginning after forming
---
ii) run exclusively with your guild/friends who agree to these rules. 
---
Outside of that you are merely the vocal minority attempting to sway others to your view while ignoring the plethora of facts showing why need all is th optimal method in any other situation.
---
You lil fuckin shit lol
---
Catch me no regrets needing against him on every orb.
---
Fuck him. His role doesn't grant him special privileges. They're a gold maker for everyone. This isn't a item that only benefits one class or profession.
---
I've yet to see anyone equip any boe regardless of rarity. It's always been ninja looted. I'm rolling need on boe items above level 50.
---
A guy was asking for mageweave stacks on my server yesterday, CoD. I mailed him 2 stacked for 1.6g and went on with my business.
---
A few hours later I have mail, a note with 1.6g and a message saying "you sent me 1.6g instead of CoD, heres your gold back. What a guy.
---
&gt; Personally I would probably give retail more of a shot if they got rid of cross server stuff. Bring back the sense of community, bring back professions meaning something, skill trees etc.
---
I don't mind the cross server stuff, it is just that you cannot group with most people you meet in dungeons. Blizzard is already there with their cross server tech, just need to extend it so that you can group up with the same people in the rest of the world, and invite them to their guild. The idea of a server should be a thing of a past and really only exist for technical reasons (e.g. place all players on a server that minimizes latency for the entire group).
---
It's clearly a bot, and I've seen other bots on that same loop from the OP.
---
One of the clearest ways you can tell is in their movement.  Bad bots will move in short straight lines then instantly pop into the new direction they want to face.  It's because they follow a waypoint system, which is just a list of coordinates they follow in a loop.  The bot aims straight at one waypoint and moves forward until it arrives, then turns to the next waypoint and continues.
---
If you ever follow a bot you'll see how jilted and unnatural it looks.  Player movement is much more fluid.
---
That's actually a fair point! But I do think the net benefit of that is small compared to the total weight of the decision.
---
I don't remember it being that much of a problem in the old days. Did new people just don't learn how the Greed/Need system works? 
---
Or is it that people just didn't care so freaking much about Gold when WoW came out. Are gear, specs, game mechanics, guildies etc. just not that important anymore because most have seen anything (by themselves or through Streams)?
---
Thinking about people's motivation a lot. Something just seems off. Like most of the players just want to put it behind them and then jump on another hype train.
---
Yep, total overreaction.
---
it is.
---
but, in an ideal world, we wouldn't have to Need on BoEs if we wanted to sell them. 
---
unfortunately, the community dun fucked itself wit hit's greed. i'd let someone take an epic BoE to equip, but, everyone being a giant asshat means you pretty much have to Need.
---
People's unwillingness to go to the goblin AHs have made my hundreds of gold.
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
The rule exists with the words "bind on equip" lol. I am sorry that you disagree with a free economy game, but that's the way BoEs work.
---
I hate pvp servers and would love nothing more than to transfer off one, but my friends all chose a PvP server. So just anytime there is World PvP is want to quit the game. It is actually the least fun you can have. I don't care for any arguments or discussions about it, I hate World PvP and that is all there is to it. People telling me troll rogues exist is bullshit, because they simply don't.
---
Boomers would never say that. That's a zoomer thing to say. They were the ones raised on the overly pc internet that have no balls.
---
True, but I doubt there are very many situations where someone couldn't use money to buy them some sort of significant upgrade.
---
Roll greed so someone can use a twink bis weapon for two levels and replace it with bis? No thanks. Run dungeons with your raid if you want to control loot.
---
&gt; Agreed. That and the DE button to stop “needing items for DE”.
---
No. I always hated this in Retail. Why should you be able to use my profession skills without asking? If you want someone to DE for your group you can negotiate that service.
---
I've been playing the AHs on Grobb and there's for sure a lot of competition and undercutting everywhere. I've had to abandon some of my plays because they aren't worth it anymore.
---
He teleported to orgrimmar right after. I learned that his first 'yah' was to me saying 'hey', not to my question :P
---
Then I am happy for you. You get to play with people that think like you. Again though, your system is objectively terrible and opens you up to ninja looters, intentional or unintentional. It makes no sense to make room for ninja looters to take stuff. Would you run MC without ML on and trust everyone not to steal shit? I wouldn't and neither would anyone else leading an MC run. While ML is ridiculous for regular dungeons, the same idea still applies with the need/greed system, if everyone needs on it, then no one can ninja it.
---
Use whatever system you are comfortable with and if your server actually follows different rules, then obey them, but know that your system is objectively worse because it allows for ninjas to take advantage of it. You can not care, that is totally fine, but you can't honestly believe it's a better system.
---
To take loot that someone else might use for your own greed. If someone in the party would have needed it and worn it, the loot is rightfully theirs. You have ninja'd it.
---
Great, thanks!
---
Blessing of freedom &lt;4
---
lol,wtf
---
Never had this problem either as bear tank who has never done any of the 50+ dungeons before. I would tell the group straight up when I join that I never done it before and to let me know path/tricky pulls. All groups I’ve been in have been nice about it and never got insulted.
---
Don’t let one or two bad groups define your experience. Most people are nice if you just be honest. If they’re not as nice, screw them and carry on.
---
Yea I did the same mistake after watching YouTube and some bad streamers.
---
Fury is so much better for Solo leveling and Group play as well as tanking.
---
Arms just give you passive effects like bleed etc.
---
Fury gives you atk speed, atkpower, 25% dmg increase, More rage, More crits so you again get more rage from those crits.
---
Cause he can go to the ah and BUY the damn axe. It's not bop.
---
BoPs are worth a lot for those who can use them, and close to worthless to those who can't.
---
BoEs have the same exact value for everyone in the group.
---
Elemental Mage staff drops.
---
A warrior can sell it and buy Edgemasters.
---
A priest can sell it and buy Cassandra's and craft the epic tailoring robe.
---
And so on
---
While if Rod of the Ogre Magi drops the mage can use it for a good upgrade, while other classes can vendor it for 6g so about 10 mins of farming.
---
Can you see the difference?
---
No one can be a ninjalooter if the norm is to need a high value BoE. The reason why this makes sense has been stated numerous time in this post. If you get ninjalooted once by someone you trusted, you will understand, friend.
---
I was using the exact macro you posted (reset=1) but I have not tried 0.5. It worked fine most of the time but every once in a while I would strafe while the macro was active and it completely bugged it. Couldn’t start shooting my wand again until I used the general spell “shoot” from the spell book. After using shoot the macro would start working again. I’ll test further for sure, thank you.
---
I hit 60 last night turning into Chromie as well! Didn't plan it that way but now that I think about it, it was a highly appropriate way to mark that milestone!
---
If a freezing band drops and we have a mage that can use it, he can need and save himself 450g sure, but anybody else in the group could also use that 450g on buying a boe or mats that they need if they press need on it.
---
Needing on a BoE just because you can use it and ignoring that everybody else can use the gold as much as you is by definition greedy. You're saying that the gold is more valuable to you than it is to anyone else in the party. 
---
These debates are logical fallacies.
---
All this is ignoring the prisoner's dilemma whereby greeding you are enabling ninja looters.
---

&gt;Only real issue he could bitch about is that his didn't even go off. But he's probably on a potato and doesn't know what latency is. I have never once seen what happened to him. Certainly not game breaking.

---
TBC is the original Classic+. It's obviously where they were going considering the huge amount of effort they put into Outland even pre-vanilla release. All of these vaguely defined ideas like Dragon Isles are inferior concepts that were scrapped and discontinued for a reason. 
---
I really don't understand how people think classic can keep going without a 'reset' at some point (whether an expansion with a raised level cap or not) - even in actual vanilla they added catch up items to dungeons that equaled or surpassed MC loot as the game went on, because it became a pain to have to gear up people in raids that people had done to death already and that seasoned raiders needed nothing from. Imagine how much worse it would be with 3-4 raid tiers after Naxx.
---
And the idea of 'sidegrades' and horizontal progression is a pipe dream. If content isn't rewarding, the majority of people don't do it, especially not many times. Sadly, people are motivated by loot and character progression, not interesting or novel encounters and content.
---
It would be cool with a TBC+ classic that avoided some of TBC's weaknesses like dailies, flying mounts and the terrible story, but overall standard TBC classic is by far the safest choice.
---

---
I've been selling transmits arcanite recipes for 8-10g. They're 5g in gadget. Unlimited.
---
I think either system would be fair if everyone agreed on which one they're using before the BoE drops. Obviously from how much this is talked about plenty of people prefer "need before greed" and plenty of people prefer "all need".
---
Also both systems have the potential to be equally selfish if you only start discussing it after you see the item.
---
No, he wants to play around in a spreadsheet to theorize outputs but does not want to build the database for such a spreadsheet to function. 
---
I imagine you cant see this as an option because you have never done this sort of spreadsheeting yourself; I would urge you to do so.
---
“imagine for a second that the gear bosses dropped wasnt bop but instead boe.“
---
This alone just demolished any argument they could say.
---
They all greedy as fuck and just wrong
---
You don't understand what "Need" and "Greed" means.
---
No one should change your mind! Fuck these meeeeeeemes!

---
When you enter Stratholme live side, there's a signpost with south labeled as "Stranglethorn vale". Considering Strat and STV are on the opposite ends of the continent, I assume it was a joke from the devs?
---
That is absolutely wrong.
---
BoE items represent an upgrade for everyone, because BoE items can be traded for upgrades.
---
And anyone claiming they "need" the item is much more likely to just sell it for gold on the AH anyway.  The only fair way to handle BoE loot is for *everyone* to roll need, and then the winning party can decide what they want to do with the item.
---
This isn't rocket science.
---
Are you kidding me?!?

However I don't mind people who need on BoEs, I usually advice my party members to do so before starting, because sure as hell I will.
---
And if a good Boe I can use drops I don't mind them needing either.
---
Yes, the amount of gold being injected into the economy needs to first outweigh gold sinks like repairs, water/food, etc. then it depends on how heavily the gold in the economy is being inflated. I think you also overestimate how many players can effectively solo DM Tribute, its pretty difficult and takes most hunters ~10 hours of repeatedly dying to learn it. Generally only a select few players do this and it pales in comparison to the gold that gets injected into the economy by gold farmers and mages.
---
&gt; "ALL NEED" since it's the only way to counter a ninja roll.
---
This is one of the big reasons why everyone should need, anyway.
---
Plus, players can trade that item for an upgrade, so every class *really does* need that item -- because it represents an upgrade for everybody.
---
Comparing being ahead of everyone else and having layering to being in a pack without layering, obviously is going to be easier. OP obviously didn’t experience that and someone that was in that pack compared to now, it’s smoother. Also, maybe tanaris is the log jam since I specifically referenced 1-40. But cool flex.
---
&gt; Needing on a BoE just because you can use it and ignoring that everybody else can use the gold as much as you is by definition greedy. You're saying that the gold is more valuable to you than it is to anyone else in the party. 
---
So essentially you’re in favor of rolling for AH spec. That’s fine, and I hope that is clear to all groups you’re in. 
---
I’m simply noting that now that I’m aware of this perspective, I’ll be posting loot rules in my pugs that expressly rule out this behavior.
---
WeakAuras or some other addon for Overpower notifications.
---
So what if I roll need on BOP purples to vendor for 10g 
---
It all adds up and will eventually fund my AH BoE BiS
---
Because you laughed and enjoyed it?
---
The shaman is going to be your tank. He's a high-threat, low-mitigation tank, which means things need to die once he gets some threat on them. Basically, shammies turn mana into threat.
---
Given you have a pocket tank and you dont need to slow and kite things, I'd go fire. It's more damage and IMO setting things on fire is just more fun.
---
Remember the interaction between polymorph and searing totems, and sheep early and at the correct range :)
---
Kinda depends on what your playing @19
---
No, that domain name is around 2$
---
Then we just find another [whatever it was you were].
---
That’s hilarious! I love it! I’m posting this to my guild discord hahaha
---
"Might use"
---
Think about this term more carefully. 
---
Then think about if an epic BoE drops while you're solo. It's something your class can use, does that mean you automatically equip it, or do you contemplate selling it as gold is sometimes more useful than a singular item.
---
So why should someone who is only lucky be able to pay claim over an item they "Might use"?
---
An expensive BoE is gold. It's not an item. You can't force everyone to greed roll, so everyone need rolls. Simple.
---
Hunter isn't that great for new players either imo. Past sending pet in and auto shooting it gets quite complicated. Also, pet food and arrows are reasonably punishing and expensive and the pet training system is quite complicated without a guide.
---
i also dont get it .. i play druid and i tank and heal  ... 2 tank classes should be more then enough so there should be no tank deficit.
---
its pretty nice when you log in and get a ton of messages if you can heal/tank a ini :)
---
I mean, she _is_ still glaring at you.
---
It boggles my mind that suggesting everybody roll and have a fair chance at something that is basically a cash-drop, that most will never see in their entire wow experience, is greedy and that whinging and whining about not getting some ridiculous unecessary epic piece of fantasy gear is the right thing to do.
---
Then there's no difference from them just greeding it
---
Remember when they were going to allow loot trading and yall went. Naaaaah.
---
And we went....oh fuck.... really?
---
And now here we are.
---
God i missed classic
---
Goddamn hunters! As a mage, I poly them, deal with their pet, usually they unpoly before pet is dead, then they just back up and jump while firing, and even slowed, they just take me out... damn tauren hunters
---
This is a good way to look at it.
---
I actually thought that dance looks better on humans than orcs, he was killing it
---
Yup, lost Skullflame, won flask of supreme power recipe.
---
It balances out
---
.
---
It had issues and flaws, not unlike Classic. But it excelled in its own ways that made it unique, much like Classic.
---
Fucking justice
---
That is not the norm no matter how many people in this thread say it is. I've been playing this game since release.
---
Go ahead and no one will want to group with you. There's no set in stone loot options, if you don't want to group with people that roll need on purple BOEs then do that. Otherwise say bye bye to it when you roll greed.
---
The prices are going to go down and then eventually up. I got a kang on week one and have been holding onto it as no one would pay for it.
---
Lmao
---
Except the people who actually, you know...NEED the item. 
---
Instead of being GREEDy.
---
At least credit the person who made it.. https://youtu.be/Y9EKzvTo3g0
---
I read somewhere that it was next to the weaponsmith but didn't see it anywhere around there. Do you mean way west?
---
Would use, then. You make the person equip it immediately. That's the standard and has been forever, not this everybody need bullshit
---
And so, it's a small QoL that is easy to implement.
---
There is a book in steamweedle port you need to use to "lose" your gnomish specialization.
---
Make sure you aren't moving and let go of mouse when using it. I've found this makes it more reliable as right click on mouse can break it.
---
That looks insane.
---
Don’t make anymore lol.
---
Its great how classic brought all the trash back into the game willing to justify shitty behavior like this.
---
The one with the alliance NPCs in it? That could work I guess, hopefully I can take those mobs
---
Of course needing on BoP items makes you a prick, because those items sell for pitiful gold, aren't rare, and are predestined to drop from that dungeon, and thus people run that dungeon specifically for that item. People don't run UBRS because Elemental Mage Staff drops on a 0.001% loot table. And the Mage in your group isn't the one who got lucky when the Elemental Mage Staff dropped. That was a 10 man effort to clear through that dungeon, and the Elemental Mage Staff is far more represented by the 500g it sells for. 
---
Your Mage may have had to have purchased that in the future for his pre-raid BiS. His roll is to save him 500g on that item. Your roll is to save you 500g on _your_ pre-raid BiS item by being able to sell said Elemental Mage Staff. They both have completely equal value to both players, and the Mage being basically given 500g for free for what boiled down group effort and a group reward simply makes no sense.
---
I didn't plan it either, was questing in Eastern Plaguelands and found the little ghost girl that sent me to her aunt in WP, and then to give a weeding ring to Chromie and then I thought it was the perfect way to ding. But to be fair I had to kill like 10 ghouls outside Chromie's house to guarantee the ding.
---
Eh, there’s greedy people and slightly less greedy people. Some will argue for your point and some will argue against. 
---
If the person in the group can use it, and equips it in party then it should be theirs. Let the RNG decide (if any) who will be the lucky person that can use it. 
---
You guys simply don’t like that option. It’s up to the group leader to make it clear. And you could always agree/bitch to them if you don’t like it I guess
---
There is no loot in strat live for tanks really. Gl getting a tank tho
---
Except you totally can roll on healers clothes it'll just piss people off and you won't get a group anymore. The best you can do now is not group with the people who all rolled need but good luck, not gonna happen again. Just hope you get the next boe and sell it and buy your boe.
---
There's no set in stone loot rules and blizzard has acknowledged that. If you think you need +healing gear as a rogue there is nothing that Blizzard will do about that.
---
As a 57 healer stepping in to the core for the first time in over a decade, hope we get that bitch tonight.
---
Hope so. Got a pair for 40g on short bid.
---
I’d argue that Cata dungeons were actually less linear than Wrath and even BC. Throne of the tides, Tol’Vir, and Halls of Origination all had some nonlinearity to it. HoO could be my favorite dungeon post-BC, even if the expansion did suck.
---
It's completely fair/normal behavior.
---
You know what's really shitty behavior?
---
Claiming that you "need" an item more than other people, when they can use it just as well as you can.
---
That's totally shitty, dude.
---
BoE's can be traded.  That means it's an upgrade for everyone.  Stop being a greedy asshole.
---
Everybody in that dungeon run earned that loot, and if everyone can use it equally well, then everybody deserves to roll for it.
---
Straight up wall hack lmao
---
Grats, but... By the way, what's name of minimap addon? :D
---
Two wrongs don’t make a right friend
---
thats something i rly wonder .. since warrior is the most played class  and druid can also tank.
---
I am very okay with rage pulling before I'm ported out and laughing as I soul stone rez.
---
Gonna just spam, "Haha, you're in danger" as I wait for the timer to tick down.
---
Y'all are taking the phrase Need too literally.  
---
People roll Need on boe epics for one single reason: people can not be trusted. There's no getting it back if someone ninjas it.
---
Gnome has a hidden racial of inducing humiliation and rage from anyone you kill.
---
Am paladin, holy spec. You've stated what pvp is for me. 
---
If they're low I will holy shock, hodge, judgement, consecrate and hope they die.
---
If they are full and engage me I will bubble and hearth. 
---
My other abilities are heals, buffs, undead stuff and misc seals. That's about it.
---
theres tons of quests for brd that require you to go to tons of different areas of the dungeon. thats reason to run the whole thing
---
Play horde. 2H warrior. Windfury. ??? Profit.
---
O.O
---
*goes and disables trade*
---
Wouldn’t really call taunt an oh shit button. 99% of groups I tank will have DPS opening up right away on multiple different targets regardless of whether or not I mark. I find myself hitting taunt every 10-15 seconds anyway. It costs nothing and unless it resists it ensures the enemy stays focused on you.
---
After multiple lessons (group greeding then ninja needs) throughout the years, I strictly do all need BoE since Classic came out. Zero drama and even had people who never played WoW with this rolling system compliment the idea of a 100% fair, equal chance at sellable or tradable blues/purps.
---
It's crazy to me that there's still people as naive as the poster above you.
---
Because you need a tank. Every group does. You can run 3 rogues, a healer and a tank, or 3 hunters, a healer and a tank, or whatever other combination, but you need a tank. Theres nothing for warriors in that dungeon, theres no reason for them to go, so they guarantee themselves gold.
---
I liked it
---
Yeah but this is different. He died and made it back to the dungeon and it reset mobs. Then they expect everyone to either clear to him or die and work there way back to the last boss room.
---
As a tank I need before greed on any gear. That being said. I usually get the gear  (ง ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)ง
---
I just misclicked posted early, so I apologize.  
---
Hey so I decided to take a peak at this spreadsheet and run some numbers. And some of these things make no sense... I inputted my personal gear and ticked off every buff. So unbuffed ingame I have 864 AP, on this spreadsheet it claims I have 1039. That is quite a large margin off. This sheet seems extremely goofy, there are things that don't make sense and some of it looks like it comes down to rounding errors. As in the crit chance is only off by .25 which I will say its accounting for wep skill probably not being added to crit chance.  
---
This spreadsheet shows that if I take the enchant off of my bracers (+9 str) my proc rate of hoj goes down by .4 and if I put it back on my proc rate goes up. Please can you explain how HoJ proc rate is affected by a 9str enchant... This spreadsheet is so full of weird flaws that there is no way it is giving an accurate representation of stats or dps amounts.  
---
Like its probably fine as a rough estimation of potential damage, but I have logs of me doing more dps than this shows that I could do total... As my spec with my gear I outdps what this spreadsheet says by about 20-25%.
---
Someone that babyrages and wipes a group is 100 times worse than some that reserves items and is up front about it.
---
As a miner that has hit around 150 thorium veins and seen exactly 0 gems of any type, these posts are getting very old.
---
Fury, you don’t go Arms (Mortal strike/debuff priority)
---
When I'm going tanking in an instance for my 30th+ run for a single bop drop that simply hasn't come my way, I'm reserving it.
---
But yeah, anyone who reserves BOE's for money is just a dick.
---
Then you’re gonna have to make a decision as to what is more important. DPS meters or playing something you enjoy. Quite honestly in classic if you care about meters, there are like three classes to play. So you’re kinda stuck on options.
---
Way to crush the spirits of every DPS warrior / Hunter looking to get this :P
---
I just don't understandhaving to ninja. Like max you get 500g for an item which you could farm in like a week of dedication with all the guides out there now. It's just not worth tarnishing your reputation permanently in a community based game.
---
OP complaining my bad.  The point stands.
---
Yeah, that was what killed WoW for me, personally. I enjoyed figuring out if 1% dodge was better than 2% block, swapping out gear for different situations. Then the stats were greatly simplified, and then later in wrath it was all about maximizing EH. Gear choices became very one dimensional.
---
I enjoyed the RNG of getting a few dodges in a row or an unlucky series. It kept things exciting. If I was gearing for mitigation and not EH, I knew the risk I was taking, and balancing that risk was a huge part of being a good tank.
---
I haven't tried in Classic but in Vanilla there was also a small spot you could initiate a duel in front of IF bank.
---
It would still say Help from their pov
---
I just refuse to tank for them anymore.
---
It works wonders, nobody chooses random rogue #45 over a tank when lfg.
---
They kicked all of the players off the World of Warcraft and sent them to Orc Hell instead. Then they sent them all to the North Pole. Suddenly, they looked back at all those poor levelers still stuck in the World of Warcraft all alone because everyone was at the North Pole instead.
---
So they went back, decided the next expansion would be back in the World of Warcraft, but only made half an expansion for it. But for 1-60, they made it go by stupidly fast solo (Because nobody was around) and braindead (Fly the bomber! Kill hundreds in minutes! And they pushed for "Play the patch, not the Expansion", rendering everything before not merely level cap, but the current raid tier's content completely worthless.
---
Then in MoP, they gave players still leveling the ultimate middle finger with the new Talent System, leaving the vast majority of levels as 'dead' levels. Cata kinda started this, but they avoided dead levels and kept new abilities coming at a decent pace. Then Legion discovered Level Scaling, and implemented the worst version of it in any MMO.
---
The interaction with other players disappeared because they focused way too hard on pushing everyone to catch up with the highest band of players, instead of leaving any natural stratification. And, when you have too many people in one place, everyone retreats into themselves (MONKEYSPHERE EXCEEDED).
---
And the playerbase gets really hostile when it comes to dealing with people behind them - No more exploring dungeons. Blaze them. No room for undergeared people - there are plenty better than them. Too many players you're disposable and interchangeable. Too few and you're all alone.
---
I really, really don't get why they insist on having the item level double between launch and Xpac end.
---
If the intention was for BoE to always be needed -- you would never have a reason to trigger a choice of roll in the first place and you might as well treat it like normal round robin loot .
---
However since the need greed system is triggered for them -- it should be the intent of the rules which is greed for money need for stats.
---
If your a slacker, GL on getting into raids with a attitude like that.
---
r/cringe
---
Agreed about Wow 2. Retail now is an absolute clusterfuck of countless systems and ideas piled on top of each other. There’s so much item/mount/gear bloat that basically everything in the game has lost all value.
---
They need to completely start fresh. Take everyone back to level 1 and remake the entire thing. 7 expansions is way too many to stack on top of one game
---
I don't really have reservations about being ultra petty to people who abuse their role to get extra perks. Fuck them.
---
time is money, you can get rekked and farm your own gold for BIS - no one NEEDS that ring.
---
I actually do think its a better system for dungeons. Not because it protects you but because it builds a better community when it is enforced. People are focused on helping each other out by letting people who need the item for gear need it. You learn who the people you can't trust are and who you don't want to play with are for a 3-5g blue item and can even determine what guilds are good and bad based off that.
---
This may sound like retarded advice but the best solution is to not have a 2nd phase.
---
No.  Everyone can sell bop gear and use he cash for an ug.  Your logic sucks.
---
Same here, have plated since vanilla, and all-needing has been the norm the entire time I have played. The first time I heard of this "only need if you can equip" was on reddit after classic launched. Thankfully my server follows the non-greedy method of all-needing.
---
Not really I used to be instead I now have a rogue main working toward 60 focusing on mastering the class.  I have an AH disenchant alt.
---
Im 15/31/5 with lethality/AR. my +16 daggers is from Corehound Gloves + distracting dagger and talents. 
---
Just got Perditions blade and easily hitting #1 raid dps, I sit around 32-33% crit during raids with Gear + Mongoose + Feral 3% crit buff.
---
Fail.
---
You *completely ignored* the fact that BoE's can be traded for an equal upgrade.
---
Epic BoE Plate Helm?   Rogue can trade that for an Epic BoE Sword.
---
**Nobody "needs" a BoE more than anyone else.**
---
Stop being a greedy asshole.
---
The issue is even in classic most people don't give a shit about guild blacklists. It is made even worse because half of your guild will probably agree with the sentiment of valuable BoEs being a need for everyone.
---
Glad I didn't roll a priest
---
Pretty much agreed. If SoJ drops everyone better need. But when leveling with my friend some junk blue mace dropped that was an improvement for him and someone got salty that he needed on it. It was worth a few gold at most. Like that’s just ridiculous to me, it totally depends on what the actual item is and what it’s worth. I ended up winning the re-roll and had him keep it, and he equipped it right away. Not all BOE’s are equal.
---
It's an interesting take on how degenerate the wow community has become. Instead of getting rid of the filth you become filth yourself.
---
&gt;Unrelated
---
Yea but this is different.
---
this. I dont understand the logic behind some of these comments. Go farm gold and buy your BIS then, NO ONE ever NEEDS these items - they game can be played without BIS and you will still clear raids.
---
Oh that's easy. 
---
If you delete an item like the sceptre, all you have to do is delete your character and start over from lvl 1 to get it back. Should only take a couple of weeks if you haven't gotten a lot of end game gear yet.
---
And combined with the broken English title and sketchy farmer account I say it’s likely OP is a spam account.
---
I don't know what helicopters you've seen man but I think you're thinking of a mirror
---
Thanks for defending a likely future spam/resale account.
---
The rest of us don’t enjoy getting sent spam as much as you apparently do.
---
It takes 2 hrs of your time at your leisure to research good items for your character at lv60. I don’t really know what happened but I’m guessing you are hybrid rolling on everything?
---
That's awesome T_T
---
If Edgemasters handguards ever drop when I'm tanking a dungeon and some mage ninja loots it to sell on the AH I'm Alt F4ing and taking a vacation.
---
This, in a single post, is the attitude that brought us "Bring the player, not the class".
---
Yeah, because 2g vendor price is TOTALLY the same thing as a 400g epic BoE. Get real
---
Welcome to the true classic experience!
---
As for the first part, I can see for myself if I can reproduce the same kind of error tomorrow. What you can do is check that the talents are correct, and make sure all the buffs and cooldown usage check boxes are ticked accurately. Another thing is to check the stats the spreadsheet has for the items you're using to see if the error lies there.
---
The HoJ part might be because you're looking at the number that represents the dps value of the HoJ proc, which should change when you equip or unequip gear. The proc rate itself is only listed under a different page.
---
And finally it obviously is patchwerk simulation. I haven't noticed anything majorly off in it, but as I said I'll come back to it tomorrow.
---
Totally agree, BC really refined vanilla
---
AKA Greed.
---
Hey its me again!
---
Im using the macro you gave me for the regrowth, however, i cannot get my shift modifier to work...AT ALL.
---
I made the macro, it shows me my downrank when i press shift, however, when i hold shift and press my hotkey (Num 1) it doesnt work...nothing happens.
---
However, when I normally press my hotkey, NO modifier (Num 1), it correctly casts the high rank of Regrowth.
---
Can i maybe get some help troubleshooting lol?
---
I completely disagree, this video makes me very unhappy
---
If you actually do the maths the statistically unbalanced argument really doesn't hold. The chances of a boe epic dropping is so low that the average gold per run from boe epics is very low even if the value of the drop is high.
---
If I need on BOE I make a point of immediately equipping it.
---
Again. Super fucking naive. And operating under the mistaken and quite frankly, moronic assumption that all BoE gear has the same price.
---
What about playing a 2hnd dps and using nightfall in raids?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall
---
IMHO make needed items soulbound.
---
It is known. 
---
Mos Eisley ain’t got nothing on this wretched hive of scum and villainy.
---
Still undecided and need more input... I can't decide between hunter and druid, for an easy leveling experience (as I won't have as much time to play as I thought). Can anybody give some insight to sway me one way or the other?
---
You can definitely establish general loot rules beforehand, yes.
---
According to sixtyupgrades.com, for resto druid stats have next weights:  
---
Heal - 1  
---
Int - 0.3  
---
Spirit - 0.46  
---
MP5 - 3  
---
1% Crit - 10.  
---
So Eyepatch of Healing beat +20 Int, +11 Spirit with giant distance.
---
It has nothing to do with what I think is right. It's called etiquette and after 15 years people should know about it. They did when WoW came out you know. 
---
You're just encouraging bad behavior and justifying ninja looting. Everytime somebody doesn't know about your self-made need-everything rule somebody is ninjaing stuff. At least if nobody actually needs it. 
---
I'm with you on stating loot rules. Maybe you should share that idea with the raid or group leader before needing everything BoE.
---
Uld is 43+, but running dungeons isnt the best way. That can get monotonous and boring. But you need a to find a zone, and quest to get in a groove. Finish out STV, Start Badlands, Duskwallow? I reccomend questie as an addon to find out the zone to hit. You want quests at your level to make it smooth.
---
Who was heavily inspired by Manndarinchik https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbn-QDttWqU
---
(Personally I prefer Pints version though)
---
Are you in full cloth with 0 stamina? Feral Druids don't hit that hard and Balance Spells have huge windup. Druids are known for having quite possibly the slowest time-to-kill of any class.
---
This is this most important point. 
---
For me the day they said “paladins can pummel now” game was over. Paladin was meant to be a support class with rng bombs, and not meant to be agressivsly strong against casters, but defensively strong with dispels etc. 
---
As soon as you say you give them a pummel... I quit. 
---
Ps:I main paladin.
---
I think all need for BoE purples is fine in a dungeon. The group should talk about it though.
---
It’ll be master loot.
---
&gt;because its hard enough to get the item to drop. thats 1 layer of insane rng you have to beat. then you have to win rolls vs people who cant even use it?
---
But we are saying you can also roll on BoE items that you can't use... so if you win a roll on one of those, you can sell it then buy your staff.   
---
BoE items have equal value to everyone, because the value of the item is determined by it's gold price. It's not a difficult concept.
---
How much does gear matters while lvling, by that what i mean is, im a slow lvler (doing quests and such) right now im 43 warrior using a ww axe, guides say that the uldaman mace is the next upgrade but right now forming a group for that dg is kinda hard, should i try to farm the mace or just ignore it because later i will get a better upgrade?
---
Then it's completely on you.
---
No, it's 5/second without talents. I know this because I cast my pet abilities manually.
---
yes it is.
---
Try opening up that folder and see if there is another folder called jus Questie in there or something. You might have extracted to a folder of the zip file name.
---
Sexymap!
---
Lol I know, I'm just being a smart-ass. My wife is a Nelf 99/100 times.
---
Thatshow it was done on pservets, suddenly im being told i cant need on a 150g rare because its ninjaing
---
It’s mostly \#2, sometimes disguised as \#4, in my experience.
---
Would you give a mage in your party the 5-700 gold boe bis ring if it dropped?
---
In this scenario he would get it everytime, which might be what you are looking for, but I don't find it ideal. The default on all boe items is that everyone needs the gold in my opinion.
---
But then again, letting people need green stat upgrades is pretty common, I think there is probaby a gold number for when it becomes unacceptable to just take it.
---
1) Equip a 2-hander
---
2) Enter a raid
---
3) Celebrate your life goals with a margarita
---
Then you simply don’t group with these people wowee big brain plays
---
reminds me of an updated version of this clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvW\_u2iNmrQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvW_u2iNmrQ)
---
i was gonna let this go but you really came across as a dick here
---
i'm not a phd, not even a math major, but this is like, a stupid way of explaining something really simple, and you're making it more complex for people reading it in some kind of play to be condescending, not sure really why. 
---
so i'll give you the hurr durr version of why you should probably stop:
---
"hurr durr i don't need the first roll because the first roll is simply establishing the number to be matched! so, the actual question is, what does it take for the second roll to match the first roll? there's a 1/10000 chance for it to hit any number in particular, including the number of the first roll!"
---
statistics is actually simple if you don't overcomplicate it, you petulant asshole.
---
Up until 40(mortal strike) should be using sunder&gt;Heroic strike, you can cast that as well as normal autos so more hits on the mob = more chance for dodges/overpowers. Other than that, leveling solo as a warrior is definitely a challenge.. I just dinged 56, getting there! At around your level I spammed SM as tank/dps until about 40.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
Love the Friends reference.
---
Guidlime + good guide and following it blindly with zero downtime on professions etc
---
Download twitch app, it has a section that will automatically install addons and allow you to keep them up to date without having to constantly check the website.
---
To me the peak raid was pre-nerf Sunwell followed by Naxx. At least that's where I made my fondest memories of the game.
---
Why? While I don't do it, if people want to, let them.
---
It's the idiots who join them that are punished, I would just refuse to join those groups personally
---
Keep hassling them in support tickets. This should be restored as it's a petty critical item to have access to.

I get the concept, and in theory it's solid. But to a person who will equip said gear, it has more value. It has the stated monetary value that all players share, yes. I have no argument there. But to the need player, it also has intrinsic value as a piece of gear. You can't say that for everyone, therefore a need player has more claim to the gear.
---
She doesn't deep breath if no one is in the path.
---
I'm also hoping this is the case.
---
Lol, bullshit
---
The first step is dropping one of tailoring or enchanting.
---
The second step is seeing which of mid-range metals or mid-range herbs is selling better on your server ie how many stacks of stuff you can gather where you can survive gets you to 100 gold. I suspect it's mining, but your server may vary.
---
The third step is spending some time levelling your new gathering profession.
---
The final step is circuits around places like Arathi Highlands gathering, and killing mobs for XP when you need to.
---
Not mad at all, i simply answered your question you sadistic child
---
I’ve been thinking about getting into Live Strat groups and just asking to reserve the first orb drop, seems reasonable like you said there’s not a damn thing in there for me and everyone is foaming at the mouth to get a tank. Seems fair to me to come out of that hour or so dungeon with an extra 35g.
---
I’m seeing 50-60g on mine.
---
5 players invested effort, should all the spoils go to one player? No, he can pay for the efforts of the other 4 through gold if it’s a BoE.
---
Do you walk into a coffee shop and say “I need dis” and steal it? No, you pay for it. Do you walk into a dungeon and say “I need dis” and tell everyone else to screw themselves? Sounds like it from your post, so tone down that sodium.
---
Follow a quest route and grind everything in sight  little downtime as hunter
---
Yeah.  No drama really on bloodsail. There's a bit of price fixing on the ah but nothing worth noting
---
Dailies weren't, but dailies that were basically required for progression were.  The dailies prior to the Isle were basically all for cosmeitcs.  Shatari Skyguard and the Netherdrakes gave you mounts. All the other reputations in the game were best obtained by running heroics (which had a natural timegating mechanism since over a certain level you only got rep from heroic boss kills and you had daily locks).  
---
But there was some GOOD gear locked behind the dailies on the island.
---
R-r-r-ight but this post isnt about random shit blue boe's its about epic boe's that are worth something. A 5gold boe blue is nothing comparable to a 300g plus epic. The everyone need rule doesn't apply to worthless items it applies to items with high value.
---
I feel so lost on retail after not playing it for one month. Jumped to do a weeklY 10 on my tank and was just shocked on the fact that i got aggro all the time lol
---
Boy do you sound stupid now
---
Wind Serpent lighting breath imo.
---
But im only 24
---
I figured it out. I didn't have 7zip installed. Once i installed that I did the extraction process again but this time selecting extract here. Before, without 7zip there was no options for extract here, just extract, which I guess is why it wasn't working. Thanks for the help.
---
I don't like drop there.  
---
Strange items with +agi. +int or +10 str/30 spirit.
---
If your hunter feels boring everytime you start trying to level then your probably not feeling that class. It may be because it's not as stimulating to play vs other classes.
---
Try making a rogue for some faster paced gameplay or maybe even a warrior and fill the tank role in a dungeon. Just keep in mind, all classes around level 40 require lots and lots of exp to level so its going to slow down no matter what you choose to play.
---
Is this a fever dream
---
Yeah, the spot isn't for the eggs, it's for the easy xp. The eggs are just a bonus.
---
That gnome is a spy!
---
I have questie but I've already done the quests in duskwallow and did just about every quest in STV a lot of them probably did earlier than I should have, badlands I have 2 quests left and everything seems extremely spread out
---
No the GM shouldn't have. We rolled because it was fair, then when he lost the roll he tried to pressure me into giving it to someone else. My point is absolutely no one is entitled the item more than anyone else. This isn't an item that normally drops. It's an additional random perk. I'd rather be the prick who gives everyone an equal chance to roll than the guy who cries about not getting something that isn't entitled to them. 
---
And to be clear, if everyone else rolls greed, I will also roll greed. I'm not going to be that asshole.
---
“Use” works. Helpful when you want to save space as macros have limited capacity
---
&gt; If you roll need, you are expected to equip. I have never seen anyone abuse this system.
---
lololol????
---
-gives up on classic  
---
-still on the subreddit
---
Umh. Maybe this game isn’t your cup of téa?
---
Hunter is really fun with lvling (quests). 
---
But I did Also start with warrior to 60 so Maybe that is why.
---
It depends; can you handle killing mobs and questing without too much effort? If mobs start getting too tough, then it's time to focus on gearing.

They're usually worth more than the small upgrade they'd provide for a guild that's raiding. In my situation, we all agreed to roll. Otherwise, I'm down for splitting it.
---
Yeah I'll probably do the same with SM. Thanks for the help!
---
True, it works to burn cool downs too.
---
New generation of gaming, a lot of content creators are rude and obnoxious for entertainments sake, and their following parrots them. Also, people have been playing games like LoL, CSGO, Rainbow 6 for years now, making them a lot less.... reasonable to communicate with.
---
Yeah heroic strike is really bad. Only use it at level 60 when you're not rage starved all the time. Whirlwind and later mortal strike are your best friends.
---
The beauty of Classic is that all you really need to to is leave the group to teach them a lesson.
---
I would suggest trying both classes out on instant-60 private servers and just mess around a bit and see how you think they feel. Warlocks are also pretty fast and easy levelers by the way :)
---
Punctum is the name for it
---
Not the normal reply, but you play what you enjoy. Gaming isn't a job so if you don't feel like grinding then don't. Come back for a nice long session with tons of rest XP later if nothing else. Sometimes you need a break even from your favorite game and maybe this is that time.
---
Absence makes the heart grow fonder after all.
---
Try hamstring kiting. A swing timer addon can make this easier. Basically you hamstring, and strafe left then right, changing as your auto attack readys up. You trade hits 1:1 with mobs, greatly reducing the damage you take as most mobs have about a 2.0 attack speed. It's really easy once you get it down, and very powerful. The other thing you can do is focus on areas that are 3-4 levels lower than you as you will carve through these enemies effortlessly.
---
Take a weeklong break from leveling.  You’re a hunter!  You are a master tracker and survivalist so go try and explore as much of the continents as you can.
---
Try to get to lights hope chapel in EPL for the flight path
---
Get a ton of cheap beer in dwarflands and get drunk outside orgrimmar and dance
---
Take up fishing and chill outside wailing caverns to farm deviant fish (key ingredient in giant elixirs)
---
Go see your dwarven cousins in hinterlands and searing gorge!
---
Try to get really good at dueling (Id say do battlegrounds but they arent open yet)
---
Learn to kite!  Hunters are the best at bringing giant elite monsters from across the world to cities to terrorize the locals
---
Who cares about raiding when you can do all this dumb stuff at 41?  : )
---
&gt; There really isn't a way to prevent it 
---
There is, it’s called “all need”.
---
Kicking and blacklisting doesn’t matter because the ninja already happened. It doesn’t matter if you get ninja’d by someone who could equip it or not. You got ninja’d!
---
Zf is nice
---
Maybe on resist but not on miss
---
How so?  For posting what we knew before changes were made?  And how stupid do you look necro posting on something before dire maul went live?  Tryhard much there bud, pretty cringe.
---
&gt; Roll need, tell everyone else to roll need, and leave it up to RNG. Since it's BoE, you can buy it from the winner if you really need it. Nobody cries. 
---
Nah, if someone truly needs it and will equip it immediately, get confirmation of all that in chat and fork it the fuck over to them.
---
If they try to play funny, start posting it everywhere relevant and ruin their game like the ninja they are deserves. Open a ticket, as it could qualify as a scam if the agreement in in-game chat was that they would equip the item if you traded it to them. Reopen it if the first GM fails to read it.
---
I've had this happen a few times so far in PuGs. So far no issues. I've had to trade items (granted, they were blues, but my point still stands). I still don't trust randoms, but I do trust in my own ability to retaliate if scammed, and I legitimately enjoy doing that when someone does try to screw me over.
---
Being a tank i never join group with reserved loot.
---
Honestly I found running dungeons to be a good deal of fun
---
Trying out different comps 
---
As a paladin I found running as a dps to be the most enjoyable. 
---
Between dishing out damage via seal of command
---
Judging  wisdom to help any mana users with mana regeneration.
---
Blessings 
---
Blessing of sacrifice in use with divine shield is very powerful
---
If you find a good group you’ll gain a lot of xp in little time and make some friends in the end game.
---
Just need to not hit sons.
---
I have to wonder if these posts are shit. I mean that really sucks if that’s been your experience. 
---
But I’m running into new players everywhere. Or newbie questions and I’ve never seen anyone be flamed for it once. 
---
Sucks to hear. I’ve just never seen this personally happen. Not even close.
---
False, theres infinite restore with a 15 day cooldown.
---
All the starting zones are actually linear. It was just the first time they used that to actually tell a single story, so it stands out more.
---
For raids, whatever has the highest amount of spell damage, always.
---
I found that just the other day! Was a hell of a swim haha. Ended up swimming all the way around to Tirisfal Glades.
---
We (ranged DPS) popped Greater Fire Protection Potions on the Sons.  Melee Dps and tanks popped Greater Fire Pots on cooldown.  Our tanks were fire resist capped, we used a feral Druid and a warrior as the MT.
---
We spread mana users around and had a melee leader calling out when the melee dps needed to go in and out, and had our tanks calling knockbacks.  
---
When the Sons spawned, we had melee mark them and and single target them while mages AoE’d from afar with blizzard.  The key is to keep the fucking Sons away from your mana users and kill them FAST.  We banished a Son at the end because so we could regen mana.
---
Hope this helps, happy to talk on a Discord later if you want more tips!  Good luck!
---
I had the same accident today and I got into a disconnect loop because of it. I had to log on an alt to open a blizz ticket to move my character. Luckily they helped in a few minutes. Why cannot this goddamn lift be fixed?
---
As someone in your same position, looking at these responses looks like our best bet is begging, or questing lol
---
hasn't "deus vult" become like a white supremacy slogan or something
---
If gold isn't an issue, then keep your gear upgraded as much as you can (so buying from AH).
---
Not without the key you can't :)
---
hey look, yet another person that cant argue the logic. And reading yours is like ready the chat of a 12y/o raging on the internet.
---
We were running way too many healers so we just phase 2 at around 18%.
---
The youngest boomer would have been mid 30s when runescape was first released.. wouldn't exactly call that 'growing up on'
---
Begins once you hit 25. Happens all the time by 30.
---
I think this was addressed lately??? Idk I thought I remembered reading a blue post on it this week. 
---
I just re-specced into entrapment and haven't had the chance to play around with it yet. Wish me luck lol
---
Edit: addressed as in "Acknowledged", not fixed
---
DO IT BRO!!
---
Whew! Someones angry. No. It's not the same. A random BOE isn't a normal part of the loot table. It's a bonus. Treat it like a bonus...for everyone involved.
---
Not without the key which is why I joined a group.
---
My 29 hunter twink was also a god. Only thing that stood a chance was twink warriors at this level.
---
That’s what you perceive I said? Really?
---
It's not that crazy.
---
400g item drops. The entire group put in the same amount of effort to earn that item. It's only directly beneficial to 1 person in the group. Should 1 person be entitled to that item when selling it is just as beneficial to the rest of the group as equipping it is to the 1 person?
---
Either 5 people put in effort and only 1 person has an opportunity to loot 400g, or 5 people put in effort and all 5 have an equal opportunity to loot 400g.
---

---
Nobody can be a ninja looter if everyone is a ninja looter.
---
It's not ninja looting if everyone needs.
---
It's the definition of greed.
---
Do not need for gold.
---
---------------------
---
Each statement is true, however the right system to use is for each group to decide.
---
If you see only a single person roll need and it's a fair upgrade for them, maybe show restraint and respect the democracy that says "We roll greed for items we don't need as upgrades".
---
Couldn't ge just trade it after taking the screenshot?
---
Push. The power curve after 50 is satisfying
---
I always skip around while reading long post or just altogether bail after the first couple of paragraphs, but this caught my attention and left me wanting more.  Bravo!! Well written.
---
If you just mindlessly kill stuff you make gold and level faster than turning in quests unless they are convenient on your path.  Just the run to turn in a quest usually you get more xp staying where you are and killing mobs.  10 hrs is crazy long for a hunter at 41, if you focused on grinding and not worried about finding dungeon groups you'll knock out levels fast.  If that isn't fun for you just do one level like that then skip uldaman and go zf... much more popular and good xp.  At that level though if you just go solo grind should be like 2-3 hours  a level for hunter. 
---
Maybe take a break though.  If you're not into grinding away to build your character that part doesn't really end and you might wanna consider this game isn't for you.  Sounds like you're not enjoying it already.
---
when the game got slow for me, id get 5 bars quest xp (to avoid quest drought), 5 bars solo grinding (which ties into questing as well), and the last 10 would be pure dungeon xp
---
Priest has a lot of "obverse" spell pairs, which I like to put in the same macro that casts either depending on the current target.
---
E. g. shadow word pain if targeting an enemy, renew for allies. Smite against enemies, heal when an ally is targeted instead. Silence against enemies, power word: shield for allies.
---
Run with better ones then.  You’re clearly not, or you’re still farming 20+ mob pulls in ZF, something that happens very infrequently at 60.
---
Okay, sorry to ruin your procrastination.
---
Haha
---
Every group also needs a healer, yet healer spot fills up instantly. There's plenty of other dungeons with warrior loot yet it's always hard to find a tank.
---
For sure. Any specific BOEs that are great along the way? So far I haven't seen any that stand out.
---
Fuck you, Blizzard. Fuck you.
---
Who said anything about good?
---
Laughter is the best medicine
---
That joke went over my head when I was a kid, and yet was still funny. Masterful comedic timing.
---
I played in vanilla on teneras. No one ever called it VC.
---
Definitely 1 and 4, I dont really like tanking and mindless groups make me realllllyy not like it.
---
Dropping skinning is super common, end game skinning is only needed by one person in your raid group to skin core hounds in MC and Onyxia. You're on the right track with what you're thinking
---
If he really needs that item, he can buy it.
---
Thats super naive.
---
She's camping the black lotus spawn.
---
Both HoJ and Force of Will can also drop from Emp.
---
Nope. Full plate. I get dropped pretty fast if they get a good opener as feral. I haven't seen a single balance druid yet.
---
Well at 60 it's up to the group, and sometimes people would let you need on that epic shield or w/e that you want to wear. You shouldn't expect them to, but it happens. Ofc the higher the value of the item, the less likely it is.
---
more like they think they have to be in tanking spec to be abel to tank dungs
---
What server are you on? It sounds sad =(
---
You’re preaching to the choir that is Reddit. How about you produce an original thought you spineless chimp.
---
Windfury is what makes it viable, I believe you spam hamstring as your rage dump to proc it and flurry?
---
What addons do you have on
---
Master the art of gouging the blink.
---
Are you playing on a toxic server or something?  The worst I've seen is a pally  healer rolled need on a BoP off spec piece when the tank wanted it.
---
Sounds like a private server thing. https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/34576
---
+ healing is good for all healers as it allows them to down rank heals to conserve mana which is imperative for raiding.
---
If your class can farm goblin, princess and rot you can probably do DM east too.
---
If you're a lock there a guides in the discord. A newer one is supposed to get you 100g-200g an hour doing dm east 4 bosses which is more than those 50g an hour in mara. gl
---
When not in dungeons, use a regularly-replaced blue two handed weapon that is heavily enchanted. Keep food buffs and elixir buffs up.
---
Also, get tanking practice, ideally with your friends, but in PUGs if you have to. Always find your DPS by private messaging level-appropriate players - as a new tank, you simply dont want some impatient SOB who has been waiting for a tank for an hour in LFG.
---
Ideally, you want the DPS lower level than you. Its tough and frustrating dealing with DPS 3+ levels higher than the tank, especially if they are typical DPS and clueless about how to manage their threat.
---
Was waiting for this NPC te spawn with a party, when it spawned I just happen to hit the escape key to close a window at the same time a party member started the quest, so I wasn't on the quest and left the party. By the time I finished several others quests around Ratchet I ran into the party again which by then was finally almost finished with the quest. So glad I dodged the bullet there, would have been total waste of time.
---
I fought a paladin in Felwood over a Gromsblood. As I ran up to engage I re-upped my Omen of Clarity. That lasts 10 minutes. I had to re-buff that during the fight before I hearthed out.
---
Yeah and they expect a healer to do it eventhough it gives him nothing.
---
That's about the level I usually start an alt, play them until around level 15-20 and then I get motivated to play my main again
---
There is a 1% chance that any spell will be resisted by any mob no matter what the level difference is, including feign death. This is non-reduceable by spell hit.
---
Assuming you are bm frenzy spec, brokentooth has the highest aggro of any pet because it has the highest dos modifier and fastest attack speed. It also has dash to reach mobs faster and start hitting it sooner.
---
Tanking is work. Plain and simple. I only have a lowbie tank right now, but I’ve had 3 warriors to 60 in retail vanilla and private servers. Most of the time, I love it because it’s so involved. I get to set the pace, reserve items, etc.  If I’m sick, tired, hungover or just not feeling it, tanking sucks with a good group. Now add the AoE mage, multidotting lock and hunter that can’t properly multishot and it’s downright unbearable. 
---
Knowing that pain, I try to help the tank by seducing mobs on my lock and preemptively putting traps down in front of mage who doesn’t have a threat meter installed on my hunter.
---
whenever u start tanking dungeons, line of sight pull mobs whenever u can to “herd” them in one area. not as important for melee mobs ofc but still a great habit to get into
---
Yikes. These are the ones that need their names exposed. Weirdos.
---
A major problem where those reserves occur is in instances where nothing --literally nothing-- good for warrior drops. They have to have a reason to come, and gear can't beit.
---
Your friends just need a tank :p tell them to mske alts and level with you.
---
You can buy from me that I don't need on your BoP item. Nice deal ok? After all, it is worth something for me. So why should I accept to get nothing?
---
Do you not want the classic experience?
---
Agreed. This is garbage. Clearly I'm too old to "get it" whatever the fuck "it" is.
---
Mage can buy your auction. Rolling for BoE is like rolling for a pile of gold.
---
I could keep watching this even if it kept on going for like 10 hours.
---
The irony being, that tanks reserve stuff all the time like orbs.
---
Thanks! Good to know
---
wtf, how do you have social anxiety in a game lmao
---
US-Rattlegore horde player here. I've only had a pleasant experience in my time to 60.
---
Too bad game companies are vehemently opposed to taking good ideas from they player base. This is such a perfect idea.
---
Imagine thinking that your singular experience is representative of a population in the tens of thousands.
---
Oh I hope it does drop cause I have blackened belt and gloves.
---
I’m alliance, but this was a nice gesture.
---
u gotta keep in mind a lot of the players are veterans that have been waiting forever for this game to come back. a lot of 30-50 year old single, lonely men on here... it took me by surprise that most of the players in my guild except my friends are much older than us, and we’re only 20-25. a lot of them act just like this, suck the fun out of things, judge other guildies for their success. id rather grow humble than grouchy:]
---
¿porque tu es morono?  
---
hito el mobbo hardo so we donto dieo
---
Now that’s a big brain move
---
I'm no analytics/math guy, but I've been very happy with mine as a levelling weapon on my pally. I paid 20g on deviate delight, and I was very happy with that amount. If you go check out the wow head discussion on it there are favourable comparisons made to kangs. Obviously not as good, but the cleaver is much cheaper. I'd say list it for anywhere from 15-50g, depending on how quickly you need it to sell.
---
Also looks sexy.
---
Need help with wand macro, I've had success with it being spammable but sometimes when I change targets I get locked out of my shoot cast despite not shooting. Then it suddenly I can't shoot even when moving until it's dead or I cast something else
---
more like /delete
---
Lol "should of"
---
The dance is a reference to hat kid which is some dumb as kid from a game doing a stupid ass dance with a stupid smug face and I fucking hate it.
---
I HAVE MANY QUESTIONS.
---
More healing classes than tanking classes I guess. I personally dont envy tanking in todays classic, DPS classes never wait for aggro and the tank has to chase the mobs all around the dungeon. As a healer the only thing that bothers me is when they pull while im oom. Also cant stand when people dont run back after a wipe and expect me to res them.
---
Or you can just not go on his runs instead of posting his name and being angry about something that doesn’t have anything to do with you.
---
Yeah, people have lost all concept of what a troll actually is and just assume anyone being a loud asshole is a troll.
---
My own personal little joke at the moment is whenever I see people recruiting for their guild I put up a message for our guild immediately after:
---
'&lt;Retail is BETTER&gt; isn't recruiting, I just thought I'd remind you of the fact.'
---
Holy shit it gets people fired up. I don't say anything else, just that single tell. I get legitimate angry hate messages from people all the time; it's fucking hilarious. 
---
Some guy saw my guild name on a zep to org one time, sent a message about how wrong I am which I took as a joke, so I fired back that he was just angry that he couldn't find a proper offhand for his warrior and had to use a shitty dagger instead. He didn't stop whispering me hate messages about being a useless retail baby and whatnot until I had done my business in org, and took a flight path all the way to Gadgetzan. I didn't send a single whisper back, just took in all the salt. Some people are proper nutty, it's pretty funny.
---
Best comment of the thread right here.
---
So you ninja it yourself. What a hero.
---
Rolling need is the only way to prevent a ninja.
---
I feel bad for any guild who invites him.
---
I'm pretty sure that the Jerky Boys actually use that as an insult in some of their prank calls, lol.
---
I could, but I’m not going to
---
I got my mount at 52...It was more challenging running especially in a pvp server 😂
---
and you can buy the epic off the AH if you need it so badly.
---
You are absolutely right.
---
I played vanilla for first 4 years while I was a student. Then quit until now with classic. Expected to see more old-timers like me to come back to wow. Instead,  it’s full of morons, cunts, assholes and dickheads. They suck the pleasure out of the game, which they don’t even understand is about
---
Nah, they had a fair roll at it just like everyone else. You're talking like they were barred from rolling lol.
---
Yes, but Zoomers are too stupid to know how to use words correctly, so Boomer applies to anyone older than them.
---
if u need a BOE buy it on the AH. not doing so is the definition of greed lol
---
je ne sais quoi
---
A good weapon makes lvling a warrior x2 easier. And health pots
---
Executioner's cleaver is amazing. Lvl 43 2h axe with lots of strength and hit
---
Everyone should need on BoEs.
---
Everyone NEEDS gold and if its a pug dungeon run, nobody is going to pass up on making whatever gold the BoE is worth just because you're going to equip it.
---
needing any boes is ninja
---
So according to war discord it's generally 25-30ap
---
Is the mage wand the one where they make you choose between the wand or the purple orb ?
---
&gt; biggest downfall of wow was cross realm and everything that came with it
---
They really should have just bitten the bullet and did mergers. That's what cross realm basically did anyway so they might as well go with it.
---
Trade skill master changes the look of the window and also gives extra info and can be used to search the ah for the mats
---
i mean, if they would use the item, i feel like they should need it. so i would be 100% comfortable giving them the super expensive ring, assuming we knew it wouldn't just be sold. 
---
the only gold-based alternative i would be comfortable with is one where the whole group splits the gold for the BoE, because it was a group effort. 
---
one person randomly getting a ton of gold when someone else could've used the item directly just feels bad to me. it's similar to the disenchant roll that modern wow has (or used to), where you can turn a BoP into gold, effectively. but disenchant isn't equal to need, it's equal to greed to avoid that situation, because people needing the item specifically is something we've valued more than just needing gold.
---
Sure, they have the right to be laughed at
---
Coal 2 for a little while went for 2x buying from vendor lol
---
I never said anything about 15 agi? 26 agi from hatchets is 52 AP so thats why i said barb blade is +8 AP.
---
My argument was that hatchets also have +10 stam, so it was +10 stam vs +8 AP.
---
Also to my knowledge there arent weapon agi enchants? I only saw attack power or intellect enchants.
---
Defo agree with wanting a 2hander for pvp though, crit raptor is very good. But in pvp won't you just use lok'delar..? that think has fat stam and intellect
---
I uh... play on the internet... during the most toxic time in history... it's almost as if this entire post isnt about people and their experience with toxic people.
---
I have always leveled as subtlety, through TBC/WOTLK/Cata etc. It's great to have the extra evasion, vanish, blind, kidney shot etc available for when it's needed. Makes PVP a breeze too, easy escape if you get jumped and get out jail free cards if you bite off more than you can chew. I've never had an issue beyond elitists in low level dungeons getting upset that I'm not leveling how they want me to
---
You can’t kill all of them on site some need to be saved to play gnome ball with.
---
This is what I try to say before all my dungeon runs.. If a BOE blue/purple drops, just need roll on it. It stops the ninja looting.
---
I started reading leveling guides to help me find new places to quest. I got burn out early on after trying two toons, got a lot of shit too because I said I was burnout and asked the same thing you are asking now, and I turned to guides and started flying through levels again and got back in the groove
---
for Holy and Prot, this is true but for Spelladin Ret its BiS for all of classic.
---
except it's pointless because you can get to anger in 5 minutes and farm hoj that way hence the lack of full runs
---
The only people that don't know the rule are people who get ninjad. Stop spreading misinformation, some poor sap is going to think you know what you're talking about and get screwed because of it.
---
If you're in a pug everyone should be rolling need on valuable BOEs. If you think someone deserves free loot because it's an upgrade, then by all means, give it to them. I certainly have done it for BOE epics before. But that doesnt mean that person should be allowed to have it just because. You're denying one entitlement by replacing it with another. Thats unfair.
---
Now if it's a guild or friend group, then you determine the rules amongst yourself.
---
Frankly I'm shocked that people believe they should be given very valuable loot just because they want to equip it
---
Good gear is more important for warriors. If you can spare some gold to get Executioners axe it will last you until dreadforge retaliator
---
Exactly correct.
---
bUt that Would ruIN the clASsic eXPerIeNcE!!
---
I messed up :) My raid has a ton of hunters so i can go whatever spec i want mostly so i was in BM for a long time
---
It's a combination of a lot of different things.  
---
* Guilds only need a few tanks, most warriors are DPS warriors
---
* Even though DPS warriors can tank off-spec even at 60, it's pretty difficult if the group itself isn't good. You can't expect every group to be good every single time.
---
* A lot of DPS warriors don't have a full tanking set just yet. Depending on the dungeon, it's not just "throw on plate and a shield".
---
* Some warriors (I put myself in this category) don't feel comfortable tanking off spec because they either aren't good enough at it or aren't geared enough for it so they would rather not.
---
* Some warriors are assholes and just don't want to tank despite having gear for it.
---
If you factor all of this on top of the usual shenanigans that can happen in a dungeon group, you see why people would be reluctant to tank. Warriors also do not have many good reliable farming methods. So reserve runs are usually the best way for them to make money sometimes. Some tanks straight up charge gold to tank dungeons, especially when they don't need the dungeon at all.
---
It's very good for levelling warriors and shamans
---
Ret/DK player here. TBC made the Tax legitimate and support DPS specs typically offered raid buffa or debuffs that were manditory for progression. In Classic the tax made hybrids worthless, in TBC they were support specs. 
---
Ie you basically needed an Enh in your melee group, an ele in your caster geoup, a ret in your raid, a shadow in your caster geoup, etc.
---
keep gear updated, get them to buy you a kang the decapitator axe at 44
---
maybe get one to heal you while you smash packs of mobs
---
Sounds great, doesn't really work. Because you need other players to do raids and if they don't want a really poor dps then you can't join them.
---
shit parties are all around.
---
National Treasure of Whitemane
---
Wait so if a skull flame shield drops you idiots are going to hit greed?? Wtf? That’s quite possibly my favorite item in the game and as a Warrior I’d be overjoyed if it dropped but I full on expect everyone else to hit Need since that is the equivalent to 600g dropping
---
You seem to have missed the entire point of needing the item because someone else tried to ninja it in the first place
---
I heard that lol
---
Few people on my server all put their auctions up for 1copper and high BO. Super annoying going through pages of that shit.
---
I mean, does it make a difference between  12.00% crit and 12.50% crit? I was under the impression that if you don't reach the next % (13%), then it wouldn't matter
---
Helping hord scum.. how dare you!?
---
Any good alchemy / herb guides on what potions/recipes to buy to make cash at 60?
---
To be fair, if you're prot spec theres not much options out there for farming gold.  One of the recommended ways is to tank strat and ask for the first orb in exchange for tanking.  I would say reserving more than just the first orb is going too far though
---
Can I have your gold?
---
Yep, exactly.  =)
---
If you go to Dustwallow Marsh and have a chat with the ogres at Brackenwall village, they all speak about as eloquently as Thrall.
---
The best part is during an escort quest, a fine gentleman of an ogre nicely asks you to help him with perfect punctuation and spelling; when he then enters combat he screams, "MMMEEEEEEE SMAAAAAASSSSHHHH RIVER CROCOLISK!" while beating it with his stick. He's surprisingly weak.
---
Wonder if those people ever stop to ask themselves "Is this guy just baiting me?"
---
Doesnt matter in ulda, there is a chest to loot without rolls and a quest to complete
---
Found the guy with a brain incapable of accepting different opinions nor logical thinking.
---
It's not just BFA is a joke. The steep backsliding already started in TBC.
---
Here are the issues:
---
1. Flying mounts
---
2. PVP in general was backsliding hard. World of Pillarcraft sucks. (WoW is a crappy PVP game and there are much better PVP games in 2019). The demise of  Arena Junkies shows that it was bad. If there is an arena, it should not reward gear.   Resilience was put in to force people to PVP.
---
3. Class balance
---
4. Gear tokens for welfare epics.
---
5. Portal city of Shattrath
---
6. Dailies
---
7. The overall backsliding into a single player game.
---
I think Classic should reboot with a revamped level 60 raid called Karazhan. Take what was good from subsequent expansions and throw the rest in the garbage. And unfortunately, there was a lot of garbage in TBC, WotLK, and onwards.
---
this happens to me a the time, in that exact same spot. the spirit healer is no where near the flight point there. it’s annoying.
---
info on attack tables here
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table
---
or rogue discord could prob help https://discord.gg/DtgHDkk
---
i think alot of rogue dps comes from autos so they may value hit more as the hit cap refers to yellow hits not white hits
---
Not without addons.
---
Because while there are many warriors, most of them won’t tank. 
---
The amount of tanks in the game is smaller than any other role by a large margin.
---
Can you explain what you mean by "intrinsic value"?
---
The boss loot I was mainly referring to.
---
Pservers isn't the same as classic though. It's just one subset of the classic community. 
---
You weren't wrong to do it then and you might not be now but you can't expect opinions to be the same.
---
But it is annoying when people constantly post their upgrades and level ups...
---
That's stupid. It is gear, to be used.
---
I think the little thing that always annoyed me was bloodlust.
---
I mained shaman since I started, and being THE class that had bloodlust was fucking sick. Everyone loved you for it.
---
And then mages got timewarp. No downside, no nothing. Exactly the same fucking skill.
---
And then hunters pets could bloodlust for some fucking reason.
---
And then leatherworkers could just make bloodlust drums, and I was just like cool, everyone is the fucking same now.
---
So, the thing about the t0 sets, is often they're not BIS because their itemization is unchanged with the 1.10 dungeon loot overhaul, leaving them behind a fair bit.
---
Barely any of T0 is very good, so unless a BIS list suggests it, don't bother.
---
I like to actively cause havoc with people who behave this way. I am a very vindictive bitch.
---
Agree. Completely BRD in your mid 50’s feels like quite the accomplishment.
---
on the off chance you're alliance on whitemane I can help you with the mc attune on my tank
---
Yeah, just saying thats not even 1/3 of things this healer had to pick up
---
Crit chance % is pretty strong.. it equals to about +15agi per 1% crit.. so rockpounder has 5str, 30agi, and the damage..
---
The sheer stupidity and asshole justification going on in this thread just astounds me. It really just goes to show that Blizzard can endeavor to bring back a 15 year old game, but its never going to be like it was, because the community has become absolute garbage since Vanilla. 
---
Anyone in Vanilla that rolled Need on a BoE to sell over someone who actually needed the item would be branded a ninja. The fact that this is even an argument shows how fucking trash this community has become.
---
BoP items worth a little gold drop multiple times every run. BoE worth 100s of gold drop less than 1/100 runs.
---
Average it out across runs and needing every BoP item would make you more money, easily.
---
No disrespect friend that’s what I main (lock human), and getting stick for it
---
Dank stolen video
---
No idea why he brought up Pservers at all, but I never played on them. It was this was in vanilla and always has been. Obviously different servers may have different quirks and ways to do things, but the general community always needed BoEs, it just makes the most sense.
---
Cool story bro
---
At the same time this is what is killing my classic experience. Every warrior in my server wants to be dps, if you are lucky and get a warrior to tank they do itwearing dps equipment. The few protection warriors in my guild are so well equipped that they never want to do 5 man dungeons.
---
I can't even imagine playing dps, I have it easy as a healer.
---
I would've used it, however being an orc, I got the Gatorbite Axe from Mara for the extra axe skill. Level 56 and still using the Axe
---
Ay, mon. It be best ta speak in da common tongue when ya be correspondin wit de othas. Dey aint yet adopted Troll-speak, ya heard? Sommin bout dey tongues aint nottin' good for it.

I don't care what anyone thinks, I'll admit that I like the newer models over the older ones. New chromie looks way better than anything else in the video.
---
You’re cruel but then again, pvp server... you know what you signed up for.
---
I also just quit my account for the same reason.  I've played since the original launch off and on.  Came back for Classic and got to around level 32 and just never really had any fun.  I was only playing to spend time with my husband who was also playing, but we have now both quit due to the madness with China.
---
Anyone know the names of any good bots.. asking for a friend obvs...
---
This 100%. I couldn’t of said it better myself thank you
---
Its just the one swan actually
---
That's fair
---
Yes i have why i said multiple times for items no longer available in game from quests. Source or you are full of shit. The post i linked tells them to do what i said. One google search will have 100 forums confirming what i said. Oh wait i forgot reddit word of mouth&gt;facts and sources.
---
I also need to know what chat box addon that is, slicker than a $10 whore
---
Ironic that you're accusing other people of being lazy and not wanting to grind for gold. It's BoE. If you need it so bad, go buy it off the AH.
---
Why should the rest of the group get screwed out of potential gold because you're too lazy/cheap to buy the item yourself?
---
Yep.. Sucks when ur the druid tank and a warden staff drops and everyone needs... I spammed /cry for 10 min after that
---
Of courssssee it is , if I catch someone doing I won’t be taking it lightly , anyway I try to make sure it gets equipped
---
I made Priest over Hunter because I like Priest more and I figured they can farm almost as well as Hunter doing DME lashers. 
---
Unfortunately lasher farming sucks and now I’m just leveling alts because IDK what to farm on Priest. Feels like my time is better spent leveling an alt vs farming mara for 20g/hr.

Are you sure they weren't complaining about the mage/hunter who was spamming GOGOGO during every mana break?

I can't do this lol, these people just keep using circular logic and ignoring everything else. I'm going to end up perma-banned from this sub if I keep engaging.

You can vendor them.  How valuable does an item have to be before taking it away from someone who is intending on using it isn't considered ninja looting?
---
What did I even just watch?

I already unsubbed. The game never made the community. The community made the game.

People would still need it just to vendor.

This is great information thank you, definitely will rethink how i want to use. I will certainly take your advice seriously thank you so much!
---
Anyone who doesn't "Need" on BoE epics is against himself when putting it nicely and a complete sucker if talking honestly. This discussion about wording or gold coin icon is so stupid it hurts. Everyone needs the gold boost. Selling BoE epics accelerates your character so much it warrants the "Need" roll without any question. But keep on "Greeding" fellas, I'm happy to roll against less people.
---
It's a part of ElvUI

Lol I love it, what server/faction
---
There are BoE items and there are BoP items. BoE items have potential value to everyone. I've seen TONS of players who play the 'but i can equip this item' card, so everyone else passes on it and then you see it on the auction house 30 minutes later. Letting them need on a BoE item is basically trusting their integrity, which you often times have no reason to do.
---
If blizzard didn't want BoE items to have value for everyone, they would be BoP. Plain and simple. They are MEANT to be a piece of equipment that has economic value. It might not always be the most considerate thing to do, but needing on a BoE if no prior rules are established isn't ninja-ing. It's just being selfish.
---
The flipside of BoE items is that you have more opportunities to achieve them than if it were BoP. Because, you know, people are selling them. Now personally, I always pass on items that would be an upgrade to someone else. It sucks to not get that piece you need, and I'm not willing to take that away from someone. But I really bugs me when people bring this up as if they are owed that piece, despite it having value for everyone.
---
Someone got flamed on my server for need rolling a BoE that was worth 1,100g. Everyone else decided it should go to the warrior who could use it, but one person basically said, 'no. This item is of extraordinary value to me.' And he wasn't wrong. That gold could be used to pay for his epic mount in its entirety, or buy several BoE's for him that could arguably be of even greater stat value than to the warrior. He won the roll, and was called a ninja. I think he was perfectly within his right. Bind on Pickup exists. If Blizzard didn't want it to have value to everyone, they would simply use the system that is MUCH more common on rare loot.
---
Lol my fucking god some of these fantasies you people lie about are absolutely pathetic.
---
Any clue how to stop layering and fighting like 20 mobs at once and getting owned. Pretty tiring, and there's no one around me
---
When a epic or expensive boe drops my groups just need on it to prevent ninjaing. Of it's more than 150g MS goes out the window lol
---
I can't see the flag, but it sounds like it's a red one.
---
If you're looking for a very active, non toxic (I'd almost say non elitist) PvE server I can suggest Mankrik.
---
ITT bunch of retail players who don't want to farm gold for boes.
---
Is this the same dance as Hat Kid does in A Hat in Time, and is that the origination of it?
---
&gt;This does also make me raise the question of what exactly the use is of hamstring in PvE? Just 
---
If you have a big slow weapon with a 3.8 swing speed, and your foe has something like a 1.9 swing speed if you fight them without moving they will land 2 hits for every single hit you land.
---
If you hamstring them, run away, and only re-engage when your swing timer is up you will basically land 1 hit for every 1 hit they land, effectively cutting the damage you receive in half.
---
It does work in PvE, but kiting as a warrior is a lot harder than other classes and you may need a few more ranks before it's really effective.
---
No, all the vanilla zones you can skip quest chains, do them in different order, even just grind if you like. In Gilneas I had a character become completely unable to progress because a quest bugged out.
---
sorry mate Boomer is 24+ these days world moves fast
---
This shit again?
---
They should totally make that need icon a stash of gold coins to illustrate that, oh wait... 🤔
---
...Get your own computer?
---
You don't need an expensive computer to run Classic WOW.
---
&gt; People will talk about players being better and more knowledgeable today but honestly something feels off, like everything is undertuned.
---
I've been pretty fortunate with my groups so far in classic but it's hard to agree they're more knowledgeable or better. Very few of my group members understand how group and role dynamics work in classic. People that do though, seem to knock it out of the park.
---
In original vanilla dps pulling aggro would get called out by the whole group very quickly. A mage pulling aggro and standing in melee range draining half the healers mana bar to keep them up would have them chewed out.
---
It's kinda hard to explain. I feel like people are more boneheaded now and force their lazy play style onto their group instead of playing in a more proper play style; one that doesn't make the healers and tanks despise them.
---
Lots of facets to this, let my defend my point of needing expensive (40g+) BoEs/plans while telling the entire party to all need, and giving those that accidentally Greeded a chance to roll for it if you win IS the most logical + fair thing. 
---
1. Opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of equipping a BoE = what you could’ve sold it for on the AH. How often do people expect to be given a 100g ring that they wouldn’t currently spend 100g on, just to lay dibs for it and because it’s a cool piece of gear? Taking and equipping a 100g ring you wouldn’t spend 30g on isn’t a smart move. It would be better to sell that ring on the AH, and use that 100g to buy more efficient upgrades. If it’s better to sell it, demanding that you get it without others rolling on it Is selfish and unfair. Let’s say they WOULD spend 100g on that ring as soon as they had 100g. Great! That person would have saved spending 100g = 100g value. That means everybody should value it equally: 100 raw gold and roll on it. 
---
2. Not every class has the same amount of equip-able expensive gear. Doesn’t seem fair that I don’t have any 300g upgrades for my class (or if I spent a lot of gold BiS’ing myself), that I have to concede all the huge drops to others. Another thing is some classes can “use” a variety of gear, and that some upgrades are subjective. People are by nature self-oriented and won’t always have a clear understanding of what they “deserve” in the other system- another reason why all need on expensive BoEs is superior. 
---
3. Consistency. What if I always pass on big 40g+ items to others in pugs, but when I get a drop others roll need on it to sell it? That’s not fair to me- I should’ve elected to use the “always need 40g+ BoE” method and I wouldn’t have run into this issue. Some will say “well you can abuse it by rolling need on others drops and then when you get am upgrade drop demand that it’s yours”. To answer that, if everybody had adopted the always need expensive BoEs, they would roll on your gear too. Basically, it has less avenues for abuse than the other system. 
---
4. I get that some people don’t like to play RPGs optimally, and play for fun (selling an expensive 300g weapon on the AH and buying more applicable gear would be the optimal play, not the “fun” one”). However, that doesn’t matter when your fun comes at the expensive of others. As pointed out previously, all need is the most equitable and fair system. 
---
5. &lt;40g threshold was my personal subjective number to not fuss about, others may have different numbers. I do agree if an 8g BoE drops that is an upgrade for somebody, they should get it. Also for clarification- this is the system I use when none others are suggested before the drop happens, and I may use different methods with guild members/friends.
---
There are certainly scenarios though where our BiS literally doesn't exist on the AH. I've been looking for Frozen Wrath gear for awhile and none of the BiS ones ever seem to be up except for the green lens.

---
Lol why are you using your wife’s sons computer? I’m pretty sure the toasters at target will run this game.
---
I agree but where do we set the line? 5g? 10g? 50g? Everyone has different amounts of gold and farming capabilities... I do agree a 5g drop should just be given to the guy that actually can use... but to make things easier, it really just needs to be all need on boe rares and up. Just make it simple and move on. If it’s worth only a few gold and you can’t afford it, it’s probably more useful for you to sell it for gold anyway
---
Why would the ret “wipe the melee”?

I find this hard to believe.
---
&gt; if someone actually needs it to use, they don't get that chance. 
---
tough shit, basically.
---
imo no one needs an upgrade more than 4 people need a chance at 500g.

Nope. Just because you want to wear it doesn't entitle you to have it over someone else. If I win the need roll and everyone else needed I'm not giving it away.

I think we knew this after people made a killing selling single arrows and single bullets in Wrath.

I think its a combination of not getting enough distance and getting hit twice because of it. Ive noticed some times I dont swing also. Sadly ive tried looking up a guide for classic but couldnt find a good one.
---
Idk man I do this all the time for BRD just for the hate whispers it's hysterical
---
Pretty much. People come to classic thinking "Every spec must be able to work in its own identity" and it just doesn't fly.
---
Healing's not really that bad. People die, but most of the time it's you trying to save them from their own stupidity. It doesn't feel too bad if you have some die XD

Been waiting just to see a 2 piece.  Very nice bro.  Haven't been super mining but felt lucky with 2 crystals so far off limited rich nodes.

Epics yes, but not rares unless it's an obvious great twink item.

But if they're dicks then just /ignore. Man I would PAY for a functional /ignore IRL

---
Warrior question regarding raid specs:  
---
I was considering trying out a slam build, but I remember hearing that you should avoid going into deep wounds to avoid taking the debuff slot. However, any sort of spec recommendation seems to include is...so what is the correct way?
---
If they're upfront about it is it really an abuse of power? Just dont join the group. 
---
Usually the situation is that you're "paying" for the tanks time since they dont require anything from Strat live, they're doing the group a favor. 
---
Wouldnt you be the asshole in this scenario?
---
Just make sure you need on all BoE blues and if you’re a rogue don’t open dungeon chests for other people, it’ll help you progress faster and the DC’s will be the least of your reputation concerns
---
That’s not what I mean. For example, say I’m a mage and BoE plate item drops. Some warlock in the group needs it to sell for gold. I would also then need it to stop the ninja. If I won, I would then ask the group if they want a re-roll for those who can use it. It’s not rocket science.
---
its harder due to the leeway in classic
---
hamstring is very useful against mobs that flee at low hp, otherwise they can go pull more mobs
---
dungeon farming is the the easy way to level a warrior in classic
---
It's a bug with layering, same happened to me the other day in the barrens.
---
It seems to be that when crossing zones, you were trying to zone into, say layer 4, right when layer 4 was being "shut down." The game counts it as an instance and sends you to layer 3 but resets your position and drops you off the bird.
---
Zandalar is excellent.
---
I get what you mean but the sentiment of it is, in purely loot from the dungeon or whatever perspective, it's a dick move to need upgrades.
---
But I also see the gold = upgrades idea. It's just not direct there and then.
---
I got rid of mine for 250. So 288 is great. I think 300 is the roof now with DM
---
What level are you? How many times are you going to pug strat live before you realise there is literally not a single drop for you in there? And how many times would you do it after that and pay the repair costs?
---
People need tanks for strat live. There is no reason for tanks to go to strat live. Hence, you compensate them for their time when they could be otherwise doing things that benefit them. Its not an abuse of power, its that literally no tank would ever go to strat live and no one would be able to do the dungeon without a guildmate altruistically running them through. 
---
Even in guild runs, its common for people to pass on the first orb, or even *all* the orbs depending on how nice your guild is being, to guarantee the tank doesnt come out net-negative on the run. 
---
Generally I see this attitude from low level tanks who dont understand that once you get to high level, you can basically look forward to running the same dungeons literally hundreds of times hunting for gear for yourself. When you could be running BRD for the 75th time looking for your HOJ, why would you go to strat live with a pug for absolutely no reason? I mean, maybe youre just an altruistic guy who loves tanking pugs regardless of dungeon or whatever, but more likely i'd bet youre sub 40, never been to strat live, and dont even know what an orb is or why theyd reserve them.
---
That's a good suggestion. I don't get to play every day, so it's been a few since I last looked, but elemental earth is going for about 10s each on my server (kromcrush alliance). I may check out the fire elementals though, because those ones are over 2g each.

It’s literally impossible for someone to ninja a 300g purple BoE if everyone needs it, that’s the whole point. It gets rid of ninja from even being a thing
---
It does work. They have leeway so you have have to get a bit farther away. First make sure you're strafe kiting. And you have a weapon swing timer. After you auto while they are debuffed. You strafe, and turn the camera so your back doesnt face them at any point. You can go in circles for the most part, just make sure they are running towards you. If they aren't moving you aren't putting enough distance between you. When the blue bar fills up, then you can stop to auto/heroic strike what have you. Once is done, kite again until it's up. This will save you tons of health. And decrease your down time significantly. Not only will you be healthier for the next pull. Once you get the hang of it you can kite then toward the next mob you plan to engage. Its honestly a fucking life saver leveling a warrior, especially solo.
---
I take less damage by avoiding the hits the of the enemies correct? Or does enemy damage magically decrease the further away you are? As far as I understand hamstring kiting makes you avoid hits from the enemies which = less damage

---
Where can one find/farm this recipe?
---
It's a lot harder on classic than people were used to on pservers, but it still works. The use of it is that if you have a slower attack speed(which you will, massively, with a slow 2handed weapon), you will take less damage because with hamstring kiting you only get hit once per autoattack(which is the only time you are in range), where as a mob with 2.0 speed versus your 4.0 would hit you twice, effectively meaning you take half the damage in this scenario.
---
As a warrior, anything that survives my initial burst, or has heals, or slows, or range. I like rogues when they use evasion
---
I would live in a constant state of fear just like I do on my PvP server.
---
It's different because vendoring a soulbound item gives you a few gold, not a few hundred gold like what you'd see from putting a BOE on the AH.
---
If you only care about protection from ninjas, I can understand that.  Everyone need, then give the item to the person that actually needs it, or roll for it otherwise.
---
But if you use the POSSIBILITY if someone in the group being a lot ninja to justify allowing everyone to roll on an item that one party member actually needs, just because it's worth a lot of gold, that's wrong IMO.  The rare occurrence of someone ninja Need-ing a drop is not a good reason to change the default Need/Greed social contract that works fine for all other loot in the game (which can ALSO be ninja'd anyway, it just isn't worth as much).

That's brutal. Ah well, it's all just pixels after all!
---
If someone has only ever seen bad trolls, chances are they've been trolled without realizing it.
---
Worth noting that with an Axe you can spec into axe specialization for an extra 5% crit instead of the rather weak in comparison mace specialization so that would effectively cancel out the loss of the 2% crit from the weapon and then some, with Executioners you would gain a good chunk of strength and 1% hit too. 
---
If you are a human you would lose the 5 weapon skill bonus though. 
---
Overall I think the axe would be better but it's not that much of a difference that I would spend a lot of gold on it and you aren't far off being able to run BRD for Dreadforge Retaliator which is a clear upgrade.
---
They can also just not do the dungeon. Holding an item a lot of people need hostage, and one that is *very* expensive at that, I'd a dick move.
---
In no world is the tank's time worth 60-180  gold
---
That’s probably because there’s so many people new to vanilla wow with the classic release. Literally for the last 14 years in WoW vanilla/TBC and onward the unofficial rule has always been that in PUGs everyone rolls need on purple BoEs so that it’s not even possible for anyone to ever ninja.
---
whats the leveling adv as a priest compared to pally/druid

is that different in retail?

Then you want to buy me one?  You don't know my situation.

Gratz!! That’s my goal once I hit 60, been taking my sweet time though trying to not out level my friends
---
I had a friend in my irl-friend guild suddenly bail on us to join a raiding guild and I'm having a hard time understanding something. What he did sucks and all that but I can understand wanting something more serious than our casual guild, so that's not my problem here.
---
What I don't get is loot council. Why would anyone ever be okay with that? I never got this far back in vanilla so I am actually clueless here. Am I misunderstanding something about it? It seems like an extremely obvious bad idea. Like, I get it, if you have a knowledgeable, lawful-good guild leader then it would be the best system to have, but come on, I wasn't born yesterday. Saying people like that are few and far between is an understatement. Joining a raiding guild where you aren't an officer/in the inner-circle 
---
and you don't know anyone seems like a nightmare. Why would anyone in their right mind want to gear up someone else's friend group and then maybe, several weeks or possibly months later, get a loot if the council doesn't feel like vendoring it for themselves? If you were the last of a particular class to join a raid team, you would have to do raid after raid, gearing up the other 7 (or however many) of your class before you ever see anything at all, right? Raiding seems fun and I want to do it, but I want to play my character rather than put in actual work every week to gear up some asshole I don't know.
---
I know exactly what you meant. And what I'm saying is I'm going to sell it even if I am a mage. If everyone had a fair chance and I won it's mine, even if I plan to sell it. That only goes for valuable BoEs.
---
Just pick it up whenever possible, maybe complete it later.
---
If you have most/all of the set you can later do the D2 (T0.5) quest line that opens up summonable bosses (good loot) in some dungeons. The items themselves are pretty mixed but e.g. the boots are great (if you don't have Chromatic Boots).
---
It is mostly a "unlock it for the guild" thing and has some costs and effort to it but it is also a fun quest line.
---
For now just pick up any pieces you see and bank them.
---
I hope we don't cross paths

I'm a Shadowpriest and I was running uldaman with my buddy, so we advertise as 2DPS as my buddy is a warrior.
---
We get invited to a group and leader goes "btw you're healing" and I said "hey I'm DPS I'm in shadowform and everything." So my buddy and I decided that we'd join the dungeon and I'd try to "heal" the tank in Shadowform and play stupid.

&gt; They announce elder scrolls mobile game and then right after showed a 30 second teaser for the next big elder scrolls. 
---
In terms of actual marketing value generated, announcing a game without any tangible assets was and remains a stupid idea. Personally, I think Bethesda "revealed" TES 6 (as much as a logo can be a reveal) to give people something to talk about other than how laughably bad Fallout: 76 was.
---
The only thing that people could really get hyped about for TES 6 was .. mountains and trees, and a logo. Great. It certainly triggered a million forum threads, but pretty much exclusively by neckbeards that were a day one purchase anyway. Bethesda also totally surrenders any control they have over the narrative of the game to what plays out on forums and on Reddit, and most superfans will assess whatever real content comes out for TES 6 against whatever blue sky speculation they had made, which _always_ leads to disappointment.
---
Blizzard is much savvier than that. When they announce a game, they do so with a (generally) smartly calibrated media package, which gives day one buyers _and_ more casual fans something to see, hear, and interact with. This also -- barring any "don't you people have phones?" fuckup -- means that Blizzard retains far more control over the narrative, and you can't be disappointed in something that you didn't know _for sure_ was going to be released.
---
One last comment is that Bethesda effectively extended buyer awareness by more than a year, perhaps even two years. That's super bad. With the insane amount of gaming media/marketing we're all subjected to, it's harder than ever to stay hyped for one particular release for many years. Blizzard _tends_ to, at least recently, release games within a year or so of their original announcement, which makes it way easier to keep everybody hyped.
---
Here comes the mental gymnastics!

Why do you hope he's not doing that?

When Classic came out, it fully held my attention for the first month. Before that, I had recently resubbed to check out 8.2. I've played BFA on and off, but just very casually to collect cosmetics basically. When 8.2.5 came out, I played retail a handful of times to work on getting the bee mount. But honestly, yeah, I've lost interest again. I don't have that much time, and what I do have goes to leveling my 2 characters in Classic (and probably more later) and mixing it up with Overwatch from time to time.
---

Get your friends to run you through instances that you're slightly too low level for as the gear that drops is often for a couple levels lower than the reccomended level. Shooting (pardon the pun) for weapon upgrades helps me stay motivated while leveling. Badlands is a good zone for you to do and has two quest rewards that are relevant even to the endgame- the pocket watch with a sprint on use effect and the offhand with a sprint/damage effect. Put on a good album and do some honest to god grinding- the whelps in the far east of badlands are a good choice and have a chance to drop a pet that sells for alot. Grinding is often more efficient than questing, can just get a bit tedious.

So I occasionally enable the ‘movepad’ (under interface&gt;accessibility) and remote into my pc via my mobile to play on the couch.
---
The character movement will look exactly like you are describing (running in one direction, stopping, rotating player angle and moving in a straight line again).
---
Can you be sure it’s not a handicapped player using the accessibility options?
---
The raid difficulty is the same as it was in Vanilla. The only primary differences are how much more knowledgeable everyone is about how to play, and most classes got large talent reworks later in the game. 1.12 talents are way different than what they looked like at launch.
---
Thanks, I'm glad to know not every guild does this at least. I can respect the main tank getting geared first.
---
I feel like iv entered the twilight zone with a massive thread filled with people making no sense.
---
It's a bunch of people arguing back and fourth one side saying rolling need on boe's you can't wear is fine because everyone needs gold (side a) vs people saying if it's an upgrade you have prio over people who want to ah the item (side b)
---
It does not matter what side you are on.  If you are so concerned over this that you need to argue back and fourth making a 500+ comment thread stick the loot distribution on ML and you can decide what to do with purple boes.
---
Hell too lazy to put it on ml? Clearly state you are on side a/b and have everyone agree in raid.  That way you can provide screenshots to blizz if needed.
---
There is already a built in system in game if you are this passionate control over purple boe's.  It's called ml.
---
Rp server? No thanks I’m good
---
probably shouldn't have married a woman already with a child
---
That's so smart, thank you!
---
Literally all of this works, my friend is doing it right now. Get a friend concert to raid you log he resets
---
Dungeons you get done with, consumables not. Cut down on the amount of dungeons you do, or focus more on the other stuff you get - most are good for gold, strat &amp; scholo have AD rep. Also look at what other good items you can get - you don't need full prebis to do MC, just good gear. If you can think of it like "this is a nice upgrade" instead of "I must have this item" it's a lot more fun.
---
Wife’s sons computer. 👀

obviously, if they notice. very few do, in my experience.

If you like shaman, I’d recommend Druid

Yeah, there would be ways to introduce QoL things that don't break the game.
---
I mean if they don't I wont lose any sleep still
---
How are they getting “screwed”? They can go buy that item from the auction house the same as the other person can go sell that item and buy something of equal value for themselves. The only people getting screwed are the ones that passed something so valuable to someone that might equip it or even sell it on the AH themselves. This has been explained clearly multiple times in this thread but it keeps going over your head, or your not reading anything. You say dungeons are meant for gearing up? Ok well that BoE can be used to gear up ANY class EQUALLY if not better. If you can’t understand that then there is no point continuing this convo
---
Guy could have just looked for heals and cdps and not said anything, people just want to run arena and will usually go for angerforge too
---
Classic is fine when you've played it for a month. Now imagine playing it 15 years. There's a reason private servers only had a few thousand people on them.
---
Everything went wrong....
---
The biggest offenders for PvE are flying mounts, LFR/LFG, the removal of the talent trees and the streamlining of the game.
---
For PvP is arena progression, flying mounts and stupid all classes must have all
---
Lol so true
---
live n learn
---
This reeks of a group of 3 DPS who pull when they feel like with no CC
---
Imagine being so greedy that you guilt your party into giving you an item that they can use equally well.  =/
---
When a BoE drops, that's an upgrade for everybody in the party.  And everyone in the party earned that upgrade.
---
Allowing everybody to roll on it is the definition of fairness and non-greed.
---
Plus, *if you pass it*, there's a good chance that they're going to throw it on the AH anyway.  The only fair solution is "all need."
---
This whole reserving nonsense is retail mindset. If people don’t want to value their own time, then please join these reserve groups. 
---
It’s like the tanks demanding payment to tank, sorry guys, you aren’t special. No one owes you shit.  
---
Groups are a dime a dozen, and better yet, just join a guild.
---
&gt;I guess if your server has a terrible community its necessary. 
---
Explain how this is in anyway less hostile than anything I said?
---
You came of the gate ignorantly assuming it's because a server is terrible that a logical conclusion is reached for loot.
---
You could have 5yr olds playing this game and needing BoEs would be the right call to make.
---
So wrong class then bud. This isn’t retail
---
What’s a decent place to farm gold for high level warriors and rogues?

Don't you have anything better to do with your time? Like playing Classic? Or were you banned for being a toxic piece of shit?
---
You either die in shadow form or live long enough to become a healer
---
Especially if it's something like Edgemasters Handguards, I know plenty of tanks who would use it, but just as many who would say they will and def put it on the ah
---
Also there won’t be fucking arenas. Dear lord

Where do you go when you're a level 30 alliance (shadow priest) ? I like quests, dungeons. I just finished all Duskwood quests and Stranglethorn seems too high for me.

Cool man. Nice share. It's good to be social and to break down the walls of anxiety. Idc what anyone says, anxiety is no disorder, it's something most people experience and only few master.. Everyone playing the game is just like you. Looking for a fun break from reality. 
---
Hope you have experiences even better then today :)
---
Retail is hot garbage.
---
Games not for everyone
---
Yeah, on retail you could pretty control the pack for the next 15 seconds with a single thunderclap while youd lose them instantly with any mage in your party, regardless what you do outside of challenging shout. 
---
Even on single target you have to decide on mitigation vs. threat gain while being ragestraved most of the time. 
---
Focus too much playing defensive, lose the mob to dps. 
---
Focus too much on threat, be crushed harder and use up more healer mana which makes chain pulling slower.
---
&gt; Outside of that you are merely the vocal minority attempting to sway others to your view while ignoring the plethora of facts showing why need all is th optimal method in any other situation.
---
Source? There's been no poll or definite consensus so please, take that disingenuous shit and shove it. 
---
&gt;Of you want that type of gear distribution, you have two clear options: i) start a group and clearly state the loot rules at the beginning after forming ii) run exclusively with your guild/friends who agree to these rules. 
---
Needing on BoEs was not the default on my Vanilla server or at any point in my WoW experience. Only recently have people justified their greed with needing on absolutely everything.
---
Anger/arena drop nothing for healers. Banthok for offspec at absolute best. Healers want Golem.
---
Caveat: Might be different for alliance with paladins.
---
Difference is that people are willing to pay someone to tank for them, but nobody is going to pay for a healer or dps for that dungeon
---
I just wait until everyone else has rolled to make my decision. My default is that if some bis epic drops, someone who's actually gonna equip it and use it should get it, but I'd prefer not to get screwed by someone who's just gonna sell it.
---
Fortunately, I'm running primarily with my guild now that I'm doing some of the higher level dungeons (BRD) so it's likely not gonna be a problem for me
---
We don't have a vendor in our main city that literally sells every quest recipe available to our side... That might have something to do with it.
---
It's a weird feeling, isn't it. I occasionally go look at my character screen on retail and somehow my characters there feel, I don't know, overwrought? I have this big roster of cool characters dripping with power and awesomeness, but they feel kind of empty and fake. I have all these great memories with some of them that I've had since the early days as well, but I feel kind of disconnected to them now, whereas my classic characters feel more authentic. I know there are good reasons for this and that I'm not alone, but I'm still surprised that feeling is so pronounced.
---
Yes. This isn't like hit, where you want to get to the cap (6 or 9%) and where any weapon skill that isn't at 300 or 305 is a waste as it doesn't give a full %.
---
There is no cap on crit whatsoever, and you benefit from crit massively, as your crits do 230% damage instead of 200, thanks to talents in MM. You don't want to reach the "crit cap", you just want as much of it without ignoring your other stats. You don't need a full crit % to gain benefit from it. Someone at 23 or 23.02% will have similar crit rates, just like someone at 23.94 or 24% will have similar crit rates.
---
whoosh
---
And dispels too.
---
Should just have reposted the original video instead of ripping it actually.
---
Druids levelling feral have 0 down time too. If you level as a restokin, prepare for some Down time:)
---
A lot of what killed the game were fan requests, people keep blaming blizzard but things like LFG/LFR and flying mounts were super requested back in the day and people were very happy when they came out. It's tough to release a feature then go back on it. Same with class balance, people bitched and moaned for patches to balance classes and bitched and moaned about their class not being able to do as well against certain match ups to the point where every class has ended up the same.
---
Blizzard could have handled things better and seemed to end up out of touch with what people wanted but a lot of the bad changes had their roots in them trying too hard to listen to the player base.
---
Good luck raiding successfully with that mentality
---
Which is still enough to support buying your skills and one of tailoring or enchanting.
---
You're on a server where everyone is in your position - trying to pay for training, a mount and skills. Mudflation hasn't happened yet.
---
My guild runs loot council and it works fine. Your gear determines whether you receive the upgrade. Someone who needs the upgrade more than you will receive it. There is an add on that helps it all work smoother. Loot distribution should be tracked and open to all guild members.
---
Edit: a couple weeks ago I rolled against an officer for an item. So it’s not like officers are all getting decked out first.
---
Most of the links work, I would suggest taking a look at the screenshot gallery. Its hilarious.
---
Edit: Website... lol
---
Asking for advice instead of just showing up and waiting for things to go wrong will take you a long way
---
You can't get wep skill when you're Eskhandar's though.
---
If you don't have 305+ wep skill then you're going to glance hella lot, plus you will need 9% hit from gear which is too many stats wasted with the gear.
---
Ideally you're a human with swords/maces or an orc with axes. If you're another race or use another weapon combination you'll use Edgemaster's Handguards which adds +7 skill to axes, swords and daggers.
---
So the only upside with Eskhandar is that it's pretty fast and has higher dps than blues, it's not a great weapon overall
---
Defense is for tanks it’s completely useless for a mage. Sell it.
---
You are squishy and shall remain so forever!! The ring is a tank item, pretty useless to you, get the sweet golds for it.
---
Really? There is large group of adult men playing WoW off their step son's computer? Our generation is more fucked than I thought.
---
Why do you assume he is white?
---
Well it really depends on the server im on the latin american one and people are poor as fuck and dont value anything, a righteous orb is 20g, a golden pearl 5g, arcanite goes for 28g people are poor as fuck. The only thing that sells quite nicely are pots but its a slow process because not that many guild are raiding atm
---
Yeah... it's been fun but honestly compared to the plethora of newer games, consoles, etc.. it's really starting to wear off on me. Think I'll take a break well see if I ever come back
---
SWTOR’s first raid was pretty epic too, mostly from a lore and mechanics perspective. It was a big lacking in scale, kinda small (5 bosses).
---
Lol that's perfect
---
Same with silk. Use that time between pulls and while waiting for zeros constructively
---
Then reserve the first orb and stop being greedy..
---
It's great for fury dps
---
*laughs in Ironfoe*
---
Hunters can use 2H weapons. They can use anything.
---
So you have to take into account that enemies have longer "reach" in classic, and stay at the edge of their attack radius.  In the 1.9 vs 3.8 attack speed example, you would aim to dodge every other hit.  Its something you gotta get a feel for.
---
I like your ideas. It’s a shame you started your comment by insulting to be idiots, people who don’t think like you...
---
Even a great tank can do little against dps who attack as soon as you pull, refuse to focus the same target as you, pull before you do and expect you to pull aggro off them... I let people die  now it's so frustrating
---
If I accept your different opinion and then immediately need on your bis I’m sure you’ll be thrilled because of how logical it was.
---
I've mained a healer since vanilla, and fucking with groups who treat you like a servant is one of my favorite things to do when I'm not actively doing new content.
---
so it all sucks
---
would it even be worth to invest that much of time and gold into a mount then? 
---
I mean whats the point in spending so much time if i dont get out as much by walking faster
---
No they don't have different rules. You just make them up because you are a shitty ninja looter.
---
Like do you also ninja away the quest books in DM? Like is the priest fucked because his book is worth more than druid? Do you ninja all the BoE, even if they only worth sub 10 gold? Why can you ninja them to sell them but I can't ninja your BoP to sell them for gold?
---
Where should a level 42 orc warrior be levelling?
---
I don’t think heroic is in and of itself a bad thing, as long as it’s mechanically sound. As in, the means by which you activate heroic modes are made well.
---
Like I said, Flame Lev and Yogg had played controlled levers that literally put mechanics and difficulty in their hands, but ever since then it’s been “click box make harder”.
---
Looks like either tukui or maybe elvui

---
It's good for your level but at 60 it will be a terrible tank weapon, but prebis in offhand for duelwield. So if you don't want to duelwield at 60 then sell it. If you do want to play duelwield at 60, then use it for tanking now and keep it for offhand IMO.
---
Probably close to 6 between both quests.  And one spirit res at the end.  Lol
---
&gt; What I don't get is loot council. Why would anyone ever be okay with that? I never got this far back in vanilla so I am actually clueless here. Am I misunderstanding something about it? It seems like an extremely obvious bad idea
---
As someone that stopped playing in TBC and only used rolls/DKP in raids, coming back to Classic where loot councils are a thing was a new experience for me. I joined a raiding guild and attended my first MC assuming that it would be rolls or DKP which were the usual in Vanilla, but it turned out that it was a loot council and 90% of the members had no say in where the loot went. After a boss died, the officers went quiet for a bit and the loot was just handed out, typically to the more senior players. 
---
And just like you, I thought it was complete bullshit. 
---
I was a newcomer to the guild, barely knew anyone and hadn't really had time to establish any relationships with the officers or GM, so I figured that there was no way that I'd get any loot, and in my first MC, I got nothing. I was honestly close to finding another guild because I believed this system was complete bullshit and the leaders would only award items to their friends.
---
Then we did Onyxia, and Netherwind Crown dropped. 8 mages in the raid, all of them wearing blue/green helms, one of them being the GM and two officer mages. And the crown went to me, a newcomer with almost no interaction with the loot council.
---
I had no idea why, or how, but I got a PM from one of the loot council with a simple message "congrats dude, you've been putting in a solid effort and deserve it". 
---
Over the next two MC runs I got Arcanist Gloves and Arcanist Robes, and I'm next in line for the next T1 set piece that drops to complete the 3 piece combo. 
---
I started to realize how a good loot council worked, and why it was so effective. It rewarded the players that put in solid efforts, contributed to the guild, and prioritized the guild over individual loot, which in turn allowed us to access more content faster. We now run 2x 25man Onyxia raids because our tanks are equipped enough to handle it, and the DPS is sufficient to burn her down.
---
&gt;I get it, if you have a knowledgeable, lawful-good guild leader then it would be the best system to have, but come on, I wasn't born yesterday.
---
I think this is the most important part, if a guild is based on good and honest leadership the loot council will work.
---
But if there's any shred of nepotism or unfairness, then it will collapse the entire guild, and I think this is what encourages them to really work, because no one is going to stay in a guild if they see the favored members always getting the best loot. 
---
There was some initial drama (as you can imagine) after the first few MC raids where some people didn't get loot, they left and found another guild hoping for better drops. I recently talked to them and it turned out they struggled to clear up to Garr and that he's weeks away for enough DKP for any of the good warrior drops. 
---
&gt;Why would anyone in their right mind want to gear up someone else's friend group and then maybe, several weeks or possibly months later, get a loot if the council doesn't feel like vendoring it for themselves? 
---
I know it's not the same for everyone, but I got my first epic from a loot council despite never interacting with any of them on my first Ony run after one full MC clear. 
---
I'd say that if you wait several weeks/months for loot, that you are probably not in a guild with a fair loot council (Unless drops are really unfortunate).
---
&gt;you were the last of a particular class to join a raid team, you would have to do raid after raid, gearing up the other 7 (or however many) of your class before you ever see anything at all, right? 
---
I think it depends on the loot council/guild, but in general they aim to give items to who will benefit from it the most, so that you can complete content faster and more effectively. 
---
&gt;Raiding seems fun and I want to do it, but I want to play my character rather than put in actual work every week to gear up some asshole I don't know.
---
Ultimately I think it will always be a tough call, but I do think the loot council can work if the leaders aren't just kitting out their favorite players. 
---
I can honestly say that now I prefer it over DKP, there's nothing worse than spending like 20+ hours raiding to get an item you really want, spending all your DKP, then watching next week as the same item goes for like 1/10th the DKP and realizing you basically wasted a bunch of hours for points that you didn't need to.
---
all of the animations and models in this video were made by someone else you know? just like the other videos he makes it's just other peoples content
---
&gt; Human 
---
&gt; Windfury
---
Choose one.
---
"should be no tank deficit" 
---
but also
---
"get psts asking if you can tank"
---
Omg this is great. Honestly what's deserved
---
Gear as well, theres much more spell power gear out theres now compared to vanilla wow.
---
It is well documented that we are playing a pre TBC patch where content was nerfed, before the talent changed. Knowledge does not compensate for gear gaps. Your frost bolt whilst wearing pre raid BiS doesn't suddenly hit like you are wearing tier 2 just because you know the rags fight
---
Everyone needs, no chance of someone winning and not equipping.
---
Your situation doesn't know his new one.
---
That’s the point... the advantage of human is that they do NOT have Windfury and therefore will not instantly pull threat and die.
---
I used to follow this rule as well - allowing people who actually need BoEs to need them while expecting people who don't need them to greed.
---
But after a few bad experiences (mostly hunters) who tried to argue they needed almost everything, I switched to all need on BoEs.  It removes the subjectiveness and makes it fair for all.
---
Right on man, social anxiety fucking sucks, I try to cope with it every day as well and classic helps a lot for sure :)
---

---
It seems your progress is hurting you the most. 10 hours is quite slow for low 40s and would burnout anyone.
---
* You're always going to run out of quests. Grind mobs on your way to and back from quests. You're going to have to grind anyway at some point. It's better to do a little bit of grinding everywhere than to be forced into a full level worth of grinding.
---
* Be efficient. Use your life and mana as resources. Ideally, your life and mana will drop slowly (and equally) over the course of 5-6 pulls.
---
   * Serpent Sting + Immolation are extremely mana-efficient. Start a fight with both, and only use auto-attacks afterwards to let your mana regen kick in.
---
   * Send your pet on one mob, and pull an another mob on you. Alternate your auto-attacks between the 2 as ranged and melee attacks don't share cd.
---
   * Play with your pet's aggro. If you're careful, it can easily hold aggro on two mobs at the same time. Multishot is very efficient if it hits 2 mobs.
---
* Gear up wisely. Most of your damage comes from your pet, serpent sting and immolation trap. Those are all independant from your attack power. There's really no reason to go all out for agility/AP before 60 as it just makes you less efficient. You will run out of mana faster, and pull aggro more often than necessary.
---
   * Value Agility, Intellect and Spirit somewhat equally.
---
   * There are quite a few good Intel/Spirit blues on the auction house that will go for less than a gold, while Agility-based blues are impossible to find under 10g.
---
The gold won’t come easy regardless of professions/class. Herbalism doesn’t really start making a profit until mid-40 range with Blindweed and above. Skinning is passive gold while leveling, but it is something that just kind of accumulates as you go.
---
At 40 I grinded enough gold for two character’s mounts doing the 55 silver repeatable quest in Desolace. Like I said though, it is Horde only, but it is a pretty solid way of earning a somewhat set amount. Yes it will take a few hours, but it beats aimlessly wondering around wasting time trying to get a few gold here a few gold there.
---
Stranglenam?
---
I get what you're saying. Sometimes I kite away from mobs and they still hit me twice anyway. I assume it's easier on low ping but that mine is pretty high because of where I live. That might be the issue for you.
---
Get her to ground him on some trumped up charge. "No computer for a week, young man!"...   
---
Frame him if you have to.
---
not really but the entire set drops in the same dungeon and is pretty good for what it is
---
Yeah but to me sacrificing how your character (that you will be staring at for 20+ hours per one) looks or lore aspects of them for some 5% boost is so anti MMORPG elements that it makes me sad people do it - I think the game would be much better and enjoyable overall if people picked the race they personally like the most instead of min maxing in an easy game. (People who legitimately love gnomes good for y'all I hope you enjoy it and have fun! :] )
---
Expecting someone to do something for you just because YOU need it - now that's toxic. There's 0 reason for wars to go Strath Live.
---
Don’t worry he probably got burnt out at mid 30s and is salty. Grats on ur 60 :)
---
I have swing timers and am always strafing but still seem to be facing the wrong direction at times.
---
Because most muricans think everything below U.S. is mexico and i find that very discriminatory
---
Even though he went full neckbeard with "I had you blocked for a week", it is annoying when people need validation for dings and gear in gchat
---
No one is a troll lol. You just dont accept my opinion. They dont have to have anyone in their group they dont want for ANY reason. Doesnt matter if his spec was viable or not. Thats a mentality thats been in the game since its release.
---
The best is to pop around to different areas as new quests open up, but at 42 you an safely visit Ferelas, Tanaris, Hinterlands, Badlands and Swamp of Sorrows.
---
I once believed what you just said, too. The concept of blacklisting people, to show the whole server who the bad guys are so they won't easily find groups anymore. Sad truth is, that's BS and not reality. People don't care about blacklists. Yes there can be niche cases, but I'm talking vast majority. Hardcore players prefer the all-need system to prevent ninjas, so no elitist player will even look at your oh-so-feared blacklist. And the casual players who usually don't form groups don't have any meaningful impact on this topic as well.
---
Rested xp more like it. Game has been out for 2months lol
---
That's pretty smart. Might have to work se of those in.
---
That’s not true at all. In vanilla it was Need on all BoE’s because they are of equal value to everyone and everyone worked for them. I even remember it being more well known back then than it is now and being less of an issue. There have been wonderful explanations above as to why this is fair for all, but I guess you can keep on choosing to ignore them and freak out next time someone “ninja’s” the 500g you want handed to you on a silver platter. Pathetic
---
Cheers bro &lt;3 Already giving FF XV a try which I've been putting off for way too long, esp with my fav red mage from the retro games in the game now too, 10 hours in and loving it thus far, and groups arint full power power-mad party leaders that will ninja gear they cant use with the justification of "well that's what everyone else does". Feel like an idiot I waited till now to try it, but better late then never.
---
Sell it or put it in bank for a tank twink item.
---
Thanks for the advice, I recently got all new great gear at 40 dps made a huge jump in power between that, new weapon and the latest bullet upgrade. But as far as pulling mobs that's one thing it seems almost impossible to do, if I pull more than one thing that's a death sentence, maybe get away with 2 pulled but 3 or more no way
---
Yeah it's broken ATM.
---
Take an extra 5  or so mins gor golemlord and yeah sure, but whos gonna do that, done 1 full* run where we skipped arena and golem/guzzler and darkvine. Not complaining as i got the healing mh/oh from it.
---
And are great for utility. Problem is they go oom fast.
---
It's 3am in Barrens Chat. Do you know where your wife is?
---
This is amazing how did u make this
---
No, you're also going to have majority white damage as Dagger, unless the dagger is way better than the rest of your gear.
---
&gt;Druids are known for having quite possibly the slowest time-to-kill of any class
---
No they're not, cat can do some very decent burst
---
800 stacks at 50 rep a stack is is 40k rep
---
That's friendly honoured and revered.
---
How do you level a troll to 60 being only friendly with orgrimmar?
---
Guess I don't hang here as much as you or at least not in new because I have never seen it. Thought I had a somewhat original idea when I noticed I had a quest to turn in to Chromie at 95% exp at lvl 59.
---
I'll check the posts before sharing a personal achievement again.
---
who cares the content can be cleared with 20 people does it matter if you have 39 instead of 40?  lmao
---
Three things: 
---
1) 40 people aren’t even required to kill the current bosses. 
---
2) 40 people playing whatever they want could and probably would include plenty of of optimal specs too. 
---
3) quite honestly you probably could clear current raids with all meme specs. Stop pretending like you have to optimize to clear anything.
---
Well, I can’t speak for druids, but the best dungeon tanking spec for warriors is standard 31/20/0 (read: arms), so this is not the case.
---
I didn't know we had a mounted division.
---
but the more time i have to invest in that, like leveling up a new profession, the less worth it becomes to get a mount in the first place
---
Yepp, this is how you save action bar (and keybind) space
---
Naxx was turned right down so that your average player could go in and actually play the end game - while I did get to do all the other WoW raids, one major flaw with early WoW was that raiding was basically for the very few people who could carve a LOT of time and effort out, which I never agreed with. Everybody should be able to raid to at least some degree.
---
But yes the later raids were a significant increase of challenge.
---
If you're having this much trouble as a BM hunter, you probably wouldn't be having fun as an AOE mage. AOE grind is an extremely boring grind, but also a lot harder to pull off then auto-shoot.
---
The little ones heard a streamer incorrectly say the term and now think they are cool if they repeat it.
---
This is a repost, but hell I have to upvote it anyway. It is too perfect.
---
My main is level 35 and I have 82g. I do have another alt (51 priest on a different server) but I have no idea what gold he has as I haven't played him in two weeks.
---
On my main, i've been selectively training skills. If I had trained everything, I would have vastly less than 82g.
---
You don't have sweeping strikes as fury. You have WW every 10 seconds and then cleave.
---
Does blacklisting block ingame mail? Cause that might work
---
I always try to adjust my pace to the group. I start slow so I can keep an eye on things. If we're doing fine and mana is good I'll start another group as we're finishing the last mob of the first group. If we're struggling I'll slow it down and see where we can improve. A lot of WOW players are too fragile for feedback so that is the biggest problem I run into. Probably the most frustrating thing is that when I am playing as DPS I can use hamstring and intercept to manage runners, but when I'm tanking it requires stance changes that I don't want to do (and shouldn't have to, that's the DPS' job) to slow down mobs who are about to run, and when DPS aren't doing that it makes the entire experience a shitshow instead of a well oiled machine.
---
Fishingbuddy
---
Damn, yeah I think I'm going to take a week off and see how I feel, might just drop this game honestly
---
My first Onyxia guild was with my brother's top 100 retail guild. Tons of people in bis, highly competent all around, etc. Took us five pulls because every pull had 3+ deep breaths. 
---
I'm with a new guild of competent but not hardcore people. We just killed her for the fourth time, and we've seen a total of _one_ deep breath.
---
Rng, man.
---
Depends if you want to reset/vendor/mail/level professions etc. But you're right Mages do have it easier than other classes at least for dungeon grinding I'd say.
---
There is also no rule from me needing BoP items to sell them. Blizzard will not punish anyone for that. You are still a ninja looter. Same way you are one by needing BoE to sell them.
---
Gutgore Ripper &amp; Distracting Dagger. I had most BS damage when I just got the ripper, but as my armor improved autoattacks overtook it.
---
Ahh so bunch of kids declaring it means X instead of Y and everyone in their circles doing the same, mistaking that for meaning the whole world agrees?
---
Eh fair enough. We all did the same stupid shit when we were kids.
---
My kind of healer. If the priest or warlock wants to push all their buttons and dot everything even when I have no sunders on it, they'd better be able to tank it. Especially because I can't be abandoning threat generation on 2-3 other mobs to go chasing after whatever they pulled and taunt it, because that puts the healer at risk.
---
Found the fury warrior
---
Go focus on school kid.
---
He's a good guy, not a saint.
---
Too bad they're gonna use the nerfed zerg rush version.
---
Desolace, start a museum containing only rexxar
---
If I had to guess? Rogue.
---
Well ya you are missing out on a huge chunk of mitigation if you try to tank some of these higher dungeons without a shield. You can get away with it in anything less than ZF, if the heals are good and don't mind.
---
That is true, but if that were the case I could list that item on the AH for insane amounts of money then. No matter how you slice it a BoE is has just as much value for any single individual, regardless of whether they equip it or not.
---
What addon gives you the heal text ?
---
People get humour, you're just saying something others are saying 100% seriously. Where are your social antennas?
---
Reserving is fine if you tell everyone beforehand
---
I really enjoyed collecting mounts outside of raidtime. But now when even the coolest mounts are easily obtainable by anyone none of them feel special.
---
And no one has problems if people state their shitty rule at the start. Problem is that there are a lot of ninja looter here who think their rule is the standard. Which it isn't.
---
alliance here so cant do that. Every option that there is would take 10+ or even 20+ hours of mindless farming.
---
With that amount of time needed i would have to walk by foot for more than 40 hours straight to make it worth the time effort.
---
And thus delaying the whole leveling and progression in total. Like for me it seems like just ignoring mounts is the best option. Stopping now to farm gold is useless when it will be much more efficient on level 60
---
Join alterac on Friday night, play for a bit, go to sleep. Join again on Saturday afternoon: still the same instance. Good times abound.
---
I mean, you don't hold items hostage or abuse your power otherwise, and we're gucci. It's not a big ask, tbh.
---
Are you spec'd 15/31/5 ? Because I find that hard to be the case, the way daggers are designed speed and weapon damage wise just means that backstab will always out-damage white damage at least in this version of the game. If I'm geared to have a 32% chance critical strike, i dont know why that would get worse as my armor gets better.
---
There wasn't even a punchline
---
As level 60 Undead priest I think this is the best idea. I saved all my herbs and drop skinning for Alchemy, leveled Alchemy to 300, then I dropped herbalism for tailoring leveled it to 300 got my truefaith. Then I dropped Tailoring in favor leveling herbalism backup.
---
I’d say stray away from Druid cause you might feel that people would rather you be a tank than a healer with no rez. That’s how its felt for me so far, unless there’s a priest or shaman also in the party not healing, people just want me to tank.
---
Why do you ninja looter always start insulting everyone not following your shit? It makes it very obvious that your rules aren't norm and you just greedy pathetic people who want to get confirmation for their shitty behavior.
---
I too would love to know what addon does this
---
Nice comeback.
---
No one in my guild runs with quest reward greens, so I can’t relate. Sounds like a PUG raid. Every raider should be pre-bis before stepping into MC. Every raider should be expected to use consumables when fighting Rag. Every raider should know the fight mechanics... These are just the expected basics.
---
I thought the argent tournament was really cool, and even lore wise, it was entirely designed to be that, a gear up and practice for the final dungeon.    So as a one time thing, it fit well.
---
Make sure your enemies are same or lower lvl than you and not frost resistant. Ball enemies up, frost nova them, run to max range, place blizzard so the far edge is on the farthest mob. At no point should you use cone of cold. Improved blizzard 3/3 is all you need talent wise, though frost nova cooldown reduction is nice to have as well. Skip the talent that freezes enemies, it makes it harder to keep them balled up.
---
If that isn't working for you and you've watched a video or two on how to do it and still can't, I'm not sure what to say as thousands of mages do this daily.
---
Is the idea from Slacks dota 2 video?
---
How many points in Permafrost/Imp Blizzard do you have?
---
But in general, 23 might be a little bit early to start AoE farming since you won't have some pretty useful abilities/talents:  
---
- Cone of Cold is available at 26, this is some good AoE damage with an impressive slow  
---
- Cold Snap will let you re-FrostNova/re-CoC opponents in sticky situations, it's a 10min cooldown, but it's damn useful when you need it    
---
- Ice Barrier will allow you to keep channeling Blizzard even while getting hit, this is so amazing for AoE farming because if one monster resists your Frost Nova or breaks early, it can fuck your rhythm up bad    
---
- Ice Block is amazingly useful for allowing mobs to group, waiting 10&gt; seconds for cooldowns to reset, and getting some time to plan.  
---
- Mana Agate is available at level 28, this is basically a 'free' mana potion that can give you enough mana for 1-2 more spells to finish off any stragglers
---
Once I dumped tailoring, it took me an hour to level skinning to where I can skin the mobs I could kill. It wouldn't have taken a lot longer as alliance (rather than Mulgore -&gt; Barrens -&gt; South Barrens -&gt; 1k Needles -&gt; Dustwallow, it would have been Dun Morogh -&gt; Loch Modan -&gt; Wetlands -&gt; Dustwallow).
---
Back in the day I re-levelled herb (powerlevelled tailoring for the Robe of the Archmage), and it was much faster when you can ignore the mobs for a good long while. Mining would be a similar story.
---
So. yeah. Either accept that you'll get your mount late, or spend a bunch of time grinding basilisks in STV or Shimmering Flats, or accept that having the same professions as ~25% of all clothies was a bad choice.
---
US Eas Mankrik is a great one , if you want a to role on a normal server. Everyone is friendly and helps each other out.
---
what the fuck is a zoomer niw
---
Well if you plan on raiding you won’t do nearly as much for your guild if you don’t at least try for some BiS or hit gear. Why not try to help a bit more if you know you can?
---
Never had problems with druid tanks. Play better.
---
[tight tight tight](https://i.giphy.com/media/T3fwN6Pbm3ZPa/giphy.webp)
---
40-50 is a slog, 50-60 went much faster for me, so if you just push through those last levels, you’ll be rewarded. I recommend leveling until about 43-44 then grinding out ZF to about 50. You’ll get good gear and you’ll be prepared going into BRD, where you can start farming your pre-bis gear. at that point the levels don’t really matter any more. I spent more time from 40-50 than I did the whole way from 50-60.
---
Looks like ShowMeMyHeal
---
Think it would be easier to look for a friend directly on your server, no?
---
Yes. Because if I don't need the item I let someone get it who does. Literally every item drop is a stack of gold in the end. The difference people like me value the spirit of getting new gear in dungeons over personal gold gains. What you guys fail to grasp.
---
In phase two Druids can remove fear with the pvp trinket. That should help a lot.
---
Yeah, but how do you get to darnassus as horde? There is no fly, and I didn't know you could enter through the portal.
---
&gt;  In my experience in BFA we just ran through dungeons with no problems, tanks could easily hold AOE threat if they needed to, but they mostly didn't because people could just power through any fight as long as the healer stayed alive. 
---
I take it you didn't play any mythic+ dungeons?
---
Tanks shouldn't have to do extra work because all most DPS want to do is minmax their rotations. It's frustrating when you mark and organize a pull and that one or two DPS is constantly attacking wrong targets, breaking CC, leaving mobs at 1/4 to attack another so they don't "waste moves on an overkill", and etc...
---
what the fuck even is it? first time I hear about that shit
---
This post went over so many heads lmfao
---
So when someone wants to mindcontrol you of a ship you can try to /me for mercy
---
Respec is 100g total, a significant setback.
---
DPS gear may very well be very sub-par as well.
---
A mage will at the very least be usable, albeit not optimal. A mage will also be farming in their best gear. A mage gets a 100g head start. A mage does not have repair costs to boot.   
---
Last but not least, mages do not *have* to gimp themselves completely for raids and dungeons. Prot warriors do.
---
I don’t think general rules work, clearly, because everyone is extremely split on the issue. SO, the only way to be 100% sure no one gets mad is to set loot rules at the beginning. Each group is different. If you don’t, then you can’t complain when someone has a different viewpoint than you. That seems to be the only real solution.
---
Nahh, could be any DPS.
---
The whole attitude of 'Staying under the tank's threat limit isnt MY job' could be anything with a terrible player.
---
Lol now I'm just imagining some dude yelling at his screen for lvl 23 Jimmy to wave back
---
Hey thanks for letting me know of the typo! I corrected it:)
---
43 warrior on Westfall. I mostly try to run dungeons tho
---
Ride to Darkshore, boat from Auburdine, go through the pink teleporter at the docks. 
---
God help you if you get caught and die though; you're gonna have to GY res.
---
&gt; No they don't have different rules. You just make them up because you are a shitty ninja looter.
---
You really need to stop using terms you don't understand.  "Ninja Looting" means breaking the established loot rules that your party agreed on.  Period.
---
I'm arguing that loot be handled fairly, and you're arguing that players should get screwed out of an upgrade.  Period.
---
&gt; Like do you also ninja away the quest books in DM? Like is the priest fucked because his book is worth more than druid?
---
The whole party earned those books, so yes -- the whole party rolls.
---
And what's the keep a priest from lying, claiming that they don't have the book, and then taking a book every run and selling it on the AH?
---
BoE's are rolled by the entire party because that's what's fair to everyone.   If you win that roll, you're welcome to give the item away for free if you truly think somebody should should have it.  That's entirely your class.
---
&gt; Do you ninja all the BoE, even if they only worth sub 10 gold?
---
Most people don't need greens -- they're almost always greed.  And in the rare cases where somebody actually needs a green to equip it, almost everybody is okay with that because it's such a low-value item.   But yes, if the runs were completely fair, BoE greens would all be rolled need and people would simply trade for items that were an upgrade.  However, most players just use the need/greed system so that they don't have to juggle loot later.
---
&gt; Why can you ninja them to sell them but I can't ninja your BoP to sell them for gold?
---
Giving a BoP item to somebody who can't use it is a waste, because it's just vendor gold.   Giving a BoE item to somebody is never a waste, **because BoE's do not lose value when given to a player who can't equip it**.   BoE's represent an upgrade for everybody, and everybody should be allowed to roll for the upgrades that they've earned.
---
Yep, just change the filter in the link above from 'Darnassus' to whatever faction you want. Alliance is under 'Other'.
---
Wow, thank you. It is awesome!
---
About spreadsheets. I recommend you to learn it. It is super easy to learn. Makes your life %250 easier.
---
*perfection.*
---
Right I forgot about that boat! Explain a lot! Still impressive
---
it is. You're completely forgetting the cross-company involvement.
---
If it wasn't that expensive I'd put money on the fact it'd have already been implemented and as such, not be a problem. The fact you STILL get gobbledygook names spamming you says enough.
---
Also, when they harass a game using one tactic which you then learn to remove, they can easily just harvest an idea which is used in game B and move it over here. Cheaters &amp; spammers are a pretty serious problem that a crapton of money is going into... I really do not know why you think it's not expensive.
---
I’m sorry I’ve upset you all. I never knew that my three words could upset so many. I only said it to jest. It aint all that serious, boys.
---
So you’re a bad person, understood.

Can anyone tell me the setting/add on to get the total health/energy on your own unit frame? And what add on gives this raid party view? And finally, any add ons that add your own buffs under your nameplate while keeping blizzard frames? Thanks
---
See example of first 2 [here](https://imgur.com/a/kZMTOKx)
---
oof
---
Not in phase 1.
---
If you think tanking is like babysitting then try out the healer role. You have to keep alive a group of idiot with deathwish, and if someone accidentaly die, guess who's the first person they blame, ofc the healer. But if you got a good team then you just wanking because everything going fine and all you have to do is casting a heal spell in every 30 second.
---
I think what you're describing is normal. The first tick off blizzard does not apply the slow right away, there's a bit of a delay. It's related to the leeway mechanic that people were so upset about in beta. You overcome this just by practice and being more precise. Get to the spot you want to stand to blizzard sooner so you can cast it sooner and the slow can all apply before Nova breaks.
---
The mages that make it look easy have practiced a lot. Expect your first try at it to be really terrible to mediocre.
---
i mean i can easily right click the names and click report..dunno why its so hard for some
---
Literally how the game has been for years.
---
Link?
---
I couldn’t even imagining leveling through dungeon grinds if it was my first time playing the game. Vomit. 
---
Go out and quest.
---
If the boat is docked guard should attack if somebody attacks you. Once the boat is past the dock Anything Goes. There's still a slight delay on when the boat is leaving that the guards will still attack you.
---
Thats what you get for being a basic bitch haha
---
Well now we know you’re a boomer
---
I don't think it has anything to do with layering, I think it's more like sharding (in the technical sense); not all of Eastern Kingdoms runs in the same instance, and over that mountain range you're transferred from one instance server to another.
---
This is probably also why Alliance sometimes gets a loading screen when landing on the Azshara FP. It's right on the border of two shards, and is so close that when you land your client hasn't completely connected to the new shard which causes a loading screen.
---
I mean the likely path is TBC classic, which means you would get arenas. 
---
If they do go the classic+ route I would put money on them adding arenas to that as well. So either way I reckon classic will eventually get them but it won't be for a while so waiting for phase 3, likely to be the first half of next year, and BGs is going to be the best you will get for a while.
---
It is shocking how a lot of people here need a reality check. You can't force someone to play with you or do what you want. The fact is that the tank is needed far more than a dps is. Why should this tank go with you over other groups? Reserving is basically like enticing them to pick you over others.
---
It's even worse when the tank literally won't get anything out of going with you and might come out of it negatively.
---
Can you post an example of the macros you are using?
---
My guild already farmed 3 lol
---
Hamstring kiting works well on some mobs and just isn’t worth it on others. If the mob you are fighting has a slower base movement speed, hamstring kiting will be easy. If you are fighting a mob with a fast base move speed it will be much harder. 
---
The biggest issue with hamstring kiting is melee leeway. If you or the enemy are moving they are granted a bit of extra melee distance for their swings so can hit you from further away. This is known as melee leeway and works for players too. 
---
Because of melee leeway, you might have to get 10+ yards away from the mob for it to finally not be able to hit you. At that point, when you go back in for swings, do not go all the way in. Go in just enough to land your hit then back out again.
---
For fast base speed mobs, and pretty much all mobs for me now (I’m level 45 now but I haven’t kited much since the beginning because it’s annoying), it just isn’t worth it unless they hit very hard and are slow. Dealing with the leeway is just annoying to me so I typically don’t do it unless I’m kiting to survive because things got out of hand. 
---
Speaking of kiting to survive, a good strategy, once you get Intercept, is to kite out to intercept distance then intercept the mob to get the stun which can help you get that last hit or two you might need to survive.
---
Woosh
---
It’s an older code Sir, but it checks out.
---
If you haven't done Gnomeregan, there are 7-8 quests in there to do. Probably will take you a couple runs to do them all. You'd be close to 32 by then, which would make the zones suggested here about right for you.
---
Got the same problem! This is on my work laptop though. I've spend hours googling and trying various things from the internet without luck, without full admin access to disable security stuff on my work laptop I don't think I can play classic on it. Private server wow clients run fine...
---
Boots aren't the big deal from Golem.

---
This is kind of the healer HoJ. Now that diremaul's out it matters less since mindtap is generally considered superior. The okthor ring is very mediocre compared to fordring and rosewine so people rarely even notice it.
---
Sounds suspiciously like brexit
---
I agree, but anytime it’s a 5% or lower item I’m just as hyped as they are. Gear for the guild helps us all.
---
It’s fascinating how greedy people like your try to change the perspective here. Vendor gold isn’t a waste. It’s gold. You getting a BoP is a waste for me though. Because I get literally nothing out of it. 
---
Again either all need or nothing. Just because something is worth more doesn’t make you any less greedy if you ninja it away from someone actually needing it. 
---
But whatever. Luckily I don’t have to play with greedy people like you.
---
Something bannable.
---
Is BRE even good when bosses only have 3700ish armor?
---
Their point is that if everybody agrees to roll Need on it then there are no ninjas, just people who all equally rolled for the item.
---
There's a bug with melee attacks from altitude in Classic in general. If you run Maraudon solo runs and try to kill Rotgrip by aggroing him from the bridge over his pond, he'll hit you while swimming under the said bridge from something like 30 yards. Same happened to me in various locations several times during leveling, mobs hitting you while you're in a high place is common.
---
The way I see it, the devs forgot some conditions for height in their algorithms when it comes to melee hits. Basically, no matter how far up/down you're from a mob, as long as you're in his horizontal melee range, he'll hit you. **In other words, their melee range is not a sphere around them, it's an big cylinder**. And since Onyxia's flat/horizontal/plane melee range is quite large, that would totally explain why she can hit you despite being in the air.
---
It's not about staying under the threat limit, it's realizing that the tanks doesn't have to aggro 24-7 on fucking dungeon elites that white hit for 300
---
Fear the old blood
---
Benediction
---
+1 Fairbanks. 55/45 horde to alliance. Still basically busy all the time, but not overwhelming.
---
I really liked this thread OP even if it didn’t gain much traction. One thing also to consider is garrote and rupture scale very generously with attack power.  It’s a bit of a meme spec but I love seeing all that damage ticking so fast.
---
I said an incredibly absurd statement, that's the joke. But people on this sub is apparently so stupid that even the most stupidest comments meant as a joke is seen as serious
---
Nope, got way bored before I got to that level. Everything just felt tedious. Even more so because they once again gated flying mounts off and I was tired of re-earning the ability to fly over and over and over again.
---
If a Paladin bubble hearths, they are still defeated.
---
Download questie add-on. Go anywhere with lots of yellow/green '!'. Grinding the same instance gets boring fast. Mix it up.
---
I see
---
Time for an alt!
---
If you are marking and organizing in 60 dungeons then your group sucks. Sorry buddy.
---
Then simply find a meme guild /shrug
---
Skillet is great because you can click to craft the item you want and it will automatically queue up all the extra junk you need to make before you can craft the actual item. Best feature.
---
It can also remind you to get things out of your bank or buy things from a vendor when you visit them based on what you have queued up.
---
Look for the one closest to a 50/50 split, the best is always the most fair, remember a one-sided PvP realm, is a dead one.
---
Yeah DV! Got my Perdition's Blade on this kill, very proud of this guild.
---
&gt; i can understand it, we all need gold. but you dont NEED an epic mount. there a nice to have type of item  
---
You don't need a freezing band either. You can raid without one. If you do need the freezing band, buy it. You will likely get it a lot faster than trying to farm for one. If it drops and the group gives it to you, that's cool, but I would never expect it.
---
.... come on, no one actually bring a prot or ret pally to a raid. Everyone knows where paladins belong, in a dress at the back with the mages.
---
The joke is Dal’rends don’t drop in strat.
---
Nah buddy, rogue here, leveling an alt warrior in which I'm tanking all dungeons and I welcome my dps to go full nuts because I'm not delusional like all the other idiot tanks on this sub.
---
yeah but if you don't cancel you can sell for lower than vendor. that is silly.
---
You know shadow spec priests can heal just fine right?
---
Everyone needing is not ninja looting...
---
How difficult is this concept for you?
---
I would do enchanting on an alt. As you can disenchant everything at level five. So therefore you can have your main feed your Alt every drop you dont need and it makes the enchanting incredibly easy to do once you do decide to level your alt. Also you then have the mats for your main's enchantments.
---
"but I put in the effort to make a group guys" - dumb shits that do this
---
Hear hear. 
---
I am game for any changes to the game the stick to the spirit of classic. You can level an alt so many times before you get bored and move on.
---
On Whitemane alliance right now there is a glut of warriors coming up around level 45-55 (I'm right in the middle of it) and we're in a situation where the bottleneck isn't tanks, it's healers. Also you end up in groups with a warrior tank, 2 warrior dps, a random clothie or rogue, and a healer.  
---
I'm wondering how many of them will fall off as we roll into 50 but for now it looks like Whitemane is going to have a lot of tanks flooding the endgame soon.
---
yeah but you tell everyone to need first
---
I mean, it is technically true, but given that classic doesn't have the BoP on Need feature of live, this is probably the best solution, because you can't trust everyone to pick fair.  That said, I really wish people would only Need if it was Need.
---
What's that?
---
THERES A REASON THE GREED ICON IS A GOLD COIN YOU KNOW
---
It is if you think the rule is standard and you start it. While expecting others to follow suit. I won't do it. But I surely will kick and report you as ninja looter.
---
It just depends on what you like. I get bored tanking it feels too repetitive to me but lots of people love it
---
Je ne sais quois

How?! I always have so many random dungeon quests or at least something filling up my log. I usually have to delete a bunch when I enter a new zone because I'm already close to full. Well done my friend haha
---
Selfish, arrogant, and stupid - a winning combination!
---
Hunters are super smooth to level and makes the leveling experience quite a lot easier. I would recommend a hunter.
---
Webstite.
---
Look up Hakurais leveling guide on youtube. It’ll show you a good way to quest for different level brackets. 
---
And since you’ve said you’ve been farming SM you can probably start at places lower level that you skipped but still give good xp (green)
---
This is the status quo.  There's a small number of people who disagree who make a lot of reddit posts.
---
That's a bold move cotton.....
---
Are the Southshore PvP quests repeatable, or one time only? Is this a way to actually farm city rep or is it just the quick 275 or so and done?
---
Lol... hmmmmmm
---
That english ,, x(
---
should farm the earth shamblers? or w/e they're called they drop essence like 2-3x as much as the air ones.
---
Vanish is a tool reserved for the furless.
---
Wow that really bothers you. Yes King of Reddit I will go back in time and fix it to appease you, my liege.
---
That’s not even that crazy and your lame for reporting him
---
What does that mean when something is  "reserved for shards"?
---
So you didn't make it to mythic+ dungeons, the main attraction of BFA and Legion, which takes about 2 hours of grinding at max level to get to, but you're still going to post nonsense about how dungeons used to be "thrilling challenges" but are too easy now?
---
Thats pretty funny mate.
---
It's not a tech building in WC3, tho - there it servea as the hero unit production/ress thing.
---
Classic can never be no changes because it already has some changes.
---
Done
---
Runescape is not a copy paste situation. They did not have phases of content release. Nochanges, at least as far as I've ever seen, is until P6 is released. After that there's a lot of debate as to where next. We know vanilla worked, people were not quitting in droves in vanilla and as the community reaction shows the vast majority of players still have plenty of content to chew on.
---
Whatever comes next, I would expect blizzard is already working on it after gauging the community's general discussion. Especially now that the technical challenges of launch have settled down.
---
Hardcores will never be satisfied with the pacing. And that's true for retail too. Tough nuts.
---
When i get burnt out I roll an alt, play that for a week or so then come back to your hunter who should have a bunch of XP and grind to the next level bracket for some new zones/dungeons. ZF is fun and you are nearly there.
---
I mean, keep in mind that we have 6 phases and we’re only in phase one. Hardcore gamers may get bore more easily but I, and many other people who are playing, still haven’t hit 60 yet. I’m close, but not quite. 
---
Classic is probably going to release phases over the course of 1.5-2 years. Battlegrounds will be coming, harder raids, etc. At least let the full game come out before saying it’s going to die. 
---
The idea of Classic + has been out for a while, too. Some people think we’ll roll into BC after phase six, but who knows?
---
If you’re bored, start leveling a character on the opposite faction! There’s a whole other side to explore to this game! Or do a challenge like leveling a balance druid or something. Start collecting gear for a BG twink or something! Run low level guildies and revel in their excitement 
---
If you just blasted one character to level 60, there’s plenty you may have missed, and there are so many things you can do in this game it’s crazy.
---
Wow you must be a blast to hang out with 🙄
---
BRD is the Best dungeon. Its dso immersive and well designed. Ive spent a ton of hours in there and still love it.

Lmao he’s your guildie and u’re snitching for THIS???

You’re super lame where’s the loyalty? 🤡
---
Someone else read this with this typical storyteller voice in his head? :D
---
Genious!
---
Reported a guild name on my server when I was questing with someone from the guild. It got changed within the 3 quests we did together, was surprised. The next day I saw they had complained the name got changed again, because they always choose stupid names no doubt.

---
Yea I dont expect nor would I want them tomorrow. But content will eventually be needed. Im personally hoping for the classic + route. Kinda like what they did with old school runescape. Keeping the classic graphics and play style while added new raids that fit in that play style. That creates endless opportunities, where as TBC route will eventually lead us back to modern day wow.
---
Well, a lot of healers level as shadow for speed...

fucking nerd

Disenchanting for mats

Thing missed here (by them): Name reports are entirely based off a simple filter and player response.

It's based around what the community as a whole finds acceptable.

lmao you a full blown goofy dude.

That's a lot of fucking words my dude

Pretty easy to miss 3 sparsely upvoted posts. I hadn't seen any of them and as I said, I'll check next time.
---
Hahaha no, no you're not trying to "defuse" anything. But that said I've stopped caring, have a good one!
---
Auction house aside, people tell me rogues have a good BRD pick pocket farm.  It's okay, but not super profitable.  They say 50g/hr but it's embellished. Though it's good to do when you're watching TV and zoning out. No skill, minimum risk, repetitive.
---
Warriors, I don't know.  The ability to get easy 5 man groups is probably the best farming benefit because you're always getting the higher gold returns of those instances.
---
If everyone in the group agrees after the need that the person who will use it can have it then they can just trade it to them.
---
There is also already a system build into the game. Need = equip, greed = sell (hint: gold icon) and pass = I don't care for the item. The BoE = need brigade wants to change the system. They are clearly in the wrong in this discussion. They're changing the standard loot system for their personal gain. And it's mind boggling for me how people accept that shit.
---
Waaaaay to long, didnt read.
---
And breaks rule 3
---
Rogue indeed, but it’s not helping much. I’m exploring as many zones as I can before leveling my twink, and my level when entering Teldrassil was only 11 :P So a lot of time is spent as a ghost...
---
Ah, character attacks while avoiding the actual discussion.  Nicely done.
---
It helps saying what class you are
---
Smolderweb is good!
---
Theres definitely plenty of possibilities with classic +. But one has to remain sceptical.
---
Good for you. Can we stop with the adverts for terrible content now, thanks.
---
Darnassus. It's incredibly scenic and I don't think the knowledge that I'm living in a city built on a big ass tree would ever get old.
---
A GREAT, BIG, BUSHY BEARD!
---
This is why I became an enchanter, I love enhancing chests
---
yes, my previous guild did that. Was called Come Honour Face, then got changed, so they did Crit Me Daddy, got changed again. Just a bit dumb.
---
I dont feel like we are getting the full story here.
---
It is okay to be new to the game, and it is okay to not know what to do. Just make sure everyone knows ahead of time.
---
Dont ask me in the Grim Guzzler if we are passing by Incendius or Fineus soon. Dont ask me why i removed mothers milk, or where Urok is after Wyrmthalak.
---
When you join a group, you ask if these and these quests are OK and inform them that its your first run and youre not sure about mechanics or routing. Not after everyone has travelled there and youre halfway through the place.
---
Props for the effort. Where is the GY you get sent to?
---
Gonna have to agree with you there, haven't run into a single person that didn't agree with "everyone need" in game, and I've run A LOT of dungeons
---
https://i.imgur.com/DFHzNMa.jpg

Backstory- this was originally (and should be again! :D) a quest reward from a guy in Teldrassil. The quest was being removed as part of the Cata revamp, and having beta access I found out ahead of time and sourced myself some to sell later.
---
I have an action bar that changes based on shadow form. Binds 1-5 are shadow abilities whilst in shadow form then change to healing abilities when i exit. The panic flash heal is the only healing button I have available whilst I'm in shadow form. I figure if I'm not panic flash healing, I'm composed enough to exit shadow form!
---
I could look it up, but so can you. 
---
It’s one item and it has to be within a certain time window.
---
Reposting is never going to be great.
---
I would join as healer to wipefest the party lol
---
Lol you said the thing 😂 😂 😂 
---
Completely out of context 😆 😆 😆
---
Deep wounds get pushed off by other debuffs.  It's mortal strike you want to avoid.  Only need slam if you're alliance 2h fury.  Horde just spam hammys for windfury.
---
Same! You too!
---
Someone needed a way to divide the community of classic into two groups.
---
you can join any time, people joined original vanilla mid way or near end and still had fun.
---
&gt; casual players who play for fun.
---
heaven forbid!
---
I'm also playing classic over retail and I think it's entirely retails fault that you didn't find the content that you would enjoy. It does a really poor job of guiding people to meaningful content because it's worried about overwealming new players.
---
Maybe your a special case then, but it’s not their policy.
---
Exact same here :D I enjoy leveling more than anything else tbh and am purposefully avoiding rested on both toons so I can see more questing :)
---
It says "Horde auction house" its not a neutral one, also %fee wouldve been alot higher
---
personally i like hearing about good shit happening to other people, it’s better than all the post about crying about ninjas or getting ganked by opposite faction.  so ding away and tell me about your fat loots all you want just gives me positive energy and hope to walk the same path.
---
I think people say warlock mostly because of the pet system. But as a caster, I believe it's more difficult than a priest and definitely more difficult than a mage.
---
Actually I need the GEE's.  You only get quest items.
---
One time I made an alliance hunter with a really offensive name. I got to level 17 before I finally got reported while visiting ironforge.
---
Never saw this back in the day. Thanks for sharing, awesome vid
---
Yeah as someone who's been around a while and never really enjoyed trolling or found it funny.. I have to admit it is actually kind of nice to see someone *actually doing it*. These days people mistake trolling for just being an asshole to everyone.
---
Good trolls are pretty rare of late.
---
It's implied that someone got stuck up there and they wrote help on the ground so they might get rescued by someone flying over.
---
Luna unit frames has healing prediction and some of the healers in my guild use heal comm(? I have never used this one myself)
---
Whirlwind better.
---
I mean you wouldn't necessarily oom. Just use Crusader strike to stack debuff to 5, then once every 30 seconds to maintain the stack. Gives you the option of wasting some mana if you need a quick burst too. They could tweak the damage from the strike itself if there was too much burst from it. Kinda pisses me off seeing what could have been as I started with a pally back in the day.
---
A farm on the coast of Westfall seems like it would be so serene. Minus all the murderous robots, murlocs, and Defias of course.
---
The rule *should* be standard. So cry babies like you don't get butt hurt and ignorantly waste everyone's time.
---
There is no reason everyone in the party shouldn't roll need on a BoE epic in a pug group. No reason.
---
Mage yes.
---
Don’t waste your time doing skinning and lw if you don’t plan on keeping it. Switch to mining and engineering as soon as you can.
---
This goes far beyond wow classic and any measureable amount of cringe.
---
RemindMe! 10 Hours

Nailed it!
---
Well said.
---
Hopefully a pug.
---
You're on Reddit. Best to just assume you'll get downvoted for anything other than the mob rule opinions.
---
However this time no downvoted from me, I made the joke knowing full well(though it's still disappointing) that there's some people that'd actually pay up for this stuff
---
Ahh yes the IF trolls, who you would immediately mute.. but it didn't matter because your chat log was filled with "OMG SHUT UP" "JUST MUTE THEM" "EVERYONE RESPONDING IS JUST MAKING IT WORSE PLEASE JUST IGNORE THEM" for an hour.
---
What is the level of difficult to rank these dungeons: LBRS, Scholo, Strat  Live, Strat UD, DM West, DM North, UBRS

I guarantee no one would have forgotten it.

I want to me an unarmed wrestling warrior, which raid group do I join?
---
This site voted for W in 04.
---
I mostly tank with majority guild members.

Running pugs means I can constantly lose out to bis. Running with guild members means I'll eventually guarantee bis drop.
---
Right so because people don't have that specific knowledge he calls them humourless. 
---
Now let's crack a string theory joke and call the entire planet humourless as they fail to grasp it.
---
Looks more like a bot title to me.
---
Especially since this is a low quality rip of the original video rather than a link to the high quality YouTube.
---
This is clearly a spam bot account farming karma for future resale.
---
It's great if you play it like it's designed to be played, akin to the Paladin hero unit in Warcraft 3. You're a hard-to-kill frontline buffer and healer. Buffing and healing are your focus, which is why your offensive is basically auto-attack with a seal. You're supposed to weave melee hits inbetween heals and buffs.
---
Unfortunately this means that in solo play, where there's not anyone to really heal and buff, you're just mostly auto-attacking, which I can definitely understand puts people off. But in groups, it's great!
---
Try jumping and turning when your swing timer is up
---
Did you read the post? OP tried to help him and he was blacklisted.
---
LuL cute
---
I'm using the sword "stoneslayer" from Uldman right now as a level 54 tauren arms warrior. It has 3.9 speed and 200 top end. Being sword spec, i have had some pretty silly mortal strikes/overpowers happen.
---
I have used this sword for 10 levels now and have yet to find a 2 hander with the same combination of raw damage and slow speed. Highly recommend trying it out.
---
What a pos
---
Geeeeeee Geeee! :D
---
The journey to 60 was amazing! I loved it.
---
They fixed deep breath recently I think. Last couple weeks she's been doing it WAY more frequently than before. Probably in preparation for DM, I can imagine trying to do quel serrar quest in her previous state :D
---
How sweaty do you have to be to care about repost?
---
Not that experienced in classic. However I would recommend making a mage, they can offer a lot of utilities.
---
I would also recommend picking something that goes well with your warriors professions. Like for example, If your warrior is mining and blacksmithing, then maybe do alchemy. This is because when you buy something from player there are tons of “hidden fees” like markup, rarity cost, even the auction house fee, And when you remove all of that, you can get higher margins then others.
---
Just went HotW/NS for my druid. Previously all feral but then my gear got out geared by all the resto shit I was given. 
---
Was worried about the transition from tank to heals. But tbh I enjoy healing more. Pvp is more fun as well. 
---
But yeah, tanking does get old after a while and I usually do it if I cant find one for the group. Which is about 80% of the time is seems lately :/
---
Dude it’s clearly a bot account posting reposts for karma to sell the account later.  Look at the sketchy title that makes no sense, plus crappy rip of the video instead of linking to the original.
---
We’re addicted to World of Warcraft,dum dum dum dum dumb
---
Buy an old laptop at a pawn shop fir a hundred. 
---
This game literally runs on potatoes.
---
I think 8 levels is enough for next rank on many important abilities, you'd need kinda ridiculous gear to close that gap
---
I respecced to ele/resto and was able to heal up to scholo/strat as you'll pick up caster/healing gear on the way. I did a 30/0/21 but you can be more conservative and pick 21/0/30. With that build you can both solo quest and heal dungeons if they're your level.
---
Nah.
---
If you are on top of aggro she will fireball you, so that's basically the same rule.
---
K cool, I wouldn't want to play with a manchild like you either.

Lol how? Just because you can equip it doesn't entitle you to keep it. If I give it away, you're gaining that amount of gold that I'm losing, even if you plan to put it on. You say I'm a bad person, I say you're entitled.
---
Someone is seriously reserving dal'rends in Stratholme?
---
Dwarves, hunters specifically, are notorious backpeddlers.
---
Mages are super easy, its basically 1 spell then OOM.
---
Rinse and repeat
---
As you said, bling bling and solo. And professions. It just doesn't feel any good to play it. Sure, doing mythic plus with some friends was fun, a couple of times, and then I'm bored. Started levelling a warlock before I quit last year. I like the lore, and that I find ok, but it does feel like single player.
---
You have no fucking clue what you are talking about and my dungeon clears are super efficient partly due to me minmaxing dps instead of taking 5 seconds for tanks to pull and get aggro before i slowly dps down skull while keeping moon CC'ed.
---
From a tank perspective, easiest to hardest -
---
Dm west, UBRS, Dm north, LBRS, Strat ud, Strat living, scholomance
---
Ahh ok, didn’t even think about the professions tbh, tyvm!
---
No
---
Now I can't even tell who's serious and who's mocking other comments :|
---
He calls them humourless because he is obviously taking the piss out of it. And he got you too.
---
Pro tip: don't be an immature jerk then try to brag about for internet points.
---
ahhh thank you
---
I joined one when it was 3 am and the only scholo group going. Dude got his flask recipe and everything.
---
Got my prebis wand though, so obviously I bounced asap. I can't recommend it, but if you just need the gear and can't seem to find a group it's better than nothing.
---
Edit: to elaborate the dude who got everything was the tank, and tanks at 60 seem to be really hard to find.
---
How can u Even question that. Wtf. Whirlwind dps and dmg is higher in every way, wtf
---
Obvious joke post.
---
Have seen legit LFMs for strat love with all orbs reserved.  Like good luck finding tank+healer if you’re reserving all orbs.
---
If you are taking a BoE to wear, you are doing it for greed.
---
You're so cool bro, tell me more.
---
Wait so you’re in STV and someone asks you to kill and you don’t? The audacity!!
---
Tauren: always the tank/healer that says”I’m so drunk/high rn” right before going into the dungeon. 
---
Troll: either a complete weirdo with 0 social ques or the most chill people alive. 
---
Dwarf: a horde player testing out the alliance side.
---
Someone with (un)common sense finally.
---
Nope. That upgrade for them is worth 1000g. They get 1000g of value out of it when they equip it. Anyone else in the party gets 1000g of value from selling it.
---
Other than orbs not really much of anything drops on live side for tanks. 
---
Ret or Arms specs might want the sword off the final boss, but let's face it OEB is much better and probably easier to acquire.  Crusader enchants however are our bread and butter.
---
Every time I get someone in my group with this attitude it turns into a wipe fest.
---
It scales down the levels so that the party members match the level cap of the content of the lowest level in the group. With level scaling this basically means that you will always be fighting level appropriate mobs when grouped up with a lower level character. For example, if you are level 120 and your friend is lvl 30 you will be scaled to level 60. Level scaling will place mobs appear to be level 60 for you and level 30-ish for your friend. The level sync places your level at 60 (old system kept you at level 120 while mobs were 60), so it is a slightly harder fight for you. Level scaling will make mobs level 30 for your friend. Keeps things challenging for everyone.
---
The best thing i like about the level sync feature is that it allows you to experience older raids like they are meant to be experienced. Wotlk raids are challenging again if you have lower level friends in the group. Of course it isn't too challenging cause your gear is way better than anything you can get at that level, but you cant one shot everything, which is what makes it more fun to me.
---
Did 4 runs, got both, won main hand with a 62 roll.
---
Now hand of justice.. Done 38 anger forge runs, never even seen it drop. Luck comes and goes I guess.
---
It was hyperbole. :) I would've loved to have those 2 skills myself.
---
Yeah that way you can go around mining the ore you will need to lvl engineering and won’t have to go back into lower lvl zones that give you zero exp.
---
No, but I know statistics and statements like that are ridiculous.
---
Fact the changes mentality gave us retail today...
---
Uh you should click on your staff &gt;.&gt;
---
I’m ashamed for you
---
Hahaha oh no
---
I love the design of it. Reminds me of the game box.
---
I feel like Tauren players are the old dudes of WoW.  They look like The Dude from the Big Lebowski just chilling in front of the screen drinking a white Russian and smoking a bowl. All their kids are grown and they retired last year so in between mowing the lawn and feeding the squirrels they run around Mulgore admiring the landscaping.
---
I experimented with this once in BC.  People were complaining on the forums about 2-stack auctions of ores and herbs for the price of a full stack trying to scam people.  I thought the same thing, that no one would actually be stupid enough to buy them.  So I went and posted a few listings of adamantite ore with two ores per list at the price of a full stack (~45g at the time) and honestly forgot about it for the rest of the day.
---
Next day I log in after class and go to clear my mailbox, and am flabbergasted to see that not one, but ALL of the 2-stack listings, had been bought out for the price of a full stack each.  Never tried it again because I didn't want to get reported (and tbh I felt a little guilty about it), but yeah, there really are people out there who will see the item they're looking for, and buy it out without looking to see how much is in the stack or even what its price is.
---
Obviously only if you know where Dal'Rends drop.
---
Yes he got me, I forgot they're from BRD. That's not being humourless. That's lacking knowledge.
---
Last time it was reported Blaumeux was the most balanced with 50/50
---
So a common denominator would be an element which is consistent with the problem, but this problem ONLY exists in groups where people insist on these kinds of bizarre restrictions I'm going to say THEY are the common denominator since I have no problem in regular groups.
---
Risking a wipe in a group with strangers to save 4-6 seconds on a pull seems about as reasonable as un-ironically calling someone you don't know a noob.
---
Too soon bruh
---
This is the correct answer.
---
People are not wasting money on that. Atleast now
---
Oh my God. You sneeze wrong in Heroic Shattered Halls and the whole party wipes.
---
Thanks, for looking for this.
---
Did you miss the [humor] tag? It’s a joke man.
---
Yeah. The true decline started happening when server lost the aspect of communities.
---
When you group up with stranger every.single.time you try to pug a dungeon, the game become a single player game with random named npc that do the dungeon with you.
---
Only, they also abuse you if you don't play as they think it's the best way possible :D
---
This. Great beach front property, trolls are awesome company and there’s a great forest for walking through.
---
What's humorous about that?
---
Cheers. Died before reaching the teleporter and got sent to the GY by Dolanaar, if I remember correctly
---
All I do now is farm in between raids. Once you’re bis that’s all there is to do. That or start an alt. Which is honestly nice, cuz now I’m playing wow less by at least a little bit.
---
There’s also PvP of course, and once bgs are out it’ll be even more action.
---
Why pot at full hp :o
---
Mage or lock
---
Now I want to play Warcraft 3 again, but Warcraft Reforged isn't out yet and the actual game has "Turn of the Century 3D" ass-ets.
---
Because people play a class how they want?  Otherwise why have the spec in the game?
---
What kind of twink would want defense?
---
Similar situation here, the newest Priest in the guild, raided for the first time, performed quite poorly in every raid since then. Of course they got the Eye.
---
Yeessss great movie
---
Our server just got a bump!
---
Can't anyone on an epic mount do that?
---
Nah just keep leveling. You’ll get the gold by early 40s. Vendor those greens.
---
That's what a guild is for man, a place to celebrate with like minded people.
---
It's not a place to angrily shout at people for using the chat for it's intended purpose.
---
Webshite
---
I like your self reflection. 
---
This could have easily become a pointless and escalating internet argument.
---
People perceive the world differently and maybe he interprets a different intention in your action or is easily distracted by text popping up and feels pressure to gratulate which makes him uncomfortable. Or he simply has a different conception of guild chat or the purpose of a guild. 
---
That being said, the way he talked about it made him a fool.
---
Well, to you maybe nothing, but I found it humorous and have a feeling other people may also. Clearly you don’t which is perfectly fine.
---
Mage hands down. Farm DM East solo lashers and demons. From censoring greys you get about 30g/h on top of herbs (if you have that prof), BoE epics, and fel cloth :) plus you can get lucky and get a book to sell as well. It’s a solid farm and instanced so uncontested. I’m on my phone but you should be able to find a YouTube guide for it. I made 500g alone there last night.
---
At least they put you on top of the tree - was worried they'd send you back to Darkshore somewhere.
---
What? Paladins are god tier.
---
&gt; I know it's not the same for everyone, but I got my first epic from a loot council despite never interacting with any of them on my first Ony run after one full MC clear.
---
This is naive. There just isn't that much loot to give out. If you are melee dps the starvation is insane, but any class that has more than 3 or 4 members in raid will have some people that just don't get loot for a long time.
---
It sounds like you were very high dps, or an relative outsider to the guild that the gm wants to keep attached. What you are experiencing is NOT the norm, even for fair loot councils. You should ask mages that are doing lower dps than you how much gear they're getting.
---
C for effort. Do better.
---
the problem is blizzard can't remember what "the spirit of classic" was
---
that's why they kept insisting we didn't want it
---
To me it's just as greedy to say you "need" to equip an item when i could convert the gold from that item to buy BiS for myself. It's just too valuable to give away like that. If it's BoE and it's worth more than 50g on AH, I don't see anyone as having priority on it, and I'd be the first to (reluctantly, no doubt) accept that everyone need on a BoE that's great for me but worth a huge amount on the AH. Only exception being prior agreement in party about such a case.
---
Those are the minority. And generally, there's enough DPS that it's boring taking them just 1 or 2 at a time.
---
Yes. World drops have the same chance to drop from dungeon mobs as as from any other mob of that level range.
---
That's a 50 DKP minus.
---
Also, if you want to troll, use shrink ray on rag (pls dont).
---
I will have to check that out. The Only Ogres I saw said "Go bash fishy. you feed Mud, or Mud eat you".
---
Really weird that you made an account just to post this picture repeatedly and bash Blizzard.
---
Any healers recommend any addons they use for healing? I will be doing my first raid this week and I currently use healbot - but its been such a pain to setup. I do really enjoy that healbot shows other incoming heals to targets, but overall have had a bad time trying to set it up to my own liking.
---
Also - any tips on a holy priest to farm gold? Trying to craft my truefaith vestments and only have about 50g. So far I only really get gold from running dungeons.  I do tailoring/enchanting and they seem more of a gold sink then a money maker. (Dont have any BIS enchants).
---
Thanks All
---
Yes and the droprate is the same. Parameters are always "get insanely lucky"
---
What gold do you get from putting it on to use?
---
I don't really care about healing, that's why I only advertise as DPS. I'm cool with waiting for a group that won't try to shoehorn me into a role I don't want to play.
---
I would bring a ret or prot pally in a heart beat if for nothing else than their blessings and auras.  So hard to find pallies on my server
---
Nope.
---
Nobody said it was neutral...
---
You don't have to worry about Fury Warriors taking aggro. They can handle it.
---
From my understanding Paladin is stronger but Shaman more fun.
---
You know that when I say "DPS" It means I'd like to play as DPS, right?
---
Other people have covered the main areas but just a reminder to revisit Hillsbrad and Alterac Mountain to ensure you have finished off those zones, some of their questlines would still be green for you
---
Tbc ret was okay....
---
Wrath ret was op as fuck but no one noticed for a while because deathknights were even more op.
---
Human warrior with BRE will do less damage than pre-bis, because of the heroic strike bug where it removes the dual wield hit penalty when it's queued. Dual wield human fury warrior is straight up broken dps.
---
so many retail fuckheads that steal items that are gonna be replaced instantly within the same raid...
---
Seriously, the guild doesn't need updates every time you get a piece of loot.
---
And stop fishing for grats.  Sure, tell the guild if you hit level 60 -- but that's about it.
---
Definitely save it when people actually have money
---
That isn't what a boomer would say at all though. This is the type of predatorial business tactic that their generation thrived on which set up the corporate america we live in today. A millenial would be way more likely to question the ethics and morality of a business than a boomer(fossil fuel production, amazon working conditions, factory farms).
---
It works just fine, sounds like an l2p issue.
---
The fact you complaining about literally the best class in the game confirms this.
---
Play Warrior. Farm PLATE Dps gear. Find a healer. Do DM Jump runs. Enough gold for your and the healer. Maitoz is making 100g/hour in DM jump runs atm (you share that with your friend)
---
Classic is the first place I saw this zoomer bullshit come up.
---
Lol I played for 3 years actually.
---
I bet you have a low iq
---
Ok but where did he say he was having trouble with 1-2 mobs? UBRS, which OP said he was farming, has maybe like 2 pulls total that have that many mobs, most of the time it’s at least 4 to a pull. If you have 3 fury warriors (common in UBRS) whirlwinding and death wishing 4 mob packs before you can even tab sunder all the mobs then of course you’re going to lose aggro on one of them.
---
Obviously 1-2 mob pulls are no problem for any group of any size. You’re attacking a strawman with that.
---
Murder, murder, murder... change that fucking record!
---
Skinning and mining
---
I wasn't there for this... what happened? How'd it work?
---
Then it is not BOE is it so just make it BOP. Silly suggestion.
---
Log in and post pics of disco orgrimmar too
---
Take boomer and then take gen Z. Zoomer
---
Is there a video of that bug?  I looked through our logs of MT who is fury/defiance and he still has decent miss rate despite having HS queued up constantly.
---
If you have aqual quintessence or can skin ony, you will solidify your raid spot.
---
DPS job is to do damage. Tank job is to keep the healer alive. DPS are allowed to take some damage to secure faster kills.
---
İ said crafting professions. İ will slowly level them so they wont have much time to farm stuff.
---
My wife's new boyfriend is the same. He also occasionally logs onto my account and says nasty things on the Barrens chat
---
Can mods ban this guy already?
---
Alternatively, go for skinning/mining and sell off skins and either save (in bank) or sell ore. Should give a nice extra income.
---
And do all your zoomer buddies roleplay as themselves too?
---
Spirit Rez would have left her at the horde flight path.  Alliance one is a world away from the GY for a level 17.  You can get the Morgan’s Vigil flight path as a low level by just running up from redridge if you want it
---
Imagine how self-absorbed you have to be to spam guild chat fishing for some grats.  =/
---
I wish more people announced when good shit happened to them, even simple dings or cool upgrades like a Ravager. 
---
People that don't want this are usually pretty elitist and gloomy, it's a video game remember. At least *try* to have fun.
---
Tailoring making bags
---
Man this sub is a dearth of good content.
---
Drain tank rotation: DOT1, DOT2, DOT3, DOT4 (optional), Pet Attack, Drain, Drain, Drain Soul if you need shards, Life Tap. 8 buttons for standard rotation seems like a lot but it's so satisfying.
---
red = dead
---
Still not worth it. Arcane Explosion gets 14.28% of spell power, making that staff worth less than 2 points of damage. You can see all the spell coefficients [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/).
---
&gt;This is naive. There just isn't that much loot to give out.
---
As I'd mentioned, this was my first experience with a loot council and I honestly believed the same as you.
---
Then I got my Netherwind Crown on my first Ony run, so it's just worth noting that it's not always the same for everyone.
---
&gt;If you are melee dps the starvation is insane, but any class that has more than 3 or 4 members in raid will have some people that just don't get loot for a long time.
---
As mentioned previously, my viewpoint is only from a mage with 6-8 other mages in the raid, I can't tell you what it's like for melee because I didn't track those items going out.
---
That being said, there's always a preference for warriors (specifically MT's) when it comes to BiS items for melee DPS, so I can see that it would be very difficult for a new rogue to get geared, my experience is purely from a mage in MC/Ony.
---
&gt;It sounds like you were very high dps, or an relative outsider to the guild that the gm wants to keep attached
---
I doubt very much that I was high on the DPS charts, I'd gone in with no buffs or anything special while I'd seen other mages go in with GFP/GA/Food buffs etc. I'd also died about 3/4 of the way through the fight, so I definitely wasn't topping any charts
---
As for the other part, I honestly never interacted with the GM prior to that, so whatever attachments the GM would have had towards me would be out of left field.
---
&gt;You should ask mages that are doing lower dps than you how much gear they're getting.
---
I will for next time, but with the 7-8 mages that commonly raid, most of them have at least 2-3 epics by now. We've had 3 Azuresong Mageblades drop and one of the newer mages wearing like 40% greens got it.
---
Sapper charge-shield slam one target-keep threat on two mobs while keeping taunt/mocking blow ready for the others that pull away.
---
If you're doing rend runs you can solo tank it, if full runs you should be running at least an off tank or a dps warrior tanking some of the trash. This is what I mean about being bad. You think it's me strawmanning the case but the reality is that I've done 100s of clean UBRS runs. If you're not approaching the trash with a strategy in mind and you think that tab sunder will keep threat you're a bad tank.
---
As a final note if people pull aggro but the mobs are dying and party members aren't - why cry about it. OP is being a big ol baby being real.
---
Saw who?
---
My friends lose a 2v1 to a mage cause they can't break the Nova with ea.
---
&gt; Literally every item drop is a stack of gold in the end.
---
No. BoP items are not. They are not fungible and cannot be bought on the AH. They are not a stack of gold. 
---
Are you saying there is a psychological pleasure in looting something over buying it on the AH and that has high value to you? Well you enjoy what you enjoy, but don't expect people to share that.
---
Isle of Loot'Danas was the catch up patch for guilds that where unable to kill KT/Vashj. After they finally got them down they got the cold shower called Sunwell.
---
Killing KLT pre 2.4 was the highlight of my wow 'career' since it meant we had to progress trough all tiers to even get there. Quel'Danas pretty much fucked that up.
---
Definitely not in my experience
---
My preferred solution would be a sort of 'classic+ TBC hybrid"
---
TBC has a lot of great content, so just doing away with them would be such a waste imo. I highly doubt blizzard will start developing a lot of unique content for classic wow as it's own game and creating competition for retail.  
---
Instead, I think taking a 'classic+' approach to the expansions would be more realistic. With this hybrid approach they release the expansions, but keep the level cap at 60 and scale down the expansions so that they are doable. For character progression, instead of leveling to 70 to unlock talents and new abilities you grind rep and do quests the award talent points. To keep classic content and locations relevant you could treat out lands as 'just another zone', and have quests etc that reward rep for TBC content available on Azeroth. You could also have a system similar to the mage water book in classic for all classes, and have max ranks of some abilities be world drops from both classic and TBC mobs/bosses.
---
Essentially TBC would just be a level 60 content expansion. The same could be done for Wrath. Also, keep flying mounts and just have the requirement that you can only mount from a flight master or something. This way you can keep the basic utility of them while removing the whole problem they cause for world pvp/interaction.
---
Not been my experience at all.  I think you’ve just been unlucky.
---
I'm the exact opposite if I see a low lvl passing me and he doesn't even realize me he is save but if he waves because he probably think that saves him from everything I kill him, other than that I kill every 48+ player I see or any player that is a human, gnome (that looks ugly, some look cute) and or a paladin.
---
Oh just wait for it. If you want to do the PVP rank grind, not only do you need to do the actual grind (which is absolutely bonkers btw) but you also need tons of consumables to maintain your rank, which means gold grind.. which you don't have time for because you're busy grinding honor.
---
If you want to do serious raiding, you need to grind hundreds of gold for consumables every week.
---
Unless you're fine with playing casually, it's all grind grind grind grind.
---
Your comparison is wrong. It's more along the lines of a resto druid looking for a group to heal and getting asked to tank once joining. Just because he has bear form doesn't mean he should tank.
---
That's how I feel too. If there's nothing for me to strive for, I lose interest in playing an mmorpg. Normal/heroic/mythic difficulty design made it a bit more boring to me. (I typically killed few mythic bosses before my guildies would just go away each time since the start of BFA.)
---
If aoe spec, zf 
---
If without imp blizz, get herb and dme
---
you didnt even get that one word right my dude.
---
They should dps. They should also, by rolling warrior, be ready to fury tank 5mans and OT raid bosses.
---
This type of stuff comes up too often on this sub for me to be patient and civil anymore. If I actually thought any of them would change their mind, I wouldn't be aggressive. You liked my comment, so the point got through well enough.
---
As a mage. Elemental shamans and some warlocks. Elemental shamans are almost impossible to get a single spell off on, they can be bursted down with instants tho. Good druids can be a pain too
---
Gamer craves attention. More at 11.
---
Gquit a guild that can't clear onyxia, and join a guild that can. That way this can't happen.
---
People in my guild are starting third alts, playing almost every evening for a couple of hours. If it's a dead server, it's a dead server. People who didn't ding 60 yet won't be doing any raids.
---
Naaa, they share enchant
---
Fishing has brought me my most gold. Some fish sell well (raw greater sagefish, stonescale eels and oily blackmouth sell well on my server and it only takes an hour of fishing in STV to fish a few stacks of each) plus the items from floating wreckage in higher areas sell well too, I just run up and down the rivers and coastlines looking for pools.
---
Fuck, I'm high.
---
It's silly if you end up selling it for less than vendor? And a ton of time to manage auctions otherwise? Canceling them etc.. losing deposit...
---
Is that a gnome I see? Unfortunate.
---
Ah yes, wanting everyone to have an equal chance at getting a valuable item is clearly the sign of a ninja. Bravo.
---
I got a hankering for healing. Made a new void elf priest, queued up for a random dungeon. Got Deadmines. 
---
I didn’t cast a single heal outside of PW:S a few times on the tank. Nobody spoke a single word. I reset it after the run, and sure enough; I could solo it in heirlooms and starting green gear. 
---
I logged out and haven’t looked back.
---
yeah things are selling for WAY less than what people posted about on wowhead forums about an item's value. The game is just too new for people to be burning tens of gold on vanity items.
---
TBC was great in a lot of ways, except the hardcore raid grind. Back then you could still stack multiple types of consumables, so the list of things you were supposed to bring was way more extensive.
---
One suggestion.
---
I got in one little fight and my group got scared
---
They said "you should group up with a shaman with totem of tranquil air"
---
As scared and died don't flow at all together
---
Don't forget path of titans too!
---
Can you back this up with evidence and actually go on what I said. I never said they go through every report you said that to protect your speculation.
---
  Your idea doesn't even make sense, because if it's automated; for example this name, the word girl is used, what I'm sure comes up in reports more than bj, so why doesn't it ban the word girl? 
---
Please show me some evidence if you're right I'm interested to know the facts.
---
Patch 1.3, Dire Maul was added
---
Patch 1.4, PvP honor added. Epic mounts added.
---
As far as anyone was concerned prior to dire maul going live early, no one had any reason to believe the epic mounts would be added to classic prior to phase 2 which coincides with the honor system being implemented, which is phase 2.  If you have any source contradicting this sound logic to assume mounts would be phase 2, please by all means provide your source showing that what I said was incorrect given what information we had available.
---
Ah the egghunt...coming home from a nightshift, run trough the mines and fly over the islands to loot those sweet rep points. The Nether drakes looked so cool...
---
Ain't no one got time to deal with gnomes.
---
Go check out Tanaris and Feralas. 30-45 is always the hardest part of the leveling experience to me(to me), but once you can start to hit up hinterlands and searing gorge it feels much better.
---
And where exactly is the spam? He got a BiS ring that has a 3% chance to drop and was obviously excited about it. Is it really that hard to let someone be happy lol
---
No idea, but I'm actually quoting one of my more recent dungeon experience with a mage (who was drinking and spamming gogogo). People be crazy
---
I find it greedy to feel entitled to an item that I could sell to get an item I need. There may be one more level of separation between me getting the item I need and you, but in the end it's the same. The greed option is for greens and blues that will be vendored, but to me, to feel entitled to an item worth more than 50g (party can agree on price point) when that gold could seriously benefit anyone in groups is what I consider greedy behavior.
---
A level 5 enchanter / AH alt is by far the most profitable character for time investment. Wands, DE, AH sales, supplying your other characters and price gouging the AH. Grow your bankroll, conttol a comodity and get rich.
---
ww axe is fine for your level. Generally if you have a piece that requires a level 10 below yours, it is a good sign that you need to replace it. However, some pieces are very good for their level or prioritize the most important stats. You need to learn your class to figure out how important these upgrades are.
---
I think it's stupid.  Would it be good of me to spend all my money on epic boe items from the auction house and give it to random players or stupid?
---
It is satire. When this was posted I was running BRD with Elope. We had a laugh over it
---
lol u mad bro?
---
Tanking/healing is ez pz. Done it before, tank is spam sunder armour, taunt, rinse and repeat.
---
Healing is pressing 1 key every 5 -10 seconds. ez pz
---
It's from Fortnite
---
I believe they are referring to the Australian National Basketball team which is commonly known as the boomers. I think it's Americans angry that the Australian team made the Semi-Finals in the world cup and team U.S.A went out earlier.
---
Now you just sound like a bad person AND entitled lmao. Must be a boomer, the most entitled age group to ever exist.
---
Dude I hate losing my deviate when I switch to ghost wolf. I forget every time and then once I’m back out I’m like shit
---
Yes because you are damaging the alliance as a whole.
---
panic xD
---
Do you know those "everyone" are also requiring their raiders to bring full consumables to MC despite it being cleared in less than an hour?
---
He wasn't fighting, he just wanted me to gank a low level cuz he was too chicken to fight himself
---
You want the trinket from Golem, not the boots.
---
What would be the quickest way to farm gold solo as a druid at level 60 to save up for my epic mount?
---
Rogues can stealth around DM and pick up books, as well as warriors can do DM:E Jump runs and split the mining in the end.
---
My dude, the group leader should not accept someone who's advertising themselves as DPS and get salty when said player wants to DPS.
---
Likewise, the priest clearly advertised themselves as DPS.
---
I'm a rogue and my friend is a warrior, I've heard that warriors don't need to be prot to do 5 mans. What build should he go with? Would arms be the best for world pvp and leveling? Does he still need to use a shield in dungeons?
---
This is my recollection of WOLK tanking, at least at the end of the expansion, perhaps in the earlier tiers it was different?  
---
I don't remember dodge/parry being very sought after, you could be defense capped in blues easily enough.
---
Yes and it is understandable. But that guy got 3 DPS and expects a healer and a tank to come to them.
---
how did you do all the quests in once run? some of them are chains you have to turn in and come back to the dungeon again
---
and just because you did them personally doesnt mean theres no reason to ever do it again. you might have a guild member or friend who needs to do them and you guys can organize a full run
---
People mentioning the shoulders but nobody mentioning that you wont get HK's from lowbies.
---
But he NEEDS the gold.
---
Only problems I’ve had are the normal ones:
---
1) Mages never decurse without being asked every time the tank has a nasty curse (eg: ubrs trash)
---
2) dps not killing skull first
---
3) dps going ham from 0.1 sec into the pull instead of letting tank get a couple sunders.
---
4) hunters pulling everything in the dungeon, running out of ammo, not controlling their pets properly, needing on items that are terrible for them but bis for other party members.
---
Never really had any problems like you describe though.
---
It does have to be said that the tank is the defacto “leader” of the dungeon so it can be a good idea to run the dungeons as dps when first dinging 60 - if you’re not sure how to tank them.  That way you can get an idea for the route and how some of the pulls work before tanking yourself.
---
Having said that - getting a tank is by far the hardest spot to fill usually.  So often if you explain you’re new people will be fine explaining shit to you.  The reason they don’t offer that themselves is because they don’t want you to think they’re patronising you if you DID know.
---
Same, although i ran all 5 mans and stuff....but once I was geared to progress further on I just gave up on it. I just had 0 gratification from achieving any of it... I used to farm for hours to prep for raids and stuff. The easyer it got to get in to a raid the lazier I got, up to a point I couldn't even put in the energy to find a guild and raid. The gear I earn now is obsolete due to a vendor that trades gear for tokens in the next patch anyway...
---
These guys don't seem to understand, if they'd rather equip a BoE rather than be a couple of hundred gold richer, they can do that at anytime they please by visiting the auction house.
---
Normalization has to do with multipliers, not weapon damage. You still Ms harder with a 3.5 speed weapon than a 2.5, given identical dps
---
What I’m saying is I make good profit, so it isn’t silly.
---
On my Server the best cooldowns currently per day.
---
1. Undeath to water 17g per day alchemy 
---
2. Salt cooldown Leatherworking, 30g for 3 days
---
3. Life to Earth  8g -10g per day alchemy
---
Mooncloth is crashing, Arcanite pretty stable at 5/7g per day....
---
I had 70g at lvl 40 and got to 90 right before I got 41 just by doing quest and vendoring.
---
I feel margins are too thin to really generate a profit
---
Had to do this for a mage farming me runecloth (for darn rep).
---
He was farming me a ton so didn't want to dirty our relationship over 10g or whatever - and yeah he should have sent back your gold PLUS the gold he owed you xD Still he could have done nothing so props to him
---
&gt;RFD this tank needed a 2h dps sword
---
Nothing wrong with that as he'll be using it while leveling.
---
Honestly dude, there’s a very important tenet of vanilla wow that everyone in classic is slowly learning/remembering, PATIENCE. It always sucks to lose on rolls, but at least if the gear is going to guildies it makes the guild raid more powerful overall, which will in turn make it easier to clear the raid in the future and give you and the rest of your guild more opportunities for loot. 
---
Also I hear screaming before rolling helps too...
---
Than how did i get my BC quest rewards and Hand of Atal title furing Legion...? I put in a series of tickets.
---
İ have Undeath to Water and i have a steady daily income from that. İ didnt know that salt thing. İ will definitely check it out. Thanks.
---
No. Most of the no-changes crowd are heavily against any changes. At most wanting separate TBC/WotLK servers.
---
It doesnt need to be great or even good. Just horde.
---
I think only garrote, rupture and eviscerate but not 100% sure.
---
Some right miserable old fuckers on this game... even though I don't do it, its natural to want to share good things that have happened to you with other people.
---
The people who complain about the social aspect of guild chat are also usually the ones that only see a guild as an additional resource to further their own personal gain and contributing nothing past a +1.
---
Red wouldn't last very long in my guild after that second to last comment, plenty of toxic guilds on my server that they can go and join instead.  
---
Side note though, try to keep 'ding' to the milestone's otherwise it can get a bit exhausting.
---
Well the first piece of advice is to stop wasting your gold :^)
---
I Thought it was a joke but ended in cringe?
---
RIP warcraftmovies.com
---
It means he didn't want you to wait for him to drink
---
But there is a lift...
---
Wow, you downed a boss after 83943 guilds did.
---
Yep, I've left my mage parked in SW to buy armor and weapons up to 20 silver on the AH, then DE, then sell mats for heaps more, all on journeyman ench.
---
You won’t get past the level 50+ obsidian elementals that guard the zone entrance.
---
He got you because he is looking for 4 more, reserves a shit ton and even items not in that dungeon. Just accept you were wrong and move on.
---
&gt; it is well documented
---
And you’re wrong 😂😂😂
---
I need me those pvp racials man.
---
This whole comment is stupid. Just cuz I wanna be a warrior or a priest doesn't mean I want to tank or heal. I would love to level a shadow priest but I know everyone would expect me to heal and I've just said fuck that. Your telling people they can't play a priest dps because you want them to heal cuz your to lazy to roll a priest. Your entitlement is showing
---
Yeah, I’ve managed to get lucky to scoop a few of the recipes, best thing ever.
---
Time constraints, being a sunday evening and all. Several people weren't attuned, so was delayed to give them time.
---
Well I tried to restore a quest reward that I vendored thinking I won't need it, and they pointed me to the restoration tool saying they can't help if it's not listed. Dunno, maybe being more persistent would help, haven't tried.
---
Probably fake but not far from THE truth sometimes
---
Spam flash of light in heal gear
---
My god this takes me back. Thank you op, I'm drowning in nostalgia and it's lovely.
---
Altar of Storms
---
That doesn't mean someone gets tossed into a role they don't want, especially if they're advertising for the role they do want.
---
I’ve really been enjoying Rattlegore. Not dead but not crazy populated like the streamer servers. Haven’t looked at numbers but the faction split seems balanced (lvl 60 alliance)
---
Just cuz he posted it doesn't mean he was serious.
---
He is looking for tank and healer, lol.
---
People also apparently don't look at what denomination they're using when trading, because I got 50g for 6 stacks of water the other week. Dude just said thanks and rode off.
---
Thanks. İ will do that.
---
"Gnome: honestly who the fuck looks at the 8 different races in WoW and thinks: "you know what, Imma be a gnome""
---
Literally every competitive Alliance caster class sans Priest.
---
It doesn’t to anyone without TDS.
---
110 DPS is about the same as my feral druid was at that level soloing mobs =P  Not too bad if you can just survive.
---
This has got to be the dumbest comment I’ve read today.
---
I think its because it happened to be the person who had one of the highest EP in the guild, let alone in the same class.
---
Like I said, I know I'm just being salty. I think its the fact that we both put in the same time/effort, yet I got nothing out of it but 4g repair bill.
---
Wat is this from?
---
If you get the living bomb you have to stack
---
You suck
---
I'm sorry I'm not playing how you want me to play. I'll to spend my 15 a month so I can exclusively heal only for you cuz that's what you need. Get real and fuck off. If people want to play DPS that's what they can do cuz it's there characters.
---
Maybe because they want to play a SP instead of a lock. Fucking HURRR DURRR
---
Try playing warrior with the intention and gear to dps with people begging you to tank. It’s not fun.
---
It was probably on master loot so good luck...
---
Can confirm. I have been running Census constantly on my server from Thursday to today (since they fixed it so it works again). 43% of my server is 40 (ignoring characters between lvl 1-5). 31% between 40-59, and 24.25% at 60. Total characters found on Horde: 7989 (not concurrent). So less than 1/4 of players online when I play are even 60.
---
You're not losing anything by passing on an item someone else needs.
---
&gt;I've heard that warriors don't need to be prot to do 5 mans.
---
You really don't, but it helps a ton because then healers don't have to heal as much and DPS won't take aggro as often.
---
Hell, my guild did a 25man Onyxia yesterday where our MT was Fury and we oneshot the encounter.
---
&gt;What build should he go with? 
---
Check out the standard builds on Icy Veins, but anything Fury/Arms will give you a good boost to DPS.
---
&gt;Does he still need to use a shield in dungeons?
---
He doesn't *need* it, but he *should* be using it.
---
I've had Fury warriors tank dual handed in DM with no issues, but the priest complains a bit due to needing to heal more often.
---
Ideally you will be using a shield when you're the main tank for instances, it just makes things easier for everything.
---
I played as a arms warrior and tanked every dungeon with a 2hander, but after RFD (lvl 40ish) he prolly need to use a shield. Tanking isn't that hard, just use battle and demo shout, and spam sunder armor.
---
Funnily enough the group leader had the same sort of reaction. It’s that sort of entitlement that I should *not* play the role I want to play, but I should play the role *you* want me to play, that really is awful to play with.
---
I mean, priests are op healers, and your gear is good for healing dungeons.
---
Definitely ain't nothin to fuck with
---
They're from UBRS.... Are you level 60?
---
My wife's son.
---
I fucking love this song.
---
Eh, i've reported names if they are just bad names. Not offensive but just a shit lame name.
---
Nah, you don't. I mean if we're all being reasonable adults about it, 99.99% of the population will pass on the 5g for the person to get an upgrade, because the person wouldnt have come to the dungeon at all if they couldnt get a fair shot at that item.
---
And if we're all being reasonable adults we will acknowledge that really rare BOEs are just a different class of item.
---
And again, there's no way you can argue in favor of people greeding these BOEs, since to do so would be  to leave yourself open to being lied to and actually ninjad.
---
All-need is the only safe way to settle it.
---
needed 4 for truefaith vestment :( had the recipe drop but everyone needed it for themselves to sell
---
Remember, the real epics are the friends you make along the way.
---
Anathema
---
I using zygor guides from level 1 on one of my alts and I have like 6 quests from different zones that are near
---
Complete or needing completion. Drives me a little batty cause I want to get it done like right now but I know later on it will be completed.
---
But I just really want my bag space lol
---
You need to be an engineer for solo run right?
---
Nice one 👍
---
El brujo
---
Varies a little by composition but expected debuffs include Sunder Armor, Curse of the Elements, Curse of Shadow, Shadow Weaving, Winter's Chill, Hunter's Mark, Improved Shadow Bolt, Faerie Fire. If you're alliance Seal of Light will most likely be applied.
---
Well-prepared raids will have Nightfall up, and if it's a melee-heavy raid the tank can use Gift of Arthas for a big DPS boost. There's a few other useful debuffs like the Annihilator debuff, and that leaves room for Demoralizing Shout and Thunder Clap/Thunderfury.
---
You'll see a bunch of Deep Wounds debuffs. It's not great (unless it's the tank), but it happens. Typically if the guild has a SPriest for Shadow Weaving they'll be putting SW:P and Mind Flay debuffs up, but that's not strictly necessary, so if you want to be a grinch about it you can make a Priest go with a really unfun spec/role.
---
There's also volume to it, people have in the past arranged for guildies/friends to mass report people just to steal their name even if it's not offensive and it's worked.
---
Searing gorge
---
OSRS is a different game.
---
They share, so yeah choose carefully because those enchants are expensive af. 55 healing if you value your role as a healer over anything you'd do as shadow, 30 spell power (it does affect healing despite the wording) or 22 int otherwise.
---
lmao what mental gymnastics.
---
No, you can't buy bop items off the AH. Keep trying to stretch it though.
---
They are from UBRS.
---
This is 100% a you thing, pal.
---
How empty is your life that you spend time making troll accounts to shitpost on reddit? Genuine question.
---
I also like how I mentioned absolutely nothing about donnie yet you brought him up when someone mentions white supremacists.
---
If you're prot spec you're doing something wrong. My guild's MT is 0/31/20.
---
You misspelled "downgrade"
---
Fuck that, Ive had the weirdest and funniest wow conversations with randoms during dungeons. If everyone is doing their thing, be capable and knowing how to play, while also not taking the game too seriously and having fun while playing, is the sweet spot for me.
---
Nice dude. Really got your priorities straight
---
UBRS, I do take the first orb or 40G to run Strat live though
---
I agree with the gold = upgrades sentiment, but more importantly
---
all need prevents bad actors from lying and ninja ing.
---
greeding BOEs leaves you open to abuse. that right there is enough reason to consider expensive BOEs a class all their own, and to roll need on them.
---
I as a healer don't need Briarwood
---
Professions are good, ideally you want to combine your farming location with somewhere that matches your profession (e.g. caves are great for miners).
---
Some dungeons can be solo farmed for decent loot, I'd look up and see what's available for you and your build. 
---
Play the AH if you don't mind being bored most of the time.  
---
Essences from elementals sell for a bit, find out which are going for the most in the AH and turn a tidy profit. I find that the Elemental Fire from fire elementals can go for 1-2g/ea depending on how desperate people are for GFP pots.
---
Try to complete any quests you may have, the bonus gold from completing quests at level 60 is considerable.
---
Well, I think cosmetic changes are inevitable. Whether I like the idea or not, I wouldn't be at all surprised to see barbers, aoe loot, maybe even transmog (though that would re-shape the economy drastically, so maybe not), things like instant mail and so on. 
---
However, I think it's vitally important that the community is consulted. I'd suggest a town crier in each capital city conducting a poll that each account can vote on once with a yes/no. 
---
Would you like to see transmog in classic?  Y/N
---
Would you like guild perks in classic? Y/N
---
Would you like instant mail between your characters? Y/N
---
etc.
---
I’m really shocked at the amount of people who are entirely missing the point. 
---
I don’t want to heal, I want to DPS. That’s where the conversation ends. If you’re looking for a healer, I will wait for another group. The end.
---
Thing that totally happened
---
Warlock skinning and tailoring
---
&gt; Keeping agro was never really the issue in bc heroics.
---
Oh it was, if the dps went all apeshit and attacked different targets. Atleast on a warrior...
---
And HoJ
---
I literally said raids.
---
I did the same thing. After being turned into a gnome, I hopped into the apple tub, claimed "I'd rather drown than be a gnome" and then proceeded to /sit
---
I think its just the fact that because of this, the guild *isn't* being geared up equally with one person now 'ahead' which rubs me the wrong way.
---
Its a shame really, as this was my very first Onyxia kill ever since I played vanilla back in the day... and just feels, tarnished. Just sucks my dude ha.
---
I find anything undead tends to be the noobs or the immature children.
---
Gnome players tend to be the most normal and adjusted people.
---
Orcs/Humans have a massively wide spectrum of players because they are played by so many so I don't think you can pin anything down for them.
---
Ty:,)
---
A miss is not a dodge, the miss/hit is calculated first, then the parry/dodge/blocks are calculated, given the attack actually hits
---
Also there is no threshold for crits on full numbers, it works for decimals (like say 14.7% crit chance - more than 14, less than 15)
---
I haven't experience this at all. I haven't seen anyone kicked from a group altogether. People have every time been willing to explain mechanics to me.
---
That said, I'm DPS and there's usually someone else leading the pack, so I'm mostly fine if I just follow the tank's actions.
---
Being the tank and not knowing the dungeon must be stressful.
---
All the content that is out right now can be cleared by basically any spec, unless you're trying to do a speed run or something I would spec for a more rounded build rather than a "raid" build
---
What the fuck is this
---
Hunter for sure, but any will do. None of them are complicated.
---
