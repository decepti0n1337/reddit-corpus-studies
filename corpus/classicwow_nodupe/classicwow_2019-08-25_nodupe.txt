Paladins will fight you for the 2h for PvP.

GROBMOB ASSEMBLE
---
&gt;I am trying to understand what gives the game this hype.
---

---
Fun. Fun games create hype.
---
Whether or not you consider time spent playing ANY game "worth it" is a question only you can answer.
---
5 minutes uh?
---
Don’t hurt yourself with that PC word salad buddy
---
Paladins are not limited to healbotting.
---
Haha, nah son. I didn't say any of that, go back to retail.
---
Ya'll need someone to run all the way out to SFK with you at level 20? I'm in.
---
Whatever seems fun, yes on a PVP server.
---
I can level it much later, possibly after getting my epic mount (not sure). Then I can buy/farm what I need to get the points. I can also have a disenchanting alt ready to turn leveling garbages into cash right off the bat.
---
More importantly, I'm getting leather right from the start (or disenchanting quest items), which is money left rotting on the ground if I have blacksmithing as my second profession.
---
ClassicLFG doesn't work in dungeons. You need to be in a place where you can access the General/Trade/LFG chat.
---
Auto-invite doesn't guarantee class role it would invite someone who whispered you inv. It didn't work that's why the developer already removed it 2 days ago.
---
You have to socialize with people even if you use the addon. You'll for sure group up with people using the addon without even realizing it.
---
A static server population. Fucking accountability for your behavior. 
---
You can shriek and rage quit all you want, people remember that stuff. I already have my Shit List posted on the side of my desk.
---
No worries
---
I would swap mage and shamans as Shamans use of storms and fire is a very chaotic element, and most mages have a very formal education and a strict code, which I feel lawful fits them more. 
---
Also I feel like druid should be true neutral since, you know, BALANCE and all. Priests could take NG. 
---
Not sure about the last two, but warlocks are deff CE since they pulls beings from LITERAL chaos realms to serve their bidding
---
Thank you so much.  Here is my personal website.  I have a few more wow related stuff there and my professional work.

Also people will be talking about and advertising their server's discord constantly in city, trade, and early noob zone chat channels.

Lol I actually played since vanilla and I would want to play with him! Only one computer in the house though and he has been excited for this since it's announcement. So, he gets first dibs. :)
---
Yeah every time I bring a girl home they usually run at the first sight of my poop sock
---
Till they get queue time of 2hrs and reroll elsewhere.
---
With demonic runes, consumes, mana pots and innervate you are unlikely to go oom in most boss fights as balance. It's only in the few long ones that it becomes an issue. That being said, like other niche specs, it's still not optimal - but neither are warlocks, hunters and many other common specs. The most "optimal" min max dps set up would actually just be a shit ton of fury warriors.
---
I do!  I design backgrounds and props for animated tv shows.  So this is just sorta what I do.
---
Honestly, not a bad solution.
---
Nope, forming relationships and building a reputation did. I had people waiting in IF to try and get in my runs on a daily basis.

Damn,Hydraxian Waterlords population looks imbalanced :(

I'd about all that but the neutral classes was my 3s comp for a lot of tbc.  Resto/disc/hunter.  I love me some aids comps

Clearly you read other people's specific comments or threads that came off as them planning on being antisocial assholes if this add-on would have been allowed. I mean, there's nothing any of us can do to stop you from taking a handful of Reddit comments and blowing them wildly out of proportion to include everybody in the quote-unquote community.
---
I mean aside from you not having the guts to call each of them out individually by replying to them.
---
Can you see how the statement: "People that play 4 hours a day will be able to easy clear MC week 3/4" is different from what you're now saying: That maybe, if this specific theory turns out correct, and these people play only in premade dungeon cleaves, they will be ready at the very end of week 4?
---
Which honestly is still pretty far fetched from everything we know at the moment.
---
I need a male tauren version of one of these to use as my profile picture/avatar for literally everything.

It's ok if you mute it and just read the words! I would too.

---
Healing priests will be super in-demand no matter what. Play what you want. Fear Ward is overrated anyways tbh. Warriors already have tools to avoid fear and Horde warriors use them just fine.
---
If you were trying for that coveted single shadow priest slot though, being a Dwarf could help add some perceived value.
---
&gt; Also IIRC you can make an alt, level it to 5, get enchanting, and disenchant certain items up to X level. I might be wrong on this, but could be a better option to do that instead of have it on your main.
---
In the long run, I will definitely have a disenchanting alt. The advantage of enchanting while leveling is to DE quest rewards, but I can't imagine the profits from DE vs vendoring would compare to skinning and mining, so I will probably do as you say.
---
Nobody can tell you if you will find worth in the effort it takes to get level 60
---
Of course. Being physically fit doesn't mean anything else you do is fine, though. I believe in moderation, but if you're drinking way too much caffeine, keeping yourself awake for days, eating your macros in the form of pizza rolls, protein powder, and energy drinks (or not eating at all), and not getting out of your chair to use the bathroom and walk around at least every few hours, that's still hazardous to your health and looks like a red flag for mental health issues even if you're fit.
---
I dated someone just like that so I know what it looks like. You can definitely still be a self-hating, suicidal, WoW-addicted disaster who's putting their health in jeopardy even with a normal BMI and abs. Being fit is great but it's only one part of health.
---
Hunter and mage
---
Priests are fine in BG's. But Paladins are a pain to kill in BG's, period. When it comes to killing a Flag Carrier or a Holy Paladin crit healing him, it is a suck choice. Bubble FTW. Plus in PvP you would only be spamming one or two buttons to keep a FC up.
---
Damn. It’s never too late tbh. Gonna bring this up with the GF at dinner since we only have 1 toilet.
---
Spirit is a very important stat while leveling, maybe the most important. As long as you're focused on single target killing, which you will be at launch, spirit is king and mage armor is the way to go.
---
the hell does this does even have to do with either the joke or classic?
---
"a clone of what someone did before to great success"   
---
It's the current theme these days. (looking at you Disney) the thing that make this different is that there has been a market for it for years in private servers and outcry from the lovers of Vanilla.
---
unfortunately no.. TOUG is backed up and has yet to send me the cup holders that clamp to the sides. Hopefully soon!
---
Well, whatever you say. I guess you believe spaming the chat and inviting someone manually magically makes you friends. It does not. But you'll see.
---
They made a big map showing exactly when you can play. It's not hard honestly. The different dates are because some places will get it after midnight their time.
---
People have some, and there are a shitload of people, including many who will put every penny they get toward leveling production professions.
---
[the gms were messing around all day as the server was closing](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/106821265980915712/614881872815718535/2e3921ca31d898f6bec8e11c905a27ab.png)
---
Sort of?
---
I have an old buddy from TBC rolling with me but it sounds like he won’t be able to put much time in. 
---
I know a few folks from my retail guild reserved on my server, but I know they’re on a few others as well. 
---
So there’s a good chance I’ll be mostly alone.
---
I’m planning to roll bear tank. So I assume I’ll meet a lot of people. Which makes me excited to sort of be alone. Classic is about the community and I’m excited to participate in it.
---
Yeah, too late to find the fun
---
Edgy
---
Not with proper moderation.
---
&gt;So this is how it works. If lfg is in the game it becomes far faster and easier to form groups, which then means it's faster and easier to reform groups. So for example if your deep in maraudon and you get mad and want to kick someone you can open up lfg find someone instantly kick the old person and inv the new one. This attitude spirals. It happened in wrath.  
---
I did that in classic. A long trek back to a capital city to replace a shit player was no skin of my nose.
---
&gt;People realize they dont need to cooperate with people if they dont want to because they have an says way to replace people. And they dont need to interact to do the content. Just group up and go. 
---
Yeahbwhennyounhave cross realm grouping and your name doesnt mean shit anymore
---
Try doing that when you have a limited pool to group with and news travels
---
&gt;It's bad for the game.
---
No your just misinformed
---
they sucked in vanilla and no one used them  
---
Absolutely no add on existed in the capacity of LFG back then.
---
Whilst I agree, thinks like that can easily be filtered out with Addons.
---
Those fucking spicy sweet chili Doritos... so freaking good.
---
Indeed. Honor among thieves and all.
---
Out of curiosity, how is fishing going to be a good money maker in vanilla? Oily blackmouths and all, right? Or is there something else?
---
yes, race change, faction change, server change. they were all brought in near the end of vanilla.
---
Lol wut
---
Just play for 1-4 hours a day like me. 2 hours in the evening, maybe 4 on weekend days. All good
---
There’s a video my melderon I watched a couple days ago that broke down the dps ranges for all of the weapon combos and enchants, 2h rockbiter is gonna be the most consistent dps but 2h windfury has the potential to be huge damage if RNG is on your side, I’ve also seen guides where you can switch to ele at 40. Ele has the highest dps once you get deep into the tree and if you’re leveling in a group you might be able to minimize downtime and offheal for your group while casting big lightning bolts
---
Wipes being clearly the hunter's fault...yep, just as I remember.
---
Hunter's evil?
---
Nah i didnt.  i was the ripe age of Four or Five years old. 
---
Is that my fault? no. 
---
Does it matter? no.
---
All tier sets on my main, including dungeon ones.
---
That's one of the cringiest video I've seen
---
I honestly don't think LFG is against the spirit of vanilla.
---
That said I actually don't care whether I use this, or have to look in a chat channel, it really doesn't make much of a difference at all, which is why I don't really get why people care.
---
Also, the same functionality could be made with a discord bot or a third party website really easily, so if this is something players actually want in the end, it will happen. But I don't think that will happen.
---
Everyone should corpse run, but if you ask nicely and have a good reason to get ressed then we will see, sometimes people put off their real life for the group which is great, giving them 5 minutes to check on the dog or kid while we run back and rez is acceptable
---
My retail Journey was a grand Journey. Don't worry, if you sneak into a dark corner of a room and Whisper to somebody else that you enjoyed one or two moments on your retail Journey over the last 15 years, you won't get struck down by God.

---
Skinning/Herb or Skinning/Mining. Gather everything, vendor it all (save the Swiftthistle for speed pots). Buy bigger bags every chance you get. Eventually once there's an economy on the server you auction stuff instead of vendor it.
---
I know everything you just said..... there has always been some form of an addon that attempts to record people LFM and store it in a chat window.
---
Regardless of this, people hardly used them, because manually forming a group was always faster, especially if you have a large active guild and friends...
---
Same as mine, I wish she would get hyped for classic, but she seems to have no interest, or is worried about the impending addiction...
---
A lot of people will drop out. Are you asking if the game is still fun once you get to 60?
---
I will be
---
Stormstrike and windfury weapon is the most fun you'll have in classic wow since the reckoning bomb was removed.
---
Get a big slow 2 handed weapon, windfury weapon, and go to town.  When it procs, the burst is amazing.
---
I feel this way as well. Which do I value more: rushing the high level blacksmithing recipes, or my mounts? Probably mounts.
---
Are you a lawyer?
---
15 year old in classic would be a millennial dummy
---
Yeah it's too late. You should wait til the next fresh
---
All alone as well. Friends moved on to sports/vacationing like normies. Just gonna play a rogue so I don't need assistance very much.
---
There will be 4 brand new servers on launch day and maybe only half of the current servers are full.
---
It was then biggest complaint by fair that the addon was going to break the social aspect of the game. On here and on the forums
---
Ripping up curtains isn’t really chill... lol. Pretty unchill actually. My dog doesn’t bug me to play either but is down to when I can
---
Do I look like a shadow priest to you?
---
no harm in trying it out, see if you like it, if you don't like it quit.
---
someone else's likes/dislikes will be different to yours.
---
Someone's mad lfg was removed from the game, and this is your temper tantrum
---
Where is this glorious server of my fantasies?
---
It hasn't been released and probably won't. Blizzard doesn't like to share that info when they've been asked.
---
I'm a woman and I am just as hyped *eye roll*
---
I will be taking my time with a fuck ton of wpvp mixed in.
---
You have no idea how fast I just ran to my computer
---
It wasnt cross realm in wrath when it first came out. It completely butchered the community. It became so toxic so fast. Because people could easily kick and re add.
---
Look if you dont want to run to the capital city to recruit. Dont play. That's how it was and that's how it should be.
---
Typing in spells is what we used to do in Tibia.
---
I am assuming you mean wind screen. I don't think it does as good of a job but it takes up a lot less space. I ditched my pop filter, it was just always in the way.
---
&gt;You're a fool acting like a child throwing a temper tantrum.
---
well isn't this the pot calling the kettle black
---
FUCKKKKK I JUST WANT A TRAP HEALSLUT GF BROS IT'S NOT FUCKING FAIR

FUUUCKKKKKKKKKK

Joy. 4000 person server. Wow.
---
Stay hydrated!
---
1st of all I'm not a BFA babie. I've been playing wow since 2005 and I can prove it.
---
2nd you got the situation completely backwards. The problem is not that Blizzard is breaking LFG. The problems is that Blizzard will break a lot of other addons and LFG will still work in the end.
---
I couldn't care less if they break LFG and LFG only. I mean I like the addon but I can live without it. What I do care is that they will remove a good chunk of functionality from other addons and it won't affect LFG addon almost at all.
---
I too use every possible opportunity to announce to everyone what my preferences are in the bedroom because I’ve made that my entire identity as a human.
---
no reason not to go back to the starting zone and do those quests since they are quick anyway and should get you to level 8 or so
---
I used to raid the whole time between 5-10 fps for years. I feel you
---
Hopefully all the retards wanting to ruin classic with this bullshit will quit after being mocked and publicly humiliated and go back to retail where they belong.
---
reminds me of when I was in kindergarten during recess when you had that one friend that finally learned what "sex" was before anyone knew anything about it. When you'd ask them what it was, they'd just say "you'll just have to figure it out!" Turns out they had no fucking clue either but just wanted to look cool and were desperate for attention.
---
&gt; Once those charges are gone that weapon is useless
---
Oh shit. I get you. Man it's been so long I forgot there were items like that.
---
PvE mostly. I was considering skinning and herb just for gold gain and then swapping to a crafting profession later in the game.
---
I'm just not sure which of the three appeals to me the most. I prefer druid or shaman I think, but priest seems much more powerful all around.
---
Had one too! But it started double clicking one day :/
---

---
I installed it during the stress test. When did they implement needing a sub to download the game?
---
Also, only the person using it could hear it.
---
Omg, dorito fingers on that nice keyboard?? I would never do that to my baby
---
This post literally just made me unfollow this sub
---
Fuck this place, see you guys in Azeroth
---
Do they have a category for classic yet?  Or even a tag?
---
Needs his Hand of Justice, bro.
---
I'm not going to report someone for playing the game their way. Don't interact with them. Seriously how hard is that?
---
😬
---
Ah that's a good point, instead of soloing stuff for gold I can just easily find a group since I'm a healer and grind stuff that way.
---
Ah yes, that is a good part.
---
alright guys what the hell is this meme from? i don't recognize him at all
---
If you're Horde on Stalagg, we could use a few more people.
---
Friends started playing in 2005 at 21... now 36.
---
Sadly, I’m the only one who still plays pc games as much as I did in my early 20s. Friends won’t be playing. 
---
I’m looking forward to playing classic but think it’d be better with real life friends.
---
If she doesn't have a penis, how can you trust her with yours?
---
Sorry windscreen, thanks.
---
I remember I had a level 33ish Tauren Druid and I was questing and this level 50ish gnome rogue kept messing with me. I’m still haunted by that gnome to this day.
---
It's not always a scam. I've played quite a few them back in the day
---
This shit feels like the last 15 minutes of 6th period Spanish (with th meanest teacher in the school.)
---
But like. Times 200 or so.
---
I just want what will be more fun. Lol
---
Can I play Horde and Ali on the same server?
---
I'm Oceanic and there is only a single PvP server.
---
If you die can I have your PC?
---
It didn't "ruin" Windfury at all. It's still the best buff in the game for Warriors.
---
Sorry windscreen. Thanks.
---
You live in florida?
---
I just installed the other day and don't have active sub, didn't play any betas.
---
The pictures had me in stiches hahaha but i feel this works for both factions is a sense lol
---
Spoilers on the name of the server: 
---
The funny thing is that "Stalagg" can be read in Spanish as "Está Lag" which means "It's laggy".
---
Also i never used it(only playing monk) i still think Blizzard should have implemented it instead of breaking it because tap targeting at the time was also broken af and multi doting was more luck then skill and annoying af.
---
Yea, I am looking forward to the quest line as I have always wanted to do it. I am also going to have a Shadow Priest on a PvP server with my friends. That is something I did enjoy very much back in the game. Just like the first time I'll probably end up as Discipline later on as healing in PvP was really fun for me in BGs whereas Shadow was great for open world stuff.
---
Only the night before? I've had issues sleeping all this week. :)
---
No purple Doritos?
---
Thanks!
---
you take things very literally, don't you
---
i’m a NE druid. doing just fine
---
I'm mostly PvE and everyone seems to talk about how good shadow guard is. I prefer undead just for visuals, but I like troll too so I'll go with that if I pick priest.
---
Which is more to do with the free nature of private servers, and the ability to create characters on the opposing faction on the same server with ease.
---
Back in the day most people would have 1 account and if they wanted to play the other faction they made chars on a different server.  As a result there wasn't a particular bond between opposite factions on the same server.
---
Typical Dorian, running away from an argumant you know nothin' about.
---
In case anyone is wondering, this guy posts to r/hunting r/protectandserve and r/the_donald.
---
So I will stand by my original statement.
---
Maybe they're proud pant owners, too?
---
in classic most people were "behind the curve" and didnt care
---
An irrelevant shitty add-on no one used ever? Strange thing to leave that's for sure.
---
Blizzard is just going to label it as a hack and sue the fucking shit out of these guys.
---
It will be fun to watch these software devs through their careers out the window though.
---
Here's my understanding. The option to download classic was available during the beta and stress (even with no active sub). After the final beta the option was removed unless you had an active sub. I could be wrong, but everyone I know who hasn't had a sub had the button missing until the selected an active account.
---
Skeram is more horde according to the polls
---
Where’s the whiskey?
---
I think there's always going to be liberties.  Saying they didn't pay attention to detail when they wanted to have a human party + cartmen the dwarf as if that was an oversight and not by design is pretty disingenuous.
---
There were many details the show got right so I'd agree that they did pay attention to details besides the liberties they decided to take.
---
https://i.redd.it/habtz8j8lci31.png
---
Parts of the addon will not be allowed, but the core lfg interface will.
---
Blizzard must be holding some servers up their sleeves to release at launch. At this point you'd need another of each type for each time zone.
---
For snacks take a handful of nuts every now and then( I like the mix of raw peanuts, almonds,cashews, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds,walnuts and chestnuts )  
---
for sipping have water with a bit of squeezed lemon or lime  
---
and as a go to in between meal you can take at your PC make a smoothie of some fruit (banana, peach,berries) add in a tiny bit of guarana for good caffeine source, some ground flax seeds or chia seeds and oat flakes, if you wanna be extra add in some hemp or flaxseed oil (teaspoon on 200ml of shake).
---
Also don't forget to turn your computer on! It would be difficult to play and with all the hype its important not to forget this crucial aspect! /s
---
FFS these posts are getting old.

We are going home bois!

Not really worried at all. Hits as 1 it will break up. Unless you are in PR. Irma hit my doorstep and we were out for 10 days.

External applications won't be **nearly** as effective at what they're trying to achieve, since the whole point of the internal app/addon was to exploit WoW's APIs to gain detailed intel on the community around them. Without their internal app, their going to lose most of the information they hoped to lean off of to gain an advantage. They can try to organise externally all they want, but they'll be flying blind compared to what would have been, if their internal app worked.
---
Ultimately, this underlines one simple truth. Players don't hold any real power in the game, outside of what Blizzard allows. If Blizzard doesn't want Mafia style tactics to be a thing, then it won't be a thing. It's that simple.
---
meld
---
We will across that bridge when we get there.
---
If it's not anything special why do we need it in the game? This is the biggest lie I've seen about the addon. I and many others dont want anything j  the game that makes group creation any easier. As that is a major issue with world of warcraft currently and any steps in that direction do not bode well for the community and social aspects of the game

That's not enough beer

Oceanic only has 2 servers, ques are inevitable.... REEEEEEEEE

Tbh ret levelling is not boring.
---
I go hard up ret for 31 pts, then up holy to conc and then up Prot to kings.
---
You have a tonne of utility and the damage is very good, since Alliance have clear access to good 2h all the way up to 60.
---
It normally goes:
---
- green 2h mace from yeti quest in Dun Morogh
---
- edge of peoples militia 
---
- smites
---
- verigans 
---
- thermaplugs
---
- bonebiter
---
- any of the maraudon 2hs
---
- dreadforge 
---
- arcanite reaper or demonshear
---
You start every pull with a judged crusader into a seal of command, auto attack, get some procs, when mob is low, judge command, throw yourself a FOL and keep rolling. You never stop and with pursuit you run / mount everywhere very fast.
---
You can heal any dungeon with FOL / HL and a nice intellect set, and you provide competitive dps whilst leveling. You also buff your allies and have a buff for every class. 
---
PvP as ret whilst leveling is solid, you can’t be kites and you have good burst with SOC and a judged command within stun. 
---
I find it very interactive. You don’t just run up with SOC, you’ll be judging, cleansing and healing as you roll.
---
But you should expect to heal at 60. Fet doesn’t do good dps. It’s a burst and buff spec and only has a small role in organised PvP, if at all, since holy is just incredible at organised PvP.
---
Raw chicken can't be good for you... Unless he plans to have mom cook it while he's playing, I don't see his plan here.
---
Yeah, it’s copy-written per his site.  Also states it’s not endorsed by Blizzard, which is another thing people claimed.
---
&gt;equal footing
---
was never a guarantee in classic
---
this is retail talk
---
there is no catch up mechanism
---
join a rush guild if you want to catch up
---
Can easily just post a video of any collusion.  It's pretty obvious if a few guilds/players behave in this way over a period of time.

I remember one time in diablo 2 baal runs I started the shower one run, and right before 1st wave I booked it into the shower and dried off 3mins later right before they killed baal lol. Good memories. 
---
As for WoW, not sure what window I could do that in. Maybe a flight path to somewhere very long haha :P
---
They said they will release one more pvp and normal servers 2 hours prior to launch i believe
---
On Thursday do a meth challenge, and play wow for 4 days straight.
---
I could be wrong then. I was under the impression the drop down wouldn't appear unless you had a sub.
---
Why does EST servers get the good names?
---
The way roleplayers justify it is that that's just the success rate of harvesting them without ruining them
---
I wonder if blizz manually switches realms to full to discourage people joining them
---
I'm just planning to meet people through dungeon groups.
---
42 yo IT guy
---
Had carpal tunell and back issues from work and heavy duty gaming.
---
Started weight lifting over year ago.
---
Carpal tunell is great.
---
Back doesnt hurt anymore.
---
Turns out I was weak...
---
What do you farm as resto druid? Id really like to play a night elf if possible so I'm very interested. Or do you just grind instances for gold, which is also fine by me?
---
Same
---
Nice
---
Thats way to health
---
Rogues would never be a lawful alignment.
---
Yeah this is the point that has confused me as I've looked through the stats. I'm curious to know what the expected language percentages will be on the servers AS WELL AS where people come from.  
---
That second part in particular, as even though I'm a Brit, I've been deciding my realm based on how many Swedes there are, as I used to play on Magtheridon, which was like virtual Stockholm. So I want the full vanilla experience. :P
---
No I'm just not a whiny bitch.
---
I was watching some videos of swifty just breaking people with Ret. I don’t mind healing end game at all because it’s almost a guaranteed raid spot and your constantly on the move. I leveled a shaman in vanilla and I thought that was rough.
---
Broccoli, Athene style :D
---
As is right and just.
---
PSA: guarana is a great alternative to coffee/sugar/energy drinks, but don't take more of a teaspoon in a day, and not all at once. Take 1/4 of teaspoon in a drink with 4 hours between drinks.
---
Only the with with deals in absolutes
---
Yeah it breaks people (sometimes), but it doesn’t break raid bosses :)
---
Oh well not like I have anything to live for
---
You need to take deep breaths and go outside dude. You care way, way too much about such a silly thing in a videogame.
---
Thats beautiful. Id like to see troll male, but this does lend beauty to the female orc amidst all the chaos in the shot.
---
Who's the tank? Naturally.
---
Play Horde, raid Alliance zones? :)
---
Were all in this together, welcome home to your family.
---
I'm not sure i understand the question, but once you hit level 5 and learn enchanting you can DISenchant all of the items that exist in the game. Thats more or less the purpose of my alt.
---
It's good coin when starting out new on a server. Diminished returns if grouping a lot and other skinners exist and if beasts aren't on the menu as much.
---
I should have added the /s.  My apologies.
---
Horde when I originally played retail.
---
Alliance this time around
---
I think I may just drop enchanting after making my first wand. Since I’ll have a better chance of grabbing a greater on the AH when i can get more money or just using a quest wand
---
Priest is still fairly decent for farming, especially if you get improved smite.
---
Sometimes insomnia pays off. I’m up till dawn most days, and tend to run on 2-4 hours average a night (day).  Won’t even need energy drinks, I rarely use them. 
---
But more than likely I’ll be waiting in the queue for most of it anyways.
---
I got a group of friends on another server (they wanna play alliance). I'll be making a toon there but rolling on Stalagg horde totally alone
---
But I'm not worried, I know i'll make friends. Plus I'll be a mage so I'll give ports and food and stuff so hopefully I meet some people that way
---
If you’re leveling with friends you can safely remove priest from the equation as solo leveling speed becomes irrelevant. 
---
Priest don’t level well with others because they need to score the killing blow to activate spirit tap.
---
The cool thing about holy pals is the spec is simple enough that you have time to spend globals finding ways to use all of your toolkit.
---
haha you should see the freezer....  https://imgur.com/oOMeYyQ
---
If you wanna play on launch day you should choose any server except Herod or Faerlina.
---
Hi, /u/aureliusman
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cv1gwg/ask_questions_that_matter/). 
---
It's questionable imo.  Bags are very hard to come by.  Mobs drop a lot more grays, less greens.  Regen is lower too.   Just leveling faster might be more beneficial.
---
both perform well in my experience, windscreen size wins in my personal opinion.
---
Why mail it to a bank alt instead of selling it to vendors/ah?
---
My heart is telling me to go druid. Outside of professions and grinding dungeons, how would I be making money as resto druid? I would assume that farming mobs is not really in the picture as a healer
---
Classic+ not BC or any expansion or raising level cap
---
How did you know?
---
I obviously meant people that are fully prepared for classic, but due to some irl stuff have limited playtime.   
---
People that go blind into the game will for sure need way more time to get there.
---
They're launching 4 new NA and 5 new EU servers on Monday.
---
Retail is a theme park MMO, classic is a Sandbox MMO, both are great at what they do but they do appeal massively different audiences.
---
Yo Joe, I’m gung ho even when I go solo!
---
Thats a logic of spirit i like that
---
It's worth it even if you vendor it all.
---
Yeah that works. It's mainly used for an instant healing touch though which is usually more than 50% of your health bar.
---
Troll looks absolutely disgusting, no matter what gear they wear
---
If you saw a lot of posts talking about the rush how did you not see a lot of posts saying exactly what you’re saying?
---
WoW players aren't known for their fashion sense. If I see everyone wear a style of pants, I'm convinced I have to as well.
---
Did I mention it's like wearing pajamas? Can I mail you some?
---
Leeway is only active when both you and your target are moving, so if you are rooted, then no leeway.
---
So get into the server 25 mins ahead of launch and I'm probably good?
---
wanna be my offhand?
---
Depends largely on if you duo level and group a lot. Likely keep a slow main hand weapon on you for better solo play and a hybrid leveling build to start.
---
Leveling builds are common for most classes. Rarely does an end game spec mature early to be efficient.
---
Played Alliance for two years, decided to roll my third toon as a Tauren shaman and I instantly fell in love with Kalimdor's aesthetic. The ritualistic, primitive Tauren have always interested me, and once I hit Thousand Needles on my shaman I was a born again hordie.
---
I have been staring at Reddit/Discord for 2 weeks straight now, I think I may be going insane.
---
This was true for the swastica too, but once it is taken over, you either stop using it, or you’re one of them.
---
Anyone that claims otherwise is one of them in disguise.
---
Tbf WA is so integral to the retail experience now that out of all the addon devs, blizzard is most likely to listen to them.
---
They still won't, though (for good reason).
---
And those idiots get blocked and the server ends up knowing they are trash by word of mouth.
---
Dint blame a tool for a persons actions blame the person.
---
Regardless of the tool an arsehole will be an arsehole you cant force them to play nice with you that's just wishful thinking
---
That is exactly what i am building. Not something which everyone will use. A way to find like minded people. I also don't agree with people stating that only way to do it right is to use ingame chat.
---
Sure, i will play the game, meet people, have guild, friends. But you can always use some service, be it third party, m+ like finder, ingame chat etc.
---
Having it 3rd party is best solution in this case, it means very few people will use it (out of whole playerbase) so game will stay like people want to "true vanilla experience" and meet people in the world or in lfg chat
---
My doggo passed away earlier this year sleeping next to me in bed. A picture of him is framed and sitting on top of my pc so he’s always with me.
---
It can be hella meme-worthy for Hunters in PvP.  
---
Get those, Barov whistle and one other pet trinket/proc and you can basically release a zoo at people.
---
&gt;Should anyone attempt to organize players to go against the mafia they will in turn call in more players. Stories are they could get 10+ members into the crater within minutes. Most of them had Gadgetzan set as their hearth.
---
And within a few more minutes, we will have 30 members of our guild in there, plus whoever we pick up on the way from partner guilds, friends, allies, etc.
---
So "within minutes" any edgelord who wants to be "mafia", will be facing a raid. And we will hunt their sorry asses. And don't think that you will just be killed. You will be mind-controlled and sent into the next Devilsaurs Jaws. And if you think the Spirit healer is your way out, rest assured, our Rogues will be waiting for you. The only way out for you, is to LOG OUT.
---
But don't worry,at this point you will likely be logged out anyway, because you just received 40+ right-click reports for disruptive gameplay. Not that we need a reason to do so, but you did communicate with the opposite faction against your own faction, which meets the criteria for "disruptive gameplay".
---
So, lets sum up:
---
* You will be killed, in ways that will send you running with red gear
---
* You will be corpse camped, and graveyard camped.
---
* You will 100% get silenced in chat for the next few days, and with a bit of luck get a time-ban (if we can inform enough people from partner guilds to rc-report you as well)
---
* You, your guild, and everyone who was ever known to have played with you, will be a pariah on the server. You may as well delete the character at this point.
---
You have a mafia.  
---
We have a Legion.  
---
You will lose.
---
There's basically three scenarios to choose from in rushing a wand for priest.
---
First, the way you described. Farm level ~6-8 humanoids in starter zone for ~60 linen. Make bolts, make linen robes, DE them to 10 enchanting and hope for at least one essence to craft your wand.
---
The second is to go a bit further in order to get the lesser magic want asap, but also to get greater magic wand. I've seen a way where you get an alt to level 5, that alt will have leatherworking and enchanting. Your main will have tailoring and skinning. This way you have skins and cloth to feed into DE's for enchanting leveling/mats. I probably will not be going this route on my dwarf priest but it is an option.
---
The last method is risky to some degree, but I feel like it could be feasible. This is where you farm linen and make robes, but you rely on someone else to have 10 enchanting skill. It means you'll likely need to farm much less linen, but finding someone else with 10 enchanting has some kind of risk that it might take a while... also, you need 30 tailor skill to start making robes, so you'll likely need to find a tailor that can make robes for you from your linen supply. I don't think it will be hard to find a tailor/enchanter with 30/10 skill respectively, but how much do you want to rely on finding this person?
---
Thats what i do on my priest alt, but i usually get herbalism after (entirely a personal decision here, there are better options). I keep tailoring until I've made truefaith and drop tailoring as well, and I pick up another.
---
Legitimately hate horde players and the kids that gravitate towards the "cool monsterz"
---
You cannot 😢 PvP servers restrict your faction to the first character you make, you’d have to delete all your characters to switch to the other faction
---
RAASSSSEEENNNGAAANNN!!!
---
So if people from retail wanted lfr you would want that added? If your not trying to stop people from playing their own way? What about cross realm?
---
Hi?
---
I know... I bought a container of Clorox wipes the will have to be part of the battle station! Keep Steelseries starlight shining
---
Yeah.
---
Did a bit of googling, and I believe you're incorrect. [worldofwarcraft.com](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/wowclassic) says nothing about needing an active sub.
---
Someone has to skin core-hounds/onyxia. You might as well make yourself invaluable to your guild by being the designated skinner. Same deal applies to mining once AQ rolls around.
---
I know that guy. He was a dwarf named Svelte or something like that on staghelm.
---
In Canada, Pepsi Zero is double caffeine, trace amounts of ginseng and zero suga/calories.  It used to be branded as Pepsi Max and before that Diet Pepsi Max.  They re-branded it to directly compete with Coke Zero.  I personally love it but a lot of people think it has a metallic taste.
---
Skinning is 100% worth it especially early on leveling. It's extra vendor trash that you otherwise wouldn't have. Very easily kept up while you level so no time wasted tying to keep any of the other professions at the appropriate level. drop it once you hit a desired level and want to replace it with something else.
---
Took the second week off. Have a wedding 12 days or so after launch. Ugh. But all the boys there will be playing classic before and after the wedding. &gt;:)
---
Profound sadness!
---
Alliance because I had to in order to play with my adult daughter.
---
Fair enough. I'll update my original post
---
Whitemane
---
No one wants to catch him.
---
Allies are basically EZ-mode when it comes to Molten Core. They had so many advantages over the Horde and most hardcore PvE guilds rolled Allies back in the day as a result. I would seriously expect to see some rerolls once people catch on.
---
Classic is not Retail...
---
18 hours.  But yeah after looking at some leveling guides that are very very in detail that explains a lot.  No one had any of that on release day.
---
This would be an amazing time to start playing WoW!
---
Create an account at [us.battle.net](https://us.battle.net) (if you're playing in the U.S.). Then download the Battlenet client, go to World of Warcraft, select WoW Classic from the dropdown above the Install button, and Install.
---
Then get a $15/month subscription in your [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) account and play! It's a great time to play!
---
Its not restricting based on absolute numbers. It is percentage based. You can transfer to the most populous server as long as your faction is the smallar one there.
---
Nope, I didn't have access to beta, and I didn't play stress test.
---
No wait, the Spaniards said they are going to Pyrewood. And according to the survey the Italians too. That made me skeptical if I should play there.
---
Except this isnt true. We saw it with retail. Or do you think dungeons are comnunicstionless shitshows because everyone subbed since mop is an asshole?
---
Warrior/Shaman is probably the strongest Warrior/healer combination in the game for the totems alone.
---
Because horde are uggo and their cities look bad because they were rushed
---
ok boomer
---
That sounds more like a... Shelbyville idea, anyway.
---
What's worse for oceanic is the pvp realm is heavily horde sided. But the PvE one is heavily alliance. I would have played on a PvP realm if it was balanced and I could play a night elf with shadowmeld. 
---
The idea of trying to walk into BRD and joining a clusterfuck every time sounds awful. Especially when outnumbered.
---
One more thing that might be worth adding is Bananas. It will help prevent cramping and give you some solid energy.
---
Or he just isnt into bestiality
---
Doing the same thing haha
---
Someone posted "release supplies" but I didn't see any actual food :(
---
THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS I ALMOST DIED IF I WASN'T REMINDED TO BREATHE BY /u/tigrpw
---
I'd be a fan of a "prestige" system, where after Naxx they just start the whole process over again with a hardmode MC.
---
I wanted to go horde like the first time
---
Friends wanted to go alliance, so here I am
---
Yes but durability is so low it won’t make a difference.
---
Server are up at Midnight tonight for you? So you're 48 hours ahead of me? :(
---
Hell yeah! HEB is the best! You got yourself a nice haul!
---
To spread out the load on starting areas as much as possible. Every region except the US starts at a time most people are not going to be able to play.
---
Same reason it's not launching on a Friday...
---
Was going to say, priest is one of the most "good" classes in the game, so them being true neutral just doesn't fit.
---
They did a pretty bad job on most of the femal models tbh. The humans are decent and people play night elf female for the... ahem, bouncing I assume. The horde models in particular are the worst of the bunch. I would probably rate it, human, gnome, night elf, undead, orc, Tauren, troll, dwarf.
---
Haha this got me
---
Sorry but class leaders are the cringest and most ineffective role going
---
Yeah I caught the /s but also informative for the actual eaters :D
---
You will &lt;3
---
If you mean "kill" as in "blizz will force Classic to become BC", Blizz has specifically said they won't do this. If you mean "kill" as in "most people will move away from Classic and people will stop playing it", Blizz has also promised that they'll keep the Classic servers up forever even if there are only 3,000 people still playing it 10 years from now.
---
Yes people on the internet have turned into bigger arseholes year on year. That's plainly obvious. 
---
Also no the vast majority of players where arseholes you just never grouped with them till you got put with them randomly.
---
I have no rose tinted glasses when it comes to classic inlove the game but ink ow it had it's fair share of arseholes even all the way back to the begining in 2004
---
Fuck, I love bagel chips...
---
im in software development and we have busy cycles due to the nature of the software and o just started overtime last week and it will continue for the next 7-8 months lol.
---
I don't have to prove it.
---
Right-Click reports are handled by an automated system. No human interaction. No proof required. If enough people (say, an entire 120man guild) reports these clowns, they will be logged out.
---
Not to mention that said guilds will also be steamrolling them from UnGoro. Oh, the "Mafia" can have 20 players there within minutes? That's so cute.
---
Collect cloth, ask for tailor. For some extra share cloth, I'd make the bags for free.
---
&gt; You obviously are so eager to discuss  
---
It's the fucking comment section. Why else would I be here?
---
This is most likely something that wasn’t working properly, so realistically it isn’t a change
---
I never played WoW and I won’t have anyone joining me on this new trip. Hopefully I can meet some cool people along the way to make it fun. I don’t even know what class I want to choose lol
---
do you still get rage when hit with the bubble?
---
The blood of mortals is a good substitute for all of this.
---
Hill country Ranch mix sour cream dip MY GAWD I gotta put a gag ball in to not eat all of them
---
1-I did not particularly call you a BFA baby.
---
2-I didn't get the situation backwards, I got what you said.
---
3-And I said, and I repeat, I don't think Blizzard would cause a greater evil in order to disable LFG.
---
That'll be the hardest part but just like in life... Some people will always be disappointed in a decision.
---
I guess I do... Lol. I'm just an overachiever I guess. I really do want to do well in Classic and Healing is a big part of it.
---
Class leader continues to be a totally pointless title to make some neckbeards feel important.
---
Generally people on forums make up a vocal minority. The average redditor is not the same thing as the average player. Plus inaccurate data on faction distribution can have a devastating effect on server population. It works as a self fulfilling prophecy, people see a huge faction imbalance from the poll so they avoid that server and it exacerbates the problem.
---
Right but the people playing retail have been playing it in a completely different manner of social interactions to vanilla and turning that around will be a shock for a lot of people and any addon that helps them play the retail way is a bad move for classics that's my point.
---
It’s all Trumps world friend
---
Frozen.... that’s nice.
---
Moving.... woah!
---
Great stuff mate.
---
Nope, go with fortnite all the way.
---
Haha wtf
---
Are you guys seriously just taking memes and putting on BiS shoulders on them?
---
It's like one of the top reason to live in Texas!
---
I'm from GMT+3 time zone.  QQ   1:00  a.m.
---
I'm against the LFG addons, both in classic and in vanilla. I don't care about #nochanges because there are already changes. I do care about the spirit of the game and in my opinion, convenience changes are one of the reasons WoW changed from a game I love into a game I can't play.
---
Looks legit.
---
Well dam bro keep at it thats impressive
---
Economic manipulation and cross faction collusion (on pvp servers) is a banable offense.  Whether blizz will actually ban mafias is a diff story.
---
This addon is no different from Call to Arms or vQueue which was IN vanilla. vQueue and Call to Arms didn't break vanilla.
---
I fking hate forced pvp but my friend is making me :/
---
Choose whichever you like the most.  
---
Cannibalize does have a fair bit of use in 1vX PvP scenarios, it's nice to have for leveling and such.  
---
Orc is real strong for PvP specifically against rogues.
---
The playing culture was radically different though as well
---
Thanks Broski
---
I'mm not worried about queues. I can log in and hop in queue via Remote Desktop before I intend to sit down and play.
---
You see, and Drop\_ doubted me! But in any case, fair play, certainly an imaginative use of a Mana Injector.
---
Thanks for the info,
---
this is definately not ideal, but ill make a sacrifice. haha
---
because horde live in tipis
---
Yeah. If you're good at softening the blow a bit, it's also extremely useful. Treat them with all of the respect they deserve (and some they don't) and everyone will know who the bad guy is. It won't be you.
---
Pls be nice
---
I think it can be a role that ensures healers are all on the same page as far as strategies, etc. It's not about feeling important as much as it is about helping to ensure a good community and great communication. Communication is key in most environments including raids.
---
Hey there everyone! We're just a group of friends that's excited to dive back into WoW and we decided to chronicle our adventures this time around with a podcast. Please bear with the amateur production and I would love to hear what you think! Also give us a shout if you're rolling on Skeram!
---
A couple years ago I saw a dude playing retail in an airport while on a layover. Im stoked to see more of that in the coming weeks while flying.
---
Not selling to vendors is pretty much the opposite of what I've seen on most profession comment posts, but I see the logic. Sell them as people try to level their professions and prices are a bit more settled.
---
Oh I didn't mean grinding dungeons to level, I meant at 60. I think grinding dungeons for levelling over questing is a thing I've seen lots of streamers talking about, but I don't have a 5 man group to do that all day with so it's not even a consideration for me. 
---
I'll go druid. Night elf is my favorite so I'm hoping I'll be a fan, but if not then it's no big deal. I'll probably have a bunch of alts anyway
---
Nope, not for a while. Not till Warriors rage fix in BC.
---
What's your professional approach to fixing this issue?  
---
The simple answer is likely there was no real solution that couldn't just in turn be further exploited.
---
The issue isn't whether it exists or not, but the way it works. It would be cool if the guys who actually made the add-on just modified it to work fine by Classic standards and be done with it.
---
Okay so everyone has to play your way then? Your idea of Vanilla is the only acceptable one?
---
Probably because you are straw manning hard.
---
I'll admit, that last one got me.
---
This is someone who sat in the back of every classroom.
---
Here, yup.
---
Low effort there.
---
How does having 3 people micro managing healers get everyone on the same page?
---
Lol this is sad. Take an upvote
---
Druids are among the best node farmers, so Herbalism or Mining. I’m going for Herbalism 
---
also my bf plays NE Hunter so that helps
---
Makes sense. The loudest person is generally the one that's wrong so let people source themselves out if they're acting childish. Appreciate the input.
---
Where are the hot pockets?
---
Whats DR?
---
UPDATE THE GIF YOU BASTARD
---
With or without the tool they will ether adapt to how the dungeons work or they wont. The tool being in the game won't change that one iota. 
---
You cant make shit players good.
---
Ah, but nothing lasts forever, not even cold November rain.
---
No undercity/ tirisfal glades makes me a sad undead.
---
No, but if my way happens to fall in line with how vanilla was actually played than yea. You have to play the game the vanilla way dude. That's the entire point of classic
---
at this point i still have my 3 toons set to alliance but im really thinking about switching. i was looking at a map of the flightpoints / boats  etc and it seems to me like horde is going to have a much easier time getting around. alliance will have the advantage for the early endgame but as far as getting around in general it looks like it favors the horde. i still have some reservations such as only really liking 2 of the races and the longer bg queues at this point it might come down to a coin toss monday morning
---
Whats your res? I'll make another version is you'd like
---
No chance
---
Bliss will load the servers fine.
---
Ooh I could hear that! I mean, not the Afghans bit  lol
---
Hell yeah brother 
---
Remember to stay hydrated and snack on healthy things like carrots and bananas
---
No they wont that's the point. Your giving people a tool to continue being unsocial they will be unsocial
---
Launch happens for me an hour after I get off my first shift, but the same time I start my second. :/
---
Thank fuxking Christ you don't have a heart-attack on the counter in your photo.
---
I vastly prefer vista, and I mainly use it for art projects, etc. Not much of anything else. Basically I'm just being a stickler about it, I've got it set up how I like and don't feel like redoing everything (nor have a need, beyond wow apparently). there's a lot of little keybidings and customizations that I did to my art programs that makes want to wait a while yet before upgrading to the most future-proofed beast I can afford.
---
Yes it is, I checked. pci x16 slot, which I have. I'm not a computer whiz but I'm hoping it'll work. unless the drivers won't work on vista for some reason. thanks m8
---
Honestly mate we can’t tell you if you’ll like it. 15 bucks you can try it for a month then you’ll know.
---
Vocal minority of what? How is the average Redditor going to differ than the average Classic WoW player? Reddit is as about a homogenized sample of people you're going to get for anything relating to video games lol
---
I can see your point. It's more along the lines of being the person to help coach someone into the right gear and the right spell usage I would think. Not so much micro-ing every healer in the raid. Someone that can be relied on the deliver the strategy and message from the top. I get it though - It shouldn't necessarily be necessary but not all people want to spend time reviewing sites and having the best information. I'm one of those people that's always looking for an edge somewhere and I can help communicate that to our team.
---
There's something special about playing the underdog. A lot of people play alliance for the aesthetics, but there is more to the game than the way something looks. 
---
There is a spirit in the Horde community which is different. There is a real faction pride. I've always thought of Alliance as colonizers. They find Horde disgusting because we are not like them. Where as the Horde embrace eachother's differences, and manages to work together despite them. 
---
Alliance cities are "prettier" but the Horde's are more diverse. I much prefer that. Alliance players always treat us like the bad guys but they have done exactly the same stuff as us. The only difference is we are open about our shortcomings. For The Horde always.
---
“Sitting is the new smoking”
---
Does anyone remember one of the most popular WoW videos of its time? Yeah probably
---
WHM for LIFE
---
Class leaders keep all of the dumbshit questions out of raid chat and organize all of the buffs so raid leaders don't spend 3 hours prepping for a wipe. At least good ones in decent guilds do.
---
“Rain rain go away” that’s what all the haters say
---
You’re kidding right? They’ve literally told people to expect multiple hour long waits if you’re in Herod or any full server for that matter...
---
That's the reason why people write super fast in wow.
---
I saw this, lightning struck from outside and knocked the power out. I nodded my head and said, "Caught that sign, God."

There's several ways to stop the current functionality.  I doubt they would stop chat parsing, but if they wanted to go that approach it could only allow parsing official channels.  They could also limit how frequently add-ons can make requests to different apis.  Like if they limit it to sending a message on private channels only once every few minutes.  That would allow sync for gathering or rp add-ons, but they could make it so infrequent (ever 30m, every hr) that it wouldn't work for lfg.  The thing about external tools is that if it's outside of the game that will be too much of a barrier for most people.  I think discord is fine if people are talking and forming groups.  If there's a discord bot that does it, then that sucks, but nothing can be done.  
---
My biggest thing is I want to meet cool people and make friends in wow again.  Retail dungeons people will literally flame you if you talk.  If anyone makes a mistake or isn't up to some imaginary standard, they get kicked or people leave.  We used to help each other and teach people how to play.
---
That's definitely not my plan. My goal will be to look at the big picture. First, will be ensuring people are prepared for raiding from a gear standpoint. Next would be ensuring they understand their roles within a given environment. After that, I will try to balance the gear aspect from low to high.
---
A team is only as strong as it's weakest link but you can't leave out the top. Not 100% sure how I'll handle that just yet but I'm working on a few plans.
---
whats the difference between the add on spamming LFG every 30 seconds, and me creating a macro that spams LFG every time I mount up
---
Yassss grill!
---
I only argue with people I think can get there.  I gave up on you after reading 2 of your posts justdrop.  When we talk it's not an argument it's just me amusing myself.
---
I'm a crusher in wow.
---
I’m gonna play a shadow priest. I’ve always wanted to and never did and idc if it sucks or not. I’ll do my best with it and try to find chill people who will take me along as the token shadow priest in the raid. I just wanna melt faces.
---
BuT CaRbS ArE WhAt GiVe YoU EnErGy
---
No, LFD ruined WoW, LFG was actually kind of nice.
---
BGS will be cross server
---
Mage. There are several aoe farming options that are only doable by mage. Plus you can charge for portals and food/water.
---
&gt; major shit
---
/salute
---
I wish I didn’t have fucking classes.  It’s my most important semester of college too.
---
When launch time arrives, all this worry you are putting into these things will quickly be transferred into logging on and playing.
---
Im going to stay on stalagg, i already moved off herod and had to convince multiple friend groups to follow, I someone got the name Dom on stalagg, in a few days / maybe a week the queue times will die down.
---
Godspeed sir
---
Ooof  actually 26 :D  
---
Started playing Vanilla when I was in the 6th grade my friend introduced me to it and we played at my grandmothers house every weekend together.
---
If 15/month is too expensive for you at 23 you should just stick to fortnite.
---
Man, I’m almost in the same boat.  I’m in a guild where they are planning to clear MC by week 3.   The majority of the main raid team will be 60 within 2 weeks.  
---
I look forward to raiding with their alts!
---
I'm sure you are, and you're good in bed, and dark and handsome.
---
I also bought snacks but ended up munching on them, I now gotta restock
---
IDK if "Ea" is name you want to brag about owning.
---
Anyone who needs to pug for anything and acts like that isn't going to do well. Limiting the players who want to be in a guild with you is never a good idea. It's much easier to develop players than find already experienced players. The majority of the playerbase in a few months is going to be people who've done a it all before and have just forgotten the details anyway, so someone who fucks up  a whole bunch between now and then is not even remotely close to being a write off.
---
Did anyone add up total kills and total deaths to see if this checks out?  Im doubtful.
---
You and a mass army of other players that skarm managed to convince.
---
Mark my words, the best part about classic is going to be the people not actually putting the time into feral tank, specifically consumables and MCPs and subsequently whining that Skarm trolled them.
---
Knowing the class
---
People always take the easy road, It's how we operate. Alot of people are also inclined to be selfish. 
---
The thing is, in vanilla the easiest road was to be social. The quickest way to form a group was if you had a network of people and if you were a decent person willing to cooperate you had the biggest chance of succes. So there was more of a drive to be social for everyone. 
---
The addon/lfg never changed people's personality. It just made more people act more social for selfish reasons.
---
Remember that time people left Herod for Stalagg to avoid queues?
---
Huh, I just realised Americans can't see what timezone a server is. Seems a bit odd, no?
---
My wife thinks so.
---
Phase 2 is probably 10 months from now.
---
Faction balance doesn't mean much in the beginning. The real balance is the level 60 balance which will come later on.
---
The dwarven gryphon rider one just makes me think of when the game breaks
---
I'm alone.
---
But I'm not lonely.
---
It's sitting in my crockpot it should cook right?  
---
PS. wish I could have someone cook for me =(
---
Probably tried the stress test
---
Ya, wtf? Goddamn normie supreme plannine there. As it is right now I only shower daily cause I have to go to work. I only check my mail like once a week as it is right now. If shit was that important they would've called me.
---
I took a week off of work to play classic. I sure as shit am not going to be showering at all during that time.
---
linux + playing on 4g
---
wow classic: hard mode
---
took off the week, I wont stare at the queue im just gonna go play another game until i get in
---
According to many of the surveys I’ve seen, somewhere between 15-18% are going warrior.
---
Assuming all warriors are going prot (which they won’t), that is still less than 1/5 of the total population will be prot.  Which means we still won’t have enough prot warriors for 5-man groups, and I would be very surprised if Druid and Paladin tanks will make up that cap.
---
Add on the fact that warriors are extremely hard to level, and many of those who start a warrior are unlikely to finish leveling that warrior, and I’m sure it’ll be nothing to worry about.
---
Basically what everyone else already said. Low ram, 32-bit OS and that processor is weak. You're best value proposition would likely be to check a pawn shop for a laptop or desktop but if you're asking here for specs advice, i'd recommend bringing someone you trust who knows computers with you so you don't get swindled.
---
I don't know what this "litre" is, but I'll drink my 8 glasses of water a day thanks to this post.
---
Layering removal is not that big of deal, but the problem is what happens to the spawn rate of world resources if they finalize a single layer that holds 15000 people. 
---
What changes will be made to accommodate this.
---
It's what she tells you, anyway.
---
That might not be a bad thing. Since they're so young, learning a new language is more easy for them. I've seen people comment that they became fluent in English through gaming.
---
I think most the playerbase is just riding the hype train and will not play long term. Expecting a big drop around 6-8 weeks.
---
Paladin is boring, true, but Warrior can be sometimes legit frustrating until you get gear.  My favorite phrase for it was "doormat to demigod".
---
Nah just more tedious and frustrating. Especially if you've played since launch.
---
Im rolling a soloplay char and a friendplay char at release - Im gonna be so late to 60
---
&gt;So please, keep in mind to act as an respectful advisor towards these inexperienced players.
---
Yes, because Retail Players are absolutely known for taking helpful advice from more experienced Players. Let me show you what the likely response will look like:
---
*"llluuuuul dunt talk lul whats your raiderio u dont even have achiev xoxoxo"*
---
If you think I am wrong, do log onto retail, join an LFR group, and try to explain the "MT" why he should move out of the hot-orangy thing on the ground. I guarantee you, you will start to see things my way post haste.
---
I will be helpful to newcomers. IF they are at least trying to help yourself, and IF they show that they understand that this is a social, community-driven game, not the "Single Player Action-Jump'n'Run with slight RPG elements" that they are used to.
---
First thing I noticed when I saw this pic. All that sugary garbage makes me cringe. It's hard to break the sugary drink habit, but once you start drinking mostly/almost entirely water, you definitely feel a lot better.
---
Makes sense - Should be easy enough assuming most will want to be successful early on. Considering the content is well-researched a lot of it should come fairly easy. All depends on people and their choices though - I can lead the horse to water but I can't make it drink.
---
They have a talent tree named “Balance” so...
---
JUST DO IT!!! Seriously though, wow classic is happening for a reason. Because we wanted it back that bad because it was that damn awesome. Enjoy the ride, friend.
---
Well theoretically as warriors have no threat dump it could effect their uptime on the boss
---
Retail went the same way and blizzard couldnt care any less. Alliance on retail is clinically dead.
---
I think the same will happen in classic were people flock to the server with the strongest faction representation
---
If you need people to babysit others to keep dumbshit questions out of raid chat you've made mistakes when recruiting people. Even in the worst guilds I've been in people were smart and mature enough to just communicate and coordinate without a necessity for supervision.
---
You can download and install the game without a sub, you just can't make any characters untill you have an active subscription
---
Classic has not even launched yet, do not trust these surveys.
---
And most Warriors will not even make it to 40 once they see how painful and slow they are.
---
I'm still subbed to the original sub for this. Don't think I can say it here though, I wasn't given a pass by the mods.
---
Very solid card, especially since it doesn't require a feed from the PSU so you avoid that problem.
---
That said, it's a Pascal type GPU and I really don't think they did Vista drivers for that gen. I will check for you.
---
Ah, yes. But you are right the insignia trinket is really good for rugues against mages.
---
That's what it's all about though, valuing other people's time, if you pick "sub optimal" class or race, you're basically saying screw everyone else I'm gonna make choices that for subjective reasons matter to me while wasting time of everyone else I'm ever playing with.
---
We're all so much better off after having your input today! Thanks for that erudite analysis!
---
Pft real bears are an animal in all forms!
---
I already updated my original comment.
---
Lmao where did you think most systems come from? Retail is full of QOL things that were originally addons
---
As you can see I was wielding a Gutgore Ripper with a Firestone, I used it for fun in duels and to piss off Rogues who were inspecting me.
---
I later upgraded it with a Perditions Blade with Fiery Enchant and respecced to a melee spec to duel people. I won more fights than I lost.(lol)
---
This is the sort of unique stuff and shenanigans that I missed most in the later expansions.
---
1. The concept is just fucking ridiculous, classes aren't exactly challenging, there's enough resources out there now for anyone to become easily familiar with it. I genuinely don't see what class leaders would do that 1 regular officer couldn't do on their own, knowing how to distribute loot with council is a core concept of being an officer.
---
2. You give 'power' to too many people, if you have GM, class leaders, role leaders, regular officers, you're well over 10 people, it's too much. Running a guild doesn't require that many people, I personally think anything over 4 officers is way too much.
---
3. People playing the same class will talk to each other anyway to help each other improve, I just don't see what a designated class leader does.
---
Just saying it would be helpful to indicate your region.
---
Big if true
---
The secret is out
---
If you're on a pvp server yes. I would probably get it right after feral swiftness personally. It also gives you an amazing way to cc that extra mob you pull when questing.
---
My opinion?  Not worried about it.  Very little of the people who say they're going to play warrior will actually commit to it.  Probably 10-20% of them will make it to 60.
---
I am! I am actually very hyped to go in alone. I'm genuinely extremely introverted and like doing everything that I can on my own. That's not to say I'm not looking to make friends and do some raiding, but I might try to go the super PUG route this time. I'm a bit jaded by recent guild drama in retail and trying to keep too many people happy (although I don't remember ANY drama from my Vanilla guild days when loot was even scarcer funny enough).
---
But what about arcane shot/volley/those other abilities?
---
I would like to clear nax this time around.  I only did a little raiding towards the end of vanilla and never got that farm. I got heavy into raiding BC and beyond.  I will not be trying for the pvp gear.  The summer after I graduated highschool I moved across the country and pvped for like 10 hours a day all summer because i didn't know anyone and I think I only reached blood guard.
---
Mages are easier to gear for pvp so that could be a factor.
---
Nestle...
---
!remindme 1 day
---
I work hard a lot of the time on things that, while they matter, don't fulfill me. To top that off, I'm fairly lonely. Since I started working so much I don't have a lot of time or energy to put into mainting friendships or striving for deeper relationships.
---
This being the case, I need something in my life to take the edge off. A while back that used to be alcohol and marijuana, but I bave addiction problems so I had to stop both of those things. So, here we are. 
---
I need something with no definitive end, that allows me to put energy into a third party medium that'll allow me to cajole with my friends and distract myself from the fact that I'm not satisfied as a person until I can cut back my hours and work on the parts of ny lufe that have more meaning, and WoW is the way to do that. On top of that, I am VERY passionate about video games and mechanical excellence, and Classic gives me an avenue to that as well. I don't plan on giving up classic, I plan on being here for a long time; but the reason for that is because I need something light and cheesy to fulfill me while I look for a more permanent solution.
---
That being said, when I find that solution, still not quitting, because a healthy dose of escapism is good for everyone.
---
My state won’t go together.
---
I think you got the wrong one bud.
---
Listen, kid. I am not the one who started out saying the site was shit. You pulled a statement out of your ass and got caught in the lie. You won't list the addons because you don't have a list. You are pretending to be something big and special. Well, here is a news flash, you are not special.
---
If you don't like the site that is fine. If you don't like me I will live. 
---
Oh, and how much would I pay a failed Reddit troll? Nothing.
---
Take it, easy man.
---
Nope, I'll be on my realm's Discord.  I get the hate for the LFG addon but I'm astounded that so many people don't realize or choose to ignore that there are fantastically good out-of-game social resources.
---
Blizz changing their minds is exactly why we have Classic. I'm not saying they're liars, not at all, but you can't seriously expect them (or any company) to stay true to their word on sonething "forever," especially if it ever stops being a big enough money maker.
---
&gt; Even in the worst guilds I've been in people were smart and mature enough to just communicate and coordinate without a necessity for supervision
---
Congratulations, hopefully this time around my server is filled with those people.
---
I suggest everyone binge watch Oxhorn's classic videos before release. Pure. Gold.
---
Ironically they came for the developers and somehow the gamers are all on the devs side.
---
What you really needed was not a leveling guide, but a guide on how to find a mommy-GF before classic came out. 
---
On a more serious note, not to be rude but those pre-packaged fruit/cheese/etc packs are usually way overpriced. I'm all for healthy choices, but bananas are something like 0.50$ a pound and come with natural packaging.
---
&gt;Really good to hear, he's legit one of the true legends of gaming in a similar vein to people like Flash.
---
Lmao, let's not get ahead of ourselves here.
---
Never in the history of any MMO has there been a surplus of tanks
---
I am present, brother.
---
In what way is it deleted from the game?  It just didnt exist in the vanilla game.  All it does is make LFG readable with thousands of players using 1 channel.
---
Seriously though, low key fuck rogues and warriors. They love stealing my damn pre-BiS xbows...
---
A lie, lol.
---
It doesn’t serve the same function, and couldn’t have.
---
The analogy you’re attempting to make is not analogous
---
Lmao
---
Have fun getting rez sickness at the graveyard!
---
I was busy playing Ultima Online and thought wow was too casual
---
For pve you'll  have an easier time as a rouge getting groups or a raid spot. Although really fun to play, shadow doesn't scale very well with gear and gets overtaken by the other casters. Both classes you're looking at are really fun in pvp
---
That's expensive for what you get. Regular apples and the like are far less pricey. Granted I'm a weirdly obsessed finance person, you can see my content here: https://youtu.be/GZv5ZQQZt4Y
---
Banana peels are natural banana packaging for no extra charge or labor costs of chopping.
---
i am possibly rolling skeram :D
---
Apparently your PC can't even take screenshots.
---
Never realized bag of marbles works on bosses holy shit
---
The sub put me off initially, but some pals eventually convinced me and I had a blast. Unfortunately, its been a bit of an on and off romance over the years because I feel each expansion undoes my progress instead of building upon it. That being said I always come crawling back and here I am.
---
I was playing Lineage II in 2005-2007. :)
---
ikr. not leaving the house for 3 months LUL
---
I don't care about a queue one bit. So... not really. It's a legitimate question with pretty big consequences I think.
---
For Questie you can also download it from [Github](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/releases/latest) or [Cursforge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie) (which the Twitch app uses as the download source).
---
Same. My friend used to randomly whisper people and make friends with them as often as not. Just be open and positive toward people and ya should be fine.
---
\&gt;when you forget to put rebuke on your bar while in an arena and can't find it so you copy and paste /cast rebuke to interrupt casts
---
played cs competitively
---
He can tank leveling dungeons with any spec
---
Man I remember loving the game, until I found out that my favorite class combination was utterly worthless and that most people didn't even want a THF in a leveling party.
---
You can tank dungeons as dps spec as far as I know maybe not the 60 ones.
---
Some things are changed because they were deemed incorrect. Some changes were reverted because it was how the mechanic worked
---
Story time!
---
Circa 2006 I was in Kroger, I must have been wearing some kind of WoW t-shirt because guy behind the meat counter asks me about it.
---
He then tells me about how he just been kicked from his guild for looting some sword during a raid, because he wanted to be, as he put it, a “melee mage!!!”.
---
Hadn’t thought about that guy in years,
---
I'm tryin to find a back up server incase for a healthier balance on est as well
---
How exactly is the idea flawed? I am ready to be enlightened.
---
I had to change my name when I transferred. It was either Mothra, Masticate, Clockspider, or Limecat. I was only in the guild for like a month then I had to quit playing due to some irl stuff.
---
We’re already past no changes with legion engine, layering, bnet, etc. No changes is not realistic or obtainable.
---
Super cool man. You have any 2650x1440 versions?
---
Dude get some sleep HOLY shit
---
FFXI was what my friends played and I still think it was more of a challenge.
---

Lorekalex#8723 NahyJo#2370
---
Thanks for your attention, have a good time!
---
Yah, you caught me.  I don't know how to install addons.   You right wingers are always good for a chuckle.
---
Don't do that. You should level as enhancement. You can even tank dungeons as enhancement for a good while.
---
I only just noticed you are from Holland. I didn’t know girls in Holland played WoW
---
I am a big fan of LotR fantasies 
---
Thats a lot of lmao 
---
Upvote sir
---
Only need a shield
---
They’ve had the same ad at BK Bridge Station the whole week too
---
Yeah I get it from a financial point if you're needing to but not gloating I'm good in a sense of being able to afford convenience.
---
Ya, I feel ya man. I don't have a choice, but as a solo player, it makes sense.
---
Where do you get that information? You're wrong on basically every levels....
---
\- Layering will be gone before phase 2, phase 2 being the time limit, but the goal is to remove it as soon as possible.
---
\- Herod is still overpopulated? You were warned and will just have to deal with queues.
---
\- No timeline has been given about phases, but I really doubt it would be 6 months, more likely 2-3 if you ask me, but nobody really knows.
---
Rogues can be lawful, they are just sneaky. My point was that locks are more chaotic than rogues.
---
Stfu boomer
---
Ok thanks - just confirming that you can’t craft Enchanted items past 75/Journeyman at level 5. 
---
Still helpful regardless to have a DE bot - it’s a trick I wish I knew much sooner
---
i like when people worry about the whole payment system and free time, saying "what would we do with ourselves" or "we need jobs to feel complete" ya no, I've "retired" at a early age, i'm going to discover these difficult questions for everyone while playing games.
---
I know I will; people always want to scream when you kick their crutch out from under them.
---
The same kinda reeee you get when you try to end welfare.
---
I guess i'm talking out my ass a little. I'm reacting to what most people 'think' an LFG addon does. I guess i'm as ignorant as most, because i don't actually know how their implementation works.
---
My point however remains, let people be people, dont like it dont use it.
---
So brave. Another trash player lost F
---
Because a month into Classic, all the addons listed in the classic section of Curse will work fine.  Your site is pointless.
---
"Send me back!" These two things fit too well together
---
I think it won't be too bad, the herod ally pop will still be large to find people and should be okay to group on tbh
---
Join us!! Horde or Alliance?
---
Issa joke
---
Hello!
---
I am replying now. . while you are typing to the other comment. Because of thats what you do. Ahh. there it is. 
---
Right-winger?
---
Finally someone who bought actual food
---
Unwanted message meaning it will not send out messages outside of what I instruct it to send. The addon by itself will not spam people on whisper or other channels. 
---
And good for you for being so antisocial that you actually automated it. Quick question tho'. If auto invite is not in the spirit of classic, is auto ignore?
---
And I assume you are using the same AddonMsgChannel to communicate between instances of your own addon in order to auto-blacklist for everyone.
---
i had a dog that i wouldnt treat right when i was playing. I was going through a rough time in my life and i stopped caring about myself and everything else. The dog got stressed because i wouldnt let him go out, that would take precious gaming time and because of that he started destroying stuff inside the house. Than one day i saw a reddit thread that i shouldnt neglect my dog because something something the Undertaker something
---
Alliance scum, but nice picture tho
---
No I’m going it with 58674 others in queue
---
Same, but I’d rather the game didn’t have them.
---
Yup yup and he has a big hat too!
---
Meanwhile on retail shed tone of people grinding wqs. Retail will be ok
---
Yeah picked a random server and got lucky it's in my timezone. Had no idea when I picked.
---
Healing officer/leader is also a pointless title, my guild on retail has 1 healer that organises and calls for all the cooldowns, but he's not an officer or whatever, despite being the 2nd most important to the team after the raid leader. 
---
Especially on classic where there's far less to communicate, you're just giving somebody a pointless title for the sake of it. Unless there's a very good reason to give somebody a higher rank, it's best to avoid it completely.
---
Obviously it is more useful on a hunter though. What if I am clearing adds and can't stand still long enough to cast aimed shot? Sure, it's very rare, but I still need the extra chance if I ever do get into that situation.
---
I’m going to be the tankslut whored out to every PUG group on the server.
---
Remember how classic is way bigger than Blizzard is anticipating and this is all WITHOUT the amount of people who are about to resub to play (come Monday we will see a fuckload of people subbing)
---
Look at those ragtag bunch of misfits. Cobbled together armor and everything they own carried on their backs, ready to do wet work wherever the pay is good. That's what being an adventurer is all about.
---
Why don't we need a stun removal? I know we can block out of stuns, and there's no debuff if you wind up needing to double block so do we just ice block out of dangerous stuns all the time?
---
I have refined my in-game exercise program to a truly optimal state and I share it with all here and encourage you to pass it along to others. The benefits of exercise as a counter to a sedentary gaming experience should be obvious to all.
---
The essence of my program is to avoid excessive automation. Resist the temptation to macro and keybind everything and get in the habit of clicking on spell icons. Studies have shown that the average WoW gamer casts over 10,000,000 abilities and/or spells while leveling from 1-60. If you invoke each of these abilities by actually clicking on the action bar icons rather than using keybinds from the home position on your keyboard, your hands will travel a distance requiring energy equivalent to walking over 800 miles. Speed levelers will see even bigger, aerobic-style payoffs.
---
Finally, try to avoid automated food-feeding devices like the Dorito-Stuffer or the Mountain Dew-Chugalug, and take the opportunity to use your hands to lift these nutrients to your mouth manually. Yes, it will take time away from your gaming experience, but the health benefits will be more than worth it.
---
That is all.
---
i dont have a preference. i was just going to roll something day 1. Most likely playing warlock
---
We can sleep when we are dead. As for now.... we play wow.
---
I really like it too! Very suitable
---
Well, it's not so much the population that matters. Herod's Alliance will still probably be larger than other servers. I just hope the large faction imbalance doesn't pressure Alliance players to leave the server either at the start or down the road when server transfers open.
---
Worst case scenario, you get a server like Illidan on retail. It's basically 100% Horde.
---
You are not alone!
---
The annoying thing for the creator is that blizzard isn't saying what parts of the addon specifically violate, or how they intend to break the addon/limit its functionality.
---
Poor guy doesn't realize half the player base is older than him, married with children. If you played it at 17 and it was Meh. I'd try something else its hella grindy like osrs except you cant afk to max
---
I mean I honestly can't relate. 15 years ago I rolled Alliance on a PVP server and it turned out it was 90% horde. I still had a blast. But it's like you said, we don't really know if these poles are an accurate representation of not only the characters that exist but the people who will actually be playing there come launch.
---
And I know it's frustrating because you can't predict if you start playing there at launch, you level up some and you have fun and you meet people and you don't get horribly slaughtered in open world PVP too much, but around level 30 or 35 you get access to a more accurate poll that shows the horde have a staggering advantage.
---
There's numbers and then there's your experience. One only affects the other if you allow it.

I was prepping for my fantasy draft which starts 30 minutes after the Classic release on Monday. It has been difficult to deal with two major fantasy loves occurring at the same time. The Footballers made me feel a little better with their (ie one host's) love for WoW.
---
Why is it surprising? There are large ally streamers playing there of course its going to be more 50/50, The best way to fight faction balance besides offering xp boosts which is against Classic philosophy is to impose faction queues to keep faction balance within 5% at least. So if horde is 60% and ally is 40% there will be a queue on horde until it turns into 55/45 at a minimum.
---
Horde scum, nice comment tho
---
I was going to go Fairbanks but will be going blamo now since Fairbanks is full :)
---
Mods delete this post its advertising selling copyrighted material
---
I bet you’re super fun at parties.
---
Yeah nah, I'm not gonna do 60 levels without a mount.
---
This is no longer entirely true, because there is now a system in place, that act purely on number of players reporting, and rep/time ratio: Right click Reporting.
---
While I would love to enter Un'Goro with an entire Raid, and show the "Mafia" Edgekids the true meaning of getting camped (corpse + graveyard) until hell freezes over, it's not even necessary to do so any more:
---
As soon as the wannabe Mafiosi are identified, what will happen is the entire guild (+ partner guilds, we are talking several hundred people here) will simply klick 3 buttons, and that's it, problem solved.
---
So, best of luck to all Devilsaur Mafiosi. You know, in whatever game they end up after their ban.
---
I am happy that addons are allowed and I am happy to adapt. That's not the issue here.
---
Yeah that's why I won't play at all. Can't have two lives and this time I will not choose wow.
---
If that guy didn't move his eyes, I'd thought he was a prop
---
To produce less spam for people not using the addon.
---
Now it will post in /LookingForGroup instead, Basically forcing people to use some sort of filtering addon, get spammed, or not participate in the channel at all.
---
Why does that make me a poor guy? Didn’t reference anyone older?
---
PServers are not Classic and PUGS will only be clearing MC and a few BWL bosses at best. That's me being optimistic, I can see PUGS falling apart during trash pulls in MC tbh.
---
As everyone else is saying he is totally viable leveling in fury and arms and simply carry a shield and be in defense stance to tank. Theirs even some unique meta specs of war tanks in full fury and arms. Dual weilding is a sight to behold.
---
Time to crush the vermin that call themselves the Horde and return order and leave to Azeroth!
---
Agreed. Vanilla was actually designed as a more casual MMO. Everquest was incredibly unforgiving. Don’t discourage newcomers, the game isn’t hard to get into. The 1-60 part is a bit of a grind but the leveling is part of the experience.
---
It's something a lot of people forget. Some fights' difficulty like Vaelastrasz were increased by this, I remember many people straight up crashing their pcs or disconnecting on that fight.
---
This time around we'll have better computers, stacked with worldbuffs and potions, some QoL improvements, more knowledge. 
---
It's a shame how #nochanges actually changes a lot but most are blinded by nostalgia.
---
Let me start by saying that you're of course free to play however you want, and if this is your thing go for it...but how boring to just dungeon grind all the way to 60...
---
EU plates thoug
---
I was playing FFXI since NA launch, where most people regarded WoW as a kid's game.  Then I had some weird computer issue where I couldn't run it anymore and had a few friends that played, so I bought TBC the day it came out and as soon as I discovered PvP, that was a wrap.
---
Yeah I feel the same if people don't want to use then don't use it. But I definitely don't want the modern version of LFG to be available.
---
5% more hp and a stun, you shouldn’t die lol
---
I think any decent officer will have enough knowledge to assign loot properly regardless of class. When I've been an officer/GM in guilds previously, part of the role is knowing how to effectively gear people and telling the weak links how to improve. Weighing up the bigger upgrade vs the better player is part of the role, and you don't need much knowledge of a class to decide.
---
I missed the boat initially because my computer wasn't good enough to run the game. I played the demo a couple times at my friend's house, but stuck to RuneScape because it ran on the toaster I had in 2004. Eventually bought the computer off my friend for super cheap when he upgraded and got my own account in TBC.
---
Perfect reply. On the timing issue: blizzard thinks it will be 2-3 months, so I’ll guess 4.
---
I'm coming back (Poisonkilla)
---
What CPU do you have?
---
5 in opportunity then straight up combat with the standard combat dagger spec, in grabs improved backstab, dagger spec (5 Crit) and improved sprint. It’s actually very nice for levelling and is quite good for lowbie PvP, since improved sprint shits on CC’s.
---
There are far easier swords to get though.
---
Alliance. Simply because Horde are more fun to gank.
---
i would say probably not because you are about the 100th person i've seen make a post like this.

This is the story of probably 75% of players. A lot will only be playing for 1-4 hours a day. I dont think you'll be missing out by being a couple weeks behind, might even end up better for you, missing the launch fuckery that is bound to happen
---
Yea I was going considering a couple other realms but decided to go blamo since it's currently medium pop and the server location is Los Angeles, and I live in Cali.

You can be Arms or Fury while leveling, but if you suck it up, put a shield on and tank a dungeon/elite group quest, people are going to add you to their friends list and be willing to assist you in times of need.
---
The 'forgotten' warriors are those who made no friends or just kept repeating 'im dps' like it matters when a group is just trying to get some dungeon content done. It's a hard life for sure, but others make it better. :)

I used to play on a computer with 800mhz processor, 256mb of ram, and a dial up connection.

We’re talking about 1 frame per second; 2 if there were no other players or npcs in my drawdistance, and a constant 800-1200ms ping.

Got to level 24 tho. That’s the struggle.

just general advice, you should downgrade your operating system to Windows 7.

What the actual... what... where did you find... INCREDIBLE!
---
my brother was 100% the reason for YEARS
---
so back when Christmas shopping was putting circles on pictures in the Toys r Us catalog I was doing exactly that and i say something called World of Warcraft. at the time i had played a shit ton of Warcraft 3 and liked the series so I put figured i'd like this game too if it was Warcraft. At some point my brother walks in and looks over my shoulder to see what i picked saw WoW and said "nah you dont want that game, trust me." i believed him so i took it off my list. Later i watched my buddy that lived down the street play it and thought it was really confusing so i didnt think anything of it untill that same friend got me into it a few months before WotLK dropped. been playing ever since
---
Let’s gooooooooo
---
Next time you think about making a post asking "Is it just me?" or "Am I the only one who?" assume that the answer is no
---
Buying a g600 mouse made a big difference for me!
---
But before that I was bad. I remember being an ele shaman and still being hyper focused on my hotbars while standing in shit. I was using keybinds but I was watching for procs and timers instead of watching my feet. After being in a super casual guild through bc, running kara every week, I joined a more hardcore guild in wrath, they called me out on my shit, and I quickly learned to watch myself and learn the actual encounters as i didnt like being embarrassed on vent in front of my guild Haha.
---
Later on in life I got into ffxiv 2.0 and I mained a healer. White mage for a while and then when my guild ran 2 white mages and having trouble in the raid they convinced me to level up scholar... holy shit what a game changer for me. I manually controlled my fairy and of course my own spells as well, then we realised that our other healer was... not really helping, and I was basically solo healing without being aware of it, but it had been pushing me to play better, was a huge ego boost, which helped me push myself as I now thought I was top tier scholar and wanted to make sure I stayed that way... I miss how scholar used to play!

not too many  Faerlina players on this forum i imagine, given how anti-streamer everyone seems to be.

That's a lot to chew on. I'll definitely be considering your thoughts. In your opinion, what loot system is the most 'fair'? I ask this with the understand that people can always find something unfair within any system but what are your thoughts?
---
Of course I'm not. 
---
It's dangerous to go alone.
---
I’m sure lots of people are in a similar boat. I myself was in college during Vanilla so basically could play as much as I wanted around class. 
---
13 years later a job, wife, and child definitely make it harder. The advantage I have now though is all the info I can take with me from back then, plus 13 years of gameplay knowledge and more difficult boss mechanics. 
---
Thankfully, my job has me work 7 days in a row, then 7 days off, and the release happens on day 1 of my week off. That said, I bet the quality of my experience won’t be quite as good compared to starting a week after launch, so people that have to wait a bit will likely find it more enjoyable to level.
---
Yup, I stay up til 1am if I just come home and chill all evening. If I take the dog on a 30-45 min brisk walk instead of just taking him out I pass out by 10:30.
---
Yes, kinda. Everyone I know is going PVP but I'm too old, lazy and casual to bother with wpvp anymore so I'm going PVE. I can make new similarly old, lazy and casual new friends.

lmao guilty!

I was doing so well today and i became a blubbering mess after reading this and realizing he wont get to go back to classic.....miss his videos and tweets like someone else said we will have to channel his memory in everything we do in a world he loved

The first couple of weeks is going to be chaos, full of people there to complain about it, long waits to get in, unforeseen glitches, and did I mention the chaos?  You’ll be fine dude, no worries.  It’s not going anywhere (I’ll leave the light on for you).

"Trade me 100 gold and see what happens :-)" isn't against the rules, I hope

I used to give out low level bags in goldshire in exchange for the cloth.  Newbies were probably going to vendor it anyhow, so worked for both of us.
---
Lol nah the love all around is genuine. They just started with the ads this past week.  Their pod is at the top of my list, right there with Bill Burr, simply because they are genuine guys.

Uh, that is a godawful CPU. Like stone-age type shit. Please consider getting a new laptop if you want to play video games.

Yes, you are the only one in the world that is going to try to go in blind.
---
&gt;Just a reminder to all other experienced OG's that return home. Don't forget that even though we know alot about classic, because we spend many hours playing Vanilla. This does not mean other players did. **There will also be alot of retail players** and even new players joining us, and they probably never played Vanilla and it's content.

Dude, I do not want this **** in classic. I do not want that slippery slope of **** that killed retail to begin with.
---
Any argument is pointless, it is well known in the community the hatred of the LFD, LFR, and to less extent, LFG. Blizzard said it would not be allowed in Classic, period.
---
Anyone acting surprised that this sh*tstorm happened, is either a fool or a troll, IcyVeins completely deserved the hate they got, they were asking for it. I do not think they can be so out of touch as to actually believe it would be well received.
---
Gambling is ok , you just can't advertise in chat

Me too :)

As long as Blizzard doesn't implement an LFG, no one should have a problem with it.

Most likely not. They aren't really changing the loot table especially to re add an item they intently removed.

---
You're being intentionally obtuse and misleading, and you know it.
---
Big difference between people talking to each other and forming trust between each other for mutual benefit, vs letting a system of bots matchmake without the need for any social interaction. The banter, the chit-chat and getting to know your party members while the group forms is the foundation of a successful run with people who are willing to work together.
---
Using automation to strip away what is intentionally designed to be a social experience is against the whole sentiment that Classic was brought back for. It turns people in to machines because now you're only interacting with a machine. Your party members become NPCs whose sole purpose is to kill on your behalf so you can get loot. The game becomes about minimizing the time between start and finish. It becomes a single player experience where anything on your screen that isn't your character is seen as being there to serve you. This is exactly what happened in Wrath with the introduction of the LFG tool.
---
Humans naturally take the path of least resistance. jUsT dOn'T uSe tHe aDdOn bRo is not a viable response to this problem, because these kinds of addons will directly work to take over the market size of people who genuinely want to form groups and get to know each other. When enough players are using the addon, it eventually just becomes a requirement and the standard way to do things.
---
You don't need to prep. Just chill and enjoy. Unlikely any of those veterans will be close to realm first, and there is no other reasons to rush.
---
Calm as a cucumber. I''m more chuckling at how obvious his shit is. You're the one perpetuating this.
---
I was worried everyone on the servers were gonna shit on me for not knowing anything, Reddit confirmed

I enjoy Bill Burr but haven't heard his podcast. I'll have to check that out. Thanks for the recommendation!
---
I don't play alot of Video Games..  Heck I don't even need this to be High Graphics to enjoy..  But it plays Guild Wars 2 for instance with no issues at all..  Not a huge gammer.. Just enjoy playing leisure type games.. Like WOW

Have they given an ETA on being able to get back to where you are in the guide once you close it?

I really hope to meet some people from reddit, would be super cool to just game with randos

For the horde
---
I did this when I played a PoE League Launch for like 36 hours straight.
---
Even tho it wasnt all "healthy" snacks but also a little bit of shit stuff I finally crashed when the second night started.
---
Kinda want to see how the tempo of WoW can keep my brain working.
---
Cheers bro 👌
---
Alliance. 
---
I’ve played Horde for nearly a decade and loved it, but my Vanilla days were all alliance, and so too will my classic experience.  
---
I think Duskwood as a zone makes running alliance worth it on its own.
---
There is also a spot north in between WPL and EPL.
---
I believe two classes that work for that are druid and warlock? Warlock's SM/Ruin build works for pvp and is a 1/raid spec to give tanks a stamina buff. For druid their healing spec works as a support class in pvp.
---
I've just realised this is our generation's version of Minecraft songs.

shitty karma post imo

Thought about it.  Am I likely to find a raiding guild on my schedule and dedication level in the US or do I just eat the higher ping and roll EU?  I'm going to try and find something US in case my job changes and my schedule switches.  If it's not looking good, I'll switch to EU and relevel a toon.

People can here rat flute, but sadly you must be by a rat to use it
---
A lot of people will start a new fresh WoW journey! Including me, I have to figure out almost everything. Only thing I have is a good basic MMORPG knowledge.
---
Part of the classic experience is over packed servers and remedying this when the damage is done
---
Ah shit I remember, I'm not looking forward to this one
---
I have no idea about warriors. I just use it to reckbomb the world buffs off mages on their way to raid :)

I think mc/bwl zg/aq20 will be pugged all the time.
---
Aq40/naxx will req guilds
---
jajaja
---
Everyone I know is going PvP server. 
---
I played on PvP originally and I HATED it.  Once AQ40/Naxx is out PvP is dead, IMO.  It was one of the reasons Blizz introduced Resilience gear in BC.  Raiders could take on 3-4 people solo.
---
So I'm going PvE server solo.
---
yeah, blood clots are no joke. (RIP Incontrol)

They can send a C&amp;D, their lawyers will make sure you uphold those. Or face the consequences, wouldn't be a small offense either.
---
It is their IP, they decide who can do what with it. There is not even any room to argue against, no court of law in NA, EU or even China will rule against the IP owner/holder in such a matter. (Intellectual) Property laws are strict and concise for a reason - they are the basis of civil life.

It's not a trinket, its a non-stackable consumable.
---
It used a heartbeat check system, everyone second it would have a chance to break. So poly morph would 90% of the time last 10-14 seconds, but there was a tiny chance it would only last 1 second or last for 25 seconds, and probably like 1 in a million it would last the full 40 seconds or whatever.
---
Fine whatever .... I'll follow you on twitch .
---
Bigglesworth is an icky Pacific server... no thanks!
---
Please don't play PVE youre missing half the game
---
That’s the point. That’s the benefit of grinding at that level
---
To condense what others are saying, he can spec how he wants and when it's time to tank just put on a shield, one-hander, and Defensive stance (maybe not even that.)
---
Event Viewer application?  Sorry.. Not sure what that is

Yup, going in alone, same as back in the day.

I have for a week been slowly shredding my sleep schedule. It is timed so I wake up an hour before launch. Gl&amp;hf.

---
Looks like I chose well by going Whitemane. Thanks for the link, my hype only grows stronger.
---
Some of the changes in this one are from suggestions, I'm just using the suggestions I liked the best. So it's a bit of both?
---
Don't worry. You must be still young at heart and will blend in fine. This is exactly the kind of useless forum post today's generation of teens would make.
---
Then that's good.
---
I think having instancing will help a bit but overall, I doubt it. The Vanilla game world was not meant for servers this large.
---
Have you tried just using google and look at the million of guides this game is 15 years old there are tons of guides ... trust me nobody has any secrets ,,
---
I was laid off two weeks ago, made me really happy. Come Monday I start my new job 4 10's plus 8 =(
---
Oh well, adult stuff...
---
But even in retail people run back. Might have just been a private server thing.
---
herb = money (alchemy is not required, most profit is from the gather). Engineering = expense that improves pve/pvp.
---
&gt; "llluuuuul dunt talk lul whats your raiderio u dont even have achiev xoxoxo"
---
If you're getting these types of responses whenever you message anyone in retail, it might be that the way you initiate conversation is the root problem and people are just responding in kind.
---
If you act polite to people, 9 times out of 10 they're going to be polite back unless they're having a terrible day.  There's the 1 in 10 tryhards left, but find me an online game that doesn't have tryhards.  I guarantee we will have our set of such people in Classic and it will include both people who love retail and despise it.
---
why do they call it an xbox 360?
---
It's always going to be a mess using old information across 10 patches.  
---
  
---
Just chillax and wait for a fresh scrape of classic data. Pretty hard to populate a database accurate of a game that doesn't exist.
---
Curious about faerlina server. almost all the polls i have seen have show nearly identical to the approx percentages in this poll when it comes to pop. why does faerlina continue to show MUCH lower numbers then the other HIGH/FULL servers? any incite?
---
I saw someone say that elemental shamans are better tanks than enhancement thanks to generally bigger mana pool. Seems to make sense to me. May make drinking less necessary?
---
That's my plan as well. I never got to fully enjoy vanilla wow as I was trying to power level my character to catch up to a buddy. Ended up playing on too many alts instead and ended up barely getting to 60 before TBC.
---
This time I plan to focus on one character and explore the world more than last time. Plus I'm starting on Horde side, so this will be fun.
---
Think that was also added in BC...
---
&gt; In PvP, Crowd Control effects will last no longer than 12 seconds instead of the full duration, **with a chance of a heartbeat resist**.
---
not to nitpick but its only 1/15 of a sub now, which is $1
---
Or you could just... Not make a bitchy post and keep it to yourself?
---
According to the TotalRP dev, they are going to remove the API ability to access public channels and global information exchange.
---
Not sure how the addon survives that. It has to see what other people are posting just to do what it needs to do.
---
The changes won't limit addons ability to talk with guild members, etc.

his community isnt toxic and most dont play wow (probably) any1 can roll where ever they want to, if you are concerned then you have the option to move by yourself too.

---
any idea on something nobody can predict till servers are up a while? no

Yeah I'm super insecure bout my wiener that's why

My laptop is lesser quality and I run it at 50+ fps

Yup, tbc used the same system but put a hard cap of 12 seconds on. It's very similar in practice.
---
This guy transubstantiates.
---
Yes very upsetting how the greatest server to ever exist was given a pst time zone 😓😓😓
---
My friends are all on whitemane already, so im going by to my rp roots on the rppvp server.

---
If you switch to ESDF that'll open up an additional set of keys on the left!
---
I saved up some money and quit my job so I can play classic. A few months of saving and I'm good for a while.
---
Saw this on a stream. Hope it helps you as you can customize by number of people in your group, race, class, etc. classicwow.live/leveling
---
This same argument can be applied to retail and then you can see why that is a stupid argument.
---
New game plus in an mmo sounds like a really dope idea tbh.
---
Now that's what I call Pasta!
---
RwlRwlRwlRwl!!!

as a priest - the "Chase you down half of the map" rings true.

I've chased people trying to cast a spell, only to be out of range, typed in yell saying STOP im trying to buff you! /beg before caving into a whisper
---
Thank you for this link. Just bought 3 for groomsmen gifts. Now I need to get 3 horde ones for the rest!

i think its ridicilous that you would probably have to change the name, different cultures had different names for kings/dictators, and this is just one of the examples.

[To be fair you don't meet the minimum CPU specs for GW2 either.](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201862958-Minimum-System-Requirements)

That midriff. So good. Welcome back allies. /wave

---
If you're a tank and there is no hunter, blame the healer.
---
Agreed, I didn't want automation, but I do want some kind of ui to find the correct groups quicker.  I mean I'm leading a guild and probably wont need to use it much at all past dungeon grinding around level 50.
---
You really don't want them, I promise.
---
Google your threat!!!
---
Oh don't worry, my dog will get twice the dog park since I got the week off :D
---
I usually go 2 hours every night but since, I got off the whole week. I will go 2hours in the morning and two hours at night, I just have to get up earlier than usual that's it :D
---
Yeah too right people are reading into this way too much
---
I get it, but the game comes out in less than 48 hours.  Its just not going to be possible to contain the hype, and there is next to zero chance of anything substantial coming up before the new realms open Monday.
---
This is my plan :)
---
It should still boot fine and everything using the Windows generic driver. This means no hardware acceleration features though and so I don't know how your art software will react. Probably not well but it's gonna be a case of try it and see with this combo. Personally I enjoy that sort of stuff, but perhaps not on my main rig with &lt;48hrs to classic!
---
Rogues arent even that good tbh
---
Minkelz description is correct but I think it's hardcapped you can never get super long duration polys regardless of chance.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong
---
imagine a orc shaman running at you and his name was "windfairy", it would just give me more reasons to kill him.
---
Too true. I haven't spoken in chat since probably MoP, no reason to.  I miss the social aspect of WoW, it's one of the major reasons I bought the game.
---
actually the opposite if nice things=servers
---
What about using keybinds to type /spells? 🤔
---
0
---
Yep. Everyone I know is playing on different servers.with different friends and different factions.
---
I'll be on Blaumeux, playing by my onesies. Wishing my friends were around to play with.
---
Thinking of either of them as good or bad guys is already really undervaluing the complexity of the lore
---
Never expect a rez, but being a bro if someone wants to grab a drink is well being a bro.
---
Yup I take mine to the dog park for an hour or two everyday. This is the only thing that will prevent me from fully nolifing it
---
Solid advice, thank you
---
I can't believe how funny this still is..   
---
"Just let me finish this quest so I can get the trinket that lets me breathe underwater...

thanks for letting everyone know

I mean you'd have to be an idiot to play a hunter in vanilla.

God I hope we get transmog in 4 years.

Fear and Loathing....jezuz, Its like the drug version of stocking up for Oregon Trail.
---
Clueless
---
#Those particular ones are from Teldrassil, and they eat gold, so make sure you have a lot to keep feeding it.
---
Almost got banned in BC because i wrote some letters that said "play again" and one that said "you win" and listed them all on the AH, then spammed /2 about it.
---
Your username is fun
---
Dude, that applies for almost anything posted on reddit....
---
Congratulations on your new life and I hope you get healthier and happier. Don't forget to walk that gas out of your body!!!
---
I'm hoping it's that busy. The chat will be hilarious and itll be so great to see that many people playing.
---
I am going into grobbulus alone horde. Rppvp gonna love it
---
So much healthier thank fuck, guys this isn't even a joke if you consume nothing but junk food and energy drinks you will be one VERY sick
---
Trust me, I've been there done that sorta thing.
---
Also we're not teenagers anymore, our bodies can't handle a system shock like that anymore especially not after the abuse it's already gone through up to this point in our lives lol
---
New Servers will be up Monday ahead of the Launch, hopefully that will take some of the burden away.
---
Most people are already attached to their servers, and they have no intention of moving no matter what happens.
---
I don't think anybody dislikes the idea of finding a party faster or the idea of not having to read through trade channel spam, but the idea of it making people skip the whole "manual" human interaction required.
---
I'm hoping this is sarcastic because they aren't original at all, which is why it's so surprising they were still available.
---
Nose goes: add Alliance vendors :)
---
I think people are underestimating how hard it is to herd 40 cats. There will probably be one, but I'd be surprised if every server kills him in two weeks
---
Blame the Mage. He won't wait for threat, instantly AoE's and jumps around spamming arcane explosion, forcing me to switch.
---
Im gonna just stop healing dps lol
---
Pretty much.
---
When I first started playing the game, my friend who played told me Alliance is where all the young kids are, and Horde is for people that were serious in the game about PvP and end game. So I rolled Horde without thinking much about it.
---
Been Horde ever since then. Dabbled in Alliance a little bit, but can't take them seriously when their leader is Anduin. That and playing a big MMO fantasy game and just picking human or something just seems really silly to me.
---
*laughs in SI:7*
---
it is what it is i suppose, my research seems to say the same. I don't plan on using the art programs for a while, at least, so I'll have time to work it out. there's so much to learn with computers, I enjoy it as well. like solving a puzzle. I usually don't dive into it unless I need to fix something or solve a problem, however, but it can be enjoyable. Like learning how to dual boot, I had to move an mts file in order to partition the drive, and that was a pain, but it was very interesting, and now I have a new tool at my disposal for future computers.
---
and yes, with the launch so close, I'm just worried about it running wow at this point. I can always sort the rest out later, ha! thanks again for the help! if all else fails, i have my laptop, but the desktop is ideal. best of luck with your toons
---
Yes the logistics and character designs are the IP of blizzard and you can't use them for profit without the concent of blizzard.
---
RIP TY Hilton owners. But Lucks health is far and away the most important thing.   Let's see what Jacoby can do.
---
Then the addon moves to grab info from the private World channel?
---
You gonna get the classic shits.
---
That's what I thought.
---
Diabeetus
---
Feel like I played a different game compared to some of these people, I remember using tons of addons in classic for just about everything.
---
I remember doing it the entire expansion. Causal guilds definitely did.
---
I blamed the Hunter even when my group wiped in The Old Republic.
---

Intel® Pentium® Silver N5000 Processor

Intel® Celeron® N4000/N4100 Processor

are the 2 CPU options.
---
I was planing on looking for a raiding / pvp guild once I hit my 50's. No DKP or loot council though just open rolls.
---
How many servers in the retail list are currently “full”?
---
pog
---
It will be fun, and if you don't want a big queue, change server...they keep repeating that even low pop servers would be high/full by vanilla standards, so any server will be good enough..still, for long term I'd at least go for medium/high even if you want to avoid queues.
---
i raid as holy paladin and spend all time outside of raids as ret/reckoning because i like it in pvp. i dont feel limited by the "worse specs", and keep in mind most of the specs arent viable for raiding, but are good for everything else.
---
I think the idea with Priest in True Neutral is that they can be any of Holy (Good), Disc (Neutral/mix), and Shadow (Evil). 
---
Though I would agree they're generally much more Good aligned.
---
My friends want to play Paladins, guess it's Alliance this time around.
---
No, you can't disrupt their game, get banned and think they are just gonna turn around and give you your money back because you're claiming their product is not as advertised. That's not how consumer rights works. You can try to go to court over it, sure, but that's gonna cost you a ton of money and you're probably gonna lose, chances are you can't afford lawyers nearly as nice as the legal team blizzard is gonna throw at whatever you try to do, this legal team that is backed by an End-user agreement you agreed to when you bought their product. But hey, if that's how you think it works, go join one of those mafias. Let's see how long you last before the ban hammer comes crashing down. lmao. For reference, you should try looking up the mass ban that happened over a mining exploit early in legion. spoilers: european players got banned too.
---
I have always referred to Dungeon Set 2 as Tier 0.5. I farmed UBRS for my final shaman piece for way, way too long.
---
Isn't this the truth I've done expansion back in my day with Mcdoubles, NOS energy drinks candy all that shit you think is cool but it just makes you crash and sick like you said it might be bonus points to the nerdlings but it's not to yourself in the long run.
---
It took 200 played hours for most to get 60 back then...
---
Can confirm, full realms are really just a warning.
---
Human interaction of "Lf1m healer vc" "inv" ?  The human interaction will happen in the dungeon and party chat.  Not some one off whisper.
---
Who you be
---
Shhh you didn't see anything
---
If a dps is playing dumb I will stop healing them and let them run back.
---
What about Warcraft 4? Come on Blizzard!
---
You will. Might take a few hours but the tourists will give up which moves you up in the queue.
---
Think about it this way. Horde don't have to clog up their bags with a bunch of one time use items just waiting for the day that they feel it's worthy to use them. XD
---
From memory there was a "soft cap" of 15 seconds for long duration CC effects such as polymorph. After that point there was an extremely high chance of the CC breaking; so technically you could have a CC that lasts longer than 15 seconds although it'd be extremely unlikely.  
---
DR worked as 100% duration&gt;50%&gt;25%&gt;immune if I remember correctly and would reset within 15-20seconds of the target being afflicted by a CC effect.
---
The 12 second duration cap was introduced in TBC sometime.
---
classic will actually have crossrealm battlegrounds.
---
Im actually excited to do my meal prep, I'm making little home-made lunchables effectively
---
&gt;Third parties are making products that can have a drastic effect on Blizzards product and marketing.
---
lmao I can't believe you actually think this.
---
You think other people would come up with oberyn?
---
Statistically one of us is dying in the next two days.
---
Always leave the useless shit in the chest so someone else has to loot it?
---
Because you’re moving fast and killing everything in sight like a goddamn machine and you don’t feel like drinking until you leave the cave and the last guy is half dead. So you wand him down, he smacks you a few times, and then you dance on their corpses.
---
Closer to brm and menethil harbor
---
I was in 5th grade.
---
Get a vasectomy and sit on your ass for 3 days.
---
There are no private world channels. Channels that anyone can communicate in are public channels that will be restricted by the api changes.
---
TotalRP dev said the changes **will** kill a small part of TotalRP addon, since it uses the same channel communication, but it's just a small part of her addon.
---
I don't think ClassicLFG can get around this restriction.
---
I hear you. I would, but I'm sworn to Fairbanks.
---
MOM BATHROOM!! BATHROOM!!!
---
This is really well done, nice work.
---
every1 wants to feel special.
---
 Awesome! what does you lunchables consist of from a curious mind.
---
As far as what have been communicated no changes at all just a concurrent player cap so queues here we come
---
The location is a bit more convenient.
---
Cheetos... you'll have to waste time washing your hands... I'll be so ahead of you by the time you come back.
---
Ironforge feels like home. I love the Tauren starting zone and Shaman as a class but at the end of the day my gut says Alliance.
---
Play with me on Pagle. You can be my protege.
---
thanks for all the replies boys very reassuring &amp; stress has gone
---
Remember to to forget the word *doggo* please.

[Besides my dog was already taken care of.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_meat#/media/File:Dog_on_a_stick.jpg) /s
---
Where are the hot pockets?!?
---
Prob will get hurt playing classic and miss phase 1
---
Isn't it exciting as an adult? I mean, It feels like we're kids again waiting for our Birthday or Christmas.
---
Wholesome post
---
plenty of sub $600 options for desktops (not including keyboard, mouse, monitor or OS). 
---
if you need to stay mobile a slightly newer model will hold out longer. 
---
i'm going to guess the system hasn't been cleaned and is overheating. or the fans are finally going out.
---
just remember if you buy the lowest model dont expect it to last long in gaming years.
---
This is why, not to mention it's a smaller city than SW and getting around is a lot easier as you can cut through the great forge.
---
Where did I suggest that? Learn to read.
---
Put a tip in to Adam Schefter and get this thing rolling
---
What you have is called an "opinion".
---
Any one here playing alone on Herod, send me a PM. Starting a casual guild with a few friends, and we always welcome new faces!
---
Eww nestle
---
Blink removes stuns and root so undead mages could remove everything
---
Well I go shopping every couple of weeks like a normal adult so yeah
---
Imagine 40man raids without dbm
---
Ive seriously debated. Thats the sad part haha. Ill get my fix soon! Hopefully remote in after and done with queue when i get home
---
extra toasty cheez its are the best, eating regular ones now is disappointing
---
The Crimson Felt Hat is such a pimp hat.
---
No stormwind harbor so everything is closer from IF
---
Tauren cannot be warlocks.
---
sometimes forming a group can take hours though. It's a difficult situation.
---
Huh, I never actually thought much about it. I was in school so had sooooo much more time than now
---
not all the minmaxers will have all day to play, some have jobs, but in some countries if you are jobless you will get money from the government, thats one way.
---
Streamer server so a lot of people avoid it, because the streamer's followers tend to gang up on people. At least that's how I've heard it. Wouldn't be surprised if some switched, but...
---
You seem to have come a little unhinged over this . Take a break it’s out of your hands no reason to be as upset as you are over a add-on decision by blizzard.
---
Actually it's not a "flavorful" small detail, it's a fundamental part of your PvP MMORPG right down to why people want to play it again to begin with. When I see a skeleton in a monster camp, I now know someone is or was there and make necessary preparations. When I walk up to a new hub and see skeletons everywhere, I am now aware of mass pvp danger in my area and that's the absolute epitome of what your classic game immersion is about. 
---
Removing skeletons from the game in their classic iteration is just like saying we're removing chat because someone spelled a bad word. Report a rule breaking message like any other message communicated standardly in your game. Make skeletons an option in the settings. Randomize the way they lay on the ground. Limit how many active skeletons can exist on an account. 
---
Do anything BUT remove skeletons from the game. Period. It's such an amateur, not-thought-out move and I hope you guys come to your senses because that would be taking away from and potentially ruining all the goodwill you had going with this return to classic. Thanks.
---
I thought about playing Warrior.
---
Then I thought about how it might take 200-300 hours to hit the level cap. And another 100-200 hours to accumulate enough gear to really make Warrior start to shine.
---
And I was like "Hey, self, do you want to spend 500 hours in a 15 year old MMO you've already sunk thousands of hours in in order to grind a class you don't particularly enjoy in order to be OP right around the time you burn out completely and want to move on to another game?"
---
I wish the Warriors well.
---
Yeah it's like we get to be kids again
---
&gt;Also it feels a lot safer being entombed within a mountain.
---
I mean, isn't that the reason everyone loves it? :D
---
It's an image of the print screen button, implying that you should use that button to save the screen to your clipboard and then paste it into your preferred image editing program.
---
No wonder you're all fucking fat.
---
Not for leveling
---
It’s faster but it’s not as automatic as flight is :P
---
Ally, as I'm always trying my best to make my character most like my irl self. There are belfs, so human is as close as I can get.
---
Dragon Age Origins is still the best RPG format I've played. Various start zones/missions that tie into the offer arching narrative. Which ever story you chose customizes your play through at least some extent.
---
I feel like if SW:ToR was an offline game I might have enjoyed it more. Let me couch coop with friends in the dungeons and single player 90% of the time. I really need the save/load for the amount of dialog that happened.
---
So do all the other major cities. This is not early vanilla, classic is later in the cycle.
---
PrintScr
---
Dat's gonna be meeeeeeee. Druid buffs fore everyone!!!

😂😂😂
---
Damn dude you're gonna be playing over 8 hours a day and still worried about being "left behind" 
---
Take a chill pill and relax
---
Oh it's a big black dwarf
---
Oh wow... I was goi g to stay away from used models... I guess I wont be havking one any time soon but I still want to replace the one I had. Great system.
---
Thank you
---
I used to seek and destroy the torch bearers on my rogue and light the braziers before the rest of the party started clearing. I don’t remember how I dealt with the elementals, probably a potion.
---
It is damn surreal. It's a huge mix of emotions we barely ever get to feel much less in high potency
---
Someone mentioned that vanilla addons used channels created specifically for party/raid/guild chat, which would allow basic functionality without creating a faction-wide network.
---
Good to know, thank you.
---
I heard that post.
---
Add ons do have an effect on the game.
---
No one cares. Surprising...you're a streamer. I'm shocked.
---
My guild is playing on a PvP server and I'm not into that. Too many PTSD flashbacks of Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK on an unbalanced PvP server. 
---
I'm too much of a scrub casual to really care about playing with friends. If I make WoW friends, cool. If not, cool.
---
I use them the same as I use my face tattoos and body modifications it deters people and keeps me safe from social interaction
---
Well met, fellow man of culture! I, too, enjoy dining with the Baron.
---
If you average 60 hours, that will be 10 days played in a month. Speed record is a bit less than 5 days. So if you are focused with 10 days played it should be no issue.
---
This is not how that works at all
---
Horde always have the majority, but it wont be that bad, usually 55% horde. It's mostly because horde have better pvp racials, orc stun resist is literally OP as fk
---
Yeah i got alot of time on my hands, Im sure its just my ADD riling me up
---
Portion control is the biggest focus for me right now. I have specifically selected Tupperware containers that are sandwich sized (like normal loaf of bread slice size) and no larger, enough for a satisfying small meal.
---
I've been wanting to do this for aaages but have never found the motivation. Long ass story short I have depression, used to be fit, got fat, fast forward 5ish years, begin to recover, discover that weed cures all of my symptoms (lol rip medical bills) and now I'm on the wonderful tack to being functional again! But I've got a ways to go and this is yet another step I need to take to reclaim my life from the clutches of the NEET demon lol
---
&gt;Mfw weed and wow will be responsible for a drastic improvement in my quality of life
---
Just because you were still shitting your britches and had no awareness of these things does not mean they didn’t happen
---
i say we don't remind them and let natural selection do its thing.
---
I am glad I am not the only one.
---
Nah sometimes you go ass to mouth.
---
Thank you, I wish more people would understand
---
For starters, its a game so who gives a shit. That being said, if you shred, you'll have a spot. I'd kick a trash kid out mid raid if he was garbage and I knew there was someone good hopping on.
---
This seems like almost the same view as in the OG Trailer. 
---
Is it possible to get this view in game on one of the mountains right by IF?
---
For some reason I thought the 'Little Hug' box was diapers.
---
I was thinking 'man this person really is ready'...
---
Not sure if you're aware -- but Priests in vanilla have race-specific abilities, and Night Elves have the worst by far (worse than wanding typically).
---
Just wanted to let you know, I got messed up by that when I played on Nostalrius :P
---
That's pretty hype not gonna lie. Is south park on hulu?
---
Well a raid guild with that many people is way too big
---
Please re-read and try to understand how it's not about the ClassicLFG addon at all, but how the whole situation was and is being handled.
---
Instead of going to school I was going to internet cafes to play WoW and w3 dota spending fortune there, because despite having cable internet connection at home parents wouldn't let me play more than 1h a day(I was damn 16 at that time).   
---
Instead of sleeping at night before going to school I would, how I called it back then, 'fake sleep' - so simply pretend to be sleeping while in fact waiting for everyone else to go to sleep so I can play the game.   
---
Often my mom would hide mouse so during those times I was just grinding mobs with keyboard only without even looting them as I didn't know how to do that without mouse.   
---
In general was fun times to have parents that are technologicaly retarded.
---
Haha
---
I didn't say all of you =P
---
So many warriors keep talking about getting their wirlwind axe... BUT AS A HUNTER!
---
initial box art (chic elf on cover) wasn't the type of box art that made me interested in a game, and this from an original retail war1 and diablo1 buyer.
---
I have no idea how they play out as I haven't played vanilla. I guess a human priest might be a better choice? I just thought a dwarf priest would be better with fear ward.
---
Its meant as a guilt trip man, some people do own dogs that they do neglect. Its sad, its not right, but its real.
---
I gotta agree. These aren't that great.
---
yeah nice
---
Just get there when you get there. I’m quite confident most people won’t hit 60 for a month.
---
So many just don’t remember how slow the leveling process was.
---
To be honest, no one gets left behind. Its might be better to slow it down, other people will get gear and carry you through stuff.
---
See, this solves your problem. One of two things will be true, enough of your guild can easily run more than 1 Raid Group per week and you can join the second one and fight your way up or there isn't enough to do that and you can compete for spot knowing that more players are coming up behind to form a second Raid group. You're in a good spot man, level at your own pace.
---
If I only ate pizzaroni's I'd be on the toilet too much to play.
---
These where the greatest investment and a digital scale but you don't need as scale just go by the Palm and Hand size portion chart but I'm counting micros so I use a scale to narrow down.

Amazing work, Do you happen to create any art for Final Space, looking at your portfolio it seems to fit the art style.
---
Who needs groupfinder when you have allies
---
Fucking hot.
---
why waste time on pushups, when you could be leveling.
---
Im going in alone but I hope I meet some people on my journey.
---
I mean everyone isnt gonna raid, its a local streamers guild so alot just join for fun. I guess my add is just acting up. Didnt even consider all people might not even get to 60
---
That is a pretty good one. XD
---
I see a lot of correlations with prison exercise programs. Coincidence?
---
Oh you did work for Final Space, amazing tv show!
---
What server you on? I’ll be holy pally on Mankrik and can spam that FoL.
---
This annoys me beyond all belief. Every bad server is the 4chan server. It's like literally droning on, "[POLITICAL PARTY] is LITERALLY Hitler because I don't like them". Stop lumping people into gross demographics.
---
In home streaming on my surface. I am prepared.
---
I'm not a dps druid!
---
I swapped to alliance because of the imbalance. Alliance will likely have instant queues in battlegrounds while horde will have to wait it out. Been horde 90 percent of the last 15 years.
---
Dead serious, if you're the type to get hooked on an rpg with moderate competitive likeness, this is the one. I've played it for 14 years and don't plan on stopping. I've quit on and off a couple of times but always, always come back.
---
On an RP to server it works. On a normal or PvP server it's people calling you blackbear. At least that how I feel about it. That why I went with Shatter man, because I enjoy shittting on people's chest j/k I'd never pick the name shatterman.

No.

Alliance because I played Horde at the time way back when.

Shake it up a bit.

Yeah depression is a bitch! same here though was never fit. I've been stuck in a dark pit for years to even count and finally some things have happened that made me grow up and I've been battling with it ever since and recently came to the realization that fixing my body is a big turning factor towards self happiness

Absolutely played Vanilla at about 10fps and during some boss fights and trash pulls it would drop to 5fps.
---
Yeah I was going to say this. Horde are definitely the good guys according to the lore. Humans are the worst. That being said I'm rolling human this time for that reason!
---
setting up keybinds doesnt take long if you are used to them.
---
I remember hearing that way back when. I wonder if theres a running list of confirmed celeb wow players?
---
With 200 people, there’s gonna be a group in the guild you will find  to raid with.  I wouldn’t about it.
---
i bet you know a lot about cringed looks huh?
---
1. Be a pro at your class. Know the ins and outs, what's and what nots, and be willing to help others. Also, don't take every guide you read to heart, play around with your priest. See what works best. Fuck what others say, numbers speak for themselves.
---
This is the equivalent of a chair being a race in classic wow and you picking the name 'sit' for it - I'm not blown away at all.

Yee, 0 carbs so it's keto. I'm also gonna meal prep Monday morning and have ~3 days worth of meals ready. Just hate peeling so many eggs at once lmao.
---
If it ain't broke don't fix it!
---
You don't HAVE to die a lot. You die when something unexpected happens. Or if you're a noob. Don't stress. Take it easy and safe, you'll be fine.
---
first tip would be dont roll on those servers that are clearly full, there will be way more servers launched at launch, lets just hope its enough i quess (tho i bet not).
---
This is big yikes.
---
That's great and all until you realize vanilla pvp was incredibly unbalanced lmao. Maybe this was one of the reasons.

Are you scared beta? Anything you see on classic add-on resources are fine to use.
---
I think he'll be downed pretty quickly and I definitely don't want classic to fail. At this point, there are way too many people caught up in the idea that they have to be "world first" to get any enjoyment out of the game. 
---
If anything, I feel bad for all the people rushing as they will run out of content faster than the people slowly making progress.
---
Yeah, seriously. It’ll be fine.
---
Well, yeah if you stay afk. Most afker's will stay afk the majority of the time, but hit something every now and then so they don't get flagged. 
---
And I was told here on reddit when I asked about it, but that is also why I said I don't know how true it was.

The shit-pit spiral as I lovingly call it is a nasty one.

Get sad, do nothing, get fat, get more sad, do even less, on and on.

It takes true champions of the alliance/horde to break out of that one. Bit by bit we just keep chipping away at the Boulder and eventually we'll break the whole damn thing

Learned an item from Madseasonshow that I'll probably stuck up on as well, [magic candle](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1399/magic-candle) that has a 28%ish drop rate from kobold geomancers in Elwynn. It provides a 1.5 sec cast ranged attack option with a 4 sec dot, which can be useful for a little bit of everything.
---
Typing out /cast spells with the onscreen keyboard
---
Yeah sadly people don't (want to) realize that.
---
My guess is the server cap is 50k...a 75% drop off at phase 2 (also guess) still brings the server to 12.5k at phase 2.  That's still to high
---
Nice clock radio
---
Fuck yeah it is! Classic has brought back to me the faction rivalry I remember from my childhood and I fucking love it.
---
dungeon grinding is slower than questing, and who wants to grind all day every day the same exact dungeons, you will go mentally ill. tho it could be faster if launch is a huge zerg, but cant say for sure because of layering.
---
Bloodsail isn't Full.
---
I believe Blizzard's anti-cheat system will detect AutoHotKey as a cheat. I definitely would not use it with WoW.
---
I strongly doubt they think this is OK.
---
I understand it's helpful. I just wouldn't risk it.
---
I'm pretty sure you interfering with the mouse is the same thing a bot program would do. You'll get banned almost certainly.
---
Guys.  I’m going to gain weight playing this game.
---
IIRC Dwarf had the best one by a lot, plus their regular racial is pretty solid for priest too.
---
To be clear I don't want to disparage your choice if you're set on Night Elf, it's just something that can make a pretty big difference and isn't reversible once you make the choice :)

I want to know the best class race combo without duplicating a class,race. What do you suggest?
---
are you sure you dont just need to poop?
---
This may by why Zygor changed to a monthly subscription service instead of players buying the guides like they used to years ago.
---
Loot systems need to be applicable to your (guild) type. Fundamentally if you don't have unanimous consent between all applicable parties someone is going to feel it is unfair.
---
***
---
A "loot council" (and the purpose of) is to optimise everything as much as feasibly possible based on RNG drops and 'by the numbers'. It requires a 'hive-mind' mentality of all guild members/participants, otherwise personal desires get mixed in and it all goes to hell, every single loot drop and distribution should have been planned and mapped out even before a boss is attempted (because otherwise you wouldn't have been able to find the optimal progression path). The characters belong to the guild and the 'person' operating the character is fairly immaterial (as long as they keep showing up, week after week and follow orders, think military organisation).
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
The complete opposite end of the spectrum is one where you value the individual behind the characters, and not the specific characters themselves. 'Person XYZ' obtained loot (regardless of what character they were on/planing at the time of the loot). [Loot is assigned in a method, similar to this](https://imgur.com/t5aG9gF) where you keep track of who (person) got loot (and relative value of that loot), rather than what character received it. It's pretty much an extension of organic friendships/relationships you develop when running dungeons. If you have a regular group of players then someone may get loot the first time you run the instance, the next time someone else will be up for loot. It's like when you go 'righteous orb' farming in live strat, everyone gets a righteous orb before anyone else can get a 2nd (and you remember this, who has already gotten the loot to ensure a fair distribution). I could do one run as a tank, one run as a dps, one run as a healer, it's irrelevant what character I'm on as long as I can do my job (so we get the loot) and I don't get to be at +2 loot whilst someone else might be +0.
---
I value people (not their avatars, but the people who control them), so I'd be heavily weighted toward a loot system similar to the later example than the former. If you do a favor for me then I owe you one, if I got the last slice of pizza this time then next time it's yours. Our 'relationship' is what I find important (the fact that you're willing to spend time with me on an on-going basis, instance-after-instance, raid-after-raid).
---
A relationship that stems from a foundation of people wanting to be/do things together is much more stable (long term) than one where you milk each other for all you're worth, or you're forced into against your will.
---
In the latter example (the one I linked) no-one will ever realistically get more than ±1 loot compared to any other member unless someone is intentionally going out of their way to 'pass' on all loot. It also means you can literally play any character you feel like during the raid and you're free to swap between characters as you wish.
---
+ It isn't likely to lead to 'optimal' progression speed (because you're not theorycrafting dictating everything to get the maximum numbers)
---
+ The 'happiness' of your raiders though will be through the roof (because they're getting loot in a fair way without any BS and they can literally play anything they want to play as they feel like it).
---
You could have the most 'productive' employee in the world, but if they hate their job they'll quit (and that hurts you massively as you lose their productivity and any investments you made into them). An employee who is maxed out on happiness but is not necessarily the most productive (as long as they're productive enough within tolerable thresholds) is unlikely to ever quit on you. In 'vanilla', plenty of 'tanks' got poached when Nax came around which would have been impossible if the players cared about their relationships with their guild members, people who they spent weeks/months/years raiding with up until that point in time.
---
Yes it will. Once people on long Q servers cant get in they will go to new server. Also tens of thousands will sub day of launch
---
What cert are you going for? 
---
I'm pretty much in the same boat. Full time job studying for certs and other random life chores.
---
Hes saying you have to feed them a lot, so they cost a lot of gold to keep.
---
Hmmm perhaps I mistook the scale of them, that looks pretty slick
---
Same I was wondering about skeram as well as it's only non full PvP server
---
Feel free to poke fun at alliance. It'll just make watching you struggle to try to kill me that much more satisfying.
---
The math is there. Better pull out a calculator and figure it out. You've got 48 hours left Omgzjustin
---
How though? I have the twitch desktop client installed but have no idea how to find JUST classic addons. I appreciate your help
---
I had a laptop when I was a kid and had to tape the battery cable into the connector at a funny angle. It got me by.
---
I’m flaccid
---
I put all of my specials items in one the last bags, then I intentionally filled that bag's remaining slots up through one means or another, and basically just kept that bag full at all times. That's how I knew there was nothing in that bag I was supposed to sell.
---
I envy her, truly, I do.  I would love to forget what I know and go into Classic as a complete noob.  It’s such an adventure and I hope she enjoys it.  May your queues be short and may your loot be epic!
---
Not set at all, fixed it. :D Thanks.

I've lost 12kg over the summer just so that I can play this.
---
In retail you can literally just use the first 5 of 2-3 action bars and like you said Alt 1-5 Ctrl 1-5.
---
Find another Guild.  Classic is as much the enjoyment of leveling &amp; community as end content raiding.  There's no reason to worry about being left behind.
---
If you forget to interrupt, claim it missed/resisted.
---
cocaine?
---
Back to the future.
---
Well you didnt mention how you were planning 5o get a mount at 40 without farming for gold. So maybe explain yourself in full and dont react in such a negative way. Like dude we are just having a convo get a grip.
---
Can also mean disturbed, distracted, confused. Literal synonyms. Just take a chill man it’s not worth so much anger lol. Look at how many comments you have made already.
---
Oooh! Will look into this.
---
Correct, thank you for pointing it out to other people!
---
Given that tons of people haven't even subbed yet, and that plenty of people will jump off their chosen server after sitting in a queue for an hour, yeah, It most likely will fill up pretty quickly, along with every other sever that isn't full yet. Though I doubt it the queues will be as bad on them as something like Herod or Faerlina will be.
---
But that one guy has a hamster wheel... clearly a superior helm crafted by an experienced engineer!
---
Humans are the OG bad guys. Even so horde is not bad. They come from a different world where they live off of land and are not so dependent on structures. Different then real life so why not
---
How do you eat like that for more than a day and not feel awful.
---
you really should mind, because that makes it so people avoid guild runs in dungeons because every1 can roll need on the item and trade it to their guildie who needs it. this has happened to me alot in wotlk servers.
---
Great choice! This meme always makes me smile.
---
Group up

I can't wait :)

Damn bro how do you strafe?

Perhaps, they just seem like a nice group of people to me

I actually used this recently lol. I was flying around in dun morogh and accidentally dismounted, realised I didn’t have divine shield bound and managed to type it before I hit the ground!
---
Maybe they'll patch it soon if it is this way still, I don't they'll keep classic as classic for long.
---
They have a lot of things like this.. dressing through walls, jumping to exploit things in WSG, that kind of stuff that is definitely not intended but they keep it in to make it the true classic experience.
---
Even having a few randomly tallet tallstrifers in the barrens.
---
Yeah nice try but what rings
---
You...make requests and then alt-tab? Heh wanting to keep the automated addon makes sense now :)
---
I don't know about whatever server you played on, but on mine it was far from people just pinging /2 as fast as they could slam a macro hotkey. People used trade and LFG still, but they also asked in the general chat of zones, near instances, etc. I saw that during the stress test as well.
---
Anyway no point arguing, you do it your way and I'll do it mine. I'm leveling as a tank and am reasonably competent, so I won't have any issues finding groups my way.
---
Make a holy priest one and I'll buy it immediately.

---
WeakAuras are being deliberately stupid here.
---
They of all people should know that Blizzard never engages in discussions as to the *exact* line in the sand an AddOn is breaking. The whole 'engage in dialogue' means WeakAuras want Blizzard to commit to saying exactly what the AddOn is breaking *at this moment*. This way WeakAuras would then be free to find another way of providing the exact same functionality that Blizzard has clearly stated they want to completely eradicate.
---
This is the exact reason why Blizzard has always used the 'Orbital Ion Cannon' approach in cases like this: Nuke everything from orbit, shame about any collateral damage. (Raid Nameplates, Raid Radar, WQ Helper, etc.)
---
In other words: Unless WeakAuras backs off and admits defeat, Blizzard will crush as much as the API as is needed to stop them. The fallout on other unrelated AddOns might not be pretty if this drags on for a while.
---
Blizzard will not be taking prisoners. They never have in situations like this.
---
Mind control and then speak normally using custom emotes :D
---
How do you say please stop hitting me I'm busy,  I won't go oom I'm trying to quest . As alliance
---
They would need to implement sharding or bump spawn rates to ridiculous levels which would suck when you're alone in a zone.
---
Agreed

Been more excited for this than really any other game in years, and while I knew I'd love it and have fun with it, I didn't quite realize until I played some of the Beta/Stress-Tests just how much.

My parents got divorced right around when vanilla came out. Went from being a happy but quiet 5th grader to an empty shell of my former self so my parents agreed to get me a computer and WoW (primarily because they felt guilty telling me about the divorce the day before my birthday). I had played Warcraft 3, but WoW was a whole new beast.
---
 They got sick of me ignoring them when I was playing, especially my mother, who was still bitter about the divorce because I’m her mind I should’ve supported her even though she was the one who initiated said divorce. So she decided to withdraw my birthday gift, so I would sneak into her room and grab my laptop from under her nightstand and play in my bunk bed fort. I eventually became a main tank in a guild working on AQ40, with raids being from 8pm-12am. Well one night after we finished for the night, I passed out with the laptop on my lap in my bed.... woke up to my mom screaming at me about disappointment and some other crazy shit. Just took the laptop to dads and told her I was staying with him full time 🤷‍♀️  He travelled a lot so Azeroth was my oyster over there hahaha.

I don't see the problem. The game isn't even out yet, people having nothing else to do but meme WoW
---
Especially in classic because we didn't have whole UI add-ons. One for action bars, another for cast bars, a third for unit frames, a fourth for raid frames, dbm, ktm, damagemeter, titan panel and its 20 modules, auctioneer, atlas, etc.

Texas a population about 29 million and the next highest states are about 5-6 million. That if you factor in the population of the others central states, their population is about 32.75 million. In short it was a near 50-50 chance you were in Texas.

(what I consider the central states: Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma)
---
But the regen isn't the best passive racial either. Axe weapon skill and 5% more HP are both better passive racials for a tank. The Regen is completely irrelevant. Stop trying to back pedal... you were just talking out of your ass. Noone thinks that regen is important for threat, AT ALL.

Let’s just be glad to get more subscribers first, so there is a bigger userbase at launch and more fun.
---
why don't you think for a change you little retard. here's what I said to the other guy:
---
1. spell batching in classic is nothing like the way it was in vanilla
---
2. spell batching in general now is clunky and laggy and feels like shit. we got used to playing smoothly thanks to retail and private servers and we don't need that shit. we are not in 2005. maybe we can take it a step further and also buy a shitty old monitor with that big box behind that and garbage internet so we can have tHe aUthEntIc vAnIlLa eXpEriEnCe amright
---
get a clue kid
---
Yeah, but it resounds through the ages. Wherever there is WoW, there are hunters needing on cloth armor and +spirit daggers, wiping the group with idiotic pulls, stealing mobs from their own faction, asking for a 90% discount on ports, RPing some bastardized Dragonlance/Bible Black fanfiction thing, etc.
---
Yeah lol that's the conclusion I've come to , blammo it is !

I was a Diablo 2 junkie.. and couldn't justify paying for a game and then having to subscribe on top of it.

You can seen more on my website which I linked in my original post.  Sadly no,I can't take commissions right now.  I don't have very much free time these days.  And the bit i do have I would like use for wow.  So sorry about that.
---
I hope you're right and can resist the urge. I think the social aspect of the game will hook you. They say that the types of brain chemicals that gets released when you and your guildies, through dedication and coordination, work together to down a raid boss is very similar to the ones that gets release if you were to participate in a team sport. The dopamine rush you get when you got a rare drop that you know will make you bank. The satisfaction of getting that juicy best in slot piece to drop and land in your bag. The sense of camaraderie when your mates show up to curb stomp on the scum that ganked you in your favorite farming spot, ect
---
God I forgot about hunters having to dismiss pets cause they would pull the whole dungeon. Good times.
---
Me herb.  Me gather.
---
*Herb gathering*
---
I mean, define overtake.
---
Will it have more concurrent players? Of course. Especially at launch.
---
Will it *sustain* a higher player base than BFA, even when BFA is launching a major content patch? I doubt it. But who knows really. 
---
I do think there are a lot more people that like retail WoW than people think. Lots of players that aren't active on forums, and just play the game. You have to remember the loudest people are only the ones who are upset.
---
God damn. This thread is 🔥🔥🔥
---
Never, said "interesting and cool", I said "civilized and intelligent". Not surprising a horde got confused reading though. You guys even have books? In your lil mud and poo huts?
---
That rare dagger has +2 strength and I have melee moves, I must have it.
---
In that case my lacking English skills may be in play here.
---
The way I read the Tweet, I understood that WeakAuras are the developers of the LFG AddOn. How else are they able to predict that it will continue to work, despite Blizzard taking action against it?
---
Yea modern wow has given the horde a turn at being the baddies, but seeing as this is a classic wow subreddit I'd figured we would be considering things as per classics timeline.
---
Yes, it is. They have every episode and they get new episodes the day after they air live.
---
Closer to every raid except ZG than SW. People still go to SW for ony/nef buff but outside of that IF is better.
---
Also stalag is German for prison camp
---
The disc/holy build is probably more up your alley, I am not well versed in that build but its the priest (nonshadow) pvp build generally.

---

Thank you for the cringe hahaha.
---
Never saw those names why would you call them special
---
&gt; I'm talking about the strength of Hardiness compared to just FAPs when dealing with rogues regardless of what class you play.
---
Hardiness is RNG, FAP is not, and FAP itself is going to be a staple of PvP on all classes. The chance of you getting 2 stuns on an Orc is below 50% chance, even a coin-flip gives you better odds.
---
If you're not assuming the worst (and taking the appropriate counter-measures) it's going to come and royally bite you in the arse. It's why you don't use 5CP kidneyshots against classes who can trinket stun until you know they've used their trinket (and so on and so forth).
---
If you've lost your initiative (e.g. because you've opened into unfavorable odds and had to bail) it isn't in your best interest to continue the engagement. This holds up even more so when it isn't a 1v1 scenario and the opportunities to 'drop combat' (both yourself, and your opponent) are unlikely.
---
If you're willing to gamble on whether your stun will/will not work, by all means you can plan your engagement under the assumption that everything goes your way, but that's a massive risk you're taking. Most people strive to minimise risks (in Rogue terms, that means not relying on stuns unless you're 100% sure of success).
---
In group combat (which is what battlegrounds are) you're not going to be getting off any stuns in a decisive battle. It's not exactly like if you're at a Blacksmith zerg and then the Warriors have all suddenly popped free action potions that you can just  'sit-out' 30 seconds, by that time they would have already steam-rolled the rest of your team and the battle is lost.
---
We all play WoW - we all smell and drool on ourselves.

I miss good-natured shit-talking like this. Back when Horde and Alliance leaders were mostly out of the picture so Blizzard couldn't make them so utterly unlikable.

Horde had the best leader to begin with, but come on Blizzard...Garosh *and* Sylvanas?
---
Dude your name is close.
---
Still a rad name
---
As far as I know, "goibon uden lo" is "Guards, help me!" from NPCs.  From that translation, I'm not sure if bur would be "lol," as is commonly known, or another random three letter word (as in "help me plz" if another Alliance was near).  IIRC the garble function matches characters per word, but I'm not sure exactly how it works.

We get to experience what it would be like if we could go back to an older time with the knowledge we have now. Which is something people often say for like highschool or something, but its something that is actually possible with WoW. So regardless of how anyone feels about WoW in general, that is pretty neat.
---
Care to explain the difference? 
---
It still checks and parses chat, allows you to invite them. It Even allows you to filter classes.  Writes in the chat. 
---
What Is the difference between this and LFG?
---
The UI is PERFECT!

When opposite faction: doesn’t gank you when you are fighting 2 mobs, saves you instead and /wink at you then runs off

I just use reddit on my phone. I’m a weirdo.

No you didn't.

I thought i was going to have a decent amount of time, but then I received unfortunate news, and may not be able to play much at all

I'm pretty sure that is the Alliance gang sign he is throwin' up!

youd need to play 16 hours a day to do it in 10 days, and that would be coming close to a world record..

I was "Goodherbs" the herb gathering tauren in tbc. He's back for classic, lets see if it can get laughs in two (going on three) different decades.
---
lol
---
Non stackable means 1 item 1 back space?
---
His other videos on his zackrawrr channel are all similar, this is him as a person, not asmongold the stream persona.
---
Check YouTube vids, just search wow classic and im sure on the first page at least one will be class selection vid.
---
Their target audience is old players. I don't think is correct.
---
If you really want to go hard at the leveling, you should only eat 1 meal per day and limit carbs. Also no beer.
---
But your way is totally more fun.
---
No dude I need stuff to do for 48 hrs and navigating to another sub is alotta work
---
Hold right click and press A or D?
---
Players have been crying about Multiboxing since Vanilla launch. We're still here. Google WoW multiboxing, guarantee there is 10,000+ threads archived of users crying about it.
---
I just thought it was funny, the comic had reminded me of it and I figured others might enjoy it too :)
---
3/3
---
Might check out a few videos or so.
---
Goddamn hunters...
---
Yeah I should have put Monday in the title but hopefully people will still get the gist
---
So I've googled it, but can you help me decide which guide is best? I've provided an image to reference  
---

---
I'd instantly leave a guild that had more than like 50 active raiders, 200 people is so overkill it's hilarious. At that point split off into 4 separate guilds.
---
I'm certainly not trying to be sneaky or underperform. From what I have heard, priests are top by quite a bit when it comes to healing in classic. Using that, plus learning your class really well and having decent gear, i feel like theres some room to work on DPS/PvE without letting a raid down or underperforming too much
---
well wands I can see as a way to make gold
---
Nah it’s cool haha, all in good fun.
---
I mean, uh, Lok’tar Ogar, get crushed Alliance scum!
---
Yeah... no lol.
---
Every server released this far and likely the new ones for launch will be full on launch. There are a lot of folks trickling in now and a ton who refuse to sub until just before or the day of.
---
Saw this on bnet:

It's not irrelevant... when pulling the tank will automatically get threat on all mobs right off the bat if no one else has generated threat. That's actually huge. Say you need to pull a pack of 5 mobs and it's gonna be rough, the mage is gonna poly, or the rogue is gonna sap. You the troll throw a throwing dagger during the pull, you automatically get threat on every mob because the mage/rogue haven't gotten any threat yet.
---
If a pack of adds aggros your group, you automatically get threat and they run towards you... It's super helpful for any group content.
---
Lol, that should be kinda fun.
---
nope it wasn't

Damn that sucks wedding is the same day as classic I'd dip my own wedding
---
I really doubt it matters unless you're playing on a potato. On retail, Performance dips the worst by far in raid combat, most other times UI is a non-factor. On classic, raid combat (even with 40 people) will be *much* less burdensome on your computer because the combat is much simpler and much less spammy.
---
Also doubt that the lack of multithreading changes much. Even though it has multithreading, Retail is still single core bottlenecked.
---
Exactly. Sometimes I even go extreme and rebind S for a defensive ability, because back-peddling is usually bad in most games, forces me to strafe run and gives me an additional keybind.
---
First you are looking at skewed data due to what statisticians call “non-probability sample” and “self-selection bias”. Even if the polls were correct high pop servers would start to become balanced due to those restriction with the a/h disbalance goin toward the low pop servers that people move away from.
---
Well you seem like a good idea to ask this question to since you mentioned "best in slot". 
---
I'm avoiding guides and spoilers for the most part. I did a bit of research about classes and races but that's really it. Will I know when I get an item that is BIS? Do I have to go out of my way to get BIS or will the game lead me to them naturally?
---
Either way I don't think I need to worry about it till I get to a higher level right?
---
So wholesome
---
Yeah, I definitely know where you are coming from as well. I do think that a lot of the private server community will likely be on Herod though. At least out of all the east-coast servers. 
---
 Imo the community is going to be quite shocked when they see just how long the queues will be so the others servers they open will fill fast.
---
Beautiful !
---
Need a duo ideally or you're wasting energy on gouge or a kidney shot. 
---
I'd go 2 points remorseless, 8 points combat to improved daggers, subtlety for 5 points opportunity for start in that order.
---
That way, you're chain killing enemies and getting 100% crit bush openers and backstabbing with 30% more crit.
---
Murder isn't bad for leveling for extra damage on humanoid and beasts. Improved expose armor is nice to help shreds guys, but you'll overwrite sunder armor in dungeons. Cold blood and seal fate is nice.
---
Can we get some history behind this screenshot.... like age.... fixing UI after an update that broke it or something....
---
Surely you did not really play with that UI.
---
having the same issue... my wife says "i did it all already ive raided through every xpac why would i wanna start over"  
---
driving me up the fucking wall.. looks like im going it solo
---
hey so I was mistaken.. Dont have a char reserved on farelina and now it's full. My buddy and I are going to probably go to a different server, just us two so far.. Would you be willing to roll on a different? I'll probably go priest/shadow and I'm not sure what he's planning on
---
Zygor classic guide is not even out yet
---
&gt;they are considering addons like these to be against the spirit of classic WoW
---
I would contest them on that. More precisely which part of the addon? I dont like the idea of automated group makings (just click search and you are matched up to a group) but auto invite based on a codeword can be a functional tool. For example whisper potato to raidleader to get an invite. 
---
Also should the lfg channel be accross all layers I could see problems in reading that in the start. If there was a tool to help filter that a bit I would take it (if it is as messy as I'd think)
---
I’d love if they kept releasing new never before seen content in the classic vein. Maybe the other side of Azeroth and we do a bunch of exploring and non world ending raids etc there.
---
Or if they redid BC/WOTLK but with classic mechanics and game design in mind. Unrealistic but it’d be cool
---
I was 11 when the Make Love Not Warcraft episode was released and it made me want to desperately play the game. My dad wasn't willing to put his credit card information on a website he didn't especially trust so I could further delve down the rabbit hole of my PC but instead, I saved my allowance and started playing Guild Wars. Played that for a few years, dabbled in some WoW instant 70 private servers when I could wrap my head around that, then started with my real life friends shortly after Wrath launch when I discovered prepaid visas.
---
The tram is faster and better in a rush, but the fp is click and forget, better if you're lazy.
---
Alright, well that makes me hopeful. I remember people on this sub really wanting a RPPVP server, and now they got one, but I didn't really hear much from those people in particular after that.
---
I’m assuming by take 2 you mean a wow 2 but staying true to vanilla gameplay then I would assume so.
---
Losing a lot of money if not because eventually classic experience will end and just releasing tbc, world will also come to an end if they go that route.
---
Eventually new content will need to be created (not retail, current wow is to far gone in the wrong direction)
---
It’s time for a fresh reset. A new base lore to build off of, new main characters, classes, everything.
---
They can still keep current wow going and that can cater to a different crowd as it currently does.
---
They can keep the cash shops, flying mounts, welfare epics and group finder in regular wow. 
---
I’m not holding my breath for wow 2 though.
---
My hope is I can enjoy wow classic for 1-2 years and by then pantheon mmo will be our by then.
---

Grobbulus is the NA RPPVP realm, the server subreddit has almost 3k members already. Off the top of my head, most RP happens in events or between the more hardcore RPers. Emotes are popular for communication, and not RPing is considered ok as long as you are polite about it. I like saying the Tauren npc voice lines (may the ancestors watch over you, walk with the wind, etc) anyway, so I figured going RP was the next logical step.

I would LOVE to see an expansion on uldum in a pre-cata state or even more content in sithilis post-c'thun death. Perhaps a new questing zone? Maybe a new group forms and tries to get revenge or something idk.

I feel hyjal should be open but not much other than a questing zone and kind of just an exhibit for lore.

Tbh the ally one looks better even though I'm horde
---
Dang brother sorry. Hope you find something. Costco sometimes has really good deals on laptops. Otherwise the gear that is coming out now a days is real capable and at good competitive prices. Good luck!
---
My friend messaged me earlier about how a guild from one of the private servers is attempting to set up camp in Grobbulus because they believe that the average player on an RPPvP server is going to be much lower quality, which will allow them to "control" major resources such as world bosses and world PvP areas like the Arena. They also Apparently believe that the players on Grobbulus are going to be behind the curve with raid progression, which is how they plan on controlling such things.
---
I think you guys are even slightly less viable than bear tanks (which are totally viable) but good luck with that constant uphill battle for acceptance.
---
What do you mean with where I start? I understand that 1 race can be the best for multiple classes, but I don't want to play a rogue, warrior, and priest as only a human because it's the best race for these classes. I don't want duplicates. It's just a personal preference to keep the game interesting with diversity.  
---
So like think of it as a game. you have 8 racial cards and 9 class cards. you can only pair them once with each other, so with that rule in mind, I'm looking for opinions on how to best match each race/class that utilizes the racial traits.  
---
for example, when I look at the gnome racial traits, I match them with a warlock or mage class because of the **expansive mind**. Then I look at the other trait **escape artist..** this skill will help both classes, but which will it benefit more, a mage or a warlock? I don't know if a warlock has a teleport, so escape artist would probably benefit the warlock more, no?
---
Sticky for this? what do you mean
---
Lol that's not how the system handles reports at all. But keep telling yourself that if it makes your neck beard grow nice and straight.

Building my latest rig Friday and slammed this weekend so I’m expecting to get started after around a week, week and a half. You do you, though! Enjoy the game, whatever that means to you.
---
That Jesus Christ comment at the end was NOT expected.
---
Hilarious.
---
Can someone explain this one for me?
---
I used to play as a lonely wolf, then I get into a dungeon with nice people, after that, they told me to join them, we have been raiding together since warth.
---
He’s just being a troll. Thanks for the share. I hadn’t seen the comic or that video before and both got me exhale slightly out of my nose.
---
I have a lvl 30-something druid who is in a guild with only a few other characters. All of those other characters are one guy, and that one guy was the guy from this starter pack. Most recently online 10 years ago. I can't assume membership of the guild to let it live on :(
---
Also BRD has always caused communication since we have to decide where to go, who to kill and so on.
---
What paragraph is that?
---
My green man eyes missed that and couldnt find it.
---
You mean like how it was in the original vanilla?  it was - i used it as did literally everyone else.  nice try!
---
I usually drink two cups of black coffee on the morning and about 3-4 litres of water a day. I got my liquids covered!
---
&gt; By the way, WoW was always full of assholes. Even vanilla.
---
But that's part of what made the game fun on PVP servers at least. ;)
---
wow! time well spent.
---
Oh no, I understand it fine. It's just completely retarded.
---
Cool, I'm checking out that sub. Beside that, people surely are making my mind at ease here, that does sound like a world for me, plus a not too demanding one for the people I'm dragging along. Thanks!

Hey I used to play bonechewer

Remember how annoying those gnimes were on brokeback mountain

"nochanges" went out the window when people started cheering for Blizzard breaking addons

Feel like its a PR response to a nonexistent problem. More likely netcode changes were made to reduce server load and persistent corpses were axed in the name of stability.

Wait what that was a thing?

Going for the RP, very much NOT PvP server. (Bloodsail  Buccaneers)
---
Probably a lot of chill RP people mixed in with a few cringe RP people.  Which a little cringe is easier to deal with than asshats. (Which I assume most asshats will be on PvP servers anyways)
---
And less meme names/ non-names to look at because RP rules.  Which I am okay with tbh. Even if they’re weird, I prefer to team up with people with things that could be a name. None of this “xX_Succ_My_@$$_Xx” stuff. 
---
Overall I’m expecting it to be a pretty chill time.
---
all nighters . . . You are gunna need a month of all-nighters to get to 60.
---
Yes, and how you match them depends on where you start. For instance, the orc is the best pvp race on the horde for warrior, rogue, warlock, shaman, hunter. As such, depending where you start — or which you choose to be the orc — you will end up with a different combination of classes. 
---
You’re thinking about this all wrong. If you want to play each race, do it up. But you’ll unavoidable play a race/class combo that isn’t best.
---
Ofc it’s low effort. Like every alliance propaganda on this sub :^)
---
i am super excited for an rp-pvp server. i love the feeling of being paranoid and spooked of alliance, and i'm not a particularly competitive person so i don't care much for getting the best gear or things like that so i will probably only get enough gear so i can do the next raid so i wouldn't really have a lot to do, and i love rp. so those combinations of things make an rp-pvp server the most appealing for me.
---
No "lazy" memes tho, we can't have that
---
Oof, well at least I'm on European servers then. That doesn't sound all too great.

My abandoned level 37 warrior from Vanilla feels personally attacked.

Started when they added Paladin belfs. Two of my friends from work got me playing then dissapeared so i played by myself for a couple years, never did a dungeon, rather clueless, but had alot of fun anyway. 
---
Wont be able to play for long stretches so probably wont be doing dungeons, wont wait for extended periods asking for a group. but i'll have fun anyway.
---
He's been crunching the numbers and keeping a close eye on Joana'sspeed running guide.
---
Add-ons existed in classic, as long as the add-on system is the same and it's not against this then imo it should just be left to community adoption.
---
Hakurai guide is pretty good and he also does dungeon quests which will be a lot faster if your group already has 3 players.
---
thats not nearly enough food
---
Unlike a lot of people, I believe you. I clicked my way to top damage in vanilla, no game before wow had forced me to learn how to properly use a keyboard. I even used the arrow keys instead of wasd because I felt like my fingers wouldn't know where wasd was surrounded by all the other keys. 
---
But even working with a handicap like clicking abilities, with enough practice you can get really good. Just always at a disadvantage against people who are just as good, but also keybind.
---
True, I would completely understand and be cool with that
---
You get far more threat from just using bloodrage, or battle shout. It's irrelevant.

---
Didnt seem to have these negative effects when ppl used the actual addon in actual vanilla.  The fact that you keep saying "like classic wow" proves my point - you either didnt know it existed and the majority of ppl used it, or you didnt even play during vanilla.
---
You don't spend time roleplaying on a RP server?

The game goes live at the same time everywhere, https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/ (its 00:00 CEST so should be around 5pm MONDAY for canada?)

So I'm taking the week off. Hopefully I can play, even with all the server congestion. I'm playing on Herod so the queue will be bad, I'm sure.
---
I'll be doing about 15 mins of cardio each day.
---
As far as food goes, I will be intermittent fasting. I'll only be eating one meal per day at around 11am. I will only be eating meat and vegetables during that meal. However, I will be cooking the vegetables with some butter (keto diet). Joana, the world record WoW speed leveler, said he only ate 1 meal/day while speed leveling. Food makes you tired, after all. Especially when running on less sleep.
---
I'll be getting up once per hour for about 5 mins. Need to keep the back and wrists stretched out and moving around.
---
Anyone got any other tips for me?
---
litterally drafted Hilton 20 minutes before this tweet came out. 
---
At least classic is soon...

God I wish I would die suddenly and instantly while playing video games

I dont need it to take care of my cat, though now im wondering if i should clean the litter box tonight since ill probably forget tomorrow.

Granted, it only takes a few minutes.  Can just do that while im sitting in queue....
---
Extra disrespect if you successfully 4 man a pull or three during their trip.
---
That one time the jumper cables work though....
---
Also a lot of it comes down to personal preference and what your focus will be. If you’re pvping as a priest, undead is best on horde. If you’re pveing, then troll is.
---
Important thing to remember is physic scream/deathcoil/fear, use it -all the time- and *then* blame the tank.
---
Glad for late fantasy draft date

This is really great art, great job! I'm using RainWallpaper instead of wallpaper engine though, is there any way I can download the mp4 of this to create a wallpaper? I can't figure out how to save this from the reddit link
---
I am. Intentionally though.
---
The only way I can play it without sacrificing my real life is to do so alone, when I just have free time and no energy to do something else.
---
I have friends IRL that are going full no-life mode on it, and I almost did it with them, but right off the bat it was nonstop discord chat, phone calls, texts, asking how often can I play, what our plans are, figuring out who's doing what profession, raid times, officer chats, guild rules, website postings and setup, etc etc...then realizing I won't have time to play anything else if i want to keep up with leveling and raid progression in the guild, ...on and on...
---
It is SO easy to let this game take over your life and become a priority when it should just be a pastime.
---
Right, I feel exactly the same! O my reading all these comments, I just can't wait! Have fun : )))
---
Fun question: what amount of gold today is comparable to what 1K was in Vanilla?
---
I kept it on my bars and used some in tight spots during leveling and rest for WPvP. It's ridiculously useful but I had to fight my RPG hoarder urges to actually use them.
---
Absolutely they will. Those people are already being paid a salary by Blizzard so they don’t see it as spending money, they see it as getting a result.
---
Fucked up on the tooltip. Guy in the video is using two hands.
---
As someone who clicked their way through vanilla because I stubbornly didn't want to go through the discomfort of learning new muscle memory, I'd highly recommend you take this opportunity to learn some rudimentary keybinds. They transform the game. Just do it while leveling with your most oft used spells and by the time you're 60 it's just second nature.

That has more to do with the pressurised environment and oxygen levels though.

Both of my dads are.

For the average player? No. 
---
For a min/max try-hard player? Kinda.
---
I never saw a shammy tank past level 40 in actual vanilla. In my limited experience in private servers they were more trouble than they’re worth. 
---
To me it seems like a pet project for people who want to prove they can do it rather than a truly viable option. 
---
So yeah, it can be done. But in my opinion it isn’t worth the effort and unless you’re doing a guild group or something similar you are wasting the time of your party members.
---
You are aware of that if you happen to reach the crit cap, that percentage won't be correct unless you have enough hit. If you have 40% crit, the true value would be 32~ the hit however would unlock that.
---
You are if the healer hasn't done anything yet, it will start them running towards you, which is good for positioning, it's not irrelevant, it's pretty dang nice.
---
zoomer take
---
I mean.... cool to bring back something like this, but we have resources now that are better in every single aspect.
---
This really dosent have a place accept to confuse people who actually want good information on their class.
---
But going ass to ass is okay.
---
12 hour shifts on the weekend lol
---
Or go Grob which is almost perfect 50/50 based off the polls.
---
Unless they changed it, I think the animation doesn't activate in Classic, you can still hear the thwack but not sure about other players.

Im gone a minimum of 10.5 hours per day, and i live in a cold climate.  Having a dog is kind of hard.

Though i miss having a dog, and my cat really could use a playmate.  Im considering putting in an insulated dog door, but then i have to have a kennel outside thats catproofed so he cant escape and kill all the birds he watches out the window all day.
---
Please make these flairs

Yep going in alone and hope to make friends like I did ba k in the day, by grouping and being friendly to folks.
---
Hey guys I was just browsing by new and wondering if someone just said [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker].
---
Im a healthy guy. I lift 3x a week do cardio on the other days of the week. I play rugby during the summer. I might eat a little too much but my heart rate and pressure are good. I've already meal prepped and i have bags of nuts/seeds/dried fruit to snack on. 
---
And yet, i will still be no lifing it to help my guild get a week 1 rag. I don't take care of myself to squeeze every last minute out of my life. I take care of myself so that sometimes I *can* do this sort of thing. I am super excited for the group leveling and pushing myself because it is not something that I normally do.
---
Also swap Shaman and Mage.  Mages are lawful due to the rigorous studies wizards traditionally go through in most fantasy, whereas Shaman is a class who is about communing and bargaining with the chaotic forces of the elements, and their abilities are chaotic in nature as well (randomness of windfury and elemental overload for example)
---
Playing Ret I would often offheal or offtank, thats why I loved 5mans.

Saving the group when all felt lost were my big moments and why I loved playing ret.

Nope, cold brewed coffee and five-flavor berry tea!

I reckon you would be a natural Hunter.

My thoughts exactly :D

For loganaram! And superbull!
---
Virtually every PvP server is going to have more Horde players than Alliance players.  
---
You've read wrong.  Virtually every server is going to be at minimum 55%/45% in Horde's favor, with many servers being closer to 60/40 or even 65/35.
---
My ADHD does that.  Even at work i have to get up at least every hour because i just get restless and cant sit still any longer....and thats even *on* meds.

I have one friend playing from BC/WotLK era, but their guild is a PST &amp; want an EST server. I may go off on my own. I'm pretty shy in game so making friends is difficult for me.  I always played with my sister, husband, &amp; BIL; none of which will be playing Classic.
---
Neither. 39 twink lock. Hands down best twink of any of the brackets.
---
The repercussions he's talking about isn't for the LFG dev, it's for all other addon creators.  They're worried that Blizzard may just choose a fast thing to break for them that leads to other not related addons to break.
---
The problem is we are on the 4th survey. The number of entries has gone down with each survey. Most people took the first survey and never didn’t look back
---
Lol whatever dude ur gonna play
---
Realistically it’s only a matter of time before you do return...
---
Hey, I’m Blaumeux gang and proud
---
They are not mutually exclusive.
---
That is a broken system that was never even used. It never had a negative impact on the game for those reasons. If it wasn't trash and people actually used it, then it would have damaged the game right from the start.
---
ally player triggr'd LOK'TAR OGAR BROTHERS!
---
I stopped playing 13 years ago. as in played 2 years prior
---
I'm more excited for twink versatiles.
---
I thought they took them down when hulu got em
---
I remember Maplestory used to have it in the chat window.  It was always a bit of a 'uh...woah...' when you saw it get to 6+ hours.
---
Also fun to sit in the marketplace and tab out overnight for several nights in a row to see how high you could get it :P
---
Don't say this should I be rolling night elf...
---
My post was about enchanting.
---
Some context: I think this was sometime in 2005 and I was 14. I had recently gained some gold and decided to spend it on "resto" gear and setup my bar so each rank was like that. Yes I did play like this though I stopped playing this character not too long after and switched a hunter with keybinds with my new zboard lol.
---
I mean i liked playing vanilla with a very very very similar addon.  #nochanges
---
No. He totally deserved it. He put porn on the screen. Accident or not, a 3 day ban is minimal for having porn on your stream.
---
Don't think I've ever had it resisted since I take survival talents. I almost never die in pve unless I'm trying something stupid.
---
The human is half way bisected so I'm just erring on the side of caution
---
likely gonna not be that big of an issue, hopefully there is some progression friendly guilds trying to counter their bullshit
---
So spill it. Why ain'tcha comin back?
---
Quick gold guide....9 minutes long, and doesn't have anything useful. 
---
Is it possible for people these days to just get to the point in YouTube videos?
---
Always played alliance, so gonna try horde
---
There will be apps where no talking is needed.
---
Imagine getting tilted and down voting over a comment on the internet
---
Raid mechanics in phase 1 can probably be explained in 1-2 sentences, I wouldn’t sweat it too much.  Check wowhead and YouTube
---
If people on the RP and RP-PvP realms do this over Discord while in party, I will quit my guild and reroll immediately. Sorry, old friends!
---
What you’re describing is hiring non-herbalists to patrol 4 zones specifically to find black lotus and protect them. Presumably both factions need people. 
---
Which means it’d be most efficient if these guards were herbalists themselves. Which means if they find black lotus they take it. Which means there isn’t a ‘muscle’ conspiracy anymore because they found it first. 
---
Unless you’re actually paying several nonherb players per zone per faction to guard black lotus there is nothing wrong here.
---
I can't stand "play the patch" mentality.
---
Any chance we can get a 2560x1440 side-by-side of both the alliance and horde as a wallpaper? I would be eternally grateful..
---
Alliance because I like the look of the races and the capital cities a lot more.
---
Beautiful!
---
You ever try crystal meth? It’s one hell of a game
---
I agree, I wish you the best!
---
Back when I did it you could have a full group of priests all healing etc as long as nobody except the quest starter moves.
---
Im thinking its more of a reaction to part of the communitys stupid reaction to the lfg addon. If the addon was named chat helper no one would have cared, but now the magic letters of L, F and G make it bad.
---
I most likely wont use it but if the lfg traffic is across all layers then the chat could get a little (lot) cluttered. Having something to filter that a bit could be nice.
---
I'm in camp until the 4th. You guys will be fine.
---
Just sharing a cool post from /wow. No need to hate friend, just thought it was cool and thought some people would appreciate it. My apologies if I offended you.
---
You haven't played wow very long because we have been using these sites since BC
---
Juicer
---
joanna's before he started charging for it. every other one after aug 21st.
---
Oh yea for sure, I know something will be second best, but I was just curious as to what others would pick if they had to choose between the two.  
---
I suppose the pvp or pve preference would simply be neutral. I'll probably be doing both so id prefer it to be balanced between the two.
---
When people start searching for groups by  LFHealer Stratlive; Strat UD LF3M etc etc.   
---
And totally breaks the point of the addons making you miss groups.
---
Lol. You sound like my entire guild.
---
paladins &gt; racials
---
I played at same time, I cannot wait to experience true vanilla for the first time
---
Well unfortunately if private servers are any indication, anybody confused about features that aren't in classic will just be told to go back to retail.
---
That might be it! I remember it was slow and weird, and that definitely fits the bill.
---
I didn't know that.
---
He said it in his post haha
---
There's a reason I'm getting ready to remake my kill on site list for Classic...
---
You didn't offend me, but it has nothing to do with classic wow.
---
I’ve got a couple more can’t figure out how to post multiple lol
---
Oh fuck ya! My weekend is Mon - Wednesday so that gives me another day! 
---
I do too; the original might be the greatest piece of music ever! :) thanks
---
I assumed it would be more. If it were 1/10th, that means there will be 2 million classic players. They latest rumors had BoA at 3.2 million subs and settled on 1.7.
---
Seems unlikely that classic would have anywhere near he numbers of retail. But I might be wrong.
---
# Someone please find me that Goldshire painting!!
---
Yea I agree with basically what you've said, we'd all be fucked if everyone was like that in real life. 
---
But a decent amount of people find it fun to annoy others, and I think a video game is a perfectly acceptable outlet for that. Learning how to patiently deal with griefers is a useful skill that is transferable to life. 
---
It is literally impossible to grief someone who has the correct attitude.
---
Me and two friends found it by accident when we were running from some horde gankers. I still remember hiding out in the tunnels, listening run around looking for us, eventually finding and chasing us into the instance.  
---
  Funny thing is, we were the right level to do it but two players short.  Ended up finding a couple other players who were also dealing with that gank squad in general chat and we gave it a shot, but failed pretty miserably cause we were all noobs.
---
As a warlock, I was pretty wanted in general.  
---
Curse utility, pet CC for humanoids, healthstones, soulstones, summons etc. You bring a LOT of delicious little goodies as a warlock.  
---
If you can get a hold of some decent +shadow damage or spellpower gear, you will do some pretty insane damage. Even without much gear you're a terrifying opponent thanks to the tools you possess and the regen/sustain you have with healthstones, drain life and the like.
---
Yeah I understanding needing to have a gear reset at some point, but having one every patch is just too much
---
Nice! I do plan to RP, but it@'s good to know it's not a necessity and you're not being shunned for not doing it all the time.
---
Why are rogues chaotic evil. Steal a little murder a little, but no plans to summon arcdemons to burn the world....Neutral evil at best :)
---
I feel a little guilty since I've been useless at work lately but I just cannot stop the hype... I always dreamed of getting a chance to start all over again, and even if it's not exactly as it was on original launch, it'll still be special in its own way.  Can't wait.
---
4 strength, 4 stam leather belt?...
---
Touching your toes while pissing could have interesting results
---
/s
---
Lmao what's up with that edit.
---
there is still time to buy celery and carrots. The sugar will make you sleepy.
---
It's like choice as, or sweet as, but for things that a simple instead of sweet or choice.
---
LOKTAR OGAR, BITCH
---
Haha this is awesome. I always play a Dwarf Paladin, and I'm practically hunting folks at times to get a buff on them
---
So this is how copyright works. Not only do you have a ton of fair use rights - the company or individual who owns it gets to choose when they want to defend their rights. So until blizzard has a problem, it's fine.
---
And again, what others will pick will come down to where they start. If I’m a warrior main on the horde, imma pick an orc. If I’m a warlock main, imma pick an orc. And if I can only use orc once, then I’ll have a different list than you if we have different mains. 
---
Just pick what you want.
---
Big brain plays tbh
---
Not going to have much of a choice with tolerances for failure. Nobody's going to want to hearth back to a city to recruit a replacement and either walk back or hope your group has a lock.
---
I also like the 30-39 bracket, for spell casters especially. Just enough spell power gear to make you completely and utterly obnoxious, rofl.
---
It's almost like the horde are loud and savage characters by nature or something haha crazy
---
They camp lowlevels a lot
---
I will be posting tomorrow morning
---
I used threatmeter when I had to but I didn't raid often. Apart from that it was literally just trinketmenu
---
To make money off them yes
---
Just wanted to say thank you I will be trying out the add on aswell.
---
Your kind of missing the point of the friendly guy meme.
---
It doesn’t really compensate for what the alternatives could be. Their damage really is not good while leveling, their CC will wipe you, and they don’t really buff anyone better than their alternatives
---
The BEST time!
---
Posting tomorrow
---
Okay, for blood knights, they control the light yes, but they are still considered paladins, so my point stands, and as for Scarlet Crusade , they wield the light because they BELIEVE what they do is just, thus for that reason they are chaotic good. Balnazzar doesn't matter because they arent willingly following him.
---
The addon would still detect those groups right? It's not just limited to keyword X or Y.
---
I will be posting tomorrow
---
Hit me in the feels. I remover standing in Ogrimmar and asking a noob question during patch 1.10. I got a response from a guy who said “come to UC and I can help”
---
I arrived to UC and found him. Was an orc warrior with the shield from AQ and the 1h weap from Ony. He gave me 150g and I nearly cried. I was about 7 months into the game and didn’t know my ass from a hole in the ground.  That 150g turned the game from when I had a chance to play to dedicating my next 10 years being that guy. 
---
Great post sir.
---
Guess we are ok not keeping things like they actually were in vanilla.  You're a piece of work!
---
this is gunna be me
---
Well said, that definitely sums up my feelings nicely.
---
I appreciate you. Should help limit the "Uh guys, I'm out of arrows" occasions.
---
just scanned through this thread and I'm curious: how could they possibly detect that you're automating AH using AHK? Not that I'd do such a thing. but like, i just can't imagine how they would know you're using AHK.
---
I’m an android and I am just as hyped _beep boop_
---
U will not have problems finding groups for dungeons nor raids, u have the summon ability so making groups for dungeons is very nice as a warlock, as long as you find 2 players which should be easy.
---
For pvp past 42 (where u get deathcoil) some matchups like rogues will be difficult, but playing on a pvp server you will learn alot on your road to 60 getting killed or killing players. Warlock feels extremely rewarding to play and you will scale very well as you progress your gear.
---
You’re absolutely right. It will not be the same as last time. The amount of information available, streamers, influencers, your age, precious game knowledge, your situation,.. it’s gonna be different.
---
Sounds like a lot of effort for an addon maker to create a system that uses every item in the game and every combination of items in the game and weighs them together to calculate your "ilvl" which would vary immensely depending on your race and class.
---
I only know of one blind WoW player. Everyone else can just inspect people to see what they have on.
---
Ice Block lol, but yeah Death Coil is kind of it's own thing as far as CC goes.
---
Brush AND floss
---
God damnit.
---
Ouch
---
A lot of real angry ignorant people in this thread. Sorry dude.
---
You shit on people 1v1. Then you get death coil and you shit on people harder. Warlock is the last class I want to try and gank.
---
i dont really care, i doubt i will stick around much after i get to 60 as i remember raiding was super boring but i look forward to the leveling and pvp
---
That might still leave the main functionality up meaning chat reading and posting? So no, wont break it and stays usable.
---
wouldnt surprise me, dude was always talking about games in his interviews lol
---
first time i heard about settlers of catan was in an interview he did.
---
Idk, I had the buff on a toon I logged into in Cata but by now that's forever ago. For all I know they completely removed it from whatever database they store character state info
---
No I meant after classic haha
---
It was a french EU server so maybe its different in the US. Pretty much every competitive raiding guild had no RP whatsoever. We had a bunch of well known players who were doing animations. I had a blast honestly. And not much young players was a plus too.
---
How's the dwarf rogues failed cheap shot, into back stab and vanish lmao
---
im pretty sure ill be spammed with friend requests when they see me tank or heal
---
Micro center lmao
---
I hope this was taking after spending that gained gold
---
Peak allianceposting
---
Pretty good, especially when you consider most people won't have a pvp trinket to get out of fear. With VW sacrifices and curses you do a lot of damage while people struggle to do damage to you.
---
 Because Redditors are avoiding Faerlina because it’s the “streamer” server.
---
Not picking a fight per say but the language leans more towards combative than concerned. Glad they’re reaching out though.
---
Do you think it would piss them off if you /pet the nice tauren to show them that they're a good boy
---
Agreed, I don't trust Blizzard to pull it off.
---
I'd check it out, but personally I would rather move onto TBC, maybe even Wrath and then repeat this little trilogy all over again.
---
So I looked up my stress test data. Looks like around 15MB an hour.
---
Except they see anyone who isn't agreeing with them as corrupted and undead. Hence why they kill on sight except for recruiters. That isn't chaotic good.
---
Neither is kidnapping a light god and sucking their power away to use it for your own needs. 
---
Neither of these are good, they don't help anyone but themselves. They're not doing it for the common man, but for selfishness.
---
Its almost entirely in the spirit of good fun, you see the same shit from spanish people on the discord.
---
Basically no one is actually hating each other, its just ridiculous banter.
---
PS: flag es point right door
---
I am glad we moved away from ventrilo and skype. Raid call was pretty awesome though.
---
If its green its good!!
---
Alliance. I've been horde for most of my wow days, vanilla to Wrath and then on a private server. Played alliance initially and do have good memories. Basically going with them now for two reasons. My wife and friends are going Alliance, and I want this experience to feel as fresh as possible. There's still this stirring in my soul every time I see people proud of the Horde, but I have to at least give this Alliance thing a shot.
---
Almost the identical story as the original fella, I never once rp'ed but I really enjoyed the laid back atmosphere, high majority of chill folks.
---
I've got one IRL dude I know from school and work to roll with but he's got schooling and work and those things people call girlfriends so I don't imagine my one battle buddy will be around too long unfortunately. 
---
Anyway he's rolling wherever I decide but otherwise I'm totally alone. My Guild scattered back in MoP and I haven't been in one since, really.
---
Going to go it alone on a new Class and see where the wind blows. And try to make a lot of gold in the time I won't be raiding.
---
it's possible to be friendly and selfless yet still not go broke and do reasonable things.
---
there are buffs etc that essentially cost nothing. but bags, esp on a fresh server, will be too dif to get the mats for etc so it'll cost you too much $
---
As a colts fan and a Hoosier it's sad to see him go. But let's hope he joins the alliance.
---
...and your liver with all that soda. Hope you like injecting insulin.
---
Wasn’t it though?
---
Yeah they are in for a rude awakening. Plenty of try hards and vets are rolling in Grobb.
---
That's the reply of someone who can't actually source the bullshit they're spewing.
---
This. Getting nightfall proc for a 1,7k shadowbolt with prebis gear is one of the most satisfying things ever. Haven’t had a BiS geared warlock yet so I can only imagine what that’s gonna feel like.
---
It's impossible to know. For all Blizzard knows, there are a million people waiting till 5 minutes before launch to sub.
---
From the Blizzard AMA:  
---
&gt;Q: Will the Skeletons that appear when someone dies be the same as it was originally? Right now they disappear after you die again, they used to stay longer than that.  
---
&gt;A: While we understand that this was a flavorful part of Original WoW and the earlier expansions, individual players leaving multiple player corpses and skeletons throughout the game world can lead to behavior such as spelling out advertisements, hate speech, and other negative messages. As such, this will not be a part of WoW Classic.  
---
It's pretty clear, only one skeleton per character.
---
I took him like 2 hours earlier in my fantasy draft. FML.
---
Well it's a movie about a story before the time (in lore) classic was released. So it's doesn't have to do with the game play of wow classic. No. It tells a story of how we got to the point we are in the history of wow when we start playing at level 1. Check it out, it's pretty cool.
---
Don't forget demon hunter.
---
Are saying the cancer memers will go to Bigglesworth or they will stay on Whitemane?
---
Fairbanks is now listed as full as well. I just don't want queues :(
---
My cat actually waits sit in my door if im doing a dungeon or something. My smaller cat jumps on me.
---
See you in queue, good luck Luck.
---
/reincarnate
---
What pisses me off (and probably a lot of others too) is that when I get home at 5-6pm I only have a limited time to play. I don't have all fucking night to sit in queue. There was a reason why I rolled Fairbanks and stayed away from the other servers and I still got fucked. Me and buds are pretty fumed.
---
Female NE has the best animations in the game, minus their offensive cast (wtf is that weird yoga pose lmao). Other than that I agree.
---
I'm beyond excited!
---
&gt;Skeram or Incendius if you wanna avoid the huge mess
---
it will hit full but probably back off to high sooner than later
---
That's not how IP rights work mate. Fair use is a thing. Also where is the profit in this?
---
What's the G stand for?
---
I'm just planning on pressing that button as fast as possible.
---
Oh, should've clarified. It's all mixed together.
---
60g of oatmeal, 250ml milk, 30g of nuts, an apple, a carrot, maybe some proteinpowder, some berries. 800kcal in oatmeal would be what? 250g of them? That would be hard to swallow. :D
---
There was that one time when I roleplayed my Dwarf as racist vs these fucking night elves. I was the GM of a guild named "Darnassus must burn" and I got a one week band because someone got butthurt I guess
---
Look guys! WoW players are nice! See?
---
Kek no grammar mon.
---
sure
---
Nah, exp in bg's and forcing those that capped their exp into their own bg killed twinking. 
---
Before that, hierlooms actually made it easier to twink.
---
One of those people right here
---
Will be subbing tomorrow so I dont have to fafd with character creation on monday
---
D-day
---
Lok’tar Ogar brother!
---
I respect that you have your way of looking at it. But for some, some things are better left the way they were and dont need to be done again. But that doesn't mean the people who choose to leave the past in the past can't be happy for those who want to go back.  Like I said, I'm really excited for everyone, we don't need to turn it into something it isn't.
---
You can't tell me what to do! You're not my real dad!
---
No way.  That style of camera is why I couldn't play the Batman arkham games.
---
never played alliance..... and I never will 
---
horde all the way
---
I am, though I'm not sure what class I'll twink.
---
Horde but only because we voted and majority chose horde.
---
Personally I don't really care, I like both factions albeit for different reasons and have played both since TBC.
---
Someone who hates roleplayers?
---
Blizzard posted that the queue times on Herod would be several hours.
---
I question whether you've ever played a mage.....
---
You're a god damn heathen!
---
I just lol'd so hard at that response. Thank you.
---
Are addons available/enabled in wow classic? Do you still download from curse client? Havent played for a few years ..
---
&gt;  join an LFR group
---
Stopped reading right there.
---
Can learn gathering professions at level 1.
---
Wait... school? You know it was not a school that burned right?
---
I believe Blizzard's official word on servers like Herod/Whitemane/Faerlina were: 
---
"You should expect extremely long queue times that could take several hours to get through"
---
Not sure what the official word is on the EU realms like Shazzrah and the like, I'd assume a similar situation.
---
Axe weapon skill ? there's barely any epic 1H axes in vanilla,  10 at most :
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/one-handed-axes#items:0-2-3+18](https://classic.wowhead.com/one-handed-axes#items:0-2-3+18) .
---
Prot warriors rarely use 1H axes which makes that racial much less useful for prot.
---
Tauren's 5% hp increase isn't that big of a deal tbh, in phase 1 prot warrior should be around 6k hp, giving him an extra 300hp, either way it doesn't matter much, raid wipes dont happen due to main tank dying unless all your healers are sleeping, most wipes happen due to dps failing mechanics or healers going oom , either way 300 hp wouldn't change the outcome of said wipe.
---
The troll regen is minor but it's constant, it's a slight edge in threat and threat is the true endgame for a prot warrior. Any real hardcore tank knows what I'm talking about. It's all about maximum TPS.
---
So I suggest you stop all that garbage coming out of mouth and get educated a bit before you start insulting people out of ignorance.
---
Wow master race
---
L M F A O! ! 
---
The part with the dog just killed me.
---
I use the Tartarus. Love it. With my left hand fingers I have 24 keybinds for spells that I can hit seemlessly without looking at my hand. My left thumb on the thumb stick is for forward, backward, strafe and jump. And because my thumb is for moving my fingers are free to hit spells while moving. Also have keys for Alt, Shift, Tab, Esc.
---
Game is super comfortable to play this way, I'm surprised it hasn't caught on more.
---
Just download the language pack. For example I'm on EU servers my wife has played on English servers but with the Portuguese language pack installed to enjoy the story.
---
Why are dwarves so badass? Look at those fuckers. Their arms are huge. Hordies don't stand a chance.
---
Damn, is it still BoP in Classic? I know for a while it was not and you could simply make an alt, complete the quest, then send to your main. Was really hoping to exploit the shit out of this one.
---
I plan to drink plenty of water and go for plenty of walks.
---
Rule 2 says be civil and respectful. Is it really that hard?
---
Yes and No. Stamina is really the only stat you are looking for, thus blues are sufficient until honor gear and the Arathi rep set.
---
Don't argue with this guy, he's obviously bad. Any tank using blood rage when tanking should be gkicked.
---
low effort like their pvp efforts
---
the fire from Notre Dame burning is what is being used to freebase the "heroin." Makes sense to me
---
See you in 3 weeks.....
---
Bro. That feels so real.
---
Well tennis go back and pay attention. The first rule of IP is defend it or lose it. 
---
That how macdonnadls lost the rights to the term big mac.
---
Secondly fair use does not apply to trademarked logos you are selling. 
---
I can just make a loaf of star wars pictures with their logos and IP all over it and sell it.
---
Fuck me mate I hope you didnt pay much for your law degree and with tour knowledge indont you even managed to pass the test to practice law.
---
I dont think the reason people hate Hitler is because of how many people he killed but rather why, also the fact that WW2 veterans and holocaust survivors are still alive does play a part too.
---
And i dont agre to see this just as a harmless pun, lots of people will disagree with you about Hitler being a bad person and i would really like to stay away from Nazis, even if it's just a videogame.
---
I believe SL lock and elemental shaman should be in the top tier. 
---
Also you forgot to specify world PvP or bgs, there would be slight differences.
---
Then why bother replying when the guy was asking about racials for a Warlock.
---
If new pve content is ever designed will be forced to design around dbm, that shit is unhealthy if people want a future that isn't just porting existing xpacs to wow.
---
I mean they haven’t done anything yet, they stated it wouldn’t be “broken” on launch but patched in a week or so. Barely 24 hours passed between the announcement and tweeting its a bit unfair to jump to assuming they had no plans of communicating with other devs.
---
Get a wand at level 5 from an enchanter/ah. Worth the 15 silver
---
You have essentially every spec in the same A tier.
---
Fucking dope. Is there a high ress for the pic alone I would like to share your work.
---
dogs good
---
neglect bad
---
upvotes to the left &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
---
&gt;Well it's a movie about a story before the time (in lore) classic was released.
---
It's a story about the Legion broken shore campaign.
---
Some of the Blizzard comments have made it sound like "FULL" servers are facing potentially hours long waits, but there is really no way to know.
---
Yooooooo do you do other stuff like this? Unreal 👌🏻
---
 Like this?
---
https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info25006-ClassicAuraDurations.html

Yeah but fires do nothing for classic wow. I just didnt think it was a good meme.

Whoops

And steal my axe.

How will WA ever recover
---
Well you're welcome to have your opinion =D
---
And remember: some of us in this sub need to know that we drink too much mountain dew  and smell bad and have acne /s
---
Carrot is a pretty interesting addition I should try
---
What are you talking about. This is basic organization. Prevalent in every MMO ever.
---
Anything from a nightmares asylum video
---
The function keys are good for spell keybinds as well. On most keyboards you can reach up from number row and hit them without looking, at least F1 to F5.
---
Yep, and the more the cat and mouse game escalates the more collateral damage there is to all the other addons.
---
What they should have done is come to an agreement with the addon dev community, including the ClassicLFG dev if possible, as to what parts of the API should be changed to align with Blizzard's goals.
---
Instead, they made this blue post basically as a PR announcement and then they're going to change whatever they feel like is right without having a discussion with the developers as to what specifically violates their addon "guidelines". Once those changes are made, the developers now have to guess what Blizzard's intent was, most likely coming to the conclusion that whatever functionality wasn't touched is completely fine. Then development on the addon continues, trying to "improve" it within those guidelines that blizzard has seemingly set, but really its all based on guesswork and Blizzard could put their foot down at anytime.
---
That's the essence of the cat and mouse game he's talking about, and why having an in-depth discussion on the topic, and not just one vague post about "violating the spirit of the game", is necessary.
---
The Horde just seem more colorful and interesting to me.

Until Enhancement feels the stars align, the sun burst a solar flare directly onto them with heaven's divine blessing, Thrall's sexy, sultry, voice gently caress their eardrums, and triple windfury crit you in the face.
---
Also on a more serious note, you seem to have forgotten that Resto Shamans exist, I'm curious where you would put them.
---
Thanks UnderSkore! I started halfway through Vanilla, but I didn't get super into raiding until TBC. While I'm excited for Classic, I imagine I'd feel the exact same way as you do if they decide to reboot TBC or WotLK.
---
Very good, since you get most of your strong abilities early on. With dots + pet + fear spam you should be able to win most fights, since they wont be able to get out of fear early on. Unless you play ally, but no serious pvper will go ally lock.
---
The real strat is to go skinning and vendor everything.
---
Yeah the text just doesnt apply to the game at all. I dont think many will laugh at it

Not only FPS but here in Australia we had to deal with 250ms+ pings.. mine used to sit around 370ms from here in western australia

That's not how fair use works you can use other peoples IP in paid work without permission.
---
Thank you for sharing
---
Ventrilo is a figment of our collective imagination.
---
He didn’t forget. Deep resto would basically be D tier.
---
Windfury was nerfed because it was hilariously OP.  Even post-nerf, it's still the best buff that any healer can give a melee party member.
---
Banning/Breaking addons is nothing new for Blizzard. (decursive, world quest one, the one we got to draw on our screens with  etc...).  I can appreciate Weak Auras trying to get some attention with the recent announcement of an addon getting broken but again this has been going on longer than weakauras have been around.
---
Was really asking about it via end game.
---
I was a Dwarf warr on one of the private servers who levelled my Enchanting from 50 to 225 standing in SW giving out free enchants but instead of :-) it was always :\^)
---
Fuck off. A great player and a great guy off the field forced to retire because of injuries shouldn’t make you happy whether he plays for a rival or not
---
And then your quarterback retires during the third preseason game.
---
I hear they make that stuff out of Gnomes.
---
I considered it, but I still think those 2 specs don’t have quite as much value as Frost mage for caster. I also didn’t want to put them in a separate tier and put the rest of A tier in B tier, as rogue/priest in B tier feels... weird.

The reservation is for names, like if you wanted to make a character name Taquinto, you should reserve it now before some other Taquinto snatch it up.
---
I believe each server has a 10k max number of players, so if you're over that then you will have to wait in que to login. Or you could switch to a server that's less full.

This will sound weird, but my true efficiency/min-max gaming started when I played old school runscape again. The whole community there is very efficiency oriented, and I enjoy it. It comes naturally in that game as there are very clear "best" or most efficient options.
---

---
Yes... a honorable death
---
I was luckier with a similar situation. My dad got into WoW thanks to this episode, he let me play it and it actually *helped* me in school. I was young enough that reading fantasy quest text and seeing all those numbers really helped me out with reading and math
---
i'd suggest a few hours before launch for sure. some people have issues where the game client thinks you dont have a sub. Best to sub 12h before so all that goes through and you beat the last minute people thinking there'll be no problems at all.
---
I remember you.  Lady, Whitehand, Proudmore
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Yep. If you, like me, want BC, the best thing we can do is throw ourselves into classic and delete our retail characters. Engagement = better risk analysis on blizzards end for continuing this experiment.
---
This is not bannable and will never be fucking idiot. There are no rules which oblige players that they must attack anyone or not. You and your DOGSHIT noob 2h/day online guilds should be preparing your asses, cuz you will be paying us an very generous extra and will be paying hard.
---
open the map where you live and look at city names as character names!
---
They posted something they were excited about and instead of commenting on that you decided to bring them down by nitpicking the comment. That's pretty disrespectful imo.
---
I mean... sure, the stars align and you get a triple windfury crit, it does like... 40% of a warriors hp. He gets healed and proceeds to mortal strike, whirlwind, and then execute you.
---
I read this as “that one guy in your guild”, cuz I’m drunk af rn, and I instantly thought of thos creepy guys that try to hardcore befriend and stalk the one girl in the guild that gave them any sort of attention.
---
Thank you for clearing that up! The debuff slot bit I'm all too familiar with since i did quite a lot of the raid content as a lock back in vanilla, and it's kind of sad that all arms warriors have to skip out on one of their biggest assets. As you put it arms seems so much more fun then fury. I think I'll go with my gut and find a decent (ie not 31/5/15) arms specc and have a blast! Thanks for all the help bud!

I actually loved this. Been going through a depressive episode and it is super hard to motivate myself to work out. It's even harder to not eat crappy foods for comfort.
---
I've never played Classic before and I'm really looking forward to trying it out. :)
---
Look at damage meters for example. It scans your combat log and displays it in a graphic user interface (gui) format. The lfg addon does the same but it reads the chat instead. What's the issue buddy? This is how it works, I'm not gonna go through the tiny details for you to understand.

The last 2 expansion releases have been damn near perfect.

You’re correct, resto isn’t really a PvP spec. Anyone series about PvP goes deep elemental and 20 or 21 points in resto.

---
I remember there was an awesome warlock pvp video I saw that inspired me to roll warlock back in vanilla. I can't remember anything about it except for it was an undead lock that edited together a bunch of clips of world pvp and battlegrounds. I remember there was a part where he was in AB and he edited in System of a Down over that portion of the clip. Anyone ever see this one?
---
This actually made me laugh out loud. I love it
---
Youre absolutley right! But on epvp you can get the normal versions and it will update ASAP before launch (as zygor releases 2h before). No Problem!
---
Sticking with Horde, like I have since the beginning. 
---
The Horde has always been more open minded and pragmatic (Neutral/ Chaotic Good) as opposed to the often more strict and moralistic (Lawful Good) Alliance. 
---
Horde also has Orcs, which are my favorite fantasy race. (Even if I am sad they can’t be Mages at this point)
---
The Alliance has gnomes...which I have always been annoyed by. Their hair styles and voices are just ick. 
---
Actually in terms of just races, the Horde at this point only has one  I don’t care for: the Forsaken. And conversely, the Alliance only has one race I DO enjoy: the Night Elves. 
---
Additionally, most the Horde have cool Shamanic/Pagan customs and themes, compared to the far more boring Pseudo-Christian Light stuff the Alliance has. (With the exception of the Night Elves basically being fantasy Strega). 
---
This even carries over to their (at the time) unique classes of Shaman and Paladin. The former of which I’ve always thought was way cooler.  (Even if I never really got far with one, because I was too busy with my Mages and Warlocks)
---
The Alliance with their Kings and Nobles and Priests also tends to feel (and be) quite haughty at times, where as the Horde feels far more genuine. 
---
So yeah, kinda of a lot of reasons I prefer Horde. :P
---
yep!
---
It’s not like he died lol, the jags fan needs all the help he can get. Let him be happy.

I kept the crib next to my desk, rocked her, fed her, and held her in between xp grinding. It's a good memory for me. They can't do much at that age.

You cant until 8.2.5 at least! LIVE TO WIN!!!
---
When they added zone scaling in 7.3.5 someone leveled to 60 purely with boars while listening to that song. They'll be glad to know that instead of using Westfall now Elwynn scales 1-60 in 8.2.5! Too bad we'll all be on Classic by then

Oh god, I remember that song. Tanuk Tanuk Tan was a staple of the Vanilla experience. love it.

I just might make the jump :)
---
I feel like rather than posts glorifying these things it's just people who played wow when they were young/teenagers and these kinds of foods/drinks were staples to them back then. 
---
As odd as it may seem, there is nostalgia within routines like this.
---
 The shitty/easy/quick foods and drinks have always been memed along side gaming.

For me personally, if I don't have at least one 2L coca cola in my fridge it won't feel real :P

Where'd you get the little bottles?
---
They have no problem at all in 5 mans
---
For raids they are second tier out of two as far as horde is concerned but in a pinch a pug will take them.
---
A guild that understands they have a good druid tank will put him to great use though, they actually can generate great threat and can go at a good pace.
---
When I figured out how to move/turn mainly with a mouse. I had it down pat by the time wow was released. Those vanilla keyboard turning players didn't know what hit them.
---
You wont be alone for long.  Classic builds great relationships.
---
If you're prepared to work hard, you can do well as a hunter. This means learning shot and melee weaving, overturning the innate disdain a lot of people have towards your class, and just overcoming stuff.
---
If you want to just plug play and chill, you may have an okay time early, but it gets punishing real fast.
---
Sorry dude, I don't think anyone around here actually grew up since 2004.
---
Thank you.
---
Long live the banshee queen! (Kinda lol)
---
The answer is still yes. People saying no just simply have no idea what they’re talking about. Druid tanks and druids in generally absolutely blew hot loads for most of classic. This gave them an awful rep. Sometime between patch like 1.10 -1..12 (i forget which) blizzard revamped everyone’s talent trees with druids receiving one of the heaviest of revamps. It even made resto a lot better. But it made feral actually viable. 
---
Their dps in cat form was still nothing to write home about. But they could finally hold threat, remained tanky as fuck, and since innvervate became baseline they offered very solid utility. Finally you could have an offtank that could be a great tank when needed and be a solid utility / added damage when they weren’t needed. Many progressive guilds caught onto this and started holding atleast one feral Druid on their roster. They were annoying as fuck to gear though. 
---
People saying they aren’t viable in raids either never touched vanilla and are parroting bullshit, or are random crud who’s guild struggled through bwl even though everyone was tryharding. But many people did catch on that feral druids where useful. My guilds second tank was a bear and he was great. Many other guilds on my server also caught on. By the end when people just said fuck it and were waiting for tbc a lot of raids had adjusted to have 1 feral and 2 resto. 
---
They are by no means a requirement. But they’re perfectly viable and very useful.
---
Yerrr undead mage too, lets grind some quests on launch brotha

I am going in alone. But I have joined a guild that seems to fit my schedule and my mentality.

I do not think that these two things contradict each other.
---
Fair enough
---
For the alliance! Death to the Horde!
---
I’m so glad I don’t have kids to watch die during this trying time
---
There will be very little veterans compared to others. Just on this sub the amount of people who say they played vanilla should be reduced by half because it's clear they never actualy did.
---
There will be lots of assholes tho. With the return of the need and greed button we will already have people take items they don't need or want just to fuck somebody and people will scam others with a lot of things.
---
Many will take advantage of new people.
---
Great work OP, how long did it take you to do these? There’s a tremendous amount of detail here.
---
The fact that there will even be queue times is annoying enough. Blue Blizz post said that we should expect a queue time for even a medium population server. So we'll see.
---
I like to give away a lot bags in Goldshire as im working on tailoring. Honestly I would much prefer a bag early game to enchants.

Not guildies really, but close friends that I gamed with everyday for a solid 8 years. Met them back in BC I believe, or end of vanilla. Hard to remember

I like the places you added, definitely noteworthy places. How about activate the portal north of EPL to reach blood elves?

"I must be best-in-slot" is a shit mindset to have in Classic.
---
Is naxx gear not better than the pvp gear for pvp? Isnt that the case for warlocks ?
---
i looked at the url and thought 'there's probably something wrong about it' and it looks like i was right.

thanks for being that person :D
---
I'm already hyped, don't promise me the sweet embrace of death as well. I can only get so hype.
---
First played with them in 2005 when I was 16, am 30 now. The entire guild of 50 people came back for Classic. It's amazing, quite honestly.
---
Providing you hit level 60 in phase 1, you won't even realize it until a few days/weeks into phase 2.
---
That's an edgy playlist. Did listen to the used back then?
---
Read the post you replied to again. They said Blizzard can't do it *without breaking other addons*. They didn't say Blizzard can't do it.
---
And shift out of root

Only to discover that Night Elf Female you were cybering in Goldshire was your husband all along.

Also classic community - giving yourself away that you never played vanilla when you don't realize they already had those addons and were heavily (almost exclusively) used by ACTUAL vanilla players!  REE!\~
---
No one knows anything about what is going to happen. People need to calm their tits.
---
Yea just look for patch 1.2 to 1.3 and that's the classic ones
---
There's also a tab for where the game is and make sure it's set to classic and when you're on the classic version if you go to recent add-ons they will pretty much all be for classic
---
Fook the lfg addon, and if you support it then fook you too!

Reminds me of a super old video where a guy mapped his mouse laser movement to his W key, then used an exercise bike to trigger the mouse laser, thereby tapping the W key in-game.

He used it to 'run' to Darnassus.

&gt; (and Freezing Trap) can only be removed by damage

Notably it can also be dispelled by Priests, Paladins and Felhunters (though the latter is a bit of a gamble if they have more than 1 debuff).

All this talk of snack foods and energy drinks for a video game marathon is just embarrassing... we're not 15 year old kids, grow the hell up and do cocaine like an adult.

Orc warlock that goes soul link is very strong.  The stun resist is way better than WOTF for a warlock in PvP.  I played vanilla as a human warlock and am going orc warlock for classic.
---
Don't play. Your social and professional life will thank you for it!

Whichever one feels like it would be the more monotonous of the two for leveling, level that one second so you can provide them with some gear or other leveling assistance
---
Its only 50 cents a day, so yeah, totally worth it.
---
Heal or dps.
---
Answer that and you answer your question.
---
They literally worked with Blizzard on this this episode so there's zero chance Blizzard didn't tell them. They clearly just wanted him to be human and have the archer/mage/warrior + Cartman as the Dwarf thing going on.
---

It actually helps things boil though... Since it is hotter, it makes it quicker to cook.
---
I have a standing desk.
---
You know this? You know what Blizz plans on changing and you know how it will affect other addons? Please enlighten all of us. That's some good info.
---
&gt;You can test this by standing on a chair or table or somehting when you set your HS.
---
That's a cool fact for RP reasons / cool factor. :)
---
God I haven't seen this in forever I feel like I saw it in the wow magazine or something thanks for the memories haha
---
what you mean, you run straight into them and growl "UARHGHHHHHHHH AAAHHHHH!!!!"
---
I'm a believer of a LOT. I strongly think over 50% of the population hasn't even subbed.
---
Glad I didn't draft him!
---
50k per full server.. how many servers in the world?  i think NA alone has near 10.
---
[this](https://www.pcgamer.com/wow-classic-servers/) looks like 29 servers and if they're all listed as full and 50k is a good estimate then it's 1,450,000. even if it's 30k per server it's 870k.
---
now i assume the website linked as the current count and i assume they're all full.
---
ITT a whole bunch of people who have no idea how addons work and what the implications of breaking this addon will be for other addons

Yes! They're great off-tanks, and can occasionally be main tanks! Just don't expect to ever wear any of the tier sets.

Ooh that sounds really cool

LOL I love how "Dog shit noob 2h/day" is a diss. Yes, those of us who have careers and families are dog shit noobs. Hey look everyone, I found the private server player who was about 3 when vanilla was released.

And sorry bud but colluding with opposing faction to influence economy is bannable. And it has happened over rare dragon spawns back in vanilla. Happened on Kel thuzad.

Got them at a little Korean grocery in my area. Unlabeled, they brew them daily. I assume you can get the bottles on Amazon though. I plan to reuse them cause they’re so dope looking.

On PvP servers, no, it's one or the other.

It wouldn't be too difficult to throw in some BiS items and assign a number value to them, but that number value is completely useless when the items in question are so well known.

*"gonna graduate High Scool this year and go on with my life and move out . . . . . . "*   
---
Famous last words
---
Correct.
---
More mana, damage, and therefore higher threat along with more sustain.
---
ah i misread \^\^ recycling is important &lt;3
---
Also stealth infiltration, sprint to escape indoor areas, self healing, tank forms, moonfire.
---
Your last showers then, eh?
---
You're projecting.
---
Pallys are not known for raw heals. All my knowledge is rumors mind you i didnt PLAY classic. Bit im told Pally is taken for Blessings and Healing Efficiency especially in Naxx gear hpally was super effecient on mana. im told it had to do with a talent where crit heals restored mana spent and in late game gear you stack spell crit, and in early game pally is still great for Buffs, and very important. Mages are Great dps but any raid will have a ton a mages and only a handful of Pallys which means, Less gear Competition, stack more crit!
---
Clearly id roll pally but im set on Lock already. Still! its up to you both classes are amazing in their own way
---
I just dusted off my 3-5yr old HP laptop with a AMD APU in it and 4 gigs of DDR3 for my GF to play with me.

Swapping an 8gb stick of ram ($25)

Luckily Classic/Wow will run on basically anything.

are you hard set on a laptop?
---
a desktop could be pretty good for 500, ideally 600 but 500 should be doable.

If it's a special character that makes sense for the name, I'd say it's fine.
---
If it's just to bypass getting a name that's taken, it's annoying.  It really doesn't matter in the end but I'd say it's a little inconsiderate to copy a taken name knowing it's also an inconvenience for others to invite you.
---
Big whoosh on my last point, guys, but thanks for the feedback otherwise.
---
Simple. Roll a NE female, find a thirsty Druid and proceed to RP as a girl irl. You’ll have them tamed in no time.
---
I resubbed two days ago. I've also been playing retail to help scratch my itch while I've been waiting. Its honestly not been helping, but I've been telling myself it is helping.
---
Who cares? Casuals crying about other players being better than them is why modern WoW is the way it is.
---
But I’ve already ordered that horde bumper sticker.
---
How about if we turn you into a cheeseburger?
---
Youth? mate I'm 28 Haha.
---
They really have.
---
I just got goosebumps again
---
HOLY GRAAIIIIIILLLLLLLLL!!!!
---
Good thing Garrosh turned that around amirite guys
---
Locks are one of the top classes. I’d do it if you’ve never played one, *really* fun. Also, you get the level 40 mount which is really nice
---
Tbh Imwould rather play with the crow. The other bird seems boring af.
---
See you ingame.
---
Like I said, you aren't the smartest ones. Do you think we are stupid enough to actually get banned if Blizz start to crack on us? Hehehe, dont lie to yourself, we will artificially create PvP between us and that... is basically it, with PvP between guilds and after that you literally can climb onto the wall, but you wan't have any proof to accuse us of anything &lt;3

I haven't played much alliance so I can't speak for the animation casts, mostly just the physical model.
---
Yeah, there's one for Patrick Mahomes too, although I think the joke fits Andrew Luck better.
---
Meanwhile as paladin.. DP the highest armour target surviving
---
The, "i miss you," really got me too.
---
One of my guild mates from vanilla died suddenly about 3 years ago. Heard about it on Facebook from her family. None of us were playing wow anymore, and we hadn't spoken directly in a couple years. I would tell people that one of the only reasons I still used Facebook was to read the stuff she'd post all the time. She was hilarious. Her death was kind of a surreal thing, because although we played wow together for many years, and chatted online a bit in general, we never met in person, and had our own separate lives. Online friendships can be different like that, I guess. But I still think about her often.
---
Anyway, here we are only hours from classic, and almost everyone has come back to play. Someone brought her up in discord last week, and it finally really hit me, and it hit me hard... Here everyone was, all ready to play together again, and she's never coming back. 
---
I miss her so much. I mean, we all miss her, but at least we're all missing her together now.
---
yes :D

People really out here taking pride in subscribing to a text file.

It doesn't break on damage. So if you want to DoT someone and force them to bleed out without retaliation, you can mind control them while the damage ticks.
---
It only breaks if it's broken by a trinket, WotF, dispelled, interrupted, or if you run the person out of your cast range.
---
It's often used to throw people off cliffs.

lmao

---
Enjoy your Kidney Stones lol.  Dont forget to hydrate with some water.
---
In my experience, most people are only actually actively RPing maybe 20% of the time. There's still a lot of busywork, management, trade, ect in the game that doesn't exactly lend itself to roleplaying. Nobody will care if you choose not to roleplay, as long as your not harassing the people who are.
---
And even the most hardcore always-in-character type of people will usually have a normal chat if you specifically whisper them OOC (Out Of Character). I actually think that RP servers aren't a bad place at all for your friends, because the general population is a lot more chill in my experience, than say, a really competitive PvP server.
---
My 10 year old laptop runs it so nicely it almost hurts my feelings lol. You'll be good!
---
I appreciate this meme. Thank you op, very cool.
---
Ass cam, where?
---
You can just draw a red line through it
---
Imma role a holy priest. I’ll make friends along the way lol
---
Can't he stream it elsewhere and just tell his fans to go there?
---
Going in alone, first time playing WoW at all, hoping to see what I missed out on and hopefully find some people to play with in game.
---
It took me about 30 hours
---
Subtlety jerk
---
I should have posted a photo of me standing next to it, I'm just 6 foot but the video doesn't really do that justice.
---
I remember Horde can get Slumber Sand from a early quest in Tirisfal Glades the Quest is called A new Plague, a small quest chain.
---
Puts the target to sleep for 20sec and you get 10 of them iirc.
---
I have no idea what ctraid does or how it works. But if its functionality is breaking nochanges then why are you defending it while potentially shitting on other addon?
---
If classiclfg had no auoinvite functionality then what would be so bad about it?
---
You post, you invite people, they join, you welcome each other. You gather, You go to dungeon entrance together, you go inside, you communicate regarding buffs etc, you talk shit during mana breaks etc. What would be so different? That you had to manually spam LFM? Is it that game breaking? This tool does jot work crossworld, these are still people from your server, names which you will see again and again. So that sense of accountability for being a dick remains
---
From what I understand on the original release raids ran like shit for most people(based on comments here and some blogs). Couple fps at most. Slideshow.
---
Now you won't experience that. It is much bigger change to game experience than the fact that you don't have to spam LFM.
---
I laugh out loud a few times a year. This one got me.
---
Wow that advertisement is epic
---
Well then, maybe instead of simply declaring your superiority of intellect, you could enlighten me.
---
he is locked in gilneas :P
---
Even better for ore when you have to mine the same node 3 times to get it all
---
I3 8000 series with integrated uhd 620 gets 60fps most of the time, you'll get dips when it's heavy. But for $500 laptops look on Slickdeals for 1050 or 1660 laptops and that will be more than enough.
---
What if their store or sub processing thing malfunctions on Monday and all you people 
---
" holding out" get fucked over
---
In the exact same boat, my friend.
---
I just got back from the water park today and did the same. Have fun!
---
on planet “we actually play the game” rogues are poor lvlers.
---
Or you can buy alliance vagina and horde dildo, and fuck that vagina by dildo...
---
We know what we are and we own it.
---
And then hopefully Mount &amp; Blade bannerlord soonish after!
---
This is the best answer. You *can* coordinate DoTs to ruin them, or you can make them do something stupid like move to the wrong place, but it’s only as clever as you are. 
---
Be clever, or don’t use it.
---
no :)
---
I used it to bait interrupts so I could heal up. Mind Control &gt; Wait for interrupt &gt; Heal, or Heal &gt; Get interrupted &gt;Mind Control with DoT on target.
---
I still can't believe it's really happening. We're going home, boys and girls!
---
Oh hey! You're back! Personally I find when I PvP a priest as a healer I take primarily discipline talents, so I find it interesting you decided to highlight holy priest.
---
Well then, maybe instead of simply declaring your inferior intellect, you should take an intro level economics class before calling something a 50IQ play.
---
Man, if someone made this in ultrawide 3440x1440 I would be all over it
---
whoooosh
---
They were busy working on Diablo Immortal man! They gotta make sure we have phones!
---
Parents wouldn't pay for the sub, so I played gw1 and don't regret it.
---
But I'm an "adult" now so I'll try classic and find out what I missed
---
What relevant data does undecided provide for the survey?
---
Keto flu is mostly from lack of proper hydration. Can easily minimize its effects by getting more magnesium, potassium, sodium, etc. in your system through veggies or supplements. 
---
Agree that it can be "bad" if you go from like ~200g carb a day to below ~25g a day but that's just a poor transition/prep into keto.
---
Good idea, would love to see this covering raid regents!
---
Not many. It almost has 13k downloads. That's compared to 100k plus for most other mods people know about. Some are even in the millions. The number of people using this addon is a pretty small percentage of players. It would be even less heard of without all the negative hype.
---
Alliance. I prefer the home cities especially Ironforge. 
---
Although the main reason is I'll e playing with some buddies and showing 1 guy the ropes that has never played.
---
Gotta love those oatmeal creampies
---
You plebeians! You absolute morons! The only pro-MLG xtreme way to play WoW is by using Microsoft's Virtual Keyboard with Virtual Assistance on.
---
Why do you have no rogues in S tier?
---
Judging by the comments here and the polls, that's about how many alliance there is gonna be total in classic lol
---
also moonglade is the one neutral area in the game
---
Don't do it this is a kidnapper tactic
---
Dont reveal everyones plan! :p
---
Let me in... let me IIINNNN
---
I would put ele sham at S tier and move hunter up a notch.
---
What you missed was what would usually be gathered by social context, that being the full intent of their expression would have been "*I felt* I had to share this machinima"
---
People often leave off such introductory aspects of sentences in casual usage, typically when it relates to expressing that what they say is merely their opinion. I hope this explanation helped somewhat
---
In the end the streamer is responsible for what they put on stream. Add your chat and a guy starts saying racist stuff, that's your problem now. Ask for user content and never expect someone might troll you? Show a discord chat and someone posts a dick pick?
---
C'mon, this is streaming 101. He dun fucked up and he'll never do user submitted shit again.

I get 5 chances for the fire procs, but that's still a lot.  It also seems like a fun spec which very few will be using.
---
Make sure you stay hydrated (with water). I know the bathroom breaks will be a small inconvenience, but the energy/focus you'll get from staying hydrated will be worth it. Plus, you won't be as hungry if you're drinking water.
---
err no
---
"How does it feeeeel"
---
Arcane resistance screams Karazhan. If we somehow got holy resistance Scarlet Crusade could be the opponent.
---
I started the same time and felt the same way about how people will get over it quick. I am not also unreasonably hyped for it. 
---
I blame BFA more than anything. It’s just not fun at all. So much boring time gated rep and world quests. It’s just dull all around. If they don’t fix retail next expansion, I won’t go back because I know I will be having more fun in classic.
---
Stun resist + free action potion when you don't resist the stun.

I haven't been this excited for a game release since No Man's Sky.
---
No it will found as my 1 per week.
---
No, he should not.
---
Upgrading to Win 10 64 bit will serve him better.
---
They simply are not S tier imo. For duelling? Probably. For world PvP, I would have only hunter in S tier and rogues in A tier. The most useful aspect of rogues in BGs is ninja capping both in AV and AB, but flag defending is better with other classes, and with any group PvP rogues just get too countered by warriors which are so abundant.

100% he’s on the RPPVP server a human paladin. Complimenting every horde player ganking him in STV.

Ahh ok I’ve seen that in manga now that I think about it. These are definitely going in my wallpaper rotation!
---
Take a downvote the alliance does not deserve 666 upvotes thata for thw horde.
---
Agreed.
---
Yep! :)
---
You're going to spend a bigger portion of your life leveling from 1-60 than you are fighting Rag. Play the class that you find more compelling to play. If you don't like auto-attacking, don't play pally. If you don't like casting then don't play mage.   
---
Also, Mage dps and pally heals are top tier endgame so don't worry you're fine either way.
---
I wonder if snowballs will have the knockbak
---
I agree but I think the best way people will be influenced to search is through guilds and their discord’s.
---
I coach 2 soccer teams.  We have practice Mondays.  5:30 and 6:30p.  Come on rain!  It’s looking like rain!!

meeting stones were added in 1.3

you couldn't queue from innkeepers until 1.5

Yep I started putting all my essential stuff in my very last bag.
---
It really does help avoid cluttering the bag, you can sort through the items you have looted and move the ones you want to keep up with the other important ones.
---
Kinda what the 'sort all bags' button does in retail, but manually
---
Paladins never get a taunt, and you drink more frequently than a priest, make sure you bring a mage to every dungeon you rank and you will do fine, spell cleave is actually a good idea, 2 mages and a Ret pally and a healer is very fast leveling.

If you’re west coast, I’m in a guild that has a solid amount of NFL fans. I actually found out about them on /r/LosAngelesRams

Yeah, at least I'm not trying my hardest to pose as an "old fucks" with responsibilites/family ofc no time and whatnot, so becuz of that everyone need to lick my butt - like most of you do, even tho I'm 26.
---
I could understand Elemental in S tier. Hunters are definitely a premiere spec early but I think that their poor scaling just drops them down for mid to late game. If I had separate lists for each raid tier, I would have hunters in S tier for tier 1.
---
Dont the colts have Dak Prescott?
---
As a swede and after reading the general consensus on reddit there isn't really much point to read deep into it. Just treat as a demographic survey to see where certain groups are going. Most people here seem to already expect scandinavians to handle themselves in english.
---
You could also say PvP warriors have 20 points in fury so therefore they're fury warriors. You could also say that Elemental Shamans usually take 20 points in Resto, so technically they're Resto shamans.
---
The majority of Preist PvP Healers will have primarily Discipline talents, because that's where the durability and utility is.
---
Bad list. Priest mana burns Paladins to make them useless. GG
---
Shamans are only Healers so mage
---
When there are a plenty of other options, this seems like a good idea to make consumers try your product.

Ive known this one guy for almost my whole life, i remember both of us being 8 or 9 on Wrath doing, i dont even know what it definitely wasnt pve or pvp stuff. But hell we did all the games together from old classic Toontown since that was the Hit for our 10 year old selves, all up to csgo stuff and 8.0 WoW, we still stay together. Hes a good man and a good friend, even if he doesnt know how to show it too much

Rogues have a 3 button rotation fury has a 3 button rotation, hunters mages and warlocks have 1 button rotations.
---
Hot pockets would have you using that bucket quite often.

---
Game doesn't develop community anymore
---
I still think you’re overlooking rogues. Their ability to manipulate a fight to their liking is stupid, especially with full trinkets and grenades. And not just in 1v1 situations.
---
I can link you some PvP videos if you’d like.

That paper doesn’t back up your comment or your advice, there are a lot of variables outlined there. 
---
It wasn’t a strawman, you internalized my general comment, which was a reply to _someone else_. You didn’t say you were a nutritionist and you didn’t talk about a diet or reading a book. You’re defensive and probably a bit self-conscious if you’re honest with yourself.
---
Are you an under achiever? Feel like you were maybe destined for something more but didn’t apply yourself when you were younger? I notice that you’re all to happy to throw out this vague, largely baseless advice out as if you’re looking for “attaboy’s”?
---
That’s an ad hominem. 
---
What’s the next one?
---
Think he means how you would have been like 8-10 years old then if you are mid twenties now. If so you were probably too young to fully appreciate the game enough to be the one telling the youngsters now how it was.
---
where you live could still be a few hours drive away.
---
I don't know why you're arguing semantics, it's pointless. The "arcane mage" example just proves that there is no definitive line. But since you insist, I'll change it to "healing priest".
---
Can't wait to see you in game man :P You'll drink the koolaid eventually....
---
and if you don't, watch some streams or something man. Your past experiences can still be remembered while creating new ones.
---
You'd be better off finding a 2-3 year old used one with decent specs than hard capping a price limit on a new one. There's a limit on what you can buy in stores for $500 but you might find a good deal on a decent one that someone has upgraded from.
---
I love this post, but the 1% number right in front seems a little superfluous to the rest of the sentiment, ey? ;)

Believe it or not, you can form memories, and communicate without spamming the channel. In fact, most of mine were formed within the group itself. Imagine that.

I really like the tiny bit of sun hitting the bear. It just brings back childhood memories of getting up at like 5 in the morning and going to run around in a dew filled field with the sun blasting through the trees.

I don't if I'm simply older, disillusioned or whatever but I can't remember the last time I saw those shadows and sun rays juxtapose each other so well.
---
This picture reminded me of that so thank you.
---
You know you can have some class and buy a toilet seat that fits on a bucket.
---
Atleast that's something to aim for. Let's say you get better holy gear first and gets into a raid. That might help, if you're lucky get you a shadow piece.

You, as spokesman os reddit pitchfork army, seems not really aware of what your army is against. Most of them are against anything that have LFG in the name, without even knowing what it does or is capable of.
---
Ok cool, we want to make it so I’ll take all the greys, give all greens to our d/e and blues accordingly. I can loot everything and the group can just keep chain pulling?
---
I would sometimes tank some things as ele even into bc. If the group understand that your not a conventional tank and knows to give you a few extra seconds before they start dps it can work but some pulls are going to be nightmarish. Small packs and single target are pretty easily doable. I love shaman and it has always been my main, and I'm planning to main mage in classic but I still have to fight the urge to roll shaman everyday
---
I'm a huge proponent of hourly sets of hindu squats and hindu pushups, grease that groove. For extra efficiency you can just do burpees, but a set of two exercises is vastly less boring to me for some reason.

You are a genius dude.... that explains everything

Rapeface seems accurate.  He looks like a psychotic rapist who's been locked up for 15 years and just spotted his dream victim.

Good luck on keeping that name past opening day!

They're great for 5 mans, but terrible for end game PvE. As u/bakagir said, they don't have taunt in classic.

---
Hunters don't drop off in PvP the same way they do in PvE. They have such strong utility in group PvP, battlegrounds especially, that they are easily above Shadow Priests and Hemo Rogues.
---
Viper Sting. Frost Trap. Freezing Trap. Flares. Constant pressure on casters from pets. Huge ranged burst damage. Bonus points if they have Entrapment.
---
Put a Hunter in a team to support and be supported and they're fantastic in 10/15/40 man PvP.
---
Our other plan was ML where I take the greys, give greens to our d/e and blues accordingly. And we just split the greys vendor value later. FFA might be easier
---
It’s tough unless you have really great support.
---
&gt; That was the real power of this addon, and that is what they will curbstomp.
---
And how many addons that rely on that functionality will be broken in the process? That's the real issue here. The LFG addon will easily be able to move it's messages to the public channels (and spam them up, making them harder to read for everyone)
---
If you are selfish person, go rogue. If you wanna actually be useful for People, go priest.
---
yeah then you should go with ML.
---
Thanks for spreading the message of being a friendly guy :)
---
Tanking as a paladin will be completely viable up until it’s time to raid, then a spelladin or a meme spec ret with full judgement and hand of rag will be your wet dream, but as for tanking, that will be a lost cause. You’ll get railroaded into slapping on the cloth robes for the dank mp5 and being the less efficient priests paladins were destined to be in a classic raid setting.
---
I main rogue. I played rogue for 4 years on private servers, to high PvP ranks. Their usefulness is throttled by warriors which are by FAR the most popular class. With 0 warriors I would have rogues higher.
---
He already has enough to live his life if he invest it. He could easily stream classic on twitch and make money.
---
Now that's some next level, modern thinking right there! Or just take it even further, take the wheels off the PC chair, cut a hole in it, and mount it on the bucket! All of the convenience, with no negatives.
---
What would an invite macro look like in Classic?

As in, inviting a targeted player, rather than clicking on their portrait

it's been posted. it's streamer drama. no need to be here.
---
Yes. Main tank 5s and off tank 40 mans.   
---
CHeck out Skarm on youtube. He has a really good deep-dive into tanking as a druid.
---
A huge problem with elemental shamans it's how hard warlocks shut them down. Not by killing them. One curse of tongues removes 75% if their effectiveness for 30 seconds.
---
"can't milk those"
---
*Kick!*
---
Rogues are not heavily reliant on cooldowns to simply CC. The power they have to control an opponent is what makes them valuable in PvP, group or otherwise. 
---
You assist your team with CC chains on priority targets whether it's healers and mages in the back line or following your warrior's targeting path in order to lock down their target for them, which is especially useful if you're Horde into Alliance.
---
The only cooldown you might be heavily reliant on is Blind, and only if you're hoping to completely lock out a healer to kill someone important.
---
ill be roleplaying trust me
---
Tradition is tradition! It's all about the Classic Experience
---
I would spend all day holding my wife in my arms if I had one.
---
Thats exactly why me and the boys are rolling alliance after being horde for 15 years lol
---
Wait does the dude actually have a past in WoW or are people just memeing the hell out of this?
---
- Sincerely, an European
---
No, I just get constant ads for a Game of Thrones game... even though I don't really watch the show or google anything about it. :S
---
well I went in to vanilla alone and ended up joining the only guild I ever raided with through multiple expansions. Outside of leveling in a new expansion I haven't actually played wow since Mop. I guess I am hoping to repeat the cycle.
---
Same as a  Norwegian. I hate when other people do this, and I hate doing it myself as some people almost expect you to treat a Norwegian person better / prioritize them because of nationality.
---
This post needs more upvotes.
---
Desperation!
---
Yeah I have enjoyed watching how so many people say Vanilla was do hard and time consuming. When it was seen as the easy casual game at the time. I was looked down by some kids because I played it and not whatever hardcore game they were
---
If I cannot do 30 push ups then it will be 100 sit ups! If I cannot do 100 sit ups then it will be 200 squats!

"brb drinking some demon kool-aid and smashing a happy nature god into the dirt."
---
I'm hoping the take it in a similar direction to osrs. I feel like jagex does a really good job of polling the players on new things and also adding things that stay true to the nature of the game. I'm really interested to see where they take it after the first year or so and I really hope they maneuver themselves correctly.
---
Fuck the mindset has changed over the years now that we're all adults we look at this pile of food and think that it's the worst thing on the planet, its so bad for you, all those carbs etc etc but as kids we would fucking drool over that stuff and that would be a dream.   
---
Hats off to OP for retapping into his childhood. I hope you don't rush to consume it all though.
---
Yup it's not even close. The only set that's ever been in the game that's better than Dreadnaught is Blackhand's set.
---
Holy hell me too, that’s going to be funny shit.
---
IT’S A DESPERATE RACE AGAINST THE MINE
---
Back in vanilla people would definitely "tip" for a tank. Enough that a bored tank would just help a group out. I never saw many tanks spamming for payment though. They had a lot to do. Guilds, friends and randoms constantly asking them for help
---
Amazing detail on the gear, I can recognize so many things!
---
I was 11 almost 12 in original, im 26 almost 27 now, cleared mc, bwl, zg, aq40, never step foot in naxx, rank 10. Some kids aren't dumb like todays fortnite poggers
---
Yeah, would still need the 5 gallon bucket, gonna need the worlds greatest minds to get on this ASAP.

Elite quests and risky tanks that are new to Vanilla tanking
---
why not? as a fan, loyalty is to the team not the players, acting morally righteous on reddit.    "forced to retire" playing god much? clearly you have no idea bout classic wow launching 40hours from now, Capt Luck is not a filthy casual...  he'll be back in the NFL by the end of phase 4.
---
Properly, at this point wow's a better sub since it includes everything up to wod

Unfortunately they weren't. Their dps specs are the worst if the meme specs.

I wish we had visible backpacks in wow.

---
Skeram looking like a snacc
---
Good luck, friend. I hope you get to play a ton!
---
I'm real excited to see how the servers economies work out! Like the AH is gonna be worthless for awhile because no one has gold
---
&gt; Is it something worth doing if you're a competent tank with some free time and low on gold  
---
Yes  
---
&gt; Curious on how you did it or how you've seen other people do it  
---
"Selling tank services for all dungeons or raids, PST for details"  
---
&gt; When Dire Maul arrives and you've made a shaman friend  
---
"Selling all gear from Zevrim, Hydrospawn, and Alzin. 15g per item. PST"
---
4 servers are being added on Monday at 10am Pacific.
---
Your right. It does make you sound like a greedy scumbag..    just play the game. You will earn gold faster by leveling up and doing higher content than selling tank services to lowbies..
---
Haha, I have also been in the PoE scene railing against efficient trade, but that's another story.
---
As I said in my parent (three up from your post), spamming a channel is optional and IMO the least effective way to form groups. Whispering strangers one-on-one really works and people appreciate the personal attention. Having a conversation with people is kind of the definition of socializing :)
---
I can't really speak to what nu-Classic will hold - humans are different now, perhaps - but yes, I played WoW heavily from release to mid-TBC, and I made many fantastic connections with absolute strangers. If you go into a pickup dungeon with the attitude of "these people are disposable and I only care about them insofar as they can help me finish this dungeon", then probably you will not make many friends.
---
But Classic is an environment which really encourages you to take things slowly and rely on one another, and this happens to be a great environment to talk shit to strangers in. There is a huge amount of downtime (running to the dungeon, drinking, waiting for patrols, walking through large dungeons, corpse runs, swapping out a member if someone needs to leave) and you NEED other people (not just for dungeons; most zones will have a difficult section which is way easier with a group of 2 or 3). On top of that, the pace of everything is a lot slower. So what do you do with all of this free time while you're with other people and working towards a common goal? Well, often, you chat to them, and sometimes you have some stuff in common and you make friends. 
---
It helps if you have that openness - "every stranger is a potential friend" - but even if you don't, I think Classic may surprise you :) It's very, very slow, the systems are very simple, and you see the same faces over and over again: people are the most interesting thing in Classic. So you talk to them.
---
Yeah but Dwarf Priest is just awful looking and Human Priest has shit racials so I'm stuck going Horde sry guys
---
That's the joke you brainlord
---
I appreciate and understand what you said. Sorry some streamer told their drones to screech at you
---
Just bought a really nice ThinkPad t450p and plan on playing on that. Got the model with the i7, Intel hd 5500, and 8gb ram for $340 on eBay. Beautiful laptop and perfect for classic and MTGO which is what I wanted it for. When I have time to sit at my desk I'll enjoy my ultrawide and gaming pc but otherwise stoked to play on a laptop as I did the first time I experienced wow.
---
:-)
---
They changed it in beta because people would /yell to lure people into ganks.
---
Never too soon lol
---
Oceanic wake and bake for release! 
---
8 am Tuesday fellas
---
You can’t compare retail Warrior to Classic Warrior. There’s 0 resemblance.
---
Yes but the average skill level of players now a days is astronomically higher than in vanilla. Not to mention anyone no lifeing it to get to 60 in a week probably knows the game well enough to pug ragnaros.
---
Man I feel for you lol that is just awful
---
There's going to be a LOT of people coming in on Monday and the first week. I don't think any server is safe at the moment.
---
Ha oops I goofed, that's crazy obvious now. Thanks.
---
Shadowpriests melt faces in PvP
---
Tell her it's just some really funny porn.
---
Incendius would like to know your location.
---
So you can get higher lvl than me and gank me?! No, I don't think I will.
---
Man, I would love to see a gif of Thanos (WoW Classic Playerbase) snapping his fingers and then all the people (Classic Servers) turning to dust.
---
Give it to me. Easy.
---
Isnt that drax
---
And to think that they could get away with as little as they had from the beginning. :)
---
IIRC banishing a target that is already banished does nothing. In Classic, they are immune to everything. You have to wait the debuff timer out
---
Get her to play. Worked for me.

I just use my right hand and hit one of my 17 mouse buttons..

Lol couldn't happen to a bigger dbag, well maybe assmomg.
---
At the time of release WoW was considered an easy mode RPG.  Anyone experienced with PC gaming in general will get by just fine.  Modern WoW isn't any better or worse for newer players.  It's just geared to providing a smoother minute to minute gameplay loop.  Which wasn't much of a thought back when these games were originally being developed.
---
You give him that long?
---
What a shitty guild.
---
Some great tips bro! 
---
Personally I have a chin up bar above my computer and I plan on getting a MINIMUM of 10 reps in per level. I even have a core workout set up for this se lengthy flight paths! 
---
Im hoping by the time I hit 60 i’ll have that herod bod I’ve always dreamt of.
---
Every name suggestion in this post is 110% already taken i promise you
---
bro 😎💪
---
They really just need to re-add the old world to retail.
---
They already have systems in there for it. You can already switch between old and new Silithus. They need to expand it and allow people to travel between all variants of the world.
---
Lmfao
---
Curse of tongues is honestly such a bullshit spell
---
That one made me laugh. I really miss that aspect of the game.
---
If he isn't partnered, yes. If he is, no I don't think he can.
---
So glad my FF draft isn't until next Saturday!
---
I  completely agree with this comment.
---
Is there a way to see faction distribution, or has it been discussed?
---
That's not right. The Gurubashi Arena is also a neutral area. Everyone inside equally hates each other.
---
those home depot buckets are fantastic.
---
The ZG tiger is only cool if you're horde, and the raptor is only cool if you're alliance. 
---
The whole gimmick is that it was a way to have "the other side's" mount.
---
Good man! We are close now :)
---
I'm just going by what i've read on the classic wiki, you never know if the information there is accurate but it does state that the mechanic exists
---
excellent reassurance , i think this is a valuable contribution, and i feel gratitude, my friend
---
You are very talented.   Belt is kinda weird - braids would make more sense.   Dwarves are my favorite, too bad they can't be warlocks.
---
I think I will take tomorrow off from any car work! I am walking carefully at a low traffic time to get snacks tomorrow and then just spending the day with stillness and contemplation toward the final Night of rest preceding this great and surreal moment.
---
True but that’s why I am considering deleting my characters.
---
Feel fine
---
King honor, friend!
---
Booooo.
---
Let’s just appreciate that there’s a Warcraft+football crossover growing on right now.
---
Definitely wasn't aware of this at all. I thought the trinket would cleanse any CC
---
Dude. Yes.
---
I WAS HEALING FOR YOU WE WERE ALL HEALING FOR YOU HOW DARE YOU
---
Yeah horde do look pretty sick but I just gotta make the sacrifice for the betterment of the game. Need that faction balance yo.
---
That's gorgeous!
---
Im on aggramar, you horde or ally?
---
What a truth! Some of those pesky side quests take too long when there the same level as you...
---
Locks have got something up their sleeve for everything
---
I found paladin easier than warrior when it comes to tanking while leveling. Start by getting consecration. Then go down the prot tree.
---
With warrior you are often rage starved while leveling and especially in early dungeons. This is why you need taunt as a warrior.
---
As a paladin, judge SoR on Skull, and then lay down consecration w/ ret aura. Now everything is glued to you. SoR and tab target. Save HoJ and BoP for when / if you do lose aggro.
---
Once you get Holy Shield and Reckoning, you will do some really great reflective threat. This all really helps you keep aggro. The trick with Paladin tanking is just getting the opener right. Judging SoR is a must. Unless undead / demon, then use Exorcism.
---

---
Everything up to 60, but after that they fall apart, from what I read.
---
I finally caved today and installed retail.  Made a new tauren shaman, as I intend to in classic.  Didn't use any of my heirlooms or the lowbie mount.  I knew it wouldn't be what I wanted, but I just needed something.  
---
1-10 was way too fast.  I never went below 95% mana or 80% health.  I was really put off by the class changes overall.  Blah blah, we all know the difference between BFA and Classic.  I did surprise myself a little bit with what I did like, though.  
---
It doesn't hold true for me for every class, but the modern spell animations for shamans (particularly elemental) are really fucking badass.  Mechanically I prefer the flight time of old lightning bolt, but the instant CRACK of the new spell is extremely satisfying.  The water theme of their healing spells was a good idea, and sets the class apart from others.  Visually, I really like the changes they've made.  Some people hate them, but I like the new race models and animations too.  If only the gameplay matched the visuals.  
---
I do not want these things for classic servers, to be clear.  Not at all.  But if Blizz did decide to do Classic+ servers in a few years, I would definitely not argue with a client-side toggle between old and new graphics/models/animations.  
---
I got bored at level 10 and logged out.  Now I'm just sitting here writing unsolicited comments on reddit because I seriously don't know what to do with my life until Monday afternoon.
---
I second that notion!
---
But that's what the poster is saying, they don't have poor scaling in pvp, pvp isn't a DPS fight, it's not PvE, I hit HWL hunter, and could still 3 shot a rank 14 "Healing priest" if I got all crits, they do not fall off in PVP at all.
---
Lying in bed, my wife sleeping next to me. As soon as I clicked that she moved around and made a wimper noise. Thankfully she didn't actually wake up to that lol
---
no scarecrows needed but thanks!
---
I personally like this list categorization a lot more then the last one.
---
12 lol we will see how this go’s
---
For 500 bucks you should be getting a laptop with a gtx 1050 at least
---
Done.  Who will join me???
---
i was on horde bonechewer around 2008ish, even we have a brokeback mountain guild
---
That “Club Thrall” track tho...
---
D': why does everybody hate us
---
The true Herod boss is going to be the server queues
---
EverQuest progression servers came out before OSRS I believe
---
You do know there was a time where PvP wasn't going to be added? game didn't even launch with an honor system
---
on pservers it was fairly common for first orb in strat live runs to be reserved for the tank
---
Bye Felicia
---
Yeah and I don't even care too much about how Troll/Undead look as much as I really hate how Dwarf looks. It's mostly about the priest racials. Feedback is SO bad lol.
---
I second this. Sounds like your GPU is about to blow. Quite unfortunate.
---
Yeah I'd say. In competitive PvP there aren't much 1v1s going around.
---
&gt; But Classic is an environment which really encourages you to take things slowly and rely on one another, and this happens to be a great environment to talk shit to strangers in. There is a huge amount of downtime (running to the dungeon, drinking, waiting for patrols, walking through large dungeons, corpse runs, swapping out a member if someone needs to leave) and you NEED other people (not just for dungeons; most zones will have a difficult section which is way easier with a group of 2 or 3). On top of that, the pace of everything is a lot slower. So what do you do with all of this free time while you're with other people and working towards a common goal? Well, often, you chat to them, and sometimes you have some stuff in common and you make friends.
---
See this is the part where people lose me. I get the whole insta inviting people, and teleporting you to a place kind of kills player interaction. Makes perfect sense. But where people lose me is that all the stuff you mentioned above, happens when you're already in a group. Like just because you use a addon to parse chat to make it so you can find people faster without having to manually read chat channels, doesn't make you unable to have conversations with people once you're in a group.   
---
Basically what I'm saying is that the act of finding and joining a group should be way simpler, because the actual meaningful player interaction happens once you're in the group. That's where people are potential friends.
---
That's what I was afraid to hear.
---
This, my friends that have waited to resub have done so today or will tomorrow. Thex help us all.
---
Damn. They'll have to play 8hrs a day at world record pace to get 60 that quickly
---
I'd suggest resubbing today. A LOT of people are going to be resubbing monday. Their store might be tough to get through with so many people trying to resub at once. It'd be worth the 50 cents to make sure you don't have any problems resubbing.

😂
---
If you have soulstone up (30 min cd) you can win any 1v1, even if they get the opener. 
---
If you have no soulstone you are usually a free kill for hunters and rogues
---
To the ladies that have to deal with seeing this fucking meme every day.
---
It will definitely be interesting to see how long players stay active in classic.
---
I plan on playing for years, but have no idea how many share that sentiment, and I'm very excited to find out.
---
Yet I'm over here hoping that one day they do relaunch wrath. I was working in the oil sands for the entire expac. I didn't return to wow until cata was in full swing. Having to hear how great wrath was in its prime is something I would love to experience. So it goes both ways :)
---
Based /fit/ Chad dropping redpills
---
So I updated my graphics driver and it opened wow classic properly. I exited out and closed battle.net and now when I go to open battle.net it says it open in my taskbar but again the window isn't opening.  Very strange. Now I can launch either bfa or classic from the files but cant open battle.net
---
100% accurate
---
/r/lewronggeneration
---
They said if the community wants BC they will get BC but I’d imagine they will let those who want to stay in classic, stay in classic.
---
It's weird that it feels like it's worse now.
---
Deal with it.
---
Warrior vs mage in Classic too then. :&gt;
---
Still not the point of the video.
---
Rogues are scissors.  
---
Warriors are rock. 
---
Hunters paladins priests druids mages and shamans are paper.
---
The only non-bot who ever sends you mail.
---
you need macros in classic, because you need to switch to 1 hand and a shield to 2 hand weapon in combat, if you want to be a good warrior
---
That's....not asking people directly....but ok.
---
smash , fun strong tank good good fun smart
---
Are you a USC fan?
---
They wanted servers to fill up before adding more to ensure that they are populated after the "tourists" are done playing
---
FYI, Rat Catcher's flute can't be abused like that in Classic.
---
is there a list somewhere of official/community server discords?
---
Naa we will remain in the horde, we just have that rare trait many people seem to sadly lack or forsake (or not believe that you have to practice them in order to keep them alive), empathy and honor.
---
Good god. People actually did that? Farmed dozens of 3 shot weapons from a dungeon to take to a raid ? The commitment to this game astounds me
---
This guy trolls
---
To be honest, I haven’t played with any true commitment since WOTLK. I probably won’t get much with what I have. I have a guild bank full of MATs from WOTLK and prior but I don’t think it will net much gold. I did level a chat to 120 for this expansion but quit again right after I hit 120.
---
I envy you rn. I have a long drive tomorrow and work on Monday I won't get to log on until about 6 hours after launch. :( Works gonna suck
---
**Warlock**: "We all float down here."
---
Same but my cat is a cuddle jerk. She loves to be cuddled...until she doesn't and then its BLOOD AND THUNDER.
---
imagine being this guy who actively tries to go against the wishes of blizzard to ship his shitty addon. he should just go play retail.  also his waifu is basic and he should feel bad.
---
Ask in chat if someone can help you with some random question. Whoever pm’s you and offers help you can pay them handsomely :)
---
Can't wait for classic to drop so i never feel like coming here again
---
I'm waiting until Monday and picking whatever server is the least full. Not wasting hours in a queue the first week.
---
"chosen to go into classic alone" 
---
yeeah sure, sounds like coping to me
---
The last chance you had to set your keybinds was the last stress test. The next chance you'll have is launch.
---
You've gotta have a lot of patience to be able to win the battle of attrition against other attrition classes. Otherwise you'll be pulling your hair out battling someone for 15 minutes.
---
DETROIT SMAAAAAAASH
---
show me ROOOOOOCK
---
No problem, I mained a rogue in vanilla and I'm happy to help if you have other questions!
---
While combat is definitely best for leveling, those builds (and almost all rogue builds tbh) utilize some key points from assassination. If you're into wpvp it seems best to pick those up early then go into combat afterwards, irrespective of weapon type.
---
They don't provide much value in group fights and competitive PvP. Yet I never saw a single premade group in Vanilla not running at least 1 Rogue because their lock down was too valuable.
---
Does autoloot work for pickpocket?
---
Yuuuuup the vast majority of people are probably waiting until Monday. It's going to get crazy.
---
Its called the *Horde* for a reason.
---
Yes! This is where you'll find me. Fighting for space on the log.
---
I know a Witch-Doctor in training dat can do dat
---
As a Mage, I second this. I might teleport a few feet ahead when I'm feeling lazy.
---
Ah well that's the stupidest thing I could think rip
---
Right. Most of the people didn't even know about it.   
---
But even if they did, the function is entirely different. One is connecting between people who have that addon, all while forming groups automatically without a single whisper, while the other basically provides you with a filter system instead of /who.   
---
It's not the same addon. Either read about it and do your research to not sound dumb, or move on to more compelling argument.
---
Interestingly found several people to play with, including my best friend since childhood, hopefully they don't pussy out on the way to 60 (or me for that matter)
---
No worries papa Activision-Blizzard has you covered there as well! You just get to boost a brand new character and they get all the mounts, achievements and transmog your old characters had! 
---
And continue as if they didn't matter at all!
---
If it is not worrisome for Blizz that the servers are full before launch then I guess they know better
---
I'm definitely looking forward to going back in alone. If I could explore worlds on my own, that'd be my dream job (right up there with my other dream job of serving on the Enterprise)!
---
I start a new job on launch day, after 6 years with my previous business... I did not think this through. Will be the long eat day of inductions and handshakes ever.
---
It's actually not. Read OP's reply son...........
---
Yet you cared enough to take the time out of your day to come here and comment.
---
You could work with a sandbox solution but I heard that the software has some virus
---
If they moved, then how did Stalagg fill up without Herod going down?

There’s more than a single study. I don’t act like I’m more knowledgeable than doctors when it comes to medicine. But doctors are not required to learn about nutrition in depth.
---
I got ketoacidosis looking at this picture.
---
Gotcha.
---
I'm genuinely surprised you put Frost mages that high. At least for phase 1 I suspect they will just flop too easily when targeted in group pvp.
---
Prot warrior is the optimal tank of choice. Druid and enh are inferior and no need to deal with a 3rd warrior as fury when we already have 2 warriors and a rogue. thats already enough dps for us.
---
fear --&gt; shield --&gt; sw:p --&gt; renew --&gt; outheal/outlast rogue. If a rogue gets that close to a priest, the priest was out of position or the priests' group it trash for not peeling.
---
The fel hunter (warlock pet) can remove any form of CC on the warlock
---
1 week of paid time off, for once a lifetime re-launch ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ? What's time wasted in another hobby, or should I be working?? Maybe this one week I should be hiking or traveling? Oh wait i'll do that the next week lol.
---
BevMo has them.
---
Please don't use the lfg addon, even if they make it work
---
I thought it was the priest? That's what we all joked about on our server. It wasnt an official wipe unless someone spoke those magic words.
---
Holy shit I forgot about twinks! This is amazing
---
My bros and I are rolling grob. Not gonna RP, but we just don’t want to play with tryhards
---
Fingermycrit
---
Gean, Russian and French server excepted, they're all English language. Hence my incomprehension.
---
Man I wish there were some football fans playing on Stalagg.
---
Maybe in later tiers but until T2 expect to die in a CB &gt; Evis before you can do any of that, especially if the Rogue is Undead.
---
Maybe it's just nice living in Europe we're we actually get months off work every year.
---
Seeing unspoiled Loch Modan in the 2nd to last stress test was actually a bit emotional.  I knew i missed that zone, but holy shit i forgot just how peaceful and beautiful it was.
---
Hell, on the last one i made a human just to not ruin the launch experience for myself (the other stress test was long enough ago i dont remember jack shit) and i even enjoyed Westfall way more than on retail.  I liked the CSI stuff the first time i did it back in Cata, but its gotten so stale, and the tornadoes and stuff there just dont feel right.
---
Theres actually a lot of quests like that from the Cata revamp.  The Day Deathwing Came in The Badlands, Fionas Caravan, etc.
---
Is the Vanilla Guide included in 8.2 zygors Guide ?
---
Or is there an extra Addon for it?
---
Cheers
---
Confirmed.  Coded by the devil himself.
---
You can remove stuns and anything else with the Fel hunter.
---
I'm trying to talk my wife into joining me, but she's hesitant. Other than that, I plan on making friends along the way.
---
While it is good, and I used it for making my own gear list, it's not perfect. The first example that comes to mind is [items that have a use effect such as the talisman of ephemeral power](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18820/talisman-of-ephemeral-power).
---

So you actively made it impossible for this person to play the game and the race they liked because you personally didn't like that race. I can't help but feel like that fun is very one sided.
---
Damn. Is it worth it at least? Tons of people I hear talk about it say it’s fun but those are also people who know people in it already.
---
Bruh. SFK was my shit.
---
Well no because even if they had left off an implied "I felt" it still doesn't work unless they have zero self control. You really think that little of OP?
---
Why are shamans neutral evil? Im of the opinion that some of the alignments fit more than one class and we're all just trying to pigeon hole them all into one of the 9 just to fill the chart, but I digress.
---
I honestly think frost mages are the single best spec in the game for PvP. They are just absolutely insane.
---
Hey don't forget the pet Fel hunter can remove stuns, so it's safe to roll undead
---
One of my favorite things about Grob so far is that it seems extremely decentralized. There's tons of regional RP-PVP guilds whose sole purpose is to defend places like Hillsbrad and Ashenvale.

Using the Light of Elune for world PVP has to be the single worst way to use the item.
---
Save it for that 1% boss wipe and become a legend.
---
Probably Maldiva.
---
You can leave then past in the past and still play this new iteration so I think they are just confused by your word choice.
---
It’s layering. Not sharding
---
Yeah, our points are weird. I also know almost nothing about ff
---
That took me back...
---
The pink chair is temporary.  I told her to supply her own chair when she gets a chance :)
---
I've only ever played Alliance and will continue to do so. I quit way back during Cataclysm so I'm getting back into Classic for the nostalgia factor instead of just something new by playing Horde.
---

If you make finding a new group member frictionless (instead of kind of a pain), a certain kind of player will see someone make a mistake (break CC, CC the wrong mob, overpull a couple of times), kick them, and instantly replace them with someone from the LFG machine, instead of taking the time to help and teach them. Sure, the new 5th still has to run to the instance, but you can keep going slowly with 4 until they arrive.
---
This "disposability" of humans completely kills any incentive to invest in the people in your group, even socially.
---
So from a social-design perspective, you want to make helping people who are struggling "more efficient" than replacing them for the ~~assholes~~ goal-oriented players.
---
Why are hunters evil lol
---
&gt; Are you sure you aren't adding those that are actually fun to play with IN the dungeon? 
---
The same could be said for when you use the addon, but even if you aren't, you are more tolerant to others, unless they really ruin the run constantly.
---
&gt; No one is adding everyone he found for his group ever.    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Friendship is created by bonding over something. Just beeing in a group doesn't create friendships automatically. Social bonding doesn't work like that. 
---
You're right, and bonding takes time. It's not in a single run that you will form friendships.  
---
But if you have the incentive to add them to your friend-list (to reduce downtime looking for people), you meet them again. and again. and then again.   
---
Slowly but surely you get to know the person. 
---
You'll never get those opportunities with this addon, is my point.
---
&gt; I honestly don't even think automatic matchmaking is taking anything worthwhile away. The dungeons that require no communication are the issue. 
---
It takes away what i said above. IMO it's very worthwhile to go through the trouble to know as many people and to form a group with them and know i can trust everyone in that party.
---
Every server will 100% fill up on Monday.
---
walking?wife?work?
---
what?
---
Just dislocate one, no need for a full break.
---
for most other games i enjoy i cant count on my friends, but for this one i got my original crew from 2005. gonna be amazing.
---
Thank you. That is the plan for sure.
---
You need to be level 10 to train swords and iirc it's like 10 or 20 silver so you probably should just wait until you've got to 10 for your rogue quests
---
That’s what I meant. Scattered people away but made it seem like they were all for the pc crowd.
---
If you haven’t been to a pax event recently, it’s been bad.
---
This was the home of the panel titled ‘how to make my straight, white, bearded male protagonist NOT suck!’ And in order to speak you had to state your pronouns and refer to theirs as they chose them.
---
You're the one with a shit attitude here lol
---
For me, Nature is a chaotic thing, which is why I put Druid there. Nature takes it's own course, and there are no rules to that.
---
Warriors to me epitomize the true blank slate. Some fight for good, some fight for evil, and some fight just to get paid. Some focus on honing their skills to be the best fighter possible, some focus on protecting others at all costs, and some give in to their rage to be an unstoppable offensive force.
---
Yes, it will.
---
No, Blizzard would never be stupid enough to make drastic changes to older versions or re-write the history that the expansions followed.  That's the best way possible to piss off their fans enough for them to drop out of Classic.  I know I would.
---
That cpu has integrated graphics, so you would not need a dedicated graphics card. Removing the 1050 from your budget you could probably increase the cpu to something like a ryzen 3  3400g. Even though they are integrated graphics they are capable of running wow classic without any issue.
---
Hate to say it but night elves didn’t get bangs until burning crusade
---
Maybe pump? Tesla driver?
---
Yeah there were actually in game grenade me that gave the Mohawk buff
---
I say Dutch/French because French is the region's second language, but in reality they don't start teaching it here until 10 years old. My kids are native in Dutch and the rest they are still "huh?" at. Enough English to understand the title of a Roblox game and understand half of the onscreen prompts (and they'll occasionally ask me "daddy, what's the English word for xxxx?") and that's it.
---
So when a WoW NPC starts rambling about something they get that blank stare and nope out. It's even worse if it's a quest you have to do something special like bring an enemy below 35% hp and then use a crystal from your backpack. They won't have a clue. Sure, I'll explain things to them, gladly, but that's not possible every time.
---
I'm the one telling people that they're worthless for trying to assist people. Right? Dipshit.
---
&gt; I got bored at level 10 and logged out. Now I'm just sitting here writing unsolicited comments on reddit because I seriously don't know what to do with my life until Monday afternoon.
---
I did what you did  a few months back (with no quest helper stuff enabled) and got to 83.  It really hit me at that point that i had no desire to level through anything past Wrath :/
---
I made a couple toons tonight to try to tide myself over and pass the time, but couldnt get past level 4 or 5ish.  Bleh.  I never even played Classic (started in Wrath) and im still hyped as fuck for this.  I miss things like talent trees so damn much, and even in Wrath you had to be careful what you pulled while leveling (especially without heirlooms).
---
Uuuuugh.  What are we at....41 hours to go?  Think im going to go fishing tomorrow to try to pass the time (and get one last bit of exercise in before i become a couch potato for at least a week)
---
Very nice on the horde one. If only it illuminated through the emblem. Damn.
---
You are now breathing manually
---
Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure. Tenno use the keys, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Void. I was cut in half, destroyed, but through it's Janus Key, the Void called to me. It brought me here and here I was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn it's simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist. But I, Vor, will cleanse this place of their impurity.

Oh snap! Ty good doctor!

I thought aoe farming was dead
---
Should probably show them this survey, posted on an english subreddit with a vast majority english respondants, showing a large proportion of the server population as spanish/portuguese. Seems crazy theyd make Oceania servers and no latin servers.
---
Whenever I have tried to use them I find they didn't work if they released. Its that a thing or am I remembering it wrong?

Bloodvine is phase 4 btw
---
The only one I don't feel real good about is Hunter, but if the goal was to spread them to all the alignments, I don't think anything else fits at all.
---
I guess you can argue that they are exploiting nature for their own good with no real care for law or acting for chaotic reasons.
---
Thats just when it gets funny! Rip

I have 600gb of 4g through a 4g router, my local service provider lets us data pool our phones so we got a data share sim, threw it into the 4g modem and BAM internet.  I have tested it and I can play classic really well so no issues there, if the wife wants to watch Netflix she just uses it on her iPad (it has a sim in the same pool)
---
Blizzard has the data, there was obviously a reason it was delayed 16 years.
---
I get the theory behind this but I've personally never experienced it. BFA was my first ever WoW expansion and I went into dungeons with almost 0 knowledge on mechanics and never got kicked. I didn't even know what interrupts were until I started doing Heroics and people were like "you guys need to use interrupts on these guys". I know it's anecdotal but I guess a large portion of my misunderstanding is just lack of experience. I guess we'll see what happens in classic.
---
Looks like a good target for some blight
---
They are not rdy for the shit show.
---
Slumber Sand too
---
I play Horde, so 0% of that happening. Plus for a rogue to even come close to pulling that of he'll need to be geared to the teeth as well and have all CD's ready. Not sure if you've ever played a priest but they're *quite* durable especially disc spec with imp holy fire imp shield...one of if not best 1v1 PVP (since you brought up 1v1). Didn't even touch SPriest since they'd shut most of that shit down too with mindflay and kite the rogue.
---
Bit late to this one, but thanks for including French on the NA server poll! since the previous ones didnt. I guess some people forget that despite there being French servers, theyre not really viable for people in NA.
---
If it was a change made during or before 1.12 then it'll be that way in Classic.
---
IMO disabling /follow in BG's is necessary anyway to prevent multiboxers from cheesing their way up the rank ladder with automation.
---
And that's where I'd strongly disagree with you. Most animals would fall into the neutral category, as they have no understanding of good or evil, right or wrong, as we understand. Nature itself is inherently neutral as even though it can be chaotic, as you say, it can also be benevolent. Nature has no concerns about good, evil, right, wrong, it just happens.
---
Most alignments here fit into more than one class, though, and I'm also looking at this from the DnD perspective where most druids, along with nature, are assumed to be true neutral.
---
I just assumed they were overstressed and I didn't want to exacerbate it further. 
---
Thanks for helping.
---
Polls indicate just half the people that are going to play have signed up.  They better be quick on that "add server" button.

Wasn't it mathed to be the best for rogues as well? With perfect usage or some such caveat.
---
The 2 gigs of ram are horrible, you'll struggle to keep windows open. Also an HDD and no ssd in 2019 is gonna be a horrible experience. Your best bet if you're comfortable with building it yourself is to get a b450 motherboard, a ryzen 5 3400g, 8-16gigs of ram and atleast a 240gig ssd (they're dirt cheap these days). Then later on if you need you can get a HDD for mass storage and a dedicated gpu if you wanna play other things, the integrated gpu in the 3400g should be more than enough for wow classic.
---
love the boomkin in the back lul

It sounds like that that’s the supposed plan.
---
I used to do this with pets so the stubborn fuckers would actually stop attacking
---
As a shazzrah, I'm going to log-on and get a feel of things, wait the queue a bit and see if people cave and hop to another realm. Though it's likely I'll be moving off to Firemaw or something. The survey's regarding the H:A ratio (though it is only reddit) isn't looking very favorable. (Almost 70% horde, 30% alliance)

I mean, I'm kind of there with you . . . but the only way I will survive the coming week is by taking an hour every day and going on a decent (5 miles plus) run.
---
And my puppy will be severely displeased with me if he gets no walks.
---
But yeah, no leaving the house till 60.
---
I always aksed myself how a russian keyboard looks like.
---
Agreed.  Like everyone else on here I want classic to succeed, but early launch hype isn't an indicator.  If classic can stay strong after 2 months and they are still adding more servers, then we'll know for sure that classic is in a healthy spot.
---
Ive had some of those days, though i busted ass on Friday (well, for half the day...did a good day or more of work in that time, though) so i cant feel too awful bad.
---
May or may not log into WoW on Monday to try to get some names when the new servers open up/character limits are removed....
---
Chinese gold/service sellers make so much money on classic compared to retail that there will be many many many more advertisements and ingame whisper spams coming down the road
---
I've always dreamed about playing a rogue from the stories my friends kept telling back in the day. so most def rogue. and many of my friends are returning and are going to be in a big horde guild in firemaw and invinted me to join, which I gladly accepted!
---
So that pretty much locked my fate into horde's 😅
---
Ive seen  worse. But yea
---
Skeram fam let go!
---
I’ve told my wife and she seems ok with it, but I haven’t told her that I will be playing with my ex gf.
---
This and scotch/endone. Imma ride this crazy train for as long as I can.
---
We get it, you're talented as hell. /s
---
Seriously though, amazing stuff
---
Yep on it, gotta go all out on the keybinds for classic lol.
---
Yer gonna need more beer
---
Short answer is DM ruin is always better.
---
However SM Ruin, is in my opinion, a superior spec.

---
Don't waste your breath. I had all classes 120 on tich horde and faction transferred them all to alliance when I was sick of being on the pussy team and tried my hardest to spread the gospel.
---
They didn't care. They only want easy mode pvp.
---
I have no shame saying when I saw them announce Classic that I teared up. I grew up with this game...
---
We're going home at last.
---
Haha yea I avoided frostmourne for that very reason. I transfered over from a US realm to Nagrand as it was supposedly pretty balanced, but with the crz's being out in the world it's still alliance everywhere. Also the little bit of Horde that does play with Warmode on always seems to avoid any PvP interactions.
---
Hunters can also be a problem for us in the first phase.
---
I had one of these at a LAN lock in when wow originally came out, I don't think I've ever had a worse headache in my entire life
---
The only way I would ever pay for a tank is if they would agree to not get any loot.  Otherwise, yeah, it seems like you're just a greedy scumbag that wants extra gold for choosing a warrior, which is honestly going to be the highest population class in the game.
---
I look forward to watching his stream. I had never heard of him until a couple weeks ago watching some of the youtubers videos and he is mentioned a few times and they all had good things to say about him as well.
---
The only reason i think druid as of neutral or even evil is because there is mention of the terms “druids” in jewish and christian scripture that paint a dissonant picture for druids as false idols with evil intentions!
---
I respect the fact that you have the precise time.
---
I always got the feeling all of our Euro players in Vanilla like playing English servers to practice. From the start of Vanilla til the end, their English was fluid and went from a formal style to casual style.
---
I can see that!
---
Man some people really are scum
---
NGL I feel personally attacked. I did most of these during vanilla at some point. 
---
I’m way too selfish a gamer nowadays though. git gud, l2p noob
---
watch the salt
---
No argument from me there. Fuck hunters.
---
I'm guessing most of the people that play retail grabbed their names on these servers and the old players coming back probably haven't even subbed yet so hopefully the full servers will level off when the tourists go home.
---
I believe so.
---
Danes and norwegians is on firemaw.
---
A twitchbaby would make that noise.
---
Longer you wait the longer I’m gonna camp you while you level from behind!

**\[A - Skeram - US\] Semi-Hardcore &lt;Garbage&gt; is Recruiting!**
---
**Faction**: Alliance 
---
**Realm (US East)**: Skeram
---
**Realm Type**: PvP
---
**Raid Times**: (7-10:30)
---
**Guild Type**: Semi-Hardcore
---
**Raid Schedule**: Monday and Wednesday
---
**Openings**: All roles
---
**About us:**
---
We are a tight knit group of friends who have known each other 10 years.  We aim to have fun, joke, and get things done.  Many of us have played and led several guilds spanning other MMOs such as FFXI, FFXIV, WoW, and WildStar.  We are excited to go back and experience the game that started it all.
---
**Goals:**
---
We will foster a friendly, mature, and inviting group that enjoys raiding and PvP, in a relaxed community.  We don’t intend on being server first, but will be raiding at a competitive pace.
---
**Raiding:**
---
We plan to start raiding about 5 weeks after release. We will be raiding two days a week and will plan to add an optional sunday flex day once more raids release. As a progression guild we will aspire to promote growth for our players to ensure we are competitive. 
---
**Loot distribution style**
---
We will be using loot council. This will aim to ensure guild progression is maximised for our raid schedule. The loot council will be open to experienced members and will be held to the utmost integrity. To foster trust and provide transparency, we will allow a selection of raid members, chosen at random, to attend council meetings to ensure equality.  There is no room for corruption within a successful council.  We will decide on members at a later point.
---
**Who we are looking for**
---
We are looking for new and returning players alike. We recognize that we are all human and make mistakes so we expect everyone to be humble and open to criticism. As such, we are willing to help new players. We are a mature community and are looking for like minded individuals. We want people who can be on time and ready for raids at the scheduled time. Most importantly we are looking for people who put fun first, joke around, and want a chill community to enjoy Classic WoW with.

---
Fish.  Never bothered with it back in the days of retail Vanilla.
---
Now Luck can no life wow! Brilliant!  😁
---
there are and were groups that believed the healer was responsible for healing all damage and resurrecting all players and the others could stand in whatever they wanted and die and blame the healer. those players were lucky if we didnt leave.
---
most etiquette is we failed together we run together.
---
two notable exceptions, you're letting the designated ooc healer do it (no longer applicable) or you're a night elf and the wisp has improved movement speed while dead that others cant compete with. if the healer or healer+1 die just waiting for the healer isnt unheard of. complete group? move that ass.

YES! I was hoping for this! Love it!

It's hard not to see in the sea of no effort from horde players ;)
---
Yeah... she always said the dumbest shit. I don't think she's actually picked up a controller in her life.
---
All information would just be approximations and rumors.... and could easily already have been adjusted before we play.
---
Stop worrying so much and play what you enjoy, or wait for detail information in upcoming weeks.
---
Just run them all as Arms. Have you seen what the prot tree gives? Tanking isn't your concern with dungeon cleave. The mobs do no damage. Your clear speeds will be faster with a 3rd arms warrior cleaving with WF. 
---
I'l just say this - you're free to run one, but good players aren't even considering it.
---
Really hate the fact that the guild I chose chose a full server.
---
I'm taking the same road, Glory to the Forsaken!
---
My point wasn’t that most people don’t use addons; I agree that most do. I was only trying to articulate how unique Classic is in that I think most people would prefer to maintain the integrity of the Classic experience if they had to choose between using addons or none at all.
---
Making fun is kids is cool! Look at them playing games LOL!!!!!!
---
Meth and an IV for hydration.
---
Twinking is a shitty thing and while I get where you're coming from I still think it's not really a problem, it's a lot like playing an OP character in a game, is it condemnable? Maybe, but not to a high degree.
---
We all do what we got to do.
---
See ya in game Andrew! 
---
👍😊
---
Hehe
---
From what I understand the void walker busted pulled more agro so people used a different talent set to level. The current and current build is drain tank which you don’t use void walker except for hard elites it has a different talent set up and is the way to level according to the discord’s and guides
---
I'm getting old. Do not understand those pants. Lol

Hope this will work without bugs, but it did during the beta apparently.
---
Of course the new people will be helped out, in some cases even coached. And equally on the opposite side, ganked.
---
This is coming from someone who plays tank and healer 98% of the time. DPS matters. There are a lot, but the good ones matter as much as the tanks and healers do. And in non m+ dungeons, ESPECIALLY in classic, tanks don't matter as much as they wish they did. A good healer and DPS can replace them. Warlocks, Hunters, fuck, even mages can replace them. Combat rogues have some good defensive measures. This oppressive toxic mindset of tanks and healers are all mighty gods above all DPS needs to die.
---
I believe you may have read my comment with a mocking tone, that wasn't my intent.
---
I don’t think you understand how sails work..
---
You can meet them at level 1 if you want (you will probably expolre enough to get to level 2 actually). It would make more sense to meet with then at level 10 in Barrens. Shouldn't take you more than 3-4 hours to get there.
---
Yes, yes he did! 😁

I don't have any BFA experience, but I played a lot of Guild Wars 2, and in that game people will kick you (or just leave) for playing a non-meta *class* in trivial, non-endgame content. So yeah, I'm sure there is variance across the board.
---
We'll see what happens. Enjoy Classic dude, it's a beautiful game and getting to experience it for the first time is something a lot of us envy you for.
---
Yeah the copycat Mahomes one is pretty lame
---
he clearly wasn't as good as me there was this trick i knew too never lose a duel id bubble then hearth.
---
Wouldn’t imagine so.

I am not this person eks dee

This is the bare minimum I would buy in your budget. There's still a bunch of money left there to get a case you like and maybe some extra storage, but that's up to you.

More like the Alliance relocating after we sack Stormwind

Eat healthy

Drink lots of water.

What part of my posts sounds like I'm screaming and acting unhinged? Read tone much?
---
Why are you still here?
---
&gt;Some kids aren't dumb like todays fortnite poggers

So are you calling the kids nowadays that play Fortnite dumb, or are you saying some of them aren't dumb? This could be read two ways, but the lack of any punctuation is making 0 sense to me.
---
He made 98 mil though.
---
I'd retire and get in on the launch of classic for far less than that LOL
---
Yeah but nobody cares about OCE
---
$11vs $15  (i love both games)
---
I so wish I could. I'm just glad the weekend will be a 3 day one with labor day.
---
You can definitely go level with your buddies. My plan actually is to roll a night elf, then corpse walk all the way to elwynn and start my leveling there! 
---
Goodluck!
---
Warlocks have stupid pets...
---
lol apple
---
Alone here. Friends won't play classic. They hate thought of it. My guild isn't even playing it either. All classic haters and doubters
---
Level 18?
---
make sure to watch clasiccast with him tipsout and esfandtv
---
I made this button switch connected to an LED on my desk. I jammed it in a doorway just outside my room and discreetly hid the wire so as soon as the door started to open it would depress the button and it would turn off the LED. I'd do the screen off and jump into bed with about a second to spare.
---
You can most likely make it work with Warlock. One of the fun things about Vanilla is also challenging yourself to find new solutions to problems. If there's a will there's a way kinda.
---
I really miss blizz posting fan made comics.
---
&lt;3
---
That's okay I'll relish being the underdog for once
---
Nice! it's actually pretty cool that you managed to find it, honestly I didn't think it existed. Good find.
---
xD
---
I love those pants.. you can hide a pair of Depends.
---
Nice. I was going through a divorce at the time and lost all interest in gaming for roughly 18 months, and totally missed the release. I'm using this release as a kind of small recovery of my 2004.
---
My pleasure!
---
:3
---
Warlocks where soloing open world elites, mara ect on vanilla. Never saw a warlock soloing dire maul though. I’m assuming that’s what you meant since you can probably solo deadmines at level 40.
---
Your art is absolutely amazing mate! Just went through all your posts and upvoted the shit out of them.
---
Will probably sign up for Patreon.
---
I started playing wow in march of 2005.  I had only played FPS games up until that point. It caught me in a way that I cannot describe.  My only bit of advise is to not let your friends push you into leveling fast. These guys have already experienced it and will likely blow through levels. Do it at your own pace, let the world take you. You will never truly be able to experience vanilla, but I think this is the only way you can get close to the experience.
---
I hope it catches you in the same way it caught me.
---
It was magical.
---
I cant access this survey
---
Wow classic will stay classic because they called it wow classic.
---
If they release expansions then it's not classic wow anymore .
---
What it will stay is in it's name.
---
I'm all for them releasing expansions, but like I've said before I think they should do it by copying characters and having separate servers for the expansions.
---
Yeah my worthless life is gonna have meaning and I won't kill myself atleast for a few more months I'm hyped
---
They don't become unavailable, they just don't show up as ! above the NPCs when you're too high level. You can still pick them up.
---
I've always preferred this version: https://youtu.be/hBkEMI9tt3w?t=40
---
The first time walking to those gates
---
There's still a bit of confusion as to whether is will be Western or Eastern. Two different Blizz sites contradict each other on this point.
---
Damn, well there goes my plan. So best shot would just be logging in exactly 30 minutes prior to launch? Maybe 25-29 before?
---
you are amazing :3
---
I'm even looking forward to opening day hiccups and queues, as sick as that sounds.  I'll be pounding the login button 5 minutes before opening, hoping I make it through the login server overload but with a twisted anticipation of something going awry.
---
Mid 20s? Baby...

FFA is an absolute must because it means whoever is closest to the corpse can loot it, instead of making people run across a field to loot “their” corpse.

Bist du wirklich so dumm, dass du behauptest leader of the wind wird zu windfuhrer übersetzt. Und lokomotivführer zu leader of the train? Ich bin sicher du warst miserabel im englischunterricht du horst.

I LOVE this. Not even sure why. ⬆
---
Wow classic has made me start watching old wow videos again. This is one of my favorites.
---
And alliance has more shitty pve players
---
&gt;weekly threads **listed in the sidebar**

Maybe look at the sidebar?

But rogue looks much better undead

Could of should of would of been a ballerrrrrrr

\&gt; Any tank using blood rage when tanking should be gkicked. 
---
[Bloodrage](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=2687/bloodrage)?
---
Yeah blink removes stuns.
---
people that took vacation? people without a job? students? crazy that u cannot even imagine people can get this amount of time to play...
---
“Roughly” 7 weeks with your current listed hours. That’s on the generous 150-200 hour mark. I’m sure if you REALLY push for max level while playing, you could do 150-175 hours, or around 6 weeks.
---
The justification is so obviously made up.  
---
Then they might as well remove the chat, and remove player characters as well since you can ''spell out words'' with them as well
---
Staysafe is very good when he doesn't pander to the chat often. It gets annoying quickly, at least to me
---
whoa, such a beautiful memories! i feel honored to make you recall them &lt;3
---
ouch, did not expect that here
---
Wow some more elitetranslation. But that doesnt makes leader of the wind translated to windfuhrer
---
Shadowmeld mindcontrol shenanigans tho
---
servers aren't the only thing that's gonna be full and high for the first few weeks
---
Having Pet Attack and Recall macros on the mouse wheel seems very intuitive too. Forwards and backwards :)

Well that would make a real shit episode if they followed them through Northshire Abbey trying to kill some kobolds. They took liberties for the sake of the show’s style and story but kept true to WoW’s essence too.

People like you make this game... GREAT!
---
This comment is so cringe inducing it actually made me shiver.
---
Butchering people on world-pvp is ruining other ppl RP?   
---
It sounds stupid, i think the answer is no.  
---
:v
---
While I don't know this for a fact but when you say blizzard can "escalate infinitely" the implication is that you can effectively remove the API making it impossible for addons to get info from the game in a meaningful way, which in turn would break most addons, would you not agree with that ?
---
Only if one of the group has the mace to spawn the last boss.
---
I want to do that, but I get a lot of pushback from my environment (wife, friends, family) about buying equipment for low intensity training. And there's the "history of failed attempts" working against me.
---
Especially since I also have other, more psychological, issues which I should get on track first I you'd think "working out a bit" should be a lot lower on that list, but meanwhile my gut, while I'm keeping it in check somewhat (87kg at 1m80) is working against me, my wrists are atrophying and I don't get enough exercise to sleep well.
---
Not sleeping well then makes it harder to work on my issues.
---
Smells like a vicious cycle if I can't get the gradient to reverse.
---
It's not all bad of course. I have good weeks where I am on top of things and I have weeks where I let everything slide way too much. My wife calls it my rubberbanding.
---
that's why I found that one
---
Once I skipped a week of school straight to go to my friend's house and play wow in his basement. His dad worked from home and never gave two shits. It was great while it lasted.
---
Also, I got my dad addicted to wow and he kinda just took over my account after a while. Couldn't afford it one month and he paid for it, and from then on I had to wait on him to stop playing till I bought another account for myself lol
---
Accidentally deleted my post on pservers the void walker pulled more threat from my understanding so it changed the way people leveled. The now recommended way to level is drain tanking according to the discord and guides. This was the go to method in vanilla but got replaced on pservers buy the void walker build.

Having to state your pronoun is pretty corny but using the pronouns of a person is just basic respect.

I have never heard of that panel and obviously didn't attend it but like, there are a lot of shitty videogame protagonists by that description who suck. I don't think a panel on character writing is really something to cry "PC gone mad" over.

What do you do for pet recall? Set to passive and follow?
---
Always had someone in my raid like this, trying to save repair bills. It often backfired, having him pull the boss and wipe us again while we were rebuffing.

Iceblock breaks charm

I remember I tried out WoW just after TBC released. My friends had just picked it back up with new xpac and told me I should try it. So I rolled a Tauren Druid. I thought Mulgore was boring and didn't care for pre-animal form druid gameplay.
---
Told my friend no thanks, but he gave me his 7 day free trial. So I want home rolled a hunter. I didn't even see the time go by until my internet went down at my apartment! Next thing I knew I was at the library with my laptop ducking behind shelves and hiding from librarians, trying to hide my shame. I just have spend 4-6 hours trying not to get kicked out.  I went out and bought the game and xpac the next day.
---
Gonna lose to a level 15 Hunter
---
You missed - remember?
---
Yes also stuns, the other alternative is to charm the rogue with the succubus when he opens on you.
---
We'll be here waiting for you old friend
---
Exact same thing I ended up doing. Really wanted a male undead priest but ShadowGuard is so fucking good. Male troll is the worst model in the game imo but female actually looks pretty good.
---
You should bother to read the comment I was replying to, you'd be surprised to find out that my reply makes sense.
---
How much did you pay her to pose next to the trolley?
---
Can't tell if you're trolling, or if you genuinely didn't realize that trailer came out years and years ago haha
---
What about when you fill all backpack slots though? Carrying 5 bags would look hilarious
---
Good luck getting it ready for launch.
---
I mean, i like to get a lil jazzy so probably take closer to 30-40 w some dry sift hash to compliment.
---
You know... you could play classic on your grandma's 20yo Dell just fine... but a new build is always exciting.  Grats m'man.  :)
---
Hard to believe that 2017 copyright.  Damn weve come a long way.
---
We'll see what things look like in two years, but there is a lot of support on this sub right now for TBC and WotLK reboots. Personally I think they're much more risky ventures for Blizzard then Classic, but you never know!
---
You'll be fine friend 👍
---
nice...better than my recent build
---
The surveys are saying only 50% subscribed already, so its looking dim. Asked to change servers but in the end it won't even matter.
---
lost it at 'goes afk to pet a dog'
---
So the laptop is your main PC? How does it perform? 
---
I'm due an upgrade and have been toying with the idea of just buying a laptop as a desktop replacement but it's a lot of money to put down on what, from my perspective having avoided laptops for gaming my entire life, is a gamble.
---
Do you understand how comment chains work as a conversation? Guys asks about the best warlock race. Is correctly told that Orcs are. Insert reply about cows having warstomp. 
---
One of these is not relevant. Fuck it’s like you people have never actually had a conversation and managed to stay even slightly on topic.
---
That's just wrong. Your elitism is not just out of place, it is also wrong.

Swore I'd never buy another Logitech after the 5th one started it's insane auto-double-click after just 2 months.

I use a corsair scimitar now.
---
Subbing tomorrow and I know many who are doing the same as well!
---
Seems lazy to me, You need subscription for Classic. With the limited servers if anyone spells out anything you could simply perma ban them. If someone tries to do adds you get free money as the have to subscribe and create accounts for it.
---
Just make it clear spelling out ANYTHING with corpses is a bannable offense.
---
Thank you :)

It’s not 2gb ram, it’s 8gb ram. Look again, I had to check as well.
---
The average taint length is 6”.   Fact.
---
Not a dot spec, it's a DS/Ruin spec, but using the pet for 10% damage buff while still utilizing pets effectively.  
---
The spec focuses on having the most powerful Imp and Succubus + 10% damage from Demonologist, but still using the pet itself, either for CC or reduced threat.  
---
Literally I lose 5% Shadow specific damage, while gaining control of a pet that can CC and attack with me.
---
I went into vanilla alone back in 2004. This time I'm entering with 45 people, most of them are people I met in WoW and some are even IRL friends now.
---
You will have a blast :)
---
Nice, a case of redbull AND beer! I will lay flowers on your grave, friend

I love how awkward some of the Vanilla item models are, haha.

Oh, it's the 2gb gtx1050 with gddr4 ram. Ew.

As I'm reading the replies to this thread I can myself losing brain cells. Your point is clear and valid, rogues aren't s tier in premade battlegrounds like they are in world pvp

Thank you I haven’t had a computer since cataclysm and I played on my little sisters laptop for a while during MoP now I decided to get something good that’ll last me a few years
---
&gt; Nature itself is inherently neutral as even though it can be chaotic, as you say, it can also be benevolent. Nature has no concerns about good, evil, right, wrong, it just happens.
---
Chaos and benevolence are not mutually exclusive. I agree that nature is not concerned with good or evil and that it just happens. That is why Nature is neutral. But it also unconcerned with order, which is why I have it as Chaotic Neutral. Chaos is not "bad."
---
I notice its always other horde shamans that are fellow ents.

Put my nelf druid from vanilla at the druid trainer in shadowglen, who knows. Maybe she'll be training new young druids now that her training days are far, far gone.
---
Wasn't it the turtle in tanaris? But for alliance it might as well be windsor or that rambo guy.
---
Guys, I honestly applaud every single pro football player that decides to retire early. What is an arbitrary legacy worth over life-long happiness and well being? You worked your entire young adult life to get to this point, and were rewarded with a short period of recognition. Recognition is worth much much more than regular attention. To top it all off, you earned a lifetime of wealth and your family will be able to benefit from your accomplishments without the sacrifice of your physical and mental well-being by continuing to push passed the pain while risking your future. Well done. I'd do the same thing. Although I respect those whose drive may be different. All in all, this is a great decision.
---
oh my god that's brilliant, thank you
---
Never played WoW before, but why shouldn’t I pick a High server? Isn’t it better so that the worlds are more lively and won’t some people quit after a couple weeks post launch so you wouldn’t have to worry about it being too high? Also, do we know why characters are locked on servers? I know from Runescape that you can choose any world to play on at anytime, why is WoW different in this regard?
---
So many toxic wanabe white knights in replies. This is ugly.
---
I can imagine a lot of work went into this addon, and it's quite fair to be annoyed by lack of acknowledgment and basic respect from WoW's devs. You can at least have some communication to make clear and transparent boundaries on what's good and what's not. Just cutting with an axe won't work.
---
People seem to view WoW Classic through rose tinted glasses. All those #nochanges wankers will be gone within a month because "it sucks", I guarantee it.
---
Instead of pushing against imaginary slights, how about we make the game the best MMORPG it can be. Keep the RPG aspects strong (that Retail lost), and keep the fun present, so you don't spend 2 hours looking for that last spot tank every day.

Started intermittent fasting 2 months ago.  No plans to break that trend.  More time gaming, less time eating.  Lots of water tho
---
And I was making a joke about how if a Shadow Priest mind controlled you, they could make you see them as 'good'
---
Then double up the nose beers the next morning for round 2
---
&gt;That's probably destructive in some way
---
It is 100% destructive in several ways. Proper sleep is critical. You might be someone who needs less than most, but 3-4 hours a night is ludicrous and is without question causing damage.
---
At 40, you're getting close to an age where when the wheels fall off the bus they will fall off hard. I recommend looking into solutions for your racing mind in order to get more sleep. Melatonin can help regulate sleep patterns.
---
It's also unconcerned with chaos, it's a force you can't apply chaos or law on. To be either chaotic or lawful, it has to be a sentient being. I mean even the granddaddy god of nature in DnD (Silvanus) is classified as true neutral, as are the majority of druids. Upholding the balance of nature? Neutral. Animals? Neutral. Nature itself? Also neutral.

What exactly does being optimal mean? The only reason to not train spells as soon as they’re offered to you is because you’re broke and can’t afford to. Once you get to max level you’re just gonna train them all and save for your epic mount anyway. They’re not exactly going to break your bank. Just buy them whenever you can.
---
I think anything with a chicken.
---
It doesn't matter.  You're going to be moving to one of the new servers (you know, one of the servers that doesn't have a 10 hour queue) as soon as you start.  And you'll be stuck with whatever name you're able to get.  "xLegolasx" if probably your best bet.

If you are try hard it's good basically.  There is an item that lets you have 20 energy i believe when you shift into cat. There's also talents that lets you get energy when you shift into cat.
---
Meaning if you want to cat dps. You are gonna be using 80 energy, leaving cat form. Entering cat form with 80 energy again. Meaning you will "powershift" for 80 energy each time you run out.
---
Druid tank is also viable on SOME PvE bosses. But is insanely good for Dungeon leveling simply because you are the least gear dependent tank.
---
Many threads on this.
---
Short answers:
---
Viable for tanking? Yes. Excellent in 5 mans. Competent OT's in raids, especially if guild wants to accelerate Warrior gearing.
---
Viable for DPS? Maybe. Requires incredibly fussy rotation and obsessive farming of consumables. Can hit top tier DPS much easier with other classes. For the ultra-committed only.
---
Viable for healing? Ferals can provide acceptable spot healing and can 5 man heal a dungeon as long as the group is marginally competent.

I'm a huge college football fan and also a returning wow player. (I played a lot in cataclysm and even a bit in vanialla) I'll have a tough time balancing the upcoming college football season, work, and classic wow in the near future. Glad I'm not alone.
---
In WoD models ? Lol
---
Nice, getting a better and better view of it, I'm alot less scared and alot more excited now to roll RPPVP and take my friends with. Thanks alot for the info, very much appreciated :)). Have fun in CLASSIC!

To those still looking at this discussion: if you're looking to use the demonic runes to keep your health low then you would also use a macro to activate the racial. This would mean you wouldn't be "Panicking" while low... All part of the plan...

Skeram! Come to Skeram! We've got a great community going and it's gonna be a blast. I plan on playing Alliance there myself.
---
I’m also brand new going in blind!  Unfortunately my buddies convinced me to go alliance so I suppose I’ll see you on the battlefield!  Good luck to the both of us, I don’t think I know what I’m getting myself into.
---
Yeah I will adjust it when I make my in-game macro that's just a prototype
---
Considering thay gay and bi people are under 10% of the population, I doubt they'll be making the difference. There's a good chance that the guy is right.
---
Some company actually did a major study of gender breakdown in major video games, including mmos like WoW. IIRC women were under 30% for WoW, and the highest in any mmo was ffxiv, where women were above 40%.
---
Well the saying isn’t talking about some moon - it’s talking about The moon.

The [pinned survey responses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14LUJjOp-BOOPT1J0vid1Pf3MzUbYULs-kzYlL2lMrRY/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true&amp;pru=AAABbOuOG0s*nydKNlfPqjJRP2pvZ7VIsA#) are the closest thing we have to statistics right now and that shows a consistent 45%/55% Alliance/Horde split on every PvP server, with some (including mine) having 40%/60%.  
---
PvE is a completely different story.

As someone who is about to order a new GPU. I'm waiting till AFTER classic's first 2 weeks to put it in. (Touching your PC before Classic launch is asking the gods for something to go wrong)

As someone who played vanilla from launch... i would play the shit outta bc
---
Well you’re wrong that warstomp is anywhere near as good as the orc stun resist and it has everything to do with Warlocks because that’s what the comment chain was about.

You need to reply in context and not just to the most recent comment you frigging gold fish.
---
its pst. So use your brain
---
Uhh, does it happen to be discrete mathematics?
---
And imp was overtuned being much tankier than vanilla.
---
I doubt it. There's too many people that never experienced classic (myself included) that I think will be too spoiled to all of our short-cuts and commodities in retail. There's a huge amount of hype right now, but I'm willing to bet a large amount dip after the first 2 or 3 weeks when the grind sets in, they don't have their pretty boa gear and mounts, they can't auto-pilot all the quests,  the world/dungeons can (and actually will) kill them, etc. etc. Classic is also slower-paced, especially starting out (I say this from my subjective experience in the stress test), and I think that once a lot of the people see the que times, or find out that auto attacks/ basic attacks actually exist, and you don't just faceroll, they'll be gone.
---
Never knew it was so fought for but I did spot it while searching on Thottbot for cool items to get. I tried probably to specifically go there to try to get it 4-5 times until I gave up.

---
Good. 44 here. We're both at an age where abrupt death would be surprising, but not THAT surprising. The bill for stupid shit like staying up all night, getting fat, never exercising and eating garbage always comes due, and it tends to be a lot higher than anyone expects.
---
You're just nuts.  (Guessing you haven't experienced enough life trauma... but don't worry, you'll get there.)  It's understandable.  Heady moments, this last day before...  Personally, I decided not to take any time off, but I seriously considered it.  Just be prepared for not being able to log on for hours.
---
I played back then as a 11-year old scrub, then I played on a private server for about 2 years and it was exactly the same.

You could also make an addon that whispers all the healing classes the current hp % of your hunter pet if it it is below 50% health, with absolutely no timer.

No need to worry , you can heal all dungeons even as a fully enh specced sham as long as you have a healing item set. Going points into resto makes it easier tho ofc

---
Yes, you need those first quests.  Good luck without them.
---
Reeeee
---
Were you using Vulkan to run things?  I wanna say retail moved to dx12 and you maybe had to tell it to run in dx11 mode for things to work, that could be what broke recently.  I'm just going off bits and pieces of information I've read over the last week or two though.  Lutris says platinum compatibility for WoW Classic and I'm going to hope it's correct on that!

Dont you make me get all misty eyed already. That quest chain and the little one :( now that I have little ones ita going to be so much worse.

if you say the word 'unironically' you are probably mentally challenged
---
I can't wait to see how many new servers they spawn in the first 30 minutes of the game launching.  Their numbers are based off people who have reserved a name, there's probably a ton of people who never bothered to even do that.
---
I believe Classic is going to be playing on far more advanced services and utilizing whatever modern networking and live patching / updating techniques that Blizz uses today for the Retail service. I don't think realm maintenance is even a thing on Tuesdays except for patch days.
---
So that kid's dad was living in a college dorm with electronics strewn about the room also?
---
In afraid I won’t have the same network I used to; that was one of the best parts. Not a big pug fan, going to have to make new friends I guess
---
Name reservations are up, not the game
---
I get that this meme is really - I'm not going to take WoW in moderation.
---
However for me this meme really hits home, because I'm actually not going to play WoW Classic at all. I completed everything there was to complete in Classic back in the day. Friends I played with have since moved on and one past on.
---
There will be no return to 18 year old me. Classic WoW will remain an adventure for the history books.
---
So just like Captain America, it's time to hang up the shield and enjoy the finer things in life, like Twitch!
---
How about that one video of the developers playing the game and reminiscing about it?
---
https://youtu.be/iquurVrL4l8?t=165
---
^^Though I can't demand the staff be diverse for the sake of diversity, and am grateful for all they have done, it's just the statistical case that the five middle age white guys are sitting around the table playing the game, until they pan to the shot of the developer team comprised of what looks like 20 white men, three Asians, and a single woman in the bottom-left of the frame. Sometimes, demographics don't neatly do what we would like them to. Sometimes, stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason. I *want* more women and LGBT folks joining my parties, but the odds seem likely that it's going to be straight white males for whatever reasons.
---
Skip to 6:21. Surprise, a dozen white dudes at a table again. Go to 4:20, where it shows the people camped out for the game, buying it, getting signatures on their box sets, and I'm not sure I can see a single non-white or non-Asian person, and it's majority white. Again, I do not desire this outcome, nor do I believe the wonderful team at Blizzard desired this outcome, but, culturally, there has to be a reason why this is the end result. I do not know what it is, but I can say I expect to have a guild of statistically 70% straight white men. Sigh...
---
This game wont be anything special, it will die in a month or so and we'll all be going back to Everquest
---
No but the servers are open for character creation. The enter world button is still grayed out though

You can only reserve you name.

You can't enter the 'world'

Get home from school, nap, go to driving lesson, get home, nap, login and try to get to the front of the queue. Hopefully I'll be able to go until about 12-13 hours after launch and the get a bit of sleep.

Yep. You can get a mouse with 12 extra buttons and bind them all.

I’m tempted , so tempted, except I am at work now and work another 12 he night tomorrow so I won’t have time before I sleep to wake up in time to stare at my queue number slowly count down. ;)

It's an excellent question.

Backstory:
---
I used to play undead warlock back then, focused a lot on pvp. But pet ai in wow drove me to hate pet classes, not just in wow but any game since involving ai. I hated having to buff and resummon on respawns.. So coming WotLK I replaced my warlock for good, with a tauren warrior, I didn't have to spend time with buffing myself before combat, I could charge into the fray. I loved it. However since TBC I also levelled a Paladin on the side, I loved healing as a Paladin, until cataclysm changed holy. But ret was still good and by the time of MoP it took over my warrior as main. It felt like a warrior but being able to selfheal was amazing and burst damage was good. I quickly got 2k+ rating on my Paladin back then, I even boosted people for gold. Until this day my Paladin is still my main, although I have been playing a lot less. Coming Legion I started doing more tanking, I enjoyed being tank. I still do. But holy is dead to me. I love the zealotry flavour of ret and sword and board holy knight flavour of prot. But still ret at heart.. by 5he time bfa 8.1 came, I had effectively quited wow. I had lost most of my friends whom I used to play and raid with, long before bfa. The only thing that kept me going through wod, legion and bfa was transmogs. I didn't have anyone to play with. I had no desire to prove myself to a new guild, no desire to take part of guild drama or inner cliches, I was done. Done with wow.. 
---
I still honor my old warlock main from vanilla. I didn't touch him since WotLK. I felt he was a done chapter of my life, I created new warlocks instead of playing my old one. And I refused to change his original realm when my friend group started realm transfer. He was born on Balnazzar, I will die on Balnazzar. As a last farewell I went to transmog to his old High Warlord gear some time later, from a time I fondly remember...
---
Now:
---
However.. I will not be playing warlock again, nothing can be as it once were.. This is a different day and age.. 
---
Back in the days I often envied rogues, melee in general. For being able to legitimately use a weapon rather than spells.. I used to envy stealth...
---
So this time around I will roll undead rogue. I will be focusing on pvp, and some of my old friends, including the one that introduced me to wow, will be playing as well.
---
But I'm in a inner struggle, because I have been playing a lot of FFXIV lately, and still do.. I really enjoy being healer and tank. So I kinda want to heal... FFXIV feels like a blast from the past, it feels like wow from back in tbc/wotlk, good times. Also the overall player mentality seems like how people used to behave and act.. It was quite a surprise... but FFXIV made me self-aware of how much I loved being able to help people, and that's something that has changed in me, I want to help others a lot more now, than back then. 
---
But I still want to be a rogue, pvp is my priority. 
---
And I will be looking forward to playing classic again, I miss my old home. 
---
Maybe I chase a dream, but I will chase it with gnome skulls once again in my bags.
---
Maybe for fresh pink flesh like you.  I need elaborate setups, son; leathered up coots like me got doornob chockers and car batteries littering the house...  /s
---
This is a strange explanation and doesn't really touch on the reason for layering from the user's perspective. In high pop servers there will be competition for resources (quest items, ore, etc) and layering helps to solve this problem and make the gaming experience smoother.
---
i would guess that a decent segment of the population doesn't realize how much they actually enjoy the QoL changes.
---
Devour magic? Doesent work on stuns last time i checked
---
Alliance
---
This must be from Shazzrah
---
You joke, but the Alliance Blue Game Fuel Mountain Dew had that exact effect.  That stuff must have been 50% food coloring.
---
Patchwerk lonely. . .
---
priest leveling is way smoother because they will never go oom as long they dont spam unnecessary spells and upgrade their wand a lot. rogue is pretty slow, and you'll be eating a lot.
---
17 inches
---
I agree, red = dead but when I see a 40 red and I am 36 - I am happy they didn't slaughter me lol
---
Oh no, I'd forgotten about that...
---
My experience playing horde is, that every single alliance player runs around with 2-3 other alliance players
---
so i'd be gang raped over and over again, when playing solo
---
STV took a while.
---
Only do it if you chain pull like a mad man but never take more than your healer can manage.
---
Best way to make gold? Get an alt and farm the secret spots.
---
While I feel for you, your single experience can't be projected onto whether or not this is over-prescribed.. I really do feel bad for you, but there's a good reason for all that yellow tape. I'm not saying there aren't people out there who genuinely need or massively benefit from it either.
---
Twitch app
---
Would be very painful, however you can shadow and still heal fine in dungeons
---
Made me think of this: https://youtu.be/Avp9aUkM5g0
---
You can definitely go do a smite build.
---
A little tip for priest leveling, though. All you really need is 5 points in wand spec in the disc tree and 5 points in spirit tap in the shadow tree and make sure to upgrade your wand regularly. Bubble/wand is the priest leveling bread and butter.
---
You can either drop all your combo points for that kick or trinket it. The lock can death coil into fear as well.
---
aren't they more subpouches than backpacks though - so id imagine they would be on your waist and mainbackpack.
---
Warcraft Molle Strapping...
---
Sure.  Pick wand spec up and wand everything to death.
---
Im gonna do any quest that comes in my path. Never played wow before so i wanna take it slow and enjoy the world.
---
taken :(
---
Now I want to be able to ride a tiny bear as a gnome
---
Just ignore and find another group at that point.
---
I think stabling reduces pet happiness, not dismissing. At max loyalty pets dont eat that much. When they die they get unhappy. It's not that bad.
---
Leveling a low level pet up is a pain in the dick though. I tamed Lupos at 60 on a private server and it was pretty annoying. Find something level appropriate to farm and get to grinding.
---
Why not gnomes?
---
Horde USED to be the minority. Then we slapped y'all around so much that y'all started join us.
---
Me too, I can easily function on 5 hours of sleep. The problem with it is I unnecessarily stress out about sleep, when I get to the 4-hour mark I start to think I am going to not be able to fall asleep and I won't be able to function at work or I will get in a car accident(this never has happened) but this stress will cause me to get like 1 or 2 hours of sleep. So...I start my sleep process(getting into bed) like 7-8 hours before I have to wake up to make sure I can definitely get to sleep before I start stressing about sleep.
---
If the statements by the Executive Producer and Chief Design engineer of WoW speaking in official capacity are not convincing enough for you, then by all means feel free to leave your mind vacated of facts.
---
Sorry, I thought the argument was certain addons existed in Vanilla.
---
So why exclude some and not others? Automatic decursing/cleansing was a thing for a long time in vanilla.
---
The manual is outdated AF. Dont bother
---
playing moonkin lol
---
That dude is just an uneducated newb, ignore him.
---
If you don’t you will be missing out on lots of fun and coolness..
---
The API was already different before this.
---
Alli has shitty PvE players on Retail because your best chances to join a halfway decent raiding guild are to play as Horde since their racials are ridiculous for PvE and now the recruitment pool is so large for Horde guilds that any top guild would be almost crazy (looking at you, Club Camel) to stick with Alliance.
---
Unfortunately it's just one of the many aspects of Retail WoW that sticks in my craw. During TBC / WOTLk you had faction imbalances, but there were still usually at least a few guilds of the minority faction on each server. Now it's all Alliance or all Horde on every server. Blizz could have easily fixed this issue before it snowballed, but now it will never be fixed even if they did something as radical as removing racials from the game, just because the Horde playerbase is so freaking huge.
---
You serious?  C'mon, man; horde, of course.   ;)

Right there with you Princess

I think its an extra addon

I am not laughing, serious. HAHAHAHA!

 I may end up doing this... could you go into some detail on why you think they are best?

awww
---
Tauren are typically cool guys... EXCEPT THE DRUID. Tauren druids are only Tauren because they have to be. They would roll an undead if they could. BEWARE.
---
I remember my last go to max lvl was in Pandaria. 
---
I was playing for around 22 hours, and almost got server first warrior, but some dude abused mob spawn and got 90 level faster.
---
I was so exhausted that and twitchy after 22 hours that I've to go to get nap, and dropped it on lvl 89 something.

Was fun though

I have "Okay" and "Deadly" on Stalagg. I have no longer have any intention of playing on that server, which is unfortunate, because I feel that these are pristine names.

I would probably be willing to trade for any decent name on Whitemane.

do you think you could do pve moonkin build?

Idk where my manual is now, but I know it's around somewhere. I oughta dig it up. It still has drawings in it from when my buddy and I were writing out our plans on what classes and races we would play. I think I was about 10. Good times.
---
It’s... complicated
---
Catsmilk,
---
There was a dwarf rogue named Catsmilk on my server back in the day and he had so many forum posts complaining about being ganked by him it literally made him legendary.
---
Probably killed me 200+ times between vanilla and tbc. Always ganking.
---
Okay here’s the plan, wait for your guild to have MC on farm, then decide to play and get all the loot easy
---
Wholesome
---
Herbalism and skinning for gold.
---
Played some heroes of might and magic 3 last night, killed some time

This vote is horde. We count these.
---
A reason to go to Darkshore as a Dwarf.
---
then don't use them. that's what would've happened during vanilla. no one would've cared if there were addons like these. you either use them or don't. blizzard didn't change their ui api to enforce some arbitrary vision of something everyone has their own thoughts on.
---
addon authors improved over the years. now we have things like elvui and weakauras which both make their way into classic. boss mods will certainly be there in all their glory as well. not that anyone would need them. there will be other addons that didn't exist during vanilla. fact is, classic is not vanilla. there are changes. there will be new changes that are created organically as the game becomes available to everyone.
---
i mean, look at this whole debate. that wouldn't have happened 15 years ago. i don't get it honestly. i highly doubt this vocal group of people here are the same people that played the game back then.
---
As a horde only player since vanilla I miss when the horde wasn't so popular. Take your dummies back please.
---
Well I wish the best of luck to you leveling on Monday and I hope everything goes copacetic for you :)
---
its funny how your quote doesnt apply to the addon in question as it could invite players who were looking for group in the chat. in other words, it doesnt rely on other players using the addon. and its still dumb to say "its a stupid fight to pick" when theyre only looking to have a genuine discussion with them to reasonably come to an agreement.
---
Careful you might start a grease fire
---
This is perfect. 
---
The vocal minority of Horde are the schezwan sauce of WoW. There's this weird faux pride in being part of a faction on this subreddit. 
---
As soon as the game launches you are just another solo player quietly questing around Azeroth, let's not pretend you're humble defender of Orgrimmar slaying Alliance scum in honor of the Horde.
---
Seems stupid overkill, we used to 3 man runs for crusader mats in vanilla 1 mage, 1 warrior dps/tank, 1 Holy pally. I would slam some mage in their for stupid strong aoe.
---
Hunters did 9/11, but don't tell anyone
---
Please make me one with a murlock :D &lt;3
---
People didn't think it would happen that you would ask for classic 5 years ago?  How, who, why... oh, nevermind...
---
Either it crashes or it doesn't, 50% chance
---
i will subscribe 1 day before release and create a character on the new realms. i mean, dont you lose days if you pay for subscription 1-2 weeks before it launches, just to reserve a nickname?
---
Meanwhile there are people going for 1-60 in 2 sessions I think. You can do 1-60 in 3.5 days played and they only plan to sleep 6hrs in there once.

Fellow Keto-friend here. Ketogenisis definitely doesn't take 2-3 months to kick in if you're under your carb limit (mine was 25g), not sure where the fella above you got that info.
---
-16kg in 6 weeks, Keto is awesome. Very disciplined but it has great results. glhf in classic :)

Horde do the same thing. After any gamer gets yanked a few times rolling in groups is just the smart thing to do. Especially in STV with so many elite quests and kill quests.
---
It began with the forging of the great mouses. Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and bounciest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of Ironforge. And nine, nice mouses were given to the race of men, who above all else desire to spec Fury. For within these mouses were bound the macros and hotkeys to govern each class. 
---
But they were all of them deceived, for another mouse was forged, a master mouse!
---
One mouse to rule the all, one mouse to find them. One mouse to bring them all and on the side buttons bind them.

I've really gotten under your skin haven't I? You seem pretty insecure for a guy who knows it all. Please keep responding to me, and please, please continue with the ....'s. They really do it for me.
---
I'll be playing alone, tbh I prefer it that way, now I can just play on whichever server/faction I want, back in the day I was always at the mercy of whatever server/faction friends wanted to play. They always wanted alliance or pve or some dead server for some reason (I always wanted horde, pvp, a full server, though now I prefer alliance). Also they ALWAYS lost interest and quit the game before me.
---
I wish my brother wanted to play though, he played with me back in the day, but he just doesn't care about MMOs anymore.
---
Gotta learn their IRL name, and exchange more then battlenet info to make them an out of wow friend as well!
---
See you on launch day.
---
There is a meta post at the top of the subreddit.
---
I am much the same as you, but now as a 32 year old that hasn’t touched wow since wotlk; I’m so excited. 
---
My focus used to be raid bosses. I participated in a competitive raid guild in TBC playing a shadow priest; hitting dps numbers with the best in the world.
---
And a humbly, exceptional restoration Druid in vanilla that was in AQ40 when TBC released.
---
My focus for classic is mostly to just have fun leveling and doing basic dungeons, my life can’t really accommodate the way I used to play. But fuck, nostalgia is a good drug. You should just try casually leveling and reliving the old quests.
---
on the right side, look for community options, click the dropdown arrow to open them up.

Just add water between sodas and you’ll be fine.

But genuinely be careful with that much of it.

This is good advice, I use shift scroll though, I use this for blowing cool downs and trinkets most of the time.
---
yeah i thouht that was the situation. Possibly they meant Culturally Enlgish servers? so like UK centric?
---
Contact support. That's what they're there for.
---
No the didn’t think blizzard would ever release a classic server, because it would be to difficult.
---
To be fair, if the player distribution is anything like it seems on here, the low effort on PvP will apply to effort getting through PvP queues as well...

It's a fucking meme you dolt
---
Especially in original release. Alliance vastly outnumbered horde. No one really understood how OP Will or orc stun resist was. That came later. Original pop number were heavily skewed to the "good guys"
---
I feel your struggle.
---
If it's fresh and brand new account ? Yeah just redo it but do it right this time
---
watch yer back
---
Aww man, I'd love to follow this guide but all my friends want to go alliance 😔
---
Just roll a ret paladin, that way if you do less damage than the healers its expected behaviour.
---
It's not, because as a prot you will not be able to hold aggro against three warriors cleaving with windfury.
---
Also you can't spend your rage as well. When I 2hand tanked dungeons like ZF, I did generally 45% of the groups DPS. Having the tank not go 2hand arms spec is a waste of that sweet rage you can spend on sweeping strikes and whirlwinds.
---
Blizzard has live support on their website pretty fast too.
---
Well, it starts with a brain injury.  Then get a traffic cone and lube it up... you know, they got youtube videos for this sh\*t...
---
Those are the ones used in Retail

Contact support, there are no automated responses. You can either call, live chat or submit a ticket.
---
My point exactly. You don't need LFG if u just network properly, which is a lot more fun anyway.
---
A lot changed by 1.12.  One of the things they changed was adding scaling to eviscerate, so that naked rogues could no longer beat terrible warriors who can't press overpower, as seen in *World of Roguecraft*.  It was a buff (and a desperately needed one) to geared rogues, however.  
---
Almost everything World of Roguecraft bitched about was lies.
---
I tried to find a picture of it with a quick Google image search so I didn't have to show off my wrinkled one, but damn if I couldn't find a single image. Not sure it's actually uncommon but they don't seem to show up online.

This advert in PC Gamer was the first thing that got me to check out the game.

Is the money a class trait? If not, please stay on subject laid out by OP.

no, just the ones listed in the link someone else posted

---
I think both would be interesting, rouge seems a little more challenging at higher levels with the different poisons and what-not, but I do enjoy that kind of playstyle, it keeps it interesting. While on the priest side I like being useful and I hear they can be fun in PvP.
---
nothing to be proud of and smiling at.
---
Half the time it just gets dispelled in PvP (purge, dispel, fel hunter eat buff thing).  In PVE ya it’s nice but a decent tank and stance dance with little/no issue. Play the race you want you’ll have to look at it for a long time.
---
oh yea allimania is great man.
---
I didn't even know there were east and west coast servers when i created my place-holder characters. thanks
---
Its fairly rare for him but i guess his guild understands the reality of it when hes tanking. His house doesnt get many runs at all.
---
This is like some writing on the wall in a jail cell
---
Congrats you are now oom
---
My same reaction, I was in my 20ies when I started in classic
---
I have debilitating adhd that was undiagnosed back when WoW came out. I’m now 31 and medicated to the point that I can finally enjoy the game. I used to get bored and unfocused so bad that I would restart every time I hit 30-40. It was actually pretty nuts looking back because medicated me actually loves the MMO grind now
---
Don't see how it could. I actually think it would do the opposite.
---
Why did the boats move inland, in retail wow?
---
thanks man great work.
---
eh i don't know about you but i prefer the guy paying taxes rather than the man-child living off welfare grinding wow 'vanilla' for 5 years+ in his moms basement already.   
---
if you think it's the same thing you are being dishonest or delusional, take your pick.
---
Hey kid, scroll down.
---
Thank you :) I don't know anything about 3D printing yet :)
---
Just play what you want, man. It's not a big deal.
---
play horde then no one can give you crap for not going fear ward
---
You normally put in on the healers because yeah - warriors dun care about fear.
---
Please don’t kill yourself
---

Yes, you really get to me. So much in fact that I stalked your post history and invented a fabricated reality about your life, oh wait, that was you.

I will continue to respond to you, with the exact same thing. You are a sad little boy, who does little more than attempt to get a rise out of people so you can say some form of the popular kid phrase "you mad bro".

Shadow priest can be scary in pvp, but raiding wise, you'll have trouble getting that one shadow priest slot. You'll likely be expected to heal. If you do go heals then everyone will want you.
---
I don't care much either way, I'm just wondering if I wouldn't get frustrated every time I get feared, knowing that if only I had rolled a dwarf the fear would be gone.
---
I have like 3 irl friends I’ll be playing with horde on bigglesworth. Feel free to PM me if you want to hang bro

If the tank doesn't need it you give it to a dps so they can just eat a fear and keep killing da boss

You're probably doing it on a RP server I guess?

There are actually some very good female dwarf models. Ite not an big deal

What are you on about? He was replying to the comment above that said "if you plan on pvping you should always pick orc" and suggested that tauren is also a good choice for pvp due to war stomp. And you are telling others to learn to read..

No releasing made no resurrections work iirc. The worst was if you did what op said but got a lot further away and told the healer not to release just to get to them and have them not work still. There was always a chance they didn’t work btw (like most classic engin items)

All of us.

I’m making a night elf priest. Normally I’d make a human but I’ve done human so much on retail. And I really like the aesthetic of night elf priest. Also I’m gonna be on a pvp server, so the night elf passive will make for some extremely fun mind control shenanigans. The idea of going for 100% efficiency over what you find aesthetically pleasing is clearly bothering you. It won’t stop either. If you roll a dwarf you will end up hating your character. You really think you’re gonna get that big of a dopamine hit every time you hit someone with a fear ward? Compare that to every nagging second you stare at your ugly dwarf while leveling wishing it was a more attractive human or night elf. The choice is obvious.

Female Troll have 1 cute face out of the 4 choices. The other 3 make them look hideous, which some people like, but the one cute face is actually very tolerable! Has helped me enjoy Trolls more when I choose to roll them over the Undead.
---
Solution - Go horde, much more balanced racials where you don't feel forced into a certain race for the most part.
---
And viper sting. Fucking viper sting.
---
You can always go dwarf, suck it up for awhile until you can farm Deviate fish to change you into a human
---
Yes will upload it &lt;3 gonnareply again once im done

But what does that card do?

Thoroughly loved my old orc. Totally great. Nothing beats undead caster animations though.

Is it safe to presume most people have created 2-3 characters for name sake? So the active pop should be a lot less

I can't help you, but if you don't find it, that photo of it in the book is pretty striking in its own right. Maybe retake it in different lighting for less glare, and use that as your backdrop or whatever?

I think it has more to do with the fact that Blizz hasn't been able to write a decent story for the alliance since wrath. I quit the game before going horde.

I mean, that will definitely happen if you don't have fear ward, can be frustrating, you can always go undead priest though ! :)

That's me in a nutshell. I began my WoW journey at almost age 5 alongside my parents, one of which is no longer alive. I thought WoW was so cool graphics-wise, as I had come straight from my parents' old Nintendo 64, on which I played Super Mario 64 and Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as early as age 3. Now, my little stepbrother is six years old, and I am 19. Yesterday morning, I sang the chorus of M.A.G.E. to him.

I know 6 other people who have had the same issues. There’s also a stigma around stimulants which perpetuates false facts.

Genuine question how do people manage without a laptop or pc. Not even just gaming but word processing, browsing  web, emails, netflix etc. Seen a few threads like this and it blows my mind people dont have computers in current year!
---
I like having a bank toon so no one knows if I (my main) undercut them or if I am posting a BoE that I needed on.
---
Thank you! btw for the Horde!
---
This has got to be the dumbest shit I’ve read all day.
---
I agree that they know how it works. But if you, for example, break the addon ability to read chats it doesnt only affect lfgaddon. It will have an effect on all of the addons that use chat. So while erasing the invite function will have a smaller effect, doing something drastic will have drastic effects. For example say the dps meters reads the combat log. If addons cant read chats anymore you break the lfg but you also break the dps meters.
---
Now Im not likely to use the lfg addon myself, but I think people fail to see that it is not just a "disable one addon" situation. Addons function within rules set by blizzard and changing a rule has effects on all and not just one.
---
No need to project your own ignorance here, reading blue posts isn't very hard.
---
You're just reconfirming what we already know.
---
The answer is very clear. If nothing is said you roll on items that can be used by the role you are currently filling, but if you make it very clear when you are invited or when the group is beginning that you are filling a role that is not your norm, then you can roll on both the role you claimed and the one you are filling.
---
If the group has a problem with this they can remove you.
---
Drink this instead, your body will thank you later.

Dude, just roll and ugly male dwarf.  Problem solved.

This is a bad idea.  
---
If you get hot pockets, you need to walk away from the game to make them.  Just get ready to eat food, or make food that can be stored cold and eaten right away.
---
I'm sure you didn't borrow the read the reply from the developer of the add-on. No need to project your own ignorance here.
---
You already know how it's gonna go.
---
The seed is planted. You're gonna be checking this sub every now and then. You'll be reading the discord and seeing your friends have a good time.
---
Then, the innocent thought will creep into your mind: Just sub for a month, see Elwynn/Barrens one more time, kill Hogger, have some laughs and reminisce.
---
The next thing you know, you're 60, farming Un'goro devilsaur leather and dreamfoil, you haven't slept in 30 hours, your work is calling to see when you'll get better from this mystery flu you've caught, your PS4 gathering more dust than usual in the corner, and all the while you're planning your gearing route to get to raiding and to start the grind towards rank 14.
---
There is no escape. Give in to your feelings. You know it to be true.
---
Neither European Portuguese or Brazilian Portuguese spell their laughs as "jajaja" btw. The Europeans opt for "ahahaha", "hihihi", or "kkkkkkk". Brazilians opt for "huehue" or "kkkkkkkk". 
---
In my experience it's usually "kkkkkkk"
---
Me too. None of my friends want to play WoW again, I don’t care that much. During the levelling experience you get to meet people and also the likelihood of gaming with my friends at the same time and also to level at the same pace is very low.
---
yikes
---
Plebs choose human, advanced players choose dwarf, hardcore players choose human. It's similar to Will of the Forsaken, which is only useful if you're already not using all the consumables. If you play hardcore, fears will be a joke tier mechanic in bosses and a spirit buff 100% of your gameplay is hundreds of times more powerful than fear ward.
---
Even as a 16-18 warrior you can pull a few of them, LOS them at one of the buildings(I suggest the Blacksmith as you run less risk of random re spawns) while Rend does it's work.
---
This will pass when you grow up, as adults usually learn to control emotions, which is difficult when you’re young due to biochemical reasons. But yes, Classic is coming.
---
Had the same thing. Added an Authenticator to my account and the lock was automatically lifted.
---
Human or gnome. What did you think its cloth.
---
It probably won't, not sure how paths work in Linux but I didn't program file paths to be platform agnostic.  Think I'll do that in the future for Mac and Linux support
---
Yeah you can heal dungeons as shadow until the mid 50s level I think.
---
The heat was the thing I was concerned most about since I know laptops have a tendency to overheat and bottleneck, but if a fan mount does the trick that's great. I'm hoping to be able to pick up my laptop and take it to Uni, bring it back at the end of the day, plug it back in and use as my desktop.
---
Fortnite can be surprisingly demanding, at least more-so than the games I tend to play regularly, so that's good to know. 
---
Thank you :D
---
horde raids and they dont have fear ward.
---
This is.. VERY nice!! :D Well done &lt;3
---
No, and anyone who would frown on it is a fool IMO. No one gets pissy with warriors rolling on 2Hers when they’re tanking, so the same should be true for healers.
---
(Note this becomes less true in the mid to upper 50s when people should be locking in their desired spec)
---
Have to get it from the launcher. Sub, then download. That simple. Your fault for trying to wait until last minute
---
Thanks for doing this mate.  I hope that with layering traditional questing will be feasible, but in the likely case that it’s not, this looks like a stellar backup plan.
---
Doubtful. This is not 50% of all players missing. It's 50% of the people hardcore enough to fill out the survey. So its likely 50% of a very small number compared to the amount of retail players that reserved a name just because they could
---
I'll be going it alone as well, just like irl!
---
Another thing with this is that back then in vanilla, we didn't know about those racials when creating a character and only made what we liked. Especially those ones since they're not mentioned in the character creation screen.
---
But now classic is cursed with knowledge, and there's a lot of community pressure to optimise everything
---
Remember, a raid of 40 don’t need all dwarf priests. They need a couple. The rest will be human priests for their increased spirit generation which makes them perform better than the dwarf. Just not utility wise.
---
Though go as you please. If someone commands you to change race because they’re ‘pushing’ you don’t need to be apart of that community anymore.
---
I'll be gentle.  I promise.  Probably.  (For the horde.)
---
I don’t do any type of work where I have to use spreadsheets or anything like that email is just basic for maybe when I sign up to something and to follow thru Netflix stuff like that on PS4 or the firetv or phone pretty much everything on phone slight web browsing and YouTube red used to listen to podcast

Can confirm a lot of Norwegians and Danes went to Firemaw
---
One horde is called a Hor for short.
---
^(/s don't fact check me)
---
I mean it still matters. Some queues will be longer than others
---
not when leveling, at lvl 60 you should let them know at the start
---
Your monitor is called AW3418DW btw, or HW if its just the 1080p version
---
Do you PVP?  Shadowmeld is fantastic for ganking people / mind controlling people off of things.  It's just like a million times more fun than preventing a fear.
---
I'm sorry you feel that way.
---
You don’t really chose a type. You just use whatever the best you find is.
---
You're right. I'm also nearing being a 40 year old virgin and my entire life is a lie. Thanks for calling me out, you've really set me straight here.

Not sure where to ask this but is there a Wow Classic European server recruitment forum? I'm EU-English which limits my choices to three servers but I know nothing about those three.
---
Can anyone point me to where to go? (On mobile so I've tried googling a bit but it's kinda rough searching)
---
Ask if the DPS minds. If they don't, then roll with them. If they do mind, don't. But then you get the dibs on healer gear.
---
If are in a dps role and there is another healer, def go for it.
---
So basically i have to download retail wow in order to play classic?
---
Use Feint!
---
Download battle.net launcher.  Click the wow tab and hit the dropdown and select classic.
---
Do you just make these for lock? Or any other classes?
---
Don’t really know any of them yet joined a few days ago , my usual gaming guilds only has like 3 people planning to play classic .
---
honestly i think it's a lot higher than that. Pure speculation, but the hardcore audience is less than 50% of the population, and some of the hardcore people aren't even subbing early, so.. do the napkin math
---
2-3 hours 6 out of 7 days is excessive
---
More like "xDublolasx". Everything else is already taken.
---
Battlenet launcher. Subscribe. Choose classic wow under "Version".
---
Rephrased the question. Wasnt sure how to put it to be clear :)
---
No no. I’m the battle net launcher there’s a drop down for wow classic and to install that. Do you have to sub to play classic? Yes. But you don’t have to download the retail game.
---
You don't NEED a leveling guide. Those are just if you want to level optimally. For example one of the top guides says not to do dungeons while leveling which is kinda boring in my view.
---
Although I am obviously younger than you, I can confirm that maturity helped me as well. I joined a decent social guild at age 13, and they didn't know my age until I told them three years later at age 16. My guild leader was impressed by my maturity in an online setting. Now I raid the BfA raids with them at age 19, and although I am the youngest raider, I am loyal and care more about mechanics than my DPS, because a dead DPS does no DPS.
---
No, if you click on wow in battle.net launcher Theres a drop down Menu, you can choose to install Retail or classic.
---
Don’t forget 11pm for the UK!
---
Ofc staff is a valid option... why wouldn't it be?
---
What other options will you have? Sword... dagger... staff. Whatever you find, use it. It's not like you need to build up your weapon skill with it.
---
Thought so too, but actually this is used in retail speedruns and blizzard doesn't mind it at all. So i don't see why there would be a diffrence in classic regarding it since it's same TOS.
---
 Please make a +25 year old server Blizzard 😲😲😲

I was messaging by best wow buddy from vanilla. Sent him the classic trailer and tried to hype him for endless gaming nights and feeling like back in the days. He was the one that let me play on his account at first. Sadly he replied he even doesn't have a working computer and how I could dump so much time to a decade old game. Pfft. So yea, start off alone it is. I feel ok about that cuz while playing I *might* meet people interested in playing.

If it was anyone in my family they would downvote. After I had a monopoly on wheat that one time nobody trusts me.
---
If there isn't one, just make it :)
---
People probably not deleting characters.
---
Thanks brother! I am gonna go sleep forever then play classic =D
---
Using only "one button" is an exaggeration often brought forward by people who generally dislike a class anyway. No class only uses one button. On the other hand, if you play a caster class there is obviously always that one spell which has the best equation of damage/mana cost and if it is your goal to farm with drinking the least and still making the most damage then you would probably only use that one button. But that is theory. Monster also cast spells on you which poison you (=cast cure poison), monster run away and can be slowed effectively (=frost shock), they are standing in groups (=chain lightning), they cast spells and can be interruped (=earth shock (level 1?)).. etc.
---
And then, you obviously would not want to exclude totems from your calculation because they are VERY powerful and fun.
---
Maybe you want to look at this guide here because it details the most common spells: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/elemental-shaman-dps-rotation-abilities-classic-wow
---
Hope this helped.
---
Does maybe not mean “might” to you or something?
---
I added marked maps to this so I can quickly check npc locations within ironforge and stormwind. Unfortunately the maps don't have great resolution but I tired to sharpen them up a bit.

It’s perfectly fine. I’ve gone into several xpacs alone and met tons of people with grouping and raiding. I’m an introvert, and it would take serious effort on my part NOT to make friends in this game.
---
Yeah but if he was hooked who would be there to get snacks and cook meals?
---
As far as i know you dont need a sub to download it.
---
Let’s be honest here, they could have skipped making small or medium and had few issues..
---
ok, guys, how simple can you be? ITS A !&amp;$%ING TOPIC ABOUT STAFF USERS, if your not a staff user, GET YOUR ASS OUT!!!!!!!! Jesus!!!!
---
I guess “maybe” isn’t in your vocabulary..
---
Its waaaaaaay to early to be thinking of classsic+ already. 
---
But since we are talking about it, I think it would be kinda cool to add dyes to the game to change some of the ugly armour colors, and it wouldn't effect the game much at all but would be a fun/cool feature.
---
You clearly were not on the early internet.  It changed.  A lot.
---
Don’t most retail stores have 15-30 day returns on electronics? Buy one and return later.
---
I've just seen this for the first time. Idk how I could've missed this crazy fun piece before :)
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
What zone would you say this is supposed to be?
---
Spec'd into it in the hidden talent tree.
---
Classic is nothing like retail when it comes to specs, you'll still get all your holy abilities. It'll just make your Shadow abilities be better for solo leveling.
---
This might actually be cool. I'm interested in doing pvp yeah.
---
Also want that tiger mount.
---
You make it clear what your loot goals are at the begin (before you begin)
---
+ If you were there (in the group first) and they say no, you kick them
---
+ If you're last to the group (and they say no) you leave.
---
It's essentially the 'terms of your contract', and you can be sure as hell that finding someone who's willing to (and capable of) healing is a lot harder than someone who can deal damage. Your time is just as valuable as their time.
---
Aahh, I see you are a man of culture as well!
---
So no server then?
---
Thankfully during the long beta they manage to catch a lot of bugs (also called expansions) but it's now all fixed.
---
Yep for the most part. I've got a couple people from work that are going to play but they want to be Horde and on a PvE server (but I want to be Alliance on a PvP) so I won't be playing with them at least as my main characters. Maybe I'll make an alt to play with them later. A couple friends of mine I used to play WoW with have no interest in Classic as they think it looks dated and have no interest in the grind. So it'll basically just be me for a while :( Kinda sucks, I wish they'd join in too but whatever I guess. I'll just make friends as I go through the world /shrug.
---
Gonna snort like crazy while leveling warrior, my mental might pop, but at least i won't be lost
---
Tip of the hat mlady
---
Classic’s way to assemble gear randomly due to transmog absence makes you look like a superhero.
---
By the levels of toxicity within the community I think it's safe to say that most of them are though, probably in their early twenties.
---
You thought you do and you did
---
here is what i think they could do and would probably work. make tbc and wotlk after classic, obviously. once lich king is dead and player numbers drop, start a new season. make a season last 1 year or so. full cycle, classic to wotlk. end of season people can transfer their character with all the "old school stuff" plus achivments to retail wow, obviously for a big amount of money.
---
M'lady
---
Get a sub and see what happens.
---
Smite spec could look something like this
---
https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=priest&amp;t=vjvkvlvmvnwlwPwQwRwSvQv0v1v2v3C8C9C_C.C~wgvRwXwYvUvVv7IVIWvXvTv_v.v~v-v5v6vrvvvqvwvxvtwpwAwjwHwIwZw1
---
The important talents are divine fury and searing light alongside wand spec and spirit tap.
---
Maybe if the Alliance would be more active in PVP then that wouldn't happen.
---
Blizzard had to bribe the Alliance players on Retail to activate their war mode ffs.
---
Always keep the flute boys
---
No worries, mate. If you stick to Gehennas I'll wade through the meter high meatballs and terrible furniture with you to get to the AH.
---
Word of warning, if you have an addictive personality then set up some rules for when and how you play, else it can swallow you.
---
You called?
---
Why sub early ? Its a scam.
---
It works. I used it in the last stress test.
---
Australians will represent large on Oceanic servers, so there will be English speaking guilds.
---
Rogue. **Rogue** *rogue* [rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouge).
---
Stop spelling it rouge you mongoloid.
---
Just curious, what is so valuable from DS/Ruin compared to this spec that would make it better? Suppression? Destructive Reach? Imp Life Tap? I mean, I can always just sac my pet at anytime and get that extra 5% damage, this just seems more useful until you have better gear to support yourself
---
Cope
---
/r/2007scape is the best game subreddit because of the memes.
---
FUCK. Thanks for the idea. I’m using my big ass tv as a monitor for launch.
---
Level as combat. It's still good in PvP until later levels
---
My brothers account is not subbed and doesn’t have the option. So I think you have to be subbed
---
well horde has a anti fear totem \^\^, that is their fear ward.   
---
just play what you find the most attractive, if you spend 100 of hours into 1 character.
---
100% true
---
I hope Barrens chat is as lit as it use to be.
---
Yeah, that was the meaning 
---
Blizz has closed the full Servers, and I cant join to my friends who want to keep their name. just because I dont want to buy game time before start
---
This is fun but it doesn't make a lot of sense
---
Nobody cares wether you're a guy or a girl. You're putting yourself on a pedestal.
---
Perfect, thanks for the confirmation.
---
Streamers telling their grandkids about the Ooga gang.

That’s awesome! Could you make one for dual monitors? 3840x1080

I sell Searing Pain and Searing Pain accessories.
---
You won't be able to backstab much while soloing. I'd just go combat, and put on crippling/mind numbing poisons when you're out and about PvPing
---
We’re going home!
---
Well the comments in this thread so far are toxic as expected.
---
And most probably are, but let's say you have only 20% women, that's still one out of five people you play with. Which would mean one person per dungeon group.
---
Even if it's less than that, it's not negligible.
---
This is fucking amazing and I play undead priest. Marry me so I may admire your art.
---
gotta love people who think they know the future. 'likely' 'will happen',  i think you are pretty delluded in the accuracy of your opinions my friend. and circlejerking reddit upvotes it, just like drones in a hive.  
---
now give me that negative karma :)
---
I played combat on a pvp private server and it didnt disappoint in pvp. You get a better chance against warriors and other rogues and still can take down clothies fairly easy. Plus it is the best for pve. Keep up with getting the best slow main hand weapons and you are good to go.
---
I think there is some truth to what you're saying but it's impossible to know.  Plus we have no idea how many people have rerolled servers.  Like what if  90% of the early arrives to Herod have already left because of high pop? We would never know
---
Cancel your current download?

My wallpaper has been the Horde one for a few days, now It's going to be this one for quite a while, it's awesome.

 It always bothered me how incorrect it was... Everything is literally wrong!
---
I had the same problem. Completely uninstalled battle net. Reinstalled. Opted for the “beta” version of battle net patches. It was in battle net settings.
---
If you wanted attention, why didn’t you just call your mom or something
---
I would say so different, because what you gonna farm rep for? unless you go disentchant , there is not much rep to grind for.
---
I'm on keto, so I eat a lot of whole natural foods. And I do kettlebell swings at natural pausing points when I play video games.
---
&gt;Water. This is what you drink. This is the only thing that you drink except for special occasions.
---
And gatorade, if you're like me and you have a dietary deficiency of sodium.
---
I’d say there’s a very high chance of the login server getting destroyed
---
This is correct.
---
are they readily bought or did you make it on your own and add it into bottles. Because I wanna know how to get bottles like those that aren’t glass :P
---
Im already married with Classic duh &lt;3
---
No, you're just dumb for expecting people to identify people's genders without anything to go off of.
---
&gt;My supplies are avocado, eggs, turkey jerky, almonds, and some sugar free protein shakes.
---
Are you keto?
---
I don't need attention from toxic guys like you, thank you very much.
---
I just have a script do that when I boot up my gold-farming bots.
---
PS: GET THE CIA OUT OF HONG KONG!!!
---

---
That's hilarious, even I'm not sure its meant to be
---
I love this gnome and his stupid hair
---
If your feelings are hurt because some misgenders you on a forum then WoW might not be for you. Not trying to be a dick, just letting you know that that will be the least "toxic" thing youll see in WoW.
---
Did you just assume their gender!?
---
Hence what I said ^
---
Thanks for the reply, do you know of the meta combat leveling build for talents ?
---
I believe 5.36 represents the level you will be roughly when you have completed all the tasks on the first page, as you see when you press the right arrow to get the next page, it will give you the next list of tasks, and the rough level you will be upon completion (for human its 5.6)
---
Lol I mean I subbed just to keep up on things. Let's be honest, it's been a while since there was a lot of positivity around the game that hasn't fallen on its face. With classic wow there are no surprise letdowns coming so itll be interesting to see how this plays out long term. Not gonna lie, and I touched on this in another reply - but i am rooting for this to succeed. I missed wrath entirely so if wotlk gets classic wow treatment I am all over that day 1.  
---
Some people on here can't seem to wrap their heads around the fact that I am not missing out on anything by skipping this re-release. Been there done that but wish them all well. I want classic to thrive, more than anything to convince blizz/Activision to make servers for other editions. Because we all have different timelines and mine made me miss a real high point for the game that in sure others playing classic would be able to relate to my stance when that day comes.
---
I'll live vicariously through you guys right here until that time comes. Until then, it's your azeroth.
---
He sacrificed his entire career for classic. What have you given ?
---
People who say this shit clearly never played Vanilla. Most people didn’t give any shit as to what guilds were doing what on a server. I knew guilds progressing through MC while other guilds were progressing through AQ40 and they were equally excited for their individual progress. There are no catchup mechanics in Vanilla. New players forming new guilds have to tackle the ladder, and they only care about getting GUILD firsts, not server/region/world firsts. 
---
TLDR; no one fucking cares
---
I call my dog dude almost every time. Dude is not a binary gender term, and transcends even species barriers... Not really seeing the issue.
---
I want the gnomes, after dealing with them for years I can finally shut up the males.
---
&gt;Keto has nothing on proper carbohydrates when it comes to heavy lifting and strenuous sports.
---
Can you clarify this?
---
Literally almost every server is heavy or full. The few left that are mediums are expect to have moderate queues as well. May as well just wait.
---
Humans do more dmg though ;)
---
It's sort of cute that you believe there could be any sort of fairness or normalcy to world PvP whilst leveling on a PvP server.
---
It won't make a difference, but keep in mind that if you're planning on using 'Sap' at all during a dungeon you pretty much need to land it first (before any other CC lands) and you need to watch other players (e.g. Mage casting Polymorph) to time when you use Sap. Even if you had 3/3 imp sap it's not a reliable crowd control (10% chance you'll get de-stealth) which can cause all sorts of crazy shenanigans depending on your positioning and whether your party was paying attention.
---
I didn't ask people to guess our gender, I pointed out that not everyone playing is a guy and there might be a surprising amount of women.
---
Besides, characters have a gender. I know a lot of guys create female characters but technically if someone has a female character and name there's a decent chance they might actually not be a guy.
---
That's not my experience. i did play alliance MOST of my time in vanilla. granted i played a rogue at launch, so i  could always escape...
---
O cool I can see my character :p
---
This guy doesn't exist.
---
Your friends will probably change their tune once they realize they have to wait until Wednesday to login.
---
Fuck ok, was chatting with my friend yesterday about how ready we are
---
And he asks me what professions I'm gonna go
---
I'm like "haha yeah"
---
"What"
---
So, any recommendations for a tauren druid? How is leatherworking in classic? Otherwise I think I'm gonna go mining/engineering tbh
---
Thinking of getting mine framed. Just not sure how to do it. I want to display the box as well, and it would be neat to be able to open the front cover and see the fold-out bit. 
---
Or I just have to cut out the parts I want from the box and put them in the frame. But that feels kinda blasphemous.
---
Lol pr guy who was shit at pr
---
/Thread he deserves to be forgotten.
---
Everyone online is a dude until it's proven a woman. Stop fucking tilting. No offense, just get it together ☺️👌
---
I got my new job recently and it starts on exactly the same day as Classicwow releases. F*ck my life
---
Theres also the strategy of just questing to your first wand reward. There's a good chance it won't be that much slower than putting all your time into other strategies. I'm not gonna overthink it and just play.
---
you know what is pvp video?
---
cant wait te be that guy again!
---
I think it's a man gone woman , that's why the balls are so big

It's just a thing people say. Like calling someone "bro" or "chief". Not sure why you'd get offended over such a silly thing

The personal satisfaction of getting exalted on everything? There’s no achievements, but personal goals are still important.

Awesome thanks! I'm planning to play a mage but have friends playing both these classes so will pass on the links

Really? I thought it was the 27th since that's been advertised O_O
---
He's not wrong
---
Alright man.
---
No, this is 100% dude being dumb.
---
Andrew Luck just announced his retirement in the NFL after a preseason loss.  Citing his injuries and that he's been playing in pain since 2016.
---
But the timing is just before classic releases.  So a meme was born of it yes.
---
I've created 3 characters, but wanted to make another to hold names, and it said I've reached the maximum. Is there a reason for that?
---
Four years have passed since the mortal races banded together and stood united against the might of the Burning Legion...
---
Leveling is a free fire zone.
---
Yeah all my friends are casual scum or horde traitors I have to go alone :(
---
Literally unplayable
---
But it's got the wrong symbol on it
---
Mountain Dew!?! Bleh! I’ll take an almond milk.....
---
You probably got benched lmao
---
Cranius had some nice videos and songs also, [Don't make me get my main](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR7FC-h0Fb8)
---
I always hated that in Classic. Then Legion came and gave me a neat reasoning why I suck at herbalism sometimes. Each plant has its own quirks, where to hold them, how to pluck them and so on so that they keep their magical properties for the brews and potions we make.
---
That was a vanilla server. Back in it's heyday they had great horde battleground premades. Many battles with that server. Some really epic ones.
---
dont spend your money to "see if it activates". none of my accounts are subbed and i was still able to download the client. Im NA though, it may just be a glitch. Wait for blizz response
---
You’ve got time, go buy another monitor haha
---
Nope, Monday 11pm. 
---
It launches in 1day 13hours time (roughly).
---
3 name reservations is maximum.

Hey, if you're down to join us on Fairbanks, we're planning on using the Melee Cleaving dungeon leveling strat. We expect to be 60 in around 4 days played.   
---
Shoot me a dm!

You can only create 3 characters to hold names.
---
*takes peek*..........facts
---
Play warlock man. They are so freaking sweet.
---
[Ready](https://i.redd.it/69kb0g5atb631.jpg)
---
Like i said before, if even 20% of people are girls then that's one person per dungeon  group. It's not negligible.
---
Also you don't have to assume anything, If you don't call people "guy", "dude", "man" etc, English happens to be a magical language that doesn't actually assume gender because gender has no grammatical role.
---
I meant the guys reply with a imgur of a blizz forum post
---
Yea, I'm gonna be starting on my own as well like the first time around. Back then I met a few great people, but they have drifted away over the years and I myself skipped a couple of expansions like Cata and BfA.
---
To be honest, it would be difficult to play together with others anyway, since nowadays my playing time is much less than it used to be, basically limited to weekends. So I'll be starting a bit later and progress rather slowly. But hopefully, at least it will let me avoid the heavy competition for quest mobs. :)
---
So Monday 13pm for me!
---
Shit, they all paid at least 15 bucks in some way shape or form.  It's already a win.
---
I mean, I don't really hate the opposing faction buddy; we're all just gamers who love the game we're playing. It's just nice to have a little bit of that friendly rivalry and the banter that comes with it.
---
ret paly
---
FOR THE HORDE!!! 
---
I mean.. I'll be a dwarfen priest but i'll desert at some point for sure.
---
Took a peek into post history................yup, this thread makes sense (or doesn't) now.
---
Priests melt face in pvp
---
It's your goddamn dog. Take care of your animals, or don't own them. Simple as that. If you prioritize a dumb game over the well-being of a creature that you've put yourself in charge of, then you don't deserve that position.
---
You can ignore your kids though. They can live in squalor. Makes them hard and unforgiving. Just what Thrall needs.
---
Good beer choise.
---
Wow, that sounds like being a virgin.  It will be underwhelming and amazing in equal parts.  But you're likely to get hooked.
---
Why no love to hunter ? You will like it when my pet growl the mob while I freezing trap the second in the dungeon. Because you overhealed a bit the lock who life taped and the tank don’t have agro anymore :(
---
I mean for me it's worth the hassle of at least trying to change people's mind. I didn't expect this post to go well.
---
Didnt expect it to go that bad though, I'm disappointed by how toxic people are on this subreddit. It's just sad to see how angry all those guys are for no reason.
---
i'm gonna be doing the same. as a tauren.
---
Also flying solo.
---
Back when it was anounced the friends who introduced me to the warcraft universe through a bc private server (i only got to the mid 40s before they burned out then) were going to head in with me, but now they've all decided against it in favor of focusing on work and relationships or what not. I've also failed to convert any other friends to the game because they all either dislike tab combat or take issue with reacurring sub costs for a game.
---
To be honest though I'm actually a bit happy to be going in alone. Sure its a bit scary but I think if I did go in with even a few friends Id end up sticking with them and wouldn't get to wxperience the social aspect of wow in full. Plus itll allow me to level entirely at my own pace rather than worring about catching up or slowing down so I could still dungeon effectively with friends.
---
yes, you are correct
---
Warlocks are always needed and you'll get into groups very easily
---
Gurl *
---
I think once it's live and you enter said character it will be at your default realm. I hope so anyway, I'm on the same realm 😂
---
They need a "bring back the skeletons" shirt.
---
Won't 99.999% of the people use ingame name when talking too/about people?
---
If 1 "dude" slips in every now and then it feels like it should be whatever. KappaPride
---
If you have a wow subscription you have access to classic, go to the battle net website and download the beta, you can make a character but that’s it until it goes live.
---
Why are you annoyed by it?  
---
It's a classic way to address someone. It rolls off the keyboard better than just leaving blank when trying to address someone.   
---
Look at it this way;   
---
"Hey man, can you enchant that for me?"  
---
It's a slang, if you will. To make things casual and not so formal like you would in a regular sentence.
---
While if I knew you were a girl, I wouldn't use that to address you out of respect, it still makes it easier to talk casually to someone I don't know the gender of.
---
Any suggestion to potential alternatives will be welcomed tho!
---
Weapon skill will beat out berserking any day.  
---
The issue of not many axes for tanks is a real issue though.
---
I do yes, planning on twitch whoring when classic releases.
---
Because you do a 360 and trip over it
---
I didn't know they had bloods up in foreign language land.
---
Just go druid mate. :) There's no rule in this game that says "Only warriors can tank". I've been playing on private servers and seen goddamn shamans tank dungeons! Although I find it more difficult to maintain aggro as feral compared to a warrior, it certainly is more fun to level up as a druid!
---
Imagine thinking they are.
---
Oh, okay. In that case, I guess I'm a boomer as well.
---
&gt;both have a "back in my day" mentality
---
That's because things were objectively better "back in our day". Today, gaming "community" is dead, since it's now a mainstream - movement hijacked by the worst parts of the lifestyle and entertainment industries.
---
When I see how people behave in games, how they salivate after toxic streamer "personalities", spend tens of hours watching people play instead of playing, and demanding that games mechanics cater to their craving for instant gratification, I could puke.
---
Mage, Warlock or Hunter
---
I had the same problem. But gave up, can't change it to English. Just log onto an LA server and adapt to the times there. Also, why would you play on a Chinese server when the majority can't even speak proper English? You're missing out on the immersion bro. But if you ever do find a way, let me know so I can play too.
---
Probably will never do the same, this is just bad for health and mental health in general. But it was a little bit fun
---
Damn, I feel this so much as well. I had a friend (a co-worker who got me into WoW, who also mentored me) and she ended up getting pancreatic cancer in 2007 or so. Her dad came out to the West Coat to drive her back home so she could be with her family when she passed, and I never really got a chance to say goodbye.
---
I miss the fuck out of her, she always cracked me up with her 5 letter names; Her name was Julie, so her alts always had to have a theme off of the 'J' - Jinka (her main), Jendi, Jebee, etc.
---
I think I'll play a troll mage someday in her honor. :)
---
Dawwwwww, this was so adorable \^.\^
---
Good job.
---
another win for the 0,0001 percent of people and majority  has to pay.
---
What style do you practice? Some solid kicks in there, when you throw the front kick try keeping our base leg and foot flat, according to Samart that's where the power is! Good stuff my man.
---
Are you daft? Alliance always outnumbers Horde, especially in vanilla
---
I've had a similar situation before. Modify the files first, then right click -&gt; properties -&gt; tick "Read-only". Tell me if it works.
---
I'm just going to go ahead and say that this came off a bit weirdly. I was going for a reference to a small part of Onyxia Wipe Animation, and one of the lesser known images at that. I am sorry about any confusion that I may have caused.
---
I’m rolling on whitemane and I’m scared tbh
---
I'm gonna play Forsaken so I can eat people. That's big brains right there.
---
You reckon this is the best face for the roc males too? im having a hard time deciding on a face.
---
Just have to be a pedantic prick and tell you that it isn't a bank holiday in Scotland tomorrow so you're wrong, only England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
---
My shame as I'm playing wow for the first time back in 2004 and think my main warlock needs swords because they're cool and I've been using them on my undead... skip to shadowfang keep and shadowfang drops... roll need, win, equip, dont profit because I have no clue of the value that twinks will place on this item. Cries in broke...
---
So...working as intended in other words?
---
My girlfriend has never played and isn't interested in doing that. Also we're moving in together, 5 days after classic releases. Let's see how that works out.
---
I believe so. There’s also a 30 min hard logout regardless of whether you’ve been active in the char screen or not afaik
---
I always think its funny when people who are so hyped about a video game they visit forums and subreddits about it on a near daily basis tell other people who are excited about the same game to "calm down" in pretension of being "oh so mature".

And to you, ruining your health is achievement I take it ? You got used to it - your body adjusted - good for you but that ain't helping your life expectancy regardless. People not used to that making a brutal switch may encounter a lot more problems than you in that respect.

I had actually planned to take a whole week off of the gym. Now since I’ve been suffering mono the past 3 weeks, I didn’t hit the gym the entire time. So unfortunately I don’t have an excuse anymore. Will have to go at least 2 times after launch next week.

I honestly can't wait to help newbs out. 
---
Some of my earliest memories of WoW and what sold it to me was the big level 60's dropping me a few silver just because or tailoring me a shirt out of the kindness of the heart. 
---
I know it's all small stuff but that really gives you a positive boost when you're new to a game like WoW and I hope to help forge some of that positivity for a new set of players.
---
Understandable.  If I had realized there simply aren't the addon managers there were when last I played (ages ago) I'd have probably done the same (likely in python).  I still might...fuck, now I kinda want to.  If I didn't hate UI so much...
---
Definitely gonna do body weight squats and stretch during flight paths/tram rides/autorunning frkm the tons of fetch quests we'll have!
---
I remember this artwork. I saw it and knew the game was going to be amazing. I just didn't know exactly what it was going to be.
---
This was EXTREMELY good I'd say. Very well thought through and it felt like most things you'd like to know as leveling shaman was covered in just 45 mins.
---
Yeah, that's a fair point.  Fuck it, lemme chuck it at Wine and see what happens!

Most transphobic cis guys also want to fuck us, yes. I wonder how many of the hateful people in this thread actually watch trans porn.
---
Eh when you damage things you build threat against them. The mob you’re fighting has a list of people / pets with threat against it. As I understand it, taunt temporarily overrides this list to place the caster on the top of the list, drawing aggro.
---
Tanks have stances and buffs that cause their skills to generate more threat than normal.
---
I think there may be adding to help you track threat on your target, but I’m unsure of whether they will work in classic.
---
It's everything we ever wished for.

You made Spiderman a shaman, Drax a hunter, and Ironman a *warrior?*
---
I mean come on.   
---
Drax is clearly the warrior. Ironman is clearly the shaman, and Spiderman clearly the hunter.
---
They did not say that. You are mixing up and misinterpreting information.
---
They said the servers marked as medium pop would have been full at the original launch. They didn't say the medium population servers would have a wait.
---
What kind of savages are your parents by placing an unwrapped gift under a tree you have to stare at until Xmas day. That's brutal

---
This stuff is way overblown this time around. Back in the day people raided in greens and blues, suboptimal specs and had fun with it. Unless you're planning on downing Rag in the first 8-12 days with your guild then getting 40 people together will be a far larger priority for them than thinking about the extra 20dps they can eek out of your racial. This goes for all race / class combos.
---
Considering reports are handled by humans, it's not "exactly how it works" you fucking dullard. World PvP is not bannable.

---
And also my druid.
---
It really do be like that sometimes.
---
I think the biggest part that is usually left out is that you'll likely do all 3, sometimes even within the same raid. The power of Feral is how flexible it is thanks to Heart of the Wild. The fact that you can transition between tank, dps, and healing with a single talent build, all while doing them in a solid manner, is what makes you valuable.

I know about the 30 minute hard logout but Was just wondering if I already managed to get into the game and then log back out to the character selection screen that I should be able to go back in without a queue. I also believe it works this way but wanted to make sure.
---
title says "friendly" reminder, I call false advertising.  Speaking of which...
---
anyway, since MMORPG stands for Many Men Online RolePlaying Girls, it's usually best to just assume everyone's male.  Especially everyone who claims to be female.

If we have to hide away to avoid sexism that's not great either.
---
Besides people learn about it eventually, ie. When raiding. And that's when they usually go crazy like "omg there's a girl in the guild".
---
Here's a better alternative: let girls exist and don't treat them differently for being girls, but also don't expect them to have to hide their gender to play in peace.
---
Is there a chat command for it or do you have to do it with the GM ticket menu?

Bruh I got the shits just looking at this picture.

I believe this has been posted here a couple of times. Truth be told he was already removing those features blizzard found questionable 2 days ago and 4 days ago.
---
Probably play classic
---
ELI5 version: 
---
Every mob keeps it's own list of who it hates the most. Whoever is at the top of that list, it tries to kill. Anyone that causes it damage goes on the list - the more damage they do, the higher up the list they move. Some special spells (taunts) really annoy the mob, so it puts those people right to the top of its list.
---
You can use a threat meter like Omen to see the list for whatever mob you currently have targeted.
---
Time was, Warcraft didn't even have a world.  In my day Warcraft was only orcs and humans.
---
Anything pre 40 raids (and really pre bwl since MC and ony are so easy) doesn’t require optimization in any way. If you really want to raid you’re going to dump 31-46 points in the resto tree tho. 
---
Real point is ele/enh shams are just pretty garbage for PVE in general. If you want to PvP both can be great (ele especially). I would just plan on paying the money to respec ever so often depending on what you want to do.
---
That sub is for people who say things like Doggy Dog World, not simple typos or mispronunciations.
---
Not everyone, but most.
---
If I can pontificate a bit, for your edification. One of the rules of the Internet is: "there are no girls on the Internet." This rule does not mean what you think it means. In real life, people like you merely for being a girl. They want to fuck you, so they pay attention to you and they pretend what you have to say is interesting, whether or not you are genuinely interesting, or that you are smart of clever, whether or not you are actually smart or clever. On the Internet, there is no chance to fuck you; this means the advantage of being a "girl" does not exist. You don't get a bonus to conversation just because someone wants to put their cock in you.
---
When you make a post like "hurr durr, I'm a gurl," you are begging for attention. The only reason to post it is because you want your girl-advantage back, because you are too vapid or too stupid to do or say anything interesting without it. You are forgetting the rule "there are no girls on the Internet." The one way around this rule, the one way you can get your "girlness" back on the Internet, is to post your tits. This is, and should be, degrading for you, an admission that the only interesting thing about you is your naked body.
---
Women: *exist*
---
Gamers: "Stop stirring shit up and pretend to be a guy like everyone else"
---
Welcome home my Alliance friends.
---
well, you can abuse reckoning while leveling. i always level my paladins in prot spec
---
Exactly. Except the other way around, and you're daft.
---
And people laugh at Asmongold for not clicking links
---
u/Tactical_snail I believe this is for you!
---
I play both factions but for Vanilla it’s got to be Alliance
---
The Ironforge / Stormwind combo and my dislike of desert levels have ordained it so
---
I'm going in alone. I'm not social, find talking to people stressful and anxiety inducing but actually enjoy playing with others and being in a world with others, so was upset and disappointed by the hate for the LFG addon and the blue response. So I'll probably just end up doing what I did first time round - basically anything I can do solo.
---
I hate to be finnicky but is there a chance you could swap the two around? I kinda want them walking in opposite directions.
---
If not this is still great, thank you!!
---
Sure, many LW items are "Best in slot" or close to bis for both resto and feral. Take Devilsaur set and the Lava Belt (?). And in the DM patch we get Hide of the Wild for resto.
---
Jeez that sucks. My server (nerzhul) was linked with frostmourne when linked battlegrounds first came out. The horde on that server were savages. Miss those days.
---

Tremor is not near reliable as people believe it is. You can match fears to tremor's ticks and try to null them as they're cast but that was extremely touch and go back in the day. Sometimes they worked, other times it just led to the tank being feared for 1-4 seconds.

Level 10 either she makes the journey to westfall or you head to darkshore. Thats what i would do

So I assume this tanks TY Hiltons value. Brissett worth a late round pick?

Also with a neck beard like Luck's, and how polite he is, he clearly is a Tauren.

No one is born cool, except for of course the Defias Pillagers

Possibly a keyboard macro? A lot of Razer keyboards have the facility to record actions. If they went to character creation and set it to ctrl v "Mongo" and hit enter every 10 seconds that'd work. Or it could just be bad luck.
---
When she have done the level 10 class quest.
---
Exact reason I so much want to roll alliance and gank ppl in STV for atleast a month straigh (yeah so called "no reason to pvp") - horde players feel to much entitled just because they picked red faction
---
Saw someone saying that you'll be disconnected after 30 minutes if you don't do anything or enter the queue during this time
---
The cast time will take three years of waiting while you get harassed by strangers online, then you might be able to get pills to slowly change your appearance.
---
By that time, classic wow might have burning crusade servers.
---
nice
---
IF she's new and you want her to get interested in the game, don't make her do any sort of skip. 
---
Either you run to Teldrassil or meet up at level 10 in Darkshore/Loch Modan/Westfall. There is a pretty decent fedex guide for humans floating around and it takes you to Teldrassil at one point.
---
Great time to, you know he'd be down too

Blizzard will just launch 10-15 more servers / region anyway.

Whoever is playing the nightelf is going to go through Menethil Harbor / wetlands which has 20+ mobs. It's possible they can just run for it and keep dying/rezzing. I'd honestly just recommend leveling up enough for the night elf to get through the wetlands with little annoyances.
---
Blaumeux is the only balanced PvP server unfortunately, everything else is about 10%+ in favor of Horde.  The trade off is BG queues should be much shorter as Alliance. although you could just roll Alliance on a PvE server and get the best of both worlds since there will be cross realm BGs anyways.
---
and toontown online isn't even running anymore.

we don't have "toons" in this game.

---

---
 OK so we know that the classic wow servers  limit us to three (3) names total,  however I feel like i’ve picked the wrong server,  now I got a couple cool names,  but I really don’t like the choice I made considering they’ll be tons of people on this server and streamers.  I was wondering if I delete these characters can I now create other characters on a different server? 
---
 Your help would be greatly appreciated As  I am preparing for a long Monday,  and I don’t want to make any mistakes.
---
To the game we all have long? Or am I mishearing that line
---
Moonkin represent!
---
IMO the content will be relatively easy. The hard part is the preparation and organization.
---
The content will be easy because of the access to knowledge that wasn't available back then.  By this I mean everybody knows what the best gear, professions, races, etc are.  Even if you're not "min-maxing" most people have more gaming experience which will make the content easier. To your point, I don't think world buffs for example will be necessary to clear MC unless you're going for a world first rag or raiding in a casual guild.
---
The hard part is the prep and organization. Just getting 40 people to a raid is a pain when you only have 2 warlocks that can summon. Oops - they forgot to farm soulshards beforehand.  Or when you wipe in a raid and 6-7 people have to hearth out to repair because nobody remembered to bring a field repair bot.  Even if the content isn't difficult per say, WoW just eats time.

Eeeeh, we had RAF for a long, long, LONG time before boosts and even store stuff iirc? They're pretty different systems.
---
This won't apply to Classic anyway. The RAF reward I mentioned is just for modern WoW. It's not confirmed but it's spotted in a lot of datamining related to a new RAF system.

Quiet, Hunter
---
I would say level 10 after your gf finished her hunter quest because there's no hunter class trainer in Goldshire.
---
&gt;I think it depends on the damage. 
---
* Damage
---
* heal (which generates aggro on all targets you are in combat with)
---
* aggro generating abilities (like the voidwalkers torment)
---
* aggro reducing abilities (like a Rogues Feint)
---
* Buffing and debuffing
---
...all change your entry on the mobs "threat-table"
---
&gt;But can ibsee anywhere how much damage i can still deal before getting aggro on me?
---
Not directly, because the game API doesn't reveal that information. But you can get an addon (they are called "threat meters") that estimates this for you by parsing the combat log. These estimates are very precise nowadays.
---
&gt; If i stop with the attacks for 5-10 secs does my aggro resets or lowers?
---
No, if you do nothing, your aggro simply stays the same for as long as you are in combat with that mob, unless you use an aggro reducing ability, or somehow wipe your aggro entirely (dying, feign death, vanish, divine intervention). Unfortunately, the Classic Warlock has no abilities to do so. However, if you stop damage, you give your tank / VW the chance to again build more aggro than you, and become the mobs target again.
---
&gt;Also how is fear working exactly?
---
The exact formula is unknown to all but Blizzard, but it depends on your level, the level of your fear spell, the level of the target, the targets shadow resistance (which is part of the reason why you see Drakedog constantly applly CoS, and whether the target is a mob or player (fear breaks much faster on players)).

For PvE end game content, you're going to have to go Resto. There's really no argument against it.

---
Shes taken those hordes as hostage
---
It's the wrong red
---
Just FYI it will be 10am, not 9.
---
So what? No tank stacks spirit, nor should they.
---
I honestly think the Launch queues are being overblown. Most of what I've read from the devs concerning queues dealt with the inevitable (and likely sooner than most think) removal of layering.
---
Layering will hide the queues. But once it's gone you may find yourself with a significant queue because your server has been overpopulated all along and layering has allowed you to play anyway.
---
That's how I understand it.

Am I stupid? How do you change the pet loyalty?

Offended isn't the right word. I don't jump at people's throat for saying guys, unlike the people in this thread who jump at mine for pointing out girls exist. I did say it was just a friendly reminder.
---
Also you don't even have to call random people guys in the first place.
---
That's both the good and bad with vanilla. Things are so much more time consuming but at the same time you are forced to talk and bond with people.
---
Just take instances for example:
---
- live: click a button, get warped to the instance with a bunch of random people that you know you never will have to play with again. 
---
- vanilla: write in chat and hope people response. Then walk to the instance and wait for the full party and then hopefully go through the instance. It was not rare to go through the instance multiple times if you find a good party or friend list people that was fast to the instance.
---
Well to be honest I don't know how old you are but that heart of yours needs some taking care of I think.  
---
No need to take drastic steps to increase your health, just doing some thing passive like eating less highly transformed food and replacing that amount progressively with whole ones can help.  
---
I never was morbidly overweight but I can tell you the day I stopped eating foods with added sugar in it (as in not naturally present in the food) I literally lost 20 kg over the course of two months. Can't tell you it easy, it's a struggle not to eat some crap once in a while but I managed. If you wanna try, I suggest taking it really slowly. Progressively swapping. And the extra added bonus is cooking. If you go and cook yourself a meal - not necessarily anything complicated, it "builds up" appetite and anticipation. As such I find I enjoy my food more.

The population was never estimated with characters, always with accounts. Do you think that 1,000 players with  15 characters each on a server count as 15,000 players?

The algos are estimating the population based on players, which atm over 2 million worldwide, that reserved names.

Find treasure is actually dope. Shows you which crates are real in strat rofl.
---
Anyone has a sub to share and play with ?
---
Palading leveling = autoattacking through the entire health pool of each mob. Retri talents do help a bit but I don't think going holy will set you back significantly. You do need a good 2-hander at all times however.
---
The internet may have changed, but humans haven't.
---
1000 upvotes for this man!
---
I think most people underestemate the damage of the mobs in strat live. Without CC, the battlemages would rip this group apart. Make sure you kill them first. Timmy would require a tank unless youre in T2,5 with 62 DPS+ 2h'ers.
---
Needless to say, the group with resto shaman, 1 prot and 3 arms would probably be the best.
---
Rugoe
---
Wow congrats dude
---
Worth it
---
I'm honestly more afraid of boredom. Leveling in classic was tedious enough. With how games are designed today I fear I may not have the patience to worry about all the things I used to in wow.
---
I'm already excited for the Final Fantasy 8 remaster... So I'll play as long as I'm having fun with the game.
---
On the recent fresh private server that ran for only 2 months a guild managed to make it as far as Naxx in about a month and a half. They stopped raiding from lack of interest a few weeks early. The biggest bottleneck with everything unlocked was the Nefarian cloaks.
---
Good luck!
---
this type of post will always attract negativity because of it's design. No one cares, if you are confused by that allow me to explain. When you shout out on the internet something that generally only pertains to you, even if in your eyes it doesn't, people will percieve it as a cry for attention and you'll be met with comments that invoke hostility because it's either ignore it or take a stab at you. Well taking a stab at you is fun because you exposed yourself. 
---
I believe this is exactly what you wanted just for the attention. And also I pretty much assume any female toon with a girly name is a girl. I don't bother to find out, because it doesn't matter to me if they are a guy or a girl.
---
I've googled this and come up short, can anyone say for sure what time it releases on the 27th in the UK please?
---
Lmao, poor guy. Could have been a hall of fame lock if he weren’t always injured
---
Mentallity of players was completelly different - remember we are talking about period of 15 years old  
---
Its that time when even closer to end of vanilla you saw r14 player kliking his spells\\keybordturning, no racial can overcome this xD
---
Is that server more alliance? I was looking yesterday and it’s the only pvp server not high pop so was gonna roll on it so I can actually play. Also I used to play on emerald dream US and for some reason the insanity of RP servers is just so much fun
---
Yes. Also, at 1pm eastern US time (5 hours before launch) the three character limit is removed and you can make as many characters as you want. I’d suggest waiting until then to get your characters on other servers if you like the names you have on Faerlina.
---
I just bound zoom to arrow keys up and down.
---
Mousewheel is too valuable for me to waste it on zooming. Its 6 easy to reach keybinds if you use shift &amp; ctrl as well.
---
"crippling depression poison" LOL
---
How do you know someone plays horde? Damn you beat me to the punchline!!
---
**I SMELL A FAKE GAMER**
---
Eu launch is 12 am, noon not midnight
---
 WoW is indeed an addicting game. When I was a kid I used to play a quite a few games A LOT, some would call it addiction I guess. I don't worry about it today because as an adult it's different. Feels like as a kid I would immerse myself into the games in a different way. Lacking perspective or however to describe it.
---
 I do worry slightly that I will play more than I should during the first couple of weeks when you are the most amped up for a game. I don't want to do stuff like skip workouts because of WoW or stay up later than I should missing sleep. As long as you are aware of it though it shouldn't be an issue. Will in fact probably not play the first day. Busy and the free time I have I will choose to use for a pretty tough workout I had planned instead of playing. 
---
 Another worry would be raiding. Will try and join a raiding guild. I just hope the guild will stick to whatever schedule they said. If the schedule says raiding between 19-23 or whatever I don't want to sit in front of my computer at midnight.
---
Me too mate. The whole way through I’ve been thinking I’m going to roll Dwarf priest.. until yesterday when I logged in to look at my characters and realised I’ve no interest in playing Dwarf and want to be a Nelf. 
---
Im going to be AFKing heaps to look after the 1 year old (and literally just found out yesterday we’re having a second, blood test pending to confirm, no one knows yet) which means I’m going to rely on Shadowmeld a fair bit, especially being on a PvP server ...
---
Agonising over it, because the Dwarf racials are so so good... 
---
one half of me thinks “do whatever TF you want” but the other half is whispering “people will think you’re shit cause you’re not a dwarf”... 🤦‍♂️

tbf that Warrior with Arcanite Reaper was using it when Mortal Strike did 220% weapon damage, so yeah he was quite a frightening beast of a player.
---
I honestly think it'll be cooler to dive in again,knowing nobody around you, and making friends on the way. Neither of my friends play WoW, just my brother, but he will spend way more time playing wow, and I've got no intention to level together anyway. I'm really looking forward to take my own pace, work on some professions when I'm tired of leveling for a bit, and socializing with others
---
I don't mean to sound too harsh (but I'm going to).
---
How did I handle this? I picked new names and went on with my life. The name of your character doesn't change gameplay. It is like refusing to play Monopoly because you didn't get the car.
---
I am merely suggesting that many people seem to be overly concerned with names...
---
Hmmmmmm this seems to be coming from somewhere else..
---
*checks post history*
---
ah...yeah...lol
---
Running a setup like this bur the table in the middle is a great idea. Clean setup.
---
This was a bad post that could've been a great post if you explained it just a little bit
---
Also a man
---
Awesome, thanks :)
---
And what are they gonna do? Ban him permanently? I guess its time to permanently switch to youtube then.
---
Awesome picture!
---
I haven’t experienced any raid leader saying ”pick that troll instead of the undead cause hes gonna have better dps” no one cares that much, atleast not the general playerbase. Go undead for that sick casting animation.
---
\&gt; horde is pussy for going on servers with permanent pvp more than alli
---
wth
---
Getting pretty addicted on slither.io its a lot of fun especially when i kill a very big snake player
---
Shit if I know friend, just the 2 classes I enjoy most.  Will have both at 60 period just can't decide what I wanna lvl first.
---
Three years? I know someone who's been waiting 5. Which might take the servers up to WotLK.
---
Never know, might get a bit of high latency and can cast earlier than expected!
---
I say: let the misinformation spread out, that way people wont even try to download the addon, all good.
---
Where did you get that low is a full vanilla? Low could be 1 person.
---
For the majority its true - but still there are exceptions as always, sometimes you just meet that bloodthirsty [dwarf that stalks you so until you've gotta accept spirit res.
---
And after that he kills you on GY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rouchn6t1iE)
---
just play undead 
---
no recruiter will think twice about race
---
Oooh tsss
---
I vaguely remember in vanilla/tbc if you skinned and got rid of the corpses, the monsters spawned faster than when leaving the corpses, not sure if looting affected this as well, am I wrong?
---
Actually, the only IP right you need to "defend or lose it", is trade marks. Everything else is at the option of the owner. Pictures of orcs and etc, are not trade marks, that falls under copyright as a work of art. 
---
For a trade mark to infringe it needs to be as a badge of origin on the goods or services (a trade mark doesn't protect a work of art), and consumers need to see it as such. Nobody thinks the above fanart comes from blizzard and hence it is pretty unlikely there would be trade mark infringement.
---
You actually can just load a picture of star wars and try to sell it, however, it's up to disney to come after you, nobody else. That's how copyright works. Some countries have a few copyright laws in their criminal code, but those are usually old fashioned ones about pirated videos/dvd stores. So it isn't "illegal", unless Blizzard complains (in this case they would submit a DMCA  or legal notice first, or take the owner to court to prove it is copyright infringement.).
---
There is no need to get angry or offensive just because you don't understand the law. It's complicated and hence why intellectual property legal professionals like me have jobs.

---
This is a reference to It’s always Sunny in Philadelphia.
---
Nobody said that. They will just revoke his partnership.
---
I'm glad you like it, I wasn't sure whether to post it or not. I also had second thoughts of who should be besides Omar because Brian isn't there and I feel kinda bad for that even though it's a meme.
---
how do I make a bot kill itself??
---
Lol I also started at 9 and now I'm 24, cheers bro see you in Classic
---
/hug
---
Going alone, but I hope to make some friends. I'll also try and help out as many people as I can, since that was my original goal when I played WoW for the first time.
---
considering said woman is actually man, this whole thread got my head hurting
---
Careful with this particular one. Reviews seem to be mixed, specifically regarding product quality.
---
Yeppp exactly!
---
Stand up and log in at 4am. I completely changed my sleep schedule for my vacation.
---
Wait, do you think not forcing women to pretend they're men is "conforming to personal views"?
---
... Are you okay? You do know that women are allowed to exist in peace and this shouldn't be a matter of opinion, right?
---
If you're allowed to be called a guy online, women should be just as allowed to be referred to correctly. I mean they teach you how to refer to people correctly in primary school...
---
Why would the end game need to be nerfed lol
---
Personally I would go with fear ward, but then I don't mind the female dwarf models at all. If it really bothers you, just go human. The number of times not having fear ward fucks you over will definitely be less than the amount of times you wish you weren't playing a dwarf if you don't like them.
---
Try my best to make it not wasted time. I’m already watching too much classic related shit trying not to let it consume me past few weeks before it actually does.
---
&gt;If I can pontificate a bit, for your edification

&gt;Using only "one button" is an exaggeration often brought forward by people who generally dislike a class anyway. No class only uses one button.

I am talking about the main rotation, though. Was there more than spaming lightning bolt against a boss?

Go with your heart. Unless you’re top tier end game it won’t matter. Even then, it’s still not make or break.

Pick the race YOU want to play.

The question is why they should do something against it. Stuff like that existet in vanilla, it just wasn't used because no one knew.

Yes I believe like a couple hours before launch. Then some more the day of/after can’t remember there is a blue post about it though.

I want a doggo again :(

Get used to it (again) pal

Cool!

\[Herod\] WTS - Bolvar

Will gladly get on Discord and screen share for proof.

&gt; there is no 40yards nameplates so you actually have to target anyone from distance, hence down the lesser player model is the better, you wont be spotted as easy

also a bunch of players are clickers so ggwp

I literally just got home from work and am off until Thursday.. My plans for the next 36 hours is to sleep as much as possible.
---
This is such a beauty
---
Ah, that makes a ton more sense haha!
---
I don’t remember where I saw this before but I find it to be true that they are often Tauren
---
Very good!
---
Do you have a vector graphics version? I could rasterize them myself but it you have an original/handmade that's always better.
---
Firemaw is also pretty good, A:46,5% / H:53,5% last time I checked
---
We're going home pal, and you're coming with us :)
---
&gt;You're right, and bonding takes time. It's not in a single run that you will form friendships.
---
But if you have the incentive to add them to your friend-list (to reduce downtime looking for people), you meet them again. and again. and then again.
---
Slowly but surely you get to know the person.
---
&gt;You'll never get those opportunities with this addon, is my point.
---
This doesn't make sense to me, tho. Like I said, you aren't adding someone just because you found them once. If the run went great, THEN you are adding them.

Even for an adult addiction to WoW is quite possible.
---
I remember during the days of old WoW I've read horror stories about people lose their jobs, marriage destroyed and debt being piled up because of WoW addiction.
---
Sure fire way to get diabetes or a heart attack like that one guy in the news that one time playing wow.
---
Please take breaks kappa 🤣😅
---
No addons are the best vanilla experience. and if you want the full blown best experience you go "non instant quest text" your welcome.
---
Oh boy. Thank god I have /spit macrod.
---
Lol its mixed because end users are stupid AF. Like the 1 star because he cant reinstall windows correctly. Always fun when people dont rate things well because they have no idea what they are doing.
---
Just like in classic :)
---
Who the hell will be watching some guys stream instead of playing the Classic launch?
---
Had the same problem. Reinstall the client
---
I would actually recommend a levelling guide and work through it while playing. A lot of people seem to be under the impression that you don't need a levelling guide but Vanilla WoW has a lot of quests of varying levels spread all over the world and you can miss out on a lot without proper routing for your 1-60 journey.
---
Almost no one will keep going after a C&amp;D. It's not worth getting potentially getting sued over, especially since mod authors aren't some low-key criminals who spread their work on some shady website or Pirate Bay.
---
They generally play by the rules, because they aren't in this to rebel or try to set a precedent. Now sod off mate.
---
Love it! Nicely done!
---
Why am I learning this two days before launch.
---
I don't think boss mods have lead to retail beeing a "single player experience", especially as boss mods have nothing to do with solo content.
---
Going for the authentic vanilla experience I see
---
wtf is up with everyone saying talk first or only roll healing gear.  I've only seen that nonsense on WotLK-and-later pservers, I always assumed it comes from modern retail.  If the dps is so dumb they think a lvl 30 shaman shouldn't roll on dps gear, it's on the dps to speak up.  Have fun finding a healer for leveling dungeons if you're the dps who thinks that way lol.  What, you want a priest to heal you through ZF and pass on the mojo mask?  Come on.
---
You can see on the poll what percentage of Greeks are going to go in which PvE realm, but most of us are going on PvP ones (we are doing PvE progress though)
---
What you say is true, however if I was telling the same thing to myself it was just sound like I'm giving excuses to my addiction heh.
---
But you are totally right, I will never forget the blast I had with my WoW friends.
---
Mining since all the power levelers and lots of others will rush engineering once they hit 60. Prices for copper and iron will explode once the majority of players left the starter areas where copper is found.
---
Maybe stay in Retail then, troll. Meanwhile get blocked.
---
Oh what a tragedy... i play lots of female characters and im often called a she in dungeons and what not.. who the fuck cares?
---
You can't even skin starting zone mobs, but it doesn't matter because dynamic respawns are on and insane in those zones, you can just kill the same thing over and over again super quickly. In the stress test they respawned in about 4-5 seconds.
---
Being in this subreddit and not knowing these characters deserves death by exile!
---
I'm actually starting college the 26th for the authentic classic WoW TM experience
---
I remember at some point they did include that but I’m not sure it was in vanilla. However based on it not effecting gameplay, rather a back end thing, I’d think that it’d be included. Nothing worse than getting in to a server to then be booted to the back of a 3 hour queue
---
Yeh, but seemingly the community has a LOT of people who don't want others to have options and instead would rather force their own way on them. That it sucks for 90% of players doesn't matter for them, it seems.
---
Shut up with your stupid post alliance scum LOKTAR OGAR PUSSYS xd
---
Yeah... I'm pretty densisitised to it too, I don't care much when people do it while playing because it's unavoidable. But I figured I could at least make a thread to just point it out, in case it might help people change a bit.
---
But even that is too much to ask. Gamers fucking hate us.
---
This is honestly making me wonder if I should really play this game. When I see this thread I wonder what kind of horrible harassment I'll get ingame once classic is live and people I play with learn I'm a girl.
---
Anyway thanks for your comment, I'm feeling very alone with this thread. Didn't think peiple would be this shitty. I really thought wow players had grown up since vanilla.
---
Its just really sad and pathetic to see...
---
Oh shit I swear I'm not Horde
---
At this point every time I see that armor set it think of hayven games, thought this post was about him almost admittedly.
---
Yes it was a scam for people to waste 2 weeks of subscription. I mean it was kind of obvious anyway.
---
Pandas!!
---
Thats why I hope they used 2400 hour format and GMT when giving out times. Now it's that am/pm ctpstd-what ever. 
---
Could be wrong but other than Blizz launches I dont see anything else than 2400 format with GMT +/-hours
---
Cool pic
---
You want yellow?
---
Ar u gal?
---
Good thing that some kids here try to tell me how the stuff in the field I specialized in and worked in for the past 12 years *actually* works.
---
Sod off.
---
Why do you even care? It literally wouldn't effect you either way.
---
True, my server was like 80% alliance for most of Vanilla. It wasn't a lot of fun for either side.
---
Dude, whenever you like or not the show this song is fucking legit.
---
The queues will only worsen with time unless more servers are added.
---
I yearn for these days. Man, such memories.
---
That's beautiful, thanks for sharing that moment.
---
I'm going dwarf hunter, just like I did 14 years ago! The race aesthetic is perfect for the class, and your capital city will be in the main alliance area. Can't go wrong with hunters, not super gear dependent and are very good solo due to having a pet.
---
No trouble at all, here you go:

Even with smaller classic bags we carry entire sets of weapons and armour with many precious glass bottles to hold our potions and elixirs. We hold the heads of dragons and other beasts along with our stacks of ore, smelted solid bars and leather hides. We carry enough food and drink to last a person weeks of not months.
---
Our character holds at least as much as a cart pulled by two oxen. I wouldn't want to downgrade to only as much bag space as these poor souls have.
---
That's the only flavor this week.
---
u already made the drawing? I'd love to see it! and yes the hype is insane. this is harder than waiting for christmas even when your 7 years old.
---
That crazy bastard in the back travelling in Moonkin form
---
Since BG's will be x-realm there will be much more horde queueing because of all said above things - alliance playeras are more pve-centered for the majority wheres horde "wants to smash" and just queues into bg's as theuir main playtime we WILL see same situation as on retail: Horde will sit in 10-15min queues while Alliance will be getting instant pop's  
---
Imagine being a horde player and getting your 15+ minues solo queue into premade that wipes your whole "for the Horde" randoms that just dinged 60 and has 2k hp like a kittens
---
lol you probably saw a lot of "oops", it's my first time learning lua so got a bit surprised by some things that work/dont work. thanks tho

I usually survive with 1% hp, dunno why, always had luck with that
---
It saddens me that most players don't get this reference. Have an upvote =)
---
&gt;Copy-pasting what I wrote in the other thread asking a similar question.
---
The Spanish and Portuguese are sticking with Shazzrah.
---
APES nobody knows for sure, probably Gehennas though with a lot of the private server guilds.
---
Scandinavians are split but mostly on Gehennas (Sweden) and Firemaw (Denmark &amp; Norway) with a large amount on Shazzrah too.
---
Italians also chose Firemaw.
---
Eastern Europeans are fairly spread but Hungary, Turkey, Czechs and Slovaks are mostly going Golemagg.
---
British and Dutch are obviously on every realm as usual. A lot of British on Shazzrah but Mograine is looking like the new English realm.
---
Personally I was set on Shazzrah, but the apparent huge faction imbalance, queues and the amount of British/English speaking people moving over to Mograine has convinced me to make some characters there instead.
---
Obviously this isn't everyone from those nations, but what the majority appears to be leaning based on the surveys and public announcements.
---
Hopefully this helps. Don't forget to check out the pinned survey thread too.
---
Tauren are nearly always bros back in the day, Mulgore was a filter for a-holes and plebs. The zone is huge, there's a LOT of running and a lot of situations where a pack of mobs you need to kill have hostile, higher level mobs patrolling.
---
The impatient and the like would just re-roll orc, troll or undead. As a result tauren players always tended to be very patient.
---
The exception was tauren druids, they were a 50/50 since that's the only way to be a Horde druid.
---
If you see a female tauren, take a screenshot because you just saw a unicorn!
---
I think you missed the point there, assume they don't stop, will they sue ?
---
if yes, then were back to the original point, you think blizzard will sue anyone who breaks the rules ?
---
If yes, that will make many people not wanna make addons because they are scared of getting sued and wasting their time.
---
If they don't sue then people will make addons and its irrelevant.
---
You sure showed me.

---
Fear not! There is true fulfillment in the service of the Ancient Ones!
---
Made my characters last night. No queue
---
There isn't one server that will be unpopulated or "empty" lol they are going to have to add many more even after launch watch.
---
Ouch. No one can ever really do this.
---
Such a beautiful time in gaming. It was WoW and Dino Crisis 3 for me at this time. Such pure advertising. Pre Facebook and all this modern garbage we have now.
---
Soulforge for me. I did all the quests to get it upgraded. Sacrificed my lightforge for it... Then vendored it during a stretch when I was in need of bank space and Xmog wasn't in yet.

I've been on a keto diet for the last few months, lost a very good chunk of weight, and am almost at my target goal.  That being said, I'm planning a huge snack-fest for WoW Classic launch week, buying lots of unhealthy shit, and pretty much just taking a break from the diet, but only for about a week.  Right after I go back to work and such, I'm going back to my keto diet to finish.  This week will be a good fun break, nothing but WoW and crappy food to make me happy while I play my favorite game of all time with some really good friends and guildies\~
---
You couldn't post a live countdown?  🤣
---
It won't come any sooner......noooooooo.
---
im driving over an hour away to find a case of "Bawls" energy drinks, so I can fully immerse myself in the year 2005. 
---
filling the fridge/freezer with everything 13 year old me would want, and taking 3 days off of work.
---
ready to fucking GO!!!
---
People understood how OP wotf was in beta and early launch  It used to last 30 seconds.  The old wow forums used to have posts calling for its nerf.
---
ill tailor some for if u give me the mats and a massive tip
---
Yeah I really don't like them... Especially as priests. Idk dwarves in robes just look weird
---
No one will care a week from now, anyway (even before they nerf the API).
---
10/10 reference
---
If you translate smth oviously wrong its meaning changes. Even you little afd voter feel the reference if you read windfuhrer
---
It's sadly the truth. Tauren druids are always a coin toss between 'normal tauren player (AKA biggest bro you could meet)' vs 'Someone who would really rather play orc or undead and hated the tauren starting zone but really wanted to be a druid'.
---
Character name checks out...
---
Hey guys, just got reminded, it was a good call.
---
Wow, so much work. 
---
But then I realised it is a lot more time than that isn't it. All the hours of practicing art to get to the point where you could spend these 30 hours to conjure this!
---
Both the horde and alliance illustrations are so charming, nostalgic, hopeful, and beautiful.
---
Art is like magic, and you are a magician.
---
I have an ex that lost a brother at 20 years old. When someone that young dies (especially one you’re close to, we dated for almost 5 years), you get really smacked in the face with the existential “Are we just what we leave behind?” questions.
---
Every time you think of her, she lives for just a few moments in you. I think of him occasionally too; his last words to me were “I’ll see you for Christmas, yeah?” but he unfortunately didn’t make it to that Christmas.
---
Yes! I used questie during the stress test. I didn't have any issues.
---
I didn’t realize Mage was the only class with that combo
---
Why so many people like the alliance?!
---
Would like to have horde version :D
---
Great artwork!!!
---
Yeah decamp and Kargoz are rolling on that server, it will be full
---
This is the real reason you shouldn't do it.
---
/r/woosh
---
Level no addons and without instant quest text. the immersion and adventure is even greater. trustt
---
But the Tauren starting zone is my fav zone :D , I love mulgore with it's peaceful mountains and Plainfields
---
I think modern wow works a bit more like runescape, but for classic it's important to be able to meet the same people and not being able to switch away from threats/abuse to find rare stuff (as soon as layering is gone) and develop a sense of community
---
Looks good
---
Doesn't matter as it rely on the chat. You could be the only addon user on the server and everyone will still be " affected" by it.
---
I was a wow widow for 2004.  I gave in and played 2005.  Now, while we are both excited for Classic, i play way more than he does.
---
Why wasn't this just uploaded to Imgur or any of the other sites who don't make it a literal nightmare to try and download?
---
I'm trying to find a simple fucking download link on that stream workshop bullshit, "subscribe to download"? Not a fucking chance.
---
I religiously watch college football and LOVE vanilla/classic wow so this week is going to be like one long orgasm that just won't quit.
---
My Dwarf bois
---
If i play orc fury warrior and dual wield 2 axes do i get axe specialization bonus twice?
---
I haven't subscribed but will do so tomorrow.
---
Thing is, even if they max out on cons, a decent warrior without cons would still win that race.
---
Think of reddit mods, just 10x more pathetic.
---
No. Again with the "it was back in vanilla".  
---
It wasn't. It was similar, but it wasn't like what we've seen in the beta, where it interconnects players who use the addon and automatically form groups. As far as I can tell, all it did was filter things out based on player class in /who and with /lfg. Nothing more.  
---
Pinboard is more like what was in vanilla. And they won't be able to do anything against it, cause all it will be is an extension to the game, not a feature like that LFG addon.
---
&gt; Gamers fucking hate us.
---
No, people in general hate when people make a big deal out of nothing. Especially when they aren't what they're claiming to be.
---
Hi, /u/electricmaze
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cv6jiv/im_playing_with_friends_and_dont_want_to/). 
---
Fucking up your sleep schedule will lead to you falling behind on leveling
---
your example is a reason why we want this system, we do not want people who have good gear and saved up dkp to think they can just join for rag and get the dagger over someone that's been there and cleared up to then, even though the scenario you described indeed is a little sad for eric. if we wanted to secure eric getting it we'd run loot council - but seeing since we're a group of friends running the guild i don't think that'd go well with people joining  
---
lowering the attrition would do the following:   
---
make the saved point roof higher (with 50% attrition the cap is 22points, with 25% it's 66points)  
---
make saving up dkp a faster process  
---
let people use more dkp in raids and still have a big saved amount  
---
i think these are things we want to avoid
---
Now, I don#t, and I also don#t feel you have been "fucked over".
---
You have chosen a name so unoriginal, common, cringe.inducing pseudo-funny and obvious, a dead gerbil could have told you that it will likely be snatched up the moment the servers are up.
---
Complaining that exactly that is what happened, is like complaining about gravity or the sunrise.
---
They associate it with Retail LFD/LFR tool because of the name, that's all.
---
Did you try female trolls, look better than undead IMO
---
Did you just assume eveyone not sharing your opinion in this post is a guy?
---
If I level as a enh shaman, will I be able to heal dungeons in that specc? Do I need to hybrid my way through leveling? 
---
I really want to heal, but leveling as resto seems like a horrible idea.
---
i forgot to thank you for the reply, i do really appreciate it
---
Really the only thing I remember about it, is the subscription fiasco. In 2010 in what looked like a belated April Fools prank, EA's payment system got caught in an infinite loop, charging everyone up to a thousand dollars in duplicate transactions.
---
its crazy how helpful this game has been to many of us.
---
Absolutely not.
---
Woah, and I thought WoD zones were awful.
---
Why are so many addons on github instead of curse?
---
Best keybinds hands down. I like to use ones that i feel like make sense. So stuff like movement such as blink, sprint etc are always my mousewheel up button while on mousewheel down i usually have a defensive cd.. except when i play dk on retail, then mousewheel down is obviously grip
---
All mobs scaled to 60, dungeons tuned to 60-63. I'm game, that sounds dope.
---
umm, i didnt? Im sure many people have made guides about these items they were just ones i could remember while questing &amp; dueling...
---
Server transfers will probably be a thing 6 months down the line.
---
Ye it was so hard and people just forget that the hardest part was our terrible pcs and lag which now we dont have
---
But I wasn't rude.
---
Oh, well, yeah you're right...   
---
But I think there's a slight difference in how likely you are to add them even if they aren't exceptional.
---
I was a Hunter running around with the Ravager axe from SM. I don't think I need to really go into much detail there. Cant wait to do it all over again!
---
I got my large cus i knew this would happen. they were out of stock completely before that. I jumped on em as soon as i saw them in stock. GL!
---
Oh snap you are right. Damn my maths on a Sunday.
---
I think that's what I'll end up doing!
---
it sucks that we don't have human hunters!
---
you will need and you will have standbys if you plan on raiding as a guild
---
Will current addons work with wow classic? I haven't played since cata and only want simple addons such as character notes, something to reorganise bars etc.
---
Will we have to wait for people to make classic specific addons?
---
I want the t0 Druid set no matter what.
---
Dude you are wasting healer drink, time.
---
If there is a mage, I don't really care. if there isn't, I do, especially if I am the  Healer
---
What joy is there in this curse?
---
For a replacement for bongos, check out dominos
---
Best Alliance race for Hunter PvE and PvP wise?
---
Literally every other content creator does that, Hell even esfand and friends were making videos of a 20 second dev post into a 14 minute video.
---
When a game like Vanilla WoW aka 15 year old game every bit of content is going to be like beating a dead horse.
---
Not even transitioning either. This thread is fucking pathetic.
---
I'm not even sure I'm gonna sub until Tuesday when I get up since it launches in the middle of the night and I have a feeling I'll just end up staring a the login screen until I need to go to bed.
---
But on the other hand, I do wanna be there, even if it means just playing a few minutes - classic launch is only once after all.
---
Because they're opening on the 27th. That's why.
---
Public holiday here!
---
Why would Hunter be evil??
---
I'm expecting it to be a filter for dungeons. With classic having x3-5 the population more than vanilla you need something to filter out LFG chat.
---
&gt;
---
Not for a long time
---
I don't think there is any difference just because the way you add people
---
I've encounter one spot while leveling where mobs instantly respawn when skinned. Around level 14.
---
Might be more area.
---
That snake is spooky
---
... I'm trans? I was pointing out how hard it is to actually transition in a sarcastic way, in the vain hope that I might open the previous commenter's eyes on our lives being hard.
---
Unless you meant to reply to another comment?
---
No, it is literally impossible. In fact the developers originally locked xp for anyone whosoever holy as a priest. This was patched out in 1.2 but the company gained is still 1/4 of the xp of any other spec
---
Kind of looks like a band of happy go lucky instagram influencers out for a nice hike with a morning cup of starbucks. 
---
Cause that's how basic it is to play a human in a fantasy rpg
---
No it wouldn't.
---
What? I don't remember it being this way unless it was changed later. My memory of vanilla is that the higher the item level, the higher enchanting you would need to disenchant it.
---
ive been drawing or over 10 years now as a Hobby!
---
You really want me to wait an additional 96 hours ? What did I do to deserve this ?
---
Girlfriend is going to play with me and some old friends classic WoW. So in preparation she played some classes to see what she likes best. I think Druid is on the list for Tuesday. So jealous. Must be great to see everything for the first time :).
---
In a blizzard blue post asking people to move from full servers. Too lazy to find link.
---
1 time view and consistent viewership is not the same  
---
you're not very bright as you've shown multiple times by now
---
Neat. So there is hope after all that LFG will still work.
---
Like you never in your life spelled anything wrong. Considering the guy is not a native English speaker I'll allow it. Also I don't think there is anyone doing code review for this guy to point out these "major" problems which don't affect the functionality at all.
---
Hey Guys, 
---
First of all, I love the guide! Thanks for sharing. I dig the doc format aha. 
---
Secondly, out of curiosity are all "Speed levelers" going to try and quest despite the amount of players? On the stress tests I macro'd /Target sarkoth and cast and instant cast but still took some time. I saw some streamers group up once level 2/3 and farm the kolkar near Senjin before most people even got there - what are the alternatives speed runners look too or is it a group up and macro and hope for the best? 
---
Just curious! 
---
Hope to see you all home soon!
---
If it is a non issue so why all the casuals neckbeard gone mad for it?
---
It will kill spamthrottle style addons.
---
that's why you:  
---
1.dont click links  
---
2. invest in 2nd monitor

Is this all draw by hand? Or is it posed in a 3D program and draw over? It’s really impressive looking. I love it.

ULTIMATE Top 4 Leveling Tips for HORDE and ALLIANCE Players in CLASSIC WOW 😲😳😳😳
---
I quite literally said "I'm not sure why" in my post.
---
&gt;This addon allows auto invites to people based on role and talents  
---
so? only a fool would use it  
---
you don't want to auto invite first people to whisper you
---
Roxorz boxorz? Hax?
---
If you specialized and worked in this field for the past 12 years then why don't you know the difference between a cease and desist order and cease and desist letter ? 
---
["Blizzard won't use a ban-hammer. They will send Cease and Desist orders" - you](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cuvq2l/this_isnt_gonna_end_well/ey1edzl/) 
---
Maybe people on the internet lie sometimes ?
---
Exactly. While WoW is all about free time for us, for Blizzard employees it’s a full time job. Do you expect them to release it on Friday and simply pray the days after launch go smoothly while they’re at home on the weekend, OP?
---
I am confused with posts like this. Since when eating trash became something you can brag about? Eating something like this will actually make you weaker and tired despite your expectations, so you will leg behind the crowd, gg
---
Then fucking ignore them who the fuck cares what a fat slob neckbeard bitch thinks. So what if you have a dick and like pussy? If someone calls YOU "dude" then tell them not to call you that way because you don't like it. 
---
THATS IT FFS
---
Always go troll if you can. They are the master race.
---
im ready to guide all newcomers, this adventure is about education first and foremost.
---
There's a bunch of addons confirmed working in classic. Check out willitclassic.com
---
Yes, fall back on this as an excuse for your own shortcomings in argument. Deny, deny deny the reality of the situation.
---
oh i dont think my examples were clear enough...   
---
my program:  
---
week 1: 22  
---
week 2: 16.5  
---
week 3: 19.25  
---
week 4 : 20.625  
---
also with my system, if you have 20 dkp saved up, you take an item that raid for lets say 4 dkp and save your 18 dkp, your saved will thus be (20+18)/2, so taking items will not allow you to hoard as much dkp. The point of the system is exactly what you are saying aswell, we want someone who uses all their points for an item that specific week to have a low chance of getting another, unless nobody needs it
---
Cauthon Luck has a good undead mage 1-15 guide on youtube  aimed at launch and getting away from the masses if that's what you're after
---
Except I do, you just don’t want to admit it.
---
Exactly this. Very important to play a char you like, not what you think would please a raidleader
---
Chromie looks like Daenerys on this gif...
---
Sauce on wallpaper plox

Skinning for gold
---
Tailoring for the robe
---
Drop skinning for something else later
---
As an alliance player, the alliance to horde ratio really worries me. Discord role assignment represents almost the same ratio.
---
Darkwolfer from eu ragnaros, still haven't forgotten you buddy
---
Wow, I wish I thought of that when I was like 12.
---
Which alliance race/gender combo has the your favorite melee animations?
---
Imagine AWDS as your legs and mouse as the rest of your body. You move side ways front and back with keys and you turn with mouse. Its an easy concept once you play the game for little bit.
---
Characters like shamans with tons of totems etc will have tons of stuff fo use. But in most situations you need like 5-6 spells that you cycle through. I was part of hardcore raid in vanilla and had only like 6-7 key binds and rest i clicked with mouse and had no issues.
---
Honestly, I would say paladin. They are the mediocrity of WoW. Easy to play and have minimal spells they can use. Paladins are often judged by their abilities after 60, which are admittedly very limited, but they are a class that will force you to learn a lot of different aspects of the game from attacking, healing, CC, and buffing . They are a class that offers the novice a window to learn how to play every aspect of the game up until 60 when their position is very limited. Paladins are a great class for new people because it’s not overly difficult to play and easy to fall into any roll!
---
Hunter has the lowest skill floors but also one of the highest skill ceilings so it's kind of a double edged sword.
---
I'd actually say that Paladin is the true noob class. It was actually designed that way admitted by the team.
---
AHHHHH
---
fun is what u is missing
---
Me too mate, this time around, Ill try and get full feralheart, just because.
---
I was hoping someone would pick up on that :D
---
I'll be levelling Warrior with a Priest buddy. How much faster would a Fury spec be rather than the default Arms (pvp) levelling build?
---
There is no class that’s easy to master. However, if you plan on mastering a class then you would have to stop being a noob, so it doesn’t matter what is the easiest to master for noobs
---
NEVER!! You intruders shall be repelled from our sacred land!
---
Ye i saw but i forgot a part of my post above mb
---
Because as you said, the grownups (people at blizzard) have the weekend off and i dont think they want to work weekends more then they have to.
---
Does anyone know what the player caps are gonna be?
---
Thanks for sharing the article. Was a good read!
---
You're good.
---
 [https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/](https://legacy-wow.com/classic-addons/)
---
99% sure a hunter can do this pretty easily
---
An addon that filters the chat is one thing.
---
An addon that alienate other players that don't use it for the benefit of not batting an eye is another.
---
There is no contradiction. They are both different addons.
---
I‘ve been pugging AQ40 on my server, too. We had a pug called the „night group“ and would run at random nights. Really cool!
---
Also Dalaran could use some more meat. Then there's Kharazhan, Azshara needs more stuff too, a couple of islands eastern of Kalimdor, the Feralas Islands. There is so much stuff that could be done.
---
Both will be 55:45ish from what we’ve seen on the census and the general trends on PvP servers
---
YOU'RE NOT MY COAL MINE SUPERVISOR!
---
In an old game tibia the only way to cast spells is to type them in chat, on top of that I think they were all in latin. Also every1 who's near can see the spell words.
---
Even BFA players don't care about the "WoW eSports"
---
Or hung like a horse. Take your pick?
---
really got me at "dude ive played since legion i know how to tank"
---
8/10  lulz
---
thanks man I'm happy that you enjoy it!
---
I will strongly recomand you to use a 2 hander. Also get the addon called swing timer, then strafe kite the targets.
---
Wouldn’t it be easier just to use mouse entirely on moving and having something like q and e as your strafe so that it’s only one key under like the numbers for your abilities?
---
The 'hard to master' bit only really matters at level 60, by which point you wouldn't really be a 'noob' anymore. They're recommended to new people because they're so easy to level with.
---
If you don't like the idea of hunter regardless, Druids are really easy to level :)
---
Is this sub still going to be the classic wow sub ongoing? Once retail dies and classic takes over will the population migrate to the wow sub?
---
Packing my bags.
---
Getting on a plane 6am Monday, won't be back until Friday.
---
No launch day shenanigans for me.  Plus side is that hopefully the queues will have died by then.
---
Keto IS a nightmare
---
Yeah those number makes me want to play Alliance. Also I never played Alliance much so...
---
Vanilla is in itself an unbalanced mess. Trying to touch with that kind of stuff would break the core of the game.
---
There is no default for leveling, both are viable and have pros/cons
---
The problem with BC is that it basically removes any chance of Classic+, so I think they should consider Classic+ first and only if that doesn't work, go towards BC. Otherwise you'll have a split playerbase and some players want new content for BC, some want Classic+ and some others want Wrath.
---
I believe dude, at least with regards to linguistics, is considered a unisex way to refer to someone, and a lot of guys and girls use dude as such. HOWEVER, this isn't at all what we should be arguing here.   
---
The fact of the matter is that gaming, by and large, is a far more hostile space for women than it is for men. Often times when I play games online, I feel socially anxious and hesitant to communicate out of fear of a negative response, AND I'M A GUY.  
---
I don't know how I would be able to communicate if I were a girl in this space, with a good portion of players harboring resentment and assuming things about me just because of my gender.  I don't know if it would be worth it to queue my mic knowing the possibility that it will be met with "OMG GAMER GIRL" and much worse. Odds are that I wouldn't even bother. I'd probably feel unwelcome and not taken seriously.   
---
This being said, I do think it is a bit cynical to assume that every guy is like this. I recently played WoW with my wife on a psever, and everyone who found out that she was a girl treated her with respect, indifferent to her gender, and that's all she could ever hope for these days. But we play lots of games together, and there have been endless accounts of her being harassed, and it really bums her out each time.
---
Sorry. In my mind I was thinking that, if you are able to sit and watch a stream for hours, you’re also able to play.  
---
Alas, I see the errors of my ways.
---
&gt; You only have this 2nd chance to enjoy the game
---
some of us replayed vanilla on pservers for a long time already
---
Lucky. I am going to have to get a miracle to play for a even 30 days. let me know how good the release is.
---
A good point.
---
You absolutely can, provided you have *and maintain* a set for healing. It will get more challenging to pull off the closer you get to 60, but it can be done.
---
Just as an FYI, you won't have *all* your points in Enh anyway, and if you ask me Resto pairs better with it than Ele does. Ele is great don't get me wrong, but as Enh you're really only gonna be casting Shocks so the talents have limited use. On the other hand, Resto will give you cheaper totem casts, 33% increased friendly totem range (this is huge in groups), and 3% hit + more.
---
[Here's](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-5005230105003151-50005301) what I personally would go with, with a couple of points free to place where you want.
---
but dwarf Stoneform racial is god in PvP, especially against rogue.
---
Yeah you can see addons at the bottom left of the character screen
---
No, So i am expecting everyone to have minimum a 60mage and 60 rogue at some point.
---
You’ve got nothing to lose man. 
---
I’m willing to bet you’ll absolutely love it.
---
I remember that guy!
---
I don't worry about a realm, I will sub tomorrow and just choose one of the newest ones.
---
That's why I'm excited for Grobbulus. It's like PERFECTLY balanced, at least according to reddit polls.
---
Yes in the north west corner of the starting zone near all the pigs and sleeping orcs (west of the spawn point, not near the fimilar cave) there’s a place you can jump down into the water and get killed by a crab.
---
You will rez at ratchet and grab the flight path, from there run to cross roads and grab that flight path, then corpse hop down to thunder bluff with no gear equipped so you don’t take durability damage.
---
nnnyyaaAM OUTTA MANA i need a po
---
I'm in the same boat as you (25 now) started at the end of Lich but stopped when Warlords came out. I'm very excited to finally get a taste of what WoW was like before all the expansions :) planning on taking a nice and slow journey to experience it to its fullest.
---
Dabu.
---
join shazz ally, we still need more to beat horde asses !
---
Let's be real, group finding in classic won't be such a social experience like many are expecting. You will mindlessly spam trade chat until someone whispers you and you auto invite them.
---
Haha u dumbass. if you wanna translate the meaning of it it would be "meister des windes"
---
It's not an option on PvP servers where you can't create both alliance and horde characters, but you can do that on PvE server.
---
There wont be any Italians speaking Italian in general chat on an English server. I mean it might happen but not all the time. Never seen such thing being an issue. People joining english servers know very well they need to know at least basic knowledge of english.
---
No every one is a 35 year old vet. /s
---
20k is everyone? All those people that watched it are rolling undead too? Get real dude, 90% or more of undead players will not be following that guide.
---
Cigbritties
---
Yeah it's a full 1-60 plan that completes all rep quests at the optimum level.
---
Personally as I recall the "breadcrumb" quests for let's say desolace and generally any area level 35+ are quite literally scattered across both continents and unlike retail you simply cannot do quests without their starters from around the world. Even back in the day I had bought the Brian Kopp guide for alliance for that reason alone.
---
All things considered I'd say it's how I experienced Vanilla and I can't wait to do it again albeit on a far better computer and far better guides
---
They are not racial bound. so NO you don't have to run back to Durotar every time. :)
---
FF7R in 7 months
---
Well said
---
Zygor
---
Odd way of calling the horde tools, but I'll take it.
---
I tried a druid named Moralsupport ended with mature language message
---
they remind me of crooked politicians from shithole countries
---
they get expensive fast cars but have shitty roads to drive on
---
&gt;While I don't like the automatic invite stuff
---
It's not only about the automated stuff tho. It also alienate players who don't want to use that addon, which ultimately will take over.  
---
Back in vanilla it was a simple filter addon for the /lfg chanel.  
---
What we've seen here is an addon that acts as a LFG like in retail, which the concerns for are the ones I mentioned in our parallel discussion.
---
Didn't see that you were also trans! Sorry for getting so heated, It was more directed toward the "change appearance" thing.
---
It's not about appearance, it's about becoming the badass females we were meant to be - inside and out. Often times people just see a trans-woman as a "guy with long hair and boobs", which is why that wording kinda triggered me a little. The hormones are for more than just the physical appearance, they also give my brain the chemicals to feel more like my true self. Keep on slaying, Queen (or another position of power that doesn't include gendered language)!
---
As in Duel screen mate
---
omg this was sooooo good!!!!
---
Enjoy your dirt lands and mud huts LOL
---
Oh come on, it sounds like you're reading from a fucking script. The reason you only have white friends is because non-white people look at this sanctimonious BS, cringe, and wonder what the fuck is wrong with white people.
---
&gt;then strafe kite the targets
---
Melee leeway significantly reduces the benefit you gain from kiting a mob with or without hamstring. I.e. it's not as good as it was on private servers.
---
25% stunresist should be on top though ;)
---
*cries in OCE*
---
&gt;I do believe, for myself, that if I were to use that addon, I would be less likely to add every other player for future runs because of the inconvenience of making a group, unless they are causing wipes.
---
Well, it is most likely that it still takes a while to have a proper group together. And why would you be less likely to add someone to your friend list if you had a lot of fun together? I don't exactly understand that.
---
The only thing an addon like this does is making it easier to find the people that are interested in the same content as you. Thus you have by default a good basis to build upon.
---
It doesn't make it so easy that you got the perfect group in two minutes. You are simply skipping the chat spam step that might not even work because the people that are interested in it either don't concentrate on the chat or aren't even in the right area (except if you spam trade, which many people disable because of the spam).
---
I actually played a 60 shaman, and I can tell you it was absolutely bullshit to try and tank even easier 5-mans when you were 60. It was hard to aggro and even stay alive with Earth Shield and self healing.
---
Trust me, while we would spam LFM Tank in the chat I tried to tank to see if we could do without a Warrior and I still couldn’t sustain.
---
The only viable tank in Vanilla were Prot Warriors and you’re going to see it real soon.
---
The ARMS spec toward Sweeping Strikes (?) is supposed to be the fastest spec if you have a healer
---
Don't be stupid. Roll NEED on any gear that helps you level faster.
---
Like all of them except 1 aren't even in foil anymore, they were probably used for retail, you fraud!
---
Lekker boodschappen doen bij de lidl, niks mis mee
---
I kinda see it too lol
---
Actually it could be quantum geography as quests for higher level zones often begin across the continent
---
You asked why people don't like it. I gave you the answer. I personally don't care what is used, so long as the guild isn't greasy. DKP works fine most of the time.
---
Dwarves do get stone form which is useful in all PvP. Shadow meld is pretty situational. E.g. really good to guard the flag in WSG, assuming you also have a stealth cat.
---
I think so too. 
---
I personally ignored racial and went for races I liked aesthetically. 
---
I will probably go horde this time because A) I’ve always played alliance so I want a fresh experience and B) I want to play shaman. Shaman were amazing before where their totems were actually more than glorified cool downs and most of them were removed. 
---
So a new class and a new faction should keep this fresh :)
---
Does a pet count as help?
---
Stop threatening to not play and just don't play nobody is gonna care , nobody is gonna miss you
---
Brave comment around these parts lol
---
No, you don't, at least not for VW onwards. It *may* be different for the Imp, not sure, but you'll get that quest within your first hour anyway.
---
Come on, mate - there is a place for you in my gang for sure!
---
look, i think you have some good feedback and this comment is also that. i really appreciate you being sceptical, i'm just trying to see if my counter-arguments can hold up   
---
yes, if you have gathered up a bunch of dkp and can't join the first scheduled raid of a week, the only outcomes of joining the next one are: get nothing - or spend a lot of saved up dkp. this is only if you have a bunch of saved dkp though, otherwise it will always be a good choice to join. that being said we have already decided raid times and hopefully people who can raid those two nights of the week will join, and if you cant join both times that week someone else who actually will raid both nights can get the spot
---
Isn't this the exact picture that someone posted like a week ago with a title talking about how they were ready for classic or something?
---
My apologies, then.
---
As a Druid I use fly more often, but also panic and die a lot.
---
Ah ok i thought you needed mc mops for it
---
Food is your body dude, literally.
---
It affects your health, your energy, and even your mental.
---
Same goes for sleep, it's way more important than people think, especially when they say " I only need 4 hours, my body is used to it", so no you are not super human, you have not special body, it's just your brain that is used to be tired so it thinks it's the normal state.
---
Last point, it's a bit more of harsh truth. Look people around you, try to find fat people and old people, it's easy. Now try to find old AND fat people. Overall, you can see how people treated their body when they go old (yeah some people are unlucky and sick despite taking care of themselves, but not the majority)
---
Buuuuut, let's enjoy at least this fucking launch.
---
(Your launch doctor recommend you to stretch every 2 days of gaming and stand up during some flight )
---
Full doesn’t really mean max capacity, it means we have to wait in line, they are full because of name reservations.
---
the reason the horde outnumbers the alliance in PvP servers are because ally players are unskilled pve babies
---
that's why pve servers are 73% alliance

---
&gt;It also alienate players who don't want to use that addon, which ultimately will take over.
---
To be honest, does this really matter? If the majority like the addon, where is the big deal?
---
&gt;What we've seen here is an addon that acts as a LFG like in retail, which the concerns for are the ones I mentioned in our parallel discussion.
---
LFG like in retail won't work in vanilla anyways. You can't just throw five random people together, that would rarely work in the dungeons there.
---
Neither. Zygor is the way to go
---
Smash more puutang.
---
That's the spirit. 4 hours of sleep a day is fine right?
---
Gotta make time somewhere and those 2-3 hours of sleep I normally had could be used better, like in a dungeon or questing.
---
Almost very PvP server on EU is looking to being 55/45 in favor of the Horde.
---
Personally going Mograine. And with 1000 entries its looking around 49/51 horde favor. One of the most balanced ones.
---
Do you have any idea how difficult it would be to balance the classes as they are in classic? Has Blizz ever been able to truly balance the classes in the entire history of wow? 
---
No I do not want them to touch class balance. They would completely break pvp trying to make specs viable for pve or vice versa.
---
film her reaction after gettin cat form with... 20(?).
---
The branch shardes away
---
PLEASEEEE
---
I think it was in my Druid's bag until it was removed from the game. Too valuable to ever use!
---
In EU, they will...because it will be fucking 5 a.m. in the morning :)
---
&gt;  I think female night elf caster is really cool.
---
+1, great animations!

This is mental illness no point in arguing with it lol I checked back to see and it's still going smh

i'll have you know i played world of warcraft in 1945
---
Does anybody know if they fixed that bug where your voidwalker would unlearn all its spells and get a new name? I've seen this happening with multiple streamers in the beta.
---
Those are some Nice looking elves!

And I guess you're a guy who takes everything extremely literal.

Don't now what the list you are referring to is so maybe I misunderstood what you are looking for. Anyways I have used this page to check profession recipes, here is a list of alchemy for example:
---
 [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Classic\_alchemy\_recipes](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Classic_alchemy_recipes) 
---
 It includes TBC recipes but that classic stuff is accurate.

Uploaded for Mobile with Giphy and on Imgur just look at the Comment with all Links!

---
It was in a huge list of fixed bugs Blizzard posted a week or so ago, so should be fine now.
---
5120x1440 possible? Dual 1440p monitors
---
Every single EU EN realm will be a mix of everything.
---
&gt;An addon that alienate other players that don't use it
---
But it doesn't? If you actually took the time to check what the addon did on classic instead of looking at a scewed video of it in action ON RETAIL you'd look less dumb.
---
why dont you make some tangible suggestions? if you would know your stuff you'd know that paladins damage numbers are already pretty high. raidbuffed and full on worldbuffs + consumables they already crit for 3k SoC and ridiculously high white damage. 
---
to make hybrids viable you dont need to change their numerical values, you just need to give them perfect itemization. but thats not possible because you cant have an item with the spellpower and int of cloth, the agi of leather, the str and armor of plate while also providing secondary stats like hit, crit, attackpower and mp5. this is called the hybrid tax and without it we wouldnt be playing classic but rather another iteration of retail wow themepark
---
Sorry im unfamiliar, it stops mounts from being able to fly?
---
I think children’s week was also there for a really long time and brewfest? Not sure either tho
---
The twitch addon are great for retail too and for what I done with classic so far, it's fine for that too.
---
If you didn't know, twitch app is litterly just curse client. It was sold, updated and changed.
---
Same here
---
Eastern Europeans will mostly go Golemagg it seems.
---
Personally going Mograine with Scandinavians/English/Dutch. Aka, 3 big parties who speak english perfectly.
---
In all of the replies you are saying "we" I'd like to remind you you're a man  not a woman ... You sound rediculous
---
You will probably be able to join them but it's likely that you will end in a massive queue. However Blizzard is opening some new servers on Monday, so I would (I will myself) roll on one of those servers.
---
I tested it yesterday. Worked great. I didn't even have to manually select my classic folder which I assumed. Just downloaded it, started it up and it recoqnised most of my addons. Have used it a couple of times already to update them.
---
Honestly, with tanks having 14% parry, that the ret paladin behind him didn't have to deal with? I think this adds viability to the ret paladins because everyone is going to be threat capped.
---
&gt; And why would you be less likely to add someone to your friend list if you had a lot of fun together? 
---
Because you don't necessarily have a blast playing with them in that particular run. You may just clear it as you would, without any interaction going on at all.  
---
It may take few runs to have a proper chat or "open up" to people. Which is easier to do when you encounter them more frequently (proven psychology).  
---
&gt; The only thing an addon like this does is making it easier to find the people that are interested in the same content as you. 
---
Which results in an easier time forming groups, and like i mentioned sometime above, harder grouping makes for an incentive to make friends in order to reduce downtime in forming groups, regardless if you have fun with them in that particular run.
---
I don't see how those are disputable.
---
Such great work
---
Hi guys,
---
The next couple of months I’m doing my thesis so I will only be able to play maybe one or two evenings a week and then the whole sunday.
---
I was a warrior back in vanilla and would like to make an exact copy of him, however me being busy and all, I looked at all the cons of a warrior: slow to level, no gold farming method at 60, hard to gear up in pre-raid BiS etc. However mage or hunter is the exact opposite of the above - I would probably get more bang for my buck when I finally have time to play the game with one of these classes, plus mages are always welcome in raids as far as I know.
---
So I guess my question is this: is it viable to play and enjoy a warrior with limited time? Also busy people: what thoughts have you made on class vs busy schedule?
---
Notes: I will level up with friends, I have played a warrior on a private server so I am not totally in the dark, I will have about 14 days to no-life before the semester starts.
---
Bag sellers make bank....always a market.
---
If you dont love healing you can always play shadow priest
---
I’ve never used questie. Is it possible to only have map markers for quest pickups and turn ins? Basically I still want to have to find where to go to complete the quest, I just don’t want to have to wander around looking for the actual quests.
---
the search feature seems to not work at times, other then that the twitch client works fine for me
---
I’m surprised how big the hype has gotten for me. At first I was kinda on the fence. I remember classic foundly but some stuff like the super long levelling kept me from wanting to play. Then the beta started and more hype came. Not playing turned into “let’s give it a look for old times sake”. Now I’m sitting here waiting not wanting to play anything else
---
Using your keyboard to turn is around the same tier as clicking your skills. Definitely get used to strafing with a/d and turning with your mouse.
---
&gt; LFG addon that Classic needed
---
kind of a strawmanish post considering most people I talked to were mostly mad about the auto invite part of the addon. Like you intentionally go out of your way to insult people upset about this but then when you mention the part that people are actually upset about you make sure to type **in bold** that you disagree with it.
---
nolifers dont hog dkp, those shitty braindead people wo get carried hog dkp
---
Worse case scenario it's one less person in the queue, win win :)
---
&lt;3 all you healers out there!
---
Please don’t feel like an outlier. There will be a lot of people playing for the first time. The game is very social and you won’t need LFG. People will always be looking for party members. Usually if you join /lfg or even go to a capital there’s always people spamming chat for others to run things with.
---
I understand all that but I still trust them to get the effect they want. You can do anything you want with software engineering. The way the system works now is only how they made it work.
---
No, Herod has the same problem Shazzrah has. There were just too few servers early on and people are stubborn so they will refuse to move.

---
No talents will not change during the life of classic, they are being released in and locked in their 1.12 state.  Mutilate was added in the TBC pre-patch.  It is not yet determined what happens after phase 6.
---
Hey is the ret Really as bad as they said it was in pve ( dungeons and raid)
---
Your not alone. Unfortunately you have us.
---
Druids are definitely true neutral.
---
Alignment is often looked at from a human standpoint, and Druids care more for nature than fellow man.
---
If a Druid has to make a choice between betraying Druidic law / nature, or saving thousands of people... it would be Anathema for them to save those people. (Breaking them off from being a Druid)
---
In a human’s eyes, who just had his entire city wiped out, that would be a act of evil. (Even If of the lands view, it would be a good act)
---
Priest’s shadow spec “mind damaging/manipulation” isn’t evil. They use it (especially in WoW lore wise) to do what others are afraid/incapable of doing and be the defense for those who cannot. Some do delve far to deep into shadow and betray this principle. But the general “shadow priest” is using such methods to protect and safeguard, being a force of good, not evil.
---
Warlocks are chaotic. Demons are literally “a force of chaos” they make a contract, indeed. With chaos itself. That doesn’t make them lawful. Especially as they (and the demons) constantly work to find ways to bend and break said contract. They are the opposite of mages (for warcraft) who study great discipline to control their power.  Warlocks just gain it and don’t care if it’s controlled or not (who it harms).  WoW warlocks would be “seem” by the general eye as chaotic evil.  In reality, they are 50/50 chaotic neutral / chaotic evil. As some do it for protecting people, others however do it for self power (at the cost of others)

It's off the top of my head, I even missed a word! Thanks for your comments.

Every Raid needs a nightfall wielder!

you need FI for tanking for sure, if you are not raid tanking TH isn't necessary but helps s yon , if you are maiming for pvp, ill advice to pick FI

Sorry Ô great male gamer, thank you for correcting me with your immense knowledge, for I have sinned.
---
why are you hoarders still have all the junk from years ago? throw ur stuff away already
---
Find a warrior, Hold hands until the end of days as you both level much much faster.
---
I played it for 6 months or so, have all the free daily subs on my account for server outages, then I came back in wrath.
---
It's been a regret for years that I stopped so soon into vanilla, that's why I am so excited this time around
---
I played WoW for about 12 years. I have never had any IRL friends that played it. Now I have 2 IRL friends that are joining me for Classic. It's awesome.
---
Thats true, you can never have too much storage.
---
I definitely will!
---
Ohhh okay. You are particularly talking about the pinboard here, right?  
---
First;
---
&gt; Automated matchmaking like in retail won't work in vanilla anyways 
---
That was the point of that LFG addon. It can work tho.  
---
As to the pinboard/ filter addon, i have nothign against it.
---
Not bad at all. In fact that was my first toon.
---
The beginning of the end.
---
I can't wait to get Org back!

---
It'll be me and my mom. Wish the rest of the family was up for it since playing games together is fun when university and work keeps us busy enough to not meet up that much IRL.
---
Only got to 30 in vanilla at 14 years old. I really started about 4 or 5 months before wrath hit. I loved bc, I hope they eventually bring some tbc servers, I'd live to actually experience going through everything current.
---
Flying out from Amsterdam soon. Will be home before launch
---
urgh
---
Like I mentioned in my own comment, I'm desensitized to being called dude/man/guy and I don't really care too much about it. I have a degree in linguistics. I've debated the topic in classrooms. Truthfully at this point, I know it'll be possible to change the public perception of the terms. The real problem is the severe transphobia and gender-directed hostility that is being shown in this thread.
---
Also, just because something is a non-issue for you doesn't mean it's a non-issue for everyone. I'm still not saying we should just police our language because of this, but clearly, there's a greater problem here that far surpasses just "oh shucks, they called me a boy again! :( " 
---
There's a serious lack of empathy and respect here for this member of our community who just wanted to voice her opinion. If this doesn't feel disappointing and disheartening for you, well shit. Idk what to tell you.
---
"When hell freezes over"
---
It's a totally different game, have fun with it.
---
It's not really hard to reach 60, it's just time consuming unless you're going hardcore. But that's not what vanilla is about, most people will just enjoy the dungeon experience while leveling. Doing SM runs was some of the most enjoyable parts of the game for me when I played back in the day.
---
End game content isn't the sole focus on Classic IMO. It's nostalgia comes from the community aspect, gear acquisition, the farming/gathering, economy, etc. All of these things combined make your character feel like an actual extension of yourself and your play time.
---
&gt;what gives the game this hype.
---
Video games released today are absolute garbage compared to video games released in the 90's/early00's. They felt "different", it's impossible to imagine for the younger generations, but anyone over thirty understands. Classic WoW felt like a real MMO experience, something retail doesn't really encapsulate.
---
Deception.
---
Ret paladins are garbage just stop
---
I played classic, but dind't understand English at the time (25 now). Had to constantly ask my mom and brothers to help me find quest objectives. By the time I was 12 though, my English was the best of all my classmates. Got to 40 with a NE hunter, because Legolas ofc. Grinded a lot and didn't know pet training was a thing 😅
---
Why? Chuck Norris did it..so you can do it too :O
---

---
Paladin is the easiest to master.
---
Not as poor as druids being tanks... Or destro locks dps.
---
Ikr? Bouncy elves
---
Which race should I make as a mage? or are they not really significant? Never played any wow before. I usually like the pvp aspect in mmos a lot more than PvE.
---
I don’t think anyone is wondering that
---
how much were the different starting zones changed in cata?
---
i only played a couple of hours on classic, cant have been more then 5 hours, when i was over at a friends house. it was great but we couldn't afford wow at home at that time so that's all i ever played of classic. i remember being so exited to play its unreal. i woke up that sleepover at 6 to go downstairs and play on my friends computer till breakfast on Sunday. i also didn't know any English at the time so it was all exploration, dwarf hunter i believe  
---
anyway, me not that kinda orc, horde 4 life now
---
I started playing wow at the beginning of TBC when I was about 10 years old. The only opportunity I had to play was at my neighbors house because we had dial up internet and a terribly slow PC at our place. We would spend hours playing WoW in the summers during sleepovers. Super hyped to be able to go back for Classic and play the game properly.
---
his MAAAAAAAM
---
did you just assume their species?
---
Dude I have been excited for years. When my latest study schedule came out and i realised my exams would end just before (literally 2 days ago) launch, i was beyond excited. I have literally been able to use the thought of launch to motivate me through both the study and life, knowing that if i nail it and irl is sorted, i get to focus on wow. It's worked tremendously well
---
Will the STV Fishing contest be out first Sunday of Launch? I have seen mixed responses on Reddit before about this but nothing definitive.
---
Still a quicker dev cycle then Star Citizen
---
The addon is still working in case you dont know, Blizzard will remove the autojoin autoinvite and anything isnt filtering the chat like CTA or Vqueue
---
Thank you v much. I've done this, and will go to one on Tuesday. My biggest fear is I'll never be back to normal again.
---
"must be bugged"
---
haha yeah idiot i know who you are
---
nice one
---
You need to have that addon installed in order to be invited. That was what the addon in the BETA did.
---
undead mage for horde~
---
NumbMango the mage loved your poem a lot,

---
Because women are made invisible in online gaming and we're otherised by people who think girls don't have a place in their communities.
---
And because people assume everyone else is a guy, said guys end up not even realising that there are actually many girls who play or would like to play, but end up hiding or leaving altogether because of how unwelcoming gaming communities are towards us.
---
So I guess I'll rephrase your question: why does it matter to welcome women in games?
---
You're free to make your own answer on that one, but I do hope you think it matters to not gatekeep 50% of the world's population out of your hobby.
---
Most people you talked with seems to have only watched a skewed video instead of actually testing it.
---
It is a relic of an old system scrapped I think in late beta, maybe early post launch vanilla.  
---
Weapon skills need to be trained and leveled up by preforming attacks with those weapons.  Early on spell schools worked in a similar way where a caster would need to level their respective talent tree. 
---
After they scrapped it, you just automatically get those skill points automatically.
---
" When looking for people it will periodically write in a public channel  of your choice to make people without the Addon aware of the group."
---
&gt;That was the point of that LFG addon. It can work tho. 
---
Technically it can work, yes. But you are missing the entire process of picking the right classes or people. You are automatically thrown in with four others you might know nothing about. The chance is high that you won't even make it to the first boss in Scholomance and the likes.
---
Oof.
---
Is that an elf paladin?!? In MY classic?!?!?
---
Resilience made pvp very interesting. With the power of pve equip and lack of resilience, everyone was instant killing everyone. The main problem was that resilience made pve equip trivial for the most part. (At least in tbc) With the high stats spikes we will see in naxx, one of the way to prevent zerg fiesta is to add some sort of resilience for upcoming items in classic+. I think its very good stat, but it has to be added in pve items as well
---
... Then which play button are we talking about here?
---
Advertising to public channels is entirely optional in the current version of the addon.  See my other comment ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cv6jqo/the_rclassic_hypocrisy_about_lfg_addon/ey281up/)).
---
Pfttt, they all about that lettuce brah.
---
virgin-hancment players will soon be pulled back into reality :')
---
Is there a way to search for patch 1.13, when I select my classic wow version it also shows addons for patch 8.x?
---
A macro wouldn’t work because you need to feign death first to be able to use traps. But the whole concept should work fine
---
I feel this
---
you see me Trolling, they hating
---
The majority of players don’t like the idea of it existing including me and blizzard does not like it either so stfu about it already blizzard has spoken if you want LFG go play retail
---
I understand addon like this existed but, no one ever really used them it was not a norm like it is today.
---
If given the opportunity people that don’t want the vanilla social interaction will opt to use this AddOn and it’s not deemed in the social Spirit of vanilla according to devs
---
I'll vendor the leather and use the ore myself.
---
Just skip thick hide entirely. Its almost useless.
---
That last panel is so MFW.

---
Thank god they mentioned tbc
---
5 more servers for EU (4 pvp 1 pve) and 4 more servers for US (2 pvp 2 pve)
---
nah, it made people take so little damage from others in normal gear, it was like fighting a boss. Keep it the vanilla way.
---
Actually I tested yesterday on retail and I got 170 but maybe thats how much I'd get on good days.
---
&gt;Rips open the asshole
---
Fuck sake. That got me good!
---
oh ur right
---
The addon creator said he wouldnt have the auto invite feature in the classic version of the addon 4 days ago.
---
But i guess its easier for people to get triggered by the term "LFG-addon".
---
Same here :(
---
Exam on the 28th
---
You're right. I mixed up my decimal places. Thanks for the correction.
---
It just says install if you have not installed retail.
---
Blizzard really needed to lower their carbon footprint. Look at all that plastic for a fucking pre payment card.
---
Sure, resized with hopefully not too much loss in quality:

force of character, determination, or nerve.

"when you've got the moxie, you need the clothes to match"

Or maybe the brand of soft-drinks by the same name.

Shit dude why didn't I think of that it's so obvious.

real talk i wouldnt have said that if getting a job was something i could just do or haven't been trying to do for the past 4 months.

Get Questie add-on if you want this

No. I don't want that.

---
I'm Jazz Ally men!!
---
I am so jelly right now. Wish i could do the same with a few friends.
---
Sure thing for people who know it like us. Just wanted to let others know that there is more to it.
---
Done it once, 100% doing it again.
---
Nice. Exactly. Thank you.
---
Way better, Idk why warlocks would be lawful evil lol.
---
OK- I'LL STOP USING WHAT TERMS MEAN IF YOU STOP SUCKING ON BLIZZARDS DICK.  DEAL??
---
Huge osrs fan and guna hop on classic wow tomorrow. I never played is there a huge difference between races/classes and are they all viable? Don’t wanna fuck up and make a mediocre account from the start
---
No, enchanting is an expensive profession to level and it doesn't give you much benefit if you don't intend to keep it till endgame. If you want a profession to drop it later for engineering I would pick one of the gathering professions.
---
Mankrik: You took everything from me.
---
Thalnos: I don't even know who you are.
---
Mankrik: You will.
---
"Right?...."
---
&gt;The main problem was that resilience made pve equip trivial in pvp for the most part. (At least in tbc)
---
agreed, that's why I'd rather not see it return. Maybe if it comes on pve items too, but I'd rather not have it return at all tbh
---
UWU WHATS THIS, RAWR
---
Both are good:
---
Nelf can defend the flag room of WSG or control points of AV/AB thanks to shadow meld + having a cat pet (they come with Stealth)
---
Dwarf can pop Stoneform to get rid of that pesky Crippling Poison and actually allow you to 'sometimes' escape rogues (it wont always be enough, if they have engineering and/or Cooldowns up you re still fcked)
---
Lol I’m just teasing looks like he is wearing the Dk lookalike helm from naxx so yeah 2008-09 sounds about right :)
---
'and now you can only get it with a preorder'
---
'there are codes now'
---
So yeah.. In present tense, you said you could and couldn't get it.
---
Try to get your facts straight before arguing and avoid looking like a dick.
---
the last time i watched there were 3 rogues in each group. yesterday i just had a glimpse and saw 3 demonhunters in the same group...
---
it fucking sucks
---
I'm sure others have said the same, but using strafe + mouse is by far easier and faster once you get used to it.  And you'll get the hang of it very quickly, unbind the turn keys asap and forget they were ever there.
---
For keybinds, I personally like to move them so that esfd are my move keys.  That opens another line of keys to use with the pinky.  Then I bind ctr to my mouse thumb button, so you can use stuff like a, alt-a, ctr-a for different things like small heal, medium heal, big heal.  You'll use a lot of binds, but it seems harder than it is really.  Since you'll keep most of your spells/abilities bound to the same buttons as you go, and use them hundreds and hundreds of times while leveling, it gets to be second nature.  You can leave some as clickers...like buffs or foods etc...but for combat stuff it really makes a difference if you just start using binds asap.  It'll feel more comfortable in no time, just make yourself do it and it'll make your experience much better in the long run.
---
You must either be living in a cartoon house or freakishly tall.
---
how dare you
---
Dude if you’re confident and find a good seller I bought my PC for £450 second hand and it’s a bit of a beast absolutely no qualms with it whatsoever. 
---
Have a browse on gumtree and stuff you can get a lot with that kind of money.
---
If only we could have actual backpacks. 
---
I know "no changes" and yadda yadda, but I'd love it if they'd add some smaller RPG visual elements like being able to toggle a backpack onto our backs, or needing to go to a town and clicking on a lamp to receive a "lamp buff" for an hour or so that allows you to properly see in the dark places. It'd add a layer of flavour, I think.
---
You mean you found it terrible, I liked it
---
Warlocks aren’t evil. They eschew traditional routes of studying the arcane in favor of drawing their power from nefarious sources. It’s not evil. They enslave demonic entities and then use their power for good.
---
That world was called nostralus.
---
Is it even worth trying to AoE level at launch as a mage on a pvp server? Feel like most places will be busy and when they’re not I’ll prolly be getting ganked.  Should I just go single target spec? I’ll be playing fairly casually so no chance at getting ahead of people.
---
I like how a bunch of well edited optimizing spreadsheets are flying by and i'm currently thinking: *"yeah, but i'm probably just gonna hit a dog and hope it drops the meat for my quest only to realize I need the other brown doggo"* till I hit 60
---
Such a joke if they really think the “new” servers are gonna be empty or die. Look what’s become of any server they’ve rolled out after the originals...
---
"hey man i really like doing heroin and i tried it multiple times already but im really scared i will be addicted if i try it again"
---
Yep don’t get it, I’m actually going opposite route, Slimfast Shakes! They actually curb your appetite and give you tons of energy and a crap load of vitamins.
---
But isn't fall damage in classic way less than it is now?
---
If you came to play classic expecting anything remotely close to a balanced game, you are mistaken.
---
Can anyone please confirm, that you don’t have to log into a bank alt to receive mail on it? Forgot to test during stress test.
---
Alliance on Whitemane. You've breathed your last, scum!
---
If your goal is just to make money then go for gathering professions but if it’s to be functional or help you or your guild then just start with tailoring and enchanting. Both will be really useful early game wise cause you can get an early wand with enchanting and from what I’ve seen there aren’t too many cloth drops on mobs so tailoring will help with giving you upgrades and also bags for some easy money
---
Huh? Resil is what made PvP, PvP. Atleast in my eyes.
---
No changes except for what I want changed in expansions that were more popular than vanilla
---
Nice design. What program did you use to make this?
---
At my place, what time you want her back?
---
This is correct. Recasting Banish on a banished target would just give an “immune” message and do nothing. I don’t think you could un-banish things this way until much later, I want to say it happened in Cata.
---
So basicly ret is bad and i should probely find Another class to mail

---
I was on the fence with what to accompany tailoring with. 
---
From what I gather, a gathering (lol) profession may be the way forward unless you plan to play a bit hardcore as enchanting will be expensive to level and to make money off it at 60 you'll need rare recipes which from raiding, which you'll have a lot of competition for / or it could be promised to someone.
---
Personally gonna go for skinning, im going lock so I think it lends well to farming soul shards but if not I'd be tossing up between skinning and herbalism. 
---
Everything I've read says to just vendor your leather as you level for extra income.
---
Man I'm on a fence in between mage and warlock, I already created both as forsaken, which one would you pick and why.
---
Hmm well first off everything should be taken with some suspicion since it is on a private server. That said I do remember some talent restoring happiness with mend pet, i believe, maybe i am so wrong about this. Might have been a different expansion even.
---
Basically pet happiness is a combination of loyalty and feeding. The higher the loyalty the slower the drop in happiness. The better the food quality, the better the happiness gain. I never found happiness to be that big of an issue. Just keep 2 stacks of food and it will be fine.
---
As a mage can i macro my frostbolt to my mousewheel so i can use 1 hand to scratch my bumhole 24/7?
---
Food - who needs it! 😂🤣
---
Only 100 times?!? PEASANT!
---
Lots of ppl made their start in wow by experimenting and rerolling. Your first going will be very slow. Take your time, enjoy the experience. You can't pick a bad class, there are none. You can pick a role you prefer, like heal, tank, dps . There are tons of guides for this. A lot of the comments here about best this or that are very much minmaxing. If you care about that then my answer is still that there are no bad classes in wow.
---
I mean, you can look up builds, but you can respec along the way. However, I'm pretty new so I'm not sure how the respecing is earned. All I know is that you can.

Well, the way I've always interpreted those bags was that we'd have a backpack on us and a pouch or two. The rest would be strapped to our mount's saddle, since it's very rare that you'd get more than small pouches early on before you obtain a mount, you know? Early bags aren't called backpacks after all. They're satchels and pouches, something you can tack onto your actual backpack or onto your girdle.
---
&gt; Cause everyone I know &lt; 30 speaks English just fine
---
I advise you to step outside your bubble a bit. This holds true for bigger cities, especially big university cities with a lot of educated people but this is absolutely not true for smaller cities that still have a striving Schützenverein scene and a large population that is uneducated. My girlfriend does not speak German and so I have first hand experience how it is.
---
Oh I know, but this particular issue is annoying because race choice is supposed to be a choice
---
thank you :D
---
played it to rank 10 with unstoppable force, loved every minute of it &lt;3
---
Is as a spriest really that hard to get gear for shadow since you literally can't raid? I want to play spriest for PVP but I'm kinda scared about raid situation so i will probably end as another mage ;/
---
World of Warcraft: Bannerlord
---
I’m a little confused if you use mouse and strafe keys, why even have move on efsd. Thank you tho everything you said helped a lot
---
35hrs left! We have come so far, dont go crazy now in this last stretch.
---
Maybe best to go outside n sleep as much as you can.-
---
Go kiss n chill with girlfriend if you have one, since soon she will be feeling very ignored.
---
Where does it show 50% haven't subscribed?
---
Even the french servers in EU now show High and full ....
---
A bit confused: is this guide different from your sub guide? And in what way?
---
I am confused by this. It says 23:00 Tuesday (the 27th) for UK?
---
Wasn't decursive used in fight not before? Doesn't feel like the same.
---
Common words make great names. In fact most cultures have relatively limited lists of names or name-elements compared to their general vocabulary. There are only so many one, two, and three syllable combinations that sound "name-like" to a person with a certain native language, plus the number of non-name words or modified words that seem like they could be used as fantasy names.
---
"Unique" names that don't mean anything are less memorable, and despite their supposed uniqueness all sort of blend together in my imagination into generic fantasy name \#1, generic fantady name \#2, generic fantasy name \#23450, etc. Anybody can mash letters together until they find something pronounceable, that doesn't make it a good name.
---
At this point it's hard to tell if serious or a satire cringe post.
---
If you are able to log in and even move, you will be having a better time then the people who joined the original launch of vanilla.
---
Since they are probably using the exact same servers, expect to log in, wait for an hour que time (if your lucky) and then spend the next 4 hours trying to move from the starting point, let alone starting zone.
---
-cheers
---
Use e forward, s strafe left, f strafe right, d back(Don't walk back when trying to fight mostly, but I use it for short moves to line mobs up in pve)  The right mouse button to move the camera.  Like one of the other posters said, I think of efsd as my legs kind of.
---
Depends what you like dude. 
---
Imo rogues are most fun overall but there will be many of them so big competition. 
---
Warlocks - super fun to level, super fun on dungeons, boring on raids, but not that popular class and very needed on raids. 
---
Mage is imo most fun to level but boring on instances and raids. But people will like you if you will make teleports and food for them. Druid is fun tu level and raid and deffenetly needed for dungeons and raids because can heal.
---
Sure, but they did say they would break addons like this when they announced the game. Your argument gave us retail as is.
---
Most of the hate on hunters is because they are considered a “noob” class but can be tricky to master so people flame them for messing up, rogues well... rogues just like to 100-0% you before you can break CC so there’s that
---
I did 80% of a raid encounter like that in WotLK when my mouse died mid-fight
---
At least in Vanilla I don’t remember anything about chaos magic in their skill set
---
&gt;  his pet dies several times and it regains green hapiness automatically while he is recharging mana.

&gt; ​
---
&gt; How is this possible?
---
which i answered, because, i watched the video, seen the date and know how the fucking game works.
---
no
---
Yeah, people don't really join RP realms for hardcore raiding. On my Vanilla RP realm, there were very few guilds who were even pushing into Naxx. I can't recall if anyone actually cleared it before TBC.
---
Death to all striders!
---
so since i dont see em i assume they arent working?
---
Me and my friend were really hoped for it and even ordered the collector's edition for like 100€. And then the game was insane flop. It was such a big disappointment.
---
Jokes on them i grabed my name's and my sub ran out on the 17th. And I ain't subbing again until 2morrow
---
All I can offer is the patch note description. I honestly don't remember what occurred on the holidays.
---
Compiled from wikis, gamepedia, and Classic Wowhead:
---
Patch 1.2 Feast of Winter Veil  
---
The holidays are here and the citizens of Azeroth are celebrating the occasion with festive decorations and winter time activities. Keep an eye out for some fun and exciting surprises throughout the world!
---
Patch 1.3 Noblegarden  
---
(Couldn’t find a summary from old patch notes.)
---
Patch 1.4 Children’s Week  
---
Children’s Week is celebrated in Orgrimmar and Stormwind City at the start of May and lasts for a week. It is a time to give back to the innocents of war: the orphans!
---
Patch 1.6 Darkmoon Faire  
---
A gathering of the exotic from around the world and beyond, Silas Darkmoon has brought together the Darkmoon Faire as a celebration of the wondrous and mysterious found in Azeroth. While the Faire spends most of their time in parts unknown, they do stop from time to time in Mulgore and Elwynn forest. When the faire is on its way barkers will stop by Ogrimmar and Ironforge to announce its arrival.
---
Patch 1.7 Stranglethorn Fishing Tournament  
---
The Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza is a grand new event set along the coasts of Stranglethorn Vale. Early on the appointed day, friendly neighborhood goblins will visit Ironforge and Orgrimmar to inform aspiring anglers of the grand tournament and give instructions. At the appropriate time, the shout will ring out across Stranglethorn to bait your hooks and cast your lines!
---
Patch 1.7 PvP holidays for bonus honor  
---
Battleground “holidays” have been added to Warsong Gulch, Alterac Valley and Arathi Basin. Holidays occur during most weekends, starting on Thursday night at midnight and continuing until Tuesday morning. During a holiday, emmissaries from that Battleground will be found in the major cities, and honor/faction rewards for performing objectives in that battleground are increased.
---
Patch 1.8 Hallow’s End  
---
When the decorations of Hallow’s End light up Azeroth’s cities, you know there’s mischief afoot! Seek special vendors in Orgrimmar or Ironforge and get your hands on treats! Aid a sick orphan in a little trick-or-treating! Deathcaller Yanka, attending the Forsaken’s Wickerman Festival, and Sergeant Hartman of Southshore are seeking your aid in keeping the enemy out of their holiday affairs – are you up to the challenge?
---
Patch 1.9 Love is in the Air  
---
Are you looking for love? All of Azeroth soon will be! As winter draws to a close the races are starting to seek that special someone. Be on the lookout for amorous individuals! Put on that special perfume or cologne, express your love, and receive gifts in return! Prepare yourself… love will soon be in the air!
---
Patch 1.11 Midsummer Fire Festival  
---
The Harvest Festival is possibly in there, as I found some notes in the wiki about the holiday being on October 6, 2006 coinciding with the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival/ Korean Chuseok, but I can’t be sure.
---
The Lunar Festival is possibly in there, as I found some notes in the wiki about the holiday being on January 29, 2006 coinciding with the Chinese Lunar New, but I also can’t be sure.
---
Nonfaction requires exalted.
---
You sound just like my situation. But we have a gazillion weekends to make up for it so I'll just have to wait
---
If i make it to 1am ill be pleased with myself haha
---
11pm launch here in the uk
---
You heard downranking was good so you put 10 ranks of moonfire on your bar?
---
No. &gt;:)
---
Even as I roll a Holy Paladin: No.
---
Blizzard take employee work/life balance pretty seriously.
---
benzo=/=ampethamine tho
---
I'll do the same I think
---
This is beautiful
---
i think they mean s7 and 8 and not 5+6.  But I would argue S8 was wildly broken with LSD and turtle cleave (hunter+prot war)
---
*Twitches*
---
So maybe the answer is to play as a healer during phase 1, to get in a guild and then as a reward they will take ma for raids when I finally re spec into shadow ;D
---
Scribbles of a decrepit mind crumbling to pieces as an aged, charred sheet of paper.
---
Anyone else spotting the Majoras Mask?
---
Cracks me up how that girl who posted a shopping cart full of red bull, pepsi, and beer got 2.5k+ upvotes and gilded - and you're getting trashed
---
Yeah I shoulda been more specific. The current meta is balls. Balance in dungeons is mega jank. The first MDI of BFA was cool as shit though.
---
Ok but what about the gnolls in Westfall who stand in packs of three and run at low health towards others?
---
literally the only use for sentry totem and they took it away.... wtf
---
yes, but most guilds will give it to warrior
---
Sounds like you’ve never encountered defias pillager. The deadliest mob in wow.

I think so, actually.  I am in Russia until next summer and paying the Russian rate, so I think I'm locked in there (even though I have an EU buddy in Spain from playing... elsewhere).
---
I wish quests had voice acting but there’s way to many for that. I’d like to read them all and understand them but I never end up doing it.
---
Are you a racist or a pedo or a 4chan "edge lord" who hates the Spanish?
---
If yes Shazz
---
If no, literally anywhere else
---
I know nothing about retail so idk how it is now
---
Uhhh not really. Little bit.
---
Better racials for duels or 1v1s.
---
Alliance has paladins which are a huge advantage in group pvp though.
---
This was recommended as it can save some milliseconds in between casting and maximize your dps. I even recall my guild master suggested us buying moused with scroll wheels that had like a thousand ticks when you scroll it once instead of the ones with like ~20 ticks.
---
I absolutely agree. I just remember that encounter. It was one of my first encounters with other folks in vanilla.
---
Spell weavers turban is part of the 1.10 update if I’m not mistaken.
---
I’m looking to bolt it from the moment login lights up. How early before launch do I need to begin pushing through the realm list or is there gonna be lots of login crashes. Haven’t played a launch since cata so I don’t know what to expect from blizzard these days
---
Good way for an AH bot to get your stuff too.
---
Smash the gnome
---
You will probably end up going to the Barrens as you level anyways so I wouldn't worry about that. It might be worth it to go and do quest in Mulgore/Durotar (including starter areas) before you over-level the zone for extra rep with Thunder Bluff/Darkspear Tribe. 
---
Ogrimmar rep should be an issue as I believe there are quite a more quests that go towards this reputation.
---
My wife will become a Warcraft widow
---
Think you meant non-player? :p

If they care so much they can take time off like everyone else that plans on playing. I don’t get why you feel the need to virtue signal for them anyway.

r/noisycomments
---
Why should they get priv over us because they stream? Who cares they can wait like the rest of us
---
Wow, do you think that will be possible in Classic?
---
Orcs have 25% resist to stun. That's pretty strong.
---
But play what you wanna play bro.
---
Serpent sting is a bitch. although hunters arent much of a problem for a good shadowpriest but in bg's they are just a pain with someone healing them.
---
Do slow weapons matter for an enhancement shaman?
---
Many resources I read state that you should get a weapon as slow as possible, possibly with speed of 3.80. But then there are resources that talk about weapon speed normalization and how weapon speed does not matter after it. I'm confused.
---
Exactly. No one ever does. After about an hour you're burnt out.
---
So I remember this level 60 night elf rogue that I came across in iron forge. Who mentioned I didn’t have the dagger that drops off the elementals in gnomergan. He took me there and decided to run run with me even though he could use his mount. He ran me through it multiple times and finally got it. He said add me to your friends list. He messaged me when I was level 38 I think and said hey let me know when you ding 40. I messaged him at 40 and he showed up and gave me the gold I needed for my mount. Didn’t ever hear or see him again. If you’re reading this and it was you. I thank you.
---
I always liked the idea of balancing classes in classic with gear. Having set pieces that aren't so specific or just more diverse like in the case of shaman where basically every tier set is designed for healers.
---
you never know...
---
I think a lot of us feel that way. We've waited years for this and now that it's suddenly upon us it feels a little surreal. It's almost a feeling of intimidation, and disbelief that this momentous occasion is just around the corner. 
---
Tomorrow night, at 11pm GMT, I get to relive some of the happiest years of my life and create even more memories with friends that I haven't played games with in over a decade. 
---
I cannot wait.
---
ah yes, base an entire wow server on 20 discord neets

tell me what server you're playing on so I can avoid it

Thanks! I shall check it out.

---
Haha but honestly in your situation I’d go rogue, they are a little stronger in the very beginning although mages aren’t far behind.
---
Yes 100%
---
Orc best pvp racial hands down (30% stun resistance)
---
Undead will of the forsaken good luck alliance warlocks
---
Nah imagine the uproar

&gt;v a s t m a j o r i t y. Uh, I'm sure there are a lot of gay/bi men and women in the Classic that would beg to differ.
---
Holy shit you're dumb (no offense). Vast majority of men are straight, vast majority of players are male. I would also argue from anecdotal evidence that even proportionally, gays are less likely to be hardcore gamers because of how homophobic the gaming community is. 
---
But even if we assumed that gays/bi were as likely to be gamers, straight males would still be the vast majority.

Cheers, yeah I think I will have to run through the list again and make sure i didnt catch the 1.10 items
---
The priest bc that looks like melee cleave
---
&gt;Simple; the extreme ease of finding another group using that addon.. Why would i bother adding every other person if they are so very replaceable?
---
Oh, I don't know, maybe because you had fun with them and want to play with them again? You are acting like other people are just some kind of ... thing.
---
PvE server
---
More like ready for diabetes
---
Because they want a full work force around when they launch as it’s sure to be a hectic time and require a lot of attention on their part.
---
The issue isn't about being paid. It's about it being free for years and literally 1 week before classic launches they add a paywall. I understand him adding a donation button and you can donate if you feel like it helped out but adding a paywall is scummy.
---
The guide is also out there, It's LITERALLY easier to pirate Jaona's guide than it is to pay for it. It makes 0 sense to me.
---
Raging at a bot. Just because something sounds like something else doesn't mean you should type it like so. Learn to spell.

World record is 4D 20H and you think you can do it in under 4D? I don’t think so.

Join the LFG channel in the Classic WoW discord.

I joined a pretty neat guild full of oldsters like me.  It's great.
---
&gt; is there a huge difference between races/classes
---
they all have different "racial abilities," some of which are fairly powerful depending on what class you want to play (what class do you want to play?) and some of them are conspicuously strong in pvp (undead, gnome, dwarf)
---
&gt;are they all viable?
---
more or less, although you may get turned down from high-end pve guilds for not having the optimal race/class combination most people will be happy to have a competently piloted [class] around, and none of them make a really dramatic difference while levelling/doing 5-man dungeons/etc
---
I think they were asking about alcohol content bud lol
---
You need to go into the add on folder you downloaded copy all the folders in there and past them under intereface&gt;addons and it should work! This is what I’ve done and it seems to work!

I just ended up flying around exploring the old after Cata world. Stormwind from the air looks so nice on retail.
---
And i see i did make a fair few, thanks again - its gonna be fixed within the next five minutes
---
Especially when they don't even matter. Farmer john and his terrible kobold problem isn't relatable because dozens are doing the same quest right now. 
---
There is no verisimilitude like in a single player RPG.
---
ez
---
The majority of the quests are "Grab 12 bearbutts for me and bring them to Fuckface McIdiot over there" or "Kill 20 drunken spiders and report back to me". Click through these or you'll lose your sanity. There's hundreds of these and they don't really related to the story of the zone.
---
It's mostly the questchains that tell you about the mini-storylines in each zone (or even across multiple zones, like Elwynn &gt; Westfall &gt; Redridge for the Alliance).
---
Okay ClassicRougeVll
---
I also got it not related to WoW and it stuck with me.
---
Yall are going to over hype the game then get in and get bored super fast.
---
no the real way is to list a shit item from your alt for big $$ and then purchase it on the main.... I mean seriously...
---
You could just read quest text while you’re traveling to/from your quest objectives.
---
Yes. Orc stun resistance is great, Forsaken fear resistance is great, and Troll Berserking actually makes them top picks for PvE as well

---
Where did u dl em? Pserver ones don't work right?
---
There is no spoon.... Errr... Uh.... There is no Thunderfury Blessed Blade of the Winseeker!
---
Wait, you levelled all the way to 60 and ditched the server because of your first bad UBRS group? Was this an accelerated XP server or what?
---
Beautiful
---
Nope. Been playing it for a few years now. Love it.
---
In difference scenarios. 
---
Orc won’t so much against a mage. But a gnome can for example.
---
I think you can only download it if you had an active subscription before on your account.
---
I was able to download it no problem without an active subscription, but I've had one before and also have multiple accounts attached to my battle.net account.
---
Thank you. I did not know about new servers opening.
---
Curse forge.com bro. They have a classic option if you scroll down on which patch you want
---
How can anyone forget the honorable horde. That always approach from the front and never team up on anyone. I even heard they throw down the gauntlet first to challenge you and then tip their fedora.
---
Humans have the best melee racial.
---
Dwarves have the best priest racial
---
Night elves have the best noob racial
---
Gnomes have escape artist.
---
To the left on the log in screen there is an option you can turn on that safes your email, so you would only have to type in your password.
---
Anyone else think of morning glory dew when seeing regular dew? Done this for over a decade now haha. So pumped!
---
Different classes are like playing different games, they have completely different skill sets and basic abilities, so I'd recommend watching a class picking guide, like Madseasonshow's, because it's a big decision.
---
Races also have some differences, but they're pretty minor in comparison, you won't make a mistake by just picking based on aesthetics. Maybe if you pick Priest you'll want to read up on which race is best, but that's about it.
---
Humans dont have an extra trinket. They literally have a 20 second spell that increases their stealth detection that was later turned to passive. 
---
Maybe dwarf and nelf have the best pvp racials out of the alliance side, but it doesnt compare to the horde. 
---
Stun resist is so OP vs rogues that most ally would not go rogue just because their stun rotation will have a 50% of not working on orcs. 
---
And many more will not go warlock because undead rogues would be have a field day when they see an ally warlock. You would think as a warlock you can win 1v1 against everything, but not if its a undead rogue. 
---
Trolls and tauren dont really have anything good, but the extra range for tauren make for excellent warriors.
---
For pve it's optimal.
---
Careful you don't cut yourself on that edge, lol.
---
omg the STV flashbacks (fortunate son starts playing)
---
I tried to do that quest as a Paladin...a god damned Paladin...
---
These npcs are from when Satan used to be a developer for Blizzard
---
What happened to the way add-ons were managed inhe past? Like curse? I havent played since launch week of cataclysm pretty much.
---
Also, people are recommending Questie for quests, what about Quest helper??
---
&gt; On a pvp realm you're supposed to pvp.
---
You're supposed to do what you want on a PvP realm. When I can choose to easily kill a horde being overwhelmed by mobs, or help them, I often help them, unless they're undead rogues. Undead rogue = always attack on sight no matter how much of an advantage I might have, even if I find it dishonorable, undead rogues make me go against my code.
---
Most guilds will be able to clear MC in one night, so you won't have to respec that often.
---
Roger mate thanks I’m going to be using this resource.
---
Tier 0.5 is my overarching goal for classic. &lt;3

---
Hey, somebody has a good talent build for a Resto/elem sham that allow me to heal in dungeon and doing quests easily ?
---
 Even if you split 20k into each server thats over 1k undead on each server that are going to be following that guide.
---
One way would be to avoid the use of questhelper addons like Questie. That way you'd -have- to read quest text, if only to know where to go.
---
That chicken in the back xD
---
thank you  for the laugh master druid
---
Feel free to experiment! 😈
---
Well in that case.. Its just colored water
---
I once did that last panel with a soulstone and then rebirthed the warlock who jumped with me. Fun times.
---
Also long term, moonclot and felcloth bags are in demand for a very long time due to their cooldown on the cloth. It's a consistent market
---
Wallpaper engine now!!!!
---
There is a considerable difference between classes, every class has three talent trees, which means three different ways to play the game. It's not super huge as there are utility classes that can perform roles of dedicated classes: Druids can be tanks similar to Warriors, Paladins can be healers, similar to Priests. At least one of the talent sets for every class is viable in the end-game.
---
Not at all. Of course it will be different, but it's still a great game that I enjoy.
---
Yeah I think Im going to take what ever pvp server I can get into tomorrow. I could really care less about the name.
---
Good read!
---
Standing in a town, quickly selling 6 of those for 4s - bam, 9s profit, I call this worth!
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXNcTcf8TJg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXNcTcf8TJg)
---
I would go mining to start gathering mats to level engineering, send them to a bank alt. Costs a lot to buy mats from AH to level a profession from 0.
---
Yeah I know. I was talking about release day. Should have clarified.
---
I would suggest to level with skinning and sell the leather to a vendor. Some extra copper silver from beast and dragonkins. Don't bother putting the low level leathers in the AH, itt will be flooded. Later on, you can pick a profession that requiers a gathering profession, like alchemy engineering etc, the downside is that you being tailor will have to buy the mats in the AH to level up. Or you can get a profession that doesn't require a gathering profession, enchanting. At lvl60 it shouldn't be hard to level it up as a mage, just AOE farm low level dungeons for greens and blues and disenchant them. You might find some BoE blue twink -itms on the way for extra profit.
---
Anyone know the artist? I remember seeing these back in the day and there was a bunch more good ones.
---
I'll be a skinner and leatherworker from day one as a feral tank. I'll make bank with all those beast of the hides that I take as payment for tanking ubrs \o/
---
Are people really STILL going on about this?
---
That’s awesome bro! Do one for skeram now
---
That's true ! I had fun and emotions browsing this subreddit from the beginning, while waiting for classic. Happy classic to everyone !
---
Please say sike
---
That's fucking disgusting.
---
Great to hear, if there is anything missing or any mistakes, just lemme know!
---
nothing can recreate the feeling of starting your very first wow character and exploring and experiencing this world for the first time, of course. But you will definitely get the feeling of starting a new, but also familiar adventure... to go back and start this epic journey again. I am definitely looking forward playing classic... Lok'Tar Ogar!!!
---
Isn't this functionality exactly how other add-ons like threat meters and dbm work? That's the issue with breaking the API so many inoccent bystanders.
---
"The perfect girl doesn't exi.."
---
*reading this thread*
---
There is this add on called immersion which makes reading quests more fun and easy. I believe the dev is making a classic version of it too. Here’s the link if you want to get an idea of how it works. 
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/immersion
---
Wtf
---
yes but i allready found a guild that takes me none of my friends(the 2 i have) are gonna play
---
Did you say \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?
---
&gt; Casual
---
&gt; No-life
---
Pick one.
---
Hate to say it but I'm afraid a lot of these guys will abandon it after they get their nostalgia fix within a couple of weeks
---
idk what's up with the white background :/
---
HAHAHA! This is hilarious!
---
Thanks for linking it for me!
---
You're welcome! Hope it goes well for you and have fun!
---
Mage blink is so nice. Yeah we also have slow fall but it requires a reagent and takes you a while to get down. Blink has no reagent, you can drop from any height and be on the ground quickly without losing health.
---
For a second I thought the gnome’s imp was an irradiated murloc.

I was not so serious about it but now if I remember always when some online games servers are down, I enter twitch and almost every big streamer is on the game with no problem...

 📷 [**Patch 1.7.0**](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.7.0) **(13-Sep-2005):** Added.   
---
I'd imagine it will be in p2 to give people time to lvl n stuff and not just "rush it"
---
I just hope that witch doctor in ZF drops something in phase 1
---
&gt;Isn't this functionality exactly how other add-ons like threat meters and dbm work?
---
Not even close.
---
Threat meters and Boss-Mods simply parse the combat log. The only functionality of dbm that made use of the AddonMsg channel was the "your version is out of date" notification, and that will remain untouched, as it always only used the group/raid AddonMsgChannel, which will not be touched.
---
&gt;so many inoccent bystanders.
---
So much unwarranted panic.
---
Anyone know if "secret" stuff like Dancing Troll Village, Mt. Hyjal, Under-Kara, Caverns of Time, etc. will be returning?
---
It feels silly to ask since it feels like those are among the list of "unintended things to be removed", but I can't shake my desire to go back to the Dancing Troll Village again as my first big goal...
---
it will almost definitely be easier to find groups as a casual occasional player, as a holy priest, than as a resto shaman
---
Not sure if it will work on classic, but charging as a warrior also saves you, just check if theres a mob down there, aim and spam charge while falling to it.
---
You can set a keybind to scroll wheel up/down, and shift or Ctrl+scroll up/down. Or set multiple action bar pages to the same spellbar, at different levels
---
Usually the addons will show up in the list even when they are not working.
---
Perhaps it is necessary to tick "Load out of date addons" in the Addons window. It is a common case. Or check that they are placed in the correct folder World of Warcraft/\_classic\_/Interface/AddOns/
---
If I'm moving, and your not, your melee range won't be big enough to hit my hurt box. And I can still hit you. At least that's my understanding
---
Who still gets mail?
---
 Defias pillager is a ranged mob that runs away in fear and does huge dmg
---
for any class other than rogue imo,yes they are very very hard.
---
Also,don't do the "pillager" quest in Moonbrook,that will get you killed a lot
---
btw just noticed your name #ITcrowdrules
---
i feel for you guys, by some miracle of RNGesus we've got a group of almost 100 returning horde players from stonemaul, the members of like 3-4 diff guilds back in vanilla and were all playing in the same guild this time around. Nostalgia and Hype is at 110%, alot of us havent spoken in the last 10+ years
---
Dude how do you get the horde and warrior pictures next to your name?
---
Ready to sanctify this world, I see :)
---
Ofcourse it is
---
Noticeable. I'll see what the 2080ti does.
---
Works all the time 80% of the time.
---
&gt;  Without looking at the code
---
I suggest you look at the code then, before you make assumptions.
---
Looks like getting there was a *Waist of Time*
---
Who is gonna buy them, when no one has any gold?
---
Get your bumhole checked by a doctor if it requires scratching 24/7
---
&gt;Guess I'll say it again; without such addon, you have an incentive to socialise more in order to reduce downtime to form a group. Which in turn makes it so you meet up with them again, resulting in opening up to those people and forming friendships.
---
And I say: No, this isn't socializing what you are talking about. You are seemingly thinking about other people as tools if you just add them because you have an easier time to get a full group next time. That has nothing to do with socializing.
---
&gt;That's the problem this addon make. You don't need to socialise. This addon makes it all easier and people replaceable. Hence why I don't want it.
---
No, it does not, as the entire social part doesn't happen at invite. It happens afterwards. How often do I have to repeat that? It makes also no sense that you wouldn't add people to your friend list after the entire dungeon because you found them over an addon.
---
Very true. I wasn't saying it's better, just that I hate buying them, since if you get lucky you can get them for free.
---
I should probably just suck it up and get some.
---
Minecraft and twitch streams
---
Ok... This is some kind of weird humble brag or a serious case of denial. I'm getting the impression you think because you did Naxx that makes classic less enjoyable for you. I've cleared Naxx in Vanilla and never once had "the past is the past, I've done it all" thought process. To come on here and start posting in an almost condescending way is kind of creepy, if not cringey in a way.
---
People from all walks on vanilla experience are coming back, a health portion that were probably far better and accomplished than you.
---
We'll see you in azeroth.

AMD graphics card user here. It‘s cool but I don‘t think I‘d use it even if I had a Nvidia card.

I love how this question consistently gets these two contradictory answers
---
AFAIK it does matter in classic. Back in vanilla there was no such thing as weapon speed normalization. This was introduced in later expansions.
---
Oh thanks! Its not that I'm paranoid, not more than the healthy amount. I just had no way of testing it and want to be prepared. Thanks for the info!
---
Go Mage
---
+ You'll have an easier time getting into groups (and have a more generally applicable CC)
---
+ Once you 'make friends' you can get them to help you gear up your Rogue/other characters
---
Getting your foot in the door (social networking) is a lot more important than anything else.
---
as i predicted xD
---
Fury is pretty much as fast as Arms is.
---
Everyone bitching about server population needs to freak out. Blizzard know what they are doing. They know that after the first week there will be a significant drop in population. All the kiddies that are mad because they got to level 20 and haven’t got a mount yet, and don’t know what do do because there is no quest log telling them where to go will leave.
---
I'm sat at a festival hungover, so I can't. How about your assumptions? What nefarious group building activities are going on?
---
Think the reasoning is the slower the speed the higher the Damage Per hit will be. So when using windfury, once it proccs it deals massive damage. Problem is it will occur less often the fewer times you hit.
---
Thats cool and all but what keeps them from just running the thing in a browser or something? It will be a little less convinient but in the end jt would almost work the same way.
---
Bad Mojo Mask you mean? Yup is in the game.
---
With all the cloth you get from consolidating dungeon runs you can easily pump out more than 40 an hour. That's a whole gold!
---
Arent they adding 4 more servers tomorrow?
---
Taurens have extended everything, there was a video from Early beta showing like a 12ish yd minimum shoot range for Tauren vs Tauren.
---
Stop your saying the tool tip is wrong?
---
"Don't you guys have low pop server?!"
---
Unsure if they get prio, Asmon said if the que is too long he might switch server and take some friends with him
---
Lets keep this garbage out of /r/classicwow, alright? Everyone report this as a violation of rule 1.
---
If someone asks me about prebis I'll tell them to go fuck themselves tbh. It's bad enough in retail that everything is ilvl gated. Until we're at content that is legit seriously hard I don't need some dude trying to micromanage me.

I'm central time as well. I believe it will be 5pm central as the global release map shows 6pm eastern. As for the classic client when you have WoW selected in the Bnet launcher, right above the install/launch button is a drop down. Select classic from there and you can download that client.
---
After reading this entire thread, you definitely just gave yourself gold... This whole thing just gets more and more hilarious.
---
Mayonnaise = Medium
---
By going undead you give yourself a utility against warlocks (will of the forsaken) and you never have to deal with shamans.  You will have to deal with blessing of freedom from paladins but that is really only a problem when they are casting it on warriors/rogues.  Hunters will give you some trouble on either faction.
---
r/classicwow...
---
F5...
---
You get the idea.
---
I think so but I don't believe many that already reserved and have set their minds on these servers are going to ditch so easily, more that I think returning sub's that haven't come in yet will go to the lower pop pve/pvp realms
---
You sell them to vendor. Like take skinning and herb is my go to profession. Yes they sell peanuts but they add up easily, I had over 20 gold left when I bought my level 40 as a warrior. It also nice to be able to farm high level flowers while most trying to level them up because they rather rush 60.
---
nah. Reddit upload is weird.
---
Guess you are right. If I want a sub rogue, I'll do it faster and cheaper if I level and gear up as a combat sword spec.
---
U just have to realize it won't be the same experience, and have new goals.
---
Feral was broken in wotlk also and Tbc had terrible pvp balance. Some of the worst.
---
To be honest arena ruined pvp and I’d rather not see it again, rpgs do not lend themselves well to small team engagements like arena and balancing the pvp game around it was doomed to failure. Balancing around 10v10 would have made a lot more sense with arena being there just for fun, although balancing in pvp shouldn’t have ever been a priority. Arena is what made it a priority. Fuck arena.

It's top tier in PvP and pve.
---
&gt; Your definition of "decent" is arbitrary.
---
I don't think it's arbitrary to define decent as a guild where the players care more about the guild as a whole than they do about themselves.
---
&gt;  a hunter could want it for a marginal PvE buff
---
Or a big buff, depending on what he has currently, you're also forgetting that it's a huge buff in pvp which ALSO benefits the guild
---
&gt;  If your healadin likes to play something else in PvP, this could be beneficial for your guild to give it to him
---
It's never beneficial to have a paladin play something other than holy, do people really not understand how bad a spec ret is?
---
&gt; Fact is that loot attribution is about what it brings to the dude.
---
No, it's not, it's about what it brings to the guild
---
Shrek.
---
Found it. I had to download something called the Battle.Net desktop app which I didn't know about since before, hence the confusion. Now it's installing though. Thanks for helping out!
---
Need class demographic!:D
---
That would be reasonable. I want to play with some streamers but EU and not so big ones to spoil the fun, so propably gonna watch if they change mind
---
Not only alone, I will not get on it the 1st day, nor the 1st week. Maybe one night, and then on the 3rd week I will start leveling. Such is life.
---
Bingo. This whole thing whole thing is sad
---
What? People don’t text in 2019? What am I missing?
---
i enjoy hunters in the party. just make sure your pet doesnt do anything stupid...
---
casual pvper no life pver
---
Pretty sure it is  azazel1944 / Wu Shuang
---
They will, but getting into them might be more difficult.  I know people got to under-Karazhan on the beta.
---
Do you have the link?
---
it's from lvl 1 and costs 1 silver i think
---
Played it for years on pservers, been waiting on an official release for ages. It's still super addictive and fun; I'm gonna enjoy the hell out of it.
---
No vacation till December, sad
---
Actually I think you'll find Firemaw is full.
---
Er, that wasn't really my point, but I guess it doesn't matter at this stage.
---
Dude how do you get the faction and class pictures next to your name?
---
Level 5 to learn. Super cheap to learn...but the skinning knife or mining pick cost a little bit. So worth waiting a couple of levels to buy imo
---
I let my sub lapse 6 months ago but have 10 tokens in the bank and will finally cash one in Tuesday

Woah, no alterations please because I fully respect the rights of the original artist, you'll have to ask his permission before I make the 3 clicks required to fulfil this humble request.

I heard fishing is a good way to get the bags. Maybe spend 15 mins fishing? Gets you some skill points in a useful skill at the same time.
---
RP addons?
---
Ive played both alot, ended up mostly as alliance due to guild migrating on retail. Im going to strictly saty Horde this time around . i dont know if its the human female meta or the elves, or the generic high fantasy setting. but something about the Alliance just feels cartoonish and childlike, not nearly as interesting as the Horde, playerbase tends to be alot less desirable too
---
Art is inevitable,as much as it can be annoying. The fate of all subs
---
When will we see the output of this survey ?
---
Nope
---
basically the gist of it is, they have no idea how to disable the addon without breaking other addons
---
so rather than launch with lots of other addons broken, they're going to let it slide until they figure out how to deal with it
---
look like shit
---
You're welcome! Happy that you enjoy the vids ;)
---
Keep in mind your Defensive Stance quest at level 10 has to be picked up from Razor Hill rather than Bloodhoof.  Other than that, you're good.
---
Is there a questie equivalent for classic?
---
This gonna suck so hard until Tuesday fuck sake &gt;.&lt;
---
Fury 2hnd till 40, then go arms
---
not in vanilla my dude. although charging to a mob should work.
---
And for the leveling ? Will I have to switch to retribution?
---
It is absolutely top tier in both raiding, dungeons and pvp!! Really strong and sought after class!!
---
The only drawback is that leveling as holy is not viable, so you go retri, then respec at 60. Also leveling is a bit slow and very atoattack focused.
---
Hmm, doubt I do lol. How much does a token cost?
---
I usually give away them for free.
---
I love the sexy armor
---
Yes, pretty much.
---
DBM wasn't needed in Classic.
---
2 on na,but we are sitting at 9 full servers with 50% of this subredit still not subed, if you add the people that will see it on social media on monday, im expecting at least another 4 servers will be going up and i think im being conservative.
---
Caffeine is actually pretty weak for sleep deprivation endurance, you're gonna need a more heavy duty stimulant, especially with que times and all, i would recommend crystal meth for this occasion.
---
Shazzrah is going to be 60/40 for horde. Reddit polls, straw polls, discord members and assigns, and guild recruitment posts all indicate this.
---
looks awesome!!
---
Still possible to level with Holy but, it's would be pain in ass.
---
But do you agree that patch 2.0 has a lot more in common with TBC than it does with Vanilla?
---
The only 3 dots I see is next to "Community Details", and there's custom feed and favourites. I can add text there though, is that it?
---
Agreed. Go ahead and moo or anything else even spit, but don’t pet my luscious mane. I’m not a god damn companion pet I’m a mighty warrior that swings tree trunks as weapons
---
What’s this addons do? And what’s the big deal? Someone fill me in please.
---
My bad,though we were talking in general. But yeah,charge works when it wants to
---
"We encourage players to move away from servers that are full"
---
But...but...which ones?!?!
---
GREAT JOB!
---
breaking news: classic has been cancelled because producer no longer likes vanilla icecream
---
Paladins are great single target healers and every raid needs multiple Paladins for blessings.
---
It's not that I believe it will replicate the exact experience of 2005, i believe classic in of itself is an excellent, genre defining mmorpg that trumps its current iteration by miles. I love WoW, hate the turd that BFA/modern WoW is and believe Classic is simply the better game.
---

---
I'm conflicted between Herb/Alch on my Rogue or doing Mining/Eng, knowing full damn well Rogue w/ Eng. is the dream not just in PvP but just general dicking around.
---
Mmmm mind control helm shenanigans....
---
I'm going to be levelling to 60 with no addons, though I'll probably allow a dps meter so I can watch my group try to dps in dungeons
---
you need to chill on the pareto principle
---
Generally ele resto will work in most guilds/circumstances but it really depends on the other shaman in the raid. Usually I go ele resto once things are close to farm status
---
I'd say one Holy is enough. Retribution will supply other buffs.
---
Check out the stickied post on this sub.  It’s only a community poll so will be a bit off, but it’s a good indicator. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cug357/world_of_warcraft_classic_server_demographics/
---
4 Warriors and shaman for sure. Thats what a lot of people are using for their 5 man multiboxing comps to farm start live.
---
I work from home so I'm able to be with my dog 24/7, so spending time with him is the perfect excuse to take a break form work.
---
Shhh don’t tell blizz that’s probably how retail will end up... “pick a side, any side! Just like pandas you can choose with any race!”
---
I am pretty neutral in retail though. I’ll stop and help kill an elite if I see an alliance struggling. Not that I play it much anymore.
---
Paladin is bad, holy paladin is one of thr best pve healers for raiding.
---
Apologies for upvoting past \*69\*
---
but your drawing really is that great!! Awesome skills!!
---
Im lady hyped with a lady who isn't into games
---
make sure that he uses shield for himself and not for u. dmg absorbed by his shield will not give u rage so u will gain less rage and do less dmg. also he should lasthit everything for his imp spirit talent so he has less downtime :)
---
You aint Heroic Leaping nowhere in classic bro
---
Paladins aren’t great levelers but Holy Paladin is very good in endgame for both pve and pvp.
---
im with you. I wish they would balance the game with Classic mentality in mind and go for a new game.. that would be the dream
---
The only benefits you would get is practicing moving and an idea of the layout of Undercity.  Both of these things have changed a bit, but are basically the same.
---
Instead of you spamming: "/3 LFG DEADMINES!" Its spams it for you.
---
 And it will read /3 too, so if someone else spams LFG Deadmines it will list a Deadmines group and you can request to get an invite.
---
Weird reaction to a post that pointing out obvious thing
---
This post is cathartic
---
My inner capitalist is appalled but I bet that's a good way to make friends and get a positive server reputation.
---
If you're european, speaks english and Horde. Roll on Mograine and DM me on launch day.
---
We can do some dungeons together or just chat. =)
---
A comment giving credit to the original like a good guy on a post about being a good guy. \*SOUND\*
---
I've heard plenty of times people saying to not buy all skills. If I want to go enhance leveling, and heal in dungeons, what skills should I buy? Is it only healing wave you spam in dungeons? (and buy rez ofc)
---
And about spell ranks, do you just use the highest one of healing wave, or is it more mana efficient to spam cast lower ranks?
---
Not sure. Try installing newest drivers for your card and see if experience is an option in the install.
---
Normalization occurred in patch 1.8. It was in Vanilla in one of the patches before 1.12.
---
I really don't like that talent at all for leveling. It has its place on pvp servers. It's rather kill mobs quicker than he quicker. All 40+ it's near useless
---
“Hasn’t logged on in 10 years.”
---
Oh wow. That’s awesome! Where is the addons at? What’s it called?
---
That's not the point though. Blizzard basically told people "you can subscribe 2 weeks early, and in turn get a quicker shot at picking your name". To be honest, that was a bit questionable to begin with, but fair enough.
---
Considering that half the people who did resub early will end up on a different server (not me, I'm just playing devils advocate here), it's an entirely fair point to feel screwed over.
---
Could they have done it better? I don't know. They didn't have solid numbers for players before the name reservations opened, and you can't exactly fault them for adding more servers.
---
The only thing they could have done is announce all the newly added servers one day X, clearly communicating that they will be open for character creation at date/time Y, to give people a bit of a heads up and a chance to talk with their guilds whether they want to move there. Ultimatively, that would have given everyone another shot at picking their name.
---
Social networking isn't guild specific. There are times you need people to do stuff that may not necessarily be part of your guild. In the worst-case it gives you a fall-back should your guild ever implode (hell, my Vanilla guilds imploded and yet I was still full clearing all raid minus Nax every week because I just had the 'connections')
---
Loktar! Die Alliance Scum
---
Yeah I just checked because I was messing with some add on stuff haha, it’s gonna be crazy!
---
Not sure if trolling or actually clueless.
---
I'm planning to get a subscription tomorrow, is there a way of pre-downloading the classic client today?
---
this is plain false. paladins bring blessings and have the best mana efficiency of all healing classes. When you Priests have all run dry on mana the paladin will still be there healing. 
---
Paladins also mean greater blessings in raids. You at least want Salvation and Kings and preferably you wan Wisdom and the others too. I've raided a lot and normally there would be 3-5 holy paladins in raids
---
Single target healing is a paladins bread and butter
---
I don't think either class has problem finding gropus. Healers are always needed.

Ah ok, both are there. Basically it's just endgame dungeons that had items added in 1.10. All other items are in the game phase 1 even if those items got updated stats in 1.10. It's just completely new 1.10 items that are not in the game at launch.
---
  At least that is my understanding after encountering that post I linked in my edit.

I would lie if I said I wouldn‘t want to make profit in WoW. As a mage I will sell portals for 1g each, but as for the 6 slots bags, they can be purchased for 5a at the vendor anyway.. so why not giving them away for free and make some other players happy :)
---
Thank you. I was under the impression resto shamans were particularly sought after. I guess the class is more populated than priest is then? It does not show immediately from class demographics census as they are not faction-specific

no.

Is the Minion program still a thing, or do people use curse client still? Any other advice for some one who quit when Wrath came out? Also looking for suggestions for my newbie gf to play as.
---
OK, thanks. Reading through the comments here it seems like I am not the only one, who got that impression.
---
In that case then yes, then there are many things wrong with my previous statement above.
---
Hey every one!! 
---
How do you guys find shammys for casual play and pvp!!? 
---
I usually main a ret and I love that I can play close combat and also support my buds. 
---
A shaman would be completely new territory but it honestly sounds exciting. I have just read that they have a high skill cap and mostly do well in pvp through elemental/resto? 
---
atm Its either shammy or rogue atm! Any advice or opinions would be great!!
---
its cleary not gonna "fuck off"
---
Yes, I just did it. Simply download through the Blizzard app / from battlenet website.
---
100% these damn things

The Paladin set looks exactly the same?

apparently u can use it and then ask for money back

Gross!

On the other hand, interesting to see all the flavors we don’t have in the states!

I'll give him my prime when he pops back up, his YouTube videos are great content and though his mistake the malicious intent of the people looking to get him banned is just a real shitty thing to do.
---
weapon speed normalization is a thing that happened prior to 1.12, meaning abilities that scale from weapon damage (like mortal strike) scale based on a normalized value for weapon damage based on the dps of the item, not based on the actual damage numbers and swing speed, which means that slower weapons do not increase ability damage
---
**however**
---
slower weapons are better for enhancement shamans because windfury is not a normalized weapon ability, it is an extra weapon swing
---
That's nab talk
---
I have been selling 6 Slot bags on the Stress Test for 4 Silver (To other players)
---
It's a win-win for both the crafter and the one that bought it.
---
They get it for 1 Silver less (which is a lot at that level) and the Crafter gets more than just the Vendor price.
---
Honestly, I have a few friends that are gonna play, but aside from my sons, I'm not really telling them what server I'm on or what faction I'm playing. I don't want them knowing how much or how long I play and how quickly I get to 60. It's not my fault they don't have as much playtime as I do...

You dont need resto talents to heal leveling dungeons, you just need a decent amount of intellect. Go enhance until the 40s, keeping some intellect gear on hand for healing in dungeons, then respec to elemental in the 40s when you have access to more and more spellpower gear.
---
For many race / class combinations the horde are just objectively better in PvP due to racials. That’s not necessarily universally true but it’s a decent rule of thumb. 
---
Stoneskin is pretty awesome in general. And escape artist is basically a bootleg ass cloak of shadows for vanilla rogues and is powerful af on warriors. It’s not bad on everything else either. Night elves can do a front flip when they jump.
---
I was about to comment something similar.  
---
The horde is cool and all, and Thunder Bluff is a sweeping vision of joy, but damn it Ironforge is a beautiful city.
---
The problem is, people have already used up all 3 reservation slots. Come 1PM tomorrow, the cap will be removed and people can start preparing as needed.
---
You got to tell her wtf
---
Paladins did have the same pvp gear as warriors in earlier patches, but it overhauled into healing/spell damage gear later on sadly
---
\*50% of a small reddit population who filled out a survey
---
I'm almost certain I won't like it as much as I originally did. Most of it is nostalgia for me and I expect to drop the game after like 2 months or something. But let's wait and see, maybe it will be as great as it was back then and I get so hooked that I will play it endlessly like I used to.
---
Are the items on the right (Elune for example)  consumable, or can you keep it forever?
---
If the latter, that is insane
---
I'm a demon hunter I'll just glide.
---
I think tauren can ride wolves too

Or they’d more often make you see a far off place, for instance; the bottom of a cliff....

---
How does everybody feel about server choice now? On one hand I didn't want to join Shazzrah or Golemagg as early would be too much of a cluster fuck (especially rolling undead) but on the other hand I'm worried about investing time in one of the new servers that open up...i don't want to put months of work into one server only for the casuals to eventually drop like flies and I'll be stuck on a low pop server...perhaps a middy server like Geh or Fire will be a good bet?
---

didn't the ram not have a rep requirement in 1.12? wasn't it just av tokens
---
Pservers are so overtuned. All of those lvl 8 mobs in mulgore hit for like 20 damage to a warrior. On beta it was much less
---
Can’t decide either :( help me pls
---
Coming in phase 2 I believe
---
Despite what you think, they do. They have been around for decades and are still making games. They aren’t stupid. They know classic will have a massive amount of interest at launch and then dwindle down to a fraction of that number after a month.
---
Basically having a now-a days potatoe will work.

False. warlocks are no fallen mages instead fallen shaman lorewise.
---
I never really understood how hunters pet work in classic. Never played hunter much in Vanilla. How do pets get abilities? Does it matter which pets you tame? Last time I tried to look this up, couldn't find any kind of guide on it.
---
Depends on your timezone. www.wowclassiccountdown.com got you covered. Enjoy!
---
The concept is cool, but it makes little sense... Sylvanas has no reason to be standing behind Arthas or the Lich King, unless it was to kill him, which it doesn't look like she's about to do. Also why is Arthas the paladin holding Frostmourne if this is supposed to be a good / evil reflection thing? His hammer would have fit better
---
Questie
---
I see, now it's becoming clear. Thank you!
---
I'm that guy. Can't wait to do it again. But this time on the other faction! :-)
---
O
---
Oh :( that actually blows. I wanted to make a Night Elf Hunter.
---
I will really appreciate it if you make it alliance as well. Thank you, bud.
---
is it free?
---
Go with witch model you prefer. Anyone remember the old model swaps in vanilla by editing the files?
---
Damn that’s hot.
---
Seems auto invite was removed from it few days ago
---
What I have noticed over the years was that Energy Drinks really suck late. I gotta stop drinking them 1-2 hours before sleep or else sleeping will be annoying. They don't really keep me awake, only hyped if that makes sense. Coffee on the other hand seems to be better.

It's a worldwide release so some places it drops the 27th and some places it drops the 26th.
---
Apples aren't much better really, they are effectively just sugar water so they will perk you up initially but then you go down pretty fast, bananas at least have some fat energy to keep things going. With caffeine you eventually crash hard, and energy drinks double that up by giving you a sugar crash combined with a caffeine crash.
---
Yes you could. It reduces all damage.
---
Dont use curse client.
---
Newbie girlfriend = hunter
---
Retail vanilla was NOT 12-13k. I would anticipate full being 15-18k.
---
&gt; For raids there might be room for 1 shadow priest
---
1 shadow priest is the ideal number, for shadow weaving, which increases warlock (shadowbolt bot) dps
---
Mad boomer
---
Should add new servers asap imo
---
using guidelime, several versions of joana's guide can be accessed through this addon.  you have to download them separately, but they're on curseforge.
---
It's genuinely baffling to me how many people don't understand and/or know their time zone. How did this lapse in general knowledge occur?
---
Whew, people must really be coming out of the woodwork so close to launch to only be hearing about content phasing now
---
basically like retail df but in classic. You make a group and no one has to say 1 word for it to become a full 5 man party
---
Yeah totally feels like classic m8
---
Just happy to oblige other vanilla fans, here you go:

To be completely honest. This list is complete as it is now. Many people i know from  vanilla started the game without addons. Only at level cap or alts we had them
---
This is actually my idol and who I want to be. What is best class so I can maximise my niceness?
---
What are good addons If I’m new?
---
These apes just wont let this go away will they.
---
Link, I thought the wise old sage told you that in confidence. /smh 😁
---
My biggest takeaway from this pic and the Horde version as well is that the Shoulder slot should have been optionally visible.
---
Oh for the wrong info then! I really thought they introduced it after vanilla.
---
I'm just getting skinning for leveling to gather stuff I'm going to need to level Tailoring at 60
---
True!
---
No... paladins legit have the same PVP set as warriors. It’s the same models.
---
Anyone got a proper wallpaper of that background?
---
I'd say Orc is superior but I am still rolling undead just because I love their model.

Nice work, damn. Thanks for sharing friend!

A lot of new starters will try out addons and a bad experience with one can ruin the game. I am using just a few myself.

When you get pvp trinket, wotf is not gonna be that powerful against anything other than lock imo. However the stunresist is gonna be better against other rogues, paladins and all the classes with a chance to stun.

I was so sure i wanted an ud rogue, but with pvp trinket orc win in my book. And the orc ap increase can be popped in stealth.

To be honest, mage should probably be the noob friendly class instead of hunters.
---
Well i always liked fantasy and in school in never payed any attention to the teacher instead i just drew some pictures of my imagination :)

getting full bis equip isn't that easy as many of theese fuckers think. there are many items that are bis for more than one class and it will be such a rear item that maybe one or two guys from the guild will even have it. i don't really know what they are thinking if they say that they want groups full of bis equiped people it is not realistic/ possible in any way. it isn't needed to clear the content the same goes for world buffs. the good thing about these kind of people is that you need to stay as far as possible away from these idiots
---
I just need something for my actionbar and gui and thats it.
---
How many of these posts are we going to get before I decide to treat noobs like shit?
---
Yeah, i created a female Orc already on Classic WoW name reservation.
---
But recently i started thinking about Warlocks and their fear spam...and got me thinking.
---
Yea I'm a warrior so I'm good to go :)
---
Neither, go Troll

+ [Free Action Potion](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5634/free-action-potion) is superior to Hardiness, and you're pretty much guaranteed to be chugging these in group combat (and so is literally everyone else, because things like Warriors being kited by Mages is sad when they could prevent it outright just by chugging a potion)
---
+ [Glimmering Mithril Insignia](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10418/glimmering-mithril-insignia) is better than WotF, sure it has 5 times the cooldown but it lasts 6 times longer and that's generally more than enough time to have your way with any 'fear oriented' defenders.
---
If you don't care about min/maxing (so won't be using consumables) then go Orc, that being said the probabilities on the 'stun-resist' are nowhere close to the numbers you think they are

Starting with a total of 6 English EU servers, with only 2 being pvp servers, they have totally proven that they don't know what they're doing. Yes, they've been adding servers and they will add more, but the population balance is already fucked from the start.
---
Just sleep and play when you wake. It’ll average out to the same /played over time, and it’s the only truly healthy option.
---
Dude this is amazing, thank you. Something about the phrase 'we're going home' really strikes hard for me as we all get hyped for Classic. It's somewhere between a patriotic war call and a look back on the best times of our childhood, and this wallpaper sums it up so perfectly for me.
---
if you're going purely by the numbers, it depends on your raid composition. if you're very warlock heavy going into a 20-man, by the numbers you need ~6 warlocks before a shadow priest brings more net dps than another warlock purely though shadow weaving
---
the other consideration going into 20-mans is that you may be less strapped for debuff slots and a shadow priest might be able to use more than just the one for shadow weaving, meaning they get to do actual dps instead of just maintaining shadow weaving with mind blast and wanding in between (which is what you will be doing in 40-mans)
---
I honestly have never even played Classic. Others energy and hype are feeding into me and I am genuinely excited for launch and to play with my friends who have played Classic before.
---
Most people are taking Skinning to pay for their level 40 mount - You can make enough gold to pay for it just from Skinning every kill and vendoring the leather all the way to level 40.
---
I can do without any add ons. But I just don't like getting ganked by casters and not knowing what he's casting at me. Also debuff times are nice on enemies. That's the most essential for me personally.
---
Besides that I like to have a swing timer.
---
I've leveled rogues before. It was super easy.

"poor lvlers" my ass.

Curse client got merged i to Twitch client which I really dont like. I dont use any addon manager.

What your girlfriend plays doesnt really matter, she will learn. I just recommended Hunter since it’s the easiest class to level.

yeah my undead rogue gonna love it

Always been a nelf hunter, but this time I am rolling a gnome mage myself.
---
Thank you !
---
Incorrect - many orcish shamans turned to warlock magics, but ALL alliance warlocks, and most of, if not all non-orc warlocks of this era are fallen mages.
---
Furthermore, bringing up the Shaman point supports my argument. Those are spellcasters who turned on their faith to gain the powers needed to control and enslave, and to gain dominion over other sentient creatures
---
Another simple noob question as a Mage :
---
I found this https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/2300052310231531--053500030013 as for starting talents as a normal mage to level etc
---
Is this ok ? Or should I do something else? And which side do I start on or rather which order do I go?
---
Correcting the link for OP:
---
https://society6.com/imadreamwalker
---
Amazing work by the way.
---
Incorrect. Monkeynews confirmed Gehennas last night. Seems to be the new Nostarlius as most pserver pvpers are going there
---
I would start with checking out Warcraft 3's story. You can find all the cutscenes online as well! 
---
For something a little more lengthy a d in depth, this is a good spot: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/History_of_Warcraft
---
Not sure what you are asking. You already know the difficulties. What would stop you?
---
Slow fall is for pussies :) real mages blink
---
I love how that warrior is rocking corpsereaver
---
And I still don't know if I should play night elf warrior or undead warlock.
---
I understand how time zones work, I'm sorry to baffle you. I'm confused because I have literally seem people claim it releases at midnight (I assume current day) for them.
---
yes, talking to people is different from not talking to people
---
Can see why that is hard to understand if you're used to the latter.
---
ok...i think ill pick Orc...thanks
---
oh shit eww, I'll do more research, thanks friend! I'll go ahead and let her decide on her own and offer up suggestions like "no, you don't want to start off as warrior first time" or stuff.
---
Thanks perfect response that’s exactly what I was thinking. Is single target frost the best single target leveling spec too?
---
Alright I'll put forth a rebuttal on your claim that it will still work and ignore the discussion of lfg addon/no lfg addon.
---
From the discord post it doesn't seem like it's confirmed working as it was before. Most likely the one button group finding will be lost forever and it will just list names looking for the same group with the chat parser.

---
That's true for Orcs.  Humans, gnomes, and undead however, not so much.

Wow this title just screams to trigger people. I bet you were one the people copy pasting ”the wall of no” all the years and now this is all you’ve got.

Mage aswell. Only dps that is good farmer, dpser, utility
---
I played vanilla and hit 60 early enough to raid MC while you could still get tier 2 drops there. I downloaded my first addon (Cosmos) when I reached Barrens during leveling, added several more before hitting 60. Not sure why everyone is suddenly pretending we had no addons back at 60. We most certainly did.
---
Are you under an anus?
---
my point is that if you're a casual occasional player and not joining a guild for pve, it's less likely people will know you by reputation, and resto shaman has a much higher skill cap
---
as a group leader i'd be more likely to trust someone i don't know to do their job if it's easier for them to do their job
---
For some ungodly reason those were hard to come by and its own little niche market on the ah
---
&gt; I don't think it's arbitrary to define decent as a guild where the players care more about the guild as a whole than they do about themselves.
---
And yet, it is. Because you are arbitrarily deciding than anything else than the purest form of strict PvE interest is not "decent". That's how far you are going: you use the word "decent". At least, had you used "competitive", I could half-agree. But no, you used "decent", which makes you argument entirely unreasonable, and elitist; far from any form of reality.
---
&gt;Or a big buff, depending on what he has currently, you're also forgetting that it's a huge buff in pvp which ALSO benefits the guild
---
That's what "could" means; a possibility. I didn't write "would". Could/would mean different things. If a hunter actually gains a huge DPS buff from a 2H sword, say for instance he had really crap green/blue stuff instead, then sure he could pretend to bypass the roll of a paladin.
---
I literally wrote the logic behind that in my previous comment. Let me repeat it: "*Fact is that loot attribution is about what it brings to the dude.*". This obviously goes both ways: if the hunter gains a lot with the upgrade, then he has arguments to get the loot.
---
&gt;It's never beneficial to have a paladin play something other than holy, do people really not understand how bad a spec ret is?
---
You are now operating on strict bad faith instead of any form of actual intellectual honesty. This does not motivate me to take you seriously, you should know that.
---
What you said is immensely dumb and unreasonable for several reasons:
---
1. A paladin playing ret in PvP does not affect your PvE progress in any way or form. His PvE contribution is his PvE contribution. What he does in his own spare time in PvP does not change any of that.
---
2. Ret or prot paladins are useful in raid. Just because they aren't the most efficient specs does not make them useless. This pseudo-elitist thinking is based on no form of actual raiding reality outside of the people rushing to get the first kills. And since this entire discussion has never been defined by this extremely limited range of raiding parties, your stance does not make any sense.
---
3. A good ret or prot paladin is better than an average or bad holy pal.
---
4. Tanks aren't always legion, and it can be entirely beneficial to have an additional tank instead of having not enough tank.
---
5. Keeping people happy is the surest way to get them to stick, which is the surest way to reach raiding goals. Helping paladins have autonomy outside of raids keeps them happy.
---
&gt;No, it's not, it's about what it brings to the guild
---
Which I have given plenty of reasons (that you all ignored, since you aren't interested in actually talking in good faith) to think that the guild can benefit from.
---
Firemaw continues to be #1 by a huge amount in every survey, and has just hit Full on the realm list. When the first survey showed Firemaw at the top, everyone supposed that it was because the poll got brigaded by Discord. We've had quite a few surveys since then; are they brigading it every time or has this server really attracted an insane number of players?
---
THANKS for the numbers.
---
I was thinking about the 4 stuns with preparation blind (if im able to survive that long)
---
Its a fucking game 😂 for petes sake
---
So is Firemaw gonna be the most populated EU realm? 
---
It has only just gotten to full population while golemagg, gehennas and shazzrah have been full for a few days but the survey results give a lot more responses for people going firemaw. This is kind of confusing me.
---
So is green blocked too?
---
The chat room?
---
It's amazing how bloated retail has gotten.

Everything will be fine... eventually.. but people aren't concerned about eventually - they're concerned about the 2-3 months where their servers will be packed with x5 maximum capacity.

Blizzard is making long term decisions to a short term problem and that's what people are afraid of.

Anyone know if you can do something like this but with AMD?

Yes i will help new people and i wont kick Them After the fifth wipe in deadmines. But i will also gank lower level toons in stranglethorn without mercy.

Enjoy your queue tomorrow, I'll be chilling on Nethergarde with the other two dudes who weren't too stubborn to reroll
---
Just be online at 11 45 on monday CST and move to one of the new servers and get ur name on them
---
&gt;They are prepared now.
---
you said that two weeks ago, you said that the first time they announced extra servers, you said that the second time they announced extra servers.
---
It's time to realize that launch will be a clusterfuck because ---- BLIZZARD IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO PREPARED ---
---
My friend you are going to reroll to your true nature I guarantee it
---
Hadn't seen this one before, nice!
---
Goodluck spamming a reading /3 with 10k people in the same level range.
---
Stop making me doubt again!
---
some of the later or more recent pservers improved paladins a lot (around 20%) and yeah they were better on classic beta than private servers 
---
in really really good gear late vanilla paladins may be number 1 dps (but thats like including nax guild), in mid vanilla (probably around zg) they should be viable dps in a raid , possibly even phase 2 but it needs testing
---
thank you!
---
I sort of feel that you're going to be in for a shock (expectations not lining up with reality) when you actually get around to PvP (based purely on what you've written in this thread), time will see I guess.
---
Ever heard of opportunity cost? Peddling those bags for meager profits while you could be leveling to get better bags to sell is probably not worth it.
---
That's not really true, sure a rogue is better than a warrior but a paladin leveling in prot using ret aura and a spike is pretty darn effective aoe farming. As for every class, hunters can easily solo a few without much downtime, mages can farm unlimited amounts of mobs if their root rng is on point. Rogues will have to start popping big cooldowns on 3 mobs.
---
so?
---
Yes, they are?  One made groups for you and forced at least 2 people to head to the dungeon before the group could start. The other one just automatically ported you to the dungeon, and if you lost someone mid dungeon would find someone for you and port them to the dungeon without any work on your part. Combine that together with dungeons that don't require CC and you get a recipe for disaster. TBC dungeons on the other hand, heroics, needed lots of CC until you badly outgeared them which is why LFG was just fine.
---
I recommend questie. Simpelt because you could use the extra help finding quest objectives. Other than that i would highly recommend going in dry. Experience it the way it is meant tog be played, kinda.
---
Yeah, same here. I'm Brazilian, but my main language in game is english.
---

---
Hey night shift brother! enjoy the time off
---
probably the reality of the situation, yes.
---
Nobody, they're delusional.  Everyone is going to have Skinning leveling up, the market will be super over-saturated causing prices to plummet below what you can sell to the vendor for.
---
Me at everyone who decided to play a Human in a high fantasy world
---
I am thinking if I should do that. Or maybe just take the possible free transfer that comes eventually (if less people leave than was thought)
---
Probably yes, there are too many to do for one character to not outlevel them, which is actually a good thing in my eyes. Maybe the solution for you is to roll an undead and another character that goes to the barrens? I'm not sure what your plans are.
---
To be honest, this is the best outcome.  Blizzard knows what the players want and is going to ensure that the api isn't going to get around it.
---
If the LFG author can work with Blizzard to find a happy balance, I don't mind.
---
Just play what is fun for you. Most people won't raid (less than 1%). A lot of people won't even hit 60. If you are interested in PvE content, you'll find yourself in. Windfury makes melee dps kick ass. And you have enough utility / heals to not be a liability. 
---
Warlock isn't broken.
---
No addons are really needed but it depends on how you want to play, do you want to read every quest thouroghly or if you want a little bit easier time to quest I would recommend questie. Real mob health is an addon I would recommend so you can see the health of enemies. But other than that there is not really any addons that are needed. Just enjoy the game and you will surely stumble upon addons that you will end up liking. This how my addons folder looks like https://i.imgur.com/WnMZNfB.png

---
None really, ppl didn't have a lot when the game started. When you get to higher levels you might want to read some more about them. My favourites are elvui and tellmewhen. 
---
Many ppl will say Questie - this shows quest info on your map and this is pretty great. Imo a lot of probs with vanilla quests was finding the damn things.
---
PVE, you will heal and thats all you do if you want to be taken seriuosly
---
PVP, you will heal and thats all you do if you want to be taken seriuosly or you run around hoping for Windfury procs on cloth classes while hiding from warriors and rouges
---
Not only that, we don't know the numbers behind those metrics. All they said is medium is more than the most popular realms of the past. Medium could be 5k and full be 10-20k. If that's true, than all those full/high realms may represent only 200k people. That's not that many people when you think of a game launch, retail wow, or old player counts. 
---
Regardless, I'm excited and glad so many people are wanting to play. There'll be a lot more over the next few days. Hopefully there isnt a sharp drop off.

During BC on Ravenholdt &lt;RPvP&gt; there was a troll that hung out in Ratchet named Rastamon.

---
Paladin cannot "effectively" AoE farm with ret aura and shield spike, lol. Even with consecrate, you'd take way too much damage and would only be able to pull 3 or 4 mobs at a time which is barely "aoe farming".
---
Hunter and Mage are in the top-tier of leveling when it comes to speed and damage respectively, bad comparison.
---
Why would you pull 3 mobs at once? Are you seriously trying to argue that Rogue is bad because you can't pull 3 mobs at once? fucking lol
---
Nah, I've leveled all classes in vanilla (except warlock), I would not put Rogue anywhere near the "lower brackets".
---
What is your go to site for best talent tree builds?
---
Shamans are great, but only resto shamans are viable in PVE. There will be a lot of them in raids due to totems only applying to your group and not the entire raid, so many are needed.
---
You can play enhancement, but your damage is bad compared to the pure DPS classes so there really is no point to bring an enhancement shaman, other than the totems provided.
---
Unless you use the weapon Nightfall to apply its debuff, but there are better alternative than enhancement shamans for that aswell.
---
Elemental shaman goes oom too quickly for PVE but is a fun spec in PVP.

What is the t0 set? How do you get it?

does not work on classic :/
---
It sure is a blessing. I'm running Classic on a very old computer that had one of the early SSD:s available. Just 100 GB in size. Windows 10 takes up a lot of space and I have quite a bit of other programs on the disk as well. 
---
 Was worried that classic would be 30 GB or something. Would have to run it then on the second non SSD harddrive. My computer needs all the help it can so the SSD makes a big impact for running Classic.
---
 How much space does retail take up by the way?
---
Good guy esfand. 
---
I can’t wait to see what STV is like on The Fae server!
---
I like Vanilla.
---
I'd say it's more there are very few classes that don't have downtime for some resource. Warlock and hunter (I'm guessing based off how fast they are reputed to level) are kind of unique for that.
---
So no, the vast majority of the players do something to that effect and it's not the end of the world.
---
How do I figure out which country I love in?
---
Can you Min max any harder? Smh.
---
Stretch it.
---
It has nothing to do with the auction house, but it saves the inventory and bank of your alts so you can see what is where without relogging.
---
Both targets do need to be moving for leeway to be active.  Your understanding of what it does seems to be flawed.  
---
I'm moving, you're not = no leeway.  You're moving, I'm not = no leeway.  We are BOTH moving = leeway.
---
Here's a good demonstration that shows while his warrior is not moving, but his target is (technically running, but stuck on a rock lol), leeway does not activate.  It's not until both he and his target are considered to be moving that it activates.

Delet this
---
For EU servers, the ping is ~300ms from SE Asia. In the vanilla days, we had more than a few raiders who played on this ping regularly, so it should be playable. However, some players are more sensitive to delay. If you want to PvP, you'll have a harder time.
---
I like the Tagged picture better
---
Your statement on PVE is correct, PVP not so much.  30/0/21 Elemental Shamans are the kings of burst in PVP.
---
This is right, but Blizzard blocked full support for these types of add-ons a long time ago. 
---
If it was ported to Classic, it would still work for showing buffs, but you would not be able to right click to remove the buffs.
---
Not true for pvp, best spec is ele/resto
---
Auto invite doesnt work anyway. You are gonna have a dps only group if you enable it..

Four classic I believe the only thing you can do with people from other Realms is PvP battlegrounds. And even then you can't group with people from other Realms, you just get matched against them. Otherwise everything else is contained within your server.

Thick leather can be sold to a LW early if they level fast enough because the price of it is dictated by the fixed prices that some leather items have when sold to a vendor. Same with rugged leather however it requires recipes dropped by 50+ mobs.
---
weird that you so confidently gave advice but admit knowing not much about the pvp side of things.
---
Press try for free add a Starter Edition World of Warcraft account of **your Region**&lt;--- That one is Important you can not play on NA servers with EU account and Vice versa. Then u should be able to download Retail WoW and Classic WoW.
---
I’m mowing the lawn, going grocery shopping, showering and I should be good for a while.
---
It really is cringe how many up votes this got
---
Alright thank you
---
Oh did twitch buy curse? Can you still use it to manage add-ons or is it not worth it any longer? (I assume so since no one recommends it anywhere?)
---
Since they removed the auto-invite feature, I suppose it's not as bad anymore. Only the auto-invite feature and possibility of further improvements like a gearscore check or maybe something similar to raider.io that checks your clear status on dungeons could have made it too close to the retail dungeon finder and not in line with the spirit of classic. So it makes sense they are trying to limit the functionality. If it just lists people that are spamming LFG searches it's totally fine.
---
2 sleeps if you want to go hard on release imo.

I have my mouse cursor movement bound to my keyboard, so i use keys to steer the cursor to click on the spells i want to cast.

uninstall DirectX 11 and install it agian.  
---
If it doesnt work, reinstall WoW
---
So your theory is that all that running is worth it because there will be less tauren than orc/trolls?  How long do you think the run took you?
---
Low effort meme. Upvote
---
You could also just let them have their opinion and play what ever game they want instead of shoving classic down their throats
---
 Yup it's like being a kid the day before Christmas. haha I must admit the launch has made me feel very childish but can't help it. Amped up to do some gnomish warlockly things.
---
Why ignore the noob when you can point out how they are wrong?
---
I forgot about that! good idea
---
Let the toxic private server players cry about dead realms so that us normal people can roll on them
---
this the updated one?
---
Will you be doing meal prep at all? I bought a ton of rice/eggs/sausage/broccoli because I find those to be easy, cheap foods that require no skill to cook and re-heat up well as leftovers.

Sounds awe some i will hit you up 27th

You'll have to be in range for the scream! I'll trinket and be gone like leaf in the wind!!

Ironically, mages will probably have the lowest /played to 60.  We'll see this week, though how the aoe grind goes with the leeway.  It should still be possible.

I haven't been subbed since last Blizzcon but I re-installed the client yesterday and it let me pre-download the 4.5 GB without an active sub, but it wouldn't let me reserve characters.

Good on you man, see you in Silithus, AoE grinding elementals for MC.
---
Getting so cared.

I think you are wrong, when i played stresstest you could learn it from lvl 1 on, if you had the 10 silver in you inventory.   
---
the lvl 10 comes from p-servers

Aight, time out ... When I had to go out looking for jobs, I'd dedicate 5-6 hours to walking around downtown areas and walking inside of EVERY BUSINESS there (even womens clothing shops as a straight man, and car dealerships as a man who knows nothing about cars), and I'd ask if I could speak to the manager. Most of the times, they went and got the manager : 
---
"Hey! I'm Tribewalker &lt;gives firm handshake&gt;. I figured I'd meet you personally to ask if there are any positions open?"
---
I almost always got calls back on the first day. 
---
*You're doing something wrong*
---
You need to be actively and aggressively chasing after a job right now. Like, TODAY.
---
Unless you have a really messed up situation somehow and its literally physically impossible to get to areas with businesses or to work at businesses, then its time you put your boots on and make it happen. 
---
Maybe you have social anxiety?? Guess what? - the only way to overcome that is by exposure therapy. Of course every introduction &amp; interaction will be different. You will meet many different managers, and sometimes the manager wont even be there and you'll just have to ask the employee for an application. Some managers will seem annoyed that you're wasting their time. Others will be totally awesome people and they will like you. But in any case - blazing through it, door to door with *purpose*, will ensure that you both expose yourself to and open up to the social situations that you fear, which will allow you to overcome them in time.
---
Dress relatively nice. 
---
When you finally get a job, dont be lazy. Work hard at whatever role you accept &amp; are assigned to. If you push yourself to work like a maniac and just be a badass worker who's ready to conquer for the first hour of your shift, the momentum will almost always carry over throughout the rest of the shift &amp; you will be known as a hard worker and a valuable employee. You gotta be a go getter, man.
---
If you secure a steady part time or full time job by September 5th and provide proof, I'll buy you your first month of game time. Good luck.
---
DUST YOUR COMPUTERS OUT!!!

As long as you level first aid and keep food on you it is only slightly painful to level a warrior. However you become a boulder at 60 gaining godlike power at 60. Just be prepared for a lot of slows and snares.

Going orc simply because rogue pvp trinket doesn't remove stuns.

I’ve had groups like that. I just told em to run because I’m not rezzing. And when they didn’t, I kicked em and found a replacement. I do the same thing in retail when people refuse to make an effort to get to the mythic or raid lol
---
ok thank you. I think i will :D
---
Genius. That's something I've 100% been putting off doing. Takes under 5 minutes but I have been thinking about it for months and months.

If you'll take a mage I  am interested if you guys are intending 16+ hours a day at least.

Did you play Nostalrius when population was 10-15K all day long? I did. SpamThrottle and chat was fine. No ridiculous addons necessary.

What would be a good weapon for a human warrior (sword and mace skill +5 for both) for questing and stuff in the late 40's to mid 50's?  I expect that I'll be using a Bonebiter, Rockpounder, or Stoneslayer as my weapon around level 45-48, so I'm wondering what would be a good upgrade from one of those prior to me obtaining enough gold to afford an Arcanite Reaper from 58 onwards.  I'm currently considering Princess Theradras' Scepter, the Lavastone Hammer, and the Blackrock Slicer as intermediary weapons, but other suggestions would be plenty welcome, though I feel the need to mention that I'm less likely to go for really random RNG drops/ expensive items from the AH.  I prefer items that I can semi-reliably farm from dungeon bosses and earn from quests and stuff, not stuff I need to drop crazy gold on or get lucky and get a super rare drop with high-end top damage from a random mob.
---
Oh, we're doing funny WoW movies? This one's quite a while away from vanilla, but still good:
---
[Meet the Hunter.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uTrOc0lfXY)
---
lul imagine rerolling because you are impatient to play a game your gonna quit in 2 weeks. I'm gonna be happily leveling 2 months from now in pyrewood while you do your island expeditions in retail mate.
---
Yeah, and I've heard they're making a RTS game based on these two games, quite similar to Starcraft. I wonder how are they gonna call it...
---
Love it!
---
This is very close to what I'm thinking of doing. I also value good sleep very much, so I'm thinking of looking up some kind of short yoga/meditation routine to do before bed to get to sleep a bit faster. I would rather rest really well for 7 hours and have a sharp mind all day, than have 5 hours of tossing and turning in bed, not being able to switch off.
---
It's funny how this time around, I'm much more concerned about establishing healthy habits than having junk food and alcohol.
---
Weird time for the Winterveil Holiday
---
The information on the video is still cool and worth sharing.
---
Will do 👍
---
disengage is a melee range agro drop similar to feint works in classic
---
On private servers they had a level requirement of level 10. In the classic beta there was no level requirement at all if I'm not mistaken.
---
Waaas habe es gerade gesehen :000 wtf kann ja nur n druckfehler sein

Haha was für'n Ding

JESUS DO u have a Micorwave next to your PC?, do you coincedentely also have a sh\*t bucket? :P

---
I can't read this all cause holy shit dude but im just going to defend my self with the fact i live in a very small tower that has almost nothing to do for work that isnt out side in the sun which can kill me if i stay in it to long. and tbh I don't really care to argue i was making a joke in order to tell the dude he was lucky and awesome.
---
I see no reason to take time out of my day to spoon feed you things you can gather yourself. This is not a paper, and you are not a reviewer. I have no stake in convincing you, nor do I care about whether you believe me or not.
---
Read the code, or don't. I don't care.
---
Alliance too plz! And I know my friend always go repair and forget ammo. Would it be possible to also make it tell you your ammo count as soon as it is a vendor?
---
That’s where your tracked quests will be displayed. Unless you’re reconfiguring your whole UI.
---
I really hope this does come over.. This is an addon I use a lot on retail and it would be great to organize abilities and items and such with the multiple ring menus..
---
There is a RingMenu addon now for classic but that addon only let's you use a single 12 slot ring.
---
Different realms are almost entirely separate. The only exception is battlegrounds. They pull players from several different servers into the same match but there is no way to ensure that you end up with your friends.
---
So you won't be able to even see people from other servers, not group up or communicate with them in any way. You'll need to either decide which friends you'd rather play with or split your time between characters on several realms at once.
---
Cleaned my apartment, washed dishes, did laundry and stocked up the fridge today. I'm ready for launch baby!
---
Around 60 GB. Btw. Classic will probably take around 10 GB or so in phase 6, so make sure you got enough space for that.
---
Jokes on you guys, I'm doing an armed security shift from 2130 to 0930 right now. When I get off and then pass out classic wow will be here!!!!
---
I like Poland spring the best, Tbh. 2nd is smart water.
---
Nostalgia intensifies. Honestly can't wait for this game to start really feeling like an RPG again and I'll be a broke ass like every other game I play.
---
Rolling a lock so I'll have a mount at least.
---
Pretty sure the movement part came in wrath. Disengage as a spell is in classic but its not the same spell you know
---
I can’t speak for OP but working the Auction house is one of the things I really enjoy in this game
---
Racials really don’t matter. Filthy horde don’t even get fear ward as an option. Had a nelf priest during vanilla, no one cared about race. Except maybe my guild leader (also main tank), who would grumble after each ony wipe. 
---
Have fun !
---
Name your druid Prancealot. 
---
You're welcome.
---
Chances are those will be bull also.
---
Launch day Resubs will be headed to lower pop
---
Hm can I skill it on my lvl1 bank char?
---
well, only your classquests. It doesn't affect the xp gain that much. Just do your classquests when ever you want or is available.
---
Then you Shadowmeld, done
---
Its only 10 mins to get to mulgore and sets you up in later levels wuite nicely. If grinding is you're thing there is a MASSIVE cave in mulgore full with goblins on the east side with only one wuest to go in there, i plan to grind there from 8-11 if questing isn't fast.
---
Good question
---
Just got off the phone with blizzard. They said they're delaying the launch until Friday because of this post.
---
N Elf Males look awesome when shooting guns also.
---
Paladins had divine shield, which was only for themselves, and blessing of protection, which could be cast on any friendly target including themselves. Both provided physical damage immunity which conveniently happens to be what you take when you fall.
---
You don't need to ask for a refund here :)
---
&gt;  but a warrior vs a mage of equal skill will always result in a dead warrior.
---
[Someone hasn't watched enough Swifty.](https://youtu.be/HUPexEfCG7g&amp;t=8m5s)
---
What do you mean. Still blame the Hunter.
---
The Sword of a Thousand Truths! Apparently it could cause 120 damage per second, with an instant mana burn and an enchantment that boosts its stamina +80.
---
That's interesting, thansk for the heads-up. 10 GB should be fine. Could probably reinstall some stuff on my second harddrive.
---
Why are against an improved /who list?
---
Honestly? 
---
This addon just takes people from chat and displays them... so instead of /who *class* and *level* and talking to many people who aren’t interested, the addon shows you people that are so you can communicate with people and see which one has the time, knowledge, role capability you are looking for.
---
I feel like so many people misunderstood the intention of this addon and took a 30 second clip of an auto/invite via keyword as a direct link to retail LFG.
---
Fact is that auto invite was used in classic for 40 main raids through CTraid and call to arms for big PvP matches in the world. The addon creator really only intended the auto invite for that purpose.
---
i used to play during vanilla bc wolkt and after on pservers. IF i can find good parties for the first dungeons (rfc,wc,sk) i ll skip them, i assume towards lvl 40 ppl willhave learnt or will know the game. i have already experienced long runs with new players a lot of times.
---
but i will stay polite as i will play on a rp pvp server
---
Ich war noch nie so sehr auf ein Spiel gehyped :b
---
Thanks man, I put more time into this vid than my other ones by writing a script and actually recording voiceovers. I don't play alliance though sorry!
---
i feel that you didn't read what I typed either cause you seem to be ignoring what i said about the fact that there is no jobs to even dress nicely too or the fact working out side could kill me but i guess that doesnt matter as long as you seem right to yourself.
---
I don't know man, I post all the time in here..
---
Maybe lvl 10 is dual wield, that's what I must be thinking of
---
Gold. Take my upvote.
---
Yes one permenant and one temp
---
This is true. I have been a Horde player since day 1 November 18 2005 5:06am PST. I dabbled here and there on Alliance but I can't stand the cutesy bullshit on that side. NUD RAS MAJIS!!
---
Oh, I wasn't aware of this. How did it work? Did you just stop falling when you switched to totems POV and game forgot from how far you were falling before?
---
Well most of us now have limited time to play and we would like to still have a descent populated server to play in but not with not queue.
---
You gotta delete system 32
---
There was also no level requirement in the beta that went to level 40. No comment from 2004 to 2006 mentions that you need to be level 10 to learn those skills so it's most likely something private servers picked up from their tbc backport in the early days.
---
Gnome looks like a mage. Tauren better not be charging unless hes 7+ levels above.
---
sell the dog first ez
---
I did picture of stormwind in retail with my filter settings. [https://imgur.com/a/fV5fnVG](https://imgur.com/a/fV5fnVG)
---
Might have to download the 2, to better see them side-by side.
---
The filter can be changed a lot for preference.
---
That's awesome! Congrats on getting your name, it sure adds to the excitement for sure.
---
Permanent enchants from Enchanting yes. Temporary buffs like grinding stones or mana oil conflict with Shaman's own weapon buffs. It's why Rogues can't use poisons if they want to benefit from WF totem.
---
IIRC Yes, weapon enchants are separate from the Shaman's spells of buffing them up.
---
Ready for diabetes!
---
I know the social economic and census data for the kingdom of Stormwind better than I do my own city, state, or country. I do believe we share a common interest.
---
This is the right thing to do. Willitclassic.com
---
Searchable with links.
---
No, you picked orc/troll, deal with the mayhem! Dont come bringing it to mulgore!

Only works on 64 now

It's like 18 hours a day usually.... On most servers lmao

I’m just going about my usual duties. Visiting my fathers parents today then taking care of my lawn when I get home and ending the night with some 13 reasons why

I just had to put down my 10 year old German shepherd/Rotti on Friday and as someone who’s never experienced WoW before , the release of classic has been a godsend for my mentality during
---
Cheers and enjoy your release day
---
4set darkmantle is arguable bis set bonus for raids
---
Tauren don't have anything good? Lmfao only class / race in the game with an AoE stun
---
From level 1, if you have the 10 silver.
---
I went and trained swords on my rogue in the stress test as soon as I had the silver for it.
---
i m over yours xD
---
the cringe is real
---
This is the correct answer, you can have one permanent "Enchanting" enchant on your weapon, and one temporary "Shaman" enchant.
---
Flipping glorious!
---
I mean....he's not wrong.
---
It's time to play classic.
---
I'll make a nice feast.
---
It's should be fantastic.
---
How do I find a warrior and priest?
---
What you are describing is a goddamn fanny pack and you know it, you sick son of a bitch!
---
I don't know how much it will be exactly, but I know that Vanilla also started with around 4 GB but at the end (before TBC) had around 15 GB hardware requirements. Some content like battlegrounds and most raids are still missing in the current classic version. I don't think it will go to 15 GB but I think 8-10 GB sounds realistic to me.
---
I start my master's in a month :(
---
Shame you can't get a "Sir" title for the warrior.
---
I tried this today and got kicked out
---
No one has played yet so no one knows
---
I swear it makes you do more damage! just from pure intimidation at least.
---
I don't know. Did you get a chair that can support your 200kg as an american when you bought the game ?
---
All those empty bottles she drinks will be full of something else 
---
Hardcore status reinstated
---
It will take them less than 5 minutes to launch a fresh server.
---
10 copper.  Gathering professions are level 1, other professions are level 5.  A skinning knife is 82 copper.
---
&gt; **windows down** 
---
You playing from a car?
---
Cross-realm bg’s. That’s it
---
game launch will be real smooth, you can subscribe right now
---
Ok?
---
;)
---
Nope, all 3 on one. Grob Mob or bust!
---
Using NVIDIA's GameStream + Moonlight android app is superior to anything mentioned in this thread. It's low latency, supports various input sources and can be used over internet if you have good enough connection.
---
for anyone wondering like i was, they fixed this in 1.10 so it won't be in classic
---
By some PvE bosses you mean the vast majority of PvE bosses with notable exceptions.
---
Even warriors can’t tank 100% of the PvE raid bosses in vanilla. Not saying that warriors overall aren’t the best tanks in vanilla, just saying that Druids are also great and for some fights even better than warriors.
---
My idea too. People so dedicated to reserve names on day one of it being available likely will stay the longest as they tend to be the more hardcore people. I want full world, don’t care if it’ll slow me down. I just want people in EVERY ZONE for months. New people will google what’s most popular realm and join it too. Even if it’s a post from 6 months in the past, they’ll likely still join whatever realm is most populated.
---
Kinda shitting bricks. Firemaw is increasingly looking like a nightmare, but we can't get our people to agree to move yet again. Every survey shows it as the most populated by far. It hit Full today. I'm starting to seriously consider abandoning my guild.
---
My plan is to go to bed early and get up at like 5. Hopefully by then, it'll be clear how bad the queues are. If Firemaw is as bad as it seems, I legitimately might just abandon my guild. Kind of a weird feeling, but I really don't wanna spend 50% of my day in queues for the first weeks.
---
Are the graphics improved in some way? I’d liketo give it a go for nostalgias sake but it’s a stillborn if I have to look at those hexagon pupils ever again.
---
I'm unable to download classic today. I don't have a sub. I've tried starting the download for retail, but the version drop down still only lists Live.
---
Well temp could be wizard oil too. But only 1 temp. But ele an resto should be using oil
---
You are getting insane boost to 2h fury with windfury, It's one of the few specs that's just outright good for horde but hard to do on alliance. (Spamming hamstring to proc windfury = your 2h hits hard) Can't do it on Alliance.
---
Aw that's unfortunate =/ thank you for the reply
---
I expect 15k+ players in queue
---
Surprised I had to scroll down to the bottom to find this.

My general play style has been to list items at max time and wait until prime to have everyone purchase. I never thought about all the extra money I could save just waiting for prime time to post.

Thank you for the tips!

You should be able to stay on the realm list page.
---
Once it changes from locked to low you can login, the best way to reserve your name quickly would be to have it in your clipboard and paste it into the field as soon as you see the character creation screen.
---
I actually made a video about this topic recently, the idea is you spam Touch of Weakness while equipped with a weapon that is 1.5 speed or faster so you get "free" melee attacks in between your spell casts.
---
Hmm... try uninstalling battle net and reinstalling it.
---
This is just his Mtn Dew fridge, did you forget to stock yours? It's not too late friend!
---
The racials are better, but Paladins as a class offset the difference. Paladin healers are completely game changing.
---
That’s not how probability works, (90% chance to miss a stun in a stun lock).
---
Orc is the better race for rogue. Better choice for dps and there are far more stuns in the game than fear/mc’s because everyone is hyping engineering. The rogue trinket removes fear but not stuns.
---
UD have an advantage sitting on priests and locks. 
---
The best race for rogue vs rogue isn’t even on your list, and that’s dwarf. But. all of this is pretty trivial as you’ll see plenty of rogues out there with suboptimal race choices that are getting it done.
---
Find the Madseasonshow Classic Nostalgia video, its really worth your while
---
Ringmenu you say? Better than nothing I suppose.
---
Guess I gotta get used to getting ganked by undead rogues again.  :(
---
I feel like horde fanatics have forgotten or never known what it was like without paladins on your side.
---
It does
---
wand with that quiver tho, is it still working?
---
Sad... With buddies you could beat some bosses like onixya ! Lot of fun !
---
Does it work for classic?
---
My heart beats for the Horde, but I like this picture
---
in the same boat dude. Can’t fucking wait

I am just using a razer with two side buttons. What I do is change the buttons using synapse to left alt and left shift, so all i have to do is press either of those and I have access to 15 more keys per button press. If that makes sense

Perception only lasts 10 seconds, in a duel (I'm assuming OP is asking about duels since he wants to be a NE) its easy to avoid with LOS (trees, rocks, buildings, etc). Perception is less about the rogue and more about the person using it, its all timing.

Being an enchanter first day/days staying in the first town and selling wands for 15 s, that makes you profit

Yeah but a lot of people hate it, they prefer the Undead zone for example which is very linear and is just a gloomier version of the Human zone, more or less, in terms of layout.

much better

Except like every priest will go tailoring enchanting to get wand off the bat and Truefaith Vestments at cap.

It should look something like [this](https://imgur.com/a/hUWK8hi)

You need an active subscription in order to play, but you shouldn't need one to download the game. Well, subscribing should fix it.
---
Already cleaned my whole place yesterday. Doing my car today.
---
Will classic be open to anyone with a subscription?
---
I mean 4 new PvP Realms and 1 PvE Realm should be enough to react with even more when necessary. I'm kind of sceptical about the german Realms as there are no new announcements so far.
---
Anyways, I'm happy Blizz does it this way. I rather have difficulties joining on Day1 than difficulties finding a Guild at 60.

Frost/Arcane, but the fact that you're a Mage isn't (wouldn't) deter me from ganking you the moment you sit down to drink though. Rogues/Druids will literally be salivating at the thought once they spot you.
---
I saw another post saying 6:30, is it confirmed for 6?
---
By far
---
\* starts slow clap\*

It's raining Warriors! Hallelujah!

Once you get to the character selection screen keep in mind that it will automatically log you out after 30 minutes.  So if you get in to character selection 30.1 minutes before launch you will be unable to log in.  At that point you need to log off and get back in queue for character selection.
---
From what I remember both work. It’s white physical damage.
---
Outrage culture in a nutshell. People need a boogeyman to be mad at, this week it's this addon so anything that's seemingly pro-ClassicLFG even if it's a simple explanation of what it does gets downvoted.
---
Important! If your account is new (starter account) know that it may take a few hours before your order is complete and the game recognizes you're subbed (Blizz says up to 24 hours) so it's better if you activate the sub quite in advance.
---
Also for Mage. You always wand when a mob is near death.
---
To me it looked like you could learn weapons at level 1 on the stress test. Could be wrong though.
---
You're right. This song will play when I play Alliance...  
---
The song which leaves behind a trail of mutilated Horde behind me.
---
This is amazing. Started listening to The Scourge of Lordaeron and immediately knew what I'm listening to at launch.
---
I'm just afraid you needed to download the normal version, wanted confirmation on that
---
Glad you found the tips helpful!
---
Think of listing short duration auctions as paying the same price for multiple times the possibility of selling your auction. In other words, for the deposit fee of a single "very long" auction, you can list it for "short" duration several times over multiple days during prime server time for the same price. This drastically improves the reward to risk ratio, especially on low margin or high vendor price items.
---
He's bad.
---
Honestly if you want to heal as a priest then human spirit is a good racial! 5% spirit
---
If you use Beserking for any less than 20% you actually will get 0 additional frostbolts off during the duration of the buff. That being said it’s nice in Naxx for sniping the Ignite in you name at the start of a fight.
---
Hunters make you wanna pvp your own faction. 
---
Rogues are just doing what rogues do. You don’t hate a pitbull cuz he bites you. It’s a pitbull that’s what they do.
---
You can also ask a friend(s) you trust to also reserve the name for you incase you get stuck in queue
---
It looks like you are just trying to argue for the sake of arguing.. 
---
&gt; this isn't socializing what you are talking about 
---
If a game that promotes you to social interaction doesn't correlate with socializing then there's really no persuading you.
---
Anyone else gonna be a naked orc warlock in the middle of the Barrens disenchanting all their gear to afford Greater Magic Want at level 14?
---
Trending videos are a scary concept, lol
---
Warlock is pretty similar to a Shaman. As long as we think ahead with a soulstone
---
Have 3 if them....just have a huge dish out of food and a big ol' bowl of water. I can leave them for a week alone if I wanted
---
Pick a leveling spec and respec once you hit 60, there is really not any reason not to. The first respec cost 1g, the next cost 5g, and then each respec keeps on inceasing with 5g untill it caps at 50g. 
---
But what everyone never mentions, is that if you go a full week without respeccing, the price will actually drop by 5g each week. 
---
So unless you plan on doing multiple respecs the first weeks, there no really no reason not to just respec at 60, as the prince will go back down to 1g a week later anyways...
---
I'm thinking about switching sides- the orcs shall rule!
---
It would be nice if it were instant. Most of the times i find myself wasting my time trying to cast it off while i get pumbled to death. It's definitely not instant. You gotta stand in place for a second in order to get it off, its so annoying.
---
Not even the imp?
---
I just licked it and it tastes a bit like a hot cheeto. Maybe it's just the chemicals in varnish
---
I'm leveling with a friend, but if anyone wants to level up with some friends, feel free to hit me up and you can come with us! :) We're from the UK.
---
Try Storyline addon. It's available for classic. You can give it a test drive on retail today if you want to get the gist.
---
I have TONS of these, and lots of unscratched loot cards as well.

---
not leveling, but i thought it was funny
---
as a mage if u want to make money, rather than doing professions u can aoe grind instances such as maraudon and brd, and later on DM.
---
i plan on leveling almost exclusively in instances from lvl 45 onwards. this way ill be filty rich by the time i hit 60 and will have my epic mount in no time at all.
---
Search "mage aoe instances lvling" on youtube for more info
---
Thanks man, I appreciate it. I spent weeks on these
---
Cant wait to utilize my google fiber advantage
---
It is half the reason I chose mage. I just want to be useful with ports bags and conjured food/water
---
cool but not relevant to what I said
---
Quick tell me the name so I can reserve it
---
As a child, we lived in the country with bad internet and a substandard Emachine computer. I couldn't have played wow if I wanted, instead I played runescape, which I could play on the rock I found in the cornfield.
---
I'm excited to gain proficiency at something I'm completely new to and that SO many people are getting hyped for!
---
This is likely promo art taken from an earlier version of the game, where factions weren't even a thing. If you dig around you can found screenshots of Orcs in Westfall or grouped with humans. PvP and factions were almost literally a last minute addition.
---
Im going in with a couple of friends, but they have kids so... yea in a week or so ill be alone.
---
I got two chairs one for me one for my dog
---
The queue won't move that fast... ;(
---
You didnt play warcraft3?
---
Go and try. I did yesterday and got booted. 15min in I've created a new char. 25 min in I've clicked around a bit. 30 min in I got booted.
---
Every if these servers will be full on release day. I'm sure the people that reserved names/crated characters so far are only a portion of the total player numbers on release day.
---
I want backpacks on my character so bad!
---
I don't think you need to download retail, just click the drop-down menu above the WoW play button and select Classic.
---
Yep, still got gauntlets of valor in my bank. Hoping I'll sell them one day.
---
This is awesome, well done :)
---
4 more servers will be released on monday, no worries
---
undead mage, start tailoring ench so i can get my wand at lvl10ish. then drop both for skinning and mining for leveling, bank ores and switch skinning for engineering at 60
---
I saw 3:00pm EST...
---
Downvoted because we've seen about 200 threads like this in the past 3 days.
---
I don't know what to tell you. Maybe the server I was on was fucked. General chat was insanely quiet and couldn't see posts from friends on the same server until we were in the same layer. I was on NA RPPVP server during stress test.
---
Hey guys, does anyone know if there are any disadvantages to leveling an undead mage in Durotar? Like, any class quests I miss or something? I want to re-experience my first time playing, but also not suck ass this time :D
---
It’s 6. And you can sit in the character screen upto 30’ early. Otherwise you might have a queue.
---
Dont join a guide before launch unless you know the people .... Just wait and you will find one while playing trust me
---
3 hour gym session tomorrow morning than food prep and after that relax and wait for launch.
---
She is clearly pump-faking it!
---
I never net this Guy. Guess im surround ed by aholes lol
---
I view playing the auction house as the hidden "PvP" game of WoW Classic. It is a much more nuanced and less visual form of PvP but battling it out with other auction house goblins is just as fun if not more so.
---
That was hands down one of my favorite trinkets as a Warrior in Vanilla. It's basically and instant win vs Warlocks... Not that you really need anything special to kill Warlocks in vanilla.
---
I was just checking out the graphics menu and it looks a look similar to Live with regards to the options and sliders. Was able to crank it to 10 and put 150% resolution scale on and it was looking a lot better than 2005 me remembers.
---
If I took time off, I'd go all in on the junk. Kind of jealous of people that are. :)
---
Buuut since I'm not, I'm going to prep my usual meals today and eat healthy through the week. I've lost 45 lbs and 6 inches off my waist in the last 8 months. I really want to keep my progress going.  
---
That said, this weekend is going to be a lot of soda and pizza. Gotta have fun sometimes.
---
Word. Well wish you luck man.
---
Whatever race you want as a casual player. I honestly cant recommend Troll, beserking isnt strong enough to justify the choice over Orcs' axe spec, blood fury, and stun resist, or even over Taurens' warstomp and melee range advantage. Also, as a Tauren your large model takes up more server space, in recognition of how awesome you are (I play a Tauren).
---
As a warrior I used to target critters and charged them as soon as I was in range
---
Anybody be interested in a full scan of this book?
---
he cant. his device was EOL'd a while ago. they dont officially support it anymore.
---
Tell me about it. Had all summer off besides my 3 12s a week but the moment nursing school starts back up blizzard wants to turn the servers on
---
who the fuck has exams during summer?
---
I believe Perception works like a flashlight if i recall correctly. If a human pops it and you enter the line of sight you're not gonna get a sap off. Also, There are things that increase stealth even further. If you hate rogues enough you can use like 4+ buffs to stealth detection meaning their only way of escaping is by mount.
---
She is gonna be mad because the picture you drew of her makes her look fat haha.  Looks sweet though.
---
Does anyone know more about layering and realm pop limits?
---
I know i've heard that 'medium' pop realms are more populated' then 'full' realms back in the day. I also know that layering is coming to supposedly make the initial start not absolutely horrendous with how many more people then a regular vanilla server will be logging in.
---
I guess i'm worried that classic wow already has bottlenecks in quests, and pretty bad spawn timers. If these spawn timers stay the same, but then all of a sudden the servers limit is 2-3x what it used to be, then this is going to be even more of a feel bad...
---
Naga Hex V2
---
I think it's perfectly ok
---
1) I'd assume because its 1.12 I'll be unable to get my old reins of the nightsaber back right?
---
2) Does anyone remember this really obscure pet spiderling that could prevent people from stealthing in duels/pvp?  I'm pretty sure it was removed.  That thing around in 1.12?
---
No, there is a drop down box slightly above the play/download button.
---
It's only like 80 ish days played to reach those goals
---
But even those are null points because that's not what I am talking about
---
Here is something to keep in mind, a lot of people have names registered across multiple servers.  I have names reserved on two right now because we were not sure how they were going to play out.
---
So "Full" on a lot of these servers includes people who are never going to play on that server.
---
Not to say it won't be a mess, but gotta keep in mind there are a lot of people on servers that never will play on that server.
---
Breathtaking.
---
Show me the proof, you're one of those zoomers aren't you
---
Classiclfg = call to arms 2.0, and the looking forgroup channel has always been there. Retard like you make.me.cringe, just look it up.for.yourself instead of blindly following your streamer buttbuddies
---
Missing undead rep?
---
But trolls can be mages, so no issue with training spells
---
What spec do you recommend for leveling ?
---
You don't need to go to the first classes. It's just all introduction crap.
---
Yeah, so long as you don't get dced you'll be fine.
---
This is perfect.  It also describes the type of crazy person that's staying on Herod.
---
I was about to say that it looks like a overkill to me. But then I realized you can't get both Mortal Strike and Deadwish at lvl 60 which was a common build in TBC. :D
---
I guess it's good when Berserker Rage isn't enough.
---
id much rather play on a "dead" realm with 2.5k - 5k players than on one of those overloaded streamer servers. 
---
1. on big realms there wont be any known personalities except streamers
---
2. ure basically anonymous on big realms, ninjalooting will have no consequences
---
3. ranking will be basically impossible on big realms
---
those are just off the top of my head
---
I was about to comment what about Hunter and Disengage? Until I remembered that wasn't a thing until much later. I'm stupid.

Lol you gatekeeping andy's who think everyone is gonna quit in 2 weeks are so sad... I haven't played BfA in months, Classic is my game. Sorry brah
---
SHIT IM DEAD
---
you only have one more day to wait.  Just binge videos on YouTube and prepare...
---
Can confirm its via cooking!
---
There should be a version drop down menu [right above the Install/Play button.](https://i.imgur.com/cA7i5PG.png)
---
yes you had 5k hp now everyone has 6billion hp so you take 5.5billion damage for falling
---
Thats what I've been thinking OP.
---
But I would also argue that blizz wont just keep pumping out new servers if it was just the same people making characters on all realms.
---
Does anyone have one of this fancy shaman levelling guide wallpapers? I’ve been looking all morning and can’t find one. Thanks!
---
The contents of that fridge would last me a month. I don't understand how people can drink that much pop/energy drinks.
---
&gt; **Addons you cannot start without** 
---
none
---
Only need to download classic, its about 5gig
---
Hardiness is the best pvp racial in the game. Will of the Forsaken is pretty good too.
---
That said, I think it's a lot closer than people tend to think and Alliance racials like Perception and Escape Artist are underrated.
---
:O
---
Im was a druid in vanilla .... you'r right... but in vanilla skills&gt;class

If you make them in exchange for the cloth, you both win. You get tailoring skillups without expending your own materials (except for thread), they get bags in exchange for a material they likely can’t use anyway.
---
Well it sucks because only US servers open on Monday, everything else on Tuesday.  So all of the impatient Non-US players are going to roll toons on this server for fun until the next day when their servers open up.
---
Thanks
---
Ah. I guess you need to sub then. I don't know if you need to download retail but it doesn't make sense if you did
---
I think the control and aoe dps is nice too once you have sweeping strikes combat feels great. Lots of slice and dice until then though
---
Did that PS ever get rid of the gold sellers?
---
Not really needed for Shaman as you get Tremor Totem
---
Its probably unwise to level your first toon with engineering as its massive money sink with very few profitable options (such as the gun you need for the ashenvale quest).
---
This! Hahahhaa.
---
Lol well you're the exception to the rule. Wait till you hit 30
---
Meanwhile, I'm over here hyped that I'll be able to play a faction with zero elves in it once again.
---
Lol
---
Is that a dwarf-sized Orc?
---
I thought hunters also used mana right up until cata... Or was going OOM just not a problem for them?
---
Healing Wave (HW) = 3sec cast, 2.5sec w/ talent  
---
Lesser Healing Wave (LHW) = 1.5sec cast
---
Chain Heal (CH) = 2.5sec cast
---
HW is marginally more mana efficient than LHW, but both output roughly the same healing/sec spent casting (ie 2x LHW is roughly on par with 1x HW). With the cast time talent that obviously changes and HW will heal more over any given period of time assuming multiple casts. Obviously CH is only efficient if it's going to heal multiple targets.
---
As for downranking, I'm not sure. On their own the lower ranks are less efficient, but I don't recall how the spell power coefficients affect downranked spells, it's been too long.
---
As for skills to buy, I like to have them all :P But if you're desperate to save money in the short term, you can probably leave behind the various elemental resistance ones, Sentry Totem, Tranquil Air and Windwall. Grace of Air is 50/50 really, as Windfury totem is superior for all physical DPS except Feral Druids and Hunters. Mana Spring &amp; Healing Stream are ok in dungeons, better if you have the totem mana reduction talent in Resto. A few totems might sound like a waste of gold but I would definitely pick them up-
---
- Grounding totem will redirect the next single hostile target spell cast at you, to itself. If that spell doesn't do damage, ie Fear or Polymorph, the totem is not destroyed and can potentially redirect *another* spell after 10sec have passed.
---
- Stoneclaw is surprisingly useful, for example if a mob is guarding a quest item you need to activate or a resource node is calling to you. Also good for peeling off mobs that are chasing you (IIRC it's an actual taunt so will always pull aggro regardless of your threat). Drop it before Magma totem to ensure Magma survives to do its full damage :)
---
- Searing totem can throw out a decent chunk of DPS, it's basically a mini Warlock Imp that can't run out of mana.
---
Don't skimp on any of the Elemental nukes unless you're playing on a PvE server. You never know when the opportunity to drop a big Chain Lightning will present itself.
---
*if elitism were a sentence*
---
That's not what you said though, you said the bags were "full of single fade leaf" etc. And a trade window has like what, 5 slots? So not exactly full either. a bag and 4 fadeleaf.
---
lord some of ya'll take this website far too seriously

"karma farming"? man, I have less than 50k karma after like a year and a half of posting on Reddit. I posted something I thought was funny and helpful. 
---
find something more productive to get upset about
---
Weather Underground
---
Ahh that may be why. I was on NA PVP. General chat wouldn’t quit! Could be different settings fir rppvp and pvp?
---
You mean you're going to solo instances to level from 45-60? Is that viable? I knew mages could solo a lot of instances below their level, but did not know they could solo dungeons to level.
---
Hopefully you tough it out and stick with classic for a while!
---
I looked I couldn’t find one. So I had to buy my copy used (obviously). 
---
It’s a great book with amazing art.

Yea i go to youtube n throw myself down conspiricy/ paranormal video rabbit hole till the world becomes scary again......then i tell myself 1 day.
---
Yes, the whole 10-60 is fine. Healing while leveling is easy for a shadow priest because: your gear is just cloth and cloth generally stacks caster stats like Intellect and Spirit so you dont need to swap gear to heal groups like a leveling enh shaman would. Your heals are very strong even without any talents.
---
As a tip, the disc talent "Wand Specialization" is huge for leveling. Take it and spirit tap, then go down holy or shadow taking any damage talents. At 40, respec to pure shadow to get shadowform, then put the next 5 points back into Wand spec, and finish out your talents in disc to 60.
---

Sorta. Friends are going ham on the first day but I have to work all week. Such is life of being an adult. So I'm joining in on the weekend. Then again, I don't mind going in alone and just enjoying the memories on my own pace.

true
---
It'll be nice :P I'm in The Netherlands so it seems like you and I will eternally be separated by a bit of water^(neeeeaar^(faaaaar^(whereeeever you aaaare)))
---
Good one ! Me also :))
---
I wouldn’t say anything would add a “big bonus” to your leveling. Skinning is good for $ while leveling and easy to maintain. 
---
Since you consider keeping mining @ max level id level that. 5 mining points a level is 300, easy enough. 
---
Definitely utility to being a blacksmith but nothing like alchemy for pots and such which you will blow through. I believe they can make fire resist gear and some necessities down the line. Sharpening stones are a thing I guess. 
---
Nothing really wrong with engineering if that’s what you want. I always thought more of a pvp thing but certainly utility in pve. 
---
GL!
---
Literally every priest niggo is gonna do this.
---
No definitely not.

But also thankful for the sheet

Food and drink. Lots of it.

Why bother tailoring if you only want enchanting for a level 10 wand?

I created mine on 2 servers (1 PVE and 1 RP), I'm deleting one (PVE) to move to the new EU PVE that opens right before launch.
---
Not deleting RP for now because I want to try it and getting good names for RP is much more difficult than getting names for normal realms.
---
Ofc if I see I don't like or I'm unable to RP, I will release my names on it.

Great work.  Exactly what made vanilla great.

I guess if layering is really bad you are probably better off just going to Mulgore at level 1 instead of waiting until 3.

So you wouldn't recommend it?

This is the only spider pet that I remember, unless you are talking hunter pets.  Scorpids had a posion sting that would break someones vanish if you had hit them earlier.  
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12264/worg-carrier
---
This non-combat pet was bugged for the first 1/2 or so of vanilla and would put poeple in combat and hit them for 1 damage.

All we are is dust in the wind, dude. Enjoy the ride.

Same for me! And when it's clear of all the sugar stuff im gonna fill it with water and zero drinks. They just did so much for fun 😝

Dude, you have to have ingame flirts with your ex. This is going to be Wolowitz-hilarious
---
mee!

It's a good story! Just go with it!

Same. Shadow priest or holy?
---
Don't forget that 4 Set for Warriors is stupid good for farming and PvP.
---
I'm cursed to be support in everything I play and I've played shaman and druid and I hate the aesthetic of paladins so I'm going priest.
---
Warriors were *really* weak at launch. Warlocks were about the only thing they could even beat.
---
Level cooking &amp; fishing at the same time with [THIS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rZCTbQQXfOv1KXBJokHYGt35zNdAqVaV/view)
---
&gt;Cant you play wow for free if you farm Gold to buy WoW tokens?  
---
&gt; How much time is needed to farm the gold? 
---
I think you can yes.
---
I have no idea sorry. I haven't played retail since patch 2.3.x. All I know is that the cost of WoW token varies in different regions. The less player playing retail in your region the cheaper the wow token gets.
---
You’re not role playing on here, say what he actually did and say he was role playing etc, but don’t be surprised if someone points out that what he stated was not at all possible, makes people doubt that the entire thing ever happened.
---
Are they closing down because of classic?
---
I, as an occasional shitposter, am not interested in plying my trade in a place designated for jokes.   I agree that a lot of the repetitive stuff gets lame fast (like the 12 days of classic wow thing that is karma whoring at it's worst).  
---
I guess I do agree with you that there is a lot of lame content that floods this sub right now.  For the last year we've had like 50k members, now over the last 2 weeks we're now up 218k.  With that many members who have nothing to do but anticipate the release of a game in less than 48 hours, there's going to be lots of low-effort content.  It'll fall off in a couple days.  There will still be lots of content, but not as much as we have seen in the last 2 weeks.
---
It launches on the 26th at 6pm est in North America
---
Tier 1 -Molten Core
---
Tier 2 - Onyxia &amp; Blackwing Lair
---
Tier 2.5 (not official)- Temple of Ahn’Qiraj
---
Tier 3 - Naxxramas
---
Bosses from these raids have a chance to drop gear specific to any one class. These pieces of gear have class specific set bonuses that are highly sought after. 
---
2 pieces = x
---
4 pieces = y
---
Etc. 
---
Does that help?
---
Leveling takes some time though
---
Love how he did the S every high school kid learned to do thinking it was graffiti
---
3/4 undeads so unexpected, all serveys were wrong!
---
Quality post
---
For pvp yes, for pve no
---
Then why are you here? I’m sorry that WoW almost ruined your life and I’m glad you have self control, but that’s not a good reason to come be a wet blanket in a sub for a game you won’t even play. You’re not even trying to caution people, you’re just being a bummer.
---
Dude shut the fuck up and lay off with the “tEcHnicAlly” bullshit. Today is the last day.
---
Gonna be consuming this stuff real slowly alongside my usual quite balanced diet. I don't even like mountain dew that much but needed it for the joke.... :S
---
I thought it was based off the 2006 card game.
---
undead meme
---
Uuuuugh, fishing/cooking was always the bane of my existence.
---
That’s kinda where I’m at at this point. Like let’s say we relocate to Skeram or Incendius. Me and my friends on launch might avoid some initial queues, but my brother the next day or so will probably still be in a situation where he has a really long queue. Oof. :/
---
New priest players unite
---
I see you figured it out :)
---
They actually keep the 3,5 Stars Review in that add. 399$ for 3,5 Stars? I rather get a 2/5 Stars Hooker for 50
---
It can work.  Swords weapon progression is easier though unless you grind dungeons for dagger upgrades.
---
This has to be some of the dumbest shit I’ve ever seen
---
So... like EverQuest?
---
Also if you take imp blizz it makes AOE farming so much easier. And fun!
---
Nice, nice
---
It might be full, but probably not as full as Shazzrah!
---
Paladin. Hands down. 
---
Blizz didn’t even try to hide this. Think about it...
---
It’s the only class in the game that has a second life if you eff it up (lay on hands)....and if you still can’t pull it off you can take a break, go read a guide and try again later (bubble hearth).
---
Are you sure that mod is updated for classic? It doesn't say anything about it that I could see.
---
Time zones brah. We all open at the same time.
---
US launches on 26th. 
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
I plan on doing skinning and enchanting.  I'll be an undead warlock forgot I need chanting for access to wands easier. Ruined my plans of skinning and tailoring lol
---
There will be pugs, the raid mechanics are so simple compared to retail
---
Sugar Free, the heck.
---
That's alright, first time I leveled as Prot, using weapons that looked cool. It'll go better this time.
---
Which race is easiest for UD to get a cross-race mount from? Assuming I start in their start zone to do quests for rep
---
My plan was to spend today doing housework and getting as much irl stuff done as possible. Unfortunately, I've been spending it waiting for a killer hangover to pass. Whoops . . .
---
Battle Groups*
---
Afaik you need to be lv.5 to learn professions. And then its only till rank 75/75
---
I played retail for a week and didn't talk to a single person, i joined classic stress test and team up with 3 people and we played for an hour or 2 and chating and loling
---
Move microwave close to pc. Simple.
---
True haha 😁 its like 900km from croatia to germany. But luckily there are not alot of people on vacation since all the kids have go to school 
---
i still have to register my name and server x.x still dont know which class to pick tho.  Cant decide between warrior (main in WoW), shaman (was my old main class, but i heard they are not that strong when it comes to dps), mage or hunter.
---
For once, a meme that fits me. As a casual, full and upgraded Tier 0 is my end goal.
---
    /script CastSpellByName("Holy Shield")
---
Haha impressive, very good.
---
I like the Pepe....cat?
---
Picked my twink class in Vanilla to main this time
---
I wanted to  know how to make sure that I had classic installed, and it turns out that u/TheCatHasmysock already answered my question!
---
&gt;No, there is a drop down box slightly above the play/download button.
---
Not sure why I read this in "Night of Bayonet" tone (from Band of Brothers series), lol, anyway, nice one.
---
Even if I play, it'll only be in October or later, but I felt this poem.
---
Well done /hug /cheer
---
I just watched this episode of Lost lastnight with my girlfriend who has never seen this show before. I made the same reference to going back to classic lmao she didn't react much differently than this
---
Shadow! I've got a great guild of friends I've played with on pservers for the last few years. I should be able to raid with the 16 debuff slots at launch.
---
full
---
Everyone’s saying tailoring will make you rich, but I imagine the AH will be flooded with undercutting. The 6 slot bags for example can be bought from a vendor for 5s, so you have to sell as less than that. Tons of people will end up listing at a loss, etc. I think it’d work well if you were rushing to cap it out and the first listing bigger bags, but unless that’s the case I feel like it’ll be too competitive to do well. 
---
Your plan would work pretty well imo.
---
What classes have specs that are good for both pvp and pve? Those 50g respecs add up quick : /
---
Another launch, another rendition of 'Twas the night before server launch. This ones really well done though so good job.
---
Hope not; you’re in it pretty deep when you’re using it for video games
---
But then that would make me a good hunter. We can't have any of those now can we!
---
Since I'll be playing a protection warrior, I won't have any weapon spec. As for arms I guess it depends what you plan on using the most. Orc only has an axe weapon skill level increase of 5 which really doesn't do much. I guess just go with what weapon you will end up using the most?
---
dont blame pitbulls, blame the damn owner.
---
I'm so sorry. :( I'll just crawl back under the rock from whence I came.
---
If I remeber correctly, Enhancement shamans are often taken in raids (especially with the Nightfall Axe). I don't think Elemental is really viable. 
---
Dungeon groups I wouldn't worry as much and if you find a guild that's not trying to min-max and are more laid back/casual you'll probably be able to get a spot. Hardcore raiding though you'll probably be expected to heal.
---
Dungeon tier 0.5 isn't available until Phase 5 when AQ unlocks
---
There’s a mining trainer in thunder bluff
---
I'm just saying that it's a recipe that has a base cost. so in the least people should be charging for the base cost of materials
---
Absolutely
---
Lock X faction creation until some sort of balance
---
I don't have much time as well. 5 hours a week max. I think we just have to try. Maybe pick a class which is easier to level?
---
I haven't made any yet. I can once I'm geared and out and about ganking, but I tend to play different than the usual rogue meta.
---
Even after all the shilling grob gets passed by its non-pvp variant lmaooo
---
Doing anything in classic will take a long time... But a launch like this will never happen again, do you really want to miss it?
---
If you're already subbed for BFA, what do you have to lose?
---
You dont need to be hardcore to enjoy the game. If your a little behind it wont matter becuase we know what's comming.
---
Happy we can have this experience again guys &lt;3
---
Still, that did not stop people from having a full bank of mooncloth bags. I would bet a lot of money on the fact that every single mooncloth bag would sell.
---
No, I don't like whining, bellyaching children who think that because they don't like something, that it's obviously wrong and bad.  Get the fuck over yourself.
---
A good deal of mature players are not going to be obsessive (despite all the funny comments otherwise) and are not going to lose sleep they can't no life opening day.
---
There's room for everyone. Yeah a lot of people are talking about how fast they are going to get to 60 but there are also SO many people who are gonna take their time. You'll be fine. Just play at your own pace and have fun!
---
Bags.
---
I want to increase my inventory asap. Should I buy vendor 6 slots until I can tailor my own? Anyone got tips or a guide on how to achieve that?
---
You, I'm torn between 30/0/21 shaman and mage. I'll do pvp and pve 50/50. What would you recommend having done shaman before?
---
RP servers actually tend to have higher retention rate
---
How exactly do you even use controls for WoW on an Android phone?
---
Yeah what the hell kind of pretentious assumption is that? Sounds like the type of player I definitely don't want to group with.
---
Ah, my bad. Just night elf zone then that lacks these trainers.
---
If you absolutely want to do raids and have time for them, shaman is not the character you want to go with if you don't want to be stuck healing. If you want to experience everything else in the game, you can play shaman and do dps, occasionally heal, and have a good time.
---
Last time I played vanilla I was a rogue on Nostalrius, and I found that even with a guild wanting to do dungeons it was a bit of a trying to get people for dungeons: slightly healers and definitely tanks. Most DPS will encounter this pain. As the party leader most of the time I loved having a hybrid in the group, but tbh I just grabbed whatever other 2 DPS I could get and waited for healers and tanks to appear.
---
Brilliant Nia, just Brilliant.
---
ikr, his whole post leaks the attitude of someone talking down upon others, as if he has experienced so much, and achieved so much, he can talk in this patronizing way
---
Noggerfogger elixir
---
&gt; It can make the grind for GM easier for the lower populated faction. 
---
so its a benefit for like 0.1% of the players
---
Not really, I’ve done it in the past. Nowadays I just try to keep carbs down as much as possible. But not hardcore less than 20g anymore. 
---
I’ll have a bagel, fruit, or yogurt. I just mainly try to avoid refined sugars.
---
Almost as stupid as changing your name to McLovin /s
---
It would look quite bad if I have WoW installed on my work computer.
---
I'd definitely watch that
---
dick
---
Traveler's backpack wasn't difficult to get in Vanilla. But I recommend doing the 16 slot Demon Hide Sack Q-chain starting at lvl 45 (Nethergarde Keep for Alliance) it's a great way to save you some money. 5 man group is required to kill the Demon.
---
They're very rare. The one I know about is the SM/Ruin warlock, but raids will want no more than 1 of those for the buff they give.
---
I think the people that come from retail we leave in droves. I sincerely feel all the people like myself that played back in Vanilla and only stuck around a few expansions before they didn't recognize the game anymore will stay for the years to come.
---
The hype is real and since private servers and beta didn't scare anyone off I think those people are here to stay. I can't speak for the private server people as I never indulged myself, but they seem equally as hyped for the game and they also keep enough of that young blood in the game (as in people that have a lot of free time in the game and can no life it while I am at work) that the population is going to be very steady after roughly 3-4 months.
---
No worries...  I travel too much so even if I had a desktop I’d still need a laptop to use on the road.  Decided to save some money and space and just go with it.  Historically I have always used a laptop for gaming even back during WoW in 2005-ish and at least the laptops that can support it have gotten lighter.  I had a tank of a laptop back then that was a back-breaker.
---
Shaman :
---
+ Formidable healer in pvp, stray chain heals can turn fights and we'll a placed chain lightning can ruin someone's day
---
+ Everyone loves your totems
---
+ You're always welcome in pve as a healer
---
- your raw healing output is pretty low compared to priests and hpallys
---
- you will always struggle to keep up with the other dps as enh
---
- elemental in pve is not viable
---
Mage :
---
+ All three specs are viable in pve and required as the content progresses
---
+ You make water, everyone likes you
---
+ Your dps will be solid
---
- you're made of wet paper
---
- you die very easily
---
- it's easy to kill you
---
Also naturally as a dps class you'll occasionally meet classes that just hard counter you in pvp but that's life
---
must be all the poor nutrition ....
---
I collected a full pre raid bis set in less than 10 days back in vanilla, attuning myself to every raid in the process. 
---
As a Hunter.
---
I don't see why it should be any harder now that I'm rolling tank.
---
This is amazing.
---
As a shadow priest in Vanilla I loved doing assaults on BS from LM in ABs.
---
No. If you dont like Deadmines and you love WC/the barrens, then there is no comparison.
---
Ahh yes, the personal blacklist of players I need to remember to hate
---
That’s why the picture only has one bullet
---
Well, westfall and deadmines are pretty much the counterpart to barrens/wc. You'll find most players will travel there to level, similar to the barrens.
---
So if for example I'm playing Shaman and and using a complete DPS build (1H+S), it should be enough to get through all the dungeons?
---
It's always fun to have people like him to discuss facts instead of "what I feel". You must be boring at parties.
---
If we assume you play a total of 9 hours a week and you're pretty adept at leveling (9 days /played) you'll be 60 in 6 months. Assume you're more average or try to enjoy yourself while leveling and take around 18 days /played you'll hit 60 this time next year. 
---
No you won't be current with content. But that's not always a bad thing.
---
Same here man. In 2004 I wasn’t even living in a country with reliable internet yet; idk if I even knew what video games were back then lmfao
---
Really wild when things get put in perspective like this. Feel so American now but came a long way
---
Less people? Warlocks.
---
Want to dps raids? Warlock. Want to heal raids? Priest.
---
Gute Zeiten mit cracksilber auf nefarian gehabt &lt;3
---
Interesting! Im gonna change this
---
They are adding 5 servers at 10am Pacific
---
Yep. They were non profit, so I believe they said if classic ever became a reality they would painlessly allow the transformation.
---
Its wrong way of thinking, after hype train  and bfa babies leave classic these 2.5k - 5k playerbase servers will be dead its normal way of thinking its better to stay on those overcrowded servers for \~1month then being forced to play on servers with \~200-1k players after downfall :)
---
Warlocks are amazing but they are not the best solo leveling class, that goes to either Hunter or Mage depending on whether the Mage has the opportunity to AOE grind.
---
I mean. I'm risking my legs falling asleep a bunch. Thats something right?
---
Holy is better dmg till 40. Just have the priest take 5/5 spirit tap.
---
Why bother releasing classic at all? It's the first step towards reaching BfA
---
Is it tomorrow for the UK?
---
Yes it’s worth it. It’s the only good thing about WoW. After wrath the game went to shit and stopped being fun for just about everybody. Retail wow is a literal joke and the reason so many of us have quit until we get official vanilla back.
---
Ur loss
---
No, vendor bags will always cost more than their player made equivalents on the auction house.
---
You are in the store to stock up on food for launch day. You get:
---
14 Red Bulls
---
10 Pizza Lunchables
---
18 Bags of Nacho Cheese Doritos
---
1 Mountain Dew
---
And a 24 Pack of Water (gotta be healthy)
---
Picture your shopping bag full of these items. Now I ask you this. Was the single Mountain Dew you picked a Code Red or Voltage?
---
Because I was curious, I double checked the survery:
---
46.2% of 52,598, or 24,300 players that responded *don't have an active subscription*
---
And that's not to say those who *do* have an active sub may not have reserved a name. We could have over 24,300  more players come launch. 
---
Another interesting results was 48.6% or 25,562 are not taking time off. Not to say all of them won't log on right when they get home, but that they have work obligations and (totally just guessing, but I think is a factor) others as well that may prevent them from playing day to day (like me). 
---
I wonder how many characters (or accounts, I'm not sure how they did it) they allowed to be on one realm before it was marked full. It sounds like we have more characters/accounts designated to Herod than can be played online at a time.
---
Nobody cares about your shitty stream
---
warlock pros: cool looking, good damage
---
cons: soul shard farming
---
priest pros: good healing, ok damage, always needed
---
bad: forced to heal, hard to solo content
---
Thor is the Shaman so I guess druid for Iron Man
---
I've not played Vanilla, so I can't speak to why veterans are returning, but I am going to play when it comes out.  I don't know if my motivations are shared by anyone else, but over time I've found that I tend to move from exploring and enjoying a game to mastering it and losing out on enjoyment. I'm an information addict, so if I open the doors to figuring something out online, I invariably min/max, which drives up my satisfaction momentarily but erodes the fun I have over the long term.
---
Blizzard didn't shit the bed so much as they developed down a path of appeasing players like myself, players who get addicted to understanding and professionalizing their experience. Classic feels like an opportunity to play a large game while choosing to limit my information-seeking habits.  This seems like what the original Vanilla community started as - a wide swath of people who were exploring and interacting with mechanics they didn't fully understand.
---
20 minutes?  
---
Shazzrah will likely have close to 10 hour queues at launch, other full servers won't be far off.
---
Because 90% of players will quit classic after a year or two. You can't really add more to classic without an item squish considering how power-creeped classic gets after BWL. Despite what people here say most people seem to think that TBC/WOTLK was the pinnacle of wow. If we get classic-&gt;TBC-&gt;WOTLk thats still 6 years or so of content, 6 years is a hell of a long time. 
---
From blizzards standpoint WORLK will most likely bring in more players without doing any actual works instead of investing millions in creating new content.
---
Nah it don't be like that
---
You can still create a char on them if im not misstaken?
---
From what I remember from actual vanilla, that rule only applied in Moonglade. Out in the world it was no rules. Especially in heavy farming area or overlapping quests areas.
---
The horde will outnumber the alliance in pvp realms. I know the game isn't out yet but I can guarantee this.
---
Was it tho? They gave me pally come BC lol at least lol
---
Correct. What percentage of people haven't subbed AND are filling in surveys? We know it's less than 100%, and reality is it's probably quite a lot less than 100%.
---
Yeah its like no one has ever heard of diet.
---
My tip. Squeeze half a lemon into a glass. Add ice.  Pour diet dew over it. Tastes like a sweet carbonated lemonade and you still get your caffeine fix.
---
Sad I missed this thread.  It was winter when I started playing.  My roommate and I were penniless, living in a tiny old ramshackle house with no heat.  The place didn't even have a front door when we moved in.  We burnt clothes and books and all of our garbage for warmth, no joke.  We still refer to that place as the Pit of Despair.  
---
I don't remember what I sold to buy two copies of the game, or what he sold to set up a Hughesnet satellite dish since we were in a rural area with no internet.  He and I played for two years - the tail end of vanilla and most of BC - with 2-4K latency.  We were both feral druids on PVP servers, and we'd learned to run in front of our targets and try to anticipate their movement in order to land melee blows on their backs.  I always really wanted to play a caster, but even with Quartz it was pretty much impossible to tell when a spell had actually finished casting.  
---
When I finally played with 200ms on an average connection, I felt like a GOD.
---
It's viable with a shield, but not optimal.
---
With friend and fortune, they will in due time.
---
Yes there will be a place.   My whole guild is a guild for casuals
---
Warrior - run from GY
---
Not necessarily, what the scarlet crusade is doing is good, it just isn't traditional, the only bad part about the crusade is they are a puppet of balnazzar unwittingly, without balnazzar I'm sure theyd be more inclined to work with fellow humans.
---
But again, that's not even what this discussion was originally about so your point is null anyway, I'm not talking about individual groups, I'm talking about paladins as a whole, and as a whole I believe they are chaotic good.
---
reseting the dungeon wont work, you'll have to suicide. as long as you can deal with the hydra i dont see why it wouldnt work
---
Nothing like a bit of gatekeeping in the morning.
---
It's the week before release. Shitposting is at critical mass. Wait until the servers open and it'll die off quickly.
---
I doubt too many of us have gone through subbing with a credit card that has no money on it because most of us understand how shitty being at the limits of your credit is for you long term.  If a WoW sub pushes you over the edge of that limit you might want to consider rethinking your priorities.
---
You can very easily change it to using the chinese version (no exposed bones, armor fully covers as for other races) with just a line in the config files, though it also means using the rest of the changes (graves instead of player skeletons, bread / oats and whatelse on other stuff and changed NPC models on skeletons and such). And it's not banable.
---
Maybe some of them will be using that.
---
Which classes have stealth or a way to drop combat?
---
"I *want* more women and LGBT folks joining my parties..."
---
Who the fuck cares? It doesn't matter at all.
---
God our culture sucks. It's actually *cool* to be LGBT now. It should be just as cool to be heterosexual. Or it should just not matter at all.
---
That's called equality. Something that you seem to be so obsessed with.
---
This subreddit in a nutshell.
---
For the Horde!! Fuck the Alliance scum.
---
It's ok reading is hard for some people
---
I will be rolling NE Warrior (probably the worst combo but I want Shadowmeld to be able to afk eat in peace lol). I will most likely roll with Sword Specs because I plan to pvp a lot.
---
LMFAO
---
Yes, if you are going elemental and have a decent amount of into gear you can heal, from what I’ve heard, all the way up to the 55+ dungeons. Or atleast at that point you should consider a healing spec
---
I really tried to enjoy Northdale, but the faction imbalance at 60 just made it a gankfest for horde.
---
Good luck killing a druid.
---
Warrior is grind mode, they take a while to gear and feel good. 
---
Shaman DPS is hipster mode, they're considered bad in PvE so gearing them can be a challenge. They're fine healers though.
---
Warlock/Mage aren't particularly challenging, warlock has some utility annoyances that mage doesn't have to worry about. Mages are also generally slightly more in demand, but also more common.
---
Shadowmelt does not work in combat

---
mograine has nice balance :O
---
Right sidebar, community options, user flair
---
There's pros and cons to both ways.
---
Imho, starting with a hard to level(solo)- class is better for several reasons:  The servers are new, that means many people just started and there's more grouping going on.  You can play with your friends and pick classes/roles important to your "fellowship".   You also KNOW you have a character that's wanted/needed later.
---
The alt you make could/should be a decent soloer so you can level him while waiting for a raid or friends to come on.  If it's a class that for some reason isn't as popular/welcome (screw them!) in raids etc, that's no biggie because you already have a main who is.
---
You can also use the reputation of your "main" team-critical character to get your alt invited.
---
Just my 2cents :)
---
Ya but you can get it tomorrow when they release new servers!! :D
---
Lol, I knew I was wrong. I was sticking to the joke though.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mounts-classic-wow#raciala-night-elf
---
Sounds like you're right about 1, sadly.
---
Wishing you safe travels from the US!!
---
Shaman is not a dps class.
---
False. WoW “stole” the successful parts of other mmos to make it what it is. DAoC will forever hold the title of the best an MMO can get and wow will forever be the clone. BUT they did it so much better it’s hard not to praise vanilla in all of its glory.
---
One of my fondest memories from Vanilla is levitating from Winterspring to Azshara :)
---
I was going to do the same on my Mage, but I saw some discussion about how herbs are likely going to be in very short supply initially, so I'm either going Tailor/Herbalism to get them as I go, or Tailor/Skinning for bags, robes and cash, then dropping both down the road. The downside to latter is having to revisit all of those low level zones just to farm herbs once I do - which makes Plan A more appealing. What are your thoughts?
---
Kale and bananas with purified well water. Essential oils with my healing crystals. 
---
Nah, I'll have some coffee, water and red bulls. I want be staying up past like 2am on launch night. Probably have some chips/crackers. Maybe pistachios and beef jerky. 
---
People get way too bent out of shape about their healthy snacks. Relax, everything in moderation.
---
Man, I can drive that far and still be in the same province...
---
I've driven 700km for family dinner and then drove home lol
---
two very different views of the world and the size!
---
I dont even know when Im gonna resub. New servers are opening again. I also really want things to settle down, streamers decide, etc. I mean we have official classic wow... there is no rush anymore:)
---
Yeah I've mad a character, I guess i'll make some on the new ones they release tomorrow too. 
---
Hopefully those new ones dont die out in population quickly!
---
I spent 2 hours in the yard yesterday. Grass mowed, weeds pulled, bushes trimmed...hopefully hands off for a few weeks.
---
Oh and all the random handy man tasks around the house are getting done.
---
Good 'ole screenshot totem
---
Very well done! Now to edit the Ironforge one into a desktop.
---
I plan on doing this with my undead priest
---
This is so... 100% true :(
---
That's literally impossible
---
Even guilds that are paying people to raid only expect to get the kill after 14
---
Eating garbage is bad for you, it does a lot to you when you eat it every day over extended periods.  Most of these people don’t workout, this food is going to sit in their bodies and be stored as fat.  You would be surprised how much weight you can gain from a completely sedentary lifestyle shoving hot pockets and sugar down your throat.
---
Retail (current) Wow is much more streamlined with less grinding, much more quality of life changes and quicker rewards and easier for casual players to experience all content. 
---
Classic is very much still a great MMO with more emphasis on social interactions and more grind and more complex character abilities and talents.
---
Content wise there really isn't too much difference. In retail pretty much all of the relevant game takes place in the current expansion. All raids and dungeons of previous expansions will only be used as a filler while leveling. So content wise both games will feel about the same and since in retail the leveling speed is much quicker, the leveling from 1-60 in classic will probably feel about the same as leveling from 1-120 in retail.
---
I'd say it's very much worth it although it depends what someone prefers. The quality of life changes in the retail version aren't all bad.
---
If you were my son/daughter, id disavow you on the spot for that.
---
This is true, from another thread this morning I advised someone to "take 5 points in wand spec and 5 in spirit tap. Then go down the holy or shadow trees, taking the damage talents. At 40 respec to shadow for shadowform and put the next 5 back into wand spec, finishing with disc talents until 60". So thats my full response here, too.
---
It's based off of the assumption that every player that joined in Cata+, or every longtime player that has grown out of the Vanilla playstyle won't like it. Look at Preach, or Jesse Cox. Those guys were pretty dead set on not playing Vanilla. Come closed beta and they loved it; they fell in love with the game all over again. Classic is not for everyone, but to expect a 70-80% dropoff is just ridiculous.
---
This is an important question
---
The boomkin in the background is my favorite
---
Heck, in classic everybody is starting fresh and brand new!
---
Seems Stalagg may rival it some. Given the recent census.
---
Yep. I have friends who won't move because they want to lose their names.
---
I told them to change now or forever hold your peace. Once we roll, we're staying, even if the queues are 3 hours after a month. I'm not rerolling.
---
I can tank for you... For money.

Depends on the class and what's currently available. The raids/dungeons are coming out in phases that will mimic vanilla wow, although some bugfixes from later patches are included day one for sanity.
---
Pre-Raid bis lists are theorycrafted sets that optimize your DPS. However, some of them include completely unreasonable items that most sane individuals will never manage to farm.
---
The thing with the 0.5 tier in phase one, it's just plain bad. They updated the sets, allowing you to upgrade them, to be better in Phase 5, but likely you'll be significant outgearing them at that point if you've been playing since the start even as a casual.
---

---
This list is really nice, but looking at mage's pre-bis freezing band. It drops from elites lvl 45-55ish with the optimal drop chance being a whopping 0.0013% chance. An average of 77,000 mob kills per freezing band drop.
---
Just use them as a guide line, and check how reasonable each item is to get. If it's stupid, just look for the bargain bin version of the item with similar effects.
---
Using /sit will proc ￼ Enrage &amp; ￼ Blood Craze. You need to /sit, stand, and get hit in the same batch
---
Some people are saying this doesn't work in classic. Thoughts?
---
According to wowhead's classic gear planner, it will come out on phase 5
---
My thoughts exactly. To be completely honest I even enjoyed increased xp rates on vanilla pservers because that meant you could choose which part of the leveling experience you actually want to replay.
---
Well if you don't care about min-maxing and you prefer the look of humans in gear and their animations, you've pretty much answered your own question.
---
Play Human Rogue.
---
Yeh. The questchain for completing it is pretty costly and grindy :D I like to think it's still worth it. Looks so cool too!
---
They dont just give you gold for being away and coming back?
---
Because that's about the only way I'd have enough probably haha. I havent played in ages.
---
If blizzard were an old timey doctor they would 100% cut off your foot if you cut your toe rather than risk the chance your entire leg got infected and needed to be amputated.  No sense letting the cut heal first and see what happens, off with the foot!
---
Dunno why they decided to change the graphics from this beauty
---
Okay. But then why the random Sylvanas tho
---
Level as skinning/herb, vendor all the leather and low level herbs, keep the swiftthistle and fadeleaf for yourself. At higher levels start keeping herbs to auction once the economy is established. At 60 drop skinning and get Engi and buy the mats you need to level it. Farming herbs needed for raid consumables to pay for it.
---
Thistle Tea is made with Cooking, Blinding Powder is made with Poisons. You don't need Alchemy unless you want to make pots for yourself, but that means less silver in your pocket.
---
If not you might be able to either play it off of library/mcdonalds/public WiFi if you have a laptop. If no laptop there could be a local college near you with either public or rentable computers in the library and you can play it off of a large flash drive or any external drive. Or a library playing it off of an external hdd. Or you can ask them if you can set up. Or one of those gaming cafes. Where there’s a will there’s a way! At least it’s only temporary either way.
---
I laughed so fuckin hard hahahahahahahahahah
---
Paladin tanks arent at all. Sometimes you can have a Paladin do some AoE pulls, but Holy Shield is completely unnecessary for that.
---
Druids are kind of on the edge of viability. Theres a lot of denialists, retail players and idealists that spread a lot of rhetoric about them however, that theyre the "best" threat tanks and the best for 5mans. For 5mans, theyre a lot easier to play than Warrior, so some people think that makes them "better", even though a capable Warrior can get the job done much better if theyre actually decent. For raid threat, it was discovered on pservers that if you spam Manual Crowd Pummlers on use function, Druids can actually have really high threat (and viable DPS), but it requires you to farm literally several bags full of them PER RAID. However, people still use this as justification that Druids are viable.
---
Additionally, there seems to be a retail effect that makes the masses think everything is viable and theres a big group of revisionists that keep spouting rhetoric about how ret palas, enh shaman, moonkins effectively ran around aplenty in raids, which having played during that time, just wasnt true.
---
honestly I was just trying to make her appealing, that's how she turned out, I'd even argue that she looks like a human female more than a blood elf, with these..
---
But what sort of heartless madman would do something callous, yet hilarious
---
Hehe hehehe hehehehe
---
thought release was the 27th? (25th here in U.K atm)
---
Gnome!
---
I play a Druid.  So, hunters.
---
Hunters scare me...literally.  I’m the only class they can fear.
---
I can’t kite hunters.
---
Hunter pets pushback my healing spells.
---
Meanwhile, rogues are no problem at all unless they outlevel me.  Faerie Fire is the ultimate “fuck you” ability for rogues.  I can cure the poison.  And in bear form the rogue’s butterknife pokes tickle.  I can also kite and heal if the rogue is particularly good.
---
"Me not that kind of orc!"
---
That's an awful lot of almond milk....
---
Yes, you can use the twitch client to easily manipulate and install them. Otherwise it has to be inside the _classic/interface/addons folder. To make sure they work- willitclassic.com
---
Won't work anymore anyways it was a bug
---
We're used to jump off cliffs and try to charge something before splattering. 50% of the time it worked every time
---
I got flying training on all my characters in BC only because of netherweave bags. 
---
They didnt even sell for that much, but they were super easy to make and always sold.
---
Yeah, tomorrow is gonna be rough. I've run out of videos to watch and now I'm just posting on posts like this.
---
I guess it also depends on how fast you get in the game and wont just be stuck in queue :P
---
Not that I've seen.
---
on to kronos!
---
I cant remember if in this stage of classic if warriors were still able to just pop shield wall and survive that way. I know they nerfed it at some point just cant remember when
---
It will be a mess. A funny one but a mess.
---
Why would I post it on a board I don't care about?
---
New, but only because my wife is going hunter.
---
I just downloaded and scanned with virustotal, came up clean. thanks man
---
Bro, chill, it's a joke.
---
No, you don't "want Shatter on leveling no matter what."
---
If you take Shatter, you completely fuck with your ability to aoe grind.  Individual mobs in your aoe pack will get rooted by shatter and separate from the pack.
---
If you don't care about aoe grinding, then sure, take shatter if you want.
---
I always upvote girl! Girls who play games, hmmmm. What's her patreon?
---
Am I the only person who doesn’t like posts like this?
---
I work with data for my job and I know statistically people will die before launch but it makes me so uncomfortable to see this and think about mortality.
---
It would be ok if the posts were only once in awhile but one day last week there were like 3-4 posts in the New feed saying “Remember you could die before launch” or some rendition of that.
---
Set keybinds to your ultra epic gaming mouse
---
So I'm going to be playing as a mage for the first time and was wondering which talents I should be choosing for levelling?
---
Easiest is waiting for AV to be added then getting exalted with Frostwolf Clan and buying the wolf.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/TGzdn6q
---
I'm also ready. this is one drawer. btw, the voo dew is really good. tastes like tropical skittles.
---
I use shift 1-3 to change actionbars for other shit like mounts and toys stuff like that.
---
Happy Classic Eve all - see you in game :)
---
Imagine not sheeping after the tank pulls.  
---
Imagine not using shouts to pull aggro on packs instead of attacking each mob one at a time.
---
Well by adding 4 new PvP servers Blizzard is prepared. People are just stubborn/lazy/scared to migrate. The option is there my friend, if people don't use it well... that's a different story isn't it ?
---
15 Anniversary pack is the closest i think.
---
I spend more on coffee daily than it cost me to register my name early.
---
i took vacation for tomorrow and tuesday.  I did nothing last friday, except work on a spreadsheet to calculate mana/heal efficiency on my healing spells.
---
Most of the prof gear as you level isnt great and often isnt worth it. at 60, you can farm Devilsaur gear which is really good, but thats assuming a mafia hasnt formed around it (which has been a real thing on pservers).
---
Otherwise, skinning is not great, but not bad either for money.
---
Same here brother. Having less time to play means less of a chance of getting burned out though
---
Human.
---
There is a higher chance to quit playing if you don't like your character appearance.
---
I'll go full lightforge with my ret paladin, I don't even care
---
brilliance
---
Do quest as early as you can or you will miss out of rep.
---
I'm the opposite, modern gaming bores me. Instant success just doesn't feel as good as that high effort grind to reach a goal.
---
Not for 6 months atleast. If anything there will be even bigger growth
---
The new servers are coming up 19:00 CET, right?
---
This, people be wilding and probably didn't even play the stress test. Layers we're designed to handle the load, that's why they exist! I understand there's going to be more people for actual launch but I'm giving Blizz the benefit of the doubt on this one since they took so much time to test with the help of the community.
---
A good thing and a bad.  But mostly good I think.  :)
---
Pretty much. People do objectively inefficient things all the time because of psychology. It *feels* like buying low level bags is a waste of money, since you have very little of it early on, and you might get lucky and get all the bags as drops. From a strictly factual standpoint, it's probably better in general to just buy the bags and sell them.
---
I'll probably do that this time, so I'm not screwing myself due to stubbornness.
---
As far as quality of life there isn't much difference between around 100million and another 58.
---
they released a collectors edition but it literally only has a giant rag statue with some merch in it (and no game..)
---
I want to do this but my group wants to move. At this point theres a 40% chance I’m just gonna cut and run back to Herod. 
---
I don’t care about queues I care about being on the most active and competitive server. That is Herod a thousand times over.
---
That's a good point.  Maybe I'll just be an altaholic.
---
You make it sound a little too easy. You still need to skip unimportant spells and do a little gold oriented grinding in the 30’s to get that 90g
---
I intend to get as much done as possible tomorrow since this week will mostly be a throw away. 
---
I have work tomorrow, Wednesday and Thursday.
---
Rest of the time I will be playing classic WoW
---
11pm on the 26th in the UK
---
have
---
lol its much easier for tanks
---
its THE easiest
---
End of an era
---
https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
Why didn't I think of that lol
---
&gt;The starting areas are going to be just awful. 
---
You're being an optimist. You hink you will get in at all. (if not due to queues, overloaded layers will be crashing)
---
Oh, great. Guess I'll die.
---
Eh. Shadow if you play right and fill your bags with mama pots and runes. You be fine. Kinda. I guess.
---
You know what just make sure your wand skill is 300 just incase. Esp early.
---
Oh my bad, got Quel'Thalas and Quel'Danas confused.  You're correct, I had to go back and watch a video to confirm.
---
Really weird how I managed to get a day off to be able to play despite having a job!
---
Oh, wait... I forgot that I am an adult and that I can manage my own time properly!
---
What is this post even supposed to do? It's not even that important to be able to play right away and your "Friends" are not losing anything either if they start a few days later.
---
I feel you, I got nearly kicked out of a BFD dungeon group, because I was sheeping the entire group of twiliught cultists in on the pathway through the water, healing up one by one until we nearly wiped.
---
Respeccing every week, only being able to afford my epic mount at the very end of vanilla, even though I started pretty much at launch.
---
Not understanding that I could've rolled tauren on another server than my brother going alliance. I settled begrudgingly for gnome. When I played a pserver I never looked back at alliance.
---
11-year old me was an ultimate uber scrub. I was good in the HALO campaign, but shooting stuff is easier than understanding an MMORPG.
---
I hear it in my head like the Ironforge Dwarves
---
2. Yes
---
Doing it as you level means you'll have cool potions. These won't speed you up enough to offset r time spent leveling  profession.
---
3. If ur not racing to 60, chill a bit. Level professions, do dungeons etc.
---
Does mage Clearcasting proc off every Arcane Missiles/Blizzard tick or just the initial cast? Do they really just spam Frostbolt in raids?
---
Blizzard already said Herod will have a several hour queue at the very least.
---
If some people haven't subscribed yet, I expect even more. And some of those people giving up and going to other servers filling them up.
---
kurwa
---
is she a gnome? xD
---
Dude, just hire some Chinese peasant. You can get a much better $/hr rate this way. 
---
Yeah every single PvP server on EU is full right now. Every time I click on one, it warns me about the queues and suggests I pick a different one, but I literally can't **because they're ALL full!**
---
Yea, the big reasons as to why me and my friends are going RP is as follows;
---
-Medium pop means little to no queues
---
-Stable pop for months to come
---
-No idiotic names like  orcslayerr or what ever
---
It is against the rules to talk anything but English on English servers. Of course you can moonspeak in guild/whispers but if you are in a public forum you are meant to speak english.(You can literally be reported and suspended if you don't speak english)
---
And it looks like english will be majority on every single server.
---
One tells you what to do and where to go, basically handholding, questie marks the quest mobs and shows up available quests on the map and minimap.
---
There’s only one RP-PvP server...so there we go.  I dropped a name on Herod though.  In case Grob dies I’ll, at the very least, have the name I want on an active server.
---
it's bloodmail boots and savage gladiator chain

Min maxing, Night Elf's are better for PVE.
---
Same. Due to my work schedule raiding is probably pointless. With 40 people to pass loot too, there's no way I'm going to be able to get regular tier sets unless I run my own PuGs.
---
I'm a hunter!
---
Very rich coming from a horde player
---
Still 1 day and 2 hours left before release of the guide
---
:')
---
good guy draenei mage sometimes playing a war vsing a mage can make you just want to give up too ;-;
---
Best of luck! World record of fastest 1-60 in vanilla is 116 hours of gameplay. I would recommend just enjoying yourself instead of rushing yourself :)
---
&gt; Stack more spirit and you more regen.
---
Any tank that stacks spirit is getting kicked from the raid.  I don't care how casual the guild is that's just absurd.
---
Any good for world pvp?
---
Skeram still has space!
---
Anyone rolling on Westfall?  Looking for a horde leveling pal (bonus if you want to DE all my tailoring muck)
---
Once I lost my puppy as a kid, I used her name on my hunters pet. Maybe you could do the same.
---
Good for you? I have tanked over half the instances as a hunter. Doesn’t mean I would count on half of the hunters on a server to be able to do that.
---
With all the Titanforging/socket/stat thing going on, I don't think Retail is less grindy then Classic (if you want to have every BiS at the highest possible stat for your class).
---
You’ll see plenty of that nonsense. There will be one or two people that will run strat over and over with orbs (or first 2) reserves. No one but fresh 60’s want to run start live so they can fill up their groups with 3 mouthbreathers and keep the gold for themselves.
---
I signed up for Herod yesterday. I want as close to the authentic vanilla experience as possible!
---
Unfortunately it’s not quite that simple. Lack of an effective snap aggro means that a cc target that breaks early and goes uncheck will run straight for the healer potentially unchecked.
---
There are other examples of why taunt is such a useful tool. And it’s a tool that paladins should’ve had from the get go.
---
I'm going shaman first and warrior second, with warrior most likely being overall main in the long run. I'm leveling with friends and to me it makes sense to have different armour classes and stats at the very start, and we will level the 2nd chars together too. We should be fine xd
---
Atlas World Map. But I think it also changes the map from the drawing style, to more of the photo looking style. Not sure if you can turn that feature on and off though.
---
yeah its a fun racial to hide yourself and your pet.
---
Moonglade aka The Valley of Death.
---
Endless theory crafting, private server experience, and the removal of past biases open up the possibility of it being a thing.
---
Not **all** the loot, just the hunter loot. 
---
Oh... Right... That means all the loot.
---
First award, enjoy the plat, that was the best.
---
“Coolbox”
---
Wise guild members
---
No, because they did that 15 years ago.
---
They have a history of underestimating classic's popularity. If they say queues will be bad, they will probably be even worse.
---
How do you recharge a ball mouse?
---
This is terrible. We didn't have this addon in vanilla and it ruins my experience. We must get Blizzard to break this addon for me.
---
Afraid?  
---
I embrace it with open arms!
---
Yikes dude
---
Beautiful.
---
elite membership will get it today, tomorrow they gonna release basic version
---
Maybe he is playing solo...?
---
Exactly.
---
More so because we have the luxury of not getting anyone who could possibly roll on our gear in the group.
---
&gt; pretend you woke up in another world actually your character
---
take care as i'm pretty sure this is how wow players ended up on the news  during vanilla.
---
1. Keep a DPS set and a healing set. If you need to get a dungeon group quick or group for a random elite quest, itll always be helpful to swap to healing when you can.
---
2. Debatable, itll be a little faster in time spent waiting until 60, but youd also have to deal with just a massive pile of herbs as you level, or wait until 60 to run around on your mount throughout zones picking up herbs (which will take several, very boring hours). Doing it while leveling is much more enjoyable, as you can pick herbs while leveling without much sidetracking and level Alch when you happen to be in a main city. It adds a little more variance to leveling.
---
3. Dont be a bad.
---
You must be hang
---
I mean we dorfs have bigger shnoses soooo.... :\^)
---
OOAHHHH
---
Cool thanks guys! Dumb question does he have to land the killing blow to activate spirit tap?
---
I also disagree about listening for short durations. In most situations you would like to undercut your competition by a copper. setting their play patterns through things like undermine journal and added them to your friends list, you can identify at which times players login for the game and re-list their auctions. as such ideally you would like to relist and undercut them after they have logged on to repost. The problem with that is that my appraising this strategy your tied to The auction house to constantly undercut them. Alternatively I always suggest, that putting your auctions after you undercut at a long duration more likely than that leads to times in which your product is on the market when their option expires. Especially if they are going to bed for the night. I always suggest using the 12-hour option. I found that for hire priced more exotic items, most myself came when my product was the only one on the AH. typically around the times of 5 to 7:00 a.m. I made my fortune in retail primarily through transmog, so as such Mike experience I guess is more directed to items that are not fast moving but high-yielding. which I am sure makes a difference.
---
So.  Much.  Potential.  
---
Alternate timeline progression.  The Cataclysm except instead of a big lame dragon fucking up the map, Arthas goes on the offensive and just starts taking Kalimdor and the EK from the north down.  Dark, dreary, hopeless themes as we actually lose a fight against a bid bad for the first time ever.  Horde and Alliance both get pushed south, and south, and south, until we're reduced to a single zone on each continent...  And then players have to actively fight to take back and hold the zones against the scourge in a server-wide progression effort.  
---
Firefall had a system like this, where if the players were complacent then they'd be reduced to a small number of zones as the Chosen invaded and caused death storms or whatever that would damage players who entered them.  Some capitol cities would become completely inaccessible.  You'd have to venture into enemy territory to take facilities that would push back the alien forces and their storm, and then you'd have to defend those areas while other players would push further.  This is my Warcraft dream.  
---
And that's just one wacky idea.  I'm all for BC and wotlk servers, but Classic+ could give WoW a whole new lease on life if Blizzard decides to run with it.
---
Raising a crafting profession is expensive. You will be able to make your own gear for leveling, but the majority of what you want at 60 are things that drop from dungeons.
---
Most of what a leatherworker makes is boe and can be bought/traded. 
---
It is up to you. I played one as a druid and it was convenient but expensive to level.
---
Only 15+ min.
---
Not the RP ones, and probably not the ones coming tomorrow.
---
I think by far the majority are NOT subbed to retail.
---
that was my initial thought, tho at what level do I change the boar for something better?
---
YES!
---
Better come to terms with your death sooner rather than later. Everyone wants to live a full life, but not everyone does and you might not either. It will will make your death easier and your life more fufilling not being afraid of dying and living like any moment could be your last.
---
people arent always fully optimised lol, especially back then
---
Think the way Geralt does:
---
&gt; If I’m to choose between one evil and another, I’d rather not choose at all.
---
But seriously, don't try to quantify love and loss, it's too painful of a thought experiment.
---
Yeah I'm not even a big RP guy at all, but my guild decided to roll Grobb because the player base tends to be mature and chill. Not to mention dedicated and stable, we are a small server but we have the second biggest sub and discord, that means a heavily engaged population
---
I think gathering is5 and crafting 10
---
Do you have numbers on the 90% figure? 
---
Vanilla WoW devs created a spreadsheet of new gear stats out to level 100 that would have kept power creep at a reasonable level. This was possible due to Vanilla’s linear itemization. In TBC they threw this out of the window to introduce exponential itemization, and it’s the reason TBC quickly invalidated end game gear. If Vanilla’s itemization was kept for + content, you wouldn’t really see too bad of a power creep. 
---
That being said, + content doesn’t have to be harder or more rewarding than naxx. They could add horizontal progression that gives rewards designed for meme specs to make them competitive. Additionally, achievers will pursue gear with one or two additional stats on it. They could make a more difficult new raid with just barely better gear, or gear better for a single slot, or with gear that does interesting things, or that gives new spells, or has a new legendary. Finally, they could make more leveling dungeons and quests and open new zones that aren’t necessarily max level.
---
Soon yea ^^
---
&gt; It's elitist to call a guild filled with people who care about no one but themselves a bad guild?
---
Answering with a question in order to dodge everything is not helping you. Yes, your stance is elitist and I have highlighted it very well in many arguments that you dodged.
---
&gt;Well, first of all I never said anything remotely close to that
---
You literally said it:
---
&gt;&gt;If your healadin likes to play something else in PvP, this could be beneficial for your guild to give it to him
---
&gt;It's never beneficial to have a paladin play something other than holy
---
You said it's never beneficial to have a paladin play something other than holy. I can't make this up. You wrote it, and you wrote it after I specifically said than they were playing it in PvP. You are now backtracking because you cannot defend that stance.
---
&gt;how does impacting the rate at which your guild acquires gear from pvp not affect your pve progress?
---
See, I'll address your point, where you're not addressing mine. I actually already addressed this and gave answers to that. They're all in the comment above yours. 
---
&gt;Look, if he wants to run around and lolret in his spare time, he should be my guest, but taking weapons from someone who will actually use them to benefit the guild is textbook selfish behavior.
---
I demonstrated how this is wrong and stupid. Feel free to ignore arguments debunking your stance.
---
&gt;No, they're not, they bring nothing to the table, no buffs, no damage, no mitigation.
---
That's ignorant. Prots bring tanking/off tanking, ret brings damage. As I already said, bringing less damage than other specs is not bringing no damage.
---
&gt;If only you had 10+ warriors to pick from
---
Which is not always the case.
---
&gt;Did you ever consider that if someone is unwilling to make the tinest sacrifice for the guild and only think about themselves, they might not be someone you want to stick around?
---
Did you eve consider that taking into consideration individual needs is actually part of taking into consideration the common needs? This is management 101. All you're blabbering is terrible management methods, while ignoring proven ones.
---
I'm going to stop here. I am given ample arguments that you ignored. Whether you understand it or not (and your complete lack of logic and rationality so far strongly indicates that you have no ability to understand it), arguments are what makes a conversation, not stubborness and camping a stance that was proven wrong a long time ago.
---
Ignoring the rest, as I warned you earlier, I wouldn't engage furhter if you kept ignoring arguments debunking your stance.
---
Same &lt;3
---
I don't think there are any right now. Make your character correctly the first time!
---
Mained warlock in vanilla/tbc, druid in wrath, rogue in cata and warrior in wod. This time I'll be maining a Paladin due to their versatility. I'll be making a warlock alt once I get to level 40 tho
---
Midnight CET I think
---
Cat's for pvp, it helps interrupt casters.
---
Because they need to hide from the Horde!!!!
---
&gt; quickly
---
Depends.
---
Thank you i become elite yesterday but i still have to wait for the wow classic launch anyway :/
---
Kids it's the internet. You can say dumbass. If you are willing enough to type it with asterisks then you can type the full thing.

Nice. Thanks!

Don't die in your sleep guys, whatever you do, don't die from a blood clot either or a stray bullet if you live in the states. You can make it.
---
See there someone goes again. Use your brain my dude. What makes you think the current server populations are ONLY people hardcore enough to sub early? Did you actually forget that retail has an estimated subscriber count of 5 million currently LMFAO. Almost every single retail player I know reserved a name for classic even if they weren't going to play it just incase.
---
You seriously think the amount who haven't subbed yet is far more than than around ~4 million considering probably not every retail player reserved a name? Yikers.
---
I love it.
---
Yeah I had this happen even during classic/TBC. You won't believe how many people wanted a rezz even though druid had none (except battle rez). I think it was added in WotLK that all healers were able to rezz no matter which class.
---
Yeah that's true well I understand it ^^ and accept it I just wanted to hear some different thoughts ! :3
---
I think your thinking of a lid. Just pop a decent sized hole in it
---
That link someone posted about the player count: https://i.imgur.com/parrLyh.png. The player count went down from 70K to 20K in 5 months.
---
This is a good reminder to some people on this sub to not be overconfident in Classic maintaining a massive player base. It's also a reminder that how Phase 2- 6 and beyond goes will have a large impact in how Classic does a year or so from now.
---
Giveth and taketh, shamans *are* the spiritual leaders of the horde after all
---
Holy crap, could hunters shoot while running in retail? 
---
Hunters in vanilla can fire instant attacks, like Arcane shot and stings, but they must remain stationary for normal shots and anything with a cast time such as Aimed shot.
---
No ranged class can attack while running, except by casting instant abilities.

You get enough bank holidays! (About 3 more than us, esp. Jan 2nd!)
---
This is amazing... love it.
---
have you tried???
---
Frostbolt at the beginning/middle then you switch to fire and spam fireball for rolling ignites
---
Your raiding DPS rotatioin is simpler than a Rogue or Warrior but otherwise there's plenty of skill ceiling when it comes to hunters.
---
I love you OP
---
Same, would much rather have the 5% int buff gnomes get but the looks just ain't worth it.
---
Apparently this guy just can't take a hint..

---
1) Level as damage and just use gear to heal any dungeons you do while leveling.
---
2) Herb/alch is considered the standard moneymaker from professions. If you want to keep it relevant to the zones you're in, you will need to do a bit extra work in zones before you leave. It's faster to level at 60 due to mount, but you miss out on gold as you level if you give it up. Entirely up to you, neither is bad.
---
3) Pace yourself, sleep well. It's a marathon not a race.
---
Yeah I understand ^^  
---
Thanks  for the comment !
---
Plenty of the people rushing have already been playing pservers for years and just want a stable, non corrupt server for end game. Take those with a grain of salt though, there are likely hundreds of thousands playing, the speed runners *will* be the minority.
---
No but others have confirmed it doesn’t work.
---
Bahahaha I cant wait to ruin the alliance children
---
&gt; then when it becomes harder to find healers for rend runs switch to full UBRS.
---
switching to full UBRS AFTER being done with Rend runs SUCKS on so many levels though...
---
I'm still secretly hoping I'll drop an Ironfoe while going for HoJ so I don't have to go for Dal'Rends :D
---
I’ve enjoyed Ricket. She mostly streams late late at night and early morning. I watch her anywhere from 6am-8am EST. Usually has 200~ viewers, laid back stream and music. She plays hunter and Druid so will probably be leveling those.  
---
And if you play retail she does mythic+ carries for viewers.
---
That thing is an arsonist of hopes and dreams in merely the skin of a man.
---
??? Concussive shot and they won't get away. Hunter is still the most mobile ranged class. There is only a .5 sec cast time on their auto shot during which you shouldn't move. Get an auto-shot timer add-on.
---
Yeah OG Hunters were not auto shooting while walking and needed minimum range and a much more meticulous play style.  Chasing someone meant you cast concussion shot and chase with cheetah.  Required about 150x more skill than retail hunters.  
---
You might want to go back to BFA.
---
There are some you can and should skip, at least early when you are low on silver/gold and may want to spend some of that on new weapons etc.
---
Some spells I usually skip and buy when I reach 60 are concentration aura, holy wrath, blessing of sacrifice, righteous fury, Seal of Justice.
---
Then there are some spells which you don't need to buy all ranks of, you buy rank1 or a few early ranks and then when you don't need it anymore you stop buying it (Devo aura for example, since you should swap to ret aura at level 26, you also don't need any improved ranks of ressurection until 60, or Turn Undead, resist auras are also something you can buy rank1 of or skip entierly, depending on your economy situation)
---
You don't stand in town, you run around and quest with a "/yell selling 6slot bags for just 4s" macro you then meet prior between quests or have them come to your turn in point
---
This reminds me of when we were doing AQ20 and someone accidentally pulled Ayamiss, and the hunter had to tank with nature resistance gear for the first part of it, and I was the designated tank. 
---
So I popped a nature resist potion, feigned death, hit my equip nature resist button, and ran over and distracting shot. 
---
I remember feeling so pro.
---
How much spell dmg is required for it to outscale traditional builds?
---
Literally nothing to do with his problem. I have a PC desktop and a MBP and while I'll mainly be playing on the desktop, the Mac runs it just fine as well.
---
I need this for my wallpaper. This is a fucking piece of art mate!
---
Not entirely true. She was already free from Arthas, but hid that fact. After she and the dreadlords concocted their plot to kill Arthas, she retrieved her body. 
---
What you see in WCIII isn't necessarily correct. Some details have been retconned by Arthas: Rise of the Lich King.
---
Warriors can charge out of fall damage.  The check for a valid path wasn't added until wrath.
---
It's kinda hilarious that you can save yourself by stomping really hard on a critter.
---
Is there an addon like the old Everyquest that anyone knows for classic?
---
Everyquest would query you're character's true/false against every quest id in the game to tell you what was incompleted.
---
In what world is that toxic LOL
---
You must not play other multi-player games a lot

I believe you are right, can't bid/buyout your own auction.
---
Am I remembering correctly that every swap spec had to be done at the class trainer and costed increasing gold?
---
As you plan to level together, I would highly advise to not avoid same professions, so you should not both pick skinning. One of you can skin everything, so you won't miss any resources.
---
Instead, I would advice on picking either herbalism or mining for your friend. Problem is that neither combo with enchanting and would be purely for gold making. 
---
I myself found enchanting quite underwhelming and even frustrating while leveling, so I would suggest picking herbing and alchemy instead for your partner.  
---
This way you would have 2 out of 3 gathering professions, you could provide bags and the occasional piece of gear and he can provide both of you with potions.
---
Let those people rush, they will miss so much, and they will not get a true Vanilla/Classic experience.
---
Tailors have to sell their bags for less than vendor prices. They will sell easily.

Melt that face!

Where’s your beer???  I’ll give you a nice beer spec for leveling.
---
12x mich ultra.  A nice beer to sober up with, easy drinking. May sub for miller lite.
---
6x IPAs &gt;6.5abv.  I’d recommend two hearted ale, voodoo ranger, or something similar.
---
6x Stella Artois or Heineken - refreshing hoppy smell and easy drinking. Good ipa/stout spacer.
---
4x Guinness draught - silky smooth darkness
---
12x Coronas or Dos Equis, or negro modelo. +2 limes
---
4x local sour ale or stout... taste dependent. for when you’re feeling spunky
---
12x Sierra Nevada pale ale.
---
You’re welcome.  Try to maintain 0.06-0.09 BAC for optimal leveling experience.

It's just someone's theory, though. With the server layering, maybe it won't be so tough. I expect a lot of people will be going with skinning and mining to earn gold, and others will be rushing to 60 as quickly as possible. Go with your heart and give it a shot anyway. I ethink I will too. It I didn't want to make bags for me and my friends, I'd probably go full Alchemy/Herbalism like you are. Was never big on Alchemy in the past, but this is my first shot as a Mage and it's tempting to have those defense and healing potions to try to round out my glaring weaknesses. Seems the closer we get to launch, the more conflicted I'm becoming about literally everything.
---
The first 15 levels are different because, just like you, someone might want to do another races starter zone. Horde 1-22 is absolutely loaded with quests and you have to actively avoid doing bad ones in order not to outlevel good ones.
---
Tauren start from a very awkward location and have to run across barrens much earlier than the other races, but the zone is quite xp dense. Slipping right into silverpine after arriving to EK is nice since you don't have to deal with population issues in two starter zones, and you have a hearthstone shortcut back to crossroads while everyone else has to run!
---
I had been going back and forth for months between druid and rogue. I did settle on druid but my plan is to level both here and there until i just naturally settle on one.
---
Mansplaining.. yikes

as a mage, you literally have a talent to increase wand damage by 20% or something

1 sleep if you are casual 2 sleeps if you want to go big on release

Uhh those are WoD models
---
They don't suck. But they are not fast levelers (mainly because they don't kill mobs quickly, their sustain and survivability is really good) and their only competitive raid role is healing.
---
isn’t this what Asmongold said in his recent video..?
---
*Khermit arm flailing*
---
I’m constantly rotating between my warlock Malaria, my rogue Xenomorph, and my Troll warrior Jurassic. I love locks, but I’ve had that experience. I enjoyed my rogue test on LH, and warrior is the ultimate challenge.
---
I mained a Human pally in vanilla/bc/wraith, and a worgen warlock from cata to retail (I capped every class on legion retail). I capped a undead warlock on Nost, and I got a warrior to 50 on Light’s Hope (alongside every Class to at least 30).

Which skills and abilities requires a reagent of some sort? And about how expensive/available is it? I know mage teleportation and portal requires reagents that are about 20 and 40 silver(?). And druid have some for battle res i think. Any other skills and abilities out there? Among all classes.

Just remember that in order to teach you pet new ranks of bite/claw/etc, you'll need to stable them and go train a new pet to learn them.

If you're not familiar with the process, it's with googling around for hunter pet guides for classic

Paladins don't suck, they're just weak leveling and their endgame healing rotation is a single button. Those are not crippling blows to the class itself. However the off specs (tank/dps) are weak, but every vanilla class has at least one viable spec. Long as you play within it you'll be fine.
---
Paladins are pretty restrictive in what they do since they lack a good dps spec, mages are more versatile and better gold farmers. But that's pretty standard for healing classes to be limited in activity for older MMOs.
---
Honestly boils down to if you want to heal or dps imo.
---
If you’re shooting for world first you may need to respec a few times for optimization.  But generally I would save my cheap respec for 60.  I have a leveling spec and an endgame spec.
---
Sometimes you gotta flex, part of the food chain.
---
Yea, but how am I going to sit in queues all day on low pop servers?
---
Definitely. Different strokes for different folks, I suppose. Most of the full servers shouldn't be dead anytime soon but they might not be the top tier or anything. Some people don't mind that, though.
---
5 and 35 is the level you need for max professions.
---
It doesn't need to be addressed, the dreadsteed quest was added in 1.4, Dire Maul 1.3. Doesn't take much to put 2 and 2 together to realize it won't become available until Dire Maul.
---
Please rain!! I love rain!! I'll mentally control the weather for you.

I played quite a bit of private and I know I speak for a lot of private players when I say I'm really looking forward to not gambling on my characters persistence through server issues and shutdowns. Our characters will actually be permanent and Blizz supported! So stoked!
---
10 hour Qs?  I think that’s a bit excessive.  Maybe a 3-4 hour Q at the longest.
---
People will not wait in 10 hour Qs and will go to a new server.

Who cares, the artist clearly wanted to include her. It’s a cool pic

Scarlet Crusade is protecting people, just in a different way than the argent crusade, after all if they kill you with fire, you can't be raised in the Lich Kings services.

I remember the jumping doing jackshit on retail, helped a lot in pservers to the point it did 0 damage on some.
---
From what I remember, as long you had full health and took the correct route youd be fine though.
---
It really is classic WoW
---
Omg is that Maddox?
---
You don't really fail on a raid, you typically reach a boss where your raid's gear and/or experience isn't enough. Then you can try it again and again until you beat it or the raid resets.
---
Oh wow, you can easily trade that for trade, general chat or LFG.
---
The 90% was just going by the years of experience that playing on private servers has taught me, you have thousands of players playing, then quitting when BWL has been released and then wait for a new fresh server. Then the circle continues. 
---
The problem is if I'm a rogue, warrior, mage or any of the popular non-hybrid classes why would i waste time getting some meme spec gear? People wont raid if theres nothing in it for them.
---
The problem with better gear is that you already 1 or 2 shot people with Naxx gear. Naxx gear was bis until karazan in some slots. So you would have to squish gear in order to fit in more of it, just like TBC that would create a weird dynamic where you progress backwards.
---
I’m in the same boat as you man, been flip-floping between hunter and mage for the past week myself.

---
I'll always stop what I'm doing and heal you up if you're not full when I pass by you, and help  you kill mobs if you're overwhelmed.If I see a corpse I'll try to rezz.
---
As you mentioned the choice is to stick with the slow mount for awhile and wait it out or buy an additional epic mount.
---
A lot of people (all classes) stayed on their slow mount for a long time before they upgraded it.
---
Keep in mind it might be nice to have a swift mount that does not have mana cost. Not that it will really be a problem 99.5% of the time.
---
On my orc I plan to get the swift epic wolf at 60. Then later get dreadsteed. Theres more reason to have both a wolf and a horse available.
---
4 set hero or darkmantle?
---
It's digital so you'd have to steal the entire assembly.
---
Good idea, very time consuming and expensive however. Here is my take on it. Instead of grinding Strat Life (hated that place) for Truefaith pattern I will instead be running Strat Undead to get Robes of the Exalted. Mount would be a happy surprise, but mostly grinding Argent Dawn rep. There just isn't enough time in my life for BWL, but I could possibly do Molten Core later on. If I can't do any of that I'll just wait until ZG is released and try get Flowing Ritual Robes which is on par with Truefaith. Long story short, fuck that noise I'm crossing my fingers for RNG.
---
I'm curious what your statistical backing is for this. Because I figure only a few thousand people will read this post, practically all of which are within an age group with relatively low mortality rates. So how do you figure that out of a few thousand people one is likely to die in a day?

1 time use?

Says the rogue. Obviously

If you like being invited to everything constantly, healer. If you like independence and open world stuff, mage.

i wish they would make classic its own game on twitch its so fucking confusing

classic has nothing to do with retail and its a real pain to install anything

Just play shaman man or you’ll regret it.
---
Your leveling experience won't be as fun for you if you're used to mages.  
---
You watch your weapon swing and that's basically it, you have some neat cooldowns though that can spice things up and your self-heal makes an unwanted add not as unpleasant.  
---
Coming from a Paladin main that has just speed leveled on Silver Hand, please reconsider your choice wisely.  
---
I love the laid back leveling of watching your weapon bonk stuff into oblivion but it's not for everyone.  
---
Things can be rather tough if you don't find a good weapon.

im in the exact same boat as you  :S want to play warlock but my biggest concern is that i want to play human and play much pvp. i think it will suck vs 60%+ undead players. i love the druid mobility tho but the dmg and raiding potential is rly bad. hating feral tho.   
---
so pro wl: dots, high burst, good in pvp  
---
cons wl: i dont like pets that much and having 60-70 keybinds will cause some problems first  
---
pro druid: high mobility in pvp, fun starfire, moonfire burst possible
---
cons druid: 99% i am forced to heal in raids, respeccing is rly not what i am looking for so ideal i want a class which is fun to play and i can have the same specc pve and pvp. not min/maxing pve tho i would go specc into the pvp variant most likely

Level something else to 60 so that you can funnel that sweet intellect/spirit gear from the AH to your aoe grinder.

Where?

All hybrid classes feel this way to an extent. You don’t have to belong in the top tiers. Just enjoy the class that you love! You’ll be leveling for a long time anyway, don’t worry about raids right now. As for world pvp... it’s all a numbers game lol. Find some friends! They won’t care that you do marginally less dps... plus you’ll offer utility that no other class has.

Yes, sure, if you want to spend 10 hours wiping in mc.

&gt; ret brings damage.
---
So, what they bring literally everyone in the raid brings while either providing something extra or bringing a lot more damage?
---
&gt; As I already said, bringing less damage than other specs is not bringing no damage.
---
True, but if you're bringing less damage you better bring something else to make up for it.

&gt; Did you eve consider that taking into consideration individual needs is actually part of taking into consideration the common needs?

Didn't know about this bag being available. Thanks for the info.
---
 A note though, when selecting this as a reward I saw you can also select a trinket which gives +shadow resistance. Seems like a worthless trinket but as a warlock I might take the trinket over the bag. I have never done it but warlock tanking twin emp requires shadow resistance.  Could be this trinket is worth taking just in case you get assigned to tank when AQ is out. Though I guess engineering and 2 shadow reflectors is the go to method.

---
Awsome job!!! Any chance of making a Golemagg one? Hell I'd even donate for that \^\^
---
all servers are full lmao
---
From a silly minmax perspective horde warlocks are sllllllliiiiiiiiightly better since the alliance doesn't have undead's fearbreaker racial.
---
However, from a pve perspective, that means horde warlocks are going to be more common and finding raid spots will be a smidgeon harder since mages out dps you and you only really need one warlock per raid technically.
---
Pick which matters more, slight pvp edge or slight pve edge.
---
It won't though, TBC and WOTLK have similar meta and player scores as classic, they also had twice if not more players. More people who are actively gaming now have experience with TBC/WOTLK than with classic. 
---
You can't compare it to OSRS since OSRS dosen't really have the same kind of players, and people who originally played OSRS hate the direction that OSRS has gone, they added loads of QOL updates that would anger pretty much any hardcore classic player. Since maxing in runescape takes thousands of hours adding something new doesn't really change anything. Compared to wow where you pretty much need constant updates so people don't get bored.
---
Is troll or is retail really that bad?

cant tell

He said nothing came close to it. Them replicating parts of other games doesn't change that fact.

There’s several guides on YouTube that cover the high levels of each class.

Could also just pick the one the looks the most fun to you at login and go
---
Getting into decent slot / not be good for team effort. I got really into healers during tbc all the way to modern but got bored being a heal bot. It’s like I almost feel bad not healing? Lol idk
---
It's not, but mage can *feel* pretty slow, at least early on (I haven't leveled one super late, but talking 1-30) because you gotta drink a lot.
---
It's just how the class is, and you'll get used to it. But you drink a ton and mage water also tends to be a 'level below' the vendor food you can use. It's still better since it's free, but you're gonna forget that fast, tbh.
---
These are just the downsides to a great class, though, I just thought I'd expand on what he said.
---
I was in the same position but ended up choosing priest. I dont have time to wait for groups anymore and being able to heal greatly reduces time to find a group.
---
Wowhead says it's level 10 but according to one of the first comments of someone who was in the beta they said they could train skills on their level 5 warrior.
---
&gt; "Players must reach level 10 before they can train additional weapon skills"
---
&gt; I don't think this statement is true. I've been playing on the stress test beta, and I've been able to learn new weapon skills from level 5 as a warrior.

---
Hunter is pretty nice even in blues. 
---
You're right to be wary of shaman, enhancement is on of the worst pve specs and is pretty poor in pvp too. Al those montage videos of windfury crits definitely gives the wrong impression. They are decent healers though, so it's the only residing spec for them.

I like to roll the dice when jumping into the crater for the first time from Tanaris.  I will be on my mount and leap off the cliff at full speed, quickly dismount and start spamming the noggenfogger.  Praying I get slowfall before I hit the ground.

We’re debating going bigglesworth. I’ll let you know if we change servers (warrior, mage)

PvE is easier to level in, pvp has more to do, subjectively. It depends what you want from your experience

I'm new and will be maining  a night elf hunter. I've seen that there is this dreaded dead zone where you cant use your bow. How do you deal with that, especially in pvp?
---
Sauce?
---
Yeah that's what I mean. The drop rate is super low, but with emp runs being so fast and dal rend droprates also being pretty low, along with more competition for the roll, meant that while it might be slightly less likely that I'd see ironfoe, since it was better I figured I should just start shooting for that anyway. So I started. Did about ten runs before doing a pickup ubrs and like 3 people who needed it kindly passing the oh to me.
---
Even the image from the farting scene from scooby doo pisses me off.
---
OH god damnit... I'll go delete my post. You added shoulders and a whirlwind axe so... bow to the master.
---
Tauren Druid.
---
Herb/skinning
---
Holding on to all herbs until I hit mid 30s then start to try to taper off my supply.  My thought it no one will have any money until this stage so no sense in selling it for 30 copper if I can make 30 silver just by waiting to sell it.
---
Hopefully I’ll have enough money to buy my mount at 40.
---
Going to continue farming gold until I can afford my 60 mount.
---
Then I’m going to drop skinning and grab enchanting and power level it by soloing lowbie dungeons until 265 to craft my smoking heart of the mountain. 
---
At this point I don’t know if I’ll keep enchanting or  not.  I mean it’s already 265 and that’s a lot of work.  But I would rather have alchemy.  But that’s a bridge I’ll cross when I get there.
---
I play this game since it's 1° day! I have grown up with that we can call "nerds" :) who like lord of the rings, star wars, star trek etc etc .
---
I'm kinda sad because I would love to play this game with all the new models and graphics , a vanilla wow with everything new. But so far so good as long as we can have some memories back :D ! 
---
I can't wait to play this again :) for a while! Vanilla wow will consume more time then ppl are expecting it to , don't underestimate :)
---
Nope. They aren't any more or less viable than they were, all specs have been optimized not just the hipster builds.
---
Druid could always work, it was just a pain in the ass to make it good enough for it to be competitive. The only people who claim paladin tank or dps works are the crazy tin foil hat players that are obviously fanboying the class.
---
This is why you always have a duel ready to go when you're around mountains, it's only smart.
---
I think it's a different feeling.  Whether it's you that initiates the chat or an addon, I think the feeling is different.  If you initiate the chat, it feels more personal.  You are deciding to whisper that player and you are asking for an invite.  You might say something different every time depending on what you think the group needs.    
---
But in making that initial chat message yourself, you are showing that you are willing to put in some effort and offer yourself for the good of the group.  By contrast, if you whisper 'ok invite me now i'm an epic hunter and you need me noob' then at least you know to ignore that person (and in Classic that's a huge deal).  If an addon whispers for you, you don't get that initial first impression.  
---
If all you do is click a button and the addon whispers for you, it's not the same and you will likely just spam all groups in the hope of getting an invite.  It's just not the classic feeling and I think both vanilla players and Blizzard want that classic feeling to be present in Wow Classic.  
---
That said... I would have waited an hour or two to get a group together back in the day and I would have taken my time on individual pulls to get each and every pull just right (just like playing snooker).  I'm not sure if I would have the patience to do that now.  I'm a vanilla player and I'm looking forward to Classic but I've moved on and Wow Classic will be competing with Wow Retail on that basis.  It'll be interesting to see how things work out for both in the long term.
---
Nope, he deleted it now completely.
---
Lol I just wanna know what server to play on, it’s not that deep buddy
---
Challenge accepted!
---
You say its worth a shot but i think theres a fair chance if they do classic+ we wont have normal classic anymore. it would be odd to have both maybe, especially if theres also tbc.

Becoming the wealthiest person on a server by farming mara requires autism levels which can not be reached
---
Yeah man, it’s confusing as hell. Good for us UK folks though!
---
I just laughed throughout the video, great work!
---
So alliance then?
---
because some of us has played WoW for many, many years and even though i know the leveling in Vanilla is a big part of the game, some of us mostly care about max level content. That's why
---
After 15 years finally I will play as bard.
---
ah ok, cool. That solves that conundrum then!
---
Back then we didn’t have the knowledge that stockpiling mooncloth for bloodvine gear would be the absolute best use of mooncloth, so everyone used their cooldown to make the 16 slot bags.
---
Lol what a damn loser
---
Yes you can heal all the way up to about dungeon level 55 after that you need a smart tank and dps since long fights will drain you ... but still possible ....
---
How would they know if the plague is over? Besides, pretty sure you can still be turned without the plague.

I'm on the complete opposite now that he put a paywall on his guide.
---
I understand him having a donation button for his guide but i hate the fact that he put up a paywall 1 week before classic launch.

It's LITERALLY easier to torrent his guides than to pay for it.

This is my favorite thing

Hunter weapon.
---
Its not even just that.  I have the old 1-90 Horde guide.  Which overtime was updated for the changes.  I have to pay MORE to get the original 1-60 guide for Classic.  I have put 70$CAD to him for JUST 1-90.  He then tells me that I either pay the 5$ a month OR I pay 75USD for the current guide and the future remastered.
---
Thanks, this is true!

Simple question - I am planning to play Warlock and looked at pre-bis items. A lot of people recommend "of Shadowwrath(spelling?)" things. I have yet to see how to farm/make/get these items. My first time playing WoW so ELI5 if you can... Thank you in advance!
---
 i considered warrior but tbh rage just feels so slow because you start every fight without much 
---
i know they become good with gear but do warriors always feel slow at the start of an encounter
---
i think i prefer rogue just because you start with resources though i guess you cant just generate more no matter how much gear
---
literally reposted from a week ago
---
I sorta like being cool...
---
I don't get it.
---
lets see who has 80iq in a few days then eh?
---
30k could be adequate, but the combination of it being a reddit survey and only being 30k, makes it a less than accurate model for the over all wow classic population.
---
I don’t see how there’s anything they can do about it. There’s virtually no way to automatically flag something like that. It would just look like friends giving one another gold and definitely wouldn’t raise any red flags on Blizzard’s end. In my opinion, as long as there’s no real-world money exchanged then I see no issue with anything like that. I doubt it’ll happen much anyway to be honest. I’d imagine the number of people who will have a large amount of gold to trade in classic that need gold in retail will be very small.
---
Healing is so Zzzz imo. You could always roll a healer alt if you feel that guilty about it. I'd say play warlock if that's where your heart is. Locks have soulstones, healthstones, and summoning. That's good enough for me in terms of team effort.
---
First character is most important character. The slow slog character. Everyone is going to be poor.

Wailing Caverns, here I come!
---
That sounds funny af.
---
Yep!
---
Then you should probably read the lore on paladins, they're just priests who put on armor so orcs didn't crush them as easy. Priests of the alliance were almost always lawful good. Horde utilized shadow magic, it is just a gameplay mechanic that lets alliance use shadow magic.
---
thanks!
---
Will you be able to try Classic on a free trial account?
---
All we can hope is that the newer subbed folks will naturally go to the new servers which have lower pops. At least then the "full" servers won't get worse.
---
I'll give shaman a go. Whats the worst that can happen? Reroll, retry. But i'll try to make it work
---
And during launch.
---
And, after launch.
---
They will have to!
---
Yes, there is a cap. It depends on the profession. Check here under Profession Ranks: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-professions-overview
---
Skinning / Herbalism for leveling.  Once you hit 60 and can farm mobs, you switch to Engineer / Alchemy.  All those herbs will pay off when you start leveling Alch.
---
As a man should be.
---
Gimli as Legolas's pet. Great touch.
---
Rogue and lock aren't overpopulated. Warriors, then shaman if horde, then mage sure the most populated.

 /[u/Melderon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Melderon/), how long did it take to run all of these tests? You said it was like 180 independent test?
---
I've been struggling with this too - except between warrior and hunter.  I love warriors and want to tank, but probably will never have the time to dedicate to gear one out - since they are so gear dependent.  But... I love warriors still, and want to play one.  
---
Everyone knows the strengths of hunters, but for me it comes down to the ability to solo group content -which the warrior definitely does not have.  Also for hunter, it's not as gear dependent, and damage doesn't really fall off until raid tiers that I will absolutely never see.   Not to mention that the leveling process will be vastly faster/more enjoyable as a hunter.  
---
Last night I was fed up with my indecision, so I grabbed the closest coin and flipped it.  Heads for warriors, tails for hunter.   Hunter it is then.
---
Zug Zug
---
That UI is horrendous but that did clarify thanks.
---
My experience was from EU release day. When running to instance some people were still on their slow mounts for awhile. Depends on type of players. Me and my friends had our swift mounts really fast but we still saw the slow ones around on allies and enemies.
---
thats why you go there with a non-druid class and start aimed shotting lowbies and feign death
---
Yeah that's kinda what I was getting at. It's not like you're being super idle and actually spending lots of time on it. It's just something you do aside.
---
pvp is the way to go
---
I did which is why this picture looks so weird. This picture shows Sylv hanging out with human Arthas while he's about to pull Frostmourne out sword-in-the-stone style, and the ice is reflecting them as Lich King arthas and UD sylv. In the war3 story that's not at all how it happens. Frostmourne was frozen in a block of solid ice in a cave and the only people there when Arthas broke it out was Muradin and a couple nameless footmen. Arthas didn't meet Sylvanas until he was already undead himself.
---
One of those trees in the background could be a Druid
---
Buy some celery so your bathroom trips won't be a complete nightmare
---
If we ever get to that point - but I remember the horse being introduced late into the expansion as well.  
---
I could actually see them not adding the horse in at all.
---
Because of poor spending. If he plays wow classic he’ll be fine.
---
&gt; In every market, you will see a few consistent names come up over and over again. These are your main competitors. Their presence can wipe out your profit margin if you get into a price war with them. Instead of undercutting each other, add them to your friends list to learn what their schedules are. Wait until most of them have logged off before listing your auctions. This way, you can slightly undercut them and take their sales without risking retaliation. 
---
Or, make friends with them, and form a cartel.  You know, like in real life.
---
We start early GMT 27th, Toecrusher #2844 :)
---
Yep. 2 servers and a few characters gone because of getting shut down or admins fucking things up in purpose. I’m so glad to play vanilla in a blizzard server.
---
I think I’ve finally settled my debate.
---
I was torn between reliving my glory days as a Resto Druid or punishing myself by playing a Prot Warrior because it’s new and I like a challenge.
---
I’ve decided to go with a Warrior.
---
Both were very complete classes with multiple viable specs in both pvp and pve. They both scale well with gear and have awesome looking sets.
---
I heard on many videos this sets were added with AQ patch.
---
give her some valerian
---
Blizzard has to impress the stock holders every quarter trust and believe there will be server transfers and race changes...... lol money over everything
---
40ish hours
---
That’s weird, your account shouldn’t have any flags on it. It’s almost as old as mine and I have no problems posting a lot. Usually there’s a 15 minute limit on new accounts. Are you new to the sub, maybe? I doubt that would do anything though.
---
While leveling a couple Horde characters (Undead and Orc) is it possible to hit level 60 without much overlap in the zones you visited?
---
I won't hit 60 this week. I'll still finally get to experience leveling in a hardcore way at the start of a big server's life. I'm going to have a blast seeing the race to 60 firsthand while also seeing how far I can go!
---
All these posts are making this feel like a marathon running sub.
---
most people will be new, most classes are easy to get pretty ok with , by tye time you hit 60 you if you read and watch a few guides you should know your class well and thats all that matters
---
maybe join a guild too and do some leveling with people
---
With a real pathing, DM farm will impossible.
---
But, let's be real, it's not gonna happen. Everyone will be rich now, all the farming spots are known
---
That's how they started yes, I know the lore lol, and not true of priests either, we have plenty of examples on that as well, even within the scarlet crusade.
---
I know the lore very well man, that's why I believe my analysis is correct. But you are allowed to have your own fantasy of what you like

You should add one of a mage trying to slow fall and realizing he doesn’t have light feathers.

You might want to watch a video on class choice since it's going to impact your experience a lot. Check out madseasonshow race picking classic on YouTube. Take your time. Be careful not to get surrounded by enemies. Try to interact with other people, for instance by offering to help them.
---
Haha I honestly don’t remember my rotation too well, so sorry if I sounded like I was complaining. I guess it’s assumed rogues have the most “complex” rotation for what classic offered?

Thanks for the info, very good stuff

This is hands down my favorite Episode of Avatar and now my favorite WoW Classic meme to ever grace this sub Thank you
---
And to think back when classic was out people were enraged about horse armor. To be fair, its the same demographic. I would not be surprised if the same people who spoke out against horse armor are the same people who would refuse to sub to reserve a name.
---
Troll priests with Blackout are very strong against melee (Shadow Guard) and ok against casters (down ranked Hex)
---
Ah ok thank you very much. So typically you'd just end up buying them on the AH?
---
Blizzard will never make official statements about those kinds of things. Its all from surveys

I never saw anything wrong with clicking but last time I compared the 2 I was a young teen lol.

Could anyone detail why u like clicking over and how have u made it do able or comfortable.
---
They had restrictions where you couldn’t transfer to full servers in the past, paid or not. So I wouldn’t be trying to bank on going to a full server later like it will be 100% given.
---
Some of the guides out there actively work with streamers who get the message out. Working full time while going to school while developing the platform and recalibrating the routes I barely have time to sleep. I'm happy the people it was originally meant for can now use it. Everything on top of that is icing on the cake.
---
Either way, thank you for the kind words!
---
This topic is new and fresh.
---
It’s interesting that this is the case. Normally, one would expect a developer to positively iterate on an MMO (or any game). If the changes to the game were not well-received, why didn’t Blizzard change course? Just curious
---
ye it comes as a external launcher, when you log in you can download the addon. I just wondering whats happening when the subscription runs out because the addon is in the interface folder
---
there are also other "ingame guide addons" out there like dugis but i dont like the interface zygors has beste :D
---
As a NE fury you can get great mileage from axes and fist weapons because no-one else in raids wants them that badly. Worth conaidering if you end up raiding.
---
Awesome thank you for the explanation. Really appreciate it. Are these farmable anywhere? Or do they typically just end up being purchased on the AH?
---
You seem jealous
---
I want to go questing in Mulgore! WHY ARE YOU CLOSING YOUR SERVERS TO THE PUBLIC?! TELL US THE REAAAAASSONN
---
I feel like there will be an unspoken rule during leveling where neither party wants to risk wasting time with runbacks...  
---
Which goes down the drain when one side finds someone low on HP/mana.  Anger will flow. I cant wait.
---
Thanks for the tips. I was considering LW/skinning to help the guild with devilsaur pieces but I was really interested in engineering this time around for the boost to pvp!
---
Huh, I may have been a cheap-ass back then, but I carried portal runes around as a hunter and usually gave those in exchange for a portal if people did not specifically ask for tips.
---
Seriously considering that as well. As I havent even been able to create a character yet (im waiting to resub a few hours before launch), I dont have any server loyalty.

Maybe YOU are the bigredditorman of your group... 💁‍♂️

I doubt they will allow transfer TO a server marked full. It's that type of behaviour that creates dead realms.
---
I plan on trying my hardest to play shadowpriest at endgame. But you have to accept the facts - in a raid scenario / boss fight you may end up wanding more than you think... mana is a real problem
---
I like how you're being toxic while trying to call out toxic people
---
I knew i shouldve just copied and pasted the entire thing into a word doc. This is what i get for trusting people's sites wont go down.  Oh well. I guess i just try and burn through the early levels. Theyre pretty easy anyway
---
Please tell me it’s not like Black Desert Online. Lol
---
The real answer you are looking for is that your auto attack time is still progressing while you move so all you have to do is pause your moving for half a sec or less and your auto attack will trigger. This is called stutter stepping and it's fairly standard practice for kiting in most games. Get yourself a weapon swing timer addons and just stop really quick to get the shot off every time your attack is up.
---
By the time people can shell out 15s, they probably hit their first wand quest.
---
0/10, not a meme number
---
Lol they said “thousands” of players. They may have underestimated. Or they were already assuming different servers. Or they were already conspiring sharding /s
---
The moat reliable way would be to buy off of the AH, but you can get them from world drops. Afaik not at a specific place, however.

I could use horde if anyone will help out.

Does that massive typo make this count as low effort?

I wonder how much class populations are going to change this go round and how that’ll affect things like raid spot availability. In vanilla, warlocks were rare and needed and hunters felt like they were played by 40% of the people playing the game. But almost every poll I’ve seen, even the madseason one which is up to 50k people, has warlocks as one of if not the most popular classes and hunters very low on the list. You definitely need a few hunters for tranq so I’m thinking if people have learned that raiding as a hunter is more difficult than almost every other class (and the pet management can be very annoying), maybe getting a spot will be easier than it was back in the day? Only time will tell though. I know polls like that aren’t always representative of the general population, but it is interesting that hunters are so low on the list on all of them.

Could you make it for a phone!?

I'm worried that in a month or so player drop off isn't as big of a thing as blizzard is expecting, and the player base seems to hate layering. So if they drop layering and the servers remain very populated, then it will suck. Or they'll then attempt to create more servers and then fracture the player base, or other player related drama will occur.
---
Didn’t think so. Gotta get those few talents in shadow and gonna put the rest in disc

And yet crushes them in dps races.

Just because you win gold in the sexlympics doesn’t mean you’ll even qualify in badminton.

He did say for months before hand that he was going to be putting a cost up for the guide right before launch. He also only did it because he wants to use the money to help pay for his medical bills and he lives very cheap. He even said if you want to torrent it go ahead, but he wanted to give people the option to support him
---
Where can I find results?
---
This is extremely likely...
---
I hope for the best for you my dude,  I say that too,  but I have below average self control... usually if I cut something,  I gotta cut it all.  Haven't had cereal for 3 years now,  I still dream about it.

Give your hammer a good old zug zug.
---
Blizz speaking to various journo websites: yeah, we've had a higher-than-anticipated interest and we've had to create many more servers than we intended...
---
vanilla community: ya don't say!
---
What gfx said, yes, but just level with 5/5 wand spec, 5/5 spirit tap and then go into shadow spec until shadowform at least. You'll still easily heal dungeons
---
Wow, that's actually significantly better...
---
It's all corny, everything is. Us, this game, how fucking excited a bunch of grown men are for a video game
---
We don't care because we all know that feel, and we all get a little emotional when we think about going home.
---
Excluding the retail zoomers and new players.
---
It’s expected.  I believe a healthy population will stick around afterward though.
---
Happy Cake Day! I am the same way and love researching and learning everything I can about the game and current class I’m playing. I played vanilla through WotLK but good on you for limiting yourself I’m sure you will have a great experience!
---
Been playing WoW on and off since BC but have basically stuck to hunter/DK for 90% of my playtime. Looking to have either warlock or shadow priest as my main. Which is more viable for dungeons/raids, PvP and 1-60 and which do you think is more fun and you would recommend me to try? Leaning more towards SPriest atm.
---
Yes you can. It is under World of Warcraft&gt;_classic&gt;interface&gt;addons. I wouldn’t recommend using the curse manager just yet. They are missing tons of crucial addons and the addons aren’t always updated.
---
Go daggers and laugh at them all.
---
All 4 are great tips. 2 I might have never though of. Nice guide!
---
Sounds awesome! I have to work :(
---
I believe they said insidious (eastern PVP) would come up on Monday.
---
I'm the same way. But isn't leveling going to be a little daunting? I have some buddies to play with but we normally end up just going at our own speed due to times we can play. Priest soloing seems so boring compared to the mage with being able to pull multiple mobs and aoe them down.
---

Pom pyro. 5 minute one shot build. Just sheep them till cooldown s are up.
---
You can check to see if your addOns are loading properly by loading into the server lobby for character creation. You can also test Classic addOns in the Retail client.
---
I keep switching between wanting to play a Priest, Druid or Rogue.. 
---
One thing I know for sure is that I don't want to play Mage, Warlock or Paladin.
---
PST
---
A lot of people, my group included, picked Faerlina and reserved names there before it was the official streamer server. Lots have moved to other servers, but the reservations remain for many.
---
All this is very true. Kinda scary to think that statistically, several of us may STILL not make launch. Be safe out there, everyone!!
---
Tomorrow for NA -- it's currently 11am Eastern Time and realms open in 30 hours.
---
Used to feel this way until I read some of the lore and realized the humans have this bad ass survival story where they’ve overcome massive losses i.e. SW was conquered by the original horde in the 1st game, the alliance was formed and pushed the horde back in wc2, then Lordaeron, the greatest human kingdom and the one which the alliance was built around was destroyed by undead plague in wc3.
---
I haven't fucked with addons yet but I have watched a few youtube videos and somebody mentioned one called questie. So...that's all I know.
---
Clear communication with your friends is key. If you plan to reach 60 together, then nobody should be questing solo. Agree to level alts when you can't all play together and you don't have to worry about anyone out leveling the group
---
Yup. Although a good retail tank can pull hard since most damage is in mechanics and not just AAs now
---
Pretty sure it's not night anywhere atm, nor is it even the day before yet. Still monday.
---
Can we get a v5 poll that isn't confusing people by asking about their origin instead of what language they plan on using ingame?
---
Everything wants to stab you when you are a tauren :/
---
&gt;But I hate to break it you,  and this isn't a downer but Gatorade has more carbs in a single serving than a keto diet would usually allow
---
Not Gatorade Zero.
---
Exactly. Both of those are so appealing. I'll mostly be leveling by myself, which is making me nervous about the priest leveling. Afraid I might get so bored before 60
---
So it's not even worth casting immolate or Conflag, as in they do no DPS?
---
Not all of them. Faerlina, Herod, and [Stalagg](https://discord.gg/Vzaqfq) have one, though.
---
That's not what i am saying. If he wanted to cash in he might as well have had a paywall for the past 14 years. But that's of course not profitable. Only now that classic is relaunching can he make a quick buck by having all the people recommend his guide for the past month and only now add paywall to it. Making people desperate and paying.
---
Flair checks out
---
I crashed during stress test after an hour+ queue but when i booted the game right away i got in without queue. Might be the same on launch
---
Haha I’m so glad I’m not the only one! I threw on the bloodfang set instead of the normal challenge mode gear I’ve had as my mog since MoP.
---
My weight bench is all of 15 feet from my computer.  I will be lifting some while on flight paths.  Problem solved.

---

---
Classicwow's guide isn't bad, but its narrative is not as thorough as Joana's. I think vanilla newbs might find Joana's more useful because he tells you where to find each quest giver (i.e. "Accept Chen's Empty Keg from so-and-so to the left of the Plate-and-Chain").
---
hahaha brilliant
---
On the stress test I got in instantly when the servers opened.  My friend got home from work 2 hours later and he had a 15 minute queue.
---
Is it reasonable to go down a certain build for phase one and then completely re-spec for later phases? I really like fire mage but this is of course essentially useless for the first phase. Is it at all viable to spec frost at first and then change later?
---
Then it's possible it's a driver comparability issue.
---
These are rookie numbers.
---
I don't remember exactly, but maybe about 24hrs in total :) I had some challenges along the way
---
Awesome stuff. Got anymore class sheets?
---
Let me gather all mine, I think I have you beat.
---
I'd argue the opposite. Most people would of paid it and would then complain that the name reservation was a money grab. Which is more or less the point I was making.
---
More Layers then Lasagne, lovely 😂👌
---
I do the same.  Endorphins make gaming much better.
---
Thanks for all the advice guys, hopefully I will get lucky this time!
---
I might do one for the new survey tomorrow
---
The only thing that could make it feel like  we're kids again is if they forced us to buy hard copy and did a midnight release. Not gonna lie...I'd do it if it was an option. Something about that drive home with the game in the passenger seat, rushing in the house/apartment to install the discs.
---
From the Q&amp;A:
---
Q: Will PAID transfers also be a thing should a server drop heavily in population and a player wishes to move to find more activity or reconvene with friends on another server? 
---
A: We’re considering integrating a character transfer service once players have reached higher levels. This was available in the original WoW. We’ll look at the rules we imposed at that time and also discuss the implications of players moving to a new realm. We believe realm identity is an important aspect of Classic so any guidelines around transfers should support this belief.
---
Q: Will there be paid services for Classic? 
---
A: We aren’t considering other services beyond character transfer at this time.

From Joana's website:

"Members Area:  My members area will launch one week before Classic WoW launches.  At this time I am unsure of how much content will be in it.  I suspect it will be about the same price of a Twitch sub (of only about $5 a month or so).  The members area will support the ongoing efforts to improving my leveling guides over time.  There is a lot more content planned for the future, including remastered TBC leveling guides (even if Blizzard does not launch Classic TBC).  And remastered WOTLK leveling guides.  I plan to continue to make leveling guides for WoW full time for many years to come! "
---
He said he'd have a member's area and was unsure how much content would be in it. Read that how you will, but I  don't think the claim that he was upfront and explicit that the existing guides would be put into this member's area is accurate.
---
Hopefully we get more Horde on Hydraxian. I'm probably going to be playing Alliance more but I want to try RPing forsaken too. :(

Hah, it may come out, but I won’t be seeing it for a week and a half.

They made games like that, and they didnt turn out well. After 3 years of classic and people start finishing all the content we will see TBC
---
Yeah man, I can definitely see the effort! Really nice work! Ill totally download this while I’m rocking the new experience!
---
Then level and play with all your friends. Their going to need a dungeon tank
---
I don’t.  I would rather them stay on Herod instead of coming to my server and causing queues.
---
How so? All you do is literally right click
---
My thoughts exactly. Mages are still really needed in raids and groups, but being a healer pulls soooooo much more weight in finding parties and raids. But the grind to 60 seems potentially boring on a priest. I know on a mage I wouldn't get bored but maybe I'm just saying that. I love being able to solo as the mage, but the priest seems more fun for raids and dungeons
---
All my real life friends won’t betray the horde side. I’m sticking with it. I think I’m going troll priest considering I did a lot of pvp I wanna focus for on pve. I want to move to alliance but I just cannot do that.
---
After all this time I'm going to die so much without having bird form to pop into
---
That is really beautiful
---
Go SM/Ruin or DS/Ruin and spam shadowbolt and keep your curses up. That’s about it
---
Depending on what content you're pursuing, yes, it makes perfect sense to change your build ever phase or even every raid.
---
The best thing we can do as a community is just not use it.
---
I lost my Shyt on that comment
---
Well played
---
Grew up very poor, I got to play wow on a 14 inch screen at 4-16 fps on lowest settings. Played a healer cause "if I keep pressing the button, the game will register at least one through my shit  internet". Played a pally cause it had fewer things to press.
---
I cannot describe how it feels to run this on a PC that can run the game at a solid 120fps on highest settings. Feels like I got somewhere and now I'm going home.
---
These are amazing! Majoras mask was my favorite game as a kid and wow was my favorite game as a teenager. Great combo
---
My friends and I are going Bigglesworth Alliance
---
Send me a message and once my group gets a bit established with characters  I can let you know  who we are :)
---
Bro, you gotta Feign Death. It's the only way to drop the aggro.
---
we should kill him irl o_o it is the only way
---
Yeah it's really not relevant
---
&gt; How am i stealing something he offered for free for the past 5+ years? Explain.
---
This isn't the 2006 guide. It's a new one.
---
Not buying anything in their In-Game shop though :P
---
Just let it go, man.  Enjoy the game.
---
I'm either going incendius or bigglesworth ally. Idk what I'm rolling, I'll probably go warlock though.
---
Wait, for real?

Just ask me in 2 weeks again :D

Super smart to downvote this so noone can see it. I am totally against LFG Addons.

Just started watching trailerpark boys like 2 weeks agom this is the perfect quote for this pic.
---
Thanks my friend, I’ll be back for this later today.
---
Is that what you are playing? I love dps mage and being able to aoe grind like crazy, but I've never healed and it seems like fun for raids and dungeons. But not sure if classic is the best setting to try that out for the first time
---
they are immune to fire
---
Since they don't release stats I would love to see your source. Most polls, which are super inaccurate, show it within 15% of each other.
---
Be aware BGs wont be until phase 3 which is months away.
---
No one will :)
---
awesome but For the Horde !
---
I will try to answer you as to why I think people are looking forward to it.
---
Obviously nostalgia is a very strong motivator for people to get into Classic WoW again. However, what exactly are they nostalgic about?
---
There are two big reasons I can think off (while there might be more).
---
First, is the social aspect of the game. There is a certain difficulty through classic WoW that requires you to rely on others. It forces you to group up and do dungeons and to join a guild and do raids. 
---
Social reputation and making friends really matters and when a lot of people join together with the same interests it creates a great atmosphere to meet and make new friends. As humans we are generally social creatures and creating a community on the group, guild and server level is a huge part of the game.
---
I am not even sure if this was intended, but somehow classic WoW just is the right mix that supports the development of such communities. So, making new friends and working together towards a goal is what I think brings a lot of people back to WoW classic.
---
Another really important thing is that it harkens back to simpler times for a whole generation. A time before streamers, a time before Fortnite and a time before pay-to-win gambling loot boxes.
---
You pay a monthly subscription for WoW and it is pretty clear what you get for that. Cool gear is something you have to work for which creates something like the IKEA-effect. When you put together a dresser from IKEA you value it more because you had to work for it yourself.
---
That is the same with WoW. While it is 15 years old it gets the basics very right for these two things. There is a lot to do, a lot to work for and a lot of friends to make.
---
If that sounds worthwhile to you I would for sure give it a shot.
---
[[Yes](https://www.geek.com/games/gamer-dies-after-playing-world-of-warcraft-for-19-hours-straight-1617225/)
---
Semi-alone.  My husband will play, but we're on different servers and won't roll together until phase 3.  Looking forward to meeting people.
---
How about Cleaning your Keyboard? 😂
---
I don't know where you are, but where I am (Seattle, WA, USA), it's the day before Classic launches.
---
We encourage low effort here
---
It’s vanilla bro, there’s no dual specs.  If you wanted to pvp and you either spent 50g to respec every weekend, or more likely you had a few pvp talents in your pve spec
---
It's nice but your HS finger gets real sore sometimes. I had a really well defined click muscle by the end of TBC
---
Why does the developer have a vendetta? I guess I dont see why it's worth it.
---
I'm alright with the paywall. Its the subscription model I dont like. Sure I could pay and get my money back in 60 days but Id rather not have to worry about messing with all that.
---
Oh lawd, imma Grab some Popcorn
---
Very well done. I’ll have to save this for Christmas and Winter’s Veil.
---
I thought it comes out on the 27th? Yet everyone is saying “only one more day”
---
I absolutely love gnomes. So I vote gnome. And dwarf+gnome is cool.
---
Can we have a final class survey, please/bitte/por favor/snälla?
---
At least go tailoring once. You'll be able to craft your BiS robes until ZG. Pattern drops in LBRS. Once you craft it you can drop tailoring for something else if you like.
---
nah
---
Omar comin.
---
Also for pve dwarves have the gun spec, but I'd say NE is still the favoured.
---
This is why you never pug a tank
---
Warrior is one of the top melee dps there is.
---
&gt; The act of finding someone and inviting them into the party is hardly a social interaction. 
---
&gt; You still were unable to tell me if you really would put anyone on your friend list just because they answered to your LFG spam once. 
---
After the run is said and done, I'm very likely to add everyone that participated. (yes, even if it was a cold run with barely anyone talking)  
---
Reason being, I primarily don't want to look for people (incentive) for a long time.   
---
There's a few benefits to this;  
---
\-They will most likely be around the same level as you as you go.  
---
\-You know you can count on them to not leeroy jenkins the dungeon.  
---
\-They are more likely to accept your invite even if they aren't particularly looking to do a dungeon.  
---
\-The more you play with them, the more you know them, the more likely you are to stay in contact with them after reaching 60.
---
Please note; I'm not saying it's not possible to make friends with the use of that LFG addon.  
---
What I'm trying to say is that you are less likely to make them, or just make less of them.
---
You need to be level 6 to pick up the profession.
---
You will see some banks at level 6 with enchanting so they can disenchant items.  You can disenchant any item with level 1 enchanting.

Fire isn't useless first phase, it does really good damage during the pre bis phase.  It's not even bad leveling, just not as efficient.  If you want to play fire play fire early.  I would respec frost once you are done with 5 mans though.  On my rogue I would respec 2-4 times per week depending on what I was doing so it's more then fine to respec often.  Just be prepared to spend a good amount of gold.
---

Its not the $5.

You said what I was thinking XD
---
Lol I'm still undecided, but mage is the one I planned out the most. To try and get ahead of the curve and aoe grind
---
D; never mind I live in Central time zone myself so I’m going to plan on Eastern so it’ll just be an hour ahead of my own
---
Those LFG Addon guys are gonna be getting the ghosts of classic past tonight i tell you whut.
---
Pretty sure midnight August 26 so technically the 27th
---
Was torn between priest an mage but im time dependant so i decided to go with mage as its best dps in pve and pvp. Also free food/drinks and portals. Will eventually make an priest alt
---
That’s  why I’ve been eating nothing but spinach and whole wheat bread all week and wrapping myself in bubble wrap while driving 10mph under the speed limit until launch.
---
Yeah that's true. Its more likely people will leave full servers, rather than join them.   
---
On the other hand, more servers are launching in a few hours, who knows, it might be better to migrate to those instead of staying in the full ones. They might even add a few more.  
---
All in all, I don't think it matters all that much, populations across servers will even out eventually. I bet for 24-48h post launch.
---
Better for a casual player to go heals or dps? Still can't pick out of warlock, Druid or shammy. 😭😭
---
Yes you can still setup on them. It means there are more ppl on the server then the server limit so you can expect ques. Quite long ones for the first week.
---
Yes, I entirely agree with that. In the beginning, there will be plenty of growing pains and hard lessons learned.
---
You can still play on them but they're expected to have queues on release. I'm not sure about the state of Americas but Europe will be having some new realms added to the realm list tomorrow ( 26 August 2019 18:00 GMT+1) you can wait until then to make a character if you prefer less queueing.
---
No it wasn't just liberties. The SP guys are pretty stupid.
---
Yeah, I can't decide if Holy Priest or Prot Warrior!
---
You can create any character on any servers if it’s full then it won’t stop you
---
Shaman and Paladin, lol.
---
i remember as a scrub not realizing the first rank wasnt enough time to hearth and raging when my bubble ended before i got out of there
---
love it thank you for this
---
30h and a half. for me it is midnight 26th, so early on the 27th.
---
Nope. The game is perfectly playable as-is and any “must have” add-ons aren’t necessary till endgame. There are plenty of small quality of life add-ons but I’d play for quite a while and get used to the game so you can know what’s worth it to you to change.
---
Also true on war mode retail for level 120s. Lost track of how many times I was randomly killed in TOWN while leveling in Redridge. But the moment another 120 comes around they disappear.
---
"You just spammed heroic strike and execute"
---
But Boromir is lvl 23 and you learn execute at lvl 24. Seems like Aragon doesn't know classic all to well either ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Ebay
---
That's a huge difference. These online Reddit polls have responses in the tens of thousands which is without a doubt statistically significant.
---
It's regardless. Even if you're actively making a character.
---
Plot twist, because of how time works she actually pressed the button 15 years ago.
---
What isbthat thing? A w-woman you say?
---
Love the guides, is this one similar to your other advanced leveling guide but updated for classic? Or is it entirely new?
---
Without bra and pants. 
---
Merry that girl now!
---
From my experience this shit is flipped backwards.
---
PVE players rarely get to world PVP normally. So they'd be the ones harassing and fighting constantly because the moments are more rare on PVE realms.
---
Running around PVP flagged on a PVE server in vanilla meant you'd be chain harassed much more than PVP servers since the PVE 60s are fiending for you to flag.
---
PVE players ignore PVP flags much less. PVP players will think it's not worth their time, PVE players just saw a rare piece of ass walk by.
---
Ad revenue with traffic is a good start. Please donate PayPal is also a great way for people to support you. Especially if you dont have a big following.
---
Well both, its technically 8/27 at midnight. So tomorrow at midnight.
---
Yeah there were for sure some grinches in the comment but they always made my day so.
---
Hunter shares gear with all classes if i remember right
---
&gt; Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full.

Above Medium. Not Medium. Above Medium.

 Let him watch some videos and he will come to a conclusion on his own, they all have their own learning curve and some may just seem more enjoyable than others. Bring the horse to the pond, don't try and stick his face into the pond.
---
use gloves cos it's actually a baby briarthorn
---
I’m going mining/eng then switching mining to probably tailoring(or alch if I have an alt gathering herbs) on my Priest at 60 depending on how much Thorium is going for. Gonna suck not having access to mooncloth/felcloth/truefaith but I think the pvp advantage is too much to pass up
---
Play a Shaman. Shamans are a fantastic utility class with tremendous flexibility. Unlike in retail WoW, you still have access to almost the entire toolkit of your off-spec trees, you just won't use any of them as efficiently. Outside of people pushing for world firsts, most raids will be delighted to have warm bodies filling up the **40!** people required to move through content. Very few guilds will be able to field a 40 man roster with an ideal meta composition, and fewer still after the initial few months when the shine is off and the player base is starting to ebb. If you're still around at that time, a committed and competent Shaman player will look pretty good, regardless of spec.
---
And if you're not still around at that time, you'll be happy the 100's of hours you spent leveling and gearing in the game you returned to for fun and nostalgia was spent playing a class you actually wanted to play, and enjoyed that time with.
---
You haven’t thought about the smell you bitch!
---
there will be new servers coming up tomorrow before launch.
---
Do you have a link to a blue saying this is the case. Because that was introduced very late into vanilla
---
Sure. I think the straight up translation is "delight in the misery of others" but I tend to think of it as less sinister. I see it like this: The universe likes to screw us all over, but sometimes it'll make you chuckle when bad luck hits someone else, and not you.
---
Well I wont be able to play it right at launch since I still have to go to work and do normal day to day things. The "migration" would only benefit people who can play as soon as the world opens.
---
I wasn't aware that I came off as a crybaby. What about my post gave the impression? Or do you just like calling people crybaby? Genuinely curious.
---
I played warrior in classic, it wasn't quite that bad. Im looking forward to tanking my way through the game again.
---
Hunters have mana guys don’t forget lol
---
Literally all you need for the next few months. Bravo!
---
On raids you don’t use immolate and other dots. Only SB an CoE becouse of debuff slots :-)
---
It’s a simultaneous global release, so when it launches it’ll be the 26th in some of the world and the 27th in the rest. If you’re CST, it’s the 26th at 5:00pm for you
---
Incendius - EST PvP will open 10am tomorrow morning EST time.
---
My first thought aswell.
---
Wow is so old we have boomer comics
---
Hunters start with leather and get mail at 40 like shamans.
---
Also has great pve usage for solo content since the higher AS means better threat
---
Don't use the Twitch app, it updated my friends classic addons to retail versions. Anything Twitch related is just hot garbage.
---
I was trying for a while to get my group of online friends to all roll on the same server, but everyone wants something different or shaman/pally. But i agree with everyone else, part of the fun is meeting people in dungeon groups that you end up adding to your friends list, or doing an entire zone of quests with.
---
Yes, it’s still limited to 3 how ever. 5 hours before launch the limit will be lifted and you can make 10per server and 50 per account.
---
No. You're better off starting with a stock UI and then adding add-ons when you find something you would like improved. For instance, "I was there was a better way to manage my inventory... I wonder if there is an add-on for that?"
---
That said, once you hit endgame and start raiding some add-ons are effectively mandatory and some guilds will require you to have them.
---
Can always blame a rogue who tries to stealth past a group of elite mobs to try and get a chest and when he gets knocked out of stealth comes sprinting back to the group and vanishes..
---
Herb is good money if you enjoy gathering. Mages have other income options though, they are the best mob farmers ingame with their AoE abilities.
---
Alch is a convenience and a bit of extra profit if you like watching the AH. Basically an alternate way to vend your herbs. You can take it with herbing, by no means necessary though since nothing it produces if BoP.
---
Tailor is considered nearly mandatory for the endgame BoP robe. That's pretty minmax, because there's a slightly worse one that's BoE you can buy. Can make a bit of money off bags and mooncloth without any real effort, not a ton though. A lot of clothies take tailoring for the BiS impact. Once bloodvine set comes out, it replaces 3 gear slots and is BiS for warlocks, I think the same for mages. You need 300 tailoring for this benefit.
---
Enchanting is just... not something the average player should touch. Yes it's optimal, but the average player will enchant almost nothing and either ignore it or drop it long run unless it's required for a BoE trinket (druids). To become a good enchanter takes a ton of dedication, a ton of time spamming chats, and lots of making yourself available to enchant.
---
So all that said? Tailoring is a yes. Minmaxers will go Tailoring/Engineering (Eng for utility, stuns, extra damage) and aoe farm for money. But if you like picking flowers, you could pick up herblore with tailoring for a bit of extra cash.
---
Thank you for this.
---
I’m already going to be poor and leveling slow as a warrior.  I need every frugal option I can get.
---
Yep, I'm one of those people.
---
Do you have any proof for what you're saying? If youre referring to layering, that doesn't really alter supply/demand too drastically. We don't know the populations are higher than back then.
---
Chaotic good.
---
Chest sitting? Yeah, it works.
---
"guys spread out if you don't want queues" blizzard tells the guy after 5th time he swaps
---
Yes :)
---
I’ll be EU I’m afraid
---
it was for beta to get tests on multiple specs.
---
not in classic tho
---
I am going back to do some last part of my license stuff tomorrow.. Damn me for waiting so long with it that it landed on the worst day possible, Might miss most of the 4 first days.
---
As someone who is new maybe Atlasloot as well? Just thinking of them trying to get gear etc.
---
It's because he's top dog, you're just jealous
---
While mages both pve and pvp as frost, the specs are *very* different they're pretty bad for doing the other job.
---
Yeah it shouldn't be
---
Actually there's a simple talk to someone quest from goldshire in stormwind which gives you a bunch of money at around lvl 5.
---
People complaining about a $5 charge LUL. $5 is literally nothing. There are people who are spending hundreds of dollars so they can get a name on certain realms.
---
i hadn't seen all the EU servers before, mirage raceway is a badass name. too bad its pve
---
He got into it as a poor human boy growing up in a goblin coast town.  Since humans were discriminated against at every turn, he found that his only choices in life were scavenging engineer components from trash heaps, or braving the monster filled beaches to catch fish.
---
As he gained fame for being the best fisherman to come out of STV, exploitative goblins enticed him with lucrative sponsorships to use his name on fishing rods, books and high-stakes fishing tournaments.  With his poor educational background, he quickly spent these fortunes on mounts, mead and gnome prostitutes before ending up penny-less.   
---
Pat Nagle doesn't like fishing; he fishes to survive.  He's from the mean streets and is totally fearless when it comes to finding bigger and more rare fish to fill his pockets with gold.  His poor life choices, masterful fishing skills and desperation eventually lead him to attempt the ultimate score in the Gurubashi village of Zul'Gurub.
---
redditors that think "meme" classes aren't viable..
---
No that second part is wrong. You CAN level 1-300 in one spot, but you will need to get the training. You could if you want just buy the book of the AH and never leave the city pool you are fishing in.
---
Actually good advice, I guess thats the better option. A leather working hunter sounds fun and useful, so ill go that route! GL out there!
---
Remember these pools are only get the audience active on reddit which is a small and specific subset of the community. I am almost certain the main healing, tank, and dps class are over represented compared to the general player base.
---
It definitely worked in retail. But you had to not spam it but instead time it so you'd be jumped out of the lava whenever a tick happened.
---
Nice meme, upvoted.
---
 Hardly the world record is like just over 4 days played. Which is 92 hours. 10 days at 16 hours is 160 hours. That's no where close to wla waordl record.
---
So you are going to take up a spot of someone that actually could play?
---
This video will set you free https://youtu.be/wnZQzO9h-ek (note: it has another part 2 video, so you might want to check it out and skip to the part where your question is answered)
---
It's so cool watching you paint these. Beautiful.
---
Barrens chat flashbacks intensify
---
Tfw barely getting into my myzrael
---
Why the hell would you play night elf anything? With their shot racials, and warrior for that matter.
---
This math is pretty crude here, so bear with me, but for explanation purposes:
---
Your goal is to keep Flurry up as much as possible. So even if you're able to maintain constant up time with 3/5 flurry, you will be attacking 10% slower than a standard 2h fury Warrior. 
---
That means every 10hits, you're effectively missing a swing.
---
In exchange, you're getting a 5% chance (so every 20 or so hits) to proc a 2nd attack. 
---
So you're actually reducing your overall white hits by ~1 every 20 seconds by not picking Flurry over Imp SS.
---
This made me cry a little
---
I'd think mage or priest would be ideal for a casual player over any of those options.  Mage is the god-tier class of vanilla in terms of ease-of-use, utility, and just plain fun-factor.  Priest would give you the option of two damage trees (although neither is particularly desired in raids overall) and very versatile healing.  Either one gives you at least 1 of the easiest mode CC spells you can get in the game (i.e. Polymorph or Fear) and mage has multiple ways of dealing with oh-shit situations.
---
How are you gonna sap 10 people ?
---
Also in case no one has mentioned yet this video is a handy little skip

You too friend!

What's the margin of error for 'not everyone that plays wow uses reddit'?
---
I always remember that being my first purchase. Always got a few bags from vendors even if it meant dumping a bit of silver early on. Good point.
---
Nope. Because by the time I get home, the queue should be about finished.
---
This game has made me so productive. It has given me zero interest in playing anything else, so I've been cleaning the most random shit I own. And I cleaned out the truck in my car for the 1st time in years.
---
I'll enjoy sucking the soul out of your body as you die a slow death, filthy ally.

I'd call it click BAIT, but that's just me.

Oh god I forgot about this. Thank you.

I made 5k gold in about a week (little bit longer, maybe 8 days) hustling cooldowns to make primal mooncloth bags in TBC.

Horde on skeram, i dont have anyone playing either buy ive meet some people on this subreddit. I think this is where im going to land
---
Soulstone Base Jumping!
---
WARLOCKS ARE EXTREME!
---
Ret paladin is really good.
---
Does that work for classic and include vendor pricing?
---
Asking for myself here lol. I like to run with minimal addons and haven't used it yet.
---
Sometimes I google things when I’m not sure about them.
---
Because of the bubble? I was thinking they were like shaman . Jack of all trades , master of none.
---
 Average dps and heals.
---
Patch 1.5 battles could literally last days.  Winning felt like an epic achievement.  Patch 1.11 was max an hour if one side turtles.
---
me too... while blasting stormwind theme song
---
Thanks mate
---
Will these addons work tomorrow or will the creators need to update them for the release? It looks like these are from the beta.
---
ofc priest... or pally
---
I am so undecided. It’s getting more and more annoying. The more stuff I watch the more undecided I become. I’m at about 50% Shaman, 40% Hunter, 5% Druid, and 5% Warlock. The clock is ticking....
---
Who cares? Blame Blizzard for not giving us enough servers and real stats to make a better decision
---
Tx for your answer!
---
Look for Blam to hit high soon, probably Grob as well
---
i love how nobody apparently wants the new models but all these art works and videos using in game models are using the new models
---
Dammmnnn, sick bro
---
What would be a good money maker profession to go along with tailoring? :-)
---
Someone posted it here already. Here's the link:  [https://i.imgur.com/Lzrgp39.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Lzrgp39.jpg)
---
I used to pop divine intervention on team mates outside of orgrimmar just to watch people like you walk around in complete confusion for a solid 3 minutes.
---
Paladin is fantastic.
---
Good point. A lot of people who will be playing probably don't even go on reddit or the forums.
---
I put frozen broccoli in my morning shakes, it really does not taste bad.
---
Oh there's no if, they will be incredibly pricey. And realistically speaking, there's no way there will be enough for all the mages considering the drop rate.
---
So yep, just shop around the AH and see what's in your price range. Or hunt the databases to see if you can find something.
---
There was a reason Blizzard didn't want to release a RPPvP in the first place.
---
I’m sorry you uploaded the wrong picture.I don’t see any gnomes.
---
These are supposedly already set up for Classic, I have already downloaded them
---
Just heroic leap 4head
---
Shaman per chance?  I’m leaning towards shaman and it’s the once class I’m really considering Tauren over Orc. That Warstomp is just looking so juicy...
---
Very much, with lfg and lfr you can solo all content with no one in your friends list
---
This, but unironically
---
You could use that handy ctrl-f shortcut.  Idk, I've never seen the guide, maybe it's not setup well for the find function.
---
If you're the type of person that needs a guide to level then switching from Joana's to any other free guide will have little to no visible effect on the time it will take you to get to level 60.
---
It's a waste paying a subscription to Joana's guide. If you like him just go to Twitch and subscribe to his channel.
---
Same xD
---
The worst part will be some retail players not realizing druids don't have a normal rez and being mad when you don't rez them.
---
So lower armor in Classic is going to make warriors do less dps?
---
Wow is from 2006, not 1986!

Where'd you find that?

99.9% of NFL players do not come anywhere near the amount of cash that Andrew Luck made. He's made 100M dollars in his career.
---
That's also a 10 year old study that's going to be heavily skewed by bottom of the roster players making significantly less than regular starters.  There's definitely a culture of financial mismanagement in sports but players on Andrew Lucks level have to fuck up pretty bad to ruin themselves financially. Guys Like Adrian Peterson who reportedly is heavy in dept despite making a shit ton of money in his career aren't so much the norm.
---
Spoiler alert, they didn't. Trust me...
---
Not gonna re-read it, but I'm pretty sure he says to buy all the stocks to resell at a higher price.  Creating a monopoly of a certain good is going to fuck over everyone for his own benefit
---
Was it introduced before 1.12? Cause that's the version of the game we're getting.
---
I do to, it's just so awesome
---
Yup, it is :)
---
You need to change your flair
---
Deaths and Killing Blows, yea
---
Mess with Andy get slapped by Bolvars handy.
---
This is beautiful, I'm using it right now, thanks so much! &lt;3
---
Not just the bubble, but they are very mana efficient. Cleanse is ridiculously good as a defensive dispel, compared to purge which is offensive. Freedom is also a great tool. WotF gives you protection against two classes, paladins have the tools to help their allies counter everything.

god can the USA just ditch the D and stick with the S already /rant

It's the age-old "Hey, you don't annoy me by quietly reading a book in the corner, so why the fuck are you upset about me blasting ProgMetal at 120dB in the living room?! Stop ruining my enjoyment!"

Me and my wife are gonna be playing together on release day and streaming it. We arent any kinda big time streamers and shes never really played an MMO so it should be pretty interesting! Join us at twitch.tv/janky_gaming
---
Ohhh, maybe im mixing it up with powerade oops

Looks like a 30mm to me

Exactly, and I wouldn't have said anything if u didn't say the "best" experience. That's your opinion, but it isn't the best experience for everyone.

If you're playing anything but priest, lock or mage an autoswing timer is mandatory.

Pewpybut ?

It was never supposed to be added, so doubtful.

???

For sure just do your thing and explore the world. go at your own pace, especially if its the first time you've played. Play like you live in Azeroth.

&gt;When A PVE Player Plays On A PVP Realm
---
I think you misread this as "When a PVE player is PVP flagged on their PVE server."
---
You called it dude.
---
Just needs an active sub. There's a little option menu when you go to launch the game that lets you change the version to classic and it'll download.
---
Also you can pre-login as well. Keep that in mind, the character select menu will be up before the servers go live.
---
yea i thought about that, but wasn't quite sure where to put it in
---
he doesnt know what hes talking about
---
Nope.
---
LET ME INNNMNNNN

Merry Christmas to all and to all a good launch.
---
I'd drink her moonwell water.
---
Its two letter just not many people know about it
---
The soundtrack of whatever zone I'm in.
---
I would be cool if they let it drop once per server. But it’s best if they don’t. It would cause too much potential drama over it.
---
Hydraxian Waterlords represent! Drink it in! Hail Hydra!
---
I ask only because my limited understanding was that classic db pulls from blizzards database (insert technical terms) to get whats in live. Maybe thats incorrect
---
You can also just keep LOSing them when they charge to melee by running to different sides of whatever you were using to LOS them the first time
---
I believe battlegrounds won’t be added until phase 3, so you have time to level one up, then work on a second when phase 2 releases. Might help your decision.
---
Who are you talking to ?
---
What's the threshold? Most of my peers back in the day when we were 9-10 didn't know any English at all but we managed to master it through Runescape and WoW. It can be frustrating to not understand most things, but learning it with the images/models of a game at hand is really efficient.
---
Shut up you basketball eatin walrus lookin muhfucka.
---
Oh come on now be nice, she’s just using the original models.
---
Ah man, I have but I have an obsessive personality for stuff I enjoy. I haven’t touch WoW since wrath and I was a hardcore raider. 
---
I see how she’s worried I’d fall back into that play style but I just want to pvp and buy the occasional item from raiding guilds.
---
This is incredible, well done mate!
---
Yeah my nipples are getting harder too the closer we get to launch
---
There was an afk kicker in the stress tests. Not sure how blizzard is going to treat people who use programs to keep them "active" to prevent it.
---
I'm just gonna hop on one of the 10 new realms you will eventually add tomorrow
---
This is the one guys.
---
the developers already said that with few exception Like Dire Maul, Relics PVP Items, everything will be the 1.12 Drop Table.

Can I still get a res?

3 motnhs later: we had to merge 50% of servers.

During classic I would sell 6 slot bags on the AH for more than 5s (vendor price). A lot of people didn't know.

How far is the GY for alliance? I play horde and I can't Google it
---
The 5g respec cap worked very well as a custom change on Kronos. Maybe 10g would've been better, but even 5 was enough to deter me from respeccing more than twice a week.

Yeah, but just Starter Editions.

Is that gear in the bottom right really better than tier 3?

I'm having trouble getting GeForce to find it as a game. When I'm in classic and hit Alt f3 it says game not supported. It's looking in the wow folder but finding the separate retail and classic folders. Even when directing it to them, it still can't find them..

What I am saying is there as far as what blizzard have stated in various interviews the spawn rates of everything will be same as they where in vanilla ones layering is gone and the only solution they have suggested is longer cues. Sure blizzard can raise spawn rate and the amount of concurrent players but they have stated that they won't
---
It's going to be massively popular but I bet a lot of people will miss the changes and quality of life fixes in retail. Some people will realize they just don't enjoy it any more. I could even see some servers dropping to low population within a month. I think classic will still be popular enough to be profitable, and they'll continue until it isn't.
---
I had no idea it was that bad.  Played human for the first time on the stress test and I've never had it that hard so early.
---
Shit, all it has to do is be better than retail. 
---
And for most of the folks on this sub, that’s not an incredibly high bar.
---
i tried classicwows guide for the first 10 level, its total useless at server release. This guide actually says take this quest, finish it and do now the other quest but on release you take both quests and kill the mobs that are avaiable because there are a lot of players killing this mobs.

the cloth trade in starts with wool if i remember right and then you have to trade in the higher cloth till it ends on runecloth where you have the repeatable quest.

It heavily depends on your class (or rather availability of trainers and which skills are important) imo, if you need to go to org to train then I would very much recommend against heading there till at least your late teens/early twenties.

I think he made a “foot in the mouth” error.

Gonna be making a NE Druid. But my friends are playing humans. What level should I grind to be able to safely get to their area and level with them? Will I have a druid trainer there?

This made me pogchamp, thank you
---
I know everyone here is probably against this, but is there an addon that shows me Joana's Guide or something similar ingame? I've leveled from 1-60 countless times back in the day, and after the first time I always used Joana's Guide. It's just what Classic leveling is for me.
---
Hey thats my meme at the top

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyrKeThaEJM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyrKeThaEJM)
---
Same!
---
I think i hit 90 in roughly 20 hours. (the other warrior did it in 17.) I did get a consoloditation price: server first (and within 1 hour) I got exalted with order of the Cloud Serpent. Because of the egg spawn timer reset. I got enough eggs to get me to exalted. So I had that going for me.
---
Except this was an item that was never supposed to drop, it was just mistakenly left on the loot table. When one did drop, they quickly hotfixed it.
---
I mean Mage overall is just fun as hell. They have so much utility. If you're the kind of person who doesn't have TOO much time for classic, you can level pretty fast with a mage once you get past 20 and can AOE grind. You wont have too much trouble getting into groups cause mages are very useful and powerful.
---
I honestly don't know much about being a priest though other than they can be pretty powerful levelers once you get a wand. You also can go for that sweet sweet Benediction/Anathema and look cool as fuck
---
I thought I did, but he was right, I actually don't anymore. But beating content I literally beat all of 15 years ago with today's "gamers" just doesn't interest me. About 2 weeks ago, it hit me like a brick, "I don't want to play this all over again." These days I need surprises in my games, and because I've literally done EVERYTHING there is to do in vanilla, I won't ever be surprised. So yea, no go, I might watch a vanilla dev play it on his stream, that'll be a trip, but that's about it.
---
Anyone else?
---
Take an upvote.
---
Resto druids do not have a normal revive, only 1 battle res on a 10 minute cooldown that requires a reagent to cast.
---
Id go for mage with that selection. Top tier in all forms of PvP, top tier pve, good grinding and solo/farming

Shadowpriest melt faces in PvP

jokes on you im still addicted ://

Tailoring is top tier mage prof as azure robes are BIS for PvE early on.

Well that'll be fun for sure

Hey man! Absolutely stunning work! And might I say, I am so glad to join you in this journey to 60 as a dwarf priest. I had my calling when my wife bought [my a booster pack of MTG cards and in the middle rested this magnificent creature, solidifying my destiny!](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bxnoeh/ive_been_stuck_trying_to_choose_between_priest) Before that I was torn between a dwarf warrior tank and a dwarf priest healer, but I eventually decided to main the priest and alt the warrior but still going to level them relatively close together, [using this cool concept I came up with](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cuo227/z/exww288) that originally started in WotLK but I'm fine tuning it for Classic.

Just can't wait man, if you're on Whitemane, I hope one day we run into eachother. Cheers!

Personal preference really. People who say Undead is better in PvE are telling tales though. One 3 min dps cooldown that can be used in all fights &gt; one defensive cooldown that's used in very few fights.
---
And my point is there difference is indistinguishable when it's done in a public internet setting. It emboldens actual racists and dredges up a bunch of painful shit for people that have to deal with racism on a day to day basis. There have been multiple mass shootings this past year alone where the shooter had an extremely bigoted and xenophobic manifesto as well as regularly visiting a chan website.
---
Even if they aren't racist, they're either uninformed and/or just plain assholes.
---
Some bosses do fear I believe so WotF has PVE use even. Though it is GREAT for PvP, I too rolled undead. Let's eat them corpses!
---
Wrath was the superior expansion. Game went downhill after that.
---
No you don't, I haven't been subbed in over 6 months and I reinstalled b.net client yesterday and was able to preload 4.5 GB. When I got into the Character Creation it stopped me and said I needed an active subscription!
---
Blizzard made a blue post saying they are making this addon against the TOS and the functionality of classic. It won’t make it in the live game long.
---
Somebody told me there‘s no durability loss when a player kills you.
---
I don't know why but I just don't like this guy.
---
Ugh
---
Anyone interested in using this to plan out something for Darnassus Rep to 40?
---
I did it more for lore reasons honestly.
---
How is that an answer
---
This is interesting, the problem is I have never tanked. I’ve always stuck to dps, same with healing I haven’t done that either.
---
I tanked Deadmines during the stress test. Couldn't pull from range because I forgot to buy bullets. A+ experience.
---
Just right click the truck in front of you and follow. This way you can play WoW without even parking.
---
Where can I search for guilds to join? I saw a post last week but can’t find it now.
---
Sweet thanks! What secondary profession is good?
---
I wanted to start with Herbalism + Alchemy on my main. 
---
But should I maybe do Herbalism + Skinning to start so I can make a bit of extra silver?
---
Well soon that addon will be dead ..  like in a week or 2
---
WoW1 is your acount name. Your server name is written above your character on character login screen.

This is awesome ❤️
---
If they are, I haven't seen it listed yet. It would definitely be great to see a little equity in repair costs, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
Quiet Thomas! We aren't to even speak of that sword!
---
I guess it's "nochanges" for blizzard to underestimate the size of vanilla's launch. they grossly underestimated it back in the day as well
---
Butt paste works really well. I had to use it once and I already knew it worked well because I have kids. I don't know about the diaper thing specifically though, I have no intention of using one again and if I get that old I'll probably kill myself.
---
It’s far better to play classic as a new WoW player then the current, I wish I could start over again. Just remember take your time there’s no rush! Don’t be afraid to ask others for help or questions to, there’s a whole new world for you out there! Good luck :D
---
I’m thinking of running straight to storm wind instead of fight I g with for quest. Do Stormwind quests then get flying, go to iron forge
---
Im relying on my northdale experience, horde side. I was honored i think maybe revered, every item at the quartermaster at that point was sold for gold and the mount wasn't even on the list. Totell the truth i do not know how accurate was it compared to actual classic. Played it, don't remember.
---
Anyone else sing the whole thing?
---
i should probably get some sleep
---
Everyone should use ClassicLFG. It’s a great little addon.
---
How can you use reddit, but never heard of baby power? Or how it's great for rashes and preventing them....
---
Wow these comments, lol, it’s like all the fattest people pretend to eat the best and exercise most. Enjoy your food, buying fun stuff for WoW launches is part of the joy at my house too... and bith of us are over 35 and fit.

As the roll priority suggests... Need for need, greed for greed.
---
Care to explain why you regretted warlock?
---
Heya, friend.  Thanks for the reply, and I'm sorry I didn't see it to reply in turn sooner.  I got distracted while doing some research and planning related to this, and wound up deciding I'll be happy with any of the following weapons:
---
Dreadforge Retaliator (like you suggested)/ The Blackrock Slicer/ Blackhand Doomsaw/ Slavedriver's Cane/ Malown's Slam/ Seeping Willow; all six options are good and come from different bosses (although the Slicer comes from a rare, not a boss.)
---
Thanks for the help, I sincerely appreciate it.
---
no :\]
---
Omg hahaha! This is the best thing I've seen all week. Freakin' beautiful!
---
It does, theres tests on youtube. Its the same as a Overtime HOT I think
---
Warrior mage are top 2: followed by priests and rogues.
---
Yes it is.
---
I remember blinking too early, hitting the ground, blinking up again and hitting the ground a second time. Great way to die
---
I'd say selling iron bars to engineers for iron grenades is a consistent income flow as well.
---
That and thistle tea lol
---
Ohh ok. Well I hope you get it!
---
However, the other 50% are still unable to merge layers.  Blizzard releases a statement claiming that phase 2 will be delayed indefinitely.
---
Thats some scary AI shizzl.
---
the debuff limit is whats stopping you. That and yes, they deal minimal dps. The biggest dps specs boost your shadow damage, not your fire damage.
---
I fucking love these. 
---
If you ever wanted to draw a pink mohawk’d troll shaman healing a black Tauren... you’d be my hero 😏
---
If you’re fine with less optimal pve builds, and have Blackout, Troll is better.
---
Hey thanks for video!
---
Baby powder can work but butt paste is honestly much better. Both in the same section of the baby stuff though.
---
 OMG BONCY?!?  Raa!! \*tea\*
---
Oh
---
My
---
God..
---
Rerererereeeeepost
---
No doubt you'll make more money with skinning. I'll be herb+alch right off the bat myself so that pots and elixirs smooth up my leveling.
---
That‘s gonna be me. I‘m probably not gonna get into a raiding guild, but there‘s other stuff you can do.
---
The only real answer is gnome for the +int.
---
Sunday.
---
Where is the night elf from?
---
Trolls are cooler/rarer. 
---
Undead wotf is a game changer in pvp and semi useful in pve.
---
I’d vote female trol mage. They’re kinda sexy.
---
Thanks you are very kind. I'm a fairly experienced hunter player and not even rolling hunter as a main this time, (maybe an alt later) i was just trying to point out, that maybe a friendlier, more helpful tone towards newbie hunters, who chose the class based on the very suggestions they recieved online, would probably reduce the number of Huntard bad type of posts.
---
And warriors have corpse run!
---
so that’s how time zones work
---
Alliance sux ass
---
For the Horde!
---
11 hours after this post there are only 2 medium servers lol
---
Orc and troll racials are pretty close for hunters in pve so do whatever you like better. I’m going troll since blood fury is only for melee.
---
I would suggest learning how the timing works with hunter shots and how to kite properly if you don’t know already
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
I have 10 days off starting launch. I've worked/ am working 60 hours this wed-sun. I'm legitimately thankful to be working, better than sitting around feeling no purpose prior to launch. Helps pass the time.
---
i dont care about the looks that much ofc  t3 looks cool but if you choose to play fury you know what you can expect
---
Well, I always like to play a tank/supporty role in games so maybe I’ll pick something like a Priest, Mage or perhaps Paladin? Are they any better in terms of leveling than a Warrior lol
---
That's kinda what I mean though. Those are fun classes that smooth over the worst aspects of vanilla for a casual player.
---
Hey OP, I just recently went through name reservation process on a new server here in the United States. You log in before the servers open, and sit on the realm list. You will see the new servers, but they will be greyed out. When the time hits, they may not actually come on until a few minutes (3 minutes after for me). When they do come online, you will see the servers go from offline to low. At that point you can go on your desired server and create a character. You do not need to log out and back in for it to refresh. The changes in server status are live and do not require a refresh. Hope this helps!
---
Frostitute is my fave
---
I found it boring - it's a very good class for pvp though but in pve you're always expected to summon people to dungeon entrances (think being a mage is bad? times it by a million) the list goes on and on... if you like that sort of thing then definitely play it, and again, you will probably win every 1v1 duel... I just can't go through it again lol.
---
I'm okay with this.
---
Because I've never been using or have bought diapers before.
---
No queues for you then
---
So because other people don’t have free time, they can’t conceive of anyone else having free time.
---
Pretty sure you’ve got this backwards.  Worth pointing out that he’s addressing people who say “people don’t have time for classic any more”, not “I don’t have time to play classic.”
---
Mages as well. And probably warlocks too. Thankfully there won't be many priests and mages. Oh wait...
---
doesn't the book only unlock 150-225 and you got the do the quest with nat pagle with the 225 skill where you have to catch 4 rare fish
---

Disturbed. Nonpoint. Linkin Park. P.O.D. Puddle of Mud etc

*incoming hate*
---
The whole sub is devolving into a circle jerk lmao don’t waste your time.
---
No MS paint low effort swirlies for the maelstrom around the WoW icon?
---
8/10 still pretty cool.
---
How do pug raids work? Is it just need over greed? Is it master loot? If so, am I supposed to trust that some random dude is not gonna just give his friends the gear that drops?
---
Don't listen to any of these people. Stay as far away as humanly possible. Once you've had a taste for this game you won't ever be able to leave. Run while you still can
---
Always played horde but I have been considering Alliance for classic
---
strongdong
---
2 sleeps. One just before classic
---
Mages have a similar problem. It happens a lot but not enough to play a different class. You'll be fine.
---
I don't think it is, because mages have no healing so its nice to use your cloth for bandages. You should also be leveling quicker than any gear you make is really worth wearing - and nobody will be buying anything you make on the auction house.
---
To be fair Druids do kinda suck as healers for 5mans
---
Hey the one guy with the torch tanked a bunch of hits from Legolas.
---
Do you want to heal or dps  or have the option to tank or dps end game? Do you want your end game gear help you kill things faster or heal others better?
---
Too high effort for this sub tbh
---
Some of them unironically are

It is.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans
---
**Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans**
---
Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans was a graphic adventure game under development by Blizzard Entertainment and Animation Magic from 1996 until its cancellation in 1998. Set in the Warcraft universe after the events of Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal, it followed the orc character Thrall in his quest to reunite his race, then living on reservations and in slavery following its defeat by the human Alliance. Assuming the role of Thrall, the player would have used a point-and-click interface to explore the world, solve puzzles and interact with characters from the wider Warcraft series.
---
Warcraft Adventures was conceived in late 1996, when Blizzard's sister company Capitol Multimedia suggested that the Warcraft license might be suited to an adventure game.

It rarely does without wow

Like my comment says two words after you stopped your copy and paste snippet, he said it when he was on the countdown to classic podcast. He didn't say his guides would be completely free forever but nobody expects anyone to ever say something like that. He said something to the effect of yes his guides are completely free with a small portion being paid for members only. He never once mentioned on the podcasts that he was going to charge and inferred the opposite actually. I am not the only one that took it that way. Then literally days later he makes it paid only. Just a dumb move honestly. He's going to get far fewer dollars that way than keeping it free and selling adds for the thousands that will be returning to visit his site for the first few months, if it were to remain free. Like I said I don't care the market has spoken and there are better free options so I'll just move on. It's just annoying he did it that way and seemed like a really stupid move in terms of money. Bad pr isn't good in that line of business.
---
Anyone have the MoveAnything addon? I found versions for retail and 1.12 but I haven't been able to find one for the classic client. Will the retail version work?
---
Mostly healthy stuffs apples, bananas, granola, trail mix, bottles water, black coffee pre making some chicken and veggies tonight to have some meals prepped but I also grabbed a couple of junk food items as well, like a cube of soda, some pop tarts and cookies, and a big bottle of beer for when I hit 60
---
It's time boys
---
They’re all going faerlina
---
Im well aware mate, but this trinket is simply not that good, the 30s wait timer after equipping it you can just regenerate the 600~ mana VW costs to summon. I suppose it could be useful if you are in some remote area without access to soulshards. Staff on the other hand is probably the best your gonna get outside of raids.
---
What a brilliant idea.
---
I'm not gonna believe it wow
---
Monday at 3PM PDT
---
I wish blizzard would just admit its because the Chinese government doesn't like seeing human remains and be done with it. Tired of being lied to.
---
Seaech for polls in r/classicwow. There are more than enough data for you to examine.
---
Undead casting animations are the best
---
Cool! Excited to see the mobile friendly version!
---
Yeah https://www.avoidstreamers.com/
---
Oh man, you don't look so good, maybe you should call in sick

All these night before posts get people to go fucking nuts. It's the same shit every time. This is basically a repost of the last 50 times.

www.avoidstreamers.com

Every time I look it up it says the 27th was it changed or something?
---
Unless you are real life buddies with this forums stupid mods, it’s low effort. Lmao.
---
Alright well, I didn't need an active sub when I did it yesterday (preload the 4.5 GB).
---
I tend to set my hearth to the area I quest in, and I would rather journey back through the zone than to allow some filthy undead the nourishment from canalizing my corpse. /spit
---
 /facepalm 
---
Its an orc and human. Its not like its the lich king or illidan or a panda.
---
&gt; I’ll be earning gold by tanking dungeons at 60
---
Do you mean running those instances will naturally make you some gold, or are you referring to charging for your tanking services?
---
I ask because that was definitely a thing for PUGs on pservers, and I'm hoping that doesn't translate to Classic.
---
And dungeons and raids.
---
Leatherworker I suppose. Making those two BiS devilsaur items.

OP would you mind someone animating it for wallpaper engine I'd fucking love it with the torches and those slight ambient effects on the portal, picture looks fucking amazing anyway man ty

Meanwhile in retail, as the groups dropping into water: death knight /cast Path of Frost

My wife and I cant decide on what to roll as. Mainly PVE/Dungeons + BG. NE because she prefers the look and I like shadow meld for BG (rip rep gains). She prefers range Healing/DPS while I prefer tank/DPS.  
---
Likely choice: **Warrior** \+ **Priest** (Shadow) - We know Dwarf is "better"  
---
Runner up: **Warrior** \+ **Druid** (Resto) - I feel like this combo isn't really mentioned anywhere, obviously feral would counter, thoughts?
---
Okay people on reddit reply way to fast, i did not expect this. Thank you.
---
I used to make decent money disenchanting greens I craft. I think that really depends on the economy though.
---
Docken, Canbeast
---
I know this isn't what you're asking for, but I've seen more and more people talking about the "hamstring" method and it's driving me crazy.
---
I don't mean to overwhelm you with conflicting information, but I'll just let [this video](https://youtu.be/LDTE2o79lgg) speak for itself.
---
 As for a swing timer add-on, I don't know off hand.
---
I disagree. People who run back and get lost or pull pats are the worst.
---
I always ask people to wait for rez to avoid this kind of idiocy.
---
Well for better or worse I got a shift then so I might just lose the worst hours of the launch.
---
*Tériblé
---
That makes me super happy! Those classes don't make sense to me having them available on the opposite faction.
---
My alt is a Female Troll Mage. There is a great Dueling spec that is fire/frost that really goes online with Mind Quickening Gem and Berserking
---
3pm PST tommorow !  30 mins from now tommorow character creation limits are removed , new servers unlock and then 5 hours after that CLASSIC LAUNCH wooooooooo
---
Yeah and then they pull the entire fucking pirate ship even though I said "hold on let me wait to pull groups individually so we can go through this quick."  
---
I swear it will never not happen at some point.
---
No, but I would like to read them!  \*goes off to track them down\*
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you cant even play until 5pm EST.
---
Copy and save the url..... Or just take ten seconds to put in your class race and level and then you are back where you were. What do you expect out of a free resource? For it to level for you?
---
This is reddit, people are going to post whether they have anything useful to say or not
---
Is there a thread up rn I can use for guild recruitment, or can I create a post specifically for this? Didn't see a rule against it but I don't want to do the wrong thing. Thanks!
---
What do you think of taking Ratchet fly path at lvl 1 in durotar ? Is it worth it ?
---
Probably but on EU it is out of the bag.
---
9 out of the 14 US servers are full currently. It's exciting to see.
---
They should add an option for it just saying
---
I rolled with a friend on a pserver and he played druid. It's astonishing the number of people that didn't know that druid didn't have other ress other than combat ress. They kept their corpses unreleased for minutes and going afk, and then coming back and asking for an explanation of why he didn't ress lol
---
Is this true for kids too? I have 2 more than I had when wow came out. Looking for any help
---
Can a bank alt with level 1 enchanting disenchant everything, or can they only DE low level stuff?
---
~~No of course not.~~ Yes.
---
Find a friendly nurse to hook you up with a catheter instead, diapers are for amateurs.

I love it! Right back at ya....
---
'Twas the night before Classic, when all through the house  
---
Not a keyboard was clicking, not even a mouse;  
---
The vacation requests were all submitted with care,  
---
In hopes that extra leveling time soon would be there;  
---
The players were nestled all snug in their beds;  
---
While visions of epics danced in their heads;  
---
And ma in her parachute cloak, and I in my mind control cap,  
---
Had just settled ourselves for our pre-grinding nap,  
---
Then on launch, in the Barrens, there arose such a clatter,  
---
I sprang from my Zhevra Hooves quest to see what was the matter.  
---
When what to my Chuck Norris-joking eyes did appear,  
---
But a miniature dwarf rogue decked out in 2 Tier!  
---
With my worthless gray staff so lively and quick,  
---
I knew in a moment he must be some griefing alliance prick!  
---
He had a broad face and a little round belly  
---
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.  
---
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,  
---
Then killed the flight master and left me stranded like a jerk!  
---
So I had to run to Ratchet to get fak the out of there  
---
And then I found myself over Mulgore pissed off mid-air.  
---
As I flew over Crossraods I read his nasty red text yell   
---
Using a WoW Translator like a message from hell;  
---
"G o T o RE T a IL" he said with his words in plain sight—
---
Anyway...
---
Happy World of Warcraft Classic to all, and to all some great fights!
---
Healing is viable, with updated healing gear. It's gonna be a mouthful, but viable non the less.
---
&gt;He never once mentioned on the podcasts that he was going to charge 
---
Right, because as his website has said the entire time, he didn't know how he would monetize this. It has said this under his members section the entire time.
---
&gt;and inferred the opposite actually
---
Inferred? So never outright directly said as you and everyone else are claiming?
---
https://youtu.be/u8ohTJp3PAA?t=71

They're clearly not reacting like they did in GotG. The infinity gauntlet seems to be protecting him.
---
I'm taking my crystal ball back to walmart.
---
Ots a point and click warcraft game that i forget the name of
---
You are right my bad I was looking at my notes wrong. Get you up to 225 then the quest at level 35 minimum skill of 225 with Nat Pagle in Dustwallow Marsh
---
Got a group of 25 people rolling together, only class we are overloaded on is rogue.  
---
Anecdotal, but thats the way I remember rogue.  Not an issue if you are competitive and faster to level/farm more at max level.
---
You used to be able to cast sentry totem to negate fall damage as a shaman. Not sure if it’ll be in Classic.
---
Please do! I’d love this too
---
Page not found :(
---
Just looked it up, I think it only comes out on the 26th for NA and SA
---
Main issue with Grob for me is that it is PST.
---
With there being more EST players, I think it would have hit High or Full faster if it was EST.
---
6pm est Monday. Timezones change release times
---
Ooh I like that
---
Windserpents are great, especially for farming with their ranged attacks. Pop it in agressive and let it go ham!
---
Dragon leather is probably the only crafting profession worth considering pre 60 IMO. mail is super rare after 40, and half of it is shaman gear - so it really is quite niche and you might wind up wearing a lot of crafted gear while leveling.
---
Nah thats a point and click warcraft game from like, the 90s or early 2000s that i forget the name of
---
Where'd you get those numbers?
---
26th for the Americas, 27th for EU (timezones and such, I believe they all launch at the same datetime UTC)
---
Nah man. Icc was fantastic. 3d sarth was good. Zul aman...heroic 5 mans had their moments too.
---
Vault of arch was decent. Dumb down max was fun if anything else. And of course Ulduar.
---
All class spec became super viable. Hell, dps bear was a thing.
---
Wrath was amazing.
---
I am stuck on which class to play still... I was going to go with Horde Mage, but it seems like there is a large amount of people going to go mage. I don't want to play an over saturated class. Was considering rolling Warlock to get the same mage feel. Just really confused, anyone got some good insight?
---
Hell yeah!!! On my same server??
---
They can drink potions with a macro in the new API. I’m fact, they get a boost to potion consumption since they drink in humanoid form and shift to animal form.
---
Use adderal like a proper adult bro. Vivance will also do the trick.
---
Engineering is all that matters. Second choice is preference
---
I remember Savory Deviate Delights sold well. Are there other fish that can make you some $$?
---
I WAS ONCE A HUMAN LIKE YOU, BUT YOU SHOW YOUR TRUE COLORS AS THE SCUMS YOU ARE! FOR THE HORDE, AS I EAT YOUR CORPSE.
---
Hahahaha! That's even worse than mine!! That was nice of you to explain things
---
It would be better to add new Spanish realms or nordic
---
You’re not missing much tbf.
---
Me a warlock : Ah, they are powerful and hit 1/3 of my health bar but my voidwalker will manage them !
---
Voidwalker : Aggro 3 more mage as he reach the defias
---
Me : Man, fuck moonbrook \*get killed\*
---
Please do undead.. That's awesome man well done
---
Might be a little rough at first since other DPS classes can do MC with a lot worse gear. But it shouldn't be a big deal once your guild has MC and Ony on farm.
---
Actually, it looks like you read it, but didn't understand it.

Fishing is “easy” in the sense that if you just get 5 skill ups per level, you’re at 300 by 60. Same as any profession but it just seems more doable for fishing. “Oh I’ll just fish this little pond, and hey look, there’s 5 points.”
---
Op is actually completely correct.
---
It gives a pretty nice statistic for how the game balance will look 3 months after launch tho.
---
The people on reddit answering polls are most likely the ones that will stick around til 60.
---
If you never check reddit/youtube and sub same days as classic odds are you will quit sooner.
---
I read it, reword your posts next time and we wouldn’t assume you’re just dumb lol.
---
Appreciate the response. Would playing a Priest or Paladin, be any easier for a beginner than doing a Warrior? I’ve always played tanks/supporty roles, that’s why I ask. I’m considering maybe a Mage just to maybe mix things up. Sorry for probably throwing questions that you may not be answerable in a few sentences, I feel a bit overwhelmed at the prospect of classic. It’s not so much the grind I’m worried about but rather the sheer amount of game knowledge, feels like information overload.
---
Fellas don’t get me hyped!.!. 🔥🔥🔥
---
Lol it really is. I was going to play rogue, because I know the leveling of a warrior will be aids, but fuck it, the rewards will be great.
---
(-:
---
1:I think yes, if I remember correctly
---
2: nope doesn't work
---
3: no idea
---
Could someone recommend a reliable source of information on all the announced servers? Mostly around population levels and balance?
---
I know guilds have 'claimed' to play on some servers, so I'm sure we can get an inkling on which servers will be more/less dominated by a given faction?
---
Yeah some ppl helping him on disc definitely offsets hundreds of hours of his own work.
---
Ok
---
Too bad site wasn’t built using a static site generator
---
Not much armor class on that breastplate.
---
"Some of you guys are alright. 
---
Dont log into the servers tomorrow"
---
Maybe Asmon/Soda. I know Esfand/Tips have been backing Joanas decision pretty hard.
---
warlock gets groups more easily especially ally
---
If you're an exceptional player, play mage. Average or below average player should will have more fun on hunter imo.
---

Nothing is more annoying than ranged not killing the tower archers that are wrecking you while the tank is taking out the LTs before drek/vann.
---
HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!  Healing causes aggro people!!!
---
Very nice piece of art. I'd love to be able to draw like that. When I was a kid I loved to draw but for some reaaon I stopped. I wouldn't even know where to start.
---
Yes, its a cool journey though.
---
Yerp. The game was never really about the difficulty. Its 100% the community you interact with anyway. I cant wait
---
there are a few fights where you can get feared so yeah it would be useful. also if your playing on a pvp server then its a nice to have while out in the world
---
Armored warrior/pala failling to pick up flower. Like what, you were hrut by the THRONS ?!
---
Not off the top of my head - then the zeppelin ride awaits!
---
I hadn't heard of winters chill mage,  but I never got to mage in vanilla through wotlk. Thanks for giving us a decent list.
---
Well this is a break from convention in which usually they refer to US PST. I'm surprised, also, that they are launching the game the night before server maintenance that occurs on Tuesday mornings (US).
---
maybe if you could think a bit more critically. i should expect this from people in this sub by now..
---
Hell ya brother!
---
Beautiful. Thanks so much!
---
And the meeting stones are still functional, no need for an addon.
---
Yes getting there is always a journey, since no flight point is up there and you need to pass by undercity. Getting killed by horde on the way is likely. Just have to die your way through if nothing helps.
---
That seems to be the prevailing theory
---
Ive always played Alliance but missed vanilla.
---
I'll either play a Paladin to experience vanilla on my pala or I'm leaning more towards Horde so I get a full experience of not having done any of the quests before, probably Shaman as I like healing end game with a dps spec for PvP if I want to mix it up.
---
I’ll add both of you. I won’t be able to play till like 8pm est because of work but lets be friends on bnet and play. I’m a new player to mmos aswell. So this is going to be an amazing experience.
---
No, you cannot change (or select) the account name. It’s default, now.
---
Never been too big of a deal.
---
At real launch people were playing for fun. Now people are playing for fake internet points just to say they were the world "first" at whatever. I'm sure many will avoid PVP to speed level.

---
For the horde! Lets do this bro.
---
In my experience etiquette changed over time.  High value BoEs in early vanilla people expected you to equip, but I think people started to realize they were often worth more in gold then to that character.  By the end of vanilla the etiquette at least on my server, was that everyone rolls need on something that was of excessive value.  The only caveat here was if someone greeded first, you need to be a nice guy and let them /roll at it if you won with the need roll.  
---
In raid they would be master looted to a guild bank.

FOR. THE. HORDEEEEEEEEE.
---
im not exceptional by any means
---
I love hybrids and shaman are my favorite class. I'm really looking forward to shaman tanking which was removed as an option when I started WoW (BC).
---
Make the mage with the intention of a rogue alt at 60. You can fund some better weapons, potions, first aid cloth, etc to make the grind easier IMO
---
rough math, not including rp servers (or asia for that matter) i think there are 25 pvp and pve server altogether listed.
---
Been told that even a medium pop server would hold more than the busiest server in vanilla (which was something like 3.5k) most of the ones here are high to full so 15k+ per server is a good guess, so around 375k just in name reservations.
---
There are going to be as many or more that are just waiting until it launches before subbing to play, coupled with the streams and any advertising.
---
Shitty
---
It did for original name reservation, someone else confirmed that's not longer the case.
---
I've always used Zygor personally.
---
Best of luck and I hope you have fun bro!
---
great digital tracing!
---
Don't forget to set up the poop bucket
---
the logic for this speed up is "it is needed to keep the time to reach max level the same as before" when the real fix that feels awful for the game designer is to remove some old content as part of the stuff you do while leveling. FF14 gets that they are currently working on removing stuff from the main quest line inorder to speed it up rather than just making it trivially easy.
---
when it comes to leveling less is more a limited choise in quests and what % of all quests you need to do means you are more likly to find people to group up in part since they are there and in part since you don't feel like doing a quest or zone since you don't like it you will want to group up to get it done.
---
Traitor!
---
Guess the tour's over for them.
---
At the same time as others. Our planet has timezones.
---
agreed.  The only way around this is to take note of every singular/collective's preference on type of inclusion and list them all, first sorted alphabetically, then reversed, then randomized.
---
because it is tomorrow.. it is technically launching tomorrow even for those of us who lives where the game will release at midnight, because if you stay up to play the game at launch then it's tomorrow night.. you get it now?

Ugh, stop it with the nostalgia bs. The game is good, even without nostalgia.

If you like having many people around you should go pvp server. The server will feel much more alive~!

RareAware is one that shows rare spawns on your map.
---
My name was nude and them made me to change it... its not even a bad word
---
What are you basing this off of? If you're basing it off of private server populations, you are ignoring the players, like myself, that did not actively play on them because they were not permanent like the official Blizzard ones will be. I played private for awhile and loved every second of it, I only stopped when I realized that my character could be wiped at any moment due to greed and drama that plagues private severs. I am CONFIDENT that there are many others like me and there will be multiple full servers in the coming months.

Spirit was called wisdom in vanilla
---
Dude your dwarf is literally my dwarf haha!
---
Make sure you get the 2 pigtails/braids, they flap around wildly while casting and it's hilarious.
---
Welp, not really sure what I’m looking at but here’s your downvote.
---
No slow fall?
---
There seems to be a huge population of priests this time around....giving me some last minute cold feet.
---
And some people were jumpin' and screamin' that noone will buy subscription. Well what those fools have to say now?
---
Energy shots aren't energy drinks so why would somebody who truly wants energy drinks drink something completely different?
---
I was wondering myself if there was anyway for me to download the classic client for Mac 
---
I’m not seeing the ‘free download’ on the blizzard.net app
---
Skeram is now a high server
---
Whoever gets it signed first, gets the name.
---
You can change the name on the charter anytime before handing it in.
---
Ew.
---
Yeah you are trying to fill in the blanks with the basic things they have said, but they never said they anything about the size of the final layer in phase 2.
---
They have never been asked directly about size and responded with actual numbers, they are choosing to answer vaguely so when they do something retarded they have an out.
---
Anyone know where I can find a 3D portraits addon?
---
Thanks!  Now go DIAF!
---
Priests are very nice to level. They have plenty of self sustain since they can heal themselves, and you can be very mana efficient by getting a wand as soon as possible and relying on that along with Shadow Word: Pain to deal most of your damage. Plus, since you can heal it will be much easier to group up. If you went horde, I would suggest playing shaman, because they have lots of sustain similar to priests, and they are also highly sought after for the utilities that their totem spells bring to groups.
---
The correct answer
---
All but four American servers are now full, two of which are high.  I'm hoping that's enough data for them.
---
The pro tips! Ty
---
Can I play
---
Yeah, I think I’m gonna get a g600 and have it ready for when the naga dies
---
Depends on the class. I think every class gets new ranks of a few abilities when AQ is released. Then there are special cases, like Mage tomes and the Ferocious Bite book from The Beast in UBRS.
---
Vultures in westfall drop them
---
Yes you can download the client with or without a subscription.  Can't log in at the portal screen without a sub tho.
---
I'm not here to budget for retirement!
---
do people with gathermate and gatherlite share node info?
---
There is no reason for Alchemy while leveling afaik, so it makes sense to have a 2nd gathering profession. Skinning makes a lot of Sense for the earlier levels, especially as you can only Track Herb OR Mining on your Minimap at once.
---
actually i dont think. good pvp players can easily outplay people, you would know this if you ever watched high end pvp in vanilla, but i bet you just watched videos like "unbreakable" and think enchancement own in vanilla. also rogues arent as op in 1.12.
---
It’s hard to argue, seeing as you’re the authority on being butthurt, after all your feelies are hurt by non-persistent skeletons in a re-release of a 15 year old game,

Graham on Mankrik
---
Run back PLEASE. I see this a lot in retail players (strangely enough). Shit, sometimes it's a good idea to run back mid fight to save your healer the time and mana.
---
**MASSIVE EXAGGERATION ALERT**
---
Me too.
---
They changed it in cata, hunters got focus instead of mana and they didnt have melee weapons so they could shoot in melee range, although you still had to stand still for aimed shot for some time (theyve changed it a few times)
---
5pm Central
---
This is awesome!
---
Is it worth watching if you haven't really seen any movie besides the original iron man and the first avengers? I assume I should watch all these super hero movies first? Is there a set order? Might be a good time sink on a second monitor as I level up.
---
i dont like tryhard attitudes and approve any class half viable (put a moonkin in with the casters, give us our 1 shadow priest, etc) but the meters showed ret so fucking low on the meters every single time.
---
I think it depends on what you want to achieve. Alch will give you a little bump in utility, but if you're speed leveling then you'll likely outpace your alch skill and not use it at higher levels. Gold shouldn't be too much of an issue so long as you're not buying items off the Ah
---
Druid. tank. Lol XD
---
If they can’t find the right time from an official source then I say let them log in on Tuesday. Keeps them out of the way on Monday.

[My battlestation...](https://imgur.com/a/Mq3YyrD)
---
I have the exact same issue. I’m stuck between Warlock and Mage for PvE. 
---
If I were to choose between Rogue and Warlock I’d definitely go Warlock. Once you hit BWL your power escalates. In AQ40/Naxx you’ll have the opportunity to become a powerhouse. Your solo-farm capabilities are strong, your utility is required, your tier set is shared among fewer people.
---
You can buy 30 or 60 day game card from instant-gaming.com
---
Get the code and send it to your friends
---
What a great answer.
---
I won't be able to play at launch, if I'm not racing other players but only the clock, is it worth it ? :p
---
My group is playing on Mankrik haha so we won’t see each other! The name is graham though
---
I played pala on priv. Servers during 2013-2015 almost, and you do not worry about ccing unless you're pvping. You have garbage CC compared to every class except for warrs, and you should rather focus on keeping teammates alive by healing no matter the spec. 
---
You have CC, but it's only 6s every min. You shouldn't have repentance if you want to do anything other than leveling and casual pvp and dungeons
---
Jokes on you I will make bags too
---
Zach Morris is trash.
---
I’ve heard it’s only the monthly subscription cost. So for 1 month at a time - $14.99/mo.
---
Oh yea. People will re-roll a new class or a new server all the time. People will convince their friends to come back, people will see clips and cave and come back. It’ll be fine.
---
tell me your name.
---
My Main will be a Tailor / Enchanter and the rest will be either herbalist or  mining paired with skinner.  Also, have a couple of bank characters that are just storage.
---
I was like "hmm... i doubt it'll be as good but i'll give it a try and see" then i played the beta and IT WAS THE MOST GODDAMN FUN I'VE HAD IN AN MMO IN LIKE A FUCKING DECADE! It was just so goooooood! Even without the nostalgia stuff, i just love the people and way the game naturally encourages jolly co-operation and the random interactions you have on the way to or from dungeons and with world pvp and just ... all of it! 
---
As a hunter a big part of pets was going around and finding pets with skills you wanted, then taming them and fighting with them for a while til you learned the skill from them, then you'd go teach it to your "main" pet who was loyalty level 6 (B.F.F.s) and make it stronger, plus you could get certain classes of beast that could learn multiple focus dumps (bite and claw for example) if you wanted so did great burst. 
---
Idk man the world just felt big and scary and alive and dangerous and venturing into that dark ominous looking forest over there was terrifying because who knew what lurked inside? 
---
I was honestly so sceptical about classic until i actually got my hands on the beta and played it and was just like "okay fuck, yeah it's still actually just so much better than live and i'm completely in love still".
---
In the US it’s the 26th that’s why, 5pm CST on Monday for example
---
" Screw this scrub healer. How to i vote to kick in this?!"
---
Thanks bud
---
Do you take commissions? Id love the same style for an Undead Priest (female of course)
---
Rolled a UD mage on Skeram, really appreciate all the work you and Defcamp have done for the classic community, Melderon. Hit me up anytime for water/food. Name is Dreine, hope to see you guys around as we go back home.
---
You should put your TL;DR disclaimer at the beginning. 
---
Without possibility to check my spreadsheet right now you might have a few items of 1.10 in your list but pallys can Farm epic tank Items while healing MC.
---
I think MP/5 is one of your best stats for lesser downtime.
---
My ranking would be:
---
Stamina&gt;mp/5&gt;intellect&gt;spellpower&gt;strength=Agility
---
Of course you try to get block&gt;parry&gt;Defense&gt;avoid if possible.
---
As paladin you should play around a little. Deathbone Set is easy BiS but rng makes it hard to get sometimes.
---
Enjoy. I know I feel blessed that I have about ten days free after launch. Gonna be a rush
---
Got the newest drivers, I didn't have retail fully installed yet though. You place the whole classic folder in the Retail folder?
---
in retail, hunters dont have mana or melee weapons, so they can shoot in melee range. They have changed aimed shot a couple of times, so sometimes youve had to stand still and sometime you could move and even in wotlk it was instant and shared cd with aimed shot if im not mistaken
---
:) you will find out
---
Where can I find those discords?
---
Yeah, 80% of gamers aren't hardcores.
---
Do you need loads of addons?  
---
Sure, it’s a personal preference, I get it.  
---
4-5 addons isn’t hard to keep track of.
---
my game, my rules. /S
---
U sure about that?  I’m planning on maining a human warrior so I hope you’re right.  But based on my previous experience with the game and what I’ve seen on reddit, it seems like warrior will be the single most popular class
---
Shaman life is good, plenty of flavor with the totem quests and being able to self-rez even if its only 1 time per hour and requires a reagent is GODLY
---
It has been determined that dungeons in classic are faster than questing for leveling (possible xp bug). A large portion of speed levelers are doing all dungeon grinds. But they’ll be in their own premade groups.
---
I believe they're called Laughing Coffin :)
---
Gnome with pink ponytails :(
---
People say they are but, imo they were easy.
---
Because a real guide would tell you to go holy.
---
It’s what they get for using Reddit for their sole source of info when blizzard posts everything on their website. They even do it in a different color so it stands out. Let them log in on Tuesday.
---
There's nothing good about leveling in wow.
---
I find it crazy that what case\_8 said and you said actually still happen in Retail often... I really hate it when someone releases right before my rez cast finishes so I get "Invalid Target" and have to start over
---
Who got a working NSFW link?
---
Accomodating druids will be engineers so they can use shock paddles.
---
Many things going on here, but it is clear you dont know what the fuck you are doing and yet you made a guide of sorts to derail more people who are silly enough to be persuaded.
---
This has already been done by people smarter than you with loads more experience, please do not confuse the community with bullshit.
---
If people are seriously interested in paladin tanking, there are fantastic guides and information with the math to back it up in circulation.
---
Lol.
---
Don't forget about the unintelligle but highly effective /y taunting of opposing factions.
---
That dude just mocked me and I don't even know what he said...
---
fixed, thanks
---
Sorry bro, but you are going to have to swallow your pride on this one... here is Kargoz, one of the most respected guide creators in classic talking about how much better rockbiter is (see 4 min mark).. he also goes over the leveling speeds of the 1h vs 2h vs elemental, and does not come to the same conclusion as you (shocking!!!)
---

Shazzrah til i DIE!
---
Oh you're being serious haha I thought you were implying that you can't believe Classic (2004) is coming out in 2019. 
---
So in the US we do the dates as in (month/day/year) unlike EU that does (day/month/year) 
---
So August 26th/27th, 2019 :)
---
That cat isnt different from any other cat in the version we will get
---
Sure thing
---
Pretty much. You're limited to 5 resets per hour, but that won't affect you unless you're just farming one boss.
---
I'd allow it bc it speaks truth lol.
---
Is it not?
---
Where did I say me feelings are hurt? Way to project bud. Sounds to me like your home situation probably isn't in the best of places right now. But don't worry. Dad will come home, maybe.
---
You will, and you will like it.
---
Chad druids will be dancing on their corpses while talking in guild chat
---
Really? I did not know that I was under the impression they're going hunter solos for those trying to hit 60 first.
---
THIS IS SO FUCKING CUTE
---
"Corporate wants you to find the difference between these two pictures."
---
See I usually play as a warrior. So I typically went with mining and blacksmith. As it made sense for my class. But then one day I discovered I could make more with skimming and leatherworking. 
---
But that could also be a good idea.
---
it's different kind of tactic, it's about rushing and it is very competitive, I really dislike it I prefer taking it slowly
---
I'm gonna log in now and hopefully keep the game from DCing until tomorrow. Hopefully I skip queue ;p
---
"...it did not" I lol'cause same.
---
I think tailoring will be pretty popular tbh.  A lot of the mages/priests/locks will be tailors for the end game robes and zg gear.  Also many will want to go tailoring/enchanting as locks/priests/mages because it's the "correct" profs for them lore wise to some.
---
I listened to the music while painting it, maybe it made its way in there somehow 😅
---
Nice meme, but classic tanking isn't difficult, just different. Just aggro pull
---
They pushed enhancement to be a dual wielding playstyle so I think Titans grip was intended to avoid too much competition for 1h weapons.
---
Basically what Persolz said. BOE has to be equipped when won. There might be a rare situation when you get 1 piece of a set or something that is BiS as soon as you have the other part - still equip it so people can see it and it's bound, then you can unequip again.
---
Tip: Always check what the rest of the group does. If someone rolls need on everything or every BoE - simply tell the group and do it yourself, too. This way you don't end up on Blacklists/Ignore Lists but also have a chance on getting said item. If you actually need it: Also tell the others so they can role for it with you. You might have some well respectable group members that trade you the BoE if they win it.
---
What Interface addon is that??
---
But actually no.
---
I don’t see the issue. Each new launch will draw more players to each type just like launches of any game.   With the numbers these launches are looking to churn out blizz will be making their money back the first month easily with room to spare. No reason to not have both in whatever timeframe is best for blizz.
---
No, they confirmed in a post that they won't be shutting down the servers
---
The bottom quarter of the pic is great.
---
I wonder how many people were stupid enough to take this launch week off from work/school/parenting.
---
Seriously. Wait a week before deciding "Now is the time to take that week/PTO", else you are just wasting your time.
---
Execute the shadow priest 37 times at 10% health and he still ain't dead.
---
This should always be a thing.
---
A rezzer is up, cool, run back if you want or go get a smoke, doesn't matter.
---
Whole party (baring the rogues/nelves who don't own jumper cables) died? You better be running back with me.
---
You may be a little lost because there are a ton of minor callbacks to prior films and possible future ones. If you watched Iron man, GotG, any Thor movie, and any Captain America movie you would at least get a sense for what's going on and why people are doing what they are doing.
---
That being said there are images online of the timeline and would allow you to watch it as it occured rather than when it was released if you really wanted to. Like Captain America: The First Avenger to Endgame.
---
It’s 31 hours until release. Get over it, this isn’t a problem.
---
Make him run to you and y'all can serve the banshee queen
---
oh nothing
---
I think they said Medium could have small Qs, while High will most likely have a Q. So any Server on High is probably your best guess.
---
For Main + Off Hand, you can use either a Staff or a Sword/Dagger + Off-hand item.
---
Wands go in the Ranged slot, so yes you will definitely want to have one. This is what you will most likely naturally level weapon skill in, since it's generally the best auto-attack option for a mage trying to conserve mana.
---
Dang I really need to see this alliance one please.
---
I'm still confused as to why they keep saying the date is Aug 27 when it's a US game.
---
Real big missed opportunity not making it a French realm

[https://imgur.com/TiXId0Q](https://imgur.com/TiXId0Q) I was such a god back then in the WSG marshal's raid. Fucking fun times. Also was sometimes the healbitch priest for the GM warrior lol.
---
 In Hyjal that's how I avoided damage from Archimond. He boops me into the air and I just charge right at him.
---
Would that be the main upload on curseforge? im not very technical, someone advised me to change the TOC and i have no clue how to do that, dont want to trouble them as they are hard at work lol.
---
Thanks, I'll move the TL;DR
---
And yeah, I'll definitely be farming the Deathbone set regardless just because dungeons are going to be my endgame and it clearly has a role to fill. I've made "AoE" and "Heavy" tank loadouts and they'll take pride of place in the latter for sure.
---
And you’ve earned that week! This is a beautiful work you’ve made!
---
You'll just be on horde dominated servers at that point. Having odd's in your favour gets old quick.
---
I've played on both horde and alliance throughout wow through different + - servers for horde and ally, it was always more fun playing on the faction with less players for PvP. Trust me.
---
It's not a faction thing for me. It's a wPvP thing.
---
If it was the other way around for alliance, I would tell people to run horde.
---
Man I hope you don't try logging in for 31 hours.
---
80% of the mentions of the pareto principle come from just 20% of reddit posts.
---
I'm not sure that's the case. Pet movement speed and damage type were normalized in some vanilla patch, but as of 1.12, pet attack speed hadn't been. Blizzard didn't normalize pet attack speed until TBC. So Broken Tooth should still have a faster attack speed than other pets.
---
WoW sub gives you both classic and retail
---
Its not silly. My point was that you can use either of these abilities on pull and get mobs to attack you instead of others, making this effect from regen unimportant.
---
There is no planned maintenance for classic WoW on Tuesday. 
---

---
Keep up billy, try to.
---
You're able to do it, but one thing you have to consider is your class as you might not be able to do you class quest in the tauren zone.
---
They are hard to level and tanking isn't very easy - perhaps I'm underestimating how many people will play warrior, but I don't think a good warrior will have to work very hard to get groups or raid spots.
---
Sadly Lord of the Clans is now considered "Blizzard Legends" meaning its no longer canon :(
---
If theres no inscriptions,  dont bother or think long term. I haven't been keeping up with classic,  so,if its like it was back in the day, its only worth it if your the guild enchanter. Or you're in it for the long term, and going for the rare drop ench recipes. Only ts worth anythong was weapon master smith, and alchemist, raid pots...
---
Hope that helps, from a Day 1 vanilla raider.

Man up, bucko

I JUST WANT TO GO TO REDRIDGE AND KILL SOME ALLIANCE SCUM.
---
No one's gonna have the money for your bags tho
---
Jokes on them, I am the tank
---
If your night didn’t involve at least 3 other drugs you’ll be fine.
---
What a soft human being.
---
Just start with frost and stick with it. Few reasons: 
---
1. You want ele precision especially for dungeons
---
2. AE gets no bonuses until level 20 which is when you learn blizzard anyway, and its only 6% crit
---
3. You need imp blizzard asap for control and group wide mitigation
---
I'd start with something like this: https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=mage&amp;t=JBJCJDpxq6pPq7pRrgrhq5pTpWrxwapQs4s5s6s7p_wbwcpOrerfzazbzcpNp9
---
going by this sub the only thing they teach is reeeeeeee lfg
---
I gotcha.  Im falling out of touch
---
But, but, but... it is!
---
Yes. Endgame raids will consist of 3 (ideally) resto druids. No other specs will really be allowed, despite what other people try to tell you - they might, but unlikely for any semi-hardcore raiding guild.
---
Of all healers, they are the worst. They aren't *bad* per se, other classes are just better. You are bought for your battlerez (which RL calls out, you will likely not do it on your own volition), and you innervate priests (maybe shamans on horde, not sure).
---
However, despite not being the best, you absolutely CAN and will make a change and bring value to the guild as a good druid.
---
Yes, me too. I'll make it my background story, that I lost all my friends and family during the 3rd war and now am a lonely hunter. Looking forward to meet people out in the world.
---
This right here.
---
Lol. I went out last night for the final time too, new social life= classic
---
Have you seen the front page in the last few weeks? You can probably repost yesterday's top meme and it will still get 3000 upvotes and drown every other thread that has actual discussion.
---
Just a quick FYI:
---
Blackbone Wand is better than Cairnstone Sliver if you're leveling as a SP since it benefits from Shadow Weaving and Shadowform.
---
Where is the mods to get rid of these repeat posts that are going up constantly
---
Perhaps for pvp stun resistance is the best, but for me, pvp isn't the only thing that matters. I just think your misunderstanding my OP. I realize that not even race combo will be perfect, but if you could only choose 1 race for 1 class, how would you go down the list? But I mean, this is just a personal goal of mine to have 1 race per class. I plan to play alliance and horde, i don't want duplicates, so I was just simply seeking opinions on what would fit best.
---
Yeah I know. It is just, the old talent trees just allowed you to do some weird sh*t, which I just kinda miss.. Thanks for your input
---
Check the Joana’s guide, 1-60 in 116 hours. World record
---
There's a patch in which lupos doesnt do shadow damage, in the same patch they change broken tooth so that the 2 pets arent broken
---
bah you got like 30 hours till launch? eat some dons have lots of water sleep  it off, then start pounding  back good healthy food vitamins and water, maybe go for a run before launch
---
It's not really a gimp, it's more that the one point is basically the cost because the talents right below it are great.
---
If I was melee and I had to pick between a shammy or Hunter in my grp I'd take the shaman and depending on raid comp it might just be better to not have hunters in melee groups unless you're Alliance.
---
Ugh lol
---
Sentry totem resetting fall damage!
---
3/10
---
Yeah I'm waiting to see the alliance one as well:-)
---
No. I think classic+ is the superior option.
---
Already announce 4 extra servers
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
GIVE YOUR MEAT A GOOD OL' RUB
---
I wouldn't call this optimal at either PvP or PvE, but rather "decent" at both.  It's the spec I plan on playing at 60 and should allow me to Tank 5/10 mans, maybe offtank pug raids, and still get most of the PvP goodies out of arms.

Yeah, I mean if someone ASKS if they can AFK for bio or something nicely I’m not gonna be a dick about it, but you can usually tell if someone is dousching it or not.
---
Idiots gonna idiot. At least you didn’t seriously fuck up and kill an innocent family.
---
i'll probably go for it and have fun with some ridiculous potions. cheers!
---
Im logged in and looking at the server list. 10 are full, 2 high, and 2 medium. Considering the comparison to realm size in vanilla, as far as trusting what Blizzard has told us, that is like having 50+ realms. Seems to be very successful so far, so depending on your preference for PVE/PVP and timezone, I'd say you can't go wrong.
---
I thought it was my boss' kid or something
---
Yeah it's just time consuming and I was/still am an ADHD little shit.
---
It would be fun if the guild that gets world first ragnaros or the person that gets world first 60 gets the neck
---
Really wanted my names didnt get any. Got 3 random names that i just feel meh about. Disappointed. Was there at opening bell with connection issues that had me waiting and retrying over and over for 1.5 hrs
---
Just a subscription 
---
Shamans have most utility but paladin buffs are still highly desired. Holy paladins are strongest single target healer to boot. 
---
It is what you make it. Join a guild and chat a lot and you’ll make great friends - or, solo quest and yell at strangers online and you’ll get lonely and bored.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
That’s pretty poor, mate.
---
My general advice for people is if you play your class/spec well you won't have a hard time getting into groups. Reputation matters in classic
---
For how long? I started playing not long after the initial launch and I've always seen it as spirit. I can't find any resources online that would ever suggest it was wisdom at any point during the game. I'm not refuting it, just never heard of it.
---
If you're using the Twitch client, click Versions. Most recent seems to be v80200-1.0.6 beta from Aug 14.
---
As promised, here's the Wand Progression for Horde.
---
The wands listed, are the ones i consider the best choices while leveling. :) 
---
Wand Progression Cheatsheet for alliance can be seen here: https://imgur.com/UzCDJxm
---
Google. Just like you could have used to find that out. I'm not claiming is 100% accurate at all, just making the point that you can't just pretend retail players aren't reserving names like a lot of people here like to think

I don't get the hate. But I most definitely didn't give myself gold, this being the first time its ever happened. I really dont understand why some of you are so salty, but also it has no bearing on my life so it's also irrelevant. 
---
Jesus. People can twist just about anything. Guy makes a post saying hes happy people are excited, continues that in any comment - and people with nothing better to do have to accuse him of whatever bullshit they can cling to. 
---
Have fun in the game.
---
To whoever actually did gold this, thank you.
---
Depends on what blizzard does to limit ClasicLFG.  One of the options they are considering is preventing addons from interacting with channels like General, Trade, and LookingForGroup.  If they take that route, it won't be possible for addons to filter out spam.
---
If I had some red PLA I'd churn out a Horde one as well... But for now... FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
Xtc was actually an addons name back in vanilla / tbc
---
I’ll playing it first than all of you guys at 3:00 P.M. Sorry boys ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
The fastest way to make money is to increase your own personal storage capacity so you can spend more time questing before you have to clear your bag space. This really helps push bag demand and thus make bag making slightly worth it at times.
---
Yeah fair enough if somebody wants to reformat it to a square I guess but leaving the credit out is a dick move
---
Nostalgia
---
It really depends on your price range but I'd never buy Dell, HP or the like and instead go for a smaller OEMs
---
Completely subjective, I think Trolls are 10x cooler than Undead. I will always roll Troll when it's an option.
---
It would be literally be insane to believe there is not a plan in place for that.  Blizzards method here is to ensure no server ends up dead in the long run.  Having one dead server means they failed that agenda.  They won't change course on this because others think they know facts that not even blizzard can know with sll of their metrics.
---
I think Blizzard is doing a fantastic job holding to their word of trying to create long term servers.  Only time will tell if this path was the correct one.
---
We here!

I can imagine if I beat every Raid back then I wouldn't play it. Luckily I didn't even beat every Raid in TBC and Wotlk (TBC was just a casual child playing, Wotlk was a private Server that was basically dead). I'm trying not to spoil myself anything immersive. I'm reading into the what and how to do the most important things and preps,  but I try not to look at Raid Guides that show everything. I want to hear what I have to do, but the Visuals shall surprise me.
---
Nice but have to downvote so this sub doesn't become r/wow
---
I heard the ibuypower are pretty good but I usually build my own so I don’t know off the top of my head.

---

---
idk idc i rarely look at any stream for longer then 10 sec
---
I'm gonna roll undead so I can eat that ass after I rank her
---
Thank you for your commitment. Leveling with friends will make the journey a funtastic voyage.
---
even with crude math considered, I’m sold that splitting ino both SS and flurry is a bad idea (and thank you for showing me *why* instead of just telling me!) 
---
With a solid 5/5 SS I’ll be averaging 1 additional white hit every 20 attacks, which can come from any attack, be it cleave’s secondary hit or even a SS proc itself.  
---
I’m not sure how to calculate how many hits you can get in 10 seconds though, white or special, but I think roughly 2 specials per second is as fast as GCD would allow?  So 20 GCD specials+1 average SS+ *w* for white attacks, with an additional 12% increased damage from 2HSpec,
---
Normally you wouldnt consider external effects like windfury or hand of justice, but it will actively benefit SS more than it would flurry by giving additional chances for its proc.  
---
As opposed to a 25% bonus attack speed for 3 hits, which would mean 2.5 additional hits every 10 seconds.  Again, not sure how many hits can be made in 10 seconds, but guessing 20 GCD+ *w* +2 from flurry with 9% increased damage from 2Hspec.
---
The only drawback I see to not taking ether MS or BT is 3 of my GCD attacks within a 10 second span will not be as hard of an attack.  And that alone will probably be something to consider.  I just dont know if additional white damage could compensate with a more frequent use of heroic strike.  I probably wont make this hybrid but at least I’ll know why it wouldnt work
---
Ya. Was one idea I floated. Going to see if I really have time to build up 2 different characters. Honestly with life in general and my upcoming schedule in a month I doubt I will lol.
---
This is basically what I was looking for. Thanks!
---
Do as you please.

Yes this makes the most sense and it's how I remember doing it in wotlk with a battered hilt item (went for 10k) at the time.

Lol Im entitled because I dont want to have another subscription to something that was free for 10+ years? Right.  Again its the subscription model he has I dont like, not the charging for the work hes done. If it was just 5 or 10 bucks flat rate I would of paid. Im not going to have another subscription to keep track of.

I did find another guide that I plan on using. I also have a PDF of Joanas just incase the other guides are lacking :)

Talking from a UK price base you can get some decent pre built pcs for around £600 with room to upgrade later on

I am not sure that the easiest option would be the AH when there is no one with the level to build th bags and no one with the gold yo buy them.

I doubt it, they will be stalling until the deadline.

You are correct, i will not be playing on that rogue character unless it is with my friend. Is that really so hard for some people to fathom?

Yeahh I played Pala in Vanilla, so I'm gonna play paladin again haha. Ret is viable in PvE if you put the effort in and they're super fun and strong in PvP.

On top of that they're good a t AoE tanking and imo the best healer in PvP/PvE.
---
Jojo reference.

There are not enough upvotes for these guys.

Can you attack while you're running backwards so that you can preserve the distance ?
---
What am I going to do? Ah, yes, download VanillaGuide(literally his Horde guide) on a Kronos server and use that as a quest guide. Even though $5/mo is a drop in the bucket I'd feel silly paying for something I already have in my possession.

I'll simply put stuff on my keyboard if Qs are too long. Note: Holding Jump doesn't do shit - running in circles does.

Well I figure it's a text error or something but imagine you had to be a warlock to get more pet damage as a hunter..

You'll see Warriors or Paladins get first dibs.

Yeah man, this post was kind of a tongue in cheek mockery of those posts. I thought that'd be apparent.

This will be my first time playing a Priest and I have ZERO healing/raid healing experience and am looking for Guides so I can at least be semi not terrible.

Do you know any good Priest Guides or Cheat Sheets and where can I find them?

Check out your servers discord. Most have a looking for guild channel.

Yeah, very good point.

I was reading some of the quest text on one of them last night and it referenced how the troggs were mad and thought the Dwarves were attacking them, but it was actually deathwing.  I thought about it a bit and realized that would be pretty weird considering we killed him....what...8 years ago?
---
Its fine for xpacs to be like that.  To me xpacs were always a little area that was frozen in time.  You go through it somewhat quickly after the xpac is over, see the story, and then you move on.
---
To have that in a starting zone is just kind of weird.

Isn't northshire valley going to be the most populated area as alot of people will be rolling human? Correct me if I'm wrong just what I've read alot of people will be doing

Nothing about this addon will ever “look good” until the author realizes he’s trying to kill Classic.  That’s absolutely what an addon like this will do.  The community aspect is what makes the game.
---
&gt; apart from it being a Dwarf
---
thats a grudging
---
Gold generation on fresh servers is basically 90% quest rewards and mob drops that you vendor.
---
I recommend going gathering/crafting and just hoarding gold like mad. Only buy skills you need past R1, and save up for that mount at 40. Early on there's going to be way more herbs/ores/leather than anybody wants or needs.

Hey at least you're honest!

The Reddit server demographic survey? It’s stickied to the front page.

That's super cool

Whoops, ofc!

Thanks Melderon ❤️ Loved listening to this as I went to bed last night. Didn’t you have one more video to release before launch? xD

Thank you for this response, i've been trying to theorycraft a lot with the talent tree these last few days (I really like doing this for some reason) and i came to the same conclusion but wasn't sure that I covered all the details. 5/5 deflection down the line it will be for me
---
If you want the best value look up for some builds on proper subreddits
---
I have personally done Onyxia with max 15-20 people on a private server. This was pre-AQ, so we weren't in crazy gear or anything.
---
You could get away with less than 40 in MC and BWL. Bosses die super fast with a full 40-man raid that knows what they're doing. But once you get to AQ, the fights start getting long. Taking even 1 DPS out of the raid in late AQ will put a real strain on your healers and tanks.
---
That 'reality' is much, much further from what will actually happen. Only a minority will get Ironfoe and Felstriker. Most likely people are going for Dal Rend's blades.
---
Like i said, it was a busy year lol.  Plus hey, i got to pick it out (well, more like i begged for it and said it could be all i got that year).  Its not like i didnt know what it was.
---
Level 60 by the time BC comes out. Have fun
---
So look it up?
---
A link to a free guide
---
Onyxia is the big exception as she can be done pretty easily with shitty gear with 30+ people. Get to higher gear levels and you can even do her with 15, 10, or possibly 5 people. As for the other raids they really do need 40 people unless you outgear them. Ive run MC and BWL plenty of times with 36ish people but every person you remove just makes it that much harder. I doubt you would be able to do "current content" with any less than 30 unless your group is quite skilled
---
No plz
---
Bud Light, pretzels and pop corn
---
This is very close to something I said as well. 
---
Open up more servers in a few months, allow for transfers, profit.
---
It can be difficult to tell the difference between a DDOS and legitimate traffic. It's not hard to believe that traffic increased significantly this close to release. His website was never really that fast to load.

lmfao, i unfortunately didnt take off of work, but I went out friday and got blacked out, slept until 5pm on saturday. I've been going out with my friends pretty much every weekend for the past 2-3 years. I told all of them that im retiring from going out because classic comes out on monday. One of them said "see you on friday" and I told him guaranteed they wont. Some of my friends in the group chat are also playing classic so they understand im being 100% serious, but the others dont play video games so they think its a bluff lmao.

Not quite, we haven't even started talking politics yet.

Alliance is kinda hard to read :(
---
Sorry for my ignorance but exactly when is the launch happening? People are saying tomorrow but I thought it dropped the 27. Does it come out earlier on Monday? Or is it midnight on Monday technically Tuesday? Any insight for a fellow Druid!
---
funny you say that, I'm an esp magician irl
---
MC will be getting pugged very early on. It's just a 40 man Dungeon basically.
---
If you're alliance and you're going to RFD or RFK, you'll be coming from bootybay. That walk is horrendous. It might be the longest walk in the game.  If you die, you spawn back at bootybay. So if you get ganked on the way, you're in for a hell of a time.

Sorry, didn't have time for it :p

Tomorrow? I thought it comes out Tuesday
---
Yeah. But I think female undead is my favorite character model in game
---
You got some unused real estate towards the bottom there.
---
A healthy and nutritious meal like soup or some sort of meat meal. Since I imagine you want to minimize the time needed to prepare it, cook it tomorrow, and just microwave it on launch day. Of course you can instead choose unhealthy quick meals to eat while playing, but why would anyone would choose to hurt themselves like that?
---
I was a clicker. Please don't judge!

Hey friend, we are not sure from your post if you will be playin NA or EU.
---
If you are on EU, our guild is on Zandalar PVP RP and we would be more then happy to take you in.

 The premise of our guild is helping eachother out and sharing information about the game we love. We plan to do all group quests/group content with the guild.

guardian/battle elixirs became a thing in TBC. Theres not really many hard rules in terms of what stacks and what doesnt. Eg. Intellect Elixirs dont stack with AI, so theyre considered not worth it.

Elixirs that give the same stat/buff dont stack, ie. Minor and Major Troll's Blood or Agility Elixirs and Mongoose.

You can have as many Elixirs up as you want, though a lot of them arent very useful.

Damn. Thought I was going to avoid them on skeram.  Any idea of those communities are toxic?  Is it worth switching to one of the launch day servers?

---
It's probably not going to matter too much early on because sharding will keep things level for a while to come. 
---
Paladins don't get race-specific spells like priests do so it comes down to the racials. Humans have mace &amp; sword specialization which increases damage by a bit so that's an objective advantage but it's not much at 60 when you're probably going to be healing anyway.

Launch will be a shitshow. Even a blind dog can see that.
---
Ever wonder why Female Undead don’t ha e the broken jaw or missing jaw facial feature? Did that make the women too unattractive or something, similarly to how they redesigned the Female Troll? 
---
Maybe Blizz feared that they’d get flack for promoting violence against women?
---
That's why I posted this? It was changed did you not read it?
---
&gt;The option to disable broadcasting your dungeongroup has been removed and groups will now always be advertised in chat
---
100g/h? Holy shit that’s amazing. Only thing that has a chance will be flasks but you’ll have players camping those nodes.
---
I wonder how crazy layering will be for those nodes...
---
3PM the whole day?
---
&gt;literally
---
He didn't say that. He said $5 is literally nothing.
---
Oh, you would be surprised by some of my co-workers. Lmao.
---
Did you read the post you're responding in?
---
Yes for raiding. But no class raids as a 2h melee. So big dick 2h weapons will go as pvp items to who can use them best, which will be warriors/paladins/hunters
---
Not enough dirty plates and cups full of unknown liquids, 0/10 vanilla experience

Hi, /u/Xseos

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cvbpo2/alliance_faction/). 
---
Off myself if i ever create threads like these
---
Keep in mind that during the initial rush of leveling, the economy is going to be all sorts of messed up and the rules which dictate the economy later on aren't necessarily going to apply. It's going to be hard to sell almost anything except maybe wands and bags.
---
After the initial rush, mining and herbalism are both good basic goldmakers. For alchemy, you won't really be raking in the gold until you get lucky enough to get a flask recipe drop. Blacksmithing is not very profitable under the best circumstances.
---
If you're mostly doing pve, and care about min/max, play troll.
---
If you're not a min/max guy, then play whatever you want.
---
Again it’s him removing that feature because he was forced to by Blizzard.  He’s still doing everything in his power to circumvent their intent which is NO LFG ADDONS.
---
That’s why I Tank them as Winnie the Pooh and battle Rez healer or dps when needed to avoid wipes.
---
Will runecloth turn-ins for rep be available in phase 1? Trying to decide if I want to try and get a different faction mount.
---
Lol watch how wrong you are.
---
Realm discords are run by scammers, dont trust them.

00:00 is too late xD
---
I was addicted to fishing in Draenor, the same with pet battles.
---
Is Curseforge still the #1 repository for addons  in Classic?
---
I use the number pad.
---
I know I want to play priest. That's at least one thing I'm sure of. Originally I planned to go NE, then I thought Dwarf would be better for me. I love NE but I hate their spell animations. I hate Dwarf but I actually like their animations. So at some point I said screw it whatever I'll just roll Horde. But do I even like Horde enough to play it? I was actually looking foward to the Alliance zones but since I've played Alliance only since vanilla it might be nice to see something different. Do I want to play on a Pve or PvP server? So now I sit here still completely undecided and waiting for some divine revelation telling me what to do.
---
I really like the concept of an elemental shaman. I used to play mage in vanilla but lightning is just more appealing to me. Could I solve the mana issue for raiding elemental shamans by using gear with mp5 and specing into improved mana totem instead of the crit talent? Also are guilds really going to force me to spec resto if I want to raid?
---
Zygor by far
---
Does disengage Work like that in vanilla? Thought  it just was a treath dump
---
You are right of course. But probably I will remain weak-minded and anxious about what other people think of me.. haha.
---
Ah, thanks for the insight, I never played Shaman further than level 23 in vanilla. My main was a warrior, really enjoyed pvping at 60. Im thinking about just going warrior again cause of the nostalgia feels but I dunno. 
---
I enjoy healing alot, cleared everything except KJ in TBC pre-nerf as a holy paladin (belf). Im not really looking for the "hardcore" guild experiance this time around though, so healing might not be the optimal route for me.
---
Talking to has made me feel that I will either go warrior or rogue, so thanks for helping me come a step closer to the answer haha!
---
I also cant wait to play vanilla again, I really loved vanilla and TBC, wotlk was alright but everything after that is mediocre imo.
---
Saying a guide will be free and then asking people for money if definately not cheap.
---
Disenchanting is one of the harder Prof to do.
---
Depends where you live. :) it comes out in 28 hours from the time of this post
---
Blizzard forced that change.  He’s shown he is still interested in making this addon as functional as possible.  It’s an addon designed to ruin classic and make it as close to retail WoW as possible.
---
Queue up. Get in. Stay up most of the night. Get through darkshore at lvl 19. Sleep. Wake up and run deadmines cleave group into the stockades. That would be a perfect launch. Doubt it’ll happen.
---

---
Can you link?
---
Expect many issues aoe farming because the servers will be very crowded and every spot will be contested for farming, questing and ganking. You can probably get by doing dungeons with an AOE spec. By the time you're raiding though you need to radically shift your spec leaning towards arcane / frost for a big dps increase which will probably require respeccs.
---
They absolutely do
---
Sounds like a plan. I need to come up with a good name for my character while I'm letting it install!
---
Don’t be silly I won’t be able to keep track of time I’ll just eat them when I get peckish.
---
Ahh rp realms haha never play on those realms :) best to avoid all contact with them no matter what
---
I feel bad for your keyboard with all those chips
---
Because it goes live at 1pm central time on Monday and I work a 9-5 job. Gives me time to sleep in, buy some snacks and drinks and get ready for marathon grinding session.
---
lol too true
---
Awesome \^\^
---
Yeah my bad, thanks! Just subscribed and both are now on WoW1
---
Getting Staves unlocked. 
---
Playing Warlock and they start with daggers. 
---
They can learn to use staves, and there are a ton of great ones for them. 
---
However, as I recall, the trainer is in Thunderbluff, so I’ll have quite the trek from Durotar.
---
That is not at all true, I can’t yell people back to life as a warrior and my dh can’t lord illidan folks back up
---
Why not 👀
---
Same, I have to start work an hour before Classic launches and work until 10. Then get up in the morning and start at 8 am. So I won't be able to play til like 5:30 or 6pm on Tuesday.
---
Thank you so much!Listening to the log in music I remember my first time seeing that screen. I thought the animation was amazing!!! I played WarcraftII and WarcraftIII and now I finally get to "play" as my own character. I literally spent an hour from start to finish designing my rogue night elf. I am so excited to go back to this simplicity and relive some of the happiest times in my young adult life.
---
Thank you for the information, this seems accurate, also why did you use A and A-, couldn't you have just extended the list to E?
---
What region are you in?
---
Thank you, I assume leveling is what I will be doing for a long time and to be honest I even find the retail paladin a bit tedious to level, only having two or three cooldowns and that's it. I definitely want one and I always wanted to get into healing but Im surely going for mage first.
---
You're a fucking meme.
---
Cheers, yeah figured it out!
---
Take a step back mate, chill out and re-read as many times as you like.
---
I like this
---
Another benefit for herbalism is if you go rogue you can farm your reagents for thistle tea, and one of your abilities. But honestly it’s a brand new server so any way you go you can make money.
---
Thats dope. Thanks.
---
It’s 2019. Most places can’t ask you for a reason.
---
I feel like you're underrating enh shamans for this
---
Well, which means I have absolutely no clue what the fuck you were even arguing for or against.
---
I'm rolling a shadow priest. Really strong in PvP, decent in PvE with appropriate mana management planning.
---
Make it to Westfall by the end of the first session.
---
I have a super chill boss and work in the public sector. Just going to email in the morning and say I am not feeling well. I have like 6 days of sick leave remaining for the year. I only used 1.5 for a surgery I had earlier this month so my managers think I am pretty bad ass haha.
---
I work from home and nobody knows if I'm working or not.  So tomorrow I'll be "working" *wink* *wink*.
---
I just ran out of popcorn :(
---
&gt; Life is super short, and death is knocking on your door.
---
This guy is **lying**. Turns out it was my landlord, doing a smoke alarm inspection. I even said "Are you death?", and all I got was a weird look.
---
Low. Effort.
---
There is only going to be a handful of engineers. Its an expensive profession and on new servers where gold cant be bought from gold farmers people will be doing professions to save them money (blacksmith, leatherwork, tailor, enchant) and also make money. Retail vanilla had few engineers for the shear cost of it to level. I had it on Darkspear in vanilla and can confirm on my server it was probably 5% or less with engineering
---
to be fair, I want it to be cringe. You lose!
---
Trophy husband so no excuse. :) Just did house tidying beforehand.
---
They are from quest rewards early on. I know horde at least gets a 4 slot bag from killing the pirates southeast of razor hill
---
No, you
---
Some people just don't get it.
---
Also I am skipping tuesday and wednesday. I am off at 4 pm PDT so no reason to be home tmrw.
---
I'm hyped for the game but I'm also being realistic. I've played on a private vanilla server recently, so I'm familiar with the pace of the game and I personally really like how the game plays.
---
I have a friend who is just as hyped who's also taken some time off work. He never played vanilla (as he was only 5 years old at the time) and has never played on a private server. I'm kind of worried that he's not going to like it as much as he thinks he is.
---
I actually wrecked my motorcycle on the interstate on the 13th of this month. Been out of work the whole time due to knee injury. If car behind me hadn't stopped, I'd be 1 more person not making it to launch.
---
I think it auto DCs regardless of activity after 30 minutes. Confirm?
---
Esfan or Asmongold are the ones I'll watch, Soda if he's online but he's a big a prick. 
---
I'm sure you'll get many more suggestions but these 3 are mine.
---
Absolute unit. A perfect Chad-hance. Bravo.
---
frostadamus isn't a huge streamer, but he's super knowledgeable about classic and has been making content for it for a long time on youtube. I personally enjoy his streams.
---
RIP Gez and Artie.
---
yep did all my garden work buts lord known i aint doing that once classic out
---
For the alliance ! :D
---
Hope to see you there! If you see me, please say hi! Social interaction is the best part of this gem :) Rakutin- Gnome Mage
---
Considering akljsdldaskj is taken on Herod, I think most people have resubbed.
---
This isn't new information our entire conversation happened with the knowledge that this kind of functionality was being restricted by blizzard.  The fact that you think this in someway validates you only further proves that you have no clue what we're talking about.
---
National holiday here in the UK tomorrow.
---
Makes me wish there was somg kind of website to reconnect with old friends. I know the names of two vanilla friends but have since lost contact with them.
---
Piko the gnome warrior or Hadoran the dwarf (with the killer accent that always said "Fanny Packs!"in Ventrilo .... If you're reading this please contact me! I believe we were on the original Gorgonash server. Maybe Bonechewer? It's been so long.
---
*insert outrage about calories, diabetes risk and so on*
---
Nah, enjoy dude! I trust you will eat and drink it in moderation...just like wow ;]
---
You're welcome. Hope you'll have a great launch experience.
---
Legend says they are still frozen there to this day
---
EST and PST are timezones as well. The server time of servers in these regions uses those timezones.
---
The only reason the Americas have two "groups" of servers in different timezones is because its a much larger region, spanning more timezones and more people.
---
West coast American server's aren't "characterized" as PST... they're just all in PST. The same as European servers are CET.
---
Wild guess, but I assume the majority of their subscribers live in the timezones for the release of the 27th. So of course that date is more put out there, and the NA date clarified with an asterik.
---
Realistically the staff will be replaced by phase 2. There is a very good chance you will get a replacement in phase 1, or you are going to be a smart person and farm out the witch blade and offhand.
---
The trinket is unique and will always have some use in every phase of the game.
---
Yes!    And  No..   It Will Not Be Similarly Engaging.
---
That's a lot of sugar
---
Pretty much endgame, so basically whoevers the bigger name or PvPer in the guild will probably end up with it.
---
Intel Core i7-8550U, 8 GB DDR4-2666 och Intel UHD Graphics 620 (Kaby Lake R U GT2) are my specs. Would I be able to play the game at 1080p (even if low) and still maintain a decent fps? (50+)
---
Fuck it. FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
I would switch them. Me in a suit represent my professional life and kids.
---
Mamoa sneaking up represent classic getting ready to wreck my life.
---
That guide makes some good arguments, but I wouldn’t take it as gospel. For example he skips +defense because it makes you get hit less, and yeah you want to get hit but the +block makes it worth it.
---
But yes, paladin tanking wants to maximize holy damage. str and agi aren’t  in aid of that goal and mp5 is. Fair point.
---
The frost aoe specs are fine for dungeons and single target as well. If your group is having issues it wont be because of your spec.
---
That's a good idea. Thanks for sharing :)

Right?  Good Lord they're just so boring. They're always just standing in-game doing nothing or silently just playing the game. I just wait for clips on Youtube.
---
I just have two giant pots of chilli made and some taco shell kits but god damn this is next level prep.
---
No problem man have a good time playing classic !
---
I can see his expression just from this shot.

Check out Andrea mosaic. Great software for making mosaic.
---
I'm a bit of a health freak but as an exception I have brought a couple cans of Code Red (found in UK!!!) and a few other naughty goodies ... Will be up till around 3am if my sever isn't melting :D

Actually, some obese people (around 25%) actually never develop type 2 diabetes. Their pancreas actually generate more insulin producing cells as a result of the never-ending sugar bath, instead of losing them.
---
It's **heart disease** that is the inevitability.
---
Go buy and drink some pedialyte and clean your vagina
---
If I want to tank 5 mans, is putting a shield on and going into defensive stance enough while leveling?  Like should I level as Arms and only respec prot at 60?
---
That Switch is looking good!
---
Nice setup also!
---
Or Grand Marshall, there is no in-between.
---
You calling me low class? Because i'll have you know i'm wearing https://www.wowhead.com/item=61538/nice-shorts and what is low class about that?
---
You're right. More beer it is. For the Horde!
---
Good point. I think i will do that 🙂.Teldrassil is amazing as well. Good luck on your journey! Welcome home!
---
I found a druid prowling in your room!
---
I personally am starting in Thunder Bluffs for Tauren then moving over to the orc starting area to quest with a pal. The advice I've gotten is to level to 10, then redo the low level quests in that area so you don't miss out on any trainer quests.   
---
That being said, going from undercity to barrens won't be especially difficult, get to 10 or 12 or what have you, then hop on the zeppelin to orgrimmar and run south to meet up with your pal. Not terribly dangerous.
---
Lol no. It was OP death nights shitting on everyone as the new “hero” class. It was absolutely busted, the leveling had been streamlined to easy mode, flying was still in and the new BGs were mediocre. 
---
Just my 2 cents - Cata was the last of it for me.
---
I was wondering about this earlier too but after laking and reading into a lot of threads, checking out the discords etc it’s pretty much like a normal PvP-server. I’d image the community being a little bit more casual and mature but you I don’t think you’d notice any difference except people having more appropriate names for their characters.
---
In my experience, you will only get ganked when you're fighting a mob or drinking. If you're just walking through, the only people who will attack you are people massively outleveling you.
---
Esfand, Asmon, and Staysafe wont quit, wow is their game. Many of the horde guys who are top retail pvpers will quit eventually, but Payo will stick around, as will Tipsout. I expect Soda to burn out eventually.
---
Just buy it for one month and copy-paste it to a google doc. You dont need to continue your sub once you have access to the all the content.
---
&gt;S Tier: MM Hunters
---
Anyone who's leveling as an mm hunter on a fresh server is a free kill so not too sure about this one
---
Only he can bring peace between the factions..!  
---
Quick! Kill him!
---
It depends actually what weapons you have. Lets say you are lvl30 and you get a blue 2hand sword for lvl 30. Than its better than 2 1handers. Visca versa. But when your weapons are as good as the other. Fury should put out more dps. Arms is a bit more mobile
---
Your first 5 talent points should be in the discipline for improved wand damage.  After that go into shadow and get spirit tap.  With those 2 talents alone priests have little to no downtime and can level comfortably to 60.  As far as which race, undead and trolls can be priests on the horse side.  Priests are unique in that each race gets its own flavor spell.  Trolls have lightning shield type ability, while undead gain devouring plague which is an instant cast DOT that’s also heals the priest.  Most people prefer undead when factoring in their other racial.
---
No, ive never had a good time on rp(rppvp) servers.
---
Happend to this guy aswell.

Haha, I used to hear it on the commercial when my kid was watching Cartoon Network.
---
There any services that check availability of names on various servers?
---
Instead of typing stuff in and hoping it sticks?
---
you're downvoted but you're not wrong, there will absolutely be new bugs in this game
---
I like how female orcs are straight back and look good in plate. Taurens are absolute chads though :(
---
Yea the problem with that is I’m going to have other alts too and I think it would be a waste of time to level another rogue lol
---
I like the taste
---
I think its either the one or the other, but im not sure :/
---
Well, at first glance thats true, but not when you see the grand [Snorty](https://i.imgur.com/z7cEAWB.png) himself
---
He doesn't have a mustache to snort better.
---
Nah that is pretty average, people saying classic is easy are the min maxing try hards or trolls.
---
Your username 100% checks out, atleast you have to going for you. ;)
---
I don't work
---
&gt;Don't take vacation/days off for frivolous things
---
Who said I did. I have the vacation days. I'm just not allowed to leave for a whole week. Busy time at work.
---
I could just run up to Thunder Bluff and take the zeppelin to Orgrimmar and run down to Ratchet right?
---
Yes both are fine for leveling. Carrying a shield is a good idea in general, most relevant if you're tanking but also some abilities are only usable with a shield equiped.
---
I think you can gather in animal form. Regardless you can change forms in combat so it doesn't matter. Get pvp bonus and you'll run at level 49 mount speed in travelform
---
Am I the only one that genuinely likes [how fury warriors look](https://i.imgur.com/7Gz3uPQ.png)? I think they look awesome! :D
---
*Tears up*
---
Seems pretty reasonable to me. Vanilla WoW was a game designed to cultivate social interaction between players who share a common goal. If that's not your cup of tea, then Classic isn't for you, and there's no use pretending.
---
Give it a try it's free with a month subscription
---
Ye, think ill also make an NA account just to get some practise on the first areas. Then when the game releases for EU I will be prepared!
---
Hey, thanks for the advice! I’d like to ask one more question if it’s not too much trouble. Would a Paladin be an okay class for a newbie? They’re kinda like a Warrior/Priest in one? I hear they’re a bit simpler in the healing department (versus a Priest who has many buffs and heals and whatnot) but can also be somewhat of a tank? Excuse my ignorance on these topics
---
It's surprisingly hard to keep up with gathering professions (they level much faster) so It's probably more time efficient to level up fast and get back to blacksmithing when you can either gather the materials on a mount or buy them straight up.
---
If you're not dying to level fast though you could definitely combine the two, you'll just have to take some more detours getting more ores.
---
Where do you people find all these insecurities? 
---
It's impressive.
---
Roleplay whatever you want yo. 
---
The fuck.
---
Here a TL;DR for the good parts  
---
TL:DR No more displaying talents points spent. No auto invite. You MUST manually type every message. Every message will always be in chat NOT in the addon itself.
---
So regardless of whether or not you're using this add-on you will still see all the group's made by it and won't be at a disadvantage. Also there won't be a negative impact to communication.
---
Servers came up at 6pm (EST) for me so there is no point in not going to work tomorrow.
---
Now am I seriously considering starting up all Monday night, calling out Tuesday, and playing all day while my son is at summer camp and my wife is working? Absolutely lol.
---
Welcome to ZT. Buckle up, were going to RP-PVP.
---
You will absolutely be jumping back and forth between quest zones throughout your entire leveling experience. At some point you will be limited to quests that are too difficult for you to do in a zone. Your options are to either grind until you are high enough level to complete them or go to another area and quest until you can return and complete those harder quests
---
I use a logitech g502 and bind a few of the buttons to ctrl and alt modifiers through the logitech program
---
Wow this is lovely
---
I just bought a laptop so I can play. Haven't played since TBC and laptop specs mean nothing to me so I bought a 1200 dollar gaming laptop hoping itll be good enough (from what specs I could read, should be absolutely fine and probably overkill).
---
Now I just wait for it in the mail. I'm excited to play but not happy I had to drop some coin.

why are you expecting to dual wield a 2h weapon?
---
Hi folks
---
A few quick questions.
---
Will battlegrounds be available at wow classic launch? I remember WSG, AB and AV. 
---
Also, will open world PVP be a thing still? One of the reasons I started playing WoW back in the day was for the ganking. My buddies and I would go around taking over small towns and ganking people. Is that still going to be doable in WoW Classic?
---
It will ruin your experience IMO. Part of the fun is jumping in blind and immersing yourself.
---
Very recently some of the public Realm servers have been the subject of conversations because of the horrid content that is being shared on them. Best to stay away.
---
Whatever you prefer, unless you want a shaman/paladin cause those are faction exclusive. Just choose a regular server under the english tab. German, french and russian servers are on a different tab.
---
I told them im going on vacation. "They asked where to?" I said "world of warcraft". No fucks given. Took a week off.
---
One the one hand going warrior means you won't have a bad tank, but on the other the odds of DPS who think they can do random pulls, AoE everything and don't know what sunders or crowd control is goes up. DPS vs tank threat is the real PvP fight of vanilla WoW.
---
No zeppelin between TB and Org
---
Good news shadow priests,  you get an invite and my Brez.
---
These posts make me glad I don't have kids yet
---
if you have more points in frost than in arcane you are a frost mage regardless what spells you cast
---
Yes, I realized I'm a moron. Still, a day off is a day off.
---
I don't remember how it works in PVP but in PVE once you attack a mob it's tagged to you and only you/party members can get loot/quest progress/xp from it.
---
Very smart, I will inform the comrades and do the same
---
Why is the RPPvP realm so underpopulated?
---
Because not everybody likes oversaturation.
---
Why choose a full realm?
---
Why not just post a picture?
---
Anyone who calls or VC is intentionally trolling, no exceptions.
---
Yea
---
Ah cool, enjoy!
---
Sounds good. I will be going either Orc Warrior or Orc Rogue....havent decided yet haha! I will be playing on Firemaw.
---
Agreed it's a little daunting at first same with tradeskillmaster, I think it's a balancing act for a lot of these add-ons, they want to provide features, but also it has to be easy to use and not overwhelming.
---
Uhh dude, right in the feels. I'm going to be so addicted all over again, am I not? xD
---
Nice work man 10/10
---
If you don't want to engage in the RP aspect, just be prepared to name your character "Silentmonk" or something.
---
The dps boost is pretty small. While Stoneform is extremely impactful in pvp.
---
Maybe you could have someone test out names for you if you're not able to try yourself but I don't think there's any service to check it out right now.
---
That's it. I'm not leaving the house.
---
Your own choice would be fine.  Its more of a recommendation to make some early money.
---
I thought we made a no art rule, half the front page is art right now

soooo AWESOME! I NEED ONE

Join the Skeram Squad! Great community, good faction balance, we just went High pop today, so overall it's looking amazing. I'm really excited to play on this server. I'll be playing Alliance, so if you decide to roll Skeram (and you should!) I'll see you on the battlefield, one side or the other.
---
Looks amazing!!
---
I've heard early mage is boring AF - frostbolt, frostbolt, frostbolt, etc. But then you get to play fire in Naxx and that's better.
---
Then again, mage sounds pretty fun in general.
---
I'll probably just have enchanting on my bank alt to DE items. Main will have gathering profs that I can level while I quest/grind.
---
Check out vanilla friends.com
---
I remember it taking 2 hours to run back in the day, so he is technically correct. It’s not usually some kind of 4 hour slog unless you keep losing tanks and healers or your group is woefully ill equipped.
---
First time doing a reddit post and not used to reddit in general, so i don't know the use for it, but thanks !
---
Open world pvp will very much be a thing. There's no flying mounts, there's going to be tons of people leveling and I don't doubt you'll love pvp servers.
---
I'm only half-joking, I take this quite seriously. Statistically there's gotta be *at least* one unlucky bastard out there who will have his expectations ruined tomorrow, which sucks big fat donkey balls.
---
Rank 1 frost Bolt is used by every mage...
---
From the poles in the subreddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ZandalarTribe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZandalarTribe/) , the balance seems to be close to 50/50 with a slight Alliance dominance. There will be enough roleplayers on the Horde side, you probably just need to put in more effort to find people to roleplay with. But as a horde player you are very welcome on the server.
---
Still out faster than Star Citizen!
---
are you sure its that the uruks dont care about wearing heavy armor because they want to smash instead of it being Saruman is raising a massive secret army and just doesnt have the production means to create that much heavy plate armor in such a short time?

---
Don't care what level they are I'll enjoy killing a horde pleb any time
---
What about PVP battlegrounds?
---
Combat rogues have a talent that increases skill with swords, fists and daggers by 6 and the value from additional weapon skill drops off significantly after 305 so the +5 weapon skill racial isn’t nearly as valuable for rogues as it is for warriors. 
---
It still means human rogues do very slightly more dps in pve because dwarves have no racials that benefit their damage but it is negligible.
---
Druid tanks are the best tanks for almost all dungeon content.
---
And you instantly die again because you res with 20% hp.
---
Yeah im pretty sure one of the world most well known vanilla guild leaders / tanks has 0 interest in classic after being a heavy advocate for it. And its not like you are stuck with a 1950 tv with only 3 channels to watch. Dont like, go somewhere else. No need to trashtalk people at every opportunity cause you think your opinions are facts. Kungen not a gamer lol please, dude prob has more hours in WoW alone than whiners in this thread have combined in all their gaming life.
---
&gt;Anyone seen Mankriks wife?
---
Also fair 🙃
---
Dude im supper indecisive my friends and family go crazy cause i keep asking melee or ranged i choose a class that close to my personal life ( class that fits me personalty the most  )  As a huge animal friend and a Dog trainer in real life how can i not choose hunter Rogue was a close second choice but personalty dont fit me at all If you have real problem choosing a class maby look at classes a different way ( What fits your personalty . class identity . what they can do ) keep in my mind that even if you go druid changing talents cost alot of gold and your most likely not be able to do everything cause changing talens cost a lot gold  Hope it helped
---
That was really good
---
Oooof the ending with the music gives me them good chills every time.
---
Nope. There's nothing in the AMA about closing servers and they only reference transfers in the context of being a way to combat certain realms being drastically over-populated.
---
Just use twitch client. Select classic in top right and refresh it will show 2hats available same as retail.
---
I agree this will eventually be the best strategy, but the player economy will be very small initially. The focus in this article is on spending less and selling to NPCs. If I would rewrite the article a couple weeks later, this would certainly be in there. 
---
Same goes for herbing and mining. People won't have a lot of gold, so the value will low.
---
Wands are a massive part of your damage while leveling as a priest, so keeping your wand DPS up to date makes things go a lot faster.
---
You sure can. You can use the Curse/Twitch client if the addon you want is on there. Lot's are reporting that in order to get Curse to sync properly for classic is to first install a couple of addons manually.
---
Place the addons in 
---
\`\`\`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\World of Warcraft\\\_classic\_\\Interface\\AddOns\`\`\`
---
Or wherever your classic is installed.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Don’t be sad man, I’ll pop open a Fosters for you.
---
Those people likely won't get past lvl 20-30, so you're probably fine.
---
Wow.
---
According to the survey it's a 52/48% split for Alliance/horde so if that is somewhat accurate you should be fine? I just joined up as Alliance tho, see you out there!
---
That’s why you sell names for PayPal or Venmo and not bnet money 🤣
---
Yeah nice hyperbole... It's not like it's difficult to cache a save for quickly getting back on pace or something, but hey I guess we should only ever expect subpar things if they're free. /s
---
Yoink
---
Because it doesn't actually matter....it's MC lul
---
I want classic to be as pure as it can be, but tbh I would also love a Chromie easter egg somewhere. A present time chromie that knows you are not in the BFA version of the game. One that reminds you that the future is still out there somewhere, even though you may never return.
---
Careful there mate, only wankers drink Foster.
---
They don't. Pinky promise.
---
I main tanked world first nefarian with 31 arms 15 prot -_-
---
If we’re talking about the hunter ability, it knocks you back. It killed me several times. 
---
Rogues have a threat dump, and that’s all it does.
---
I looked into the future and saw a post by Shammble complaining about how so many people are bad at the game and ruining his experience because they wanna RP walk through dungeons with no tank and 4 heals
---
Why does this man have lifeless, black eyes that make me feel very wary of him? 
---
Of the few clips I have seen, he demands things of his "followers" (in-game) and obviously has a complex about being the leader. If he dies, he instructs others to die too.
---
I dislike him.
---
Yeahhhh, I think I set myself on Eng. here.
---
Why would blizzard lie about that? 
---
Oh yea. Blizzard bad right?
---
How dare you desecrate the original post!
---
Nah, I want classic. Not a remaster. Go to a city, talk to people, don't use an unecessary addon
---
No one? They created sharding tech **because of WoD**. Legion and BfA releases were near flawless.
---
Don't be too discouraged if you want to play a specific class. Despite how it appears on reddit, guilds that exclude people based on class/spec will be a minority. The content is not exceedingly difficult and the biggest issue has always been logistics.
---
Ayee good job. I used to make those when I was a kandi kid.

Welcome!!!!! I'm on Fairbanks! For the Horde!!! Enjoy the journey,  it's worth it in every way.

Look we don’t know other Australian beers over here, you got a better suggestion?

&gt;I think unfortunately Joanas time is limited for his guides. Once someone obliterates his record and brings out a new guide for that, he'll be done.

The rank 1 is done when there is a new rank 1.

Hot take.
---
Transmog sure is awesome.
---
That’s.. not what you said

Someone shared this idea with me a while back:

Make bank alts with their names. You get to keep their memory alive when you need to offload some stuff. They can help you even though they are gone

No addons

Unrestricted name reservation opens at 1pm EST. I believe the new servers open at that time as well.

Op wants more ignorant people so it would be easier to be numba one

Haha, playing a non-optimal spec means you must play BfA?

What kind of horse shit gatekeeping is that?

That escalated quickly

All aboard the hype-train!

Cata was where retail started to fall off. Pandaria was the nail in the coffin.

I found it pretty reliable when I planned for it. But a surprise fall, was tough to select a mob.

Also T3 sets for casters cost a ton of Mooncloth.

Tireless, poop-socking howler monkeys hahaha. I'm more looking forward to professions, farming mats, farming rep, etc, game has countless hours of content that you can play in 1-2hr seshes.
---
I mean from my understanding they’re going by reserved names only which doesn’t guarantee logins. Also, could they also want to push even pops across the regions?
---
Not really. OP was talking about no space to carry trash items while leveling that are going to be sold to a vendor.
---
You're talking about running out of bank space (I guess).
---
game releases globally at the same time so unless you have a time machine you might as well just wait
---
Why is everyone obsessed with engineering for pvp? It's been years since I played and I'm sure its changed, but I dont remember it being that detrimental.
---
Completely personal choice. Choose whichever aesthetic you like better.
---
Like the dude from Fresh Prince?  Eww... I’ll just stick to Kronenburg.
---
You will be hopping between zones for level approriate quests, unless you plan to do some very heavy mob grinding.
---
Leveling as a warrior is not brutal, it may be somewhat slower than some but that's fine.
---
Do not play a protection warrior until 60 - put in zero points.  In vanilla there was very, very little advantage to prot.  The 31 point prot ability is good for threat but thats about it, and threat usually isn't the problem.
---
unless people were saving his streams.. you wont find evidence  
---
but back in may during early beta (1-30) he would repeatedly tell his viewers "dont worry my guide will remain free in classic, I AM addind a members section for all those who support me, but im not sure whats in it yet"  
---
(it was even in a update note on his site dated april, "my guide will continue to remain free"  
---
well sometime between june and now he deleted that "update" note on his site, stopped telling people on twitch "dont worry" , added a note in june that a members area was coming and he wasnt sure what would be in it (no mention yet of his guide being locked, just extra content)  
---
he asked people to beta test his guide for him .. for free.. under the guise that his site would remain free  
---
he goes on twitch with esfand ONE TIME and all of a sudden its "fuck my loyal followers, i want money"  
---
THATS WHY WERE PISSED... people were even commenting that if his guide would remain free they would donate to him because they feel like they should support his efforts, he did nothing to correct these peoples assumptions and actually encouraged them to donate.. knowing full well he was about to lock them out
---
I think on some realms the queues will be awful. On others they wont be so bad but no realm will be without a queue. Bliz legitimately wants large healthy servers and I think they are slightly over exaggerating when they say every Full realm will have hours of queues, they really want some of you to spread out a bit so Herod doesnt have 50k players.
---
Vanilla WoW server community was really something special! After raids were over the hunter of the top Ally guilds (EU Daggerspine later Kazzak), would often meet up in the bank and agree that all loot is hunter loot. And you would filled with envy inspect those in the better guilds with better loot.
---
Pic 2: This dui was legendary of the server wielding Sulfuras and Thunderfury! Always people around inspecting in IF.
---
Pic 3: OG will recognise where i got the inspiration for that horrible UI from! Min maxing Classic will really be something different!
---
Here's one. Can an officer in a guild kick someone from the guild?
---
Actually a sweet looking race.
---
Yea like a new player with zero information will probably quit. They should totally learn how the basic systems works. 
---
But op seems like the type to complain that the priest in his group melees and cast no heals.
---
I think this is MUCH more fitting
---

Guys I'm panicked right now.  Is the Classic download really only 5GB!?  I expected that it would be more.  I could get into the character creation screen and made a character but I will be devastated if I am prompted to download more stuff once launch happens!  Do I also need to have retail version downloaded or something??  Please give me assurances!
---
Not your fault, int buff was purged.
---
Imagine: Oscar the Grouch
---
Lul that’s why tichondrius, illidan, and area 53  were down for over 6 hours when bfa launced
---
I forgot how much dieing warriors do soloing, until I played the stress test.
---
If by "die bravely" you mean "CAST FEAR COWARDLY" and run away. Then yes :) See you out there
---
Sorry, I thought you meant baddie enhancers. 
---
Healing shamans do get a surprising amount of PvP gear from healing alone like 5/8 T2, Lok'amir, Ragnaros and BWL shield, ZHC etc.
---
Only enhancers really get shafted in most cases.
---
yes you can , you buy game time relax man
---
+1 for Druid
---
They're referred to as being those timezones, whereas EU servers are not. Because they're all the same.
---
Avast ye swabs! Repel the invaders!

I'm using this one. Should still be accurate.
---
Dental hygiene wasn't huge for sailers.  You can't say the v sound without teeth...  So it became lubbers.

It’s leading from Draenor into Azeroth, I believe! The original Dark Portal from WC1
---
I just made my hunter and I am fully prepared to take the blame for everything that might go wrong. It's our job and I accept that.
---
I want to level up a warrior and warlock.
---
I'm going to level with a friend (rouge). With which class I wil have the most fun in phase 1 ? Im interested in pve and pvp.
---
&gt; Vanilla WoW was a game designed to cultivate social interaction between players who share a common goal. 
---
And this addon helps facilitate that social interaction.
---
It doesn't require anyone else to use it. A previous version communicated with others who also used the addon, but that functionality has been removed.
---
Wanted to name our guild this. Or Return of the King.
---
I made an undead rogue and got the name Strangler yesterday, suprised it was still available
---
Best.reply.ever!
---
Iirc I did this more than once due to having 100% mount on my main and spending most time there, it was worth it.
---
I remember showing people how to get to this spot and blowing their minds..telling them to keep it a secret and only tell trustworthy people..good times lol
---
I'm not worried about me, I feel I am competent enough to perform adequately and reasonable enough to not get super tilted by a video game.
---
But I have witnessed a lot of people in this game that aren't one or the other and plenty of case where they are neither.
---
Life is crazy. 
---
Roommate has a good friend who was just hit a few days ago. Bad shape but still alive.
---
About 6 years ago my cousin hit the side of a van going 50mph because she decided to turn into a parking lot from the middle lane. Took him almost a year to fully recover.
---
Be safe out there &lt;3
---
I'm surprised someone replied to this. Are you so excited for classic you're going through every post?
---
Smite and Holy Fire are more what I was referring to.  I actually don't know what Mana Burn is, but I mentioned the prospect of another damage tree mostly just to cover it as a technicality.
---
I'm gonna be on Stalagg but thanks for offering!
---
I see.  Feels kind of aggressive, but it's your community so your rules.  Thanks for the information.
---
played until lvl 40 on light's hope then switched to Kronos...still there now.
---
never had a problem with SM...Menethil on the other hand got so bad GMs had to be involved.
---
when geared lvl 60s get bored ,it gets ugly.
---
I'm rolling a priest because I wanted to do the same class I did as a kid, just doing it right this time. The main reasons are purely community encounter driven. I love rolling up on someone solo who looks like they're about to die, restoring them to full health, and leaving them buffed up. I also love how difficult it is to heal dungeons compared to retail. Mana management is my specialty and I love it when I'm with a terrible pug and they just keep chain pulling and I know most other healers wouldn't have been able to keep up.
---
If you are a hunter without engineering you're doing it wrong
---
Mind sharing that spec?
---
Classic did not reimplement the Sentry Totem bug.
---
have a goddamn upvote
---
The fact is the game will die without updates, so if the player base is high enough after phase 5 I believe they will add new content. But its Blizzard so who the fuck knowws.
---
It's $5/mo those. No guide is worth a subscription amount like that. Hell that's just a little under 1/2 the cost of Netflix monthly sub. And you get better value with Netflix. It's not about the cost, it's about price vs performance especially when there's pretty decent free guides available.
---
Okay, it's just kind of discouraging to read that people wouldn't want me as apart of their 40 man because I really like elemental shaman.
---
Thems the ones
---
what shamans have rez
---
Teleportation has it's risks!
---
School starts so it dont matter :D
---
Luck
---
And yet it was still implemented in the first place.
---
Wholesome.
---
You really should say spoilers in the title of you’re worried about spoilers.
---
I've been saying this since I was invited to the WotLK beta.
---
True and the detection methods are now a lot better.
---
Look guys i did the USA does the date wrong meme xDDD
---
Iron grenades are cheap and spammable.  Ranged attack that hits semi hard and has a short duration stun.  Equally useful as an interrupt as it is to prevent enemy player from interrupting you.  
---
Reflector trinkets:  Shadow, frost, fire reflectors somewhat short cooldown that make you immune and reflect the corresponding magic type for 5sec.  Basically required by some classes to be able to fight a warlock or mage.  
---
Sapper charge.  Deals something like 600 damage to both you and everyone within 30 yards of you.  On its own this seems quite poor, but if you coordinate 5-10 people to all use them at once you can wipe multiple raid groups that are stacking in some tight location like BRM.  
---
Net of Matic:  Trinket that roots your target for 10sec, granted this trinket can backfire and root you isntead but on classes with root breaks, like palaidn, druid, rogue, mage there is very little downside on a backfire.  
---
Discombobulator ray:  Instant cast and cheap, counts as a polymorph effect so it dismounts players and applies a small slow.  
---
Gnomish Death ray:  Channeled ranged attack on a 5min cooldown.  It does damage to you, but far more damage to your opponent.  The damage done is semi random such that it can potentially 1shot people.  Particularly good on paladin who can use it while immune to avoid the self damage.  Useful on other healers who can outheal the self damage and gives them ability to kill enemy players.
---
Mind Control cap:  30min CD mindcontrols a player for 30sec.  Very useful for things like capping on a defender in AB, or for mind controlling enemy healer in a fight so you can kill his ally.  
---
Goblin rocket helm:  You charge and sap a target for 30sec, very similar to mind control cap except added bonus that it can be used by melee as a mobility tool and gap closer.  
---
Rocket boots:  Sprint that does not share cooldown with potions so can be used in WSG and comboed with Free action potion, or a followup sprint potion to quickly cap a flag.  
---
General bomb useage can be used to augment players damage.  Also useful to knock people off of flag caps as bombs can be thrown while silenced and used by classes that lack traditional aoe.  
---
Teleporter  Tanaris/Everlook teleport saves a lot of time when travelling cross continent.  Tanaris is great for access to BWL/DM/AQ.  Everlook seemingly isnt as strong, but as horde sometimes you will be required to set hearth to kargath, so everlook gives you a somewhat short flight to orgrimmar if you get stuck without a mage portal.  
---
im pretty sure i missed some stuff that is good
---
Im starting new lets gooo
---
$800 on a laptop, $8 on poop socks
---
For the most part you're gonna need the full 40. You could get away with a few missing people on MC once everyone is geared up but there is a lot of roles that need to be filled.
---
New games are so large mostly because of cut scenes, videos and giant uncompressed sound files.
---
Classic doesn't have any of these, so it is much smaller.
---
But why prioritize herbalism over mining early? Doesnt mining earn more money?
---
These are very cool! Nicely done.
---
Thanks for the invitation! Sadly I don't speak any French at all
---
The exception being skinning the target mob, you could get sapped by a rogue and they had enough time to steal the skin. Happens a lot with nodes but that's all part of the fun.
---
Imo wotlk was good, it died after that
---
I'm a noob, meant to say dont join full servers..
---
Definitely a good watch
---
Majority of the streamers are going Faerlina. So anything besides that and you'll be avoiding streamers
---
Priest tank super viable, mind blast creates lots of threat. Bubbles/Inner Fire. It works.
---
Praise the sun!
---
I like that though it would actually have to use skill..but you know I think the mana stuff makes sense lol how would they be able to cast arcane shot without magic 😂
---
3pm pacific. So thats 5pm central, correct?

Hunter:
---
\+ arguably the most engaging PvE rotation in the game
---
\+ capable of soloing elites and certain dungeon bosses
---
\+ diverse and powerful world PvP toolkit
---
\+ consistent aesthetics due to having viable tier sets
---
\+ fun and immersive pet mechanics
---
\+ can mind control people off cliffs using Gnomish Mind Control Cap and Eyes of the Beast
---
\+ often avoids paying repair bills thanks to Feign Death
---
\- horrible class if you're bad at the game
---
\- can't jack off to epeen meters past BWL

You need an EU account to play on the EU servers.

&gt;  I mainly will like to be in wpvp and questing but I would also like to raid since I never did in vanilla. Is it a mistake to roll hunter?
---
Hunters are godlike in Wpvp and godlike in solo questing.

You, like most players will probably not raid much in AQ40/Naxx, where Hunter damage falls off, Hunter DPS is competitive in BWL and especially in MC.

Autolooting alone will apparently save around 5 hours of gameplay according to Joana (although i think that's excessive myself) - people are way more practised now as well. The people who beat Joanas time wont have anyone their level range to help them either. Itll be sub 4 days on launch I'm sure.

Why would the shaman be a nightfall bitch every single raid and only get scraps of loot? He'd get the same as everyone else. Only the most progressive guilds will hold back loot and gear up the people who can use it the best first.... And they won't be bringing a nightfall enhancement shaman.
---
im new to classic but i Know what i want. My plan is to hit the ground running and delve into the pve endgame, i know my race, class, and professions and all are picked with both fun and optimization in mind.
---
Its just how I want to play and will have most fun doing.
---
My guess is an unexpected shutdown in the first week, three tuesday shutdowns, then no more.
---
Should we tell OP nobody forces him to play anything else, but classic?
---
This sounds like a good option, thanks I'll check it out
---
Damn, didn't think of that. Thanks for the tip.
---
I don't think you understand by unecessary. It adds nothing. Everything on there is simple enough without the addon. You post something like "lf tank for dm", wait for whispers, or if you're that concerned about trade being cluttered, which it always is, just pay attention a hit closer to the chat. It is not that hard. This addon does nothing worthwhile, and should be abandoned.

They should make bigger guns.

They updated the website, Incendius is officially east coast.

11 PM on the 26th for the UK just so people see, was the best surprise seeing that today, was preparing to play at 11 PM on the 27th haha.
---
Nah, I downvoted because of this comment:
---
&gt; No old bugs from years gone by will be in Classic
---
It's just a factually incorrect statement. There's a long list of bugs they intentionally re-introduced in Classic that they considered a part of the 1.12 gameplay. But they are picking and choosing which ones to re-implement and which ones to keep as fixed based on how core they feel they are to the "Vanilla experience."
---
So these are EU English realms at the moment. Sorry Blizzard but I'm not into Roleplay... 
---
Imagine how many more people will join tomorrow for the launch as well... this is ridiculous...
---

I expect a 3 day ban at minimum for first offense.

Not required until endgame, however they are a lot of fun and I would recommend doing at least a few.

My main is a priest, has been ever since I rerolled in Cata, don't think I'll play one now, at least not at first but thank you.
---
Bunch of little boot licking zoom zooms in this thread. No longer are you allowed to complain about unwarranted changes. You're just an entitled consumer.
---
I feel like any individual expansion is going to get dull after a while, and they’ll have to move on in some way. Whether it be the next expansion in line, or a new path for the old game.
---
Either way, I’m really interested to see how classic progresses. I would love to replay everything up to and including wrath.
---
Paladin tanks, Shaman DPS, Shadow Priests. There are sometime other classes which can Rez
---
From a Raid PoV they can't really be warriors. The inability to Not Parry/Block thus not being able to reach CTC really does at the end of the day put bears in a bad spot. You can still easily get Gibbed Due to Crushing Blows and Parryy haste as a Druid Tank.
---
0:00 is Stockholm also.
---
As others have said, you are in the best position to play this as a new player. Just don't let the initial rush, queue times and mob tagging get to you -- it will be rough at first, but eventually it normalizes and you'll get to experience what us bitter vets experienced 15 years ago.
---
Better if you only allow yourself to play after you workout at the gym
---
It's pretty even overall. Undead would slightly edge out Troll in PvP and Troll would slightly edge out Troll in PVE. Honestly might sound dumb but I would go with the one you think looks cooler and has better looking casting animations. I was stuck with the same dilemma for Priest and realized I don't like how armor looks on undead and don't like that every spell (short of Mindflay) has the exact same casting animation where as Troll gets more diversity. So subjectively I like Trolls aesthetically over Undead. I'm going to be looking at my character for 100s if not 1000+ hours so I'm going with what looks better.

Because it was an addon for retail to begin with.

My dad moved around for work, so a few places.  Lafayette, Muncie, NWI area.  I live in Chicago now.

lol you're so awesome man! Really the view from that higher ground you are on.
---
Im ok with stealing others work (even though it was free when I did get the PDF). Especially when that work is on a subscription model.
---
Sure, we don’t know for sure. However, there is always new people playing WoW. The new servers will fill up. Personally, I’d rather move to the new realm than be on a mega realm. I can afford to xfer eventually if I needed to.
---
Zygor is the way for leveling in Classic! So pumped!

 andA Boomer or Baby Boomer is anyone born between the years of 1944 and 1964. However, in internet culture, the term Boomer has been stretched to include anyone probably 25+ as being "old" by Zoomer standards. And a Zoomer being literal fucking kids &lt;222 or something.
---
I'm glad he plays wow. If he didnt I think he'd kill people for fun
---
I would go Hunter or Lock. Both are fun classes and are both very good for solo play.

It was an interesting observation, that guy is the one "very fun at parties"

Easiest way to avoid this is to not let anyone die.
---
Probably. But that means the server will be less likely to be dead in 4 months. Which would you rather have, queues for a couple weeks after launch or a dead server 4 months after launch?
---
Yeah, because it's totally IMPOSSIBLE that I leveled a rogue during the past 14 months, isn't it?
---
But thanks for getting so angry that you sifted through over a year of my posting history just to insult me like a 4chan troll. Reported :)
---
Well that's what I mean by "done." I checked it out maybe two or three years ago and yeah there was still an active community but IIRC they had just pushed or were about to push the very last content patch.
---
I'm looking to RP with a friend for the first time ever. Any good add-ons to help the experience? E.g. slow down the quest log so you have to read it and stuff
---
Imagine calling an expansion Battle for Azeroth, hyping the fight between horde and alliance and then.....  
---
....there is pretty much no wPvP. Horde and Alliance are even on different islands.
---
You were warned
---
Cata came after wotlk though
---
Hey man, I really wanted to play an Enhancement shaman in Classic, but the reality is that if you want to do just a little bit of serious raiding in Classic, the same restrictions that were put on raiders in Vanilla is also something we will have to deal with now.
---
I'm usually part of the no-changes crowd, but I do think Blizzard would have done well to tweak some numbers (and only numbers, not design) to make the forgotten specs like Ret and Enh viable in endgame content. But I'm also wary of the slippery slope that might create.
---
noob
---
Region rat!  Good man
---
I live in the middle of nowhere unfortunately (Wales) so that kinda thing is quite rare around these parts. One day if I manage to build a following and all that good stuff i'd be happy to give that a go though!
---
Play on whitemane bro it’s cool kids and then others we don’t talk about
---
Lol wasn't the real money makers the material professions I.E. Herbalism, Mining, etc.?
---
But since retail is kinda small in terms of subs that part is even smaller. There's probably more people that liked WoW back then than people that love it currently.
---
Not saying Classic will outperform retail, but considering how small WOW has gotten theres loads of untapped potential fans out there.
---
"Hertog jan"

Of fucking course they're dutch. From the country that gave us legal weed and prostitutes. now comes the next rad thing: WoW gaming until your heart gives out.

have any of your many guides gone through your approach to shaman keybinds/qbard set up? /u/Melderon
---
I remember running with a Boomkin tank in Scholo one time. Wild shit is sort of viable in Vanilla
---
Just don't have an obscene/immature name and most people won't give a fuck.
---
I guess start [here](https://youtu.be/Y4jAL13omQo)
---
2-6 hours.....do not pick a PVP server. All 3 classes you picked are fun, but the mage has quite a bit of utility that will give you more fun per hour.
---
I think having this full realms iz "guage" enough
---
I'm in a similar situation, full time job, wife, 4 month old. I know I won't have as much time as I used to, probably won't do much raiding, but I can still get dungeon gear, pvp, and build twinks. Leveling will take me a while for sure, probably a couple months to hit 60, maybe less with a few good binge sessions.
---
Alchemist Stone, better Healing/Mana Pots, transmutes for $$
---
Im down with that, it's not important enough to justify picking a race for it as a tank. Regardless of the impact of racial abilities you spend so much time looking at your character I think being happy with how you look is the most important thing.  But if you were already going orc axe is gonna be worth using.  We are in a build of the game in which hit cap is actually 9% unless you have plus weapon skill from what I understand, so it's pretty significant.

I pity the people that took the day off from work to sit in a queue all day :)
---
Is this option only for the player or everyone will see me without the helmet?
---
Preinstall the game. You can already do that. There is no way to permanently screw up you character. You can reset your talents for ingame money. Dont use any quest helper addons. Read the quests. Explore the world at your pace. Dont read or use any leveling guides.
---
thank you &lt;3
---
I'm going to roll on a new server if the queues are extensive when I get on to play. I myself can't afford a multi-hour queue.
---
On a Noggenfogger and a prayer. 
---
In all seriousness, I'm considering getting going Goblin Engy on my Rogue this time around. A) Sapper Charge B) Don't have to have someone else craft my XL Cables C) just have to immediately eat to avoid death when Everlook teleporter fails. Sure, it's not as nice as quickly getting in the Ballpark of ONY and AQ, but that's what Warlocks are for.
---
Ah. Im in South Texas myself now but ive spent most of my days in more mid South Indiana (columbus / Indy / areas).

Hey guys! 
---
My gf just created a blizzard account in order to download the Classic client. But she wasnt able to download the Classic client. Does she need to buy the vanilla game or only a subscription?
---
As I said in an earlier post, mining is making you go out of you way to get things, where as Skinning and Herbalism will be part of your journey so less off leveling time to perform the actions.
---
Nobody can memorize all the the optimal paths and quests.
---
Anyone have a list of importable guides / suggestions of the fastest Horde speed leveling guide? Preferably with Undead start
---
Honestly them doing away with tiered progression (along with modern class design and too much QOL) is my main gripe with retail.
---
Love it, I also love Dwarves and created my [own](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/cvcoe0/i_am_also_excited_and_also_painted_my_dwarf_a/) dwarf tribute. Mine is more what I imagine my dwarf to be like in games like WoW. Constantly drunk but happy.
---
Yah it mentioned like $50-$100 pay for beta testing a whole guide? Damn.
---
I played warlock in TBC so it's close, definitely enjoyed all the class specific stuff but I'm not sure I want to do that again. Not my first character anyway.

Sometimes brown, sometimes green, always hearty.

Pandaria is somehow my 3rd most favorite expansion, right after WoTLK and Classic.

Could put BFA there instead and youd have this sub behind the players.

Will it classic as you said in your post search for the add on and it will tell you if the add on is up to date for classic or not and if so it will give you a redirect link to download it
---
she is riding the dwarf's pet  xD
---
Don’t care its not like you actually won anything your just a troll
---
Most of the pre bis guides have alternative items that are easier to get. If your flair indicates your main on classic. As a warrior you'll need your pre bis to tank and fury warrs keep more than half of their prebis into BWL so you'll want it either way.
---
Haven't tested it but in change log says:
---
* Fix other Classic errors.
---
Make it a drinking game for a real fun time
---
this should be the other way around tbh.

Hahaha.  Good one.  Im definitely out of the selective service age.  Oh and they were never friends with Tom.

My guess is they will be filled quickly though; by people joining in at launch or within the first couple days.

1. You clearly can't understand what I'm saying, the guy is telling me there will be more servers tomorrow to which I respond that I'm so glad I had a chance to reserve my name on a server that will be actually playable, unfortunately you don't seem to know what sarcasm is.
---
2. [Wrong.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBr_EbxGdk)
---
I hope they go in a new direction, while keeping the spirit of classic
---
Friends don't let friends play Retribution Paladins.
---
No I recall them specifically saying that it would *not* be on the loot table in an interview with the lead devs on the last Classicast this past Friday. It was in passing when talking about loot tables with things like Unarmored Epic Mounts.
---
By the sounds of everyone shitting on Blizzard for playing it conservatively I am gonna guess they want dead realms down the line just so they can have some short sighted schadenfreude. 
---
can't wait for that to happen and for blizz to come out with cross realm battle groups and sharding to have to deal with the fact no one on those dead servers will be willing to transfer under any circumstance but still wanna bitch about everything
---
Dead  is such  a freaking massive exaggeration.
---
These servers are huge add to that they are going to take away layers.
---
For me it is more possible to ahve an overpopulation with the extiction of layers..rather than the servers be dead
---
That's very good. But I'll always be a Horde fan. :) You should try your hand at Undead. I'd love to see more of an actual dead looking Forsaken around.
---
It wouldn’t really fix anything, because then the dome would just be camped.
---
This dude does great videos in general. I watch all his SCP uploads.
---
What would be your FC/Resto druid spec? Would you not focus on healing touch talents? Something like 13/38 Feral/Resto?
---
ITT: People still not understanding that Vanilla WoW is a bizzaro cheesefest that will let you get away with just about any weird build, group comp, etc. you want to play with.
---
I mean, you'd have to be quite a silly idiot to try to use ilvl as any sort of gatekeeper for classic when some of the Bis shit for some classes is incredibly low ilevel.  Gearscore/ilevel just wouldn't work in classic unless they went through every item in the game assigning it custom values for the addon.
---
Nah, it's DM
---
I said Im not paying for a subscription. Which is all I said. Never said he owed me the guide. And yeah I moved the conversation away because all you could do was throw insults rather than just having a conversation. 
---
Your train of thought seems to be that, because I said I dont want to pay $5 a month you took it as me saying I'm entitled to his guide and should get it for free. Which just isnt true. Ive said in multiple comments I'd be happy paying for it, just not monthly. I also said I found another guide.
---
I dont need to defend my actions from you lol I dont really care what you think about me giving out his guide TO ALL WHO PM ME. 
---
I just worry about you being so angry about what others are doing with their time and money. Not good for blood pressure.
---
Lowkey I want it for tanking.
---
Yeah Roguesonly get one so Agi is basically 100% better for them. So leather with strength favored would be more for druids.
---
I will warn you that anybody close minded enough to exclude an ele shaman will also exclude a shadow priest. It's a certain mentality that people seem to have developed while on private servers, and given that the rest of us haven't played the game in 15 years they are the most vocal part of the community. 
---
Ele shamans, enh shamans, spriests, boomkins, feral etc all have contributions that plain dps really doesn't bring. They are hybrid damage/utility so they fall behind others in damage. Shamans have some amazing buffs, to the point that it is optimal to have 1 in each group, 8 overall in the raid. You don't want all of those shamans to be resto, because you have other healers as well and mana tide is wasted on a melee group. So enh/ele shamans absolutely do have a place in raids, even in the most optimized groups. 
---
My advice to you is to ask when you join a guild whether or not you'll get a spot as that spec, that will save you a lot of time and trouble. Also be wary of loot council guilds unless you absolutely trust the guild, because any personal bias against a class will come out during loot distribution. If you want to find a guild early, there are server guild recruitments ongoing on reddit. You can find your servers subreddit and scroll through a list of guilds until you find one that is promising, reach out to them and see if it's one that's for you.
---
The factions are more or less balanced. You should pick based on the aesthetics you prefer.
---
I don't think there was a good solution to this honestly. I think this caught them off guard, but even if they wanted to respond, there isn't a lot they could do without having significant downsides of dead/unhealthy servers down the road. It's hard to gauge because everyone knows there will indeed be significant drop off, but how much? It's unprecedented so we'll see. The best thing to do is just expect that there's a very good chance you and I won't get to play tomorrow and it will be very stiff the first week. After that, things will get better. Patience will be good for everyone's blood pressure.
---
i'm with you bro, that would make the classic experience even greater &lt;3
---
Real hero right here. I'm amazed m8!

It detected if you were in combat, toggled show helm, then when you left combat it toggled again. It was called RPhelm or something.

The raid above Blackrock Spire.

This was a thing in old-school Dungeons and Dragons. If you were tasked to get some hide from some animal-monsters, you had better use blunt weapons to take them down. Any kind of slashing / stabbing attack would ruin the hides.
---
Yes, they'll open more at the last minute which will not give guilds or groups of friends enough time to coordinate moving to a new server.
---
Looks fine to me. (On blam server)
---
&gt;  This is a competitive PvP list, not world PvP.
---
So premade?
---
You can just keep your names, tomorrow with new servers they removed 3 character names limit. It is 10 chars per realm now, 50 total

Rogue is good bc bleed remove and magic remove, really solid combo w vanish. Also hunter again for snare remove basically a posthaste, not bad at all. Bout it

You could resurrect them if they released. You just had to activate and then click the corpse. Instead of clicking their frames and using res.

I agree someone will obliterate the time he set but not his record as that cannot ever be broken since that game will never exist again.

Reading some peoples reaction to this is absolute gold. I salute your calm responding to them OP.

---
Thanks, I’ve been doing some research and now I’ve decided to go herbalism while leveling and alch at 60!
---
Absolutely :)
---
Ya know, I’m genuinely curious how many are full because people are just making a character on multiple realms. I’m not sayin the hype isn’t there, but I’m wondering if that’s considered in the status calculation or not
---
What’s the hurt in trying! :D
---
But would they be better then a human mage
---
Not realy no. It’s as good as instant
---
Yup.
---
Deus Vult
---
While I’m sure it is possible, (through turn-in quests and grinding to farming rep) it is likely not feasible or easy for a fresh character/account. 
---
From memory, doing all the Night elf leveling areas gets you most of the way though revered, but that’s by 60 not 40.
---
how about a system where you can start in vanilla and stay as long as you want, then you press a button to progress to the next expansion and stay there however long you want.. for every expansion. you could raid progress throughout all of wow that way with your guild, at your own pace. that is, if they are creating servers for every expansion, why not
---
*What a long, strange trip it's been. been.*

Nothing to do with WoW, but wuts the difference between British broccoli and “normal” broccoli?

OP:  FFS Blizzard, all realms except one are high or full.

Also OP:  Only has reserved names on the two most overpopulated servers.

Might be difficult early on but you can get the Gravestone Scepter as early as 18
---
Yo, if u open menu and then go to interface or somthing keybindings and u will find a way to keybind them. Just scroll down. Like "top left actionbars" 1- 12" 
---
And top right actionbar
---
There is a way pm if u cant find it.
---
You need to keybind them yourself.
---
Default they don't have hotkeys but you can go into the options menu and give them keybinds, yes.
---
Definitely... you don’t need the nostalgia because this will BE the nostalgia years to come as you’re it’s your first time playing.
---
If anything classic will be better for you than to those returning (if you enjoy wow as an mmo on a whole). 
---
Hope you pick it up and give it a go!
---
You'll have more fun playing with your friends, even if you pick a shitty class like Druid.
---
May get downvoted into oblivion but I really hope Blizz Devs don't release BC. Hopefully they create more content in Classic. Nagrand was absolutely beautiful but strayed too far from Vanilla philosophy.
---
yes you do

You’re stoned. He just threw for 4500 yds and 39 TD last season.

Watch them all or it won't be near as good. There's just too many details they bring up/make jokes about from the previous movies.

Maybe, but we're all in different time-zones so it's a good idea to switch to an NA server to get a head start.

No they won't. At the start of a. Expansion no one has gold to drop on overpriced lower level mats. And with the influx of players the lower zones are flooded and ah supply is at an all time high. Both reasons alone bring cost down, both reasons together and the price is barely above vendor.
---
The prophecy is real
---
Thanks.
---
ah, awesome!

TFT has been my waiting game

I mostly won’t play anything. One last family day before launch.
---
Private server

usually people will say grab skinning for extra vendor gold to help with mount at 40 and the gathering profession that will help supplement the crafting profession you plan on having at 60. So I'll probably do skinning/mining and swap skinning with engineering. I'll keep up mining best I can but if its slowing me down too much i'll just come back with a mount at 60 and level it up that way.

Heroes of the Storm, but not a lot cause I'm reading Wheel of Time as well.

---
Do you have ANY proof of this, all I see are people saying this with nothing to back it up. Regardless of him "lying" or not, it's 5 fucking dollars for something he spent a lot time on, who the fuck cares if he changed his mind.

i played in vanilla, everyone i knew called it VC. this was horde side though, maybe alliance called it differently.

Twas the night before classic and I don't have a video card. Rip

Yes..

Thanks man! It's alright though, I'm excited for Classic! No salty guy on the internet is taking that away from me.

Mage is so much more than "just a ranged dps". Not only do you have great DPS and CC, you will also provide the group with intellect and act as a food/water vendor for all. +portals!

If you are primarily casting Shadow Bolt in a dungeon, raid, or PvP, you’re a destruction warlock.

Q situation seems like a mess if it's over 30 minutes.  As far as I know, you get booted if you are in q for over 30 minutes.  So once the q gets that long, it becomes random on whether you will get in or not because people will be constantly getting booted from the q.

The best players on classic will be the best players from retail lol

This is what I was looking for thanks!

I definitely see what you mean. You may have made the right decision to stay on Herod, but I'm gonna risk it and jump on one of the new servers for sure.
---
Laughs in bank alts
---
Honestly the best game for me is games where i can hop in and out anytime, like Overwatch, upcoming call of duty modern warfare, battlefield 5, Warcraft Reforged. I look very much forward to Warcraft Reforged since I never played Warcraft 3. But i don't understand why they didn't release it before WoW Classic. I think I will play WoW Classic anyway and try to find my balance in it, but most likely I will quit after a while because the grind is too long and probably i spend too much time in it, time that I should invest in my family and real life stuff =/
---
&gt; It is. Signed, a mage main that played throughout vanilla. 
---
Shit y'all. He played vanilla, he got us.
---
in classic, the premade lvl 40 char CAME with the saber mount. They didn't grind for it
---
Ya but I’m gonna be the one to make it work lol
---
I don't think 4 new servers is enough.
---
gorgeous
---
As everyone said.
---
Its possible to keybind them you nust need to go into your key bindings menu and find the corresponding action bar to bind.
---
Yes. I did this way back when with a human priest because I wanted the night elf mount
---
I’ll be playing alliance on Gehennas EU, name Jazz. If you play there, add me and I’ll be sure to help you if you need anything! :)

Thanks for all that it sounds complicated but I guess it is with barely any game knowledge.

Very nice! Straightforward and very helpful. See you at launch!
---
Every single expansion since WotLK has spiked population in the beginning then fallen off soon after.

That's pretty much how all games go when launching. The hype crowd falls off once the game does come out.

As someone who plans to tank, I could see myself tanking stuff I don't need for reserved orbs or a gold fee or something. I don't mean to sound too mercenary, I look at it like this: I will need gold for consumables and repairs. I could spend a few hours farming and the group could spend a few hours LF tank, or I could spend that time helping them get their stuff done and get my gold that way.
---
Just mind control some elite guard to slaughter noobs in like Southshore or something when ur 60.
---
Is that a tame impala album in the background?
---
There is no concrete info other than Blizzard have said they are keeping it under advisement as they wait and see how quickly stuff is conquered.

Fun fact: not everyone playing the game is in a massive group.

I'm worried Grobbulus is gonna be filled with people that dont care for RP and just want to avoid the long que times

Blizz is fucking stupid...to wait after launch to open more....ffs blizz get over yourselves...classic is more desired than retail....more servers you dumbfucks

I tried playing retail.  After about 30 minutes I just logged out.  God the current version is fucking garbage.  I think I’m just going to watch a movie or something.

I wonder what Blizzard is thinking right now seeing how many servers are already full.

I'm not agitated. What he said was completely right. Don't be dumb.
---
It's a huge set of dungeons that takes place across like 10 levels (alliance have quests there too!), a lot of people will do it on alliance- you should already have the flightpath to hillsbrad so the journey isnt that long, you will probably die more at the entrance fighting horde than on the way theere.
---
What's STV?

And also with corpse running do I lose my gear?

And yeah I guess your right it's better to have both
---
u mad bro?

I'm not a min maxer at all. But even for a non min maxer, there's a lot of useful trinkets in the game that you probably want to pick up. I never said to pick the trinket over the staff, I don't give a shit. Do what you want. But the guy above said to not pick the trinket because of the 30 sec equipment cooldown and taking up bag space, which is a bad reason. Many players are going to be swapping trinkets a lot. 
---

Sorry it’s not a joke. I never really played vanilla and mages today don’t bring much other than damage. Thanks for the input man!
---
No they don’t
---
What Weaslelord said is very accurate. At times it can feel very grindy and there are points where you think that the quests are kind of nonsense. But what is nice is once you finish a town and look back at how you helped them handle the gang that was harassing them, return supplies lost, and other objectives. That’s what really gets me. Sometimes the present can feel rough but when you’re running away from the town towards your next objective, looking back, you feel like you are doing some good. 
---
That’s what drew me in to the game, the world and the lore.
---
Its a leper dwarf. Ironforge must be purged.
---
East coast RP PvP!
---
PvE is a good place to start, you probably won't want to be handled by a higher level character of the opposing faction. Unless you think think that's fun, then go PvP. 
---
As far as class to play, they're all viable so choose whatever you think will be fun: tanking, dps or healing. Your choice. Some classes are straight dps like mages or rogues, some can do both and others can do all three but not the best like a pure healer/dps/tank. Just choose what you feel best fits your play style.
---
Did anyone try the barrens to westfall spirit rez skip on this client? Id hate to waste so much time if it doesnt work.

Does it make sense to start on a pve server tho as a newer player on the mmo genre.

Very cool :)
---
Nothing to be added to wow made me more envious than when titan's grasp got added

ah come on re rolling is fun the grass is always greener on the other side you will be mage within 14 days

Please do not do that.

Okay, thank you for the advice! I'll definitely do what I actually want and roll ele sham.

---
yea these but they are not optimized for classic. any idea where to find them for classic?
---
I played on RP-PvP realms in vanilla and most people going about their business were not in character. RP was generally around 'specific' areas (similar to how people go dogging in parks). If you don't want to RP you should be fine (unless the culture in classic is very different). 
---
When I moved from RP-PvP to straight PvP one of the main things I missed was that people usually had decent names rather than pwnedlól

---
I'm about 99% certain I want to roll a Druid, but I'm very self-conscious about endgame content. I very much intend to do the lvl 60 dungeons and get into raiding. I've heard people are reluctant to take Druids as healers in dungeons because of their lack of out of combat rez, and raids seems to favor Priests with maybe 1-2 druids.
---
Am I overreacting? Should I roll druid, with endgame content in mind?
---
TIL: There is a great big white line running smack bang through the middle of Paris! O\_o
---
It's ridiculously little data usage.
---
Beetle juice
---
Game was good then, game is good now. I dont get how it being an old game makes it not as good anymore. Mario 64 came out almost a decade earlier and people still play the hell out of it.
---
For pug groups all that matters is your class and level really. Hunters get groups, but you'll have to be a bit patient since you're a DPS. There isn't really any "critically needed" dps, typically pug groups are trying to find people who don't loot compete with people already in the party.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  
---
    
---
Beats twitch-speak at least.
---
Hearthstone
---
Thinking you're correct! I dont get off until 1 tomorrow. Which puts me even an hour behind the new server launches.
---
The pet classes (hunter and warlock) are good choices; they do have a high skill cap if played at maximum potential, but they are relatively easy to level.  Druids are easy to level as well, but you'll probably be healing in endgame content (there are exceptions).  Mages are also strong levelers, they have great utility and are often sought after in groups, they do well in endgame as well.  For "fun", I would say go with whatever speaks to you, if you pick a class just because you think it's going to be easy or quick to level, you might lose interest.

---
I'll admit, the gameplay is a little dull *at times*. Leveling up from 1-10, especially, can be a little boring mechanically speaking. But it's fun to hit 10, get your first talent point, start getting some really crucial abilities, and play with other people. Then at level 17-18 as Alliance or 13-15 as Horde, you start doing dungeons, which really test your communication/teamwork skills.
---
If I can give advice, play what feels right, although be aware that some roles may be less desired than others at max level. Try everything, try healing, try a different class if you don't like the first one you choose, do every dungeon, visit every zone that you can. It's simply fun to explore the awesome open world, and more fun to team up with friends you meet along the way and run some dungeons.
---
yes. and they are full of tauren
---
Not everyone uses them. Just a way to set them up ahead of time. Really isn't that complicated either.

---
Oh okay thank you Well i guess im on the same boat then! Ty
---
Yes. Are they as good as priests? Overall, no. But a guild is still going to take them because they have good utility and buffs, and it's also a lot easier to gear out a mix of priest, sham/pally, and druid, than it is to just try to gear out 2 of them. When you're progressing through content, I'd take a fully geared druid over a 3/8 priest any day, and once you have it on farm it doesn't really matter what you bring. So yes, there is considerable value in being a resto druid.
---
Yeah, it’s crazy at how many scrubs camp STV at 60 banking low levels, but then immediately backpeddle up when a 60 comes to help. It’s like they need to get their frustration out on low levels because they can’t face equal level players.
---
You did the export/import from a text lump?  I have mine saved and have moved it between various versions with only having to fix a few things.
---
Happy Classic Eve!
---
Yeah, people generally do deadmines runs. 
---
The drop rates may vary (as the classic databases may be wrong), but the defias rapier and blackwater cutlasses both disenchant for greater magic essences (can be broken down into 3 lessers), and have 4-5% drop rates on deadmines elites. Unfortunately, smite is too high a level to use his drops for the lowbie wands, but he still drops a weapon every time and 80% of them are not useless for disenchanting and the other vendors well. 
---
Note, this is specific to deadmines. a lot of the dungeons in the game don't have huge amounts of common weapons like deadmines does, and WC/ragefire are both pretty bad as they either have no good drop tables on trash mobs, or are heavily geared towards leather armor.
---
dont worry! we are all excited to play, dont worry about returning players racing to 60 w their plans. we all have shared the same experiences you will &lt;3

Not gonna lie this made me hungry as fk and I just had breakfast. Lol
---
Bad idea anyways to pick gathering profs expecting to make money on a fresh server since there’d be no money in the economy yet.
---
That’s what I’m saying. If the servers are full just for names, they are going to be even more full on release day. 
---
Op was trying to say “ppl saving names arnt the same as players so the numbers are a lie”
---
If you're going to do alot of PvP Orc will probably be worth it. Works well as a PvE DPS too.
---
Easy enough to play with Undeads. The zepplin is right in Durotar and goes to Tirisfal Glades.
---
So I haven't played in about eight years and thus, a little confused. Nowhere in the battle.net client can I see that I've registered my old keys and paid for the base game+expansions, but it gives me the option to start a new subscription (in fact two options, which seems to be the same option? Both says retail and classic?). I assume that means I'm good to go and just need to start the subscription? I don't need to dig out my old boxes with CD keys on them?

prob depends on if u want melee or range

I got some addons, but I think Im going to just go with the basic UI for the first day or two and let the dust settle.  Might also reduce having to login/logout and wait in queues.

I've got it on my mac
---
I started Hunter at the beginning of TBC and always managed to push Survival spec into top 3 in raids from that expansion on. It was a very complex spec with many melee elements that really boosted your dps. It also really shined in dungeons for most expansions. It was the funnest spec to play because of the awesome variety you had to choose from. Until around cataclysm changed so much, it still remained relevant but was pretty boring.
---
The only reason im alliance :)
---
They better release some new servers soon so people can collaborate with their friends and choose the right servers. Otherwise launch day will be fun for no one.
---
And none of these places have mentioned anything about the TOS, so please, do link a citation.
---
Blizzard already has guild recruitment forums that are relatively active. I’m an east coast player with a 7-3 job so I needed to find a guild with early raiding times. Took an hour or two but ended up finding the perfect guild for what me and my group of friends are looking for.
---
I did yeah.  The only thing I can see is the client places things in places ELVui current doesn’t address.  For example my own nameplate worked fine but the nameplate of a target would actually just be blank save for unclickable raid markers within where the name of the target usually is.
---
Sweet,  I've been looking for something like this!
---
Sounds good!
---
Couldnt make my mind up either so I'm gonna multibox all 3 of my top choices. YOLO or some shit like that.
---
I'll be in my bunk
---
Blizzard said full is several hours or more. High is 1 step below that, although there are varying amounts of high. Skeram just hit high so I imagine it will be on the lower end of high
---
I got the wotlk version. It held up to the expectations I had through reading reviews and broke after a couple of weeks.  
---
Man were they terrible :p
---
If you're not going to be in a hardcore guild or high end pvp premades, play whatever race you gosh darn please.
---
yeah, I reckon on release date the people who didn't pre-make their char will just roll on the realm with the fewest amount of people in the queue.
---
I often see the skin red around the tattoo. Is that because it's newly inked or is it because it's Alliance?
---
It peaked at TBC
---
ill just see how it goes a 10  -15 min queue i can deal with longer then that and ill have to decide how much i really like the names i got. wont be able to try for names on the new server as ill be at work. the plan was to get home at 4 east eat take a shower and then stare at the enter button for an hour
---
Oh yes it is ... it is.
---
Yes, agreed. My thoughts were maybe phase 3, maybe (probably better) phase 4.
---
Definitely not 1 or 2. For the reasons stated - it was not meant to be "BiS" in any stage, it should not overshadow any other "current" content. But still, phase 5 is too far on the "totally irrelevant" scale.
---
&gt; The next raid, pvp, personal achievement, time records, making friends, etc.
---
Probably mining thorium and selling it, tbh. Selling your arcanite CD can also net you some money.

**NAWEST HORDE GROBBULUS(RPPVP)** \- add Durrian#1563 to join/for more info
---
Welcome to join our small group! We have about 10+ so far, just a bunch of online gamer friends. Some veterans, some total newbies to WoW.
---
My favourite was BC, but it was also my first so I could be biased.
---
2v2 arena was my favourite, progression raiding where you did Kara, ZA, Mags, Gruuls, SSC, TK, Hyjal, BT and eventually sunwell was amazing, the community was still pretty solid imo, the class fantasy and rpg elements like rogue poisons being crafted and warlocks getting soul shards, etc were still present.
---
For me my favourite part was raiding though. Instead of one raid done on 2 or 3 or 4 different difficulties with a slight colour change in gear and 1 or 2 new mechanics, you had completely different raids with different bosses and lore and experiences.  Going into BT the first time after finally gearing up enough was an absolute blast. It felt so rewarding after grinding all the prior raids for so long. 
---
I think wrath is when some things started going south especially in terms of raiding. Ulduar did hard modes really well, and ICC was godlike, but the multiple difficulties for the same content got stale. Also ToC was unique, but really stale being in the same room for 90% of it.

BC is my peak of gaming. I’ve never had as much fun playing any games as I had playing BC. However, I’m biased.

After watching a few of these...I wanna see them duel.  That was hype as fuck.

Only for looks, or alts, maybe offspec in phase 5.

I started in MoP, and I loooooved it. WoD was fun at first but the shortage of new content ruined it. Loved Legion, BfA I've played casually even compared to my usual style. I don't hate it as much as most do, it's an "eh" for me. So personally it's

What insane difference does a holy paladin with curse of tongues makes that put them above elemental shaman? Both have a neutered 1.5 second heal, the shamans will be slightly weaker. Shaman can offensive dispel, grounding totem, tremor totem, earth bind totem, wind fury totem, shock, interrupt casts, buff totems, and cleanse poison / disease (disease cleanse is negligible). Holy paladin has a significantly slowed heal, cleanse magic, poison, disease, blessing of freedom, buffs, that physical immunity blessing on high cooldown, bubble, and a stun. The elemental shaman is a support class too in PvP. It’s just a very offensive one with burst. 
---
And if we’re discussing group PvP both have the possibility of a mage or Druid being around to decurse them. Atleast the shaman can potentially try to juke the curse of tongues as grounding will continue to eat the warlocks spells until the warlock sends the pet the kill it, or casts a damaging non dot ability to break the totem. 
---
Curse of tongues is a completely bullshit spell and was for a long time. But if you’re going to use that as an argument you then gotta down tier holy paladin for also being neutered by it without a decurse. And warrior for being neutered by virtually everything without support.
---
It's from a Blizzard Catalog from 2002 I believe.
---
I'm not one to optimize TOO hard, but on my way from 5-60, wands are SO important as a priest. It's like over half my damage, and I don't want to be stuck using a wand thats 30% worse than another one I could get, but am unaware of. They're alright on mages and warriors too, but a wand is a priest's bread and butter.
---
In eden eternal There was a guy in my guild that only wanted to marry someone who was a girl in real life.  He found a girl in guild and knew she was a girl because of vent.  They would play together all the time then a week after marriage the girl posts her rl picture.  She's 400 pounds irl and he divorces her.  I ask why he said its because shes fat.  I am like atleast shes a girl unlike most of the toons.  Divorcing someone cuz theyre fat irl even though you never had plans to meet up.
---
Sorry should have add that!
---
Im in for both
---
You know that other time zone exists right?
---
I have not. That's a good idea
---
ye, feels like they are trying to blame the players for something that should have been fixed by the developers
---
Fuck me sideways, that sounds horrible.

Troll for maximum MOJO, mon

Its always gonna be full at least for the first 6 months if not longer leveling is such a small part of the game just play what you find more fun
---
But... This is how they look like now...
---
&gt;Why laugh
---
Because it's hilarious
---
It’s close enough that you will see different guides recommending different things.  Axe spec and berzerking are both good for threat, stomp is good for dungeons and the extra hp Tauren get is helpful but it isn’t a game changing amount.
---
Here I am going, "blizzard didn't hype this at all, people are going to be trickling in for months as they find out its out."
---
Well, then whatever your preference is.
---
Oh I'm with you! Haha
---
Agreed 👏
---
Burning crusade. It started to decline in wrath when they recycled onyxia and naxx. Rebounded for a final hurrah with ulduar and then circled the drain with ToS. By the time ICC was out, I had already quit. Reactivated for cataclysm, leveled 4 60s in a month and decided it just didn’t feel right at all anymore. 
---
Burning crusade had a mix of everything that made WoW great. The community of vanilla with improved class balance, continued the story of wc3, only one raid difficulty, no LFR, no transmog.
---
I bet Nethergarde Keep is full when I get home.
---
I basically just followed the tutorial for making retail addons here:
---
https://www.wowhead.com/guide=1949/wow-addon-writing-guide-part-one-how-to-make-your-first-addon
---
then followed the Ace3 tutorial to add configuration options: https://wow.gamepedia.com/WelcomeHome_-_Your_first_Ace3_Addon

that, plus some random online lua tutorial, gave me pretty much all the info i needed
---
Holy paladins are great at farming lower level dungeons. Pick up herbalism and do sm runs for the herbs and drops. It's great gold per hour.

Warstomp is my fav, im always Tauren.

Dont u need 6% spell hit for molten core? 16% is sky high.

What’s the vendor price on one of those?

NA is 3pm tomorrow?

Yes, but they've shown that they're willing to make slight variations to \#nochanges where it makes sense. The current content release plan is already not 100% like it was in Vanilla.
---
I agree with the release alongside ZG.
---
It's a troll looking at the bridge.
---
He was being sarcastic this has been posted many of times

I remember when we made fun of players who started in Cata. Now it seems like most retail players barely saw MoP even.

He’ll be dead by then though.

How was that a brag haha. Someone's bitter.

Yo those ads are based on your cookies... someone has been buying gold lol

P.s. Outa work at 3 so ima meet her at 4 and peace the fuck out at 6

we dont need eng til phase 2 :)

Honestly if it's your first time, just dont worry about being super efficient. Take the time and enjoy the journey
---
Unless, of course, the WoW team has learned something from 15 years of development, dozens of patch releases, a beta, multiple stress tests, and several iterations of name reservations.
---
Haha. You got me there! I guess it just *feels* worse to me as a Warrior for some reason.
---
wym d00d this is how they look now
---
Someone get the man a snorkel so he don't drown in all that pussy.
---
While leveling on the beta as a priest with my husband as a warrior, I was the one killing most things early on because of wanding. Those first two enchanting wands are just ridiculous for their level.
---
Cringe
---
Is that a fucking beer keg CamelBak...
---
Can I buy prints? Already bought a shirt from a guy why stop there
---
The resident evil song had me grinning, then the slow burn intros...holy shit this is amazing
---
Way off base, did you even read what this guy wrote!?!?  Obviously he should roll a warrior... or maybe a mage
---
I feel like phase 1 will be a bit longer than the rest purely because newer players (and anyone playing warrior lel) will take a long time to hit level cap.
---
Where to get that cookbook? Europe pref.

I’ve been playing factorio knowing full well that I will completely abandon my factory in about 24 hrs from now.

Nope, definitely 6pm est, so 3pm pst.

I played a BM hunter in MoP as my first character, loved it. In Legion I switched mains to Outlaw Rogue cause they just removed/changed so much about the spec I enjoyed and I just can't seem to get the same feeling when I try to play my Hunter now as I used to :/
---
So true. It’s nearly a r14 honor farm to get grubby mitts on that legendarily Epic weapon.
---
That’s awesome! You’re very talented. I wish you the best of luck.
---
Leper Dwarf.

Haha, same here only pkayed hörde Will roll Hunter, night elf.

Think its more about where your friends Will play, if not just pick one, try find a guild to play with.
---
Dont follow a stream, just go what you want.
---
Although this may be true, I went on the wow sub and saw a bunch of bfa’ers bashing classic and saying bfa is a more dynamic game😂
---
Yeah you guys enjoy your anti-social rng loot facade of wow.
---
This gets talked about alot for Everquests progression servers, and the devs always say it's too expensive and the playerbase is too small. 
---
That wouldn't be a problem for WoW.
---
I agree, it really couldn't be more clear and easy to find. Reading comprehension is tough for some people
---
Wrong
---
You can keep finding dungeon groups and gain money from just tagging along.
---
When in guild other people will often be doing diverse things for whatever they need. They will often want a healer to tag along. Often there is money passively or the activity resulted in something you can get split from.
---
but yea if your set on mining then clearly thorium/arcanite-crystal farming works too.
---
Most people say vanilla through wotlk, though I extend it to cat because the cat fire mage was my favorite raiding class ever.
---
Good thing I'm horde then, but I guess shaman is similar to Paladin in that regard. I just don't remember many shaman healers from back in the days so they're a rare sight in my mind.
---
I think I'll go druid. Its the one class I never touched in retail or back in the day!
---
Fair play lad. It's a shit meme but as long as you're getting a laugh out of it then what's the harm!
---
You sum it up perfectly. I've been here since the very start, and I'm looking forward to not being a superhero all the time. Helping clear some wolves from a field sounds ideal to me right now.
---
that sux ty
---
You will have no problem healing endgame. Healers are always in demand and the combat rez will save fights before a wipe rather than rezzing after running back. 
---
Addionally, being able to wear leather and use cat form means you can farm you consumables and gold WAY easier than other healers giving you a huge leg up
---
The only times people don't want druids is for dps and tanking. As long as you play a real spec people will need you to heal for them
---
Take it slow! Luckily that should be easy in classic WoW :p
---
I love it well done
---
There is one, I believe it is pinned on this subreddit. Classicfriendfinder I think.
---
Why would you want to? Retail is a dead game
---
Classic wow = social game.
---
Therefore, classic wow = social life.
---
Makes sense, classic servers are treated like a different ruleset server.
---
Pick the one you like better. You are still filthy alliance either way.
---
But either way, you will be beloved as a warrior tank. Pick the one you think looks cooler. Your race means about a 5% difference in utility.
---
But your faction choice is unforgivable. Hope to kill you soon.
---
Dude you again, why do you keep posting anti-classic material here?
---
I can take care of myself not to become disgusting pig, dont worry
---
Anabolic aproach to WOW.   
---
Gains must flow !  
---
You better get some pre workout for that hype 6 hours que.
---
Yeah for real, alot of people would pay an unlimited amount of money for their health back. Lots of permanent football injuries plague players all the way until they die. Just food for thought.
---
I find that when I was in the beta I was playing the game in a different way this time and it was a completely different experience. I dunno if it will help but try taking a few extra seconds to actually read the flavor text. Makes the quest a lot more interesting. I am actually thinking about findin a database of the quest starting info for use in D&amp;D.
---
Ha so you couldn't see the game either, just that molten giant's butt
---
What will you eat the day after launch?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if there was even some free character transfers at some point, either to move people from an overpopulated server to a lower population one, or the opposite, to allow players to pick a new server if theirs is underpopulated and effectively dead, because I'm assuming a majority of people who never played Vanilla back in the day will play for a few weeks and go back to retail WoW when they realize how different Classic is, if they don't like it.

Holy shit thats a lot... would have paid like 2.5 € for 100g

I'd love to try a Hunter too, but very much despise the fact that you have to deal with the range-thingy that makes you miss basically half of your shots because the enemies run at you. So... Mage I guess? What would you recommend?

Ah a fellow vegan! I’ll be eating Doritos and Oreos all night personally. Though if I went your route my bathroom breaks wouldn’t need as much toilet paper...

Nothing was as satisfying as finally beating a 5 man heroic, where you had to CC every mob possible, and fighting one elite was still stressful. Getting hit for 20% damage per melee, and losing threat meant a DPS would die in 3 seconds... good times.

My original wow name was Soulkeeper inspired from a thriller movie, but it was too long and hard to play in lan parties so I rolled with soul. I couldn't reserve it in time but it's ok cause I got my cats name Suky which was inspired by Soul, my tendency to name female characters Soui and my girlfriends bright idea to add a K in it.
---
I'm still not sure if I should spell it suky, sookie, souki tho. Sookie makes more sense, since now that I think about it, it's pronounced like cookie.
---
Big Rigs!
---
This is for the lvl 40 mount though
---
A proper specced feral druid can out dps rogues, cat form is basically the same thing as a rogue. Can stun, pop out of form, slap roots down, get a heal and Hot off then back into bear, charge stun, bash stun, back to cat do it all over again

lol you haven't been looking very hard then. I still regularly play retail and any time Classic gets mentioned people are super keen to shit all over it with the "It's all nostalgia and will be dead in two weeks" arguments.
---
The general WoW subreddit is a bit better these days, but it was pretty hostile towards Classic for a long time.
---
Wow this hit a note for me. My best friend and I played EQ when we were preteens and jumped into WoW at launch. We played off and on until Cataclysm and went on to other games from there. WoW was quite a fun bonding experience that didnt get us into trouble as teens that were rebellious and destructive. This time last year we were stoked for WoW Classic, and today he is with me in spirit, and physically in some sense too as his ashes reside in an old marijuana keef box he gave me above my gaming desk. I love you my brother and we are going to rock some Classic WoW like we are 15 again.

I'm planning on dual boxing a mage and a priest.  I've had a handful of stress dreams where my priest is heavily outpacing my mage in exp =(
---
It wasn't out in vanilla you liar
---
You would be competing for gear in 5mans and you would have a harder time getting into dungeons simply because both of you are DPS. If you roll a paladin and willing to heal, it would probably be faster. Other than that, questing is great, you guys have two voidwalkers or imp for stam and a void, world pvp is also insane with two warlocks. Mage would be a similar experience.

It's like the face of the player behind every female night elf leaking through

Many people will say TBC. My personal TBC experience was playing 8+ hours a day week one, being one of the top 10 in terms of leveling speed on my hunter.
---
TBC released on a Tueaday, and by Thursday night I cancelled my sub, and uninstalled. I was level 65 in Nagrand in less than 3 days.
---
I came back for WotLK right around when ICC released, so I missed a lot of that expansion, but by the end of it I was face roll healing 25m ICC pugs as a resto druid and it wasn't even fun.
---
Cataclysm, for me, was the most FUN expansion. I've never been a crazy PvP player, so it was all about the world and raiding. The overhaul of azeroth was awesome to me, and the raids were enjoyable (except for DS, which seemed subpar). 
---
I also joined a guild that I had a TON of fun with, and I still game with a few of them today. In reality, that is what defined that expansion for me and made it fun. It'll never be about how they make changes as long as they don't break the game; it's just what you make of the game at the time.
---
I would like to point our that playing 32hrs in row on the stress test had serious brain damage affects on me.
---
The next day my gf would say something like 'Do you wanna eat babe?' and in my mind I was thinking 'stop using such complicated words' and when I would try saying something I would heavily misspronounce words.

---
Ah, yea, I’ve found wowisclassic’s guide to be incredibly lackluster or even straight up wrong for most classes, especially in the weapon progression list. For example those two wands are messed up, and for warrior, the weapon progression and levels suggested just don’t make sense for most of them without a group. You certainly couldn’t try to solo level a warrior following their progression (if that’s you’re kinda thing haha).
---
I think 4 more PvP English servers will be release 5 hours before launch, if you can wait until then.
---
This is my personal opinion.
---
Skip:  
---
RFC (14-18) 
---
Gnomeregan (32-36)
---
Maybe:  
---
Blackfathom Deeps (27-32) 
---
Razorfen Kraul (30-36) 
---
Razorfen Downs (39-45)
---
Worth: 
---
Shadowfang Keep (24-30)
---
Scarlet Monastery (33?-44?)
---
Uldaman (42-50 | There are tons of quests here that make it worth doing)
---
Zul'Farrak (43-50)
---
All the other level 50+ dungeons are all worth doing since you will likely find some BiS pieces there.  There will be many people running these even at 60.  You can actually start gearing up for raiding starting in the 50s by doing a lot of these.
---
My recommended levels might not be perfect, and if you are healing you can definitely do a lot of these while lower than the levels I posted.  I just prefer to slightly over level dungeons while leveling so things go more smoothly with randoms.
---
Personally I probably won't do any dungeons while leveling because I want to get it quickly, but if/when I level a 2nd character I will probably hit all of these up just for the experience.
---
The number 1 most worth it from a standard leveling experience is Uldaman once you have collected all the quests for it, I'm sure there are resources showing you where to start all of these (some of them are chains).
---
Wailing Caverns are also something you should do because it has a lot of good quests and you will likely be in The Barrens anyways, so the opportunity cost is a lot lower.
---
But questie does this too for active quests? Or no?
---
I’m sure your right hand will understand if you have to leave at 6.
---
Good shit dude
---
What about this looks healthy to you?
---
I’m sure they knew what expansions were planned when they developed vanilla
---
26th (11pm) for UK. I know you said majority of Europe but wanted to clarify for anyone reading this.
---
Definitely recall some times trying to save the group decked out in that fresh Red SM mail gear with the matching shield. Earthshock and hope for the best baby!
---
Don't quote me on this but I believe you can get to the middle tier, so 175? It's been so long though so I can't say for sure.
---
Nice.

---
Hey man. I gather you're the type of person that posts nothing but snarky comments no matter what the post.
---
Keep up the good work friend. I hope you can speak to whoever is making you feel bad in life.
---
So that maybe you can stop projecting your missery onto others. 
---
Have a nice launch!
---
Warriors are a single pull class. You're going to be spending a lot of time healing up after every 1-2 pulls (bandages or food). It's also heavily gear reliant so damage/tanking is relative to the gear you have.
---
From the recent polls, most people seem to roll on PVP realms because that's where most other people go, not necessarily for PVP-reasons -- which gives me hope that there won't be many scumbags camping me. I hope, at least.
---
Thanks man!
---
I’m going troll warrior strictly because I like them more flavor wise  pick what u like man

This is me.

10/10 would stream.

I think a lot of opinions will change over the coming months/years/however long it takes until phase 6. I don't think anyone truly grasps how long it'll take between now and when Naxx releases, let alone when guilds are farming it and want something else to do.

The top pserver nolife pvpers didnt get any invites to the beta, only streamers and lucky people subbed to the game did.  The tournaments only included big name pvpers/streamers and didnt include great pserver players.  Also, the tournaments were level 30 and 40... not much to tell there, certain classes dominate and always win at those levels.

Last update was in 2006. tbc released in 2007
---
Why?
---
Classic is not "just as easy" as retail... That is an idiotic statement. In retail you can role a tank class, pull the entire starting zone and walk away at level 5. Classic even as a tank class you pull three or 4 mobs you'll likely die.
---
Why advertise this shit... just ignore it and let it die.

Delete your damn post.

Told my wife I might skip a day of gym for WOW.   
---
Its Classic love, you know, game we almost divorced over 14 years ago ?

The look she gave me was pure love ...

So you can skip gym for WOW, but when I or kid ask you ...

Cant wait for MC/BWL/Onyxia raids :)

She will be SO happy.

(PS - I dont look like a gym bro, I just like to working out )
---
Just part of their putting Diablo II stuff into the class
---
People make time for things they enjoy.
---
I fully appreciate some people have no time to play, and they won't play.
---
But it's the argument that people who have time to play retail wouldn't have time to play classic instead if they switched over that I don't agree with.
---
Me 2, pizza and beer.

2001 Toyota Tacoma. Poor thing is getting close to the end; I'm getting everything in order to buy a new one.
---
I thought launch was the 27th? On Tuesday? Today is sunday the 25th? Isn’t launch in 48 hours, not 24 hours? Am I a big dummy?
---
Not sure if you're aware of this already, but if not, just remember that you can't outlevel the quests if you want full reputation rewards for them. So you'll want to start questing in Teldrasil and basically do all your leveling through the NE zones rather than coming back at a higher level.
---
Definitely, people won't be able to log in, won't be able to level consistently, won't have time to play during the week, etc.  The starting zones will be stupid for at least a week or two.
---
That 6am to 2:30pm life, baby!
---
That’s good, but I know a lot of people who would argue the opposite.
---
I'm with literally everybody else in saying that they don't owe you anything, and they made no promises or even allusions to getting no queue times just because you named your character.
---
Then going and calling everybody who disagrees with you a "Blizz White Knight" is sad as fuck. I'm not with Blizz on everything. I think Layering could be a huge pain in the ass. I think T0.5 at Phase 5 is a little late. But this is a little ridiculous. Maybe you can earn a little pay dancing on mailboxes but not from petitioning Blizzard for "what they owe you".

I think I'll play a lot, but not necessarily smashing to 60 before anything else. I'd quite like to have my professions in a decent spot, and I want to try and run every dungeon in the right level range.
---
Not saisfied, but definately clarified
---
Does the twitch client work for installing classic wow addons?
---
Dude, that's not enough time for people to use in Vanilla. So stop it.
---
Noooooooo!
---
But someone still can make hate speech, that's just not cool so this feature must go. \\S, but seriously that's primarily how it works these days...
---
Considering most people are consuming hot pockets and Mt. Dew this is very healthy ha. But no I would not be eating this if I was trying to hit a stage.
---
You can still keyboard turn and tab target while spamming those two early level offensive abilities. Oh and I think ret paladin was made for people with limitations :)
---
Awesome work, wish there was one for a Hunter
---
Might want to talk to the moderators then. Don’t want them removing comments for stating facts. That doesn’t seem fair.
---
This needs to be turned into an animation
---
Aww look at the community working together to be productive already.
---
I identify myself as a Soviet Submarine.
---
see I prefer human run animation as the dwarf really waddles doesnt he
---
Now you can do another tomorrow while staring at that same screen. Except now it says "FULL".
---
No it was not, I played Vanilla from Beta to TBC and I never once heard anyone call it VC, and I played on Multiple Servers.
---
If people called it VC they were doing it wrong.
---
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
---
True fact: Those people are less likely to stick around which means Blizzard staggering like this is almost guaranteeing that the last servers they open to fill demand are going to be dead.  They should have announced more, and been releasing more ahead of this to get the hardcore dedicated community spread around and give each server a solid base.
---
PvP Server more Horde
---
PvE Server more Alliance 
---
That’s what we know :)
---
Because release is global they can't give an exact time, since timezones make it all different at different places over the world, but the release will happen worldwide at the same moment.
---
Funny, most people seem to be making hunters this time round from what I have seen. What class you thinking of going this round?
---
Will someone play with me ? I plan on playing dwarf paladin on EU servers (dunno which one yet) and I'd like to make some Friends. fair warning though, I'll play casually (slow pace) and can only start after work (around 5-6 UST+1 time)
---
I want to have fun while playing WOW again!
---
Wand till 40 and the respec shadow
---
^ much more helpful for my American brain.
---
Well you can only reserve 3 names total, so...
---
weather they are making 1 character on 3 servers, or 3 characters on 1 server, 
---
seems like an absolute *mountain* of people 
---
especially since most of my friends (~55 people) aren't even going to sub until tomorrow, next weekend, or next month
---
Gotta say hatredstyles comment made sense to me, appreciate the input!
---
Yeah. But if I was running a business, I wouldn't run it the way these AAA studios do. quite sad really.
---
RIP my colon after all those whitecastle sliders lol
---
Why must you be so cruel?

Regular Steamvaults and Shadow Labs was pretty rough if you just had blues.
---
Easily less than 150kb/s
---
Oh, I didn't know. All the posters just said the 27th.
---
I'm genuinely excited asif it was christmas. Just thinking of the times young me would stay up to watch the fireworks on new years irl but i'd still watch them at booty bay too! ^.^
---
for 3 min mage its good because of arcane power, but yeah thats a meme spec, but a fun meme spec.
---
A *round* planet.
---
Can you link it?
---
I don't remember how to install add-ons like I did back in vanilla and the twitch app still sucks for classic. How do I install add-ons for classic?
---
Even at like 10-20?
---
Yo boy is happily on Bleameux so I *should* be good.
---
You can't even drain tank properly until lv30 so don't worry to much about it until than.
---
you will be fine just play the class you like , warriors are very rewarding at the end . you can just tank 5 mans and off tank in raids and dps most of the raids .and honestly if you are not min maxing and 24/7 first week you will be fine leveling . dungeon leveling might be the fastest way to level and you can easily farm it as a tank .
---
Taking my time, smelling the flowers, leveling those secondary trade skills, and hopefully making some cool friends and acquaintance.
---
[wow release schedule ](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/WXDU6S10E1191557767427831.jpg)  that is the schedule looks like 6pm
---
Yes, the queue is to "join the server" ie. seeing your character screen for that specific server.
---
Where I’m from you can buy an ounce for $40....
---
Fuck this sub needs to start banning people who ask this question.
---
I played Vanilla since Beta so GTFO.
---
You are lucky bro,wow for the first time with new eyes,its gonna be magical for you.especially now when the community is not so tryhard
---
Why not both plus backpacks on our backpacks?
---
See, pens, if you can get good and safe ones, are totally the way to go for gaming.
---
I love how this game brings everyone together.
---
And thanks to all those people who got us through the years by making all this content. Even if some of them can be annoying sometimes and there may have been a bit of a shortage of content to make videos about (lol), i'm not gonna pretend i didn't watch videos on everything from first aid levelling guides to how to become a Scarab Lord.
---
Good job everyone.
---
Good to know thalnos will be our server
---
Oh man, as horde I never knew this - I’ve never even done gnomer
---
omg you're a whiny fuck.  please tell me your horde.
---
Always VC
---
If I could selectively delete my memories from WoW, there is a high chance if I experience it fresh, I might quit my job.
---
Skinning for sure. I personally would save alchemy until the later levels. Good idea on doing herbing and saving the herbs (but godspeed on fighting people for nodes at the beginning).
---
Then you should know cta came out in 05
---
ClassicLFG
---
Sadly I’m in Texas. Though I do get a pretty good deal, but not as good as other states :/.
---
I am sure there will be trolls and bad behavior, there always is...but I am hopeful that the in-game communities are a bit more friendly than the forum/reddit/fansite/discord drama might lead one to believe. Things tend to be blown out of proportion on these sites, especially with the game not being live to keep people busy and not posting so much.
---
I'll be taking my time, taking it all in, having a good time with friends and hopefully meeting some new people along the way. 
---
When I played back in vanilla, I barely knew what professions were. I'll be taking my time to level herb/alch as I level my character too.
---
Try out Remnant.
---
Jesus told me to do it! :)
---
What are the clear weapon upgrades for horde warriors after the Crescent Staff (WC) at level 20?
---
I was looking mainly at quest rewards, but can't find anything until the upper 30s.
---
Will I have to grind a corpsemaker at level 30 from RFK?
---
It doesn't work as a catch up set because it's too involved.  You've gotta get the it m set, then the gold, then do the quest.  
---
By the time it drops, its far easier to just run ZG and AQ20 to catch up, you can do 2 of each a week and it won't cost you hundreds of gold per upgrade.
---
It was really a terrible "catch up" mechanism.
---
Right there with you
---
Goodbye
---
Sorry to hear, I hope you still had some cool moments.
---
Oof. I’ve heard Texas doesn’t mess around with weed.
---
Stay safe out there
---
Boomer here. TBC ruined wow for me. Classic plus is what I want.
---
*laughs in RP realm*
---
helping players, dawdling in the 25-40 range, using tailoring and enchanting to give out free things, helping organize community events
---
Twelve days of Christmas is one of the least popular Christmas songs, so it kinda makes sense.
---
backpacks on characters AND saddlepacks on mounts.
---
incentivizing paid transfers in the future just to get everyone with their highest level characters on a decent population server without queues
---
tbh you only farm feathers once for like I guess at least a week.
---
Does it matter like somebody is not taking you to raids?
---
just use a joystick already.
---
I do too. I am playing mage and was originally gonna go gnome for the intellect racial and escape artist, but I prefer the human cast animation &amp; run animation &amp; the mounts so going human instead.
---
OMG it’s almost as if different servers had different communities!!!!!
---
I would assume the server most likely to experience load issues is the streamer server. I'm not even an anti streamer person. They are simply the only case I can think of that creates a "layer preference". Layers are designed to assess what layer you can be placed in that will cause the least stress to the server. The problem is when players upset the balance of natural layer transfers (grouping), in order to stack on one layer to play with the steamer. Who knows how many servers will actually have problems, but I guarantee that faerlina will be the first to go down if any do.
---
&gt; "When I look back on this in the future, will I have wanted to experience the release?" 
---
\[the experience of release\]([https://preview.redd.it/vrpixg5x8ni31.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=dc0ef84d4f39a191e7548a26c65917e3fa5cb3b8](https://preview.redd.it/vrpixg5x8ni31.gif?format=mp4&amp;s=dc0ef84d4f39a191e7548a26c65917e3fa5cb3b8))
---
many realms and realm merges was a better solution for that.
---
even at this point, unlimited layers and no queues has become a good option.  
---
&gt;Blizz cannot foresee the future.
---
yet they continually make bad choices that are going to lead to disaster at launch by trying to overoptimize 6 months from now, which they can't predict btw
---
I agree it would make perfect sense to release all BG's at once.  
---
It would also make sense to add the Dungeon 0.5 along side ZG.
---
Cl lick on login...
---
5 months later...
---
Huh? where am I?
---
I used to have a guild on emerald dream. They’re also going to grob
---
I’m anticipating initially it will be rough but with people grouping up shouldn’t be too bad getting through starting zone.
---
 The situation is more delicate than it seems.  
---
I dont know if the "only" way for Blizzard to completely stop this addon is by removing the ability of all addons to "read chat"  
---
But if it is the "only" way...Blizzard will completely destroy thousands of addons trying to break ClassicLFG  
---
And if the addon can end up reading chat....it will effectively be as powerful as a Battle for Azeroth LFG.  
---
It can be as powerful simply by reading chat  
---
So...what will happen?
---
Grob is ED players, so mostly PvP, not rpers.
---
Steppenwulf
---
Lol did not remember that, thx!
---
So you say you dont care how good a spec or class is 
---
Then you ask for someone to tell you which one of these will be good
---
Why not just pick the one you like
---
Here, we call it "layering," which in the ancient tongue means "Big Shard."
---
Yeah I'll probably roll Mage and see after that. I'm an altaholic so I'll probably play a lot of classes
---
Exactly what I was looking for, thanks a bunch. Hope you have a great classic wow experience!
---
Velká parádička 💪🏻
---
Are any of the European servers developing reputations yet? Like are hard core raiders going PvP or PvE? Any servers in particular? Or each is so full that we should be good to go no matter where?
---
I already don’t smoke, drink or do drugs. Unless you count coffee as a drug, in which case no I won’t be using wow to quit it. Best of luck to you though :)
---
you gonna get your windshield damaged if you leave that thing parked
---
Blowmoo still holding strong at medium
---
LFG and Joanas guide, ofc.
---
I guess I will find out on Tuesday - thx
---
Gpu not supported
---
For a tank find a good tank meter. Some will probably drop soon.
---
Questie for questing is a good pick. Auctioneer if you're trying to make some gold on the AH.
---
ClassicLFG if you want to parse through all of the LFG spam.
---
I'm in the same boat. Hopefully the latam players all went alliance and the english players horde.
---
Although, to be fair, 50% is still the dominant language on the server.
---
I imagine if it becomes an issue by phase 2-3 Blizzard will have a plan to consolidate servers that have issues.
---
You think you do, but you dont

Similar situation . I've done the zones  i'll level in so many times pre - cata that I basically know most of the story by heart and just can't be bothered by it.
---
Unrelated but, how does it feel living in the US as a European ? I'm dreading that same decision myself tbh.
---
My guild looks the same.  Trouble is, most of us have wives, kids, careers, in some cases direct reports... not many coming back.
---
Oh rip. Hope everything goes well and checks out for you!
---
It's a video game dude lol
---
I'm planning on doing basic raids/dungeons end game, but for the most part I'll just be PVP'ing or working on twinks for the 39 and 29 brackets.
---
You can still play i broke my wrist and fingers you just got to hold the mouse funny
---
To be honest with you, it’s probably because I played with a tight nit group for dungeons and everyone trusted each other; and everyone was competent. 
---
I don’t expect pugs to be cool with unorthodox tactics, but at a certain point there’s a type of player that gets very annoying who only wants a designated puller to aggro and complains / won’t heal you if you out threat the tank. 
---
That person who views themselves as the shot caller

Shit yeah that's true. Not planning to be 60 for a long time anyway, gonna be playing super casual. By the time I start raiding most guilds will surely be near the end of BWL

Isnt there a realy good wand in bfd
---
There are encounters that you literally cant tank  as prot, boomkin is way better if you want to have a spot even though they're trash.
---
Same here.  Anyone on the outside looking in at me would accuse me of rushing, but I am in no hurry at all.  I'll be well ahead of the average player simply because I plan to put 80-120 hours into the game in the first week, but by no means will I be rushing or following any sort of optimized leveling path.
---
I believe the level 40 mount is free/basically free so what op is trying to say is use the money you save on that mount to invest in rare items like edgemasters (BiS Pve item for all non-human warriors) and staff of Jordan (BiS druid tanking staff?) While there's not a lot of gold in the economy then resell them once the server economy picks up to make significant amounts of gold.
---
I am frankly worried about your mental faculties. Clearly 5 is the answer.
---
I've always wondered, was this dopefish the same dopefish that did laddergoat?
---
No time stamp dont buy it
---
It’s technically 24 hours and 49 mins. We all have the same countdown.
---
And then you'd have to move all the GY's because they're too close to the objectives. Even 5 seconds would be too long because e.g lets say you die in your flag room in WSG, and the EFC runs through GY and you res and start attacking.. How is that GY camping? Would be bad if he couldn't attack back. I'd say maybe some penalty for players that repeatedly died on the GY a few seconds after ressing could maybe be given a short buff but eh it just opens a whole can of worms when all you had to do was stand outside of the res zone and then all res together and kill the people camping you. If your team is doing so poorly that you're being camped so hard you can't escape then you've already lost the game anyway.
---
They are creating enough realms to cover what the population will likely be soon after launch. Underpopulated realms are much harder to deal with.
---
Shadow priest if you like to pvp and have an itch for unorthodox classes. They are also not bad for pve but only because of the shadow damage buff for locks so essentially one per raid is max.
---
I played prot warrior back in vanilla and really enjoyed it. Thanks for the input. 
---
Also 3.5 rangers may be able to out dps hunters.
---
You migrh want to install windows iy will work(at least it worked for me in the stresst test). But good luck instaling it. Mine work with a very specific configuration on w7 becouse of the graphics drivers. They dont work propertly in any other config
---
Tbf, it also wasn't there in Vanilla. It's a part from the new client they just didn't feel like removing because addons does it anyway.
---

This was on the beta. There was two thousand people invited into the closed beta and spread across 2 realms. During name reservations, Herod alone had over 100k people in queue, for HOURS. What kinda of social interaction is there in asmongolds twitch chat with 60k people? Or ninja should he ever not be in sub mode? This is going to be every servers lfg, general, and trade chat at launch, for MONTHS. 
---
Now going back to the addon, which parses and filters lfg messages. Lets say auto invite is removed (because it already is), leaving just the chat parsing. There is no automation, and it doesn't make any decisions for you. What is the problem here? What are people concerned about? You can message the group leader and say you just want a chill group. There difference is, with the addon, it doesn't matter how fast chat is going, you can actually see the people posting lfm. It doesn't alter player agency. If this was actual vanilla, or a private server, where there is barely any chat by comparison, there wouldn't be much benefit. This isn't a problem classic could have with 2.5k server caps or private servers with even 15k server caps. But this is classic wow, with perhaps the same 1-5 million sharing a tenth as many servers. All shoved into the same chat(yes chat goes across layers). This isn't a l2p or patience issue, its a visibility issue. Why not just make friends and join a guild? A good suggestion, but how did you make friends and join a guild? You probably saw a guild posting in chat, or you joined someone's group when you were looking for a dungeon. That will be very difficult, and frustrating, if even possible, with chat scrolling so fast your message dies out in an instant.

" we want it to be a fun and engaging experience.
---
It's not about being lazy and not wanting to spam lf1m tank for two hours. That's vanilla. It's about finding a group in an environment so flooded with players that anyone is replaceable. Finding people isn't the bottleneck here. It isn't the reason you have to patience to teach people instead of kicking them. It may be frustrating but the true bottleneck is the travel time. This is classic, let's not make this about something it's not.

"if it automates gameplay, we don't like it to automate the gameplay for you. if it's letting you see the layout in a way that makes you feel like it's more comfortable for you to view and respond to, that's exactly why addons are in the game is to make like the interface more comfortable for you to read and respond to... that's something we're absolutely committed to"
---
I usually get flak for playing devil's advocate, but at least hear me out and think about it in the shower a little.
---
What about retail players that unsubbed before Cataclysm and are nostalgic about classic but are unwilling to reup their account for fear of shirking all other responsibilities in favor of grinding 40-mans for days on end?
---
neither gets in to progression raids, probably not into pugs either, prot paladin does okay in dungeons since you dont really need anything that makes warriors better tanks there so you're probs better of with that if you like PvE, since prot pally has pretty much no spot in PvP, boomkin is probably the better option there
---
Oh lol

Or you could just save everyone including yourself some time by explaining what you're looking for in your post.

Yea Wrath was the start of WoW's downfall, similar to a group of drunks blasting music as they drive around before crashing into a wall.

guild names ? lol you know other guilds will start badmouthing foreign guilds warning their players from grouping with them , unless you go lone wolf you will be discriminated against for affiliation alone , As an Italian myself I'm conflicted between joining my national community or just go undercover in servers with an english majority to save myself the headache

There’s absolutely nothing unorthodox about shadow priest in classic lmao

I was already leveling once as a prot, and it was really lots of fun, altho a little bit slow. The problem started once I reached 60, since nobody really believed me I can tank pretty much anything, and Deathbone is very time consuming, borderline insane to farm.

Blizzard: Herod is so overpopulated we changed our error reporting to make it clear some people are getting disconnected because the queue is full

Players: I'm staying on Herod because I don't want to get stuck on a low pop server, I'll just deal with the queues until the tourists leave

Also Players: Blizzard just doesn't understand the demand for Classic, we need more servers

I am also hoping to use classic to quit smoking. Hope it's a big enough distraction. :)

Questie is my personal favorite but I’ve heard some good things about MonkeyQuest as well. Both of them, in a sense, do the same thing. I just like Questie personally. Don’t pay for a questing addon though, 100% not worth it when all the info is online for free. Check out classic-tavern.com and you can see the full list of compatible Addons for Classic WoW. Questie and MonkeyQuest are both on the list as well! 
---
Happy questing
---
Solidarity brother!

You should probably go PVE.
---
I played on PVE and PVP servers in vanilla. There was more PVP on the PVE server I played on in vanilla(Shadowsong) than there is on current PVP servers in retail. You will not be completely missing out on PVP if you go PVE.
---
If you can stand people interrupting your play time and changing your plans for the day then PVP is the way to go. Some people can't deal with that level of stress.
---
I remember on a PVP server in classic there was a guild that would dress up as pirates and ride the ship between Theramore and Menethil for hours. If you are unable to find an alternate route then your plans for that night would change.

Will use this service
---
they have been, but like I was trying to say, I used 2 weeks of game time to register early, if they just keep pumping out new servers after the fact it makes my subbing early pointless because I'm going to have to reroll.

Just breaking high is good, if it was the only medium server it would get full with the release rush, being high will detract people and we just broke it so its not going to be as bad as those who have been high the whole week.
---
Yes. For months there will be lots of levelers
---
Whoa this is so well done. Just reserved my own dwarf priest and this made me gasp. Great work

Wasn't aware America was even involved in WWII. What part did you guys play in it?

It releases world wide at the same time. Therefore, due to time zones it releases at different times depending on where you live. As a general guide, for those in NA, it releases the 26th, for those in the EU, it releases the 27th.

The minimum requirements are Intel HD 4000, assuming you didn't put a $1000 GPU into a system with a $100 CPU, you should be fine with onboard

Absolutely, highly recommend airopro. I won't even remember leveling to 60.

yeah i legit just restocked on drugs for classic, aint nobody got time for that healthy shit.

Where did you read this?

That's assuming ALL new raid content has to be post naxx (a raid that a very small percentage of players will actually complete). You can add more raids in the MC or BWL tiers, which more people will be able to play too. You can add new areas with new quests that have unique and interesting rewards. Making the new highest req/toughest raid isnt the only way to add new content to the game. Top level raising is a very small part of the overall experience.

Try the discord for whatever server you're playing on.
---
Try official forums. Hope you will find what you are looking for.
---
Uhh..I’d pick blade furry for PVE over sub any day. Sub for PVP is serviceable at best in PVE.

Guess I'll give it a try, I'll also be more focused on leveling, but the occasional pvp adventure does sound really nice tho

Time is what wands are used for with mages. Drinking and eating are free but use up time.  If I can kill 5 mobs in the span it takes you to do 3, you saved money on food, I will out level you very quickly.

Undead Warlock - Tailoring and Enchanting - PVP server bc STVietnam

Yeah it’s quick for sure

eh wont affect my experience
---
I played a lot of classes in vanilla. I was mainly a fire mage, PoM Pyro or 3 minute mage. I don't plan on playing mage this time. I hated how squishy I was. In PvP I would do fakes when drinking because it was so common when I sit down that a rogue or druid would unload on me. The guaranteed crit of me sitting down allowed most rogues to kill me almost instantly.

set them up on retail and move them over lel

Why do people not realize that a sizable portion of the player population will be gone 3 months from now? Many of these servers will be medium-low pop in a year.
---
Ret pala or Enh Shaman usually get Sulfuras.
---
But going into classic thinking "Im gonna play X class cause I want this weapon" isnt realistic. You can clear MC once a week and then have to compete with 39(not really 39 but you get my point) for loot. 
---
Unless you are gonna be a guild master and ninja legendarys its a pretty low chance you will get chosen for such rare drops.
---
I thought you all wanted the vanilla experience.
---
Ok. Take a deep breath and I’ll walk you through this.. go to Best Buy and open Best Buy credit card. They have 0 interest financing. Use the credit card on a new GPU and once your replacement 2080 comes in return the Best Buy GPU at no cost to you. If they want a restocking fee just throw a tantrum and have a manager waive the fee. (I used to work at Best Buy)
---
A lot of people on this forum still are operating on memory of before patch 1.08. Druid is the best OT, best tank in early T1, best tank for gear check fights, and can tank all of the 5 mans just fine.
---
Cat DPS will never top the charts and will be around mid range with a lot more work. It's a rough road for the strong of heart. It also adds a lot of damage to the raid in the form of feral faerie fire and leader of the pack. You can OT just fine in a pinch. 
---
Oomkin is not a thing.

I will probably use this as my wallpaper, Thanks!

Defeats the purpose of classic. I hope Blizz really limits this shit.

WoD soured people's desire for alt time lines
---
Oh I thought it was 10am today, okay thank you
---
Both of those were in Warcraft III so it's not surprising.
---
You will get to about 57-58 and start running dry on quests.  Just the way the game was.
---
You have to grind 2-3 levels in classic.  No way around it.
---
However, they are vastly different games that fit to different people. The idea is that if someone enjoys retail wow, then they probably won't enjoy classic, because they are polar opposites (Retail fast paced, social interaction low, high difficulty) classic wow slow, high social interaction, and less dificult mechanics. The tourists are people in retail who want to try out classic to see what all the fuss is about, since it's basically free since it comes with their already payed sub.
---
If you're looking to cut corners and save money, these are the spells to ignore. If you want every spell that greats for some scenario or another, you're better off learning everything.

I think you’re wrong, with all the streamers/YouTube’s out there everyone should know what they’re getting into. I think it will have a fall off but I see it at like a 20% thing nothing crazy, I genuinely think people are going to play this way more hardcore and casually then they do BfA
---
you forgot the clown shoulders
---
I’ll be rolling tailor/enchanting when I start, get my wand and drop enchanting. Then I’ll either go harbalism or skinning, most likely herby so I can craft potions/flask later
---
It all depends on what’s available on launch as well
---
Far from being able to pull any of the weight. If it’s specifically asked for, then guilds would ask for a spec toward holy so you heal instead. A prot paladin isn’t getting any raiding spots.
---
To future proof classic

**Half** a paragraph, and I type near 100 w.p.m., so barely any effort.

Bigglesworth I believe is the Pacific one, and Incendius is the Eastern. Not sure if Blizzard ever clarified, but I've seen Bigglesworth listed twice officially as Pacific, and one time as Eastern

"All of the existing realms have a healthy population. **Even a Full realm in 2006 would be Low by our current metrics.** Any realm that is listed above Medium should expect queues at launch, with increasing severity from High to Full."

On Beta, the battlegrounds were not even limited to just PvP vs. PvP--the PvP and PvE servers were linked.
---
The queue times will *not* maintain faction balance in the slightest. Separate server queues per-faction is the most viable solution long-term, in the face of otherwise inevitable one-sidedness for world PvP.

Please tell me if you ultimately end up playing on the same server you have a name on currently.
---
I liked it
---
Some will. Like it or not there will be a large portion of players from retail, not from retail and from pservers who sub and don’t hit 60. Who fall off.
---
It’s not like pservers maintain their launch numbers. Even Nost fell off, even Nost core based servers fell off too. It’s a pipe dream that people have thinking classic will only retain members, there will be people who unsub and stop playing just like there was in vanilla. The real question is will there be more people joining the game than leaving like there was in vanilla.
---
You were 29 minutes off

no matter what you do, in 30 min you will be disconnected from character select and will have to log in again.

What did O ever do to you? (Onyxia). It's easy to tell the difference, just shift click the player, a level 60 in greens aren't looking for Ossirian /s
---
You are correct. We will just have to see what they actually turn out like.
---
Just get in blind. You are going to be fine:)
---
Literally any other server on the right
---
What server lol
---
Is it possible to skip the starting questline for one race to do another elsewhere. For example, if I’m a gnome, can i just walk to elwynn forest and begin questing there?
---
Gen X aren't millennials, X comes between boomers and millennials.
---
Shadow spells have always done stupid amounts of threat, which is why most priests had points in the threat reduction talent. Plus you have the extra from VE healing. So if you skip the talent, you'll be pretty tasty looking to everything you're psychically poking.
---
Expectations is having Ironfoe lmao.
---
Being full doesn't matter, it's only if it's *locked* and even then that's ignored if you already have a character on the realm, so if you've reserved multiple characters you're fine, if not just make a random one while you do your recreation.
---
Do i need both codex and pfquest?
---
Yep. I'm going to grab a 2080 super or TI closer to the Cyberpunk release. I played the RPG in the 90's.

No, infact it will probably decrease your karma, depending on the subreddit

I'm thinking of rolling a Warlock to start as for my first character. Will be playing a lot with friends and we all have busy lives so we won't be power leveling through content or anything.

If I'm looking for something that will do well in both PVE and Battleground environments am I right to think Affliction should be the tree to go after? It's unlikely that I'll be raiding with this character.
---

Are tanks and healers still going to be in extremely high demand? I haven't played WoW for a while and was thinking about playing a pally since I only ever rolled priest/warrior before.

There’s a low end to meme quality?

You should never go for Dancing Flame, that quest line is too difficult and time consuming.

I would like to see both. They'll need to keep classic servers around anyway. just do both and allow me to transfer my characters to the BC server.
---
Funny way of saying GM’s girlfriend

Had to throw Atiesh in, never really see it

Not me down voting brother. Servers should be full at launch. They were full at game launch too. You don’t want to build something bigger just because it’s busy on opening day. I expect wait times for a week or two. I also expect the community to be complaining for a week or 2. But if they create to many servers people will be complaining for ever about underpopulations.
---
&gt; free game that only requires a monthly sub.
---
ummmm
---
I played on a 30-100 concurrent one (RP PvE). It was great fun even with so few players. You just have to get used to it. Fortunately I assume all current servers, even the medium ones will have at least a couple of k players online the next 3 months. If medium means "way bigger than even the most crowdied full server back in vanilla", I'm not worried.
---
You'll get auto disconnected from the character screen after 30 minutes, even if you're fiddling with characters/creating characters (3 character limit lifted tomorrow pre launch).
---
Logging in before 5:30 EST is a waste of time.

I think people are massively delusional. Unless you're very lucky and get an ironfoe, dal rend's or HoJ early on, you're looking at a really really long time spent farming for those items.
---
Even if you have a dedicated group of friends, playing an optimal group comp, are decently geared and do everything right, the chances of even seeing one of those items is very low.
---
Then your group of friends are finally 60 and have mostly pre-raid BiS or close, do you really think they're gonna want to trudge in BRD for hours, run after run, just so you can check one item off of your list? They're gonna want to pvp, farm gold for their mounts, level their tradeskills, or maybe an alt.
---
The only alternative will be to pug it. But then if you pug it, you're not gonna want competition, so you'll take very specific classes, that will take time, too. And be even slower because one way or another, you'll bring some idiot that doesn't know what he's doing.
---
I understand that having an optimized list of items is a good thing, you might even get a few of those items. The reality is that you most likely will never even see it drop at all.
---
I don't want to be negative andy here, but i'm just realistic. Juding by the posts i've read, it seems a lot of people have the idea like "week 1, left binding, week 2, right binding, summon the wind dude, get thunderfury i don't get what's the big deal about it????"
---
It's cool if you get super lucky and get all the items you want, i wish you the best, but you most likely won't. Myself included. It's just how it is.

Lots of things like dynamite and a shield that causes enemies blocked to get hit with chain lightning make it super valuable for tanking especially since the one big weakness of warrior tanks is pick up AOE threat

So, I still have almost the entire alliance experience to discover.
---
Horde side, I still have all the following zones to experience (as in, I only did a few quests in each and have few memories of the zone, except STV...)

Kalimdor
---
- Desolace
---
- Dustwallow Marsh
---
- Azshara
---
- Un'Goro (I think I did 50% of quests here?)
---
- Felwood (except rep quests / hours of rep grinding)

Lots of content left for me to experience for the first time!!!  Despite my days (or months? year?) of /played
---
See you all in game!
---
!!! I get to play a whole 24 hours earlier than I anticipated 
---
Granted I actually can access the world.
---
hunter has a deadzone where you can't shoot if the mob is too close, however, for leveling this normally isn't an issue since your pet will keep aggro and you can sit back and shoot.
---
It's good to get in the habit of moving while shooting though since this is a HUGE advantage in pvp.
---
Thank you all on this sub for helping these last few months go by a bit quicker :)
---
See you in Azeroth!

I feel sorry for whoever had to do that tattoo. As well as whoever has to see it. 
---
The only compromise I’m willing to accept is a half horde half alliance tattoo (which is most likely what I’ll get). 
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
just remember that the US doesnt have 4 server tabs at the bottom

It's a pointless, unecessary addon and should be shut down

You 100% can use onboard graphics for classic, [trust me.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/364502079773081621/612084873238282240/pwkvfv34cvg31.png)

WoW Classic with extra raid content taken from TBC and WotLK and WotLK class balance; I'd pay good fucking money for that.
---
You get stabbed by 37 horde rogues....
---
The question you have to ask is: what do you do when you finish Naxx? New lowbie zones and lower level dungeons/raids won't sustain a server. 
---
There are really only three long term options:
---
- Stat squish/adjust and add more content
---
- Move on to TBC
---
- Do little or nothing and wait for the server to die
---
From what I've seen in my playtime in BFA the community is pretty bitter about Classic. Quite a few shitting on Classic and it's players. I don't think a lot will come over because it doesn't have the transmog, mounts, pet battles, easy loot. Literally a large percentage of the community is cosmetics/easy achieves over gameplay.
---
Let's not have this open knowledge.
---
Man with long tail
---
The naxz bis gear for fury warriors includes 0 pieces of tier 3. Lmao at this whole fucking comment thread tbh
---
I know I'll be!
---
Well that doesn’t sound too bad, I can’t imagine the squeakers listen to podcasts so I’m not super worried about their following
---
Yea, but I would like my settings and keys from retail...
---
Perhaps not as chill, but my experiences on Nost were far better than recent experiences in Retail.  Vanilla forces players to work together and punishes those are don't

Probably moving from whitemane to bigglesworth. My guess is bigglesworth will be populated "high" by the end of launch day.
---
Thank you for the support and I hope it helps you out! I spent a lot of time putting the book together, I would really appreciate it if you could leave a review and let others know how you feel about it!

Dominos is better anyway. Bartender has weird icon sizes that have spacing between when skills aren't placed on hotbar.
---
No, you can't cast any spells. You can just run and jump and autoattack.
---
You can download it without subscribtion as well?

Seriously..get all the money while you can fore that mount. People who didn’t play this game early on are in for a rude awakening when 100g is fucking rich

They're gonna need like 10 more servers for real.
---
I'm not even signing up until tomorrow (only playing classic. do not care about name reserve). And 7-8 of our friends who never play WOW are signing up also day of (some oldies, couple noobs).
---
There's probably going to be like 800k people watching on Twitch. Almost every huge streamer is playing from other games (e.g. Shroud). Tons of those viewers are going to be playing.
---
Expect there to be way more people coming in who just don't care to sign up early because they're not wow subs.
---
With the servers looking like that right now - Blizzard is severely underestimating the popularity of this.
---
Guess who booked the wrong day off because he thought it was 12am 28th.
---
And ill be 5! XD

---
Gnome beard is op
---
Going to be crucial to spam that login button
---
Then the fresh server fills up....
---
They are advertising it this way so everyone hopes on the next day and they get an easier first day on their servers :P
---
Bucharest is UTC+3
---
Also don't the files run from where retail is installed?  Or do both folders run different instances of the game?
---
Shit post 0.1/10
---
Is shift clicking THAT difficult? Or just taking a couple seconds out of your day and saying "hey, do you mean deadmines or dire maul?" Cuz if that's just too much for you... yikes
---
Even if they drop to medium that's still more players than vanilla wow
---
Are you talking about Classic settings or retail settings? If Classic I would just take the WTF / Interface folders from the Classic folder and back them up and then reinstall Classic on the SSD and put the folders back.
---
Retail settings wont be affected by Classic install so if you dont have Classic installed just put it on your SSD when you install the game.
---
I got concentrate, flower, shrooms and molly. 
---
I even cleaned my favorite plunger for tomorrow night.
---
&gt; The mods on this sub are garbage and have allowed a sub for discussing raids, class advantages, faction differences, itemization, and other classic WoW related things to turn into a shithole karma factory 
---
Fixed
---
Too many
---
My main resto Druid (retail... haven’t had a sub since mid BoD... I’m resubbing on the 27th) is named Risutoa which is Japanese for “Restore”   I think it’s neat
---
&gt; If you plan on doing dungeons though fade is useful and even mind soothe can help sneak past some trash
---
but if you kill that trash, you get more gold.
---
Don't train it for some gold, kill things for more gold.
---
If i click on WoW, it would send me direct to a ''try for free'' version. So i download that. I dont know if that is classic or not xd
---
Chronicles are only worth it for WoW fans. They're pretty much just history books.
---
As for the others, some are good and can stand on their own. But it's mostly the older ones as the ones after "The Shattering" are tied to the events after WoW, so they kinda need you to have a vague understanding what is going on in-game.
---
Personally I like "Beyond the Dark Portal", "Tides of Darkness" and "Rise of the Horde"  (not in reading order) as they describe the whole Orcs-and-Humans thing. As well as "Lord of the Clans".. But I am also a Thrall fanboi.
---
I hope you could use my input!

Idk, with that sorta handicap I think a hunter might be better.

Theres 3 instead

Imagine going blacksmithing as a priest because some redditor told you not to look into things.
---
Someone posted it in discord, didn’t realize it was on here
---
You're completely right, I apologize about the % of vendor price. The ratio does remain the same with the long duration being 4x more expensive than short duration, and longest duration being 12x more expensive than the short duration.
---
I like the cracked desert ground detail.
---
Will classic run on the newer character models and graphical improvements or will it be the old 3 polygon character models? Also what about dances? Old school dances or the upgrades?
---
bad speed ups
---
&gt;Paris is wrong its 12pm the 26th
---
Um no it's not and no it isn't, you're not getting it at midday Monday. The game releases at 27th at 12:00am aka midnight monday night local time.
---
Going to westfall for the first time set a really nice tone. Then the chain that culminates the the dead mines was amazing.
---
And they will be full too I think they should do 4 more on top of that

Not downvoting the facts, theyre downvoting your attitude.  At least i am.  Just cause someones wrong doesnt mean they are ignoring facts.  You wouldnt speak like that about any other issue, its a clue.
---
Not a Wireless mouse but I really like my Magic Eagle, comes with 12 buttons in the thumb area that make macro mapping really nice and easy to handle. I'm not a macro master or anything but it was nice to have my mount up button equipped there. Not sure if they make Wireless but still worth a look see JIC
---
Fire is better the second there are no fire resist bosses/mobs
---
a lot of items in old school remain BiS even with all the updates they have done, or are used to craft the new BiS for that slot.  So all content stays pretty relevant

Uh oh OP, you better copy and paste some T2 on that guy or the mods are going to take your post down.
---
Oh dude, login/authentication servers are going to get set on fire tomorrow.
---
Old with better lightening and graphic options
---
When the game first came out there wasn't as many quests, especially nearer late game, now there's more than you'd ever need.
---
I'm on mobile but your image appears to be such low resolution that I can't read it. Can you tell me what the error window says?

Just set it to Wow CLassic as you would hit the play button.. but hit options up above the pictures and click uninstall it will ask you if you are sure you want to uninstall classic
---
this looks exactly what happened to runescape, now the OSRS doubles the player base of the "original" with half the staff. glad this is coming out.
---
Hi not downvoting the facts, theyre downvoting your attitude.  at least i am.  just cause someones wrong doesnt mean they are ignoring facts.  you wouldnt speak like that about any other issue, its a clue., I'm dad.

Yup, I had ‘Pandamonium’ reserved already in vanilla. Thought it was pretty obvious they would go there.
---
It should. As should the fate of Starwars Galaxy. J. Allen Brack is terrible.
---
We’re all ready, and in regards to health etc. My mage food will come in handy!

The proof of concept proved that the writers can't handle it.

Good luck to that 1 coconut water countering everything else.

Just like in real life people can’t help spending all their money on shiny stupid shit.
---
The first rank of prowl is 60% of normal speed.  The final rank is 70% of normal.
---
Don't forget. Every layer is its own server so much of what you though would be rare is no longer the case.
---
nu-blizz would fuck it up. they can't design a new MMO
---
unless you’re a 35 year old woman go male
---
You're right, sorry I correct the mistake. The ratio of their costs is the same however, with the 24 hour duration being 12x more expensive than the 8 hour duration. Thanks for the correction!
---
It’s actually better that the meme had no mention of cata on the last one. Cata was when I left for good.
---
What's the likelihood of Blizzard punishing you for using anti-AFK methods? I assume they don't have a way to easily detect automatic contraptions or macros, but if you are reported by too many players Blizzard might realize your shenanigans.
---

its at full right now.

Wait... so all the viagra ads I get aren't a coincidence?!?
---
Also how to keep from going afk in AV to farm honor.

I'd play both.
---
Yep, just figured it out. Thanks fam
---
Razer even discontinued making naga mice for lefties. Says enough.
---
Hahaha, that is true.
---
I don't *think* this is actually hard. I could be wrong. But I think it will just be laborious.
---
Pick a class like mage, warlock or hunter that can kite or has a pet to tank. Grind mobs that are as low level as possible, preferably non-hostile ones. 
---
Never, ever take chances. Do not run into places where you could get respawned on, do not enter a canyon/dungeon or other enclosed space, do not aggro an elite or pull without full health and mana. If possible stay near towns or guardsthat you can run back to.
---
So it was "the nail in the coffin" but you "didn't really play". So you are judging something you didn't play that harshly. I think Ferrari is garbage. Never driven one but I'm just kinda turned off by it so there's no way one could be good.
---
Good shit, huh?
---
Ah damnit I was gonna make this post, take my upvote :P
---
ClassicLFG, Questie, WeakAuras, DBM and ElvUI
---
Oh I agree, it all went to shit after LK lore wise
---
If you transfer a character to a server with their name already taken on that server, you end up with a bunch of numbers after your name (you have to name change before you can log in on that character) so I imagine it's because those character's names have been taken due to being inactive for so long that their names became available to other players.
---
Hooray!! :D
---
Just under 86400 Mississippi
---
Last I checked normal realm was medium. PvP was high. Not entirely sure if it’ll get full or another server being added
---
Hey dude dunno if this will help, but when I was a new dad I used to wrap our kid up in a sling called a mobiwrap and bounce up and down on an exercise ball while he slept. He slept so well in that thing, I got a decent amount of wow time and my wife got uninterrupted sleep too, it was one of those rare everybody wins situations. Just had to be quiet on voice chat!
---
I played Legion with integrated graphics when my GPU died in 2016. Put everything as low as it’ll go and you should be able to pull consistent 30fps+ at 1080p.
---
Skooma*
---
Alts to the rescue! Reserve those names now and enjoy later!
---
There's no trial for Classic right now (only for retail), we don't know if there will be in the future.
---
It’s a shame the finale of the Worgen starting zone is still bugged to this day. Same with Demon Hunter.
---
Never before has a weekend gone by so slowly...
---
Except it would dump our cherished characters into... retail.
---
Don't think so.
---
Fellow warlock planning on tailor/skinning as well! Good plan!
---
How about an F for those who just finished their degree with summer semester? Good luck to you!
---
Is it based on raw characters? Or unique accounts creating minimum 1 character per realm? Hoping for the latter to really speak to the demand of the game
---
Good luck to you.  Gonna need it to get a maladath on a paladin.
---
I wont be in the endgame for months
---
The question is a probably a complicated question, but not a bad, nor impossible question to answer. You're just adding more elements to the question. I simply just asked which class ultilizes the the racial traits the best. I've also mentioned that pvp and pve usage would be the same so neither game mode is more important.  
---
A troll hunter for example. I think a hunter would be the best fit for the troll because it uses all of its traits.
---
This is what I've been using for a few months, now. It feels really solid, good weight to it, nice clicking action. I recommend it.
---
If Classic WoW Takes off, they could put in TBC and WOTLK again, but now with hindsight
---
No not atm and probably not any time if at all it helps gold seller spam.
---
Just leave man
---
So sad to see people lose their life so young :p

Thanks for the hot take.

Unlike Christ, WoW delivers.

Oh yeah man she’s in bed by 8 and sleeps all night. We keep her swaddled all night it’s the only way she will stay asleep. She was extremely colic for the first month though and the only thing that would stop the 6 hour screams was bouncing on the exercise ball lol

**If you're into repeating the same old \~15 year old shit,**

**If you are into playing by far the most unbalanced version of WoW,**

**If you like grinding for hours and hours,  just to stay somewhat competitive in PvE and PvP**
---
**Then I Classic is for you my friend.**
---
I honestly feel like it’s a mistake for people to play in an attempt to relive their younger years. I think if you approach it with the mindset that it’s a new and good rpg to explore then you should have fun. Don’t worry about rushing to 60. You really end up missing the character that the world has to offer.
---
For me and a lot of other people there is no "going back to retail". When I'm done with classic I will likely still have zero interest in retail wow
---
k
---
I just updated it to work for alliance as well
---
Refresh reddit
---
Check youtube for wow classic content you may have missed
---
Refresh reddit again

Remember you might have your original wow manual in a box somewhere and go dig it out.
---
Realize the old manual was pretty boring to read

Try retail. Logoff in disgust 15 min later.

The feral is there to offtank, and only dps when they aren't needed for offtanking.  Feral is a spec, not a role.

*laughs in stoneform vanish*
---
Try changing your desktop resolution, accepting the change, changing it back, accepting that change, and then altering WoW's settings.
---
Slighty better for French, yup. Only twenty more people on Auberdine, and it's done.
---
If they give us RP servers right before launch, i might roll on it.
---
Thanks so much for the support; it's going to be a tough decision either way unfortunately because the idea of video game addiction carries such a stigma in my family. Any of you that responded, if you're playing alliance on grobulus, hit me up. Profurious, human paladin.
---
I'm a disabled person who only has use of one hand and I main paladin.
---
There are 1,000,000 posts about this
---
&gt;And doesn’t the fact that people want to play a 15-year-old version of an existing game suggest that, post-release, Blizzard shat the bed? 
---
I just like playing low powered versions of games. Another example of this is I'll repeatedly play Borderlands 2 on Normal Vault Hunter Mode because I like using white quality weapons instead of weapon combination switching + stacking. Can't I just use a 6 shooter the whole game/Cast frostbolt only lol
---
Oof
---
Basically, on Phase 1, you will NOT be able to see EVERYONE who is playing on your server. Because we will all end up in different...layers....different worlds, for lack of better word.
---
At the end of Phase 1 Blizzard says we will eventually be able to have "server communities" and be able to actually see EVERYONE...because there will be layers no more.
---
Endboss?
---
need more chiken nugs bru
---
ATM I am working like, 2 days a week contract work. 
---
Honestly the way its going atm i'm going to rush to 60 and then chill the f out til Phase 2 - not too keen on Sharding yet it won't kill my experience, just plan on leveling to 60 on multiple chars in this process.
---
It’s called google
---
damn, my crystal ball is broken
---
i mean, the thing about investing in a community and making friends and choosing to play somewhere is...it makes you less concerned about how populated the server will be in a few months
---
also: hype never lasts
---
Fellow Fort Wayneian, let us LAN together at McDonalds off coldwater&amp;washington center rd.
---
I’m gonna blow your mind. I was playing Ms Pac-Man earlier.
---
Implying the Earth is a spinning ball lmao
---
No, the name becomes available the moment you delete it.  I've tested this in the last week with a friend as we created our characters after the name reservation rush.
---
I've added alliance vendors just now :)
---
Normal right?
---
Layering is essentially copies of the same server to reduce queue times and to make sure there aren't thousands of players in the same zone. Imagine hundreds or thousands of players in the starting zone at the same time.
---
So you get assigned to a layer when you login but you won't see players from other layers. As time moves on, they will remove more and more layers as players spread out over the different areas and eventually there will only be 1 layer per server.
---
I want things like Kara back, but not the full BC.
---
I didn't realize slapping some T2 armor on a meme made people more willing to start discussing raids, class advantages, faction differences, itemization, and other classic WoW related things?
---
Timezones
---
Yeah, never get that thing in 12h time format, where you start counting hours from 12, then after 12:59, you go back to 1.
---
But I'm guessing, if old clocks was using in first place roman numerals, and zero symbol don't exist in roman numerals, they writed XII instead. Making the hours begining to 12 then jumping to 1. Just because it was writed 12 instead of 0 on the clock, people started to count hours like that.
---
You don't sound like a very pleasant person
---
Hey man ever heard of google?
---
Similar to phasing: several instances of the same area in one server to help with overcrowding. 
---
This is what will keep the server queues at launch in single digit hours instead of double digits :)
---
Literally just a laser mouse from 2010
---
No they are not. Blizzard has not said this at all
---
They specifically said Herod will see multiple hour long queue
---
I'm not a "child" for not wasting my limited time

---
Honestly I enjoyed seeing how little resil you could afford to get away with while adding your pve penetration items for arena on my hunter.  Was a good risk vs reward system.
---
It might be easiest just to say - the game will release 24 hours from 30 minutes ago.
---
Ah, gotchya!
---
It’s a worldwide release, so while it will be the 26th for us in the USA, it will be the 27th over seas. So yes, 23 hours or so full worldwide launch.
---
I did it manually I'm not sure twitch will have that at launch.
---
There's no way blizzard could tell if you had a bird poking your keyboard or if you ran back to your keyboard and tap jump every once in awhile.
---
Using an auto-clicker or program on your computer is more risky though.
---
Op talks about the cannonballs that can knock you into the water on the pier
---
It's not far from the truth, it's not like it was the bomb back in vanilla but it wasn't unheard of either. People trying to make it either way are both pushing the extreme sides of the argument. The why something like that didn't become popular by then can be left to speculation like,  
---
 a) since it was just improving how a system worked it wasn't really that needed, following that logic it makes sense that addons like Atlas Loot, Titan Bars and KTM took off more as there wasn't a system for those at all in classic. By blizzard's post you could argue that if that if they wanted to allow people to view the loot in dungeons they would have left the dungeon journal on.
---
b) less people were interested in dungeons in the last month before TBC making the chat less hectic and thus the need for an addon like this less.
---
c) Taking into account the Tipping Point theory, it's possible that it didn't reach that minimum amount of people using it at the right time to cause it become more widespread in Vanilla, for example getting enough attention to get featured when DM was released could have pushed it as there would be a sudden surge of people trying to make LFG easier.
---
Regardless these are just speculations that make sense to me. A sidenote on the "wrathbabies" part, I've been guilty of doing it, most of the times as part of a response to "go back to retail responses."
---
No i think it should work, unless the character is lvl 30 or something
---
Read his post again. He's talking about there being different qualities of players on each server, which is true. You can see as much in the details of the reddit server survey.
---
What? No.  Every layer is pretty much its own server, yes.  That doesn't change the supply and demand at all.
---
Vanilla: 1 server, 1 layer, 3000 people.
---
Classic: 1 server, 3 layers, 9000 people.
---
The amount of people per layer is going to be roughly the same as it was for 1 layer in vanilla.  There will be more of these world drops and rare BoE drops, but there will also be roughly the same ratio of people to drops.  The supply is increasing but so is the demand.
---

---
Weird flex but okay
---
I did the same thing. I took Tuesday off because I recalled seeing the release date was the 27.
---
To write a resume....or write a macro...
---
I would be completely fine keeping TBC and/or WotLK separate from Classic.  
---
TBC would make me happier then Classic or WotLK.  So TBC servers bring'em on (assuming this actually succeeds and doesn;t fail within a year or 2).
---
Wow, such insight.  I can sleep well tonight knowing the reason why you play Retail.
---
I don't think it would be that simple, but certainly not 35 hours like he is saying
---
did you stalk this mans post history? not sure how smoking pot equates to being a loser either, there are quite a few places where it's completely accepted and legal now. if you're talking about the user name, lots of people have '420' in their name as a joke. do you think anyone with 69 in their name is a fuckin sex fiend and anyone with 911 in their name is either a policeman or a terrorist? usernames don't mean shit, brother
---
&gt; This makes absolutely no sense. If the last servers they open are going to be dead, that means there aren't enough players to fill those servers, and announcing more just means more servers end up dead.
---
But they staggered the server release. If they released all the servers at once instead of 4 here, 2 here, 3 here, etc. then they would have a much more even server population.
---
Like, if you have 300 players and a server capacity of 150 per server (obviously these are massively low numbers, just using it for simple math) and you have 2 servers open, then ideally you'll have 150 on each. But if ten more people join, then you'll need an entirely new server for 10 people. So now you have two full servers with queues and one server that's DOA. But if you launch three servers from the beginning, then ideally you'd have 100 people per server, thus the 10 new players won't screw up the balance too much.

The good old times when YouTube was not full of things like this :))))

So relevant everyone is posting it
---
Holy fuck
---
every server has a community. every server has...communities
---
but we can't predict on which server you'll find more RP fun
---
I can say it's absolutely a waste of energy to worry that your experience might be better on the server you aren't playing on
---
thought and prayers are with you during this difficult time
---
Wut
---
Jokes on you I’m running with a holy priest!
---
That's really only relevant if you play the game in the most hardcore fashion, otherwise it's just another hobby, and the idea that having an SO, children, or work precludes hobbies sounds *more* boring to me. :P
---
Blind is a poison in classic, which makes Dwarf the best Rogue against other Rogues.

The subscription fee is all it will cost you to play Classic.
---
Nothing they said was offensive, Idk what your getting on about
---
Or, don't buy gold in retail or classic? Or any MMO? Just play the god damn game lol
---
I do the same. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I kill them once just for fun then /hug them and walk away when they respawn.
---
US looks sad having to play with streamers
---
*min/maxers 6 days after release *
---
It wasn't clear and if you google WoW release date, August 27 comes up.  Just know, if you are in the US, you get it August 26 3pm PDT.  That works out to be August 27 in pretty much every other continent, hence the confusion
---
I think it was sentry totem. I always called it camera totem &amp; used it for guild pics.
---
Hmmm very cool, thanks for the input! May just wait until 20ish and get a big stock rather than doing it in the first few days.
---
Agreed that the mods here leave something to be desired. They rule with an iron fist!
---
So there is nowhere to see the individual server numbers? Has there been any polls to see how many people are going on what server?
---
Straight jealous of your skill. Exceptional work.

Classic WoW is the best intro to the game, absolutely start out with it.

This sub Reddit scares me for how the playerbase will be

Turn all the lights up to ten!
---
In that case, retail WoW is more hobbyist friendly.
---
I am a 10000% sure this will not happen and blizzard are doing their best to prevent this from happening.
---
It takes too long to farm the cloth. It's better to just skip this strategy and pick up Smoldering Wand at level 15 from Zane Bradford, IMO.
---
Just a sub my dude
---
Having a lot of trouble picking what to roll! Would love some advice. My main goal is PVE content. I’ve played vanilla back when I was 13 or so. Then TBC, Wotlk, bit of Cata and MOP, then stopped playing. Only did raiding in WOTLK. 
---
I love tanking, and have tanked with warrior, paladin and DK. All Tauren, of course. I really want to tank in vanilla and have to choose warrior to do so. Fine with me, except it feels like I’m going to have to pay a high price to do so. Slow levelling, high repair costs, lower ability to farm gold etc. I also hope I won’t be penalised for going Tauren. 
---
So I’m thinking of perhaps levelling some farming character first, to make my experience a bit easier when I get around to levelling one. For this I’m thinking warlock, hunter or mage. I played all three of these in TBC, and I had the warlock in vanilla. I’m thinking aoe farming will be pretty difficult to come by at first, so perhaps the first two will be better for the dungeon runs. 
---
So my decision is; stay true to my heart and persevere with the tank. Or go the easy route first to set myself up for the future?
---
And a secondary question is PVP of PVE. I went pvp in vanilla, and paid for it hard with the ganks and slower levelling, but I did enjoy it. I played warlock and rogue though, so had it easier than most. It would probably make my warrior even more difficult to level. I only really want to PVE at the moment, but don’t want to limit myself. 
---
 Would appreciate any input!
---
Yes, timezones. It's not that hard. 
---
Blizzard has been crystal clear on the release schedule since May. Not their fault you can't count to 24.
---
It costs nothing but a subscription fee!
---
Your social life, so for many of us, nothing.
---

---
Yeah Blizzard did a blue post about it today saying that they are unsure if the queue system is even able to handle that many people
---
Fun to fight over lotus spawns if you are on a pvp server
---
I’m still bummed I couldn’t get ‘Willy’ so I’d have ‘Salty Willy’ in TBC.
---
It’s the 500 pound gorilla server. It’ll be the most populated and the place to be in 1 week or 1 year out. It’ll be the server all the hot drama happens on
---
WoW only has 1 expansion, FYI.
---
I know i will make a mage and a priest, but which first...
---
Finally! Cheers dude
---
it's a shame really. they're going through the effort of making sure realms are filling up before opening more which is proof they learned their lesson in vanilla. unfortunately they haven't said a single thing about faction imbalances, which are basically ticking time bombs for pvp servers.
---
Yep. They can bury him with his mounds and mounds of cash.  Poor guy.
---
A lot of people think that the game is not worth playing unless they get to level cap immediately and start raiding right away. Classic is the best version of the game to not do this.
---
Lmao, why are you saying sorry? First off I don’t play that steaming shit called retail WoW. And there is nothing wrong with liking a game. I’m just saying I’v seen it too many times where people like you get alllll worked up about a game before it comes out and are ultimately disappointed. I’m not saying don’t look forward to it, but a small dope of skepticism would serve you well. Relax buddy stop getting so offended, see how defensive you are lmao
---
Sleeping and working.
---
Best youtube videos for learning all the lore?
---
If every other server is full then maybe it's better for it to get full now than on launch day. Even the people that are joining are not of the 100% RP-PVP mindset they are probably more open adopt the style than people who would desperately impulsively join on launch day.
---
Dude that’s how time zones work. It literally couldn’t release everywhere in the world on the same day unless it released for different people at different times.
---
&gt;"Everyone else" meaning you and a few people? Alright xhief
---
I played on stormreaver (an OG server) at release of vanilla and it was always called VC then too. Don't be dumb, *xhief*
---
I think that you make a fair point. I don't think I agree completely but I appreciate your thoughts. I still think they could have been more transparent about their plans in rolling the servers out so I wouldn't have had to have my my guild-mates go through the frenzy of getting their names for what is going to be a third time. 
---
When they initially released the server list, our thoughts were, oh, these are the servers. Let's get our names on them. There was no definite plans to open more so we didn't have the liberty of knowing that we could just wait. That's why I think what blizz did is unfair. If they had made it more clear that they would have been releasing new servers up and through launch day, we would have planned it differently I guess?
---
Anyone else think this was a body of water with 2 weird rock formations in it? Or is it just me?
---
I haven't subbed yet.  
---
I will probably wait for new servers, after the currently announced new servers, to pick a server...
---
Normally i'd agree but for once googling came up empty, although I didn't really try to delve too deep.  Probably just used the wrong search terms ("Layering classic WoW") but yeah that's my experience.
---
This only for sword spec rogues?
---
I've been smoking crack and driving 40 over.
---
Ah, thanks! Classic WoW cooking sure does seem a lot different :) Really excited to delve into it now!
---
not really, its the login screen.
---
Ye, even leveling is going to be fun again!
---
I assume he means Epic quests? I'm used to seeing it presented the other way though, like 23+ instead of +23.
---
Hey I remember that Goblin
---
OP paid money to reserve a name. Asking him to give up the names he payed for because blizzard has little foresight is fucking stupid
---
Although the new servers may also fill up fast.
---
Not surprised since most lefties still use right hand for mouse anyway.
---
Only when server communities are already established. That won't happen for many months. 
---
Also, catering to crybabies is stupid
---
Check the timestamps, I cover daggers as well.
---
Help me!!! I am now considering tailor enchanting again haha! I'm so back and fourth at the moment, I've had too much time to think it over.
---
 I have a lot of friends playing and none will do enchanting so thought it could be nice to do it... But I think skinning is the smart decision and will likely go for it. 
---
I will decide on the day. Ha.
---
I think you're misunderstanding. We aren't just talking about queues. We are talking about people  being unable to even enter the queue:
---
&gt;Each of the Full realms has a LOT of characters to the extent that it may be more than can fit into the queue system. ***As a result, you may not be able to get into the queue when you want to play*** and even if you do, it will likely be a very long wait.
---
If you're a solo player and you're trying to get onto a server, are you going to keep trying to get into a queue that is literally full, or are you just going to hop to whatever "New Players" server they spin up 3 hours beforehand?
---
So now all the new solo players that you're talking about are going to "New Players" servers, which are low-pop, and will likely be the first to run out of players (if/when such a thing happens).
---
I play Guitar left-handed and it freaking sucks, but it's nothing I would change. Spent years in music lessons knowing I loved it but nothing ever clicked. When I left high-school one thing changed - I didn't have a teacher in my ear (who was Right-handed) explaining how beneficial it was to learn right handed from the start..
---
I taught myself guitar for about a month before showing my friends who all laughed their asses off. Turns out naturally I picked up a RH guitar and played it upside down - and read every musical notation upside aswell. Left-hand playing is innate to me, trying to force RH instruments down my throat for "simplicity" prevented my musical learning. 
---
Still get to listen to RH players telling me "why would you own a LH guitar" and the reason is because I can play right-handed guitars upside down cleanly but not the correct way at all.
---
Definitely let him try it out again
---
You think they do, but they don’t.
---
Oups, you are right, my bad.
---
Happe birthday and see you in Azeroth:)
---
I'll take that bet

You will reach level 12 and go to the Barrens together.
---
As an undead you will need to go to Orgimmar first and do not travel to Silverpine forest. Although you could go to Silverpine together.
---
Imagine believing that endgame in vanilla was easy when less than 0.1% of the playerbase had stepped into Naxx when the 2.0 patch released.
---
This is a typical 30/0/21 ele-resto build, with some tweaks for leveling.

Ah, I see. Might make it difficult to play with friends at the beginning but that's alright. How long is phase 1 expected to last?
---
Hello,
---
Is their any decision you have to make in classic that irreversible and really important to your game play experience?  (Besides faction/race/class)
---
After 3 months the only endgame available with be Onyxia and Molten Core. Are you suggesting that most players are psychic and will be able to judge the other 5 phases of content from that alone? While we're at it, remind me, how many content updates are confirmed for retail in the next \~2 years?
---
You can do whatever you like. If you wish a level 1 can run to the other races starting zone and level there together. But about level 10 you’ll be off in the world. Depending on level you sometimes have options. You will all end up at the barrens though. Only because I recommend that experience.
---
&gt;I played Cata to max level and did a few dungeons. As I said before it didn't keep me interested so I quit.
---
So you literally didn't do the content and said it was boring, gotcha.
---
&gt;The fact that Pandaria was Kung-Fu Panda: The Continent wasn't appealing to me
---
Except if you had played whatsoever, you would have seen that it wasn't, and had arguably some of the best raid, dungeon and pvp content the game has had to date.
---
Again pretty ignorant to look at the box art and assume that's what the game is.
---
&gt;If that makes me ignorant then what can I say I'm ignorant. 
---
Well stated.
---
&gt;You, on the other hand are clearly an annoying fanboy and should probably go fuck your hat.
---
Consider it fucked.
---
No we won't. But we sure will have a lovely time waiting in queue and complaining on reddit.
---
5 hours before release in the middle of a work day. Genius.
---
&gt;True fact: &lt;insert opinion here&gt;
---
Been known for a while. 
---
There are definitely things that I would like to change about TBC if possible, such as the green replacements like you mentioned (although the quest lore behind getting rid of legendary weapons was that we destroyed them to calm sargeras' sword magic, plus the new greens were azerite powered) I agree with the aesthetics of blood elves not really fitting into the horde, and flying can make things a little easier.
---
However, TBCs zones were absolutely huge. Way bigger than any single zone on azeroth, but that was partly because of flying being introduced. Also, how often does someone go back to a low level zone when they hit the cap? There are a few zones to go through such as paths to major cities, but how often is someone going to redridge or westfall as a 60? So they kinda diminished the end game content in terms of zones to the areas where there is actual end game content. There is probably a dozen or so actual zones that people go to on the regular at end game in classic and from a total land perspective, TBC takes it no question. Plus TBC reused some of the areas by including dungeons and raids in almost every zone so when you hit cap you still will go back there.
---
Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing another set of servers for TBC or even Wrath but after wrath it took a huge nosedive in quality
---
You can generally pick up another race's starting zone near their level 5 town (Brill/Razor Hill) if you wanted to go early. If you don't mind waiting a bit pretty much every Horde character is going to wind up in Crossroads on their own in the early teens.
---
Hi ignorant.

---
Yes, we know who buys gold to do reviews on autistic private servers does not like the idea of classic. We are also well aware of how terrible of a player you are (you're a grown man with kids and you still click your abilities). This leads us to believe that you haven't a clue what you're talking about, as the only thing you have a shred of knowledge about is garbage ass Pservers.
---
The 27th yeah?
---
Will try thanks.
---
Today is the first time I found the map.  Probably because I was looking for it.  I am pretty sure they can advertise per region though and when we log into the website it can say different dates by region?  I don't know, I still think it could have been advertised better.
---
... and through out the house,
---
Nothing was stirring,
---
Not even my mouse.
---
Serious question; what's the difference?
---
Problem is if they are going to do away with layering in a few weeks they have to impose the same limits each server will have at that point now, Layering is strictly to help with so many people being in one place at the start. So just hypothetically if a server with no layering is able to take 10000 players but at launch they just kept layering as much as needed for everyone to not have a queue and 20000 people join one server, in a few weeks they would not be able to stop the layering until 10,000 quit playing.
---
&gt; So now all the new solo players that you're talking about are going to "New Players" servers, which are low-pop, and will likely be the first to run out of players (if/when such a thing happens).
---
Yes, this is what I'm saying makes absolutely no sense. We have a ton of servers that are **beyond capacity**. People are going to jump ship the moment they see the enormous queue times and are gonna **flood** to the new servers. They aren't going to be low-pop. They're gonna be full in a matter of minutes.
---
That's the entire point.
---
As much as I hype myself up, I’m a father first, and those duties will always surpass WoW.  The biggest drag is my Fall semester of class starts on Tuesday at 0800 so I’m either pulling a 12 hour night or all nighter to class. We’ll see!
---
Going to be playing 4-10 hours a week. There is always space for people like me. Just appreciate you won't be rank 14 but it really doesn't matter. The game is years old and everyone has beaten everything already anyway! 
---
Plus with the resources out there now, it's much easier to play casual as someone has done all the theory/research for you.
---
Ah get that done weve got about 23 hours or so till launch! 😁👍
---
Awesome ty
---
You can meet up at any time and do any quests in any locatoin as long as they're suitable for your level.
---
It's quite a bit of walking to get from the Tauren starting area to the Undead starting area but it's not difficult.
---
Reminds of a duel i watched in wrath at goldshire where a ret paladin bubble hearthed out. Everyone was laughing as he does it.
---
Moments later hes running out of the inn as the duel continues.
---
Probably one of the funniest things ive seen in wow.
---
Honestly, DBM isn't a problem.
---
Omen, on the other hand..
---
My thought too. I remember that day and how bonkers HFP was. Left and made an alt instead because it was madness on that PVP server.
---
classic wow is the most casual friendly version of the game. There's zero incentive to rush through the game and you miss nothing by taking your time.
---

Casual player in 2019 thinks you can login to a game and click 10 daily buttons and still make progress.  This is not the case in Classic, so in that regard, you are wrong.
---
A complete instance (copy) of the whole world within 1 server.
---
The black shards in silithus around the cult you mention look just like the shards in deepholm, the place DW was being held. So yeah.
---
It's almost like... they had a planned storeline! But such black magics can't be true...
---
Have you restarted since installing the drivers? It sounds like the game is completely failing to talk to your video card.
---
Also, on the Advanced tab there's a drop down box that tells the game which video card to use. Shouldn't need adjusting for most setups but maybe check it just in case. If your video card isn't listed in that box at all then something has gone wacky.
---
hm
---
I made proper bank with enchanting back in classic. Then again, I played tons, raided tons and had a few faction first recipes (+4 all stats chest made me 100g/enchant for months).     
---
       
---
Also, being an enchanter while leveling, you're always capable of keeping your new gear enchanted when skilling up.     
---
      
---
I'm leveling with a dozen or so mates, plus whatever friends we make in our guild, so once I've given out a bunch of free enchants early on, I know a few of them will likely start mailing me some of the greens they find for mats. Same as I will do with mats I don't need. Whatever farming of materials I need, I'll do on my first alt after hitting 60.
---
each one of you reach level 5 in your starter zone them meetup together somewhere.
---
You can all do the same quests. Races are just for theme, diversity, and some race specific abilities.
---
It's crazy what some people will convince themselves of just to feel a little better
---
To give a simple explaination.. 
---
Layers are essentially login-based 'subservers' or 'phases'. When you log in, you will be placed in a layer of similar scale of a true Vanilla server(About 3k~ or so). You may change layers by grouping with someone from another, and zone/world chat channels function cross-layer. In essence. In your starting zone you will see a couple hundred, instead of a couple thousand people.
---
This is due to a predicted drop-off in playerbase by Blizzard and what we saw happen with OSRS before new content was added. It's not a doomsday or negative stance to assume, there will be less people playing by November than there is playing by the end of next week. 
---
This matters because very little cross-server functionalities exist in Classic, so a server dying off is much more devastating than it would be in the current, live version of the game.. and server merges have never been received well in the live servers. So Blizzard is attempting an alternative that would not be changing the actual game such as Private Servers introducing true Dynamic Respawning (Spawn rates changing on volume of people in the area). 
---
In essence. Layering allows the server to have a considerably higher player count initially, so that if the server population does diminish, it ends up in a healthier spot. With free server transfers being an option if the servers are still too overpopulated come Phase 2 (When Layering is removed due to the introduction of World Bosses).
---
Is the free trial until level 20 also for classic wow?
---
If yes, there a predownload for people who want to do the trial for it?
---
Thanks mom

---
22 seconds of ms paint?  nah man why would you think thats low effort?
---
Yeah, I made a video guide about the quests a few weeks back.
---
What you do as horde is pick up a quest from the engi trainers in org that'll send you to BB at that teleporter thing under the horde fp.
---
Then as long as you have the item he gives you, you can use the teleporter. If I'm not mistaken he'll give you a new item if you loose it
---
Idk why they remove “low effort” memes. 
---
Memes are basically just pictures with some words to go along with them. By their logic they should remove all memes because all memes are low effort content.

When you actually think about it, while 10x is obvious far out there, is it actually hard to believe the truly dedicated and retail tourists (still doubtful they flocked to name res a game they know nothing about) are only a fraction of the player base? I mean in americas alone there's a billion people, to think an mmorpg (arguably the greatest well-rounded mmorpg to exist on planet earth) isn't going to draw a new crowd? This isn't even considering the large pool of stubborn people looking to sub last minute.

Well it obviously wasn't a failure for Blizzard. I think that in terms of accomplishing what it meant for my group of friends, namely to find a server that we could call home and park our names on it, it was a failure... We're going to have to abandon our names and reroll due to pop issues. Blizzard is requesting that people reroll off of Full realms. Your friend is smarter than us.
---
I do fully understand the frustration, and I do apologizing for going very aggressive with my points. I just get generally frustrated when people try to attack someone for a different opinion, which the 'White Knight' comments more or less were. 
---
I don't disagree it could have been handled 'better', possibly with a FAQ or Q&amp;A in-between the announcement and period beginning, but I don't think Blizzard did anything that would justify any reason to compensate. 
---
In the end, I completely am sympathetic that you feel you wasted your money, but I do think for every criticism of how Blizzard handled it can be countered with a criticism of how you / your friends could have handled it.. and over-all I think the way that it has been handled is one of the more healthy routes for the game overall. Even if it's been a frustrating experience for you. 
---
In the end, it's a name reservation. If the server population is more important to you and your friends than saving your names.. than the simple truth is you guys should have waited.

Hey guys what's going on it's your boy coming at you with another ten minutes monetized video. In today's video we're going to be taking about something that could be something that could be summed up in three bullet points. Instead I'm just going to ramble my steam of consciousness into a microphone. Now one of the key things in this video is making sure you use the right inflections in your voice. Often times it doesn't even matter what words are coming out of your mouth. You especially want to avoid any sort of cohesion or structure in your video. Not obviously it goes with out saying that you don't want conciseness either. Even though it goes without saying, you absolutely want to make sure you say it. Again our main goal here is to get to that ten minute mark. Remember in high school when you would get a writing assignment and you were a third of a page away from the length requirement, so you would have to decide whether you would find something else to expand upon, or take a grade hit by ignoring the length requirement or trying to find ways to repeat yourself? This is kind of like that except instead I get rewarded with money by vomiting words into a microphone. Make sure to like, comment, share, subscribe, and ring the bell! It really helps my channel a lot and allows me to make more content like this.

TBC fleshed out the core game to where talent trees made sense and every class was now viable and still unique for their chosen roles. And speaking personally, flying didn't ruin wpvp at all; ganks, turf wars and city raids were as prevalent as they were in vanilla. 
---
Idk why people have these dumb delusions about TBC that they do, but I'm guessing they just got asshurt over something trivial and decided the whole expansion was whack from the start. 
---
Like, I'd be hyped to see classic+ content and all but only if they fleshed out the classes, talent trees and game itself like they did in TBC. Otherwise the game just ends up being boring like retail where everyone walks around like demigods in insane gear and classes don't change at all.
---
Hell yeah brother. I work a 12 hour shift in a couple hours AND have 3 classes tomorrow BUT WHO NEEDS SLEEP?? I CERTAINLY DON'T! ^(/s i actually have no idea how tf I'm gonna do it)
---
Lucky for us PvP Australians we only get one to choose from. No pressure.
---
Lol billion dollar company with 2 years to prepare shouldnt have an excuse for the issues that will arise they can see the player base rising they should address this by launch.
---
TFW your server is brand new and you were expecting people to flood it already?
---
I'm a major die-hard no-life player, don't get me wrong. However, unless the only alternative to WoW is like watching Wheel of Fortune or something inane, I think sedentary activities like reading would be more helpful in terms of "staving off Alzheimer's". 
---
There's certainly no harm in fun though.
---
What is this artwork from?
---
Classic was not peak
---
That's such a sad statement, I'm sorry you're in a situation where you can't express yourself.
---
No joke, I'm pretty sure your comment didn't say any of that lol
---
It also has the worst name
---
read his name.
---
look at his -6 comment karma.
---
read his comments (3 in total).
---
I'm not sure about you doing quests in their starting zone (although I believe you can to some degree).
---
The best option is to do your own quests until level 12 then pick up the same quests in the Barrens together.
---
Default UI for life, I even downloaded an addon that restored the old default UI when they fucked it up for some reason.
---
All those UI addons people say are better all look like absolute garbage, boggles my mind that they are more popular than just using the amazing default UI.

Nope, just a minimum of 300 blacksmithing no specialization required.
---
Yep. Wrath Naxx was only tuned like 10% harder than actual vanilla.
---
My shift at work starts at the same time classic goes live
---
Damn man. A Shame we have to have a seminar to be decent people...
---
Horde Gehennas :)
---
Dude...
---
doesn't that make it a feature, not a bug?
---
Any chance to see a WC one like this?
---
Same. Torn between Priest and Hunter. I love Hunters solo capabilities, but I also want to be desirable for groups
---
Nah, they get them out of a magazine I'm sure.
---
Oh I got cha lol I was just playin devils advocate
---
TFW you're playing on a shitty RP realm and the reason it isn't full is because most people playing aren't little RP weebs.
---
Your role as a paladin in dungeons above level 50 - 55 is to heal, yes. You want to look for gear that increases intellect and healingpower. Without gear like this, your heals will be quite weak and you'll run out of mana very quickly.
---
... Which is exactly why they aren't spinning up servers as fast as people would like. Because they aren't endlessly going to be doing it. If all servers are full and queue times are small they aren't going to continue making new servers lol.
---
It's like people are expecting them to be flat out dumb, when they have access to billions of data points that the armchairs devs couldn't dream of having.
---
They really do know more than you. Just chill.
---
Emerald Dream player checking in ;)
---
Anyone need a group of friends on Horde Grobbulos - add Durrian#1563
---
it's pretty equal - when the new servers go up tomorrow there'll be 20 total on US (18 American + 2 Oceanic) and 21 total on EU (13 English + 4 German + 2 French + 2 Russian)
---
They're convinced that 99% of the player base will quit after a week.
---
Chromie is actually a Bronze Dragon named Chronormu in disguise. She created a pocket-universe inside a room in a Inn inside of Andorhal to investigate the scourge for the Bronze Dragonflight.
---
If you want to see her in Classic go to the Ruins of Andorhal!
---
Wrath up to Ulduar.
---
Just commenting. I tested on a Celeron N3450 with 4GB RAM during the stress test and it ran at 40 fps~. Also tested on a MacBook with an i5 8th gen U ( dont remember exact model), and it runs over 100 fps with settings on 4. You shouldnt be worried about making or needing improvements to run on these specs. The laptop will do just fine.
---
Kill it before it lays eggs
---
WTB: Moody on Herod or Whitemane
---
Do you know if lazypig works for classic?
---
Chill man. This may be a garbage video but there's a difference between calling someone out and being a chore.
---
[Is this easier](https://www.wowclassiccountdown.com/) ?
---
Rip addons in general.. People fighting against LFG addon have no idea what kind of damage they're causing by forcing blizzard into this.
---
Especially before anyone even plays the game. It's just stupid how angry people get over game they aren't even playing, and have no idea how the group finding will be without addons like this.
---
People think they do, but they don't. Addons have enhanced gameplay experience for years, and only addon I'm glad has been removed was the one button addons for auto targetting debuff removal or heals, because that's very close to botting.
---
Oh ok, damn i'll be interesting to figure everything out by myself 😅
---
they have no long range pull and no taunt, so up to you if you want to put up with that
---
*pushes up glasses*
---
"Dont you know that the paladin and warlock mounts are inefficient for leveling because summoning them are spellcasts and therefore reset mana regen. its better to pay the one time cost. God. L2Play nub"
---
I don't believe you can treat all full servers.
---
Let's assume it takes 10,000 players to have a server turn to full (entirely guessing the number here). 
---
Herod might be at 50,000 while another server might be at 15,000.
---
That's going to be a massive difference in queue times.
---
Disregard the lfg imbeciles, only install that if you want to weaken a large social element of the game
---
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.
---
Unfortunately not. I won’t be able to buy game time until at least after the first of the month. Shitty, but rent comes first. I’ll be following along though
---
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
---
Best MC/BWL dps spec is absolutely 31/0/20. Yes you're throwing frostbolts, but... you're still an arcane mage. Bad meme. Shoulda gone with pally/ret.
---
Those are way outdated though. Anyway, I have no problem giving him money for his hard work. Did it anyway before all of this just to support.
---
You can only make 3 until tomorrow when they unleash the new servers.
---
I'm not sure why the number of characters per realm matters. It doesn't count all your characters separately since you can only be logged into one at a time.
---
Oh, to be clear, those people are not doing deadmines in groups. They are soloing it at like level 40+.
---
You will still get about 2-3 times the green weapons per health point of the enemy mobs farming deadmines as farming some specific mob for a drop (like gnoll punisher or the redridge machete), but If you aren't earning a lot of exp for it it just makes far more sense to either wait until you can solo it or just buy them off the auction house. Goblin screwdriver and defias rapier are actually pretty terrible weapons which are primarily useful for disenchanting.
---
They ask ut to spread out but dont give us enough servers to spread too, they are clueless abut what's coming their way...
---
&gt; 'Yay! We are HOME!'
---
Nearly cried :(
---
Class Balance maybe but no Horde Paladins, no Alliance Shamans, no Hunter Bloodlust etc. Homogenization was bad and I still think dedicated classes like Rogue/Mage/Warlock should shine above hybrid classes but all classes/specs should be atleast playable and not a joke.
---
Yeah. If people want to buy it go ahead, I just don't understand why someone would do that. Probably testy because I guess he's maybe one of them and I said idiots.
---
What world is this? Doesn't look like Azeroth.
---
The orginial plan was to roll on Golemagg since I got in to a guild there. That changed today when all my friends backstabed me and wanted to go over to Firemaw.
---
So we´re rolling on Firemaw.
---
I just downloaded battle net gain and subscribed, installed classic wow but didnt install retail wow again. This wont cause me any issues playing classic will it?
---
it symbolizes the horde/alliance brawls that are to come
---
Southern Indiana checking in...although I currently reside on Oahu.
---
This is going to be a complete shitshow isn't it?
---
My 2 weeks off work is going to be for nothing, isn't it?
---
You must not be familiar with this guy, he deserves it.
---
I'd say run "dxdiag" and see where it leads you.
---
It will be for Classic.
---
I'ma go thru dat
---
It was made to be less grindy than the rest of the genre was at the time (EQ, for example), but that doesn’t mean it was made for casuals.
---
Again, that depends, are you really going to use your profession to make money, that took takes effort and if you're willing to put in that effort anyway, what's preventing you from putting that effort into doing it with engi/bs.
---
Oh yeah that's it 
---
The easiest ones would be orc troll as they have the same starting area. Other than that itll be a little trek
---
You have an ability once you learn it from the class quests called "Beast Training"
---
When you open up beast training it gives you a window that shows you all your learned abilities (They're tied to your character)
---
In order to learn most new abilities, you need to tame a pet, let it use that ability until it gives you a chat message that it's learned, then it appears in your beast training book. You can then teach that ability to your other pets (as long as the ability works for that pet).
---
So if your pet has claw rank 3 and you want say, claw rank 5, you will need to find a new pet that has claw rank 5, use that pet's ability until it is "learned" into your beast training, then you can dismiss that pet and teach it to your old one, but other than that, the abilities don't upgrade on their own, you do need to catch new pets and use them to get the upgraded ranks.
---
If I go Druid Tank with Feral combat do you think I should focus on Cat or Bear form while leveling up? Since I'm playing with an Undead Priest (Healer) and Undead Rogue (DPS) by my side?
---
Lmao that’s cruel, but I’m sure I’ll be on the receiving end of something similar
---
There's a large number of players from the East coast on there, if finding raiding groups was your concern.  It's still hosted in LA, though.
---
Oh. I didn't know. Can you tell me what it is so I can look it up before deciding what to use?
---
who cares bro you'll instantly find a good guild organically once you're in the game, gonna be hundreds of guilds.
---
I would take 2 every time. TBC and Wrath could be cool but we'll just keep spreading and spreading. New content has the chance to be great and with how the devs have been doing pretty much everything right so far, dare I say, I have faith.
---
So if im playing on Skeram will i see other players like Leeroyjenkins - Herod also playing in the same areas?  Or is it locked by server
---
Clique had been updated as well as Vuhdo.
---
It's a good thing for luxuries like gaming guides, bad thing for necessities like medicine and the environment.
---
The free market works where it works, and absolutely fails where it fails.
---
Big F
---
For sure that makes perfect sense. Ty for the reply.
---
&gt;There is no rush, when the opponent is hopelessly lower than you. 
---
Speak for yourself.
---
I'm not a lore person, I don't even read quests. Gadget and southern STV, the lush oasis, the desert both being pirate havens is a cool atmosphere to me. Also ungoro is Jurassic Park, which is a win.
---
Unfortunately, I'm the only one in my group interested in wow.
---
Question from someone who hasnt been able to keep up with this.. How are they doing the loot in dungeons now? Is it back to rolling?
---
I remember many many fights. It was great
---
Wrath was peak WoW, it had the most active subscribers and heavily dropped afterwards.
---
So Alternate Universe Azeroth?
---
I don't plan on 'rushing' to 60 per se, more like get ahead and stay ahead :D I'd really like to have engineering during leveling, but I fear that hunting for ore will slow me down too much and I'll have to fight for every node and/or quest mob with hundreds of ppl along the way.
---
Bubbly charismatic people tend to play gnomes from my experience.  In classic, you’d be silly to turn away from such assets.
---
app is available but doing it manually is much easier imo.
---
I'll take a look at the quests for it and see what I can do.
---
Pls dont - every healer
---
See you in game buddy
---
My body aches looking at this
---
This is exactly why gaming is associated with a negative connotation now.
---
wrong. millennials are born somewhere between 88/89-mid 90's. anyone born in the early to mid 90's are gen x, or cusp babies.
---
the whole term means "growing up post 2000". anyone who was born in early-mid 80's grew up and spent their childhood in the 90's.
---
&gt; don't care either way.
---
So do you care one way. Just coming out as a liar. This is hilarious. Keeping wallowing. Come one, post again, explain how something else you said is wrong and try to double back.  This is hilarious.
---
Look I’m not saying your wrong, and if the dps is straining you and being reckless they are in the wrong. 
---
But as someone who mained a resto druid from MC to AQ40, it’s boring to run 5 mans and not have any challenges.
---
Obviously from instance to instance and various situations this will change; I just spoke up because I see this cut and dry sentiment so often about classic that it’s hard and people have to play a certain way, and that’s not how I remember the game.
---
Eh, I'd be for Horde Paladins and Alliance Shamans. 
---
The only thing worse than being stuck on a boss, is having that boss drop 2 pieces of unusable loot when it finally dies.
---
Campingfire*
---
I moved across the country and all my stuff wont be here in time. So i'm working with what I got lol
---
We wouldn't leave Shazzrah if you made a fucking server called Britain.
---
Shield spec provides rare utility, AK is half a spell. Imo utility cause you can drink between pulls and half a cost hardly seems worth passing up utility
---
There will be hundreds of guilds on each server. And promissing guilds will fail quickly, some new out of nowhere will form and do well. I wouldn't worry at all.  Just start the classic and you will make wow buddies in no time and guilds will be asking you to join. Get ready for join our guild spam.
---
Thanks for the heads up. I travel a lot for work so investing in a desktop isn't really ideal at the moment. Guess I'll just be happy with what I got for now. Thanks for the advice guys.
---
a true legendary weapon
---
It's not less populated any more... Skeram hit High today!
---
All I really want from TBC is the class balancing/reworks.
---
Yeah bro it has a 30 minute cooldown usually
---
You can't see or interact with players on other servers, no. However, if you have them on Battlenet as a friend, you can chat to them. That's about all.
---
*Promptly leaves*
---
Holy shit lmao
---
I honestly don’t know what they will do. It is more likely they will just continue the same storyline and release TBC. Mostly because everyone would complain and cry about them making a new storyline and adding new content into Classic. I am in the 5% that would love new content that stays true to Classic. We’ve already gone down that rabbit hole and it’s ended with Classic coming back out so why not create something new.
---
Everything is phased/sharded in bfa. They have more control over how they dynamically allocate resources. The same is not completely true for classic, since they are intentionally putting restrictions on layering
---
I couldn’t kill the final boss for some reason. If I remember rightly his health regen was more than I could deal in damage. There were never ending spawns maybe too?
---
Still a solid reminder.
---
Gen X or Cusp depending on where in the 80's you're born. I'm born 85 and consider myself Gen X, my gf born 93 and she is 100% millennial.
---
You can't do this in other mmo games? Lol
---
Hi born 85 and consider myself gen x, my gf born 93 and she is 100% millennial., I'm dad.
---
So uhh why did you take Monday off instead of Tuesday? 😲
---
I am so glad the Pacific launch is 3:00pm. Some people will still be at work and hell, some kids will still be trying to get home after school.
---
It might not bump my queue time down by much, but I'll take anything.
---
Considering Stalagg is "Full" you really, really shouldn't worry about it being low pop down the road. Blizzard has been trying to scare people off high pop servers (especially Herod) recently, so we can assume most servers are going to be absolutely stuffed even with layering enabled.
---
I know the graphics will be low, but I don't really see the processing power as being an issue.
---
Oh that's easy: you go solo and find a guild in game. There will be hundreds of guilds on every server and guilds advertising in the forums and here. No big deal.
---
Howdy!
---
My family struggles with addiction, especially in gaming, to the point where it can become destructive to our health. With Classic coming back, we thought it might be helpful to share how we're balancing our life but still enjoying the return to WoW. 
---
The goal of this post is to be helpful to others who might need similar check-ins, not to make any recommendations. 
---
Happy questing!
---
How is in any way racist you idiot.
---
Right, that he stole from the thread and reposted.
---
Check this out. Great Hunter pet resource. https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/training.php.
---
What is that in Freedom Units?
---
Warlock loses out to mages in raids though. Which is enough for many people to pass on warlock
---
Kinda hope if they go classic+ route we get proffesion mounts added down the road i mean instead of 300 skill levels up it in patch 1.3/1.4 and add the resources to boss drops in raids
---
Wonderful work! I thank you for the link and art.
---
For the record. I hate Brexit.
---
Dude went to Stanford and was as hard a worker as they come. Fuck off
---
Could you let me know how is RP? A friend wants to join that server for it being medium but i only played pve in vanilla and im really not into rp. Will it suck for me?
---
Just update all your drivers is really all you can do
---
And the cycle of abuse continues...
---
Honestly, then figure out what faction you want to play, if you you can't figure it out, then sure use population as a tiebreaker and roll alliance :P
---
Sometimes it's better to experience something when you're not exhausted. Staying up to midnight is no problem. Getting home after work and playing exhausted? He may have to relent to a nap before he's able to focus and have fun.
---
I was young in classic but still paid my own way with a paper route to many spoiled kids out there.
---
Flip the monitor around, put the keyboard and mouse up top, use it as a standing area instead of that hideous painting stool
---
No problem man. You’ve got a full time job and I’m so impressed with the content you have been putting out. It’s been a pleasure to see you and your brother emerge from the community these last years.
---
I think sticking with the original trilogy and stopping there is fine, actually.
---
I work Tuesday but am off tomorrow and as someone living in central time zone, yay! I can  actually play all evening.
---
Is...is this your kitchen?
---
wish I could +5 this one, awesome
---
You talk to others in character
---
If classic gets so huge that it would be worth creating new expansions it would probably pay off to just design the next expo for the standard game (BfA or whatever it will be then) to be more like classic.
---
If your mom is born 70s- early mid 80's she's Gen X.
---
The difference is that asking for more servers is a reasonable request. Wanting to be able to log in and play is perfectly reasonable. 
---
Asking to not be merged because, what, gold prices will fluctuate for a bit until the new economy settles? That's unreasonable. It's a non-issue. 
---
Just offer people on the realm a free transfer to ease the transition. It'll disperse the population and have an even smaller impact, if any, on their destination server(s).
---
It’s it a bit early to be pouring one out for all the others you’ve ganked?!
---
I’m all about dungeon healing so there’s absolutely no rush. I’m aiming for T 0.5 and that not out for ages yet. Might do some raiding later on down the line.
---
Most people just don't like dickheads shouting about how others spend their money. I personally couldn't buy an iPhone or lootboxes in a game - but I don't shit on others for their choice.
---
Your opinion is unwelcome.
---
It will be completely new, with its popularity it will be foolish to put out a BC remake for free.  If they come out with a new Classic-like expansion they will make $50 from each player.
---
ecks dee I hate sportsball football man took my crush
---
People playing retail need to get capped and raiding within 2 days and be BiS decked out within a week, otherwise they just throw a fit and ragequit.
---
I specifically wrote I didn't care if he thought I was lying or if he was going to find it himself.
---
&gt;Yes, that was my idea. I think it would be a good chance for them to implement/avoid implementing things people don't like from the current game and give people a fresh story without everyone being a "chosen one".
---
Bigot.
---
Hunter: do u need lol
---
It is back to rolling, each boss drops 1 item (some certain ones or raid bosses will drop more) and you are given the chance to roll Need, Greed or Pass
---
Always attack gnomes.
---
I foresee a spike in speeding tickets tomorrow
---
Zandalar for now but i will most probably go to a new PVE server when it lunches on mondaym
---
I mean there is that but JFC remember when Metzen told us how supercool the Deathwing fight was going to be? And it ended up to be a hallway of 30 second burn phases in the sky and a dragon manicure before we bashed his unmoving skull in?
---
wat
---
&gt; I know Druid can be an uphill battle of viability and skill but what about gearing? How much of a headache will it be getting PVP gear for various Druid specs? Seems like decent Stam/int gear isn’t going to be easy to find in phase 1.
---
People think they aren't viable, but viability counts for the top  1% of guilds.
---
With that said, super easy to gear, as a healer it's fast to gear since you're a healer. For feral/balance a bit harder due to competition for gear but still not that bad.
---
As for stam/int/spellpower, not hard to find, just all casters are after those.
---
&gt; You definitely covered their amazing survivability and mobility in BGs but is their damage too “slow” to be useful in BGs? There’s a lot of talk of how great they are in open world PVP and duels but the videos I’ve seen do seem to be a bit long and grindy. Are both feral and balance not bursty enough to fit into the BG meta as damage dealers?
---
For BG's not really worth going damage as a druid, not enough burst to take out key targets, you have other priorities you could be doing better at. Usually heals turn a fight more than trying to slam out 100-200 more DPS.
---
BG meta has druid as FC/node capper
---
Imagine all the times throughout your life you had to "take a couple seconds" add them all up and you've spent weeks of your life that could have been spent farming
---
If I were you I'd just go PvE server and roll warrior from the start. Leveling isn't THAT bad, and there will be plenty of other people around during launch so that you'll have no trouble grouping up for the more difficult quests.
---
England fell. You lost.
---
Dude, have you not seen the clip?  The guy who said it was smug as hell; of course people aren't going to let him live it down.
---
He doesn’t struggle with timezones lol. A lot of resources, even google, points to the 27th in the US without giving the timezone reference. It’s completely understandable that a casual player who doesn’t follow ever post or every blue update would assume it would be the 27th. Stop being toxic.
---
Where I live Classic launches on Monday at 6pm 👌🏻
---
Ive already seen zoomers having nostalgia over Legion on this sub, it's inevitable.
---
I agree with class balancing in the sense of "every spec should be playable" but I still think pure classes should be stronger than hybrids and some buffs should be class unique. No hunter pet bloodlust and stacking every different type of class/spec should be rewarded with access to their buffs rather than some buffs not stacking (I believe that last one started in TBC?), that would also be a good way to encourage you to bring hybrid DPS classes if they did less damage than pure DPS classes but made up with it in utlilty/raid buffs or boss debuffs.
---
Stick to your guns I'd say! 
---
If you've never leveled enchanting before, it's such an expensive and pain to level. Unless you plan on hardcore committing to it, skinning or another gathering would be better. Extra income off a lot of mobs you kill can help pay for enchants rather than doing it yourself. The extra money will help everything. 
---
I myself know I have limited time to play so I'm going tailor/skinning and will pay out of pocket for any enchants
---
Is there any better stats add-on yet? Kinda bummed the UI went back to not showing full stats again for casters.
---
Lol @ "freshest server" on a launch day
---
i dont think mage is a 1 key rotation i know they apso need to decurse a lot in mc at least
---
i did mc as a healer for the first time yesterday
---
managing mana was the biggest challange 
---
i like the added responsibility of positioning and keeping the tank and raid up
---
downranking dispelling boping you will be doing a lot
---
Wait a minute, that's illegal.
---
Shazzrah Alliance. Can't wait :-)

Scatman

You are not healing prot you are a holy paladin whit blessing of sanctuary https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxubgkxxGp0Mu
---
At the time of its release it was much harder in other games. Consider all the open PvP full loot games...
---
i for one will be waiting in the queue while watching The Cowboy Bebop Movie or some episodes of Venture Bros Season 1
---
Send everyone else a post card from your awesome vacation in Azeroth!
---
I'm not sure this is really a bug.  I think it comes down to, in some places the client is trusted to say the player shooting the ranged weapon is stationary, in others the server has to confirm it.  I think it's an unintended mechanic, however.
---
TFW you make your own work schedule.
---
&gt;play some catch up with the other filthy casuals
---
You disgust me.
---
little coward
---
&gt; When you actually think about it, while 10x is obvious far out there, is it actually hard to believe the truly dedicated and retail tourists (still doubtful they flocked to name res a game they know nothing about) are only a fraction of the player base?
---
Yes it is hard to believe, and no I don't think there is that many more people than the dedicated and the "retail tourists". It is the internet. If people are interested in classic, chances it is on their radar and they are subbed or plan on subbing soon, and I don't think those that plan on subbing soon in any way outnumber those that are already subbed. WoW is has a big fanbase, but it ain't that big, especially not these days. 
---
&gt; (arguably the greatest well-rounded mmorpg to exist on planet earth)
---
And this is delusional fanboy talk. Classic WoW has its perks and things that set it apart from BFA and other expansions, but it is not the most well rounded mmo or even the most well rounded out of the other expansions (BC/WOTLK probably was). And most people realize that on some level anyway. If it was truly the second coming of mmo's then even the majority of the fans wouldn't expect the population to drop drastically within a couple months. Instead they'd expect it to do what it did originally and just keep gaining subs.
---
No. You don’t have to rp on rp servers. You just need to be respectful and not try to be an asshole. I’m not an rp player but I do like seeing people rp around me.
---
I’ve never played a pve server before as I think it takes a lot of the danger and so the immersion out of the game. Pvp all the way
---
Not that significant,but do you truly care about min/max, or what you have to stare at for hundreds of hours?
---
I'm just here to throw my VC in with everyone else's VC

Gromsblood - used for Flask of Titans and other pots

Great to farm in Felwood with a few others in the area too

We will be joining silent bvb thunder on myzreal (na pve)

If he needs convincing then don't bother. Play it yourself and once he sees how much fun you're having he'll want to. Or not, and then it's no big loss.
---
Classic+ is something i look forward to also i dont mind adding BC and WotLK as long as the level cap stays at 80 and they dont add the things like Dungeon finder back in after wotlk there was a wide possibility of stuff they could implement story wise but never did and went straight to cata i mean azeroth was fine with 3 major island and 3 major town hubs "dalaran ad a neutral, horde ogrimar and alliance ironforge/stormwind"
---
Also no flying please i dont mind the mounts itself but make them flyable with the flight paths and instead increase the land speed with certain mounts
---
Was the layering thing they were talking about just for people in a group together?
---
I had my 780ti until the 10 series dropped. Was getting artifacts and sent it in for a replacement. No 780 tis around, got a 1060 instead. You can absolutely get better replacement cards for within 3-5 year warranty stuff np
---
I think the best suggestion was from Kevin Jordan:
---
Take all of the existing assets from future expansions and reuse them to create new content and expansions that maintain the philosophy of Classic.
---
Unfortunately, it's not the most cost effect option, so it is unlikely.
---
bell-end
---
for addons, do i just download the normal version and then stick them in the classic folder?
---
IE recount latest? 
---
or would they have classic versions?
---
Thanks. I was hoping it was going back to ther old school loot
---
Who ever the artist was, legendary quality work!
---
Premade PvP is also easier. Paladin heals ftw.
---
This is so frustrating, why cant they just deliver the original game?
---
Fair
---
I have mass sleeping problems only way to get good sleep is drinking and I don't like to drink. Maybe just this one night to get rest lol.
---
The pain...
---
Ye the global part of it is the only thing I dislike.    
---
If it was limited to where you are I'd have no issue at all with it.
---
Yup which ever one has the lowest Que times I will transfer later on to a dif server
---
Classic is not the "press the glowing buttons" piano simulator yet that is retail. Everything is slower and, let's say, more delicate. If you want to be busy, tank or heal is the best bet, as DPS are mostly very simple and straightforward. If you minmax tanking/healing, it becomes like a chess game of good positioning, managing consumables, choosing the right rank from your various healing spells etc.
---
Play WoW Classic but don't have any expectations of raiding in a month.  Great game to take your time with despite what you hear on here.  The quest system is much more immersive it is NOT a race to 60 unless you've already done it a few times. 
---
Log on and chill out fishing for an hour or two.
---
Spend a day getting all the quests for a dungeon at the end of a questing zone. Then spend the next day lfg and run the dungeon.
---
By the time you do hit 60, could be in 3ish months, you'll feel great like you accomplished something real. Then you can take your time going through endgame dungeons.
---
Here and there hit up a battleground, you dont need to be minmaxed just go at level X9 (29, 39, etc) so you're at least not super outmatched.
---
It might not be for everyone but let me tell you that living in a world of transmogs and level boosts and mounts in starting zones and sharded zones where you get instanced out from the community SUCKS.
---
Getting to the endgame content in classic feels good because of the journey it was getting there. Getting to endgame in retail take no effort and then it gets stale.
---
Nice, I will check it out, thanks!
---
For a Paladin would it just be best to roll Herbalism and Alchemy to sustain my own flasks especially if I dabbled in Ret which benefits from both spell power and attack power?
---
&gt; Wrong universe 
---
Not with enough Skooma
---
I had a passing thought this morning that, since I already have a background I like, that I should change my laptop's lock-screen to the vanilla log-in screen as a tribute.
---
Then this comes along a few hours later and meets my need.
---
Thanks for the timing.
---
But that's still tactics, you just can't keep up, which is fine. But saying there are no tactics is just wrong.
---
Yes. Log in queues are expected for every server that has medium and above population. Blizzard has stated that if worst come to worst, they have emergency solutions to handle the huge influx of players.
---
They haven't stated what this is, but I imagine they will launch more servers no matter what happens.
---
We brits are hardcore so we only play pvp servers
---
fucking weeb
---
Played rogue and hunter in vanilla, but then again, I was 15. When a shaman swooped down and saved me with earth ele in hellfire peninsula at the start of TBC, its been all about shaman and paladin healing since then for me. Want to try that in vanilla aswell, and since all RL friends are going alliance, its paladin for me.
---
First time drawing anything? Are you 2 years old?
---
What was I wrong about?
---
Stop with the PSAs
---
Numbers don't lie my friend, historical sub counts prove this whether you like it or not.
---
Y'all need to realise that the stones do different things. Yeah, you'd probably die touching the power stone (like in GOTG and endgame) because, like the name says, it's the power stone. The most phsyically strong one. 
---
The stone Strange uses is the Time stone which is in a sense "weaker" in that a mortal should be able to hold it (sidenote, didn't the Hulk and the Ancient One also just hold it?). Even then, Strange didn't use the stone "all the time" as it was inside of the eye for a reason (protection / channeling powers). And I'm not sure, but I think Strange is more powerful than a mere mortal thanks to his magic abilities.
---
I pity people who are so out of shape and have such poor stamina that they need energy drinks.
---
L and M are taken.
---
For Launchday. Is there a way to get not disconnected from the charakterloginscreen? I tried creating a new char after 15 min, try to rightclick but was kicked after 30 min
---
All races have something for pvp, and shadowmeld is definitely nice.  In actual full vanilla it was even better, as for much of vanilla only ending a cast removed shadowmeld.  Even with that, being invisible, even if stationary, is quite solid in pvp.
---
Rand Al'thor?
---
The "lone-wolf" experience (when you play solo) is really addictive in classic because you constantly meet new people while leveling and ask for their help (group up) because questing is hard sometimes.
---
Also, because your own faction can "steal" mobs from you...its better to group up.
---
So the Vanilla questing experience is the best out of all MMO's...because you quest...group up with strangers....quest...group up with starngers...quest...meet the same stranger.
---
I love Classic leveling experience.
---
I’m going for full beard (tabards are mostly hidden on Dwarf Priests anyway) but with the light brown/tan colour. Also, the long ponytail - it waves about a big while healing. It all looks fantastic with the Tier 0.5 dungeon set.
---
No shit. We've always known there's gonna be a huge drop off after the tourists leave. This game isn't for everyone.
---
I got that error. Had to update my graphics card driver and then it went away
---
you can twomen dme with a bit gesred fury warrior.
---
always 3 bosses with loot and 2 thorium nodes
---
You need to find classic versions. Many have them already, but you’ll have to make sure it is the compatible version for classic.
---
A guy named gleadr would spam orgrimmar trade chat with a wall of text on a regular (so much it almost seemed like it's all he did)
---
The text had somethig to do with being tired of "tweedly little gnimes" and some other shit and the guild was called flowers of broke back mountain
---
Wod would be flgreat without content droughts, which if they redid it like classic there wouldnt be content droughts
---
OMG A VET! Can... can I touch you?
---
I'm sorry, wut? I'm a coward because I looked into moving to Canada?
---
What? You can farm savage gladiator in 1 day
---
Hi sorry, wut? , I'm dad.
---
Oh thank you, I had seen the survey itself, but not the comment results yet.
---
I have (only now) noticed that there are a few server names which don't appear in my actual serverlist (e.g. Flamelash, Mograine etc.). Is there any info on when these servers will be added or am I missing something else?
---
No it only means the queues will be extreme
---
If you decide to stay on stalagg and go alliance, my guild is recruiting! Pm me for details
---
I swear haha. That server name is epic.
---
Weird, played on a server, would login not that often, get a few levels, logout. Still had a great time, plenty of interactions, ran dungeons, people hit me up for stuff all the time.
---
Meanwhile in retail "oh you didn't login to do the dailies, you're permanently behind now".
---
Something something egg timer.
---
Thanks! I found it on Curse.
---
Pretty much everything is exactly as it was in original patch 1.12, except for some relatively minor graphic updates (dat water tho) and battle.net integration
---
A few bugs have been fixed also I believe
---
What makes you say that?
---
Visit Japan's nice forest before posting shit tier threads

---
I would be in the New York release time and this actually just made me more depressed. I can’t play until the 29th so I guess I’m missing 1 more day of classic than I thought :(
---
Tfw colts fan and the only thing stopping me from killing myself after this is classic wow
---
You'll enjoy the hours you get to play so much more I think, and you definitely won't burn out so thats a definite plus!
---
Shield specialization is dogshit, don't trust any guide that say you to go for it. they didn't think deep enough about it, and didnt test it either probably. 
---
The thing is that ppl miss, that Lower level shield that you gonna be using while leveling, even good once, have super low block value (you can look it up on any database), increasing it by 25% gives almost nothing. And you need to block an attack in the first place.
---
The main reason you use shield and why it is effective, cos it gives a shit ton of armor. and this talent doesnt change it whatsoever. so with or without this talents, its the same really, you don't feel any effect of it. 
---
not to mention you are with 2h, 95% of the time and use you mana to self heal and spells literally all the time, so this talent is ever present.
---
mana talent is not the best one ofc, but it can make a break some (on the edge of dying) situation when you close to dying. and you need that one spell, that one heal, or interrupt. it basically gives you one more spell, even of lower ranks (for instance for some key slow or interrupt in pvp or pve). If you play a vanilla shaman you know how fast you drain your mana. so its decent and can save you life. mana is one of the most important resources for a shaman while leveling, its all about mana managment ofc 5% isnt much but still. usually when you die you ran oom.
---
Also it very helpful when you switch to healing gear, when you need to heal a 5man. As you get more mana and it all scales. 
---
even in case of 1000k mana, if you would have this talent you maybe with 50 mana left and couldnt cast a thing, and this talents gives you addition 50, so it sums up and you get one heal as a result. which can make or break some fight or situation while leveling.
---
Sugar diet does it, like having diabetes without really having it.
---
Thankfully I was 16/17 already. Part time job during college. My parents would have never paid a subscription for a video game. :/
---
He finds it aestheticly pleasing and wants to incorporate it in his gaming experience. Stop being a troll. You are better than this. See how stupid you are being?
---
Yep... time to get excited when you get a full set of 10 slotters
---
Sorry for your feelings.
---
Doing the same as i did in classic: play whatever class i feel like playing that day.
---
It's not like i'm gonna race to world first anything, so why bother? I'll start with mage to 60 eventually, but i'll slowly level a shaman and rogue as well whenever i feel like it.
---
I’m switching from warrior to rogue because I’ve become even more cruel in the past few years.
---
you mean a real server? ya i guess so.. ill have more HK's then you by the end of vanilla 100%
---
Sick
---
30/0/21 shaman for sure. deals insane burst damage for pvp and has enough resto for dungeons and raids.
---
Right? The itemization on pretty much everything was trash pretty much until Naxx. Plus they didn't have the whole item level thing down then so it's all over the place. If you want it to continue past Naxx the fights are going to be insane or they will have to do some Sunwell/ICC debuff bullshittery.
---
Whats this mean? Im just talking lol.
---
I’ve been playing on private server all weekend. I know leveling on a sever I’ll probably never visit again is pointless but I had nothing better to do lol
---
Mostly for the sake of convenience to be honest but also the benefit of being a profession which is always in need so the gold it generates is nice too. 
---
I feel like going with the typical Miner/Blacksmith there's a limited market/upgrade path save for one or two items (Lionheart or Titanic Leggins) whereas Alch touches on things everyone needs.
---
It'll just feel weird picking flowers instead of smacking rocks.
---
Haha, this comment is gold. So true!
---
How am I supposed to know how my dps is as the tank is in ragefire chasm?!
---
Nice shitpost
---
Pray.
---
RemindMe! 20 hours
---
Lol no shit.
---
Blizzard themselves expect a 70-80% player dropoff...
---
tis but a humble downvote farmer
---
My dad works at Nintendo, so he's gonna let me in first.
---
Or not
---
Just as a side note. Some of the quests have awesome story lines, witty humor, and/or pop-culture references to the early 2000s. Don't just smash accept as fast as possible. Take your time the first time through. They made a deep game.
---
Get him to roll an Undead Priest and grow your relationship through the struggle to 60.
---
very true, the obamas just purchased a $15 million estate after exclaiming that some people are gonna need to give up a little pice of their pie so everyone else can have some too.
---
I disagree.
---
Agreed.  A couple of my friends gave me the whole "i don't have time" speech also.  They are just like me, adults with full time jobs and not married.  Like if you just don't want to play WoW just say so lol.  
---
I plan on playing about 15-20 hours a week personally.
---
I highly doubt the people on faerlina are going to move. The majority are on that server because they know streamers are there and want to be apart of that.
---
OSRS says otherwise.
---
If you aren't even able to start raiding until ~9 est I would highly recommend going west coast. Most raids start in the 7-8 pm local timeframe so you'd be looking at a 10-11 pm start time and 1-2 pm end time.
---
We will certainly.. welcome them
---
it is 100% a bug that it takes as long as it does atm. It's well over the server ping right now by many many times.
---
big if true
---
Hope for a phase shift
---
Uh blood elves would be a great npc faction similar to goblins.
---
Dungeons, raid, and PvP. Same as on private Vanilla servers.
---
I agree, in vanilla I didn’t bother doing this chain because it was so hard and the gear was so bad.
---
didnt take any of this serious till he whipped out the printer paper XD.
---
Dafuq
---
Just roll on a 'medium' pop server and pay the transfer fee when it becomes available?
---
no1 will be 60 first week on a full server,  especially a full pvp server
---
Who gives a shit what happens? Play it until you're done with it.
---
Cause I was super dumb dude. It cracks me up.
---
boomers dont even play video games
---
&gt; pepehands
---
you are the worst kind of person
---
Yeah i kinda figured he doesnt just enjoy drawing :D indanely good picture
---
Not exactly. You either get into the queue or you get disconnected with an error message.
---
Blizzard made a post saying they expanded the queue capacity and made a specific error message for it so that you no longer get disconnected with a generic message.
---
Even with the higher capacity, I'd expect a lot of people to see the error message on the most popular realms.
---
Let's say 1.5 million people try the game, and 80% of them quit after a few months.  That's still 300,000 more than enough to fill up several servers, finally able to legally play a game they love.
---
prot pally could tank whelps in onyxia maybe nefarian
---
I played Vanilla but then didn't buy BC right away so I waited a couple of months. Once I started all the zones were ghost towns. I guess that's when they started accelerating leveling and the end game became the content and leveling just annoyance to go through has fast has possible.
---
Vanilla WoW was made to be casual friendly. This means there is so much to do while leveling.  The story line is also different from most games these days (including MMOs). There is no big bad. There are lots of little story lines while leveling up that it feels like a real world. Towns have their own problems that you help solve. Sure, there are plots that are bigger, but they are in the background.
---
I remember once flying across the Eastern Kingdoms down to Stranglethorn Vale from the Undercity and I remember crossing over this giant mountain: Blackrock Mountain. I remember looking down and seeing giant monsters that I couldn't even see the level of. I didn't know what this place was, but it looked harsh and dangerous. And I couldn't wait to get there and explore it.
---
WoW was made for a different time. It's not going to give you quick cut scenes. It's going to let you play the way you want to play. It's an older style game that doesn't exist anymore.  
---
Retail WoW isn't bad (Okay, I don't know, I haven't played), but it's a completely different game. Same with ESO.  It's different (though ESO is closer to WoW Classic then Retail WoW, but that's not saying much). The game evolved for many reasons. Partly because the player base evolved and changed (not everyone is going to enjoy Classic, and that is fine). They also tried to solve problems. WoW Classic doesn't make it easy to play with your friends. They have to level up 60 levels, and then gear up after that. And the leveling experience doesn't prepare you from the end-game. The style of play is different.  So of course they are going to try to improve things over time. This wall of text is all to say that WoW Classic had it's problems, and no one forgets them. But it also had it's parts that made it loved, and WoW Retail lost those things. But just because something isn't perfect doesn't mean you don't love it.
---
I think at the very least, it's worth giving it a shot. Maybe it's not for you. But I know for myself, I loaded up the game during the stress test, and it was like a breath of fresh air. It was the game I remembered, the game I longed to play again.
---
Yes. You can speed it up though by quickly leaving the starting area after you do the first few Tauren quests and booking it to the Orc starter area. A major source of rep is doing quests, but you don't get reputation for quests below your level. So if you start out in the Orc starting zone to the south of Orgrimmar you'll get a head-start by getting all that Orc rep.
---
Back in vanilla my buddy bought 1000 gold for 30 usd. Kul tiras alliance side, around 2005 some time, not sure the exact date.
---
No its rng.
---
You can try to get on at 5:30 and hope you get in, but what if your internet goes out or you lose connection to the server?
---
There is no getting "ahead"
---
Zero
---
I told my husband at the beginning of the month. He's not much of a gamer really, and I took some time off from work.  He's not thrilled that the first couple days I'll be busy but after that I just need to balance some TV and dinner time but also get some play time in.  And wake up early to get in a bit before work ;)
---
You've been together for awhile so just tell him.
---
human racial + doggo is insanely good against rogues tho
---
Priest or Rogue?
---
Oh nice, he is the software engineer who made it happen. I thought he was another streamer or something.
---
Wait you mean this *wasn't* a troll?
---
You mean classic is nothing like retail?
---
holy shit lol
---
Almost looks like someone plucked this directly of the game into the real world.
---
Never played before. Any tips or thing to know if I play this?
---
don't burn me alive.
---
PSA: Some people only have time to play one game. Also, not everyone wants to devote their free time to a game where they have to start from scratch. There's a good reason why these people haven't moved on to play other MMOs in the first place. WoW Classic is essentially just another MMO. People with little time don't want to juggle 2 MMOs at once.
---
I *really* liked the niches each tank had in TBC: Paladins good at AOE threat/taking lots of smaller hits, Druids good at single target threat and stronger health/armor (mitigation), and Warriors in the middle ground but with the best avoidance.
---
Yes, but why wouldn't another addon that provides exactly the same bars be good enough, why does it *have to* be the ones summit uses?
---
Don't tell others how to play, ty.
---
your experience is what you choose to make it
---
what about pom pyrio
---
I don’t think any are actually on the east coast.
---
Nice dude can you hook me up.
---
Flip, bop, dip, tip, you name it, male night elves does everything, even other male night elves.
---
Omen Threat Meter is what I've used.
---
I feel like we players need a secret code/handshake.  Like what if the girl that visits you plays WoW, but she's just like you and keeps it to herself.... 
---
I don't know if the horde logo is too recognizable...?
---
Stick to quarantine
---
Spam tab and charge and pray for an unlucky critter.
---
Wtf dude op is talking about the cannonballs that knock you into the water - what are You smoking?
---
Only realy works if everybody has the addon though.
---
TBC was great for class balance and content and world PvP still wasn't completely dead in the early stages.
---
I think druids were probably too strong in 2v2 arenas, but it was manageable.
---
Props getting featured on MrSuicideSheep, only the prettiest of work on there my dude :).
---
Thanks man, same I been playing games since I was a kid with my dad and this time since I can’t play with my dad anymore, I want to play with my brother so at least I can have the old feelings back, and hi I hope you enjoy the classic tomorrow
---
Classic is nothing like Vanilla? Did you mean retail because if it’s nothing like vanilla I’m pretty sure a lot of us will be very disappointed
---
this ^
---
"Classic is nothing like Vanilla"
---
And thats where i stopped reading.
---
As a druid, probably barber shops, and being able to change the colour of my fur in cat form based on the colour of my characters hair.
---
Capitalism is good.
---
Flight
---
Started with a pally originally, decided to flip it up and roll shaman
---
It's going to get awkward fast if you keep talking like this.
---
I’m not saying it’s impossible. I’m saying it’s impossible to do it on the basis of choosing the best race for each class. 
---
Unless you have a different definition of best than me, your list is not best. Gnome is not the best mage or warlock. Tauren is not the best Druid. 
---
Troll may be slightly better than a Tauren for pve as a hunter but not pvp. Warstomp to escape is much more valuable than haste. This point speaks to what I continue to try to explain to you. You can’t be the best in both pvp and pve — let alone without duplicating any classes. 
---
Classic is rock paper and scissors. These are the rules that govern race and class selection. Gnome is not a best race for anything. Troll is only the best for a priest and mage, if you’re doing pve. Tauren is not a best race for anything. Dwarf is only the best for priest. Human is the best for warrior, paladin, rogue, mage, and warlock. Orc is the best for warrior, shaman, rogue, mage and warlock. Nelf is best Druid. Undead is best pvp priest and mage on horde. 
---
You will have duplication and some races not used at all if you try to pick the best races for each class. This is why your question is bad. And as I’ve said from the start, since you don’t want duplicates — then pick the races you want based on some other criteria than which is best for each have class.
---
Again, real apples to oranges here. Being in favor of an addon that might make one of the more trivial parts of WoW clasic, be slightly less...trivial, doesnt equal wanting retail, my friend. 
---
We'll see how it pans out, but I played a ton of classic. And the amount of groups that fell apart waiting for that one last member that we couldnt find for a dungeon group was disheartening. Easing that frustration doesnt seem like a bad thing to me. But, to each their own.
---
Very few people will get rank 14, as there are brackets which only allows a certain percentage to stay in a bracket (or something like that) so being rank 14 is more like the exceptional exception. It takes so much time, it's insane
---
Can't wait to tell you to fuck off in-game after making you walk all the way to the instance
---
&gt; Is there any truth to this?
---
I am literally testing this right now.  Been logged in for ~15 minutes, tabbing back to the screen to click around between characters every few seconds.  In another ~15 I'll update and let you know if it forced me out.
---
Assuming it does kick me, then my plan tomorrow is to log on ~27 minutes prior to launch.  If it doesn't, I'll probably log on a few hours early and just screw around on reddit/youtube until launch.
---
Sorry, but I rather not let the government tell handle my medicare. Look how that turned out with our student loans.
---
Quick. Buy stonks in Blaumeux.
