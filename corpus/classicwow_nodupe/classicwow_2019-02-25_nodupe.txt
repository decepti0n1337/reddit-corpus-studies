The launch is going to be a dysfunctional lag fest. If you think you are going to be able to quest on launch night you're mistaken. Might as well wait for the day after.
---
---
---
&gt; Warlock requires 3 people to summon, so if you have to summon one of your three, it's going to be a hassle asking strangers to help.
---

---
Was it a thing in Vanilla to summon one of a group of three, ignore the summon pop-up, hearth, repair, buy shit for the group, then accept summon?
---
Essentially giving the group a 30 minute hop to SW to buy shit then continue on your way loophole?
---
Thanks but I played vanilla and I never heard it called VC. In fact I heard it as VC for the first time in this subreddit actually 
---
Heavy disc with some holy is actually better for survivability and damage geared correctly. I did this back in the day, t2.5 with dps trinks and power infusion = 2k smite crits and many melted faces.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I loved shadow though, so much damage and utility &lt;3
---
&gt; the price of these kind of things only goes up, so (if chosen wisely)
---
sweet, that's awesome. I was worried I would have to buy the game again, which would literally make it my 4th or 5th time buying vanilla WoW alone, upon subbing. 
---
thanks for the info. 
---
damn you powered through that shit eh lmaooo
---
I‚Äôll give ya 30 bucks for em, take it or leave it. 
---
Devilsaur mafia existed during vanilla? Or are you talking Pserver. 
---
&gt;I said it's hard
---
No you said people aren't "good enough" that implies skill.  The rest of your argument is worthless without the word hard having been used.  
---
You claim you aren't negative but here's some of the things you've said in this discussion:  "waaaah, waaaaah" a response to someone saying naxx gear shouldn't be better than pvp gear.  While I agree with your point that naxx gear is fine you used an extremely negative approach to convey your point.. essentially calling the other person a cry baby.  Next you used sarcasm in a reponse to me saying I was "enriching the forum", sarcasm is another negative comment and typically does not illicit "enriching conversation" especially when what you said is so ironic it blows my mind that you even said it.  Next you respond again by arguing my point by saying you said "hard" which you never did, so now you're lying to try to win an argument.  Then you called me annoying and that I'm not replying to what you actually said, which is again ironic because you're the one not responding to what you actually said.  Then you called me a liar, which as far as I can tell I didn't lie and at the very least didn't attempt to.  I would consider your sarcasim and cry baby mockery personal attacks, but that's more up to interpretation so I guess I could see your strawman, but it again wasn't my intent.  Next, you curse at me and claim to have blocked communication.  This is also negative, but a net positive for me.
---
Nothing in Vanilla is remotly close to a DH.
---
It's not just people with vs people without. Naxx gear scales up damage far higher than it scales up survivability. This results in pvp becoming far bursiter than it should be. The pvp game at Nax gear level sucks. 
---
Wait, why wouldn‚Äôt you want 3/3?
---
50% to 65% is a huge difference and makes aoe grinds much easier 
---
Honestly there won't be anything that relates all that much to that class, especially the insane mobility.
---
If I was leaving an AV game because it got caught in a turtle feud I would jump in the mash of horde and bubble hearth and use my /fart macro
---
It‚Äôs the bubblhearth Dutch oven
---
They‚Äôre all great and I‚Äôve played each one. I‚Äôd say I prefer priest because fear is so strong and you can heal forever. 
---
A skilled Druid would be great to have since alliance can only dispel hots with priest. 
---
Shaman is nice to cleanse viper sting and you‚Äôve got so much armor. Of course wind fury too. 
---
I‚Äôve had the most fun pvp healing as shaman though. 
---
Holy paladins get a proc on spell crit that doesn‚Äôt use any mana and you piss off a giant heal. Spell crit is the best mp5 in raids for holy paladins. With that being said they are the most mana efficient healers in vanilla. Best pvp healers by far.
---
Dear jesus
---
Yeah illumination just seems so satisfying. I played a holy Pally in BC a bit and later Wrath a lot, so I‚Äôll miss divine illumination.
---
Throw in a Resto Druid and you're good to go
---
I met one of my best online gamer friends on a private server. 
---
We have been friends for at least 7 years now and we met on a Wotlk private server where he was giving away shirts for fun.
---
Since then we have played all kinds of things together. Not everyone on private servers are toxic and therefore real connections can be made and the servers shouldn't all be considered garbage. 
---
While I get where you are coming from and what you are trying to say, broad grouping and wording are important.
---
(I know I'm replying to a reply but I'm basically just agreeing with the guy above me.)
---
Maybe a test realm where they copy your character over
---
Pretty sure it was. Sounds super limited still compared to mage utilities.  
---
Yeah! Hoarding is a huge issue for me, eventually I have no space anywhere for anything, even with a guild bank all to myself...
---
My Dad got my Mom into WoW and then she tried me getting into it when I was like...9? Idk, but I remember having fun running past all the high level mobs when I was still low level lol. I'm 19 now and I'm looking forward to giving vanilla a whirl. I've been craving for a good MMO and retail WoW doesn't tickle it for me.
---
Yeah probably better
---
The absolute best trip would be:
---
Warrior / Mage / Healer
---
Have the warrior spec dps. The healer can keep him alive just fine. Mage can Aoe stuff down and help out with food / water / ports. I would kill to run that trio
---
Does the boat from darkshore really have a path to theramore? If so I never knew that in retail or any of my time playing on private servers
---
Awesome map though saving this 
---
This went similarly to your experience but did not end well with my wife. 
---
Same camera issues.  Didn't enjoy the quests.  Was frustrated that playing with arrow keys wasn't better. Too many abilities. Too many talents.... It went on for a while.   I then explained to her why she is the reason the game I used to love is the way it is now lol. 
---
This has nothing to do with classic wow. Try /r/vanillawowservers or /r/legacyaddons
---
Chicken attack

---
Imo, it depends on your intentions for endgame more than the leveling process. Do you plan on raiding together or just doing dungeons/PvP? The Paladin and the priest will more than likely be asked to heal for raid content so they'll both need to gear as holy at 60 which could make grouping together ineffective. 
---
My friends and I are looking at:
---
War/RSham/Mage
---
We figure that combo synergizes pretty well, covers the trinity for 5man content, and keeps loot competition to a minimum. 
---
No real reason to push R14 if they release it with bwl. 10x easier to get ashkandj/crul than r14. 
---
Okay thanks.
---
Yeah... I have been using voice to text because I have a broken finger right now and it doesn't always work out. I really need to start proofreading lol
---
I think the highest I got in TBC was 1750ish. So no. I just don‚Äôt see how keybinds could make your play worse.
---
Leather 'of the Monkey' drops must have been a riot. 
---
Anything else except Scholo and DM West you‚Äôll see ‚ÄúLFM DPS no rogue‚Äù
---
You want your cone of cold to have a stronger slow so its slow takes precedence.  
---
The most people will never see naxx. i think its too early to cry over naxx gear üòÇ
---
Yea, I have a classic unsealed as well. Nice collection though!
---
You should warrior tank and let your new friend play a range DPS.
---
Didn‚Äôt read the post but farming is something that is necessary in every community but no one likes to do. They nearly work 16 hour days from 5 am to 9 pm occasionally. Working conditions are generally sub par and maintaining all the equipment, animals, and property takes a LOT of effort else things will get out of hand. I wouldn‚Äôt say anyone actually enjoys farming but if they didn‚Äôt exist life would be much more difficult. 
---
A fury warrior in full naxx gear feels a bit like what a dh feels like at level 20.
---
Mage can get the team to Ironforge after level 40.
---
But a lock at 20+ can have the team in Badlands, summon the warrior, have the warrior hearth to IF, buy 3 bottles of Frost Oil, accept the summon, and complete [Coolant Heads Prevail](http://classicdb.ch/?quest=713) within a minute.
---
Level 20 DH? 
---
Depends if they make changes or not, classic launch will be a shit show. 
---
I'll pass on changing the stats, regardless of whether I make it into Naxx or not.
---
[removed]
---
They might bring us Tauren DH. So hold out!
---
/s
---
Even on private servers where only dedicate vanilla players play on, those people being toxic are the minority but the vocal majority. 
---
This will not even be 1% as bad In classic.
---
Lol true. In my defense wth retail talents/zone scaling there's almost no difference between lvl 15 and 115 except how many zeroes there are after the numbers. Your character level is just there to remind you how long you've been playing for, and how long before the real game starts.
---
The rank 14 bow is too fast and shitty.
---
You seriousy overcomplicate things..  
---
Every class has their theorycrafting issues for PvE, but for warriors it was pretty easy  
---
Hit&gt;Everything else until you got hit-cap.  
---
Go arms(2H) until your gear is good, then you can go fury(DW)  
---
Overpower was your 1 dynamic skiill that wasnt just simple rotation and would consume the ragebar to stance dance. Even then, your entire screen would scream OVERPOWER NOW, so wasnt exactly hard.  
---
Warlocks in PvP? constantly moving, controlling your pet, dot rotations and fear rotations.  
---
Warrior in PvP: Charge, hamstring, keep MS up, hope for crits. (if you have healers, peel for them).
---
  
---
I believe there will be not enough warlocks in classic. As far as I can see, people often reroll while leveling warlocks. Also, people who played vanilla, and do not investigate before classic, would rarely roll warlocks.
---
Their terrible business decisions that destroyed the game are no excuse for ruining classic. 
---
Screwing up classic, which a couple of Russians have managed to get right, will make sure a large amount of customers never play a blizzard Activision game again. 
---
Better off with AMD over Intel.. imo
---
I don't know enough about Paladins to really add anything to the theorycrafting here, but I ***do*** know that extremely dedicated people have been theorycrafting the hell out of this game for almost half as long as I've been alive.  I'd imagine if something like this were good (or even just passable) it would be pretty well known.
---
Vanilla -&gt; end of Wrath = golden era of WoW
---
Great post and all points true. The way I like to phrase it is this. Anyone hardcore is using a spreadsheet to track their gear and plan out potential upgrades. A lot of times getting a whole new epic drop from a raid will do something small like give you 10 more AP or 1 more hit... or something that raises your damage by .5% or maybe 1%. The human racial alone is 3% wo its like having a whole extra upgrade item, not as a replacement, but as an entire 13th slot instead of the normal 12. Its like having a whole extra piece of gear and it opens up options to stat crit and AP elsewhere with weapon skill and hit already in play without even taking a gear slot.
---
You don‚Äôt alleviate concerns
---
Some classes have specs that are different/more fun but simply weaker in straight pve or pvp encounters
---
There‚Äôs no getting around it. It is what it is. It‚Äôs what makes Classic awesome
---
Storm strike, plus nature spell doing 200% increased damage on crit  = big dick damage.
---
WHITE PRIDE!
---
# OR 
---
The consumables you would use to make up for it can also be used by the humans haha
---
So the real answer is how much do you care about min maxing, because the humans will always be a few % better by definition and have more gear options to shift around too
---
no you didn't cause i was rank1
---
Dude I remember you and that's weird. You were definitely one of "those guys" that you could recognize just from your appearance alone. A buddy of mine may have raised with you, "Nevaya"?
---
Yep, lvl 10 paladin. I was kiting him on my 7 hunter with my 2.4 dps white bow to annoy him. Eventually there ended up being 4 of us around lvl 8 and we managed to take him down with a couple casualties. 
---
Dude how did you get that inverted d though? 
---
DJ Khalid - ‚Äúanother one‚Äù

End game is going to be so much more competitive and I can't wait
---
Being a hordie, I disapprove. Hearing those sound effects, I approve. I‚Äôm conflicted.
---
Probably rolling ally since in the past I've always been Horde. Got some splorin to do.
---
We da best OC
---
Yeah, same for me
---
&gt;Yeah, no. No shaman is going to waste points or try and cast ghost wolf in combat range to disengage. He's better off kiting/damaging and healing through an offense. 
---
Have you ever solo grinded the first room of BRD as a paladin before? Doesn't seem possible to me.
---
Wishing for money isn't going to make it happen. Go get it.
---
Are all poor people as resentful as you?
---
Every day this conversation.
---
Why does every person want classic catered to *their* tastes
---
Some specs were just better than others at some things. The imbalance and difference is what‚Äôs awesome about classic 
---
I‚Äôm sick of hearing shit like ‚ÄúI want to ret pally or enh shammy AND top dps meters!‚Äù 
---
Just, no. Accept that your class had tradeoffs and you had one main strongest spec for pve stuff for example.
---
Something similar happened with my friend and I. He was dps warrior and would charge in whirlwind, the healer would heal him and they would aggro the healer. I would run in frost nova the mobs and blink out. This is how we did it all the way until sunken temple. Bless our healer friend. Foreverbroke, if you are out there, I am sorry we put you through that.
---
Female Orc Priest.
---
Lol unsealed collector's editions are not selling for $300. I see those boxes at Goodwill all the fucking time. Delusional ass people.
---
If I was being honest, I think it would be cool to patch on a new raid, but there‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs happening. 
---
It‚Äôs human nature to want things to last forever, but that‚Äôs what retail is. It was Blizz stretching out Vanilla over 15 years. And now everyone on this forum desperately wants to go back to the beginning. It‚Äôs hard to accept, but we should all just want Vanilla and only Vanilla. Nothing after Naxx, but perhaps some new servers for those that want to do it all again.
---
My parents introduced me to WoW when I was a kid. I've gotten my mom on board for playing classic when it comes out. Just like the good ol' days!
---
Still confused when people say VC. We always said DM in Europe.
---
And before you say "it's so people won't confuse it with Dire Maul"; we would just shift click whoever was LFG/M and you'd know straight away which one he was talking about.
---
Looks sick! You should add the Deeprun Tram too :)
---
BWL xbow is also much better.
---
Pickpocketing was actually meant to be a skill just like lock picking in early beta. Before they removed most of the skills and replaced them with talents. 
---
Your AQ40 guild let you clog up the debuff slots with serpent sting? How did you guys even manage to kill anything in there
---
Lol
---
Boooooo
---
Loot is rarely really a problem. At least half your gear comes from quests rewards. For the other half just having a few less upgrades really isn't going to make much difference. Most pieces of gear are literally less than 0.5% dps upgrade. It's not enough to make a significant difference in levelling speed at all.
---
As a herb/miner I spent vast amounts of time in vanilla riding around farming - felwood had so much goodness and I still know where all the whipper root tuber locations are. I loved gathering, and it also led to some very fun pvp opportunities.
---
This time around I am thinking of actually producing something, maybe alchemy, but I really don't know if the lure of double gathering professions can be ignored. 
---
For some time out from running dungeons or questing, or pounding out the twilight cultists in Silithus, there was nothing better than sitting in vent, mucking around while doing circuits. I didn't even use gatherer as my internet was shocking and addons made it worse, but it didn't matter because I knew all the nodes anyway.
---
Gathering in WoW is honestly a great way to relax after a day at work, much more enjoyable than sitting in front of the TV and vegetating for hours.
---
How would you get said gear?
---
Rets were plate and use 2handers.
---
Even late game plate doesn‚Äôt have agi &gt; int &gt; str; you would have to settle to mail which greatly weakens the only strength paladins really have in pvp, survivability.
---
for a weapon you would have to use what, a hunter polearm? Those are usually pretty fast and would gimp your SoC.
---
In a bubble, maybe the stat prioritization would work, but you can‚Äôt pvp in a bubble.
---
And if you‚Äôre doing it for the pve dps, you‚Äôd still be a 2nd hand warrior that passively does damage when his seal doesn‚Äôt proc.
---
holy nova seems like a waste of talent points for what is basically a stealth check
---
Can pallys use polearms?
---
How do you live with yourself knowing you stuck with the game past WOTLK?
---
I definitely hit 10 in two-three hours or less a couple of times on blood elf characters in BC. I don‚Äôt remember specifically how long, but I know I was challenging myself to get 10 in an hour. 
---
Yeah, I did have a distinct look because of my gear/guilds but I leveled almost entirely by solo grinding since I started the game about a week after my IRL friends.
---
Yes.
---
The majority look down on those who continue to play private servers instead of being patient like everyone else. This is very similar to the biggest streamers like StaySafe, Esfand, etc who have quit private servers with the same mentality.
---
I wasn't following WoW Classic last year. I like how Ythisens slapped them down. Now I see why this community treasured him so dearly.
---
Wasting a ton of money on a niche game sounds like the terrible business decision to me. Much more financially viable to just take the modern client and repurpose it.

" More than anything else in the game, I spent time farming Adamantite in Nagrand and Saronite in Sholazar Basin ", I literally used to do this, do laps of Scholozar watching the Office or Arrested Development, farming stack after stack.
---
Super chill, it's good fun to me :)
---
&lt;xoomer&gt;
---
Also, it would mainly be a Pve test, I think Ret atm in plate is fine but I'd like to try this for raids and see how it holds up. Constant Vengeance and Spell useage would be interesting to test
---
No such thing as the best healer unless you are a paladin on the ally side. = )
---
Personally I'd prefer a druid from a pure healing stand point. Druids can disengage from combat and keep those hots rolling both on yourself and your partner. There survival rate is very high and mana bars are plentiful. 
---
Offensively there's no question it's shaman. Purge, Earthbind, Frostshock/Earth shock, Poison cleansing, Windfury and grounding totem. Most shamans will be ele/restro anyway so they can contribute to the overall damage. Biggest weakness is a lack escapes and non casting heal spells. Basically NS+Heal or you are casting heal spells/kiting. A good player can shut them down with a timed interrupted. A walking meat shield.
---
Priests are kinda meh to me. There only escape is fear. Squishy compared to druids or shamans. Lots of heal utility from flash/greater/pws/renew. If you spec into imp mana burn you can burn the othersides healer mana bar pretty quickly.  At least you don't have to deal with purge on the horde side because it actually sucks more to be a druid/priest healer on the ally side. 
---
I AM THE SENATE

Raising the player cap is a change. slippery slope argument etc
---
Pretty happy! I loved every xpacs. Some were better then others but still enjoyed my way through Azeroth!
---
Hundreds of days played on Vanilia and various P server and to this day I've never gotten the scholo/UBRS key.  I swear I'll get those keys this time. 
---
By the time Naxx came around the expansion wasn't too far away and only a hand full of guilds could clear it.
---
No, it isn't. That moronic corporate thinking is what drove all their subscribers away to begin with. 
---
You have 0 idea what their profit margins are so saying " financially viable" is meaningless. 
---
Nothing
---
Classic is practically a different genre in how it plays. There is no spammy ARPG class, its a different game. 
---
Yes but we might be dealing with permanent vanilla
---
Looks great! A bit like my build, except i take sleight of hand, hemo, and hightened senses and skip cruelty/initiative :)
---
It's a question about resources. Nodes, NPC respawn, drop rates, even world bosses. It was always a point of contention on private servers and how to fiddle with those values without causing more problems than you were solving. Classic will have the advantage of multiple servers that can be merged to keep populations healthy while private servers didn't have that luxury. I believe keeping the cap is the less risky option. 
---
The biggest issue with the old cap was with some servers becoming ghost towns the moment the population began to stabilize from the initial release.
---
Then you had servers who didn't have enough pvp players to support a big enough battle ground population and that's why battleground battle groups/realms were made.
---
Has Blizzard officially stated this?
---
Large cap results in a case where players care less about the community, because there are so many players that the community matters less. You appreciate people less if there are more of them.
---
Game is at its very best, when you regularly see the same people on your side and against you in BGs, when you meet people in WC, then later in the Sunken Temple.
---
The areas, the amount of mobs and the spawn rate is not made for 7k players, that is very obvious when you play on a private server.
---
I farmed Strath UD for the deathcharger solo in BC as human warrior. It took at least 200 runs, I don‚Äôt even know, it was years and years ago, when it was live. This was the .01% drop rate, before it was buffed to 1% in wrath+. 
---
But farming that instance over and over, it became like meditation, like true zen. I became one with the instance. I knew every monster, each pull, every trick and shortcut. Each time I entered, I was in my space, solitary and calm. Of course, eventually I just did it on principle, and flipped my shit when the charger dropped. Everyone in my guild knew I was obsessed with strath.
---
Man, I can‚Äôt wait to run it in classic and lose it to a party member. Because I‚Äôll just run it again... and again. 
---
if you can go troll, go troll.
---
seriously. I've played troll shadow priest when they weren't exactly held in high regard (retail TBC) and the amount of fuckery it allowed... I'm still pissed I no longer have the collection of salty messages I got after some 2v2 matches. also, don't forget hex of weakness, 20% healing debuff might not sound much, but it's basically free (rank 1), ranged, spammable and most druids/mages won't bother removing it.
---
however, as far as I know, classic raiding ain't so hot on shadow priests, but dwarf holy priests are really in, so take that into account. they might not be able to troll people so hard, but fear ward and stoneform is a very nice toolkit indeed, just don't try to use desperate prayer in shadowform.
---
 2019 Reddit shittalker and a person who would have been getting 2 shot by me in 2006. 
---
DnT was definitely the top guild in the world when they played, no way Nihilum was better at that time. While DnT was active they had 13 world first kills to Nihilum's 8 and the only reason Nhl killed Ouro 1st was because Ouro went from wall to nerfed and Nhl's EU servers opened hours before ours allowing them to secure an easy kill while we were still clearing to it. (Blizzard's massive fuck-up here was part of the reason why I quit the game). And in Naxx DnT killed the lion's share of bosses including the hardest, 4 Horseman, only to have KT bug out and despawn over and over until the raid reset(there were even GM's present who tried unsuccessfully to fix it). So Nhl and other guilds had a multi day grace period so large that DnT didn't even take world 2nd KT.
---
Laptop life! 
---
Back when clasdic was still good.
---
I was just a kid when Classic WoW came out and joined pretty late so I look forward to actually going back to the days of Classic WoW in New Classic WoW to relive the Classic days that emulated Vanilla when my Grandfather was still alive. :(
---
Make different servers different caps and make everyone happy, but under no circumstances allow transfers or cross realm anything. 
---
Make your decision and live with it.
---
No, I don't think so because you didn't play cross server then. Plus I  see no need to compare myself to any player who got gear through  illegitimate means. (And really how much more epic would my experience  have been with a DFT?) 
---
Rogue or Fury Warrior are your only dual wield fast attacking options.
---
As the old saying goes.. don't try and fulfill multiple roles. 
---
Shadow priests are always mana spent. Your whole goal is to melt your targets face off so you can sit down and drink more water lmao.  A hybrid spec for healing/shadow damage is just that. A half baked spec where you'll do decent/good heals and half ass damage. I am not saying it can't work but it isn't great IMO. 
---
Absolutely! We should make an option to report a post and after a few reports, that person is muted.
---
Seriously though, you can just not open the post. I for one just skip them. I feel like the classic community can also be a bit less "religious" concerning the game. It is like some people get heart spasms every time someone proposes changes to the game, even though they are just ideas and most likely not put forward by Blizzard developers. At the end of the day it is not crazy to start thinking what will happen to classic after Naxx, because I can guarantee you that Blizzard is already thinking about it, if not already working on it.
---
I played with the numpad  and the rows above the movement arrows for abilities and wasd for movement lol. That was back then. I‚Äôd use q and e and mouse for movement now and bind everything else near q and e with 7 buttons on my mouse. It‚Äôs quicker to reach abilities.
---
The hero we need 
---
Lol we were like the third best alliance guild on our server and we did shit like that.  Vanilla was just a weird time
---
Depends if you plan on doing dungeons while leveling. if so, a healer/tank and dps would be the best.
---
If it's 99% grinding/questing? Straight up dps classes. 
---
A Hunter/Warlock/Druid combo would be balls to the wall. The thing is all three classes can level very fast solo by themselves and most don't even waste their time grouping up. 
---
They are straight up torturing us with that game
---
I mean neither do you. So if what I'm saying is moronic, then what you're saying is moronic as well. We're both just speculating. 
---
You should drop 4% crit and get hemo and dirty deeds
---
Lmfao. Lost my shit in public. Thanks for that.
---
Whats the RP like in classic? I want to roll a semi serious Undead Warrior rp, but I am aware that Forsaken don't make for great warriors and some HC players might not tolerate that, and that the tight knit hardcore players like to be on like first name basis with each other. Is it worth attempting an 'interesting' character or should I just roll something strong  like an orc warrior. 
---
 
---
* Enveloping Winds - 10s stun on the person who has aggro. Ossirian will not target a player under this effect(though all threat is preserved). This effect cannot be dispelled, but can be resisted(nature) and it breaks on damage.
---
Druids get so much hate here and I really don't know why, they make very solid PvP healers, they are hard to lock down, have great survivability, and have the best HoT's and instant cast heals.  
---
That being said, if you're grouping with a warrior I'd say Shaman just for WF totem. Even though they're in mail and can wear a shield they are the squishiest though.
---
Priests with the weakest armour tend to actually be the toughest once you have some gear.
---
Phew. Must be worth it regardless of the MT getting drained every second.
---
&gt;Ossirian is immune to taunt, so it's kinda hard for tanks to maintain high aggro.
---
What part of zone out is ambiguous!
---
It sounds rough. So assuming a Druid would MT it, having those Crowd Pummeler's would help establish threat. 
---

I strongly dislike the massive private server caps, but it's partially a personal preference thing. Seeing players everywhere vs only sometimes just brings different feeling to the game. In my opinion, small population makes the world feel bigger, and more real because you see the same names over and over. Named quest mobs aren't camped 24/7 because players are bottlenecked there. Leveling zones that are supposed to be dangerous aren't because people just form random 5-mans.
---
Non opinion based arguments is that the game world wasn't designed for that player cap (so there aren't enough mobs/resources), and that it's not authentic. 
---
In terms of pure numbers druids might pull above shammies, but then you realize that they're split between each faction and that they're the least rolled class in each faction.
---
Beautiful.

&gt;In my defense, I was Fraps'ing on a friends PC with a setup much different than mine (keyboard in his computer desk drawer etc.). Realistically though, this was 13 years ago and we all sucked compared to today's players who have addons and 13 years of experience + Twitch/uTube.   
---
&gt;My only regret was quitting the game before arenas so I'll never really know how good I was(to be clear I do not think I would have been the Jonathan Fatal1ty Wendel of WoW) but the people I played with went on to win Brutal/Deadly titles and even the first Blizz tournament. (But what is WoW compared to SC/Dota/Quake anyway?) Still, I'm happy just having made the server forum "best PvPer lists" and having been hated by other PvPers for forcibly jumping the line to r14 (the server had long BG queues so there were no groups, it was every man for himself).  
---
&gt;When it came to PvE I'm insanely happy with my accomplishments. Killing Nefarian first in the world was an experience of unbelievable elation. Our guild‚Äîand many other guilds‚Äîbashed our heads into the wall that was stage wall one for months with no idea if or how it was even possible.   
---
&gt;As for my individual raid performance, it was hard to prove in 40 mans but I was actively recruited by the best guild, DnT, to come in and raise the bar for their hunters since they all hated the class, fucked off and tried to play alts etc.(like 99% of hunters did at the time).  
---
&gt;As a cocky teenager I relished in the task. My first farm run with DnT I purposely held Feign Death and pulled aggro on bosses like Shazzrah and Broodlord, training them around a bit for fun. The priests then put me in my place with their cursed healing on Nef, hahaha. In AQ I got to offtank the trash around Twin Emps as a hunter since I had 6k HP in my PvP gear; I loved every minute of it (especially since everyone else hated the trash at the end of AQ, haha). And finally, Ouro was the crown jewel for hunter dps. Here is the damage meter from DnT's world second(or third) Ouro kill:

---
Wouldnt it make more sense to stack strength instead of agility due to Divine Strength?
---
I really want TBC talents but in wow classic. But it would break the game. It just wouldn‚Äôt be classic anymore. I just love how there was more variety in TBC. 
---
He's talking out of his ass.
---
affirmative 
---
Only played my mage in classic to end game 60 but once I got the MC spell power trinket. My AP, PoM, pyro mage was super easy to just blow people up with 1 button macro every 3 mins.
---
One can only dream. 
---
5k server cap is just about perfect. Anything in the 7k+ range is just way to insane for farming and questing. 2.5k might be a bit underwhelming but I'd be more willing to do that than the larger option
---
What was the movie
---
People do R14 for gear and not the prestige?
---
VC stands for VanCleef 
---
Ah.. what a shame
---
You're talking about the badge right?
---
They aren't great but there is no reason to exaggerate. Being naked vs wearing an item with intellect and stamina aren't the same. 
---
Nah, sadly i had a desktop
---
The cheapest 2's comp you can possibly play aside from druid/mace warrior. I played both comps! hahahah.
---
It's a bit of an exaggeration, but at the same time it's not. Many boss fights in 5 mans you won't take any damage and your job is to cast bolts for 40 seconds. All you're getting from a complete set off dungeon blues in that situation is what... 3-4% chance to crit? So if you do 200 dps naked the blue set would give you about 8 extra dps. Definitely good value for your 50 hours of farming dungeons there.
---
It is. And I will enjoy it knowingly my time investment won‚Äôt vanish with the next expansion.
---
Man I am WAY relaxed on my p server rn then
---
15 here. Started in the beginning of Cata and quit in Legion. A few months ago I made a mage on a *cough* server and leveled it to 60, and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had with WoW. Can't wait for classic to release, as I'm gonna try to get rich by playing the AH 
---
I'm not insulting you here:
---
I'm legitimately curious about what made you think that because there's nothing like that at all.  If I think back to what Ragnarok Online private servers were like, I could see a WoW Classic private server doing that because of how much of a pain it is to get the key if all you want is access to the dungeon.
---
I‚Äôve played a DH the last two expansions. 
---
Nothing in Classic plays like a DH.
---
Demon hunters start at 98.
---
It's like that for me too, yet others are talking like there's no problem.  That makes me think this hosting site has some kind of bandwidth restriction for some reason.
---
&gt;  It got removed because the vocal majority didn't like it.
---
What's your source for this claim? In Blizzcon they said they weren't able to put it into the new engine yet.
---
i started in warlords, quit in legion and now im almost 60 on a classic warrior. 
---
When you accidentally waste 30 seconds and then MC is on farm status. Rip.
---
I think an increased player cap should only happen if they also add dynamic spawns nearly everywhere, and I get the feeling few besides me actually want dynamic spawns.
---
More than one OG Vanilla Blizzard dev during a Classicast stated that the population caps were never technology limitations but conscious design decisions.
---
Anything too much over 2,500 and you will no longer recognize people as easily, the population will be too large for the type of 'community' they wanted to design.
---
Starting from this pop cap in mind, they designed everything from zone and city sizes to mob and node spawn rates.
---
Pservers which have 10k populations are not blizzlike and are a different game. They have to increase black lotus spawn rates, sometimes dynamic spawns, etc. That is not Vanilla.
---
The pserver I play on has ~2k concurrent players and it's so great. There is stil wpvp and life everywhere, but it's not a clusterfuck of an experience.
---
Hopefully Blizzard is able to manage to populations and faction balance intelligently.
---
This. Soooo glad to see someone here saying this.
---
Your keybinds are aids btw
---
most people back then didn't keybind tbh. click to cast - not like he would really need any key binds anyways, I mean all you do is spam frostbolt. 
---
Really only need key binds as a frost mage for PVP situations.
---
Was reading this and was thinking about all creative and gimmicky ways to troll/PvP. A shadow melded priest mind controlling people off cliffs comes to mind. I also like just flat out spawn camping the flightmaster in menethil for obvious reasons. Do you guys know any others?
---
Somehow I doubt we'll see it. It'll just be a recolored skybox.
---
Retail doesn't have day/night or weather?
---
Interstellar
---
Warriors have regen health regen, out of combat (except trolls) based on spirit*0.8. 
---
So it's can be handy on long run. 
---
Nobody is going to use Crowd Pummelers in ZG/AQ20 outside of going for a world record, and even then they'd just get DW fury tanks. You just have your DPS hold back for 1-2 vulnerability phases and then they can just go hard. You probs don't even have to wait if you're alliance and use that trinket to cheese it.
---
Noted
---
I starting playing when I was like 11 and hated reading the quests so I literally just killed shit up to level 40ish over the course of like half a year. And I got kicked out of some dungeons for only using melee as a hunter because I was survival and thought it was melee only.
---
FWIW it should also be noted that this trinket and cheese strat is alliance only. Horde side sucks and you need to get an offtank if you're really lazy or get your shammies to grounding totem the Cyclone.
---
Weather didn‚Äôt come out until the later patches of vanilla 
---
1) Go Horde or go home ;)
---
2) Ok.. well, one is Paladin. The new player probably best off with Mage or Hunter. If he wants melee then Rogue, but range DPS would be better. For you the tank role would be left, so its Warrior. :)
---
None of these are original why is this in classic wow sub
---
&gt;trying to promote sharding
---
bugger off m8
---
It's pretty simple to me. If ActiBlizz delivers us an MMORPG with the MMO, then I won't play it. Simple as that. Even better, I'll know I can always hop on pservers if I get the itch to play vanilla without having to pay a dime to ActiBlizz *if* they ruin Classic.
---
In the meantime, let's hope they don't use the shitty servers they are running retail on for Classic that can't even have a proper 40v40 teamfight in AV. It wasn't nearly that bad in WoD and Legion.
---
How about no.
---
There's a stealthed rogue just around the corner as you go into the Horde camp...
---
&gt;In my opinion, small population makes the world feel bigger, and more real because you see the same names over and over. 
---
You still see the same people over and over on 10k cap servers. You will still know who the good players are, who's the top bg group, etc. 
---
#Laughs in Divine Intervention
---
I worded it pretty shit but I meant ‚ÄòI hope my fears won‚Äôt be realised‚Äô as in I want Classic to be good. By that I mean a faithful recreation of the base game, no sharding no nothing. If that happens and the game is truly VANILLA then I‚Äôll be playing for years!
---
My nongamer gf had a hell of a time figuring it out. Vanilla wow pvp server you DIE a lot. Not easy at all. 
---
It's one of the more challenging mmos you can play now.
---
Oh wow that is some cheese right here. Never knew you could do that. 
---
Then who the would play anything other than a hybrid? When you have hybrids who can heal and DPS on par with rogues/wars/locks/etc, then why would you sacrifice insane utility for anything other than a hybrid? 
---
This is why we currently have the abomination we have in retail. People think their class/playstyle should be top tier in all aspects. Heal based classes should primarily be heal based. DPS based classes should be DPS. Utility classes should be utility (druid).
---
It's funny you think I'm trying to shill for sharding. I for one wont play the game is sharding is in anyway enabled in Classic. I'm just pointing out what is most likely going to happen given recent history and cost cutting news.
---
Completely agree. If I see a player get sharded out when entering a new zone or joining a party, I will go elsewhere to find my emersion.
---
I feel ya, it's not my favourite thing but after spending many a night on the raid bench farming herbs I have developed an appreciation for it.  
---
You should consider playing a Druid. You can gather minerals and herbs without going out of travel form and they are great at grinding mobs without downtime :)
---
Your post almost seems like some sort of apology for sharding, and ultimately an acceptance of it.  
---
You know as well as anyone else that if the scenario you paint stays on the canvas, then there will be a mass exodus and private servers will become a permanent installation. We'll never again trust Blizzard if they make that mistake.  
---
It took me until level ~45 to realize pets could gain the taunt skill through growl. 
---
Spellsteal in vanilla? You know it was added in tbc right? I always beat frost mages.
---
They couldn't find a way to sell it so no
---
Well played.
---
Thanks
---
From a private server perspective, a good argument there is the difficulty of maintaining multiple servers. So you want everbody playing on the same server, which requires you to increase the cap if enough players are interested.
---
But this is not a problem for Blizzard as they can easily spin up more servers as needed.
---
I know it was 13 years ago, but I remember it looking slightly different than that.
---
Paladins would be really interesting. You'd be able to have Holy Shock + Sanctity Aura for a proper Shockadin build, Holy Shock + BoSanc for a healer/tank hybrid that actually had a ranged pull, Ret could take Divine Favor for raid healing and still get Repentance for pvp, 31 Holy could get Kings + SoComm together.
---
None of those would make Paladin the "strongest" class but it would make having One-spec-for-all incredibly convenient.
---
About a 4. Prep is nice but you won't ahve the burst of daggers, the entire point of HARP in TBC (adrenaline rush + prep), or the smooth CC chains of Hemo. You won't have the sustain of Relentless Strikes. It's not as good a concept as you might think.
---
That trinket was borderline game breaking. For this video I literally banked my usual T2 + PvP combo because I wanted to record a sick double multishot with the T1 8 piece bonus dmg. Sadly I didn't have much time to film and only recorded one combo which wasn't even that good. I even had to slow the clip down just to make the hits visible.
---
My friend and I 
---
Where is this actually? Looks like Bryce

Getting rogues out of stealth is huge for both solo pvp and group pvp. without holy nova you have no way of doing that. Even if you see a rogue stealth right in front of you in a tight space area. You're basically just giving him a free opener. Running through the wsg tunnel spamming rank 1 holy nova for example is very nice. Also, Divine fury together with the ZG trinket is huge, you can do heals for 2k+ with only 1.5 second cast time
---
Staysafe, Esfand and TipsOut stopped producing private server content because they want to turn Classic WoW into a career, and there's no way to do that if you're persona non grata at Activision Blizzard HQ.
---
It's a little bit disappointing to hear that you think that Tipsout, Staysafe and Esfand look down on private servers because I don't think that's true. They got their start playing on private servers.
---
For retail classic I‚Äôm going to try and convince them to go PvP realm. Right now the private server is PvP and we have yet to be ganked. I‚Äôm thinking they‚Äôll believe this is a normal leveling experience (only 2k people on the server). Raids/dungeons will still be our go to options. PvP just spices up the life experience. 
---
Yeah I think it's the Navajo trail loop, and based on the lighting I'd say this picture was taken in the summer months.
---
I might be incorrect but this is how I think it will be:
---
Hunters - a lot of 45+ lvl but a lot of them are dumped (even on 60) because people will notice that autoshot req too much attention, while you don't do a lot of dps, too big deadzone and suck at kiting
---
Warriors - a lot of 15-35 range are dumped because they are too hard for leveling. Some will quit on 60 when they notice you can't pull 5 elites in a dungeon with blue/green gear or when no one is taking u as fury because of the lack of gear.
---
Druids/paladins/shamans - a lot of ferals, tanks/retry, enh are walking around, trying to find groups until they notice those are dead specs outside solo leveling.
---
Priests - the same state as the previous - trying to be shadow. Some of them not buying wands etc.
---
Rogues/mages - I expect a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge amount of undeads that will want to do some stuff from old videos but getting one-shooted by other classes. While most of the rogues will not pass 50, the mages should be fine.
---
Locks - a lot of people going to bash them because they don't have shards, doesn't SS people etc. but nothing major.
---
I was feeling the same way with the pally. I have no qualms considering I Maine‚Äôs a blood elf pally to 60 in WotLK. But for a trio it become slightly tougher since they‚Äôre so hybrid and not very focused on a main role. 
---
Thanks for the mage advice. Would it be worth swapping my priest for that?
---
Not to be rude but you haven't watched them enough. Yes the front is that they want to preserve a healthy relationship with Blizzard AND they don't want to get banned from Twitch and YouTube. Besides that though, they've either all directly or indirectly stated that essentially private servers are 'behind them' so to speak. It doesn't really mean they look down on people for playing on them. Moreso that they are paying Classic WoW and Blizzard respect by not continuing to play and endorse private servers. There's also the minor tidbit about how playing on private servers is just spoiling the real thing for you. Many many people going HAM right now on private servers are going to be burned out when Classic WoW comes out. Anyone who anticipates this will realize its not in their best interest, for the same reason that watching a camcorder recording of a movie that just came out today is not in your best interest to watch, if you were planning on visiting the theaters to see it soon.
---
This comes from a person that hardcore raided from 2013-2016 on two servers. I loved playing on them, but Classic WoW's announcement changed everything. 
---
If some of the people played on Feenix around 2010 they probably can confirm that 3k players were perfect - a lot of people in each zone, but still possible to farm stuff and active wPVP. I think after this point there are too many people in each zone and it starts to be too crowded. 
---
Considering we‚Äôre only levels 6 it‚Äôs possible to reroll this 3 man. And it will prevent fighting over loot. I‚Äôll talk to the guys today about it. Thanks!
---
My bad, I didn't know that. Still strongly believe that pallies are only good against rogues and warriors. 
---
Rogues can do it too, with mindcap from engineering. 
---
Paladins with gnomish death ray, or reconingninjapaladins (buying invisible potion, getting stacks on reckoning and just one shot someone).
---
Hunters with meld+prowl pet, ganking.
---
Any range that carry the net trinket from engineering killing melee classes.
---
Reflection trinkets from engineering, oneshooting mages with their own pyroblasts.
---
Naxx gear being op is pretty much just a meme, considering the gap between entry level gear and the last tier has been ever expanding every expansion, to the point that in legion/bfa you can go back to the early raids and solo/duo them after getting bis gear. At most you will see 500-1000 more hp and 10-20% more damage output from a naxx geared person compared to a mc/bwl one.
---
In addition, even with naxx out there's a ton of absolute bis items from both mc, bwl and aq, so you could make the case the loot from there is actually more op.
---
Don't play a class you don't want to play just to make a group happy. I can't stress this enough.
---
Oh boy time for a new Tips Out video
---
Or just buy that on your bank alt. 
---
Damn that's impressive
---
Those damn wyverns wouldn't drop their damn eggs... 
---
By the time you are starting to get full naxx bis gear weapon skill starts to fade off in value somewhat, you generate so much rage you can almost queue up heroic strike/cleave on every swing and glancing blows only affect your offhand swings.
---
Yupp! Is kinda lazy, no dignity
---
Well at least you had ..
---
Something to be doing
---
If you go on retail theres more younger blood. Us 30+ year olds are waiting, waiting for classic to arrive.
---
I recently unsubbed as bfa is really not my thing, I've completely skipped Legion and pretty played on/off for a few months each time ever since Wrath was released. Classic and afterwards TBC ... those were some good days.
---
Well there's obviously #nochanges. Do you need more arguments than that?
---
&gt;talking about paladin
---
&gt;"cant pvp in a bubble"
---
Lmao someone doesnt know a thing about classic pvp  lol jk :P
---
is there any way to show the debuff time of debuffs on a mob?
---
is there a way to show the cast bar of a mob or enemy player?
---
is there a way to autoloot pick pocket? (for example with macro)
---
is there a /startattack macro in wow classic? (/startattack seem to not work)
---
I love Stonetalon so much, can't wait to get back there.
---
Weapons from r14 are bis on hunter tho 
---
Time for 50 content creators to make their own video, all of them happen to be just over 10 minutes(what a coincidence). 
---
Pally - mail/plate. Heal &amp; tank
---
Hunter - leather/mail (noob friend). Dps + pet
---
Mage / Warlock - cloth. Water &amp; portal or soulstone &amp; health stone (you)
---
I believe in these combos for you
---
Yeah I remember and so will all the new players who take the warrior shield quest in Stormwind at lvl 10/15 and get sent here for 15 whadyamacallits, good luck.
---
&gt;Ele shamy would be nice but not majorly different
---
Idk kev but instant guarenteed crit chain lightning seems pretty good to me.
---
Not really.
---
If you look at the amount of upgrades and the amount these upgrade with, naxx is ridicules. Almost everything gets replaced and with much stronger versions. 
---
I feel like I just got ganked looking at this picture
---
Meaning it's probably +50 degrees, right? O_O
---
On my server people used to run all 3 dire mauls due to the extremely long flight to get there and the low population status of the server.  That's when VC picked up.
---
There was a cave on top of Ironforge that was in Silithus aswell.
---
Same for raids, with a 2000 server population, it means you have to bring 2% of the server with you if you wanna go. 4% of a faction. That's a looot. And only if the server is population capped. 
---
That scares me a bit, though I believe people saying it's the sweet spot, I'm a bit doubful about it.
---
Source on current hardware not being able to support more than 100 players? Considering how far computing power has come since 2004-2006 I would find that hard to believe.
---
And all of those streamers will look like total noobs when Classic launches in comparison to streamers who have actually been playing the game for the past 3+ years.
---
After the horror of Crapacylsm you stopped. 
---
Whenever I go to Estes park, CO it feels like high mountain (minus the shoreline) mountains in both wow and real life are beautiful 
---
Fond memories of Stonetalon. Those were the days!
---
&gt;the price of these kind of things only goes up
---
People thought the same about the Chinese porcelain. After some point, people just overpaid for fancy plates. A lot of people don't release this, but if something is valued in one generation, the next one might not be interested in it at all. 
---
If it's as bad as the current game then the world bosses won't even work. They talked about how there can only be one world boss and it's fought over and not shared. Phasing is more about questing in the starting zone probably. If Classic performed like the modern game then I doubt they would even make it. It would defeat the whole point and phasing can't fix world bosses. 
---
Kitty is rough in vanilla raiding because of debuff slot limits on mobs. It‚Äôs not just Druids this applies to. Rogues and Warlocks generally don‚Äôt get to spec into their DoT based builds either. And Mages only get to do Fire in very specific fights.
---
(Ganks someone forty levels lower.)
---
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt be bullying! Look up the definition of PvP!‚Äù
---
just yesterday i was in death mines and our pala tank left after some blue 2h axe droped for him -.- guess what our hunter suggested :D
---
same here. tanked with my void walker even in sm. we just were noobs and didnt know what a tank is
---
I farmed all the mats needed for leatherwork by myself. Killed hundreds of turtles and scorpids, bears and wolves. So relaxing.
---
I found it more important to ‚Äúwatch yer beck‚Äù
---
Dwarf &gt; Human &gt; Orc for Warrior.  
---
I personally can‚Äôt stand Orc posture but I think they make better looking warriors than any other Horde race. Humans are kinda scrawny but they have cool animations. And obviously was we all know Dwarfs are god‚Äôs chosen Warriors
---
Rain in the night elf starting areas is pure zen
---
You‚Äôd want hemo 100%, and if you‚Äôre using maces, fists or swords in PvP you‚Äôre gonna want to be going CB/prep. The combat tree simply isn‚Äôt good for PvP and the mace stun spec will only make your DR‚Äôs worse so it‚Äôs pretty pointless tbh. You want something like this. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhgboxtZZxMe0cGRo
---
Haha just saw it on popular and thought the same.
---
Vanilla was Hunters and Mages everywhere, while Priests were as precious as gold. I think Classic will actually have less Hunters and a lot more Priests
---
Hold up there playah
---
But a and d strafe by default if you're holding down the right mouse button. 
---
That's gank city Jake, gank city!
---
The ps database is already very accurate for vanilla. The main discrepancies are with server behavior and encounter scripting which classic won‚Äôt help at all with.
---
Well night elf racial is pretty useless for rogues so don‚Äôt go that route. Dwarf and gnomes racials are good for PvP and human racial will maximize dps assuming you go swords. If you really want to min/max or join a more serious raiding guild then human is the way to go. If you don‚Äôt want to play swords though then just pick whatever makes you happy. I‚Äôd suggest dwarf though in that case. Stoneform is pretty handy for PvP and some boss fights. 
---
The pace is what I‚Äôm most looking forward to. Relaxed and no pressure like my naive self was back in the day. And most importantly, there will be people everywhere in all level brackets, not desolation until Blackrock, with a robust and thriving AH
---
correct, that's why I added 'if chosen wisely'  in my comment.  The hard part obviously to choose the right items.  One rule I use is that an item has to have some intrinsic value, apart from just being fashionable.  Taste changes, but if you can do something with it, I think the chances of it keeping value are higher.  A good example  might be retro gaming, prices of 8 bit and 16 bit stuff are going up a lot lately.  I would invest in things like that over a 'useless' plate  any day.  (I assume those plates were for decoration and not for eating)  
---
I'm a shit rogue, but I level and played a mace rogue in Vanilla strictly for PvP and had a fair amount of success. I chose adrenaline rush over prep.  I found that due to the random stun nature of maces, having extra SS spam from AD was more valuable with my less than stealthy plying style.  I rarely stun locked people to death, but I generally have so many stuns during my attacks that my foe could never really get into a grove when fighting due rather regular constant interruptions from stuns.
---
Again, advice from someone who wasn't a very good rogue, but I had a lot more fun with AD than with prep in PvP.
---
Warrior/Rogue-Mage-Priest is probably your best bet 
---
There is a lot of guess work for values in ps db.  Check this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/af8mmx/ama_with_nostalrius_core_team_members_starting_now/
---
We can only guess, because most polls did not account for the following:
---
* EU and USCA have a different taste, for example in EU you have way more Warlocks because the norsk love them
---
* not doing different polls for Alliance / Horde so the numbers for Paladins/Shamans and Druids are off (there are way more Druids on Alliance because nightelfs are pretty and cows are not)
---
* The poll won't account for the tourists that stay and just stick to their first choice
---
It seems to me it could be original content aswell. And sharp picture too, 1064x1600 most propably.
---
Honestly, the run from Astranaar to Stonetalon Peak would have me sweating bullets. 
---
Best leveling combo I did in vanilla: Arms Warrior/Shadow Priest(usually not in shadow form)/Fire Mage.  Ungodly amounts of damage because both the Warrior and the Mage could go nuts with AOE and free water and ports for the group.
---
As far as easy classes go mage and hunters are the best easy classes to start with.  Hunter is harder to master but is harder to kill.  The mage is easier to master but more likely to die to mistakes but that's going to be less of a factor with a healer.
---
Other combo to think about is Ret Pally/Feral Druid/Frost or Fire mage.
---
As a feral druid, you can either heal or tank instances, you'll do reasonable dps with the ability to pop out of forms to heal up your mage friend, and your ret friend can toss blessing of protection on the mage.
---
There is a better one inn bwl
---
*\*desperation increases\**
---
&gt;I'd like to try this for raids
---
This sounds like 150 DPS set to me aka would never invite to the PUG again. It's not like people did not try out different weird itemizations and stuff, but you could see how terrible it is going to be straight away. Vengeance won't matter much if your base melee damage is extremely low due to the lack of STR and Paladin damaging spells scale with both STR and SPD or just SPD. You have neither of these, and being able to throw another few consecrations won't matter.
---
My prediction is that there will be sharding everywhere except for Azshara and Blasted Lands. The whole point of sharding is to lower the costs of maintaining servers. People on in BfA got ported for mass world PvP lol
---
It's a quest reward. Have to collect some skeleton fragments, then pay an NPC in Tanaris 15 gold, before he sends you to get some lava from un'goro.
---
After that you find 3-4 other players to kill a boss in Andorhal and you got your key.
---
I started on a private server last November, after 12 years I still had the keybind muscle memory...
---
Honestly, very few streamers get popular because they are amazing players in their respective games. They get popular because they are good entertainers.
---
if you're horde you can just have 2-3 shamans in tank group and have them rotate grounding totems.
---
Or just 1x very skilled shaman.
---
You have a point, but is that grind really worth the bragging rights?  
---
You're sleep deprived, tired and annoyed all the time, you're eating like shit and gaining weight most likely...
---
Is it really worth it?
---
Very good point
---
Stonetalon mountains is one of those zones that I always wanted to see more of. It is a shame that you never really return to it once you're done questing there. They could've made a lowlvl dungeon there tied to the venture company or something, or even the spiders living there. Imagine a short lvl30 dungeon with spider theme.

its the last chance for blizz to pick up their longtime fans from the bus station. if blizz decides not stop at the busstop so we can get on the bus nothing will matter anymore anyways.
---
Hunter
---
It doesn't matter, the only potentially "bad" choice is picking a class that has a mobility mismatch with the rest of the group. I.e zooming around the world as Hunter or Druid, having to wait for your crew while the boys are stuck walking to the destination.
---
I'd rather higher caps or some servers will end up low pop wastelands.
---
Druid can cleanse viper
---
if you are completely new i would suggest hunter. easy to level and a pet that tanks for you so you can stay in the back and chill.
---
pssst...he was using the "hunter item" joke. 
---
Claiming the reason is the change in the engine is just stupid, it got removed years before the engine changed. Source? I've been playing this game since the beginning, I remember very well both that fact and the fact that the vocal majority was constantly crying on the forums about how they could only play at night (after work/school) and the game was too dark because of it. What a coincidence that shortly after that they removed both the day and night cycle, and the dynamic weather from the game.
---
Awesome! Love the story behind it all :) thank you!!
---
so you are a [cat druid](https://tagn.wordpress.com/2009/07/20/alamo-teechs-u-2-play-durid/) ? Bc cat druid is for fite!
---
Hunter, beast mastery
---
Limited inventory space, our arch enemy.
---
I mod that in sp games. Need to collect all the things!!! 
---
Orc Hunter 
---
You're going to have a big wake up call when guilds fly through every piece of raid content in a day. Without defense cap.
---
I always end up with a piece of gear that I never find an upgrade for. If I'm still running around with a +2 Owl piece and finally find a cheap +5 Whale piece, I'm still going to switch. 
---
Three comments on hunter. Come on, guys, you wanna see one more hunter pulling everything in dungeons, rolling on hunter items and then finding himself in mediocre DPS tier?
---
Mage if you want to be accepted as is from lvl 1 to Naxx. Lock if you love smooth start, but obstacles afterwards up to ZG.
---
People are dicks online regardless of the game.

What's the reasoning behind taking strength over intellect, do you know? 
---
Priests were considered allround most useful PvP healer for like a decade straight. Resto Druid was king of 2s in TBC but then in WotLK Priests got Penance and they were king again.
---
I don't know if I'm just really high or what, but what if somehow...we created Azeroth in real life? Or at least certain places, like Stonetalon. Like what if they shaped that place to be just like stonetalon...but in real life?
---
Ignore the hunter comments, pick mage or lock. Melees are too gear dependent. Hunter might be easy for leveling but u aren't going to do great dps, especially as a new guy, you probably will pull stuff with ur multishot which will lead to kicks. They will ask you to tranq shot, trap, kite. 
---

---
If you're brand new to WoW i'd recommend a Rogue. They have a stealth mechanic and abilities that make them very forgiving out in the open world. They're great dps, easy to play, difficult to master. Great starter class imo.
---
Depends on the regions, I live in Bulgaria and usually raid with swe/ger/serb people. So if the whole EU is one region - I am fine. 
---
ty for answering. will try 4. later after work ;)
---
can you tell me which addon i can use for that? started on a private server lately and somebody suggested lazypig, for 3., but with that i only get the loot window at my cursor.
---
If you don't have much time then don't play feral dps druid in raids. It is probably the most farm intensive class to play if you want to keep up with DPS and actually contribute.
---
resto druid in the other hand is not very farm nor gear dependand in comparison.
---
If you really want to play a DPS in raids then why would you want to play one that is either objectively bad or incredibly time consuming?
---
This isn‚Äôt in any way why they only have 100 or so players.
---
The current servers are built around the idea of only having sharding, they are designed around it.
---
They had vanilla servers in 2004 they can easily replicate that in 2019, that‚Äôs not even a question.
---
Ditto.
---
I see myself in most of what you write. I dig the grind a lot. I use to raid hardcore and liked that too.
---
But the real fun for me was farming different materials and skilling my alts with professions. There was just something soothing (almost mindnumbing) about fx. following a set path to grind Rich Thorium Veins / Black Lotus, while on team speak with a buddy or two, talking about everything from this to that.
---
Another part I found awesome about vanilla was playing the AH. And I was good at it too. On good days, I'd average about 1.200gold for 2 hours on AH. I ended up being the second richest player on our server. Only surpassed by the guy that arranged PUG MC runs and selling items.
---
Rogue with herb/mining is just nuts.
---
Yeah, I used to really enjoy all night saronite farming sessions, only if my mate was on skype or whatever chat program we were using at the time though. we would farm the night away chatting shit and getting stupidly over exited whenever we found titanium 
---
Mal'ganis (and Arthas before that, quite a few transferred to Mal'ganis with &lt;Ret&gt;) was awesome for world PvP. I was mostly on the other end on Arthas before rerolling but plenty of people got ganked in Orgrimmar (especially when there was that bug where you could backstab with swords) and &lt;Ret&gt; downed Thrall as well.
---
Cats only became bleed heavy wotlk onwards. TBC is the same as vanilla: using wolfshead, fully abusing powershifting while spamming shred and using bite as the only finisher. Vanilla has even less issues with debuffs than tbc's version due to the lack of mangle. 
---
Or he could be memeing about every weapon beeing hunter weapon.. who knows.. my comment was uneccesary tbh.
---
The problem?
---
The problem is that people will quit one by one. The good ones will go first, then the raids will be even slower and then the rest will go.
---
The longer and less stable your raids, the less people will have time to show up on every raid, so you will skip entire weeks, which makes people even more unhappy.
---
Usually in vanilla guilds were "carried" by a dedicated core of people, who always showed up, farmed up, had the most efficient builds, and put out the biggest numbers. Yes there were suboptimal/meme builds and people with minimal consumables etc. But those players simply tagged along and benefited from others.
---
If you have too many of those in a raid, the raid gets slow, wipes more and won't progress nearly as fast through content, which means less items for everyone.
---
Hunter, mage, lock, rogue. All are desirable for dps mid to late game. Play style is your choice. 
---
 That's as close to autoloot as it gets unfortunatly (not sure how it's gonna be in classic yet)
---
For the debuffs I would recomend: [https://github.com/Voidmenull/DebuffTimers](https://github.com/Voidmenull/DebuffTimers)
---
and for the cast bars, I would go with: [https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/Natur-Enemy-Castbar/](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-addons/Natur-Enemy-Castbar/)
---
the mace stuns will happen during your regular stuns aswell.  
---
together with fast stacking DR the whole point of this spec is moot.  
---
the approach to take sprint and kick will work with a more SS based build though. or dagger ofc.
---
its good that you try and be creative about specs, but this one right here will perform really badly in almost every possible situation.
---
Actually the more meme specs and people w/o consumables or just straight up bad players you have the more raiding becomes like a job and not vice versa. Wiping more, taking longer means more time spent while getting less rewards.
---
People (try to) min-max because it means you get more rewards in shorter times and see much more content. The raids become "stable" the more min-maxers you have and you progress more steadily through content. Less frustration, more fun.
---
Spirit has a niche as a downtime reducer while leveling since it gives hp+mana(if available) regen. Something that's very useful during leveling. 
---
But that's not enough for most environments since for PvP and most group/raid PvE environments you'll have stronger assets for it (a dedicated healer, judgement of wisdom, mana stream totem...) or it won't be quick enough to matter (PvP mostly, raid boss fights if aggro'd as well). 
---
Guy kinda looks like Esfand
---
We don't know their plans going forward, however they have said they are currently only focusing on an authentic classic experience.
---
&gt; watching their guild implode
---
This is the big thing to take a way from this discussion. If you are wiping, you are not getting purple stuff and people get frustrated. When the drama starts, fingers get pointed. People leave.
---
+damage gear is far worse during leveling than going for +stam/int/spirit. You can't get enough spell power gear to make a bigger difference than a higher health or mana pool.
---
I always was a farming/grinding type of guy. Probably why in all MMOs I played, my in-game wealth was huge. The main advantage of farming / grinding, while time consuming, it also give you the option to simply enjoy the game much more than anyone else, after you accumulated a hefty amount of in-game currency.
---
Leveling alts or twinks, or simply run dungeons even if you really don't need to do it, but helping some guild mates / friends, is far more enjoyable and easy when you know that you have a pile of gold waiting to be used for BoE gear, consumables, repairs, etc.
---
It is a time consuming activity, and not something that I enjoy, but I do enjoy the effects of farming. Which is in-game wealth that gives you a lot of freedom and options for the actual enjoyable activities.
---
It is much more easier to wipe over and over again, and waste flasks and elixirs and potions...when you know that you can do it for weeks on a row, without farming. 
---
Because you already farmed enough gold to sustain your character for A LOT of time.
---
Hunter has one of the highest skillcaps tho. And it is easy to fuck things up (forgetting arrows, feeding pets, ninja pulling in dungeons).
---
Take mage.
---
Carebear spotted.
---
&gt; Do you think Blizzard knows if they don't get Classic right they could end up greatly improving unofficial servers? 
---
Yes, they know.
---
And I hope that because they know, they won't fuck Classic up.
---
Actually yes. The private servers existence is our guarantee for having authentic Classic. Because if it becomes filled with cash shop garbage etc, players will now have really authentic pservers to go to.
---
here why I believe that higher caps are a bad decision and do not fit the design. this is purely about PvP.
---
it increases players in the PvP pool.  
---
that sounds good at first, right?  
---
what I mean by this is that higher caps force players into the standings that usually refrain from doing any PvP at all.  
---
lets say you have 1000 rankers.  
---
additionally you have 1000 players who are only in for the PvE content. they do not plan to do any PvP at all.  
---
these 1000 guys will be missing on the honor calculation.  
---
on top of that you have another 1000 guys who do PvP casually.  
---
in the end your pool of PvPers will be arround 2000.
---
take the same ratio of guys on an overcrowded realm where they run into players from the other faction way more often then usual.  
---
3000 rankers. 3000 people with no interest in PvP and 3000 casual PvPers.    
---
what do you know, 1500 of non-pvpers managed to get above the kill cap for the standing. they never planned to, but it happened.
---
how is that bad now?  
---
well it artificially bloats up the PvP pool.  
---
in scenario 1 you'd have 2000 people in the pool. 66% of the server.  
---
in scenario 2 you'd have 7500 people in the pool. 83% of the server.
---
now, the same % of players on each realm are actively ranking.  
---
with the increased PvP participation due to unwanted PvP encounters the rankers in the 2nd scenario will have an easier time gaining ranks.
---
tl;dr higher caps increase the amount of players in the PvP pool, but they do not increase the percentual amount of competitors for higher ranks. which means that gaining higher ranks becomes easier.
---
Depends on your class, for ones that can use t3 then yeah it's a massive amount of upgrades from naxx.
---
But one of the classes people tend to complain about most with "OP gearing" is warriors and a lot of their upgrades in naxx aren't even that huge and a lot of their gear doesn't even come from naxx.
---
Quick example would be plated abomination ribcage vs breastplate of annihilation.
---
Pbr has 45 str 25 stam 1% hit 1% crit
---
Bof has 37 str 13 Stam 1% hit 1% crit
---
8 str is hardly an "insane upgrade" 
---
Also yeah of course there's upgrades in naxx...it's the final tier, my point was it's not as simple and just nerfing the gear as a lot of the gear from AQ and BWL are also very powerful.
---
OP sounds like keyboard turning ret paladin who got kicked from MC pug.
---
this is awesome, i wish i could be part of such a fun thing once
---
It's more than just that. It's a nice move for either healing or doing damage on the run (if you manage mana properly, spamming it is no good unless downraking due to rather high mana cost, like mage's arcane explosion) alongside being your only non-targeted anti-rogue move. 
---
You are comparing a boss drop to a trash drop right now lol.
---
Neither of them are trash drops, pbr drops from thaddius and boa drops from skeram so...nah
---
Braindead? I don't know. The most forgiving is got to be Mage or Paladin though. A bad Warrior or Hunter (like some people here suggest) is *easily* punished. Mages and Paladins have just so many things to defend themselves with and they both have a straight forward playstile.
---
But if were talking good players vs. good players then most classes/specs become "difficult".
---
It's not an inverted d, it's a mirrored q that got flipped vertically.
---
Hunter numbers are always skewed a bit because many players run a hunter as farm alt. Hunter mains will be more rare than polls indicate I think.
---
"BLIZZARD DELIVERING THE SASS WITH NEW UPDATE ON CLASSIC"
---
why i stopped following all wow content creators, better off just waiting for classic.
---
"DESTROYED? Hell yeah these noobs are gonna get DESTROYED in PvP once I enchant my weapon"
---
See this seems like you were really thinking ahead and being intelligent
---
Take a warrior (or a druid) to tank (you), let the new guy be a mage and 3rd guy a pally. It gives you food, water and later portals, super easy dps (1 button ranged dps class, with room to grow later on to CC, aoe grind, PVP etc ). Pally can heal in instances and dps in other stuff, great buffs for all. Then you can do instances easily, just adding 2 dps classes.
---
Druid would require you or them to run from nelf area, so warrior is preferred because of that. But if the pally is going mostly retri, you will have some gearing conflicts between the warrior ( but easy to setup his healer gear for sure). You wouldnt have that on a druid.
---
Cant go wrong with tank - healer - dps tripod.

**&lt;Kor Kron Vanguard&gt;** Semi-hardcore | PvE/WPvP | Server region: EU (NA welcome) | Server type: PvP | Faction: Horde
---
**Introduction:** If you're looking for some pre-BG PvP action or you're a PvE raider who's looking to put that gear to some good use whacking Alliance in the face with it, you're at the right place. Everyone earns their roles here, whether they're Social, Raiders or PvP-ers. 
---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community. 
---
**What we expect of members:** 
---
As a PvE raider: Knowledge and desire to improve in your class, as well as getting to level 60 and able to raid within 8 weeks.
---
As a WPvP raider: Show up at 3/4 of our weekly WPvP raids. 
---
As a Social: Participation in various social activities. (recruitment, social events, writing a 5 minute report etc.)
---
You are free to choose any combination of those roles within our guild. Currently recruiting all classes. 
---
**Our Raid Schedule:** Current plan is min. 3 major raids per week. (1 WPvP raid + 2 PvE raids) with Loot Council. Additional details (such as raid times, spots etc.) will be handled after the game launches. The WPvP raids are not be mandatory, but they will provide an advantage as a Raider in ties against other players when deciding for loot. Our timezone will be around GMT+1. 
---
**Guides:** A thorough introductory guide to structured World-PvP to show you how we get things done.

I levelled Druid on US launch as feral until about level 30 something.  Another Druid, one who played Beta, said to respec out of feral.
---
Can't remember exact spec but it involved meleeing mobs in NE form and proccing Omen of Clarity.
---
1.12 talents mean levelling as a feral is the way to go now
---
Leveling "a pure dps class" takes multiple days off your leveling time, too.
---
&gt; Wiping more, taking longer means more time spent while getting less rewards. People (try to) min-max because it means you get more rewards in shorter times 
---
It's not because you have offspecs in your raid that you will wipe more lol. That's nonsense. You don't wipe mostly because of enrage on bosses. You wipe mostly because there were people missing in the raid / not did their job / did not notice they were the bomb / MT healer missing heals etc.
---
And about the time it takes, as I stated in my above post, we know that and most of us won't care in Classic.
---
&gt; and see much more content 
---
Nah I'm sorry. You don't need to be faster to see more content this time.  It's not because you're not min maxing that you will clear MC in 6 hours, or that you will never go past whatever boss. Again there is no way some guilds would have gone all the way through naxx back in the day without minmaxing otherwise (and I'm talking about people relating their stories in this very sub as well).
---
Honestly, there is no right answer. Chose the class that appeals for you the most, you can easily use the mobas for refference. Caster/melee/support/tank archetypes are similar between the two genres. Just avoid healers if you want a strong dps class. I would highly suggest trying out your options on a private server so you can get the feel of it and also not be a complete noob once classic comes :P You can DM me for any info regarding the servers if you want.
---
I feel like there is almost as high of a ceiling with mage as with hunter. Sure you dont have 100 spells and its kind of straighr forward but you need to be able to navigate well and really know the controls and limits of the game. Kiting for example is something a new player might have trouble with and its a huge part of mage. I would definitely suggest a warlock to a new player more than a mage, because the pet makes the navigation and ease of the game so much better.
---
I was very happy doing 1-20 in 20 hours on my human paladin in TBC
---
I'd give madseasonshow a chance, he just makes videos about whatever in a very pleasant way
---
Played a shield slam sweeping strikes build in TBC when I outgeared heroics, sitting to get that physical damage boost too.... that shit was awesome
---
It might be worth waiting a while. Once a release date is announced, we'll see an influx of guild advertisements. I've joined a guild discord but there are no conversations going on because nothing has really happened since Blizzcon.
---
Engineers anyone?
---
A 10 minute video on the blue post mentioning that Onyxia will not be changed in Classic....how shocking\~

I'm sure a bunch more pictures will pop up now. Tirisfal could be a challenge

I actually feel bad for a lot of people I see trying to rationalize bad opinions. They are really excited about this content but I will bet they're going to run into some serious burn out and frustrations because they don't want to believe there is a wrong way to play vanilla.  I hope I'm wrong and they have fun and find success but facts are going to hit some people hard.

Won't Germans have their own server similar to retail?

dafuq? how can u play when u were 4? oO

Most launches are okay, but then I start at midnight the second the open. TBC was fine (can barely remember this one), Wrath was as well albeit difficult to tag mobs but 2 zones helped. Cata was more of a shit show, trying to tag anything was a nightmare but once you get ahead of the zerg it was fine. Skipped MoP. 
---
WoD was awful, couldn't load into the Garrison. Skipped Legion, BfA was completely fine, had no issues.
---
Female orc posture is fine. 
---
They probably will, the same goes for the Spanish community but yet a lot of German players still prefer to play with other people around Europe.
---
Could you imagine only being able to see 100 people in your zone instead of 200. Totally worth not playing at all because of it
---
Preach mentioned in his [TBC Legacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g75YgZL-HuI) ( a must watch IMO) the rage and hatred for SL/SL was, kind of correctly tbf to be assumed to be the noobest of the noob.

reported

Some classes need all stats. As a leveling feral druid you want to focus on agility, but strength gives you more dps as well. Stamina is always nice in PvP, and you can't have too small of a mana pool else you will be owned in PvP. Spirit is great because you regen your mana in cat/bear form so you can have zero downtime. So at some point you might go with an item that has more stat-points but the 'wrong' kind.
---
That would be illegal...

**&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild
---
**Introduction **
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded. 
---
One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment
---
 **Expectations from members **
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment. 
---
 **Raid information**
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00. We will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content once available for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.
---
contact Kyte#1707 on discord for more information!

Releasing anything but 1.0 is a change.

It's such a terrible layout though. "Here, go do 1 quest halfway across the zone without a mount, then come back to me for 2 more followups, then run to 2 other corners of the zone twice for a couple of quests each, then come back to this area 5 minutes from the nearest inn or flight path to turn in again."
---
One of the big contributors towards making 20-30 an absolute nightmare and the worst leveling bracket in the game.
---
This is pretty solid advice.   IMO the 3 new player friendly classes are mage lock and hunter.  The depth of skill on all three is also pretty high, so the poor players are obvious but the skilled really shine.
---
Sure it's slow, but I really love the area. And 20-30 for me is usually pretty chill, I always get fatigued around 50+
---
‚Äúsup guys it‚Äôs tip‚Äù
---
It's human after all. As a feral druid I'd rather not group with hunters or rogues either or - if it can't be helped -, at most only 1. So much competition for agi leather otherwise.
---
srsly, i am fine with the server remain the same after naxx. i dont need more what u call content in form of raids. just let me enjoy the game as it is. and it is so much more than raids.
---
This is not even funny, i'm legit worried about this 
---
These are my favorite wow videos. This guy knows how mafia works.
---
Goons did great in WoW. Remembering then blocking off Flight Masters and Mailboxes with furry mammoth mounts in WoTLK as well!
---
At least 50+ you don't have to cross entire zones with no flight points and no mount every hour or two because no individual zone lasts for more than about a level before throwing orange/red quests at you.
---
You're right about that, but I've never felt it being too annoying leveling in Stonetalon. Maybe only when you are causing a genocide of those coursers for their eyes. I actually like the running, gives me a little break to alt tab and do something else in the meanwhile.
---
planing on going skinning / herb while leveling and switch skinning for engineering at 60. playing rogue, planning to pvp a lot
---
Retail is a trash game, haven't played in years. Why is "go to retail" the only comeback you people can ever come up with?
---
"He said Vanilla wasn't the perfect version of the game in every way, he must be a ***retail baby***!!!!!1"
---
Unofficial servers aren't even close to being accurate. 
---
Recently I met a player who was looking to do WC. I said yes. We needed a tank, but our healer left. So he pulled out his lvl 60 Warrior and we did WC alone. I was a lvl 17 Hunter. He taught me everything about dungeons. How everything goes, what I need to do. How to roll for items and everything. He was really nice and helpful. I sure learned a lot. He also let me keep every gear that dropped.
---
Wrong sub, you want /r/wow 
---
But to answer your question you effectively go back in time for Wrath and BC levelling, also I'm pretty sure you have to go through all of them anyway if you are just levelling through quests.
---
Warlock for leveling, warrior for end game min/max
---
Met my partner of 3 years using Dwarven Tinder! 
---
Pet is great, but In terms of difficulty I think that is offset by having fear instead of poly as a CC, and having almost no emergency cooldowns or escape mechanisms. 
---
Warrior - Rogue - Priest no doubt. You do not share armor types. You have a tank and healer at the ready for any instance. Rogue is great DPS.

Yeah don't go hunter, these people don't know what they are talking about. It's 100% the class that fits into *"I just don't want to end of regretting which one I pick and wishing for a better class"*, smooth leveling only to find out it's a trash tiers DPS after investing hundreds of hours into your character. Unless you're a PvP player only, hunter is a noob trap.
---
Vanilla has a fairly low skill ceiling and any decent player will manage the leveling experience, don't limit yourself with a "noob friendly" class, this is not 2004 anymore.
---
Now the best class/race depends on your main focus in the game. Are you more into solo PvP/roaming open world? Are you more into group/premade PvP? Are you more into end-game PvE and raids? Are you more into casual dungeons? Or are you into all of these? Pretty much every classes shine in one area or another but none is good at everything (arguably), so it's best to decide which game mode(s) you want to focus on first, then select a class that's good in this(these) particular mode(s).
---
I think fast PvP encounters are way better though, also requires you to be more careful when to pop important skills.
---
It can get real old when you are at it with someone for 5 mins and both of you don't seem to be dying anytime soon (this pretty much happened in BC and just got worse overtime, I think you can pretty much duel with someone for 15 mins on Retail lmao).
---
And it had some part that costed quite a bit or gold too. Quite a bit of those elite quests in undead town andorral or whatever (atleast for alliance, thats the last time i did it).
---
I did actually not know about this. Incredible there always seems to be something ‚Äònew‚Äô to discover from this 15 y old game üòç

reported for reporting
---
Private servers are a carbon copy of vanilla. Far more accurate than Classic will ever be. 
---
Makes a stun build without dirty deeds and hemo. Hysterical.
---
Also, stun builds in general are bad because all it does is mess up your DRs for nothing. 
---
1/10. 
---
haha I was lying
---
reported for false reporting
---
You answered your questions yourself.
---
The upside is that private server try hards are addicted to the race to the top. As many others have said, even "noobs" get to raid eventually and the difference between gear diminishes. The tryhards then move to the next FRESH server and the cycle repeats.
---
Classic wow wont be like private servers. There wont be a reset every 2 years. My theory is that most tryhard private server players wont play classic. 
---
As for the toxicity. Sadly my friend, that is part of the times. Back in the 2004-2007 day, people who had the intellectual capabilities to build a pc, have good internet and actually spend their free time playing pc games werent jaded and bitter teenagers angry about everything. Nowadays any 14 year old Dota rager can download a game within 5 minutes and play it. People on the internet are angry and unfiltered nowadays and Im not even talking about political nonsense. Im talking purely gaming scene. 
---
Dota/CS and all those other toxic environment are shockingly hostile. Thats not a reflection of the games themselves, but rather the current Zeitgeist of zoomers and millenials. 
---
My advice: Play to have fun. Meet some relaxed and happy people and explore Azeroth for yourself. If someone sends you an angry whisper about sucking at PVP say "sorry you feel this way", slash ignore and go back to enjoying your game.
---
We‚Äôll see what happens. I‚Äôm prepared for the worst. 
---
  **&lt;No Plan Required&gt;** is an **EU Alliance** guild that intends to roll on a **PvP server**. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
 The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it. 
---
 Although we are strictly against approaching the game with a crazy min-maxing mindset as we understand that such playstyle may not suit us, we still hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. This means that all members who wish to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared and according to the schedule.   We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week. Unorthodox specs such as Retribution and Feral are all allowed, but are expected to work as hard as they can to retain the respective balance of participation in our raiding core.
---
 We hope to hang out playing other games and chatting &amp; mingling on Discord until the launch comes around, so we will be forming our guild's identity and getting to know each other well to ensure an enjoyable experience come Classic!

With that out of the way I am recruiting for the guild Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal &lt;SMBC&gt;. The reason I am making this guild is I have seen no guild fit my preferred play times for raiding and have decided to test the waters and see if anyone is on a Monday-Friday and does not want to stay up late on weeknights and push their sleep back to an uncomfortable spot. 
---
This guild will be a casual type guild while we will aim to progress through content as it is released I do not plan to enforce a strict attendance policy if you maintain a decent attendance I think its fine to take a day or weekend off here or there for other things since the game is not your whole life. I also am fine with taking some unorthodox specs as long as we progress in our groups.
---
While I do have many years‚Äô experience with WoW I have never led a guild. I saw a void in this time slot being offered and am intending to find out if there is enough interest in it to field a team. To help with my inexperience I am especially looking for some first-rate officers to help me shape and decide some of the finer points of the guild.

---
Sort of.
---
Original zones where revamped with Cata and placed after Outland and Northrend in terms of storyline. So you start further in time and then go backwards in Outland and Northrend.
---
As for Outland and Northrend being now both 60-80 so you can choose to do only one, and the same for Cata zones and Mists the are now both 80-90, that only came with the world scaling of Legion patch 7.3.5.
---
You should wait for level 26 preferably. You wont have coldnaps to save you every time a nova is resisted. Thus pre 26 you will have to reset pull if nova is resisted and cold snap is on cd. At 26 you will have cone of cold which will not give an additional nova, but an additional slow to control loose mobs. This might not be the case if you have high int, as you can mana shield. However you are talking about fast leveling, thus most likely minimal gear. 
---
No changes all that blah blah, all that aside the best case scenario I can think of is limiting potential server transfer need down the line.
---
So say you have a 2.5k server, that drops down to 1k people 2 months after launch, server is gonna feel like a ghost town. If the cap is 4k many more people can leave and keep a healthy population some months later, without needing to deal with server mergers duplicate names blah blah blah etc. I don't know if that is something they can do with sharding or whatever they are planning.
---
2.5k is fine IF it stays at 2.5k but this isn't exactly everyones kind of game there are going to be lots of tourists etc.
---
TLDR: Do whatever is needed to end up at 2.5k ish players several months from now, don't worry about the short term numbers.
---
I'm leaning more towards Redridge tbh
---
+
---
&gt; You are displaying an incredible level of dishonesty in your post,
---
When I have been nothing but clear and polite, and you are rushing to accuse me of incredible levels of dishonesty, I get this funny feeling. The feeling that you are about to wallow in incredible levels of dishonesty yourself and just want to get your accusation in first. Let's see, shall we?
---
&gt; nobody ever claimed Ragnaros in full greens is easy. Literally nobody. This is a strawman that you use because it's easier than to argue against my actual claims.
---
I frequently see people claiming as fact that pirate server guilds will clear MC in greens in the first or second week of Classic's release. Now you can try to play a game where you make up your own definition of "easy" and use that definition to deliberately misinterpret me, but as far as I am concerned if people reliably do this in the first week it's easy.
---
&gt; Secondly, you KNOW there is no proof that anyone killed Rag in Vanilla wearing greens and no fire res. 
---
Unlike you I am open to new information and ideas. I didn't *think* anyone had done it, and in fact I *think* it's so impossible as to be absurd. But if you showed me evidence I would change my mind.
---
&gt; as if my inabiltiy to do so somehow invalidates my argument.
---
It does. That's the point. If nobody could do it in real vanilla, but it's easy to do on every pirate server, that says to me that those pirate servers are not blizzlike as far as Rag goes. As many people who have seen real Rag and pirate Rag have also said.
---
&gt; What IS known, is exactly how much damage each of Ragnaros abilities does and often they are used.
---
That seems to be the issue. It is not universally believed, as you seem to think, that pirate servers have got Rag's damage and how fire resist works right.
---
&gt; The biggest difference between todays meta and back then is that every healer in the raid is sitting at 500+ bonus healing instead of having stacked intellect gear and the dungeon sets. 
---
Ah yes, the "everyone in retail was an idiot and nobody knew +healing helped you heal or +damage helped you DPS, only we pirate players know that" routine.
---
&gt; Nice personal attack here. I suppose the cognitive dissonance of Vanilla not being as difficult as you remember might have been too much for you to handle, hence the complete lack of any arguments.
---
I don't think you actually understand what an argument is. But we'll see when Classic is released, if they don't retune it.

**&lt;Pertento&gt; 
---
EU [RP-PvP] | Alliance
---
*Dedicated PvE with a social atmosphere* **
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‚Äòsemi-hardcore‚Äô guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‚Äòoff-spec‚Äô. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to **vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule:**

Wednesday &amp; Sunday 19:30 - 23:00 CET

---
**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] EU-PvE Server | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one character.
---
* Raid times are up for discussion still but I expect two raids on weekdays. (Most likely around 19-23 CET)
---
* Loot council (most likely).
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
&gt;Same for raids, with a 2000 server population, it means you have to bring 2% of the server with you if you wanna go. 4% of a faction. That's a looot. And only if the server is population capped.
---
That is not how it works. You can't have more than 2000-2500 players online at any given time, but there are more players on that server, just not at once.
---
Alot...
---
Pls take a sec to open and zoom before downvoting. Then downvote
---
Im playing on the LOTRO legendary server. First time playing the game and I love it. Also playing with ESO 
---
Wyvern lay eggs? I thought they were some kind of mammal
---
I dont know about herbs or ore, but i did like to grind mobs (on a class that actually could kill something) or doing instance grind, like lashers. The thing is, i need certain music to into the right feeling. Same thing with levelup grind. Never got into griding in private servers (other than being a alt-a-holic), since there was that feeling of uncertainty. 
---
Hopefully getting tons of gold in classic.
---
I know, but no other dungeon is called by the last boss' name, so it's a little confusing.
---
Hunter is noob friendly but only until L60. You're expected to know all sorts of things like kiting and split pulls for raids, and then you need to master the dps rotation.
---
i would not want that
---
I learned English by watching Seinfeld over and over again whilst farming Satyrs in Azshara. 
---
Those were the days, my friend.
---
I‚Äôm just playing arena on retail
---
Only allow players who's accounts show that they played in vanilla vote? lol That would never happen unfortunately. 
---
I don't see any reason why they can't have a few servers. One #nochanges server and one that used the poll system to make changes. 
---
Your comment contains a paradox and is false.
---
Imagine on day one theres a hundred servers, and a hundred thousand people want to play. Thats a thousand people per server, so something like 250 people all trying to quest in elwynn forest all at once. It would be pretty horrendous. 
---
You could try starting with 200 servers, but then after the initial buzz dies down you end up with a hundred underpopulated servers and you have to merge them.
---
Or you can have sharding in the starting zones for the first month or so, so everyone gets to actually play, and the rest of the game from lvl10 onwards can be completely vanilla
---
Anywhere from 2k to 4k is about perfect imho so I don't see an issue with a 2.5k cap.
---
No because the current community (mostly) doesn't want what Vanilla was. Maybe, if you added it down the line after those who want changes have already quit, *maybe*, it would work out better - but I doubt it. 
---
Hunter probably has the most difficult DPS rotation in the entire game (especially if we include pet repositioning and Raptor Strike weaving), while warlock and mage mostly just spam a single spell over and over. Not really comparable tbh.
---
Great, someone found the secret way. Would like to join our company?
---
Thanks for the explanation. But this seems even scarier haha "server is full, you can't log in". 
---
BGs would hands down be a Warrior with healers following them around. Solo otherwise would depend on the class you're fighting. 
---
Ah league, the toxic drain of the world.
---
"gg to flamers". 
---
A good reminder why i forever quit this game.
---
Yes but they don‚Äôt have to play there if they don‚Äôt want to, I‚Äôve raided with plenty of Germans on English speaking servers.
---
I'm fine with either option personally, aslong as the changes proposed aren't full blown retarded
---
Well it's not only about class, if you plan to get the best in PvP you must take care of racial+class combo !
---
As warlock, isn't Orc the best choice ? Stun resist make it "easier" versus hard opponent like rogue ?
---
Who is stronger for you : SP or warlock in wpvp? I hesitate between thoses classes
---
&gt; you have to go through all of them anyway
---
Not anymore. They changed it recently (last Legion patch 7.3.5 before BfA - world scaling), so now both Outland and Northrend are 60-80 and you can do only one of them, also Cata zones and Mists are now 80-90 and you can do only one.
---
Draenor - Legion - BfA sequence hasn't changed (not yet at least).
---
And we are not assuming this person is a complete idiot.  Being a new player does not mean you are not capable of learning.  Playing for possibly months before they even SEE a raid, then there is no reason to not pick hunter, as there is ample opportunity to research, practice and learn.  It is not rocket science, regardless of what you think.
---
Just want to point out...any of the original vanilla addons wont be supported.
---
Classic WoW is using Vanilla content but on the new architecture they've been using for current WoW. (Ie the backend). 
---
What this means is completely new mods are going to have to be created to be compatible with WoW classic when it releases.  So while I would expect *most* mods to be updated by their current caretakers, there might be a few that slip through the cracks and just simply won't exist in a compatible state.
---
I thought they made both Outland and northrend scale 60-80 but you had to do both, is that wrong?
---
I agree. Also possible is swap out mage for rogue, for the food and portals and aoe and stuff, and swap out the priest for a druid or shaman healer so you still dont need each others gear. Depends on which classes everyone wants to play of course.
---
Did exactly the same few days ago,hoping league drops its own mmo tho
---
Vanilla PvP is wildly imbalanced regardless, go watch PvP montages it‚Äôs just all PoM + Pyro or Windfury one shots.
---
If you clear the hardest raid you should get the best gear and stomp people with it, that‚Äôs how classic works.
---
4th or 5th? I feel like there's a story there somewhere...
---
My first ever character was an Undead Warlock named ‚ÄúTeste‚Äù. Teste was a bad Warlock. Teste got a brand new sword and used it on every mob. With this approach, Teste began to die‚Äîoften‚Äîaround level 12. By level 18, Teste was gone.
---
I never realized until around level 30 on my next character (Feral Druid) what I‚Äôd been doing wrong. However, I never looked back. After rolling that feral Druid I‚Äôve stayed a feral main through BC, Wrath, MoP, WoD, Legion, and now BfA (skipped all of Cata). 
---
I‚Äôm excited about Classic for a plethora of reasons, but the first two that come to mind are closed server communities and having the pre-Cataclysm world back. I‚Äôll probably not have time to really raid seriously, but it‚Äôll be a lot of fun to get back into leatherworking (as it used to be), immerse myself in the world I fell in love with more than a decade ago, and develop a reputation on my server again.
---
same here, playing the legendary server - but not first time, used to play it when skirmishes were a new thing. And, it seems even more classic without skirmishes - though I miss that nostalgia from Gondamon and Shire...
---
Baldur*, used to be a popular name like 3 generations ago. Now, we have a lot of old Baldursson's.
---
Well I'd probably be buying some cheap steam int gear, and 1%chance to resist isn't that bad... But I get your point
---
Very cool, although anything post-LK is not worth it, imo.
---
Pandaria was a lot bettet than wod tho, and you could argue its better than legion. 100% its better than bfa aswell
---
Me and my buddy made a pair of Tauren, he was a druid, i picked shaman. At one point he started this pretty long quest chain which gave you aquatic form. I tagged along, thinking id get aqua form aswellWe ran all the way to westfall for some underwater fissure he had to loot, not knowing the horde had their own fissure (somewhere in the Barrens i think). 
---
Was pretty disappointed, but fun times exploring.
---
And later i got ghost wolf, so all was good :3
---
&gt;arena 
---
still quite antivanilla behavior. Arena was the first esport'ish thing in WOW. Vanilla was esport-free.
---
Sure, you can learn to play any class - if this is the way you want to look at it, making a distinction between hard and easy classes is meaningless in the first place. I'm just saying that mage and warlock are the easiest classes in endgame PvE, while hunter is among the hardest along with feral druid and protection warrior. Never did I imply that OP shouldn't play hunter though, I actually think that hunter is a very attractive class specifically because endgame isn't as mindnumbing as with other DPS classes.
---
This skirts the edges of "related to Classic WoW" buuuuuuut I'll allow it.
---
Is Riot legit shook? *Discuss*

Grinding fishing for my dad counts as playing, otherwise what were i doing?

will not happen. they already have the retail game and blizz knows that its their last chance to not loose their big classic wow fanbase once and forever. 
---
One of the smartest decisions I ever made was cancelling my TV license. 
---
&gt;It's actually the go-to DPS spec for an enhancement shaman
---
Err, what? How is a 21/31/0 the "Go to" spec, when it's impossible to do?
---
Only downside with lock is the soul shards you have to farm up before each raid.
---
Nah. They've taken on 20% more devs. 
---
I‚Äôd agree this is the best 3 man premade. 
---
Pally isn‚Äôt as good of a healer as a priest or Druid though I thought. They can fill heals if there‚Äôs any deficiencies but not as a main in either that or tanking. 
---
you will have similair people dont worry.
---
I don't love farming quite as much as you do, but I do like it a lot. It's enjoyable to take a break from questing or whatever sometimes and set aside a few hours towards a goal of getting X stacks of this or that material.
---
what kind of pc is running this
---
Yeah the pally friend decided to reroll a warlock real quick but doesn‚Äôt like the pet. He‚Äôs adamant on staying pally. Asked him if he wants to be a dedicated healer or tank and he said he can spot heal while I play priest...not sure what that means. Mean while, the new guy isn‚Äôt enjoying being squishy. So he wants to stick with the hunter. 
---
All things considered I‚Äôm gonna lean towards the ‚Äúplay what you enjoy‚Äù mindset and equate this to a zero-sum gain. 
---
What do you think so? To be honest I have seen a lot of other posters say things like Rogues aren't welcome in PVP premades and that they don't beat Fury warriors in PVE.
---
&gt;Hunters can kite you into oblivion, if you don't know how to deadzone. If you do, they're free kills.
---
I have a lvl 60 hunter on a pserver. Recently I ran into a priest who seemed to have much better gear than me and he absolutely destroyed me even when I surprised him. Shield+heal made him absorb all the damage, fear on pet and I was done.
---
Release date is September 30th. Mark it in your calendar. 
---
Wow private server, but dps. Ill health in retail.
---
Why would they go the OSRS route when they have a wealth of expansions to roll out? Even if they just do vanilla -&gt; wotlk, that's like 6 years of content right there.
---
Yeah they could just sit in vanilla and roll out stuff like Arenas and class changes, but they'd be doing the same shit that TBC aimed to do.
---
That seems to be the case; it's working for me now. Great map, OP! Very cool.
---
There's the elite zone though, nice farming spot (just before the elites with oozes and panthers. Oozes drop a shit load worth of gold in greys.) 
---
i hope we will be able to play alpha and or beta around May but the actual release will be in August yea.
---
Probably why the quest took 4 hours
---
Ballers gate yo. That could run on anything from OPs time period
---
&lt;Murloc Overlords&gt; \[Horde\] EU-Undecided Server Type
---
We are currently a group of friends that met up within WoW. Our guild was part of a larger guild that become corrupt, which led us to disband from it and go a different direction. Throughout all of us, we have people that started at BC and others at Legion. We are open to newcomers as I only joined at the end of WoD and have had minimal experience within private servers as well.
---
Our main goals are currently to just get a community of players to play throughout Classic and depending on the numbers, we can make additions to the guild like raid days/community events etc.
---
As of now, the server type that this will be played on is not decided, hopefully by the time that we have more players, we will be able to have a goal as a guild to partake in mainly PvP or PvE activities.
---
In general, this is not a hardcore guild, if that is what you are looking for, i would recommend going elsewhere. We are here to have fun and make some new friends during that period.
---
Here is our discord, feel free to join and talk to us about anything gaming related. [https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb](https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb)
---
If you have any questions about the guild, message me on reddit or join the discord and send me a PM from there (I am Cattman312 on discord)
---
I hope to talk with you soon, and if not, i hope that you find what you are looking for in the rest of this page.
---
The correct answer is whatever most appeals to you. Most classes can be strong in their own ways. Mage, Warlock, Hunter, Rogue, druid, shaman, or even fury Warrior. As for race, again don't worry as much about that. Go for what looks most fun for you.
---
It's not that much complex, more like there is a good amount of tricks you could use to optimize your performance in PvE, and this makes a difference between good and bad hunters.
---
Hunter is by far the best at ranking before bg btw.
---
&gt;.&lt; Somehow that simply did not occur to me. Thank you
---
That's the whole point. Vanilla was designed to be leisurely. This is not a mistake.
---
Now, you might not like it. Most people want "streamlined" experiences, nothing wrong with that. But the point is that it's not a "terrible layout". It's a fun layout if you don't rush.
---
Depending on how many people show interest I could be interested as well, im traditionally a horde player but might be open to ally if I knew I had a good guild waiting for me 
---
Nevermind the path, what the heck is that polearm and how have I never seen it before?
---
Don‚Äôt use any tinder, dwarven or not, it‚Äôs much better to meet girls straight up irl
---
Rogue. Mage is for aoe, and you eont get the best of the class unless you love to aoe
---
A good rogue is always wanted IMO, puts out that deeps sunset to sunrise 
---
That would be the Grand Marshal's Glaive. 
---
Wow modding is pretty common nowadays
---
It's almost like you can pick specific clips for a PvP video and not all the times you don't one shot someone. There are loads of videos out there which aren't just one shots on low geared players. 
---
Hi, /u/G-rrr
---
Probably, hopefully not. When beta comes we will have a clearer picture.
---
Around level 40, I just try to level once a day and keep it chill. 
---
I played this combo in actual vanilla and we managed to clear all five man content as a trio. Some of the high level dungeons are challenging though, making it really fun.
---
8 str in that situation is a 21.6% upgrade. That's certainly a significant increase in power if all items are similar upgrades. 
---
maybe
---
They did not layoff devs what I heard. If I am wrong please correct me. 
---
Tri spe is way better to help your team in bg.
---
That being said, if you just want to play alone and melt face, full shadow is the way to go.
---
[These](https://i.imgur.com/4g9OAri.png) do not even look remotely the same to me :s
---
Doubt it. 
---
Yeah sounds good. It all depends on your dedication and who you are playing with. I will most likely play with people I study with, so we could probably be pretty hardcore during the summer, but as soon as the classes start again, back to 1hr a day at most.
---
Played an undead priest for a good chunk of vanilla and pocket healed for quite a few guildie warriors.  Main advantage of priest by far is dispel magic.  I generally did not need to heal the warrior outside renew to keep them topped off.  Most of the time I am supporting by two things 1) keeping them dispelled from CC so they can reach their targets and faceroll 2) staying alive while everyone tries to kill me.  Survival as a priest while supporting your pocket was probably as good or better than your druid/shaman equivalents mainly because most of the spells you are casting are instant cast(dispel magic, pws, renew, psychic scream) allowing you to use terrain to LoS as much as possible.  Windfury while nice for big hits doesn't really change much if you are pocket healing a well geared warrior as they kill their target in a few hits anyways.  Purge is nice but wont help when your warrior gets polyed or rooted (yeah I know grounding is a thing).  Druid also suffers from lack of dispel besides poisons.  Druid can probably survive the best but also has the lowest ability to help the warrior to successfully kill their targets as quickly as possible.
---
In TBC for arenas I would say druids win hands down.  A good druid is almost impossible to kill and they can provide offensive support with cyclones for CC.  Obviously priest and shaman also work but they are not as mobile and are not able to drink as easily as a druid to keep the mana up.  Really though warrior/healer is a top tier set for any 2v2 arenas (so if choosing for vanilla + tbc I would go either priest or druid, leaning towards druid because arenas matter a bit more than normal BG facerolling).
---
Not Blizzard devs, but some King (mobile games aka Candy Crush) devs were laid off.
---
Thats looks kinda like GM Glaive, but surelly thats another one weapon!
---
Thats looks more like Maladath and GM Glaive mix for me, idk what exactly that item is. Maybe some BWL polearm from beta, that was scrapped?
---
Anyway I like it :-)
---
Considering the state of BFA, the current community opinion of Blizzard from the gaming world and the complete lack of any upcoming Blizzard games that any Blizzard fans care about...(?)
---
I would think a timely/faithful recreation of Classic WoW should be top of the priority list for Blizzard, to bolster sub numbers and get some community faith back.
---
Ah you know your right....
---
Yeah, as Shadow Priest I usually go for full spirit with a hint of stamina. Of the Whale is actually my favourite while leveling ofcourse.
---
Spirit for obvious reasons (spirit tap) and stamina for potential double/triple pull, I need the Vamp. Emb. to get some time to heal. And for that I need a larger pool of HP. 
---
I also use improved Vampiric Embrace.
---
This specc/gear composition makes buying drinks almost a waste, especially if you get a decent wand while leveling.
---
Easily affording mounts etc
---
Druid is all about that being best FC in WSG. Warriors are trash without a pocket healer andor eng andor a great 2hander. Hunters are good fun but definitely fall off later on.
---
They solved the issue of overpopulated Realms with free transfers to underpopulated servers.
---
Yep, working for me too now, and ah...haha, holy shit is it huge.  That would explain it!
---
Content Creators these days are like seagulls hovering nearby for scraps from Blizzard.  Once they've fed on the scraps they then regurgitate it to their young (aka viewers).  
---
The problem is, occasionally some content creators do have good insight into meta developments, but they "fuel the fire" more often than not.  A personal example of this for me is Rhykker.  He has really good insight into top tier builds for Diablo 3, and how they rank against each other and how they change from season to season. But then he turns around and creates "content" videos with deliberately inflammatory statements meant to pander to the viewers who frequent reddit and stir up controversy. 
---
He's the new age "There's no news like bad news".  He just eats that shit up and loves the views he gets from making inflammatory/clickbait titles.
---
The best content creators are the ones who don't rely on another media source or announcement to make new content. (creators like CGPGrey, SimpleHistory, Dorkly, etc)
---
Ok I do need to address this. It's simply a pin i found on the ground about 2 blocks away from my house. I do not associate with the white power movement in anyway 
---
I'm at work, which blocks gaming related sites.  Can you give me a synopsis, or copy-paste? :)
---
Hmm, indeed, I don't think that's correct.  What you could do is go from Darkshore to Menethil Harbor by boat and then go to Theramore Isle from there.
---
Yah i cant recover that account i dont think. 
---
Anyone else get a Classic WoW confirmation email? I received one a few days ago. Every time I've received one I got BETA access shortly after. Might be seeing a BETA fairly soon.
---
Meanwhile back In ratchet a goblin is telling his friends on the dock ‚Äúno really... I asked for wyvern eggs HAHAHA right? But then he actually brought me some eggs... I‚Äôm afraid to hatch them...‚Äù
---
Paladin is the best single target healer in the game, period.
---
I'm going into this with a friend and the wife. I tried warrior, priest, rogue in vanilla and I think we concluded that a mage would have been even better (for dungeons ofc, outside dungeons you can play whatever). I do remember us having ample use of two fast interrupts, healer mobs can be a real issue in vanilla.
---
Pala tanks work quite well in dungeons, there really isn't a problem from what I remember playing with a newb friend that played prot without issues. Pala tanks do really good damage compared to the alternatives. It's definetly the easiest tanking class to play as long as you give him a second to build initial aggro. If you go with a pala or druid tank you pretty much need to have a rogue as dps though to get a fast interrupt + CC.
---
If one person is set on being a paladin I would go for Prot pala, rogue, priest. Prot pala is fun, are great against packs when you are out questing. Rogues have good interrupts and a CC (sap) which will be more or less required if you are going to be able to play the later dungeons. Priest are the most versatile healing class that also does the most damage.

We are still working away on Classic and look forward to getting it out to you later this year. Does that count? Or were you looking for something in particular? Let me know if it‚Äôs something in particular so I can look into it.
---
If you just want me to let you know that we are working on getting Onyxia to be like the original Onyxia, yes, that is the plan. Now who‚Äôs ready for an attunement run?
---
i saw this photo in earthporn sub and the first thought was "damn, maybe i should play some classic wow. for the horde, obviously, because there is something catchy in calm rainy mulgore, wild and vast barrens and shithole stonetalon mountains are.
---
Thanks!
---
RTX **ON**
---
What is the state of BFA and how was it received? I haven't been keeping up
---
implying you will find a girl on tinder while being under 6'0
---
Spirit on Warriors is actually really good for leveling if you get a few points.
---
I was on board with them adding more content that isnt just the next expansion such as the dungeon in north kalimdor (forgot the name) and hyjal along with the other cut content but someone (i think staysafe) said if you dont like the current content in retail why would you want the same people to make more content in vanilla and once that clicked I havent wanted them to add things since.
---
If you are going to play dungeons with this setups the hunter needs to be a decent player to be able to pull off the CC and interrupts. A good hunter can be a good asset but there are plenty of opportunities to be a bad hunter in dungeons. A thing to consider if the hunter is a beginner. If he is generally good gamer he will of course have no problem to learn.
---
That is the best way to do it imho. In the end, it is your experience and what you think is fun that matters. 
---
Taking the mmo out of rpg. Who would have thought it would be the leaders of the genre
---
At launch it was bad, and was received really badly for a number of reasons.   
---
I'm unsure of it's current state, to be fair, but they've already burned a whole bunch of people which probably won't be coming back in this expansion cycle. I'd imagine sub numbers are currently the lowest they've been in the past 10 years, although I'm not basing that on any data.
---
Depends. A godmode druid can single handedly win WSG. Rogues with engineering are annoying as hell in AB. In world, classes with snares (Hunter, mage) or spammable cc (mage, warlock) are king. Warrior is easily top tier with gear and as long as they have a healer, ESPECIALLY a paladin. Also, shadow priests melt faces.
---
All these "wow killers" couldn't do anything to stop wow, only wow. 
---
&gt;still quite antivanilla behavior. Arena was the first esport'ish thing in WOW. Vanilla was esport-free.
---
What's wrong with esports?
---
Haha, thanks for the memories.  Growing did indeed take quite some time.  I remember seeing people in Shire planting/growing and I tried it myself.  It was probably one of the more tedious professions, which ironically it's surprising that it was so lucrative.  (I mean compared to WoW cooking, but then again WoW cooking is a secondary profession that everyone can have....if it was considered a primary profession who knows if it could have been lucrative as well...)
---
It's faster yes, by quite a lot.  At 22-23 it's still a bit shaky but when you hit that new rank of blizzard and coc it begins to be pretty easy.
---
That's being said, managing to get the spot(they're rarely more than 1 where you can do it at a given level) for yourself in an another story. 
---
I remember it was the first zone I encountered alliance players, then I died shortly after...many many times.  That zone was my practice zone for PVP.
---
But is there any way to tell in terms of narrative that the outland and the lich king are back in time?
---
I'm currently testing out a BM hunter and I am finding that anything with +Stam on it is super valuable. Why? Because my pet does loads of damage and I'm the one getting targeted by the enemy faction. Thus, if I can outlast damage, the pet usually does enough damage to take the enemy out before they can kill me. It also means that I don't have to use growl because I'm not doing as much damage myself, leaving an extra spot for either bite or claw, meaning increased damage. 
---
Props on playing it.  I tried to play it (legendary server) but the graphics did not age well and I found it hard to be vested in it.  They add back in Monster combat yet?  That was the other reason. I miss my spider...and found that legendary servers didn't have monster play in it (yet...)
---
Should I play on a private server while waiting for classic?
---
Is lotro free to play? I recall playing it briefly a few years ago but I'm not sure if that was a legendary server or if they even existed then
---
Here are a couple
---
[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByRZPUrocWk)
---
[and this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz1_DLm3mCk)
---
Also thought it was going to possibly be old school footage from actual vanilla back in the day not current private server shenanigans.  Still didn't down vote because I usually don't and I kinda figured it was going to private server rather than vanilla due to the Un'Goro Mafia part which did not exist in vanilla.  Just wish people would be clearer on labeling scheme as vanilla vs private vs classic are all going to be very different experiences.
---
Nice share! I can skip BRM gank fest now!
---
P.S. I would be very grateful if you'll tell us your polearm's name.
---
Sincerely, your troll-Company. 
---
I've been really digging the idea of playing a Gnome Mage and a Dwarf Priest as an alt. But honestly I'm just about as interested in playing a Troll Hunter and an Orc Warrior alt. I could go either way.
---
There was Tauren "wild West" dungeon on the original plans.  Stonetalon would have made a nice place for it.
---
Possibly, but like I said. Every time I've gotten one previously, I got a BETA invite soon after.
---
I would say thats pure coincidence 
---
DUDEEEEE!!!!!!!!!! Dont make me hype and freak out. I almost have a hearth attack.
---
I feel like people who suggest rogue in vanilla really don't know what they're talking about. They do great DPS, but warrior does it better, and is easier to play and has more options.
---
Rogues are a nightmare to level. You easily get beat in pvp by most other classes (Hunter, mage, warlock, druid, etc) unless you have engineering and are extremely game knowledgeable. It is easy however to "gank" randoms in the world when you have your 5-10min CDs up. Outside that, gg.
---
Did you just cast stone skin or just happy to see me?
---
To give context 8 str = 16 attack power which is worth just above 1 flat DPS...which as I said is not an earth shattering upgrade.
---
I think you missed the point. Yes, sharding will be necessary for better performance in the first month-ish, but given how current servers work and how they have a really hard time supporting 100+ players at a time in a single shard, this leads me to believe that sharding will exist in Classic for beyond that 1 month period. 
---
Yeah orc is generally best for locks. Although cannibalize is pretty underrated in BGs. You can tap and eat someone to get mana and hp back quickly while still in combat. It's not particularly useful for world pvp though.
---
What??
---
40+ is the easiest part. At 50+ you can quest almost anywhere plus you are mounted and have way more dungeons you can run if you don‚Äôt want to grind quests. 
---
It‚Äôs where the games becomes... the game. Way more to do. At 20-35 it drags for me since you can limit yourself.
---
Paired with rested xp it‚Äôs a breeze 50+
---
Never seen this before a beta/alpha invite. 
---
Stonetalon always did give a Utah/Colorado sort of vibe to me
---
Well the simple answer is that with the tens of thousands of people who visit this forum it probably covers everything from people who didnt play vanilla to R14s to killing KT in naxx.  Not a helpful answer I would think but there isn't really a good way of answering unless you just want peoples individual experiences in which case you are better off searching for previous threads on it.
---
My personal answers 1. yes 2. no a lot. 3. yes all raids didnt finish naxx tho. 4. depends what is heavy I never ranked up much, did a good chunk of world pvp and organized BGs (quality not quantity). 5. no private server 6. quit after candyland patch in TBC and haven't looked at anything more recent besides youtube rarely while waiting for classic.
---
Stonetalon may have a crap layout but it‚Äôs only a day/half day zone depending on your speed l
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the ‚ÄúHigh Warlords Guild‚Äù, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt‚Äôve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would‚Äôve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn‚Äôt possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we‚Äôlll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn‚Äôt evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
Therefore, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don‚Äôt be shy and join our Discord server, available at [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) or simply apply at https://www.hate-guild.eu/ 
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.

---
I mean, WSG is the only BG a druid can heavily contribute to, and you don‚Äôt even need to be godmode. If the enemy team is just slightly lagging behind even a mediocre druid can do flag carrying successfully.
---
So you wait there 2h for Star Citizen to release.
---
I am not asking for advice; i am asking for personal preferences when it comes to pvp.
---
More content for asmongold I suppose. 
---
It's just bad.
---
Classic Games... Maybe it's not just classic WoW Blizzard is working on? Classic Diablo? Any ideas?
---
I hope it's NA, EU, RUS, China, and SA with their own "regions". Maybe EU/RUS could be the same region, but language barriers are lame. Honestly I don't care as long as the Chinese are region locked.
---
Yes, that is a good way of putting it. Accepting defeat and throwing in the towel. Sharding is going to be a part of Classic history because of cost cutting and we are stuck paying the bill.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. Classic releases in the summer in about 4-5 months time. If you are not super hardcore starting on a private server now you would probably just scratch late game and probably be burnt out when it comes out.
---
I find the orc racial a bit overrated, unless you plan on going rank 14 min-max. It‚Äôs still better than most racials but it‚Äôs not the godlike racial people make it out to be.
---
Warlock has a lot of CC; stuns should not that much of a challenge.
---
Honestly I think you are just about spot on with your insights already.  I also played a hunter in early vanilla and nostalgia is almost making me want to pick one up again for the reasons you stated.  I doubt mages ever gain survivability outside of their frost talents and aq/naxx gear only increases their damage potential with minor increase in hp/armor.  I think the warlock tipping point was around late BWL-AQ40 where they get strong and by naxx they are at the top (but I didn't play one and my memory is really fuzzy at the time period).
---
sorry, maybe i am late -its monday- , but:  
---
as a rogue, can I obtain 2 weapon bonuses from combat talent tree?  
---
for example: 5/5 macestun + 5/5 dagger spec 
---
do I get the chance on stun with MH attacks if I wield a mace MH and do i get the additional 5% crit if i have a dagger OH?
---
thanks guys
---
Druids are extremely fit for AB also. They can defend against any 1v1, and can delay much longer than a warlock or Hunter. Also really strong paired with a rogue for capping bases.
---
Shaman for WF totem, every other thing you can think of is useless as long as you play with a warrior.
---
Classic as Wc3 reforged...
---
True
---
But I do expect the most popular addons (debuffs, castbars, KTM, Dmg-meters, Raidtools), will be available (most likley in a "not optimal" state) from launch (people will be developing them as soon as they get access to beta).
---
Does fear break stealth in vanilla?
---
Yeah, appreciate your effort but you are 100% incorrect unfortunately. I feel like people who get butthurt over advice given to a new player are sad, incel, beta males.
---
&gt; Rogues are a nightmare to level. 
---
Based on what exactly? Lets use your comparison with Warriors. Warriors even during levelling are gimped without gear since you will be rage starved. Rogues don't have this problem at all.
---
&gt; You easily get beat in pvp by most other classes (Hunter, mage, warlock, druid, etc) 
---
You don't have to fight anyone if you don't want to?
---
Just remember that not everyone is a sad little weeb who enjoys min maxing every small detail and some people play the game to.... have fun :)
---
What was your spec? I‚Äôm thinking in this case a 31/20/0 would be ideal for the pet fear immune and stun. You sacrifice dps but if you don‚Äôt have T2+ it‚Äôs not that big of a sacrifice anyway.

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster üòâ in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server.

You are aware that Blizzard currently use sharding, in order to pay less for servers without needing to upgrade to the latest &amp; greatest hardware?
---
Enjoy progressing MC with your non-binary raid group.
---
Do you have any suggestions for what profession to take with hunters?
---
Whats your map addon name?
---
Imagine being so weak that mere words offend you
---
I'm a game developer and I've been playing wow since 2005 so I guess it's similiar, but I'm more of a programmer type I guess
---
Later this year indicates a late summer release in the second half of the year? 
---
I want some raid leader to abuse me on discord, thats part of the fun.
---
That fade in  in first seconds with Searing Gorge music makes me so much nostalgic!  Good ol' lava lands with Dar Iron shitters! 
---
ok hands up how many besides me just checked there mail inbox and spam
---
Classic hype got me last summer, so I decided to play on a PS.
---
I did 1-60 leveling rly fast + I was almost full preBis, when I realised "oh fuck, i might get burnt out till '19 summer"
---
so I stopped my progresson on that character and currently I am neutralizing my future "alt-oholism" by getting every class to lvl 35-40-ish. (done that already, now I can give advices my friends about future class picks + I can show them in action too) 
---
Now I am 100% confident on my future class pick (not the race lel)
---
then started leveling another char (full casual mode this time, enjoying every aspects, since I dont play anything srs on 60 on this PS, I dont feel the urge to rush) ... maybe I will get another one to 60 untill summer.
---
by this I will be able to do 1-40 blindfolded, + I will have a confident 40-60 way.
---
tl:dr: i dont think its a waste of time, but be careful of overdosing before actual classic :D it is a great way of preparation especialy if you want to min/max, speedlevel

Except almost the entire rest of Azeroth isn't nearly as bad. Especially once you're 30+ (or 1-20) and the layout allows you to stay in one area for more than an hour without running into an orange/red quest wall. Or at least to naturally progress without massive treks on foot.
---
40+ with a mount and flight points is downright great.
---
Thx for sharing, yeah that looks similar! 
---
an MMORPG isn't a esport . . .
---
Probably not. BfA was their fastest selling expansion to date and while the game is dull as fuck for people who raid / rated pvp, the game is perfectly okay for most of the playerbase. The game is built around the casual mindset after all. 
---
I need to feel 13 again
---
It depends on what gear you are using I suppose. Strength heavy builds opt for 10% stressed whilst full spell damage should opt for 10% int since you wouldn't have much str gear if BiS.
---
Thanks for the good catch I'll edit the link
---
I played this Murloc game once aeons ago but died and gave up. This thing is aersome. Thanks for sharing man!
---
On a live server where you get to keep it forever? Hell yes.
---
Private server where some random russian could have a bad breakup with his girlfriend and have it all go poof? nah
---
Uhhhh yea, and thats what leads me to believe that the same will happen with Classic; use those same servers to reduce costs.
---
If you did this you would only get half the value out of each of those talent points. Only your MH attacks with the Mace would have a stun chance and only your OH attacks with the dagger would have the extra crit. There are much better ways to spend talent points than getting white crits with your OH weapon. 
---
Warrior, Rogue, Shaman would be a beast group. mad DPS and just enough heals.
---
I think that the first couple of months will be muddy waters in relation to these stats.  Alot of current retail players have never played Vanilla.  They will want to try it, and they know nothing about it, so at first we will have alot of classes represented because of current retail knowledge of the game only.  Then there's the slow leveling speed and one mob at a time cruelness of Vanilla.  These people are used to being 50 times stronger than they should be in full heirloom gear with 300x XP rate and just plowing through everything...gonna be a big wake up call.
---
So I think that the actual population stats will naturally correct themselves, but it will take a few months.  Once that happens you will probably see similar stats as that of pservers.
---
If they did use the same type of infrastructure that they use in retail then Classic will fail, it is as simple as that.
---
I will contradict several people that has already posted here and say that it would actually benefit us to have a voting system. We have the largest streamers on our side, the ones with the most influence and there's no way we would not get what we wanted in every single vote. BUT with that said, there's zero chance of this happening.
---
If Blizzard decides to move forward after a very successful classic WoW, then that would mean classic TBC and maybe classic Wotlk after that depending on the community in a few years. They have already expressed negativity towards even changing health pools or whatever since they doesn't want to touch the data, so I mean.. it's obvious that they won't make any new content to classic WoW and will simply just move to classic TBC when classic WoW is "done".
---
You don't want a druid main tanking Ossi if you can help it he hits like a truck. 
---
Most things will be cheaper at start.
---
But if you manage to be in the front runner group, you can actually sell craft material pretty expensive because some people will want tiers-level material they don't have access to yet, this is true for leather for example.
---
I was a little kid when I started playing WoW back in '04, and now I'm oh so very close to wrapping up my game art bachelors.
---
That was my first thought as well. Maladath, but on a S T I C C
---
Don't worry!  I'll be there with my female Orc Warlock!
---
thanks for your reply, it makes sense!
---
Yeah, and with a warrior, you guys will be able to run any dungeon you want and pick the dps from the cream of the crop lol.
---
I would disagree with that personally, but you could be right. I don't know anyone who still plays, and I'd say 90% of the people who played it on my BNet friends list now don't - but obviously that's anecdotal.
---
Risky click of the day
---
Best way for a hunter to kill an overgeared priest is to harass him with viper until he's oom since priest can't dispel poison. 
---
Where is the confirmation that Classic will start out with 16 debuff slots?  Can you link a blue post or info that came from Blizzard?
---
What prompted this email from them? Is there a place on the blizz site to regain access to a classic account?
---
Would be nice...
---
Sincerely,

Classic Games?

Those African Princes are fucking with our feelings now with the WoW Classic E-mails. Step too far.
---
Stonetalon Mountains, as a zone, is one of the things about WoW that always melts..melted my heart.
---
I was but a child when I started playing WoW, and the sense of adventure immersed me in the world. Dun Morogh was my very first zone, but it felt cold and I was quick to make a new character. When I saw Elwynn Forest, I have only one thought: there's a mystery and an adventure behind that tree. And there are many trees. And that's how I felt. I'd take a look in any direction and I'd sense adventure. I walked from Northshire to Goldshire, and along the way, as I saw the trees I saw adventure. I felt adventure. It stunned me. Hell, even today I know Elwynn Forest east to west, north to south, but whenever I take a look in any direction, I still feel as if there's something undiscovered, something new that wants to be chased, sought and fought, despite the disappointing fact that the zone has been the same for eternity.
---
The other zones didn't share this same sentiment, save for a few. Stonetalon is one that shares a similar fate! I was a newbie when I discovered it. I had been walking around Ashenvale (Or the Barrens? I don't remember) underleveled (I loved to wander more than I loved to level), when I crossed the border. There it was. A forest. I was stunned yet again! More adventure! But I was killed by a tarantula and never went back. 
---
Yet years later I went back to Stonetalon for the second time, properly geared and at an appropriate level. When I saw the forests again, that feeling of adventure hit me again! And it was real, I had never explored the zone before! This was after the remake, and I enjoyed the storyline. One of the best ones imo. The old world, however, had a different sense of adventure, where you are the one who makes the adventure and the story, not Blizzard. Both have their limitations, but I love both ways of gameplay.
---
And then there are the other zones. As you level up, you discover and learn more. In Westfall I felt Stormwind's abandonment, in Duskwood I felt the dark and mysterious and scary, Stanglethorn Vale was where I witnessed the first bloodshed! The PvP was brutal. Tanaris as well, but in Tanaris I felt like a mercenary. And this is where the sense of adventure ended.
---
After that, it all turned into numbers. Level this, level that, put talent point there, equip this, do this much damage, get this much gold, pop your cds, enchant this, enchant that...The humanity in me was lost. You became a healing, damage dealing or tanking machine, so that you could equip an item in order to become a better healing, damage dealing or tanking machine to repeat the process and get another item which would...you get the idea. At one point I remember, we were doing the Deadmines and we reached the ship. I wanted to take a moment to grasp the scene, and I did. The mage and the priest were drinking and I was observing. Try that now, and you get kicked for slowing down the group as they three-shoot the trash.
---
Tried and failed miserably to get my girlfriend now wife into WoW some years ago by starting new characters on a private realm. My mistake was I also started playing with my brother who, like myself, is a WoW veteran and knew everything beforehand whereas my wife was having difficulties getting acclimated to the controls. So we're off killing things and planning out ok, we need to go here, here, and then here, meanwhile my wife is trying her best to keep pace. 
---
Lesson learned though. For Classic I'm going to let her dictate the pace and take the scenic route with her instead of my usual breakneck leveling pace. We'll see if she still has an aversion to WoW when Classic releases.  I'm trying to do everything I can to ease her learning process. I've worked out a Steam controller config that will allow her to play more comfortably and for longer than she can with M/kb. :)

Later this year usually means anytime between now and 31 December, 2019.

Its nothing, most likely scammaz mail
---
But how am I supposed to survive long enough?
---
All those points in disc but not throwing a single point in divine spirit ?
---
What‚Äôs the interest in improved renew? Also there seem to be better holy pvp talents than reach or imp healing (such as inspiration or blessed recovery)?
---
the osrs voting system is controlled by the subreddit
---
the bfa players would likely end up controlling the wow votes too.
---
We can certainly still try.
---
I honestly prefer it the other way. Get up at 5 in the morning, play to 10pm, sleep for 8hours, repeat. I feel more refreshed and feel like I accomplished more (even though I most certainly havent when playing a videogame).
---
I agree tbh. Go hybrid if you want, but don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be the one doing dmg. You‚Äôll be a healer/support.
---
1)Engage from max range so that priest can't hit you with any of his spells.
---
2)Cast Viper Sting.
---
3)Keep hovering around max range and recasting Viper Sting once it runs out.
---
4)Win literally every hunter vs priest fight.
---
Yeah I just told you my personal preferences, read between the lines. 
---
You could also stand in a toilet bowl.
---
Neither action will yield a result. But it‚Äôs your time, and you‚Äôll be the one with wet socks, so....your call.
---
Yeah that's pretty much the biggest fear right now, picking a streamer server or one that ends up very small.
---
Shoot and run. You should have 41 range compared to his 30. Keep pet on him to prevent drinking. You can also use FD to "interrupt" his casting, but it wont work  on DOTS
---
If anything, play a few chars to 20-30 to get quest routes down imo
---
Or if you‚Äôre dead set on one faction play the other one just to see life from their point of view. It also makes you appreciate your faction more when you finally go back 
---
Cant link rn but it was talked about at blizzcon its the current plan.
---
That looks pretty fucking scammy to me.
---
That's to some degree thematically fitting though. Humans thrive to the most prosperous of lands. The Undead took over some of those lands but well, they are undead so they don't really take that much care of the land. The Tauren do take great care of their land and arguably their starting zones is one of the more beautiful ones, despite the invasion of those swines (forgot the name :D). The Orks and Trolls basically are outcasts who make due with what they got without actively raising conflict.
---
So yes, you are right, this is the way it is. BUT: it fits the overall theme and "hierarchy" of things lore wise.
---
Pallies are A tier healers in PvE and S tier in PvP. 
---
Incredibly mana efficient and easy to play, most likely only skilled priests can beat them in short duration fights in terms of healing output.
---
That is the thing with the "pro changes" argument. It all sounds great in *theory*, until you realize who will push that change and who will execute it.
---
Imagine a developmental house that actively dislikes Vanilla as a game, and sees the entire desire to play it, as some sort of insult to their work for the past 10+ years, taking a scalpel and making changes to this game? Add in the pressure from current Retail players, who are more concerned with collecting mounts and transmog sets than the game itself and you can see where this is all going.
---
You cannot want Classic, and want changes. Because the changes implemented are the reason you want Classic in the first place. Classic is just that, a *unchaged* game.
---
We are here, waiting for a 2004 game to come out, because disastrous changes were made by developers who to this day can look into a camera and legit believe they are doing right by the game.
---
Stealth is a massive advantage for new players (druid or rogue) which just gives them freedom to explore.
---
Rogues have a slightly higher skill floor, but druids are gear independent and more forgiving on mistakes, they both have a relatively high skill ceiling.
---
If OP preferred melee over a caster, I would recommend either a rogue or druid, if a caster, mage or warlock.
---
This is really accurate, where dem spiders at.
---
I don't think so. My favorite starting zones were always Durotar and Mulgore. I'm going to play Alliance, but if there is one thing I'm will miss about horde, it's the zones. 
---
 Where is the confirmation that Classic will start out with DM open? Can you link a blue post or info that came from Blizzard? 
---
Mostly BM, even with bestial wrath he could absorb all my damage while focusing all of his damage on me, ignoring my pet completely. Like I said, I'm not the best player and my gear isn't great, but I'm still not sure why are hunters supposed to be that good.
---
Overall I find mage to be more fun to play and that's what I'm most likely going to play during Classic.
---
This comment made me so happy, because it was my exact thought too and I also thought it might just be me. Hello stranger, you gave me a big smile, thank you!
---
Probably the Warcraft III Reforged beta.
---
Wouldnt it be smart to just open one pvp and one pve realm, until its richly populated on both factions and only then open more?
---
I guess it would be possible with the cloud tech.
---
As far as I know, Classic Games is responsible for Warcraft III Reforged and not WoW Classic.
---
Warlocks are awesome for wPvP. I did several 1vNs and even recorded a video back in the day.
---
I had a blast but I don't want to play the same class again, so this time I'm rolling a hunter or a mage, still not decided. But both have the potential to 1vN as well.
---
My assumption is that Blizz will inevitably open far too many servers at the outset, and the majority of them will die, and then server transfers will be made available.
---
I'm just hoping the server I roll on stays active "enough" to get into at least MC before being forced to pay for a transfer, but server population is definitely my biggest concern for the health of Classic.
---
Resisting 1/4 of every stun comming your way is not overrated at all.
---
It's the best PvP racial in vanilla, no doubts about it. If your class can be Orc, you should be an Orc if you want to min-max PvP.
---
Honestly shitty quest layout doesn't bother me at all. I fully expect to take at least a dozen days /played to get to 60 just like I did in Vanilla. Hitting alt tab while auto walking all the way to the other side of the zone is just part of the vanilla experience.
---
In Vanilla, I was awestruck when I found this tunnel in southern Ashenvale on my dwarf hunter, went through it and found this entirely new, secluded mountain range. Literally the first mob I killed when I entered the zone dropped a nice blue quality cloak with a bit of fire resistance on it, I was a happy player then. 
---
Skinning and leatherworking are really good and if youre into PvP Engineering can be superb aswell at max lvl.
---
Engineering in vanilla also adds some benefitial items in some PvE encounters too but again.. LW/Skinn is probably most recommended and smooth :) 
---
&gt; Hunters can kite you into oblivion, if you don't know how to deadzone. If you do, they're free kills.
---
Even with the deadzone, you still need to go trought the 15-50 yards zone until you reach it.
---
Not that difficult depending on class. Charge/Intercept, Sprint, Root them, CC in general to get to them etc. Obviously they can counter and get away too, but once you're there it's difficult, especially if you Frost Reflect the trap.
---
&gt; Wouldnt it be smart to just open one pvp and one pve realm
---
Good idea, about 2 million players per realm
---
The only thing that comes to mind is that Horde players would create low level alts with an insulting nick like "Alliaregay" and essentially park the corpse on top of the IF mailbox. Everytime youd wanna click the mailbox, youd read "Allirgay".
---
Female human ret paladin it'll be.
---
I love swinging huge 2H weapons while wearing heavy plate armor. I really don't give a shit about people telling me to roll a warrior then or that ret sucks in general. With enough effort you can make ret work, and I'm always about those "take something bad and make it work". Could never roll those "top classes" like warri, mage or rogue. Way too boring, half of the server will be one of those 3 classes and I want to stand out on my server. 
---
Yeah just rip my sentence i half and out of context...really smart :D
---
Main goal for classic is to be competitive in PvP, but I do not have the time to reach r13/14, and I think it's realistic that I won't be clearing too much of naxx. 
---
Which classes are strong or reach near PvP BIS without r13/14 or naxx gear?
---
Probably because dust and sand just look shitty in a 2005 Game Engine.
---
IIRC they finished the alliance side of things first and spent more time on their quests and zones.
---
In most cases the hunter can do something about it.
---
Charge/Intercept. Ok, you are a warrior, and wing clip's slow is stronger than yours. Also, if you are deadzoning me, I'm also deadzoning you.
---
I think the only ones that can beat the hunter while deadzoning him are Warlocks and Priests, because you can tank/CC the pet, and slowly drain his life with DoTs while you deadzone him. For the other classes you are either melee (so you are also "being deadzoned" or you have to stand still to cast and I can use that window to gain a couple yards.
---
I see your Stonetalon Mountains, and I raise you an Arathi Highlands.
---
https://imgur.com/pftIaeM
---
I don't want to argue about it, obviously if you don't like it then you don't like it. ;)
---
I do like that things are not streamlined and you need to run around to finish quests. Here and elsewhere in Vanilla. It's subjective.
---
Continent wise, Eastern Kingdoms might be more visually pleasing, but Kalimdor overall is a more interesting continent to traverse.
---
Eastern Kingdoms are more established. Everything feels more bland, because so many areas look LOTR inspired and adhere to fantasy tropes. There is nothing wrong with any of that, but its a tad on the dull zone. No zone really captures my imagination bar for STV, Duskwood and Tirisfal Glades (which is a Horde zone).
---
Kalimdor feels like a continent that is up for grabs for anyone, the various sub races feel more threatening, the zones are more wild and alien. South of Barrens, you really get the sense that Quilboar are in control and the area feels legitimately dangerous. Winterspring feels like a zone few have dared traverse to. Ungoro is alien, and the gates to Uldum spark all sorts of imagery. Nothing on Kalimdor looks bland, or adhering to some sort of fantasy trope, its truly *Warcraft* in that it is unique to this universe.
---
To me, EK is "le fantasy xD", while Kalimdor is truly Warcraft.
---
Right, but you can use it as, say a Rogue or Warrior to get out of combat (by CCing the pet of course), and charge or re-stealth, or simply let bleeds to their work. It's mostly a caster thing I agree though.
---
Drinking while your pet hits something didn't work in vanilla. This is because in vanilla your pet attacking or being damaged immediately put you in combat which stopped drinking.
---
It works on private realms as your pet attacking doesn't put you in combat.
---
When?
---
I want to be wildly overpowered, and deserve to be if I can clear Naxx enough times to make a set.
---
Have an uppvote
---
Thanks 
---
Except forsaken zones, yes.
---
lol Blizzcon?  They've made a thousand changes since then and still have tons more to make.  Blizzcon was "this is what we might do and have ideas about".  Nothing said at Blizzcon can be confirmed as final.  
---
It just wouldn‚Äôt be a true classic experience without rampant phishing and key logging attempts.
---
Tirisfal Glades is one of most atmospheric zones. It's Horde.
---
Aesthetic is very subjective. Just enjoy whatever you enjoy in the game. ;)
---
Hence why i said its current plan.
---
His statement had nothing to do with the second half of yours. All he was commenting on was that there would be an obscene amount of people day 1. And he is right.
---
Then go play retail!
---
End-game rogue is one of the top DPS and one of the best PvP classes. I have played a full T3 rogue with BiS gear and MSA/Thunderfury, you kill anything in one stunlock. The only issues you will face, implying that you are using engineering like anyone who gives a damn about pvp, are geared soullink warlocks and skilled mages with tidal/skull/helmet. I would say it is the best 1v1 class along with mages and shadow priests. Even in BGs where people usually say that rogues suck, you can be a nightmare if played correctly (vanish cs drop flag repick, blind/helmet, with those tricks you can escape up to 4 enemies trying to get the wsg flag from you).  I recommend checking out "perplexity vanilla rogue" and "roope vanilla rogue" on youtube to see a rogue at full potential. I have played years of vanilla and in my opinion rogues and mages are the classes which never get boring due to their skillcap and skillshots.
---
Hunters can do it too. Using freight dead and waiting the channeling bar to deplete would actually kill them. 
---
Well, it's one of three things. Warcraft Remastered, Classic WoW or... nothing.
---
Here's to hoping!
---
but worth it?
---
I was under the impression that there are no Dwarf women. Dwarves just spring up out of the ground. So how does this tinder work?

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aujexc/looking_for_group_monday_february_25_2019/

not me but it directly impacted me and it was a big time idiot moment.  My older brother (maybe 12 at the time) hit 40 on his night elf hunter (lol) and fell for a scam by a dude who whispered him and promised he'd help him buy his mount if he gave him his account information. My dumb bro fell for it and the dude then proceeded to steal our gold on every character and even vendor our gear for money.
---
I had a lvl 19 druid at the time and felt crushed (as an 11 y/o it took a long time to get to 19...).  I couldnt kill any mob w/o gear so I deleted it and rerolled.  
---
still feel it to this day 
---
If it existed anywhere beyond lvl10 zones then i would be against it. But we dont know yet.
---
LIAR
---
I'm avoiding being forced to human race by playing dagger rogue :p every guild needs someone to pick up those perdition's blade/death's sting drops! Plus I think it fits the 'theme' of rogues better to be using daggers.
---
Uh warriors do more than just tank bud
---
They are not going with traditional servers because we wouldn't have sharding then...
---
They will probably open tons of clouds and collapse them, kinda like "real" servers dying but with having even more shitty caps :D.
---
I'm sure the scammers have their own clairvoyant, just so people don't get their hopes up in vain. They are indeed the good guys here. 
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more with this. I do not want my opinion influencing others either. I always loved Tirisifal Glades and the eerie music. 
---
Even the undercity... that city is so badass and I love the music there too
---
I think there will be free transfers in the near future as I expect that the population will drop significantly few weeks after launch as some "tourists" will abandon their characters.
---
Yea this is what im most interested in finding out about too. Picking the right server will have everything to do with your experience of this game. Streamers will not be a problem however, they will be stuck to PVE servers. I  would LOVE to see a popular streamer attempt to play on a PVP server LOL they would be camped into oblivion never getting anywhere.
---
Aren‚Äôt accurate, sure. Not even close to being accurate? That is just a straight up lie and disrespectful to the work many people have done on private servers.
---
Yeah, I saw perplexity videos. He is very entertaining. I see the potential but the downside is how much time it takes to get them to that point. I don't have as much time as I used to play a class and rogue feels like a very long journey. Perhaps that's the biggest deal breaker for me right now. 
---
Well I was thinking of getting Strenght enchants on everything that didn't have it.. i'm sure you can get Agil+Str items too not just Agil+Intel, just enough Intel to keep casting.. it would defo be fun to test but hard to do that
---
I am sure comparable documents exist for most classes and specs. However, I have only looked into the Mage class far.
---
Eh...skip improved Vampiric Embrace.  Those 2 talent points are a trap.
---
My turn to post this tomorrow lads
---
I was thinking that all that strenght wouldn't matter if you're just auto attacking but with constant vengeance you might see an increase.. you could still get agil+str gear, str enchants on agil+intel gear.. you just need enough intel to keep casting during a boss fight and agil to keep up vengeance so you can still get some str gear
---
It has because there wont be so many on one realm, another will open then.
---
If there are more servers on launch they will be overfilled too on day 1. 
---
With my mention atleast factions will me balanced.
---
Rogues are actually very overrated in 1.12 vanilla PvP, even in the window where all your CDs are up you don't simply get to kill anything in "one stunlock". 
---
They're decent and have likely the highest skill cap in the game, but if you don't have good gear or mess up one part of your rotation (or priest, orc and/or warr resisting stun) you're either going to have to pop all of your cooldowns and prep, or bail.
---
What is the best healer class for pvp? (I know healdins are good but i was planning on playing horde) and i plan on wpvp as well as bgs
---
I don‚Äôt know if a server could even support that amount of people at launch lol
---
Looking at the 1.1 Druid balance tree... I leveled as balance, meleeing enemies and hoping for Omen procs. Good god what a nub
---
Preach hit lvl 10 in 14 minutes on current retail with heirlooms and XP boosts, and compared it to vanilla he hit lvl 10 in 3.5 hours.  See for yourself.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcMayHVG5RY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcMayHVG5RY)
---
If they arent looking to overpopulate early to save the under population later, much of this is going to come down to luck. Community will make the game but they have a chance to make community again compares to live. This is there chance to get it right. But its way harder than just FFA that we had at launch.
---
Ya he has great videos, I like the patch release videos he has been doing recently. 
---
Youtube is getting swarmed by these fucken drama clickbait channels in every dam section it's insane. 
---
I don't mind things that were pushed to TBC to be voted on. For example who wouldn't want Karazhan, which was originally planned for Vanilla anyway, to be content to include. I'd love to see what was being worked on for classic in terms of zones etc and then dropped when they decided to go the TBC route. The emerald dream, hyjal, I'm sure there's more but I'd love to get the chance for them to include it but let the small dev team in charge of classic work on it rather than retail. 
---
This girl I'm seeing is taller than me and she got a good laugh out of this :(
---
This is probably obvious to most, but what can paladins do that's so hard for warlocks to deal with. (That shamans can't do.)
---
It's true. I tried getting my girlfriend to play horde but she absolutely hates the Barrens and horde cities and architecture in general
---
Pros
---
- solid raid dps
---
- great in 1v1 pvp
---
- great in world pvp
---
Cons
---
- LONG cooldowns 5-10 minutes 
---
- weak group pvp
---
- fill only a niche role in battlegrounds/premades. Many find them boring to play in BGs 
---
Cooldowns are seriously brutal. Rogue can take almost anything 1v1 but having to wait 5-10 minutes for vanish or blind or sprint can be super annoying. 
---
Definitely not for everyone, but they‚Äôre fun if you understand their niche
---
My problem with transferring is that my character name is already taken on the server I'm transferring to.
---
Same honestly
---
A dozen? You will still be ahead of the majority most likely.
---
I've leveled 2 rogues to 60 on private servers, cleared all content and also got r14 in one of my accounts, people who are stuck in the "roguecraft" are going in for a huge awakening.
---
If you don't have a group and wanna play solo, expect to face A LOT of competition (even more if you plan to play on horde side cuz undeads) for dungeon spots and raid spots, Pre-Bis farm is a fucking nightmare as a rogue.
---
Rogues have a lot of counters on vanilla, its easy to kill mediocre players but if you face someone who knows what they are doing, you're screwed.
---
They kinda suck on group pvp, if you manage to get on a premade for bgs all you gonna do is guard flags most of the time, they are too reliant on cooldown aswell which is annoying when you play it for a long time, also for PvE the bosses arent that melee-friendly, you need knowledge to not be dead all the time, and you are expected to top DPS meters, so you'll need to put extra effort on that.
---
For gold making you can pickpocket which is very cool and comfy imo (if classic dont screw up and make pickpocket resist high, you'll be able to make a lot of gold inside BRD).
---
After a while playing with rogue it can be boring cuz the rotation on PvE isnt that interesting, well its better than spamming Frostbolt or Shadowbolt, but still.
---
Can someone on NA ask Bornakk when they are going to announce that they are removing loot trading and automated bans and just let us put people on ignore?
---
Druids are one of the best classes for solo defending flags, but in almost all situations except a 1vX they are worst class, and how often is someone going to be solo defending a flag in AB with 14 other players on the team? For capping bases it would be much better to pair a second CC DPS class with the rogue since they can kill very quickly until the survivors can be CC'd while they cap. Blitz the base before the rez wave or other support arrives.
---
Looks sketchy......... Not very professional looking lol
---
It's not very often I see something about this game I didn't know. Excellent post. 
---
Ill wont play on Midnight, wait till after work, and Pick a full server after that hoping its not a streamer server
---
Really? My /played was about 12 maybe 14 days to get my first character to max and that was with a shit ton of wasted time in Orgrimmar trying to get a LBRS group for Warlord's Command. Felt like I was extremely slow and casual about it. Guess that just shows the monumental scope of the original game and how getting to max level was truly an achievement.
---
It doesn't happen until "later" on private servers.
---
Classic is 1.12 right from the gate, so he starts nerfed.
---
What do you mean with 'streamer server'? 
---
we are starting with 1.12.1, so when Lupos was nerfed prior to that he will be nerferd at launch.
---
The only porgression we are getting is content unlocks, we wont go through patches
---
I honestly think you will still get it done before most. Some people will take it very easy and many will not make it. I guess we will find out when it's finally released.
---
He should‚Äôve never been unnerfed on any pserver. Hunters never had 1.12 talents with broken lupos. So the only way to actually have blitz like would be either unnerfed lupos with crap hunter talents or nerfed lupos with redone hunter talents.
---
This isn't Vanilla!
---
According to John Staats the Human questing hubs were the first that they designed, and it shows. Westfall and Duskwood in particular are pretty bad compared to what Horde gets from 10-30.  
---
According to Staats, Chris Metzen was the only guy on the team who was rooting for team Alliance and him championing the cause of Paladins for ages. Metzen was the one who brought up that the Alliance questing experience was pretty underdeveloped compared to Horde's quests.
---
Well for one they dont mention the cataclysm or deathwing. They have their quests stuck in their time periods whereas azeroth quests got updated.
---
I was RDruid in TBC. I ran both comps too. And I'm proud of it!
---
streamers will only be on pve servers
---
#This is a scam. Do not click these links. 
---
If you already did, change your passwords, and put an authenticator on your account if you haven't already.
---
We just need your info here and....thanks.
---
I imagine most private server devs (including myself) will take time off to play classic.
---
I'm confused with the draw to him.  He either reacts to content others have made, where we watch him watching a video, or he just reads things out while his chat goes scrolling passed at light speed.  I just don't get it.
---
It's 100% a scam. It really saddens me that people still fall for these very obvious kinds.
---
&gt; the main tanking class
---
What the hell is 'lupos'? 
---
Some action bar addons had the option to hide modifier text so that you could see the icons more clearly.
---
That's what I am feeling like it will be a very lengthy and time consuming journey with marginal benefit. Whereas, on priest or even mage I can have a relatively easier experience. My time commitment is also limited so perhaps I would just stick to priest or try mage/lock for dps.
---
What do you mean crap talents? Pretty sure pservers got hunter talents correct, the only issue was lupos
---
A rare wolf in Duskwood. A very popular pet on private servers because he dealt shadow damage instead of physical in earlier patches, effectively making him deal more damage due to the lack of armor reduction.
---
\#divesdidnothingwrong
---
Gotcha. So he‚Äôs basically a regular wolf in classic
---
I've learned so much from madseason. He consistently gets 1 thing wrong though: he's confused on which faction is the inferior one. :P
---
"very obvious kinds" üòÇüòÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Thanks! 
---
They didn't fire people that are responsible for game development, unlikely.
---
Played all the way to around level 20 on my first character (nelf rogue) without ever learning new abilities. 
---
I died a whole fucking lot. 
---
If content creators are sea gulls and the viewers are their young, what is asmongold in this analogy?
---
As a mage you are more desired because you have a lot of CC, you bring food/water for your groups and its far more easy on raid encounters since you are ranged, you have TP, you also farm gold more easily. And amazing on group pvp/solo pvp, you'll have a hard time against locks tbh.
---
That is vanilla.
---
no minimap watch, vanilla menu bar, no levelbar at lvl60.
---
Very good in both pvp and pve, pretty easy to learn with an extremely high skill cap. You can be as good as you want to essentially. 
---
Sorry to hear you don't think so, but it is extremely obvious for a multitude of reasons. Want me to list them for you so that you can spot them easier in the future?
---
Oh my, yes.
---
I remember camping the border of Stonetalon Mountains and the Barrens on a 20-24 Alliance Rogue. I wasn't twinked out either. I was just being an asshole Rogue. I did the same thing in Redridge Mountains on a Horde Rogue alt on a different server since I didn't want to buy a second account.
---
Both continents have interesting biomes. You might say there are more open spaces in Kalimdor and more tightly bound hills and paths in EK.
---
Beyond aesthetics there is a key difference between the two continents though. 
---
EK has a lot of established history - there are old forts and towns and the stories are about that. The Stormwind Masons, Lordaeron, etc. There is the presence of the traditional villains, demons and undead. 
---
Kalimdor is an unexplored wilderness and has the natural mysteries of Azeroth - titan weather in Un'goro, the Old Gods in Silithus. Stories about how the world is and why like in the Barrens as well. To me that is the most significant divide. 
---
Undead zones are aesthetically one of the best. Mulgore is very cozy greenland. troll subzones are a saturated jungle.
---
Only orcs zones are.. barren? but thats on purpose, to highlight that barren steppe aspect. and more brutal instead of beautiful. Only three horde zones are in that simlar barren style: Durotar, Barrens, Thousand needles. thats about it.
---
alliance got redrige mountains which are in a similar barren reddish style.
---
So probably overall you can say alliance got more appealing zones, but i wouldnt say its the case for all horde zones.
---
I dont understand all of the downvoting here. What he says is definitely possible considering the retail client/server structure being used. 
---
Of course we all hope this doesnt happen but any of my friends that I talk to classic about have the same exact worries. 
---
Yes its speculation, and we could be worried about nothing, but Blizzards track record isn't the greatest these days so that leads to the negative speculation. 
---
If it's anything like original vanilla, the game will launch with only 5 RP realms, I plan on following the RP community purely because their servers never die, and RP servers still remain some of the most active servers in the game to date.
---
Me and my roommate both had a warlock and a druid and then I had the warrior. So I've played all three in 2v2 at some point in TBC. Was hilarious honestly lol. S2 and S3 gladiators on a cheap comp lolol
---
Holy paladin is the best healer class for non premade PvP. Priest is also very good and can be more impactful than holy paladin when left alone (rare), but relies far more heavily on being supported by the rest of their team. If you really want to play horde then I recommend priest.
---
Holy paladin also the most healer feeling of all the healer classes in that all its best tools are heals and defensive support abilities that protect your allies and allow them to do what they do best. Priests heal most of the time but also mix in aggressive support like purging buffs, mana burning, mind controlling and throwing people off cliffs, and tossing a shadow word pain here and there. Resto shamans are poor healers and it's much better to be an ele/resto hybrid that mostly does DPS. Druids are easily the worst healers in PvP.
---
Back when leveling actually meant something, I would sell my account when I was getting bored of the game and then start over.
---
of course, I now regret this years down the road lol, because I would love to have my original character.
---
From what I understand, the people laid off were in non-development roles (at least they weren't directly development staff. You could argue that QA and other "non-development" staff do indeed have a hand in development.) I think they are actually hiring more developers.
---
We are presumed to get 16 debuff slots so DOT classes are less of an issue than with 8.
---
Rogues don't even need gear. 
---
I killed him on my warlock and I didn‚Äôt even feel bad about it. 
---
Because some people play with friends. I don‚Äôt but some people do.

As information comes in regarding the more nuanced questions surrounding the game (e.g. reverting from 16 to 8 debuffs at launch, dungeon loot itemization/tables, splitting Dire Maul / ZG into separate phases etc), we'll be updating our internal resources and plans accordingly. We'll be fully prepared for launch, join now!

---
When I try to play horde I need sunglasses. Or adjust the red-balance on my monitor.  Fucking Durotar legit hurts my eyes. 
---
Thats what they SHOULD do. I'm fairly convinced that they won't, though. They'll use the guise of "authentic experience" as an excuse, but I see server transfers as the only way Activision is going to fit MTX into Classic without huge backlash, so I am not going to be surprised at all when they promote policies that force paid transfers rather than good server population management.
---
I would enjoy some minor class rebalancing - maybe moving the classes closer to how they were in BC.
---
The reason I like BC balance is that every spec, for every class, was viable in PvP
---
It really shows with all the quest items that arent really quest items, but i think the infrastructure and detail were better in the human zones.
---
Just recently hiked that, looks like that for sure.
---
I'm pretty sure it will be easy for players to find the "better" realms thanks to reddit and other forums. But I still hope that Blizzard will announce realms when they announce the release date, that would be optimal for everyone.
---
I think they do. That's how they explain the Twilight clan or the Forsaken for example, as well as the geographical change.
---
That is why I assumed that the cataclysm events in the early zones are triggered by the cataclysm (in particul the wrath of the death wing) and after the TBC and the WOTLK expansions you would in fact face the death wing and the mobs introduced in the latest levels in the Cataclysm exp. 
---
Very good overview. I'll elaborate a bit on some reasons why rogues are strong in 1v1s but weak in group PvP. 
---
Rogues benefit a lot from being able to stall fights out to pool energy and drop combat for restealths so they can use a powerful opening ability again. In group PvP stalling is usually not a good idea and opportunities to restealth are rare.
---
Also most other classes get to make better use of their abilities in group PvP, while rogues are the opposite and are actually less able to use their abilities effectively in group PvP. For example mages and warlocks can cycle their polymorphs/fears on different targets to always keep them up on someone assuming none of the nearby enemies is a defensive dispeller, healer classes can do what they best and heal/support their allies, warriors can be supported by a healer and cripple the output of enemy healers, etc.
---
Yeah whats your point? Just because they are the main tanking class doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt do other things lmao. And to imply that just because they are the main tanking class new players shouldn‚Äôt play them is absurd.
---
you could thematically fit a raid in stonetalon peak considering there's an entire orc campaign level dedicated to it with medivh as the goal.  could have been incorporated into the making of atiesh.

Verified the email is the exact same address as previous emails from blizzard which I can confirm are legitimate. Is there a way scammers can mask their email to fit the exact criteria?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19961
---
Hybrid build Solo PvP is where its at. You will be very versatile and be able to get the flag in WSG. 
---
Druid DPS is probably the worst PvE damage unfortunately. 
---
I didn't say new players shouldn't play them?
---
I really hope they understand this but I'm afraid they will find a way to ruin it. Even something like instancing zones or adding the group finder will completely ruin the game by killing the server community
---
Tell him pics or it didn't happen.
---
Recently ended 2 long-term relationships, I will give this app a try!
---
Talents for all classes changed quite a bit over the course of vanilla's lifespan, with most classes receiving major overhauls with different patches. What he was referring to is the fact that 1.12 hunters were different talent-wise than 1.9 hunters, which was the patch that nerfed Lupos. Pretty much every class was significantly stronger in 1.12 than in previous patches, which makes hunters with pre-nerf Lupos stronger than any of their actual iterations during live vanilla had been.
---
They did the monster math?
---
I miss that stupid chain of bots.
---
They won't charge people for server transfers if a server is dying or has population issues.  They didn't back when this originally happened, they won't now.  
---
I understand some people have some trepidation regarding "Activision" managing Blizzard now, but for christ sake...cmon people.  Use a little logic and reasoning every now and then.
---
Yo I'll pay you $100 for your beta access when it comes out
---
I was under the impression that they will be integrating the new [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) communication structure into Classic WoW.  With that in mind wouldn't that mean that the naming convention/name taking will no longer be an issue?
---
yep.
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
You'll make the private server fanatics upset!
---
Huh.  I never thought about that but you bring up a good point.  I'm primarily a PvE player myself, but the fact that MOST streamers will be forced to roll on a PvE server actually has me considering a PvP server just to avoid them and their "fan-base" (aka rabid dogs).
---
I don't mind guarding flags, tbh.

 **&lt;Knights Templar&gt; - Alliance |NA ‚Äì PvE| Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Introduction**:
---
Knights  Templar roots were established during World of Warcraft‚Äôs launch on the  Zul‚Äôjin |US - PvE| server.  Our guilds mantra was ‚ÄúThe causal guild  that raids hardcore‚Äù and we will continue with that mantra during  Classic WoW.  We accomplish this by having a very casual guild  environment, but a very focused and dedicated raid environment.  We  expect to progress through raid tiers in quick order.
---
**What we Expect of Members**:
---
We  are looking for members who share the same mantra that was referenced  above.  All members are expected to be respectful and polite when  dealing with other members of the community.  It‚Äôs important to remember  that when you join our guild, you represent us at all times.
---
For  raid members, you will be expected to show up to raids on time and  prepared to pull by raid start time.  We also expect raid members to be  well read in our raid strategies and able to follow the raid leaders  instructions.
---
**Guild Culture:**
---
We  want this guild to feel like home, as it did for the members who were part of the original KT guild!  We are committed to building a guild  environment that is friendly and helpful and is respected throughout our  server.
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday 8:00 -10:30 PM EST.  Sundays will drop off when content is on farm or turned into 20 man raiding days.
---
**Guild Website:**
---
[https://www.ktguild.com/](https://www.ktguild.com/)
---
**Discord**:
---
[https://discord.gg/Se55Scg](https://discord.gg/Se55Scg)
---
**Recruitment**:
---
We currently have a healthy roster but still need more raiders to fill in.  We don't expect everyone to make it to launch or even to 60 so even though every class is low, you may still get a raiding spot.   If you are interested in joining feel free to join our discord channel (invite above) or message Papacy#2992 or Drobu#2181 on discord with any questions.

14 more years.

Keep yer feet on the ground. 
---
It boiled down to BM hunters (strong late game talents) paired with OP pre-nerf Lupos (early patch version) were absurdly OP, especially when leveling to the point where even a level 50 Lupos with Betial wrath could readily 1v1 any melee.
---
The most recent "popular" private sever has this issue where Lupos was getitng 600-800 damage auto attacks on warriors with bestial wrath.  It was out of hand where half the Alliance players (and a large chunk of horde players, too) were BM Lupos Hunters steam rolling players in Wpvp.
---
Please use the weekly LFG sticky posts. Thank you!
---
Ah i could be wrong then. I barely played cata.
---
I wish we had more info on when/where the video was captured. I looked through every polearm model and did not see this polearm. Your beta idea seems likely but I couldn't find any item lists from the beta.
---
Question, would you throw it all away if considering blizzard.. sorry hacktivision totally fucks classic wow? 
---
Balnazzar April '05. Aside from people trolling in chat, most people called Deadmines "DM". *Usually* anyone calling it "VC" was doing so to try and make "lowbies" look stupid and they mostly got ignored.
---
I'd appreciate a "Old School" server but that would be IN ADDITION to Vanilla servers.
---
Like Blizz said, they want to recreate their original game for history, but if they want to expand on that and try their own "expansion" set afterward I'd be up for that!
---
I usually play with melee characters and sometimes mages. 
---
Alliance has more political (talk to / deliver) quests while Horde has more exterminate-the-local-fauna kind of quests (kill / kill / collect bodyparts / kill). Also there are more hubs of Alliance-friendly NPCs (i e Durotar and Stormgarde) in Azeroth than there are hubs of Horde-friendly hubs (Most notably orc labour in Arathi Highlands).
---
Alliance was more thoroughly completed while Horde was rushed. Yet, I enjoy Horde more.
---
Yes, big fan of Tirisfal Glades and Silverpine Forest. The dark gothic look is so cozy! Being a skeleton is pretty cool too.
---
I'll remember you saying that when you try to go through one of our zones.
---
Druids are what you are thinking of. Incredibly weak healing and their HoTs always get sniped by a different healer anyway. Paladins can spam 900+ heals every 1.5 seconds for like 70 mana each in raids and most content take 5+ for full range of buffs. Priest is better in AoE capacity, but that's about it. Paladins regularly topped the heal charts on most boss fights in my guild.
---
Which spec of a mage should I go for? And I‚Äôm not too sure. I will be starting with my friend so most likely groups. 
---
Uh, no. 
---
No. I love WoW but in my humble opinion the game isn‚Äôt worth the $15/month as it is. It‚Äôs an old game that should be free at this point. I‚Äôll pay the $15 but I wouldn‚Äôt be cool with a price increase.
---
If I find myself and the group I'm leading in on a lower population server, even better.
---
Less competition for resources, easier to attack alliance towns (horde are always outnumbered), slightly less competition on pvp rank grinding in stage 2, etc.
---
Plenty of opportunity and silver lining on a "medium" population server, but I seriously doubt any day 1 pvp servers will be low pop. 
---
Even then, I wouldn't mind having battle groups for servers so BG's are running 24/7
---
Uh no I'm not lying in the slightest. Truthfully i dont associate with those boneheaded idiots
---
No.
---
I have no interest in retail.
---
Besides that they have monetised wow out of the whazoo; and i doubt they will not do the same whit Classic (eventually).
---
I am actually afraid of giving Activision any more money; they‚Äôll make so much they‚Äôll have to fire people, again.
---
What I see happening is them introducing "seasons" which means making fresh servers after 2 years or so while keeping the old ones for people to mess around with (and maybe progress them onto tbc or allow the option). People like a chance at a fresh start.
---
T H I C C
---
They said they will release cotent over time so probably 2-3 years. That‚Äôs how it lasted originally.
---
&gt; Imagine a developmental house that actively dislikes Vanilla as a game, and sees the entire desire to play it, as some sort of insult to their work for the past 10+ years, taking a scalpel and making changes to this game? 
---
Great point. It's in the nature of leadership changes. Most younger people do not understand how fickle a corporation's priorities are, or how malleable they are. It's based on leadership. I've lived long enough to have seen many projects across many industries changed or cancelled simply because of a change in leadership. I've learned that companies do not have creative priorities; their leaders have creative priorities. Those priorities can shift completely in a one year span of time. The employees who worked under the previous regime can be terminated and new people who follow the new ideals will come in to replace them. 
---
I always encourage anybody skeptical about this to read about "Tone at the top". Pretty much the only thing that matters is what the leadership at the top desire because their priorities trickle down one way or another, often by replacing middle management who then push new priorities on current staff or hire new staff to implement.
---
We might see a MAJOR exception to this rule if the Classic team is, in fact, as isolated and independent as some insiders have claimed. I think it's more likely that the tone of ActiBlizzard is going to infect the project so aggressively that it will be DOA. 
---
Well no.
---
Even on Vanilla Day 1 before it was massively popular (less than 200k subscribers) there were about 30 servers and each one was flooded with log in queues.
---
Hence Jay Allen Brack's comments about "Not wanting to re live through day 1 launch of vanilla".  They were constantly adding in new servers to meet demand.
---
There are a couple strategies they can do to alleviate this, such as temporarily increasing the server player cap so people who are not going to stick around can still play without servers depleting population and such.
---
You simply have no idea what you are talking about. I have played geared rogues on several pservers and your statement "you don't simply get to kill anytjing in one stunlock" is just false. Rogue vs Rogue in BiS gear is all about who gets the opener as the rogue who gets caught literally cannot even get out a blind as he dies during the kidneyshot. Stop talking of things you obviously know nothing about.
---
Runescape 3 focused on the same cosmetic bullshit retail wow has now.
---
When osrs launched they had the same mentality as you, no changes because we want our old game back.
---
The game started to die in a year and they decided to make a poll. It worked.
---
It wasnt the runescape 3 players voting onn crap to make osrs like rs3, it was osrs players voting on minor things that made the game better for them
---
Conjure Water  
---
I just bought D2 and had to log in the old b-net when I got this email, so I thought it's legit. Damn
---
Both in vanilla and on private servers. Your point of being in combat stopping drinking isn't true at all. Watch some videos of Joana's word record speed run back in the day and you'll see.
---
Classic WoW is directly tied to retail WoW thanks to the shared subscription, so financially it will never go away. Or at least until retail WoW dies.
---
In terms of high population maybe 5-6 months post-Naxx is when we will see a sharp decline of players. The min-maxer will quit pretty fast when the content is beat and there's nothing more on the horizon for classic WoW, the veterans that plays a lot regardless will probably stick around until the end and casuals will quit/rejoin all the time.
---
There will be an obvious drop-off of players post-Naxx but since it's a museum piece of Blizzard they will just keep it around and let players go back and play it however they like. So realistically until retail WoW dies.
---
I cringe with how accurate this is.
---
How old do you think that dude is in the photo? 
---
Perplexity is wearing like prebis and entry raid gear in half his clips
---
Barrens are rough.  It‚Äôs a shame so much time is spent there because it defines the whole continent for some people.
---
There are some amazing terrains and diversity in Kalimdor.
---
If you don't have enough time you will quite unlikely see endgame anyway. No guild will recruit someone for AQ40/Naxx who cannot invest time farming for pots.
---
Who cares about retail dude. All we want is classic.
---
I like this idea, won't be for everyone but it's a way to keep it kinda fresh 
---
Retail aint it chief. That game doesnt have class variety. You only have 3 roles. Tank healer and dps. Plus its filled to the brim with dead content. Badass locations like Molten Core? Nobody cares. 
---
Forever, basically.
---
You can do all raids. 2-3 years at least. You can do that on the other side. Another 2-3 years. You can do that an *all* classes and deck all of them out in bis gear. At *least* multiply that two years by eight, so 16 years. If you can speedrun the game (which in itself can last you a lifetime). You can PvP. ;)
---
Why do you care it'll go "stale"? Why do you want it to play it "forever"? And especially why do you care if it'll "not be financially viable" for Blizzard? Are you a Blizzard accountant?
---
Just play it until you are no longer interested. Then stop playing. *Very* simple.
---
How long has there been a Vanilla Pserver population?  oh...since Vanilla?  ok then.
---
If they screw Classic up royally all of the pserver people will just go back to business as usual on their favorite pserver, and retail players will go back to retail anyway I'm sure lol.
---
So if Blizzard makes Classic true to Vanilla it will last for a long time.  But they're already hinting at changes that screw it all up right at launch, so I have a feeling they're going to screw it up like everything else.
---
that they aren't quite compatible with vanilla
---
Mizkif step in
---
I wouldn't be surprised by a late August or even September release. I would be a quite surprised, however, if they didn't do a Beta. It helps them find bugs/issues and they don't have the manpower to check everything. Assuming they push it back as far as they can (3rd week of September or so) they have almost **7 months** from now to conduct a beta if they want to. I don't want them to push the release back that far but if they need to for the sake of quality, I'm totally okay with it.

 **&lt;TBD&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**

We are a Horde based guild (working on a name, we are holding a March Madness style vote in Discord eventually), specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Possible raid Schedule:**
---
2 days a week (likely weeknights, possibly 1 weeknight and Sunday). The window for raids times would between 8PM EST and 1AM EST. This does not mean we would raid during this entire time, only that we have the possibility if members are willing to stay awake and push until 1AM EST.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
We will use some form of DKP or EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
If you're saying that because of the custom ability icons, it's possible to download icon packs for WoW. You can find loads of them on DeviantArt.
---
Are you RPing as a Blizzard marketer? Rebooting Classic probably takes less man hours for them than one new major patch on Retail. This is a pretty low cost way for them to massively bolster their subscribers number.
---
I'm not getting anything for free. Every expansion costs a lot of money+subscription to keep playing. Also, the subscription should give me 100% content but these greedy fucks lock one of the best looking mounts behind cash shop (I don't care about pets).
---
Weird. As someone that leveled a ton of horde through the Vanilla quest experience, and a single human/ally, I found the alliance questing experience to be much better. 
---
The Alliance questing experience actually has a meta theme. A number of your early quests involve ferrying messages between the leaders of cities near Stormwind. The contents of these messages are, essentially, and ongoing discussion between those leaders, about the lack of support from Stormwind. 
---
This is the impetus for the need for you, as an adventurer. The areas near Stormwind arent getting reinforced by Stormwind. So these towns and outposts need your help as a result.
---
As you dig into it, it turns out that the problems are generally due to the machinations of Katrina Prestor. Aka Ony. Who you eventually confront and force to flee the city, as part of your attunement questline, for Ony. 
---
The horde has nothing like that. The meta story for the horde is basically just ‚Äúthis place around us is hostile, we need to band together to survive.‚Äù It‚Äôs completely underdeveloped and disjointed. 
---
Really odd that you‚Äôd think otherwise. 
---
The horde has nothing like that. 
---
Yes, absolutely.
---
It‚Äôs odd that you‚Äôre inflating the value of a US dollar but not deflating the value of a 15-year-old game.
---
Balance? It's so bad you beg to ding 10 quickly...
---
That's an interesting approach, I never thought about it that way. But can you really compare it that easily? 
---
I for one love playing tanks in MOBA but I've never even dared tanking in WoW. 
---
I'm playing on private servers since WoD so it's about 4-5 years now. People were always interested to play + you got others who don't want to play on privates for various reasons. Right now the most popular private server has 6858 concurrent players around the world. So yeah, I'd say there's big enough crowd to keep classic alive both for the player and the company managing it.
---
&gt;I frequently see people claiming as fact that pirate server guilds will clear MC in greens in the first or second week of Classic's release. Now you can try to play a game where you make up your own definition of "easy" and use that definition to deliberately misinterpret me, but as far as I am concerned if people reliably do this in the first week it's easy.
---
That's also mostly the same few elite guilds/groups of elite raiders who have been running MC for the last ten years. Not something that most people would consider easy.
---
&gt;That seems to be the issue. It is not universally believed, as you seem to think, that pirate servers have got Rag's damage and how fire resist works right.
---
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQqHKJtzQbM)'s a video of the original Rag with a clear UI, solid video quality and a damage log in the lower right corner (includes damage separated into dealt and resisted ofc). I tried comparing the values to videos from *other* servers and didn't find any discrepancies, would you like to look into it and see whether you can find any?
---
I think seasons are cool, but two years feels like too long of a loop. Once they reset it the first time, it‚Äôd be interesting to see them manipulate things a bit ‚Äî like having more gear drop on raids to quicken the cycle.
---
Yes, the sun is up the whole day and night in northern parts of the world when WoW Classic is about to be released (summer 2019).
---
And I played a dwarf rogue in full T2 on LB, and while you can kill trash players in trash gear with one stunlock, realistically, any good mage, warrior or warlock has an arsenal to use against you before you can kill them.
---
Rogues are praised religiously on this sub yet it seems like no one has actually played a near maxed out rogue during late game on a server where AQ40 is out and later, where everyone is actually geared.
---
I am always playing alliance so it would be a dwarf priest and possibly a gnome mage then. 
---
But my dwarf rogue looks very cool in his gear thus far \^\^. I just don't see how I am going to find time commitment to get it to a point where it's going to be really viable and not be ditched by everyone.
---
The beta would be about finding bugs and issues, not changing game play. Sure they can test in house, but they will have a lot more feedback if they hold a beta. There will likely be unexpected bugs caused by shoving the old game into the new client. It isn't exactly an "already made game" as you suggest.
---
That was my feeling in WC3.
---
I couldnt wait to play Orcs story line again. And Kalimdor felt so amazingly undiscovered after years of war in Lordaeron (WC 1 &amp; 2), all the new enemies like centaurs. And with the night elf missions it blew my mind. Walking trees, irrwishes, awe..
---
WoW continued this, and for me Elwynn Forrest is the most boring zone. Orc zones are more dusty, not like the dense forrests of northern Kalimdor, but that fits the lore pretty well.
---
Duly noted. I didn't play from the jump, couple of friends got me to join a few months in. Playing on dial-up was brutal at times lol.
---
Imp blizzard is a 2 second slow. Come of cold slow lasts for 8 seconds. By limiting the slow to 50% instead of 65% you give yourself a lot more time to reposition. 
---
I'd like to think warlock, even over mage. 
---
I think mage can put out viable DPS the easiest.
---
But warlock doesn't have a that much more complicated roll in PvE either (contrary to hunters, who have quite the difficult rotation for relatively low damage output). You'll be in demand for summons and other utility stuff like soulstones. Warlock also has a very smooth leveling experience (almost as good as hunter).
---
They wouldn't be bringing it back unless their market research indicated that it would probably be profitable.
---
I did raid up-to AQ40 on my priest and life was quite good, even with time limitations. I don't see this happening on a rogue unfortunately from my current experience and what people wrote.
---
That would only make it more authentic! Like going back to the days where you rushed home from the store at midnight release from wow expansions and sat in ventrilo trying to get on asap. It will be glorious to finally get in to classic and have this mad rush of people trying to get to Barrens asap.
---
That is the point - they will try to squeeze more money from Classic, eventually. Would you rather pay an extra buck or two subscription, or do you not care that they introduce cash shops, tokens, etc?
---
I like it very much thus far, it's just the journey has so many obstacles and competition in comparison to my usual healing route. Although, I would really like to try dps in raid setting.
---
Oh no, sorry. I didn't explain very well. I like questing and try to never skip anything. So i always did the Quest before being able to find a grp for Scholo.
---
Mangos has been in development since 2005, so they had classic values on hand from the start. It's not perfect for sure but I don't think it's generally accepted that it's grossly inaccurate. 
---
nope. bwl xbow better
---
and the two hand polearms are crap with str on them.
---
and you dont want 1h for pvp
---
Let‚Äôs say a pack of mob reaches you after the first wave of blizzard. I normally would CoC then frost nova then reposition
---
In this case, 2/3 or 3/3 makes no difference right?
---
Even if you didn‚Äôt frost nova them, just CoC and reposition, why does it matter if you take 3/3?
---
In other words, no one has specifically described a negative impact of taking 3/3 other than vaguely implying it cancels out cone of cold, but it doesn‚Äôt make sense why that matters because by then you‚Äôd have the mob group caught in another blizzard chain
---
Can you give me a scenario where 2/3 is preferable?
---
Either way I would retaliate. On your first point because they openly promised Classic would be included in the already existing subscription fee and on your second point because with tokens it wouldn‚Äôt be Classic. They‚Äôre already on thin ice so doing either of those things would be a bad and shortsighted idea.
---
Nice find, I'm sure you're not the first one to figure that out but it's definitely not well-known in the community today.
---
Why does that matter since you‚Äôd usually frost nova them after anyway. And having 3/3 means you have a safer time chain blizzarding the mobs?
---
Maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding but no one in this thread has accurately described why 3/3 is actually detrimental. Can you give a specific scenario 
---
Yeah, you don't have to do both anymore, you get the "autoquest" to choose one at 58. Only reason to do both is if you want to see the whole story but it's not mandatory.
---
They also nerfed the XP so you'll get to 80 way before completing either one and the moment you get to 80 you get the quest to move on. Same happens with Cata/Mists 80-90.
---
It can be handy considering you have now 120 levels to go but from a storyline point of view it's a royal mess lol.
---
I don't know if Dives still plays.
---
What does cringe mean. People tell me all the time, i make them cringe when they look at my super cool drawings. Is it positive?
---
I'm right there with you, friend. Back during WotLK I used to grind heavily for ore and herbs, bought my epic flying mount and paid for a mount for a few of my buddies as well. I was always the guy with more cash than I knew what to do with.
---
ashenvale, gotta get the sawblades off the dock in bb
---
sharding üòÇüòÇ "joke ofc"
---
I'd agree for the most part. Ultimately, I don't like Barren/desolated/desert zones, and that dominates the Horde zones. I like green (or purple!), full of life, zones. 
---
I think 3-4 years before most people would get bored, assuming no TBC/seasons.
---
Ordered it today via amazon for 12 EUR :-)
---
Main reason was to keep myself hyped untill the release of classic.
---
I"m hoping that they release some additional l servers so that players can start over fresh after a year or two.
---
Huh that's pretty convenient nice
---
&gt;  how often is someone going to be solo defending a flag in AB with 14 other players on the team?
---
Pretty often the case for LM/GM/ST or Farm. I solo defended as a bear like 90% of the AB games I played.
---
&gt; For capping bases it would be much better to pair a second CC DPS class with the rogue since they can kill very quickly until the survivors can be CC'd while they cap.
---
Most of the time you only have 1 rogue in your premade (ideally), along with 1 druid. Both stealth classes. Sometimes it's better to send those 2 players to a singly/doubly guarded node to take it by surprise, then defend long enough for the rest of the team to make it over or not (sometimes you just want to cap and deny horde points for a few ticks) or turn it into a 2v6 when horde overreact opening your team to get a better node. You can see a mage coming from a mile away, and give your team plenty of notice.
---
I don't forsee them upping the subscription. I'd imagine the worst thing they'd do is do name change/server transfers and maybe  character recustomization. 
---
If they want more money, id suspect itd be eaiser to do progressive expansions, or try and entice people to check out retail.
---
Yes. I am terrified. Currently i am just hoping that some server names will be available about a month or so from launch so i know what server to avoid.
---
This actually explains a LOT of the scam emails I get. Good to know. Thanks.
---
How arr yae?
---
Id like to see this too. After one cycle id love to see thoughtful changes or additions to some classic servers.
---
Hope it's like vanilla ;)
---
no idea how it's on private servers but I feel it would be nice to have it like vanilla and less people on certain times.
---
do anyone remember if the daytime in-game followed the normal daytime for each region? if I remember correctly it did :/ but no sure.
---
but then, nothing happens. All you get is -0.1 sec to wrath.
---
You need to complete an extremely tough quest chain... still in Balance.
---
After you do that, you're already dark-souls-ready, and can continue leveling normally in balance. The only problem is...
---
limited water supply.
---
I kinda need a WoW zone to real life comparison album now.
---
They would do both.
---
We accept an increase now to sub price, like some sort of protection money scheme for them not to fuck up the game; then one year later they add the cash shop anyway. Gamers will be furious but will forget.
---
Activision is the worst when it comes to this. CEO Bobby Kotick was quoted to saying years ago that he would increase game prices to more than 60$ if it were up to him. Put that together with the fact that every Activision game has multiple editions, season passes, microtransactions and lootboxes (and sponsored deals) and you can see why i have little trust in them ever acting like they have enough money.
---
Hi, /u/FetTR
---
8/8 T2 and which weapons? Rogue vs Mage is 50/50 if both are equally geared and skilled. Warriors are completely doable if they are not orc or dwarf. Warlocks, if not Orc with stunresist, are easy. The only thing they can do is trinket out of kidney and deathcoil, which you can either vanish or reflect... Warlocks only become problematic once they got gear and sl.
---
Not sure what you mean about tauren not taking care of the land, they rival the night elves in terms of being nature centric and proactive in preservarion. It's part of their whole theme.
---
We know that private servers have been running classic versions of World of Warcraft for over a decade. Even still, look how excited the community is for Blizzard's official re-release. I think it's safe to say it will hold interest for quite a while. 
---
There is still a (very popular) private server running a classic version of the original EverQuest, which came out in 1999 and is primitive compared to WOW. There's always going to be someone wanting that oldschool experience.
---
what kind of display did you use? my guess would be a Sony GDM-FW900, since 24" LCDs were worth their weight in gold back then and were rare as fuck.
---
Yes this is similar to the way it's been done with EQ/EQ2. New servers every once in a while, some with regular unlocks of expansions and some perhaps not is about what I expect them to do. They could keep people interested for quite a while this way.
---
The one thing I don't see them doing is making new content for classic unfortunately, I think it's going to be more work than they want to do. I hope they prove me wrong but we all know they will save money/do less if they can get away with it.
---
I believe I saw somewhere that he died.
---
The xbow (and I think gun) is slow enough to be usable. Probably worse than bloodseeker, but usable.
---
The 1 handers are slightly better than zg gear though
---
He said they take care of their land and have a beautiful starting zone. 
---
Mage has much more room for error and it's far from 50/50. If mage is pom/pyro he will get steamrolled, but deep frost mages can ice block twice, blink and have ice barrier.
---
Orc locks just death coil, immolate and put other dots up and play time waiting for the insane damage to kill rogue (SL is insane because you have improved corruption either way).
---
As far as my rogue goes, I was 7/8 with Dragonfang and Hakkari warblade, which isn't the best in the world but very far from bad.
---
Are you saying you think they're better from a thematic standpoint? Because Horde just has *more* quests and an easier time getting to 60 by way of pure questing.
---
Which is my criteria.
---
I'm not sure, that's the reason why we have sharding in part. They are expecting tourists, they clearly addressed the problem many times in interviews. 
---
Ummm... yeah guy, it is.
---
I love Tolkien-esque fantasy worlds. Thus, I like the Eastern Kingdoms a lot. I usually hate Horde architecture (even though I main Horde in retail right now for the first time in a decade). The only good looking city is Thunderbluff. But I don't think Kalimdor as a whole is ugly. 
---
To answer your question: obviously the EK are more aesthetically pleasing. But Kalimdor is seriously diverse and can keep you entertained just as much during the leveling process. 
---
If you start by restricting it to level 60s it's quite easy to make a first filter. Add a strong constitution of what is philosophically acceptable and it could work, as long as blizzard themselves keep it in check. 
---
Without morceling the world, flying mounts and blood elves. I'd take it. 
---
I would not. I think the goal of Classic WoW should preserve the incredibly historically important game. 
---
If people want changes and new stuff to do, they should ask for TBC servers.
---
Maybe they will make a season mode like in Diablo III or what if they made a hardcore mode where you die and you die for good. That might keep people busy.
---
Don't you think tanking in MOBA and WoW is different? 
---
I can hear this comment.
---
2?
---
looks like a one-way ticket
---
2 for me 2
---
Use you fucking brain. Companies don't send out emails like that at random and if you did nothing with your Account than you should obviously not click anything.
---
got ruined in cata :(
---
What makes it taboo?
---
&gt; We've updated our Code of Conduct (CoC) and added the following rule: Topics such as (irl) politics, religion or other clearly controversial topics, are prohibited in guild chat and on our Discord. We do not want members engaging in unnecessary discussions that may be detrimental to the social atmosphere, and could facilitate the segregation of members due to opposing views. We are here to enjoy the game together, and this should bind us regardless of our personal beliefs.
---
No talking about politics, religion or controversial topics? What the hell?!
---
Nah, I disagree. If you look at the numbers, 10% more healing by all damage you do is a lot more than what other talents bring to the table while leveling. Shadow weaving doesn't really apply any extra damage as it kinda makes you oom trying unless you spam 4 rank 1 SW:P on every mob you face. I cba that while leveling, too much effort and GCD spent.
---
You could spam Mind Flay, but it's not really efficient before the very late levels.
---
To level most efficiently without drinking, your main talents should be:
---
Wand Spec. 5/5
---
Spirit Tap 5/5
---
Imp SW:Pain 2/2
---
Mind Flay
---
Shadow Focus 3/5
---
Vamp Embrace 3/3
---
And max out in Dicipline mana talents from there until you can do Wand Specc 5/5 for max gold respecc efficiency. 
---
&gt; It's not because you have offspecs in your raid that you will wipe more lol. That's nonsense. You don't wipe mostly because of enrage on bosses. You wipe mostly because there were people missing in the raid / not did their job / did not notice they were the bomb / MT healer missing heals etc.
---
I agree those are the most important factors. *Especially* the showing up part. You think you have enough healers? Nope, some of them have stuff to do and you can't raid.
---
But also this mix of bad play (let's just call it that) and bad specs is going to hurt you, because the longer an encounter takes the more mistakes will be made. Most "difficult" aka. you do a mistake = you wipe encounters have repeating mechanics. Less less damage your raid takes and the more damage it can do the less mistakes will be made, its that simple.
---
Single off-specs won't matter all that much, but if you start stacking off-specs *and* people who don't farm consumables *and* people who do mistakes you are going to have a much harder time. This was the case with like 90% of the raid guilds (arbitrary number, but you get what I mean).
---
Blizzard is hitting private streamers with DMC / take down bans
---
&gt; kino 
---
what does this mean?
---
I'm sure you'll find a guild that will tolerate you :)
---
Most of the wired gaming mice are $40-60, whereas the wireless are usually $80+. I'm pretty happy with my Logitech.
---
Platypus are mammals, and they lay eggs. Biodiversity doesn't necessarily follow clean categories.
---
1,5 - 2 years, hype will be dead in like 3 months
---
Usually people level as frost for the slow and roots that let you kill a mob before it reaches you. It's the most comfortable spec to level solo from my experience. If you're going to level with a group of friends all the time then it doesn't really matter and you could spec fire if that sounds more fun to you, unless you're on a PvP server (you should) then frost is also your go-to to control melees that will dive you.
---
I think you can stream as long as you don't have a sub button, twitch will ban you if you stream classic with it.
---
What a crock. LOL at a hunter losing to a rogue in vanilla, especially if dwarf or orc or a ret paladin that can literally kill them in one reck bomb when their pvp trinket can't break a stun. Where do you people come up with this stuff. Go back to watching youtube videos and pretending you have a character. 
---
Perplexity's videos are videos with CLIPS with long coodlowns shown for a reason. He will flat out tell you rogues aren't GOOD in anything but a premade WSG making a druid blow cooldowns so teammates can kill him. He also respecs for just that. He plays a different spec for wpvp and duels. That isn't going to be possible on Classic. Respecs don't cost 5 gold like on this private server. They cost 100 gold to do it once a week. 
---
Have fun on the ret paladin/enhance shaman buddy. Seems you already have the built in excuse train for when you lose to a good rogue like all the other content creators.
---
Probably 1.12 state
---
Whot kin‚Äô I do for ye? 
---
Link character name. Can easily see if you are a liar. I don't believe a word you say. Most is wrong and the expertise you claim is from content creator bias and stupidity on youtube.
---
On top of that, if you do a hipster spec you will just not feel as useful. In TBC I played shadowpriest because my raid needed one, not because I wanted. We had a caster/destro warlock heavy composition, so we needed those debuffs and that mana. I find healing actually way more compelling than pressing 4 buttons repeatedly in a raid (or was it 5?) and chaining mana pots.
---
So personally I just don't get why people want to play suboptimal *DPS* builds. Raid healers have a much more intricate role for the most part. And being bottom DPS despite farming the most for the raid is kind of meh isn't it? I almost never see talks about for example feral druid off-tanks, which *are* useful. It's always "I wanna raid with enh shaman / boomkin". Those requests leave me with a big question mark.
---
You know that Classic will use 1.12 talent trees as well on day 1 right?
---
No matter of the stats, the set looks just great.
---
I killed about 100 bandits and 500 scorpids in tanaris to get it complete.
---
 Feels good..
---
I'd imagine that classic will start with a very large amount of players (probably equal to or greater than retail), but this number will start dropping after the first month of so. By that time, the novelty will have worn off for at lot of players, and they will become frustrated by the less user friendly features.   
---
A decent number of players will, however, stick around for the first year. After that, most people will either have cleared most of the content, or gotten stuck on a raid boss and quit. The player count will dwindle until a small, dedicated base remains.   
---
At this point, Classic can go two ways. Either it stays in vanilla, in which case the player count will continue to decrease very slowly, as even the most dedicated players will eventually log off forever. Classic can also eventually transition to BC, in which case the same pattern will repeat (maybe with slightly higher player retention, since BC isn't quite as rough around the edges). Classic will eventually "die" with this method as well, since people probably won't be interested in expansions after WOTLK.
---
Would it be possible, theoretically, to just have 1 huge server? Like 1 for EU, 1 for NA etc.
---
imagine if you'd had servers in the atlantic for NA-EU cross servers
---
They are hiring more devs and iirc they have more titles in the works now than ever before.
---
DM = DeadMines
---
DM North/West/East = DireMaul 
---
Classic wow works on a cycle of death and rebirth. A server normally dies a few months after Naxx is released. That being said. Most of the players on that server normally still want to play. They just want a fresh start on a new realm.
---
Oh, no I think you misunderstand. We're talking about the melee crit after successful spell crit.
---
Something like this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hVfzL0hZxVfzVMut](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hVfzL0hZxVfzVMut)  
---
If you insist on playing it PVE (and your guild allows it, which is crap but hey) this is what you'll usually play after you're hit capped (with a few alterations of course, but this is what I enjoy to roll with in order to PVP as well).
---
You'll want to bind rank 1 earth shock for crit fishing and/or interrupting unless you want to go oom very quickly though.
---
Many streamers like sodapoppin have explicitly stated they will play on pvp servers. 
---
Yeah he rerolls long before Naxx and AQ just like all the other pvp players. Late AQ/Naxx and PVP is awful. Everyone rerolls for a reason. Instead we get a PVE rogue (wildplays) with Naxx gear talking about crushing new players as if anyone in Naxx gear can't kill them with one spell at times. I bet you anything wildplays pvp's as combat ROFL.
---
Mages are more gear dependand than Hunters though. If you are undergeared in comparison to your opponent you don't tunnel vision on them. BGs have a lot of people. You play around your teammates and try to take as little damage as possible (if ranged/rogue). You don't wreck ppl this way but you'll be strong and useful.
---
Dude, this topic is about which class would be strongest with one more talent point, and the thread is about Elemental Fury...
---
If a druid and rogue stealth all the way over to a base then they are wasting a lot of time out in mid field where they aren't contributing anything.
---
Couldn‚Äôt blizz just find all of the private servers on google?
---
&gt;Imagine suggesting the main tanking class to a new player, just imagine that lmao
---
Yes, youre right, this statement carries no implications.
---
Mages are focused on CC in organized PVP rather than damage. Nova locks people at their GY regardless of gear. HP and engineering toys matter way more than damage.
---
If you're talking about roaming around solo to blow people up, sheep into trinket pyro/POM/pyro doesn't require Naxx gear to be effective.
---
Geared warriors with engineering and FAPs are the only absolute gods of PVP.
---
I don't understand it either, I'm simply trying to point out something that I think is wrong and backing it up with evidence. I don't want this to happen and I hope y'all don't either. Thank you for understanding.
---
I agree for most situations but don't forget that Horde has also Tauren, which are underrated in PvP IMO and they share some of the most common Orc classes like Warrior, Hunter, Shaman who are all great Tauren classes as well. I think the utility of having an additional, reliable AoE stun vs stun resist is much closer than ppl make it out to be.
---
Which is better wired or wireless? 
---
I think retail is potentially harder for a new person to get into. You get dropped into a world where you don't know anything and you are given a character boost so of course you use it. The game gives you very little opportunity to actually learn anything... If you don't have previous knowledge or aren't lucky enough run into some better players willing to show you the ropes then I imagine a new player would be quite lost. 
---
Imagine being a new player in BFA. You go from 110-120 and jump into end game content doing world bosses, dungeons, incursions, warfronts etc. In no time you have enough item level to get into a normal/heroic pug. First few bosses are super easy but eventually people start noticing that you are bringing the group down with low dps, messed up mechanics etc. You get kicked with little to no explanation of what you did wrong.
---
In Vanilla, questing and lower level dungeons really help you learn your class and the mechanics of the game. You can't just face-roll to max level and end game. People are also more willing to work with you in a game where you aren't just filling an empty slot in the group. Since you can't just queue up to replace a "bad player", it would be easier to just help them understand their role and what they need to do for the group to succeed.
---
I‚Äôll one up you both on this one. Get ready for a bit of a read.
---
I first started playing wow when it came out in 04/05. I was in 5th grade at the time. Not knowing the game at all, my two friends and I were so excited to play a game where we could be in a party and have our own island to chill at, fish and do whatever else. This was our idea of wow at the time.
---
I believe I was the first one to get the game. My friends and I scaled the map to see what island looked fitting. If you look at the most northern part of the map of Tirisfal Glades there‚Äôs this island apart from the continent. This was the place.This is when I started on the greatest adventure of my video game career. 
---
I was a Night Elf. Keep in mind, I have no idea how to get to this island. I‚Äôm just looking at the map to see if my player is going in the right direction. So, I start running through Teldrassil to Darnassus, then taking the boat to Menethil Harbor. From the Wetlands, and through Arathi Highlands to Hillsbrad Foothills. Then north through the Alterac Mountains, until I noticed I had to swim across Lordamere Lake to Silverpine Forest. I finally made it to Tirisfal Glades. 
---
I was on my way to the island and ran into a troll or undead, I can‚Äôt recall. My friends were with me IRL for this part. I started shit talking the horde player, quickly learning he couldn‚Äôt understand whatever I was saying. Afterwards, I finally made it to the island. To then realize, there was nothing there, and we couldn‚Äôt do anything.
---
There you have it. This adventure took days IRL. Waking up before school and playing when I got home. How many corpse runs I had. Ah man, I wish it was somehow recorded.
---
The real content of classic wow is the friendships. Running UD Strat might get old unto itself, but running it with my mates while half-drunk and joking around never does.
---
You may as well ask how long bowling or golf will realistically last.
---
I personally played Shadowpriest back in the day and enjoyed it quite a bunch in BG PvP. But now I'am gravitating towards Hunter because they are less gear dependand and less "all-in" than some of the other DPS classes.

 **&lt;Always East&gt; | Semi-Hardcore | PvP | Server Region: NA, but all are welcome! | Faction: Alliance**
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"**  Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us. 
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019.  Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content.  Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze.  Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW. 
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us.  Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;**.  
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever!  At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up.  Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic.  Please understand your role.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people!  We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!  
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics.  Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!  
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week; Wednesday and Thursday (this may change depending on how Classic raids feel after launch.)
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than 8:15PM EST.
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around 10:00PM EST for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than 11:45PM EST.
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.  
---
The overall goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their ‚Äúsecond home,‚Äù away from the real life stresses we all face.  A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. Please reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460 or Kegg#8900**) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you!  Orders stand: ***‚ÄúBe Excellent!‚Äù***

I didn't mean to go on a long rant there. I just really love the character progression of Vanilla WoW. Its sad that current WoW can't hope to create that same feeling.
---
Wired. Faster response time. No delay.
---
Announced at Blizzcon. Should be able to easily find footage of Ion on the Classic panel saying it and talking about the design philosophy.

I‚Äôm getting classic for 15 a month. BfA will never be touched.
---
**&lt;The** **Tail** **End&gt; \[A\] \[US\] \[PvE\]**
---
A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx this time. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me
---
**&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
Hey everyone!
---
We are an alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual".
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory.
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO.
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004.
---
**Raid Times (PST):**
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders.
---
**Membership:**
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move on. When they come back, its like they never left.
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100% sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have a full 40 members every raid.
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is great for members of our guild.
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals.
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

This was a guildie's SS, but I'm not sure what monitor he had at the time unfortunately.
---
damn that brought back some good memories. Played Horde on Ravenquest during Vanilla/TBC and I saw a lot of familiar names and guildtags :D nicely done.
---
Considering height difference this should be doable.
---
I‚Äôll go back to playing on a private server before I‚Äôll pay more than $15 / month
---
Pretty sure he still plays. His alt was supposedly Xlarge which is idling at level 87, but there's also another character in the guild called Xxlarge, which is 120, suggesting that he still plays, or has recently.
---
Frost mage is the least gear dependent class in PvP. Their damage isn't very important compared to all the utility they bring and they have a very control and keep-away oriented playstyle where they usually don't need to facetank damage. Ice barrier buffers their hp and ice block can be used to wait out unfavorable situations and remove dangerous effects.
---
I have a  Logitech G403, you can run this mouse either wired or wireless, should be around $55.  
---
Yeah, but they have to do it the legal way which takes a massive amount of time and money. Which is why they only go for huge pservers. Nobody really knows how far they can take it either since in 2015 people didn't think they could touch anyone outside the US, but boom went the dynamite with Nostalrius which was located in France.
---
With streamers however it's as simple as contact Twitch and tell them to shut the streamer down.
---
&gt; cat durid uis for fite!

FTFY
---
1) You can disagree with someone without downvoting.  Even though I disagreed with your choice of talents I didn't downvote you for making that choice.  "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it" - Aristotle
---
2) You said "as Shadow Priest".  Not "as Shadow Priest while leveling".  Noone expects to max shadow weaving during leveling.  Please don't strawman arguments in an attempt to discredit me and my opinion. (And yes, assumptions taken out of context are strawman)
---
3) Shadow weaving is still suprior than vamp embrace, even in PvP.  Your fellow warlocks and other shadow priests in PvP will thank you.  10% healing based off damage dealt is not as much as a straight +15% damage increase from  your own shadow spells AS WELL as shadow spells from ANY other source.
---
3A) If your argument was for PvP, ShadowWeaving is best.  For PvE? Still ShadowWeaving, especially on boss fights for dungeons or even late-tier raiding/"on-farm" raiding.
---
I mean at the end of the day it's only 2 talent points; to each their own: you do you.  But for me personally I'd rather spec into Shadow Weaving (which you assumed is where I'm putting the points) then get +10% returned healing from VE.
---
Why would they ask you to pay 20$ a month and no microtransactions when they could ask you to pay 20$ AND microtransactions? if they're going to have microtransactions they're going to have microtransactions, it's not about the game costing enough on its own.
---
Thought he died IRL
---
Wyverns don't live in Australia, neither lions nor bats lay eggs. I know it is Fantasy, but from most perspectives, wyverns should be ordinary mammals. Mammal-bird hybrids, like gryphons or harpies, could lay eggs, but for wyverns it seems a bit strange.
---
Literally means nothing 
---
Private servers.
---
I think it's hard to tell before knowing how they'll go with it.
---
Private servers have been going on for a decade, their "trick" is to start fresh with "new from scratch servers" every now and then and staggering content releases.
---
If Blizzard does the same, or something similar, Classic will go on for decades, otherwise I really don't know, it's reasonable to think that people will get bored sooner or later if nothing comes to renew the interest.
---
I've budgeted in a paid transfer if I cock this up tbh.
---
Yeah, that's what I read as well. 
---
Where do you see this?
---
Because warriors are the only tank most of the time are not playing a warrior to tank raids (you need very little MT's compared to modern WoW in raids due to 40 people outside one encounter in Naxx) and they need the same gear in 1.12. They need the same weapons, the same leather hit pieces etc. They simply don't bring rogues. Go on any private server and look at the chat/world chat where people are forming groups. You will see "looking for ranged dps". I don't bring any rogues for anything on my warrior until raids when I tank 5 and 10's and neither do the other warriors who are gearing. If you want a spot all the time play a mage. Rogues are completely useless, have no utility in their raid spec and share drops. They are good dps (still under warriors) in a raid with again no utility, but raiding isn't 5 and 10 mans where you get pre raid bis.  Rogues threat drop also doesn't matter on alliance and warriors now where dps gear to tank to maintain threat. The meta has completely changed with consumables etc that tanks didn't have on in vanilla. Top Horde raiders don't play Tauren tanks anymore. They use trolls just for threat.
---
You basically have to know a tank or kiss someones arse to gear a rogue in vanilla in 1.12. Again this would all be fine if there is payoff. There isn't. Warriors scale better and are better, None of this happened in real Vanilla because one handed fury wasn't even viable on a warrior until AQ, let alone leading dps. Warriors dps'd with 2 handers and slam spec using a swing timer. Rogues were also way different in 1.1 and OP compared to 1.12. None of this is in Classic. Most of these people never raided in vanilla and get all their information from content creators who are often complete frauds and base all their information on content creators from vanilla who were one of the .01 percent of players who could actually record video of themselves playing when we didn't have dedicated recording hardware built into our GPU's.
---
This is what warriors did in real vanilla from a content creator who actually raided back then. This doesn't happen in Classic 1.12. They crush dps from the start.
---

---
I am not saying a rogue still can't be fun or anything. I am saying they are the hardest class to gear and get in a raid, are overpopulated AND are nothing close to being "overpowered" in Vanilla. If you want to play one have a blast. If you are expecting world of roguecraft, it's not gonna happen.
---
Yeah. That makes sense why you‚Äôd prefer Horde side. 
---
TBH it makes sense from dev perspective as well. Horde quests were done later in the process and IIRC didn‚Äôt exist until either early in the Beta or late in the FF alpha. 
---
Blizzard wasn‚Äôt really considering questing as a core part of the experience until after the alphas started, as player feedback indicated more quests were needed. 
---
Since the horde quests were developed later, they were likely developed from the ground up with the philosophy that players would level up mostly via questing. As opposed to the Ally quests which clearly weren‚Äôt. 
---
I dunno,  I don't really care about launch. It takes forever to get to 60. Slow and steady for me.  Itll be months before I hit 60.
---
I may be alone in this, but I love the nelf starting zone.
---
 Alliance zones are more aesthetically appealing to me in general, although I don't care for ogrimmar or stormwind particlarly. 
---
Long time horde player btw
---
Look on Discord and forums for pre-made guilds that line up with your play style at least if you play with a bunch of like minded people less chance of having a bad time.
---
I'll be paying $30 a month to maintain two accounts, so yes.
---
Theres no way in hell those guys are going to be able roll on pvp servers. They will have multiple entire guilds with their entire purpose to gank and ruin their play 24/7
---
I like the human zones, other than that u find horde or neutral zones to be nicer looking.
---
I prefer Kalimdor. It feels more mysterious, wild and threatening. It's also more diverse I feel
---
I've never played Horde btw 
---
For someone so angry and adamant about knowledge and intelligence, you are so in the wrong. 
---
Shadowmeld in classic can only be used out of combat.
---
Multiple girlfriends at the same time I guess. 
---
Can confirm, raided as elemental shammy on private server. Tried all manner of gearing, consumable, and downlinking combinations, in the end I just felt worthless. Respected to resto and my character could look himself in the mirror again.
---
This makes me hope that blizz will re-release TBC servers and give us the option to copy our toons over. 
---
Well.. hate to be the one to break this to you, but cringe is most often used in a negative light. It means it makes me remember all of the implications of creating water over and over, and I get a negative response from that feeling.
---
Dont mind me, I'm the ol'dwarf in Ironforge frequenting the Nelf strip joints. Come here lassie, Papa's got a few coins in his pocket for ya. Just got to reach in and grab'em
---
Ah ok, pretty much what I was expecting then. I'll probably play Rogue still to be honest it's likely I'll have a couple of friends playing and have no issue forming my own groups so I should hopefully be ok with the early gearing/farming I was just wondering if you meant something like "Rogue drops are rarer on average" or something like that.  
---
I do appreciate your candid remarks too and although some people disagree with you they don't seem to post any reasons -why- and everything you say is pretty much backed up from other threads and generalizations. For example rogues not being wanted in Premade BGs, Warriors outdpsing them in the melee spot etc.  
---
I did play Vanilla (but I was absolutely awful back then) and wondered if Rogue really was as easy mode OP as everyone made out but I think in reality peoples opinions are based on the fact Rogues can be frustrating to play against (especially when you yourself are undergeared), multiple stuns, forms of CC and stealth can be obnoxious when you don't know how to deal with it or have the gear to deal with it.
---
Your*
---
Go for it, I doubt even the most hardcore guild would reject you, assuming you are hardcore in every other way except race. The biggest benefit to being an orc is axe weapon skill. But not all weapons are axes. Blood fury isn't a big DPS increase.
---
Hunter has a really high skill cap. It's like playing a mage without the training wheels. The answer to your question is you kite it. While not screwing up at all. One screw up and you can die. Other then that a hunter has the longest range in the game. Keep a bro at arms length and you will be fine.
---
That‚Äôs $180 a year to play a game that is 15 years old. I‚Äôve already given blizzard a lot of money over the years by playing several expansions of WoW and most of their other games. Knowing activision, I can see them getting greedy and monetizing classic somehow and besides, I can already play the game for free elsewhere 
---
Thanks your! :p
---
We generally look to avoid real-life politics, religion and issue topics because in text based chats especially it can cause issues.
---
People coming in part way into a conversation and not understand whats going on etc - now that doesn't stop members talking in private among themselves but to avoid culture clashes from a membership spread across europe it is necessary.
---
English isn't everyone's first language and thus certain topics its most certainly worth not risking bigger issues cropping up due to people not understanding each other.
---
Found out it was a private server :s

I'm a software engineer and got into programming because of a guy in my first guild who was a programmer. I was a senior in high school at the time and unsure about what I wanted to study in college. I was sort of 'tech inclined' but didn't really know much, and this guy straight up took me under his wing and put me on an obsessive path learning computer programming and Linux. So thanks to that guy I did computer science in college and have worked in the industry since 2010.
---
I mostly do web application development (Golang, PHP, JS) but I've recently been dabbling in game development (unity 5, C#).
---
BIG shout-out to Indvold on Alliance - The Forgotten Coast. I lost track of you when I xferred to Nathrezim in TBC, but you were a major bro.

Looks about right.

Hi, /u/ghettojesusxx
---
 **&lt;Requiem&gt;** \- Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore  
---
**Intro:** We are a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.  
---
First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.  Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.  Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers.  We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities.  We're also not asking you to give up PVP.  And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.  
---
**What we're focusing on now:**  Building a core group\* of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.   \*If you have past experience with being a raid/class leader (or even no experience at all) and are interested in applying for an officer position, PM me.  
---
**Expectations:**  Be courteous and respectful of all members.  No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn. 
---
 **Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD. 
---

When has anyone ever said that WotF isn't useful?
---
1. I downvoted because your comment did not contain any sort of explanation. You indirectly say I should not pick the talents cus they are bad but aren't smart enough to understand why.
---
2. I said "as shadow priest... And Of the Whale is my favourite while leveling". You should read more than half of the sentence to understand what am I'm talking about. 
---
3. The whole post is about leveling. The whole freaking thing. Why are you even mentioning end game PvE or Pvp?
---
Who picks Spirit Tap after reaching 60 anyway?
---
Christopher Moltisanti plays World of Warcraft?
---
And no dieing because I forgot to shut it off!
---
We are trying to continue to differentiate from r/wowservers, so please ask for private server streams over there (Rule #1/#4). Thanks for your understanding, and sorry for the inconvenience.
---
You don‚Äôt have all the buttons on the side? How do you WoW?
---
&gt; Not sure what you mean about tauren not taking care of the land,
---
Exactly the opposite of what I wrote. I think you've just misread ;)
---
Yeah I'm not saying not to play it, I am just saying it's not this OP class people try to represent it as due to the past and Vanilla starting with a 1.1 patch and not 1.12. Just level pretty fast, try to be social and do instances while leveling to form friendships, most specifically with a tank/healer.
---
These content creators are mostly frauds. One of the most popular had a list of "most op abilities in vanilla" and didn't even list reck bomb. You WILL get one shot by it often in vanilla as a horde rogue in group pvp and there is nothing you can do to stop it because rogues can't trinket stuns.  That is how delusional these people are. They think a one shot with 0 skill from a passive ability getting charges where a class has no escape is balanced and rogues aren't.
---
I have favorite zones on each faction. My all time favorite is wetlands. Horde side its tirisfal glades. 
---
Maybe, for me however I don't get the same feeling from the Alliance zones.
---
For me there is nothing more World of Warcraft than Durator in the Orc starting Zone and when you finally swim over to the lush green Islands near the Darkspear Tribes.
---
I love the contrast, between the Zones on the Horde side. The Jungle, the Darkness of the Undercity. The open space of Mulgore to the Barrens with their Oasis.
---
I'm completely open to the idea that this is pure nostalgia, because a lot of times that doesn't affect me as much. But Durator starting Zone, has a very special place in my heart.
---
No matter how objectively "empty" it looks.
---
The Alliance zones, just look like any Forest I could walk into in Real Life. Snowy Mountains is something in Switzerland for me. Where I do my vacations.
---
But Durator? I don't think I have ever been to such a place.
---
Seconding the recommendation of the Logitech g403, this is the mouse I use and I love it.
---
When I first bought it, there was a problem with the mouse where holding left click wouldn't consistently register as being held down -- it would kind of stutter on and off.  When I reported it to Logitech they sent me a brand new one in the mail, free of charge, so I will vouch for their support staff as well!
---
When it comes to wired vs wireless, as I understand it the wireless version of this mouse has no discernible input lag difference from the wired one.
---
If you're super duper serious about finding a great mouse, I recommend checking out [RocketJumpNinja's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGJaDZC7PChgd-XMwcbZkiw) for more information on mice than you'll probably ever need.
---
I had a Razer naga once, but i readjust back to a normal mouse because i had problems with my naga.  
---
its not that difficult to just use the keyboard and the two additional mousebuttons.
---
I was one of the first people to discover the neutral auction house on my server and made mad bank trading faction exclusive pets. I'd fill my inventory with cats or whatever, head to the desert and return home with bags full of rats and roaches. In IF I didn't even need to put them on the ah, just stand around with a roach out and everyone went crazy having no idea where it came from. 
---
You took bad advice. The real question isnt whether "its good", the question is "how much effort are you willing to put into it, in order to excel in pvp?". You can make anything work, aslong as youre willing to improve, learn, get the best gear and use engineering.
---
Pretty sure he was attempting to be funny.
---
Yes 
---
Jesus this is such a weird comment.
---
He's asking the question because it's pretty obvious there will be surge of players to start and it will just slowly dwindle. Eventually after a couple of years Blizzard will have to do something. I can see the numbers being very grim after 3-4 years if they don't do another expansion or something. Many people don't even have a reason to stop playing private servers which are 'free'
---
play a female character, then u got a girlfriend.
---
You don't think treating your guild members like adults and allowing your members' humanity to police the issue is a better approach than censorship? Which type of rule would you rather live under? 
---
Own it mate, that's baller!
---
Divine spirit is useless for PVP.  And improved renew is great because if you have a rogue or mage on you chances are you won't get a cast off to heal urself, so having an instant heal tick for more is great for those close fights where you win with 5-10% hp left. 
---
Until the tourism dies off, and you end up with a bunch of dead servers.
---
Just pick the PvP server with the coolest name.
---
Level 20 DHs dont exist though. 
---
I used to camp a toon at a rare spawn that dropped a cat in tbc. Crazy cat people made me all my gold
---
They didn't charge people transferring TO the dying servers. They most certainly charges the people transferring FROM them.
---
Already done. Mostly from herbalism though. Much more doable in NA then EU. I bought all the tokens from like 107-111,000 gold. 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/cE8rIkq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/cE8rIkq.jpg)
---
I will never play retail again. I was gonna farm 10 tokens in addition to the 350 dollar cap and 2.5 years of gametime for classic, but either the population fell off a cliff or peoples raid progress is done, because herbs halved in value and I already have enough to play for years past Classic. Farmed it in a month listening to audiobooks because I saw no reason to keep playing the new FRESH when I already know the classes I want to play backwards and forwards and I want to have more excitement going into Classic. A lot of people also went to the TBC Fresh and imo TBC sucks. All it has is PVE I have already done. Everything else in it is broken or sucks.
---
Mages are much stronger early on than endgame when everyone is geared. 
---
Frostbolt scales horribly with spell power. 
---
What about fire 
---
Fear breaks stealth in vanilla yes, and divine fury is great for pvp if you have the ZG trinket. You can hardcast max rank heal because it gives you a 1.5 second cast time for a few seconds. You can basically go from 10% hp to full with a 1.5 second cast spell. Very strong. But yeah perhaps before you get it you should go with the spell damage reduction.
---
Fire does better damage but now you‚Äôre giving up survivability and cc. 
---
Warlock, Spriest and Elly Shamans shine in end game gear. 
---
you know everyone says rogues are bad for BGs but i was in a guild of all rogues and theres nothing more scary is WSG when you see noting come at you in the field and nothing in the flag room and then everyone gets sapped well are guild master that stack stam got the flag and as soon as he got back to base he would have a 2 rogue escort for saps well all the other rogues targeted the EFC. worked every time lol.
---
Logitech G602. 37 bucks. Has enough buttons for a MMO. Can use the DPI switchs as buttons to. Has the longest lasting battery life I ever have seen in a mouse. You can use 1 battery or 2 to change the weight of the mouse for preference. Can also perform well in FPS games, unlike Naga's.

I have enough gold for about 3 years of sub time. I am not sure if I am going to use it or not because I probably won't quit retail for good when Classic comes out.
---
Don't have a retail account (That is active)
---
However, thats a really good idea!
---
I'm sure I have some would be rare as hell garbage (arrows, bows, other crap) that is no longer in the game on my account I could probably pawn off to classic time.
---
Good idea.
---
Fancy a pint?
---
You can think w/e you want. I did the grind as a druid. Spent a lot of time in AB and learning/knowing AB strats. The entire bg team was constantly tracking enemy rogue/druids as part of the strategy. If they weren't seen for a while, then we made sure we had people at xroads ready to react to the node that was about to get ganked. You most likely wouldn't stealth from ST to Farm, when you can mount to LM then stealth the rest of the way unseen. The point is, it's not a waste to have your rogue/druid in stealth, because it makes it harder for the enemy team to plan. Sometimes as a druid you just sit bearform away from flag, instead of being in stealth. Especially if there are rogues trying to get your node.
---
&gt; Tirisfal Glades is one of most atmospheric zones. It's Horde.
---
It used to be human land, which is why there are human buildings all over, which is why it looks so good. This is like saying that horde architecture looks good and then using undercity as an example.
---
Not without other significant changes. The game was balanced around having a 2500 player cap, private servers have had to boost spawn rates to compensate, but it still leads to massive bottlenecks in the open world.
---
For instance, it took me 7 days to complete the "small stone shard" quest in badlands on a private server, because at all points in time there are 10-20 people in the spot farming for elemental earths. It doesn't matter if they increase the respawn rate, they're still tagged and killed as quickly as they spawn.
---
The higher populations also create a target rich environment for people interested in ganking or otherwise griefing low levels. For instance, I once had an undead rogue in westfall killing stoutmantle. He'd explode the NPC as soon as he spawned, set a timer, let people kill him and then just res when the timer was up and kill the NPC immediately again. This one person, spending about 30 seconds of their time every 10 minutes was capable of wasting hundreds if not thousands of hours of other players cumulative time.
---
Yeah I can.  Scenario is you are using 3/3 blizzard on mobs and your frost nova is on CD.  You go to cone of cold the mobs and it only deals damage.  They don't gain the slow effect.
---
What you're noticing is porbably the fact that (iirc) most of the Eastern Kingdoms and Alliance zones were developed first with a lot of the Kalimdor and Horde zones being rushed for release. So the former are rich in features, colour and intrazone variation; the latter being more bland and boring
---
No. Character names still have to be unique per server. You're thinking of Battle.Net Tags
---
Or a server that is super populated for a while and you level up a bit, then it turns out they were all tourists and quit overnight. 
---
Couple of monthes for most ppl.  you get to 60, run 5mans get prebis or near it. do raids couple of time, then you've seene verything and lose motivation and quit. there arent much to do beyond that, if you aren't tryharding, which most ppl arent. Some will log raid for a few monthes on top of that.
---
Only a small percentage of tryhards will play more extensively. Private server experience also shows this, there is a huge rotation of players. And some amount of addicts that keep replaying the same content over and over, leveling new chars and goind through the same process.
---
Multiple entire guilds whose sole purpose is to grief a streamer? I feel like this reasoning I see parroted has escalated severely over time. I think everyone is way overblowing the impact here.
---
&gt;all
---
Great - that's the kind of story I was excited to hear about. Recently I've also started using Linux on my old laptop, but there is so much to learn so it will definitely take time till I feel comfortable enough using it for actual work.
---
I've heard it said that RPPvP servers have a somewhat more respectful WPvP attitude, is this true?
---
Problem is you have 100k people playing on launch day and then a month later the peak at any point on one server is like 5k. So you cap them out at 5k on launch, you end up with servers with 1k max concurrent players a month later. 
---
It‚Äôs just you bro.
---
I much prefer the horde pathways to 30 (which is where the worlds collide).
---
My concern is going to a server with terrible population balance. An ideal world would be a server with a strong faction split near 50/50. I have a feeling though that it's going to end up very Alliance heavy. I also have a bad feeling that I could go to a balanced server and once the initial rush dies down it doesn't stabilize balanced.
---
They will probably handle that the same way they do on retail. You keep your name, but you get a suffix of your original realm. So your name goes from "KillGod" to "KillGod - Magtheridon" 
---
Ha thats hilarious. Just a wave of invisible opponents sapping you xD
---
Counter strike
---
You don‚Äôt understand it because you‚Äôve never tried it. Running 3/3 is simply not viable for aoe farming. 
---
Yeah, I was stuck on a dying server for 2 years, you're unfortunately wrong. It's free to transfer TO a dead server, not off of one.
---
All these questions are secretly or not so secretly always about: "I'll have my fun but then I'll be bored. Blizzard should cater to me by changing Classic!".
---
My (sarcastic) answer is basically to that. Which is "no". Classic should never be changed. This whole project came about because Vanilla was changed into TBC, then Wrath, etc. And now here we are. If Classic is changed, what then? Shall we petition Blizzard to bring it back, *again*? It's asinine.
---
Fortunately, my prediction is that Blizzard will not change Classic. Also, If they are not completely incompetent (which cannot be ruled out, but I'm hopeful :), they'll release the expansions too eventually, as separate servers.
---
It's a no brainer for them. It's relatively low effort for great payoff. They'll have the team and bringing back the expansions will get easier as they get closer to current. Every expansion have their fans (even generally disliked ones) but especially TBC and Wrath is very popular. After they become available, a lot of people will basically never unsubscribe.
---
Game time will be shared between BFA and CLASSIC
---
&gt;  The meta story for the horde is basically just ‚Äúthis place around us is hostile, we need to band together to survive.‚Äù
---
That makes perfect sense, thematically. The Horde came to a distant land in Kalimdor seeking refuge and making a new home for themselves. Everything *is* hostile. After all, the Horde is a band of races that banded together for the mutual benefit of survival
---
Forever ever? Forever ever ever.
---
This was echoed back in the day. The overall consensus for new players was that they liked how Alliance looked and their zones were better looking - most people started by playing Night Elves or Paladin. There was a Horde/Alliance unbalance for a while and most of us knew it was because people would shrug and say they liked the prettier races more. It wasn't until TBC that Horde began to take the majority due to the racial imbalance at the time working so much better in PvP/Arena and lots re-rolling. It was interesting playing both factions over various servers and noticing the trends ebb and flow over time.
---
The drain rolls between like 50 and 150 dmg per second when you equip it. It is then reduced further by armor. You just spam equip/unequip until you get a nice low tick of like 35-50 (or use a macro). It is also useful on ZG tiger boss because one of the trolls will gouge you and change targets.
---
I meant that I may not want to use all of my gold on WoW tokens if I intend to continue playing retail (or return to it later).
---
Most people can fuck off then.
---
Most servers in 2005 and vanilla pservers are alliance heavy, I see no reason it's gonna be any different because paladin makes raiding that much easier. And in PvP, it's easier to be a decent Hpaladin than a decent shaman.
---
Search eBay for completed listings.
---
This is true, but I guess I'm hoping I find the server that is as close to balanced as it will get.
---
At least the memes are alive and well
---
IIRC WC3 manual states that wyverns are related both to griffins and dragons.
---
Nice. The google drive download worked for me. Looks good.
---
First thing to consider. If you commit to being a melee dps. You are commiting to be a HC player. Melee dps take way more effort to make work in classic wow and competition is fierce.
---
As far as mages go. I think they are the master class of classic wow. They are strong at every level of play. They don't require much gear to work. A good set of gear is easily attainable. They Have Teleports and can make their own pots, and water. They also farm really really really well. Honestly playing a mage is like shitting rainbows. It's all gravy all the time and you don't sacrifice anything for the privilege.
---
I wouldn't hold it against most people. WoW is a theme park game. When you've reached the end of your progression path, its natural to become bored. 
---
I've leveled tons of characters  on horde and I despise the barrens. Its just bland yellow grass for like 15 levels, the mobs are all very similar and there's just so. Much. Running. Its a terrible zone and questing hub tbh. The only reason I even go there is because you don't really have an option as Silverpine has way too few quests.
---
I love when I'm done with it and can head to Ashenvale or Arathi or wherever else you go around 20.
---
Well, dragons are something completely different. That has surely been retconned. But i can imagine that gryphons have relations to birds while wyverns are related to bats. Maybe a common ancestor with hippogryphs?
---
I am very concerned there won't be RP PvP servers or that (of the few that will be released, hopefully) a streamer will roll on one. Will pretty much absolutely destroy my WoW experience personally.
---
I think alliance are the better PVE faction and horde PvP - should be interesting
---
No it gives you more time to do real people shit rather than spending 12+ hours doing the same exact raids week after week. 
---
Yeah, true. Anecdotally though lots of people seem more excited for Classic to get in there and do the raids they didn't get to do the first time around. So I could see it winding up very Alliance heavy.
---
Part of me wants to do a human warrior this time around, but I may just go horde rather than deal with the overpopulation on the Alliance side.
---
Hardwon Surefoot is that you?
---
&gt; but it is extremely obvious for a multitude of reasons.
---
Are you talking about the image the OP linked? because if so it's pretty clean, the only issue I could see (other than a simple request to click a link which is a huge red flag) is the lack of space before the "Blizzard support site" text at the bottom of the image.
---
I've seen a lot of these scams where they leave mistakes (they're incredibly obviously and hard to miss), the image linked isn't one of the scams you're referring to.
---
Blizzard will do anything to make money, if that means making new content or releasing TBC, they'll do it. 
---
Yes, but not so much of the population but more of how many mix/maxers there will be on the server, big minimaxing guilds can singlehandedly ruin a servers economy and pvp scene. 
---
Not even close. Mage one of the most forgiving classes. Your back up plans have back up plans. Hunter skill cap is way higher. You dont get to blink or ice block or frost nova when you screw up. You get to die.
---
&gt;No because the current community (mostly) doesn't want what Vanilla was. 
---
Do you mean retail players or the Classic fan base? 
---
Yes, getting Classic Games emails from Blizzard is a legitimate thing. I've gotten one telling me that my Diablo 2 characters are going to expire and to log in (it had the specific, accurate expiration dates and didn't have any links for me to follow)
---
Are you monologuing right now dude?
---
What‚Äôs the statement/question/discussion point?
---
Regardless everything you‚Äôve proposed is sub optimal and expensive. Noone enchants leveling gear unless they‚Äôre fed it from a main. The exception being fiery weapon, which is a common one, and low level weapon glows for the lulz.
---
Hybrids (generally) bank a second set of gear. The gold lost doing this is offset by travel form and free mount, druids and paladins respectively, as both should level and gear like pures. 
---
Depends entirely on the content release cycle.
---
If they release Naxx a year after, I bet most people will leave around Naxx just because of the end of the vanilla content cycle and it honestly being the least interesting part of vanilla.
---
Say they do each state 9 months apart, it will last 3-4 years.
---
I have the UtechSmart Venus MMO mouse and it's pretty great. It's wired though and you asked for wireless... Either way, I got mine for like $33 on Cyber Monday (looks like it's currently $39 on Amazon). Works just fine for me (I'm a webdev and also use a 2015 MacBook pro). The only slight catch is that the program to customize the mouse is windows specific. So you can't customize the buttons/LED color. Although typing this right now I'm sure it would work using Wine (which is what I currently use to play private servers using a windows wow client on my Mac).
---
 5 of me and my IRL friends are going to play classic together and we all bought the mouse. So far none of us have had issues with it across different rigs and games. It does feel sketchy buying random, relatively cheap Chinese products on Amazon BUT this one is legit.
---
Seems like they all pretty much go for over a grand, sometimes significantly so. This set of Classic-Cata even went for over 4k 
---

---
They truly went above and beyond with #nochanges.
---
Classic games is their entire classic series (Warcraft 1-3, Starcraft, Diablo etc.).
---
I got an email from Classic games notifying me that my Diablo 2 characters will expire soon, it seems to be a new Blizzard department/group as I got this email on Saturday.
---
It‚Äôs not from Blizzard. It‚Äôs a phishing scam. There is no such thing as a ‚Äúclassic account.‚Äù
---
&gt;Why would they go the OSRS route when they have a wealth of expansions to roll out?
---
Two reasons I can think of. The first, it'd split the fanbase. The second, it doesn't stop the fundamental problem that makes this a question in the first place, finite content. So long as you limit yourself to expansions you will always hit a content wall and the population will start to drop. New content goes around that because it's something new that no one has experienced before and is theoretically limitless. Add on that if they do it right and stay true to the games design philosophy it has the potential to do some really great things. 
---
Ah I didn't make it clear because I was in a hurry posting, looking for some feedback or thoughts. It would defo only be if you have a main to carry gold for you then just using enchants to heal in dps gear or agility on heal gear (for druids).. i guess many would find this pointless but I've always loved being able to do anything anytime, a sort of RP thing for fun without changing gear.. think i'll defo at least try it!
---
&gt;The reason I like BC balance is that every spec, for every class, was viable in PvP
---
I also liked that the tiered gear has gear designed for each spec. Overall I liked Vanilla much, much more than TBC but class balance and gear was something that TBC did right. 
---
There are plenty of hybrid items at max level for druids, actually that's what you're supposed to use if you want to pvp. Items like Bonering helm, wildheart kilt, songbird blouse etc all excellent to maximize all your stats, goes well with the king of hybrid spec 0/30/21. Then whenever you want to heal/tank/raid or whatever you just slightly adjust your gear as you should always have an extra set in your bags or bank as a druid
---
Yes, you can put anyone‚Äôs mail address as the reply-to address.
---
Love theorycrafting about weird hybrid builds. Would like to try a tanky melee-shock shaman all about getting in people's faces and being hard to peel and having great mana efficiency. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxfzxchoZE0bbxxu
---
Steal a warrior shield, build strength/stam as well as you can, intel enchants. 
---
No doubt dude fun is an individual thing. I‚Äôve levelled as a dagger rogue multiple times which is considered sub optimal. I‚Äôve levelled as a fire mage, as a balance Druid, as an elemental shaman and as a disc priest. 
---
I derive my fun these days from being effective and efficient. I was 15 when wow came out and a far different man than I am now at 30.
---
You do you, but carry a set of second gear just in case it all goes to shit,
---
Ah yes ofc level 60 is different but this would be mainly for leveling despite being pointless
---
&gt;I'd appreciate a "Old School" server but that would be IN ADDITION to Vanilla servers.
---
Same, I'm pro post Nax content but ONLY if servers are preserved for people that don't want to play the new content. 
---
That isn't much to work off of? Or am I wrong here.
---
That seems odd to me, given Warcraft 1 and 2 were in EK with orcs fighting humans, like Lotr.
---
I don't see how that style is any less "Warcraft". 
---
Unless Warcraft began with Warcraft 3. 
---
Yeah i'll test it out and if it turns to poo I'll do the usual double gear for sure
---
So they brought it back and likely it‚Äôll be profitable so why would you be pushing for them to charge more? 
---
If blizzard charges too much, people may just leave.
---
There‚Äôs still private servers. If I was charged more for wow classic, blizzard can go fuck themselves. 
---
You can‚Äôt even explain how it works though. How can you expect people to listen to what you‚Äôre saying if you can‚Äôt even explain it
---
Dun Morogh, Loch Modan, and Wetlands definitely belong on the list of good, aesthetic, atmospheric zones. Whether you like them or dislike them, they fit really well and definitely bring the player in in a way that many of the other zones do not. 
---
Also, some of the very best zones in Kalimdor are alliance zones (teldrasil, darkshore), to the original point of the thread. I think the number of really good zones in each continent is similar, but overall Kalimdor is a bit better. 
---
That sounds awesome, I'd love to see how it turns out for you! I also wanted to make a Ret Paladin with Agil&gt;Intel&gt;Str gear for Veng procs (because crit from agil) and high Intel for more Spell casting without OOM!
---
If you can make friends with a warrior you‚Äôll be golden. He‚Äôll tank everything on the grind to the top lol. 
---
Ah I think I get it... so if they are still within the 2 sec blizzard slow and you cone them, THEN in that case cone doesn‚Äôt apply a slow, and as soon as blizzard slow wears off they smack your ass
---
&gt;we will have a lot of BFA players, and they can influence the vote of changes
---
I'm sure there's a way to gate them out of voting. Say for example you have to have a level 60 character and have played X hours of Classic in the last X weeks (i'm not sure what'd be fair so I'm living the time frames as "X's") in order to be eligible to vote. 
---
Add on that I think that a "constitution' of sorts should be written to help define what made Classic WoW "great" so that changes that go against the "constitution" can't be implemented into the game at all. 
---
All that said, I too hope to see post Nax content, something to keep the game alive after the initial run and I don't think that "seasons" would be the route to go, and TBC (and beyond) would more than likely kill Classic outright unfortunately. 
---
I have one thing I have to do on every noob, even if it isn't time efficient, just for convenience and saving money.
---
Say I start in Elwynn, I will farm wolves for a god damn hour if I have to until I have a full set of 6 slot bags.
---
Buying bags with the amount of money you initially get? Nooo thanks
---
I don't think your criticism holds up. Stating that the game is 15 years old and therefore has depreciated in value makes no sense. Blizzard still has to pay all the employees to make it playable on modern infrastructures and host all the servers. All of which is quite expensive. 
---
For my part I am at  a point in my life that I would not mind paying more to keep the game "pure". That being said I don't think they should charge more. I think they should just do an NPR style fundraiser when they need money. Classic wow has enough fiscally successful fans we would float it just fine.
---
Holy crap, i swear i have tears in my eyes, how i didnt see this before! Brilliant!
---
Black tabby cat ain't no joke
---
I was in high school during Vanilla.
---
I didn't farm the most efficiently, I was new to MMOs and didn't read up on much. But me and my girlfriend ran AV. Every. Fucking. Day
---
We'd jump circles all around stormwind and elwynn forest, go fishing, go mining/herbing for the 2-5 hour que times to get inside.
---
Then proceed to spend the next 7-10 hours inside AV. I'd go to school with 3 hours of sleep.
---
I still only got god damn lieutenant commander.
---
I'd do it all over again in a heartbeat, just be a bit more efficient this time around
---
Wow last time I checked they were only at a few hundred. Classic must have driven up the demand.
---
Yes and no. 
---
I'm going to be playing with as many RL friends as I can recruit into playing and at the end of the day that's probably the most important thing to me. 
---
But the lack of a raid scene on the server I pick is something that makes me nervous. One of the reasons I'm playing is to finally get past Princess H in AQ40 and do Nax, which I didn't get to do last time, but we'll see. I hope they announce server names in advance so people can coordinate and play together but I'm not sure if they will. 
---
Same here. I‚Äôm just glad that Classic is at least getting acknowledged. 
---
Well, they talked about "alliance zones", not "alliance buildings".
---
And the zone's atmosphere is not set by the few buildings. I like the moody forests. :)
---
But the most important part is the second line. Aesthetic is just subjective.
---
Yeah this is basically my plan. I‚Äôm going to experiment with every class. I‚Äôll get at least a few years out of Classic or more. 
---
&gt; Single off-specs won't matter all that much, but if you start stacking off-specs *and* people who don't farm consumables *and* people who do mistakes you are going to have a much harder time 
---
I mean yeah. Offspec or not, having bad people in your raid is gonna hurt.
---
My only point is, there is nothing justifying doing a crusade on reddit or the forums to tell people their class/spec is no good. This is a game, we don't fucking care. I went to mid AQ40 with very, very, veeeery bad players, it was mostly a TBC issue that we didn't go further. Other guys went up to naxx samewise, no consumes, keyboard turners, etc.
---
Was it suboptimal? Was it slower than mixmaxers? Probably yes. But again you know what I'm gonna say : We don't care, that's not the point. I'll never dare to tell someone what he should play, or tell them to change class or fuck off. I will do it the day we have 10 rets and 10 moonkins as our only dps in raids, exactly as I will do it if there will be 10 rogues and 10 warriors. Because that's ridiculous for many reasons.
---
Simply stop trying to argue and doing your crusade. You will find tons of hardcore people to play with. Don't be anxious. Just avoid destroying other ways of thinking.
---
Because they're so dominant and thus dominate the markets and wPvP?
---
Thousand needles to continue the blandness
---
It's going to be interesting. You have two groups of people; One who will want TBC to be eventually released again and those who want to keep 1.12 for the duration of the server. The problem is Blizzard hasn't commented about the future of Classic years down the line. I am assuming they are trying to gauge the success of Classic before committing any serious plans for the future.
---
The issue with keeping a life long Vanilla server is the population health. Can you imagine a server 2 years down the line? It won't attract new players. It sure as hell wouldn't attract me when everybody is in AQ gear and or has Naxx items. To keep a permanent Vanilla server for the long haul won't be pretty. I can see a scenario where Blizzard will officially move to TBC and then offer a few Vanilla server to stay around with free transfers. The other option is rebuilding more content for Vanilla Wow. I simply cannot see that happening. 
---
I imagine this entirely depends on how open the API is.
---
I dont think boobie kockdick, or whatever his name is, thinks of actiblizz as a democracy.
---
He seems to be more of a tyrannical dictator sort of chap to me.
---
I just switched from a wired one to the [Logitech G603](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhIbPVE3QVQ) - Wireless &amp; Bluetooth, with Optical sensor - here's [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B074KL48WC) link
---
* Next-gen HERO optical sensor for unrivaled performance and power efficiency delivering 500 hours of non-stop gaming. AA batteries required
---
* Advanced LIGHTSPEED wireless technology for super-fast 1 ms response time and faster than wired performance
---
If Classic is launched with 16 debuf slots and DM already out, then they've already screwed it all up lol.  And you people that think it's good that way are retail mongers that just want the easy way out as usual.  This is why the game is ruined in the first place, making it too easy for the carebears.
---
This would actually be really helpful. I spent quite a bit of Vanilla at the respec cost cap (want to say it was 50g?) and a single mis-click meant either doubling the cost for that cycle or dealing with a sub-optimal spec until I switched back. 
---
I would join a guild with the express purpose of griefing streamers.
---
Yes, I'm talking about the image OP linked. There are a lot of mistakes in it that isn't just a missing space. I will list some of them for you so that you can easily spot these in the future:
---
1. First and foremost, the big one: No reputable company will ever send you something like this out of the blue. Ever.
---
2. Second big giveaway is something you can't see in the screenshot but is guaranteed to be present: Hovering over the link will show you it doesn't actually lead to a Blizzard website. It'll likely look something like wowaccount-blizzard-verify-support.tk - usually a very long link that "looks legit" somewhere in the middle for a user who doesn't know where the so called "second level domain" is.
---
One big caveat here is that out of date mail program or browsers may display a different link than what it actually leads to, but modern mail software will block HTML unless you explicitly opt into it. (You should never opt into it!)
---
3. They ask for a "Classic Blizzard Account" email address. It's just a "Blizzard Account" and if they call it something else, there's a fairly high chance it's not legit. Exceptions are when they explicitly ask for the game account, but "Classic" is not a game, it's just a shortened form. Calling it Classic might fly in newsletters or similar, but not in account related emails like these.
---
4. They sign the mail with "Sincerely, Classic Games". This is the second biggest giveaway that you can see in the picture. There's no such thing as "Classic Games". They are Blizzard, Blizzard Entertainment, ActivisionBlizzard, etc.. A mass sendout would never be sent from a specific "team" or "category" like that.
---
5. The space right before the "Blizzard Support Site", as mentioned.
---
6. For important links, because modern mail software will block/interfere your ability to click links from unknown sources, large companies (aka companies that are aware of this, which Blizzard is) will not just have a single hyperlink to their website, but rather display the full URL so that you can opt to copy paste it instead. Examples from legitimate Blizzard sendouts: [#1](https://i.imgur.com/z87oimH.png), [#2 (a bit older, thus no blue background)](https://i.imgur.com/K8dAiOZ.png). This won't always be the case, and won't apply to every company, but Blizzard and other tech giants usually does this with critical links.
---
On their own you may think that, hey, people make mistakes, but important emails like these would undergo significant review before being sent out, so that they are easier to identify as legitimate emails. A single mistake like this might happen in an email every now and then, but never ever six of them at once, and they will never get their own name wrong.
---
I'll probably roll an alt on a server when Classic comes out, but not roll my main till a month or so after release and the dust has settled
---
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO PLAY, criteria:
---
* Class needs to have dynamic mechanics (mostly for leveling);
---
* Range or Melee doesn't matter;
---
* Has to be good to great leveler;
---
* I want the DPS role.
---
&gt; That's also mostly the same few elite guilds/groups of elite raiders who have been running MC for the last ten years. It's not something that most people would consider easy.
---
But those people also say MC fights have almost no meaningful mechanics, and most DPS specs have brain-dead rotations, so as long as everyone can do a very simple job the boss falls over.
---
&gt; Here's a video of the original Rag
---
How did I know you were going to bring that one up? It's like the entire pirate server community only knows two vidoes, "original Rag kill" and "this one priest making a C'thun video".
---
And no, I'm not doing your homework for you.
---
As I've said to pirate server supremacists before, if your outcome is profoundly non-Blizzlike it's not on me to debug your code and find the exact spot that there's a problem. It's on you to prove it's all exactly right.
---
&gt; The rogue in the video I linked uses Eviscerate instead of Slice and Dice and showed up to the raid specced CB/Prep. Yeah, most people were idiots.
---
You never played retail vanilla seriously.
---
In the first few months, sure, the game was unexplored. By mid-to-late retail vanilla people like Elitist Jerks had spreadsheets and analysis for every major aspect of the game and serious players all used them. And yes, we knew that +healing helped healing and downranking was useful and +damage helped damage.
---
You‚Äôll ball out in early end-game w MC and pre bid gear for frost isn‚Äôt that tough to get. 
---
It would be easy but he is prolly at work like me with youtube blocked.
---
All those Wow P servers eventually have to recreate a new server because the population dies out. I've seen this happen dozen of times now.  A 4 year old 1.12 server isn't sustainable IMO.
---
Mage probably the best.
---
Stun resist makes rogues never want to try you which is huge and a mindfuck for alliance rogues debating what they should do or what do they do when you resist their 5 pt kidney shot. 
---
Agreed. Gear sets for all the specs was great.
---
I've accepted that there is no such thing as a perfect server. Pretty much all I care about at this point is finding a high population PvP server. Preferably it doesn't have a lot of private server players on it, but that comes second to population.
---
Professional Game Designer here, been at it for 14 years.  I wouldn't say WoW influenced me (I was already making games at that point), but I can certainly see how it might inspire a generation!
---
The thing is the only personality type that ever wanted to play the rogue was the neck beard "super hero" kid. If the class isn't Op it's only audience is ggone lol.
---
At least Thousand Needles has some interesting quest locations above sea level.
---
I use the G700.  It's great because as a wireless mouse it's very similar performance-wise to a wired, but if the battery gets low, you can plug the charge cable into the front and use it as a wired mouse until the battery is full.
---
Nice try, Activision Rep.
---
I've played since vanilla 2005. I've played private servers on and off since 2009. I'm probably in a small minority but I haven't tired of the game yet.
---
Whatever Blizzard decides on, I'll keep playing Classic for as long as it is the better alternative.
---
Came in to post just this.
---
Me: "I know everything there is to know about Vanil-"  
---
... oh.
---
I think people have different interpretations of what vanilla 'was.' For me, I care less about every minute detail being historically accurate, and more about having the old world back and having a good playing experience. I don't want pet battles, I do want a guild bank and an updated mailbox, and I don't give a shit if there's a barber shop.
---
Ok. I'm genuinely curious how this would play out, not challenging your experience. If a frost mage is standing on a campfire and prepared to FAP is defending a base in AB, and he has ice block but not cold snap available, how would you go about taking it from him before his team arrives? I'm also curious about how the matchup would go against a bear druid or a hunter with flare and freezing trap down.
---
First of all my main response to you was your comment about scammers intentionally leaving mistakes. Nothing you called out it is an intentional mistake, the OP's email is not one of those scam emails. The things you've pointed out are things to look for in scam emails that *aren't* intentionally trying to weed out observant people.
---
1) Yes companies will send emails out of the blue (see the email I got an an example, in fact the email I got confirms that this classic teams email seems to be a pretty new endeavor for Blizzard).
---
2) Yes I'm aware of scrutinizing links, it's wasn't possible for an imagine
---
3) As per the image I provided, there are actually Classic Blizzard accounts (I have a couple for Diablo 2) so this is actually legitimate
---
4) Again, as per the email I've provided, the signature is again, legitimate
---
5) Yes I mentioned this, but again, as per the image I've provided, this is the same error from a legitimate Blizzard email (so much for that "significant review" before being sent out eh? :p)
---
6) Yes, I've already called out the out of the blue request to click a verify link it super sketchy.
---
So half of the "extremely obvious" items you listed are actually legitimate, the other two I already called out in my first response and the third is impossible to actually determine from an image alone. Thank you for the explanation though.
---
Curious, what do you do on Private servers once youve done allll the end game?
---
Means it will be a normal/regular pet without shadow damage.
---
Try these: &lt;Dafes PuG&gt;  
---
&lt;North American Allstars&gt;  
---
&lt;who cares&gt;
---
Not sure if they're actively recruiting, but they are popular raiding guilds. Also, keep an eye on the guild section of the forums.
---
Thanks my mans 
---
By that point a new fresh server is out, so you reroll and do it all again 
---
In game coordinates are based on the map of the zone you are in. Top left of the map is 0,0. Bottom right is 100,100. Middle is 50,50. If you were to overlay the zone maps over the world map you're creating, you could then convert them into your own coordinates system for your entire map. 
---
I leveled on RPPvP in TBC. For my server, no. High level Alliance would absolutely gank you, with no hesitation.
---
&gt; the OP's email is not one of those scam emails you referenced
---
[Here's a blue poster talking about _this exact email_ more than half a year ago, saying it's a scam.](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769487048#post-3)
---
So you're either one of these extremely gullible people, or you're one of the phishers.
---
How much longer would it take to level strictly by grinding mobs as a hunter as opposed to questing?   
---
I understand ganking, that's to be expected. I am curious if corpse camping and other forms of repetitive griefing are as bad.
---
I dunno what proportion of this sub play old school RuneScape, but isn‚Äôt it viable to draw attention to that in comparison?
---
The issue causing its release was that the original game (now RS3) was becoming unrecognisable from it‚Äôs roots with power creep and changing to mechanics - a very similar case to this, albeit with a different player base. This is why myself and a number of other moved away from both RS3 and WoW (quit just before Cata). Classic items, zones, and styles of play were all becoming irrelevant.
---
OSRS began on a hype, then dwindled due to lack of content updates and horrendous early 2000 mechanics. It‚Äôs now stable, larger than ever and growing thanks to QoL updates and fresh content which is minimal in powercreep, with the player base keeping updates in check through polls (though there are still issues with this). It‚Äôs been pretty cool to watch it happen. 
---
I think that‚Äôs the way to go down - maybe without polling, but in general walking the fine line between maintaining absolute relevance of old items and zones, while still introducing new content and actively balancing. 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be pretty cool to see a WoW which built *sideways* from Vanilla instead of up, further developing all those insanely cool story lines with fresh content that doesn‚Äôt make the ‚Äòold‚Äô irrelevant? 
---
Is it similar to retail where you can fish in higher level areas and gain skill points but you won't get any fish?
---
The retail fan base, which will jump ship to see what it's all about, want changes even though it's not what classic fans will want.
---
Oh I definitely got camped
---
I can't say as I'll play solidly and every day for the next 3, 5, 10, whatever years, but I'll come back to Classic and play in spurts for as long as they keep the lights on. I routinely go back and play Master of Orion, Panzer General, Final Fantasy (original NES version) etc. 
---
Part of my appeal with Classic is that if I'm off for a few months while I get distracted by the latest Total War, or its road cycling season, or whatever, I won't come back with the level cap raised yet again and all the items I'd raided for being worse than the new greens. Where I am when I last logged off is where I will be when I log back in, whenever that might be.
---
That's cool, cherry pick phrases and twist what I was saying. I never said the OP's email isn't a scam (it most certainly is), I said it's not the TYPE of scam you mentioned (the ones riddled with mistakes to filter out observant people)
---
Gonna get yourself banned asking about pservers 
---
What is this fight club 
---
That's illogical.
---
Have you read what theyre having to do for Classic and why they always thought it was technically impossible?
---
Theres a lot of hours being put into this. 
---
No its literally the first rule on the sidebar. 
---
okay this is epic, can i use this image.
---
Sorry, proof? Where?
---
Yikes
---
Sure buddy np.
---
&gt; which will jump ship to see what it's all about
---
Tourists, nothing more. How would you feel if they (Blizz) gate kept the "voting". Say for example, you have to have a level 60 on a classic server, and you must have played X amount of time in the last X weeks/days/months in order to be eligible to vote? 
---
Something along those lines would, IMO, stop retail players from attempting to mess up Classic by voting for bad things. 
---
That's very logical from the perspective of blizzard.
---
The low pop server fills up a bit more, and the queue for the high pop server decreases a little.
---
Blizz has always been pretty good about this. I have the CE of all 3 Starcraft 2 boxes (opened) and they make a very nice display all sitting together. 
---
This legitimate classic email I got about my Diablo 2 account
---
https://i.imgur.com/HGfYEBH.jpg
---
Which proves the signature from the classic team is legitimate, the grammatical error with the missing space is legitimate and that the reference to "Classic Blizzard Accounts" is legitimate
---
Exactly the same here.
---
That's one reason out of many why I didn't like the Nostalrius approach to content progression.
---
It's one thing to take out the Dungeon 2 set quest line, that I'm fine with because T0.5 is way better than T1 for most classes.
---
Readding broken shit that got nerfed for a very good reason to begin with? Well that's not exactly equal treatment is it.
---
Yeah, I mean you can be just as skilled as them but since most of us don't sleep for 5 hours and wake up by an alarm clock set so we can play 16 hours a day (yeah, some people do this) there is no way for us to keep up. And not wPvP but BGs as well, it's not fun to be thrown into games against a full premade in bis gear every time you just want to do some pvp.
---
That's the reason I prefer alliance.  I've spent multiple years playing both, and the alliance zones are just nicer to level in.  The only horde zone i actually really loved was stonetalon mountains.
---
And the impossibility was solved because someone had the old files on a USB stick or something, right? It's definitely a good bit of work but without having any asset creation or design needed it's mostly a technical task. 
---
&gt;Shadowmeld in classic can only be used out of combat.
---
And I never ever claimed otherwise. 
---
You on the other hand dont even know the difference between combat and the targetting function. It's funny watching you embarass yourself like this, trying to belittle my intelligence when you clearly couldnt be bothered to actually read the thread.
---
Try to look again at the post that sparked this discussion. Try to actually read it this time and maybe you will finally grasp what is being said here instead of just reacting to it and downvoting people that are correct.
---
&gt; Well for starters stealth can only be used in cat form so sits behind a global cooldown, whereas shadowmeld **can break target instantly**. You can also eat and drink in shadowmeld. 
---
Notice how it says **TARGET** and not **COMBAT**?
---
If you target me, and I use shadowmeld. You will lose me as your target. Insanely useful in PvP to dodge a polymorph, charge, initial fear or various other abilites.
---
Whats funny is you will probably not even have the balls to admit you were wrong, but will likely come up with some other nonsensical personal attack or some shit like that.
---
Lets think of ways to solve the problems...  
---
1. Nerf Lupos  
---
2. Increase his spawn timer to an absurd rate  
---
3. Wait for it.  
---
4. Waaaaaait for it.  
---
5. Make Lupos a 10 minute respawn.  
---
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?  
---
shit even the one in thousand needles took forever, and you just picked up them bad boys.
---
Isn't undercity new construction that they made underneath Lordaeron? 
---
I have played on 1.12 duel servers in perplexity's guild, so much for "crushing new players"...
---
Lol it‚Äôs been explained multiple times. 
---
Go for the kill instead of CC? He either 100% iceblocks and you reset and then wait for DRs and then cap if 2-3 teammates don't show up, or you kill him. Sap to cap, he iceblocks, then blind or rocket helm? There are so many possibilities. If 2-3 more teammates do show up, you just leave and harass another point, unless you manage to kill the mage and it's still a 2v2 you could stay forcing even more enemy to defend, since they have a defense deficit. It's not always about capping right now.
---
Hunter and his pet get CCed easier, and also die easier. Use the Skull to break yourself out of the trap, use taunt on the pet to break the hunter trap.
---
Hardest thing to handle would be the bear druid that is defending at max range. They can delay extremely well.
---
Hibernate is helluva drug.
---
Now we're getting somewhere. They probably took this email because it was so poorly written, and was originally sent out to [way more people than intended](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20770846969#post-9).
---
Anyway, this is some old legacy team doing old legacy things. The mail does not ask you to click any links out of the blue as I said and you tried to refute (why?), and where it refers to "classic blizzard accounts" it is clearly not talking about modern Blizzard Accounts, which is what the phishers will ask you for. It's a difference that lies in context but I can agree it isn't immediately obvious from the picture. They are also not the team working on Classic WoW anyway.
---
It's a terrible email and whoever wrote it will probably be talked to.
---
Reactivated my retail account with gold 3 weeks ago and I farm plants to be able to have enough token to play classic when it comes out
---
No. That shouldn't happen. Vanilla/Classic should never be changed.
---
Let me repeat: if it's changed, what then? Shall we petition Blizzard to bring it back *again*? It's stupid.
---
Vanilla is an important part of gaming (or even general) culture. It's a travesty it was destroyed and is not available. This is a unique opportunity which shouldn't be squandered.
---
Again, let me repeat: Fortunately I don't think Blizzard will do anything to it. They both understand what I've just written and also they won't spend money on it. The sane *business* decision is to bring back the expansions too and let people play whichever they want. Not trying to appease a small minority of players who all want different things anyway.
---
But after all that, I'll address your point too. Why do you think it would work in the slightest? Who would decide what to include in that "updated" WoW of yours? You? (Obviously not, sorry.) The players? (Blizzard is not exactly famous for listening to players. :) Also, the general player base has absolutely no idea what constitutes a good game. If they were, they would be successful game developers, no? They are a fountain of horrible game ideas. :) Blizzard? (The people at Blizzard who are developing WoW now are the one responsible for BfA. Do you want BfA 2? That's what you'd get. Old Blizzard is long dead. A lot (most?) of the people who are responsible for Vanilla WoW have left.) All in all it's just a very bad idea which also doesn't mesh with how Blizzard operates.
---
It's nothing to work off of, only that they are currently only focusing on Classic WoW. Their future plans are up in the air.
---
I'm mainly Horde, but still think Teldrassil is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. 
---
Forget it, 99% of people on this sub are clueless. 7/8 BF so he didn't even have the proc, also dragonfang is worse than the rag dagger. This is far from endgame...Btw, did you read what he said? "dEeEp fRoSt mAgEs cAn iCe bLoCk tWiCe, bLiNk and hAvE iCe bArRiEr." So much wow. It's  not like rogues can have double vanish, double blind and double imp. sprint with trinkets on top. 
---
No, the Undercity is existing construction in what used to be the royal crypts. Even if it were new construction it would have been constructed by Prince Arthas while he was using the space for Scourge activity.
---
Definitely looks like a phishing email, don't click the links!
---
Please don't listen to the insults or comments calling you gullible. Every computer user has a different background and knowing this stuff takes experience and education. Thanks to everyone who provided neutral feedback on why this is a scam, pat yourself on the back because you helped at least one person avoid being scammed in this way!
---
Another concern from an EU point of view is ending up on the 'wrong' national server...
---
Whilst in Vanilla, we had servers for German, French and eventually Spanish languages (and players), you would also have 'unofficial' national servers. There was this one server with majority Italian players for instance, where if you didn't speak Italian you would just be dropped from PUGs, /General and /Trade full of Italian and so on. There would also be servers with mostly Scandinavians, my own server ended up after a while with a large Polish population. Now some of these groupings speak decent English and are willing to communicate in it, however there are other groupings where English knowledge is not as strong and they will tend to be very insular of everyone not from their nationality.
---
So yeah, I am slightly concerned about inadvertently ending up on a server 'claimed' by certain nationalities.
---
&gt; How long has there been a Vanilla Pserver population? oh...since Vanilla? ok then.
---
 * pservers are free for the players
---
 * New pservers open up all the time, there is always a "fresh start".
---
 * many pservers offer 2x or even 10x xp
---
 * many pservers offer instant 60
---
 * many pservers have majority non-english speakers
---
 * pservers use old client which runs well on ancient computers whereas modern client does not
---
I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs much more hollow and lacks a resolution of any sort. Unlike the Ony thing. 
---
You saw an alternate timeline. As we know because of WoD alternate timelines are terrible.
---
Since I only played in tbc, I don‚Äôt know if that will still be viable
---
Im not trying to be funny, when i google what does cringe mean. I still dont understand.  So i hoped someone could explain
---
Spirit is still great for druids and priests especially who have a good chunk of passive mana regeneration from spirit while casting, and mages as well to some extent.  
---
The set bonus for t2 for druid also boosts mana regen while casting based on spirit, so between talents and the t2 bonus I think you get like 40% of normal mana regen from spirit while you're casting, plus whatever mana/5 you have on gear.  Spirit can be very helpful in raid PVE on its own, plus of course adding in JoW or mana totems. 
---
I think it‚Äôs likely a model edit done by the player. I used to do this ack in the day to change weapons and stuff but i never managed to create a new look like this.
---
Those are "simplified" coords to make it easier for the player I think. Not 100% sure on that. I think the games internal coordinates are a bit different, something like -17066, 17066, for instance. They get converted somehow to 42,49, as an example.
---
Hey similar story here, I used to make wow movies inspired by Noggaholic, and even made my own remake of that movie when I was quitting wow around the end of wrath called the last exploits. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6hEh4j5e8g&amp;t=27s

# INSTRESTYE ON A PINT
---
All those UI mods came out a few months after release. This SS is almost a full year after launch.
---
You are no one. You don't even have a rogue. You think rogues beat hunters. You don't even realize his vids aren't hemo. Just stop lying. Enjoy the ret paladin.
---
https://wowdev.wiki/ADT/v18 has a lot of information if you have not seen it yet.
---
You were called out. You have no rogue. We have armories to check on these servers. You are a fraud, a liar and mentally ill. Have a nice day. BTW good luck getting thunderfury on a rogue, especially when Blizzard will prob take the easy way out and go to TBC past vanilla. It was BIS for awhile for tanking. No one is giving that thing to rogues.
---
LOL the only server you played on is one that gives you all the gear. You never raided anything you don't know anything and you have no rogue. Go watch some more content creators so you can pretend buddy.
---
Where in my post does it say that hunters have an disadvantage versus rogues? Nowhere. Nevertheless, rogues can beat hunters and let's not even talk about reckadins. It's far from having no chance. It's very funny that you tell me what Perplexity would say about rogues while I have actually played together with him for months. 
---
That sounds right. I remember pally healing myself and the mana pretty much never ran out. 
---
Human. I'd hole up in the gardens in Stormwind. Because I am in no way trained to swordfight or magically zap any of the random wandering mobs in the world and I could not learn this in 24 hours.
---
Well there is a world map view in game, but the only coordinate information you can gather via the API is the X,Y coordinates as a percentage. Every data mined site uses the zone coordinates because it's the most accurate, and most suitable for players with coordinate mods which also use the zone map coords. 
---
Server side stuff might have their own coordinates system, but I don't know anything about that because it's not available through the API, and unless your data is from pservers, it wouldn't that useful to replicate. 
---
They would have to limit the voting to players that are actively playing Classic.
---
For real.  I mean, they *have* to announce this, right?
---
I am expecting like 20-30 IRL friends of mine to all try this game out, with perhaps 5-10 of us sticking it out long term.  Trying to all play on the same server would be impossible without some sort of advance notice.
---
Nah, they got rid of all of those people.  
---
It's why sharding for launch is the only acceptable option, IMO.
---
I dislike it as much as the next guy, but really, if the only other solution you have is *"merges/transfers after 6 months,"* aren't you basically just playing on a 6-month long shard at that point?  The entire argument revolves around a persistent world and a growing community.  Merges and transfers are far more destructive to in-game communities and economies than sharding for a week would be.
---
Oh I would go to STV so I could get ganked. 
---
Obviously it will be in it's nerfed state. 
---
Night Elf in Ashenvale or Tauren in Thunder Bluff üëçüèª
---
Not a huge amount longer, BUT you will miss out on quest gear, faction rep, and its boring. A combo of questing/grinding is generally regarded as fastest. Most speedrunners grind their way from objective to objective. 
---
Make my way to Goldshire...
---
Probably cos no one goes to Horde Zones...
---
not even the Horde.
---
Well according to some private servers, option 1 is blatantly out of the question.
---
What if instead of nerfing him, we just make his respawn 10 minutes? If every hunter has Lupos then surely he can't be overpowered?
---
I‚Äôve been waiting for classic to come out for the longest time now and haven‚Äôt been able to enjoy any games since the mention of classic wow. All I want is classic wow so I can play it forever. It‚Äôs hands down the best mmo in my opinion and satisfies all my needs. I do hope they add content that was cut though, but keep the values of vanilla wow. So realistically, classic will last forever.
---
Much like how it was back then, I'm assuming that there will eventually be low pop server transfers to get your character onto a more populated one.
---
My personal biggest fear is being on a server with streamers because I'm betting on them having armies of subscribers enabling the streamers to get the upper-hand. I'd rather be on a relatively medium population server like I was back in release (Elune); not too big, not too small, and just enough PvP and Raiding guilds.
---
haha I sort of felt the same way. Figured I would rather relax somewhere in the world, rather than do something dangerous. Stormwind is a good choice, you can also take the tram to see Ironforge and have a few beers!
---
&gt; Anyway, this is some old legacy team doing old legacy things.
---
Uhh, it's an official Blizzard department doing official things.
---
&gt; The mail does not ask you to click any links out of the blue as I said and you tried to refute (why even bother?)
---
What are you talking about? I know it asks you to click a link which (from my VERY first response to you), I've said was a huge red flag and very scam-like. I never once refuted this, where are you getting that from?
---
&gt; and where it refers to "classic blizzard accounts" it is clearly not talking about modern Blizzard Accounts
---
and? Actually if he recently made an account for starcraft 1 or Diablo 2 he WOULD get an email exactly like that and it would ask him to verify his classic Blizzard account so in that regard, it still might be a legitimate email with a legitimate request. The OP assumed (probably in correctly), that it was related to Classic WoW and his Blizzard account.
---
Gating it with time played isn't a good idea imo, can play a lot and want to change things, or play little and want nothing changed.
---
Level 60 is a minimum requirement for sure **if** it was a thing, maybe certain number of dungeons/bgs/raid bosses (not all, just like 20 BGs OR 5 raid boss kills OR 50 dungeons for example) to qualify and say you're actually doing content (to deter those who want "queuable content" for example).
---
I still don't think it should be in personally but just throwing ideas around. 
---
Hey guys. So I fully intended on making a sort of hype video for one of my favorite factions of vanilla, the Scarlet Crusade. However in the process it was all coming back to me how flawed they are, and i also kept thinking about how they ended up over the expansions as well. Wasnt helping their case lol. 
---
Figured i'd share the resulting video here. Had the Grand Crusader Dathrohan not been killed/possessed by Balnazzar (who corrupted the entire crusade with paranoia), they could have been legitimate saviors of humanity. Sad!
---
Walking fast...
---
So you dont see any value in knowing what one is getting into? Ok.
---
Hah that's the one!

---
World pvp is always fun for me. It feels good to come to Redridge and repel 60 hordies tormenting low levels. Fighting over important quest hubs like Ness camp in Vietnam Vale. Controlling end game zones so your guildmates can gather ore and black lotus. Twinking is also a lot of fun.
---
On pve side, you can try a new class, help out new guys with dungeon/raid progression (attunements and getting pre bis). I'd say you must do that because guild always needs fresh blood.
---
You can strive to become THE server enchanter/blacksmith/tailor etc. Being enchanter with all meaningful enchants is makes you a known player. Professions in classic can become your whole gameplay just because of how rewarding and satisfying it is after you put an effort in them.
---
All my points have one common thing. The community. It makes you keep playing because you naturally make friends and build a reputation on your server. It fulfills your natural need to be considered useful to society. That's why people ruined their lives over this game.
---
&gt; I think they should just do an NPR style fundraiser when they need money. 
---
Bruh.  Look, I agree with almost everything you said... I wouldn't mind spending more to play the game I want.  But I'm sure you can imagine the absolute shitshow that would ensue if Activision-Blizzard came out and said *"we need more money to keep this passion project alive, please donate for a good cause!"*  Given current attitudes towards the gaming industry and specifically Acti-Blizz, it would be the biggest PR failure in gaming history.
---
Hard to say. Wouldn't mind being a Night Elf in Ashenvale. Spend some time in a mana pool, catch a hippogryph to Auberdine, ride the boat to Darnassus and chill with some Treants and the Druids. I'd go to salute Tyrande, then jump off the side of the stump for the sickest dive anyone has ever seen.
---
Or a Dwarf in Ironforge. Head out and look over the mountain, and then head inside to ride the tram to Stormwind. From Stormwind, I'd head out to the river in Elwynn forest and try to become the leader of a murloc tribe.
---
Maybe an Undead Warlock in Scarlet Monestary, melting faces off and stealing the souls of those who hate me most before hearthing back to Orgrimmar and queing up with a battlemaster for Alterac Valley and fighting in a war.
---
Or best of all, a gnome warrior, tanking Onyxia and shouting, "I MAY BE SMALL, BUT I AM MIGHTY"
---
Good call on the IF tram and a tasty brew! I hadn't considered that. Main thing to look out for there is some real life ERP'ers getting their thing on in some dark corner of the tunnels.
---
I left out the "widescreen" bit from my comment.
---
yeah, 19-20", 1600x1200 displays were sorta popular by 2005, but widescreen displays still had ways to go, iirc the first easily commercially available 19-20 inch 16:10 monitors became available in late 2005-early 2006 and they weren't anywhere near 1920x1200 resolution. (1440x900 and 1680x1050, respectively)
---
Will you be leading the guild and raid again in classic?
---
&gt;Wrong. They scale better with level than most classes and are forgiving due to evasion / sprint / gouge / kidney shot / vanish. Warriors are hugely weapon reliant to generate rage when levelling. Bad RNG can cripple your levelling speed.
---
Warriors and Rogues are hands down the two absolute worst classes to level, with Rogues being slightly easier than Warriors. I have no idea what "scales better with level" is supposed to mean, but both of these classes have no ability to self heal outside of bandage, and they both have to facetank every mob due to not having ranged, spammable CC or a pet to tank for them.
---
It's funny you would claim the guy above is wrong when you dont seem to know much about Vanilla leveling.
---
Imagine being so mentally ill you lie about private server experience all because you want to promote "world of roguecraft" when you don't even know how to play the class or any other class. This conversation is done. You got called out, couldn't back up anything and got exposed as a liar. No point in continuing the conversation. Just going to block you. See you on your ret pally kiddie. J/K I don't play PVE servers. 
---
Most warriors never tank either. benzaw is simply an idiot who dont know what he's talking about.
---
You literally said exactly this lmao. 
---
Couldn't all those arguments have applied to OSRS as well?
---
Dwarf in ironforge so I could yeet myself into the lava
---
Shouldnt the main decision be which faction you want to play?
---
Both have their charms.
---
The barrens while flat and barren, it's in its name. It's supposed to be a flatland, with sparse vegetation where you find savage creatures. 
---
Which goes with the lore of the Orcs being invaders, they haven't had time to really set up entrenched positions in pretty areas, they just care about functionality. Whereas Alliance have basically been on Azeroth since creation. They have had time to develop vast cities in the best locations. And for the Night Elves, the World Tree is a sacred area, so of course they are going to set up around it. Magics seep out of it so of course the area around it is going to be sparkly.
---
So yes Horde areas might be more bland looking, but the areas are savage and barren, to go with the faction. They are savage and will fight tooth and nail for every scrap or resource. 
---
&gt;I still don't think it should be in personally but just throwing ideas around.
---
Same, the only reason why I threw out a time gate keep was because I think that the people who genuinely enjoy Classic will be the ones playing Classic, and those are the ones I'd want voting if anyone. 
---
But I think that having/being level 60 should be a requirement. That in and of itself, while not difficult, does take some level of dedication that I don't think a lot of people who'd want to purposely sabotage the game would be willing to do just for the sake of messing with the Classic fan base, but then again this is 2019 and people troll like it's their job so...(shrugs)
---
I actually just tried making a new Diablo 2 account and guess what? I get the EXACT same email the OP got so it could very well be 100% legitimate (maybe him or a relative or friend signed up for a classic blizzard account using the email address he uses). Here's the legitimate Blizzard email I got.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ehyI3mQ.jpg
---
So much for it being an "obvious" scam email...
---
&gt; What are you talking about? I know it asks you to click a link which (from my VERY first response to you), I've said was a huge red flag and very scam-like. I never once refuted this, where are you getting that from?
---
Here's what I wrote:
---
&gt;First and foremost, the big one: No reputable company will ever send you something like this out of the blue. Ever.
---
What you responded:
---
&gt;Yes companies will send emails out of the blue (see the email I got an an example
---
You perhaps just misread what I wrote (emails _like this_, implying not just any kind of email). Obviously companies will send out emails... that was never up for debate.
---
&gt;Uhh, it's an official Blizzard department doing official things.
---
[...] Actually if he recently made an account for starcraft 1 or Diablo 2 he WOULD get an email exactly like that and it would ask him to verify his classic Blizzard account so in that regard, it still might be a legitimate email with a legitimate request. The OP assumed (probably in correctly), that it was related to Classic WoW and his Blizzard account.
---
The classic games team at Blizzard works with systems that are some 20 years old, and are probably just not held to the same level of scrutiny. 
---
Just because a team at Blizzard once sent out an email which actually matched 2-3 or so of the warning flags, does not mean they aren't warning flags.
---
55pfs in 2005? Yeah no way thats has to be from private server. I had 512mb ram ddr2 with geforce 6600GT and barley get 30fps...
---
That and it kinda ruins that whole blizzlike thing.
---
Progressive itemization is great if it‚Äôs left at items only.
---
Try to read?
---
The wand battles between casters when they‚Äôre both OOM always cracks me up. 
---
Awesome vid. I miss playing WoW, however, it was a time consuming game. 
---
He asked what the best race was so I mentioned undead if he goes horde or gnome if he goes alliance 
---
I‚Äôm creating a whole new battle net account. Full on fresh start. 
---
Yeah i was joking around. Cringe is bad.
---
I was working out in my yard doing some landscaping one day and two squirrels got pissed and started trying to attack and chase me.  My WoW character would kill them with one punch.  Me?  I‚Äôm not about to try and fistfight a squirrel so I ran inside.  
---
Now imagine how I‚Äôd fare against dragonkin...  Not well. 
---
A company using a department name in an email from said department is not a warning flag nor is referencing a specific account type.
---
Yes you're correct that getting an account confirmation warning out of the blue is definitely a warning sign (I've never denied this), I was simply saying that companies do send emails in general out of the blue (iewhen they identify unusual activity or attempts of account theft). They usually have instructions to follow but don't usually provide links to click.
---
I want the cap to be 3500. I want it to be very crowded but not insanely so but that might just be me.
---
There are classic accounts actually and yes there are places to sign up for them.
---
Wow I hadn't thought of it that way. 
---
Same dude, I'll be there for launch but I'm positive my progress will slow immensely once I hit early 20's. Could be half a year to 60 for me, but what a time! xD
---
I‚Äôve never done any talent work but when I get home I‚Äôll try and see if the API allows this.  Should be easy if it does ‚Äî I can toss it up on github tonight or tomorrow if so. 
---
Night elf, not gonna tell you, and don't think I can say on this subreddit.
---
I just signed up for a Diablo 2 account as a test and I got the exact same email. Is it possible anyone you know that uses that account just created a Diablo 2 account (or maybe Warcraft 2?). If so you would have gotten a legitimate email to verify the owner of the Classic account that was just created.
---
It's also possible scammers took that format and inserted their shady links.
---
Yeah cause not having to bug other people / spend gold for your own water and having free mana cooldowns is the worst thing 
---
Omg lmaaaaao roflmaaaaaao
---
Then don't misclick.
---
&gt; TBC sucks. 
---
Whoa that‚Äôs a first. 
---
"some fucking amateurs"... They were not amateurs wtf
---
But that's not out of the blue? You or someone you know requested that email... not sure what part of this is so difficult to understand.
---
Thanks a lot. And yeah it certainly was, but the the amazing lore, factions and world made it feel gratifying to be a part of!
---
It's not 100% scam, this is the exact email the Classic team uses to verify newly created Classic Blizzard Accounts (Diablo 2 at least, maybe Warcraft 3 and non-remaster starcraft).
---
Either someone who uses that email created a Classic Blizzard Account or a scammer replaced the verify link with their scam link.
---
So yes there's a chance it's a scam, there's also a chance it's legitimate (neither case has any relevance to Classic Wow though)
---
Play some Oblivion!
---
Makes sense! Even cooler backstory that way imo 
---
Removed per rule 1. Private server footage not allowed. 
---
What are some of the biggest examples if theyre not even close? 
---
I vaguely remember reading something about how they were more rushed for time with the Barrens in comparison to how much time they invested in Elywnn forest. But I could be going crazy.
---
Vanilla wow wise (loved blood elf areas in bc) as a whole I feel like you're right but as some other people said it's to do with lore.
---
Funny stuff! I would have loved to hear more about all the characters in the thumbnail
---
Interested in some commission work when Classic comes?  
---
&gt; Pretty much every class was significantly stronger in 1.12 than in previous patches, which makes 1.12 hunters with pre-nerf Lupos stronger than any of their actual iterations during live vanilla had been.
---
That contention is a bit questionable. Hunters got their new talents as of a patch 1.7. In 1.9 the damage on Bestial wrath was REDUCED, though it was granted disorient immunity and a longer duration. Although in 1.9 hunter's unleashed fury talent was buffed as well. Further, ranged weapon normalization to 2.8 speed occurred in 1.10, which is another nerf to hunters.
---
So 1.8 hunters had compared to 1.12 hunters: higher damage on multishot and aimed shot (due to no normalization) and a bestial wrath that did higher damage (though it lasted less time, and didn't give disorient immunity, and pets just did innately less damage due to unleashed rage). It's not entirely clear to me that the 1.12 iteration is better than the 1.7/1.8 iteration.
---
&gt;Due to the fact that pretty much all private servers emulate 1.12, introducing a non-1.12 change such as prenerf Lupos is not particularly blizzlike and has a noticable impact on game balance.
---
This is a stronger argument against stuff like progressive release in general. Having a warrior top the charts in MC when that's the only raid available (because they're able to use 1.12 talents, instead of the pre 1.6/1.8 changes) is significantly less blizzlike than whatever this Lupos change is. 
---
I think the facts that:
---
* Servers are official, so people don't feel guilty or scared about playing them
---
* Servers are not likely to be shut down for copyright issues, so people aren't worried about losing progress
---
Will lead to players joining and staying longer than they do on private servers.  2 years into the launch of a private server, how many new players does it have?  WoW classic will have someone that goes "I keep seeing this when I log in to Overwatch, I'll give it a try". 
---
With all that said, the biggest MMO killer is when the servers are dead.  So if there's constantly a fresh onslaught of new players, that will help retain new and old players alike.
---
Try and stay on topic, we're not talking about emails out of the blue, we're talking about the email possibly being legitimate.
---
as long as your mom does, ZING.
---
Definitely read that, along with this:

---
TBC private servers fail every time for a reason. They have raids that are decent but if you already have done them you get bored halfway through progression. The small vocal minority who lauds TBC never even cleared anything outside Kara. They just want to "win" TBC this time, but they won't. TBC required being a no life for only raiding, with no light at the end of the tunnel for anything else.
---
TBC Classic would bomb. WOTLK would do well because Arena wasn't totally awful in it and it's stream friendly.
---
I rememeber the scarlet leader/admiral Westwind in Northrend also got possessed by a demon lol. Whole organization cant catch a break anywhere.
---
&gt; A company using a department name in an email from said department is not a warning flag nor is referencing a specific account type.
---
It is though, when it's something as generic as "Classic Games". And the "specific account type" in this case was covered in my first list as something that could indeed exist if there was something called "Classic". 
---
&gt;[stuff] (I've never denied this)
---
Except you did specifically reply to that point in order to "correct" me or something when I said it. Literally nobody was claiming companies never send emails out of the blue. They just don't send you emails _like that_ out of the blue, specifically.
---
I'd assume that this is an example of where the new API might conflict with old game data? Maybe there are some functions that only point to spell ID's etc, and can be used to reference talents. I'm interested in seeing what you come up with. I've never looked to deep into the new API but I do know that a lot of it's classes and methods are used to reference modern data. Keep us updated if you find anything useful!
---
1. The vast majority of people who long for classic wow have $15 a month of disposable income. 
---
2. There‚Äôs nothing stopping blizzard from opening new servers. 
---
3. 2x, 10x, and instant 60 would reduce longevity, not extend it
---
4. Many pservers also have way, way higher pop caps than vanilla servers
---
5. You have zero clue what hardware will be required for vanilla.  The overall game systems are nowhere near as complex which greatly reduces hardware strain.  Old spell details also have far less particles, etc..
---
Are they even going to do a beta?
---
A lot of people think the devs woke up one morning and said "Hey, let's implement sharding for kicks".  That's usually not the case - sharding is generally in response to performance issues.  WoW is 14 years old, it's grown quite a bit - Vanilla quests and content are (relatively) simpler mechanically than retail's.  It's likely over the course of development, the devs began to push the envelope to see what sort of content they could make - this also likely began to impact performance to the point where sharding was deemed a necessity in order to give developers freedom to build newer and different content.  
---
Current server architecture has evolved quite a bit over the last decade; the devs who are saying we might need sharding may not know for certain until they start running stress tests.  They're preparing people for the worst case scenario, but there's a scenario where due to the improved code base of retail coupled with the improved server architecture and hardware that running classic would be like running Simcity 2000 on a modern PC.  
---
I'm not saying sharding ISN"T a possibility, but if I were to wager a guess, I'd say their plans for sharding are simply preparing the community for a possibility.
---
I haven't played retail wow since WOTLK but didnt they eventually make it so people could be whispered through the bnet tag ID? If that's the case how does a unique naming server convention work?
---
5 man Horde
---
Warrior, Warrior, Warrior, Warrior/Rogue, Shaman
---
Tank Optional, just bounce around who holds aggro.
---
No, we never were. If OP didn't trigger the email, then it's not legitimate. Even in the extremely remote chance that someone else created the account, he should _obviously_ not click the link since then any accounts related to his email could land in trouble if whoever created the email has ill intent.
---
Dell 2405FPW came out summer 2005, I got one on sale during an after-christmas sale in January 2006 (it replaced the aforementioned 2001FP). It was 1920x1200 and 24". It actually just died about a year ago (DC failure I think). You are right though, it was expensive, around $900 + tax, after discounts.
---
You just need to tag them/be a part of the kill
---
The concept you're looking for is art references. The designers for each zone were given them. OP has found an art reference for Stonetalon.
---
Depends what it is, I have quite a few addons that I‚Äôm writing on the old 1.12 backend that I also have ported to current release, that way both APIs are covered as we aren‚Äôt sure how limited in scope the classic API will be.  
---
Feel free to shoot me a PM though. 
---
Thanks. Yeah I was kind of thinking of recreating the old threads and getting people who were still active to talk and chat, maybe even find someone I used to know. Daily threads aren't that active though it seems so I'll just have to search.
---
Also, huh, Candyland patch, I think I must have quit shortly before that because I've never heard that before.
---
**Paladin, Druid, Mage**
---
I like the combo suggested of Paladin/Warrior/Mage.  This gives you less gear overlap.
---
However, in this scenario you'd be tanking on the druid.
---
Undead Brill area is pretty cool looking imo. But I love chilling around goldshire it's all bright and pops well
---
The whole top row are actually rare spawn bosses with no real substantial lore. All of them appearing in the graveyard wing iirc.
---
However there are many scarlet leaders outside of the monestary (and thumbnail) that i may end up doing a more serious video on. Inquisitor Fairbanks, the undead guy bottom right, i shouldve touched on.
---
And thank you!
---
I work 8-5 Monday thru Friday and every other Saturday 8-12. I'm married with two children. My plan is to play most nights after the kids and wife go to bed. Hoping to play from 8:30-9 PM to 11:30-Midnight minimum. I don't plan on getting Rank 14 and I don't see a way I could even if I wanted to. 
---
&gt;How do you guys plan to balance playing time with your job?
---
Play when you can, don't be a shut in -- and spend your limited time wisely until you're 60 and then just do whatever you feel like.
---
&gt;Are certain grinds (e.g. rank 14) even possible with a 9-5?
---
Anything above R12 I would consider not possible. Other insane grinds like getting the AQ legendary mount too I would not even bother with.
---
&gt;Also, how to balance work plus a significant other with WoW?!? 
---
Make your significant other play with you.
---
My plan is to get my four characters (solo rogue, main shaman, bank alt, and 39 twink) all to about level 10 in the first week.  Take some reasonable amount of time off work as a mini-stay 'cation to play a lot to get it out of my system, then play semi-casually after that.
---
My main focus will be playing my Shaman when buddies are on, playing my rogue when I'm solo, and getting as much out of rest XP as possible. The bank alt and twink I'll level up to 35 and 39 respectively by just playing them when I'm fully rested to spend as little time possible leveling them.
---
BlackRock mountain
---
That one is nice as well, if you want to read some source for a working map for reference you can check https://github.com/Marlamin/WoWMinimapBrowser
---
Some combinations of stats are bad.  But while you're leveling, something like "of the Boar" or "of the Whale" (str + spirit or stam + spirit) are very good for a warrior.  Because you heal up more while you're running to the next mob.
---
I got ridiculed in WotLK for wearing a spirit trinket on my Paladin, who got nothing out of spirit.  The reason I wore it is the other effect reduced the mana cost of my spells, and when spamming full force added up to quite a bit of mana savings.
---
I think it has to do with the fact that EK races tend to be more classical fantasy (castles, keeps, villages) which is greatly appreciated, while Kalimdor are a bit more tribal in nature (excluding nelfs). 
---
Tolkeinesque references can be seen on both sides, however it‚Äôs obvious Blizz initially wanted the Horde to seem more nomad; Horde settlements often consisting of 1-2 main buildings and the rest just improvised tents.
---
Personally i think Horde architecture would‚Äôve been much more pleasing had they used more ‚Äúfarm‚Äù buildings instead of tents. The Orc Burrow from WC3 is in the game, but used rarely. They could‚Äôve made a few more variants of it (like with door closed or in ruins), but that‚Äôs neither here nor there.  
---
WC2‚Äôs pig farm would‚Äôve also been a viable option, but for some reason it was completely overlooked. Perhaps it was due to it being hard to justify a tree-trunk house in a barren land; still could‚Äôve made an appearance in Stonard though.
---
In contrast, alliance has multiple buildings, often with differenciating interior decorations.
---
Don't private servers restart after 6 months or so? From what I gather most people that play private servers reroll servers when Naxx releases. Is this true? If so why do you think classic will last for years without new servers releasing? 
---
Never tried that, sounds kind of fun. My buddies and I used to 3 man Emperor runs in BRD with a Tauren Druid, Tauren Warrior and Tauren Shaman. I was the Shaman and was on totem and heal duty. The other two took turns getting aggro/DPSing. Druid would innervate me as needed.  
---
Jokes on you.  I have blackout curtains.
---
You have completely missed the point.
---
 * Pserver and classic are two different demographics. Yes they overlap but no they are not the same.
---
 * Nothing would kill Classic faster than Blizzard opening up new servers as frequently as new pservers pop up. 
---
 * Increased XP increases tourism, which is vital for keeping the population up over time (which is what you are arguing, that pservers have had a consistent healthy population for the past 13 years [which they haven't, but that is another argument]).
---
 * pserver player cap is irrelevant
---
 * server hardware requirements are irrelevant
---
rank 14 isnt gona be possible with a 9-5. its atleast 12-16 hours a day the last few ranks. ( if i remember right ) and if they increas the amount of players per server it might require a little more.
---
Its up to you. what do you want to do in wow? by going your own pace you will find out what you can and cant do. Hard core rading will maybe be dificult, but you can allways find a nice casual rading guild that fits you more if your into raids. or you will allways have a few premades you can join in pvp if thats your style.
---
I work an office job, i live at work 3 days a week basically. But ill still be installing the game on my work pc and be able to play the Auction House from work, ( not gona do much, since i still have to work ) . Im just gona test the waters and see what i can and cant do :) 
---
Yeah dopefish and 'exploration the movie' really blew my mind when I first saw it! Thanks to him I started exploration too, I wonder if my path would have been different, if it wasn't for his movies.
---
And I have to agree, the whole warcraft universe is a great source of inspiration!
---
used to work 9-5 (accounting) then I started my own online business (digital marketing, social media ads) then now I am working at my own pace from home lol.
---
I am so ready for wow classic
---
I haven‚Äôt played since 2005, but recently I had a ticket created to find my character on the server Shattered Hand. No luck, I still remember my username and password. 
---
I was hunter with tier 2 gear before I quit. 
---
&gt;To me, EK is "le fantasy xD", while Kalimdor is truly Warcraft.
---
The most accurate description I've ever seen.
---
Nice watched the whole thing.
---
Oh yeah I knew what you meant, I just have never seen anyone actually say it.  Normally people go insane with nostalgia at the thought of TBC servers, but either didn‚Äôt raid or fail to remember the insane amount of consumable farming that came with it.  I spent more time on elemental plateau than I did doing anything else in that expansion combined. 
---
You sir, are truly retarded.
---
Some years i hope. I would love a TBC release aswell.   
---
But. I'm not only going to play Classic for its raids, dungeons etc.   
---
I wanna do some real world event. Huge lvl  1 raids!  2 full raid groups going to ogrimmar or whatever! Stuff like that happend in vanilla tbc etc.. Before all this  "Phasing" 
---
Their bis weapon is a consumable. Its a 2h mace from gnomer that has increased attack speed on use.
---
I never played a Night Elf so I didn't even consider how awesome that experience would be!
---
Yeah you can whisper via Battle.Net tags. You can also still whisper on an individual server by your character's name.
---
BNet tags would be people you have added to your friends on Battle.Net, and you whisper random people out in the world by their unique character names. You could also whisper your friends by their character name if you wanted.
---
BNet chats show as blue in the client, and whispers are still the classic purple color.
---
The autism is strong within you.
---
For me, I think the answer boils down to how you define godliness, and this is a little long winded, so please, bear with me.
---
First off a little background, I see other comments in this thread saying that mages scales poorly in terms of damage and I'd like to address that while answering your question as best I can.
---
YSK, single target spells with cast times scale based off of their cast time relative to 3.5. 3.5 base spells have a 1:1 spell to damage ratio ignoring modifiers- so frostbolt is 3/3.5 which is the same as shadow/lightningbolt. This also means mage has access to what is the highest single target spammable nuke (discount pyro cause you cant really spam it): fireball, which clocks in at 3.5 seconds.
---
Now all of that is ignoring that mages have some of the best crit scaling in the game coupled with pretty nutty range- ignite or ice shards are nuts coupled with shatter  are terrifying with endgame stats + shatter. Furthmore it IGNORES the fact that of the casters they get the best possible upgrades for their AQ20 books- two nukes and arcane missiles (I could see an argument for warlock).
---
Moreover when you compare early caster items, like mana igniting cord, a belt from MC, with later items like eyestalk waist cord, a belt from C'thun, you see a clear trend in caster itemization- more damage- less raw stats- these "BIS" endgames pieces have enormous amounts of spell power. When you look at the mage kit it excels at using what becomes an enormous mana pool in tier 3 to negate damage- through wards and shields and blocks you negate the burstiness of other late game casters.
---
All that being said- despite the obvious merit for mage damage, in pvp mage is not going to be this juggernaut- in a world where an SL lock can roll into town, take no damage, and facetank 3 people at a time if their opponents are undergeared. In fact, mage will get 3 shot if they swagger up to the wrong target. But you can pick those fights as mage with the kit for control that is your largest selling point.
---
Are you going to kill the SL lock in a "fair 1v1" where you try to duke it out mono e mono?
---
Fuck no, but is a god (apart from Ares I guess) really a juggernaut?
---
Personally I think the better question is, are you going to be the class with the highest damage potential relative to survival tools in the game, the same caster with an enormous amount of CC (the most of any classes kit) to the point where you can pick 99% of their fights and disengage from those you deem unwinnable at will?
---
Fuck yes. And to me that choice- that ability to dismiss the mere mortals who would knock upon the steps of your temple- who cannot move or speak without your say so (I'm looking at you, nova and silence), you have my answer as to what godliness entails.

One warrior pulls aggro, just weapon swap to a shield, the other warriors furiously mashing away with WF will invitably pull aggro, at which point hot potato shield swapping continues.
---
The rogue is there for cheap shot - kidney shot stun lock combo, mobs will die under 10 seconds so its a form of CC in that regard.
---
Nah feral is actually one of the easiest classes to gear, especially in classic. DM quest has BIS weapon that is &gt; rank 14 for cat. The time required is learning the gimmicks and making macros. The gimmick is a level 40 crafted blue BOE leatherworking helm that is BIS throughout vanilla and shifting to get the energy from it.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=8345](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8345)
---
As to why it wasn't really viable in real vanilla. That helm originally came out in the Naxx Patch. You can easily find videos from private with something like "feral rotation vanilla" or something. It's no harder than watching autoshot on a hunter to make sure you don't clip or 2 hander warrior dps with slam or sword spec rogue not clipping for more sword procs.
---
If you want to play feral play it. Just research it a bit, find the macros. Nothing is wrong with feral in 1.12/Classic. With DM at launch they will actually be pretty insane.
---
Nah its just a random orc his name is Pete. He just knows how to be one with the trees.
---
Well there's no chance in hell that I would leave a safe area. So I would probably pick Night elf, run as fast and carefully as I could to Darnassus and check out the female Night elves.
---
I'm pretty sure that's what a majority would do
---
lol!! 
---
Pladan
---
This is true in pvp, but very wrong in pve.
---
Mages are much better once they go fire, and are top dps with locks/wars/rogues.
---
Most of BRD is really a lvl 57 instance. As long as the warrior and healer have some decent blues they should be able to 2h dps tank almost the whole thing, which is probably going to be about 3 -4x the dps of going tank.
---
Whitemane's gams are the only redeeming quality of the scarlet crusade.
---
&gt;Thick thighs save lives, but thigh highs are my demise.
---
The demo for Classic has sharding....
---
I wasn't aware characters were ever deleted on their end. What'd they say? T2 in vanilla was no joke man.
---
There is itemization that needs to be considered, like every class. Special considerations to be made due to not getting weapon enchant procs and getting a helm that gives 20+ energy every shift, etc...
---
But mainly people talk about how rogues just have to do sinister strike and slice and dice and do decent on the meters with minimal effort. Ferals need to know which mobs can be bled, powershifting for extra energy gain in a small time window, and competing with full DPS classes for same agility loot. 
---
Even being the best feral going crazy with shifting and spamming they'll do about a medium skilled rogue's amount of damage. 
---
Druids offer innervate/rebirth/offtanking and clutch heals which is hard to quantify. Plus they're a lot of fun. 
---
Makes complete sense. When I played private server I had a group of 4 I played with that was Mage, Priest, Warrior and Rogue; Warrior and Rogue bounced the aggro back and forth and stunned as needed. Worked very well. Priest didn't have to heal all that often outside a hard hitting boss.
---
I play in the evening and on weekends, like any other game. WoW is not that different. 
---
Of course without the PvP grind. Rank 14 is insane.
---
There is no big plans, I just play whenever I want. 
---
Where the fuck did I say that he uses hemo spec? No where. Please get back on your meds.
---
The Horde are the outcasts from the other side of the tracks.
---
I agree, with the exception of the few harder hitting mobs in which case the mob will still die within the same basic time frame from the other extreme WF melee dps, really its just to benefit the healer so they don't have to stop for mana.
---
your explanations tho? Lol. They‚Äôre brutal.
---
Please tell me you‚Äôre not a teacher or something. The kids would be doomed 
---
Human paldin, ride gryph all over, then jump and buble-heart to nearest dwarf inn
---
1. Do you have any sources backing up that claim?  It may not be a 1:1 conversion but the overlap is high. 
---
2. Sure if they released 2 or 3 new servers every few months.  They know there‚Äôs a substantial base that plays solely for new servers though, if it‚Äôs big enough to be a problem like you claim then it‚Äôs big enough to address.  Those servers always flopped hard because they were literally released solely for the chronic reroller.  They had negligible impact on the true servers. 
---
3. Pservers also don‚Äôt have the marketing and resources available to blizzard.  What is considered a ‚Äúhealthy population‚Äù?  The hype surrounding classic mixed with it being something to officially do within content lulls will drive classic tourism, and those players will probably contribute more time than someone using a modified computer gain server to hit level 45 before getting bored and never playing again. 
---
4. Server caps introduce region locking, which private servers don‚Äôt have.  Server caps also change what is regarded as a ‚Äúfull‚Äù or ‚Äúpopulated‚Äù server - losing all of the foreign accounts will likely still result in a server being full by blizzard numbers. 
---
5. So you said the old engine runs on ancient computers but then say server hardware requirement is irrelevant?  Did you miss my point?
---
Rank 14 no. Classic is not like scuffed private with warlord gear off the bat that is post patch itemization. It will come out in Classic with BWL gear which it's about equal to. Tier 1/2 is also VERY easy so anyone can get it.
---
Rank 10 if you just hate raiding and refuse to do it, is decent or close to tier 2 on a lot of classes and you can farm it very casually. You can get weapons that are decent through BG ranks. The 2 hander for ret, enhance warriors is really easy to get from AV and really good. 
---
Vanilla is more casual friendly than modern WoW to be honest. As long as you don't play a warrior. They are a class that actually changes how they play with gear. I would avoid unless you play to either raid regularly or rank pvp high.
---
That sounds interesting - were you able to enjoy the game without analyzing it too much? I am asking this because I'm kind of glad that I was able to experience it as a naive teenager.
---
Is that so?
---
In that case...
---
I have a fantastic investment opportunity for you. My father is the deposed king of Wakanda and I need to help save him from the shrinkelderps that are invading his kingdom. I need you to mail me a packet of biscuits and a the VHS Box Collection of Friends seasons 1 through 5. They stole all of our DVD players.
---
I work from 3pm-12am so I‚Äôm going to be doing that peaceful late night grinding when I get home. I‚Äôm excited for the full night cycle as I look forward to wondering into Duskwood with only lamps illuminating the way. I plan on playing for 3 hours a night and I have a gaming laptop so I‚Äôll probably play around on my 1hr lunch break as well. 
---
A little bit, but for the most part I was also mainly just playing to enjoy it - I find when I first began developing games, I analyze everything, and I mean EVERYTHING.  But after a point, you figure out how to 'turn it off' so you can just go back to playing them for fun.
---
That's not how I would make the appeal if I was the dev. I would basically make the appeal to the effect of the reason why Activision isn't forcing me to destroy your game is because I can show a profit stream. 
---
It would be smart for the Classic devs to play the roll of a man with a gun to their head. Which isn't untrue.
---
There are only a couple of 1h maces in Vanilla (aside Ateish) that give +120-180 AP while in animal forms that I would consider to be better, but with every buff in the game min-maxed for pve, supposedly burning through [Manual Crowd Pummelers](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449) is better.
---
If people are that dedicated, then sure -- but for those more sane definately go for the high +AP animal form weapons.  Prior to getting those, any stat stick with high raw stats and +crit are good.
---
That's sort of what I'm working with. I have the minimap pngs and stuff, but I'm working with some more software in attempts to actually map the high res imagery so we can have the coordinates on a "Google maps" like map.
---
Go install Diablo 2, create an account and tell me what email you get from Blizzard....
---
I already ruined my account by giving everything worth anything + my gold stash to one of my friends that still played last year.
---
I will just buy a year or something for me and my friends.
---
Ok, I will probably ask for details on that switch again in summer.
---
Yeah, I would bet about 80 percent of the people talking about how great TBC is never got out of Kara and started in TBC and actually liked the VANILLA leveling experience that was still there. The other 20 percent are just really hardcore PVE'rs that hate PVP. They will get bored of TBC by the time they hit Hyjal and go back to the modern game. The modern game was made for them, by one of them (Ion). That's why it sucks. Want a modern TBC play BFA. It's the same thing. Bad PVP, bad wpvp, bg's that are pointless, healers that make the game not fun and all that matters in the bg due to a failed minigame and CC chains and a focus on raids. Ion recreated TBC. It sucked then and it sucks now unless all you care about is raiding. 
---
Minimum of 2 years of content. MINIMUM.
---
2 Years is already highly rushed. If you only play 1 Character. Imagine you also want to Twink. Then we are easily talking about 3-4 years.
---
Which makes people asking for more content right now, a little bit insane.
---
It was weird, because I no longer used that email account or had the same payment account. I realized to log in you had to use your email account, which was not the case when I was playing. It was username and password, which I still remember. 
---
In the end they said they couldn‚Äôt find my character. Sucks, because all my friends got back into it. I heard it‚Äôs extremely easy now. 40 man raids were epic. BWL, MC, and Zul Grub were so much fun. 
---
I loved the pvp aspect as well. I fought for the horde, so I always felt like the underdog. 
---
&gt; If OP didn't trigger the email, then it's not legitimate
---
The OP could be one of multiple people using the email meaning it *could* be legitimate. If the OP knows he's the only person that uses that account and he didn't recently create an account for a Classic Blizzard title then yes, it's not legitimate. Only the OP can answer that question and determine it's legitimacy, not me or you. The difference is I'm not saying the email is legitimate or not while you are and neither of us can know.
---
The topic of discussion was pvp. Mages are top tier dps throughout all of vanilla pve. 
---
Personally I would add in PvP list Orc for Rogue (it's really hard to define what's better) and switch to UD for Mage.
---
Regarding DPS it's a bit more complicated since on different content stages you can get different answers and it can differ according to your raiding environment and playstyle. 
---
But I would switch Warlock to UD due to WoTF (aka being feared = DPS loss) higher base Int stat (1 point more lol), and Shaman to Troll if Elemental, and Tank warrior (if TPS-oriented) to troll.
---
Please do not reproduce. Don‚Äôt be selfish. 
---
Farming that stupid pummeler is the worst. It‚Äôs a lot easier if you‚Äôre alliance though. I don‚Äôt understand how horde druids can bother with it. 
---
&gt; It is though, when it's something as generic as "Classic Games"
---
Except it's not, especially when Blizzard has specifically branded their classic games department, associated games and associated accounts.
---
I hope some Druids get Atiesh in Classic. They deserve it the most to be honest as it is just insane for the class.. Here is what I expect most Ferals will use. Guaranteed quest item and they will easily compete in early tiers with it.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=18420](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18420)
---
Maybe... but if that's the angle they would take with it anyway, why not just say something like:
---
&gt; *We are increasing the cost of subscription to $20/month specifically to handle modern employee and server costs without introducing microtransactions to WoW Classic.*
---
I mean Pally, hunter, priest also means different armor types and assuming the pally doesn't mind tanking a few dungeons here and there, you'll probably have a nice group as is.
---
Thanks, yeah I'm thinking of playing Druid, and I'm fine with doing resto, I've just always seen people say "Feral is a time sink" but never found an explanation of WHAT the time sink was.
---
I played vanilla back in the day but I was only 14 and never reached end game before BC - I was the worlds slowest leveller lmao but the memories are fond of what i did have :D 
---
Curious, what is it about the game now that has lost the community and friendly feel like it was back then? I remember how hugely important my guild was to me, and the friends I made doing dungeons but what happened to wow to make it the total opposite of that?
---
&gt;But those people also say MC fights have almost no meaningful mechanics, and most DPS specs have brain-dead rotations, so as long as everyone can do a very simple job the boss falls over.
---
That's generally true, but getting 40 severely undergeared people to finish MC is still not easy.
---
&gt;How did I know you were going to bring that one up? It's like the entire pirate server community only knows two vidoes, "original Rag kill" and "this one priest making a C'thun video".
---
Excuse me? That's not the world first Ragnaros kill, it's Method's kill. I only called it "original" because it was a kill video of the original Ragnaros from retail Vanilla and I posted this particular one because it has a clearly shown combat log.
---
&gt;And no, I'm not doing your homework for you.
---
I already did my homework and my numbers seem to match - that's why I'm asking you to review it and see whether you can find any significant differences.
---
&gt;In the first few months, sure, the game was unexplored. By mid-to-late retail vanilla people like Elitist Jerks had spreadsheets and analysis for every major aspect of the game and serious players all used them.
---
My point is that MC can be cleared even with wildly suboptimal stats/plays/outputs. In the video I posted, **the number one DPS is a rogue with a horribly wrong spec using a terrible rotation**. There's not much you could do more wrong as a raiding rogue than spec CB/Prep and not use Slice and Dice - that's pretty much like a shaman coming to a raid specced Enhancement and refusing to drop totems - and this guy is still the best DPS in the raid even though Ragnaros is not a melee friendly boss! I mean, if you can afford to play like that, you can't argue that Ragnaros is hard.
---
Rogues are terrible in PvP. No one should ever roll a rogue.  Just leave that to me.  But for real, a skilled rogue is a handful.  A half ass SS spammer rogue sucks.  Just like with every other class, it all comes down to the player 
---
&gt; Do you have any sources backing up that claim? It may not be a 1:1 conversion but the overlap is high.
---
Yes, I am a first hand source. No one in my 80+ active guild have any desire to play on a pserver except for 2 people, and almost all of us are going to play Classic. There is a wide range of players, all sorts of different age, backgrounds and geographic locations that play all sorts of different multiplayer games. I would argue that it is an optimum sample.
---
&gt;Sure if they released 2 or 3 new servers every few months. 
---
So first you say Blizzard can pump out new servers just like pservers, then you admit they will have problems if they do. It sounds like you need to get your opinions sorted before you start typing them.
---
&gt;Pservers also don‚Äôt have the marketing and resources available to blizzard.
---
Neither Pservers nor Blizzard need advertising. I don't understand why you would bring this up out of left field when it doesn't related to any of this.
---
&gt;Server caps introduce region locking
---
Those are two completely separate things. You can have one without the other, or both, or neither.
---
&gt;Server caps also change what is regarded as a ‚Äúfull‚Äù or ‚Äúpopulated‚Äù server
---
And...? I don't get your point here, it seems as lost as your connection between server cap and region locking.
---
&gt;So you said the old engine runs on ancient computers but then say server hardware requirement is irrelevant? Did you miss my point?
---
No, you have completely missed my point. The old engine runs well on ancient computers. That means that people with ancient computers can play pserver WoW but cannot play modern WoW or Classic WoW because they use the newer, more resource demanding client. "Ancient computer owner" is a demogrphic in itself. Many old games live on solely because there is a demographic of people with old shitty computers that cannot run new games.
---
On the other hand, what does it matter what the server hardware requirements are? Can you tell me? Do you even know why you brought that up other than a mindless "no u" argument?
---
It's just not relevant. If he doesn't know for a fact that he requested the email he shouldn't click it, even if Blizzard sent it.
---
This sounds fucking epic.
---
Thats why she hides in the back before you start the fight. Cathedral full of knights checkin her shit out all day lmao.
---
Plaed tauren shaman for years, i'd give up that war stomp (which could give me 1lhw) every few minutes for that magical 25% stun resist. Stuns(and fears) are the most rageinducing things in vanilla, 25% chance of ruining a rogues chance of killing me, constantly? I'lltake it.  
---
And I fear vanilla will have that retarded tauren hitbox, which only benefited enhancement shamans and warriors.
---
They may have a guaranteed population, but streamers and especially their fanboys will absolutely ruin the server. PvP or PvE doesn't matter. 
---
I own my own business and only take appointments so I‚Äôll just be getting a gaming laptop to smash things out while at work and doing the rest when I‚Äôm kicking back at home.
---
That guys actually one of the "champions" made into a statue in  Herods room, which is cool. Says he was "lost off the shores of Northrend". 
---
I'm not even questioning what you're saying, what I am saying is that I won't get an e-mail that looks like that one.
---
If you have a consistent schedule consider yourselves lucky.
---
I have different days off every week (usually always weekdays) and start at different times depending on the week.
---
Sometimes i work 5am-1pm other times 7am-330pm or 1030am-7pm.
---
So at least opening up a consistent time for raiding will be easy for you.
---
I agree, Alliance zones are much cooler than Horde zones. In Horde zones you literally only have barren wastelands with some trees here and there, but mostly just rocks. Alliance has beautiful forests and hills with farms, mines, mage towers, big lakes, and constantly changing scenery. Elwynn is happy and beautiful, Westfall is kind of depressing but still really satisfying, redridge is incredible with the huge town hall and all the caves/towers/lake. Then you are thrown into creepy Wetlands or the grim Duskwood. You really feel like you are in the Warcraft world when playing Alliance. Horde is just Durotar(rocks and dust), The Barrens(rocks and dust), Stonetalon mountains(rocks, dust, and trees.), Thousand Needles(dust and rocks).. The only good ones are Mulgore and the Undead zone is kinda cool because of the darkness and music.
---
You are correct. I don't think most people expect vanilla to stay alive for more than a few years in an entirely static world, but there are plenty of options to deal with that down the road.
---
And then make a macro that /yell's YEET everytime you use one
---
Human warlock
---
Summon succubus
---
Or you could just avoid said information. 
---
Anecdotal example - I played God of War 8 months after its release and I did so completely blind and spoiler free. 
---
I agree. I HATE the barrens, and so many people day they miss it, so always get surprised. I remember it being a drag and an overall very boring experience, I can't understand how people want to go back there 
---
Not really ‚Äúafraid‚Äù per se.
---
I guess I figure that rolling on (assuming they keep original server names) some of the servers that were popular in ‚Äò05 would be a safe enough bet. Maybe that‚Äôs wrong, though.
---
You'll get one that looks exactly like the OP's actually.
---
Rank 14 is one of the most poorly designed game ideas I've ever seen. Due to it's competitive nature (not skill, but hours), you will be forced to play a minimum of 16 hours a day. Near the end I'd expect close to 20. 
---
It is completely unfeasible unless you can take time off work (months, not days). 
---
If you're like me, and you have a commute and a job that sometimes makes you stay late I would be much more focused on the leveling and social aspect of classic than end game. 
---
How do you figure out which servers those are?
---
Hooks up two dwarves so they can jerk off on a stone together and create a new dwarf
---
That's why there should be only a handful of servers without population cap for the first few weeks ( but I think it's achievable only with sharding).
---
Ive actually read about people doing this system on different versions of live. So apparently its real.
---
If he can confirm an associate of his that shares that email account created the Blizzard account and it matches the account name he blanked out then it's safe to click, but aside from that yes, generally getting emails like that are shady and should be discarded.
---
You seem really hung up on this one point that we don't disagree on.
---
&gt; That's why there should be only a handful of servers without population cap for the first few weeks ( but I think it's achievable only with sharding).
---
Love your delivery style, cool video!
---
Which is why KBs &gt; HKs in BGs
---
From my own memory, I can remember Illidan, Mal‚Äôganis, Suramar to be popular off the top of my head. Again, those might be wrong, but I could just look up which servers the top guilds were on in Vanilla, that would probably be a good indicator.
---
Past that, I probably won‚Äôt be too torn up if I have to re-level a toon on a different server after getting to 35 and realizing it‚Äôs not working out on my server.
---
Indeed it is. I only played Rogue and never had a Twink, when other people had like already 2. Rogue felt like a never ending commitment.
---
However, it's also one of my all time favorite classes in WoW. I never twinked in Classic and I was okay with that.
---
For me it was worth it, since Stealth is the best skill in existence. You can just go anywhere you please. 
---
Stealth gives you so many tactical advantages. That's why I go with Druid this time. I just can't live without this Skill.
---
I leave the door open for Rogue, but the issue is I really want to Heal this time around.
---
I think if you get full T3, with Hemo, you are going to be in for a treat. But the road is going to be hard and not easy. Not gonna lie.
---
But I promise you, if you have a good reputation as a Rogue, people will invite you to parties, there is a HUGE difference between a good Rogue and a bad Rogue.
---
As a Druid, I'm ready for some Duo adventures, with a good Rogue by my side. Sneaking through Stormwind and ganking people in the middle of Ironforge. People are going to hate you. ;D
---
1. That‚Äôs called anecdotal, it means literally nothing. 
---
2. Reread what I said, it‚Äôs not hard to figure out. 
---
3. So you don‚Äôt think marketing vs not marketing will have an effect on player population?  Really?
---
4. I‚Äôm not going to spell shit out for you regarding relative capacity on servers.  I‚Äôve already wasted too much time on what seems to be me getting trolled. 
---
5. You apparently have no clue how engine or hardware optimization works if you can‚Äôt piece together how lower particle density on classic spells compared to release, even on the same engine, will result in lower hardware requirements.  Same goes for less complex game systems: fewer computations per second results in less CPU demand.  I was hoping you would have at least a *basic* understanding of how hardware works, but apparently that was too high of an expectation.  
---
Come to think of it, the way my points are whizzing over your head on literally every aspect you brought up, not understand how marketing budget could impact server population, and mixed in with you saying anecdotal evidence is an ‚Äúoptimum sample‚Äù, furthers my belief you‚Äôre either trolling or plain ignorant on these subjects. 
---
Before I go I‚Äôll guess your next move and answer it ahead of time regarding anecdotal evidence:  
---
My raiding guild of 800 people who are all professional WoW players and have scarab lord title and mythic jaina on farm all say the exact opposite of what your guild does.  And that‚Äôs a optimum sample. 
---
See how it literally means nothing?
---
But again, you‚Äôve proven to be a troll or down right ignorant and I‚Äôve wasted an embarrassing amount of time enough time already talking to a wall so congrats you win. 
---
first time i tried to get to burning steppes i took this path. BRM looked to scary to go into so i just climbed around in the mountains for awhile and eventually got over (;
---
I'm saying there will be 1.
---
_I_ seem hung up? You're the one making up this story about having someone having a shared email, in 2019.
---
&gt;generally getting emails like that are shady and should be discarded.
---
This is the only part that matters. Whether you have received a legitimate email like it in the past or not, this is what people must learn to live by. Teaching people that "actually sometimes legit companies send out really shady-looking emails" is very counterproductive.
---
We do agree about the practice but disagree on what people's focus should be focusing on, I think :)
---
I‚Äôd go to goldshire and eat some night elf ass
---
How will they ruin it?
---
Horde teleports directly to Gnomer from Booty Bay, so it's not a huge inconvenience.  Or at least, it's not much more inconvenient considering you're still farming that boss dozens of times per week.
---
Dwarf. Walk through Coldridge Valley and Kharanos to Ironforge, unfreeze my toes while sitting in front of fire, sipping a mug of beer. Prolly hang around and sightsee the Great Forge and Old Ironforge.
---
Sure, the Elf Tree is fine, and Brill would be dandy, but at the end of the day, I go for cozy.
---
I had 2 main points.
---
Point 1 was in response to your comment about how scammers make obvious mistakes in scams to filter out observant people. Yes, scammers do this, however the OP's email (if a scam), is *not* one attempting to filter out observant people
---
Point 2 was that the email is not obviously a scam email as you stated (As noted by it being identical to the email people receive when creating new Classic Blizzard accounts).
---
Yes, if the OP didn't create the said account he should obviously not click it (which I said in my very first response to you), that was never a point of disagreement.
---
Yeah besides spamming trade chat with aids I dont know how they would ruin it. I'll be picking a streamer server just so it's a guarantee that I'll be on a highpop realm.
---
The time sink that comes with being a respected feral druid is that if you want to pull your weight and be an average DPS you need to get one or even two extra gearsets. A lot of guilds will ask you "hey can you decurse this fight or toss some extra healing" and you will slap on your healing set and help out (a ton of resto talents are shit so you are still effective even without being in the tree). Or your guild may need an extra tank for something like...garr or whatever. Having a tank set for that situation is what is great about playing feral druid (all of this applies for tank druid as well). 
---
For DPS feral druid if you want to put up decent numbers for progression or hard fights farming gnomeregan for your BiS dps (and tank threat) weapon is encouraged by many. Because it is night and day in how much threat/dps you pull with it. To also be pulling your weight and not be seen as a slacker you usually also need to farm much more items much more often to be seen as doing well. 
---
A fury warrior could not flask or forget his jujus or whatever and still be high on the charts but with a feral dps druid it gets noticed, and sadly as a feral druid you are held up to a much higher standard because most guilds choose potentially only one of you and the stigma of you being useless.
---
The true benefit to being a feral druid is the versatility it brings and if you can't bring the versatility of being a tank or healer or dps when needed more often than not a rogue or warrior or regular old priest is better suited for either of those requirements. What they can't do (usually) is flip it on a moments notice for when it is needed, so throwing away one of your benefits because you only want to DPS or only want to tank is considered a sub par feral druid.
---
&gt; That's generally true, but getting 40 severely undergeared people to finish MC is still not easy.
---
Like I said, you can play games with making up your own definition of "easy" if you wish.
---
&gt; Excuse me? That's not the world first Ragnaros kill, it's Method's kill. I only called it "original" because it was a kill video of the original Ragnaros from retail Vanilla and I posted this particular one because it has a clearly shown combat log.
---
Well done, you found one arguably imprecise word usage which you started.
---
&gt; My point is that MC can be cleared even with wildly suboptimal stats/plays/outputs. In the video I posted, the number one DPS is a rogue with a horribly wrong spec using a terrible rotation. There's not much you could do more wrong as a raiding rogue than spec CB/Prep and not use Slice and Dice - that's pretty much like a shaman coming to a raid specced Enhancement and refusing to drop totems - and this guy is still the best DPS in the raid even though Ragnaros is not a melee friendly boss! I mean, if you can afford to play like that, you can't argue that Ragnaros is hard.
---
IIRC the hard bit is getting through the adds without losing too many people, it's not so much a DPS race. Also threat was much more of an issue back then than in the eternal 1.12 of pirate servers so there would have been limits to how much you could usefully optimise DPS anyway.
---
But the bottom line isn't going to change, which is that pirate Rag ends up being trivial when retail Rag was not. There are lots of places where pirate servers could be getting something wrong, and a lot of it could be people having optimised 1.12 builds for very early content, but something's clearly off with the end result.
---
I would a lot of that comes from what guild you end up in and if that guild is trying to really fast raid progression. For instance, the current group I'm with has talked about setting up an optimal group to speed up progression at the beginning of each raid, and then once the guild starts getting comfortable, start bringing in non-meta specs. Besides, if there's 1.12 gear out at release, MC/Ony will be easy enough to do with non-optimal specs and gear as long as people aren't idiots.
---
I'd say play what you want.
---
If you want the best feral tank gear, you will want to reach exalted with AB and WSG (shoulders and legs are bis), which take a very long time.
---
And if you really want to top dps meter, you have to farm a bunch of these : [https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9449)  for each raid, so that's 2 or 3 hours farming this per week on top of all the other consumables (also note that you want the same consumable than melee dps but also need mana pot/dark rune and thing like that for long fight). 
---
This mace can also be useful for tanking for maximum tps but you will use that far less while tanking than while dpsing.
---
None of the above is required to play feral druid, you can play just fine without spending countless hours, but if you want to be at the top, you will have to put spend time for these.
---
I main ally but to me no zone was ever prettier or more calming to be in than Mulgore.
---
Not really true in 2019, only issue with wireless is they are heavier, and battery can be a annoyance.
---
Perhaps somewhere along the line in Blizz's setup of battle.net you got lost in the mix. Sorry hear that dude :/
---
&gt;As to why it wasn't really viable in real vanilla. That helm originally came out in the Naxx Patch
---
Source ? 
---
Barrens has the essence of vanilla WoW. The place is pretty barren and questing in there is quite a chore, but the people in there make it entertaining. I'm not sure if people who don't understand why Barrens was great will understand why vanilla was so good.
---
Accompanied by Teldrassil magical music. That's a bliss.
---
Really appreciate you saying that, thank you. This is just my second video so sometimes i feel like im shooting in the dark in terms of presentation and all that kind of stuff.
---
I remember back in 2005 when I was on the PvP grind, a guildmate of mine was rank 13 going for rank 14, he put in like 100 hours that week so he would ensure he‚Äôd get it. I was doing like 40 hours a week and got Centurion (rank 9) before I gave it up. 
---
This is not true. Two handed fury is T1 dps you are just required to wield one of two weapons. Nightfall which chance on hit buffs all caster dmg or BoneReaver chance on hit to lower amor by 700 stacking 3 times. With those weapons it was T1
---
True, but the reality is the ultra "hardcore" raiders on mostly over servers will have naxx on farm inevitably first, and its been """ determined"""" by the same people who came up with the pve bis lists that the mage version I think is marginally better for the overall raid, so it likely will go to that class first.
---
Especially at launch they will have an entire army of fanboys following him wherever he goes. 
---
Thank you for for the response
---
The server transfer you're thinking of was the other way around. Free High pop -&gt; low pop

Why would you give a druid atiesh over a mage ever?

I found https://wowdev.wiki/ADT/v18#Map_size earlier this morning and it had some pretty useful information, but not exactly what I was needing.
---
Who cares though? Sounds like a big vibrant server to me. Thats everything i'm looking for
---
Mages are the highest dps class in naxx. You are wrong.
---
Towns definitely are. Orgrimmar looks like if someone was building things in Warcraft 3, without any planning, quickly because enemy hero is on his way, and that burrows have to be filled up. Thunder Bluff looks like they've came with 2019's machines and landscaped it, for some reason, that weird way. And also, one can see the signs of low technology - it is already a challenge to keep homes dry during rains, so there is no way to make aesthetic shapes. And Undercity - hmm, find the poorest town in India, and it will look similar.
---
Alliance towns look like if somebody actually put time into building and decorating them. Look at Stormwind, where one couldn't just randomly place buildings here and there - the size and shape is as in the plans. Darnassus - maybe most of the "buildings" are either mobile of randomly placed, but at least it maintains some urban order - a district here and district there. And Ironforge is well... majestic. And has quite no room for expansion in the future.
---
are you a terrorist?
---
&gt; That‚Äôs called anecdotal, it means literally nothing.
---
It's called a sample size. Or did you think that every poll and survey conducted includes millions of people? You should learn what you're arguing about before you start arguing it.
---
&gt;Reread what I said, it‚Äôs not hard to figure out.
---
I reread it. I came to the same conclusion. You're agreeing with me that releasing new Classic servers as often as new pservers come out is a detrimental idea. If that's not what you're trying to say then maybe you should say it differently.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm not going to spell shit out for you regarding relative capacity on servers. I‚Äôve already wasted too much time on what seems to be me getting trolled.
---
You don't have a strong enough comprehension of the subject to spell it out. You literally cannot explain your own fucked up logic. YOU are the one who is failing to provide information. YOU are the troll.
---
&gt;You apparently have no clue how engine or hardware optimization works if you can‚Äôt piece together how lower particle density on classic spells compared to release, even on the same engine, will result in lower user hardware requirements.
---
Are you seriously trying to say that the modern Classic WoW client will run just as well as the 1.12 client on ancient computers because Classic WoW will use the same spell particle effects as 1.12?
---
Please explain to me how someone running Windows XP is going to run the modern Classic WoW client at all, let alone run it well. I'm really eager to hear how a GeForce 8800 is going to support DX11.
---
Ratchet to BB, its like a 5 minute trip at most from any 3  major cities.
---
The servers that streamers are on will be packed full of hangers-on and gawkers trying to check out the streamer.

You might want to avoid (or find) these servers, depending on what you're looking for.

ddoesn't quite speak to me. Morrowind was fun and the fun developed, but then suddenly got boring after I started to loot more than any vendor could buy. Skyrim the same. In Oblivion, for some reason I quite after the first quest. Not sure why. But well, it was the same case with Morrowind and Skyrim, previously.
---
You are an idiot. 
---
lol because you don¬¥t like people spamming chat with complete nonsense and doing boring quests in the same landscape for 10+ levels you don't understand what made vanilla so good? Really?
---
I see so many people here that for sure has a romantizied view of vanilla WoW and not remembering it for how it ACTUALLY was. Like Barrens didn't have Camp Taurrajo flightpath for a long time in vanilla, so it used to be even worse. You had to run so freaking much. Like you're saying barrens has boring landscape and boring quests yourself, but because it is the WoW version of twitch chat it's the essence of wow?
---
yeah battery is the only difference these days. Even pro fps players use wireless these days.
---
A lot of people care. Won't be fun questring in the same zone as this streamer and his army. Also if the streamer quits or goes to another server your server won't be as populated anymore.
---
Can confirm. Love this mouse.
---
A lot more tropical / palm trees / warmer enviorments for horde.
---
No thanks.
---
Enhance is playable if you get god gear but so is everything else. As a spec though it's pretty bad. IN addition to being easily kited. By this patch winfury had already been nerfed. You can not proc windfury off of another windfury and even worse then that. It has a 3 second internal cool down. Which means if you go sword an board while pvping. Your 2.8 swing speed weapon will never be able to proc it two attacks in a row.
---
I think the Alliance zones are more "pretty."  I don't mean that as a slight either, I think Elwynn is quite stereotypically fantasy and Tolkein-esque.  Very vanilla, very warm, definitely a fantasy forest.  Teldrassil is elusive and magical, purples and greens, another fantasy forest but with much more magic and definitely pretty.  Dun Morough might be farthest from the pretty, but it as well captures a nice "wintery happy" feeling - if that makes sense.  I think progressing into the lvl10-20 areas, however, their zones get much more serious.  Not necessarily gloomy, but definitely more "serious."
---
Horde on the otherhand are aesthetically appealing but for quite different reasons, I think.  The Orcs and Trolls have the red, cracked earth, a harsh environment.  I think this is especially fitting for their origins and what they've gone through. The Undead's starting area is also fitting for them, though I guess pairing "death" with "more death" isn't really poetry.  I don't find their zone aesthetically deep, but the stories and mechanics of the quest lines *really* make that zone come alive (pun maybe intended).  And finally the Tauren have maybe the most beautiful zone.  Their minimalistic architecture and preservation of beautiful rolling hills and wide open spaces really shows their respect for nature, especially when contrasted to the spots in Mulgore that are inhabited by races other than the tauren (harpies, dwarves, Venture Co., Gnolls).
---
Sorry for the novel.  Just love the game &lt;3 
---
1) Mage is not top tier until AQ
---
2) Nowhere said it's about pvp.
---
Any insight of the reason behind this? 
---
I personally haven't played WoW since Cata, the one thing I want to accomplish in classic is Naxx. I don't understand why pservers usually end near the start of the release of it.
---
Dwarf  go to ironforge for the brew and the snow views.
---
There's a quest, I think you pick it up from the engineer trainer in Orgrimmar.  He just sends you to BB, you talk with the goblin standing next to the teleporter by the inn, and he gives you an item that makes the teleporter active while it is in your inventory.
---
And that totally sounds like something 2019 Blizz would put effort into...
---
:(
---
Saved for name alone.
---
1. Mage is 100% a top tier dps class until AQ together with Rogue and Warrior. 
---
2. OP asked what it‚Äôs like being in Naxx gear as a mage, do you one shot other players. I.e. is mage good in pvp. 
---
3. You are utterly clueless.
---
It really depends on the servers/competition.  
---
You had to get more honor than the other guys, which meant: Have a premade that stomps WSG(on our server alliance premades would dodge other premades so that they could continue stomping casuals) and get more honor than the guys sologrinding, and rotate who gets #1 every week, so that you all can end up as R14.  
---
Some servers didnt have such insane competition so you could do it in less hours.
---
I want the classic experience, not TBC. If I'm being a realist I'm in the #nochanges group, (mostly), but in a perfect world I would have Blizzard release classic with updates fitting classic mentality. Why should ret paladins be unplayable, (for one example),? That wasn't intentional, and to me isn't something we should strive to preserve. 
---
Yup. Biggest fear is picking a server that will end up with low pop or huge faction imbalance.

---
&gt;I want the classic experience, not TBC.
---
OK, so why can't we just enjoy Classic for what it is? Ret wasn't unplayable, its just not optimal. And clearly, there was some intention because they had numerous patches and opportunity to change that, but chose not because they were afraid of homogenizing the classes in pursuit of balance like modern retail.
---
So what exactly do you need?
---
Guess you could say you where I'm fear of not doing dmg har har har 
---
ooh damn I will never forget my trip to Poland. All girls there have extremely short chests - it was impossible to take a missionary position, as there was quite nowhere to put my hands. Above her arms - I would basically by lying on her, below her arms - it felt very weird and uncomfortable.
---
Another thing is that I'm 192cm and I'm actually a dwarf - if I had normal human proportions, I would be like 220cm tall.
---
We can start with the name? It's not a damn sport.
---
Mea culpa. Thabjs for correcting
---
You're lucky whenever you see a vanilla player unbind Autoattack from 1.
---
Thanks for the in depth comment North.  Mages really are the supreme jack of all trades when it comes to picking and choosing fights like a rogue. Doing decent damage coupled with second to none CC
---
Vanilla Balance starts to suck when people get AQ40/Naxx gear and while most other raid tiers are doable for anyone, most people won't get to do AQ40/Naxx because of the difficulty/organisation required
---
&gt;Like I said, you can play games with making up your own definition of "easy" if you wish.
---
Well, how would you define it? It's something that takes extreme dedication from the most dedicated portion of the player base and is pretty much impossible for others. The fact that it happens regularly just shows that those people have no life - nothing more, nothing less.
---
&gt;Well done, you found one arguably imprecise word usage which you started.
---
I think I've been fairly civil so far, is there any need for this? While I can see how it could be confusing, I didn't think that you would see "original Rag" and interpret it as "original Rag kill". I certainly don't see that as a reason to open the conversation by calling me a "pirate server supremacist" and respond with a passive aggressive comment when I clarify what I meant, especially considering that you could've just clicked the link to see what video I was using to support my argument.
---
&gt;IIRC the hard bit is getting through the adds without losing too many people, it's not so much a DPS race.
---
If you have more raid DPS, the fight is easier on the healers' mana pools.
---
&gt;Also threat was much more of an issue back then than in the eternal 1.12 of pirate servers so there would have been limits to how much you could usefully optimise DPS anyway.
---
That doesn't justify all those people who are doing much less DPS than this guy. There's also the fact that during the sons phase, he straight up executes his standard extremely spiky Backstab rotation on a son that is being tanked by a warrior who manages to keep aggro on multiple other sons at the same time - not a feat that would point towards threat capping or being close to it.
---
&gt;But the bottom line isn't going to change, which is that pirate Rag ends up being trivial when retail Rag was not.
---
I've been in pirate server guilds where players were about as bad as those in the video and Rag was still a challenge.
---
&gt;a lot of it could be people having optimised 1.12 builds for very early content
---
That could play a role, but there's not a huge difference in a lot of PvE builds between release and talent review - certainly a much smaller difference that between speccing CB/Prep and doing a proper combat build.
---
I think the undead starting zones are the most aesthetically appealing.  I get lost in the atmosphere of them.
---
Obviously they are not 'pretty' though.
---
&gt;OK, so why can't we just enjoy Classic for what it is? 
---
We can, which is why I said:
---
&gt;If I'm being a realist I'm in the #nochanges group, (mostly)
---
And to your second point, past Blizz's inability to balance wasn't a feature lol, buffing numbers to bring ret/feral/assassin/enhance specs to *viable* status wouldn't make classes homogenized, you'd have to completely change their skills and talents to do so which is what happened in retail. 
---
PVP players aren't going to stick around to clear Naxx for multiple staffs anyways. Late AQ/Naxx pvp goes down the crapper and everyone will reroll and Blizzard will probably have fresh every 2.5 years or something. It means more for druids in PvP so on a PvP server I think a druid should have priority and it's not like you are going to have a lot in the raid anyways and most on a pvp server are doing something they don't want to be doing anyways (healing in Naxx). On a PVE server? Yeah go ahead and focus on PVE being .01 percent better. Have fun clearing Naxx over and over again for a year. 
---
I'm above 6', but still I have quite dwarfish body - short legs, and such things. Actually, I'm diagnosed for dwarfism, and my expected height was around 230cm.
---
Damn! You're right! Thank you for the correction!
---
Rank 8 is fairly obtainable for most of us wow addicts who like a blended play style with raising included and I‚Äôve managed it on all toons whilst working 40-50, going to the gym for 8 hours a week, gf and social commitments. 
---
Fixed for ya. 
---
**PvP :**
---
Drood : Tauren
---
Priest : Undead
---
Rogue : Orc because you can literally die in a hammer of justice
---
Warrior : Orc
---
Hunter : Orc
---
Shaman : Orc as enhance. Tauren or Orc as Elemental. Pure Resto is trash in pvp, you don't play it.
---
Warlock : Orc
---
Mage : Undead because it's strong against soft counters
---
**PvE :**
---
Priest : Troll but priests are so needed it doesn't matter.
---
Rogue : Orc due to resisting stuns and taking less dmg/more uptime. It's also the best pvp race so no one should play troll.
---
Warrior (Prot) : Troll because of threat. Threat is all that matters.
---
Warrior (DPS) : Orc
---
Hunter : Troll
---
Shaman (DPS) : Orc cus elemental isn't viable.
---
Shaman (Heal) : Play whatever your offspec is gonna be. You are pressing chainheal and the troll racial takes a global. It's overrated.
---
Warlock : Doesn't matter.
---
Mage : Troll
---
In addition to what the other guy said, people don't like starting when they're too far behind everyone else. Some people slowly quit, and very few start fresh. Vanilla had catchup mechanics but they wouldn't let you completely skip all the previous tiers like in retail.
---
It's of course also worth mentioning that this is kind of a self-fullfilling prophecy... no new players start because they think there won't be any other new players like themselves. 
---
This is all also exacerbated by private servers usually not lasting that long, which is at least one factor classic won't have.
---
Legitimate question, which will probably get downvoted. How sure are we that it worked in vanilla that way? The only stuff I have found online(granted not a ton of searching) is post 2.0 so... are we positive that manual crowd pummeler works for druids in vanilla? Are we sure it‚Äôs not a pserver thing like frontstabbing?

It means someone found the wow item creator and is bad at photoshop.
---
It's more complicated than a "cap." They went into it during the interview but weren't very clear about it. Perhaps it's more to do with concurrent players but again they just weren't clear about the details.
---
3.5k is the absolute edge of what I'd be comfortable with. Even with ~2k population (my pserver) you get ganked very often in farming spots. Add another 1.5k population and it's going to be a nightmare to get anything done, and that pushes people to do dungeon shenanigans, and that's antithetical to the living world philosophy of Vanilla.

HKs don't actually give you anything, what you need to rank up is honor - and that depends on how much you contribute to the kill. So just getting a ton of HKs is really pretty pointless.

---
Bear form is not a long chain now is it? It seemed quite fast the last time I did it but the memory is fuzzy. 
---
Play a bit in the evening some nights and a lot on the weekends.
---
&gt; Well, how would you define it? It's something that takes extreme dedication from the most dedicated portion of the player base and is pretty much impossible for others. The fact that it happens regularly just shows that those people have no life - nothing more, nothing less.
---
I'd buy that in a game with a higher skill ceiling, But in vanilla WoW raiding, a lot of people are literally hitting one button. They are going to do the same damage mashing frostbolt as a scrub in the same gear because there is no magic high-skill way to super-mash that key and get more DPS.
---
&gt; I think I've been fairly civil so far, is there any need for this?
---
I apologise - I got you mixed up with Tardigrade89 and you have indeed been perfectly civil.
---
&gt; If you have more raid DPS, the fight is easier on the healers' mana pools. I would say that adds are a matter of coordination moreso than stats or output, you just need to keep them in groups and away from all casters.
---
That was my recollection.
---
&gt; That doesn't justify all those people who are doing much less DPS than this guy. 
---
I think it's human nature that a lot of people don't do better than "good enough", and the boss fell down therefore to them it was good enough.
---
&gt; I've been in pirate server guilds where players were about as bad as those in the video and Rag was still a challenge.
---
Fails gonna fail, I guess.
---
&gt; That could play a role, but there's not a huge difference in a lot of PvE builds between release and talent review - certainly a much smaller difference that between speccing CB/Prep and doing a proper combat build.
---
Consensus seems to be that threat mattered a lot in early raiding and everyone had to be careful not to overtake the tank, and that by 1.12 fury warriors with no threat mitigation or aggro dump could go nuts for an entire fight without any aggro worries.
---
Meh, trolls are ugly Rasta looking mother fuckers.  I'm rolling undead mage.
---
Oh man. I wish I had a 9-5 job. My job is more like a round the clock sort of thing (engineer, @major search engine company). Everyone here babbles about work life balance, but book meetings way outside of business hours to ‚Äúsync‚Äù with colleagues overseas (I hate that word), and answer emails at 4am. All the while, they talk about how hard they work and how they really shouldn‚Äôt, but they do. 
---
In a way, it‚Äôs kind of a blessing that retail is less engaging these days - I don‚Äôt have the time that I used to have. 
---
Im starting university this year and i work 4 times a week/7hours. It'll be pretty hard to manage my time, but ill give it a try. Its pretty sad that we're now grown up and unable to play 10+hours/day. 
---
&gt; We don't care, that's not the point.
---
Then don't start discussion threads or participate in them. For people who do care (like OP), I give my honest opinion on the matter.
---
&gt; You said you agree with my points above, then there is nothing that justifies what you were trying to say about offspecs in the first place, right?
---
Look, most of the people who ask questions like OP didn't raid in vanilla with 40man raids. The issue is they don't know how time consuming and frustrating it was to schedule so many people and make sure everyone does their thing right in the raid. For 90% of the players who raid this is the reality. Hardcore raiders are usually people with lets say very flexible schedules. But for most players who even find time to raid it is a huge chunk of their time wasted if you wipe and don't progress, which is why in the long run your guild can fall apart or lose their best. People will ask: Why should *you* be that special guy who gets to play this weird/suboptimal stuff while were not progressing? Don't forget, no matter how 'lax' people pretend to be, almost everyone who raids wants to see more content and most importantly wants more and better gear.
---
This is a repeating theme throughout WoW. This is why people come in these threads and tell them how it is/was. Maybe it will be different this time idk. It has absolutely nothing to do with being elitist or single minded.
---
If you're an important part of the guild, I wouldn't consider it impossible to give atiesh to a druid. Honestly, a guild that is able to get atiesh has all content on farm, and an atiesh won't matter at that point.
---
Wat
---
How rare are the crowd pummelers?  How long would it take to farm 6?  I take it they don‚Äôt stack either?
