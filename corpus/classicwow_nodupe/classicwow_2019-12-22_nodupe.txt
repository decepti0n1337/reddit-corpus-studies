damn, the answer would have been hunter but you already it. Can buy good blues from AH for very cheap, doesn't require mega gear, buy DMN items double ring and chest, dmw helm, buy weapons. You can have "near prebis" so easily.
---
---
---
I had this thought the other day, I don't think it is :(
---
He can't be an orc because orcs can't even buy Stormstrike Hammer.
---
Yep. People ask for tanking runs all the time for specific gear. I asked to be compensated 7g because my raid let me die to trash 5 times in MC. Nobody helped me with repair cost. Welp. Guess I will be out grinding for mats instead of tanking for peoples gear
---
Just ran 100k one vs. one games and the win ratio for the player that goes first is basically [50% in the long run.](https://imgur.com/yUEFnxj) Somebody do the actual math (I'm more of a programmer than pure mathematician myself)
---
My server tanks charge 30g a run any run 52 plus. If its live they take 1st orb and if its multiple runs for a specific item I've seen them do 10g n all non needed greens n blues.
---
&gt;I think respect is a strong word.
---

---
I respect anyone's right to say whatever you wanna say, but I don't have to respect what they say. Not a hard concept to grasp.
---
But you're right, I'd either adhere to group rules or find another group. Regardless of what you think of me, I'd never ninja an item against the wishes of the majority or break any loot rules, even if I thought they were unfair or whatever the case.
---
&gt;The monotony of that is soul crushing.
---
Big reason why I don't play Classic WoW anymore, endgame is boring as shit in an MMO (and it seems you share my thoughts on this since you said this) and it will never be anything more unless you pretend, which you seem to prefer doing. And pretending the numbers aren't just numbers is roleplaying. I think it's not an insult to you or anyone else to say that out loud.
---
&gt;But certainly don't expect it to be an unspoken normalised institution.
---
Yet you say this, which is weird. How is expecting everyone to treat it as a video game that's been figured out for 15 years, rather than an RPG, on a normal server not the expected behavior? Assuming others want to roleplay on a non-roleplay server just seems to be asking for a bad time.
---
We are fundamentally at odds here and I don't think either of us can understand the motivations of the other. Why you would willingly set yourself up for disappointment on a standard realm (it's been obvious for a long time what sort of atmosphere Classic WoW would have with minmax vs. roleplay) is something I just can't wrap my head around.
---
Yeah cause warlocks r bad
---
Hey so is that!
---
Keep going, I always like to see how many responses I can accurately predict in a row.
---
I don’t know what spell batching is
---
I saw that it's pretty much 50/50. How does it feel when questing there as Alliance?
---
If you want a PvE server with a good alliance community, decent split, and pretty great economy I have to advocate for Atiesh 
---
Reading all the server/guild drama lately has really made me appreciate how great my experience has been on PVE alliance 
---
I’ll even give you free bags x)
---
You can cast 2 spells under a second due to the 500ms delay on skill/spell server detection or whatever it is. Someone can explain better i'm sure.
---
Sword better than mace with human racial?
---
Do you realize humans have a racial for swords AND maces?
---
nice try mr orc
---
If he is smart he will put a thorium spike and use the skullflame to farm with, that way hes getting some mileage from it
---
Divine Favor is absolutely *broken* when soloing.  Healing yourself to full for free every 2 minutes means you can *literally* chain pull without stopping to drink.  
---
Divine Favor can get good value in PvE and PvP as a healer or DPS.  
---
Holy shield only gets good value when tanking or aoe grinding.  Divine Favor will get you the most bang for your buck unless you want to focus mostly on tanking.  
---
If OP is going for versatility, Divine Favor is the better choice.
---
Wrong game my guy.
---
Boring.
---
Think a lot of the alliance already got exalted, only people I know doing AV are just doing it for the honor grind. It was insanely easy for alliance to get exalted the first week when most games were over in 10 minutes.
---
Raid starts at 830 I’ll keep posted
---
no it’s not, it’s a 50% chance. Either it happens or it doesn’t.
---
One thing I've noticed is that the eyes don't agro people I bring in to sell my DM Trib loot to.
---
Then wait a few months for the harder raids.
---
Do you skin the hyenas?
---
Completely disagree, unless he is in a guild that is strictly rewarding loot based on meters/raid logs. And needs to shine on DPS.
---
Yeah I have the only one on the AH rn, and I’m over pricing it
---
In my own experience, things can also come up in the time leading up to a wipe. You can put these things off for a while but maybe a wipe makes the time commitment too much?
---
what are you using to change your model
---
These are not the only option horde as turned it around so that a few groups stay back and defend while everyone else moves north on the offense ... it’s not a turtle or a race it a little of both and it’s been working and it’s a lot of fun matches take long and yes you may not win but it’s nice to see people actually trying to play the game rather then concede from the start and go for min/max  I rather longer que times with fun games then quick que times just for fast honor
---
i win probably 80% of my AV's.  Maybe it's you that's the problem?
---
You sound like one of the ragers in chat that get butthurt anytime anything goes wrong.  After one mistake you give up (rerolling horde?) and rage on others. Everyone else is the idiot right?  That attitude is contagious and i hope you do reroll and spread it there.
---
Shoulda just said yes, I'm detecting a super weiner here.
---
Well, these are both virtually worthless. Sorry lol. As for the math ... roughly a 4%chance for 1 of the 3 pearls to drop. Then for another one to drop you've got like a 2.6% chance so I suppose its .04 x .026 someone correct me if I'm wrong pls
---
"blizzard sucks because we can't kite bosses to cities and grief players anymore" is my new favorite complaint about classic. i'm far from a blizzard fanboy but give it a break.
---
Tough luck green skin the raid loggers have already gone back to sleep
---
Yeah it's only &gt;1 million on alliance with instant AV queues.
---
What Hack is that to change your Race?
---
I'm not saying that Blizz is doing it because they hate us and wants to piss us off. Nor am I saying they are not fixing any bugs. I am simply pointing out that their bugfixes seems haphazard and that they seems to use their explanation of "this is how it works in the reference client" is being used for some things but not for others. 
---
It has nothing to do with hate. Blizzard doesn't give a shit about us. It's a business. They maximise profit and minimise costs. Putting a skeleton crew on this Classic thing to give it a semblance of there being support, while milking it as long as they can makes total sense from a business standpoint. Classic is not meant to last. Anyone who believes that it will last or even be further developed is just fooling themselves.
---
Until you look for a raiding guild and everyone already has their tanks and fury dps. Warrior is one of, if not the, most over represented classes in the game.
---
Oh....you're one of *those players*         
---
Edit: At this point I really want to hear the proper representation
---
Okay, I clearly made a mistake, but would it have been so difficult to mention that in the first place? This is that “toxicity” people keep talking about. Don’t berate people who make mistakes.
---
I have a 60 warrior and love it! But, I would say level a rogue because you will be able to get a lot more gear right away (as dps). As a tank you can basically wear your whole class sets, but as a rogue you definitely can. Stealthing nodes in silithus will net you some gold too, rogue is a solid class, the only downside is group finding
---
p2 was just alliance whine but since AV this sub has been pretty much exclusively horde whining
---
I hope you recover soon
---
Thought it was gonna be golden pearls, disappointed.

Also, barely any raid guilds look for Hunters. Mages are in more demand for all endgame content.

I really don’t think blizzard will care about this exploit but I could always be wrong.

Ye

Nah, maybe on a LOW population server. Ive got like 10 dps, 2 healers, and 1 tank thats never online on my friends list, never had problems finding groups. Im a rogue too.

What server you on?

Now he is trying to break the TOS. Dude is seriously messed up. Knowing this scumbag, he will probably try to monetize the system before it crashes and burns.

Ditto on the ego driven, I pretty much recognized it driving me as I was typing out these replies, yet trying to restrain myself didn't really go as planned (I disabled inbox replies at one point cause I didn't wanna bother anymore, yet checked anyway).

For me it was also the opposite, I'm going to bed soon after a particularly great evening of Counter-Strike. Good way to pump up your ego I guess...

Hope I didn't spoil your morning, I'm jealous of your ability to think like you do tbh. Enjoy the coffee and the holidays.
---
I never said Lawbringer was BiS, just pointing out another option that is better. Insightful Hood is definitely better than both.
---
It's bad in raids for the usual reasons, but I absolutely love the spec for pvp. Its huge burst and otherwise you can heal decently too.
---
Its a meme spec for pve but in general its one of the best meme specs for pvp.
---
If you only have one warrior in your guild you're going to have an interesting time in MC, and he's going to get an enormous amount of amazing DPS plate!
---
I've gotten 1 since classic came out lol
---
So are healers on my server
---
Hey! I was wondering if you could point me the right direction. I have gathermate 2 as well but as far as database goes I couldn't get one aside from some random one some dude made and linked in cursedforges comments a few weeks into classic. Where can I get a complete one?
---
As a faction you will get more rep the faster the games become. Individually tho, if you are already in a game those 30m games are the best (you are hurting other horde players that are in the queues tho)
---
To everyone asking how to change your model it’s bannable
---
Fantastic info!!! Thank you so much. BTW I'm horde Orc. I'm 15th level with a raptor pet. Should I get something else?
---
Ironically, the only one of you two who's implying anyone owes other people anything is you.
---
At the core of it mage is preferable because he can conjure food and water. But if your group already has a priest or a warlock, they would maybe prefer a hunter to join over a mage
---
Woah retail has the flag shown on your minimap and people aren’t primarily focused on supporting the flag carrier and your flag room? That’s trippy as hell.
---
Ive cleared naxx in retail in Bc. Ive also cleared naxx probably over 100 times spanning over a few private servers. Yes first few weeks will be difficult. But people who have been clearing it for years it will be a cakewalk.
---
nah but ive taken a screenshot with print button before
---
Yea but I'm farming items and a mount for me I don't care about them lol
---
Edit: plus what you said isn't actually true. The faster people hit exalted the sooner they'll stop grinding for it. Freeing up room for other players. And since it's higher per hour rep gain it's the faster method.
---
I’ve found finding groups as a healer can be a pain sometimes even more so than dps. Especially for dungeons that have key pieces for healers, like strat ud.
---
And my second 60 is a tank for the same reason. I leveled by dungeoning pretty easily and now at max level I can be way more helpful to guild mates and friends trying to fill groups... but brd escort runs are not something i do often lol
---
It's going for about 6g on my server last I checked
---
Thanks for the update!
---
Jeah for Sure, Thats why He was stated the toughest one back in vanilla
---
Especially for alliance. If a good horde FC has the flag they can execute many jumps around their side of the map and become very difficult to kill. Hopefully these jumps are removed but I doubt that’ll happen
---
They fly now.
---
I generally only run dungeons for guildies, no point otherwise.
---
This.
---
As a hunter, best tip I can give you is whenever you DO manage to get in a group with a good tank, throw him a few gold to help cover repair costs when the run is over.  I have a few tanks that always have room for me for this very reason.
---
This whole thread started because someone said that people want to skip trash so they can clear it three minutes faster so they can fit one more run in after nine runs. Do you really think that's why?
---
That's a full frostbolt cast followed by PoM + another frostbolt. Freeze has a chance to break when the frozen target takes damage, not guaranteed to break when they take damage. Therefore it's perfectly possible for two spells land on a frozen target and be critical hits due to shatter. It's working exactly as intended and has nothing to do with spell batching unlike Shaman's Elemental Mastery in this video.
---
Best response in this thread! Do you mind linking your talents (ret noob here, but loving it).
---
Doesn’t seem possible without a lot more time to invest, which is ridiculous to me
---
Well I get asked to tank or heal a *lot* more often than I get asked to DPS so that's really not my experience.
---
Sorry but this is just plain wrong. Mage is right behind warrior in terms of popularity (16-18 percent of players play mage as their main). This results in a general high amount of mages in the raids. 
---
Compare that to Hunter which is played by about 10 percent of the population. This results in about 4 raidspots for hunters on average though if you are talking optimal raid composition only 3 hunters are brought. Since tier gear is your BIS you are fighting with practically nobody for armored gear. Your weapon drops 50 percent of the time and no other class can use it. You compete on rings which is generally the hardest one for Hunter to fill. But with AV and DM out you can solo farm two really good rings yourself.)
---
As someone who runs PUGs in MC believe me there is always an infinite amount of mages that wish to join and sometimes I have a hard time filling the hunter slots.

---
it's a bug that occurs occasionally when you release spirit you end up in some in between state where you're a ghost but not really. 
---
re-logging fixes it and resses you on the spot, which I took advantage of here.
---
This is so untrue it hurts. Stop spreading misinformation. 1 int = 1 healing, roughly, for paladins right now. Mp5 is a relatively worthless stat that only belongs in your "I only dispell this fight" gear. Mp5 is worthless the more gear we get because we'll get more spell crit. In raids I am already pushing 40%+ spell crit with ony/songflower.
---
wait what, I thought the enchant just increases your chance of not missing which gets irrelevant at 300 skill?

Imagine being upset over some pixelated characters lmao

What I wrote is a WeakAura so you import it into that addon. [Download WeakAura's here.](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2/files)

I got both Archmage pattern and Fire Resist pot off the same mob, I've never screamed louder in discord before since I was there for both (mage +Tailor/alch)
---
If you go 20/0/31 as a ret paladin you are hurting your raid sooooo much more than a standard 11/8/32 build because you'll need to make up 3% hit somewhere. Even worse if you decide to wield NF because you'll need 9% hit from gear instead of 6%. If you go standard 11/8/32 as a NF ret you have the ability for 5pc T2 while being hitcapped, and the total amount of gear you're taking from other specs is 0.
---
Were your tanks deep prot or fury/prot when they first started bwl?
---
no its not
---
I said onslaught and qsr already? You only listed 1 ring btw
---
I have no issue with you and any qualms or loot concerns should be between players and their guilds. I was voicing my own experience that guilds that place warriors and rets on equal level in regards to loot end up light on warriors.
---
It sounds like you and your guild have your situation well understood and not what I’m referring to
---
What’s the addon for the dot/curse timers?

Other ring is TER or painweaver from UBRS.

---
Prepare to learn that wow players treat tanks like npcs that owe them something.
---
I can't think of the nickname for them at the moment, but there's a reason tanks log in for raids and log out afterwards.
---
That does not imply anything other than this item is better than that item.
---
Say you are in the back of the line at a roller coaster or resaurant or whereever, you have 20 people ahead of you so you only need to wait for 20 peoples to get in.  The person at front gets on the ride and now there are 19 people left. The 19th person then gets in however the first guy gets off and cuts back in front of line so instead of only having 18 people ahead of you there are still 19 people ahead.  They keep doing this and it keeps extending the number of people ahead of you
---
that was good thinking
---
That's not my understanding. Higher your skill the greater your chance of getting a better yield. So for a copper vein at 300 you have a better chance at a better yield (more ore, more stone, more greens) than at 20 skill. Same concept applies at the highest levels, albeit not being able to get significantly higher than the range for thorium to "cap" out on your returns.
---
Min/max wrecked the vanilla experience the game is the same but the community is no where even close to the same anymore
---
Yes
---
I'd start focusing on leveling your main.
---
All tanks have OEB but the casters are foaming at the mouth  lol
---
Didn't someone from the horde come and kill the quest guy? I saw a post requesting horde assistance in this matter, did that not work?
---
MP5 is def better if you don't have songflower + Ony. With those buffs, Insightful Hood (as the other poster mentioned) is still better.
---
No shit but that's not what I was asking or the reason for this thread.  You're like the 5th person to reply with "Guides existed back then too" without actually reading what I wrote.
---
Not everyone bitches about ganking. Not everyone is Asmongold. I've been ganked countless times leveling recently, and I don't give a fuck. That's why I rolled on a PvP realm for f's sake.
---
My uncles have died **a lot**
---
So you exploited a bug,  then posted video evidence of said exploitation?
---
I would go to Fairbanks Alli. Its PvP and has a good core thats rebuilding. Look into it! ATM its a bit Horde side. like 40-60 ish give or take.
---
Because what you are asking is, did anyone complete XYZ on the very 1st day. Because beyond that, there were a shit ton of guides to everything
---
So if I understand correctly they are taking spots that would have gone to those who waited? Kind of like someone in front of you letting their friends run into the line with them? That actually makes sense. Thank you for explaining it.

I would start by leveling another class.

I have the flame guard gauntlets and I am human. I have devilsaur legs on now. The flame guards replaced the devilsaur gloves. I have the ony neck, blackstone, satyr bow, hit bracers, and Lionheart so that’s what? 7%? I will look at the dragon scale stuff.

Let X_i, where 0&lt;i&lt;101, be the maximum number on the ith roll, that is, the player on turn i must type /roll i. We set X_0=100 deterministically and the other X_i are random variables.
---
Since we know the transition probabilities P(X_i|X_(i-1)) by assuming even distribution of /roll, we may construct the stochastic matrix A with first column [1,0,0,...], second column [0.5,0.5,0,0,...] and so on. The probability distribution of X_i is given by A^ie_(100), where e_i denotes the *i*th unit vector.
---
In particular, e_(1)^TA^ie_(100) is the probability that the game is over by turn i. Let B be A in all entries except the very upper left element, which is replaced by 0. Then e_1^TB^ie_(100) is the probability that the game ends on exactly the ith turn. Summing over even i, we find the probability that the first player loses. Of course, we know from matrix algebra that (sum B^(2i) for i=0..inf)=inv(I-B^2).
---
Therefore, the total losing probability of the first player is e_1^T . inv(I-B^2) . e_(100) = 5049/10100 = 0.499901. It is very slightly beneficial to go first.
---
The following Mathematica script was used.
---
    M = Table[If[Or[i &gt; j, j == 1], 0, 1/j], {i, 100}, {j, 100}]; 
---
    UnitVector[100, 
---
  1].(Inverse[IdentityMatrix[100] - M.M].UnitVector[100, 100])
---
You're right, there's fewer people taking pride in being bad at the game now, which is a good thing.
---
What unit frames addon is that?
---
Stalagg alliance losing at least 3 more guilds. Server is dead on Ally side besides GRIZZLY and Fusion.
---
Hey man I theorycrafted a similar build awhile ago but gave up gearing for it because it requires rank 13, treants bane from DM trobute is miles better for ED builds and much cheaper to obtain.

If you want loot play a hunter.
---
I grief alliance every now and then, but dang that's messed up if a horde is intentionally bugging the quest.
---
But thanks for sharing this, I didn't know it was possible

Yes exactly that is literally what I'm asking.  And a few people have replied that they did.  Which is what I wanted to know.  But thanks for letting me know guides existed v0v

---
Which ally guilds left?
---
I didn't say 3 mins anywhere in that comment. Most times it's not 3 minutes.
---
You can still be an enhancement shaman. Every guild wants at least (and at most) one of them. Someone has to apply Nightfall after all. 
---
Aside from that, healing is fun, probably the most fun thing in classic, I don't know why so many people don't want to do it.
---
imagine actually thinking this
---
Flamelash, no question. You will get the 14 rank so quickly.

I'm so tired of alliance saying the word turtle. Having a defense is NOT turtling. A few alliance recalling is NOT turning your match into a turtle. Instead of getting mad that the "Zerg Derek" stopped giving you free wins a week ago, maybe actually try to adapt for once.

What server? I’ll transfer right over and tank your raids so that bum can dps... I hate dpsing!
---
I kite drak as a mage... just ice block when they're ready
---
Self deprecating humor is tolerable for only long at a party
---
Are you stupid? Chance to stun someone for 5 seconds that is not dispellable? Best thing for a mage trying to get the flag out of the enemy base
---
Just cast a 2 frostbolts and run/blink away. They should keep aggro for as long as they need uness 
---
1. Healers go too ham with heal aggro before drak leaves the room. 
---
2. Mage lets him get too close and gets conflaged
---
agreed.
---
I love landing an opener on a mage facing a wall, it’s always hilarious. Every time they blink into it, then nova, I break it with sprint and that’s game.
---
I use the twitch app and it installs through there just like any other add on. Just search gathermate2 and one of them will be a database. Make sure you have database 2 downloaded first though. Once you download that then go into gather base settings and load it. Let me know if you have any questions
---
Sulfuras has a good Ally population
---
Not dicks, just can’t let people with 60% mounts, not level 60, or trolls who don’t want to max honor production in
---
The comment you were replying to jokingly said “30 minutes instead of 27” but I can’t really think of anything outside of a raid where one or two extra pulls would be more than that.
---
I made a big mistake with my warrior.  Was one of first in guild to hit 60.  Was spec'd full prot from like 52-60.  Built up my full prebis tank set and then started working on my fury set.  We eventually got a lot of tanks so I switched to full fury spec but I still always get asked to tank so i just do it in my fury spec, sometimes full dps gear.  Having 15 range Sunders kinda sucks.  I'm also always the extra off tank in raid for things like garr/domo/harbinger so my parses suck even though I try to top the damage meter when I'm on dps duty

Making BoE soulbound on need really did solve a lot. 
---
I was in a DM group a couple weeks ago where Foror's dropped with two warriors in group. Healer and one dps immediately greeded, both warriors needed, tanking warrior lost his shit in a tantrum before rolls even finished, while dps warrior (who spends 90% of time tanking, and would spend the other 10% using Quel as part of dual wielding anyway) said "dude it's crazy cool this even dropped, just pray, roll, and grats to whoever wins." Final roller, rogue decides to roll need, wins, and gives it to the tank thinking they Did A Very Good Thing even though this is literally the sort of roll collusion that made Blizzard decide to port BoP trading from retail to classic for raids only. And rather than just be satisified, the tanking warrior spent the rest of the run verbally abusing the dps warrior (and holding aggro so badly I'm pretty sure the rogue's gear broke, which was an ironic sort of thank you/karmic payback).
---
The actual agency of everyone involved:
---
1. colluding rogue who took advantage of others' greed rolls to do whatever the hell they wanted.
---
2. tanking warrior who might have fairly won or lost but profited by collusion
---
3. dps warrior who might have fairly won or lost, and was cheated by collusion
---
4. the absolute biggest losers were equally the healer and other dps in group who rolled greed before anyone said anything, who weren't given an equal opportunity either to personally profit off the BoE drop or weigh in on how it should be handled, and who had to spend the next 40 minutes watching mom, dad, and mom's new boyfriend fight.
---
Soulbinding need rolls (and even better if they can make need rolls non-vendorable/non-disenchantable) would prevent that sort of nonsense.
---

I also brought my yeti from the bank, which I saved for just a thing like this then totally forgot to use it on my successful attempt.
---
Frost nova gives mobs a "frozen" debuff
---
Casting a damaging spell on the frozen target removes the frozen debuff
---
Shatter makes damaging spells on frozen targets have a 50% chance to crit.
---
Spell batching makes it so that when you cast CoC immediately after flamestrike, they will both proc shatter, as the game is too slow to remove the frozen debuff in a millisecond between the casts.
---
&gt;/afk
---
I meant after it ends without clicking the leave battleground button
---
Yet you still can't steamroll games lol
---
Well said.
---
For a Normal 5 man you can run full fury, gear, zerk stance and spec, and tank just fine. Occasionally tossing on a shield for really hard hitting bosses.
---
How did he break the agreement? The agreement was the OS was allowed to roll, but the MS new guy won the roll. How is that whining?
---
the extra 15 dollars a month for an account doesn't seem so bad for the chance to mutlibox, eh?
---
Sulfurus or Benediction
---
Most people don't conform to a sandboxed utilitarian thought experiment that fails to adequately account for the whole of real (or game) world circumstances. News at 11.
---
There isn't a boss in this game that has strict enough enrage timers that Deep Prot can't hold.
---
The number of mages you got when they have blink and snowfall to take no dmg is really sad
---
They’re good arena players but fumble in team play (all they do is aoe, don’t play the objective). They don’t know much about Classic besides what their chat tells them. They’re very very skilled players but don’t have the knowledge depth as the top pvpers do.
---
Also, you have 2 ring slots. Freezing/blood is very good combo
---
Ok good to hear lol
---
But still better than no humor at all.
---
I literally mailed the last epic I looted to a guildie's alt (Fiery war axe or something). I'm not some miser. I believe in doing nice things for people. What I do not like is unfair and illogical entitlement of "I can use so I get." If I was in a group, a warden staff dropped, we went to roll and a mage got it, or even a druid got it over me, I'd give them a "Gratz!! :D" and genuinely be excited that their day was just made that much better.  
---
I like seeing people succeed and get things, I don't like unfair ways of them being distributed.
---
Streamers doing the latest abuse in a 15 year old game to try and prove they are better than everyone else, in other news grass is green.
---
Dunno what games you’re in, but I don’t have any problems with steam rolling the shit horde players
---
Sorry to break it to you but if you dont use the queue to seek open world honor you won't be able to keep up with people that are actually going for rank 14, because you damn right know there are people in your server that instantly heart to karg or fly to epl right after their game ends.
---
Alliance side, Deep Prot can hold into 1.1k DPS, Horde side, it's about 900 or so. The vast, vast, vast majority of warriors aren't even coming close to that number.
---
The problem is there are grateful/kind people who deserve kindness, and there are loot whoring dirtbags who will take you for all you've got if you let them.  I'm old enough to be kind but with a touch of cynicism.   I've encountered more greedy/selfish folk than givers in my time in WoW.  That's why throughout 15 years the guild I'm currently in on classic is actually the best guild I've had in 15 years.  It's got the highest ratio of nice people who are team players, therefore I am very willing to help them with gold/items.
---
Think it's more likely an alliance player griefing his own faction
---
Bro you're Guild master.
---
Why the fuck you giving loot to lv 58s? As a lv 60 with decent gear showing up to a MC run with a new guild I wasn't even allowed to roll on my first two raids. The only gear that came my way was gear no other shaman needed.
---
That being said, you agreed to compete roll on it beforehand and lost. Not sure why you guys have such a terrible looting system set up but it's not something you should change mid raid. Use your authority and make a proper raid so dumb shit like this doesn't happen. I legit wouldn't allow a lv 58 to roll on anything. Same reason I wouldn't let a clothie roll on plate- Can't equip the gear.
---
It's only BiS until you get MC rings.  Even then, its only a few spell power better than Songstone of Ironforge but 105 less mana.  Freezing Band is a good ring but over the long term it is a PVP item more than it is a PVE item.
---
After the first couple of months, the ONLY reason anyone runs it is for orbs to get your enchants. Why would I ever join a group where the tank reserves all?
---
But hey, if it's clearly advertised more power to you. I simply wouldn't join.
---
My main is level 40 and still wearing the Seal of Wrynn. It’s a great ring.
---
Just won 3 games in a row vs premades lol, break their lines at galv and easy win cuz still pugs after all
---
Except that's the opposite attitude his guild is having, isn't it?  You're saying he should adopt your mentality of "sharing is caring!" while everyone else in the guild plays for themselves and asks for handouts.  
---
"Hey new guy, you joined earlier today and don't know us or even know if you like any of us yet, give us hundreds of gold for free!" - that's pretty greedy/selfish.  If they want the ring for that mage so badly, use the guild bank for handouts, that's what it's for isn't it? And that's why the GM takes all the sellable trash drops from MC.
---
I actually did get that bug with that croc being looted, I looted everything off it and it remained loot-able, it was just terrifying to see a character on my account standing in front of me looting like an out of body experience
---
I've put in a crazy amount of time and I'm only standing 15 on my Medium population server. These top 5 guys are putting in easily 20+ hours a day. These guys have to be botting or account sharing because it's so blatantly obvious.
---
So many times and not once has either of them (or any of them) been a golden pearl.
---
I have been playing mage for years and this has always been known. Freezing band is a noob trap
---
Herod Alliance lost 2 guilds by name but only 30 or so in players
---
Once people start realizing they’ll never hit rank 14 on a larger server, they will come to ours.
---
A. Enjoying the game
---
B. Not min/maxing
---
Pick one, the two are mutually exclusive.
---
Yeah but farming items to sell is also a good thing so that wouldn't really work.  Although I agree if the game could distinguish between someone actually needing it that'd be fine.  Imagine farming DM and compendium drops and no one needs it in the group but you also can't sell it, such a waste.  Someone could put it to use if they could buy it.
---
Butthurt.mov
---
Do you have a source for this information? I've never heard of it and a quick google search turned up nothing.
---
Because you will literally die if you dont sleep for weeks.. So they either share accounts, or they use a bot.
---
As the population of classic continues to decline... you got me though...
---
Ah. I thought you were asking the odds of any 2 pearls to drop
---
Not with two, but it's doable with three.
---
I bet the clam was like

No :) if you read my other comment, 1 int = 1 healing. There is 8 more int on T2 than whitesoul and whitesoul has 3 more healing. Therefore T2 is better than whitesoul :)
---
stop talking about BiS lists you don't know, especially in a 15 year old game where it's already been theorycrafted.
---
We haven't had queue times since the release, so must not be too many.
---
It's more for tranq shot then the dps
---
Who left? I notice you didn't mention Danger Zone and idk if I saw any of them the last few days.
---
Boom Boom Boom, Clap.
---
When people stereotype WoW players/gamers as being people who sit around gaining weight not contributing to society, you are their textbook reference
---
It shows how badly they want to stand out from the crowd.  Their commitment, spending unhealthy  amounts of time playing wow.
---
Okay so I have Viskag/fel what is seal fate hemo build look like ? It’s actually good ?
---
S T O P spreading misinformation. Holy fuck, you are just giving off this "I know nothing about classic therefore I am going to act as if my word is law"
---
Yes, in a guild where you are full of 95th percentile parsers, ret is dead last. For the majority of people that is not the case, and your good ret pally will be around middle of the pack.
---
The fact you're telling people to ignore hit cap tells me you literally have 0 clue about this game and you should stop giving people advice. So pathetic to ignore the hit cap dude, especially if you are a NF swinging pally.
---
Not rebooted, just put back on the air. There is a big difference and guess what - Classic isn’t open to wild changes. Its a replica not a fucking remaster!
---
Imagine being butthurt at how some other guild that you're not even in distributes loot
---
most of the top youtubers have not been around for logner than five years
---
Solid numbers, definitely competitive and competent, at least in my opinion, but again, you aren’t going to see many big gains as time goes on. At your max gear level, naxx level, you’ll still be less than MC fury. But hey those Warriors still need trueshot aura
---
Is the lobotomizer better than Mirah's song for PVE swords?
---
Not really, he's just saying it's insane that Shamans can do this much damage, which it is. It's a lot of damage lol.
---
Since everyone else told you to buy a new PC I'll play devils advocate since your processor meets the min requirements for classic. You can spend 20—25$ on eBay for a Nvidia 9800gt or preferably gts 250 1g, spend another dollar for a 4 pin molex to to pci-e adapter (4,6 or pin depends on card) and with that installed your pc would now meet the min requirements and technically you should now be able to play classic. I'd also just do a fresh install of windows but that's just me.
---
Assuming people who spend the entire day on wow are fat isn't a big leap of thought if you didnt have shit fot brains or a sensitivity to being fat. He may be a cunt, but he is speaking truthfully.
---
Have a read.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/SamandTolki/comments/ajzm5h/the_hidden_truth_boogie_doesnt_want_you_to_know/
---
same, and you cant even say you will just dont care because the min maxing affect everyone not just them.
---
As a tank people like that angered me so much. I don't care if people think they can "handle just one mob" it still splits the group so aoe is messy and creates more work for the healer.
---
Skeram alliance haven't seen any guilds leave as far as I know. Several guilds still have open slots for raiding groups, too, and the server has been pretty tranquil since BGs came out
---
Change the settings in your raid frames to enable keeping groups together. As it is now it's either in alphabetical or class or join order it something semi random.
---
Just enable keep groups together, in blizz raid frames options
---
I had friends on Alliance side on Azgalor...Sword and something...a few of them came over to FailureTree to twink 29s with us. People on that server were tryhards, but pretty fun.
---
So 1 or 2 then
---
Seems a bit weird to me to remove what is actually an efficient way to kill Garr, going for ranks or not. I get why they would do it for Golemagg though since there is literally no reason to hit the adds except to pad (or fish for nightfall procs as a warlock).
---
All of the honor PvP system is a prisoner's dilemma. If the top players simply agreed to get 10k honor in an hour or so and call it a day, they'd all win and profit. Unfortunately, if you know your opposition is doing that, it makes more sense to farm out and get ahead of them. You win either way.
---
In my groups, its comes up immediately after the boss is killed that has a drop that someone wants. Really weird timing.
---
Happy to Everyone else is as happy on Bigglesworth!
---
I'm out of the loop, why can ally premade and horde can't?
---
Oh i just assume everyone has Av rep
---
I loved Boogie until I found out he was extremely racist :\
---
For dungeons you're more likely to be accepted as a Mage. Better utility with portals, food and drink.
---
For raids you're more likely to be accepted as a Hunter. They likely already have 5 or more Mages, they could feasibly have 2 or 3 Hunters just based on population stats for the classes.
---
Just play what you like, neither are unwanted.
---
How is it? I ask since you have an Alliance flair. What I am dealing with right now is how absolutely outnumbered the Alliance are on my server in zones like Burning Steppes, WPL, and EPL. I can't hit 60 since I'm constantly ganked and outnumbered.
---
If an epic drops when I'm with guildies I will usually sell and split profits if nobody needs. If someone needs I pass.
---
Sorry, we're what now?
---
Everything above 7,7k hp instant dmg
---
fuck, that's so damn true
---
Yeah it's still dead lol. Got 2 60s there and seems like a lot of ally guilds aren't filling up their raids completely. Playing a priest I'm constantly trying to get poached by various guilds. Given it is the holidays and people have things going on but I feel like people are gonna start dipping from smolderweb.
---
But they get deserter so they wont be in ur next game and with 3 or 4 people doing it can be really fast tbh
---
No because of the debuff
---
i did play during bg launch, queues started at 7 min for av
---
Why would it be wrong you’re playing account at your house on your up
---
Account sharing is based on play style changes and other aspects
---
You’re just playing your account on another computer if that was the case most people would be banned in general
---
Yeah we run with 2 for mc
---
exactly like that
---
It should be fine as long as it is YOUR account you are playing on. Only reason I think those other people got banned for would be account hijack suspicion, maybe too much item selling, gold spending in an IP that the account isnt known for.
---
Yes I know but it’s a couple spellpower upgrade that’s it.
---
Shitty tanks dont, I would pull those mobs too.
---
Thanks for the quick response
---
we're a hardcore raiding/prog guild thats why. fully consumed/flask/all that jazz, and we're mostly all in full pre-bis or close, with lots of good MC stuff of course
---
I had this exact same scenario play out. Went back after the spider boss because some dude really wanted to kill them. Figured whatever then BOOM.
---
And The East Side Boyz are staying

More or less better than Freezing band is all ways except the meme root effect. 3 less spell power but 7 more intellect. Is 850G(in this case) worth 6 spell power over 14 intellect? Mind you that is spell power in general so Arcane Explosion and Fireblast can take advantage of it as well. 
---
A warrior can buy Lionheart Helm, their BiS until AQ while the mage has a chance to replace it the very same day from an MC raid.
---
In most cases not LITERALLY, but in some cases yes for sure
---
And people hide them because of the mentality from people like you.
---
Oh, nah I'm Alliance! Interesting we're on the same server though haha.
---
I dont play a sham in classic but I did in vanilla and I found shadow priests touch if I didnt insta delete them.
---
Haha so many salty alliance players downvoting lul
---
Lock cityyy
---
u wot
---
Sry which addon was it again?
---
&gt;It was Gnosis..... lol sorry im a scrub - ty for your help!
---
You must be looking in the mirror, wiener
---
Aurastone hammer. Healing will be a lot more support with totem twisting. Shamans are really bad procc fishers. Nightfall does not exist yet and annihilator has the worst procc rate. It is better to have nightfall or annihilator on an offtank
---
Cool thanks for the info
---
Executioner’s Cleaver is very solid, and can be found for fairly cheap in my experience.
---
The main issue I see is that for occurances of "need for use" people more often than not turn around and sell it anyway. Especially for 100g+ items, but even for cheaper things.
---
I didn't in the beginning but I always "gold need" in pugs now. I've seen too many items someone "really needed" announced in trade chat by them a few minutes after the run.
---
Warlock main
---
Hunter alt
---
Thanks for the reply, I'm curious what things annoy you about the shaman side of the shaman-paladin matchup?
---
I had 2 robe patterns drop in that spot in two pulls. Was a laughable moment. 2 mages in the run who both needed it. So it was a big win
---
You asked for the reasoning the people above said he is an arsehole. I just gave you the reasoning. It's up to you what you do with it
---
Hunters are one of the easiest classes to play at a competent level but I feel like they have one of the highest skill ceilings of any class in the game (especially for pvp). Granted I haven’t played every class but I’ve heard Kargoz and other content creators echo this sentiment before as well.
---
It's basically doing two actions in one server tick so the server thinks they happened at the same time. In this case having two spells hit at the same time.   
---
  
---
If you're casting flamestrike just spam coc so as soon as the flamestrike is done casting the coc goes off and they hit together. You do this because frost nova breaks on damage but if they hit at the same time then you get the shatter bonus on both spells. If you staggered the spells the flamestrike would break frost nova so you don't get the shatter on your coc.
---
Locks and hunters a both good gold farmers which will complement your warrior well. I believe hunters have an edge with tribute runs - but learning those definitely takes practice and is a high focus farm.
---
Yep #nochanges until they decide to nerf reckoning and make ret paladins bad in PvP too, the only place that they used to shine. But it's okay for shamans to keep doing 7k damage in one global, no prob!
---
Unfortunately, this only disables you seeing other player's talents. This does not disable sending your talents.
---
Details responds to direct requests from inspecting players, as well as sending your talents to the raid or party addon channels every 10 minutes. There is no option to disable this, you have to find the code in the addon and change/remove it.
---
`DELETE` the following block of code in `Details\core\gears.lua`:
---
	if (targetPlayer) then
---
		_detalhes:SendCommMessage (CONST_DETAILS_PREFIX, _detalhes:Serialize (CONST_ANSWER_TALENTS, UnitName("player"), GetRealmName(), _detalhes.realversion, UnitGUID ("player"), 0, compressedTalents, Details.playerClassicSpec.specs), "WHISPER", targetPlayer)
---
		if (_detalhes.debug) then
---
			_detalhes:Msg ("(debug) sent talents data to: " .. (targetPlayer or "UNKNOWN-PLAYER"))
---
		end
---
	elseif (IsInRaid()) then
---
		_detalhes:SendRaidData (CONST_ITEMLEVEL_DATA, UnitGUID ("player"), 0, compressedTalents, Details.playerClassicSpec.specs)
---
			_detalhes:Msg ("(debug) sent talents data to Raid")
---
		
---
	elseif (IsInGroup()) then
---
		_detalhes:SendPartyData (CONST_ITEMLEVEL_DATA, UnitGUID ("player"), 0, compressedTalents, Details.playerClassicSpec.specs)
---
			_detalhes:Msg ("(debug) sent talents data to Party")
---
	end
---
That’s cool man
---
ZT remains unchanged.
---
This argument is so weak. Tanking is a completely PVE centric role and outside of one bossfight each raid has like 3 tanks. Being a hybrid is so much more than just having two talent trees that do different things.
---
And Shadow is still a support spec because it's meant to provide shadow weaving. Shadow would be the worst spec in the game if it weren't for weaving because it generates a ton of threat and terrible DPS.
---
No, there is not.
---
Hundreds of clams farmed in the last few days. Still not one golden pearl :(

Druid tier gear sucks though.

Used to play DDO online in a permadeath guild. It was the MMO experience that was close to pen and paper D&amp;D with friends. As much as people think it isn't possible, it is. Master carebear here that also was a Mordred player and PK mudder.
---
Many items would straight up be wasted. And the economy would be much worse off. Many people would never get BoEs. I probably would never have gotten my Edgemasters.
---
No.  You could sell your alliance warlock and buy a horde warlock in theory tho.  Shady proposition and not sure if it’s against the TOS or not, but your only option beyond leveling a new Warlock.
---
&gt;You can't model conditional distributions (aka uniform integers on [1, n] given the last roll was n) with the method mentioned above.
---
​Surely you can prove this bold claim?
---
Also, you could run your script with m=2 and observe that it doesn't output even odds.
---
According to my addon "Extended character stats" I'm losing a bit of AP and crit by replacing a Tarnished Elven Ring with Don Julios. Is it still worth using Don Julios?
---
According to ToS its a problem if it was one acc and more people.. Doesnt matter if its one PC or the same IP, many people have multiple wow accounts, for example multiboxers running them all from the same PC and IP and they are allowing it because well, those people are paying for it..
---
The only way I know to do this is to have one window set to fade out when entering combat and a separate window fade in when entering combat and then vice versa when leaving combat. Then you'd just have the two windows positioned on top of each other if you want them to occupy the same space.
---
I bought a Band for 500g from a stranger. If I were to sell one to a guildie I would ask for like 3-400g.
---
You can’t have horde and alliance on the same server can you? Just transferred my Tauren Druid to Herod because they have a morning raid guild there.. been in the look out for the same type of deal for my Night Elf Warrior too...
---
Sulfuras is probably the most balanced server according to Ironforge.pro
---
I failed and the NPC respawned no more than 15 minutes later. I just sat and waited.
---
Won't rets be using Nightfall in P3 (or is it 4) for the 15% magic damage buff? That seems enormous to me -- certainly more than say an additional mage or w/e -- and it's entirely worth gearing up a ret to have them play that role.
---
As a pretty experienced Healer Druid, the tierset is actually garbage and you will perform so much better at healing with dungeon blues with lots of +healing than the tierset that has 1 mediocre setbonus and 2 absolutely trolly ones. The pieces of gear also have damage &amp; healing so theyre decent in PvP but really useless in pve.
---
You are an idiot. These dragons cast aoe roots that tick dot damage. Standing near it will absolutely kill you unsuspectingly.
---
I'm wondering how the hell your tanks are holding aggro enough that you can afford to use windfury totem. Our warriors rip aggro on execute phases constantly with salvation which is 30% reduced threat.
---
Tiny Threat calculates wing buffet.
---
You serious dude?
---
Don’t get your hopes up. Out of range kills do not give you honor as this was how it worked in Vanilla. You’ll be going against the no changes crowd if you try to push this.
---
Grats! We finally downed rag yesterday. 
---
after 4ish weeks of getting to him - 27 wipes before our first kill.
---
Mmm, I dunno. What's the story behind this video?
---
That’s fair but next time you spawn in take a look at how long that tunnel is. It’s fucking massive.
---
(... Pallies can use 2h axes, right?)
---
Hunters sell to other classes all the time. This is because only 2 packs of mobs and bugs are godtokr after king is dead.
---
LooKiNG fOr TANk foR StrATH LIvING ORBS RESERVED ArE You interesTED?
---
No one should equip Freezing Band honestly.  Just sell it for 850g.  It's a tiny bit more spell damage than pre-raid blues, and gets replaced by spellpower.  It's a total waste of gold and will not help your raid much.  It's good for pvp, but no one really pvps in this game at this point anyway.
---
PvE Alliance Warlock LF alliance weekday day my time raiding guild. Any suggestions? Currently on Mankrik

If he actually cares about some druid tierchest that is a massive downgrade to Robes of the Exalted, and doesn't want a top4 healer cloak in ALL of classic, then he's delusional and not very good. I wouldn't recommend prioritising him on loot because he clearly doesn't understand the power of some items.

Warrior? On a pvp server? With engineering? As a 1st toon? GOOD LUCK.  
---
An getting into dungeons as a rogue is really hard. Don't go rogue if you like dungeons.  
---
Go druid, OP. Seriously. Even if you decide that you'd rather be warrior - druids are good at farming gold, so you can just twink your new warrior to the maximum and powerlevel engineering with AH mats.
---
Deathrolling is a zero-sum game. Your expected net gains are always 0.
---
Let's play 1 million games of deathroll, with random starting values between 2 and 1000, and check out who won the most time between player 1 and 2.
---
    death_roll &lt;- function(m){
---
    
---
    	n &lt;- 1
---
    	roll &lt;- ceiling(runif(min = 0, max = m, n = 1))
---
    	while(roll &gt; 1){
---
    		roll &lt;- ceiling(runif(min = 0, max = roll, n = 1))
---
    		n &lt;- n + 1
---
    	}
---
    	if(n %% 2 == 1){out &lt;- 1} else {out &lt;- 2}
---
    	return(out)
---
    }
---
    sample_mean &lt;- 0
---
    for(i in 1:10^6){
---
    	sample_mean &lt;- ((i-1)/i)*sample_mean + (1/i)*death_roll(ceiling(runif(min = 1, max = 1000, n = 1)))
---
    print(sample_mean)
---
What a surprise, sample\_mean comes out at 1.500139, or, you know, really close to (1+2) / 2 as expected.
---
Heartseeker

Sili one is easy. Bring 1x sapper
---
Ah damn didn't know this. Its pretty annoying but in the end nothing HUGE especially compared to other issues.
---
Really, i'd just like to see the AV meta get fucked and blizzard make it so WSG gives at least somewhat equal honor if not more to transition to what this phase should have really been....actual PvP.
---
And here I am, excited about selling heavy stone at 20s/item!
---
Raid loot should never have drama. State up front what the loot rules are. If you agree that people can roll and win 4-5-however many pieces of loot then that's the rule.
---
Telling someone 'you're sad' that they won a roll is emotional blackmail and is the beginning of a full blown cancer in raid loot dispersion.
---
Loot should be passionless and straight forward. If it isn't, you have problems.
---
Mankrik PvE alliance has slightly lower numbers than horde, but there’s 14-15 guilds here that have MC/Ony on farm. 3 guilds have 700+ members and 3 raids teams each
---
corruption + shadowbolt + shadowburn....either of those last 2 crit and you might as well have not had that lil icey boi shield on in the first place haha
---
I’m in the same boat as you. As warlocks we rely so heavily on dots. 
---
My hopes is that Blizzard reverts back to a different vanilla iteration of AV. No changes crowd wouldn’t be too upset because it’s still in line with how AV was back in 2005, just a different iteration. Time will tell

Sounds like your getting upset for no reason not every tank is doing this and you can always find a tank that will do it for free. As a tank myself I almost never charge todo runs only time I do is when I see a post in lfg asking for a tank and they offer to pay or when I’m off doing my own thing and I get a random whisper asking to tank from a random who just /who and asks every warrior/Druid they see. But who cares if  some people charge it’s obviously in demand.
---
That's a garbage macro. You want the macro to only announce once.
---
But better yet, go into details setting and turn on announce spells.
---
As much as you dont want it to be, abusing the queuing system is cheating.
---
Grob mob!!!!
---
Ns is filthy. Honestly as a mage i prefer to deal with em, its so much easier to counter than the threat of ns
---
You can duo with a healer friend in fury spec if your gear is good enough, bring along a mage/lock that wants the belt and make it a 3 man for ez mode, you could probably even sell the belt runs to people to make it worth your healers time if nobody you know wants the belt.

&gt; I'm pretty sure sulfuras fireball can crit and is improved with spellpower too
---
I've seen a few Spelladin Sulfuras-wielders confirm that the Fireball proc does not scale with spellpower, which is also backed up by the wow.tools datamine.
---
Except you're full of shit and it doesn't always return 1.33 ...
---
Could you explain why?
---
Lol sorry wanted to give everyone a reply that offered input.  Didn't realize how obnoxious I was until after
---
Almost all classic servers are already way over-populated as it is, and the expansions would bring in people who aren't playing now. Splitting the population an extra way or two isn't a legitimate concern.
---
&gt;what i dont like is griefing
---
Go back to fortnight, we wanted a true-to-original classic.
---
Mages can solo farm it too, it was a great spot when the archmage pattern was going for 100-150.
---
Going with a solid: No.
---
Lol what’s your deal
---
Uh fuck that the guild might be shit no reason to give away an epic mount “for the guild” he doesn’t know them.
---
Usually, the problem, or rather the reason I want to skip is people being bad so the run taking forever anyway, and I don't want to add another 10 minutes... If I have a good group, I am down to clear all of Azeroth...
---
YMMV I guess, our guild only has 3-4 raiding mages depending on the week, usually 3.
---
We considered it, but we worked through people's frustrations for the most part and are on the right track now. So we aren't too motivated to throw a curve ball into the system. I think that's the best system if you can get the numbers right.
---
instead retail got...personal loot....i think your change would have been better.
---
I suppose we can end this argument here. I leave it to other readers to verify my proof and run the above script.
---
bloodfang right?

Welcome to the vanilla honor system. Put in more time or maintain rank while you wait for them to finish.

---
Don’t always have a mage in group or time to snag some off a mage. Even if you buy some off a random mage (since most aren’t going to just hand off a couple stacks to a random person for free), it can still cost more than a tank spends on repairs.
---
Is horde really only at 150k? Alliance is pushing 280-310, that seems wild. Also, 1.12 av opened the door for honor completey independent of skill, so theres not much you can do. Just wait it out tbh, 2-3 months after the first r14s, br1 caps will be like 2/3 of what they are now
---
Its not physically possible to get that amount of homor with out playing 24 hours a day.
---
How does Bluzz not realize these guys HAVE to be botting or account sharing? Its ridiculous. And makes ranking pointless for anyone who is not willing to risk a ban..

Stop looking at anime tiddies for a minute and learn the shortcuts. There’s ways to screen only a certain monitor, a certain selected window, etc via directly the keyboard.

But hey, what do I know.

I've had 3 pearls in 1.

If they are independent rolls then yes

Walk me through the logic here please.

That's what I ended up doing. Gave up on it for a while and just did some runs here and there.
---
pve is so boring
---
The results of decreasing MR to negative values is legitimately hilarious.
---
110 is the more likely number without sales or purps. Especially now since AV items are out, using sales numbers is BS. 110 is from 4 runs per hour and pure vendoring + mana pot auctions.
---
Just another freedom some people in the community abuse and use to grief.
---
I don't think these are "Blizzard hates fun" issues it's just the internet is fucking terrible and people will do anything to annoy other people.
---
tl;dr removing the kiting was good op is just in it for the nostalgia and admits leashing them is a good idea.
---
No. AV items are in the game. I actually vendored one a couple days back because its just faster to start another run than to wait for some fool to cough up gold for it now.
---
Na mate they’re just playing 24/7 for a month straight legitimately.
---
Fully aware and prepared for this.  The plus side, is dps is a dime a dozen.
---
If he is true support and goes mp5 gear and totem twists tranquil air with 4 threatcapped warrs, then it does beat having a diff spec or class as that slot, assuming the warrs can make use of the 25% threat cap boost.
---
Sure a resto can do this, but generally they don't as it messes with healing.
---
Thankfully almost 40 already, with some solid gear and a priest buddy to help.  Living that kush warrior life.
---
Nah. Epic mount will allow you to get your everything faster -- and that includes your BiS and preBiS items.
---
Farming mats, things to sell, getting to dungeons, not getting rekt by the opposing faction running around on 100% mounts (that's a huge downtime if you can't get to places cause you're dead... ).
---
Get your epic first, then worry about other shit.

Which is why I'm never getting HoJ :cries:

Nice to see the wife’s boyfriend giving that husband a early Christmas present

So you posted video evidence of you knowingly exploiting a bug?  Well that was fucking stupid.  That's 100% bannable.
---
Ret is a spec which can work, but you need to play it well in order to keep pace with mediocre players of mainstream specs.
---
I played vanilla as Ret to rank13 around the time Naxx was just out.  PvP is a great way for a good Ret to showcase their use of the entire toolkit - half of it doesn't get used in PvE.  **The big part to grasp about PvP as Ret is that mana matters.** You need it for cleanse, blessings, re-casting seals often, and heals.  Keeping your allies going is equally important to smashing face.
---
Ideal gear is rank12+13 armor or Avenger's set from AQ40.  They both have intellect and spell damage as well as strength and crit.  Some pieces of Judgement, Lawbringer, and Lightforge will also work.  I would stay away from Valor, since it doesn't have Intellect.  I would also avoid the lower ilvl pieces of Lightforge (bracers, belt, gloves) and the boots because the stats are awful.  A few pieces of mai are okay, but armor from plate does help; don't skimp on it too much.
---
You asked about weapon enchant, and my recommendation is Crusader.  For PvP, it's really a toss-up.  Crusader isn't that hot because half the time you'll be support or being kited.  Lifesteal sucks for similar reasons.  Spell damage isn't that spectacular, but has a slight edge in PvP as it boosts judgment damage and healing a decent amount and is dependable.  I say Crusader overall since you typically have the same weapon for PvP and PvE and crusader is a clear best for PvE.  Weapon chain is less valuable to paladin compared to warrior because you can still deal some damage or cast heals/support while disarmed.
---
this is the correct reply
---
In addition to Win+Shift+S, you can also capture the active window only by pressing Alt+PrintScreen.
---
As someone else with 2 monitors this shortcut saved me a lot of time spent not cropping when I didn't or couldn't use the screengrab.
---
I am not telling anyone to do anything. I'm simply explaining my thought process.
---
You have to play with REALLY bad players to beat anyone in damage as a Ret Paladin. As a raid leader, I would bring a Ret Paladin for their flexibility, but not for their damage.
---
Krol Blade is well worth the gold. Got mine at 51 and am still using it -- over 1 month after hitting 60. And it's long ago paid it's keep by earning me money from being able to solo farm easier than I would with Thrash Blade.
---
Although... The longer you wait, the less it is worth.
---
Any concerns about moisture settling in the micropores and leaving mildew or mold?

Don't feel bad. Just carry on.

you can literally watch bracket 1 rankers doing their thing, not everyone account shares (which isn't even against the rules, if its family.)

I am more than happy to lose 5 vs 40 in several minutes instead of wasting an hour in 40 v 40 turtling. Instant queue anyway
---
Done it before and people seem happy with it. Now my thoughts.  
---
Minimalism is great but it still has to give you all the important information.  
---
Your UI fails to do so, especially the raid window. Personal preferance here.
---
But I would put the map in center middle and if your going to use tooltips.  
---
Get the addon Tinytooltip and put it where the mouse pointer is.  
---
Like why disctract your eyes to the bottom right corner?
---
the tanks themselves have windfury too you know
---
850 gold is a much bigger upgrade to the player than a few extra points of damage on a ring for the mage. The epic mount will immensely help the player contribute more to the guild in the future than those few extra points of DPS which don't even matter that much in these easy raids.
---
+ How likely is the warrior to gquit?
---
+ How likely is the warrior to 'delete' the weapon?
---
+ Did the warrior (directly or indirectly) contribute to making the previous HoR?
---
***
---
In all likely hood if the Warrior had to help get the previous HoR's and you won't chip in now they're going to be resentful, regardless of PvE min/max implications.
---
I do watch Tribes, Monkeynews, and Maitoz but these are Alliance players with access to instant queues and AV premades. I'm playing Horde where you have 13-22+ minute long AV and WSG queues.

Next time you are raging about a turtle in /bg remember most of the horde only care about rep which you are giving plenty by dying in the turtle! keep playing alliance!

not sure what happened but he hasn't been active for over a week but if hes back around will do
---
Its only on par with Ashkandi, and BRE is widely considered superior to both.
---
Yes. An RoI that has already been established on the server. His is the only that's been posted for like 2 weeks. And before that they were selling in the 1500-1700 range. 
---
He is asking 1900 and is open to offers via whisper and in-game mail. Have already sent him an offer myself. He declined me at 1300.
---
Yes. It would currently take about 6 months to break even on the cost at 1900 without ever missing CDs. 
---
Honestly this is like talking at a brick wall. You so badly want me to be wrong because my original post got downvoted that you're trying to argue out of a well. But I'm not. He is asking a price just above the going price. And to reference back to my original comment, because of that price on my server, if I saw it posted at 800 I'd snatch it up without a second thought.
---
Uh... mages have a ton of competition. They compete with warlocks, hpaladins, and priests for items such as robe of volatile power (okay this is just good for pvp on mages), ToEP, spellpower rings, mageblade, etc.
---
On top of that, you have a ton of in-group competition because of other mages. Mages are basically tied for most popular class with warriors.
---
Mages scrounge for gear. Hopefully that gets better as time progresses but as it stands it ain't looking good for them.
---
&gt;Lol 10 dps. That's not huge for a ring slot even if it were true.
---
Huge for a ring slot considering they're similar levels of itemization. Yes I'm shitting on 70 health for PvE situations. I disregarded the crit because at that point you're very close to or at crit cap and more hit raises it. For maximizing damage in a PvE situation pushing the crit cap is valuable. 1% hit &gt; .52% crit in raid situations.
---
Got exalted like a week ago and wouldn’t ever join AV like many other allies if it wasn’t about honour. Keep turtling in 30 minute queues, the horde is proud of your skill :)
---
Finding your trainer to respec to holy.
---
Imagine sitting in a queue for &gt;10 seconds.
---
The sad thing is tanking really shouldn't be that stressful, but if dps can make their life 10% lazier by making your life 100% harder, they can, and they will.
---
Nothing pisses me off life a warrior dps who can't hamstring a runner. They should know better.
---
What if he doesnt want to be a healer?
---
hunter gets 2 AP per agi.
---
Other night literally had 10+ groups all looking for a tank to various dungeons ZF and above. I was just farming on my alt, and noticed none of the spots getting filled for about 20 mins. My alt was getting close to epic mount time, so figured I could fill my purse a bit. Go on my fully MC geared prot warrior (zero needs outside of a few rag pieces) and say I can tank any instance for the greens/blues that drop (allowing people to loot what they need as actual UGs though)--can even slap on my threat gear and probably clear stuff like ZF in about 20 mins with minimal heals. Instantly get flamed for being greedy, and instantly log over so people can enjoy their LFG further. "For the love of the game" isnt anything for totally random people who for sure wouldnt even return the favor if they could.
---
In my experience, if someone doesn't say, it's NA
---
&gt;Your Crit cap with 9% hit cap is 95%.
---
Holy fucking shit dude stop. That's yellow hit. That's 30-35% of your damage. White damage, the bulk of your damage, your crit cap is 100% - 24.6% miss - 5.6% dodge - 40% glance + your hit%. If you're raid buffed and only have 6/9% hit you're going over the cap and wasting itemization.
---
I wish dual spec was a thing so fucking bad. I love tanking. It's probably my favorite role, but guilds only need two tanks, so I have to DPS. I've tanked every single dungeon in both Arms and Fury, but I really want to try out Prot. There's just no justification for it. It's useless for anything else and I'd have to respec later anyway for raids.
---
I need to be in these raids... only tier 1 piece of Druid gear i have are the leggings. I’ve never seen the shoulders or vestments drop once smh

Except i hardly ever see anyone say that cause who wants to have to spend 5 minutes making a bunch of water before every AV. People need to get water before, theres probably a mage sitting somewhere in IF/ORG doing mage stuff, go talk to that guy

Totally agreed. Its a head scratcher for me that the OP needed on it v a mage, intends to sell it and hasn't been g kicked.

I honestly don’t really understand what happened here.

How are they and how is classic WoW doing compared to 2 months ago? Are the battlegrounds packed?

Oh no
---
What have you done

I farm this solo as a rogue
---
Being the guild warrior is getting depressing. "All for one and one for all" only lasted until it was my turn to farm HoJ and hit rings. Now it's "no, scholo."

Now that's a pro gamer move

Mage probably. They give more utility to the group than hunters.

Oh in raids 100% just open trade, when it comes to 9 minute AVs tho..

Hearthseeker is litterally the coward server, and every last alliance player I’ve seen from there in BGs is a brain dead backpeddler, no wonder they fled there servers.

Idk hunter is shit. Hunter is awesome. And thanks to feign death it can push meters unlike wars.
---
so much dreamfoil would go unattended
---
Mp5 is not the same as int. Mp5 gets worse for paladins because of illumination and our interactions with crit.
---
Mp5 and spirit are the two similar stats. Why the fuck are you arguing instead of researching these things?
---
What class/role?
---
Pretty sure they aren’t going to ever give more than 1 or 2 weeks notice.
---
I can't agree with this enough. I leveled a warrior to 60 and I feel so limited. I want to tank but I'm limited to 5 mans because guilds already have prot warriors filled. As a druid I can tank 5 mans and heal raids with HotW heal spec and still be able to stealth as a cat if I want to... I've leveled a druid to 15 so far and it's so much more fun at 15 then my warrior ever was through the entire leveling process.
---
The fuck are you talking about. Mediocre retail players are capping out classic skill cap
---
I mean they could be, we've never seen em
---
&gt; slam can generate 4.5k threat with shit gear.
---
You would need to crit 2760 to do that much threat, and if shield slam did that much damage in shit gear then everyone would run prot in PvP and just oneshot people.
---
Champion! Thankyou
---
I mean i get what you are saying but if they are really playing 24/hr a day like op says then
---
That means OP is able to play 24/hr a day to be able to catch them, which just proves that people are able to no life 24/hr a day
---
Thanks mate i’ll remember this one
---
Rogues have amazing CC if played by someone halfway competent.
---
Hope it will be in february:)
---
LOL how the game was meant to be played.
---
Okay I have a couple
---
1. I’m combat swords and a human, does weapon expertise and my racial stack? It only says +5 on the stat board
---
2. Can rogues do Mara/dm trib solo?
---
3. What’s the best place to grind from 58-60
---
4. How much bis do you need to be raid ready?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
MP5 is a lot more comparable to intellect than spirit. MP5 always gives the same amount of mana, just like intellect, while spirit only gives mana when you stop casting (not really practical for Paladins since they cast a lot of small heals).
---
Only difference is MP5 gives you more mana when fights are longer. Like on Rag and when you try to 20-man Onyxia, which I'd argue are the only fights worth optimizing for at the moment.
---
Yeah and I haven't had problems with it before the most recent patch, no clue what's really to blame, if tiny threat isn't doing something right or if ony is just kind of odd at the moment
---
Kind of? The druid t1 chest isn't good for either resto or feral raid so neither of you should roll MS for that item, it's simply a PVP item at best.
---
I've noticed you have responded to others with your loot system being MS &gt; OS, where does PVP fall into that bracket personally I lump it with OS? I don't feel you as an Officer should ask members of your raid if its okay for you to roll on OS as MS, it sets a bad tone in general regardless of the item, and certainly after rewarding the player with the item you shouldn't make any remark wishing for that item as that player is now feeling guilty and compelled to trade the item he won. 
---
Honestly it sounds like both of you care a little too much for the gear, that you don't even fully understand when it should be used. The fact you kept it shows you are more interested in a shitty purple in your bag you'll hardly if ever use rather than silencing the story for the interest for the guild wound greatly concern me if I was one of your raiders, if the guild management as a whole is this hung up over something insignificant as druid tier, how are you going to cope with legendaries and trinkets that people care about? 
---
The action is irrelevant and silly, the dialogue however could cause you issues I'd address sooner rather than later.
---
Yeah they just cut of your arm
---
I think charging for tank services is bullshit and no one should do it.
---
healed mc just fine at lev 56 and 58. You don't need that stuff as long as your specced properly (21/30), know what your doing and your gear is intelligent (ie brd, mara drops, quest rewards. lots of intllect,spirit and +sp on eveything). That said good luck getting into a try hard pug. Better to find a casual raid guild.
---
Maybe with move everything and a thin monitor. Three would work 100%
---
Vanilla had glider which was taken down by blizz, replaced by honor buddy, again taken down by blizz. Both devs sued for millions. You might have the odd private bot running around but selling a commercial bot for wow is a guaranteed multi million dollar law suit, no one would touch it. I think everyone is blowing this out of proportion. Have to complain about something right?
---
Botting in classic is nowhere near as prevalent as vanilla
---
Lmfaoooo RP walk immunity

I would be upset if it weren't so accurate
---
Lmao downranking flash of light
---
I've seen plenty of people trying for all orbs res. It takes them forever to fill. And they take 54+ so I imagine the low levels dont know what the orbs are. 
---
I feel greedy doing that. I just res one orb and then do free rolls. Everyone needs. This way I can make more if I'm lucky. And it entices others for the same reason.
---
Many tanks are nice fully geared and won't dungeon at all without something. 30g is a bit much. But 20g isnt. That's 5g a person. Which everyone will make through trash drops. And if the tank needs nothing that's not asking for much.
---
Neither is asking for some or all the trash blues only from bosses. No greens or boes though those are free roll.
---
&gt; Is raiding like this for other classes?
---
Probably. I main a mage. Literally just pressing 1 button. I may throw out a decurse every now and then.
---
Getting back into raiding vanilla WoW content reminded me of how much I hate 40 man raiding, and really made me appreciate retail raid design even if a lot of the systems in retail besides raiding are really lacking.
---
Not sure I'm gonna stick around classic much longer. Maybe I'll wait to see how BWL is but I remember BWL being a bunch of pain in the ass threat mechanics and tedious as hell trash in between the suppression chambers and the room after Broodlord.
---
:/
---
Or, you know, help your faction.
---
Ain’t that some ballshit
---
No, "of healing" gear is actually very strong if you consider stat weight. They will lack sustain compared to other pallies (from crit and lower mana pool) but that is uneeded in MC because fights are short. Pallies are incredibly mana efficient by default and can do very well in greens
---
Classic raiding didn't really hit its stride till midway through. ZG, AQ, and eventually Naxx are much more likely to stimulate and challenge.
---
Yup. Hunter is worst class for finding groups
---
Love this.
---
I got banned for a fair bit of shit back in the day, but model changing campfire -&gt; dark portal (which was INSANELY broken) was never one of them iirc

Never even knew this, will have to test it out and probably spam every bg I'm in until it becomes meta

I have the same weapon setup and its great. People dont expect the burst. You dont lose prep btw as some have suggested. you run 3/5 seal of fate with imp sap or 4/5 with no imp sap.
---
Its 50-50 either it drops or it doesn't.
---
thankfully my guild is big enough and have enough alts / fresh people for starting raid 3 that its not bad, but yeah, people started to raidlog more and more.
---
Well that's good to hear. Maybe I'll just wait for those phases to come out before doing anything serious.
---
For screech, a debuff
---
As an alliance player, I absolutely commend you for making this. Thank you.
---
tank drops 20% threat (has a minimum value i think) when wing buffet occurs. 
---
if you had someone else pull initial aggro (i.e, body pulling), the 20% buffer the tank would normally have does not exist.
---
so a DPS could in theory pull aggro from the tank while being at 60% of the aggro right? 
---
maybe i'm misunderstanding aggro here but i think that's how it works. (tank has 100k threat, dps has 60%, because DPS was initial aggro, he would have 20% buffer (unless that goes away once someone else takes aggro first time, which would make more sense). 
---
either way, during phase one you at the very least want to be &lt;80% of tanks threat, i wouldn't trust any addon enough to be above 70%, especially as the first phase of ony is only burned down for pure ego, take it slow and steady, pugs typically do white damage only on first phase and it works without a hitch.
---
I generally make 20 stacks of water and a 5 stacks of food before I start my av grind(as well as three mana gems) so as to avoid having  to make water inside av. If anyone ask for water they get one stack(two for healers). I spend my 2 minutes before the gates open giving all healers and heal hybrids AI(and of course giving water to anyone who needs it).
---
Shaman or Paladin.
---
The Warrior needs you to be decked out in insane gear, have a heal bot and be willing to chug consumables like it's a nax progression raid to not make you feel helpless. The Rogue requires you to have a Perdition's Blade and at least 5pT1 before anyone considers you a threat and not just an annoyance. The Shaman/Paladin are pretty much self-sufficient and don't have very high gear thresholds (and give you plenty of options to respec later down the line).
---
But it does sound like a pretty typical marriage!
---
Yeah, I used to do that for last stand. It was annoying when you need to smash the button so I changed to weakaura now.
---
One stack of mage water lasts more than one av. So at most you probably give out 5 stacks that cost you nothing. But people ask for buffs that cost reagents to promptly run it down and die. But you're right you shouldnt be expected to do anything helpful to your team. It's way hard for you to press a button a few times while there is actually nothing else to do. I advise you reroll a warlock cause performing one of your only support functions makes you file a reddit psa like everyone is bad people for expecting you to do one of the only things for them you can do. Must be terrible being a mage able to generate more money than any class have the least stuff to buy of any class and also be expected to press one button every few minutes for another player?
---
Making 40S is  better then sex? Im sorry
---
Well rogues and warriors are the only melee class? Unless you’re thinking about Druid. But that’s it.

I’d say rogue. You have a lot of counters and escapes. I’ve leveled both a rogue and a warrior to 60 and I wish I never wasted so much time on my warrior. Rogue is a lot more fun for pve and PvP.
---
Rogues are cool to do the stealth things, warriors are pro if you want to tank dungeons, retri is fun pvp. Shamans are very all-round chars.
---
Rogues are Pro for pvp, but I don't like them. 
---
Warriors kinda need a pocket healer for a lot of things others would do solo.
---
I guess all classes are fun, you should try them all and pick the one you enjoy most.
---
Yes, a few fucking insane people miss outnumbering the opposite faction and being camped while trying to farm for raids.
---
Just search this sub bro. Plenty of answers. Sulfuras, Incendius
---
why  are you not exclusively using fist weapons
---
2/10
---
anyone telling you ret and enhancement are viable are wrong. They aren't good in PvP, they aren't good in PvE. Sure, you can get dragged through dungeons and raids, but you will always be the least valuable member of the team. its not like it they are close to being okay, either, you get completely outclassed and piss off reasonable players.
---
It really isn't subjective, if you want to be a gimp, play these specs. Sure, ret paladin is funny to do reckoning bombs with, but your teammates will always know you could be actually power stuff, and you chose to go for a "lol 1 shotted" spec.
---
I think you accidentally submitted this to Reddit instead of Facebook.
---
Earthfury is a good choice
---
Hunter can push meters instead of warriors? Haha. That's why all the warriors and a few rogues are always in top 10 dps in MC.
---
For me that's a separate (and valid) remark But. Do you really think an average of 2 to 3 hours a day is less than the average time people play?
---
Pretty much any class. Ele shamans are best at dropping totems and supporting damage along with occasional healing from the back.
---
In a 1v1 situation it's pretty much what you see in PvP clips- engineering and huge burst damage.
---
WoW had at its peak 10.000.000 players, Classic WoW can have around 500.000-2.000.000, so who are theese billions of frost mages of yours?
---
If you aren’t getting wpvp honor in queues you definitely aren’t going to get r12-14
---
Sure I will
---
bro we got a guild entirely dedicated to druids. Almost no raid guild wants to let them join in.
---
We haven't had anothrr drop yet, just planning on what to do. We have offers to buy our ingots so that's on the table. It's more a question about whether it's worth it for a warrior.
---
Never played warrior before but just reached 60 on my rogue a few days ago (casual player) and I've had decent fun whilst levelling. I've just stuck with combat swords through to 60, seriously considered switching specs when WPvP got released, but resisted the urge and just camped in brd from 53/4 onwards.
---
Tip- start your own groups when looking for dungeons. I pretty much never got an invite when asking lfg in the channel. As soon as I started the invites I usually had no issues. Obviously tanks and sometimes healers on rare occasions are harder to find.
---
They have long ass queues and would rather play in a long AV than to wait forever
---
Rogues and Warriors (to me) feel like you do more then just Autoattack. Your main damage comes from pressing a button. Never had a Pally but for Shaman it is pretty much drop totems, shock on CD and the rest is autoattack and hope WF procs. I imagine feral Druid is much like a rogue though but with more options to heal etc.
---
I only had a Warrior in Vanilla and found it very fun and remember it not like what other people describe it as. But I haven't been able to get the mindset to roll one this time around. I am levelling my 3rd rogue though so take that as you will.
---
Nice.
---
Yes. I've leveled both and a tank definitely levels the fastest of all classes.
---
I would literally log on (especially past 40), and the PSTs start "*Hey, wanna tank XX dungeon? We can summon.*". That speed of leveling is unrivaled by any other class.
---
Hunters quest fast, but questing as a whole is much slower than dungeon spamming. And no one can spam dungeons better than a tank.
---
who cares. hes having fun, his guild is having fun, that's all that matters. classic wow is about having fun, not mix/maxing. if you're a turbovirgin and think WoW classic is about topping meters i feel legit bad for you. CS:GO an DotA 2 exist for a reason, if you wanna be competitive go play there. Classic WoW is about having FUN.
---
Remember a week and a half ago when people were all "alliance always wins" ? =D
---
Just leave if it's wasting your time so much
---
Is there a question there? I get classic isn’t for everyone.
---
If Archer reference....kudos
---
The problem with that is, you'd be so far behind in gear, you won't be able to do those raids. As a Mage myself, the raid content itself is as boring as it gets, but I get most of my enjoyment out of being with my guildies. Try engaging with your fellow members during raid, it might become more enjoyable.
---
Curator was fun, loved that burn phase!
---
Enhancement shamans are a meme. We had an enhancement shaman in our raid group who was essentially there to drop windfury totem and heal. Combine that with rolling on the same gear as warrior dps. As for pvp they are super easy to counter. At least ret pallys have bubble and can remove cc.
---
I'd rather turn in marks if you guys could figure out how to win vs 0 resistance.
---
Twink items would be worth much more. To have a chance at lots of BoEs you'd probably need to see item drop. Items like edgemasters are already insanely expensive. Imagine how much they would be if they were BoP for need. They would probably be like 3k g. The economy would be so drastically different. How you can't see this is disheartening. There would be less supply of BoEs. You might as well need something even if you really don't.
---
Early December was for BGs (phase 2.5). They said Phase 3 will be 'early 2020'.
---
Are u ok
---
It's better for them overall to win efficiently then farming an extra 200 honor jerking kills mid.
---
So is it healing you don't like? I don't mind healing because you don't really have to compete with others just make sure ppl don't die. Tanking is a similar story. Each have their own pressures though. Dps pressure comes from this misguided notion of having to top dps. That sort of competition is not something I am interested in but figuring out what you need to do to beat person X can be interesting.
---
Nah, mage...you can't see flair naked man?
---
I’m with you on this, I’m a 60 disc/holy priest and I enjoy healing 5-mans more than I do raids. In a 5-man what you do matters, but in a raid so many people fly under the radar.
---
That we are.
---
"We'll have an exact timestamp to share with you for this content unlock in early December" - literally the quote in the post
---
ive seen more Alliance being stuck up bitches about Horde Que times but that jsut what ive seen
---
I don't think anybody is alleging that this type of thing is only don't by streamers.
---
Nor did anybody say every streamer was evil.
---
In other news, the sky is blue
---
Yes, yes it is. Unless you're using elemental sharpening stones, because you can't put them on the flurry axe. In which case, Frostbite.
---
Well against pugs i guess thats a valid point, doesnt really apply to premades tho, win basicly every match and even when we lose were not at all afk.
---
850 gold is an instant epic mount for the winner. How is that less important than "main spec prio"?
---
Basically any class can get some sort of upgrade, often BiS for that kind of money (lionheart, edgemasters, krol, robe of the archimage, enchants... ).
---
This entire statement just shows how foolish you are, lol. I really really really wish the honor earned every week was reflected in your ability to PvP instead of mindlessly drone the same instance loop over and over again like you're gold farming.
---
Yoooooooooooooo
---
So you're saying that you are premade-queuing AV and even though you're part of a pre-arranged team you're being a douche about handing out some water?
---
It’s all about perspective. Horde and Alliance don’t compete against each other for rankings so those sweaty premades just make it worse for alliance if they aren’t a part of them.
---
wait, afk-ing in battlegrounds is bannable? Why though?
---
As a Warlock, raiding consists of pressing one key (Shadow Bolt), doing subpar DPS with it compared to Mages and only get active in between to summon slackers or make Healthstones. But we'll, that's classic. The upside is that raiding at this stage takes 3 hours / week max and leaves you a lot of time for the fun parts of the game.
---
Shaman is probably the most engaging healer on Horde. If you’re bored you’re probably not a healer at heart.
---
One man's trash is another man's treasure. Regardless of the PvE (damage output) implications the status-symbol nature of the weapon would likely bring an incalculable amount of joy to the owner. If it's not necessarily reserved to a Warrior (and I get that guild resources should ideally be focused on guild progression) think about how happy/the job it would bring someone.
---
Walock. I have a 60 warlock alt and it's a blast. Raid DPS won't be fantastic in a geared group til later on, but you'll always be in demand for your utility. Plus, as others have said, you can solo literally anything and are hard to beat in open world 1v1 PvP. 
---
I say warlock all the way.
---
I really didn’t like the open world PvP phase. It made a lot of alliance on my horse dominated server transfer off. 
---
The BGs are a welcome change. I really enjoy them.
---
People are getting a lot more than 5-8k per hour.
---
Ally premades get about 14-16k
---
Horde playing properly get about 10k.
---
This is a lot of words for “AFK in AV”
---
AV premades arent pre arranged teams lol, imagine 600 people queing at the say time and joining if say 30+ are from the premade discord and have a queue pop for the same av #. You dont actually know any of these people. Look up av discords if your curious how they work.
---
50000 crocs used to live here, now it's a ghost town
---
You can't transfer into faerlina, only out.
---
Lok'tar ogar isn't about leaving fellow horde too die alone. 
---
As a mage IDGAF what server they're from, what class they are, or how many Ali are attacking them. We are either winning the fight or respawning together. 
---
I'll suicide bomb a group of 20 Ali to buy time for brothers to come and wreck whatever is left.
---
Rogue
---
Quick question, if i apply magic dust to a beast and i begin to tame it, will it work?
---
I haven't seen a change on the alliance side, all the big guilds are still here and asmongold and esfand both said they're staying.
---
Why not? There's millions of players playing why not try to make it better? And even if it's just 'back on air' I can still say that shows shit if it is.
---
Yeah, I wish more people needed Ony attunement. Then I could get a group to kill anger lol
---
Hey salty mage! Sorry you dont like the truth? Idk what to tell you. If it makes you feel better just know Im terrible at the game.
---
Its not worth it pve-wise, it’s a pvp weapon for warri. Put it on a retri:-)
---
Warriors are often tanking, so when you cover tanks and start looking for dps ofc mages would be most common to looking for group on dps slot.
---
&gt;Healers are only acceptable at one role
---
Uh, nuh uh?  
---
Ele/resto is god tier PVP burst and passable PVE DPS. Druids are amazing flag carriers and more than passable PVE healers/tanks. Priests have 2 amazing PVP specs and two amazing PVE specs and Paladins are the ultimate support class. The only class out of these that is truly limited in classic is the Paladin because they only have auto attacks and judgement.
---
What has been working for me is trying to push myself and seeing how much damage i can do. I've farmed everything i can, use consumables and do little things to add even more damage, like doing 3 life taps in a row to get a tick of passive regeneration, Shadowburn/Death Coil if i've to move, use Demonic Runes, Mana pots, etc. Molten Core is easy, sure, but if you're fighting to be top dps with a class that shouldn't be top dps then it can be pretty fun.
---
In your case you could play the healing meters.
---
Silithus for AQ and epl for p6. Yes, otherwise wtf is the point of pvp gear outside of bgs. Also the 6 world bosses being heavily contested in pvp servers
---
You seem very salty about how horde wins PUGs.
---
The thing is that Paladin absolutely cannot do tanking or dps due to how important threat is for tanking or their performance is for dps. Outside of a few quests or boosting people through dungeons paladins are only useful for healing and buffs. Their so-called "dps" peaks at level 20 or something when compared to other classes.
---
Shaman might have 2 roles but not really. They have burst but that's about it, which is good in PvP scenarios sure. 
---
Druid is a real hybrid I can agree with that. Their threat gen is functional for 60 dungeons at least, they can also heal or do decent dps when compared to paladins or shamans.
---
Buy 2 Felcloth in AH (4g), 
---
Create Mooncloth every 4 days, 
---
Craft a Mooncloth Bag,
---
Sell it for 20g
---
That's 15g profit every 4 days. Not much. But do it on 3 characters (need to be lvl 35 though) and it's ~80g for free each week.
---
I have about 70 black lotus right now but I'm holding off on getting more in case blizz ups the spawn rate like they did with devilsaurs. Feels risky to hoard them
---
It’s a really toxic meta unrelated to any skill and devoid of any value. AV honor should be 25% of what it is.
---
To be fair it's not exactly.. 2 people. Hint hint.
---
Have you thought about that maybe it does but you're not invited?
---
Where are you going to find Alliance in WPvP?  They’re all in BGs.
---
That sure would put a smile on even the most depressed neckbeard. Sometimes, I wish I could get like a black lotus from a high-level herb. You'd think lotus would be much higher in price than an arcanite crystal. Since crystals are just random rng from thorium nodes, unlike lotus which has a specific node for it &amp; in the current state of the game, if you aren't a shaman or hunter, good luck farming them.
---
If my main wasn't a mage I would for sure have gone for mining. But since I've got like 3-4 different farms I can do in DM:E, herbalism is still king for me. If I really wanted to, I can solo the last boss &amp; get rich thorium veins. But the time I have to invest to get there &amp; get him down isn't worth it if you can solo the rest of the dungeon &amp; have a much more afk way of making money.
---
I know no one has any way to find out, but I just pick the first responder, even if they’re separated by a half second
---
That mage must've been doing that poop coke they're talking about in guild chat
---
Clearing you are playing more inefficient than other horde rankers.
---
That’s the joke 👍🏼
---
If you're in full pre-raid bis sure, but what are the chances that a lvl 58 will be full pre-raid bis ? It's not guaranteed for a 60 either, but chances are most of the 60 in your raid will have that.
---
you get 3k crits with shield slam with only T1 and T2.
---
Shield slam is cheaper than bloodthirst and does more threat. Until you have shield slam there's not a lot going on in there just like most warrior specs.  
---
Say you get 900 threat for 20 rage vs 500 for 30. Oh and because of those numbers and the fact you work in tactical mastery to the build you can charge, swap stance before you even get there, melee hit and shield slam. There's a lot going for an actual prot build. What isn't going for it is scaling. Shield slam scales like dogshit.
---
Oh yeah, I sorta derped over that function.    I feel like this could also be potentially bad for newer players or people who simply don't pay attention.  Maybe someone hits need on a BoE cause he's new and doesn't realize it's not good for him, and his comrades explain to him that his class wouldn't do well with it.  Then he could sell it or trade it afterwards, but then it's soulbound and goes right to the vendor.  
---
I don't really see a solution that covers all bases tbh.  People will be people.
---
Yeah I came from wotlk healing and remember raiding was awesome. It's still fun but not even half the fun it was in wotlk.
---
The fights are like 1-2 minute long instead of 10. Thought I would use all my cool spells in raid, spam flash heal instead.
---
Oh and nothing really happens.
---
But tons of other things to do so having fun!
---
This will probably be controversial, but I'd like to see spawn rates tweaked by server population. Lotus on Whitemane averages 70-75g. Without an adjustment, I'd be surprised to see it at less than 100g come Naxx. That's six or seven hours of EFFECIENT farming a week just to raid Phase 6 content on Lotuses alone, plus other consumables, additional herb costs for flasks, PvP respecs and probably a flask for the latter half of AQ as well. I'd be surprised if you're looking at less than a dozen hours a week. Of farming. Just farming.
---
It's too much.
---
Even fairly casual guilds can clear in 2hrs. So it can't be THAT much of a slog :p
---
Have you actually spoke to him about his attitude? And that it is not appreciated when others are in the same boat.
---
If he doesn't respond to a friendly and we'll reasoned chat. You are probably better off without him, before the toxic atmosphere spreads.
---
grats :D
---
Easy once you get it down, I suppose. They can solo various dungeon bosses for gold. 
---
And once more spell hit gear drops they will be able to compete with and even out DPS mages, if they get some threat reduction from paladins/shamans.
---
It never ends well especially in a class that might not have any upgrades in MC. BWL certain items can be used on many specs think they are loot obsessed now the BWL drama broke a few guilds on EU silvermoon back in the day.
---
1. yes take expertise.  Only 2 points and it improves your glancing blow damage from 85% to 95% on 40% of your attacks.  Basically a 2% or so dps boost.  GOing from 300 to 305 is essential, but 305 to 310 is quite nice.
---
3. Run BRD until you get your HoJ. That should take you to 60.
---
4. Rogues are already ahead of the pack in dps, just by showing up.  For me though, as a officer and tank, I like seeing dps putting in the work to get their pre-bis.  It shows that you care and don't expect to be carried.  That being said, you can step into MC the moment you turn 60 and are attuned.
---
There's a guild function called /guildkick, I suggest using it on such players.
---
Then I suggest you give it a go. Its fun. Its easy and 400 000 of us does it every week. Which is why this sub would be nothing but "Wow my first ever rag kill, so proud.." and that is how quality content get lost in a sea of low effort shit. Be proud and shut up about it.
---
Join the biggest server you can. You want a big community. WoW classic is still doing well, but it's only going to slowly shrink over time.  WoW is community, go to where one is.
---
Anyone knows an adding besides weak aura (too complicated) that makes free casts pop out more?
---
a whole 5 silver
---
Pro tip: Ditch those shitty shoulders and get valor. Defense is over valued.
---
Yeah one rotten apple can spoil the bunch
---
Must be some add-on screwing it up. Never had this issue.
---
Dunno about their stats, but all MC units are immune to gutgore rippers effect, so that is probably how it is
---
Historically it was a remnant of specs that got scrapped before completion letting the items designed for such specs in the game.
---
Melee priest and warlock come to mind with priest's inner fire and the warlock fire stone
---
Classic is incremental upgrades. An unlucky guild may never see a certain drop over the lifetime of their raids in MC etc. Hes obv a retail player wanting new purplez every time he raid logs. AIDS. has he got his pvl set together? Trinkets/rep rewards yet? Crafted bis? Epic mount? Gold income? Heaps of shit to do in this game that isnt endless streams of pURplEzzZ
---
Your imagination is likely wrong then. As I said, if one hasn't got the AV rep yet, one simply doesn't care about it.
---
I've told him that he doesn't share the same outlook as we do, and that loot isn't our priority.  I even shared a story about passing on a set piece I won so that someone else could reach a good set bonus.  The less forceful approach doesn't seem to work, and I'm at the point where I feel like I might just have to say "hey, you're bothering people".
---
Well to be fair hunters can solo just about anything too.
---
All your other points are accurate though
---
A guide isn't 3 hours.
---
Thank god there's a back entrance behind DB South tower.
---
Denial.
---
Rattlegore!
---
You might want to define what does it mean "pvpers" and "pve players"  for you, it looks like you fails to understand the basic terms.
---
Yupp, the only gear hunters get is tier and leaf. After that, you're basically on the waiting list for everyone else to get their gear before you see any loot
---
lol instant invites must be horriblefor any serious ranker
---
I can make some snack, take a shower, go for a smoke etc. while waiting for av queue and still get maximum honor/h, if I'd be alliance I'd have to stop eating/showering and get a piss bottle to maintain the same level of play
---
He would be the first person we've gkicked outside of people that quit playing Classic.  Is there any way to reach someone like that?  If not, should we tell the guild about why it happened?
---
Pre-mades, at least the ones that aren't super hardcore with arbitrary requirements, don't guarantee victories. It's just for the sake of having a semi-coordinated group of 20-30 people who know better in order to avoiding dumpster fire situations like this.
---
What lol? ZG and AQ20 exist exactly as catchup raids
---
Crappy economy and it’s more difficult to find groups for stuff.
---
&gt; 3k honor for 10 mins aint bad  
---
Its not 10 mins, its 28 mins cause we are up to 18 min ques, trash honor per hour.
---
&gt; but w/e, keep tping into drek 
---
Trick is to be there before hand so you can pull thats huntards pet into marshals before theyve brought a tank or capped a GY lol
---
I love my rogue. Just make your own group. I did basically lead all my groupe from lvl 20-60, and i was almost full pre raid bis by lvl 58.
---
Yeah if you've got the name-realm and you were in group with them you can whisper them for a while. Might be always able to but only really happens after groups usually.
---
plus in 5 mans it feels like you have more of an impact compared to healing a raid with other people.  i kinda wish there was hard 5 man dungeons to do that required raid gear.   atleast pvp is always engaging
---
The guild leader of Supreme on Remulos transferred I think. After disbanding his guild and taking the guild bank. He was lazy and a baaaaaaad Warrior though. I feel our realm is far improved with Millard gone. Just him being around brought the whole standard of our realm down.
---
Good riddance to absolute trash.
---
&gt;it's about hanging out with people you like while getting some items with purple pixels
---
Or hanging out with about 15-20 people you like, 10-15 who don't say a damned thing so you can't really form an opinion about them, and like 5 that you can't fucking stand.
---
Who is going oom as a holy pally in MC?
---
Ahhh tbh I never even considered making them with purchased ingredients haha. I call it passive in the sense that I'm going to be grinding something either way, but with alchemy the fire elementals become 2g more valuable without any extra time invested from me.
---
I also make tips crafting weekly raid pots for guildies which totals around 20g. Plus 15g per week selling my arcanite transmute. That's probably closer to a truly passive form of income.
---
A warrior in my guild used ClassicSim recently for this purpose, I cannot speak for how "accurate" this stuff is, but this is what he came up with:
---
2H Fury-weapons from MC/BG Phase in order from Best to Worst(As Orc, no additional +weaponskill):   
---
R14 Axe   
---
BRE (\~0.6% worse than R14)   
---
Spinal Reaper (\~4.2% worse than BRE)   
---
OEB (\~0.4% worse than SR)   
---
Sulfuras (\~0.6% worse than OEB)"
---
There are practically no top servers with these hours.
---
Every realm will stack honour. The top rankers will almost always get together to stack honour so they DONT have to play these hours, and can still rank. Golemag has some issues where people don't want to honour stack, but basically every realm will have top rankers stacking honour.
---
Sometimes there may be a few people who won't stack honour, but that's very rare.
---
Any decent premade on alliance is farming at 20k+ honour per hour
---
On my server it's 40g so ill just buy it when the time comes.
---
Ribbon bro

Download an addon called Spellannouncer classic. It's on the twitch client.

Have you by any chance written some guides?
---
I got my Shaman alt to level 60 a couple of weeks ago and ran my first raid earlier. I basically shot Lightning Bolts on trash and Chain Heal on the bosses. It was pretty engaging as far as MC goes. \*Only\* healing sucks in MC. There isn't enough damage going out for you to heal most of the time. You end up just standing around while the Priests do all of the work.
---
[This](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/55030105030215--0523031100501) is my Shaman's build. I only wear mail gear (mostly the Elements set + Merciful Greaves) and a shield. No raid epics aside from the Aurastone Hammer that I just won earlier. I have tanked most level 60 dungeons, including UBRS, with this build. I also DPS and heal in dungeons - I can fill any role that's needed.
---
TLDR: Shaman have a lot of hybrid potential, but it only adds value if you understand that you heal against actual raid bosses. Game mechanics are very unfriendly to Shaman DPS (and tanking) against a level 63 mob. You can do anything against level 62 and below, however.
---
but this is my bnet friend we were not in a bg together and i sent other ppl in my realm to whisper him too and it worked
---
Goblins 1 
---
Human 0
---
You probably still lost
---
Must just always work then as long as you've got the name. I know the battlenet side of it works too.
---
Ofc! I mean they do the same, but Don Julio just does it much better!
---
Crit, hit, dmg. But you will get more from Don Julio.

Currently a lv 38 warrior, I manage to get a really lucky won a need 6 roll on ravager. Should I continue to level in strangleghorn vale or head towards desolace. Is it possible for me to make 25ish gold in the next two levels for my 40 mount. My mining is on lvl 80 but my skinning is really high. What are my main game plans for levels 40-50. What areas, really important quests or items I should be aiming for?
---
Are YOU colorblind? It looks accurate to me.
---
I dinged 60 last week as Hemo and I would stay combat swords if I had to do it over again. Assuming you are combat, swords is a stronger spec than daggers with the gear you have now. 
---
Sub/backstab is ok but not great for questing since you lose a lot of burst damage (adrenaline rush/flare flurry) in exchange for control and being slippery in PvP.
---
they were doggin esfand, no one here is ripping on your boy.
---
Why are you complaining? Your vision is either terrible to the point you can’t see whatever is on the picture or you are just pretending
---
You know you can solo this as a rogue :p?
---
Dude, read what you wrote. You said ally premades lose 50/50 to horde pugs, then said, and I quote, 'that should tell you all you need too' [sic].
---
I'm paraphrasing what you wrote.
---
Did you ever consider that it might have been a joke?
---
It is possible for Paladins to dump extra mana with Holy Light. Maybe not as easily as Priests or Druids can, but they can still turn extra mana into extra healing. You're the problem if you're ending fights with extra mana, not your gear.
---
I will admit that MP5 shines on progression. Most people posting have had current content on farm for months now. But you should be gearing for BWL, which is a raid that a lot of guilds might not actually clear first week.
---
Fuckin boot him, my dude. He's doing you a favor and exposing this loot goblin bullshit attitude early. And in MC of all places, prob the easiest raid to get a shit ton of loot. How do you think his attitude is gonna be when yall are wiping in BWL or AQ? When progression has stalled. Lose him, you don't need that kind of drama weighing down the guild because it won't get any easier going forward.
---
Honestly feel bad for the people that think this is "normal" because it's not. If one of the two wants to do it like once or twice a week and the other wants to do it 3 times a year, that's clearly an issue worth solving. There can be a ton of solveable reasons why either one of them might not want to have sex but to just sit there thinking "Oh well, that's how marriages work" is ridiculous.
---
If only you didn't post this in 2.5

Here we see the tanking warrior dabbing on Onyxia.
---
I don't care about your points because they are factually wrong, and you're borderline an idiot if you think int and mp5 are "pretty much the same".
---
Hope things are looking up for you my man
---
too bad the horde queue times are too long to actually do a premade.
---
Lol ok
---
that boi is true neutral and you know it
---
I can't say anything about hunters but I can tell you the main points for and against warlock from my perspective
---
Free mount at 40, cheap epic mount (mine was about 150g but I bought the mats in p1 and had a warlock provide the mats for the last step free of charge, usually they take 50g)
---
free 20 slot soulstone bag at lvl 20
---
you will barely corpsewalk between level 20 and 60 (ss for yourself if solo or the healer if in group)
---
you will never have to wait for your party to get to the dungeon, but on the other hand you will almost never be ported anywhere (if you make it a habit to reach the dungeon early people will remember you ;))
---
you will have 1 bag slot less for inventory
---
you will spend at least 30min a day farming soulshards and everyone will act like they can be conjured up like mage food
---
you will get random whispers from people you don't know, asking for port, getting salty when you tell them "only if you search for the 2 people to click"
---
if you can fear or banish it you can solo it
---
stongest 1v1 specc in the game
---
dots are ridiculously op in pvp
---
every other caster will fight over briar-reed from jed for 29sp while you can just settle for the dm warlock-trinket with 23 sp
---
you don't feign death, you die like a man and get up again
---
unobtainable hitcap atm means you can focus on the cool stats instead :&gt;
---
Druids have a number of pros compared to Rogues
---
* Easy leveling and gear up
---
There's low downtime leveling as a feral druid thanks to your separate mana and energy/rage bars. While you're killing a mob, you'll slowly regen mana for heals afterwards. In dungeons, proper tanks are extremely rare and you'll be able to fill that role perfectly. In later dungeons and raids, you'll can easily get unneeded caster gear if you want to transition to healing for raids.
---
* Multiple playstyles
---
Druids have a bit of tank, melee dps, caster dps, and healer in them. If you ever get tired of focusing on one thing, you're just a quick gear swap and/or talent respec away from doing something else. There are also a number of hybrid specs that do well in raids and PvP.
---
* Great utility
---
With Mark of the Wild, Thorns, remove curse, abolish poison, Innervate, Battle Res, Faerie Fire, Roots, and offspec healing, Druids can bring a lot to a fight outside of damage, healing, and CC.
---
* Great group PvPers
---
Thanks to their utility and versatility, Druids are great to have around. They can stealth around with Rogues, tank two warriors until allies can help out, catch enemies trying to flee, run flags in Warsong Gultch, or just churn out damage and heals. In a clutch situation, Druids can always flex to temporarily fill any role, even without the proper spec or talents.
---
----
---
But as you level, you're going to realize Druids have a few lackluster qualities.
---
* Weak numbers
---
You won't notice it while leveling, but certainly in raids and PvP you're going to notice that your numbers are a bit weak. You won't hit as hard in Cat form as a Warrior or Rogue, you won't be as good of a healer as a Paladin/shaman or Priest, and your Moonkin form won't crit as hard as an Elemental Shaman in PvP. Druids are still great at tanking dungeons and trash mobs in raids though.
---
* Low CC for PvP
---
Rogues hold a ton of CC they can use to turn PvP fights around. Druids only have Bash (a 60 sec CD stun in bear form), Pounce (a short stun that can only be used from stealth), and Roots (1.5 sec cast time root in caster form or 60 sec cd reactive root to melee attackers with talents. Easily breaks with damage). If you're a Tauren you also get Warstomp, but that means you'll have 3 stuns that suffer from diminishing returns. This is not a lot to work with.
---
* Few impactful cooldowns
---
Abilities with cooldowns are always more powerful than an equivalent ability with no cooldown. Druids really only have two good ones: Nature's Swiftness, Innervate, and sprint. Hurricane and Tranquility are rarely used. 
---
* Poor 1v1 capability
---
Rogues can kill people before they have a chance to do anything. Druids, if they manage to win, kill people through a very slow and tedious process. A combination of all of the issues listed in the above bullet points make 1v1 fights a struggle in the end game.
---
A bit disappointed now as I actually expected a warlock. Still congrats though!
---
Yeah this is the worst part of classic. Both optimal class rotations and PvE encounters (even into Naxx) are very simple and stale with few exceptions. At least the tuning will get significantly harder so it does take a bit of effort compared to the faceroll content out now.
---
Nice pose!
---
You said:
---
&gt;Anyone who heals will tell you 4 MP5 and 1 intellect is worth more than 10 bonus healing
---
Except ONLY YOU say this. Every single GOOD holy paladin will tell you you're a fucking idiot for saying this, because 10 healing is worth SO MUCH MORE than 1 int and 4 mp5. It's astounding someone can be so obtuse in a game that's been theorycrafted FOR THEM already.
---
You're a special kind of stupid.
---
If someone is complaining theyre not getting loot fast enough chances are theyre just trying to get as much as they can before they leave and join a more hardcore raiding guild. Lots of people use casual guilds as stepping stones, get the loot they want as fast as possible and join the more hardcore guilds that way they arent waiting months for gear in that guild.
---
It is BIS. It's BIS until a world drop, or a BWL head that casters have prio over.
---
I am a frost mage and have a Freezing Band I haven't equipped because I am indecisive!

Who the fuck cares? They wanna rank up and they're tagging For BGs, nothing against that.
---
How many do you kill her with ?
---
Hehe ok, you guys were a lot sharper than I was, early morning something something.. time to delete :)
---
Post a video of you doing it
---
Honestly you need the people that don't talk in raid or else nothing gets done. 40 voices all wanting to be parts of conversations while getting through content? In my experience that just doesn't work.
---
idk y ur downvoted when ur right
---
&gt;(Mostly for pugs, when people don't listen) 
---
I mean... if you're already having issues with people not listening, wouldn't that make it pretty difficult to have them coordinate to pop a potion all at the same time? :x
---
Ha I got mine in 20 runs, HoJ in 2 runs, the worst one is 38 runs until I saw Dal rend main hand.
---
You are doing something wrong if pre BiS geared rogues and warriors out dps you.
---
Hunter have very good damage in MC. In later phases that changes, but right now it’s one of the best classes for DPS.
---
See this is what kills me.. rogues and warriors will bitch about not having true shot aura so hunters downspec purely to lose dps for them and they wanna challenge u
---
open hand bitch slap

I had the robes pattern drop off that pack too. Always worth killing that nook.

Have you played a game for 16 hours or more in a day and been able to get healthy REM sleep? I've never been able to, especially when getting less than 8 hours of sleep. Teach me your ways? Maybe I need more tendies and dewey? Shots od hunny mussy every hour on the hour like raid consumables?
---
Damn dude 20 mins? Maybe you could afford a nice flash nap, pornhub session or actually cook a meal before you hit your que time.
---
Just because alliance can theoretically pull and kill drek without the warmasters, it doesn't mean that that's the norm. I have only seen this done successfully once, and it was done by a 20 man premade who just told everyone else to stay out. 
---
Usually, it's very chaotic, lots of warmasters get pulled at once, raid gets wiped and we lost because horde recapped frostwolf and relief hut wasn't capped yet.
---
Horde on the other side can cheese their way up in our base, skipping the bridge.
---
I feel satisfied thinking about all the downvotes I received for correctly pointing out that it was just a huge Alliance cope for being destroyed in phase 2.
---
If you aren't going to spend gold on upgrades then what are you? I would not invite a player with that mindset to my groups/raids, as I expect reasonable cleartimes, not garbage 2 hour runs because everyone is too cheap.
---
I had someone tell me that if I equip my enchanted +5 mining gloves (I have 300 mining) then it would give me a higher chance to get more hits out of a rich thorium node, is this true?

terrible meme since BG came out...

Blizzard should activate it for one week during ZG completely unannounced. Not the opening week, not the second week, but some random (to us) week a bit in to ZG.
---
If they did it right at the start or announced it was happening, it would ruin all the fun and surprise.
---
Okay but would you want that every day?
---
It was fun because it was a thing which happened and then was stopped.
---
Blizzard leaving it there because no changes people would be doing it literally every day for trolling. At some point it has to be fixed.
---
alliance just attracts the worst of the worst players
---
Step one. Tell him honestly and plainly what he's doing wrong and to stop. If he does, great. If he doesn't...
---
Step two. G kick. Tell everyone why pre the next raid "I g kicked X because of his shitty loot focused attitude. If anyone has any issues with that, or cares more about loot than the guild, you're welcome to go too." 
---
As a GM it is your responsibility to build and maintain the type of community you want to play in. The standard you walk past is the standard you accept. Good luck.
---
have you tried telling him hes being a little bitch, and needs to shut the fuck up and realise theres 39 other people all working together and hes the only one crying?
---
I think the part that makes it arguably wasteful is that this man clearly spent a ridiculous amount of time achieving this goal that only had meaning to him, and had someone else dedicated that same amount of hours and effort to, say, a charity then that act would have had meaning to many other people as well as him.
---
I agree that meaning is self generated, but that doesn't make a guy pushing buttons for fourteen goes a day heroic. There is still such a thing as wasting time and potential, even if you want to get philosophic about it.
---
👏 GROB 👏 IS 👏 RP 👏 AND 👏 PVP👏

after free transfers fucked us hard, paid transfers almost finished us off, in a few weeks we will be reverse flamelash
---
good for you. repeat the deed you did previously instead of posting gameboy screenshots.
---
I did most of the raids back in vanilla (didn't see last half of Naxx), as both healer and tank.
---
Always preferred 5-mans. Generally found them more mechanically challenging and fun to play.
---
when a warlock decides to use hellfire over rain of fire he is like "If I die, I die" :D

What is the keybind you're trying to use this macro with? For some reason mouseover macros don't really work when you bind them to a (side) button of your mouse. They work when you mouseover their character, but not when you mouseover a unit frame.
---
If you bind that macro to a keyboard button, it should work.
---
We had the same problem with a group of 4/5 player from another guild joining us (big mistake here).
---
They accepted to join at our rules in discord just to start bitching 1 week later trying to remove the dkp system for a loot council.
---
Then tried to convince other to join them, i've heard, in discord, something like "if we're the majority they have to accept out request"
---
Then tried to start a raid 2 within the guild with them as raid leader and loot council.
---
It was a big drama, we had to kick them, and they was all surprised pickachu face.
---
Long story short no one left the guild to follow them and other guildies expressed the relief to see them go for good

is a shorter way to do the same thing

1. I did not in my initial statement. I just said 'yes, blizzard is to blame for the poor design of the pvp system'

2. There is a difference between between a game and a TV show regarding changes
---
3. You started the analogy using TV shows, not me
---
do crossbows use same same arrows like bows ?
---
defending in av is always wrong.
---
You will not be able to change him. If he stays he will drag down guild. Toxic and negative behaviour spread so easily. Tell him: stop being negative and stop complaining. Start controbute to a positive vibe. Tell him: you are ruining the good vibes in the guild with your bad vibes. Tell him: stop this now. One more complaint, one more negative thing spoken and you ate gkicked.
---
Im afraid I believe this is the only way. This or just kick him right away. But explain why ofc.
---
20 to 40 people
---
I don't understand what's happening here.
---
No I listed the so-called hybrid classes. That was what the discussion was about, how some hybrids pay hybrid tax while some(Warrior) does not. Which hybrid class in Classic did I miss?
---
Quick question am I  unlucky or did AV  npc stop dropping anything but white items? No greens, blues or epics anymore?
---
We had one player like that.  
---
I am a warrior class leader and 3rd tank (I run 0-31-20 fury/prot) in priority to take Tank gear (our MT and OT are well gearing now) and he was a rogue. He was shit-talking about how poor geared he was. In that raid, tank gear dropped and officers gave me due I OT when we need. He was bitching because I had more EPGP than him and I could get a better weapon when I am a tank. I chose to craft "Annihilator" to increase physical dps and let other players roll over weapons instead of me.  
---
He asserted he could do more dps with ony neck, t2 pants and other pieces. He has epic weapon, 3-4 MC pieces. He capped weaponskill, hit...Al he needs to be on the top.
---
We try to not show Combat Logs to avoid DPS fights, our guild is a "daddy one". I checked his damage and in various encounters, he did a crap dps. I saw timeline like...In a 1 min combat he was autoattacking half of the time. Other combats are similar. I talked to Rogue Class leaders and officers about that.
---
They talked to him and he left the guild. It seems he was an asshole because he crippled his damage to get loot over other members.
---
Im a hunter looking to improve
---
Nope, you are wrong. I constantly make groups with 58 people, mages that need star and rogues/hunters/warriors that need loot from unforgiven and Timmy. So no, people are not running them ONLY for enchants. And yes you have tanks that need some gear, it’s just that the percentage of them is really low compared to dps.
---
Gratz, we've had leafs three weeks in a row 😥
---
I think horde is doing turtle games because of premade groups
---
First off, it’s never occurred to me to even use my infernal, but you’ve given me a reason to try it out in PvP. 
---
As a lock, I find myself being really helpful in Field of Strife when a teammate is being ganked (usually by a mage or stealth rogue) and I can open up quickly while having the upper hand on said opponent. Usually this allows my teammate to help finish off the kill if I haven’t already. 
---
Ample time to use howl of terror is in any of the boss rooms, where the opponent is recalling and trying to wipe your team’s boss kill. 
---
Personally I feel that I better serve by being a supportive class. I don’t have the gear to win most 1v1s unless I get lucky with crits
---
some realms = one realm
---
Well it’s not me who tried to impress with his sick skillz, all I’m saying is that your vid sucks ;) anyways you seem like a person who can’t really argue so whatever. Be happy with your video and your downvotes and best luck with the game lol
---
Alliance or Horde? Which server?
---
60 shammy here. Resto is slow to level but around 40 is a good time to go ele... 
---
the gear at this level will be the same as good resto gear, will make it easy to heal in dungeons - even off spec - and will freshen things up for you.
---
You don't need resto until 60.
---
Has anyone actually been banned or suspended for ninja looting in classic?
---
Meanwhile when I blink in AV and there a slight bump I don't move at all
---
It happens almost every AV for me, allys are actually adapting and pulling Drek without warmasters now.
---
fucking fun police is at it again, I'm so fed up with this shit
---
I think the lot has been swapped to ffa so no rolls pop up. Just have to be lucky at looting!
---
The epic plate and cloth pants that drop from Lokholar the Ice Lord, are they in game now or will they be releasing with a different phase like Rodrigo’s band?
---
Do you gain more reputation when you win AV? What is the fastest way to get frostwolf clan exalted? Killing a lot or simply winning? Killing npcs? Dragging out the game so it goes for a long time? 
---
Usually how long does it take a person to get to exalted?
---
Haha, that's what I'm talking about. 4 months since the game starts you are just gonna lose ur time going for the pvp grind as you will be always lagging behind and short on gold.
---
So these games vs 40 Russians from the same server that lose horribly are premades?
---
Can confirm I picked up some BoE shoulders with + arcane sp today. Perhaps just unlucky. Not all mobs drop BoEs
---
I know it's ffa now but still since 2 days or so in our grind group there have been 0 drops in chat not even a green
---
Why don't you come up with a list of clearly defined hybrid characteristics for me, and I'll consider taking your argument more seriously once you move past grasping at straws.
---
You clearly haven't had sex
---
1) You won't have maximum honor. You will be outfarmed by players who pvp in the world while in queue
---
2) If you are a serious alliance pvper you have premades whcih grant way more honor per hour than people who don't premade. All horde players get roughly the same honor regardless what they do
---
3) Due to premades existing it is way easier to control brackets, since you can just block people who don't follow from joining the premades and thus lowering their honor per hour. This means ally gets to have bracket stacking which optimizes RP gain, and it also typically lowers the bar for the amount of pvp hours required.
---
Thanks, will do 👍

Yeah and I got a golden and black pearl 😂

---
Well it was 27/28 and I did them solo obviously while watching Netflix, wasn't a pure efficiency day
---
Look up a bis guide. Start going after those pieces from the lowest dungeon up
---
Winning gives you alot of rep. Ignore all the people that say losing fast is better than winning slow, not only is it a fucking pathetic mentality to have in a game you're supposedly playing for fun, it's also wrong. You can get 1.5k+ rep from a long win, more so if people hand in stuff.
---
It was very worth it for me as a broke fury warrior for this reason alone. Don Julios was just a nice bonus. 👌
---
Why does that matter to you?
---
Classic is all about the social experience. While Naxx isn't exactly hard by today's standards, it's difficult enough to where you actually have to pay attention and stay active.
---
IMO at least can do LBRS.  You get a few good pieces of gear there and I started tanking it while in leveling groups at 56ish.  No real reason to do the other ones unless you get all your drops from LBRS already as the XP is pretty good from running lbrs.  At 60 make sure you have also done the random quest chains that give you good feral tanking items and then start tanking the rest.  Honestly UBRS isn't that hard and IMO baron is a harder fight.  DMN/W if killing (tribute is easy) are also challenging and probably harder than UBRS and Baron in UDS (I had much better gear when DM came out so I have a hard time comparing but I breeze through most places but DMNorth can almost kill me).
---
Loved the “wake up b**ch” slap!
---
Gee, got bonner
---
Someone did the math! That's interesting :)
---
The odds are so slightly imbalanced that it is difficult to come up with these numbers purely from numeric simulation
---
As someone who plays a very limited amount of time each week as a warrior, I think it’s gonna be tough to enjoy the content as time goes by but it’s also server and guild dependent. 
---
The biggest problem with spending less time is that the player base in your server would be surging ahead so you may find some trouble finding dungeon groups as you time goes by so that will hamper you. Also, by the time you hit MC, you may not be adequately geared for raid 2 or how ever many raid groups your guild runs. 
---
It will be good if you can put in a bit more time to hit 60 faster for now so you won’t get left very far behind.
---
BiS is great but you should also look up decent items you can get from quests. There are a lot of items that are basically diet BiS from quests that also involve zero RNG, and I wore many of mine for the better part of a month while I was gearing up.
---
sick of seeing this comment as if it was an original or clever thought you just had
---
To get rid of their blues/greens, and get a 100% mount. 
---
Not all of us can solo dungeons for 100 g/hr. 
---
I did AV exalted the first week with a 60%, it is totally doable. If you are so awesomely geared and stacked with gold why didn't you finish with av yet?
---
What's your favorite area to farm mines ?
---
A Mandokir premade wiped and left an AV, they were over half a raid. It was bizarre.
---
Disable Spy in BGs please
---
Cause I'm going for ranks, not exalted.
---
?????? tier 1 and 2 aren't needed to raid heal dude
---
Yep alliance have to try hard for honor with no breaks. We horde get to afk around and have a 15min break between each game.
---
No using 60% mount in AV right now is a terrible thing. It just so happen to be that I'm in a rather unique situation for which it makes sense.
---
When the rankers are done there won't so much be a "wave", it will come over time as people get done, I will slowly climb the bracket ladder.
---
We had a guy who was slacking pretty hard, didn't bother getting pre-bis, didn't bother with consumables, other raiders seemed pretty tired of carrying him and despite several attempts of "Don't you think it's unfair that all these people are putting much more effort into the raid?" his response was always "It's MC, it's easy, there's no reason to try."
---
Well he got demoted to social and suddenly got real busy grinding pre-bis to get his raid spot back. Sometimes people just need a wake-up call.
---
I get you're insecure, so I'll leave you alone.
---
A properly geared and played feral will compete with rogues but it's generally beyond the realm of someone asking this question.
---
Sure you can. Ally on 100% mounts run by,  5 left over slowies get zerged by the horde 20  man defense. It's a big map, plenty of places for you to use numbers.
---
You say long queues and nothing to do and some say long queues give them time to stress less, take breaks and what not. So I can't really figure out how it really is, do horde enjoy or not having queues from your experience? I honestly just can't tell on my own.
---
1. depends on server, but it is certainly more than 2k.
---
2. That is true. But it's not the case right now. And 2 months of there being no brackets causes a lot of tension, it will be a lot harder to form it compared to ally who has had brackets since week 1 on most servers.
---
Three to four weeks to grind the rep? It's been two or three days (mainly night time sessions) to get to 5k/21k. AV rep is extremely easy to gain and has some solid upgrades for high 50's and fresh 60's.
---
You seem upset that you lost an AV match and are looking at gear to blame. It's more so the mindsets and strategies that lose your AV games, and not the gear. 
---
Cheers.
---
Thanks for clarifying your status.
---
What the heck it's like you unlearned the Screenshot profession since last time then.

Feelsbadman
---
And why should everyone else give a shit what you're going for? Stop telling others how to play lol.
---
would love that addon but when I download it I get spammed with errors :(
---
I just started raiding on my resto shaman alt. My main is a druid tank that I have cleared all of MC and Ony with. Tanking is far more enganging especially as MT when you are leading a raid, marking stuff up, telling people what to kill and do. I feel the same as you do with the shaman, I am just following the herd around the instance and spamming healing wave or chain heal. Quite boring. Try a tank, warrior preferably as they are meta and easier to get a tank spot for.
---
Solo tribute runs will always be higher gp/h than anything you can make while mining.
---
  Mining is only good for either jump runs or the random vein encounter in open world. 
---
  I don't have enchanting but I sometimes wish I did (I need LW for the guild). The materials you get from some of the low value blues and greens outvalue their sell price by a fair bit (especially the low value greens if you get greater eternal essences.)
---
I suggest you look for a premade or get one yourself, PUGging WSG is a nightmare.
---
It can work if they know how to kite and how much they can handle, but half of them don't.
---
You can only really premade WSG with people from your server since you can go in as a party/raid. So your best bet is looking for your realm Discord.
---
Yes. Absolutely yes. 
---
You have no use for mining, tribute is by a gigantic leap the best money maker for you, and enchanting is a free way to increase your gold earned and it's by a fair bit. Make sure you get an addon that tells you disenchant value. AUX does this for example. Scan AH for shards, illusion dust and eternal and the addon will tell you how much the item disenchants for. You will find all the greens are definitely worth enchanting.
---
In the time it takes you to farm AV to exalted, you might as well farm the remaining 300g...
---
I mean, they could save quite a bit of gold getting the 640g epic mount. Bought mine for 900 before PvP system was introduced, and it'd be quite anä nice gold saver I imagine.
---
Yes those are bots. There are very many bots. Blizzard unfortunately bans in waves so maybe in Jan or Feb they will get around to doing a ban wave.
---
Your lack of interest its because:
---
1- MC is actually boring no matter what class you play
---
2- You are not the kind of person who enjoy healing. I know right because im one of these people. Made a pally and God knows I cant stay awake for a whole dungeon run.
---
Shelf your shaman until BWL and play some alt. Stay away from casters. Maybe youd love tanking, theres always something to take care of.
---
18 minute queues? Try 25-45.
---
To add to this, grab Sergeant's cape, then solo Plugger in the BRD bar, which you can stealth to as a druid, until you get the Mixologist's Tunic.  After that, LBRS drops great tanking stuff.  UBRS you can go as an OT/dps in cat which helps until you have better gear.  Then Scholo has a bunch of great tanking gear.
---
You can also go as resto and acquire bear gear that way.  Shadowcraft set and Cloudrunner's girdle are pretty much the only items you'll have competition for from other classes.
---
Soloing the troll mini-bosses in ST is also doable and the shoulders that drop from there can be amazing.
---
&gt;The problem with that is, you'd be so far behind in gear, you won't be able to do those raids.
---
That's not how vanilla works.
---
It won't give you extra rewards no, that's a myth.
---
So was that the issue then? Did you try it with a (side) mouse button and that didn't work? Or did you try it with Q and that didn't work? 
---
If you already have it on Q and it still doesn't work on unit frames, then I unfortunately don't know how to fix it.
---
The players in game right now are quite geared and can cover but you will have BiS items in BRD so you should start there. Remember as a tank you pretty much can tank what you want so start with BRD and LBRS and go from there but ppl are so desperate for tanks that they may take anyone
---
You must be fun to raid with.
---
A hunter with half tier and Rhok may outpace some prebis rogues and knock down the best ones barely on non anti melee fights, but once they pick up upgrades, just go for parses.... The numbers do not come close to favouring you.
---
This is true but rich thorium only requires 275 which means 300 mining is enough to guarantee success on mining them.
---
Unpopular opinion, WotlK raiding was the most fun of whole WoW, thanks to hard modes. Such a fantastic design it was. And everyone had to contribute
---
Enhancement is the worst overall spec in the game. Change my mind.
---
Balance and retribution can at least pvp.
---
fuck my ass oh god yeh
---
Actually minimalism is about getting rid of most non important info while keeping the important one in and I am making sure mine does so.. Raid frames lit up players in vicinity, even more lits up players that take damage, informs on aggro, informs on poisons and curses, separately on stuff like mortal strike kind debuffs, blind, viper sting and more.. Info on my+others druid hots and thats basically like all the important info that you want, anything else would be a distraction, tho you wasnt specific on what important information its missing.. The thing about tooltip is that its a distraction on its own, it doesnt hold any important information in pve or pvp situations and it would be more distracting having it floating around so made it static in a pretty common area where most people are used to have it.. I would love if you told me what truly important info is my UI missing tho if you could tell as I am always open to what other people think or do so I might improve.. Thanks for your comment
---
Obviously can't let that happen right.
---
I actually think hunter is tier 1 as far as interesting raid dps (not damage, engagement levels).
---
Managing pet so it doesn't die, managing swing timers, outranging mechanics other dps can't, kiting raid bosses, pulling for the tanks, having one of the few gameplay altering dps CDs (attack speed is fun IMO), having an attack speed proc that can stack with said CD, having more that one button rotation, and yes, using those runes you farmed in felwood. Also being MVP on Ony splits is good for the ego stroking.
---
I'm obviously very biased. I'm so glad we got a second chance to break that huntard stigma, &lt;3 Hunter.
---
They parse better then mage and warlock right now.
---
So might as well bring 1 mage for int.
---
everyone has this gear know, nothing impressive anymore.
---
Which is better done as holy
---
no
---
No make an alt if you only plan to de
---
You can just make a alt, lvl it to 5 and learn enchanting, you can disenchante any item in the game at that point (if your just looking to DE greens/blues)
---
A friend of mine also dropped mining for enchanting to dienchant all the blues he finds during tributes. It upped his gp/h by like 20% or so.
---
Been looking at this guy for 2days now, he doesn't reset..   Made a ticket, but its a 3days waiting time, but do we even have any GM's working at blizzard anymore? Or is it just a AI doing everything..?
---
I make around 70-80g/h with vendoring items and selling the potions on the AH on my realm. 
---
  Maybe you shouldn't get it since you still need to sell all the shards on the AH and essences etc. whereas with vendoring you get a lot of quick raw gold. 
---
  It's honestly up to you for preference I would say, both sides has its ups and downs.
---
Imo, if the raids are boring because it's too easy, you're bringing too many people. A large portion of the current raiding content gets dumbed down because the bosses dies before their most challenging mechanics comes into play (Ony breaths, Raggy submerge, etc).
---
And this is perhaps especially true for the healers, since you're there to counter-act the damage the bosses can inflict on your raid team.
---
HoR is a PvP weapon not a PvE weapon, the guild might want to help build it because they want to work together to help each other, or to have a guild legendary to flex, but it won't matter for actual dps in raid
---
But how to get the items to the alt after a finished run?
---
what was fun about it?
---
But the items are BoP and looted from the tribute chest after a finished run, so how to get them to the alt?
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
I would check what addons are out of date, update those and see if it happens again and disable those that can't.
---
Also run the repair on your classic to check if you're missing anything.
---
World of Warcraft crashes with an Error 132: Fatal Exception! message. Error 132 is a generic error code that may be caused by out-of-date addons, corrupted files, incompatible drivers, or hardware issues. ... Overheating can cause performance issues, game crashes, and full computer lockups
---
Yeah, I just feel that mining does nothing for me at the moment. Even if it's only a small gain, it's still a gain. I don't care that much about having to wait for the gold a bit longer.
---
&gt;	or did anybody say every streamer was evil
---
lul
---
OCE it's horde until you vs a premade but was alliance for the first few days
---
Send any BOE greens you find and vendor the BoP items.
---
It's not a slog for everyone.
---
Just don't play mage or warlock.
---
Unless they've fixed it since last week. We can skip marshals, just requires someone to not be an idiot for two seconds while someone slaps the prospector around.
---
flag_es point_right door
---
So, with AQ? Have fun stockpiling until then
---
Not to mention the 5 afking in base and another 5 spelunking in the mines or the harpy cave.
---
If you're poor, get expert Goldsmith's helm (+7 axes)
---
Better than lionheart of you don't have edgemasters
---
This is extra funny for me as I did the same thing on my alliance alt. The horde were guarding the bridge, so I used the back door, walked right up as they stood around the entrance to van, and took the flag. Then I walked in and dropped consecration on the group before they responded. I also instantly died after. Lol but it was funny.
---
Also a chap did some maths that showed if the queue is over, say 13 minutes long, you may as well fight to win.
---
Given rep gained scales with queue length and honour gain is irrelevant if every active player earns the same rate, may as well focus on rep. Ranking is a bonus until everyone gets exalted and the newness fades away.
---
That's if players will play less bgs when they stop being new, given classic wow has little structured content outside of raids.
---
I’d suggest start with BRD questruns and see how far you get, one of the first bosses (angerforge) can drop amazing pants. The arena has nice loot aswell. It’s also a great place to start getting comfortable tanking. 
---
In the meanwhile make sure you grab craftable gear, like warbear harnass and molten belt/helm. 
---
I suggest checking out talendril’s guides to gearing. He made some really nice spreadsheets that shouldnt be hard to find through google.
---
What about backstab combat spec for dungeons? Been thinking of going dungeons only to 60 for PreBiS
---
&gt; I get you're insecure, so I'll leave you alone.
---
Teach them. We spam raid alerts to make pugs listen.
---
Sure it is. What do you expect to happen when an Ally enters Orgirmmar for example?
---
Thus cant be serious either
---
That's really impressive!
---
Because I can only heal damage that raid takes. 
---
For example my guild usually runs ten healers and I have a 50% parse on pretty much every boss except the last two in mc. This week we ran 7 and I got 95+ on half the bosses. I have no control over this.
---
I have a good position on Ragnaros and have all melee and a couple of range groups in my range and I top healing meters every single run. I dont become a way better player on Rag. Where I am standing is not in my control.
---
This week a lot of fire went on melee so I had a lot to heal. Other weeks I didnt. 
---
My guild does the Shazraah strat where melee all go afk for it and obviously my parses are dogshit and I have no control over that.
---
I play a mage, so I'm usually trying to slow the alliance. How can horde skip the marshals via prospector? Saw one guy try it, but it didn't work.
---
There’s better nagas to farm than the STV naga. Try finding casters as they die much faster. Not gonna blow up my spot but I’ve gotten 3 golden pearls in like 3 hours of farming there
---
Pala, Rogue and Hunter don´t have to do this. So it´s the warlocks and mages again.
---
Raiding in Classic is just a step towards the real game, which is PvP
---
Yeah shards are very low price atm however they will rise in time over the span of classic.
---
But, they are shit. One of these guilds wants to leave because they can’t compete with Grizzly in pvp brackets. If they go to a high pop shitter server they rank easily.
---
Still do. I've gotten just under 300k in two days and lost 5 games. Sucks to be you.
---
Mc and Ony are almost only heal sniping to pad the meters.
---
Imagine everyone with Benediction made a post like this. No one cares.
---
Are you alliance? Im horde and in 7 min ally wins we get about 300 rep. In 15min horde wins about 700. I grinded from the Day after release to tuesday this week and queues went from 5 min to 15min. Because of that the games are longer now with more rep gained from pvp(kill and hand inn of drops from players). When you see 1 rep spammed in chat its hand inns in base
---
I would guess it takes atleast 20h in av + queues which would be probably 10h for EU horde
---
Totally false. People can carry you easily.
---
Thank you for the advice! ❤️
---
From what I remember back in the day it depended on server. However, it might also depends on what version of AV you're talking about. If you're talking about the retail version even more changes have been made to make it more favorable for Alliance.
---
You make it sound so easy, my tank buddy has been running it for weeks and hasn’t even seen it drop
---
what everyone has been saying lately is "hurr durr rush Belinda ignore everything", not "break their rush".
---
I'm just reminding everyone of what you said.
---
When Alliance wins, it takes 10-15 min. When Horde does, it is a 40 min zerg in which you get camped at the gy.
---
Go Incendius, by far the best Ally server. Slightly ally favoured, super bussling but no more than 700 queue, lots of guilds, not **as** hardcore with pvp so you could rank up... maybe.
---
Thanks, looks like you know what you talkin about :)   
---
   
---
As you just said I truly try it to be kinda simple and straight to the point meaning I try to get rid of most unnecessary information and blizz-like art elements as I think it looks a bit more professional this way, not to mention that many people are already fed up with default art including me in those long years, thats why all around UI packs are pretty popular, like ElvUI or TukUI.. I didnt like neither of those tho so I kinda made it myself using separate addons..   
---
Again thank you for your comment
---
Not really. It's great jumping into a queue with a premade for 4-8 hours 3-5 days a week and score a decent standing. Every once in a while you do miss out on a game, so you go take a break. If you end up in an obvious turtle where 30 horde defend at the start, you just go kill them a couple of times for honor then /afk out and take a 15 min break.  
---
It's great.
---
Its Classic, it will work out just fine. Its not hard.
---
Ah, nice to know!
---
As an other kind of statement, I really feel concerned by what you are saying, but at the "lootwhore" position.
---
 I've been playing wow since vanilla in hardcore guilds and I joined back classic to have fun and chill, so I joined a guild half casual, so half optimized. Then after few raids, I started to see the mistakes done inside the guild core, and the loot system was not fair toward more dedicated players over raidloggers, and, as I kept my hardcore min maxing automatism, it started to frustrate me, so I started to point out things, so we could change and improve the equity and fairness of it.
---
Huge mistake I've done, since I became huuuuge debate, and I've finally became the one versus other guild members... My "try to improve things" transformed into "this guy only see purple" and I feel bad about that now, because it's not true. I want to fight for my guild, but if my guild acts as it doesn't fit what I think it should be, then I think I shouldn't have try to change things, but just leave it and search for a more active guild that fits more my expectations.
---
Moral : if you feel concerned by this, you have two choice, first, you accept the system how it is and live with it and go on. Or you just leave the guild being honest with your thoughts and find something else. Don't try to change things, otherwise you'll be targeted as an annoyance and be seen as a perturbator, since you'll be "alone VS the system" and people usually don't like rebels (also a real life statement)
---
Peace. I hope this will enlighten some of you.
---
Some of the "lootwhores" have just been seen like it, but are not really it.
---
Limited Invulnerability Potions are a must as a warlock for that reason
---
Thing is that atm, PvP is AV sadly. And AV is PvE.
---
If he rolls Warrior, he will have lots of troubles reaching 60, but he can farm an awesome tank shield to get his dps gear from 51 by tagging AV, along a mount, an Epic iconic 2H mace and a ring. Blue stuff will probably be very useful to him too. 
---
And if he reaches 60 with all of these he can pretty much PuG raid immediately as arms due to the state of pve and actually deck out himself. 
---
But yes, find a pocket healer on the way. If you don't feel like doing ALL of this and play warrior master race then yes switch your mind. But if you achieve this prepare for awesome lolz.
---
Lolk
---
Skeram really is a pve server huh
---
Well thats wow raiding since forever . Should get more interested with more raids added
---
So tank dungeons then and simply bring casters only.
---
82/18.  They'd be dumb to stick around for that.
---
Its very doable just with a warrior and a healer, best if one is mining the other herbalist. 15min is the time it can take for two players. No l337 DPS needed.
---
You picked the peak time period in WoW history to say “unpopular opinion: this time period was good”?
---
Just remember that site is based on wowlogs so people that never been logged are invisible to that site.
---
Accorsing tonironforge.pro firemaw had 55/45 in favour of horde, which is the most balanced server
---
Pretty sure I have... Not so rare
---
I disabled it the day BGs came out because it's utterly useless in them &gt;.&gt;
---
Winning is massive for rep as it singlehandedly awards you and additional 566 rep. 
---
You get rep for every kill that happens in the AV and for every handin. The easiest handin is blood/crystals as they give you 1 rep per vial and can be done for 200 vials a game for an additional 200 rep for every player. Handing in meat to wing commanders is also great. A single commanders meat is worth 5 rep. I got like 100-150 rep one game just handing in commanders meat.
---
Russians only have 4 servers and are forced to play together, you're probably mistaking them for premades.
---
If you don't care, then don't click on it. This is the equivalent of some in r/golf posting a picture of their first birdie or someone in r/fitness for posting their first weight loss goal. Don't shit on someone for wanting to share their personal achievement. The guy has been waiting fifteen years to get this item. Either be happy for him or ignore it.
---
Imagine your kid getting their first set of straight A's then wanting to share it with others and you responding "there are hundreds of kids in your school getting straight A's, don't talk about it, it's a waste of breath".
---
The people being the most cocky about 'how easy and irrelevant' classic content is are always the same ones bottom dpsing and pulling the raid down
---
I have, they're bad. Mages are naturally melee killers we don't need help against melee classes. We need more stam for survivability and int is good for sustain esp in group fights. Blood of the martyr is better in PVP 150hp and mana. Freezing band is actually a pve ring the frost dmg is more beneficial when all you do is cast frostbolt and no ring had a higher spell power for mages until raiding. in PVP scorch, fireblast and arcane explo/missiles are used a lot and frost spells are often cast at rank one(nova, frostbolt) or are aoe (coc, blizz, nova)so benefit little. The proc is never worth equipping the ring for. It's 1% if a melee is on you you're likely dead. You can't let them hit you more than a few times before freezing them and moving out and kiting anyway so why rely on the proc when you have so many ways of getting out of melee range and avoiding being hit in the first place.  also frost reflector will cause it to backfire anyway and a lot of ppl now have that trinket esp as melee, and a lot of melee also seem to pop faps like crazy against mages in classic so no freezing band is trash. I've tried it before this is my 6th 60 mage from vanilla to 4 private servers and now classic. If they're so great then why don't any of the PVP mages actually use them? Check the rings the mages use in the dueling tournament. check venruki, xaryu and ziqos thoughts on freezing band.

What is this bar called and how do i remove it?

Laughs in manual crowd pummlers
---
A whine cringe?   I’m getting to old to keep up with all the new words these days.
---
Some people just dont want to do the braindead grind to get exalted. I know I would also rush instead of wasting time on turtling.
---
Band of ogre flesh and stone gargoyle cape is massive stamina gains. Nage ring is 50 armor stam and defence. Just stack stamina and your good. I think a pre raid bis hp pool for druids should be 6/7k hp.
---
Stupid af.
---
Alliance doesn't need to stall games. With instant queues you want faster games and it doesn't matter who wins. Horde has 20 minute queues and wants to extend the game at all costs, even if it means having the entire team defending and literally zero people pushing (I've had games where horde controlled aid station for 10+ minutes without a single alliance in base and still couldn't win???).
---
Lol best autocorrect ever, I didn't even notice
---
A guy joined the raid and ninjas some items and you left the guild
---
Guy is a dick but you over reacted
---
As a warlock the chad move is to overaggro and then tank onyxia
---
I mean, can I please call this one a bot? He clearly failed Russian Trolling Subversive Tactics 101
---
If he won the roll, then he should get the item.  I get it’s frustrating, but it is what it is.  Just my opinion though.
---
I left my last girlfriend because of that. Sry 1 time a month is just not enough for me
---
My testing was "scuffed" because I'm not that great at using GM commands on a private server. With proper setup you can easily get 500 DPS and on shorter fights like 25-30s long fights you can easily get 1k+ if you get crits right off the bat. But yea, essentially you rely on faith alone to get good dps with a shaman
---
What's the point of defending endlessly if you don't even try to win though? I'd understand if it was like 25 people def 15 push, but 40/0 makes zero sense.
---
You and the other 1000 dumbasses.
---
You should ask your team to dispell
---
It takes one snowball to fuck it up though.
---
Why is it? Why is it that alliance PvP wise is just a bunch of rookie no brainers? 
---
It has always been that way but I just don’t understand it. Even back in vanilla things weren’t different. I really wanna talk about this.
---
If you’re finding healing boring then you need to pull faster or run with fewer healers. MC is a joke raid you need to find ways to make it more challenging either by speed pulling or stacking DPS, which are basically the same thing.
---
Have you gottten to golden ones back to back before?

It honestly sounds like you were more at the bottom of the totem pole with regards to gear for some reason or another.  It could be performance, it could be attitude, it could be a multitude of things.  And if they brought in a new raider of your same class, that could potentially have been a red flag that he was your replacement going forward.  Either way, your reaction isn't necessarily an overreaction if you had a conversation with officers post raid.  You obviously didn't really have much of a future with that guild if they were treating you like that, but good luck finding a better home!
---
Russians rush Vann all the time. I've had 8 minute losses against them because they seem to skip lieutenants and if alliance goes for a safe strat it has a good chance to not be fast enough.
---
I started av as a hunter at 51 with no mount. Imagine letting some creep on reddit, tell you how to play. Next game im going in naked and fishing all game.
---
look in your addons and disable stuff, my guess is it's SlideBar, comes in a bundle with some auction house addons.
---
You won't get top ranks because there are people doing wpvp during your 15 min break.
---
I don't think you're using Zerg correctly here
---
&gt; But a raid buffed dps warrior can easily pull 400-500 dps in blues without any world buffs or even **half the effort**.
---
Doesn't this go against the most popular reason people wanted to play original wow, didn't most people what to do something challenging?
---
Kick and replace. 
---
Better in the long run.
---
Can you still hop around the outer fence to the flag so no one sees you?
---
Re-uploading this because it got taken down by mods because it wasn't meme sunday
---
As OP wanted the most balanced realm I just assume he has some delusions that marginal differences in pop mattered and just wanted him to have all the info, as in that site is okay but have blind spots.
---
Blame Blizzard for putting in this insanely nerfed version of AV. Players are going to try and play as efficiently as possible. WSG premade were supposed to be more efficient but the WarMasters are so weak and do so little dmg that for a few days, before the Horde reacted to it, we could Just rush drek disregarding everyting and get an easy 7 min win.
---
Don't hâte the players hate the game.
---
Nah. Today we have streaming services. Netflix or whatever on the tv / 2nd computer screen.
---
Ok let‘s not get into your threat strategy.
---
But if you „reck dw when 9h3 starts“ you are doing it wrong.
---
You want to be at 100 rage in def stance. As soon as you know that you won‘t be eating any more fireballs, you DW+HS, BT, HS, sunder/revenge, sunder/revenge, BT.
---
You then have the option to reck quickly and dance back to def stance.
---
Or you know your threat strategy panned out and mighty rage (60s?) and repeat. That‘s 200-250 rage dumped with all actives in the span of 10 seconds. That way you still have shield wall if healers died or can reck for executes.
---
Make sure another warrior has demo up (big). Plus points if sunders don‘t fall off. Even bigger if TC is up, but let‘s give our furies no heart attacks.
---
Literally the same for Horde.
---
You definitely can do them, I remember doing them with pretty crappy gear when I was that level, it just might be hard now because DPS will likely have better gear so it's gonna be real hard to hold threat unless they're patient. But there's probably a steady stream of other people leveling up and needing gear.
---
Personally I'd keep running easier ones like BRD til you get the gear you need from it. There's a bunch of decent bis lists online, but off the top of my head things you really want from BRD are Warstrife Leggings, Mixologists Tunic, the belt quest reward (voshjins strand or something), thralls resolve ring. There's also other good gear that's not bis but still good, like that leather hood and the emperor cape.
---
You also really wanna do DM north tribute to get unyielding maul, it's the most massive upgrade unless you bought warden staff. Lmk if you have any other questions, my mains a druid tank and I'm glad to help out.
---
&gt; You can still be an Enhancement shaman without going full-sweaty, just, you're going to be relegated to swinging Nightfall while totem-twisting.
---
Nope, NF +totem twist is used by top guilds aiming for world first. Anyone else doing it is greatly exaggerating WoW's difficulty.
---
P.S. Not saying you shouldn't wield do it, just saying it's not mandatory and a shaman only path.
---
That’s classic in general. The game honestly sucks. It’s just something to invest with your friends.
---
And they stop playing the moment they have all their gear because what is the point then? We had a holy pala like that. Went all out on dkp with Choker of the Firelord, the Ony cape etc.. took it away from casters because it was .5% stonger than the next best thing and now he doesn´t show up anymore.
---
Well Alliance found a way to turn a PvP BG into a PvE race, and alliance just loves PvE
---
Now Horde forces them to do some PvP and Alliance always sucked at PvP.
---
I AoE farmed with my mage at the spawn point, he spawned regularly there. Are you sure that it's not someone farming him immediatly?
---
simple: minmax
---
ppl who wanna pvp seriously squeeze every bit minmax out of the game by picking horde and then complain why alliance is this bad.
---
Human and Night elf racials are literally non existant in pvp, dwarves are fucking ugly and gnomes don't cover all classes. 
---
Some classes are also sub par when going for pve/pvp. 
---
Human warrior is really good in pve while being the worst race in pvp. +5 sword/mace spec won't help you when you are bleeding / slow poisoned / frost nova'd. Also perception is overrated, in order to use perception you have to know some one is there. Also dismount.
---
Night elf druids have shadowmeld and 1% dodge (wow!) while taurens have stomp and 5% more stamina. 
---
Undeads are literally immune to fear thanks to a 2 min CD and Orc's are secretly overpowered since wow players don't recognize how much the additional 25% CC resist actually is. Everybody is like "oh it's actually big, but it's their racial!" and kinda justify everything with that while Human &amp; NE racials are quite a joke.
---
&gt; I love how with all that considered, a mediocre geared warrior will still do better dps.
---
If the shaman goes full out, he'll surpass a geared warrior.
---
I did all of those on my druid with a party of 55-58s and it was very managable. As long as you dont have to tank orange or red mobs it should be fine.
---
“Dwarves are fucking ugly” LOL YOURE SO RIGHT
---
Tbh, same with hunters multishot
---
Are you a cat druid? Resto druids scale incredibly well with +healing, bear scales very good with armour and stamina and moonkin to some extent also scales well with gear although being bad to begin with.
---
it's what the entire thread is discussing my dude lol
---
Well unfortunately blizz leaves it up to us to find creative ways to gauge populations rather than just explicitly stating values.
---
We can't talk to the NPC because someone already initiated the fight and failed it. *You* were able to redo the fight sequence because you were the single person/group to have it in their quest log. If you didn't abandon it after failing and went on your way, you would've fked the quest for everyone till next reset.
---
&gt; Pretty sure I can tank better just running SL as a warlock, this seems painful, even for 5mans. While I can dig the meme, and I do almost fit into the tryhard group you mention, I find it a bit of a bummer someone making such a big push to make an arguably just... Shite spec work, even enhancement dps is... Laughable, clearly it just plainly doesn't matter in the current tier, nor will it for a while, but man, for someone who's exalted with AV and running enhancement just for the meme, it feels strange, if nothing else.  &gt;   &gt; Though, I do wonder if 2-handers might be superior threat generation, at least for bosses where the damage is usually a bit more managable and the healing a bit more certain.    
---
Shaman tanking is more approachable than warlock tanking in dungeons. Idk who told you otherwise. For raid tanking however there's a weird scenario where warlocks can tank a raid sooner than a shaman (but that's a different discussion).    
---
As matter of fact, 2handers do generate more threat, but you need to be really well geared. But tbh you should never have issues with threat, atm you'll be "over-threating". I'd be purely for dealing dps/nuking the boss.
---
Ha really? They instead could've said in response,
---
"Due to the exceptionally accurate portrayal of the current situation in World of Warcraft Classic, it would be innapropriate to forcibly remove the post in question."
---
:)
---
MC is easy because everyone is trying hard with Bis and consumes. It would be a 4 hour - 2 raid day slack otherwise.
---
Lmao 3-4 paragraphs and this is the only point you choose to pick on
---
[if that was the only problem I'm happy :)](https://i.redd.it/5sc2sk8lb6w11.jpg)

Not really. Haven't been in an AV where we dont go Balinda and LTs first.

Is retail surviving because of subscriptions or the store though? Theres a reason why they release so many pets and mounts.
---
Try playing a Paladin.
---
Max rank Flash of Light the entire fight, nothing else.
---
Gehennas is not 65-35. Based off standings which means how many players who get 15 HK's, it's about 43-57 lol
---
But hunters are going for T1 and T2, and they get Rok'delar. The only gear they're competing for is melee weapons, rings , trinkets and necks.
---
Earthfury ally seems the same. Tanks please transfer here. No heals or dps please.
---
Mankrik seems to have more Ally on it now, does it not?
---
They only won most of the older versions of AV, not this version. Also, Alliance mostly got rekkd in AB/WSG.
---
This is a good intro guide to read for tanking: https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-warrior-guide/
---
It has a section about threat.
---
The only potential store item I could potentially see being ok is tokens, but it would add other problems to the game.
---
Just send the greens to an alt with disenchant. And sell the blues
---
Firemaw is the most populated server in EU and has a 45/55 divide favouring the Horde
---
Incendious is a insane pvp server, I’m in STV as we speak and the beaches always have classes from both factions pvping. Also the server is one of the most balanced servers so going either side is fine.
---
This is kinda my problem with offspec people. You can be a feral and do as much dps as a fury with the right gear and the wrong fury,and you can be a boomkin in healing gear, basicly there are people who dont give a shit about doing their part and want to just leech the loot and there are people trying to make a build work with the right gear and consumables. It comms down to effort in the end.
---
Why are you looking through my posts from like six months ago?
---
Are you in looove? Quit stalking me dude I don’t swing that way.
---
I positioned the pet right behind the wall to force Cho to be in Melee range before he can cast any spells on to my pet. That way it gives me plenty of time to DPS King Gordok before I have to shift my focus to Cho.  
---
Also, once Cho finally need to run back to me, I can fire a couple of viper stings on him to mana drain him faster because his path to me is pretty long.
---
Edgemaster's handguard, great for DPS and tanks.
---
You do MC and Ony in less than an hour? Fucking pro
---
Had a guy who was super dedicated and friendly, but as soon as he didn't get one of the last items he wanted, he showed his true colors.
---
He basicly went on a sexist rampage saying that the girl who got the item only got it because she was a girl, saying we knew her irl (which we dont),  and that she should've been punished loot wise because she missed a raid etc. 
---
All while he'd gotten more items and as one of the first every time. ofc you'll end up in a loot drought if you get nearly everything first. 
---
Retail kiddies doesn't understand that loot is more scarce in classic.
---
Edit: obviously not a part of the guild anymore.
---
I sold my recipe, did'nt feel like waiting the 50 days to make my money on it. I guess your in it for the long haul with 3 of them lol.
---
Times change
---
Dude are you mental? It's easy just fucking read. People who were looking forward to PvP choose Horde at the beginning of classic already. So changing the PvP racials won't change much. But being a PvP enthusiast and also having the good PvP racials on top of that helps you a lot. PvP enthusiast means you enjoy doing and participating in PvP while also trying to improve to be better. This is not true for most of the alliance.
---
Yeah in my experience half the team defends while half kills LTs and Bal, then half the offensive team recalls so we have 30 defending and 10 dying to the alliance that are now spawning at SH until the alliance moves past to the horde defense again. Then the 10 or so offensive ppl might clear to SP gy and cap it and when that happens maybe 5 leave defense to come help and then it takes like 30 minutes for the 15 offensive folk to maybe win
---
Well, actually I figured out myself that I should have left from the beginning instead of try hard into it and still see some problems IMHO. Also, I figured out that some, let's say 5 to 10 other players, agreed with me on some parts of my thoughts, specially the loot system being unfair to some classes and stuff.. So, my words had a real weight, but as you said, some other players were totally fine with that system, and it was basically the "social raiders" who're more into the relations and fun part of the human side of wow, more than the theorycrafting and the maths around how to optimize things. I respect both way to see the game, but I think my personality is more based into the competitive aspect of the game, more than making in game friends. That's where the problem started I think, and the talks around loots and stuff of me being arrogant etc were just an abstract conclusion of this.
---
Anyway. I've taken the decision that I'll stop spreading my thoughts (seen as toxicity from them, that is disappointing but anyway) and leave to an other guild, after a big talk to ensure that I get something that fits me more.
---
This is one of the things i thought they got right with retail.  Healing is so engaging even in BFA.  Classic is kind of meh.
---
Didn't know about the potions but that's a really good idea! Thanks. :)
---
Yup, raiding is pretty boring. I always found the 1-60 leveling part to be much more fun than endgame
---
S A V E     M E    D A U G H T E R
---
Personally I have probably the most luck with patterns imaginable: 3 crusader enchants without hitting drop rate for one, the above patterns, 3 greater nature resist potion, brute force elixir first try, 2 greater frost resist, 3 core armor kit patterns, got my own hide of the wild pattern, and snagged the chromatic resist flask recipe in a greed roll
---
I've had similar issues when I've had wow installed on an external hard drive that was hooked up through USB. It was worse in retail when zoning into zandalar or one of the other new zones.
---
that's not the point of this post at all
---
It is all about fairness. If everyone invests a lot to help the raid, then slackers are detrimental even if they are not needed. I rather raid with 39 people than with 39 and a slacker.
---
The only thing I disagree with is you saying that Perception is overrated. Not because it’s good, but because I have literally never heard anyone compare Perception favorably with other racial actives. It has its uses but it’s pretty clearly one of the worst racials.
---
the best race to gank! =D &lt;3
---
besides gnomes.
---
What server do you play on? Not meaning any offense but reading your comments I'm guessing European realms but if you're horde on Herod you sound like you have the attitude our guild pushes
---
Which is pretty hard. Healing threat is split. And a healer‘s threat coefficient is even lower than that of a ranged dps.
---
If the mage does 1000 damage, the priest would need to eff. Heal for 5205 HP to pull threat. (Mage does 700 threat. That is 700 x 6 x 125% heal needed to pull threat.
---
When mages lose a mob it‘s almost certainly very early and almost certainly due to a resist or two.
---
&gt; Technically true, yes, but you're moving the goalposts to distract from the fact that Shaman DPS is garbage.
---
never said it's optimal. no goalpost moving.
---
I can confirm that our "turtles" are often quite feeble.  It's not very common to see more than 2 or 3 defenders in our base for the initial zerg.  If you're picking people off out of our zerg (we always always always go directly to bal, kill Lt's then push north), then you're going to be facing those same people on D.  
---
If allies would go directly to galv, then push south without picking anybody off and go straight to frostwolf base, you'd probably win every game.  Horde has like 10 NPC's with massive health pools that we have to kill in the stormpike base before we start pulling marshals.  No you don't have to pull them technically, but if you run the wrong way through the base, or if anybody does any AOE at all, they're going to agro and be a problem.  There is nothing like this in frostwolf base, there are no NPC's in the vicinity of our flag that will protect it.  In fact, when we cap stormpike aid station and our flag guards spawn, they are so close to base NPC's that they'll automatically agro and get wiped by them.  Nobody ever talks about that as an advantage for allies, but it always adds a few minutes to our wins.
---
True. Now try to find a pala in a random AV. Players who play a pvp healer paladin are not so much already and even if they are many they are instantly groomed by PvP rankers just for that cause.
---
I didn't get any of it. What's with semi logout? Why aren't horde attacking you when you're on FC? I mean is this all very contextual?
---
Cigar to the right answer.   
---
If they had gone with the 1.05 version, none of this would be happening.   And their fix for the nerfed 1.12 in the vanilla/TBC days was to added the "resources" time out.  It's like they really wanted it to suck.
---
Bad warlock? I’m constantly pushing/topping our mages. Should be 3-4 button on boss fights (curse, tap, maybe corruption if you’re god’s chosen one). I honestly love lock raiding. That said I’m leveling a warrior so I can destroy meters 😀
---
"If we are the majority" lol. This is not how guilds work. After we wiped 5 times on rag I imposed consumable requirements on everyone even though easily 25 people were not liking it all that much. That was until we oneshot every single boss next week.
---
Only the reflector trinkets.
---
No I want to title and defend and wipe every single alliance. The game is only fun in that way. Fuck min/max.
---
I don't have experience trying to solo Anger - but if you've got other rogues in your guild, try to drag them in for quick HoJ runs. 
---
3 rogues and you can get Angerforge down before the reinforcements arrive, so you have time to stealth, don't even have to vanish. With 2 you'd probably would need the vanish.
---
My guild's rogue crew has done this for our fellows. Now we  all have sweet HoJs. If you're feeling generous, after the rogues have them, keep up the stealth runs and HoJ up you warriors too.
---
This is the stupidest fuckin argument I’ve ever heard. I went alliance cuz I knew how many sweaty edge lords would roll horde, and didn’t want to be on the dominant faction. That argument has no weight and you sound about 14 y/o
---
Wallpaper for ya :-)

Horde can get the same owls as alliance, darnassus is wide open to the horde.
---
Horde players outnumber alliance, that is why there is a queue for horde. So alliance players are a limited resource which you are keeping in place for your game. If every horde tries to make every av game a 30 minute match and lets say there is only 80 av alliance players playing during a day that means there is only going to be 48 av games in a day (it's an extreme example but it works out). If horde instead opts for faster games, lets say 10 minute games there is going to be around 140 games in a day. Do you see what I mean? more games for horde, making each individual game less meaningful but giving out more rep for horde players overall
---
What Add-On is that showing the text in the middle of the screen?
---
NA horde changed their meta plus NA ally are trash
---
They're getting longer because Horde turtle every game lol
---
They both are
---
I generally only lose to premades in EU
---
Investing heavily into consumables or farming for minor upgrades from the preraid bis list to clear MC is a waste of time and resources unless you're going for very specific goals, or if your guild is struggling to clear it.
---
Actually, nope.
---
Same. 11k to exalted and 18-20 min queues. REEEEEEEE!!
---
You're aware that you're playing the first raiding content in Vanilla? It's basically the easiest raid content in the game. Wait until aq40/naxx is out if you want a challenge.
---
But the game doesn’t have to be fast for a Zerg to swarm. FTR I agree with you that it’s a turtle, but since Zerg can also mean swarm, both ways make sense
---
Basic hunter pet control question: how do you “mark” a spot that you want your pet to return too? Is it using solely stay? Eg stay pet at desired spot, send it to attack and hit stay again and it returns to that spot? 
---
Example of this is pet pulling boss at end of DM tribute run
---
you probably wont have a lot of fun as a tank... shamans are really really bad at tanking lvl 60 content. you could instead play a warrior, who is well-suited to tank.
---
also, as MC is so boring, you could try to find a guild that does more challenging raids. if you go into MC with another 11 healers and it takes 2h, then this would expectedly be a lot more proing than going into MC with only 7 healers and trying to push for a fast, no-dearh clear in less than 1h (so-called speedruns). 
---
as a Shaman, you can also look into totemtwisting. afaik if you place down windfury for your melees, their weapons will have the WF-enchant for 10sec even if the totem disappears. so you can place WF -&gt; Grace of Air (67 Agi for all your physical dps including hunter) or Tranquil Air (less threat -&gt; more DPS that they can do without overaggro). this limits the amount of time you can heal (as it will use two GCDs every 10sec) but improve the performance of your party members.
---
Or alternatively, Alliance is PvE min max due to having more PvE focused racials like fear ward or speeding up rep grinds (Diplomacy), and stuff like Paladin blessings that simplify raids. This also means that a lot of Alliance players will not spec for PvP, and that they won’t bother with everyone having Engineering for PvP. The Horde is PvP min max due to insane racials like Hardiness (pretty much the best racial in the game against other players) and so you have more PvP oriented players on the Horde side, who are more willing to spec for PvP and have a lot of engineers with special PvP focused weaponry.
---
It did and mage aoe in tbc was pretty worthless until it got a slight buff in wrath.
---
Take this advice, OP. It may feel harsh, but bullet 2 is the main point-- he cares about loot, not you and the guild. He'll jump ship with all his shiny gear you keep letting him have the moment there's an opportunity with a better guild.
---
Not my original design but they did turn out nicely. I just started printing myself as well about three months ago. Can’t think of the brand of filament off the top of my head.
---
Yeah the unfortunate thing is that AV is also the Best Honor per hour so Rank 14 is for the first time à numbers game insted of a mix of skill, serveur rep and time invested
---
Because you can get thousands of honour in a single AV run so chasing one guy is not worth it anymore. You yourself can do whatever you want but you can’t blame others for not willing to waste their time in order to satisfy your bloodlust.
---
Let's ignore the bait as the basis first, World of Warcraft is and always has been, officially and factually: a Massive multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) PvP is only a sub-game mode that is on the same level of importance as questing, dungeons, trade, social etc
---
I opened 286 BMCs in 3 hours of farming and didn't get a single Golden Pearl.
---
What are these ways?
---
The simplest explanation is that there are plenty of good PvPers on Alliance, but a disproportionate percentage of the bad players are there because anyone who just wants to be part of the pretty races or expects the Alliance are the "good guys" will play that faction.
---
Gkick
---
It is true for that exact reason. As a Warlock, until you get enough +hit in your gear, you will do (on average) far less overall DPS on bosses. You also have to waste a GCD every fight on your assigned curse. Mages have better, instant AoE that doesn’t kill you and isn’t a damage type that raid mobs are highly resistant towards (arcane damage). Etc etc.
---
As a mage main with a warlock alt at 60 that I raid with, there is more to it than simply missing +hit gear.
---
I can basically guarantee that your damage on Lucifron, Gehennas, Garr, Majordomo Executus, and nearly all trash is far lower than pretty much any other class.
---
I can assure you that I had multiple times where I had to enter BRD with 5 corpserun. Like Horde groups camped the upper parts and alliance groups camped mc entrance. EPL was a literal warzone where the control switched each hour to different factions.
---
I haven't been in AV where alliance doesn't go Galv first either. It's mostly about whether to rush directly to Drek after that or stop to kill LTs on the way. And if everyone doesn't agree on the same thing then Horde defenders/respawners kill easily the half of alliance players trying to whittle down the LTs near Iceblood, while other half is at Drek wondering why they don't have enough people to do Drek or even hold Hut until it caps.
---
As an alliance player, I think it's safe to say that alliance has the worse looking characters by a wide margin.
---
I am satisfied how Horde plays most get ball+lts and small group of 10 defends galv and base ,after delays and wins .Got around 70-80 % win rate most loses are to alliance premades (how the hell they get 30+ppl  from same server so easy..)
---
The pet does engage first. You can see at 0:29 that the pet is dashing towards Cho. After the engage make sure you go out of range so the pet dissapears and King Gordok is coming for you.
---
Still go the same route : Tauren hunter, beast mastery /mm, lw/engineer
---
why: it just fits my playstyle the most and I like being useful
---
Go with something like warrior, rogue, mage, priest, shaman, warlock, hunter, or druid. Those should suit you.
---
Thanks
---
&gt;   would love to see faction racials totally swapped for a couple months to see what it would do to the meta
---
Nothing because its only a temporary change and people already rolled their mains?
---
"Lvl 26 Warrior LFM for Giant Green lvl 62+ Dragong Fucking Up Orgrimmar, PST"
---
if you want to bear tank you will want to focus on the 2 tank trinkets, they are massive upgrades.  1 is Ench other is a questline.  Enchanting can be dropped after you are done.  
---
Smoking Heart of the mountain (Ench)
---
Mark of Tyranny (quest)
---
Other than that just hit 60 and start doing the 60's dungeons.  Your offspec heal set uses 2/3 cloth items so pay attention to drops you may be passing on a bis.  
---
Good luck!
---
You realize the entire state of the game is anti no changes, yes? There was NEVER a point in Vanilla where we played what we're playing now-- Patch 1.12 with locked raids on a 6 phase schedule, late iteration of AV, no AB yet, etc. It's an amalgamation of what the game was over the course of several years way back then.
---
Paladin for sure. Four months in and I find myself longing to begin completing that sweet Judgement gear--a fantasy I've had since I was in high school.
---
Instead I'm a level 40 undead warrior because some old friends initially rolled Horde then quit the game entirely.
---
I would love to see the original version of AV in classic, but I sincerely believe a majority of wins would take around 30 minutes.  Of course there wouldn't be 6 minute wins, you'd have to burn every tower and wait for graveyards to cap - but wins would still be relatively quick (30ish minutes).  Scores of people were expecting AV games to take much longer upon release in classic, but as soon as the BG opened, it was nothing but zerg wins because players already understood what had to happen to win.  On the flip sides, there would be 4 hour long games too - with a revolving door of people who queue in, see the state of the game, and afk out.
---
lol I just always ignore those shitty inflated ones and scroll away
---
It’s been 11 days since BG released but there are still slowpokes who haven’t hit exalted yet (which would took them several hours in the first days). Now they are so damn annoying
---
Aren’t all PvE servers Alliance dominant? Pagle
---
Just happens to be a landslide. When I run into horde in the wild, I am always surprised since I haven’t seen them in a few days.
---
[MadSeasonShow’s class guide](https://youtu.be/3t-OsvFBiXE) 
---
It took me forever to make up my mind on what class to play, but I kept coming back to this video when questioning about a class.
---
Ohh they "patched" that? Damn.
---
Just pick the one you think looks the coolest, it doesnt have to be more complicated than that
---
The greens aren't boe when you do dmt runs.
---
Yeah I’ve watched that
---
Yes I know... did anyone bother reading the original post I responded to?
---
I grinded av one day for around 7 hours and got maybe 10k rep. Did maybe 2 to 3 hours of av most days since then and still missing like 5k rep for exalted. I don't know how most people see it, but without premades this is actually a long grind to get to exalted, when you consider the more than frequently accuring turtle games that last 30-45 min and grant whopping 300 rep. Definitely not a grind that was done by most of the players in the first two days.
---
Alliance is actually the better faction for premade pvp.
---
Wich requires even more investment beforehand and does not work at all in this fluctuating market.
---
I haven’t found any yet :(
---
What are you parsing? I'd say our mages aren't doing great but a lot of that is a lack of gear, though not for trying.
---
"Priest shits on shamans and druids" why would you write this? Do you think about what you are writing? Does a priest squat and excrement on another class? Why do people even use this expression? What does poop have to do with it? Do you have a poop fetish? What is going on?
---
Hey, we all need more tanks, so if you are fairly geared as resto, just go enhance to tank until bwl comes out.  Might take a little work but you should be able to make a name for yourself as a competent tank and have tons of people asking you to tank runs.
---
Then you dps.
---
Sounds like you like to tank to me, every server needs tanks and you missed your calling
---
So you have to move your mouse? Pfft sounds active to me.
---
Just need about 18 of them to drop. No problem.
---
Gouge doesn’t break a leash. You’re welcome.
---
That's a stupid argument since both enchants will procc more often with SoR.
---
I played esports all my life, WoW is the only mmorpg I ever truly enjoyed, because the PvP feels amazing, mechanics wise, playing with distance / range. I mean depends on your class, but playing druid in pvp is a blast for me. There is so many variables, ways of getting an edge, and different type of opponents you can meet, it's always changing. Unlike raids
---
I agree so hard. The fact that the PVE focused BG gives more honor than the pure PVP BG makes no fucking sense
---
Fix what? Just because you didn't know it was a feature doesn't mean it's a bug
---
Not noticing a single person because there’s someone afk in a spot that makes it look like they’re defending the point that single person takes doesn’t make alliance bad at PvP
---
Can you kill drek with LTs up in vanilla AV?
---
We want the old game where you can do shit like this. It’s a lot more fun when things are unexpected out in the world.
---
I'm on the same page. I'd rather do world PvP / bg, with lesser gear, but have challenging and fun nights than spend all week farming for raids
---
It terms of "absolute best" Cassandra is better.  
---
But right now you don't need to be absolute best, and T1 part have more int/stam/spirit/Fire resistance. All of this are useful utility stats.  
---
Also T1 5 pieces bonus is very nice.
---
I don't say you're wrong (since it seemed to fix your problem) but normally 'help' and 'nodead' modifiers include 'exists', right?
---
What do you mean it does not work?
---
You buy the crystal + thorium bar. Make arcanite bar. Spam trade chat "wts arcanite cd 5g". You trade the bar for crystal, Thorium bar and 5g.
---
Warrior, druid, shaman, paladin so you can tank while leveling. There is a shortage of pre end game tanks. Of course you'll have to be a babysitter if your tank so be prepared.
---
Before the gkick, I want to suggest the parsing approach. His attitude won’t go from night to day in a flash but it’ll happen over 2-3 raids. Add to that some harsh words about not focusing on gear because you have 39 other players to gear, and he might stop. If it doesn’t work, then gkick. Also if he’s not full pre-bis, that’s a problem and he shouldn’t be complaining when there is easy room for improvement.
---
Here’s how it goes. Hopefully your raid logs their fights. When he complains, link him the rankings for the fights, and if he isn’t getting at least 95 percentile parses, there’s room for improvement. If he says he’d get a higher ranking if he had more gear, kindly point him to the %ilvl section where the rank is based on your ilvl compared to other people of the same ilvl, as opposed to compairing him to every other [his spec and his class].  
---
I’m personally the kind of player that would never sit on a loot council because I would give myself all the gear. Focusing on rankings and doing fights correctly is the only thing that gives people the impression that “I don’t care about gear”. The in-game per-fight meter doesn’t mean anything. 
---
Show him this reply if you need to, all he needs is a shift of mindset. As i’ve said above though, if things don’t change, gkick.
---
Never not fish in AV
---
K
---
you mark the spot with stay, then set your pet to return with passive.
---
What's he going to be like when t2 or t3 gear comes out if he's like this with MC on farm.
---
this is the level of intelligence i'd expect of someone with a twitch meme reddit username
---
the thing that bothers me is that there are people who exploit such a quibble and then cancel their auctions once they see that they are about to expire.
---
Do you want to exploit the vanilla AH UI? allright, then face the consequences of it and know that all your listed auctions can't be cancelled anymore if there's already a bid on them:
---
http://prntscr.com/qeaog4
---
It's actually pretty commonly expressed by horde players trying to deny that they have superior PvP racials. I've read at least 30 different posts insisting that perception puts humans on a tier near orcs/undead/tauren. I don't get it and agree that it's absurd but it is also fair of the guy to call it overrated.
---
I don't get it either.
---
The solution is to mass bid on all of them.  They can cancel each order but that takes a ton of time.  Nothing like forcing them to cancel then relist a hundred silk cloth.
---
This is the limiting factor for low bid prices.  If someone wants to low roll the bid, they risk it being bought for dirt cheap.
---
I mean, it doesn't matter at the end of the day. Any Paladin is going to wear the T2 helm instead of the T1 helm if they have it.
---
My point was that it's not a direct upgrade for them. And it's not.
---
Sounds like you need to take a look a Warcraft logs to see how you’re doing compared to healers in your raid and on your server.
---
End game warlock looks so fun, I just don’t know if I have the heart to level an additional character on top of my rogue and druid.
---
Plus it's so rewarding compared to just spam one key for 3 hours.
---
I can distinctly remember some PvP 1v2s I had in Vanilla, I can absolutely not remember anything about my raids, except when I lost rolls ahah.
---
But man the joy of beating a guy higher level / better gear than you in wild pvp, I dont know to me that's the best part of the game by a lot. But cool if people enjoy PvE, good for them, it just surprises me our experience is so different
---
Yea lots of guilds do. We’re only ranked 8th in speed on our realm/faction.
---
It was fixed in 24 hours I think, wasn’t it?
---
Only place really targeted was org and if auction house so I just avoided it.
---
It’s a pretty bad attitude to have.  You realize pretty early on in your guild how it is composed beyond just loot system and raid nights.
---
He should be in a more hardcore-ish guild if he wants to see loot prioritized like that.  But he isn’t in a guild like that because he would be a middle of the pack dps because the other dps are just better.  Big fish in a little pond type thing.  
---
On a side note, I think one of my biggest pet peeves in raiding has now become the general lack of caring about performance in raid.  Not in the sense of min max comp or spec, but just a general lack of effort and/or knowledge of your spec.  Guild raiders masquerading behind the casual mantra, thinking just showing up for a raid is enough and they should get loot because they read a list and it was on there.
---
That is not a typical marriage lol that a hollow life of two people lying to themselves.
---
For rep not honor though.
---
AV grind rewards a player for the amount they play. 
---
Warfronts are weekly login traps that reward gear with pure RNG. The gear u get can be pure shit every week, or it can be a titanforged weapon with a gemsocket, that beats mythic raid weapons. 
---
This makes warfronts way more unfair. You can essentially win your R14 equivalent weapon from the first 20minutes of AFKing. 
---
In AV u have to be the realm's most devoted AV player for months to get the weapons. Even for the armors you have to play a shit load. 
---
R12-14 gear in classic is still a status symbol of neckbeards in the same way that maxed out skills and their capes are in RuneScape.
---
Warfront gear is not. It represents lootbox type RNG rewards.
---
Is it scary to tank?
---
mods are gai
---
If you have chunks of playtime leveling is faster in a dungeon even if not doing some min/max type thing.  BRD and LBRS both have a lot of quests and can be done before 60.  57ish is a pretty sweet spot as a warrior for just spamming lbrs runs and getting 60 pretty quick.
---
I mean it isn't worth the same for someone that can use it and someone that will just sell it. BoE item + the gold you save from having to buy it &gt; just the gold you get from selling it.
---
I’m pretty sure you can solo dm e jump runs. A hunter in my guild was telling me he could.
---
“dwarves are fucking ugly”
---
Say sike right now
---
This perfectly shows one of the advantages that Horde have over Alliance in AV (not saying Horde overall has an advantage).
---
The graveyard flag is quite a bit off from the location where the main fight of the commanders is happening. You need to have a player solely defending the flag (should be a paladin / mage though to be able to break sap). 
---
On the other side the healers / ranged are on top of the flag when Horde is pulling marshals so 1 player caps are not an option.
---
There is a automation section under the np settings. Works fine for me and everything is set to no automation.
---
In vanilla winning as horde was fairly rare. You pretty much required the ice Lord or as we called him "The Turtle Smasher"
---
Please deliver us from the day, on either side, when someone isn't complaining about a turtle.
---
They are definitely worth it if you are good. 
---
If you aren't going to do satyrs then you should honestly just do ZF
---
The people at top are also getting 10-18k honor an hour.
---
Its not to late for you to reroll
---
It's people being AFK is what it is.
---
My Druid alt is just starting the lvl 50 to 60 grind. I leveled feral and have had zero issues healing dungeons with the healing set. Is this gonna still be viable as I approach the big boy dungeons like BRD and beyond? I'd love to run around lvling up,questing as a cat then jump into a dungeon to heal. Anyone think it's viable?
---
it is a fucking bug, cross realm whispers never existed in vanilla
---
Okay, let me get this straight.
---
Situation 1:  
---
You press Q while in Cat Form, with no target. It cancels Cat Form and casts Regrowth on yourself.
---
Situation 2:  
---
You press Q while in Cat Form, with a hostile target. It cancels Cat Form and casts Regrowth on yourself.
---
Situation 3:  
---
You press Q while in Cat Form, with a friendly target. It cancels Cat Form and casts Regrowth on that target.
---
Situation 4:  
---
You press Q while in Cat Form, while mousing over the character model of a friendly player. It cancels Cat Form and casts Regrowth on that player.
---
Situation 5:  
---
You press Q while in Cat Form, while mousing over the unit frame of a player. It cancels Cat Form and casts Regrowth on that player.
---
All these situations work, except for the 5th one, right? If I understand you correctly, the 5th one doesn't even cancel Cat Form? What about this next one? Does that one work?
---
Situation 6:  
---
You press Q while in *humanoid* form, while mousing over the unit frame of a player. It casts Regrowth on that player.
---
Lol how are you going to use a 95% median on a parse to critique someone when there are factors beyond his control?  Literally, one of the worst barometers to tell someone they should git gud at their class.  
---
Too many factors beyond a persons control go into a parse, regardless of trying to use an ilvl filter.
---
I dunno it essentially increases damage by around 12-15% of a mage if I'm not wrong. So if the boomkin doesnt manage to get at least 75% of the dps a mage does they are not worth it.
---
I thought this wasn’t possible cuz of no path available and shit?
---
It was fully possible for a handful of Horde players to keep an R14 geared Ally premade out of Frostwolf for hours, especially once the troops got upgraded to champion, and then watch them all rage quit in frustration.   
---
It's one of the greatest AVs ever.
---
Because for the past few years, there has been an exodus from alliance to horde in retail for the purposes of high level raiding.
---
Which means that pvp will also end up going the same way, which means that people who are horde on retail will most likely want to stay horde on classic, even with alliance being objectively better for both pvp and pve.
---
Easier said than done.  Snowballs only last 5 minutes, and it's nearly impossible to get in the room after alliance stack 20 people on the ramp, so more often than not the snowballs despawn.  After that, you grab another pile, then you die before you can get in position to use it.
---
I'm not one of these people, but it's pretty obvious if you're a fresh 60 you can kill multiple birds with one stone going straight to AV. Discounted mount, rare and epic rep gear, not to mention ranking up in pvp for further discounts and rare gear.
---
Don’t knock Horde jams
---
AFKing by the flag is even worse than just regular afk. I’m sure there were some competent allies there were like “Oh a well geared night elf hunter is guarding the flag. I’ll focus on trying to clear Horde out of Drek and come help her if I see her get attacked.” Actually pisses me off
---
Yeah you kick the whiny cunt from your group, tell him exactly why, and get a new guy. 
---
Ezpz
---
Relatively new to Classic so sorry if this is a dumb question. I’m an Alliance rogue at the point where I’d like to start running SM, but it’s in Horde territory. How do I 1) get a group for it? And 2) get there?
---
Thanks!
---
I was around back in those days. Hard to capture that moment in a bottle. What changed?
---
Little kids and boomers play alliance while Chad gamers play horde. /s
---
Number of pvp to pve servers.
---
You would think, but the impossible just got possibled
---
Imagine having such a clear and well documented [advantage](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zbpgWkPbNc4) in AV and still collectively sucking so bad that you never win despite the ridiculous advantages
---
Not to sound dramatic, but I would have never played. I would have done my best to resist the urge to come back.
---
The answer is to get drunk in discord with your buddies - won't matter what you're pressing in game
---
56 Tauren warrior with Gatorbite axe here. Is it worth it to get Ice Barbed Spear and respec + level weapon skill at this point? I will need to go fury or prot at 60 anyways and my current respec cost is 10g.
---
Not in the context of classic AV.
---
Anyone going for honor as alliance in pubs isnt going to hit rank 10 and should give up now. It's laughably sad how deluded these people are that they're actually going to get any form of reward from that grind. Get rep get out of AV. The sad people still wanting honor can stick to premade
---
2 times ive looted 2 pearls
---
That’s how we achieve how epic gamer moves
---
 Horde arent getting anywhere near 18k honor per hour.
---
Well to be fair, it can easily be read both ways since the last part of the sentence mentions another content unlock with an estimated time. I, too, read that regarding the last part of the sentence and not the first part.  
---
But you're probably right.
---
Spot on, the only scenario in which it doesn’t work is if I’m in a form and try to mouseover a unit frame. Basically want to be able to quickly throw a heal or innervate when I’m tanking or DPSing with a single button press.
---
I know some horde rogues on thunderfury pushing 15k an hour.
---
Also looking for a spot as a healer, 100% mount, full pvp geared (5 t1, 2 t2) - disc priest and like to Pi mages or warlocks ;)
---
Can I get a PM from someone whos connected here?
---
Yoooooooooooooooo
---
It would be a bit fun, but it should work? If you put everyone on follow except the leader and then start running and in the running moment pick follow on the last dude, it should work. No? This is probably one of the more interesting things I've encountered so far in classic.
---
This definitely happens on both factions. I dare say if we were able to see official stats, we’d find that both factions are rather evenly matched across all realms combined.
---
Alliance have so many AFK people it is weird we even win games :P
---
THIS!!! Always has to be toxic assholes. Sucks
---

---
I'd flame you for making the same post a week ago, but I've done the same thing poking fun at all the AV crybabies.  
---
You're not entitled to be bailed out by members of your "team" every time you're in a PvP altercation.  People play on PvP servers for reasons other than to engage in world PvP on every possible opportunity.  You're expecting everyone who made the same faction choice as you to be bros, and they're clearly not.  The sooner you come to terms with this and move on, the sooner you can move on with your life.
---
If I don’t pull my weight in a raid I honestly won’t even roll on gear. It just feels like I don’t deserve it or I got carried.
---
1) Guild, Trade, LookingForGroup and World chat. Also general chat in common 30-40 areas such as hillsbrad foothills/arathi highlands. Or even the general chat in scarlet monastery, if you're willing to stand around there until you get a group. 
---
2) Start in southshore. Go up northwest between dalaran and ruins of alterac. Swim north across the lake, when you see a castle go to the left side of it. Once in tirisfal glades, you can follow the road signs to the monastery. Be careful of the horde guards.
---
To use perception you have know that somebody is at the place you are at or just guess it.   
---
This can happen because you saw them or it's a point of interest e.g. like the towers in AV.   
---
But even then it's meh tier since it makes a sound on use and you get a buff on you. Smart players will just wait out the timer. Also the range is so small it doesn't guarantee you the opener.
---
Trust me, it is more help to not play so it ends faster so you can queue again. It sucks but this is how it is.
---
Fuck WSG.   That shit is such a chore.
---
I dont know man. This is my experience too.
---
Should be using frost shocks in raids regardless, I don't even use it 5man unless I'm comfortable taking some hits from whatever I'm shocking.  Maybe 90dps was an exaggeration, but I won't fault a guild that doesn't want to carry an ehancement shaman, you only get 40 raid spots and if you have enough members that you have the luxury of filling every one of them + a bench then yeah the meme specs go on the bench.
---
The trick is to never let him get the last few epics.
---
&gt; Need is need. Greed is greed.
---
Until the last person rolls need anyway and then proceeds to sell it on the AH...
---
Some pieces of r10 gear are BiS for quite a while for fury warriors. I'm very tempted but can't stand to do more AV. I hit exalted last weekend and haven't touched it since.
---
TIL every alliance player has a pocket paladin (or is a paladin).
---
Thanks for the input, afaik whenever a bid is placed the time on the auction is extended. Any idea if this is true?
---
IF the quest npcs are alive (they usually aren't) and IF everyone loots corpses (they usually cant) and IF everyone teleports back to turn in (they don't) then it's better rep to stay in a long game. Which is to say, it's worse rep to stay in a long game.
---
GRID2 shows incoming heals just fine for me
---
Why nerf avs honor when we could just buff warsong? That would be better for everyone.
---
If your mages are doing 800+on luci they are top 300 in world..
---
Top 500 for 800dps+ on sulfuron. 
---
Those type of parses require major gear..
---
Stop with the faction bias. People in general are a certain way not the factions. If you really want to talk, let’s talk about why you think certain factions have certain behaviours and why you believe it’s not a person issue but a faction one. Your comment is full of crap.
---
Untrue. I am pretty certain about that. It has a fixed end time.
---
I am talking about queues and I am already winning.
---
they are saying it is dead because they are scared people will transfer to the server
---
Guess healers will only be healing themselves from now on
---
i legit spent the rest of my week after raiding watching videos of ppl raiding naxx/aq/bwl;
---
But give stats on the number of people who do that. I’d wager that it’s ultimately less than 0.1% of the population.
---
Whoops yeah I see that now, misread a bit of it. Yeah if you need something in the dungeon expecting payment is shitty
---
No, dude, no. Not "know".
---
I've been saying 3rd week January. (The 21st)
---
LMAO... too fucking real.
---
I think your concept of "team" is being conflated with your faction.  Just because people chose the same faction as you does not compel them to be the defenders of everyone who also chose that faction.  Your faction is not your team.  Your guild is your team, and the group you're in is your team.
---
"Any time I had a problem, I threw a Molotov cocktail and, boom, I had a different problem."
---
Yes I agree, but I was replying to a guy that said afking and botting was not rewarding back in classic. But... it was. You could easily rank up with it and was definitely a thing back then too.
---
Not to hit rank 14, yes.
---
But there are only 2 raids out. Wait and see.
---
Yes, it is scary.  The raid depends on you and you depend on the healers.  Sometimes your health get low real fast you have a fraction of second to pop a cooldown or potion.  It's stressful, but very rewarding when it all works.
---
We had a 45 minute AV yesterday where we summoned and turned in every thing possible. Got around 1800 rep. That is much better than the 150-200 you get from losing fast. 
---
I was keeping track of win vs loss rep and it's about 200-300 per loss and around 800-1500 for a win. With the 15-20 minute queue times you want to win games, not lose.
---
Yeah I think my wording was pretty messy there.
---
I meant to say my example was a guy being pretty relaxed with raiding, which isn't bad in itself, but compared to the raiders he's with it becomes a problem, and similarly you have a guy who wants loot, which again isn't bad in itself, but compared to everyone else and how much he wants it becomes a problem.
---
Both people need a reality check. The raider in our guild got one and started improving immediately, but we were ready to replace him if that wasn't the case. I feel like your situation is similar. Either he needs to adjust his attitude to fit the guild, or he needs to find another guild that fits his attitude.
---
It took me 30 hours played to do it.  That includes queue times.
---
I remember doing AV during tbc as alliance on sylvanas eu queue tones 2mins and alliance just rolling to wins maybe 90%of the time, not sure what’s changed and why horde seem to have the edge now
---
He deleted his comment and user. 'Nuff said.
---
It looked to have an update
---
Wing BUFFET. These words hold true. 
---
 You are going to DPS very slowly! Now! And by slowly I mean Fucking slow!
---
Cool man, it’s also a pussy ass move.  Par for the course I guess
---
Here is a [madseasonshow video](https://youtu.be/wnZQzO9h-ek?t=550) that confirms what I am saying.  I think you are mixing this up with the [orc racial](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=20572/blood-fury). 
---
&gt;Blood Fury  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Increases **base** melee attack power by 25% for 15 sec and reduces healing effects on you by 50% for 25 sec.
---
Nice ony run last night my guy.
---
 /wave
---
Many actually did. I did and so did half the mages in my guild.
---
But some had better frost gear, with Ringos Blizzarding Boots etc providing them better dmg as frost until they could change their gear stats a bit. Molten Core and BWL at this point we could just arcane missile spam anyways because we far outgeared it. I dont think anyone bothered to respec frost for MC and BWL post AQ launch.
---
The main reason for going fire was the rolling ignite - you needed a minimum amount of mages to keep it rolling. The single target dps per mage without rolling compared to a mage slinging 1200 dmg non crit frostbolts wasnt that big, from memory.
---
Loot whores don't care about the guild. They just want loot. 
---
Everyone is replaceable, this player is no one special.
---
Simple /gkick
---
Interesting choice, but I'm not sure how well you pace your damage output because casting resets your melee swing time. 6% crit to lightning spells is nice, but I think the main bulk of damage should stand in the tripple Windfury crits so you wanna auto attack all the time
---
One good paladin can easily service 5-10 people, there's a reason why every good ally premade in wpvp and wsg had at least one.
---
I think Tauren female is even MORE rare
---
Hoes mad LUL
---
Why the fuck would they change it to FFA?
---
No one hates on rep, it’s just that getting exalted in AV takes half a week at R10 pace so when someone joins and is like “hey let’s rush drek I want rep” it basically signals “I’m fresh to AV, cater to mee”
---
And you are completely wrong about the honor system not giving good rewards before r11 the blue set is on par or above epics for most classes
---
If you drink hot jell-o (blue and red) from mugs (like me) now you can look forward to spilling some (pls send updates).
---
You know seeing you complain like this is exactly what they want, right?
---
What are the names of the belt and the boots you are wearing? They fit really well with the tuxedo clothes.
---
Is it always changing? Every guy from a certain class that i've met does exactly the same or tries, with HP bars so low, it doesn't really matter, stunlocks are the best example of no counterplay, rotation based PVP. I barely consider this game a PVP game even, what matters the most is gear, its incredible unbalanced with certain classes simply not being able to beat other classes, you have no Matchmaking or ladder system, 3 BGs and one of them is PVE, no dual spec and you have to decide what trinket you'll be using 30 seconds before the fight even started, its cool if you enjoy it but if what you want is PVP then aren't you better off playing another game?
---
Enjoy your Christmas and New Years vacation. See you in BWL.
---
Everything here was a big fat drama, until they "left".
---
In the end everybody got some loot and 90% of people seems happy
---
I left a group for this reason. I wasn't lying though...
---
Mograine has a lot of English speaking alliance
---
Father Winter, of course
---
Well hey, your realm might not be asshat infested!
---
A raid of 60s in prebis and some knowledge will rinse ZG and AQ 20 you’ve no idea what you’re talking about
---
I've looted one green and seen another green picked up last night from someone else. It won't be as obvious due to it only being seen in the chat box now so you're probably just missing it or not near enough to the people looting to get the message.
---
Having farmed a lot of clams.  I have had more than a couple doubles.
---
People changing it master loot
---
Agreed, bears have more HP/armor than warriors but less raw avoidance based on not having block or parry.  What this practically means is that bears tend to take more spiky damage occasionally due to an unlucky string of crits or crushing blows, but usually a steadier, lower rate of damage. 
---
Bears are also easier to gear up, armor-wise, then warriors.  Unyielding maul, thrall's resolve, mark of tyranny, or Smoking Heart all add significant armor (almost 1000 armor each!) to the bears total armor.  One is crafted, two are quest rewards, and one is about a 20% chance drop of off a relatively common 5-man dungeon run (DM North-tribute).
---
Of course my damage is far below that of rogues and warriors, because they basically the rest if they are well geared and optimized. Compared to mages it's just a shitty rng fest based on lack of hit yeah.
---
This guild is so epic that I don’t even know who they are but they still somehow harvested enough yummy delicious tears to share with me. They give back to the community more than the Salvation Army.
---
I didn’t know that casting resets the swing timer. 
---
Perhaps you can replace the lighting bolt with low ranks of earth shock (for the interrupt) to fish for elemental focus. The rest of the rotation stays the same. So you still get lots of 0 mana frost shocks, and elemental devastation by doing this build. 
---
Compared to a full enhancement build that’ll get improved Windfury, I still think this’ll have higher dps.
---
Uh, why wouldn't they compete for the world boss?
---
I was just questing on my lock in Arathi last night (Incendius) and saw the courier.
---
The slap
---
Its still faulty. The true thought experiment is to completely wipe the servers or make new ones, and remove the racials, remove the leveling/zone superiority the Horde has and then see what happens.
---
I have that dilemma for my Maraudon runs (I’m not good to do Tribute runs). Would enchanting be good to DE my greens and blues that are only worth a bit more/less than a gold? Or is mining mithril better?
---
My guild on herod is recruiting a rogue atm. Let me know if you’re interested at all, can tell you more.
---
It’s usually that “good good” unemployed life.
---
Looted a green 1h ago so I can confirm. So I was just unlucky the last days
---
Idk about other guilds but our mages stayed frost during aq40 because we were still actively doing Mc, bwl, and ony. They did eventually switch but we were really hardcore tryharding and deep into aq then.
---
Nail on the head, well put and good memory on you!
---
I recall almost ALL of my vanilla guild mages going fire after getting to a certain threshold prior to AQ.
---
Anyway had that one random arcane mage tho...
---
I wouldn't drop mining tbh. Just make an alt, get lvl5 on it then take enchanting. Same result without any sacrifice.
---
You are wrong.
---
Started as a dwarf rogue on release, slowly all my friends stopped playing, just about got to 40 before I stopped just before p2. Resubbed last week to find out flamelash is absolutely ruined. So I'm restarting as a Human paladin. I would've rolled horde but I've always been drawn toward paladins, and I guess over the many years of playing I've just been more of an ally guy
---
I actually agree with you, but I'll answer your (possibly rhetorical) question.   
---
A lot of people won't loot, as only the honor is relevant to them.   
---
As someone who loses probably 9/10 matches, loot turn-ins are currently my only reliable shot at creeping the rest of the way to exalted.   
---
If I was locked out of looting corpses that I wasn't awarded the kill for, I'd just become one of the AV fishermen, waiting 45 minutes for my 1 mark.
---
Even on private servers we never really stopped doing MC and especially BWL. Our mages just stayed fire spec and used gimped frostbolts in those raids. Was that not a possibility back then? I didn't start raiding until Wrath so I really have no idea how it was like back in vanilla.
---
This doesn't work if equipslot 16 is currently mainhand only.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Really? Honor gear royally sucks for locks
---
Legs are also BiS in BWL for Horde. And shoulders are BiS for both factions throughout BWL. Both combined are BiS for both factions (excluding r13 gear since its unobtainable for the majority).
---
Glad I’m in the private premade server and don’t have to start every game with a 2 minute debate
---
Sweet! I appreciate the advice!
---
Yea he wanted engineering
---
&gt;But I do appreciate the scathing condescension, very level headed.
---
I assumed that's the type of conversation you wanted since you started it.
---
&gt;This will come as a shock to you but every class is capable of performing at least two roles
---
What other roles can mage, rogue, hunter and warlock perform? "Tank" with pets/dodge stacking? "Heal" with bandages and engineering?  
---
Druids can fill 3 separate roles as already established, and in effect they're the only true hybrid. Paladin cannot unless you wanna be dead weight, for a paladin to be able to tank you gotta salv everyone and then still hope they keep dps low enough to not snatch aggro. A shaman tank won't do well unless they're in a sub 60 dungeon with good gear. 
---
A paladin won't provide any dependable amount of damage ever, and even if they go ret they'll be more valuable for cleanse, buffs, and their aura rather than their actual damage. The damage is basically not even part of the equation when considering to bring a paladin when you're 45+, therefore that "role" will never be filled by a paladin in classic wow. 1/3 gone. Tanking on the fly? You must be joking. Druids can do that, but absolutely not paladins or shamans.
---
&gt;I'm a resto shaman, and raiding is just so *boring*.  90% of it is just spamming chain heal. I'm active and engaged, follow  instructions, and play my part well, so I get a lot of requests to keep  raiding and join guilds, but it's just a massive slog every time.
---
Honestly. What the fuck did you expect? - Literally everybody and their mother have preached healing and raiding in general, is pretty damn straightforward. No hate. I just don't see how anybody gets to 60 and starts raiding at this point, without having heard or checked how life at 60 is like.
---
Im not on core raid team but ive basically been told if gear drops that our other 3 dont need then they will summon me in as long as im online
---
You can let ally have their quick wins as horde too, it's an actual strategy
---
I haven’t been able to get Grid to work. I switched to Grid2. It took some getting used to, it’s a bit trickier to set up. Once you get familiar with all it’s options it’s way better than Grid.
---
Herbalist here. Are there any herbs / potions that will increase in value and price with the incoming release of BWL in 2020?
---
i think addons can only cause lua errors, try to go to the windows search bar and type in memory diagnostic and click on the first thing
---
This actually happens so often it’s infuriating. Alliance rage leave as soon as the brainless rush tactic falls through, night elves afk at the flags and stand idly by as we get stomped defending it. Then they complain why loss rate has increased
---
Very true!
---
Looks like the spirit of classic to me.
---
I haven't equipped a crossbow yet with my hunter. The +5 to bows just makes life so much easier. I got the bone bow on the same run I dinged 60, and used it until I got Stryker's Mark (in a PUG where they let all the hunters roll, so no flaming). It is so much easier to gear, and I have so many more options than any of the other hunters in my guild (aside from the ones with Rhok already). It allows me to wear +agility or +AP on everything without really worrying about hitting 9% hit while everyone else gimps themselves with stuff like Mask of the Unforgiven and True Aim Gauntlets. I don't have ONE piece of tier gear yet, but I out-dps hunters with almost full sets. With a bow, the AV ring, the DMN ring, and the DMW boots, (all easy to get) you only need to find 3% more hit!
---
Macro putting pet on passive with FD.
---
Works 100% of the time for me.
---
Both enh sham and ret pally are a joke. Shaman gets kited unless youre lucky, thats why enh is the meme spec. Ret has no offensive buttons to push and youre basically a warrior with no way to catch anyone, dont have a slow and dont have MS, which is huge.  
---
So your only choice really comes down to rogue or warrior. Theres 2 big problems here. First of all, both are heavily dependant on weapons, but warrior more so. If your weapon is trash, you simply feel useless. The second problem is you are going to run into so many mages, itll make your head spin and mage hard counters the fuck out of warrior. Its *easily* a 0-10 matchup as a warrior and any good mage will beat you without breaking a sweat.   
---
For rogue its different. As you get better, you can deal with mages and pretty much every class for that matter, as long as youre skilled (and have a bit of gear) the rogues biggest issue is that you deal damage a bit more slowly so you kight not like the playstyle, like with warrior, ive been able to pretty much kill someone in a global from lucky crits and procs, cant do that as a rogue except in a few expections but theyre rare
---
You aren't in my AVs then
---
Ok? He said ally and you started talking about queue times where ally don’t have them
---
What pvp? 
---
There is always some 60% mounts anyway and if your raid is leaving them behind then your raid sucks so 100% mount is irrelevant for raids.
---
couldn't farm what exactly?
---
it's literally an extra minute or so to get to most dungeons and you are waiting for slowpokes half  the time anyway 
---
i'd rather have 10 lionhearts than 10 100% mounts yes, that 0.5 second gets added on every single mob in the raid not just bosses, all of a sudden your raid is a few minutes faster 
---
farm what things? I'd argue that a lionheart would help more for almost all farming except you guessed it herbing and mining
---
More than ever   
---
Hour after   
---
Our work is   
---
Never ogre
---
Gehennas alliance is really starved on dps warriors, probably the most sought after class at the moment.
---
Feel the same way. Id add cast bar trackers to that list, too. Totally unvanilla in spirit. Either we all see enemy cast bars or nobody.
---
Dude smd I'm not gonna make a video to prove my point just videos for you. [Here is another youtuber that claims that taurens in fact get 5% total HP from Stamina/HP](https://youtu.be/KLp-vA_KBUo?t=524). Where are your fucking sources?   
---
The only thing I am not sure about is if Endurance had it's updated TBC version where you actually get 5% base HP. But since we playing this game on Naxx patch I assume it's not the case.
---
This.  No changes went out the window on release day.  Change this and the game becomes somewhat playable again.
---
I played tauren in vanilla.
---
Last night we had a 55 rogue get what I think was his pre bis dagger. I love seeing ppl get excited. He needed the spider guy and asked cause he was confused where is spider dude (can't remember name). We had done 2 runs so the third he spawns and were all here he is and yeah. It was cool.
---
Mate there are youtube videos of people solo’ing DM East with nothing but rings on. It’s really not that hard with a bit of practice. Soloing mauradon is even easier.
---
Le wife no sex marriage amiright Reddit??
---
It’s not terrible, you have your usual assholes but it’s fun. Last estimation horde outnumber us but most I’ve encountered 1v1 they’re ok at best. You have your few you really have to pay attention when you’re fighting them. If you do transfer over PM me and I’ll add you and help you out when I can.
---
^ based on private servers that got many things wrong.
---
Either way, not really something worth discussing.
---
EDIT: you are right, just checked on a lowbie tauren I have, health is indeed 105%
---
As someone else said, it was changed to be 5% base health later I think the pre-tbc patch.
---
It was an option but most didn't know how good fire was back then, plus other mages would need to be on board for it to work
---
while i theoretically could do that there is nothing i need from any dungeons at all. so i spend my time in AV / WSG or farming gold
---
That’s the joke!
---
&gt;So rank 12+ yields you AQ40/Naxx level gear month before these raids are available and with no need to replace it once those raids will be there
---
That's not even true. No need to come up with bullshit.
---
I can deal with that. What kills me is the folks that list arrows in stacks of ONE... especially the slick ones that throw a single arrow in between real stacks so if you are clicking through quickly you will get burned.
---
I appreciate that, I’ll make sure it’s in my macro though I thought I did have that it’s probably smart to double check
---
Yes, exist and [@target] are the default not needed in a macro. The dead mod is only needed for things like rez spells. So nodead doesn't really matter either. [@mouseover,help] or [@mouseover,harm] is enough for 99.9% of cases and will save macro space.
---
    /cancelform
---
    /use [@mouseover,help]Regrowth;Regrowth    
---
This will heal with Regrowth on your friendly mouse over target. Heal a friendly target if you have one selected. Then also heal yourself if no target or no friendly target exists. Saves a lot of space.
---
EDIT: formatting
---
Didn't it change to base stamina in tbc?  I could be mistaken.
---
I didn't roll on a pvp server for the pvp, I rolled on it for the player base.
---
/u/antani101
---
So it took you 4x as long as full pre BIS and full consumes
---
Not sure how after countless nerfs to will of the forsaken blizzard thought that would be OK, it's fucking stupid, everybody knew it was op as shit.
---
I guess you need to wand during first two phases lol.
---
Oh sorry, I had the audio muted! This is awesome! Nice job!
---
Don't do 40 man raids then, especially for ony it's a waste of IDs. In an ony split with \~15 players everyone matters, a lot. I usually have 35-40% of the healing done, and you can't just spam flash heal for 1 minute until the boss is dead. Same for MC splits which our guild tried this ID too.
---
Pick up some +hit gear and roll shadow if you can convince your raid leader to let you. In vanilla I was healing up into bwl and was finally allowed to spec shadow. The warlocks loved me and I was regularly competing for the top spot on the damage meters. I was still off-healing and helping with buffs of course but it beat the hell out of using my mana pool for overhealing everyone because the other healers simply have faster cast times than anything we have besides renew.
---
Bet anything ppl who don’t farm prebis or consumes but still clear MC in 2hrs have 39 other people who are farming those things
---
I disagree. I think TBC would be much more successful. The hype around TBC is huge. I don't see players getting hyped for new content like that especially because of what I said in my first comment, blizzard most likely wont put the resources into it to have it live up to the wow standard. There is a strong likelyhood that if they go the classic+ route we will end up with new yet uninspired cheap content just like OSRS.
---
25k per hr lmao.  I’d love to see proof of this rate consistently
---
here's a fun thought: are you logging your raids?
---
if not, start, and when it turns out he's a low-blue ilvl parser (bet you anything he's hitting consistent 62s), confront him with that fact and this thing he said:
---
&gt;how he can't do any more right now without gear
---
it seems to me this guy is a powergamer and he just doesn't have the correct challenge teed up in front of him. if people don't have logs to go off of, they have no idea how well they're doing except for relative to the rest of the raid. doing top dps on every boss is less impressive when your raid is 40th percentile overall, etc etc
---
anyway logging your raids is useful anyway because it doesn't just give that guy the metrics to evaluate his performance, it gives *everyone* that
---
Every day is groundhog day.
---
Those are bots anyway doesn’t take much time
---
The way you worded that is ultra toxic, you’d make a poor leader
---
I think specing into improved feign death is pretty mandatory.
---
Doubtful. New retail releases that day and I doubt they'll overlap content releases like that. I'd expect bwl in February at the earliest. Classic obviously doesn't have the staffing support and mythic raids in retail get a lot of dev support for bugs/exploits the first two weeks.
---
Probably this. First Grand Marshals will arrive February 4th

Hello, this is the fun police. Fun was detected and promptly removed. Thank you for contacting us.

They need to pay

...The same as I am now, since I'm already experienced with the game.
---
What's funny about this post is that originally in vanilla. AV was the Go to BG for 50s. Quests, Mobs to grind, Free gear, gathering nodes, the whole shebang.  Other than AV weekend ofc because then you'd have premades rushing drek and killing him in 15 mins.(1.5 av btw, it's really common to see recordings of it on private servers like light's hope of people doing back to back 15 min wins) All the 60s were doing AB or WSG.
---
Hmm yeah that's just my guess. I feel like most guilds are ready or close too. We made out last ony cloaks last week so we have all 40 ready for the raid.
---
why does your Anathema look so strange?
---
Frost mages and paladins can save their money.
---
We'll all reach a point where we have to ask ourselves, "Are we still enjoying this game?" And if not, then maybe it's time for a spec/class change or to just a take a break.
---
I sorta understand how you feel about raiding with shamy, it's what I did in vanilla and always wanted to be Ele. However that wasn't good for the raid nor was taking SP gear from mages/locks. I had a few 60's back then too and the Mage always appealed to me. 
---
So here I am 15 years later playing exactly the class that I enjoy the most.
---
Deathbringer's Axe x2

Sorry for reposting my own meme, lol  
---
mods deleted because not meme sunday, so i reposted **my own shit**
---
Trust me as a Horde player going alliance for classic since vanilla they're just as stupid if u get unlucky enough. But I think they're fun I have the done the funniest shit with them as ally on faerlina like lick them as cpugar.
---
the argument on horde side is whether or not to cap that first GY (SH i'm pretty sure).
---
Seems like if horde caps it there's like a 70% chance we win but also like a 100% chance of a slow game. So do we rush and win like 20% of games but get done fast or do we cap SH and draw it out and win 70% but spend like 3-5x the time in there? 
---
Honestly I don't mind a mix, I ususally try to go with whatever strat seems to be the choice of the majority in that specific BG because I'd rather lose without everyone arguing and bitching the whole time than argue for 60 mins for a win.
---
CLEAR COMMS
---
I also want to make an alt (ashbringer server, pvp nicely balanced, i think 49/51 in fav of ally). I'd also consider a hunter.
---
Yea it makes sense for the turnin things, but it shouldn't apply to tradeable loot. Dunno if their system supports that though.
---
Is there an archive of these memes, I fucking die laughing everytime
---
Why whould i wish for that? Id like to have strong spanish servers, but Blizzard fucked up as always.    
---
Releasing classic without servers for the spanish community was their first mistake, separating the community.   
---
Not releasing a pve server was the second, forcing the pve people to level a new character from scratch on a pvp server as you cannot transfer from pve to pvp servers, for them to then to push a phase 2 without bgs.   
---
And lastly to open transfers sudently without monitoring server faction stability.    
---
**Saying it is populated and healthy is a blatant lie.**     
---
Do you know why only one guild ( WoW Legends ) transfered? Cause only 3 guilds had that option ( WoW Legends, NSFW and Bandits Club ).     
---
The rest of the guilds have less than a full roster, if you'd be a GM or have any sort of power in any guild youd understand what that means: that transfering whould be the end of their raids without an option to recruit more people. Efectively making them Zombie Guilds.
---
**Mandokir is like a headless chicken, still running but not for long.**

It's called swatter, comes with auctioneer I think
---
They just wanted more loot continuity, used to not getting any loot because of "loot councils" so keeping in the same vein now it's FFA loot.  Healing, so appealing!
---
19 minute queue,
---
17 minute game,
---
10 minutes drinking
---
0 loot
---
Honestly you're a bit late to the party. Isnt anything much you can make big bucks 2-5x investment on. Librams will surely rise bit requires a lot of gold to purchase. Enchanting mats will rise to, especially eternal essences.
---
Haha 😂 
---
That might work. Keep him chasing the dragon
---
Did you get invite?
---
Because many of these guys stream the entire thing, would be freaking hard to claim someone is cheating/botting/account sharing when this guy is sitting there talking to his viewers and ranking 16 hours a day. Would it not?
---
16 is doable, 24 is not
---
It really sounds like you just want more of a chance. You’re literally complaining about another team using defense, however you look at it.
---
it's almost as if you're sad about it
---
Alot of the honor numbers these guys are pulling would not be possible without playing 23-24 a day woth horde queue times right now.
---
IE The perfect guild
---
He didn't say he was heroic. All of that potential you talk about is pointless in the end even if it's for something "charitable". Everybody will die, this planet will one day be destroyed, the universe will experience heat death. You're the only one that can decide what's important to you.
---
I promise you, as one of 3 people playing one r14 account it was not about skill. I didn’t even know how to play a shadow priest, I just grinded av for my friend. This was in real classic tho
---
Master dragonslayers ring, crol shorukh, dooms Edge, drake fang talisman, chromatic boots, prob forgot some items.
---
Personally i take intellect, but either option in practical gameplay doesn't make a massive difference.
---
Mages didn't get their class rework until patch 1.11 (the Naxxramas patch). Fire spec was kinda crappy before that patch, and even afterwards, it took a month or two before people realized fire was not only viable but optimal.
---
For what it's worth, frost mages didn't get Winter's Chill until the Naxx patch, either.
---
They aren't even doing 7 days a week and pulling those numbers. Seen a guy have 100% winrate in WSG for a freaking week straight. It's just money, gold, consumables, flasks, grenades, everything.
---
They are still livestreaming it, so good luck on reporting someone based on your own insecurity versus their video proof.
---
Different people can have different opinions about what the queue means to them.
---
In this situation, the horde mirror is different - the Stormpike relief hut is right next to the keep, so its much harder to ninja than Frostwolf relief hut when fighting warmasters. That dumb hunter is the problem, by giving other Allies a false sense that someone was guarding it, so nobody else felt the need to guard too. I remember the same shit in AB - fuck AFKers.
---
A guy on my small server is already at 1.5 million for the week yesterday
---
For Rogue DPS pre-MC weapons: would the best combo now be the 2 AV daggers in MH/OH? Even as human?
---
If you could solo the NPC that does the Onyxia head turn in quest you would definitely get paid on most servers.
---
My wife would leave me and she would have every right to do so.
---
I found a local av premade discord that requires rank 7, epic mount and pre bis. It’s changed my life.
---
Well, a small but important correction is that in 1.12 (which Classic is based on), Diminishing Returns do indeed exist. It is still insane to have a 30% stun resist (5% baseline + 25% racial trait) for Orcs, and a self cleanse on a 2 minute cooldown for Undead. I’m not sure how someone can think those aren’t powerful abilities.
---
Ideally you want a fast offhand but it matters less than effective dps does. With no +5 dagger skill brut blade would be better than CHT for you. Highest TPS in this phase regardless of race is Perdition's + CHT with +5 dagger skill though.
---
If I can just get a character to 60, I'll be happy. And then reroll.
---
Luckily humans got the best pvp racial in later expansions
---
Since you can't be login on to both characters at the same time, the class of your main is largely immaterial. If you're interested in a class that has good pre-mount mobility, druids get travel form at level 30. Or if you don't want to spend money on a mount, warlocks get their level 40 mount for free and their level 60 mount for a lot cheaper than other classes. (Paladins do too but that's a no-go since your main is horde)
---
Atleast they be healing something then
---
That’s not how this works. That’s not how any of this works
---
Those premades cause a lot of problems for alliance too.  What happens is 25 people queue for premade and sit on the queue when only 20 get it.  The other 5 queue for that game specifically to see if they get in...If they don't, they cancel and move on.
---
What happens is now we have 20 players who haven't joined the game when the gate opens and it's a 20v40 for the most important part of the game.
---
Almost 3/4 of my games started with us at a 10 man deficit or more last night.
---
Top rankers on Gehennas EU did 16hours a day for about 5 (sometimes 6 days), then they raid on Tuesdays and do it all over again. Sometimes you end up behind and have to push harder, one rogue on horde side gehennas got two hours of sleep between thursday and saturday just to catch up and get back into bracket 14.
---
Still, the point still stands you can report and accuse people as much as you want, the fact is they still are livestreaming on Twitch/Mixer and such. 
---
Their Weakaura shows 19.7k/hour honor doing AV "premades" and also mixing in WSG premades.
---
Humans had everyman for themselves by wotlk I cant remember if it was in tbc or wotlk when they added it though
---
I mean if they can locked it on FFA they can lock it on group...
---
Very useful, but as an ally player, I have to downvote! Nothing personal! /kiss
---
I play nelf hunter and I honestly can't imagine life without shadowmeld at this point.  It may not be meta for individual pvp battles, but no single ability helped me survive the shitshow that phase 2 was as much as shadowmeld did.
---
Tokens? As in tradeable for gold? IMO, that causes a much larger impact than something like “oh look, I can make all my helms be a crown of fire/ice” (this was a long time cosmetic offered). I personally don’t mind the tokens, but it definitely causes a change in gameplay mentality and play quantity when you have a Blizzard condoned gold trade.
---
For sap, put some distance between you and the flag. I’m pretty sure if you force the rogue to move even just a little bit after landing the sap that he doesn’t have full time to get the cap.
---
It was there during wotlk. I can't remember if it was added in wotlk or tbc though
---
Agreed. This only worked because the dps listened well and stopped attacking onyxia for long enough for the tank to get aggro
---
Yeah this, just kick him. This isn’t retail mythic raiding where DPS and mix maxing matters. Unless your guild is going for speed runs, it ain’t worth it to keep him.
---
Haha. To be fair, I am a hunter who has been 8/8 for over a month now. The only pieces im missing are weps (but im using Lok atm), and QSR. I still showup to every raid knowing I won't get more loot for quite awhile. But I am also love trying to parse legendary.
---
I’d say more often than not the bigdick damage guys are the type of players who would have the best mechanics, but yeah, this totally holds either way.
---
I think youre overestimating how hard MC is.
---
Just seems like these guys have a bunch of shill followers that will do anything for them
---
+1 for dreamscape
---
I have way more fun in turtles that I do waiting in 20 minute queues.
---
If this is fixed then the best way to get honor is to run an AV afk bot. At least right now alliance premade AVs gain significantly more honor per hour than afk bots.
---
Noggenfogger doesn’t work with gnome but good to know about fire water.
---
if you have 2h fury warriors topping meters your DW warriors are failing, probably your rogues too
---
Fun.
---
counterpoint, whats the difference between a fully dedicated raid member, that does or doesnt have the &lt;guild&gt; tag. Truth is that any guildie can gquit at any time.
---
I think increased rewards would be better than nerfing IMO. Make WSG more worth it
---
If you get stuck in a 45 minute game, you should be doing the turn ins, which will greatly increase your rep gains.
---
&gt; BoP also only protects you from physical. Literally outside of warriors and rogues you can have someone just finish off the person with BoP
---
Say your a pally with a priest healing your group in pvp and a rogue sneeks into the back line and jumps on your priest you BoP them and now that rogue isn't a threat and your team now has time to react and save the priest
---
&gt; Freedom can be dispelled or stolen
---
Doesn't matter if it gets removed it still did its job of removing all slows and snares allowing the person to move away, also there isn't always going to be a priest or shaman spamming buff removal on every person in the group, they have other tasks like healing so it often won't instantly be removed. (also funny how it can't be stolen as spell steal was a BC spell)
---
&gt; waste bubble by simply leaving
---
 This is what you use bubble for, its like a CC that makes people go attack someone else leaving you fee to do what ever.
---
&gt;Horde have an AOE stun. This is another interrupt. YOu can also follow this up to increase a stunlock on another player.
---
Warstomp effects DR, has a cast time, can stun a max of 5 people, and has a short range of 8 yards
---
&gt; Imagine AOE stunning Alliance piled up in Dreks room
---
Imagine not all stacking up in one place or actually guarding the door to the room.
---
&gt; theres no DR in vanilla
---
there 100% is DR in classic just like there was in vanilla.
---
&gt; Horde have a 25% PASSIVE RESIST to stuns
---
Have you tried using CC that isn't stuns on orcs, like say a fear from a warlock.
---
&gt; Horde have immunity to Poly, Charm, fears ON A 2 MIN CD
---
WOTF only effects Charm, fear or sleep, try stunning them or using poly.
---
&gt; You're using Paladins as an example becuase thats the only thing you can think of.
---
No its just paladins are the biggest reason to roll alliance for structured pvp, lets look at the ally racials, night elves shadow meld allows them to set up ambushes as well as making nelf rogues and druids harder to see in stealth, Dwarfs stoneform is really good vs rogues, feral druids, warriors, and is helpful vs hunters, Gnomes escape artist, being able to remove snares and roots is really good in pvp along with the +5% int being good for casters, and humans perception is the weakest racial only because of how situational it is, but when in that situation its really powerful.
---
&gt; These abilities are also useless outside being with a group
---
It's almost like wow is a mmo centered around group play...
---
Crazy how waiting 15-20 minutes for a game to pop makes the horde actually wants to win.
---
Easy to do as ally; i rely on turn ins to get the most of my rep o5herwise its like 200rep max per 30 min; thanks to the queue; so stfu
---
I believe they fixed the maps so they were no longer beneficial to one faction over the other.
---
I also feel a part of it is the barbarian tribe aesthetic or undead bad guy aesthetic appeal more to people who like pvp. People who like looking brutal also like killing other players.
---
Yeah we are all entitled to our own opinions, even if they at times, like right now, are awful.
---
Tbh blue shoulders/leg 2 pc is BiS til you can use T2.5 with Carnage legs in Naxx
---
Good stuff. "Honor" is a fuckers game.
---
Downsides will be in your grouping opportunities. Less people making groups, less guilds, less people farming materials and professions. You'll be playing solo a lot and find dungeons hard to do.
---
Buffing wsg honor and rep would help, but doesn't look likely
---
that would be good too.  I feel like even taking away the honor from LT's would make it a bit more even.  I'm not sure how you could buff WSG
---
How dare people want to play with their friends and guilds, they should be shamed in the streets for such heinous behavior.
---
This is essentially a problem with no solution, you either make it blind what AV you get into and stop people from being able to play with their friends or you just suck it up.
---
For mages only the boots are worth it alone, and those plus one for the set bonus.
---
Hey congrats on the run! Didnt take as long as I thought it would lol. Also what unit frames are you using?
---
Heavily?  A few GFPPs and maybe couple mana pots and 25 silver in food buffs for key fights is not asking much.  Like, you can do 15-20g of consumables once a week, not asking a lot. 
---
Minor upgrades?  There are people who show up in completely scuffed gear and do half the DPS of people with 90% pre-bis and don't even bring one GFPP.  You're warping "slacker" here.  I don't think anyone but you is thinking someone is "slacking" if they are 3 spellpower off the true BIS item. 
---
Big time straw man here, bud.  People will show up and do HALF the dps of people in pre-bis because their gear and consumes are so trash.  They are getting carried.
---
Correct.
---
I've found slow OHs to be a problem without very high crit to keep flurry up. Grant it, I don't have 2 DBs, but from my experience I wouldn't use 2 slow weapons until you're pushing above 25% crit.
---
Psychologically i think thats true. But in my experience as horde, I've won 90%+ of my wsg matches
---
Make a macro where you combine raptor strike and wing clip. They're not on the same cooldown, best tip i ever heard
---
I had this issue. Mine was hardware related but that doesn't mean yours is, since this error code is very generic.
---
Start with the usual culprits. Update/disable addons. Repair/reinstall game. Update drivers, Windows. You can also take a look at the Event Viewer and see if there are any other reports during the time of the crash. It might help pin point the problem.
---
If that doesn't help considering uploading your error reports, MSinfo and DxDiag on battle.net forums, I got a lot of help there from Blizzard and fellow players when I was having my issue.
---
This guy's already posting from January, check out those t2 shoulders.
---
well sure but the conversation was about rank gear.
---
The problem is that there are premades which would prefer to dodge each other, cuz they aren't there to actually PvP they're just there to grind honor... this leads to situations in which games will start on 20 pugs vs 40 premade...
---
If it's a horde premade, they will farm the GYs without capping them for 30 mins to maximize honor gained, then kill Vandar... the reason for doing this is the queue times... if they're going to sit in queue for 20 minutes before the match, they want to maximize honor... so shitting on ressing players in a GY helps that...
---
As far as Ally premades, because of queue times they are more interested in just zerging for the win as fast as possible so they don't farm GYs.
---
Basically, as it's always been, AV is full tilt trash, it's not even PvP it's clowncar shit. The main hope is that the critical mass that makes AV flow the way it currently does slows down to a point where people flip their honor/ranking grinds to WSG and actually start PvPing. It will eventually happen regardless of Bliz tweaking honor numbers to incentivize it.
---
didnt read, op
---
What about P3.5-5?
---
Buffing WSG honor would be the same thing as nerfing AV honor in the grand scheme of things for people trying to rank
---
Does killing him with all priests give you anything besides bragging rights?
---
I was a newbie to wow when classic released and the most intuitive guide that i found was [classic.live](https://classic.live) the step by step with locations helped the journey keep me in a efficient direction since i wanted to use time spent wisely. They include dungeons however you honestly can skip any part of the guide and be perfectly fine, generally the recommendation from most is to do a dungeon once or twice to complete the quests associated then back to the usual questing.
---
Gnomish death ray is great as feral. Rocket helm should work in form.
---
Spend time farming different areas to find out what you like. 
---
AH literally anything which will ah for more than vendor.
---
Make a bank character so that u get in the habit of mailing ah stuff to them.
---
Bank alt is non negotiable, if you want to make gold, make a bank alt
---
None cares
---
How do you figure? The r10 set is better than T1 for pvp. With only rank 8, I already have 4k hp unbuffed.
---
Yeah, the ranged weapon is the most important piece of gear for a hunter; using it for anything other than raw damage is bad.
---
Also worth noting that when blood fury says base attack power it means not including +AP values but does include +str
---
Rep as nothing to do here. Please do not buff WSG rep, dont turn it into a AV like re that you can farm on two days. Just buff honor in WSG.
---
216
---
Exact opposite for my guild. 1 leaf 4 eyes.
---
Thank you man, been trying to figure that out for a while. Been trying to get that cape for so long
---
ah ok so passive returns it to that spot, that's what I was missing, thanks
---
I can't stand people that 'defend' and alt-tab to do other shit.
---
People would just skip then entirely. This wouldn't solve anything.
---
Oh boy. The "well this wasn't part of our pre-determined plan of fun".
---
That shit is why so many WoW expansions have been so disappointing lately. Blizzard locks the players onto the rails and anytime a player deviates from that planned route, there is a hotfix/patch that removes the fun.
---
And the time it took to get the pre bis and consumables? Exactly. We spend less time to farm mc than these hc guilds. Because we spend close to 0 time prepping for it. 
---
Only took us a few weeks to get it down to &lt;2hr runs.
---
I am speculating transmute will be worth 5g. Which is probably the safest thing in wow.
---
Thank you for making these
---
That doesn't make sense. A fast OH would just eat Flurry charges faster, and you'd still be looking at the same amount of instant attacks.
---
was in an AV yesterday where people still weren't even to the middle of the map yet and the self-elected "leader" was upset that people didn't follow his instructions and said "wow gg guys we already lost."
---
hadn't seen a single horde yet, no one had engaged in combat, dude already gave up. obviously i don't know what it's like horde side in chat but alliance side is pure cancer
---
As a tank I don't kite, such is for weak people. I just pop cooldowns and hope for the best, like a real man.
---
Additionally, the negatives listed above will likely get increasingly worse as more and more people transfer or quit.
---
Yeah I’ve got a level 12 warrior I’d I’d
---
You are more than welcome, have a good Christmas!
---
the blue shoulders/legs are fantastic for warriors
---
Glorious!
---
Why is a level 26 sitting in Orgrimmar?
---
1100g in 5 days from death rolls. It's 100% luck. 
---
At the moment I'm -200g.
---
Yeah my point was I want to play AV and I want to farm. Or I need to farm to get stuff I want. So the queue lets me mix both in a pretty good way. 
---
But good for you having short queues. I think it's nice that alliance gets to have something going for them for once.
---
That's so fucked lol. Give me your luck god dammit!
---
Maybe Blacksmithing with the  [Arcanite Skeleton Key](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Arcanite_Skeleton_Key)
---
In my experience horde side has been chill
---
Most alliance do not want to be in a 30+ min game, the sweaty try hards aim for 8-12 min games hoping horde don't turtle. Even in premades. Once the first push is stopped or broken, people will immediately afk out, take a break, and go again with an instant queue 15 min later and try again.
---
Haha, I see how you thought it was a legit question, but /r/whoosh :D
---
Please, end this AV ranking cancer.
---
Warlock... casting?
---
If your server is still active, and you’re just on the low end of a 60-40 split, not a lot will be affected. 
---
Farming spots will be taken by members of both factions, regardless. 
---
The main thing to worry about is whether or not your faction is active, and will remain so.
---
Lmao I love shit like this.  Perverse beyond the point of recognition.
---
Maybe some type of ASPCA commercial for abused war master NPCs.  That's my best guess.
---
Could be a million reasons. Maybe they wanted it to keep clearing bwl/mc, maybe it was for PvP, maybe it was because the survivability was more valuable than the DMG in naxx at the time.
---
I was so spoiled farming prebis I got every item I wanted from brd in 2 runs, and don't think I had to run any other instances more than 5 times except for two exceptions. It took me 25 runs for star of mysteria and I ended up paying a mage one orb not to roll against me.
---
Jed's trinket took me about 60 runs and I lost roll on it 10 times over half of which were to healers.
---
I still do arena runs almost every night though for raid 2 members who need their stuff when I'm bored though
---
ur doing it to urself, u turtle, so ally cba playing unless its premade, and if ally premades u get ass fucked.
---
Way back in like 2006 when I was either a noob or before I even played the game, I saw a video of Kazzak being brought into Stormwind. That was one of the coolest things I had ever seen in my life. An mmorpg like WoW was already mindblowing to me back then, but seeing a boss walk into a city with hundreds of players fighting and dying was the most exciting shit ever.
---
I was under the impression that the boss was attacking the city on it's own, but still. If Blizzard decided that wasn't fun and despawned Kazzak before he reached the city, that would have robbed me of that moment.
---
Alot of these classic bois don't know attrition was really taking it's toll by the time AQ was starting. Raiding for a year or more by that point, same class,  alt raids forming, people switching mains. People were in general just getting burn out.
---
I can tell you now, ranking on Whitemane Ally is currently looking like it’s going to be nearly impossible- people are going extremely hard so far, and I know several people who are holding off for a month or two hoping to see things cool off a bit. 
---
Outside of that, the economy is a bit whack and the queues can require some extra prep for raid nights; but it’s pretty good overall.
---
Lol the staff slap
---
These are unfailingly amusing. Please don't stop making these.
---
no changes
---
If you're PVP ranking, use that time to ghetto hearth from RFC and gank a high level zone
---
&gt; everyone on the horde is at least decently capable of pvp
---
lol no.
---
These are always so good.
---
I got this yesterday. 
---
Happened 10 times in 2 minutes of playtime. 
---
Restarted computer. deleted the last two addons I've downloaded. 
---
Haven't had the problem since
---
America where they value personal wealth way higher
---
They’re hugging the AV war master and no love for the WSG night elf
---
Alternatively I picked alliance and a bad race for the class specifically because I wanted to fuck up unsuspecting horde. 
---
Once you add gear, skill, engineering into the mix, metaslaving is kinda irrelevant. Maybe if I was trying to be top arena it'd matter, but eh.
---
Yeah, only horde does this.
---
Horde has better pvp racials and thus attracts the people who take pvp more seriously. Simple as that.
---
Thats just wrong. Unless your Raid and players are super shit pre bis geared Rogues/Warriors are out dpsing Hunters. Even geared ones.
---
But I didn't feel like it
---
Wouldn’t that just split the classic wow community to much?
---
Unpopular because most people still think TBC was the best.
---
Downvotes are the proof
---
https://youtu.be/0KcOHcYGiBk
---
100%
---
Hah!
---
Thank you, i want to be able to farm for gold as well since shaman is a little difficult. Can. Warlock aoe farm zf the same as a mage or are there different gold farm methods for locks?
---
I've played both sides and seen some real derp shit on both sides. Pretending everyone who picks red at character select is magically competent is wildly inaccurate.
---
You aren't playing with friends and guilds. You are sitting in a discord lobby with 100 people and being assigned a channel based which AV number you get. It's a tiresome meta but it is what it is and I don't believe it's really fixable.
---
Retail
---
Nerf all BGs and AV more so wpvp can come back...
---
I'm so triggered by "60 lvl" followed by "lvl 48". Why OP... why?!
---
I dont do AV premades, but how are you going to get rid of premades without taking away peoples ability to play with their friends and guilds?
---
Healing rn in PvP feels actually awful as any healer because warriors that know how to gear + MS + purge + engineering + faps means you barely even actually get to heal. It’s also just gonna get worse.
---
It’s nice against disorganized groups but with proper focus fire healing actually feels futile.
---
Specially as the warrior. No wonder people think warr is hard to level. Do only green quests dumbos
---
Idk i have been on both lately. Classic is getting more dull each week and i haven't played retail in years so there's so much to do. I'm probably the minority though
---
I love healing raids on my resto. It's much more entertaining than my main, mage.
---
I don't get how WSG is the PVP bg. The goal is capture the flag. It's a awful lot of running, trying to stop running, and touching flags. WoW pvp in a nutshell.
---
Who pvps to get better gear for pvp?
---
The unexpected happened today in alliance AV.
---
Half alliance raid managed to run down and cap FW GY. Field of Strife had a blockade of at least 15 horde killing lone riders and small packs. 
---
Some guy and I told people to run south as ghosts to bypass the blockade. And then te unexpected happened....
---
... They followed the orders and we won... Unbelieveble
---
For anyone that's interested in more content like this I have a load more on my Youtube channel:  [https://www.youtube.com/snackybox](https://www.youtube.com/snackybox) 
---
Have a great Christmas guys!
---
It's because one is an instant cast, and one is on next melee attack.
---
People who enjoy pvping.
---
Who pves to get better gear for pve?
---
My sexy cow would like a word
---
I get what your saying, but put that in the title too so you dont have people raising pitchforks
---
I feel like there's nothing like DH.
---
For the "speed" and "damage I would say rogues.
---
For the movement I think feral?
---
And selfsustain warlock maybe. 
---
But nothing comes really close to it.
---
Warrior is the absolute worst class to level tho, they’re good with groups but solo leveling is awful. (That being said, warrior was my first 60)
---
Leveled a lock to 35 for Arcanite xmute and now leveling a pally for pvp and it’s a whole new world from warrior. 2-3 mobs *isnt* a death sentence
---
Which areas should be fully discovered for 19 Twinks (A)?
---
Main cities, Hillsbrad, Ashenvale for PVP vendor and STV for Arena/Fishing?  
---
Zones like the Barrens aren’t contested so probably won’t be worth it?

---
You need to backped though and many don’t have key bind
---
But wihtout timers just scale dmg hp and add fun mechanics
---
Health and mana bar a bit too small for me. Quite minimalistic, I like it. I guess you play on a huge screen
---
People still.dont understand overhealing neither in classic or retail
---
Regular potions do not share CD with specialty items like healthstones, whipper root tubers, demonic/dark runes. They count as 2 separate groups.
---
He should play retail.
---
Horde side seems to be that most players are resolved to farm Lts &amp; Bal and then push till we lose. Sometimes you get lucky and we get a good 10-15 that agree to defend choke points long enough to stall and win. Nearly every match I've done a couple of us who played private servers try to convince everyone to skip to the backdoor. This SOMETIMES yields 2 to 3 players following you. Everyone else stupidly runs right through the choke point at SH gy, and again across the bridge of death. Then fill the chat with shit posting.
---
Sometimes I get lucky and the ally turtle. They seem to bot know how to summon the NPC bosses, or they dont defend them when they do. We then summon ours and push for a longer but far more satisfying win.
---
The map favors alliance zergs, but if the horde defend smartly, the map favors a horde push campaign.
---
This might be a dumb thought but I enjoyed healing in wow when the numbers went above the targets like damage does. Playing a druid and seeing my hots tick all over the BG or raid was always rewarding. I imagine seeing the number that each jump of chain heal does would make it slightly more interesting.
---
How the hell do you define top 100 healer lol
---
Even if alliance captures Snowfall, if you even think of capping stonehearth someone is going to lose their fucking mind in BG chat. It's actually hilarious.
---
Free cap for the quest ;)
---
It was WotLK when they changed human racial
---
Because priest is the only true healer remember hybrid tax and what not
---
Elixir's don't count as a performance enhancing drug...right?
---
Haha awesome. I'm not a mage but I jumped onto the outside window as the ship was leaving once.
---
it was tongue in cheek
---
True assets to a raid team understand we are not trying to fill 13 slots for one character but 520 slots for all the raid. It's not about his personal dps but the raid overall.
---
This attitude is canary in the coal mine of people that will jump ship as soon as things get tough.
---
Can any Resto Druids that use Sixtyupgrades.com or anyone interested in checking it out (it's a BiS item tracker that ranks all items) please give advice on if the default Restoration EP is accurate or not? 
---
The default Restoration EP for druids has a lot of close items ranked and I'm wondering how accurate it is.
---
For example it ranks Verdant Footpads and T1 boots within 1 point of each other, is that an accurate ranking, meaning either item is about equal depending on what you want to prioritize?
---
Similar with Padres trousers and T1 legs. It has Padres about 7 points ahead, are they actually better though?
---
I know a lot of it is subjective and depends on if you want more + healing or sustain for longer fights, just curious what other resto druids think about how the stats are prioritized since I've been using it to choose my upgrades and build my BiS set.
---
Why not nerf both? Make it so premades in WSG make around the same amount of honor as AV, and just make AB be around the same without 5m premade.
---
lol sorry but as a mage main with over 30 days /played that blink did absolutely nothing to help him get on the boat. Blink does not travel you horizontally across the air. It checks along the ground under you to see if there's a path along that ground, and then puts you as far forward on that path as it can, up to 20 yards away. A valid blink path is very strict. Even a tiny pebble or a crack in the ground will stop it early, let alone a wall or complete lack of land as shown in the clip. If you blink very shortly after you jump off of a cliff, it puts you back at the cliff. Therefore, to have landed on the boat like that, his character would've had to be already safely above the boat. 
---
It probably just looked like he blinked through the air because of latency. Consider that on the mage's screen, he moves his own character with 0 delay, and also on the mage's screen, the boat is actually behind where it is according to the server. So if he just barely makes it on when he has 1000 ms of lag (just as an example), he is able to get on it just fine on his screen, but for you it looked like he did something miraculous, because he essentially got on the boat 1 second earlier than he should have been able to on an observer's screen.
---
You’re just asking one guy though.
---
That’s not the majority.
---
2 times HoJ dropped on the first run and once 2  50s rogues in my group both got the HoJ drop within 5 runs.
---
Turtles just give me a headache.
---
Having to wait 15 minutes in queue I'd rather have a long won than a quick loss
---
Raid lockouts for one. Whats to stop a untagged raider from deciding they want to raid with a different raid group from week to week?
---
A guild will always invest in people with a &lt;tag&gt; first, especially since that investment encourages people to stay in guild. Sure, anyone can gquit at any time, but the more the guild gears you, the more likely you are to stay, barring guild drama or said person being a selfish loot whore. 
---
Guilds are building their core raiding teams now in anticipation of more difficult/rewarding content. They want people committed to the long slog, from BWL and onward where the itemization gets crazy. Yall can either form your own raid team or pair up with another small guild. Hoping to get your mostly druid guild spots on other raids serverwide is a fools errand.
---
It's odd, when we were doing a guildies arena run we had the ring drop, and everyone said grats, that's a bunch of gold. I'm sorry it didn't go that way for you but I'm glad it worked out.
---
Sounds about right. There is always some limp dick who elects himself to be the leader and throws a tantrum when people ignore him.
---
Yeah I agree with that advice. 
---
Do you think it holds true for the other items as well? Should resto druids always prioritize gear with high + healing vs stuff like T1 that has low healing but high stats and mp5?
---
Lol if only they were in classic i would play dh or dk
---
if you don't kill drek before that gy caps, you're probably not gonna win anyway
---
Wtf kind of games are you getting into.  It's usually 1p to 15 people defending at max
---
Heya, it's just ElvUI with the Expressway font!
---
Keep an eye out - those people who sent the post to him were clearly looking to start drama
---
Bots
---
I mean yeah..  no changes!
---
The classic ones.
---
Love these!
---
Serious question, with music used like in the SM video, do you deal with copyright claims?
---
If everyone is on follow, the circle would continue to shrink because the guy doing the following takes a shorter route during turns.
---
Eventually they will collapse into a singular entity, creating such great compressed energy resulting in an explosion that will decorate Ironforge with various body parts of gnomes, dwarves, humans and elves. Maybe with some timing, when the bells ring in the new year?
---
To be honest I didn't realize this was the classic wow one, oops.
---
No. There also wasnt av premades
---
Played AV's yesterday 8 hours, won 3 games.. Yes i play alliance.
---
I hate wsg more than av. Ab on the other hand its what I call good pvp
---
horde chad meanwhile ally virgin
---
Usually between 700-1000 but I haven't checked in a while and I'm not home to check now. Grob horde side. It probably gets sold outside of the ah more often than not.
---
All good- what class do u think in classic is most similar to dh?
---
I started playing in cata and I remember it was always the alliance factions being really strong on the PVp servers. The human racial was OP as fuck as it was basically a free trinket so you didn’t need to get cc pvp trinket and could instead get 2 burst or damage increasing trinkets. I remember in late cata people would start using the heroic trinkets from raids. I played as a warlock and had a heroic trinket called cunning of the cruel which would end up making me more than double the second place damage dealer in 3v3 arenas.
---
You do a ton of speed don't you?
---
Not quite the same, but wlocks can solo pretty much everything. Good way to farm is in southern Winterspring - the eye of shadows.
---
As a shaman myself, if you can log in during off-hours, I wholeheartedly recommend essence of water farming in Azshara. Shamans are the best class for it because of far sight and water walking. No combat required (so it's especially great for resto), just maxed fishing, and especially if you're on a pve server it's passive enough you can easily watch netflix or something while farming. The only catch is it tends to be pretty crowded at peak hours and it's only super profitable if you can play during off-hours.
---
As far as warlocks go, I think they can do better than solo farming ZF, I think the best money they can make is solo farming maraudon. They're also good at farming demons in Felwood for Felcloth and Demonic Runes.
---
What is the add on for these raid frames?
---
True, but you have to weight the chance of a first-roll one vs the hijer probability of a second-roll 1 since the first is out of a much larger sum than the second. 
---
IE first roll out of 100 may lose right away but have to weight that risk against a second roll which is now out of ~50.
---
STV seems like the only important area. You're spending your time in bgs. Personally I don't think lowlevel world pvp is a thing. Might as well just log on your main and kill Greys if ambushing weaker players is what you are after.
---
Cry baby horde cry more
---
along with developing hemorrhoids from sitting in that position in a few days after downloading the game.
---
So I unlocked my frame and moved it, but didn't lock it again and now it has disappeared. Do you know how I get it back?
---
dude it’s like 3 mobs worth of loot relax about the ‘epics’
---
having no queue times honestly sounds so shit
---
The newest or “most fresh” BGs are at the bottom of the list, so joining a game near the top means it’s been going for awhile and could be in a turtle situation, a game near the bottom will most likely be new or just opening the gates
---
Then do it. But posts like these are still laughable
---
Kick him now. People like this are a huge liability to guilds.
---
AV is life
---
We have people spamming the same instructions, then if the game takes longer than usual you get one or a few ragers ("you don't know what you are doing f turtle scrubs", "report the afks"). Overall a pleasant experience.
---
20 people have this in a macro per game
---
At that point is it even worth it anymore? All the time sink into it could be directed towards something else.
---
That's actually pretty backwards. Hardcore guilds will be already mostly or fully geared, so joining one (if they'll have you), you would gear up incredibly quickly.

I had a case of false advertising, only it was MC and they only had Rag up. That entire guild is a personal blacklist now.

The answers you're getting are right, but another use of the mining enchant I didn't see mentioned is that you need 305 mining to get Obsidian in AQ once that comes out.
---
No effect in getting more out of a thorium vein however.
---
trying to get pvp ranks and you don’t actually wanna pvp, only in classic baby
---
We have multiple realms already, it’s not like we’re all together in game.  It might lead to merging realms, but there’s certainly two kinds of players in classic who want different things.  I think there’s the hardcore players that want vanilla over and over again.  The ones who played on private servers starting on new realms every time. The no change crowd.  then players who want regular progression and to experience the expansions, i think this crowd is interested in moderate light change for playability.
---
How is that a shitty attitude? Do you actively donate hundreds of gold to strangers for the sense of "community" and "warm fuzzies" instead of saving up and bettering yourself? I didnt say to taunt them and whatnot but its ignorant to blindly out strangers before yourself, that's how you get used and abused.
---
Mages should gold farm a lot better than a Warlock no? I thought Warlocks were limited to mara farm?
---
There's more to marriage than sex
---
WSG is more fun, change my mind
---
I guess this comment was supposed to be a reply to me. I'm not sure why it won't work and I'm not a Druid myself, so I can't test it. But try changing the /cancelform line to this:
---
/cancelform [@mouseover,help,nodead][@target,help,nodead][@player]
---
Maybe then it will cancel your form if you mouse over someone.

You can’t, he’s just making shit up to seem impressive lol.

---
When I duo 5 runs it takes ~25 minutes and each run also nets ~2-8g in vendor money + if the fire elementals drop Elemental Fire or Essence of Fire that's another 2-5g, so it's not totally fruitless when nothing drops.
---
I could be mistaken, but I’m fairly certain it didn’t bounce to you unless you were pvp flagged. I spent hours propagating that shit through org. It was probably the most fun thing I’ve ever had in wow.
---
Better yet just find dense mobs 2 levels below you, kill 300 in 2 to 3 hours for a level and repeat for 60 whole levels of watching documentaries or movies.
---
I used it when I started farming pre-bis and I would say it's pretty accurate, a lot of tier 1 druid gear isn't very good. Once you get more experience in raids you'll decide if you want more int or healing power or whatever.
---
At low levels, wands are huge for warlocks. Until around the late-30's, using just wand + two dots is the best dps a warlock can do.
---
Think most people agree with that :)
---
If the only criteria is do damage and heal themselves then you have warlock, pally, sham, druid, priest. But nothing plays like DH, they would be broken in classic.
---
I'd choose Alliance just because of instant BG queues. 
---
Only thing I'd change.  I'd stay same server, same class.
---
Imagine caring about rep.
---
I'd roll human Warrior on a RPPvE server instead of mage on PvP. I'd have a much more optimal leveling Strat (this was my first time leveling in wow) 
---
I
---
Hi this happens on the Horde side too have a good day
---
Ya, massive use out of that 3 more spell damage.
---
We can agree to disagree. I just don't think you realize that it takes a lot more time than the bare minimum for YOU to hit rank 14 because you were expected to help others in return. Nobody is going to dedicate all that time just to boost you for nothing in return.
---
Who cares if they sent it to the GM?
---
How do I activiate it? I just need it for sizeing.
---
You joke but some how it's true. I looked at logs one day and saw one mage did 5 more frostbolts than another mage and that's like 10+ seconds of downtime on ragnaros with neither dying or getting thrown into lava.
---
He was in the top 100 healers of his guild of 100 players.
---
19 minute queue lol grats on being horde
---
I agree, I love raid healing as a shaman and find it really engaging. I'd argue it's one of the most engaging roles to play. How man other classes are just spam clicking one button?
---
Every time I resist a kidney shot my nipples harden
---
It's always some guy that's trying to rub elbows with the officers and get into the inner circle, but he's gotta stand-out against ~35 other people so he has to be super annoying to do it.
---
This editing is amazing
---
Retail class they added in Mists of Pandaria. One of their specs is a healer
---
Welcome to vanilla raid healing.
---
It seems boring on paper, but when you remember that most DPS have 1 or 2-button rotations and just mindlessly spam that for the entire raid, healing will seem a lot more fun in comparison. At least healing requires you to pay attention and make quick decisions.
---
That's how the game works, sorry.
---
I was expecting someone named Squidward to complain about the music first.
---
Will of the Forsaken so good.  I went alliance because I wanted to PvP, but nobody else on alliance ever seems to care about it.  So I switched servers to Horde.
---
gay panda stuff
---
I agree- Hence why i asked what class is most similar to dh- can you offer any advice on what classes have similar damage/functionality/self sustain/etc as a dh
---
???? U literally responded to my comment saying exactly why he should care.... R u drunk?

I’m a 53 Paladin struggling to get to 60. When I hit 50 I respecced Holy to just heal dungeons until 60, but now I’m having a hard time finding BRD groups. I went back Ret last night since BGs are our I won’t be ganked as much, but it’s so slow and I’m having a hard time killing mobs tbh. Should I continue the quest grind or go back Holy to dungeon grind? 
---
I have even been considering switching servers to a more populated one in hopes groups are easier to find.
---
you dont use it to get advantage on the opening, you use it to prevent their escape should the fight not go their way.  As a warrior thats not as big of a deal since your bleeds will pop stealth, but for classes like paladin, perception gives you the window you need for that last holy shock, hammer of justice or wrath after you force them to vanish when you bubble out of their stun lock.
---
We knew this for 15 years...
---
Better one is "Sec someone's at the door" and then "It's the cops I have to go, neighbor's house got broken into."
---
ugg, not only is perception a joke, but the the pvp specc'd rogues often have all of the +stealth gear/perks so even as a human with perception popped and a felhunter out they can still sap you undetected.
---
I miss 10 man raiding in general. Retail's flex raiding is neat but I really dislike modern encounter design.
---
That was hype, I'd be so pissed
---
On top of that, he's replying to egregious, a dude famous for knowing the shaman class in and out. Egregious probably top ten shamans ever tbh. His videos are what drove me to roll resto before classic and I rewatch portions of them every few weeks to continue to improve as a player.
---
Pick what you have fun playing
---
Enhancement shaman is similar in it having a simple rotation and travel form, rogue is similar in high attack speed and big cooldowns. Boomkin is similar as it buffs mages (lol).
---
yeah so what
---
Well dunno how it is for others but I can get a general idea of what my faction thinks. Like I can tell that Alliance do not mind losing AV mostly.
---
Do horde mind long bg queues? A horde fella could know!
---
Feed the beast man.
---
This is going nowhere
---
as a rogue, ffa loot is fine : )
---
I wish that was true with us. We have like 6 (could be) tanks and 1-2 mages. People have actually started leveling mages bc we cannot find enough for raid.
---
Every time a warrior charges me but I resist the stun and get away before the hamstring, I sense your nipples hardening.
---
There are no horde av premades.
---
Then bow out now
---
This happened to me when one of my ram sticks was dying, Hope it’s not your situation!

Too bad they reduced the range on nameplates to 20yds or so and made them totally useless to ranged.
---
The best things a content creator can ever make are at 2 A.M, can verify
---
Can you explain?
---
Based on?
---
I'd remain a tauren shaman. I've got big cow energy and I enjoy being able to heal and also toss out offensive spells. It fits my play style. I tried to roll an alt to try being a mage and gave up by 36, it just wasn't any fun.
---
Too much salt, add a potato in the pot to soak some up
---
I looted epics from guards only.
---
alliance queues are still instantaneous
---
Whether it is necessary to even take it first depends on if you are even going to play D. If you don't, no point.  Also, if Alli take SFGY, you let them have that one and go ahead and take SH because Snowfall is the worst spawn on the map.
---
  You also want to take SHGY if alliance decides to play D because if you can't take or lose SP and aid, you get megafucked all the way back to the tunnel.

I met my first Chinese farmer there in vanilla. I was trying to get the pole also and some guy was stealing my traps every time. No replies to my messages. So I started messing with them, dumping aggro on them. Finally I get a reply. Told me in bad English what he was doing and that he didn’t speak good English because he was Chinese. Pretty much all he did was those traps for gold.
---
Actually you can get chat banned automatically from a high volume of reports...with no review or oversight.
---
It's basically an anti rogue racial, so guess it depends on how you feel about them personally.
---
Serious question why are consumables mandatory for content that is on farm? 
---
I don't have infinite gold, shouldn't the guild the save up for non farm content when it releases?
---
Cata PVP was so much fun.
---
Ice Barrage ftw 🥶😂
---
You can try /reset ui or .reset ui but I'm not sure it'll work.
---
Alternative would be a hard reset, google wow classic reset ui. Blizz has a support article on how to do it, but it will make everything "normal" and you might have to tinker with your settings and stuff. Wouldn't be an issue for me, but would be for others... really depends how much you changed.

Here's the link https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7549
---
Get out, I’m not having another phase 2 and your idea is terrible
---
If we’re going with the logic of ‘maybe the Druid is off picking flowers’ then couldn’t that also apply to the shaman? 
---
But sure, in a match where horde has a shaman and neither side has a Druid, you could argue that horde has an advantage. 
---
But then we’d need to consider one side having a rogue that can sprint-&gt;prep-&gt;sprint and run door to door faster than a shaman. 
---
Or the Paladin simply casting blessing of freedom on their flag carrier that is now faster than the slowed ghost wolf, thus giving the alliance an advantage. 
---
Alliance not leveraging their huge advantage doesn’t mean that the horde has an advantage, it just means that alliance don’t leverage theirs. Same with AV. If alliance just get on the same page then it’s easy wins. But they struggle to do so.
---
There's truly no other way
---
I bet they also tell you to stop safing when you drink a health potion.
---
&gt;*This won't repopulate the world to the state it was during phase 2, since for the first half of the week you'd be grinding to cap your honor, but for the second half of the week it'd bring back the juicy world pvp environment.*
---
This was awesome! Fun to watch, keep them coming!
---
It's also not terrible for them either.  People always forget the white damage is a significant amount of damage, and while we don't have to deal with glancing blows, we will have the innate miss to overcome.  9% is just for specials.  Going over on hit means more white damage overall.
---
Strikers is dogshit for hunters however for other reasons.
---
Low top end due to weapon speed being the largest.  Get Carapace spine or Bloodseeker and you will greatly increase your dps at the cost of +5 bows and a hit%.
---
And they get so mad oh so mad when you take ShGY
---
There is a post someone did yesterday that shows in a 20-30 min horde win you get slightly more per hour than a 5-10 min loss.
---
Lots of other people in this thread are saying you're wrong, why is your individual experience more valid than theirs? Cos that's effectively what you're arguing with them about in the rest of the thread.
---
Its not my video \^^ i just thought it was great content!
---
Some people are conditioned to only think one way.
---
It looks like tukui.
---
Can’t get mad when you’ve got 20 mins chillin in que am I right.
---
This started happening too me too 3 days ago. Every few hours just random. I updated my add-ons, so far so good. Brand new comp too.
---
I've set aside 2 hours for this run that should take 90 mins tops. Maybe the group should have just pulled the pat or not been petty about taunting an add. It's not a me problem. I just heal. Tanks and dps wanna play those petty power struggle games, they can do it while I move on.
---
Thank you- that’s what I meant- if 15 hours was enough for the upkeep and maintenance of a DPS warrior.
---
2 deathbringer is bis. But yeah, thinking he should grab the second before all other warriors is being a jerk.
---
Haha I was already very close to r7 before AV came out, but it’s an upgrade over swift walkers + devilsaur gauntlets for pvp for sure. Also the boots and gloves in T1 set are the least significant upgrades in the set, so better for me to focus on other pieces
---
It sounds miserable to me
---
Wouldn’t have leveled a Paladin thinking “It can’t be as bad as everyone says it is.” I was wrong, the 2/3 specs that interest me really are that bad.
---
If I could sacrifice all the XP on my Paladin and put it on an alt I’d definitely do it.
---
The process is automated and you can get chat banned even if you didn't say anything as long as multiple people report.
---
Yes raiding is really boring, it's the reason I quit classic. I don't regret playing the game at all because the 1-60 journey and those initial raids were an absolute blast, but it all gets really repetitive after a few runs. 
---
People will say "raiding isn't about the content, it's about the social aspect" and blah blah blah but I'd much rather interact with my friends in real life or over games we actually enjoy playing like Dota and Counter Strike. Dragging myself through 3.5 excruciatingly boring hours every week just to make menial jokes and small talk with a bunch of guild members I barely know is a hard pass for me. To each their own I guess
---
Or , you know, get your shit together and actually fight properly if you want to win.
---
I'm honestly convinced at least half of them are bots. It's incredibly frustrating being on their team.
---
They don’t though. What has he got? OEB and Onslaught Girdle? One is a stop gap weapon for other DPS and the other I guess you could call funneling.
---
edgedmasters are something you use if you must. But going daggers and using ACLG or Muggers belt is preferable by far. ACLG may be tricky to get but muggers belt can be easily farmed and is an overall good belt.
---

---
this is a great guide, explains all the features and how to activate test bars.
---
As a hunter, that's your melee attack, so you can loot straight away
---
Same, just in red color.
---
Fuck that, WPvP is awful and we all fiqured that out not long ago.
---
Recount looks like a 90's web ad popup. Details just has a cleaner look. Also has build in agro plugin.
---
You made me want to play osrs.
---
Tiny Threat plugin. Just make 2 windows. out of combat threat window will be empty and have a faded background
---
Thanks for the advice all! I chose to go for a nelf druid that eventually i will be feral and a human pally i will eventually be retadin- i know i might have trouble doing raids, but i am a retail main anyways; thanks for the help all! :)
---
This could be said about Korrak’s revenge as well

Quick question. Sometimes I double click auto-attack for whatever reason which obviously leaves my character not using auto-attack. A buddy helped me setup a macro which insured auto-attack was activated when I used it, no matter how many times I activated it. Since then I've lost the macro and was wondering if anyone could help me out? Thanks.
---
I'm not against that. Do you happen to have a link to that statement from blizzard?
---
Heroic strike is a rage dump not a skill you spam
---
Thats strange because world pvp is dead these days on my server. Plus if you world pvp you are for sure not not even close to competing with people spamming Alterac Valley. 
---
The idea would be that for the majority of the week, people would still be in battlegrounds, but once they hit the cap, they have to fight in the world to rank-up. Thats why it wouldn't be another phase 2, because AV would still largely be the meta for the majority of the week until people cap. 
---
So think of it like Tuesday through Saturday people would be in battlegrounds getting max honor, then Sunday-Monday people are in the world milking whatever honor they can to compete with others in their server.
---
Blizzard doesnt care enough to do that. How long will it take some of you to realize that
---

As a horde player, my last three AV games have all been an hour+ ontop of 40+ min queues. I'm so close to exalted but it's such a drainer lol. 
---
I've also been getting a bug where I can't respawn. No NPC's. Relogging fixes it but I don't know if I can mid BG... 
---
If you run to your corpse and respawn, you're still dead and the other players can see and target you but no one can do anything about it. 
---
I found drowning yourself fixes it but it takes so long as an Undead lol.
---
That dude's name is "kobe" hahhahahah
---
What enhancement shamans are you playing with? Every one I've raided/grouped with can't think of doing anything but blowing their whole mana pool on doing shit DPS while still somehow pulling threat early on every pull.
---
YEP! 2006 I looted my orb of deception off a tower guard. Just instantly looted it. Fuck the group loot it's not how my vanilla experience went.
---
There’s no alliance leveling or running to BRM for dungeons? Hmmm
---
literally impossible the technology just isn't there yet
---
I do it off the bridge near the alliance base. Much easier there but the fall doesn’t completely kill them at full health.
---
It can indeed proc off the OH autos. There is no global for it before it can proceed again, I’ve had 2-3 multi-attacks in a row
---
"But AV is stacked in alliance favor!!!1!"
---
Being the minority in a very high pop server would make your faction about equal to a medium pop server, no? Doesn’t seem that bad
---
Thanks for validating my point, chances shouldn't  make you pass on loot.
---
+550 healing, is rejuv rank 10 &gt; rejuv 11 for efficiency? Most druids I see use 10
---
*hides my 7 level 10 characters* what? no I don’t do alts
---
Because... it's the exact same thing..? Your rank is based entirely on how much honor everyone else got.
---
Lol who’s still farming rep, losers
---
Went human pally, wish I went orc shaman instead.
---
In order to get people to stop AFKing you need to give them a reason to be somewhere else.
---
WSG and AB don't allow for that same kind of leeching, so whatever the solution is, it should funnel people toward those Battlegrounds who want to rank up (since it will force them to play, as opposed to AFK and make the AVs even worse)
---

It's just neckbeards trying to be social, I try to have leeway for anyone that isn't obviously trolling... but you ALWAYS get that guy who's maybe had a few too many and just... won't... stop....

It can damper your fun, for sure.

Well there wasnt xserver bgs til the tbc pre patch so...
---
IceHUD
---
I tried this method now, it doesn't seem to work unfortunately. Thanks anyway!
---
MEAT WALL!!!!
---
Nah ret reckoning paladins are/were better front line fighters than warriors. You can argue if you want but it wont make you any less wrong!
---
It takes a decent amount of healers and two tanks so you can OT Marshals while dps burn drek
---
I’ve vendored HoJ 3-4 times
---
They cancel.
---
&gt; There also wasnt av premades
---
Wrong. We did that on my server a few times for fun. But we never overdid it, because we liked the other faction and often talked to them (through IRC / voice). 
---
And they said "We were in queue for 4+ hours and got steamrolled by you within minutes". 
---
And hey, those were the people we played other games (Dota, ...) with when there was not much to do in WoW. So why ruin it for them?
---
Yes there were
---
Does limited invurnability potion drop threat in Reid?
---
If I'm not mistaken, 1 Intel = 1 spell damage bonus. So you always go with the intel
---
Especially as healers, your parses and meters just don't matter that much because half the time you don't have anything to do!   
---
On the trash, it's a "who's precast the right heal at the right time" competition, and if you feel like pushing a purple parse... you just bring a million Major Mana Pots/Demonic Runes, and never stop casting Flash Heal. That's about it for the content right now. Stay out of the fire, and press the right button.
---
Undead Rogue or Undead Mage. I've always played horde but people I was planning on playing with talked me into Alliance for the first time. 
---
Figured what the heck, if I'm going to be an ally I might as well be a Paladin. I wear a dress and cast Flash of Light a lot. Anything other than pre-made WSG as far as PVP is concerned just isn't that appealing. I primarily play WoW for fun PVP stuff and I can't really do that and be effective in PVE. Kind of sucks.
---
Edit: Oh yah, forgot to mention everybody I was supposed to play with is gone. Yay.
---
Go mage.
---
That's him!! /gkick
---
EXACTLY, our band of Accuras are tank prio (3 tanks per raid) and our 3rd one dropped and was given to my brother, the 3rd tank. The other melee dps were upset but I was thrilled, now the item is open up for dps
---
Or be a druid. Garr has dropped cenarion helm every single week since 3rd week of classic. We get 4 t1 for druid at least and shard them every time
---
As a warrior, after all the lost 1v1s throughout leveling and then world pvp, it feels so damn good to get a pocket healer and enact cruel vengeance on any ally that pass by me. Especially mages.
---
I miss the old days were it took the whole raid group just to deal with the wing commanders.
---
I get more honor per hour with 20 minute wins than 6-10 minute losses. Substantially more, in fact.
---
Queue times are 20 minutes so a quick 2k loss is no good. 
---
I can get 6k honor from a good win, including kills and mark hand-in.
---
Wtf is that second one? And where’s the energy drinks?
---
Does anyone have a good BWL guide - either video or text? Trying to refresh the raid before it’s released.
---
I spend every Alterac Valley trying to cap Snowfall just because literally nobody goes there except a random Alliance that seems to capture it out of obligation. It's free real estate!
---
You say that like the silent ones are a problem
---
Warriors are one of the if not the hardest class to level to 60. At level 40 you can get Mortal Strike, which will increase your damage considerably.
---
Arms Warriors are extremely strong in group PvP, where they get help to stay alive and stay in melee range of their kill targets.
---
In 1 versus 1 fights, Warriors are weak.
---
Don’t let this demotivate you though, there is a reason why A LOT of players play Warrior. With the right gear and the right back up, Warriors turn into unstoppable juggernaughts in PvP that can destroy player after player.
---
Yeah between all the insane HoJ/Savage Gladiator stories here and all the honor grind stuff I'm pretty amazed that so many people are willing to put that kind of time into boring repetitive stuff.
---
This method did unfortunately not work for me :/ But thanks!
---
We
---
This is some quality shit! Thanks for sharing!
---
Fresh kvl 60s or alts hitting 60
---
Ooh. Good question.
---
Go mage. Hunters are mediocre after a while due to poor gear scaling where mage is king of everything at all times during in Classic
---
Improved hamstring and mortal strike are very good for pvp
---
STV and Ashenvale are definitely main ones for me, and I’ll need to go to the barrens for WC.    
---
When I’ve been leveling a few characters in Redridge I’ve come across quite a few horde twinks so assumed wPVP was a thing.
---
Mankrik is great for alliance. We’ve gotten 90% of the world boss kills on a horde majority server. It doesn’t matter here for PvE.
---
That was hilarious
---
This doesn't help, honestly. Mechanically sound healers parse in the 50 ranges OFTEN. Healers that I know for fact are way better than me.   
---
Healing especially, isn't a "log friendly" role. Sometimes you really don't have anything to do but try to precast or race the next healer for that one last top on the tank.   
---
Gaming the healing logs is stupid easy too. We check dispel logs, buffs (you can often find slackers in the buffs tab), HPS (relative to our other healers), mana pot usage and other things like that... which ARE very helpful to know. But simply going off the parse or numbers usually isn't the right way to evaluate your own performance.   
---
Ask the best healer in your guild what he/she is doing, and that'll get you onto MousoverMacros/healbot (which is honestly the best way to heal in WoW right now). When future content comes out, we'll actually have to use efficient heals and stuff (hopefully) so for now... spam that Flash Heal and pray you don't OH too much!
---
Hi, /u/Herc_the_Great

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ee9plc/how_is_the_ranking_scene_looking_right_now/). 
---
It takes five hours for ally to farm 100k honor with premades, lol
---
Where do you get all your soundeffects and 3DS Animations from if I may ask?
---
Having it group loots makes Zero sense, as you cant collect the objective drops from NPCs, for example if you were in a big turtle and wanted to get the cavalry to break through you couldnt as a player farm the wolves/ram hides to actually collect them, which is also worth 2 rep per turn in.
---
Sounds to me like the loot is very kind to your guild just not you and your shaman brothers. MT and OT both having Thunderfury, (Blessed Blade of the Windseeker) gives you two big strong legs up though progression from here on out. Especially on Horde :D
---
&gt;Hardcore guilds will be already mostly or fully geared
---
Not when every week you get a solid 1/2 of the gear as rogue, hunter, pally, and druid loot.
---
Nahh Retail bad, classic kinda meh.
---
As you can see it is a really shite pizza.
---
This is unacceptable. Unplayable. Fix your shit blizz, this game should be exactly how I played it in 2004. No QoL changes. Nothing. Not my classic. No changes squad where you at? I need confirmation that I am right. /s
---
I want “classic” wrath of the lich king honor and gearing system
---
For the love of all that is holy do something with those raid frames.
---
This was great but please for the love of god turn on class color raid frames in your settings
---
Yep I always get as many as I can, usually healers first. But trust me there are times 15 people are all trying to trade you for food and water and you literally don’t have time to get them all. It’s pretty unfair for them to be rude to me in that situation, I do what I can but I’m not a vending machine.
---
&gt;The thing is that your guild leaders were totally right.
---
You shouldnt try to make situation better for everyone and just leave? Wot
---
I bought a pristine hide for 375, decided it wasnt worth the gold in mats to make BoB, and then sold it for 400g.
---
I've seen it for higher, but normally around 400g.
---
Whitemane-Ally
---
really?  i havent won an av since day 1 of bgs coming out.
---
Use ! In front of the start auto attack command iirc. Someone else will have to explain why this works though
---
Like I said there are edge cases where nodead/dead mod will be useful. 
---
I've been using heal macros like I typed above since the start of Classic (and a while in retail as well) and haven't had any problems. All that is needed is the help mod for mouseover heal macros. 
---
There's nothing wrong with putting exist or @target in a macro. It simply inflates the already limited character count for something that's default already.
---
i love that action bar so much
---
What do you use for your video editing? I’m slowly learning about editing videos and a lot of features in this clip are things I’ve always been interested on how to do it! I know some of the basic functionalities like zooming etc but overlays onto videos is where my head explodes
---
Haha.. so true. One good plan is better than two great plans.
---
Yeah... 3 - 4 hours a day is a part time job. Maybe I should wait a few years for people to stop power grinding.
---
The only upside of the genocide that took place in the previous phase
---
We’re saying Merry Christmas again!!
---
They sure don't play to RP.  Fugly.
---
Nah alliance has some good advantages for certain comps. Hunters easily come to mind. Dorf healers, the escape artist racial for gnomes makes a huuuge difference for warriors and rogues. 
---
Paladins as a class are one of the hardest and most annoying to kill hands down.
---
is mara even good for hunters? i legit never did it on my hunter because it was so horrible. Princess is like 9 minutes of just arcane shotting then she spits out like 2g :(. I have recently picked up selling HOJ to people because speccing IMP FD each time i do tribute runs gets old.
---
Yeah exactly, obviously no one is happy about a roll, but if you publicly make a scene about it when it was one other person, it creates this weird pressure on you.
---
The Crash Twinsanity OST just hits different
---
It do be like that
---
I seriously doubt anyone’s getting rank 8 with 3-4 hours/day in the current honor climate.
---
Yeah this sub is not great
---
NO SUMMON FOR YOU
---
I don’t see how this helps. If you bump wpvp honor, the minority faction will never leave the city. You could raid the city, but then you end up with the minority transferring off. 
---
Boosting WSG is a good idea, but boosting wpvp will kill the game.
---
Yeah get a 100 mount and get on a premade server. 10 minute wins is a must.
---
I'm gonna make a wow x runescape dedicated video now
---
keep trying.
---
im not really a core raider (im pretty casual) in my guild and theres only a couple of people in it that i talk to regularly, so I didn't feel comfortable trying to talk the officers into getting a 5+ man group together to steamroll through the elites in winterspring just for me, so i asked in /g if any mage and/or lock wanted to help me farm it for an hour or 2 - all other loot was theirs to keep &amp; ill throw in some gold if it does drop - a mage was happy to help and within 40-50 minutes it dropped.
---
from all the reading ive done, it can either drop on the first kill, 4 times in 2 hours, or not at all for a couple of days.
---
its worth trying to farm. even if its 1-2 hours at a time each day.
---
ask in /g.. i wasnt expecting any offers, but 2 guildies were more than happy to.
---
A soul shard is a soul shard.
---
Tank.... for all the easy raid groups and guilds. And because I need to buckle down and learn warriors alrdy. 
---
Too many mages and rogues. I picked eogue. No regret tbh. I play hard and work harder and have a fun time ingame. But being a tank would be rly beneficial
---
Honestly one of my favourite games from my childhood, glad you recognised it :D
---
Its just the cost of 1 month of a sub. I'd recommend a pve server (player vs environment). You can still PvP (player vs player) if you want but it isnt as much of an open world gankfest.
---
Zerg means both sides just kill each other mindlessly in an endless battle. It has nothing to do with a rush. If you want to explain a rush you can just use the term rush. A turtle means one side is focusing more on defending and the other side on attacking, I didn't say that. Liuke I said its just a long lasting endless battle in the middle of the map on some gy.
---
Thats how my server always used the term.
---
It's minecraft xp :D
---
Thank you guys so much for input.  Will respec prontosaurus. Also practice more.  Get some necropile. And give lashers a rip.
---
Honestly, for these kinds of videos, it's either you're creative and you kinda just know how you want it to look *or* you watch a lot of videos that are similar and retain/reuse the things you liked.
---
Apart from that, for the more technical stuff, you can just search what you want to do or get packs that have various effects/transitions/etc. in them. For example, if you liked the transition at 2:18, you could just search on YT "sony vegas zoom transition" and follow some tutorials, like this [first result](https://youtu.be/Jt-LU4606ZQ) (haven't watched it, but the result seems to be pretty similar to the one used in OP's video).
---
I actually did, I recorded a load of games but settled on the one where I didn't change it haha
---
Mercy pocketing Reinhardt.
---
Then at the end of the week it would be like phase 2. I’m not sure if you realize this but camping flight points gives more honor than making a giant raid and finding another giant raid
---
Go combat spec and use swords. You can just spam sin strike and eviscerate and use 5% of your brain.
---
You shouldn't have that much trouble soloing. 
---
All the melee classes are harder then the ranged characters to level but its wow hard not real hard.
---
What about the other BETTER mail healer helm? Or T2? At least it’s the helmet slot that he’s missing, he’s got options!
---
You don’t need a second account. Invite anyone to form a group. Ask them to wait while you log out and log in an alt. Have the person invite that alt to group. Disband the other person. Log back on your main. After solo’ing your instance, log in with your alt. Wait approx 1.5 min to have group leader passed to you (you can’t make a group member leader while they are logged out, this is the only way). Reset the instance. Log main, you will be back at the beginning of a fresh instance. It’s not as fast as having someone else reset the instance for you every time, but it doesn’t require another account and you you can do it alone after the initial setup.
---
If you look closely, the facial features are more like an elf than a human though. It looks to me like the ears were broken off, since it is a destroyed statue after all. The hair is also pulled back but the ponytail is missing too.
---
The ear showing that we can see is kinda squared off on top which does point to my theory that they were pointy at one time but aren’t now.
---
You can jump onto a pillar with skull of impending doom or a swiftness potion, which will glitch them out and drop combat.
---
I use Vegas Pro, it's my favourite. They're greenscreens, fairly easy to use to be fair. Type in chroma key tutorial on youtube for whatever software you have and it should show you how to do it :D
---
Well who wants to RP as a Human or a Small Human, or a Tall Human?
---
This is hilarious

Gathered them overtime from various sources, video to mp3 is how I got most of them
---
Arm spec is prob one of the best for PvP because of mortal strike. Mock and cleave are pretty useless but rend is good to keep rogues from vanishing

Why is this on the wow classic subreddit... its late night lfg channel come to reddit.

aight ty
---
you're looking at the parse exclusively, logs tell so much more than that - things like bad cd timing, positioning, debuff uptime, and gcd usage are things I care about more than the percentile ranking.
---
Just bragging rights
---
Fake, his room is clean and his fridge is stocked.
---
It’s more about giving people options. Say you’re on a horde dominant server, as an alliance player, you’ll hit bad luck streaks in your games. If this happens they will go out in the world to farm honor. The reason they don’t do this now is because the honor gain is not optimal at all compared to afk queueing bgs. If it was optimal, yes, even the minority would leave their cities because they know there’s possibility it would be better honor gain than sitting afk losing bgs.
---
Gonna need a song list my guy

You're welcome man, I'm glad I could make your day better, means a lot to have you comment like this :D there's some more here on my channel if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/snackybox

Ill have to check when i get home to be sure of the order but i had the idea at like lvl 20 and it worked right away. The thing i cant get to work is those 2 with Counterattack as well.

Nah I've been doing non stop WSG it's not bad if you A)play with your team and B)are good at fighting 1v1s and 1v2s
---
Simple doesn't mean good.  Plus if everyone had the same cap, no one would ever rank.
---
Probably around 20 hours on and off, maybe a little more. Some other videos on my channel took a lot longer though
---
Fucking alliances man, a great part of them play in first person camera hahahah. (I am alliance btw)
---
What classes are your friends?
---
Good choice on rerolling Horde by the way.
---
Alright lmao thats a few people. The masses are botting HF GL
---
lmao think you're just an insecure minipeen
---
I think people are going to be sorely surprised when people go into AQ/Naxx and finish them within a couple hours of release.
---
all that matters is big brain for Vael fight
---
It never gets old when you crit 3-4 in a row and delete a clothie/hunter, or you charge in 1v3 and still get a kill. Or two rogues stunlock you but you manage to tear 50% off one rogues hp in 1.5 seconds before you die.
---
Agreed. Work on gearing and get your epic mount. I gave up on the honor grind because fuck running AV 3-4 plus hours a day for the next couple of months. Even 3-4 hours a day every day of the week will barely make it past rank 4.
---
I love when someone’s like “WOW GG YOU FUCKING IDIOTS LOST US THE GAME”
---
Then two seconds later we win.
---
Yep! Take your time. If you want your pet to take aggro from a group of mobs, give the pet time to get hit atleast once before running to your safe spot.
---
I died a couple of times because I was just too eager to run as soon as possible when my pet was charging a group of mobs.
---
Spriest level 51 here. I’m lookin to switch over to raid healing once I hit 60 but I still wanna be able to solo content effectively. Would I have to switch specs every time I wanna be out soloing or just roll with different equipment? And what equipment should I be on the lookout for?
---
"Nothing good happens after 2am" except for this videos.
---
 love it
---
What year is it? 2005?
---
weird thats exactly what i have but it doesnt work, maybe need to put mongoose first then
---
Human rogues already have 10 sword skills from their racial and talents, so the extra 4 will barely do anything for mean. Meanwhile, human warriors go from 5 to 9, which is 10% less glancing penalty damage.
---
I like OoC, but I mostly play with friends and tank so I decided to go with Imp Enrage. Helps with initial aggro so they can dps sooner.
---
Of course, if I was just strictly PvPing, I'd definitely get OoC.
---
I like that you include a lot of your deaths
---
I would suggest just playing around with Vegas and keep looking up tutorials and getting real used to the software, the biggest setback for me when I first started was not being able to translate what was in my head into the software. If I ever wanted to learn something I would type it into YouTube,  "zoom in tutorial vegas" "transition tutorial vegas" and just go through all the results. It gets to a point where you can look at an effect someone has used in a video and you can come up with lots of different ways to do it on your own. It does take time but if you have a passion for it you'll get there in no time :D
---
what am i bitching about?
---
We've got a Shaman, a Priest, one guy who's got a Warrior and a Hunter - he goes back and forth, and myself as the druid
---
I hate it. It just lacks creativity, and is used as a substitute to an argument a lot of the time. It really feels like talking to a 12-year old whenever they bust out that sad line.
---
Thanks for this - it's reduced the character count of the macro (and it looks a lot tidier) but it's still refusing to cancel my form when I mouseover a unit frame.
---
It's really odd that it doesn't work in that scenario specifically.
---
$15 a month. First thing you should know is that its going to take you 9-15 in game days to get level 60 (300ish hours), depending on your efficiency. Theres more Horde players than Alliance. Dont play on a full server. https://ironforge.pro/servers/?filter=true&amp;server=us server balance.
---
just a few tips
---
The russians went on east side directly for drek. Then we learned we hadto stop them. If we succeeded sending in some mages to interrupt the attack half of em gave up. Then we learned if we could turn the games into turtles we would win 9/10.
---
Is there an addon that allows you to see all the BGs like the image above? My UI has been a tad screwy since the last update (errors when trying to enter BGs).
---
Hmh thanks, i've acutally only played warlock before so first time melee, guess I was just used to it being easier. could also be part my weapons as theyre from like level 15, searching AH everyday for upgrades
---
Gotta keep it real
---
This is some god tier editing my dude.
---
Your greedy for thinking luck of the group should be all yours, I’m not saying I shouldn’t split it with the group, or give everyone else a fair chance. Brain dead greedy ass
---
Can't they make objective drops lootable by everyone while keeping group loot for greens+?
---
Sounds like you may as well go rogue, seeing as you felt like a budget one anyway. Or Warlock.
---
Thanks man :D &lt;3
---
Boots of shadow flame is a good alternative to chromatic boots. The leather chest can be considered (40 str). Helm of endless rage for pvp or if you don't have lionheart yet.
---
But does your gear?
---
Anything with str, agility, attack power, melee attack power, crit, or hit.
---
Also any weapons you can get bonus weapon skill with.
---
I recommend downloading AtlasLoot and just browsing through all the boss drop tables.
---
Not a default feature they'd have to code something new for it which I doubt they would do.
---
You can either buff ai or conjure water, there really isn't enough time in the gates for both.
---
Thanks bro, there's some more content like this on my YouTube channel if you're interested: https://www.youtube.com/snackybox
---
Best part about this video is the banjo-kazooie music.
---
For swords it's the dal rends set.
---
Looks like the gnomes nuked silverpine
---
Just using /startattack should be enough, any further button presses will not cancel auto-attack.
---
I'm glad you liked it mate :D
---
Mining is still a poor moneymaker. Herbalism or alchemy would be good if he makes an alt for DEing
---
Lol U don't need more add-ons... U need less. That's a default screen from clicking the BG queue
---
These are the moments I live for. Now that I’m pretty geared, the warrior dream is starting to become a reality
---
I didn't reserve them ahead of time, just checked yesterday and Mankrik was literally the only PvE server that had all three of my preferred names available. Maybe it is meant to be.
---
Av dagger and distracting dagger if you dont have muggers belt.  Use bonescraper oh if you do have a muggers belt or once you get aged corehound gloves.
---
Right now it would be a DPS increase to use Edgemaster's if either weapon has you under 305 weapon skill without them. The alternative of Flameguard Gauntlets doesn't make up for it enough. Also (and part of why Flameguard isn't better in this case), Edgemaster's isn't a completely wasted item for the mainhand, pushing 305 weapon skill into 308+ territory and changing the glancing blows on the mainhand from 85% average damage to 95% average damage.
---
However, if you don't own Edgemaster's, in your case the difference may be small enough to run devilsaur or flameguard gauntlets, just in order to save the gold until you get an offhand axe (if you're an orc). If you're not an orc, the difference will be significant if your main hand isn't at 305+ weapon skill.
---
Get *just* drunk enough that you're still able to reliably hit the frostbolt key while also not being bored out of your mind.
---
Continue to farm it. It will drop eventually. Save that gold for epic mount.
---
upvote for mad rogue style disrespect
---
Shaman is mint on doing things between que. Just set hearth to the area and recall there on 15min cd.
---
That moment when you open you empty fridge and realize you need to actually go outside for more sustenance
---
To be honest I don’t care about killing mob fast ;) or efficiently, but to not be killed by the opposite faction while doing so :) shadow seems to be just more survivable, with imp psychic scream, silence , damage reduction from shadowform, vampiric embrace. Also being in shadowform I noticed provides a psychological effect and  (dunno if it’s just a feeling) but I get attacked less often while in sf
---
Not sure what that has anything to do with it. You said massive use. Ain't no 3 spell damage or like 7 over the next best one giving you massive use. Still not bis, guild trying to start drama over it means run the hell away.
---
Whaat I normally do the one where you hop from the mountain and then do another hop.
---
I’ll have to try this one instead.
---
Didn’t know they could do that. Legit.
---
Hunter was there for kill?
---
Your gear and everything stays. Recipes learned etc. Only Honor resets.
---
Heroic strike spam for fury prot is already better tps than sunder spam...
---
Horde get WF on their MT. Off-tanks keep up sunders, MT spam heroic strike.
---
upload a video of you farming so we can give more concrete advice.
---
thats is probably the best pvp video i have seen in a long time haha well done man
---
Name checks out
---
Warlock is a strong candidate. I mained one forever, which is why I actually chose hunter first - wanted the pet mechanic but something different
---
Hugely agree, keeping Faerlina closed off is the move. The queues suck (don’t know if they’re sill a thing) but the server itself is actually in a good place. Good pop at all times, pretty good balance and active enough on both sides, a strong core. For my money streamers aren’t the world ending issue a lot of people wanted to make them out as either.
---
Instantly upvoted for the runescape reference.
---
You're* lol
---
Yep frostbolt spam, lol
---
Majority of horde games have been cap gy first on our BG now, either alliance give up or they turtle or horde are sneaky enough to ninja, or we crush them all the way. Depends on the group. either ends up 15-25mins or 40ish+ if they turtle, all usually wins. I think most horde will prefer some hks and a slow win than a fast loss due to the queue.
---
Just complete every zone and get gear from quests and dungeons. You don't really need to spend gold or go for specific stuff until you get towards lvl 50+
---
Ragnaros was never hard, not even first guildclear when people had super bad gear
---
You said it yourself-it easy gear. You can literally play AV at any time, as long as you like to suit your schedule and not worrying about finding dingeon groups, keeping up with expectations etc. Amazing melee weapons, best caster off hands available atm and if youre a hunter then you can get a quiver which is pretty much equivalent to the BiS quiver in game along with ammo thats slightly worse but much cheaper than the thorium shells/arrows.
---
The fact that its cross realm as well removes any worry that your server rep will suffer at all so thats an other prohibiting factor gone.
---
Nope, did it the same way you do DMN tribute chest basically.. loot was on FFA , reloged after to loot chest basically (entered and got summoned).. I've seen a lot of ppl do it like this already on streams and youtube..  
---
But I would get if not being there was an issue, for example me not being able to loot the item.
---
The problem turned out to be the chest not opening for anyone, including those who were there on the kill.. Just refused to open
---
Pocket healing a warlock is about the same. With life tap they are protective.
---
Our party has a dedicated priest, would you still reccomend a priest but just going shadow?
---
I'm the only dagger rogue in my guild and I'm still waiting for the dagger gloves to drop. With my luck I won't see them until aq.
---
Ok Locks sound so fun from this thread.  
---
Any suggestions for leveling specs on lock?  Just about to hit lvl 10 so time to decide.
---
The power in druids does not lie in their individual forms. It lies in their ability to adapt to the combat situation.  
---
It is a very high skill ceiling class that is very satisfying to master.  I know it feels like you don't really do all that much - you spam moonfire and wrath in balance form, claw and bite in cat form, and maul in bear form. It gets boring. I hear you man.  
---
My first toon was a druid. I played the class while there was still magic adrift in the game. It might be hard to be able to slow down and appreciate the unique playstyle that the class has to offer your second time around, while the game has basically been reverted to a science (like private servers were).  
---
Try sticking it out though. Focus on reading combat situations and seek to serve your party in the most effective way. Perhaps it's just putting some HoT on your friend to give him confidence to increase his pull sizes. Sometimes it is jumping into bear form for the middle of the fight just to be able to utilize your bear form and reduce the strain that is put on the other classes in your party, and then hopping out to clean up some low-hp mobs in cat form. Sometimes it really is just bursting down an enemy as fast as possible in cat form before the patrol gets in aggro range ( or just to keep your xp/h at a healthy rate).   
---
I also found druids to be more fun when you got into a roleplay mindset. It really helps bring the playstyle to life.  
---
Good luck man
---
I've noticed this weird mentality about DPS, with them being disposable and whatnot. This is kind of true, but it's also basically the role type that is the most needed to fill slots, while also not being as demanding on which specific class fills that slot. It's flexible in its own way (unless like REALLY trying to minmax by going heavy melee), even though it's different from like paladins and druids. I'd also say specific DPS classes get the opportunity to briefly take the spotlight at different times. E.g. Those with interrupts can help out a fair bit on Sulfuron Harbinger, warlocks with banish are quite useful on Garr and various trash mob pulls, mages shine in AoE situations and their sheeping is handy for Majordomo, ranged and caster DPS can just go all out on Ragnaros and so on. Hunter is one of the less flexible DPS options but even then they're handy for Magmadar and may be useful for kiting for Majordomo as well. The way we've been doing Onyxia, we split DPS to have melee focus whelps on the start of phase 2 while ranged and casters focus Onyxia.
---
Thanks man, I have a couple other pvp edits with this sort of style here: https://www.youtube.com/snackybox
---
Vid is hilarious with dank memes but no demon armor = no dank meme
---
Tailors have that frost increase gear- doesn’t seem like a bad idea to me lol
---
Not if you're a caster :(
---
AoE scales very poorly with spell damage, for AoE you want a another gear set that is just all green of the eagle gear. You will need a lot more mana and health than your prebis gives you so the gear is the biggest thing. The only talent you want to avoid is frostbite because it randomly freezes some while keeping others unfrozen so they separate and make it hard to control.

Gz

Dat 1 button rotation. “King”
---
I had once a trip on opiods that was less entertaining then this 😂😂
---
Men dont have throw pillows on their beds either, thats a chick thing.
---
Why I chose mage? Because no other class can make gold like they do and I love gold. You have so many different options to make gold with, it never gets old.
---
PvP is so fun when it’s fun. The problem is it’s very rarely fun now. No one takes a fair fight, most people just avoid PvP because it’s inefficient unless they’ve got the odds totally in their favor.
---
Random encounters don’t feel like clashes with the enemy for territory, they feel like a much higher level player was bored and wanted to one tap you or a group of gankers caught you alone.
---
Not to mention it always seems to be kill on sight, regardless of the circumstances.
---
A
---
Roll a mage. Every group needs one and they’re a ton of fun. Being able to port to major cities is a definite plus and a time saver.
---
I've installed a UV lamp next to my desktop so I live on photosynthesis. It hasn't worked so far but I'm not giving up.

---
Hey they say it don’t work like dm :&lt;
---
Glad to see it was resolved with no drama really.
---
How much world pvp have you done since BGs came out?
---
Not to mention, free food and drinks and you’ll DPS higher than most people 4 levels higher than you.
---
Haha, I was looking for the YouTube channel the other day but had forgotten the name, these are awesome dude!
---
Probably Rhonin, he did travel back in time with Krasus.
---
My biggest mistake in battlegrounds is rebuffing myself after I die haha
---
I would get that if the chest didnt crap out.. cuz noone managed to loot/open it, even those there on the kill
---
I haven't seen it higher than 18 mins queues, what time are you playing?
---
How much time did you spend editing this video? All night?
---
I don't take screenshots since it's the norm.
---
But just so some maths. 7-9 min games. 3.3k honor per. Rush galv, pull dardosh, Phillips and other commanders lieutenants to the graveyard near forrest. Do frostwolf graveyard. Pull out all warmasters with one tank and 2 healers, then rush drek.
---
We regularly hit 25k an hour over long periods of time. Although today we're were only at 19k, had so many terrible horde turtle games. That's without marks.
---
Ayyye that was my situation! Only opposite :P I mained a hunter in BC and for a good while of classic, but it was missing the spell casting aspect I was itching for, which led me to lock!
---
Snackybox's the name, memings my game 😎 Thank you mate :D Hope you have a good Christmas
---
If you tried to loot the chest with your hunter. My only explanation is you tried to loot a „corpse boss whatever“ without being able to do it - hard do explain but I guess u know what I mean and then it bugged out
---
People use it during weekly maintenance.
---
Because hunters need to be even better at grabbing all of the loot.
---
I'm currently using t2 but the "plan" was funnel me t1 first for 8pc and pass up off set stuff to others. Now all of us are 7/8 waiting on helms but 1 other shaman has all the best non t1 gear too.
---
Topping meters in any sense can sometimes have negative consequences. Actually being successful I'd say has more to do with increasing the threat ceiling for those tanks who can, and then not overdoing it for those DPS that can get close to that ceiling. IMO like for Onyxia the main thing that causes problems is chaotic threat management, it is not having DPS that's too weak. Also outside of raids going balls to the wall AoE in dungeons is a thing that sometimes works and sometimes can go horribly wrong compared to more slowly letting threat build.
---
Such is the nature of English, if enough people use something incorrectly it becomes correct.

Doesn't matter if people on this sub downvote me, just shows them ignorant to fact.
---
The time stamp for the content unlock for battlegrounds is already in Blizzard’s post that you so kindly linked.  In your reading of their post, they will share the time in early December when they will release the content that they just shared four sentences before? It’s clear that they were intending to announce in early December when the rest of Phase 3 was coming, but that hasn’t happened yet (even though early December has passed).
---
If I am not wrong best armir shoulders drop of ZF.
---
I start them and then I spread it across a few days :D probably around 20 hours
---
I benched my warrior for my hunter. Scatter aimed multi deletion is real. Really miss 2hand warrior in pvp though :-(
---
Do it.
---
This is true. My only problem is I despise frost spec - the whole point of classic of course is the choice, but from my experience every mage and their grandma is a frost mage
---
Mage. All of the money, and all of Azeroth is 2 FPs away with no boats.
---
EAT STAFF YOU SONOFABITCH
---
In in real life? Nephew..
---
top guilds on my realm have gone to herod or whitemane for larger ranking pools
---
as a Horde player, I've won the vast majority of my games. So i dunno wtf you're doing but..
---
Thanks all!
---
Reminds me of verycoolguy's videos
---
Chances shouldn't make you pass on loot. Being a green geared 58 who can only contribute maybe half of what most 60s in your raid can contribute should make you pass on loot.
---
You posted the exact same image under two different accounts.
---
That barrage fx gives so much nostalgia omg
---
Lol! Thats hilarious that you and I had the exact same mindset from opposite sides. Of the two, which do you prefer? Now that you've played them both
---
Their flavor in classic makes them a perfect fit for the Horde lorewise though. The unifying factor of the Horde is that they all handed together for survival against a hostile world that would see them destroyed. They need each other and that’s why they’re allies. The Forsaken have no allegiance to the Horde, they just need them to survive. Likewise the Horde needs the Forsaken to bolster their numbers, not to mention the Undercity, built under the ruins of Lordaeron in the Northern Eastern Kingdoms is a massively important city to have under their flag.
---
No one is hunting the Goblins and their mercantile skills have made them a powerful independent that neither side could afford to wage war with. Without the Horde the Forsaken would hardly exist and certainly be too busy trying to survive to do anything interesting.
---
Shit, I didnt realize my IP was public on reddit.
---
Also, that wasn't me.
---
Nice! How did it go?
---
Ahh so I won the argument, haha greedy ass entitled child. Obv someone was never told no
---
I played a lot of "WoW killers" back in the day and I enjoyed many of them so I dont think the industry failed but rather that Blizz take competiion seriously and move to crush it quickly.
---
For example, when it was a subscription game, RIFT was a far better game than WoW especially the PvE content where raid bosses were far more challenging at a time when WoW raids were still pretty average. But WoW moved into providing mythic content and more challenging encounters and RIFT went to a free model and that was the end of that uprising.
---
60% of the time it works...every time
---
It might happen. I say this because people have been farming Naxx/AQ40 for years on private servers. Highly unlikely as you will still get to certain bosses that are dps/heal/gear checks.
---
Well yes, Cata ruined the original world. But this is more about the overall concepts that make Classic good to begin with and how they were failed to be adopted over the years. 
---
Even if Cata didnt literally destroy Azeroth, the playerbase was already split by bc and wrath as well as diluted with dungeon finder and flying mounts etc.
---
&gt;Aim for 10k armor for dungeon spamming,
---
Is that even possible? I am missing just 3 bis items and I am standing just above 8k armor.
---
My problem is I despise frost spec, lol. It seems the either go that or get chewed out
---
Can you do that without being frost? I really don't like frost mage
---
I have 5 kids and think going 3 days is outrageous bullshit lol
---
Witcher on netflix came out just the right time.
---
I said first logged raid, not first raid. Unless october 2nd was his first ever raid and he still somehow got 65ilvl which I find hard to believe.
---
Shut up bird.
---
Yeah my friend brings his healer buddy along and he finds a mage to join them both in arena farm runs. Over 100 runs in and no luck. He has seen the orc maybe twice. He threw anger in for me when he saw how desperately i was running brd daily. So eventually I got hoj and now I just come and merc everything in the way of his sgc. Cause adding hoj is a pain, kind of out of the way even though the trash between isn't huge. It's just annoying to add when u know u can go do arena and be fine. But he helped me out and now I'm just praying he gets sgc also. I'll run til he does.
---
Honestly I miss Runescape so much, always include it in my wow videos :D
---
Private servers undertuned dungeon XP heavily. This was a big discussion at the Classic beta because people thought dungeon XP was overturned, but Blizz confirmed that dungeon XP was insanely high.
---
This is why people were spellcleaving their way to 60 very quickly. Dungeon XP is much higher in Classic than it is on pservers.
---
This is why I say that everyone talking shit is just relying on outdated YouTube guides.
---
What guilds?
---
Also transfering to a bigger server is usually the opposite of what you want for easy ranking.
---
Ranking 101: You want a high population of casual players to serious players. That means decently many players for a good amount of bracket slots, and few actual rankers to compete with for those spots. Going for the big and baddest servers often brings WAY higher ratios of competition in return for few bracket slots. The random no name med pop servers is where its at.
---
That makes no sense.
---
Non human rogues should absolutely be getting Maladath over human warriors though
---
Mad
---
Keep farming. I went to winterspring yday killed 2 blue drakes and got my sinew. They are 300-400g on my server.
---
Ah ok. I saw our hunters didn't have their pets out on rag and I wondered why. Can just call em back on wrath and send them back in.

Thank you for you input here. I'm going to keep the druid of course, he will get there eventually - its just difficult coming from the rigidity of a hunter's role to the fluidity of the druid - no set class role, do a ton of things, but theres sooooo much. It kind of feels like every situation is trying to play 3D chess, but I don't feel like I excel at any of the situations - Im just kind of there. Does that make sense?
---
I love that you included the guy screaming at his cats. I remember crying laughing at that video when YouTube first started.

4 bracket 14 spots it’s sort of a lot. More people gonna be getting rank 14 than I thought. Imagine doing that shit with one bracket 14 spot lmao.

Simple answer is no, unfortunately.

I believe you were also top of charts during the world pvp phase. It's a great solo pvp class. My gripe with rogues is that they are such a 1 trick pony and so focused on staying in stealth for an opener that they will watch their whole team wipe in AV without lending a hand because they couldnt get an opener. It's fucking hilarious to find some dipshit rogue in stealth after we have just steamrolled his team. Talking about the average rogue here, no doubt good rogues would not act like this and actually sacrifice to help the team.
---
&gt;and the only one who can kill you while leveling is another priest with more mana
---
I've killed priests leveling as a fury warrior. A class having a good pvp toolkit doesn't mean they're suddenly gods

Hey, the blizzard post I linked was the one from "early December". The one without the timestamp is this one:  [https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-unlocking-in-december/106144](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-unlocking-in-december/106144)
---
There is no time stamp in the later one, only a date ;)
---
So no, they were not intending to announce the rest of phase 3 in early December, only the beginning...actually only the exact time of the beginning.
---
My experience is more like 3k honor in 10-12 minutes with instant queues
---
It is very satisfying saving a group wipe by using NS, Battle Rez, and/or Innervate.
---
Yikes! You ok?
---
You also don’t need to be shadow. I farm it in holy spec, it’s easy just kiting princess
---
pls respond
---
If time and gear was no issue, which Melee class is best and most fun for: PVP (open world) and PVP BG? Why?
---
Tbh at this point 16 lol
---
And thus pretty much guaranteeing a horde win.
---
The issue with your mindset is that if everyone had that same attitude you would be in six hour MCs wiping on domo because everyone is in green gear and you're not a top end guild.
---
teleport.
---
free food and water.
---
If I don’t care to be a min maxer as a warrior do I really need to learn/use macros in PvP? To be fair I haven’t ever tried using one but they look pretty involved...
---
Account locked.  You can have both an Alliance account and a Horde account on the same bnet &amp; server.
---
I'm? Or is it my fault that all the butthurt people here take my first opinion so close to heart?
---
I don't like frost spec at all, like completely despise it. Thats the only problem with me being a mage
---
Lol keep going
---
probably a mage, aoe and farm gold faster
---
I rolled lock first, for the same reason, but mages are just op at farming
---
quick question,  how hard was it getting geared to an acceptable level? do you have to raid? or can you get most of your gear an easier way? levelling a warrior and I'm still undecided if it's worth going all the way
---
I farm Mara in between ques. I literally cannot check the list.
---
Wow that’s crazy. Of shaman PvP gear wasn’t itemized so whacky I might actually grind again.
---
My guild has seen everything almost except bindings and eye from rag
---
D. All of the above 
---
Practice and get better. Find out if you’re better at CoC + Flamestrike or straight Blizzard. You will did a lot die a lot of times. Those YouTube videos are the result of tons of practice and they’ll obviously not include any of their deaths. It’s basically a mage right of passage that you will die many times before you get your runs clean. 
---
Get int + Stam gear. Just do it. Blizzard doesn’t scale well with spell damage so most pre raid BiS isn’t going to be very helpful. You will notice the difference 
---
And yes, respec. Often times the difference between life and death will be a sliver of health and you will need every advantage you can get
---
Well I’ve never really raided with either, but I can speak on leveling lol. I loved playing my hunter because at the time, I was a very non social gamer (still hardly talk lmao) so knowing I had back up in the form a pet was always nice. I also loved the fact that you had to actively go out into the world and find beasts with certain moves and that it wasn’t 100% from a trainer. That being said, as I got to be a little more social and willing to work with others, I saw the true fun of being a lock! Having a healer available so I can life tap away or hellfire mobs with out a care! All in all I’d have to say, lock is my favorite for leveling but I use my hunter (39 right now) for mainly pvp, so I still get on that guys every now and then and have a blast!
---
Yeah I guess, imp enrage is definitely helpful earlier in pulls.  YOu can also just shift into bear + pop enrage about 5 seconds before pull, then you still start the pull with like 25-30 rage then add on your initial melee swing.  Can easily swipe twice, then start mauling
---
nope, ain't no one buying healthstones on if bridge for gold
---
As always, you make me laugh simply through editing.
---
Fantastic work ma man.
---
No. Hard to gear all things considered especially compared to healer priests, you'll need gear every caster DPS needs. Mana management is pretty cruel. High skill ceiling in PvP and the benefits you bring to the table when it comes to raid can be provided by Shadow Weaving Discipline priests. An advanced, fun way to play but wouldn't recommend to new priests.
---
Also I’d add that the PVP set will give you decent Stam/int if you don’t want to farm Scholo
---
90% of the gear im getting in MC i only use in PvP, meanwhile i just grinded to exalted AV for an offhand .. that i'll only use in PvE

I've seen quite a few guilds with a core that includes IRL friends, as well as subsets of other members that are friends as well. That disconnect you feel may be due to a lack of feeling all that close to anyone for whatever reason. Which I get, it can happen and it can even if you try to make new online friends. I was a bit dismayed by the sheer number of pretty friendly encounters I had with people and then never seeing most of them again.
---
It was a fine raid but doing it 4x every week was brutal.
---
Thats what she said
---
I second this. Random low lvl warlock in way with crazy editing, OOF. Then I couldn't stop watching, you got some kinda magic touch man 👌
---
The horde anti-premade meta usually is either: (1) everyone wipe alliance, rush vann or (2) rush objectives then vann. The horde usually get a fast game against an alliance premade.
---
Most guilds wont crush the content. The top guilds will but 99% of people wont.
---
Make your friend leave the party. Tag monster first and than let him kill it.  You get 100% of the experience with 0 draw back.  All your friend need to do is wait for you to get the first hit and once the monster appear as grey for him than he can proceed to attack
---
See my username to understand why
---
You scream, you run, you scream some more, you hit things hard. And when you pull too much you die a lil' bit slower than others so you get to think about how much you hate non-green quests. Guess the class.
---
In a perfect world you use the best items, yes. But if your Rogues still need the gloves, or youre DKP spent and can't bid on them, you make due with the belt. 2 weapon skill is effectively nothing.
---
but why did you screenshot this instead of reposting the original image?
---
Who's that? Love me some premade WSG streams
---
Cod zombies, its Tank Dempsy :)
---
And i am still trying to reach 60...
---
So I’m not sure of the exact calculation used but the xp you get is something like the average of the xp someone would get by themselves divided over the number of people in the group. 
---
For example if a level 60 carries a level 14 through deadmines the level 60 would usually get 0xp and per kill and the level 14 would get roughly 100 Xp per kill so the level 60 still gets 0 Xp and the level 14 gets about 50 per kill.
---
On the other hand if a group of very efficient level 14s were to clear deadmines they would all get on average 100 Xp per kill so each of them gets 100 xp
---
This means that if you are getting carried by a higher level character it is better to be in a full group of people around your level because it will reduce the XP by less than if it was just you and your high level mate.
---
In the open world it’s not really worth it to get carried because it would be faster to kill the mobs yourself (or with a group your own level). Getting run through dungeons can still be effective though because the mobs are elites (so they provide more Xp), there is a finite number of them so you don’t have to wait for respawns, and some high level characters can clear a low level dungeon very quickly (looking at you mages).
---
Yes because getting the PvP set is easier than farming scholo...........
---
It's threads like these that make me read and realize. Yeah i have learned alot in the last 4 months but I fucking know nothing in the wow universe still lol. I'm glad I'm a new player seeing everything for the first time though.
---
I feel for you, but I also have to admit I laughed at the juxtaposition of "best horde raiding guild" and "feels a bit elitist". I really don't know what you expected. Hardcore players can come off as seeming elitist even if they don't mean to, and the topend probably moreso than ever whether it's active or just unspoken expectations.
---
Excellent thanks so much.
---
Thank you, I've got some good stuff planned for the new year :)

I found this, looks pretty good

Can confirm have been ganking people in that spot since day one.
---
Link me it I wanna see it :D
---
Eye of shadow drop from Felguard and Succubus but not Felhunter... Drop rate is around 4% wich mean 25 kills  should get you an eye ... My guild farm that spot and get 2-3 eye per evening
---
Mages are a joke as a Warlock all you need to do is keep curse of tongues up and bait spell lock with searing pain. That 2k shield helps against casters too.
---
20 minute queue time and idiots on horde are still letting alliance zerg for a quick win?  
---
Horde that want to win need to start resetting Vann on games shorter than 20-30 minutes. The idiots need to learn to stop trying to rush for that one zerg win in 20 games.
---
At least you didn't lose the roll to a feral druid.
---
Who needs a toilet when you have a toilet built in your gaming chair amirite?
---
Based on what, is your whole guild in bracket 14? If not then you arent getting it either
---
People kept telling him to take a screenshot
---
P1: Every once in a while she uses a skill on the tank which reduces aggro by some % (20 or so). This fucks up threat meters I think.
---
P2: She casts fireball on the target with highest threat. Unless resisted this resets the targets aggro to zero. This definitely fucks up add-ons.
---
P3: Same as P1
---
Aggro in general doesn't reset between phases.
---
Does that help?
---
\*best  
---
God I miss the days of the SFGY rush and the fight just for that single GY that could take an hour.
---
The trick is to start doing downers. You’ll be nodding off on your keyboard in no time. 
---
In all seriousness. Don’t do that. Addiction isn’t fun. Unless it’s classic wow.
---
And that’s why no one likes rogues
---
Honestly world buffs that are relatively easy to get (e.g. just being on time for an Onyxia head buff, running through a tribute run after it's already been cleared) are quite nice if you can spare the preparation time. On raids where we were able to maintain buffs for a long stretch, things definitely were easier and smoother for everyone. And then we had raids were some accidental wipe cleared a lot of buffs, and then things were slower going with some people having to adjust on the fly for atypical kill times. Like we've managed to kill Ragnaros and Onyxia essentially running on fumes in terms of already being balls deep into a raid and burning through supplies and patience, but I wouldn't say that was exactly "fun", much moreso just relieving that we were able to hold it together.
---
Lmao falling for grizzly bait, they've said this on every server
---
good.. force the turtle.
---
”Take off prayer wtf” was in osrs letters
---
I'll go find it in when I'm free.
---
&gt; rogue gear that they don’t want.
---
Doesn't happen. There are like 9755674564 rogues on our server and they all want gear. So there's approx. 100 rogues for every gear piece that drops
---
If youre actually struggling then nothing I said apply.
---
I guess it may be situational depending on the guild but is it generally acceptable to be shadow spec and try to be a raid healer?
---
Yeah how would you tell if they are small, or far away?
---
🦀JMODS WON’T RESPOND TO THIS THREAD 🦀
---
🦀🦀$15🦀🦀
---
That’s not how the drop chances work..
---
If you're not spending gold on upgrades - then what are you spending it on? Selling it to RMTers?
---
Where are those rankings at?
---
turtles win, people ignoring it are the cancer
---
You get xp based on the damage you do lol
---
The more UV radiation the higher chance of evolution!
---
Hate to break it to you but larger ranking pools on bigger realms mean more competition for ranking. If anything people are transferring to small realms to rank. Also big realms like you named are locked for transfers, unless you are transferring off.
---
Also I wouldn’t consider grizzly anything close to a top guild.
---
I had the same problem as you have.
---
I have only aoe farm since lv 35 till lv60, but when i started doing ZF runs for gold i keept dieying and getting omm everytime, couldnt do a decent run. What helped me alot was buying int/stam gear, spent 30g +\- on it. Id say if you have above 6k mana is enough.
---
Now a days my ZF runs are smooth, i die once in a while but nothing compared to before.
---
Might die once or twice in 10zf runs.
---
Tanking means your mistakes are both more visible and higher impact.
---
For some that's scary for others less so.
---
Could you please give us a source?
---
PVP gear is absolutely not necessary to do good damage in raids. Don't do PVP unless you want to, go for the more easily obtainable pieces
---
https://shadowpanther.net/leveling.htm
---
We're LC. If I was in a guild that gave the +dagger gloves to a druid I would gquit asap.
---
Hmm does that not work for the wands autoattack? I probably shoulda been a little more specific, didnt think there would be a difference tho
---
Both have the “we will share ‘time stamp’”and the BG release date... did you read the posts?
---
Omg, thank you. I'm doing this. Me and all my irl friends dread leaving our own discord to go into raid chat just to be silent or not heard over 20 other people.
---
Absolutely take Imp Blizz all 3 points. Combined with the Permafrost talent, that takes the slow from 60% to 75%, and the effect is NOTICABLE. With 3 points in you'll get off 2 full Blizzards before they reach you, and your Ice Nova will be off CD by then. With only 2 points, mobs will reach you before your Ice nova is ready or your second Blizzard has finished channeling.
---
We did this a few times the first weeks of Classic, and it really didn't work. People would pop LIP, and once the effect runs out they regain threat and wipe the raid. So what we did for a few weeks was for them to pop LIP and then move north, so at least when it wears out it only kills the player and not the raid. But this, again, requires communication, so we're back at square one ;)
---
Until Cata it was pretty grey which kinda changed in MOP and in BFA horde are straight up evil bar a select few, its horrible writing
---
Each boss only drops 2-4 items and there's 40 raiders. On top of that, the items you need might not drop at all. Not everyone will get a piece of loot every week, that's how classic works. His attitude is more suited for retail with their personal loot and bonus rolls tbh.
---
They would then have to recode items to drop for non quest havers.
---
If it requires them revamping code it's not going to happen. They won't spend the money honestly.
---
It's RNG so you could get 2 eye in a row or spend alot of time without getting any... but statistically speaking you should get an average of 1 eye for 25 kills and that's why the drop rate is 4%.
---
**Why?**
---
You have now said three times in a row the same thing without providing a single piece of logic as to why it would be the case.
---
Being in charge means you gotta wield both the carrot and the stick, and this dude sounds like he needs to feel the stick.
---
It's like training a dog really (Yes, i compare loot goblin rehab to dog training, sue me).
---
So instead only a couple people should be eligible despite how many people contributed? How is that better?
---
Had a match yesterday with some tauren warrior that just did not know the meaning of "get back" Holy hell he was a monster, it was beautiful. Just one of those slugfests of a match that took a little over an hour
---
Still lost, salty as hell over that but good god watching him charge into half the allies with everyone at his back was beautiful, dude stayed alive a whole hell of a lot longer than he should have, got some good honor that round healing that beast
---
was female, wore leather (light armor) to avoid arcane spell failure chance, ended up in going mystic theurge. I mean...
---
Well most people got exalted in week one.  Also Mage BiS arguably legs and boots are PvP 7-8, which is attainable.
---
Sure glad im not playing this shit anymore
---
As a feral tank if you have a ferap tank in the raid ill let you get these first over my dead furry butt
---
No u dont lmao

---
You and me both, that last AV was the worst of themall
---
vael is overrated iirc if you kill rag before he submerge (which is like 99% of the guilds) you got enough dps. Not counting vael buffs
---
Yes but it gets divided between ur party members so remeber even if ur getting a free run take 2 mins before and shoot a message to trade asking if any1 wants to come. The more people in the group at ur lvl the better xp u get.
---
Well you wrote nerf honor in AV I wrote no just l2p and it will be fine, so yeah it was on topic. Didnt see a problem here at all :)
---
I actually have both at 60. Hunter is crazy powerful at the end of MC and maybe BWL, and mad fun to play in the current phase.   
---
Mage loot is extremely hard to get, but money just pours in even if you are afk, especially with the current phase and most mages sitting in AV.
---
Lol this is now.  Queues are 20 min today, I myself have been salty at several people doing dumbshit like 20 on D and 10 people working to summon Icelord.  If the queue + game takes 1.5 hours it’s such shitty honor per hour.
---
The downside is you'll have a harder time finding groups than if you go Alliance on Pagle or Horde on Mankrik(assuming you want a USEast server). But that said both of these servers are pretty damn big so the minority faction will still have a LOT of people. I play Alliance on Pagle and see Horde allllll the time.
---
I played horde on an alliance dominant faction in vanilla and still found groups for dungeons and ended up raiding up to about the half way point in naxx. The fact that classic servers have 10x the people bodes well for you.
---
Do GMs take action against people who get reported for fishing the whole time?
---
This mostly
---
Also only get honor for 4 kills, that’s real quick GY farming, so anything besides rush LTs and Vann ends up being counterproductive.
---
Edgy. 🙄
---
Ive done mc 7 weeks in a row only hav 3 piece t1 and finkles, never seen legs shoulders or chest even drop yet
---
&gt;meta
---
You mean snowball stacking that will end in a few weeks?
---
No I mean shgy
---
Unless you're full premade 100% of the time you are NOT getting anywhere close to 20k per hour. Normal person playing 3 hours a night will average less than 10k honor per hour.
---
1) average joe pvper isn't ever going to get 20k honor an hour. The most extreme r14 alliance pushers in the world don't even regularly eclipse 20k per hour.
---
2) I literally said **in the current honor climate**. Of course in the future it will die down, but right now isn't the future.
---
So they'd be back to server imbalanced farming?  This doesn't seem like all that great of an idea.
---
I think I'd have started with a Mage. I'd still roll Druid as a main, but whew boy, making gold as a Druid is not very hot. My best option is to split gold with two other people doing Dire Maul Tribute runs, getting Tarnished Elven Rings every now and again and selling them for like, 60g. There's so many better AoE farms that I could do solo at any hour of the day, but Druids don't have any AoE.
---
Still, I'm slowly levelling my Mage now, and hopefully it'll payoff once I hit 60 on it.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuTshid9m6E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuTshid9m6E) 
---
Can you explain me why he get 600+ unrested exp after doing litteraly 1 damage on certain mobs ?
---
For me its always need before greed.
---
If the mage use it then i would let them have it. This goes for all drops, even the ones worth 1k+
---
I might be wrong but just by the way you've written the post I get the impression you're only now starting to AOE in general, not just soloing instances. 
---
In that case it will be a bit rough, since you have no practice on it. Especially with elites in dungeons where the margin of error is much smaller.
---
D. is the answer in that case. You need a certain spec, specialized gear (prebis is garbage for it) and finally to learn how to do it. 
---
I would suggest practicing on regular mobs first just to get the method down, then moving on to ZF/BRD.
---
Spots in Western Plaguelands should be good practice considering you're 60.
---
Currently unemployed, can’t play WoW for long durations - feel like I need to go out searching for work..
---
Even though I was in the perfect position to go for it R14 is a commitment to staying unemployed and that is the last thing I want right now.
---
Yeah not plying first weekend is unfort a huge mistake.  I hit exalted and more rep than I could hit in a week, in 4 days.  When WSG rewards are released I imagine will be the same.
---
When?
---
I agree with everything you just said. High PvP rank only means that you play AV for 16 hours a day. Period. It's stupid AF.
---
Only during this holiday
---
A tank dungeon grinding still isnt faster than a hunter at leveling. Idk why you’re even trying to argue this, look at the server first 60s on classic. All of them were mages or hunters, none of them were warrior.
---
If a warrior who was dungeon grinding and a hunter both had a speed race from level 1 to 60, the warrior would get left in the dust. It wouldnt even be close.
---
oO
---
ok
---
I'm in this guild and they left for a new guild after the raid without any drama. Guy was really nice and probably didn't want to invest in a guild where they might have to deal with this in BWL.
---
They also said raid times didn't work for them before the raid, it's really just OP making drama over nothing now; not to mention this story doesn't actually tell what happened but I won't make this more of an issue than it is for OP.
---
Most importantly try to remember it's just a game folks.
---
Looks like an elf to me
---
some guilds have had countless eyes drop since they started mc. most guilds would gather up 10 people to farm it for the core raiding priests, and then the raid2 priests, but when the eye starts going to casual members / non raiders, the motivations just not there i spose. theres always a few willing to help, but not the 10 man wrecking squad like before.
---
Have you considered seeking professional aid for your anger issues?
---
It will be okay man it’s just a game maybe you need to take a break my man.
---
This will be deleted soon...
---
...you forgot a flair.
---
How are people still not downing rag? Its not that hard a fight. Proper melee call in and call out makes the fight easy and mindless
---
Do people actually get reported for non-participation? ....someone I know.... fishes basically from 9-5 while at work and has never been afked out
---
There it is
---
If you fall to your death in a bg, you do. It happened to my warlock.
---
I love my warlock. Tons of group utility, one of the best pvp classes, one of the best farming classes, very fast levelers, high raiding demand, comparable DPS, free mount. The only downside in my opinion is having to roll against all the mages.
---
You’ll be oom pretty fast as Arcane Missiles cost a lot of mana
---
Lmao. This is the best sell ever
---
Well, I mean, Onyxia is a mob. Just has a 5-day respawn timer.
---
This is basically what I do when pugging BGs as a priest. Find the most geared warrior and follow them around as they fuck shit up.
---
Plus, h/h doesn't really matter because it's relative to how much the rest of the people on your faction+server are doing.  It's all about time invested, not h/h.
---
Don't you only get the bonus honor if you stay till the end?
---
Where does this idea of needing a fast offhand come from? Genuinely curious. We're not likes rogues where they want more poison applications. And afaik, the amount of rage you get scales with weapon speed so it doesn't matter whether your offhand is fast or slow, it should scale exactly the same.
---
My point still stands. If you aim to do high dps you're gonna bring consumables and world buffs and do all you can. This is just about shifting focus from "more gear = more dps" to "preparing better = more dps"
---
&gt; ...anyone who has all day to play and nothing else going on in their life can reach rank 14 regardless of how talented they are at pvp and have access to the best gear/weapons in the game.
---
IMO, that's the point of an MMORPG.  You can sink as much time in to it as you like.  It's the ultimate kind of game to always be able to go back to and make some progress towards whatever goal you set for yourself.
---
If I want true competitive PvP, there are plenty of better options for it than an MMO.
---
I'm not surprised you express feeling that hunters are rigid, but I'm disappointed if you didn't get to experience moments where they shine. I feel like hunters can be excellent for picking up slack in certain situations (especially in dungeons) either in the absence of certain classes or if present classes aren't doing the best that they could. In dungeon situations pets rarely can tank similar level mobs for prolonged periods of time, but they just might be able to distract an individual mob or pack that'd otherwise make life much harder for the team while you burn down your current targets. Hunters in general are also pretty good at nailing runners, for instance by way of slowing them at a distance with concussive shot or lining up an aimed shot to try to burst them just before they start to run. Hunters unfortunately don't have a lot in the way of interrupts, but a well-timed scatter shot might block an enemy heal or other nasty spell in a pinch. Traps are tricky to use, but explosive traps can help with AoE damage and frost traps can help with AoE slows if something like blizzard from mages is otherwise not available. A druid actually taught me about this exact utility and I was surprised by how effective it was in niche situations when normally I wasn't a big fan of frost traps. The hunter toolkit can feel kind of limited solo or in raids, but I've had tons of fun being a "cleaner" of sorts in dungeons. One of my favorite things about hunters is actually the passive thing of tracking, as it can help you be a spotter for bosses, named NPCs, patrols, and so on.
---
At least in the earlier vanilla patches you had to play WSG/AB to rank up and not just hang out in AV's all day. 
---
You'd bet that most high ranks were actually okay at pvp because you had to engage in lots of it to get there.
---
First things first, accept that you’re gonna die a lot in the process of learning. I died so much when I was learning, I raged pretty hard. But if you keep practicing you will get to the point where you can do it while watching Netflix and not even paying attention. EZ 40-60g an hour once you get down to 12-13 min runs. 
---
Second, start building an AoE gear set. Your spellpower set for dungeons/raiding will suck
---
for AoE. You want as much intellect and stamina as possible, spellpower and crit mean very little for your AoE spells. High intellect is super important. Magisters gear is really great for this, I believe you get it from Scholomance.
---
I love these videos. Always more than once.
---
It never happened to me while leveling or pvping in open world but now in BGs sometimes a healer picks me and just follows me around. Tbh it’s an honor. Like you said, it’s like they chose me as the strongest warrior around. Almost like some sort of mating ritual lol. 
---
Sometimes I find one when I spam my heal me macro. Love a good healer
---

Thank you for leaving a comment, I was starting to feel like I was alone in thinking this.

You can do quests every game for rep?!

Usually no.  You can pug out of spec but within a guild it’s usually not accepted.  We have some that respec every reset.

You’re going to be hard pressed to find a raid spot for aq without any mc/bwl gear as a mage. So many insane pieces come from those raids.

Mocking blow taunts hunter pets to attack you. Also if mages try to sheep you for example,  mocking blow or shoot a mob. It will hit u and break sheep. Cleave is good in aoe fights obviously, but also can work wonders with SS up. Rend rogues first global.
---
I guess that's where we disagree, in every other WoW expansion except vanilla (not sure about the most recent ones BFA, legion, WoD, I quit after MoP) the arena PvP system awarded the skillful/talented rather than the 16 hours a day grinder.
---
Just respec frost for mc/bwl and then respec to fire for the rest of the week. The fire/frost spec can aoe grind or you can easily do fire for pvp.
---
Not OP but thus far I prefer warlock at the moment, despite being a modestly decked out 60 hunter but a still leveling warlock. So many potential annoyances with hunter are smoothed out as warlock.
---
- On hunter you have to visit a stable master to switch out pets. And you can only have three and really only two until level 60. A warlock carries all possible demon pets with them at all times and just needs to summon as appropriate.
---
- On hunter you need to level your pets separately from you, and this becomes a real pain if you have any interest in a rare. Too low of a level and it might as well be as if you had no pet / AI tank. On warlock your demons level with you automatically, even if you just dinged.
---
- On hunter you need to sacrifice space for arrows or bullets and they only have one use: as DPS consumables. On warlock you need to carry soul stones but they have multiple uses.
---
- Other than like trueshot aura, hunters don't bring much utility to groups specifically. Warlocks can summon (which in a way might be even better than mage teleports), can create healthstones for other people, and can create soulstones for healers and such to mitigate the annoyance of wipes.
---
I could go on but these are just some of the immediate things that come to mind. For me IMO hunters also feel very weird with mana management. Their pets using focus as a resource instead doesn't help. Warlocks etc using mana as a caster class makes more sense.
---
That bitch slap though 😂
---
Agreed,  in WSG/AB you had to be good at Pvp(micro play), and also good at the actual BG (macro play) to consistently win.
---
I think you might have misinterpreted what I said - I very much so love hunters and love them for all the reasons you just said. I have a level 60 hunter, which is why I don't want to do the grind on one again after the reroll. 
---
What I was saying is that hunters are rigid in the sense that your role is DPS. You're amazing at it, and that's what you do. Everything in your kit is to assist you in that aspect - be it picking off stragglers, pulling a mob off a healer until the tank can get it, or just straight blowing things up.
---
Druid is what I'm doing after our reroll, and I have a really hard time with their fluidity - you're the tank, the healer, and the dps depending on situation, and everything in your kit is to assist you with EVERYTHING. There's so much you have to consider that it makes me feel like I don't excell at any of them when I play it. I feel like Im just kind of there, watching everyone else while I figure out what the situation needs.
---
It’s still frowned upon.  Plenty of people are raid spec to make the run successful.  If you won’t be in raid spec, how can you ask that anyone else be?
---
Yes, AV is painfully boring
---
Raiding in a top 100 guild world on progress with top 100 + logs
---
I wouldn't say that; I enjoyed healing in Cata, especially Firelands HC was extremely fun and challenging. Solohealing HC Baleroc was the most fun I ever had on a healer.
---
I then quit and started playing in WoD again and healing was so boring because everyone just aoehealed everything. Mana was no issue and the tank took no dmg juggling his cds. It really felt braindead like lfr :/
---
This happened to me for a while to until i got new RAM
---
Paid 350g for mine with borrowed money the day I got my eye from Domo. Got my staff that night. No regrets.
---
doesnt work tried before
---
All ur base are belong to us
---
wanna chain heal random targets for an hour a week then log and play a more fun class?
---
try shaman
---
I wouldn't doubt it if he was high as a kite or drunk, but thats the point. You could never compete in competitive pvp in arena for other expansions because you were serious and wanted to rank up. But vanilla promotes this mindless grind and calls it PvP
---
Calling bullshit
---
you can see it with the BoE T1 pieces.
---
Everyr other class BoE pieces, 450-750 gold each Sell within hours.
---
Druids BoE pieces 60-90gold. Sits all day.
---
Ample gear&lt;playing a good healing class
---
Oof
---
While I acknowledge egregious being a good resto shaman I'll stand by the opinion that you can't claim somebody "might not be a healer" coz they didn't find MC enjoyable to heal. Like come on, you cant say somebody doesn't like Dpsing coz they don't like play frostbolt spam in raids. Same shit just different spell
---
Got it so if max rank Devo aura gives like +700  -- IF'd Priests probably "feel" like they have leather or mail armor in terms of physical damage mitigation I would guess?
---
Warcraft logs, wowprogress
---
Are there really any frost centred pve specs without 5/5 imp FB?
---
The game changed, and itemization changed too. Fury was not viable for a long time. Nothing to do with people not knowing.
---
In like wod I think I got banned for a few days for being afk in bg’s
---
My guild can't even kill rag
---
Why is blizzard rushing out content?
---
I haven’t played a mage in a lil bit but I think with 2/3 imp blizzard your CoC slow will override it and last longer which can be nice. I primarily used 3/3 though and never had many issues, granted I was just farming pirates and WPL undead to level.
---
I was also weighing up between lock and hunter for my first alt. This comment literally made my decision for me. Thanks!
