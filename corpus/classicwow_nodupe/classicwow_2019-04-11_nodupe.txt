It would be nice, though keep in mind BiS is BEST in slot, not options of what can be used. the whole point is to show the best item that should be in that slot for that class/spec. Being able to hover over and see BiS, but also #2 and #3, would be neat so you know at least it's a decent item to use until you get your hands on that #1.
---
---
---
Found a few problems:
---

---
*Unable to select Arms as Warrior for any tier
---
*Rogue only has "Sword" or "Dagger" as an option (instead of a spec)
---
*Mage and Paladin has no specs (it implies Frost and Holy respectively)
---
A little way to go!
---
Post is 3 hours old you are already a stealth archer by now
---
This thread caused me to go look for the IDE drive I saw in an old closet. Manuf: 12May2000 --- it might be the drive I had when I played... bringing it to work tomorrow to find a SATA:IDE controller to see what's on it.
---
Wut?
---
Probably because every single undead (which was the most popular race afaik) was a hard counter to you.
---
TLDR;
---
* NA
---
* RP or PVE
---
* Alliance, could probably be convinced to go Horde with the right guild
---
* 8PM PST or later, would be available most nights 
---
* Priority: semi-hardcore raiding, 95% chance I'm rolling a mage, 5% rogue
---
* Must be adult only guild, friendly and mature atmosphere, no edgelords/trolls
---
* Feel free to PM me on reddit for more info
---
Backstory: I'm currently in my mid-late 20s, and I started playing vanilla back in 2006. I made a night elf rogue that's still my main today! Since I started playing toward the tail end of vanilla, I never fully experienced the raiding scene back then. I killed a few bosses in MC, Ony, AQ20, and ZG in PUG raids before TBC came out but that's about it. My real raiding experience came in TBC. I joined an awesome guild that cleared all raid content with multiple server firsts, and all with a fairly light raiding schedule. I was also an officer in this guild so I do have some leadership experience. I kept raiding with these guys through WotLK but as things usually go, a lot of the original members fell off and changes to the game were killing my enthusiasm for hardcore raiding. Since the end of WotLK I've played pretty casually, but classic has sparked my interest in getting back to that level. **The important part** the thing I loved most about that guild is that we were able to achieve hardcore goals with a semi-hardcore mindset. We raided 3 nights a week for 3-4 hours max. We didn't take ourselves too seriously - the atmosphere was fun and relaxed, but we focused and got shit done when we needed to. There were no edgelords/trolls or mean-spirited people who caused drama and distractions. If someone was missing an enchant or consumable, we helped each other out instead of calling each other out. This is what I'm looking for in a new guild. 
---
My goal is to clear ALL raid content and to experience what I never got to experience on my rogue. I'm pretty sure I'm going to roll a mage this time around just to do something different, but there's a small chance I'll go back to a rogue again. If this description fits the type of person you're looking for, I'd love to hear from you. Thanks for reading!
---
Cause obviously private servers have all the data, and it's correct.
---
Fun fact: Private servers had incorrect quest xp rewards until like a year ago. What's the proc rate on weapon X? What's the armor value of literally any mob, cause the private servers guess on all that.
---
Why do you say that? Go into Barrens early, with quests left over from earlier zones to split exp??
---
That's not the Kool-aid Man...
---
There’s going to be so many people QQing in this sub
---
*Hewwo sushi drake!* It's your **7th Cakeday** w0wnerd! ^(hug)
---
oh my god having that and blackstone ring when leveling in the 50s... Maybe even the axe with +hit from Sunken Temple... So nice...
---
I just typed WTF? like... so fast.
---
Void where prohibited.
---
I still say an amazing April fools joke would have been adding classic to the manager. Letting you play it then the day after it’s gone
---
It's taking forever to announce.  I think they'll do it around late August or September.
---
From my experience, there’s a big disparity of rogues on PvP vs. PvE servers. If you don’t care about PvP, you could actually be in high demand on a PvE server.
---
Yes, I was so hyped about it. I went on a pserver to hone my leveling route etc. Figure out if I wanted to play rogue or warrior ....the problem I'm having after playing all of vanilla in its prime is finding the time. End game guilds require raiders to have consumables every raid and its insanely expensive. I remember taking whole days to farm flasks and prot potions. And even more if they plan to run invis skip runs through bwl. Let's not forget the zg and dire maul tribute runs for bluffs. every guild knows this now and there will be an asston of herbalists on every server and finding the flask flowers will be impossible. I miss raiding but the upkeep for an end game raiding guild is just insane.
---
Haha man this is amazing! bloody love it haha
---
Night Elf Mohawk!
---
Paladin?
---
Lmao I saw that was like haha rekt.
---
Because Everquest sucks!
---
I've never played classic and am very much looking forward to a fresh feeling.  I've mained Warlock since TBC and recently dabbled in playing palladin as a tank and loved it as well.  I'm torn between which I want to start on in classic as my first main.
---
I will PvE but most likely more casually outside of raids as I cant dedicate 3+ hour blocks of time with two kids.  
---
Warlock I think I'll love for just about everything, random PvP, PvE, leveling, farming, etc.  But I like running dungeons and finding groups as a DPS I'm concerned will take forever.  Playing pally tank is almost as fun for me but has an edge in getting insta groups.
---
Are my fears on finding dungeons real as a lock?  If that is the only downside in my mind to playing one should I disregard?
---
Nww thats the normal path. specially with a VC run in there.
---
Fuck me ded and call my Sally, saving this masterpiece
---
Winniethepoohmeme.jpg
---
Your name also checks out.
---
Yeah, fair point. Although streamers again have an advantage because they can just bring 100+ people to Moonglade and have them zerg the event down.
---
That's definitely a better list but it's still inadequate. There's no feral list and a lot of slots only have 2-3 options. But most importantly, there's no weighting so you can gauge the difference between the items for a particular slot.
---
I don't think you should pull out "as a cuban" when you lived your whole life in america likely with a middle to upper middle class upbringing
---
I say it assuming that "fun" is the goal. Now granted, that's actually a fairly big assumption, which I now recognize I should have clarified, but from my own experiences levelling with friends, what's what it's all about. The sooner you meet up, the sooner the memories start being made and you're taking on challenges together and it's just a blast. 
---
You're absolutely correct that it's not the most efficient way of doing it, so if efficiency is what OP is going for, he should ignore my post. I was just saying what I would (and have done before) in his position.
---
&gt; there are fully functioning private servers
---
Show me one
---
Awesome video. But for the alliance !
---
And he’s already a companion too don’t forget
---
Sorry if this is a stupid question (I'm pretty new to raiding), I see Stage 1 pre raid, but I don't see the stage 1 raid BIS, is phase 2 BIS the same as phase 1 BIS or what's the deal there?
---
That’s what you think they’re working on? Lol! I don’t know how private servers got a copy of the source code but it’s not like blizz said “here take everything we have on classic”. They definitely have those numbers
---
Keep in mind, fury warriors will be tanking 5-mans for their pre-raid bis.
---
Once the initial rush of warriors are geared, that’s when we will see a tank shortage
---
I believe you, but could you give some examples? (Sorry for the noob question, I'm just new to this so trying to figure out some the BiS stuff. Especially if you have examples for priest that'd be awesome).
---
Hell yes this was the greatest show ever before youtube! I actually find myself still watching this every now still! Think I started watching it around Ep 3. Even my dad loved it haha
---
I know right, I wanna book time off work and the earlier I do it the better chance there is of it happening
---
Yeah you’re right living ina house with my grandparents and cousin sharing a room with my parents and brother is certainly middle class. All the while constantly hearing horror stories my family was currently enduring that was still over there as well as what my parents and other families members here in the states had to go through. Like honestly could you be any more ignorant. Just because I was lucky enough to be born in this country due to the sacrifice my parents made to come to a country where they had literally nothing doesn’t mean I don’t feel the pain of my family and roots.
---
I'd be disappointed, but at the same time, classic is a masterpiece not to be rushed IMHO. Id rather them take an extra 6 months rather than it be a botched job that disappoints us all - and probably shuts the door on classic ever being viably supported again.
---
Thats not a better way to phrase it, thats completely changing the meaning.
---
Imo only T2 shoulder looks cool, but its stats wasn't all that good. For resto SP and MP5 are way better than spell crit, and for Ele, there was a better shoulder in MC with high nature damage.
---
skinning is trash imo. It just waste time skinning mobs and filling your bags. Just ignore it and level faster, even if you have to wait till 42 to get your mount it's still faster.
---
As a fellow webdev I might humbly suggest a loading state? I see when you select I new class/spec it goes off and synchronously retrieves all the data for the bis set. Maybe try setting a state value to "loading: true" where a little loading icon pops up until all the items are loaded then setting it false. Got me a few times when I was trying to figure out if it was even registering my click before I realized it was just taking a little bit for the network calls.
---
Not necessary just a nice UX thing.
---
Great site - good job!!
---
My old computers are dismantled, but I'm planning on plugging in the old hard drives to make my new char as close looking as possible to my old one.
---
Low quality meme, but true none the less.
---
&gt; They definitely have those numbers
---
No they dont.
---
Sauce: Literally every private server saying "we spent hours and hours and hours looking through old forum chats to guess what the proc rate was for fiery enchant" x100.  private servers had the framework, not the data.
---
Great idea
---
As it relates to Vanilla WoW, you have to remember that very few Druid’s ever pushed for being a tank. As a result, there was essentially only ever one class to tank compared to three healing classes.
---
Private servers have the framework, not the data / numbers.
---
r/UnexpectedJoJo
---
I thought it was funny! :P
---
I have 11.5k screenshots of my time in wow (Vanilla beta to mid BfA)  
---
4k of them are solely Vanilla and TBC.  
---
I recently managed to convert the earlier ones from .TGA to .png  
---
I've began naming and sorting them all. The best part is they're so different. None are spam screenshots.
---
Stfu dude like you know what a good meme is
---
Based on what? It’s so strange when people say things so assertively that counter all logic and experience. 
---
And complaining about too many items to sell in your bag is the pinnacle of missing the bigger picture. It’s all gold—if you run out of space, get bigger bags and keep selling everything. Not filling your bags to save space is an absurd position; the only purpose of your bags while leveling is to carry a Hearthstone and increase vendor revenue.
---
If spillover rep works as intended, then your best chance should be to complete all city faction quests at the appropriate level, in addition to all Gnomeregan Exiles quests. That way, you get 100% Gnomeregan Exiles rep from the gnome quests and 25% extra Gnomeregan Exiles rep from completing all of the other city faction quests.
---
That approach requires a quest completionist strategy, which is something I’ve been working on the past few months:
---
https://shadowpanther.net
---
I've never taken a picture in WoW, except accidentally. I don't plan on taking any when Classic comes out, either.
---
Come on EU servers
---
And paladins with HoJ.
---
Thanks!
---
Because Will of the Forsaken absolutely fucks warlocks lol.
---
I get your excitement! I watch Twitch regularly, streamers playing a wide range of games. And I gotta say I am looking forward to the initial hype that is most likely going to happen on Twitch and seeing my favorite streamers play Classic. It will get me even more hyped to play, if that was even possible.
---
Smart man, this is actually a solid idea.
---
As a former 30+ hour vanilla raider (9 bosses in Naxx) on a med/low pop late stage creation server, I am looking forward to not rolling Dwarf/Priest healer.  I know Troll/spriest probably won't ever get geared enough or be in high enough demand to face roll bwl/aq40 this time around, I am looking forward to leveling, pvping, and casual dungeoning with my son who's rolling warlock.  Although I'll miss being able to raid, at least I won't have to stress how I'm going to afford consumables to raid without playing an extra 10 hours a week. This time I will be able to just enjoy playing the game not treating it like a second job!
---
If you made it so there were the top 3-5 BiS items it would help people make a more achievable outcome, as many BIS items are hard to come by and many of the 2nd or 3rd place items are often good enough. 
---
Really cool.
---
depends, if they have the +healing greens in at launch then its possible.
---
Summer starts when, like a month and half? It only lasts 3 months, so we are like 4 months or so from classic worst case. I expect to be questing by mid June since that coincides with people starting to get summer vacation usually.
---
How long till he joins the dark brotherhood?
---
I’m saying blizzard has all of that data/numbers
---
Ancient Chinese secret
---
Ya, a really good point. Druids gearing heals as well may find themselves in a 5 man tank role just to fill the niche.
---
On mobile it’s a Fucking blob
---
What even is the standard for the MMO genre
---
You know it's a vanilla video when Requiem starts playing
---
And yet pservers get it wrong all the time.
---
After reading through some of the comments I changed my mind on a few things.
---
My friend is rolling a Resto Shaman and I want to play something that synergizes well. I figure I'll have to respec for raiding regardless so I'm more interested in PvP (Bgs/WorldPvP).
---
I heard Warrior/Shaman mixes well but Ive always liked the ranged DPS playstyles better. That being said I'm leaning more towards Spriest/Mage since my other friend is rolling a Warlock.
---
Thoughts?
---
Talent system changed in MOP.
---
Cata's talent change is the one that locked you in to a tree until you spent a certain number of points (60? I can't remember) in that tree, then you could spend into the other 2 trees.
---
[removed]
---
I'm looking to create a Horde leveling guild on a PvP server once launch is announced officially. 
---
Focus #1: Casual leveling guild where we help one another quest, run zones together, pool our professions to assist one another, etc. For instance, I'm rolling mage as my server-first, so I'll want to tailor bags for people, create them food/water, make portals for them between cities, et cetera. Get to level 60 at whatever pace everyone wants, but make it easier and less lonesome on one another.
---
Focus #2: If Step #1 was successful and there are now a handful of 60s, forming dungeon groups to farm pre-B.i.S. in 5-10 person zones, continuing to fill out our recipe books and help one another craft either at mat cost or friend prices.
---
Focus #3: if Step #2 is successful, and we somehow miraculously manage to get a couple dozen 60s in pre-B.i.S., either launching a 20-person raid on the weekend, or lending ourselves out to fill spots for guilds with a more full roster, continuing to stockpile guild bank resources with the optimal goal being to do a small raid once per week or so, for kicks. 
---
There is no Focus #4: Hardcore raiding guild of 2-3x raids with min-max, all consumables, et cetera can make WoW less of a game and more of a job or chore. I want to dabble in a raid or so here and there, but mostly focus on being a community for all levels to either grow and stay or level pressure-free, even if the intent is to depart at 60. We can just enjoy the journey, share company, and learn from one another. Any talent tree research, flask material farming, resource stockpiling, and whatnot would be greatly appreciated, but optional and not *mandatory* like hardcore progression raider guilds.
---
Based on my experience  levelling in vanilla and pservers
---
Yes of course I always have the biggest bags possible, its the most important thing to spend your money on.
---
If you fill your bags while questing, that means you have to make more trips to vendors/mail box to empty them, or delete the lowest value items in your bags.
---
To me it seems like you don't understand that time is money
---
Im 32 and my son just turned 5. I can tell u that it is awesome now. When he was born i pretty much gave up on gaming but continued to follow it. Now we have beat 2 different lego games and currently playing super Nintendo mini. We do alot of different stuff but every now and then we sit down together and play video games. Its so fricken awesome. When he gets older hopefully he will still play with me i would like to co-op divinity original sin 2 or games like that who knows but right now we have a blast and im sure u and your boy will too.
---
 
---
I like LH Chapel (comment will get removed if I say the full thing) for the ease of access to Northern Eastern Kingdoms so I can grind Argent Dawn rep and farm Silk Cloth from SM. When DM comes out, I will be setting my hearth to Tanaris or Feralas.
---
MC/Ony Phase -&gt; LHC
---
Dire Maul Phase -&gt; Tanaris or Feralas until I'm geared enough, then back to LHC
---
Pre-AQ/AQ -&gt; Silithus
---
Naxx -&gt; LHC
---
(Alliance)
---
Time is money, friend.
---
And a few levels without a mount post-40 is quite a lot of time.
---
I am playing a different class, race, and faction on a private server than what I will play on Classic specifically to avoid what you mentioned. It's working incredibly as I am still super stoked to roll an undead priest on Classic release and I will already be acclimated to vanilla
---
"I couldn't help myself"
---
Oh come now, let's call it what it is. "I could have abstained but I didn't want to." Not judging, but let's not act like Blizz held you at gunpoint and told you to find a vanilla server or you and your family die lol
---
I can’t find my old 120gb western digital hardrive with all the pics and such... in super sad :(
---
The last person to say: [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] gets 1kg!
---
It's not terribly punishing, and doesn't prevent people from ganking "grey" level players!
---
A decade on bosses that weren't tuned correctly. Stop using private servers as your basis of comparison. It will be easier than it used to be in classic, sure, but the likelihood of one-shotting is very small. You aren't going to be playing with a bunch of BiS min/maxxers.
---
That's awesome man! This is what I'm hoping for. So glad to hear that it worked out for you guys, and hopefully it will continue into the future. Thanks for the encouragement.
---
Where can we locate these lists?
---
*Cries in pre-1.12 tauren*
---
2017?
---
Dude, it's been since 2018. If you have a job or something, the time passes pretty fast.
---
Everybody knows you run faster with a knife!
---
This is a bad meme. Don’t sacrifice family for WoW. 
---
You will regret it.
---
I have seen that feature in the account management back then but luckily my parents didn't know about it. Goes without saying that I never told them.
---
However they installed a timer switch on our internet router so it would cut off at a specific time. On the switch itself, you could manually change it to "always off", "time determined" aaaand .. "always on". So of course, I sneaked into that room and put it on "always on" so I could keep playing.
---
That went well for quite some time until they found out that I did this, so one night, the door to the room was locked. I went back to my room and pore over what to do next. I don't remember if it was the same night or 1-2 nights after, but I figured that I could open the door with an Allen key. Our inside doors had a very simple lock but it still took me like 15 minutes to open it. I felt so badass when it finally opened. Lock Picking 300 btw.
---
After flipping the switch to "always on" I managed to close the door again from the outside. That way, my parents would find the door locked, just as they expected, but with the flipped switch. We never talked about that, but they stopped locking that door.
---
Quite a story, but today I know that my parents just wanted the best for me, as they always did.
---
Are different people not allowed to have different opinions?
---
you can skip STV altogether by grinding...which is also a better for grinding gold
---
I never got this attitude. If you enjoy the game you enjoy playing it. There's no such thing as burn out. It's called getting bored of the game, and whether you do that off private servers or classic really doesn't matter.
---
Huh?
---
FTH
---
I'm kinda leaning towards Mage since they're strong in PvE and PvP. Plus being able to AoE mobs down and make water is pretty clutch.
---
Warriors are too intimidating for me. I have no idea how their mechanics were in Vanilla and I've heard they can struggle without a healer.
---
He puts all the stats for the items right there though. If you're going through the trouble of looking up bis (or close) item lists for your spec you probably also have an idea on preferable stats. And should be able to make a judgement on items you want. I dont think there will ever be a list with flat weights on every item.
---
Mage is always a good choice, there's a reason so many people play them... They feel very fluid to play in Vanilla.
---
It's not anyone's "opinion" lol it is common sense.
---
Please tell surprise to see you here.
---
your priest bis is way off. green lens &gt; cassandras; dragon finger/lunar wand &gt;&gt;&gt; mana channeling wand; lok+lei &gt;&gt; benediction. you also just ignored the zg trinket...
---
i appreciate the effort put into sites like that, but sadly it does more harm than good if your information is off.
---
&gt; Once you do that you’ll find the months pass faster it’ll be here in no time.
---
Tried that, didn't work, I'm back here and the game still isn't out. Maybe I'm dead and this is hell: waiting for classic but it never releases, you just keep waiting.
---
Its burning me out through a combination of none of my friends playing it, being so late to the game, and not wanting to invest time into a character ill be throwing away too soon if I decide to play vanilla
---
Set your hearth to Kargath or tip the warlock that summons you a gold and he will never complain.
---
A Rank 14 title cant divorce you and take half your shit or grow up to resent you.
---
How do shamans typically fare?
---
Hes wearing a bowtie tho.
---
Wow how ungrateful are you. They already had BFA scheduled for 2018, and tbh getting it in 2019 is amazing given a lot people speculated a 2020 or even 2021 launch. Get a grip.
---
Your post was quite hard to decipher.
---
Where's my BiS list for my Smite Priest? Am I just supposed to take the Mage one and tickle it to remove mage-only items?
---
but only as healers, you'll never be a part of the royal guard.
---
Like I said, it's definitely a better list than the others, it just comes up short in a couple of areas.
---
Feed em shit and keep them in the dark
---
True, but if you're married those things will almost certainly happen if you get a rank 14 title.
---
So what you're saying is rank 14 is more important?
---
I think it would be best if blizz created an incentive for 60s to kill other 60s in wpvp. Something like having a max level player HK reward more honor, or a not 60 HK reward close to no honor.
---
I personally do not want to get honor farmed by lvl 60s. Listen, I'm no stranger to wpvp and I've been ganked by high levels many times.
---
It can actually be fun in a lot of cases since you're forced to figure out a way to get out of the situation, but to actually get farmed for honor? It's a nightmare...
---
That's why I think a good solution would be to make it so that it's not worth farming lower levels. Someone whos ranking will still want to kill anyone that gives honor, but make so that it's not worth farming them.
---
I think it would create a much more healthy environment if 60s fought other 60s. What do you guys think?
---
at which point his cat can step on the keyboard and kill your main.
---
I know it's not vanilla, but I remember our death knight wiping our group or raid (can't remember all the details) by accident. We all had to jump down a cliff into water. He was one of the first to get there so he wanted to mount up and walk out of the water, so he activated his waterwalking aura (something something frost path). So, everyone that jumped after him jumped right into their doom.

We could have a Reddit PvP server and a Reddit PvE server. Then we could do a census/survey and get a good idea of faction balance on each server.

+1 for the PvP server.

Pets can only use certain abilities. A cat cant use Lightning Breath, etc. AFAIK, you can train max rank at any time.

Remember do get class quests done. Probably before you meet. Try to do RFC chain quest together.
---
I will be rolling warrior specifically to tank and reserve items. There are just some things you have to take control over, otherwise you are wasting your time. It pains me to know there will be people trying to play an offspec and expecting main spec treatment.
---
Someone is made they suck at this game. 
---
If you can't defend yourself you don't deserve to live. Go to a pve server.
---
Yo, can you make me a mod but give me absolutely no rights, so I can flex on these nerds but have zero responsibility?
---
The datasource is that google doc that has “Your ad here” on it. That one skipped many hybrid specs
---
......dick
---
HOW COULD I ROLL A 6???
---
And that's going to be insufferable. It was never a thing back in Vanilla, only became one on pservers as too many players having ruined the game cba adding more runs to their lifetime 300+ DM or UBRS clears. Talk about an "authentic Classic experience"
---
Well I say these players should be socially pressured into fucking off and walk the walk, since there's no reason why their lassitude should force the rest of the community into poorer loot tables.
---
You also earned one talent point each two levels.
---
I mained a priest and hated the cata holy priest design.
---
Needs moar CRT monitor.
---
No need for a second set, just for the most part try to pick leather over cloth and blues over greens.
---
Site is broken for me, the dropdowns for spec and faction don't disappear after clicking so you can't see some items.
---
Also looking for developers to help with some other tools i have in store
---
To compensate, every class is getting a new ability called logout
---
neat tool. this'll make my AH trips much easier :P  
---
thanks!
---
Warrior with priest is already gross but warrior with pal is like an episode of will it blend. Spoiler alert your squishy body does indeed blend.
---
"For the Ford!!"
---
And no tux to accompany. Still not impressed.
---
...granted, there's no winning on that one. The tux is objectively best suited to the male orc. Everyone else is just imitating. And falling short.
---
The most I can give you is a 3, champ.
---
perfect
---
ok.
---
Pulling 2 mobs is the fastest way actually. Put down immo trap, pull the mobs, aggro one, put serpent sting on him and make sure he walks in the trap. Let him die to dots. Kill the other mob in the meantime.
---
This makes me a sad panda.
---
Shaman has synergy with everything. They have a totem for every class. The dope benefit of having your buddy play a shaman is that he's the synergy master. If you're looking to play with your friend a lot, you should be looking at this in a different way. Think finding groups, non overlapping gear, end game goals, and what you truly want to play. You don't tailor your play style to a shaman, a good shaman tailors his play style to you.
---
Take my upvote, looks pretty accurate!
---
You've never spoken to a hardcore pserver raider. That's just another lunch time math break for them.
---
The consumable thing is pretty cool. I always hated making sure I had the correct amount of mats for consumes before a bwl+MC clear.
---
I’m rolling mage, and I already know the pain of getting t2 pieces with 6 other people to roll against :/
---
I would like more on this subject as well. I played alli in vanilla and I am considering going horde and playing shaman. Enhancement shaman specifically.
---
There is a certain reality to having a fear of not finding groups as a lock. This fear can be rectified by honestly just being a friendly player. There will be people who want to only have the optimal group for efficiency. There will also be people that are looking for casual people that will create 0 stress in a group environment. but there is also a certain fear to not finding a group as a tank paladin in raids. The question you really should be asking yourself is, with your limited play time, do you want your time investment to translate to finding your way into raids or not?
---
This freaked me out because I thought it was a still image then I saw the hand move slightly. How fucking ironic I laughed out loud coz it’s the scene where Drax is talking about not being seen if he stays still!
---
Private servers do not have all the data. Either you're trolling or you've never played original vanilla.

^ Exactly, feathermoon you would fly to Eastern Feralas to take the back door to DM anyways if you wanted the fastest route so its BARELY faster from feathermoon, which is worse for everything else other than quick silithus.
---
Have no fears my man,. My shaman tank will be there to save the day!
---
Yep... the last part hits too close to home. Why invest so many hours into the character when it won’t mean anything in a couple months? It makes me not want to put the time in
---
I appreciate this.

Playing a rogue is about assessing your fights carefully and attacking in certain windows, as you possess the element of surprise. Mage is about understanding exactly what is happening to you, and making the right decisions. Mage is more quick cerebral play. When you don't have the advantage of being invisible, you need to control the fight. Rogue is about understanding what you want to do and when you can do it. Mage is more about understanding what they want to do, and how you can counter it. In my experience, mage tends to leave you with that, "man, I should have done this" feeling quite a lot. So if you really like analyzing your own decisions, mage can be a lot of fun. You don't often feel like you didn't have a chance.
---
The idea of a DKP guild in a game where everyone knows what items are good and you have very detailed guides sounds hilarious and awful.
---
Stuff like this is why people are gonna always chase that feeling of nostalgia. min-maxing and not enjoying the game
---
The game is what you make it. There is plenty to keep you busy and having fun as a tank.
---
The beginning: Started leveling just as bwl was coming out Grammaton (dwarf priest) Gul'dan Alliance.  Planned on raiding with friends, 1 HC holy pally raider (full Naxx with D&amp;T players), 1 casual Hunter, 1 semi casual warrior (MC-rag), 1 HC PvP mage (GM), and 1 semi-HC DPS warrior (Naxx -KT).
---
The middle: Tried to level asap, got to 30 stalled out, got chewed out by pally friend for being too slow, couldn't get in his guild because of it.  Disheartened and struggling to level holy/disc waited for friends to catch-up, started really having fun doing dungeons together.  Had some epic battles in SS and STV, remember mcing people off of 1000 needles, ganging up on high level Gank squads, realize I love this game!
---
Level 56+: Did MC for the first time with terrible pug, spent 2 hours killing like two molten Giants.  Epic robe drops, mage wins, proceeds to call his mom on vent to tell her about it.  This is when I was hooked and wanted to raid.  Grind out my last few levels doing dungeons and realized I made a terrible choice on profs (ench/tailor) and I am always broke.  Want to play shadow find out it's too expensive to respec constantly to farm/dungeon.
---
Preraid/MC: managed to scrounge enough gold for epic mount, got pretty close to bis pre mc, apply to first guild.  Play a lot of pvp, hate wsg love ab/av have lots of fun pvping with friends Get accepted bc dwarf and a few dungeons and ubrs trials.  Struggle train in MC feels amazing to down some bosses.  Learn I'm good at healing, get decently geared, play more PvP.  Remember a mage, warrior, and rogue that made life hard in bg and world while farming to buy HotW.  Realize my guild is bad, apply to new guild that's 1/2 through Bwl. 
---
BWL/ZG: get in the guild, crush bwl, get geared and catch-up, top priest besides officer.  More PvP, weekend pugs with friends to gear them.  Become friends with guild leaders, have fun exploring wall jumping ECT all over the world.  Mage friend gets HW, sells account for $1500 rerolls new account as Shaman on horde, joins PvP guild.  Have fun facing off with him, realize horde is PvP on my server and alliance is all pve.  Still managed a few good raids on horde leaders, so much fun!
---
AQ: World event is a blast, PvP everywhere, get destroyed by horde constantly.  Realize it's not safe or fun to leave IF for farming anymore.  Stop leaving IF unless it's for raids or helping friends with dungeons.  Enter AQ, trash is horrible (hour to clear trash after cthun), we do really well, full clear except vis(slime boss).  Get ganked daily on my way to AQ by the same effing rogue.  Druid takes cloth robe from me even though I had more dkp, dude server transfers next week (sold his account). Kill cthun, huge accomplishment proud of all of our hard work.
---
Naxx-BC: Naxx is awesome, mc duty on Raz, everything is a challenge but amazingly fun.  Can't afford consumables relying on friends to help farm on weekends to barely keep up.  Start hating the game because of having to play 50 hours a week and respec with no gold.  Always wished I could play shadow.  Got 9-10 bosses down in Naxx, then prebc patch hit.  Couldnt farm aq40 anymore, people couldn't find good specs, raiding is done.  Spend rest of expansion pvping in shadow, exploring areas with wall jumping ECT.  Really happy screwing around now that I don't have a full-time wow job anymore.  Guild disbands, 
---
BC+: BC hits, friends quit, find new guild on new server, I played with them on and off till legion as shadow.  Still miss vanilla, the game felt progressively easier and less rewarding as time went on.
---
Also SM, Strath, Scholo, RFK, RFD, ZF, DM are all waaaay easier to get to as Horde.
---
Classic is made to appeal to the hardcore fans, not the delusional people who act like they remember or those who have misremembered.
---
As an alliance mage I set my hearth to silithus because I was a herbalist
---
one time i got 3/4 of the black lotus in 30 minutes. was great.
---
Lol! Nah it's a Hyundai.. crap ..does that make it less horde?
---
Haha ganked him irl? - savage
---
Important would be the so-called "pre-BiS", meaning bis without touching a raid (MC in this case).
---
Most raids in p-servers would ask you to be at least a good amount pre-bis to join.
---
My friend and I came up with a great idea. We pooled our gold and bought up all of one cheap epic on the AH, then put one up for a ridiculous amount, say 150g. Then we would go to a city (AH's back then weren't connected) and say in chat "WTB Icemail Jerkin 200g" and wait for some poor guy trying to make a profit to buy it off the AH to trade with me, then I would never log on that alt again. We went from town to town, AH to AH scamming players out of 1000s of gold. Eventually getting a 3 day ban, we had all the BOE epics and epic mounts by then and retired before we were perma banned.
---
Wow, I don't remember this in vanilla at all... Would've been very helpful!
---
We get it, Ret is bad.
---
i think they’re gonna drop the release date on us, and it’s gonna be much sooner than we think, and it’s gonna knock our fkn socks off
---
&gt; We only have 3 pet stable slots right?
---
You have 2 slots at the stable master and 1 pet you can have out, totalling 3. The first slot costs something like 10s while the other costs 5-10 gold. Keep in mind that you won't have both slots unlocked while leveling early on.
---
&gt; PvP - Cat, but isn't Boar awesome too? I was thinking about it and those charge stuns sure sound perfect to gain some more distance from melees and interrupts on healers and casters. Is it worth it to replace a Cat for a Boar?
---
&gt; Dungeon/Raiding - Wolf for Furious Howl?
---
&gt; Soloing - Boar?
---
Keep in mind that a Boar doesn't get a stun but only a *root* effect on their Charge ability. Boars are great for leveling and decent if you want to get melees off your face in PVP.
---
Here's what I'd use for each of the 3 categories:
---
&gt; PVP
---
* Cat for fast attacks and tons of spell pushback
---
* Wolf if I'm too lazy to actually level a cat for PVP and use my raiding LBRS wolf
---
* Wind Serpent (more effective once ZG is out, I'll come back to that in a sec) for the ranged attacks that also ignore armor.
---
* Scorpid if you want to get a stacking poison, makes it harder to dispel viper stings, but can mess up your allies' CC
---
&gt; Dungeons/Raiding
---
Either a wolf which has howl for your melees or cat for raw dps. A wind serpent can be decent later on too.
---
&gt; Soloing
---
Anything works.
---
Here's what I was talking about when I mentioned ZG and Wind Serpents earlier. The last and strongest rank of Lightning Breath (their main spell) is only available from taming a Son of Hakkar inside ZG and learning it from him. Wind Serpents aren't as good until that spell rank becomes available, but are still decent, especially while leveling.
---
To answer your last question, you could just level your pet to 60 and then get all of the abilities without needing to get every single rank. You don't need to know every single rank like you would for regular spells. 
---
Do keep in mind that as you level, you'll want to improve your pet's abilties and will most likely learn some levels of some abilities in order to get your pet to do more damage.
---
A naked SL lock will have under 2k hp. When the maker of this vid claims to be naked he is sitting anywhere from 2500-3k+ hp so clearly NOT naked.  Also the opponents are terrible.  Anyone can kill things naked if they are derping around or trying to run away from you.
---
But lots of groups get upset if you roll on dps gear as a the groups tank or healer. So if I'm a druid trying to get a piece of dps gear I'm less inclined to heal if the rogues and shaman will yell at me for ninjaing their dps leather.
---
Also, If you calculate the BiS and non gear specs, you don't need to know any other specific pieces of gear. You can create an algorithm based off of that rotation.
---
You have dps output with 0 talents/gear/racials/bonus racial attributes.
---
You have dps output with full talents/gear/racials/bonus racial attributes.
---
You have the total sum of combat statistics on the BiS gear in each indiviual category. You now have a point value assigned to all of those stats compared to having none of those states. 
---
You now calculate everything with each variable reduced to base. This gives you an algorithm for talents/gear/racials/base attributes deviation individually.
---
You now sum these things totally and input them into your algorithm, and provide a percentage score of maximum dps based off your current potential. This now gives you your appropriate Gearscore for the current gear you're wearing. It's all doable by only being given what the exact perfect rotations are and what the BiS gear is for each phase. You don't need to know any other specific gear inbetween. You simply add all of a random players gear together to have a total value of each individual stat, then plug those numbers into the algorithm, then look at it's place on a scale from base dps - Bis dps. then you scaled those numbers to a more easily read format. 
---
I wanted to provide a more in depth answer before, but I was on my phone at work.
---
Oh that's right, yeah! And you needed to spend 30 points before you could spend points in other trees, or something like that
---
I’ll keep him safe , friend.
---
This is a classic RuneScape tactic. Love it.
---
Yeah, the PvP reward systems are exactly the same. Just the wPvP flagging rules are different.
---
Also it is usually (based on anectodes) easier to get highly ranked on PvE servers because the competition isn't quite as big as on PvP servers.
---
He also managed to jump from 56 gold up to 1865 gold after one picture, interesting to say the least
---
There will be some small and medium sized things that will be a surprise, but some of these players have played classic, and nothing but classic for years and over multiple servers that have had to go through multiple fresh cycles. They don't just know how to play their class with its vanilla quirks, they know how to level extremely quickly (even when some quest XP isn't 100% correct) and begin to monopolize resources and clear the content well ahead of where anyone would have attempted it on actual servers. 
---
Classic has been in an okay state emulation wise for a while, even if you were to give the game the biggest benefit of the doubt and say its going to be more difficult on live due to this or that reason, these are the people that you'd bank on to be able to absorb that difference regardless.

Fake news. There's nothing for ret.
---
Im sure there are in between pics, I just grabbed a handful for the album :)
---
How hard is it to get to r14?
---
Only done WC/RFC/DM so far on pservers, in my experience everyone except the healers have been complete fucking potatoes. Tanks can't hold aggro for shit even in 1 mob situations, dps who have jobs aside from just braindead dps (mages sheeping) don't do their second job at all, even healers are sometimes retarded and have 0 spirit and oom after half a pull, though this could be chalked up to the tanks being potatoes since now they have to heal 5 people constantly instead of 1.
---
Damn nice.  It always takes forever planning mats for enchanting.  Love that tool!
---
I'm with you here, same transition and I think I might just roll a shaman alt just in case I suddenly change my mind later in the game...
---
No. I also have literally never played on a Private Server, so I'm super psyched actually. It's like a whole new game (I only really started Retail during wotlk). 
---
I don't really think the release date issue is a big deal. I mean did you think they'd announce it and then release it three months later? It's going to take time. Just focus on other stuff, other games. There are plenty out there. Classic WoW will come out when it comes out.
---
Is the pre-raid Shadow priest based on 8 or 16 debuff slots / is it actually valid for MC + raiding ?
---
Why would you get banned? That seems like a legitimate strategy. It's the other player's fault if they want to try to make a cheap buck instead of telling you that there's a cheaper version on the AH. Fair game if you ask me.
---
Haha I know right? I don't recall the reason they gave.
---
this is sick dude thanks
---
DKP is just pretty much awful, period.
---
Started WoW in 2004 with my EQ guild and never realized just how oppressive the whole idea of DKP is until I joined another guild around the time of Ahn'Qiraj who just did Loot Council.
---
It requires mature and level headed leadership, but it's really the only way to fly.
---
Was absurd to be essentially playing a game within a game where I had to bank points and strategize about which upgrades I'd pass on vs which I'd try to pick up, stress out about missing a progress raid night and all the DKP, worry about point decay, and people being forced to spend points sometimes on clear upgrades that were going to rot because they're saving for something else.
---
Just run Loot Council, it literally solves everything, and anyone who ends up complaining and moaning about the decisions is probably doing you a favor by earning a /gkick.
---
You are now on list
---
thanks man, helped a lot
---
Exactly, replay the (other) classics. Not quite the same as Skyrim but ive just been doing a(nother) replay of Baldur's Gate 2. About to head to Suldanesselar
---
Also think about the things that you'd be feeling like you'd have to be doing a couple months into Classic releasing (cleaning out a spare room, doing some exercise, whatever) then go do those now so you can focus even more on Classic when it hits.
---
When release date drops you would suck a dick for a sub. Just take a break and keep your mind off of it for awhile.
---
12-18 hrs / day for 3-6 months
---
I had Humar as well. The wait sucked but I was so excited when I finally got him. I still have my old retail account but I haven't logged in since WOTLK.
---
&gt;This is how I can tell you're memeing and not serious.  Any REAL Rogue is going to roll up on you with a sap, cheapshot, SS, kidney shot, blind, stealth, sap, cheapshot, SS, kidney shot, vanish, PREPARATION, sap, cheapshot, SS, kidney shot, blind, stealth, sap, cheapshot, SS, kidney shot, vanish, sap, cheapshot, SS, kidney shot.

Here are the zones and their reputations. It's important that you **do not** take the reputation values you see in my link as accurate because they are NOT.  
---
These values are pulled from a private server where the reputation values are incorrectly inflated. However the data can still be useful to tell you which zones contain a reputation you seek. You won't be able to tell an exact value of reputation, but you can at least see a comparative amount of reputation on a zone vs zone basis.  
---
For example, using this data I can see that even though the value is wrong for Dun Morogh, I still know it has comparatively more reputation than other zones by X%
---
But rocks can't see scissors, cos scissors are invisible...
---
Post some
---
Carrion bird is the optimal Hunter pet for leveling, higher armor and dps close to cats, screech is really good for reducing damage.
---
If you do get the photos extracted make sure to back them up on cloud storage lmao...
---
I mean, maybe they return to the demon world and party it up when they're not summoned.
---
Plus it'll hold aggro on multiple mobs for scattershots
---
DAAAAMAN DR3WBIT
---
Nice tools
---
&gt; Start in gnome starting area and do all these quests:
---
How will a dwarf in Kharanos ever make it to the gnome starting area of Kharanos?
---
Thanks, like there is a tier for each server and rewards are dished out based on percentiles, and only the top 2% get to the high ranks I think I got it
---
Void walkers aren’t demons, though I think they do still reform, just in the void, not the twisting nether.
---
That's the plan.
---
Well LC guilds tend to be more try hard and not only would they probably funnel more loot to someone who makes it to more guild events. LC guilds tend to also be more metric based so if you're the 6th highest DPS warrior it probably means you get your gear close to last where as in dkp its not as gear funnely for you. The most popular are dkp and epgp but there is also weird ones like suicide kings
---
Well, half orc. 😋
---
You can't counter-gank a 60 rogue unless they're stupid.
---
&gt;they probably get pretty psyched when a Warlock summons them up to wreak havoc upon their enemies.
---
Or in the Voidwalker's case, become a literal punching bag - he probably isn't so stoked.
---
It seems like OP forgot to provide the BiS list for ret pallies, please do not forsake those at the bottom of society.
---
Try The Witcher 3 + DLC and if you’ve already beaten it then you can mod it. Alternatively Breath of the Wild and God of War are scratching that itch for me too.
---
It is there way or the highway. They are the prima donna.
---
Not gonna lie, this is awesome.
---
Awesome website, could you add ret pala and enh shaman by any chance?
---
You don't get banned for playing on private servers. That would be Acti Blizz shooting themselves in the foot.
---
I lost it at Undead Male + Rogue
---
Thanks mate, that was exactly what I was looking for. Fuck prebis if I have to compete with half the server for HoJ. The easy to get alternatives are not far off.

Quality effort, thank you sir.

what a stupid post, downvoted.
---
The retail version of it has been a short range (20m?) projectile for years and it uses the same or a similar icon I think. Even I had to double check that it was melee only.
---
He's talking about the engineering trinkets that reflect frost/shadow/fire.
---
wow....anything like this for horde?
---
Right-click report has less do to with world of warcraft and the current political climate in the US and the leftist, PC, safe-space culture. I doubt they will roll it back. It will also most certainly ruin the culture/community of the game which was mostly self-regulated in 2004.
---
Practice at something, trying other factions, trying other classes, getting routes down. There's reasons to  play it. Some people just really love the game and don't mind losing their character/s. Friend of mine leveled 2 warriors in the past couple years and is going warrior on classic. Talk about painful, but he loves it anyway.
---
Just take a break until it releases and you'll replenish your mental energy. One of the great skills 15 years of various degrees of commitment to WoW taught me is how to manage my own hype and desire to keep playing the game. I've been mostly staying away from the hype since the announcement on purpose, and I don't play any pserver either to keep the excitement intact, though I am active on the retail version. Works for me, others will stay super involved until the release date and beyond, the key thing is you have to know yourself and understand what works for you to ensure you enjoy it up to your expectations when it comes.
---
Also forums are mentally exhausting and generally negative as active discussions tend to focus on issues and fix your mind on them instead of other things to be enjoyed in-game. They have to be consumed responsibly. Bottom line is, if you're not part of the small minority who is able to handle perma-hype about it, better have other cool things to focus on too.
---
Hahah its pretty hard to burn yourself out on private in a 15 year old game.  If you were burnt out, you would have been
---
If your burn yourself out on a pserver now, then you were never going to play classic to its fullest
---
Amplify curse of weakness the BM hunter's pet when you can't fear it.
---
&gt;It requires mature and level headed leadership...
---
This is so important. And hard to find.
---
I really empathize with this. After healing as pally every expansion I'm ready to just DPS with something that's easy to level: warlock. (also I was so jealous of warlocks in TBC/WotLK arena so I'm finally getting mine)
---
This sort of server collaboration on this scale didn’t exist in classic, so you’re basically self inducing #changes.
---
Dont worry my battle res is up... oops no maple seeds.
---
This comment brought to you by the other druid in the group.
---
I dont remember much, but I know they all didnt have much. 5g from Children's Week next year will be nice I guess :P
---
No brewfest, we have Hallows end (and the candy has combat uses) but no Horseman or dailies ofc. Winter's Veil gifts are cool, I dont remember if they did yearly special presents back then or how that would work in Classic.
---
Every PServer I've seen doesn't seem to care the slightest about holidays, so I'm excited to see them actually work!
---
It is almost always the tank, which makes sense if you think about it.  You need either a warrior or druid, or if you're alliance, a prot paladin.  However, for a healer, you can use pretty much any priest, druid, or paladin/shaman, and the latter two are pretty popular classes.
---
So if you skip the Barrens and dont grind out levels on mobs to fill in the gaps, what is your questing route? Can you do it without heading to the Barrens?
---
If you cant then that is a bottleneck. Population doesn't have much to do with it.
---
Tried a Pserver. Started meeting a TON of players leveling up, who, like me, haven't played WoW for years, and are just trying to brush off some gaming rust before classic release. Unsuprisingly, these folks are pretty cool.  
---
Also unsuprisingly, MOST of the long-term pserver players, are totally uncool.
---
You'd be surprised lol
---
I absolutely don't look at playing the game less/casually as a bad thing. I really dislike the amount of times this has been implied. When I say "the most casual of guilds" I'm talking about nothing other than lax requirements/time investment, and I recognize this as a completely viable and enjoyable way for other people to play the game.
---
The persecution complexes on this subreddit are insane. I used the word casual 2 times and both of them were to refer to guilds that will have less time invested and therefore less consumables/gear, which is relevant to the conversation.
---
&gt; lvling from 1-60 in Kalimdor only
---
You're gonna have to grind A LOT of mobs...
---
Yeah the list is really random and even upside down in some cases.
---
Here is a revised one:
---
Warrior &amp; Rogue: Weapon dependand, otherwise not really gear depenand. Warriors need enough stamina/armor and maybe resistances to brawl in the frontline. Rogue gear is super lean and they are more spec than gear depenand. A lot of Rogues don't respec for PvP and are subpar.
---
Mage &amp; Warlock: Gear depenand if you want to blow people up fast with fire or destro spec. Otherwise you just need enough stamina to survive burst, because they both have insane utility so you are always powerful in PvP.
---
Priest/Shaman/Paladin (healing/hybrid): Have enough stamina/armor and mitigation (as well from talents) to survive burst and you are fine. Well played healers are extremely powerful w/o much gear because they provide huge utility.
---
SPriest: Lean build, like SL Warlocks they need only +spelldamage, stamina and some int.
---
Enh Shaman/Ret Pally: Hard to gear up properly and generally unreliable and slow.
---
Druid: If you want to be a flag carrier then you need as much stamina and mitigation you can get. If you stay in the back as a healer see above. Ferals suffer w/o good gear compared to standard PvP specs. Balance w/o NS is weak regardless of gear, for Balance w/ NS see Mage.
---
Hunter: Least gear dependand DPS class in the game after healers.
---
This guy fucks

Same rules as above.  
---
Might have screwed up and missed a zone or two.  
---
I'm not Horde main so my attention isn't as good for horde data.
---
Would be nice if you could actually see what buff each consumable provides
---
Voidwalkers are paper thin though. Whose *really* the punching bag?
---
Prot Warriors, actually.
---
Annnd another Classic bookmark.
---
TBH most of the people in general I've run into are pretty cool if I'm being perfectly honest about it.  The biggest assholes are two groups. First, like you said, a not-so-small subset of salty ass pserv veterans.  Second, and even worse, the wannabe streamers with like...a dozen people watching their stream that think they're absolutely hot shit

Pretty sweet! What's the stack - if you don't mind me asking?

I forgot about this site, but holy shit did I love it. Nice!

yeah basic multiplication is real fuckin hard tbqh

Except that's not really the case.

Whenever you summon a Voidwalker it says "I don't like... This place." or "Why... Have summoned me... Here?"
---
They did fire one tho afaik.

That's why I always ask the group before we start if anyone shares gathering professions. If yes ask them to either roll before each one or just take turns.

Wow relax there guy. And tbqh, the "multiplication" isn't the annoying part. The annoying part is going through and looking up each material for each consumable that you are going to have crafted. Unless you have them memorized.

No one mentioned owls so I gotta say I've always loved them.  Great damage, decent attack speed. Claw and screech, aoe threat is underrated. That bird dash I think is called dive and lastly, they're beautiful!
---
If you're Horde you can substitute a carrion bird until lvl 40ish or take the death run to NE starting area.
---
Looking at that warriors gear is what makes me laugh my ass off at people who question ZG and AQ20 gear. There's going to be people still rocking a lot of gear that can get replaced in ZG even after a couple months of raiding MC. Gear was so much harder to come by.
---
So why isn't  Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom ( [https://www.wowhead.com/item=19289/darkmoon-card-maelstrom](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19289/darkmoon-card-maelstrom) ) on the cat druid?
---
Sometime between June 1st and August 31st.
---
That's all anyone knows
---
Consider what portion of classic you want time off during. If you really want to do full weeks or 3-4 day weekends back to back.
---
The trash in AQ40 is one of the most annoying pieces of content blizzard ever created.
---
Ya, my guild was slicing through Neff like butter before AQ40 came out. Died half way in.

---
Great job. Thank you for doing this.
---
However, there are some items listed in pre-raid bid that would not be released yet in phase 1. I can speak for the class i played "hunter". The carapace spine crossbow is one of the loot items that were added later to the loot table (this one from stratholm). So this item won't be available in phase 1. Bis would be blackcrow from Lbrs.
---
Also in phase 2 pre-raid bis (assuming u mean when DM is released) then the melee weapons bis would become barbarous blade https://classicdb.ch/?item=18520 
---
Which gived 60 ap and 1% crit compared to the 50 ap 1% crit of dalrend

Tips Out and Kargoz lately!

This entire post is a troll, right?

---
RIGHT?!
---
I like to think my voidwalker makes a quick sandwich in his pokèball.
---
I'm seeing a guild name here.
---
Gamora  
---
&lt;died to fall damage&gt;
---
Honestly, I don't recall tanking in vanilla being overly difficult. There was just more of a focus on threat. After you get decent gear it's like, almost hard to die in 5 man's.
---
I didn't spend a whole lot of time gearing in 5 man's tho. So maybe my perspective is warped from spending a lot of my time tanking 5 man's with partial MC gear.
---
I never really complain much about being killed by someone my level. 2 deaths in a row from a ?? though? That will get the blood boiling.
---
Considering thats what i drive, no.  Not being a red car does though
---
It's the same way on retail. But honestly, half the time someone makes a comment about me tanking not pulling fast enough ect. It's cuz their dps is half what it should be and shit ain't dieing fast enough or something else. So when you want to play the blame game with a already shitty group, it escalates quickly.
---
Dont lie to the boy
---
Im pretty sure they remain orange for 25 points, yellow for 25 points and green for 50 points for a total of 100 points.
---
Meaning copper goes gray at 100, Tin at 150, etc.
---
I vividly remember the 100-125 part to be extremely frustrating since Tin is green at that point.
---
To add to this.
---
The Defias storyline, introduces as highway robbers in Elwynn, it leads to Westfall to uncover the secrets of a coordinated effort of robbery and plundering of the countryside, then a backstory interlude in Redridge Mountains and Stormwind, with the conclusion of the first act in the Deadmines.
---
The second act, ‘The Missing Diplomat’, begins with a letter found on Vancleef, it leads to a larger plot to undermine Stormwind with the Stockade riots and the reveal that Defias operatives have infiltrated Stormwind as high level diplomats. Related to this are the top secret Defias operation quests in Duskwood. The story eventually leads to a few quests in Dustwallow Marsh, and unfortunately ends rather suddenly in vanilla (much better in TBC) with the addition of quests for Alcatraz island.
---
The Third Act, the discovery, reveal, and ousting of Onyxia, begins in the burning steppes, though it is hinted throughout the leveling experience. While these quests are not focused on the defies brotherhood, the result is the removal of the head of the organization. Thus ending the story and influence of the Defias Brotherhood in vanilla.
---
Nice! Great job.
---
My absolute favorites are Madseasonshow, Kargoz, Chimly, and Countdown to Classics uploaded podcasts.
---
I also always watch videos from nixxiom, Frostadamus, tips out and staysafe, I even watch an alexensual vid from time to time. But I’ll pretty much watch any video, and even prowl retail based channels like Preach or Bellulat for the occasional price of info on Classic.
---
Really hate to admit it, but that’s the first combo I rolled and stuck to. Still have the same character. And I was a 10 year old, hopefully didn’t roll need unnecessarily. I did learn the hard way to always dismiss my pet... Definitely branching out with classic launches.
---
They're going to buff ret's damage by 0.1% and no one will know any better.
---
^^^cause no one is going to play ret /s

Weapon skill = hit raiting , more weapon skill , more chance to hit
---
July 16. My second guess is that it’s 1 or 2 weeks after July 16. 
---
I’d expect to have a release date in 2 weeks time.
---
I loved this show back in the day! Waiting for a new episode was like waiting for a GOT episode today.
---
Frostadamus and Madseasonshow
---
Not enough to matter
---
Yup. Once the try hards are done gearing through dungeons and in MC, things will change quick. I'm concerned the "spirit" of the game will be totally different this time.
---
All the people who are going to be really good players, likely won't be as mixed into pug groups. I fear that with the exception of DM dropping. It's basically going to be potatoes R us for pugging. Which will snowball quickly. 
---
Once everyone has a consistently bad experiences pugging, they'll just farm until they can get a guild group together. Can't really blame them for that. But, I remember in vanilla having people in T2 doing DM/UBRS runs for that one piece they wanted ect. Quiet consistently.
---
I just fear the pug experience from retail will bleed into classic. It's toxic and horrible...
---
Basically antman up thanos' ass close

*lie about being a prot warrior

This isnt that bad trash after twin emperors is Way worse
---
Kindve on topic - if tanks are in short supply how viable are druid tanks in high end five person dungeons?
---
its in the data, i just havent built the hover function yet
---
My experience with Gearscore in Wrath was easy to beat. You simply kept two sets of gear - one with the highest possible GS, and the one you actually used to out-dps everyone! =D
---
How many hours per day will you be playing?
---
I’m running right away from hunter. Definitely will be giving another class a go, and sticking with that. Definitely helps not being 10 anymore haha.
---
That one ogre floor where you get the basket,  definately necessary, and the imos and satyrs leading up too it in stealth.
---
Sulfuras is my favorite weapon in WoW and I want it to for my main. What class should I play to best utilize it and maximize my chances of looting it? I was thinking of rolling a pally and using Sulfuras with for pvp and go holy for pve content. Hopefully brownie points with a guild for main healing them will let me reserve the eye if it drops. Solid plan, or should I consider a different class to better utilize the beautiful legendary?
---
Needs races
---
Not sure about time per day but I'd imagine it will range from 4-8 depending on the day.
---
or "Send me back"
---
Get drunk and wander into it?
---
If you find anything lemme know lol
---
Thats a lot of food
---
Shiitttt I would love a Nemesis headpiece version of this.
---
Great job.
---
Mages always have been and always will be the "noob" class. The class was literally made for first time players and for anybody to pick up and play with little effort.
---
Nature damage gear is definitely NOT expensive. Frost, fire, and shadow damage gear sells for a good amount because those are all raid specs, but raiders aren't playing Elemental Shaman. 
---
If you search the AH every single day for "Nature's Wrath" items level 45 and above, then eventually you will find a piece in every slot for a decent price. I think the most I paid for a single piece on a private server was 5g. You can also pick up the Abyssal Mail "of Sorcery" pieces - these sell for much less than their healing counterparts.
---
Thanks! Really appreciate it
---
That title, just perfect haha. Zhevra hooves though...
---
Yes (except for Doomshot but dw about that), it's a few thorium bars (and dense stone?) so it's easy enough to craft, but valuable enough that you'll want to more or less only use it for raids. It's not crazy expensive to buy but easier to craft. (You craft the bullets and then can trade them for equivalent arrows).
---
Ooooo I'll do that next, I'm going orc warlock for classic so it works out great
---
Do you have any "iconic" warlock weapons/spells/etc. that I should put underneath the helm in mind?
---
Dunno. This desk belonged to a mechanical/wood working dude that lived in the house before me..
---
Stage 6 is fire for mages.
---
Isn't a lot of pre-bis cloth and healing power? Idk, I don't remember a ton of mail spell damage gear in pre-bis.
---
"Lost Man's Cave" is a bit of a fuckup, Colonel Kurzen is already as direct a reference to Apocalypse Now as can be
---
Duo leveling is a little bit slower than solo, but not by much, and its a lot more fun.
---
The average speed runner will get to 60 between 5 and 7 days /played.
---
Those times are optimized as much as possible. So I would imagine a fair estimate is somewhere between 15 and 21 days /played for your average players.
---
It effects hit and glancing blows, glancing blows can't happen in PVP and hit cap shouldn't be hard to get (assuming you're 2h), luckily orcs already have a good tier PVP racial aswell so it doesn't even matter.
---
\*BOOM\* HEADSHOT!!!!
---
IIRC, when you a target players, everyone has the same defense and weapon skill values at 60 (300). Racials don't do anything.
---
Just get tailoring and enchanting, you should have you're first wand by about level 11 without really trying.
---
I'm very interested to see if the Chuck Norris jokes just resume as if things had never stopped, or if we adopted a whole new thing for that space in Barrens chat.

Every monday there's a LFG sticky in this subreddit where you could post, and also looking for other posts of people that are looking for a duo partner.
---
Otherwise, join Discords. This subreddit has one and there are more from other subreddits, WoW Youtubers, Podcasts etc. All the people there are interested in Classic WoW so chances are that you'll find someone that'll fit your criteria.
---
Maybe there are other or better ways to find people but those are the things that came to my mind.
---
...and this is why I fully expect the pserver crowd to fail. They won't be missed, either, as it would seem "they" are mostly snooty, arrogant and unpleasant to play with.

Yeah, I ended up getting the few pieces that rogues already had once we got BWL on farm back in the day. I just had no idea that people were doing Patchwerk with druid tanks until Vanilla was long gone.

---
Leveling a rogue is harder then expected.  When I tried it. No aoe and need to be in melee range to work. More then two mobs = your prob dead.  
---
It was a lot easier with a warrior.
---
Tanks not holding aggro would more likely be dps not waiting for threat to build, even on one target. Unless they’re literally not sundering or something. Have to remember that threat was a very real thing in vanilla that they started removing in like wrath. Dps should wait for sunder stacks, also pay attention to threat (which may have required a mod for the entirety of vanilla?) and if not then that is on the dps when they pull aggro
---
&gt;	dps who have jobs aside from just braindead dps
---
Watching threat is a 2nd job for all dps which can only be somewhat ignore by classes that can drop aggro like with vanish or feign death. Being a good dps’er wasn’t really that braindead of a job especially for like warriors and mages that had to evaluate if dropping a crit right now might pull so they have to know when to hold back a bit until the tank pulls ahead again.
---
Although I played WoW back in the days until BC, I'm disappointed to hear the Elves are now the "runaway favorite" in the Horde. This is not the Horde it used to be.
---
I hope to the fucking good Lord that I don't end up on the same server as a streamer.
---
recently played a rogue to 60 on a server that should be pretty blizzlike. took me 9 days /played with lots if slacking, pvp (open world and bgs), running useless routes and doing useless dungeons without quests. i pretty much had to learn the game again after 10 years. from time to time i ran out of quests. at lvl 52 i got myself a questing addon to complete the grind. i think 7 days will be very realistic while still taking my time and having fun. and thats with one of the slower leveling classes
---
But what about "Demonic Sacrifice", would you argue thst spell is also not literally sacrificing them? I mean it's called like that :D
---
Awesome thanks bud!
---
I’m gonna trust the actual developers of the game who have the actual data from back then still versus the 3 party random who had to guess a shit load of information.
---
As others have said, Tanks are usually is shorter supply then Healers. Remember that tanking is a challenging role too.
---
Lot of good mentions here. However many on sleeping on platinum-WoW
---
I grew really fond of MadSeasonShow. The way he reminisces about classic with his calm, monotone voice and the background music really hits the nostalgia spot for me. Also, you can see that he puts really a lot of effort in his videos, as there's usually fitting footage to visualize what he's talking about. It seems like he has a local private server setup for that purpose.
---
Someone linked his first WoW Memories video in this subreddit and that was my entry drug. By now, I have watched nearly all of his Classic videos.
---
Other than him, Frostadamus is really great too.
---
Also, recently, I found the *vanilla flavor* videos from Platinum WoW, they're really well made, one for each class. He doesn't have many videos yet but the content is great so far.
---
Then, there is Nobbel87. He's a legend that has made hundreds of lore-explaining videos for the Warcraft universe. If you're interested in the lore, you should definitely check him out. He covers literally everything from the creation of the universe until the recent events in BfA.
---
its a little further from MOST things you'd be doing at 60 on kalimdor though than say, gadgetzan
---
Honestly, I wouldn't try to duo level unless you know the person very very well.  It's just too hard to always be on schedule.  Unless you can find someone who will commit to playing only at specific hours and always being on during those times (and you want to play with a rigid schedule as well), you're going to have a rough go of it.  I'd say that unless you are living with someone on the same schedule, SO or roommate or something, you're better off just solo leveling and grouping up with people in game.  Find a guild with other people your level and play with them.  I live with my fiancee and we will be duo leveling together, but in most situations, I think it's going to be a giant pain in the ass.
---
No one around to see your awesome guild name because of x-realm/sharting!
---
Yeah, sounds about right. I'll probably have to scrap mining on a char and start from scratch. I just need to know for sure.
---
I've still got my [First Onyxia Kill](https://puu.sh/Dd1Av/0d896df534.jpg) hanging around. No idea where my character is though!
---
Tips out is the worst. He's too mainstream, bobblehead, cringe try hard video titles.
---
There's always a chance that someone finds an old retail vanilla video to prove a case.
---
That’s just not true they will not be able to hold up the health and defense- predominantly due to the fact that their best in set tanking gear comes from their tier.
---
Just depends on what you do.
---
My first 60 was around 30 days in game, but I wasn't really focused on any particular thing. I'd run around with friends, raid crossroads, ran ZF so many times while listening to "I Believe In a Thing Called Love" by The Darkness that I'm cursed to have stair flashbacks every time I hear it.
---
I was also playing around 14 hours a day at that time. Took almost 4 months of IRL time due to jumping onto various alts and that kind of thing.
---
So assuming you make up your mind about what you want to play and don't switch to a different character, assuming you level entirely as a duo, and assuming you're both not warriors, you're (on average) probably looking at around 3 weeks in-game, give or take a few days on either end to account for skill/lack of skill/diversions. 
---
IRL time? Not enough information to estimate. If you no life it like a good, respectable WoW player should, you're looking at about a month and a half.
---
But if you're a loser with a family/job/hobbies/other reasons to live, then anywhere from 2-4 months is to be expected.
---
As Classic comes closer, I plan on creating a guild (I have the Discord in the works at the moment). Feel free to let me know if you'd be interested. I'm in college, so hardcore raiding and rushing to end content isn't exactly my (nor the guild's) goal. It's be more laid back, and focused on catering to the needs of people progressing.
---
\- A guy that has played since TBC.
---
Your fonts are horrendous, what the fuck are you doing
---
We would notice and it will become known. The comunity voice is so divided these days so the question is if Blizzard will actually do anything to fix it or will not enough people care.
---
You can only try to bait them into ganking you while your lvl 60 rogue/druid friends are nearby.
---
Why do you want to use your vacation to binge a video game? If that’s your plan it might make more sense to take the vacation later on anyway so there is more to do, get to 60 before your vacation then you can devote time to getting some pvp ranks of phase 2 is out yet or hardcore run some dungeons to get geared out or what have you
---
On an unspoken server, I leveled to 32 as one and found it highly rewarding with Blacksmithing and Cooking to make everything easier as a solo player.
---
I didn’t even run dungeons and managed to have a good time...  minus the PvP.  Got killed a lot.  Definitely doing a PvE server at launch.
---
Top level hunter, warlock, mage and priest will be way ahead of the curve no matter how top rogue you are. I am sorry I hurt your feelings, it’s just the way it is.
---
I don’t know about ideal, but back in vanilla we ran hpally, retpally, double warrior and hunter all T2+ . Had a lot of fun on undead side trying for that mount.
---
Yes! I was actually about to, thanks for reminding me.
---
be attractive
---
Gotta give that one to Soupa for myself. Not as regular on the uploads nowadays but always quality to watch his older things.
---
Thanks for this.
---
Can be done in about 8 days played pretty easy if you don't piss around much. Assuming you have a rough estimate of where to go.
---
Having classes that work well together and following a leveling guide will lower that.
---
150-200 hours more if you stop to smell the roses more than once or twice.
---
So you still need 5% hit?
---
Upvotes for you all
---
These days it's mostly political rivalry in Barrens chat but it probably won't be as toxic/explicit as on private servers as Blizzard will actually permaban people for using extreme profanity.
---
Everything is a conspiracy. You know what the government puts in the water and how it affects frogs, don't you?
---
That looks dope.
---
My guess is summer.
---
Paly/shamy if you like being a big help to everyone in the group, priest if you like having different healing options/decisions, Druid if you just want to be a bit different.
---
Thanks, but I don't need easy mode.
---
All it takes is 1 creator. Everyone else just has to download an add-on.
---
My first 60 that I started in '04 hit 60 in about 16 days played. I wasn't even really trying. I liked doing quests and competed every one I could find even if it was grey to me and explored every inch of every zone. For comparison, on a pserver I played the same class and did it in just over 7, and that was without doing any "speed leveling". Just having a vague recollection of 12 years prior and focusing more on leveling than dicking around.
---
Looks dope!! Reminds me of Assassin’s Creed too actually
---
Shit, my fault. I was on mobile and didn't realize I was writing on r/classicwow.
---
Go ahead, I deserve every downvote U_U
---
contact them and explain the situation and they might help.
---
&gt; Bgs don’t have rez timers.
---
Have you ever been in a BG ? If the timer is shorter and doesnt increase with dying multiple times, it doesnt mean there is NO TIMER.
---
&gt; ...yes, I am a Dude..
---
Hey man, cheesecake is a rite of passage. I'm just impressed you got that close to GM. I jumped ship from my nelf huntress around level 55. It wasn't until I hit 60 on my tauren druid (male this time, can't imagine why... &gt;.&gt; ) - well after BC had launched, mind - that I finally got into PvP. I've no idea if I ever got anywhere rank-wise with him, I just had a blast running BGs and doing world PvP.
---
...what little of the latter there still was by then, anyway. I am *so* looking forward to the first two phases of Classic.

Usually paladins are actually the raid tank healers, they can chain spam on the tank and also have a 0-100 instant “oh shit heal”. Paladin would be a great class to learn healing because you’re healing kit is smaller, doesn’t make it less fun though. Priests are general raid healers, not tank healers.
---
On horde priests are the tank healers and shamans are general raid healers because of chain heal.
---
Either side Druid actually has the biggest heal numbers so that’s fun, and teaches you a lot about downranking.
---
Pick whichever class looks the nicest to you, they are all good in their own way :)
---
Resto shaman and all that mp5. +healing is also very important and blindly going for mp5 isn't the best choice, especially when boss fights are short in early raids. And when T1 and T2 become available there won't be one BiS as depending on fight or assignment you will either be raid healing or tank/single target healing which can alternate between 8T1 vs 3T2.
---
I believe you do get benefit of what 0.04% in a bunch of things like hit crit parry and dodge or something
---
so you get like 0.2% chance to crit and hit basically nothing and you would never realistically be able to notice a difference
---
For looks: Priests look arguably the coolest in good healing gear. Paladin itemization is all over the place.
---
For utility: Paladins are gods in 5-mans. They can stop mobs from running. Give folks free elemental resistance. Salv = more dps. In Strat undead / Scholo they have mass stuns. Can *actually* res folks. Wipe (kind of) protection with DI. BoP = saves the mage when they pull aggro. Freedom on the tank. Bubble, ofc. And heals that crit cost no mana.
---
In raids, a lot of that utility isn't required. But paladins have the more interesting kit, imo. Priests will top the meters though.
---
Thank you! I didn't think about it.
---
My undead warlock will be xNightKingx
---
going for edgy 2006 vibes, what are you doing?
---
My first lvl 60 had 26 days /played when I dinged. My 2nd lvl 60 had 6 days /played.
---
With the 2nd one I tried to lvl up fast and didn't do much random stuff, a Mage. First one I explored the world!
---
Nice, good luck.
---
Ohhgee does PvP meta, only one doing so.
---
Stormx and Perplexity make great PvP videos.
---
Pserver players tend to be more aware of the fact that warriors are fantastic at 60 and in high demand (as of 1.12, anyway). Finding a tank for 5 mans is still hard.
---
Did you really just fuck up one of the easiest memes to make?
---
Hunters will forever be the biggest newbs in WoW because they never have to face consequences for their mistakes. Hunter fucks up and pulls something? Oh well, they just Feign Death. Everyone else in the group dies but nothing bad happens to them.
---
I've never played with a Warrior who had that problem. Every Warrior who makes it past a certain level knows exactly what they can pull and how many mobs they can handle. They don't have any outs when they make a mistake. They just die.
---
I NEED RELEASE DATE SO I CAN PUT IN MY SUMMER VACATION DAYS AT WORK.

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
It might be absurd playing a game within game for you, but its fun and straight forward, transparent for others. DKP has its place and can be an awesome system, especially for non hardcore guilds.
---
Oh and if you are missing raid nights in LC system, it should not make any difference compared to DKP, should be taken into account when distributing items.
---
Kargarth with engineering transporters, tanaris gadgetzan for AQ raids was insanely useful. It was so damn easy to go anywhere as a mage with kargarth HS and engineering.
---
If they have tanking gear that isn't totally garbage and are feral (30/21 at least) they're better than a non-prot warrior. Actually quite good for 5-mans because they can hold threat well
---
Where's enhancement?
---
It will totally bleed in. It's just the difference in the gaming community today. Triggered a lot by the way games have been designed lately. People won't magically change. Over time it may get better as some of them quit, and others learn the benefit of being friendly and social in the game. Going to be a long learning experience for some I expect.

Nobody knows exactly how weapon skill will be in classic, but this is best guess. So most benefit is before 305 skill, but human sword rogue will have 310 skill and another 4 from maladath won't add much.
---
The warrior gear list is just wack...
---
-This list is geared toward humans &amp; no other races
---
-Savage Gladiator Chain for pre-raid tanking??
---
-No Chromatic Boots
---
-Onslaught Girdle in the Naxx list instead of Girdle of the Mentor
---
-Ony neck in the Naxx list even though it includes KT loot.
---
It's always booty bay baby.
---
That orc rogue looks like he's about to take a shit in onyxia's lair
---
HotW is BiS.

Tanks.
---
Because if there's no shortage of tanks, people who play tanks will change to DPS (or heal if you're a druid or paladin). In that case, it'll eventually be a shortage of tanks.
---
Has anyone got a link to the video of Esfand saying he’s going to be twitch streamer of the year 😂😂😂 what a knob
---
Nice 10 euro headpiece.
---
We can only take vacation between June-August and during these months my girlfriend is working. So Yeah during the nights while she’s sleeping I’d like to binge the game of my childhood. And I’d rather try to hit 60 during this period because then it’s back to reality Which means that I can MAYBE squeeze in 1-2 hours of gameplay a few days in a week. And I think we all know that in vanilla that’s not a whole lot of time to do anything with.
---
Yeah because there is two PvE DPS specs. Combat Swords or Combat Daggers.
---
This is the worst reason Blizz could have to give the release date.
---
Unpopular opinion here but I'm still slightly hopeful that they release it after 8.2, which would place it late summer and allow retail players like myself to do Azshara first.
---
Here's mine
---
https://shield-block.blogspot.com/2014/03/wow-memories-in-screenshots-2006.html
---
I've still got all my old screenshots.  They're precious.  I see lots of names in those screenshots of people that simply aren't around anymore.
---
Well, for RP-PvP it's easy. If they release one, there is only one to play on :P
---
Speed runners are likely going to get closer to 4-6 days /played, I wouldn't say a 7 day level 60 run is "optimized", just saying
---
Expect to take 7-12 days /played to hit level 60.  For reference, playing 6 hours per day, that's 28 days on the low end and 48 days on the top end.
---
This doesn't include the slow, casual levelers
---
You are pretty spot on. 
---
Shamans are stacked so you might not get a piece of epic gear for 6months /lol. It is totally opposite for druids and you will likely be fully epic after 3 MC runs. 
---
It never felt more demanding to be a Priest, you have a spell for every situation, so you have more spell if that is what you mean. For 5mans Pala can strugle early on to output enough group healing in a bad pull. So i would say Pala is more demanding. 
---
Pala and sham if you just want to /lol at rogues.
---
&gt; and Naxx
---
I know this is 4 days ago, but I want to reiterate that NO BOSS IN NAX HAS FEAR
---
I don't even think the trash has fear
---
This will depend on class and if you go for anything else. Fast levelers will take 4-6days, while the average player likely will be 8-10. Add another 1-2 days if you do professions and dungeons.
---
If there isn't a mafia, devilsaur is not super profitable when you have to compete with other players for the mobs and selling on AH. What makes devilsaur so good is the mafia.
---
thats my secret cap, i'm always ganking
---
Actually, If worldbuffed/critcapped you will gain more dps from ony neck than from KT-neck. The difference aint big though.
---
Haha thats an awesome story. You should tell your parents now what you did back then if they still dont know, and also inform how youre going to get sucked into the very same game again.
---
but its the best reason for the players.
---
I used to do that all the time when people would jump down into the water in Azjol-Nerub or the drop to the last boss in Trial of the Crusader.
---
You should add Un'goro consumables. Neat though.
---
Any other reason to be asking for a release date is simply impatience.
---
Dude... have you ever done world pvp? That timer goes to 2 minutes rather quick. I'm saying it all adds up. More variables, higher rez and run times, etc.
---
Had the same cat up to 50. Just looks cool.
---
:D
---
&gt; Tanks can't hold aggro for shit even in 1 mob situations
---
I can see how that might seem frustrating, or that it might be the tanks fault, but in vanilla tanks need a lot more time to build up threat.  Especially at those lower level dungeons when they don't have all their options available.
---
It is important to remember that until later levels even sunder armor doesn't have that high of a threat bonus.  On top of that rage generation vs damage taken is a ridiculous issue at lower levels, and cause a lot of warriors to reroll because no matter how good of a job they do everything gets pulled away by dps who don't know how to slow down.  Making them feel like it is their fault.
---
Later on tanks have things they can do to manage that a bit better, but most of the time dps needs to be kept ridiculously slow unless the tank is overgeared/overleveled.  That even leads to healers who are not overgeared/overleveled to run short of mana, as spirit doesn't do all that much at all either at that point in the game.
---
Some people are in for a rude wake up come classic launch.
---
this is fucking great. sadly i only have one upvote.
---
Savage glad chain is pretty sick for pre-raid tanking for threat, I wish we got the original version with 20 def.
---
Nice work. I'd like to add that warrior gearing is alot more neuanced though. BIS for respective phase will depend on the following factors:
---
- Critcap/worldbuffs
---
- Boss armor (it varies, high armor bosses will have badge of the swarmguard as BIS trinket).
---
- Race (Orcs benefiting from Axes and humans from Sword/mace).
---
- Edgemasters
---
Take it as late as possible?
---
Sounds Great!
---
Let me know what server so I can roll on a different one.
---
No one knows for certain.
---
My advice is to have you summer vacation time as late as possible. You may still be working when the game is released, but at least you maximize your chance of your vacation time being post release.
---
Read wow lore, there is a lot and it's very good. Especially local lore in wow.
---
Seems like a fairly simple yet useful add on. For consumables it might be best to put the most commonly used potions at the top and less used ones lower (ie for warlock have flask of supreme power, arcane elixir, etc at top and blasted lands int/stamina buffs near the bottom)
---
Realy nice page. For Warriors Tanks however Information is somehow a little bit off for some slots:
---
Mainhand: Ironfoe 
---
Chest: Deathbone Chestplate
---
Girdle: Deathbone Girdle
---
Legs: Deathbone Legguards
---
Ring: Naglering
---
For trinket 2 I would go with HoJ
---
Yeah those casual noobs playing 4 hours a day. Pft what losers.
---
&gt; Kalimdor only   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; STVietnam 
---
Uhhhh
---
Thanks for sharing bro! And let’s make a thousand more memories in Classic!!
---
Looks more like a pic of TBC 2v2 arena
---
Somebody giving you a suggestion doesn't always have to be 'the blame game'.  
---
Even if somebody is telling you something in a degrading manner, ignore the attitude and focus on the message. I'm not saying you have to accept any criticism anyone gives, but even flaming sometimes contains useful tips if you strip the insults. Just be the bigger man, ignore the flame and see if there is any useful information there. If not; ignore. If so, take note.   
---
By flaming back you indeed start the blame game and this'll just escalate.
---
You sound like you got killed by a naked SL lock
---
I hope so!
---
Goes to show how good T3 was when your still using it in BC.
---
No armor, but +420ap in feral forms (along a bunch of healing stats) was just something to drool at.
---
That’s a cool story man but there was only one AH during vanilla, and even when they added the others they were linked.
---
100% this. Trash between emps and cthun is worst trash in the game. 
---
The gauntlet here is so much easier and less frustrating that suppression room in BWL
---
Oh wow, &lt;Sapped Girls Don't Say No&gt; is such a vanilla guild name.
---
Classic wow is hardcore now?
---
This meme looks like it came straight out of 2006. Love it.
---
TBC gearing was more based on itembudget than Vanilla was. One could indeed make a GS addon for vailla aswell but you'd have to assign individual items a score instead of letting the addon derive it from itemlvl/budget.
---
Kinda wish the text would show up but w/e :)
---
Yes I doubt they will. They don't want nazis roaming free in various different channels until a GM can look in to it. From that point it's better to squelch the person temporarily until a GM review has been made.
---
So spoiled with blue posts the last couple weeks I don’t even know what to do with myself.
---
Looks radical
---
Male orcs are better
---
God, do you all really need to take vacation for this game? I am also hyped af but still it would never occur to me to take time off for WoW no matter what. I‘d rather go somewhere warm and sunny on vacation to relax. 
---
Or maybe you all have too many vacation days you can take off - the 30 I have is not enough though to convince me to spend them on any game. 
---
Probably will be downvoted, just my opinion though..
---
I once had a voidwalker called Maknak. Now I wish it sounded more like Meeseeks
---
I already ran out of it sadly, my deadline was end of March.. So I gambled on the mid July release xD. I will get my 2 weeks of nonstop Classic either way but it would suck hugely to miss the clusterfuck launch.
---
.2% more chance to hit and crit, .2% less chance to be dodged or parried
---
To be fair i only had 2 parts but all my old gear besides shoulders was replaced quickly. AFAIK there was little to no replacement for tank shoulders before raid.
---
Different strokes for different folks. I'd rather spend a week in my house doing absolutely nothing for a week rather than go someplace.
---
I’d gamble on a very late summer release
---
Lucky for us, the players don‘t get everything the way they want.
---
but what would be wrong about getting a release date? oO
---
Nothing, I‘d like to see one, too. But not because someone asked for it because he needs time off but because the game is finished.
---
Around Aug 19th, as sources say
---
/played 10 days if you’ve never done it before. 
---
People who’ve done it on private servers before will be able to do it under 8 days. 
---
And the really fast guys will do it under 6 days.
---
yes i want to take 2 weeks off work. i have 28 days/year. u will get downvoted cause you dont respect the opinion of other players.
---
I guess you're doing this on NA ? :'(
---
Not really. But Orc has another racial that matters in pvp immensely. It’s arguably the best racial in the game.
---
Now I’d thought I’d get some Alliance support but damn so much for the classic community
---
I do, where do I say I don‘t? It just makes me wonder. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
The fury part could need some polishing but the tank side is a complete mess I agree.
---
&gt; God, do you all really need to take vacation for this game?
---
 **&lt;Event Horizon&gt; \[EU-GER\] \[Alliance\] \[PVP-Server\] \[Semi-Hardcore\]**
---
We are a newly created German based guild for classic PVE progression. We're looking at a semi-hardcore approach, we will be pushing to clear content as quickly as possible, while our goal in classic is to clear all raid content in an efficient manner while maintaining a relaxed &amp; Fun atmosphere.
---
\- **Discord**: [https://discord.gg/u5sXqzH](https://discord.gg/u5sXqzH)
---
\- **Realm** : EU-Ger (realm TBD)
---
\- **Realm** Type: PVP
---
\- **Faction**: Alliance
---
\- **Region**: EU
---
\- **Timezone**: GMT+1
---
\- **Guild Type**: Semi-hardcore
---
\- **Raiding Times**: TBD. But we are looking at 3-4 Raids per week.
---
\- **Loot Rules**: TBD
---
Because we are a German based guild you should understand the language on a basic level. We expect all of our members to be respectful of all guild members. We don't expect everyone to know strategies to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn, and put 100% effort into it.
---
Demand for:
---
Rogue - High
---
Hunter - High
---
Holy Pala - High
---
Mage - Medium
---
Warlock - Medium
---
Fury Warrior - Medium
---
Also we fully expect some people cannot raid as hardcore as they used to, and we have kept that in mind and will be allowing casual’s also to join, as long as “if” or “when” they become available to raid they do so by giving their all.
---
I think this is going to be a colossal issue when Classic releases. Many small things are going to be way off, maybe even a few big ones.
---
Awesome work so far! I like the ring / trinket orientation. I think StaySafeTV was checking this website out on stream today.
---
You might want to include some kind of loading animation, at times I'm not sure if anything is happening
---
He’s one of the first users I’ve met on reddit with a negative overall karma score O.o
---
Yeah, that’s a question, although I admit that it hints at my opinion on the matter. Still no disrespect there. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Kargoz, countdown to Classic podcast and Ohhgee.
---
Late August early September.
---
Yeah, no. A private server can do that.
---
I created this site mostly as a joke in the vein of many other is\_\_\_yet style websites, but also to provide a little countdown to the target range of Summer 2019. I'll update it when we get a more exact date.
---
A mage was popular for Strat to take care of That Trash Mob
---
I had like 500 screenshots from vanilla and tbc... all lost because my HDD died. 
---
It was a time that back up was not a norm, and the ratio $ per GB was high for USB sticks. RIP my beloved SS's :\_(
---
That’s pretty cool. Real 2004 stuff.
---
Interesting, thanks for this tool! I'm a bit curious, is it pure html/css/js ?
---
Because you can’t give up anything for it. All the other talents are far superior until Naxx.
---
What about elevensies?
---
I would just play it safe man and put it in August or September.  You've got a much higher chance of actually being able to play classic during your vacation (even if its been out for a week or two) than risking it earlier and having it not out yet.
---
shaman or warrior with sulfuras is much more terrifying than a paladin with it.
---
Yup. The only race I hate almost as much as pandas. MSG were horrible.
---
Is this what happens with vacation in America? I CBA just book whenever I want off and have a normal office.job.
---
Sunwell trash ?
---
Owl 10-60.
---
Just quit 💁🏼‍♂️
---
&gt; Trash between emps and cthun is worst trash in the game.
---
You can skip quite a bit of that, if you dont want to kill everything for keys.
---
basically i have narrowed it down to two choices: warlock or shaman. warlock is the safe bet eventually i might be able to get atiesh in phase 6. 
---
however i have always wanted to run an enhance shaman with sulfuras in pvp. i realize i will def be healing in raids tho unless i come across a nightfall for my guild.
---
i only have time for one tho since i have a life now. should i play warlock for the safe bet on finding a raid spot? or take a risk with the shaman?
---
Kudos for the detailed post, saving it.
---
Is it? How is it the best since Blizzard release stuff when it's done. So it could easily be pushed back and you have 1000s of angry players with "ruined" vacations because they wanted Blizzard to set a release date too early.
---
Uhm, the question is another. Why isn't Undercity the main HUB?
---
They're worse than pandas IMO. I thought the Panda stuff was handled about as well as it could have been, although definitely a questionable decision, it's not like they didn't have at least something to go off of what with Chen... Whereas the Draenai it's like they just said fuck it, we're gonna fuck around with everything so we can give alliance an "ugly" race and make more money. God it was stupid. 
---
Don't get me wrong, there's definitely some problems with the Pandaren too, but at least they sort of could exist within the world of Azeroth. They weren't flying a god damn spaceship.
---
Summons, soul stone, healthstones, banishes, debuffs that make other casters stronger, fear is a situational CC that is generally not worth the risk in dungeons but can be used in a pinch also functions as an interesting way to interrupt a cast.
---
You’ve seen other enchanting and consumable calculator projects? Please link me one
---
Well they said they aim for Summer release, which means it can be anywhere between start of June and end of August. I would gamble July as the month of release but August is starting to seem potential candidate too..
---
This might be how it works for some employers in America, but certainly not all.  It depends on the type of job.
---
aside from warrior, BWL sets rocked. (I was a warrior)
---
This is now my Discord profile picture :) gret job, thank you!
---
Yea I think version 2 will categorize them better, thanks for the input
---
Hmm yea the crystals could be added
---
Really hoping they don't pull their "Well, the last week of summer is still summer!" again.
---
Hey man. 
---
The rogue bis is wrong in some phases. 
---
1st phase the 14 agi boe gun is better than xbow. Satyrs beats it though in phase 2. 
---
In phase 4, ful bloodfang isn’t BiS. In fact, you’d want to use Nightslayer Shoulders, Boots of the Shadow Flame and Kazzak gloves (2nd bis Nightslayer Gloves). 
---
Furthermore, Baron cloak is still better than Cloak of Firemaw. Puissant cape from azuregos is bis. 
---
Phase 5 you want badge trinket instead of jom gabbar. 
---
Phase 6 you want c’thun belt and skeram cloak instead of t3 belt and sapphiron cloak. You also want to have the gun from Nerubian.
---
Quit and become pro streamer
---
Alexensual and OHHGEE are the best. Kargoz has  the best general guides too
---
I may be biased because I've played a rogue from the start, but Bloodfang is one of my favorite sets and you did a great job on it :D
---
I played Paladin on a private server and all I did was spam downranked Flash of Light non-stop. I think it was rank 3 or 4. Used higher rank when needed on tanks and timed Holy Lights. Divine Favor + Holy Shock was kinda like an oh shit button.
---
I can.. hit things with hammers. Really hard.
---
The biggest issue with tanking is dps not focus firing the initial tank target. Particularly at the beginning of a pull, everyone cant just start attacking separate targets. Particularly for warrior tanks.  The trick to multi target tanking is building a nice base of threat on the initial target then tab targeting through the rest. This keeps aggro off the healer. Granted, 1 of the dps may pull aggro on the initial target BUT with good dps it's not that big of a deal in 5 mans. Obviously in a raid situation that isnt the case. Again, the important thing here is focus firing on the initial target and, as a tank, knowing your tool kit to maximize threat generation quickly
---
I think he meant stv is in eastern kingdoms, not in kalimdor
---
Good job dude, thank you for this!
---
Genius! Let's all do it haha
---
The look you give all your engineers when you sacrifice a succubus in the raid
---
\-F you guys don't you bring her back again
---
Warlock is one of the most boring classes to play in PvE. Why make it even more boring with that macro? I mean, it's kind of a nobrainer class.
---
Imo it wouldn't hurt if those macros didn't work in classic. 
---
I remember a hunter macro im TBC, that you would spam to cast Steady Shot and auto attack - so it wouldn't clip the auto attacks. Those macros make sense, as it is used to increase the DPS, instead of making a class boring.
---
I feel you too. I’m burning myself out on the anticipation. I’m afraid I might lose interest after couple of months as I wont be able to build on the hype anymore! :(
---
Amazing. Thank you for work.
---
Is this also true for the MT? I played warrior back in vanilla but never got to tank a raid, only ever did UBRS.
---
Fear Ward. Dwarf Priest. 
---
Kind of annoyed, I want to play Human but how do you pass up Fear Ward?
---
Yeah, but Classic is using a reduced loop for spell batching, which means that it shouldn't be nearly as bad as BFA when it comes to this.  
---
More likely than not, if Blizzard keeps server populations limited to 2-2.5k, (which so many are hoping for), than we should still get those big battles, but with far less lag than in retail.
---
Correct.
---
God, do you really have to go somewhere warm and sunny to relax on your vacation? I would say tone is quite disrespecting yes? And yes I will use portion of my vacation from work to just play the game. One of the many reasons being during regular work days I won't have that much time to spend playing and I do not want to get stuck with the masses on the early leveling zones.
---
In dungeons like strath or ubers I would always put two quick sunders on the initial target, then sunder all secondary targets until the first dropped aggro.  Then I would taunt that target back and reapply sunders until it stuck.
---
It was a crude way of doing things, but always relied on the group focusing the first specific target.  At earlier levels though warriors don't generate enough threat to keep up.  Especially when dealing with at-level dungeons dps must 100% wait at least 10 seconds to start dps, and even then ramp up slowly.  Depending on the tanks gear healers can loose a lot of mana before meeting even that minimum requirement.
---
I can appreciate your point of view and obviously there is downsides to having a huge influx of a certain group into one server. 
---
I think at the end of the day people will play where they like, but it would be nice to get a few dozen guys from here who may not necessarily have friends to join a server with yet
---
Only Orgimmar had AH at first, then when they added one to each city they were not linked to each other until later.
---
&gt; Lok'amir
---
Do priests generally want it too?
---
...and the feeling of finding that guy fighting 3 mobs, at half health, and then 4 other people he was messing with jumping on the chance with me, and even when he kills 3 of us AND the mobs, that one... final blow... and he drops! VICTORY!!!  
---
(Then we hearth out).
---
Its the same for druid. I tanked most of the dungeons up to level 40 and aslong as people only attack my main target everything is fine. But especially mages tend to do some stupid dps shit and then run around circles because they pulled aggro.
---
My work requires that we put in for time off at least 6 months in advance, but I dont see any reason as to why I cant take 1-2 days off with 2-4 months notice. If I get denied, I'll just call in sick. Idgaf, they literally can't fire me, I'm too important.
---
do we know sharding will be in the starting zones?
---
Yeah I will be rolling PVP. I can see it now, post goes up on reddit about ganking in south shore, 15 minutes later a whole influx of players for world PvP
---
nah nah nah... nah... nah nah nah... nah... hey, hey, hey, good-bye!
---
Why can’t I go hunter or lock for my first char? Would be so much simpler after 10 lol I just hate myself I guess but warrior is life.
---
(just starting the trash talking)
---
And no alliance to play with 😂
---
I will lose my shit if they pull that yet again lol.
---
mmhmm
---
FYI: warriors prior to the 2.0.1 rage normalization
---
Please stop murdering my druid I have no rage to do flip.
---
Hey here I'm here attack me I need the rage, don't ignore me.
---
Oh well at least we can get some tenderized venison ...
---
Ah, got it. Thanks.
---
Yeah I will give you a few weeks advance notice and you can choose a server with the furthest distance apart
---
Wow you all really seem to feel butthurt by a simple question that is challenging your opinion. Do as you like and I do as I like. Cool? Cool.
---
Was this with a warlock and invis potions? A guy in my guild kept going on about it, but we never tried it. Without trash skipping that stretch is easily an hour or more for an average guild, of just trash
---
You either farm lvl 50's in world, or in AV once that opens, and they inevitably join in, hoping for free HP/rank
---
No enh shaman, I feel attacked
---
10-14 days played is a decent time for super casual but informed leveling. Any longer and you’re either messing around a lot(professions, trading constantly etc) or just not leveling very optimally at all.
---
lasts only 2 minutes. You won't get much done with that short of a duration sadly
---
The greatest server collaboration of our time . Dear lawd
---
But what if you’re a horde?
---
I seem to recall a bug that would let your demon stay alive *and* get you the buff.
---
..something about having a paladin casting Divine Shield on the demon before you sacrifice it.. or something.
---
Fair enough. Maybe I am getting ahead of myself. If I was to join a guild now, no one knows who of the other members even stick it out to release, or better yet get to level 60.
---
Easy, you just trust that half the priests in the raid will be dwarf and you can go human for that sweet spirit.
---
FW only matters in like 8 fights, but it does rock in those fights.  But every priest needn’t be a dwarf.
---
I just want you to know that you aren't alone in your need to put the limited free time to good use (hence reducing the amount of corpse runs).
---
Nice work!
---
Hell no, they shouldn't plan around Retail at all. The two has nothing to do with each other, sorry.
---
Let's hope you get to enjoy the game to the fullest anyway!
---
I found my Classic levelmate while practicing a bit on my pserver. We’re leveling the classes we plan to play in Classic together in order to develop pvp synergy to defend us and other alliance against gankers come Classic. 
---
It’s not for everyone, but it’s a good way to find likeminded people before launch
---
Really strange, do you have more info about it ? all the site is static and work with his own data (no external api call etc.. exept for google analytics)
---
I've also thought about this, and I feel it's a legit concern.
---
i was a hunter twink for the 19 ( 29 ) bracket . hands down the pet i used the most was the boar  .  you want to get a rogue of your ass a boar chain charging and stunning him is pure joy ( with the aid of traps ) .
---
Easy way to fix that would be to apply a weakening debuff. Something like rez sickness if you earn more than 2/3 DHK's in 15 minutes. Complete with gear damage penalties.
---
The main ones that I watch are Kargoz, Madseason, and Frostadamus. I just found platinum yesterday, and while he’s a little less popular his videos are hilarious.
---
I'm not sure how it will be on Classic, but yes you can use invis pots to get past the trash between Twin Emps and Ouro. In 1.11 (Naxx) they added a teleporter in AQ so you could TP to the twins room after killing them and more importantly, to the CT room after killing Ouro. So you can use the invis pots to get past the trash to Ouro, then camp out and use the teleporter to C'thun's room, thereby skipping all the trash between Twin Emp and CT.
---
and they break all crowd control if they are left on autocast. Keep that in mind and adjust your pet skills accordingly for every situation
---
I wanna see this. He’s just become so unlikeable after Blizzard banned him :/
---
3 lvl 50's &gt; 1 lvl 60, if that lvl 60 is in 50's blues/greens...
---
thanks for the missing wand, i'll fix it asap !
---
The funniest was when a group of them would buff you up, then run you off the edge - ya had to laugh about it!
---
On private servers it's usually tanks, but healers can be hard too. However, on ND for some reason there's like a bajillion healers and getting a spot is really hard. I doubt this will carry over to Classic though.
---
addendum
---
on wolves you can still get ones with a 1.2 attack speed to bridge PvP and PvE. That's not as as good as broken tooth with the famous 1 sec attack speed and the stealth utility, but still a good compromise before you start to hunt down the perfect fits. Not to mention that a lot of the generic cats have a 2 sec attack speed just like most default pets. So be careful with your pick there
---
I said the trash in AQ40, then you say that the trash in AQ40 gets worse. It seems we agree.
---
Because you don't care about retail doesn't mean they don't have anything to do with each other.
---
They have everything to do with each other and Blizzard will not compete with it's own game.
---
Now are almost all of the stormcloaks dead.
---
Just like most of the raid guilds did back in the day. With your MT actually doing his job instead of him getting carried by a buff
---
I wonder if this will still be the case if world buffs will have a long cooldown. I can imagine if someone pops too early and blocks all the other raids from turning in a head that they will just port to UC.
---
I thought most of those servers supported upwards of 10k players, which is why people have been asking for the 2-2.5k server size?
---
Go for September to be sure of being able to play.
---
i really hope they can get this right because the SS VS TM battles were bad but AQ event was unplayable.
---
No class, no work, grind 
---
2 are false, 1 is true
---
speculation though
---
Ah the good old shadowbolt turrets. Unchanged from classic up to late BC
---
you don't need a castsequence when a rock on your shadowbolt button also does the job ;)
---
How could you guys managed to play without keybinds?
---
11 Hours in so he is on side Missions or the worst case in one of the DLCs
---
Haha you have to tame new ones to rank up skills then when you learn teach your old faithful :)
---
Oh those annoying shadowpriests in ZG before the spider boss. They do a shadowbolt volley and MCing them really helps out. 
---
Also, MC the enemy faction and run them off cliffs or the boat.
---
I wish I could find it. I just saw it randomly in some compilation vid
---
I like it.
---
The valentines holiday gives some crazy good buff food, especially for melee. On the private servers people level alts just to stack them.
---
Yes
---
This submission has been randomly featured in /r/serendipity, a bot-driven subreddit discovery engine. More here: /r/Serendipity/comments/bbxa19/im_sorry_little_one_xpost_from_rclassicwow/
---
It was viable. People need to learn the difference between viable and optimal. Paladins were at one point, pre-1.6, better than Druid tanks due to Seal of Fury and how it worked, and druids having 160% armour rating from bear form. 
---
Paladins weren't optimal, and continued to fall off later in vanilla due to gear scaling and the removal of Seal of Fury. But they were definitely viable. Just not optimal.
---
Okay none of that was a real refutation, tell me how long it would take you to get the water totem and I will tell you why after you utter that you proved my point. Not being hostile but admitting for example the quest takes under 2 hours is plenty enough proof, especially if you are purposefully not pressing on the gas while leveling due to being on a pvp server. Calling it "speed leveling" while getting lvl 60 in 6 days is not only a ironic and contradictory, but also is a strawman and so much for world pvp when a shaman can get max in 6 days time played when world records are something like 4 or 5, and you did so as a shaman.
---
Disclaimer, not trying to be hostile or angry. I am just calling it like I see it. 6 days played isn't speed leveling but 45 minutes to an hour or maybe 2 to get an incredible totem that is a force multiplier is power gaming, I am we live in a haunkted clown world.
---
Jepp. BIG SHOULDERS!
---
Agreed. If you "burned yourself out" on a private server, you would have "burned out" on classic just the same, within a month or two. This will happen to lots of people come release, and is perfectly fine.
---
Until blood elves enter the game and look 10x better 😎
---
&gt; Shamans are stacked
---
more so than priests?
---
IMHO with summer they mean Q3. According to their financial reports and common business/economics knowdlege, Q3 in EUR/NA means July/August/September. 
---
I  don’t think that they are ready yet with the game, otherwise we would have more information. Taking into account that most people go on vacation in August (in Europe), my best bet is late August/early September as release date. This would give them another 4 months of time to finish the game.
---
That entitlement. It's their damn game, they will release it when they want to.
---
What odds are you willing to give me on that $100 bet? You seem pretty certain, how about 10 to 1?
---
Contact me via PM, I am a sinful man, I will take that bet.
---
This is the Rise of something new.... #YesChanges
---
Nice
---
Platinum wow
---
He made a video about right click reporting but the dude abused the right click report feature during the demo. Lmao
---
So... okay guys, we're going to hide in Elwynn Forest, killing boars...
---
I mean, I have taken a handful, mostly of chat, for proof/reporting purposes. And a group picture after getting a Thunderfury is great for guild morale. But yeah, won't do thousands of selfies for sure.

[https://classicdb.ch/?item=4556](https://classicdb.ch/?item=4556) shell fragment 9.03 silver

then you skin the lvl 49-50 mob for some amount/combination of:

---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=8169](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8169) thick hide           5 silver each
---
those are just vendor prices, it wouldn't be unheard of to kill a turtle, get a shell fragment and a clam with pearl, then skin it for 2 turtle scales and maybe a rugged leather if the loot tables had multi item skins like in PS.
---
that would be at least 15 silver in a single loot.
---
The reason I mention hunters is you need high efficiency/speed killing single targets, they are hard to gather for aoe IIRC and also hit relatively hard. So shadow priests, warlocks, hunters, maybe rogues or warriors who outlevel and bring lots of bandages can get some serious work done.
---
If you want to solo target grind these as a caster you could probably invest 30-50 gold in spirit/sp or spirit/int gear and see good gains based on how many levels you grind them.
---
Yeah, I know (that’s why I called it ”Lost Man’s Cave” since he has lost his mind and is on the verge of insanity. Didn’t want it to be too obvious (I know nessingwary camp is called ”Apocalypse Now”, but that was just because that place was known to be a phenomenal ganking spot. So I just named it that way for comical effect) But I get what you mean :)
---
You seem to be mistaking "very helpful" with "I'm actually going to make regular use of this". I come across all manner of "very helpful" things in my everyday life and I commend the spirit in which they were developed however, like this website, I'll probably never use it again.
---
Chill, not everything has to be a binary between ideal and useless. Some stuff is just "very helpful" or "pretty cool".
---
Do it months/years before the release and make a 10:05 min video every single time blizzard makes a new post.
---
Yes, you turn off your pet's attack in the macro.  
---
I have a macro that will use Freeze Trap if you're not in combat, and if you are in combat, it will turn off your pet's attack, feign death and freezetrap.  
---
Very good, one button to rule them all.
---
There are dozens of us, dozens!
---
Think that was added in TBC
---
My expectiations are somewhere between 180 - 200 hours gametime, based on my own experience of leveling. With work and irl stuff, I figure I'll have 1 week off from work and then play 4-5 hours per day for another 2 weeks.
---
So in total, I expect to hit 60 on my UD mage after about 3 weeks post launch.
---
I for one am excited to see the Barrens reunited into one big ~~cesspool~~ landmass of trash talk about my mother and the power of Chuck Norris.
---
Came to say this as well. I didn't need this kind of personal attack in the morning.
---
You can barely even counter-gank a 40 rogue. Smart positioning and master of deception will beat out randomly running around looking for a rogue 9 times outta 10. All the rogue needs is a little patience while countergank squad rolls through.
---
And if he can get a bunch of people hunting for him while he afk’s in a bush, that’s successful trolling.
---
Ye, I know but atm there's no info covering that part. As soon as Blizzard tells us whether or not the 1.10 itemization will be there from start, I'll update the sheet.
---
BiS for stage 1 (with raid) is pretty much the same as stage 2 because there is no raid launch on stage 2. Only case is when BiS for stage 2 use a Dire Maul loot, then you need take the pre raid bis stage 1 instead
---
The best kind of utility.
---
As for druids having a hard time finding a spot, that'll not be the case. On the contrary. They're high in demand and low in supply. Plus side: easier to gear since you'll only compete against usually 2 others for tiers. Fun unique playstyle when you figure out your strengths and weaknesses, including in pvp. And stealth is just so nice to have throughout the game. But if pve raid healing is all you're concerned with, I would say shaman, a good totem twister contributes to raid dps massively.
---
The sheet covers viable speccs. The subject has been discussed plenty of times before. Browse through the discussions below.
---
Love it! Would love to see more like this.
---
Not cool. Don't make me get my main.
---
just about thunderfury (and all legendary), there are purposely ignored because of their difficulty to get, same things for items like ironfoe
---
I've got an army of ants in my pants over the lack of a release date.  
---
This site is a good laugh. Thumbs up.  
---
@blizz: God damn it, announce something already!.. Soon^(TM) was almost better than this...
---
I'd rather see proper discussion/speculation posts about what they will do after the last content Phase than seeing the same old, boring memes, "remember this?" posts and shitty questions like "what class should I play?" posted for hundreds of times. Again.
---
I can ignore your whispers for conjoured consumables and portals really well.
---
5-7 days are way too much for speedrunners.  
---
Joana's WR is 4Days 20Hours, and that was in Vanilla, a loooong time ago.  
---
He said that he has updated his route, and can do it much faster now.
---
The biggest negative for me is the itemization. Furys basically only need rare epic drops and since the spec is more popular today there is going to be a harsh competition. Tier sets (except the t1 gloves/t2.5 shoulders) have no use for you and you have to battle yourself constantly with rouges for weapons. Apart from the fact that warriors need alot of gold to get BiS gear (devilsaurs, lionheart helmet, edgemasters), we are talking about  \~2 epic mounts. Running around in blue leather gear till late bwl and aq is kinda eww.
---
The upside is that this spec has by far the most fun and dynamic melee playstyle imo.
---
They just need alot of love and time dedication, but the reward is mostly worth it.
---
I just sometimes throw an eye on other classes that get easy and good tier sets for example Hunter. 
---
Another negative is that warriors can barely do anything solo in this game, be it pvp or pve (not too much of a problem since this is an mmo). This makes you pretty reliant on a good guild or friends/healers to play with. 
---
Ranking PVP as a horde warrior is a pain in the ass, because you need healers to be of any use and horde basically has 0 other than in that 1 Premade where the warrior spots are defended like a thrown of the roman empire.
---
I do to - I wasn't able to join either one of those "events" when they were running. (I was "Oceanic" before oceanic servers was a thing).
---
Yes. As a elemental shaman main for 12 years. Its hurts to reroll to mage.
---
But on the level of PvE progression I want to be. There is no place for ele shamans.
---
Serieus raiding &gt; My favorite class
---
Dps &gt; Healing
---
Deathwing didn't destroy the Barrens, it was simply Chuck Norris getting his revenge.
---
Do we know wether there will be the oldschool way of signing up for a BG or if it will be battlemasters in each city?
---
Rogue. 
---
Stealth. Enough said really. 
---
Enjoyed my time during vanilla as a rogue and was lucky to get into a decent guild at the right time. 
---
Had some real fun farming dungeons with another Rogue or Druid. Ganking in major cities, wpvp ruining people’s day and lockpicking can make some gold on a boring day in IF. 
---
Overall a fun class to play at 60 and a top DPS class. Unfortunately very popular. 
---
Will play something else this time around for a change.
---
Quite easily. There's likely going to be 4+ priests in your raid, chances are 2 will already be Dwarves. If not, Tank can dance.
---
The horde manage just fine without fear ward, it's a crutch.
---
What is sub?  Getting back into the game after a long while and I don't think I've ever heard this term.
---
Makes sense, though they are all arguably easier to get than KT loot.
---
&gt;BiS for stage 1 (with raid) are pretty much the same as stage 2 because  there is no raid launch on stage 2. The only wrong case is when BiS for stage 2 use a Dire Maul loot, then you need to take the pre raid bis  stage 1 instead
---
it's on my todo list ! i know synchronous call are ugly and i will change it asap
---
Actually thinking about a mage. My only real consern is that there will be too many mages on the server. Do you think that's a solid consern or should I not worry about that?
---
...phase #7
---
I think I lost all my vanilla and BC screenshots, I only have WotLK left. :(
---
Yea 3-4 priests and 5-8 shamans is not unusual.
---
 Very good, one button to rule them all. 
---
Classic hunter gameplay :P
---
This definitely need more upvotes
---
Great design and idea m/
---
I don’t really side one way or the other, I currently have both but play more alliance. I was alliance in vanilla and love hanging around ironforge but for the sake of something different I’ll probably go horde this time
---
Wanted to go horde but my friend and his guild is going alliance soooo...
---
I still think the theory about a July 16th release date could be true, it's bound to be out before mid-August.
---
&gt;react js
---
Thank you, that's very informative!
---
Only degenerates play Horde.
---
Stay strong brother, we wont stand for this blatant typecasting and discrimination against us.
---
Downvoted and reported. Where’s the Death Knight section. I’ve been playing a demon hunter since beta so I know they should be on there.
---
 Where I live summer time is considered being in-between June 21 and September 23. I based my earlier definition of summer on meteorological seasons. I do agree that they probably meant the Q3 probably meaning September is on the table too. Late August/early September seem quite likely at this point.
---
I want to like this twice. Also, I want an "event" that destroys the portal, preventing TBC from ever happening. Then re-launch Karazhan, Mt. Hyjal, bring SSC over to the whirlpool in the center of the map (where she belongs)....  
---
Best of all, avoid introducing the blue space aliens and kung-fu panda's. Trash flying mounts too.  
---
...But Northrend would be super awesome! I'd even be ok with the Sunwell Plateau making a come-back.  
---
But make it new. Fresh. A different story, with different outcomes and different events. And yes, fewer races and none of the silly sh\*t you mention.
---
If you play a tank, you will always miss a healer. I play a healer and always miss a tank.
---
Generally though, pretty much every warrior can tank 5-mans even in wrong spec, same goes for healing. You do need the gear for the offspec though.
---
Haha well I actually think Hunters have enough buttons to use :P  
---
Except while leveling of course, where only use a couple abilities  
---
But I found no need to have both FreezeTrap and Freeze/FD Macro on the bar, when I can create a macro like that.
---
No like?
---
Back in vanilla, there was a script as a paladin that made you decurse the people closest around you. This was Before decursive became big. and i could not play without it.
---
It’s really not that hard on rogue.
---
Is that &lt;Brutality&gt; from Burning Blade/Grim Batol?
---
BLIZZ PLS CHANGES! NO WPVP IN MY MMO!
---
Sir, you must be a rogue main with these mad skillz
---
Unless you've actually been pocketing a bunch of int gear while you've been leveling. Healing isn't possible as a Paladin until 20. Flash of Light is literally what allows you to be a healer.
---
After that, you can pretty much either level as Holy. Which is one of the most excruciatingly painful ordeals you can put yourself through. Or level as Ret or Reckadin, and heal when you get Blessing of Light.
---
In spite of that, Paladins are arguably the best healers in the game, but you'll be relegated to pressing the same two keys for your entire raid. So if you're fine with that, then you know which path to go.
---
Hehe thanks mate!
---
&gt; While it’s agreed that Engineering is a must-have for everyone...
---
Well, for DPS and tanks, yeah. Healers, not so much.
---
There is a lot to think about professions, if you are a officer in raiding guild enchanting can be a VERY profitable profession (if you can get raid enchant drops). Skinning &amp; LW early on is super simple to levelup without ANY cost to maximum level. Get a steady gold income from transmuting salts. You could just skip tailoring on main ( i know the robe is pretty insane, but strat UD robe isnt too shabby either ). For grinding purposes, cant beat herbalism/enchanting in stage II start. If you want to do 2man DME runs with a warrior(maybe a druid), herbalism in doing that makes a world of difference. You want to have mining, herbalism and enchanting between you two.
---
I dont think engineering is that important for a priest, you can always just spam holy nova in those wPVP/aoe situations, especially on a PVE server.
---
So if you get raid enchants, start with enchanting and skinning. You want to levelup the enchanting for the guild as fast as possible. If not, then go for herb+skinning or LW+skinning. And offload everything else on alt (if you want to). In the end you want a filled out account with at least L35 chars that all have dual transmute professions. And then choose your main professions per what gives it the most in actual improvement / grind potential (if you dont have a mage grind alt).
---
Shame, i'm looing for a Horde PVEserver guild with this kind of mentality but no succes so far. I guess i'll just play and will try to find one in game.
---
Anyway Good luck to you with  the guild  and HF !
---
I dont remember sunwell trash being that bad?  They also I think dropped some okay-ish items?  Then again I was playing a hunter so I liked pulling and if not pulling just put on music, assist MA, and chill.
---
Subtelty. There is a talent which allow you to sap and sometimes remain stealthed (30%/60%/90%).
---
1 kg of what?
---
Hopefully.  Late august/early september sounds better to be than July.  Already taking a bit more than a week off in early July for a vacation so need a bit of time inbetween before I take another 1-2 weeks off ...
---
You can skip STV entirely.
---
what daggers are those?
---
Anyone not named Tip
---
So I sit here reading a thread that is basically just people that are dying to get release as soon as possible, meanwhile I'll be working outside my country (and thus without my computer) until the end of July. I think I'm literally the only person on this subreddit that actually hopes for *post-*July release.
---
Love this! Thank you
---
Until you get an induction heater, at which point it boils so quickly you forget what the fuck you even need boiling water for
---
I know exactly what you’re talking about! I’ll start digging as well.
---
BY THE LIGHT OF ELUNE!?
---
Tone it down there neckbeard
---
The trash was hard as fuck. I remember entering the instance, a competent raiding guild would almost certainly wipe at first pull. Not that someone died, the whole raid wiped (unless you managed to run out).
---
Awesome site! Thanks for your hard work! I saw that for items that have random bonuses attributed to them like the engineering head Green Lens for mages, there is no reference to what the desired roll of stats should be.
---
 Obviously if one already has this knowledge one would figure that it is Of Frozen Wrath for frost mages but because your site is so accessible I figured it caters to an inexperienced crowd as well. Just my thoughts, great guide otherwise! Will send to my friends for Classic!
---
 I prefer Alliance but play Horde as well.. my working friends, that I will play with, are going Horde. So I have to do that as well. But I will create all classes, races on both sides but will main Horde
---
So you can put fossilized trees in your car, nice.
---
Or meaby one from Moonglade EU? (I was part of that one in TBC for some time :D)
---
Is Humar identical to the White one in the Barrens?
---
Need a healer behind the warrior to be accurate.
---
Humans couldn't be hunters till cata though, so you are probably misremembering something.
---
Definitely tanks, played on Pservers only and you can bet your ass that if you are a clothy and need a tank for ST, you won't find even half cause obvious reasons
---
Ret DPS is tolerable in TBC (not great still) and good in WotLK.
---
I was plodding along on my level 12 Dwarf Warrior when I saw them. Bastards killed the flight master.
---
&gt; Was this with a warlock and invis potions? 
---
No, you can skip like, i think 3-4 patrol packs by going around them from the left. Just need to know the patrol routes. Only attacking the last patrol when the bigger room becomes a tighter cave going up.
---
1k g*
---
Druids have more CC in TBC, which allows warriors to be more capable of getting to their target.
---
I am reading all of these posts and thinking the same thing. Y'all want to take a vacation to play a video game from your childhood not realising that it's probably not going to be like you think it is, because of nostalgia. I feel sorry for the guys, i think most of them will take a couple of days of, play the game for some time, and realise it's not worth using up your friggin vacation for it 😬
---
Uhm that's how it works in most jobs, not just America? What kind of job do you work where you can just leave without a few months or weeks notice?
---
I've never heard of a job where you didn't have a deadline for which you had to say when you wanted your vacation.
---
Fire Resistance has no place in a BiS list. You should hold on to additional items with FR, and equip as much as needed. This has nothing to do with private servers, nice try though.
---
Luckly i have still all my Screenshots from Vanilla til beginning of WOTLK (around 1.5k ) and looking at them bring so many memories.
---
Actually this isn't the case I believe. The auction house systems were originally unlinked  and city specific. I believe they found it to be too bothersome for the players so they removed every AH but IF and ORG. Then they re-added the other cities and conected them. This all happened during Vanilla's timespan IIRC
---
I had the same case and I still got that mouse laying around somewhere!
---
I know what he meant, I was just trying to be funny, and was waiting for a funny answer. Guess not
---
Ok, so you just want to argue. GL with that.
---
[World of Warcraft: Looking for Group Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyPzTywUBsQ) ?
---
looking for group documentary?
---
When you say 3 weeks in game, you mean 21 days /played? Because the actual vanilla record was under 5 days, an normal player would get 2 characters to 60 while dicking around in 21 days.
---
That's not farming tho. In farming you do something hundreds or thousands of times, not 2 times?
---
Try it man! :D JUST DO IT :D
---
no one used keybinds back then lol. Look at all these screenshots posted on the sub. it was horrible, but it was the norm
---
&gt;pretty sure thats when the Talent system became the 6 tier pick 3 bullshit that it is
---
No, we still had the old talent system in all of Cata. Also, I feel like most of what made Cata such a bad experience for you were not the actual game - you say it yourself, your friends stopped playing and you didn't find a good guild. You essentially lost the social bonds of an MMO and didn't find some new ones.
---
Yes, Cata had its share of problems, but honestly most of the problems were things from the second half of WotLK. I mean, for gods sake - one of the main reasons Cata got hated is that dungeons got tuned harder (as the community kept asking for) and then PuG didn't work anymore because people were not used to wiping, they were used to AFK through stuff. Another big complain is how they removed the old world, but that was not a problem back then. Now it is because we miss it, but back then people were bored of it and generally liked the new questing.
---
Just saying, people glorify WotLK a bit too much and hate on Cata a bit blindly. Half the reasons people give to hate Cata are (lik with you) because you remember wrongly.
---
The one thing I hope for is that Ironfoe has a proc% that makes it reasonably powerful, not broken beyond belief. Even if it really was &gt;5% in vanilla 1.12 - no one has to know. Same for ED.
---
They will literally compete with their own game once Classic drops...
---
Scourge Invasion is confirmed?
---
I've always mained a mage, so I'll do it again in Classic.
---
But yeah... I think there is going to be plenty of competition for mages.
---
I don't worry too much about it though, as there is plently of difference between a good and a shitty mage. And good guild will know the difference :)
---
Now this is classic!
---
 I will try to answer the most asked questions here :
---
* about the data from the list and items you think are wrong, go to [u/pingaan](https://www.reddit.com/user/pingaan) reddit post about his spreedsheets ([link to his reddit post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/asfpne/bislist_for_every_stage_release_naxxramasall/))  and speak your voice here, i won't personnaly make change on my own  because that is not my field of expertise, i entirely rely on his  spreedsheets and he told me there were already lots of discussion about  some of your points on his reddit post, so go check it !
---
* i  see a lot of people asking for some missing spec (ret, tankladin,  boomkin, enhancement ...), i personnaly don't hate you, i just don't  have the data for them ! if you can pm me a good spreedsheets, i could  add it !
---
* i  totally agree with adding race filter (mostly for melee because it will  change weapons - like axe for orc etc..), it is on my todo list
---
* about  the drop location on tooltip, if you check closely different one, some  have it and some doesnt. It all depend of wowhead (tooltip come from  there), if they doesnt provide me the information on the item, it will  simply be too much work to add it manually on each item i'm afraid ...
---
* dressing  room is on my todo list too, i havent decided if i just make a link to  wowhead one (but it has retail model so i dont like it .. maybe they  will update it for classic !) or if i make my own static screenshot on  my own with old vanilla model, anyway i will do it later when bis list  will be polished and more stable because redo the screenshot everytime i  change an item will be too painfull
---
* bis list will be update every time we learn more about classic itemization
---
* adding a loading animation and change the synchronous loading to an asynchronous one is on my todo list
---
Todo list :
---
* adding RF/RN/RO set
---
* adding more spec if possible (ret, tankladin, boomkin, enhancement ...) or playstyle (TPS set for tank etc..)
---
* dressing room
---
* loading animation with asynchronous call
---
Already fixed since launch :
---
* adding a wand to Holy Priest stage 1
---
* adding idols/relics/totems on druid/paladin/shaman on stage 5
---
&gt;Also think about the things that you'd be feeling like you'd have to be doing a couple months into Classic releasing
---
Gotcha, leaving my life and cancelling my gym membership today.
---
It was a different time back then, we're all a lot older now, and i think we should let things evolve into whatever the playerbase want to see in Barrens Chat - and not force old jokes just for the sake of nostalgia.
---
&gt;i asked the owner of the spreedsheets from where i take the data for this, he said there is sadly no better option on stage 1, spriest stats is Hit &gt; dmg &gt; mp5, so this trinket is just for the mp5 until pre raid phase 2
---
Modern WoW *is* pretty. They nailed that cartoonish style to still work. Still,
---
&gt;Detail and genuine artistry cannot detract anything from a game  
---
&gt;New looks would help too.
---
It most certainly can when it is a remake of a game that have already been. I've played on pservers and the old graphics adds so much feeling to the game. Yes, this is obviously only because of nostalgia, but I don't see how that is a problem. I played vanilla on pservers for years and never got tired of the graphics, if anything modern would ruin the feeling for me. People want Classic because of the feeling of the game, and graphics are a big part of that.
---
So no, new looks would *not* help. Just because *you* don't feel that way doesn't mean everyone else does, but you seems to *deny* other peoples opinions as if they are wrong. Who are you to decide whether or not graphics actually change my experience?
---
Disclaimer: I don't care if there is a toggle so you can get your game pretty, as long as I don't see it. This is not one of those "no one can have graphicssss!" replies, but you dismiss people for wanting old graphics and that is wrong.
---
It's the one in the middle
---
Exactly why I’m going warlock and not rogue.
---
the best kind of server!
---
Dire Maul wont even be out for a while though. Why do some of these BiS lists take DM loot into account?
---
Love the set up and easy of use though!
---
Fluoride =/= [Gay frogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBbkwlGM7X0)
---
This happens on some pservers (not all) who have incorrect working of the reflector in that it reflects projectile spells that have already cast but not reached the target.
---
It will be very hard to reflect pom pyro when you need to anticipate it and also have the mage cast pom pyro even after they see you have activated the reflector.
---
Min max was definitely in the vanilla game. You could probably be able to play your offspecc once content is in farm mode. But progress? Wouldn't bet on that.
---
If you’re reliable and do what you need to be relevant with pots etc, then most guilds other than those rushing progression will usually bring 1 along for OT capabilities
---
Flouride =/= [Atrazine](https://youtu.be/nBbkwlGM7X0?t=203)
---
Yes and no. They're on the same sub so it's not a competition for players. But it's unwise to release Classic the same time a huge content update is released for retail.
---
Blizzard knows this and have never released two big games or updates at the same time.
---
September 21st is the last day of Summer. Watch it happen.
---
I work as a Chef in a small kitchen team where two people can't be off at the same time and we need to let them know a month in advance. But generally most people I know could ring on that day and ask for a days annual leave
---
If you're willing to put in the extra work, feral DPS is viable. But you're going to be farming Gnomeregan quite a lot.
---
Casual raiding guilds will probably take you regardless, depends where you land.
---
UK here, can book tomorrow off if I feel like. Enjoy your capitalist hell hole.
---
Had a mage that would slow fall us on fallen avatar. It was always random who he would pick (normally the top dps) and they’d get mad about their log, click it off without thinking, and fall to their death. Was always pretty funny.
---
It has nothing to do with the country. It has to do with the type of job.
---
Feasible but needs lots of commitment. 
---
You’ll have to fight again the prejudice, that feral is bad however.
---
But if your raid leaders is open minded and that you pull the number, that’s fine (requires consumable, power shifting, etc)
---
If you don’y have time to commit to this, then don’t do it. Feral has already a bad image...
---
Found Shia LaBeouf
---
Hearthstone to kargath. Mount. Go
---
The capitalist hell hole of Denmark? Dude, i guarantee you we have better rights for workers than you do. I literally can't think of a country with better workers rights than us.
---
If you can book tomorrow off thats because you work a job that allows it, where you're not crucial. Like can doctors in the UK take vacation anytime they want? Of course fucking not.
---
Some people are into necrophilia
---
Ye I was being a prick cause I'm in a mood. You definitely have better rights than us. Ammended my comment anyways
---
Er det flere enn meg som gleder seg til wow classic?  
---
Nå som release nærmer seg med stormskritt har vi satt opp en egen discord server for nordmenn som har planer om å spille classic.Vi har nå bikket 100 medlemmer og planen for de fleste er å spille på samme server ved lansering.  
---
Tre enkle regler:
---
1. Snakk norsk
---
2. Hold det WoW Classic-relatert
---
3. Hold en god tone i chat  
---
Her er linken til wow classic Norge: [https://discord.gg/8fRvk5W](https://discord.gg/8fRvk5W)  
---
Del gjerne linken med venner og bekjente :)
---
You don't need to stack a ton, even having like 20-30 resistance is enough to get 1 or 2 lucky resists often enough to flip the tables. Even the shadow resistance from tier sets is enough. That's why having some penetration is so good for pvp, they remove the small amount of resistance people have that really fucks you up without it.
---
GSPP's have insane mats requirements and very high demand, they are too expensive to use. It  would be like using arcanite bombs.
---
This.  
---
I want this to be Classic.
---
When classic comes out, it should be pretty easy to find other solo people to group up with in the beginning. Maybe you'll make friends with them and if their schedule fits with yours you can plan on playing at the same time most days. Other than that, try finding a leveling guild before classic comes out, or right after.
---
hands down best looking gear in vanilla
---
Going tankless, I think 
---
* Mage (CC, AoE, kite)
---
* 3 Rogues (single target DPS, "tank", stuns/control)
---
* any healer (Paladin ideally, when things go bad)
---
would work great. Hunter/WL pet is pretty bad at controlling more than one mob, so kiting is the way to go I think, while picking off single targets one by one.
---
Yeah you’re right, forgot about that!
---
I had this problem, decided to join a BC P server. I did this in hopes it wouldn’t ruin classic for me and I could experience another expansion I wasn’t able to play.
---
Ah okay.  I did it on test server and I remember occasional wipes then but chalked it up to basically being 25 random people.  I had quit just prior to Sunwell release due to burning out on farming Illidan for months (probably only weeks or a month before Sunwell release unfortunately).  I came back the guild had just killed 3rd boss and I started twins with them and by that point we pretty much sailed through the rest relatively speaking.
---
But every class can be an engineer!
---
Nå som release nærmer seg med stormskritt har vi satt opp en egen discord server for nordmenn.  
---
Her kan du diskutere alt som er classic-relevant og samtidig finne en norsk guild eller leveling buddies.

I imagine a lot of people here will want to roll on the server the content creators they like roll on, asmongold and the classicast people are all rolling on the same server I believe.
---
I'm going to play paladin, if i don't reach level 60 before phase 2, i fear i never will :'D I will be stuck in an endless loop of ganking
---
it's a debuff, it won't be lasting longer than the mob
---
This is brilliant.
---
If you take the RP  that heavy go for it, but many people already pointed out, there aren't that many quests there to level from 1-60 straight. Do what makes the most fun for you! 
---
Especially for the first time, you should consider some more question, that's just my opinion.
---
What shitty country are you in where you can be made to take leave?
---
lobotomizer
---
Thanks. :)
---
its so far awaaaay :'(
---
Naaaah it's totally a conspiracy. I see parked SUVs outside my house every day, I know what's up. I ain't no chump. Keep being blind LOL
---
Cause they still be at the bottom of the dps meter below healers /s
---
Priests can also remove those annoying diseases from the early trash. MVP for sure.
---
spirit/mana5 builds are for healers that can downrank and go outside 5 sec rule with cast cancelling. It's pretty pointless for a dps, if you downrank or break casting your damage will just go to shit (not to mention there isn't any good dps mana/5 or spirit gear and you can't sacrifice other stats regardless without tanking your dps).  
---
  
---
There's two type of casters in vanilla. Ones that can regen mana and actually do sustained dps (mage/warlock), and ones that can't (elemental/balance/spriest). Your best bet is probably joining a super hardcore speedkill guild that can get kill times on all bosses down 40 - 60 seconds. I'd imagine ele dps might actually be ok on boss fights that last 30-40 seconds but it might be tricky to convince those guilds to take an ele shaman.
---
I was under the impression priests were the most popular healer. How do you even gear up with that many shaman, must be annoying as hell.
---
Feral DPS: it's decent if you play very well. That means powershifting, potting and overall practicing your rotation a lot, which you should be accustomed to if you've played feral in TBC (powershifting was still a thing there) and LK/Cata (peak rotation). 
---
Now there are a few downsides obviously, the two main ones being having no DPS cooldowns to shine in short encounters where rogues and warriors will blow you out of the water and having to farm MCP to maintain average DPS which is aids. 
---
That being said, every hybrid class still suffers a massive stigma from vanilla days. Now lucky for you, feral druid is the least offender and has gained a lot of popularity on private servers since the MCP trick was found. Bear tank is more and more popular because less gear dependant, more mitigation, easier threat and some cat DPS prodigies proved it can be competitive if you put in the effort. If you can prove you're really good at both during trials you'll earn a raid spot with ease. Ret pal or enh shaman on the other hand are still trash DPS no matter how much effort you put into it. 
---
A few good ressources to help you make your decision.

This.
---
good news for casual people
---
guilds wont bother with worldbuffs anymore lol
---
I can't wait to see this new DPS elemental shaman in full mp5s gear that everyone is talking out.
---
I hear that while it's extremely low on damage due to non-DPS stats on gear, it's very good at regenerating mana. This is key, because almost every boss in the game dies very quickly to players standing around it and regenerating mana.
---
Watch out guys. The new meta is here.
---
**equips Shimmering Geta**
---
Let's do some fucking damage.
---
No chance anyone in here is a fucking doctor lol. Half of them will work in retail.
---
Played on PServer recently. The game has not lost its magic at all.
---
There are 3 classes that can heal in vanilla for each faction: Druid, Priest, Shaman/Paladin. Shamans and paladins are some of the most played classes and priests are pretty common here.
---
The plan was that 3 classes can tank in vanilla per faction as well: Druid, warrior, shaman/paladin.
---
Problem is, people generally only want warrior tanks, shamans fall behind quite early and paladins struggle at higher levels. That leaves with warriors and druid, latter being the least played class. And people still prefer warrior. Warriors tend to be better geared due to more warriors tanking in raids.
---
Tanking is more stressful than healing. It is also easy to heal in a dungeon you've never been in but pretty bad experience to tank for the first time.
---
From all this you can see that tanks are on shorter supply.
---
I got no proof but, Tauren Herb ist +15 and gnome engi is +15 as start skill, so you don't start at 1 you start at 15, so its not that important after the first few hours
---
would be nice to have some alternative options besides the bis
---
like a bis1 bis2 bis3
---
Druids are the best 5man tanks in the game.

I'll be playing classic with a doctor, so i wouldn't be so sure.
---
Maybe he meant without the stress of stv?
---
Tanking isn't difficult but it is stressful. Healing can be stressful as well, in theory at least, but generally healing spells are so powerful in 5mans you never really worry about it much.
---
what about a mix/match then?
---
**Hunters:** The [Dal'rend set](https://classicdb.ch/?itemset=41) is only pre-raid bis assuming enchants, and even then, barely. Without enchants, it gives you a total of 50 AP and 1% crit. The polearm [Peacemaker](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18725) that drops in Strat gives you 56 Ap and 1% crit, and is a lot more easy to obtain as nobody except hunters should really want it. Dal'rend is only better than Peacemaker if you drop a +15 agi enchant on both of them. Compared to Peacemaker with +25 agi enchant, Dal'rend gives you a grand total of *+4 AP and 0.09% crit*. This miniscule upgrade is totally not worth the trouble of running UBRS over and over and then fighting with every warrior and rogue when the swords drop. They look cool though, and yes, *technically* they are bis. But in reality, save yourself the trouble and get Peacemaker. 
---
Also, why is [Frostbite Girdle](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14502) pre-raid bis in stage 1? It gives you 30 AP and roughly 0.28% crit from agility, while [Marksman Girdle](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22232) gives you 42 AP and 0.39% crit, as well as 1% hit (which is super valuable). This belt is also arguably better than [Warpwood Binding](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18393) from stage 2 (DM), unless you are hit capped even without Marksman Girdle. Only then is Warpwood Binding bis.
---
Or am I missing something? Are Peacemaker (Strat) and Marksman Girdle (LBRS) not obtainable in stage 1?
---
Lastly: the gear listed in stage 1 for hunters only gives you a total of 7% hit. That means you are still missing 2%, unless you have specced into Surefooted from the Survival tree, which means you have to drop a lot of other valuable talents from BM/MM. Are the [Truestrike Shoulders](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12927) (24 AP, 2% hit) from UBRS not obtainable in stage 1? Compared to Wyrmtongue Shoulders you sacrifice 22 AP and 0.43% crit (from agi), but gain the last 2% hit you need for hit cap, which is a lot more valuable than the small reduction in AP and crit.
---
You responded to me lmao. I made a statement. YOU argued. There's no argument anyways. There's a TON more variables and it's NOT battlegrounds. End of story. It's a completely different dynamic. What are you even trying to prove?
---
Stop it, you‘re scaring me.
---
Go to the doctor, he will give you the vacation :D
---
Well, you CAN make a almost automated tank/dps warriors with macros. But those are still quite simple to play without any macros, so i dont think those ppl will have any problems. But DECURSING will be interesting. Like when you need to decurse mana users, instead of spamming 1 button you need to understand who to dispell, on what order, are they in range etc... while healing/dpsing.
---
Before blizzcon announced classic wow John Staats (the guy who single single handedly designed molten core IN A WEEK) said he would eat his hat if the game was out before 2020. So yeah I think they are doing all they can, and I am amazed its coming out in a span of months!
---
So I thought this would be quite interesting for those who didn't experience it. 
---
As you can see I'm holding the Grand Marshall's Canon although I don't even have T2 shoulders! (though the helm as an Ony drop and I'm pretty sure it was a pug drop) I definitely was not a GM. 
---
I think TBC was less than a month away at this point and Blizzard changed it so that the PVP items were very easily obtained and I grinded out for the weapon.
---
Uhm...Burst of Knowledge?

How can I be burned out? I can't even decide what class to play lol

Cool site but I disagree with your definitions of the start and end of summer. It's more correct to use the solstice as the basis for the start of summer.

On N-starting private server there are fucking tons of healers compared to example vanilla. Tanks are still hard to get by (well most guys CAN tank, they just dont want to). But you can see groups where the thing they are looking for is actually (caster) DPS.
---
well to be fair they were about the worst tanks in the game UNTIL the talent rework, and by then most of them had accepted their fate as resto and didn't want to use DKP/time to go feral
---
Shamans totems are restricted to the group he's in so having a shaman in as many groups as possible is ideal.
---
For instances where theres actually drops that healers want, Tank &gt; dps &gt; heal. Shit like UBRS, healer &gt; tank &gt; dps &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; melee dps.

Lol buddy, you're asking on THIS sub why we would take PTO for a "video game"? First off, you sound like a boomer when you phrase things like that. Secondly, of course a lot of us are going to take time off for the release of Classic and that's not a strange thing at all. Getting ahead of the crowd to get to 60 is a real goal of a very big grp of people.
---
i was in a good guild but even in mc and ony we had to be handheld by the leader
---
I think its also because ppl in private servers are veterans, they usually cba to do cc on most of the stuff. Its flat out aoe dps before the tank got a single hit in. Making tanking a fucking shitshow in pugs.
---
So you are just running around trying to get something back or just say fuck it and take what you can get and ignore everything else.
---
yea it was a 'skinner only' roll
---
You forgot scare beast as well.
---
The overriding point though is that Druids have a lot more options for catching other Classes.
---
I think the only two classes that can reliably escape a Druid are hunters and rogues.
---
Hunters can trap or scare beast, feign death, and then mount.
---
Rogues can blind and vanish.

I'd like to request a BIS version of holy paladin but only uses plate please.
---
You do nature damage and will have to face nature resistance and lack of synergy with warlock debuff. For short fights mana isn't an issue. Also do note that using mp5 gear means you aren't using spell crit and spell damage gear (plus missing spell hit). And if you start stacking spirit it goes even worse.
---
Did some cultist casters grinding as ele, was nice. Elements - bad, plants for Argent Dawn turn in - bad, plant-like mobs for Greater Nature Protection potion recipe - bad due to resistances... -\_-
---
It’s more upsetting that they call this a passion project and the players are the reason they are doing this. At least give the players the respect they deserve and give us a release date. It’s our passion too.
---
You really believe servers are going to stay with 3k at all times? Damn, you are dumb.
---
in stv you could skin other peoples mobs
---
but not always cuz some bastard didnt loot it all first
---
The more mp5 gear you have the less spell crit and spell damage you will have. Aside of that for bosses you need more spell hit. Plus problems if the boss has high nature resistance. Mana as elemental isn't as such of a problem as for moonkin (although still is on non-quick-bosses).
---
They made it so the PvP gear could be bought with honor i think. People in our guild stopped raiding because PvP gave better gear easily after the changes
---
Balance is fun in classic pvp. You can get some nice starfire crits and the stun rng is usually pretty decent.
---
You have to be careful managing mana for longer fights, and learn when to swap forms. Swapping out of Moonkin to heal or into bear to grab a feral charge will quickly add up on the mana pool, similarly if taking travel form to grab more range.
---
If you can manage your mana and your range well then you will excel as a balance pvp druid. If you can't then you will eat shit.

I play video games to have a good time not be abused.  If people can't behave in a polite, constructive manner, I'm not interested.  There's no benefit to "being the bigger man" in the face of an anonymous, immature person who has chosen to act like they are acting because you aren't physically in the room with them.  Your reward for tolerating this person is to spend more time with them!  Even if there is something constructive buried within an insult/flame, that doesn't mean I want to spend more time with the person who gave me that tip.
---
I'll thank them for the tip, and leave the group.
---
I'm lucky i can almost always be like "boss can i have tomorrow off?"
---
Programmer ftw
---
you mean blasted lands
---
You can totally go for it and never heal if you really don't want to. However there is a brilliant tank/healer combo-spec which makes you more versatile for raids - particularly in fights that demand decursing or only need one tank.
---
It's your game though, play it how you want to enjoy it.
---
Haha absolutely ballin'
---
6 months is crazy though wtf
---
You go normal casters gear and if forced you downrank your lightning bolt. You use mana pots, and runes if mana is needed. But still don't expect to do good damage... aside of nature vurnelable ads in BWL - if you crit to soon you will pull aggro and likely wipe some of the raid :\]
---
Yes it was exactly that. 
---
It killed the raiding scene completely but I think World PVP was absolutely chaos, certainly was for my server.
---
I think there were some other events too, they mass spawned the Silithus elites too I think. It as a lot of fun I remember that for sure.
---
Thanks! Iam. 2x dad and I think feral might not be for me since I cant be as competitive with my time as I want

Vanilla Naxx vid with 4 (yes four!) druids
---
It shows the value of classic wow that not only is tons of very high quality content already being made for it on YouTube, but there are also a bunch of tools being made as well - and it's not even got an announced release date yet
---
Yes I agree. The major obstacle tbh is what you said however. The initial nozdormu rep grind is basically a popularity contest to see who has the most friends who will farm carapace fragments with them or whoever has the most gold and can pay people for their carapace fragments. As you stated this will heavily favor streamers for obvious reasons. I can't stress enough that this rep grind is essentially a race and somebody beating you to this stage of the quest by an entire raid lockout could be devastating to your ability to compete.
---
Yea thats what i did. Took 2 weeks of vacation in mid august.
---
I case it releases in July then i'll be in the 40-50 level range by the time i take my vacation and servers would be more stable
---
I’m in America and I don’t have these issues. It’s likely the position these redditors are in. I’ll bet their managers take a week off with little notice.
---
Tanks because there's simply less of them around. It is that simple.
---
Wait, you have winter in Australia ?
---
I love the hybrid classes but in raiding they are not that great.
---
It is not so much about the shunning more about working as a team and clearing content. Every raid in Vanilla can be cleared as 39 players so technically raiding naked without talents is viable. Take advantage of the kindness of your freinds at your own peril though. 
---
That being said there is a way to do good dps as feral . I see quides by Shedo has been linked Good luck
---
Nothing more warlocky then Staff of the Shadow Flame IMHO. Although I have it on my mage on the smaller P server :D
---
HAH!
---
Surely, I will be severely depressed if they didn't give us oce servers
---
This is how I will make my gold as a tank.
---
They do have aa meetings for wow
---
My dps is not low. This guild just doeant bosses in sub 1min.
---
Alphabetize
---
Some will sure, but I have seen plenty of fury warriors who simply refuse to tank even in 5mans. This wont be an issue for me though because:
---
A) I will be the tank
---
B) I will host the runs
---
C) I will not invite fury warriors.
---
Are combat pets smaller now? That look like a real npc sized cat.
---
Same here. Feel like mid August is a good gamble.
---
its viable if your farm gnomeregan constantly for the hammer that drops there. It has 3 charges to increase attack speed, you're after those charges. So after you use 3 of them the weapon is useless and you need to grind a new one, you'll need a lot of those. So if youre prepared to grind gnomeregan a fuckton and also grinding consumables you can be viable.
---
The reward would be not getting into a screaming match, and finishing the objective.
---
Then after that you can still make sure you don't encounter them anymore.
---
If you leave because some immature person insults you, the entire group suffers for it. Granted, it's not your fault but you could focus on the others who are mature enough and finish the objective. Everyone will love you (and hate the flamer) for it. Attitudes can spread like wildfire in a group/guild, both positive and negative.
---
Can't wait to spend the hot summer days sticking to my office chair.
---
Wait, I live in England. Never mind.
---
In the name of ESFAND!!!!! where the hell is the Retri specc!!!
---
Good bot :)
---
I get a malware block for this site.
---
With 1.12.1 talents feral tanks are amazing in early content.
---
Not really, clickers we're laughed at even in vanilla, it just went unnoticed a lot more than these days especially since most of the dps rotations are very simple.
---
Whenever you found a guy who couldn't turn fast enough in pvp to keep up with your circle strafing was fun times.
---
I took a gamble for mid August.
---

TL;DR no
---
IMO retail sometimes seems a bit too cartoonish.I=
---
No idea why did everyone get so offended by this, I totally respect your POV. If I was older and had a family or something, the vacation would be a lot more valuable. But to be fair I have almost nothing better to spend it for right now, so WoW here I come ^^
---
I was Beast Mastery but I don't believe anything in that tree changed the pet size in general (although during Bestial Wrath I think they got big and red).
---
I haven't asked specifically yet, but I'm pretty sure the 6 months thing is only for if you wanna take a week or more off for like vacation or something and not just a couple days to relax.
---
and I'm gonna miss everybody and I'm gonna miss everybody and I'm gonna miss everybody and I'm gonna miss everybody and I'm gonna miss everybody and I'm gonna miss everybody and I'm gonna miss everybody
---
Why ?
---
Dragonstalker helmet. That set looked fantastic, i hope they gief new high res versions of the old sets as well 😏
---
Man holy shit I was going to guess Hyundai lol. I was like the lights and the shape make me think veloster.
---
Really? It's a pretty barebones setup. Any more detail on what's getting flagged?
---
Good point, any idea which definitions Blizzard normally goes by?
---
I would be mildly disappointed also
---
I tried this way but when I had time my partner didn't or vice versa. Level a hunter or warlock and you will most of the time have someone by your side.
---
Yes I will be &gt;&lt;
---
you need to check the protection warriors shield on the last phase. manareg and healing done seems useless :)
---
Mage  - Water, Food, both nice utility that people will ask for. Warriors also love you when you make food for them. Hunters cry of joy when you make water for them. Portals which everyone loves, solo AOE farm for lots of money and easy af cloth. Fantastic dungeon CC with Sheep. Good tagging potential with instant casts. Fairly easy raid/dungeon spots due to great CC and (AOE) dmg.
---
Hunter - Frost trap can be nice for slows during certain fights that require kiting. Freezing trap is nice CC when you can't sheep or don't have a Mage. Scatter shot can be a lifesaver if your healer has a mob on them and tank hasn't picked it up fast enough. Can solofarm Mauradon for best g/h in Vanilla. Pretty good tagging potential with Aracane shot which has higher range than Mage icast, tho has travel time. Uhm... melee love your Trueshot Aura. :D 
---
I probably missed some things but this is what I came up with on the spot.
---
Sorry if 10 euros invested in pixels can hurt you but money is everything but a problem for me.
---
CAN ´T FUCKIN WAIT!
---
Well if it releases july, i'll probably also fall sick for a few days... i know they will understand at work, health is important.😂😂
---
These threads about duo leveling have been popping up constantly since kargoz has started hyping it up but I have yet to see him seriously address the major flaw with questing in a group. 
---
A huge portion of the quests you’ll be doing to level are loot quests and in a world where spawns are limited and take 5+ minutes to respawn you’ll be spending waaaay more time waiting around. This is especially going to be an issue around launch when everyone is focused on leveling. You’ll have more competition for spawns than ever so i find it very hard to believe leveling in a group would be worth it for even the average leveling speed classes. Sure your combat efficiency will be a bit more than twice as good but that is only one part of the equation.
---
That being said, if you have a best bud you want to level with and have the exact same schedule then go ahead and duo level.. maybe you’ll be as efficient as a solo leveler or even a bit faster if you get ahead of everyone and have no competition, it’s just really not worth going out of your way to do.
---
Maybe I’m totally wrong and someone will create the ultimate leveling route in which you dodge all the bottleneck loot quests and break the world record but I doubt it.
---
No, it's okay guys, I'll tank...FROSTSHAAAWCKKK
---
No I genually like the 10 euro hat. Chill.
---
People have forgotten how critical CC was in the game.  Unless your tank was godlike most pulls required at least 1 and preferably 2 CC's.  None of this charge into the group and spam AoE like tanks can do in WoW these days.
---
\-If your group had a rogue, they sap one target.
---
\-All Pulls are ranged pulls, you wait for the sap if there is one, then the warrior or hunter pulls (hunter uses redirect to give the threat to the warrior)
---
\-Other CC'ers activate their CC as the mobs run towards the warrior.  Hopefully at least 2 of the creatures are controlled.  Mage: Sheep, Lock: Seduce, Druid: Roots, Hunter: Ice Trap.
---
\-MC is too risky unless you are MC'ing a healer.  Let the tank know you are doing things like this, otherwise he might not notice until it's too late when the mob beelines for you, Mr. Holy Priest.
---
I like it because it's correct about Deadmines. DM first, that NA madeup stuff about VC later!

Having a look at the diagnostic of the block it points towards your DNS hosting being at Cloudflare.

[https://youtu.be/LMSrqrJs1CY](https://youtu.be/LMSrqrJs1CY)
---
Alex is on tips level bad.
---
You have to look at the whole shaman vs paladin thing.
---
Paladin gives two major benefits on alliance side:
---
* attack power and stats buff
---
* threat reduction
---
Shaman gives:
---
* windfury
---
* Stats buff (lower than pala afaik)
---
windfury gives your weapon a temp proc, but since weapon procs dont work in catform, it is yet another thing melee dps will benefit from and you won't (bigger dps gap), on alliance the gap stays the same since pala buffs still work in kitten form
---
&gt; Strath, Scholo,
---
How are these so much easier?
---
Soon
---
I think it will be interesting to see if they release some sort of Beta. If not, without the community's input, well, the probability of having leftovers from Legion, tweaks that were not present in vanilla and who knows what else, grows exponentially. But let's hope that will not be the case.
---
Maybe look into when their in game events happen... idk if they have anything for summer though.
---
I just want to say thanks to ya'll who commented! There's clearly things I didn't know about the nature resist and lack of benifitial debuffs. I would hope there was a chance to mix/match some spirit clothies and some spelldmg /hit gear, however according to yourselves it seems to not be the case. Thanks for finally giving me answers I've been scouring youtube for!
---
Bringing 1-2 good powershifting ferals should be fine, especially on alliance side.
---
On alliance side, a typical melee group has one mandatory warrior for shout, rogues and probably a hunter with aura. It's easy to slot in a feral druid there for crit aura and their dps+aura buff+inervate is enough contribution to justify bringing one. Alliance ferals also get access to bow and judgement of wisdom, helping a lot with powershifting mana sustain.
---
On horde side, a typical melee group has one mandatory shaman, one mandatory warrior, probably a hunter with aura and rogues trying to get in. It's much harder to slot in a feral there as well.
---
Its not a massive advantage but if you're sword spec then you will have a higher hit chance by default I believe :)
---
Interesting, wouldn't you get a lot of sites blocked because of that?
---
I leveled a Warrior in around 12 days /played on a pserver about a year ago.
---
Was leveling with a friend who couldn't play as much as I did, so I spent a lot of time waiting for him to log on. Spent most of the time waiting doing all of the leveling dungeons multiple times (yes, even ST, BRD and Maraudon) amd gathering/leveling professions.
---
I'd say that without all the waiting around wasting time I could've probably done it in like 8 days /played.
---
I'd say for your first time anywhere between 8-12 days /played is pretty decent.
---
I hope so.
---
Is 20 degrees Celsius winter?
---
I understand that reference.
---
Alex is way better than Tips
---
For the first MC clears, it's much safer to go with an actual Prot tank. Gear will be pretty crappy all around, so lower scaling TPS is much less of a problem. You will most likely be using a shield anyway, and Bloodthirst is very meh in pre-preBiS gear. Shield Slam is almost as good as it will ever be, right off the bat.
---
Well you didn’t ask the extremely important question, is it pve or pvp? Because Human is unbeatable in rogue vs rogue for pvp, perception is amazing.
---
avg temperature in Aus winter is 15deg lmao... that's a WARM day bro!  no need for a heater or blanket
---
Tribe k2 has a nice wsg commentary video too, if youre interested in the pserver pvp meta
---
You forgot about 50 gouges in your rotation.
---
Alliance because Alliance. Gnome because mage.
---
Druids have no normal resurrection and their combat resurrection has 30 min cooldown. For 5 man dungeons, this is going to be annoying. For raids, this is going to be a blessing.
---
On the other side, with only 1-2 druids per raid your going to buff the whole raid alone which means you'll have to drink multiple times.
---
Hit
---
"at own peril", man. Raiding in MC/BWL only requires everyone in the raids to actually not stand in fire and not afk. And AQ40/Naxx is just gear, not skill, that is required and a feral druid here or there will not cause the raid to wipe.
---
I'd rather take a druid that wants to prove he can do it over that rogue who AFKs at the trash mobs all the time.
---
Having only feral druids as DPS instead of Warriors, Rogues etc might be a dumb idea. Since you start losing DPS and buffs. But that's still viable.
---
In vanilla we had "only paladin" and "only druid" runs in MC / BWL clearing it without being overgeared. With some help from another class here and there for specific dispelling etc.
---
A feral druid with a healing set in bags also adds another healer on some bosses. It adds another battle ress and an extra offtank.
---
It's a none-issue as well since the min/max super hard core raiders are a vast minority.
---
It's a legit question. Don't be a dick.
---
Uhhmmm... ok? for you it hasn't, that's fine.
---
Void walkers were demons before blizzard decided to do some next level "demons are actually aliens" shit.
---
1. Yes
---
2. Yes
---
3. Yes
---
4. seems unlikely
---
5. probably not to that extreme but the concept is agreeable enough
---
6. just depends on if you're encountering groups or not, splitting honor is better than not being able to kill at all
---
7. see above
---
8. no, regardless of your views on what class is strongest it will flat out go to whoever plays the most, like it always has
---
&gt;So other classes will fail on getting R14 vs Warlocks/Hunters/Mages? 
---
no
---
All depends on your dedication. I’m shooting for 2-3 weeks at 5.5 days played
---
In duels? Yes. In open world where neither rogue knows the other is there? No. NE’s have deeper stealth than humans that is always on. Also, I would say dwarf is better than human for rogue v rogue. Clearing blind or bleeds is amazing.
---
I just realised you said cons as well so I'll add some here:
---
Mage - Drinking water can be annoying and tedious as you basically sit down to drink after every mob. Squishy with low armor so Hunter pets can be a nightmare in PvP. AOE farm in the world will get you in arguments with other players that want to kill mobs in the same area. (Some dungeons can be solo'd however) 
---
Hunter - Too many hunters. Too many bad Hunters that forget to turn off taunt, unsummon pet b4 a jump and pull the entire dungeon. Not the best AOE dmg for dungeons. There is a bit of a stigma attached when you play a Hunter. PvE rotation is difficult so unless you're very good or get a guild early it can be very hard to find Raid spots. Out of 40 ppl you need maybe 2-3 Hunters. You need the same gear as your Tank does (many dungeon tanks are fury main spec) and therefor some can be reluctant to invite you to their group for prebis. People don't like Hunters in PvP either so prepare to get ganked a bit extra, but also have a great time in PvP after 40 lol. 1-10 can suck a little due to no pet a d awkward melee Hunter. Taming rare pets is a pain in the ass unless you get lucky. The best ones have a long respawn and lots of people camp them. Lots of people will also kill them as you're taming them and you'll cry inside. 
---
However a pro I forgot to mention is that Hunters are the best solo farm and solo quest class with the lowest gear requirement for leveling. You can level super duper fast if you know what you're doing!
---
Getting ahead of the crowd sounds counterproductive when that person expects to not have much time each day to play after the vacation. Leveling can be done in smaller intervals, pvp ranking up and even doing certain high level dungeons can demand more time. If the plan is to get to 60 then just peace out I guess whatever
---
The reason for the alt is to help get the second wand (Greater Magic Wand). And to allow you to go Skinning on your main.
---
Seeing classic still being potentially 142 days away makes me sad :(
---
last time i played on a pserver me and a friend did dungeons together.  we met this one guy in SFK that knew what he was doing and we immediately added him and basically farmed every dungeon up to 60
---
thats how it should be
---
Throwback to highschool.  Haha
---
Svenskar tillåtna?
---
STVietnam.
---
Wow your boss sounds like a D\*\*\*
---
I get to take my vacation time whenever I want as long as I asked for it 2 weeks in advanced and it doesn't overlap other vacations. (We are a department of 5 people so easy)
---
The game will be 1.12 unless otherwise mentioned. They have not mentioned quest progressions so safe assumption is that those quests are going to be there unless otherwise mentioned.
---
Think you misunderstand what ahead of the curve actually means. Sorry you got your definitions mixed up. No feelings hurt
---
^
---
Har haft så mycket dåliga erfarenheter med andra Svenskar när det gäller WoW.
---
For me? I think when all of us look at this game we know what to expect... Those things still work just as well regardless of the colour of anyone's glasses.
---
It probably has some kind of trust rating / whitelisting system. A lot of computer security is based on that (in addition to heuristics) in the "cloud era". Basically because your site is new and has not been visited by many Cisco users they automatically assess it as a threat.
---
Came here for this can of worms. (Though honestly as an EU player I never heard of it being called VC until pservers)
---
Feral can be viable but you have to put THE MOST effort into playing it than any other class or spec in the game, and even then many guilds will not take a feral druid over resto or even a bear druid
---
There are people with a lot deeper knowledge of this game than u...
---
Devilsaur Eye, Rune of the guard captain?
---
Ok they give us a date and it gets delayed. Now shit loads of people who  got leave are screwed. 
---
They'll give a date when they're 100% sure it'll be ready
---
female trolls have really nice attack and casting animations but the way they run is so damn goofy
---
Well played.
---
Would your answer change to NE if he was asking about PvE? No? How is it an extremely important question then?
---
its called that as seen from our point of view, to the demons we are actually just sending them home
---
Sick time, bro.
---
Alliance EU PVP Guild here,
---
Casuals will be more than welcome. You don't need to play 100 hours a week to be an MC raider.
---
fair enough! actually just said that half-joking :D
---
Priests are not consumable debendand if you know what you are doing (downranking, cast cancelling....). Not to mention they have very fun and flexiable gameplay in both raid and organized pvp
---
&gt; have my heater on with a blanket over me grinding wow
---
Yeah, winter temperatures in Australia is like early summer for me.
---
Because it wouldn’t matter as much, it’s only sword skill the difference. As someone who used to duel heaps perception is really important. I guess people don’t really care so much about that.
---
Yes can wait for all the different Legolasxxxx
---
Play what YOU want to play.
---
There's also sapping the annoying add on ZG Tiger Boss. That's the most scary sap I can think off (and it's not very scary).
---
Good response, and I tend to agree with you regarding engineering. It is just that the alternative of enchanting doesn’t feel like a must-have either, but it’s probably better as it helps with the gold grind.
---
I can start enchanting-Skinning and give my alt LW and Tailoring, just like in the video. Once I get my first mount, I can drop skinning on my main for Tailoring. Get Dreamweave gear and set myself up to get the robes at 60 (or just hang on to skinning until 60). Then eventually drop Tailoring for Herbalism and be done with it.
---
Then I can setup an alt with Alchemy at level 35+ to deal with all of my consumable needs, except flasks.
---
You make an interesting point about LW. Maybe it’s worth having a third alt with LW for the transmute down the line. Can have one alt with Alch/mining and another with skinning/LW.
---
id argue the way they present the story through quests and the flow of quests can be satisfying. but that gets hampered by the fact the story is shit. also i can see the hand holding through the zone kind of killing any sense of exploration because you go places because the quest marker tells you to. not because you just wanna see whats over there
---
Nelf Rogues are cringe
---
fresh meat for phase 2 right here
---
I never relied on those kind of macros. #feelsbadman
---
Yeah seen a lot of people asking for enhance. Pretty sad tbh
---
Classic might have broken mana regen. In the demo it was impossible to go oom regardless of your class. I feel like this will make it to live because a lot of classes aren’t viable because they go oom stupidly fast.
---
Look forward to reading it!
---
There is absolutely no advantage to being a NE over a human for rogue PvE.  There are advantages to being a human.
---
So your answer wouldn’t change regardless of PvE or PvP.   Unless you were going to advise him incorrectly based on pure non sense or something like that.
---
Do you think we would have the numbers to fill an oce server? I mean PUBG can't even gather 100 players to run an oce server most nights.
---
Faen heller, no kjører me!
---
If you're good you'll stand out. and it's not like playing a druid makes you instantly be invited to the group solely because druid is the least played, there's still a lot of druids out there, you'll still have to be good to do decent content.
---
It’s about a 4 min flight path compared to a 10 min one.
---
I agree with most of this imo. I too think people over-dramatize the issue. Ganking at FP is fine until you piss off to many people, and get hell in return. What's more, with smaller servers, there will be more of a reputation thing like in Vanilla/BC ; big gankers will be known by name very fast, discussed about on the forums. And if they tickle some raiders they'll end up being corpsecamped for hours by their guildies, like Vurtne who showed that back in his old videos. 
---
True aswell about group PvP not being worth it because of how honor is being distributed. ***Monkeynews*** showed how he farmed honor for R14 on LH, and in the open world it was almost solely solo 1vX PvP, not group stuff.
---
&gt; Warlocks/Hunters/Mages will be best in this 
---
Only Hunters have any reason to be on that list more than other classes, because they got tracking. For the rest, outside of Paladins (and eventually Druids) who have too little of a burst to easily solo farm, and Warriors who are generally bad at 1v1, all classes can farm honor effectively. THen it boils down to gaming time. Locks in particular are pretty weak early on so you shouldn't pay too much attention to them during phase 2.
---
For Live side, you want good a couple CC classes for the Scarlet mobs. For Dead side, a Shackle is very handy.
---
Beyond that, just bring people who aren't brain-dead and can react to stuff.
---
Low effort shitpost?
---
Unsure. We diddnt get oce servers in 2004 and they are going with no changes...
---
Well, your honor shrinks when you kill the same people repeatedly. At some point it would be more lucrative to leave and start over elsewhere.
---
PUBG Is a dead fucking trash game buddy. I am sure the people in australia love WoW way more
---
Maybe the date announcement is at those events, but I doubt the game release will be at those events.
---
K g
---
This shows how retarded (huntarded) I was during Vanilla. I trained a bear in the Dwarf starting area and kept it entirely until 60. Did I definitely miss out on abilities? I can't even remember what a bear knows, to be honest.
---
Alliance vs. Horde are going to have different bis lists even for the same classes due to how pally bok affects the usefulness of raw stats vs. AP for one example.
---
Hunter (seeing as it's the class I know best) stage 6 MH weapon should be hatchet of sundered bone iirc. For the most part it was pretty accurate (although most of the bis gear is far better on other classes such as dal'rend,hoj,boa,dft..) but one other problem is that the amount of +hit was really inconsistent in early phases (+7hit phase 1 why?) Usually you go for 5-6 hit and cover the remaining three with talents, or get 8-9 from items alone. Also T2 had spirit enchants instead of stats or agi which is obviously wrong.
---
Then there's the issue of pvp gear, an alternate bis list which includes pvp gear could be cool.
---
Two days /played to 40 is rather slow. There's much work to be done, looking forward to it though.  
---
You might want to get a local repack to do your testing on.
---
debateable
---
Do you truly believe that for all the people in this sub, the have been no changes regarding preference in the last, at least, 10 years?
---
Or, look at this fancy Warlock PvE setup https://media.giphy.com/media/l41lUJ1YoZB1lHVPG/giphy.gif
---
Reminds me of the "Is Michael Jackson dead yet" thingy
---
The goal of LC should be to distribute loot in a way that benefits the right as a whole most. The raid cannot benefit from loot that is distributed to people that don't generally attend every raid. So in such a guild if LC is properly operated you would ideally only get loot that no core raider wanted.
---
On the flipside attending raids would be much easier since they are cleared so quickly when everyone is in it for the raid and not themselves.
---
even the best players clicked some abilities.
---
Our houses have barely any insulation though so they lose heat very quickly.
---
You can skip a ton of trash in AQ40 simply by having whole raid on follow one person. You can skip trash between Fankris and Huhuran and trash between emps and cthun.
---
If you want Oceanic servers, visit the official classic forum and bump the Oceanic server thread we have going.
---
That's not what I said. Ofcourse everything has changed in ten years of people's life. But the game still does what it says on the tin. It still has its magic as an unbelievable MMO.
---
Yes. There are several hundreds of aussie players who played recently on private aus vanilla servers even though they're trash, and several aussie guilds from international private servers that have many players keenly waiting for aus classic wow. So that's enough to get a stable pop of &gt;1000 even before factoring in any of the casual and non-private server players, tourists from retail, etc.
---
There is truth to what you say but MC will be easily cleared by very few raids. Maybe it changes after ZG phase where players are more experienced.  
---
Sure i would bring a feral druid to my raids specially if he is putting in some effort. If you are looking for a permission to be low effort in progress raiding you will not get it from me. It is not some social stigma thing it is a team effort thing and simply showing up is not enough. 
---
If everybody is min-maxing thier talents, gear and tactical skill/knowledge so they can clear the content then a player putting in less effort than that will be taking advantage the kindness of his freinds.
---
I have heard that rogues for example are overpopulated in tbc servers and should be avoided if possible. That's why I was asking about mage in vanilla.
---
But yeah I see where you are coming from. DPS is dps and if you stand out you will find a group.
---
I was Horde all my life so with Classic, I decided I wanted to see the other perspective.
---
Also, Ironforge and Stormwind are truly amazing compared to OG/UC, and in Classic, there is no Shattrath/Dalaran, so you'll spend a lot of time in your main city.
---
It can be a little annoying but keep in mind you get to roll on cloth, leather, AND mail healing gear. Also the high demand typically means there is always a raid spot with your name on it
---
This isn't particularly helpful when OPs asking which is technically better.
---
Add in consumes that are more situational too, like titans for hunters. Simple but cool little tool though.
---
Looks like the Lobotomizer, although the guard is a little different.
---
When did they pull this before?
---
Thanks for the input man! Appreciate it.
---
So, if you seriously consider rolling feral DPS: 
---
1. Log on to an instant 60 fun server where you also get pre-bis starter set (Can't link it directly, but it has the word "Retro" in it). 
---
2. Get your gear, set talents and move to Gnomeregan and try farming Manual Crowd pummeler. You will need 4-5 of these bad boys to do well in a raid. The drop rate is approx. 33-40% and you can make 5 runs per hour. 
---
3. Try to realistically evaluate your burn out potential. Most people burn out and join the failed wannabees ranks and respec resto.
---
As for a norwegian who last year studyed abroad in Australia (Sydney), the winters are pretty cold due to little isolation in the walls. As for the degrees sometimes it said 15 degrees Celcius and felt lik 2 degrees Celcius. This surely has something to do with aclimation (typo?) though.
---
Love to MC people off the boats...such a dick move, but is payback for all the times I get ganked over and over.
---
Looks great dude
---
I honestly think stoneform is better for ally RvR PvP racism’s
---
Are you saying that the game hasn't changed but the people have, and since the game hasn't changed the people are going to enjoy it the same? The movie i watched as a kid are identical today, but i wouldn't enjoy them one bit.
---
He’s asking a specific, closed question
---
Most raiders just set set their Hearthstone to Kargath. If you are a Mage, you can port yourself (or others) to any major city. If you are a Druid, you get a free portal to Moonglade, and if you are Horde there's an \~8 minute flight to Thunder Bluff.
---
You know you last an argument when you start picking on grammar and miss understandings :*
---
It’ll never be 142 days away cuz they said “classic summer”
---
I want to believe
---
Yea but you know exactly what to expect when you go to watch Thomas the tank engine again and therefor are not going to watch it.
---
Yeah and it's actually even worse than ganking because the boat takes like 10 minutes to return :D
---
fair enough we're pretty well insulated
---
my last house was an old one in the peak district that wasn't so well insulated and my boiler was out for basically all of winter so it was single digit temperatures inside.  I had a plug-in heater pointed at my feet and i was wearing two warm tops all day haha
---
best part of the day was getting in the shower.  worst part was getting out!
---
Everyone likes to talk about Blizzard not releasing major content close to each-other. I would think the opposite. They only care about $$.
---
Lets say 8.2 releases same day as Classic (completely hypothetical) they aren't going to lose any money - the subs are connected. They would just gain the classic only subs that have no desire to play 8.2 and It would even be a help to Classics launch because it might hold back/stagger the Classic tourists for a few weeks.
---
Just go with the race you like. No normal guild will reject your application based of off your race.
---
If you can't shake the feeling that you would have done 5-10% more dmg on the boss had you just picked Human insted then you gotta do it. Or you risk rerolling after 15days /played.
---
I'm sure they already said that the regeneration in the beta was a bug that was already fixed in their internal version but somehow it didn't make it to the beta.
---
i think "WoW" and "WoW Classic" will not care for each other at all. 
---
Seperate games intern for Blizzard. (beside the subscription of course)
---
Maybe a big patch will not hit the same day as a release (cause of server load) but else just two player bases in a different game.
---
I hope you are right!
---
&gt;It's only sword skill 
---
&gt;only
---
Imp swords (and maces too in case you forgot) is THE reason to pick a human as a rogue in pve. It's an insane difference in damage and is only really matched by dagger builds once the dagger rogue has something like harbinger or death's sting or at least perd's and some +dagger gear.
---
Yeh I love on the Gold Coast, it’s nothing like Sydney. People think 15 degrees is cold up here, it’s literally been mid 20s and people are putting on coats.
---
I'd be curious to know what other games have over 1000 concurrent oce gamers. You gotta remember this thing is 15 years old and is quiet niche when you take into consideration the time and commitment level involved.
---
Im just thinking here but lets say we do get oce servers would it be a wise choice to roll on one if its gonna be a ghost town? I've played on the aussie p server and the low ping makes it a completely different game but I'd still prefer lag if the alternative was an empty oce server.
---
Yeh it is good, I just remember losing a lot as a rogue to humans cause they always got the jump.
---
It was 4 hours slower than Joana, sooooo sure?
---
Ironforge -&gt; Chillwind Camp is not 10 minutes :p
---
Joke or not, this is great.
---
Mods, sticky up!
---
Hmm, is it really slow?
---
Joana‘s record is 4d20h played to 60 and Level 44 is supposed to be the half way mark to 60. 
---
So 2 days to 40 sounds reasonable to me.
---
We dem boys!!
---
Staysafe Gang
---
It’s about twice as far as from UC, though.
---
I tried some Alliance guides and they all had big errors, false directions etc. in them. 
---
Haven‘t found a good one yet.
---
How is wow different? I know what to expect, and that's exactly why i think the magic is not going to work for me. I at least don't have the time for so much grind. It will be fun to chill around, but i am being realistic when i say there is no way the game will hold me to get to raiding. Therefore, not everyone will enjoy it as much as you did 😀
---
You want to always get a group? Roll a tank. Build your tank and fury pre-bis set and switch to fury. So long as your tanking set is pretty good you can tank 5 mans and UBRS as a fury warrior, and still show up to raids with a viable spec if you’re not the MT or one of the bench boi tanks. Fury warrior BiS are also a lot of BoEs that you can get simply by farming gold or mats.
---
Same here for me, blocked by my company malware filter (Trend Micro)
---
August is still too early. I’d say September.
---
Sure, some things are just better left unbound even in modern wow or bound to some remote button. When I was raiding mythic nighthold on my shadowpriest, Surrender to Madness was not bound to anything and I clicked that when needed because it's a 100% can't mess up move that is not required to be a twitch reflex like interrupt. Drums / Bloodlust is another example of a thing that you may want to have as such.
---
Perception definitely works. I just don’t like it for wpvp ganking or counterganking. Any aware rogue is just going to watch you pop it (castbar addons) and wait it out. Something passive or reactive gets more use imo, hence stoneform, WotF, or hardiness.
---
You can always just use talent points in subtlety for passive better stealth/better detection, (same goes for nelf stealth racial), but you can’t talent anything that helps you like those other 3 racials do.
---
You can just skip to teaching your pet the max rank of a skill like claw or whatever yes.
---
Wolf is the best raiding pet in my experience: super easy to set them up to howl away without putting them at risk of taking cleaves to the face.
---
If they released whatever patch you’re referring to ‘saving retail’ at the same time as classic, it may lessen the blow to the Classic servers and maybe make the release easier to manage.
---
meanwhile theres elemental shaman. unless that is actually kind of common these days? i never got to raiding on pservers
---
I’m not saying they only care about money... I’m saying they would release classic after the tourists would inevitably unsub as they always do because that is a smart business decision. They would not lose money by releasing 8.2 and classic on the same day, they would lose out on millions of dollars in potential revenue.
---
This right here, I can't express enough how important +wep skill is in vanilla for melee dps. 300-305 makes a huge difference in the damage your glancing blows deal.
---
6: since the 1.12 weapons are way better than the raid gear at the time, it is a good thing it takes longer for PvPers to rank to 14.
---
Yeah 1 farmer gets honor from 1 lowbie 10 times. 
---
Thing is, there are more than 1 farmers and more than 1 lowbies. So if there's 30 farmers in a zone then you can expect to be chased 300 times in the zone as soon as you rez or arrive there. Then the next day this is reset and you are again worth killing 300 times.
---
You also aren't the only lowbie, so there's no reason to leave even after everyone got 10 kills from you.
---
Can you add another time to July 16th, the 100% definite release date for Classic.
---
*adjusts tinfoil hat*
---
I think classic will have an early-mid august launch
---
They're slightly modified Gut Rippers, I used the overall shape and design of the handle and blade - but I felt that a warmer red would fit the illustration better than that signature green on the handle of the actual Gut Ripper.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=2164/gut-ripper
---
for gold its not much u can do solo besides gathering but u gonna need epic mount to make it efficient
---
I'm still holding out hope that Blizzard will do a sudden announcement "Classic to be released in 2 weeks."  I know it will never happen, and your content release observations mentioned above are much more likely.  But this filthy casual can hold out hope.  
---
I'm not convinced that there's an army of people who unsub/resub based on content releases.  I know there are some (I'm about to be one if classic isnt announced soon), but I doubt it's much of a factor in blizzards content release schedule.  However, I hope blizzard knows that there will be a lot of old players resubbing and coming back for Classic.  Of those people who would never resub for "retail,"  many will start playing the newer content and end up buying BFA to regain access to the full game.
---
Thank you!
---
Right on! Glad you like it so much :)
---
Bubble hearth lmao.
---
i have the same problem at my company too, but it work when i call it direcly on IP : http://51.75.194.139/
---
maybe it's something with the redirection i did wrong ... i don't really know
---
For me it is exactly the opposite. 
---
Always mained Alliance and am about to switch to Horde. 
---
Started rolling some Horde and Alliance toons on pservers recently in anticipation of Classic Release. And man, am I having a harder time on Horde. People are ruder and outright unhelpfull. 
---
Questioning my decision hard right now!
---
I never said 8.2 will save retail. You think a massive publicly traded company would throw away millions in revenue for a more stable launch?
---
Health is the most important thing in the world...of warcraft
---
Oh that's good to know. This is the first site it's ever happened with.
---
Aussies were the reason Bloodlust was the best battlegroup. Fuck every other battlegroup, yall were shit.
---
This. Most PvE focused people don’t understand all your dps oriented gear doesn’t mean shit when a PoM Pyro Mage 2 shots you. 
---
You need the stamina to survive long enough to win the fight.
---
&gt; Druid is pretty much only around to innervate and only 1-2 are needed for a raid
---
False.
---
Druids are the second most efficient healers in the game (after paladins) and have quite a big toolkit for healing. They got 2 HoTs, swiftmend, big dick single target healing, highly efficient single target healing, can AOE heal raids with hots, can focus on tanks, can decurse (mages should just DPS) and cleanse poison.
---
Brez is also invaluable in a raid.
---
I belive its gonna be either mid or late august. late august being more likely
---
What i'm trying to say was more in the lines of even if the class is least played that doesnt mean there's a total of 10 of them playing. You can easily stand out with any class and there will never be enough of a supply of good players.
---
Hundreds of thousands of players did that back when blizz talked about sub numbers.
---
Yeah not sure where Finesse is pulling that out of. It *could* be faster, but it isn't *slow*
---
Less player will make it easier to rank not harder.
---
I will miss enhancement shamans in Classic, but it is what it is... :/
---
I plan on going 11 points into holy then going into ret. For dungeon group's I feel like +5% int and some decent int gear is all you need to heal. As for endgame I think the fun with holy paladins is all about PvP.
---
Joanna's recent run to 60 is sub 4 days and thats not as optimised as it could be.
---
I always thought the line was "I am sorry.." with added emphasis on the "am" instead of "I'm". I hope it is that way, part of me wants to believe that the Mad Titan truly believed that he was doing this for the right reason, and that he was truly regretful with how it had to be
---
Your whole post is completely pointless.
---
Until further notice, Classic will release in ***SUMMER***.
---
It's not that much. If you play proplery you (the hunter) basically won't ever have to drink, eat or bandage. So you can buy some food from the innkeepers to give to pets.
---
Yes, server downtime costs just as much money.
---
Imo, it'd be smart to release them around the same time.      
---
Not only would it help with server loads if people are split up between the two, it would also bring back the most amount of subs possible, those who only want classic and those who only want bfa and also those who just wants to dabble in both.
---
https://wowclassiccountdown.com/
---
Here is another one someone made. Not mine I just saw it referenced elsewhere.
---
Set up a gallery and post some of your favorites!
---
Not far away enough, I feel sometimes. I still dunno my _faction_ let alone race and class. Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck.
---
Back then keybinds did not save to account but to the PC you were on, I had a "most" stuff keybound on my alliance char but since i went back and forth on my horde in the end it usually ended up with me having to set the keybinds and i only did that if i raided more or less.
---
 website updated : 
---
*  fixed a bug when you have selected a stage + class + faction and then  change stage with a new stage that have no faction, it properly display  the list now
---
Well, according to this web.archive.org/web/20070320010442/http://petopia.brashendeavors.net/html/families/family_bear.shtml
---
The dun morogh level 5-14 bears had no skills at all, so you probably only had growl lol
---
Bears could learn claw and bite, wich would increase your total DPS by a fair bit.
---
So yeah, you did miss out for sure. But it's okay, back then we didn't know about these things.
---
Yes, even to the point of farming the Blue Dragon Darkmoon card and playing with various downranks to build up more mana efficiency. Elemental in raids is just bad. You're the only caster that doesn't benefit from warlock curses so you're already 10% behind to start. Then compare the talents you get to those of mages and warlock casters and realize talents put you further behind. Then realize that lightning bolt is basically combining the mana inefficiency of shadow bolt with the poor scaling of frost bolt.
---
Spirit is only helpful to an elemental in the context of the Darkmoon card, since unlike mages you don't have any talents to get regeneration during casting.
---
The only real justification to bring along an elemental is for the extra totems, and even then chain heal is so good you'd be far more valuable as resto.
---
If you're going to advertise a guide on a subreddit, that you haven't actually completed yet, you should make sure that the guide is as optimised as possible.  
---
The time he posted isn't great, compared to other speedruners, that's where I'm pulling that out of.
---
You sir have won the internet today! Honestly that's a massive help, thank you!
---
From a City nobody has HS in
---
OP's is more accurate since we don't have a date.
---
I don’t think it’s normal or right to get so emotional over a video game. Time to rebalance.
---
Dis is my life too. Classic brain everyday
---
Joanna go a 1 day 14 hour level 40 on his last run.  
---
Also, he isn't the fastest right now so I suggest you look up the speedrunning communities online if you want to be able to better gauge your guide.
---
Horde 4 Life - Played both back then but will need to start with Alliance because Friends do so :&lt; But on the other side...I love playing pala, so I got that going for me which is nice.
---
No, the advantage is tiny.
---
Could you also compile short alliance guide that would only have list of key quests (attunmets, dungeons quests, big items reward quests...) and where and when you can start em. I want to get lost in the world in my own pace but i dont want to criple myself for missing those big importaned quests
---
Zul’jin
---
I dig it. You turned our excitement/anxiety into a website!
---
There are good guilds who invite Dwarfes/Night Elves with Dagger builds specifically for itemization though. It is easier to gear up your Rogues if not everyone is sword specced.
---
As for NE specifically, they have higher base agility than humans.
---
Gotta retcon, then retcon the retcon, then repeat until no one knows wtf is actually going on
---
yes, they could on non-obvious stuff such as respawn timer of resources, glancing blow. Basically on anything not document during vanilla. The real question is: why would they?
---
Yup. Plus, why waste vaca days playing at launch, just be tired as all fuck during work! There'll be too many people in starting zones anyway, server issues, all that jazz. I'm saving my vaca for week 3 or week 4.
---
Wow, the inspirational poster format.
---
Man that thing is a relic.
---
Na, if its for good reasons, like stability or whatever, it'll be appreciated. It's actually a throw back to Vanilla Blizzard "ready when its ready" attitude.
---
To be fair I think there is a fair few already.
---
Well considering blizzard's political stance, simply saying the name Trump may get you banned.
---
Heaven forbid you say maga or anything to do with walls.
---
Paladins also give you Blessing of Wisdom which improves your ability to powershift.
---
I like it too. Straight to the point and helps you quantify the potential time range for the release.
---
I‘m pretty sure that pservers have the XP amount of quest turn ins wrong at level 40+. 
---
Joana (or Furious Paul) said himself that he thinks he can shave off about 10 hours from his old record in classic. He said that in his interview on Countdown 2 Classic episode 50.
---
A lot of jobs can be seasonal or contracted type stuff in the US. For example, most retail employees have "blackout" dates that they can't take off, like Black Friday weekend and few weeks around Christmas
---
Don't listen to everything.Just do the guide your way man, lot many players will appreciate it.
---
Not everyone wants to top world records, your time will still help many players to level efficiently
---
Dude you're acting like they can predict when it'll be ready. You want some BfA shit where there are tons and tons of bugs everywhere?
---
Yup. Early September.
---
So... jackie chan?
---
youll be assigned a vaca?  wtf is that bullshit all about?
---
Good?
---
Looking forward to summer inside with Classic as much as possible, not a heat fan anyway. And other than 2005 there ain't gonna be any friends trying to get me to go swimming :P
---
Sometimes it's out of your control. My computer I used to play wow on was destroyed in a house fire at the beginning of 2009.
---
It’s reasonable, especially if you only just started to work on improvements. 
---
Alliance side I do level 40 in 1 day 13h
---
Consider adding the various types of BRD runs (similar to UBRS explanation). It's very rare a group will do a full BRD
---
Op did it for the lulz
---
Yep, lost all my old screenshots in hard drive crash, :(
---
Seems like a good time to switch zones, do some dungeons, hit town, work on crafting, group up with others to retaliate, show your alt some love, etc.
---
With no news of a beta yet and summer getting closer, I expect there to be bugs, yes.
---
Depends on the pvserver - most of them have that fixed.  
---
Further more your argument is garbage, as the OP is obviously using a private server himself, just like Joanna and many other are doing right now in prepration for Classic.  
---
All you donuts getting into arguments you know jack shit about. Maybe do some fucking research into speedrunning before you decide to comment. Join a community or two and get your facts straight first.
---
I suggest you read up on how honor system works. If everyone is getting low amount of honor that makes it easier to rank up not harder.
---
As a warlock strong armed by irl friends to play alliance I thank you for your efforts. Any guide you put out I will consider using when I hit those “wtf do i do now moments.”
---
Did his twitch ever get unbanned?
---
 /logs main . Full shiny purplez main steps in stv . \*looks around furiously for rogue\* .
---
\*gives up 15 mins later and logs alt\*.
---
\*dies again\*.
---
I will most likely include the first parts of Onyxia attunement seeing the chain starts in Burning Steppes. I will look into the other stuff but no promises
---
The whole basis of that logic is that classic is ONLY meant as way to keep CURRENT retail subs from dropping. You dont understand, that there is a huge demand for CLASSIC ONLY. Meaning if you release classic on June 16th, you GAIN 2 months of subs of all NEW customers. If you release later, that money is gone.
---
Lets say 500k players around the world, thats \~$15 million dollars lost in profits. Dev and upkeep on this is next to nothing, because they have all the support/servers/ etc setup for retail. Just add bit more.
---
I really don't see how a 9 hour difference to 40, comparing your route to his is reasonable. To each their own I guess.
---
Thanks friend!
---
When in doubt. Roll Warlock
---
Sounds like a bad time to me.  Was it her idea or yours?
---
maybe like 5%? Idk I really wanna hear numbers
---
did anyone test?
---
keep in mind u can just go dagger for pve
---
Human female rogues are fine af anyways
---
I’m not here to set world records. I’m simply a classic enthusiast trying to fix what I perceived as broken.
---
No, because not typing things out of fear of what you could potentially be banned / muted for without breaking the tos is absurd, but it is what it is.
---
If you think I mean anything remotely close to the absurdity barrens chat is on private servers then you are mislead.
---
You won’t get T3 until 16 months or more into the life of the server. Rogues are good at making money. You can raid in combat and respec to your preferred PvP spec for the rest of the time. You can probably get away with PvP spec in some progression raids and in all non-progression raids depending on your guild’s culture.
---
its obviously pve
---
Reminds me of &lt;Naga Stole My Bike&gt;
---
Much higher effort than my attempt. Consider my site the low budget version!
---
u can get +dagger gear in blues
---
there is a belt
---
and dagger 
---
one of them is stage2 tho in dm
---
Good job OP
---
I watched Joana’s 4D20H videos and took note of his time played every 5 levels. I do not have that list in front of me at the moment but, I’d say I’m pacing relatively close especially seeing I’m not a God nor a hunter.
---
warriors too gear up easier too
---
I'd love if that conspiracy was true (I think it'll be August) but I thought I'd keep it simple and stick to what is confirmed.
---
Can't stress that point enough.
---
...
---
So always bring a healer
---
Office jobs are typically the most flexible.
---
Can really see what the community is going to be like. So many of these posts act like they deserve something, it's baffling. Imagine the shit show if they don't get a release date and have to push it to Q4 or something.
---
Anxiety and websites are my specialties.
---
That’s pretty awesome! Would love to see what is done differently
---
Yeah I am. I leveled a human hunter AFTER i went back in Cata. Fumbled my memory/wording a but. Thanks for catching me on that!
---
indeed, if the listed weapon skill table is correct, the +4 is a bit wasted. less so on a warrior or non-human. but Imo we as a theorycrafting community should maybe just leave out the weapon skill options as "unclear" until we know hoch much it is worth
---
This is the dream... sadly I'm in year 12 this year and between getting hammered at a party every other weekend and trying not to fail my VCE and my ATAR I have a feeling I'm not gonna have very much time for Classic WoW this year. Rip.
---
No shhhhh
---
Euro redditors love nothing more than to make sweeping false assumptions about the states.
---
Where exactly states OP in his post that he is trying to break records?
---
Rage much?
---
Doing gods work Alenya. 
---
Looking forward to the release of your Guide, enjoined hearing from you on C2C.
---
Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?
---
Naxxramas will not be released for a long time. You will have plenty of opportunity to pvp before then. 
---
Pvp gear won’t be available immediately as it is being released in stages so you will have to do pve content for gear until you can rank. Which will likely mean running a combat spec for raids. 
---
T1 &amp; T2 are supposed to be decent for pvp so if you’re not looking to rank for your gear you can use those as they become available.
---
Everyone knows how Warlocks and Mages offer special utility to a group in the forms of CC, AoE, SS, summons, portals, food/water, healthstone etc. These two casters are just great for groups.
---
Often people overlook what Rogues and Hunters offer. They don't have buffs (except for situational Hunter auras), no goodies to give others etc. And to be honest most Rogues and Hunters are just DPS you plug into your group. But here is the thing: Well played, attentive Hunters and Rogues are super useful and fun to play with.
---
Hunters specifically have fantastic CC for 5mans. They can trap almost everything into ice traps, they can help the group to kite large groups with frost traps. Their Pet can off-tank 1-2 mobs easily which can save a healer from getting aggro. They can pull from superiour range, they can kite strong mobs and even bosses. A well played Hunter just makes a dungeon run easier for everyone.
---
Rogues can sap targets on pulls, they add super high single target damage and repeated stuns on trash as well as other interrupts, they are simply the best cast interrupters in the game. The stuns they apply lower the healing pressure. They can sneak past mobs to get a dungeon objective (important in later dungeons) or to scout patrols.
---
With FD/Vanish they can get out of combat and swap gear/trinkets to bring in engineering utility and other gear usage. And they can both save your from a wipe with engineering cable.
---
Both those classes get a bad rep kind of. They seem replacable because most people don't put in the effort to play them really well. If you ever find good Hunters/Rogues in your journey: Add them to your friends list. They are great problem solvers in both dungeons and open world.
---
&gt; I never said 8.2 will save retail.
---
&gt;8.2 is being pushed as the redemption of BFA
---
Bruh, potato potato.
---
My  brother returned after the Sydney-Hobart race, so just after christmas from Australia to Germany.
---
It was extra cold in Germany, so he returned from like 40°C to -15° with windchill, so felt more like -20°C.
---
He wore something like this  [https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Man-waterproof-one-piece-snow-suit\_1738931981.html](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Man-waterproof-one-piece-snow-suit_1738931981.html)  when going outside for more than an hour.
---
I completely understand. I was in the same position you are in right now, more than a year ago. So I made my own route.  
---
During that time I was looking at other people's time and route as a reference to make sure I was on the right track, which helped a lot. The other thing that helped a lot was getting a local repack and running variations of the route without getting ganked and so on.
---
I pretty much only raided with irl friends after vanilla wow and that involved quite a bit of trolling. One of the classics was when hybrid classes would equip their "ilvl gear" to boast with "best gear" in the raid while performing the worst and almost whipe on farm bosses.
---
So you won't be lonely...
---
Daggers,  nelf slightly w/ higher base ago
---
Sword/maces, human by a huge margin
---
PvP, Orc undead or dwarf all blow them out of the water.
---
Unfortunate but possible truth: It’s gonna be real sad when we all play for two weeks nonstop on vacation, only get to level 30 and then go back to work and real life and realize we’re not 16 anymore and how much time this game actually takes and that we can’t fit in 20 hours a week anymore.
---
I made a lengthy post about professions, but figured ill keep some things to myself at this point. 
---
But just a small hint, a L35 alchemy alt is going to miss one thing you might want to have. Major mana potion recipe, as its behind a quest chain in scholomance or drop from the last boss from there.
---
Not that important as you can just buy or let others make the pots, but for a priest one of those things to think about. Because thats the one thing you are going to need the most. Still a alt with alchemy is very nice for slow steady gold on transmutes and you can still make almost all other stuff with it.
---
I'm keeping an extra week for next year, kicks in in May to take off for Classic
---
There are alternative leveling routes btw, u don't have to do stv.
---
Its quite ironic. People rightfully mocked vocal rick and morty fans because they thought they were better than everyone else. Now people think they are cool by shitting over the series for no reason. Its the exact same elitism, just shifted from "watching" to "not watching".
---
See ya out there friend! Best of luck
---
Counter theory - before 8.2 because they know BFA is a fucking dumpster fire. Look at bellular's most recent video comparing patch cycles for Legion vs. BFA.
---
Paladins are so OP in group pvp it’s essentially broken. Hated fighting against organized alliance BGs so much that I started playing as alliance on private servers. But will be back to horde for retail and will just learn to deal with it.
---
Would you be able to provide some examples? My knowledge of the labyrinth and keys required for each area is pretty poor.
---
Yep, same here.
---
succ is legit CC
---
Where did I mention the word record in any of my posts?  
---
Are you mentally challenged?
---
I think you might be right.  I remember at the time my guild was clearing early on saying to everyone, "can you imagine clearing this all in one night?!?" Good times...
---
Er der lignende tiltag for danskere?
---
True, but depending on group makeup and how difficult the content is imp will likely be used for the buff.
---
I wouldn't want you in my guild if you have a prereq saying you get something, and I doubt others would want you either.
---
godspeed.
---
Thanos totally believed he did nothing wrong
---
wrong, exactly that is wpvp
---
for everything else there are duels, pve server and bg
---
I have multiple bosses, none of them are dicks, quite the opposite actually! It's more about norwegian laws and how we as workers are obligated to take vacation. If everyone at my workplace decide to submit for vacations with only 2 weeks notice that obviously wouldn't work out. It's more about being able to plan out the year so everyone can get their full 5 weeks of vacation.
---
I think we all figured out who the retard is by now.
---
Rogue stealth isn't unique, druids can do it too!
---
I just took it for granted that there would be Oceanic servers. I'll be super sour if there aren't any too.
---
We will easily have enough players to justify it.
---
You don't get the difference between random griefing and farming, that's fine.
---
Loser mentality.
---
I had a dream a month ago, that it gonna come out at 21 august.
---
Check his discord, he posted screenshots of he most recent run to 60. Those times can still be improved, however, they can server as a better baseline.
---
Yeah but you always have the option to summon that succy if you think it would help.
---
The point is that if heavy farming is keeping you from engaging with your initial plans, then there are plenty of options to revise the plan to a situation that is less prone to being farmed.
---
Norway. If we don't take vacations we will be forced to do so. Everyone is obligated to take vacations! Obviously I won't be assigned to take vacation on a random set of days without them talking to me about it. But they cannot guarantee my vacation on days I want unless I apply before the 29th.
---
...or Maces, Fists, Assassination, Subtlety...
---
Sorry but I thought focus-target doesn't work in vanilla/classic?
---
Yeah, but if youre a filthy magat you deserve to be banned so... not seeing yhe problem.  Not like youre human or anything.
---
Wait do zhevra have unicorn horns o.o
---
CC is used mostly because of low multi target threat generation, not mob damage.
---
I wouldn't call shadow priest suboptimal when having 1 shadow priest is pretty much required
---
Because World of Warcraft is a fantasy game?
---
Ow, you shouldn't use the r word... its frowned upon these days.  
---
However, yes, we did. Maybe next time you can look into topics before posting.
---
Feral dps - Shedo the druid
---
Feral tank - Skarm the tank   and Taladril
---
Shedo and Skarm have youtube channels and Taladril has guides you can find on google. Gl!
---
They're better than warriors in 5mans once they start getting decent gear what do you mean.
---
Would also help stagger out level groupings among the population even further. Even assuming 8.2 holds retail player's entire attention for a month or two before they work through enough content to get down time, there'd still be plenty of casual or time-restricted Classic fans in the middle of leveling by the time those BfA players start dipping into Classic. Lessens the pressure of bottle neck zones, makes the world in general feel more alive, etc. Self-selecting gating of the population is far better than purposefully timing it when BfA players are bored for content.
---
LOL gottem.
---
You should get out more
---
Ay thanks man

True true..I also guess death coil may also be used as an interrupt.

---
Actually his build is a little bit of everything, but I guess we can call it balance.
---
true, but shammys have mana spring so no huge difference there
---
Yeah, everyone says tanks&gt;healers&gt;dps but in my experience in pservers healers are not in that much demand at all. Especially in vanilla where 3/8 classes in your faction will be de facto healers. Any meme spec priest, shaman, druid or paladin will be joining 5mans as a healer to get gear to feed their meme spec, too.
---
&gt; sharding (n) - System by which players are ‘instanced’ into smaller, separate virtual worlds to improve server performance. Regarded as a controversial change to the original game.
---
Sharding in classic isn't being considered for server performance; It's being considered for server population issues.
---
I asked the Scandinavians in this community to sound off [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/batiyp/scandinavians_planning_to_play_classic/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) :)
---
It’s almost like they was asking if they do, rather than asking why they do
---
You don't have to tell me my guy. The reason I am looking for these people is to build out a guide network for people playing these specs to help them out when I welcome them to my "hybrids are -a-okay" guild
---
I thought  you wanted that authentic feeling?
---
You do realise that it's over the course of an entire raid, right? If you're constantly drinking between each boss, the whole "blowing up bosses" gets gated by some elemental shaman fucks sitting around drinking all the time.
---
A fury warrior who refused to tank is a fury warrior that doesn't get his pre bis. The fury warrior who's tanking isn't going to let another warrior into his run. Better hope they're real good friends with a warrior who exclusively wants to tank, which is pretty rare. Maybe one or two per raiding guild.
---
Chuck Norris is the old John Wick
---
I was a noob back in the day, but there was absolutely nothing I loved more than being opened on by another rogue, popping stoneform, rupture and vanishing to watch them bleed while I was safe back in stealth again.
---
Ah, I sense someone haven't played Vanilla.
---
Welcome to the subreddit
---
No idea about damage but if I remember right humans have a built in fear immunity ability or something. Or maybe that was added later.
---
Case and point here.
---
You should tune down the vitriol, its not a good thing to wear.
---
Like the other guy said, it's mostly a shift in player mentality over the years. Why would I waste my time carrying potatoes in dungeons when I can get a guild group of solid players to just blaze through it.
---
People are much more aware of what gear they want and the most effective way to get it. 
---
With that said, if you end up having to do dungeon runs with potatoes, you're probably a potato yourself.
---
Saw 'see you at the crossroads'; heard the Bone Thugs N' Harmony song.  Still works, just funny.
---
Listen to this guy, he knows what he's talking about.
---
I just didn't know zhevra had unicorn horns, never looked close enough I guess. I wasn't asking why do zhevra have unicorn horns in a universe where talking and walking cows would be killing them
---
I don’t understand what you mean - could you explain the difference between population/performance? 
---
I’d say population was an issue due to performance limitations hence them being grouped into one but happy to be corrected.
---
I don't really get what your getting at? Throughout the course of an instance, ranged/caster DPS will be drinking. 
---
What I'm saying is that, these specs that usually go oom on boss fights, will not be going oom due to the bosses dying so quickly, if there DPS is competitive during that small window then does it not make them slightly more viable? 
---
It's more of just an interest point that anything.
---
I wouldn’t say it’s a huge advantage. Early raids you’re probably going to be dagger spec so it won’t matter. Later on (or leveling) you’ll be swords and it will matter certainly, but it won’t make or break your character. For PvP shadowmeld is actually really nice to assist with increased stealth and you will be using daggers for much higher burst damage. 
---
I say if you like the NE go with the NE, there are so many variations in gear between players that have a much higher effect on damage output than the racial will have - if you want to be the absolute best in PvE then yes go human. If you don’t care as much, do what you want and go NE.
---
No they haven't, and we haven't even got classic yet, let's not talk too much about the future!
---
You should also include ele/enhance shammy.
---
All of them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RevirDl5oAU&amp;list=PLY-iMby\_eapmMXro1CRTmDVE\_aolu5hBU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RevirDl5oAU&amp;list=PLY-iMby_eapmMXro1CRTmDVE_aolu5hBU)
---
Oh right, I misread
---
Hey Dude, don't let your mood down, I totally get what you are trying to say.
---
The problem with your argument, you are crushing peoples dreams of a July release. 
---
We are getting classic 4-5 weeks after 8.2 (I think 5 because of subs) or before, since before would be pretty damn soon, after is much more likely to happen.
---
Also there is a difference between caring for money and only caring for money in my opinion, sure these are basically 2 games, but still a staggered release makes a lot of sense from a company point of view.
---
All the issues a simultaneous launch would fix are "customer" problems which in this occasion are not that relevant. They can always say: Hey it's launch we were not expecting this many people. Almost the same as for the "Beta" excuse of other games.
---
Cheers. I'll paste the majority of the above in your thread.
---
lmao dumb tankie
---
Hello. We are a group of between 10 and 20ish friends (familiar in one way or another), who either played Vanilla or WoW at some point during various expansions.
---
We are at around the age of 30, Danish, and looking for either a Danish guild/community or potentially Scandinavian. We wouldp prefer Alliance but it is not a must.
---
Some of us have played at the top world level, others more casually. Similarly for all of us, is that we are all around pretty competent players, who wish to find like minded people and look to raid 1-2 times a week, with more 'loose' opportunities outside of the official raids (PVP, 5mans, etc). Ending up in a '40man raid', where the turn out is only 25-30 is perfectly fine with us, if it is required in order to fulfil the above mentioned.
---
I realize this is not very specific. I am merely trying to identify whether such guilds/communities already exist.
---
Feel free to pm me. Cheers.
---
No
---
I’m Swedish and I going to play classic. Have joined a Scandinavian guild called Kronan. We’re playing on horde. Recruitment is ongoing now on discord. [Kronan EU](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/kronan-horde-eu-pvp-semi-hardcore/41311)
---
They are very much alive on p servers
---
I had the same problem! [I've been working on the same thing](http://wowleveling.fandom.com) for the last 6 months. Hope you know how much work you're in for if you are writing it yourself. The more guides we have the better it'll be for everyone! My guide is in wiki format if there is anything you'd like to contribute there.
---
I would, but I am going to be rolling Alliance so guides for those specs would be useless to my guildmates.
---
F
---
It’s actually kind of the opposite. A PvP spec like 21/8/22 can actually help you make up for weak gear. Shadowcraft has some nice set bonuses but it’s really light on the stamina and will make you quite squishy. We used to call it shadowcrap because of how quickly rogues in it died. 
---
Spamming those cooldowns can give you more survivability. If you get T3 you can honestly just run around Sinister Strike spamming non-T3 people to death.
---
Just because you casuals are going to take 6 months to get to 60, doesn't mean that all of us are going to.  
---
Getting to 40 in under 48 hours seems impossible to you? Git gud.  
---
There's also something to be said about your command of the English language, however, that's a bit too low of a hanging fruit for my taste.
---
WoWA 😂

---
sorry to add on to this so many hours later but how are afflic locks in vanilla or locks in general? I've always wanted to give lock a go but was good at wr and already had my slot in raids etc so had no reason to try it out.
---
The difference there comes from the fact that you are required to be put on the Shaman's group which may not be possible at all times, specially when healers are going OoM.
---
Good stuff mate! I’ll check it out
---
Nelf racials don't suck. Humans do have a DPS advantage but how 'large' that advantage is is pretty subjective to you. The numbers aren't subjective but how much it matters to you is.
---
If you're a min/maxer who isn't concerned with race outside of racials and stat values, and you can't tolerate any discrepancy in performance then you'll want to roll Human. They're the best choice undoubtedly across the board for PvP, PvE and rep grinds.
---
If you're an average player who cares about the appearance of your character then it's probably not a major sacrifice. Any race is playable and they all have different advantages and disadvantages. Nelfs have the highest base Agi, Dwarves have Stoneform, Gnomes have Escape Artist. There are redeeming elements to all of them. Might not be as useful or optimal as some others but they're not shit.

I get what youre saying.  I dont know what that other guy is talking about...but I dont have an answer for you.  Skarm often does Q and As, you might want to try to catch one or maybe see if anyone else in Salad Bakers can advise you.

&gt;Rogues add super high single target damage and repeated stuns on trash
---
Isn't it one or the other? I've never played rogue but from what I understand they use combo points to kidney, which means they don't use them for dps, right?
---
that's wotlk
---
You really shouldn't be using 3rd party anti virus anymore assuming you have an up to date windows 10 install.
---
Wow.... I always thought Aussies would be Austrians... now i feel stupid as shit

😹😹😹😹
---
You can tell it's vanilla because he's in Ironforge.
---
Can you get into dungeons/raids as a none combat rogue? Most comments i see on here say only combat is taken and even then its hard to find a group :c
---
This is so scary.. We have the same Mouse, Mousepad, Headset and Chair.. :D 
---
The desk looks awesome btw
---
On one hand, give me hooves.
---
On the other I spent so much time farming stuff while gathering hooves I had about half my mount fund by the time I turned the quest in.
---
Because when I started out, level 40 took 2 days. I am sure he’ll keep smashing improvements out and that’s what it’s about 👍
---
Warlocks definitely have drawbacks. Raid dmg is pretty mediocre (even with 16 debuff slots, you probably don't want corruption up on bosses for example) and also worse at farming than hunters and mages imo. Great in PvP and lvling is easy, also imo all their T-sets look badass and the ability to summon players is always helpful.
---
And only 1,766,000 people watch Game of Thrones because that's how many are in their subreddit.
---
I often on pservers find its the opposite.. the horde is way more helpfull.. alliance guys always make promises but never show up to really help.. talk is cheap..
---
If you wanna main mage, you're gonna have to prove that you're worth the raid spot more than the other 15 mages lining up behind you. In vanilla, that means tons of consume grinding and prebis farming. 
---
It's fairly easy to play a mage at skillcap in vanilla pve, so even a "barely ok" player would be doing almost identical dps as the best mage on the server given the same gear/consumes.
---
In dungeons, though, is where you can actually shine. You have a ton of tools that makes trash much easier and can save a bad pull and avoid a wipe. 
---
TL;DR I'd take the lower geared, better player mage for dungeons but the higher gear, lower skill mage for raids.
---
Cheers working hard 😓
---
I can't find it unfortunately but I recall this question being asked in an interview. Ion Hazzikostas responded only that they wanted to focus on Classic Vanilla right now. He didn't say yes or no. If Classic is a success and people want TBC, then it'll probably happen down the line.
---
4:3 aspect ratio master race!
---
Exactly, criticisers and min maxers are always abound in threads like these. If you want to create something like a guide and share it with the community there is always room. Don't let em get ya down.
---
For dungeons it doesn’t matter as much. Improved sap is pretty handy. 
---
For raids on the other hand, yeah you’ll have to respec. People bring rogues because they’re kings of single target sustained damage. If you go in non-combat spec you’re gimping yourself considerably and will be outdamaged by the warlocks, hunters, and mages.
---
4 hooves needed, zhevra has 4 hooves!  No problem!

#WTFOMGBBQ HOW DO THESE THINGS NOT HAVE FEET?!
---
Makes perfect sense now! Happy cake day!
---
I think what was meant was that sharding won't be implemented because the servers wouldn't handle all the people. 
---
The primary purpose of it, AFAIK, is to split the population into smaller groups, so that a thousand lvl1s aren't fighthing over the same five wolves in Northshire Abbey.
---
10% lel
---
The racial difference would result in *maybe* 5% tops, probably 2-3%
---
You'll be seriously gimping yourself if you go Holy first and don't intend on playing Holy. Or at least tanking. If you intend on Ret, then you **must** go Ret. Else all you'll have to show for at level 20 is a really high-mana, low-damage skill. Rather then Seal of Command.
---
Almost exactly like that
---
Whoa it is my cake day, fuckin wild, I did not know that
---
Ooh okay, are dagger combat builds accepted in raids?
---
Congratulations you're a meme. Quite the defensive prickly one
---
We are at around the age of 30, Danish, and looking for either a Danish guild/community or potentially Scandinavian. We would prefer Alliance but it is not a must.
---
You're right, for sure. People just want it for putting holidays in at work mostly, and anyone who doesn't has no other real excuse. Pretty sure that date (start of April right?) has gone though so there should be no more complaints.
---
Thanks, good to note. And I don’t think you need to worry too much about secrets getting out. The people reading this sub — and specifically this thread — are insignificant to the total playerbase. And feedback from others is a good way to get holes poked in your plan before you begin.
---
Your cake day on reddit is like your second birthday! Now go and buy some booze and don't come back without a release date.
---
Absolutely. Perdition’s Blade will tear it up.
---
Depends on the company and job type.  I am an accountant and we have busy times that I need to be in the office but outside of that a couple weeks notice is normal.
---
&gt; Having good CC like a [...] warlock
---
For Strat?
---
Pretty sure everyone that is saying they "need" a release date is far more chill than the guy typing out 3 paragraphs about people "needing" a release date lol
---
we honestly want months of testing 
---
i dont want to see day one gold or something exploits that ruin the game
---
if blizz family alpha opens nye this year ill be happy
---
priority 1 is sort the game and possible exploits
---
Hmm, That's not what I remember, but it has been a looong time since those days. Either way I remember making alts of different races to go to the main different main cities to do our little scam, and deleting those alts later.
---
Horde FTW
---
I know at least 10 close friends that will be playing classic that currently don't play retail, all of whom don't use this subreddit so..
---
What r u smoking shadow priests are awesome and super fun! Plus they buff the warlocks
---
TBH, I would rather see them add additional level 60 content, even if it includes stuff like Kara or other things originally designed before they had the idea of an expansion to the original game.
---
You are only reaching for low hanging fruits.
---
I will bet 100USD that you never leveled to 40 in under 2 days in Vanilla WoW.
---
That 30 gold @max level.. It's sad that nowadays you achieve this by level 20 :/
---
US here, my workplace only requires a week's notice for vacation times.
---
Too bad I used all of my vacation time for Anthem's launch.  What a fucking waste.
---
Yeah, I dunno, it doesn't give more info other than it's blocked and the reason is "malware". It could be the redirect, I have seen that trigger it before.
---
Man do yourself a favor, I am not bashing mac, I am a Mac user as well ( 2xMacBookPro 2018), invest the money and build yourself a PC. With these money you will build a beast of a machine.
---
You have 10 close friends?
---
We absolutely can.
---
Yes that is correct.
---
I carry tons of runes on me either way, just ask where you want to go, open trade and put 1g in. Or if you want to be less aggressive about it, just say "can you port me to X for 1g?" 
---
We also don't get 12 pms every second for portals. If I sat in capital for an hour I may get 4-5 on a blizzlike populated server. 
---
If you try to give me a rune as a way to save a few silvers, though, I'm just not gonna bother. I'm already sitting on thousands of golds, I'm a mage. I'm doing you a favour porting you for 1g and this isn't walmart, I don't take coupons.
---
Always choose aesthetics. The racials are not critical to your success. Sure some are better than others in various situations but honestly man play what you want.
---
Also I'm only considering gnome since I would be harder to click on and it's funny.
---
You could get a PC that could handle the game a lot better with the money you're dropping on a MacBook.  
---
It probably can run it on full settings, but the FPS will probably be pretty low.
---
Still better than Arathi raptor hearts
---
No I just don’t like the show
---
Holyweaver is a thing
---
haha faction was easy for me im going with my old guild.  i had 2 choices for class and 2 choices for race
---
decided my class but race is still... its the hardest one imo.  it changes how your gear looks, your run/attack/cast animations, your voice lines... it's something you have to put up with for a lot of hours
---
Love the yell "group 1 2 3 4 firelord 5 6 7 8 spawns".
---
It's been some time since the downfall of retail. We were all forced into real life
---
We've known since the last blizzcon. It's almost been a year.
---
From Australia but i plan on going for a west coast us server 200ping and timezone fits my work schedule.
---
I was surprised ping was only 200 though compared to east coast 280-330
---
Think about us hordies 😇
---
its pretty clear other than asking what to play there is almost no reason to visit this sub.
---
wow isna game for the masses , blizzard will advertise it.
---
you know honestly i firzt thought it would be massive first month then drop off , now i think it will be way bigger than vanilla at its peak.
---
mostly because look at other fotm games today they can pickup millions of players in days.
---
i believe vanilla wow will be the biggest non battle royal this year possibly the biggest game period . Depending on execution 8t could remain one of the biggest games for at least a year
---
Human sword spec doesn't help pvp as weapon skill levels are normalized.
---
Humans don't have the free trinket racial that they have in future retail versions.
---
Ally rogues that -specifically- want pvp advantages go either dwarf for avoiding bleeds or  gnome for escape artist
---
lol. this is real dumb shiet :D
---
I am going to roll Horde for classic and I've been reading bad things about The Barrens. I hear it's very large... and barren. Is it that bad? What's the Alliance leveling equivalent to this area?
---
do you have a source for that? as far as i remember they said its an option
---
Pretty sure you wont get any full resists with that much shadow resistance. Just an occasional partial resist on spell damage. I can't find the chart I used to use, but the rule of thumb is basically an average of 1% dps reduction per 5 points. 4% less dps from shadow will help, but it won't be much of a game changer.
---
I do think resistance will be better before AV comes out, though, and no one has don rodrigo's. But then we don't have BWL or shadow reflector to help out with shadow resistance. 
---
And good point about the SPP, although they will still be cheaper than arcane bombs. I had 5 left over after killing my silithis demon, and I saved them for a warlock I hated. Too bad they are so expensive, because it was glorious.
---
I want to play 3 classes simultaenously despite the fact that it will likely take me 5 months to hit 60 on one.
---
Human racials aren't superior in PvP. Gnome is better overall.
---
Gnome is the master race, so obviously, go Gnome.
---
Lol huh? Like i understand your words, but huh? Just play however classic meant to you. Im a mob grinder but i go where ever the good loot tables are, not just one contient.
---
What kind of workplace picks your vacation time.. WTF?
---
Do imaginary friends count?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
I'm not going to time stamp it, you find it. It's been 5 months btw, I've been exaggerating a bit. Still think it should be common knowledge by now.
---
Because thankfully the majority of classic players won't be from this sub.
---
The big push for classic will come from actual Blizz marketing, they can take Classic and shove it right in everybody's face thanks to the Battle.net launcher.
---
Certain job types have to plan stuff way ahead of time.
---
Yes. Roll on the server in your region, encourage others to do the same and build the community from there. You're not powerless in this equation.
---
Ahhhh, gotcha. I've edited that section to make it clearer then. Thanks!
---
If you wanna be better at fighting other rogues go human if you want to be better vs everyone else go gnome.
---
The problem is tourists and servers having a player cap. If they make enough servers to accommodate all players, servers will die when all the tourists leave. If they have less servers and do nothing, we'll all be queuing for hours to play on launch.
---
Sharding allows more players onto a server without overcrowding the starting zones, and without resorting to queues. People will leave these zones at a different pace so the population will start to spread out, so 20 people aren't competing for the same mob spawn.
---
Server performance might be part of the reason for sharding in BfA but classic won't have the same texture detail and spell effects of BfA. 
---
Blizzard servers are perfectly capable of handling the amount of players, it's just that the zones themselves aren't
---
Unless I'm doing it wrong there's some things missing from Melee classes. Like Greater Agility pots, Elixir of Giants, Elixir of Brute Strength, Dragonbreath Chili, etc.
---
lol. so accurate.
---
In my server they're like 12-15g each, arcanite bar is 45g each and makes 3 bombs.
---
The point is not to get full resists or overall damage reduction but to get a lucky 25% or 50% resist on a burst attempt which is game changing.
---
2 weeks and level 30? Casual as fuck. I'm gonna. 25 night 1

We sort of do. It gets down to 10c for a week and everyone loses their s*it and acts like they're Scott of the Arctic.

He said that he ONLY wants to use a mac, no reason to say anything about PCs then?. Either of those Macbooks will get you going just fine, i dont believe you can get a Macbook with 120/144hz screen yet? (correct me if im wrong). So, you should be good at 60hz with either!
---
All I did was divide the time played by 6 hours since he wanted a real life, "days played", answer. Casual and slow levelers is in reference to 7-12 days played in game lol
---
Alright cool thanks for letting me know
---
Oh man this is great news.

---
He's saying that you'd be drinking between every pull doing garbage trash dps. Trash in a raid is a very big chunk of time, especially on farm, which is when you'd try out the speedrun meme shit in the first place.
---
Yeah, boilers or central heating is unheard of in Australia also.
---
Disc/shadow is better by a mile.
---
I do... yes...
---
Dozens of people I know... I would imagine everyone who plays games has about the same... duh.
---
It's not really an assumption, vacation is basically viewed as a human right over in Europe. In most countries it's mandated by law that every and any employee gets a a month vacation. I get 18 days a year in the states and my coworkers on my very same team get double that who work out of the eu.
---
I DON'T THINK THEY WOULDN'T SAY "HAVE A CLASSIC SUMMER" AND THEN RELEASE IT AT THE VERY END OF SUMMER. "YES HERE EVERYONE ENJOY YOUR (BIG CLASSIC SUMMER) THAT IS ONLY A WEEK LONG". Some food for thought
---
Going through the same shit although it’s my coworkers claiming their time while I’m sitting here not knowing when I should. I would have taken off 5 years ago if the date was released
---
Ive wowd in multiple high end MacBook pros.  It sucks.  If you really want to enjoy it get a pc laptop with a dedicated nvidia gpu.
---
The pets got bigger with you the more levels they gained with you in classic. I had a Troll hunter and my durotar raptor was freaking huge.
---
It's absolutely not.
---
If you're going for optimal raid comp, you'll want one of your holy priests pick up the shadow weaving from shadow tree.
---
This way you free a raid spot for another fury warrior or w/e
---
Like, in real life? How?
---
What a great screenshot, ty for sharing. 
---
I love how that most dps screenshots from back then dont have raid windows on (cuz why would they) but my own interface back then as a healer was completely plastered with all raid groups info :)
---
your wifes cheating on you cause you play wow nerd lol
---
Yes.
---
Rogues get +5 weapon skill from their talents so rolling human just puts you from 305 to 310 if you're sword. If you're dagger you just need to wear one of the many items that give + dagger skill.
---
ye, just decide political elections by reddit too, reddit master race
---
"Can I get an amen"? More like, "Can I get a ramen!" Amirite?
---
FUCKING INCREDIBLEEEE!
---
Love it, my only comment would be to put the actual "Is Classic out yet?" question aswell on the top of the page.
---
i'll F5 this for sure.
---
You do you.  Really looking forward to seeing your work.  The community really does appreciate your  effort (regardless of whether your guide is speeding compliment of not).
---
This is very refreeshing to know.Its not like i dont like PVP. But not 24/7 and on rush hour it can become very annoying when u have specific time to play.
---
I am all in for darkshore raids  from time 2 time. But that constant pvp from higher campers can become really tiring especially if u play with friends. I want to enjoy my time
---
Play some other games guys, it might make the wait easier.
---
Neither. If you want to PvP as a Rogue, then your best choice is Dwarf, which is great; because Dwarf Rogues are the fucking best!
---
No, a bottleneck implies that there's some kind of slow down or impedance to leveling. There isn't. And you CAN do all your questing on the other continent, but it kinda sucks. Just like leveling as alliance.

don't like hip hop much but this... this is my jam now
---
Classic min/max try hards gotta avoid all the servers with ppl demanding "BIS"  fcking losers
---
Unless you’re fighting rogues and druids in which case yes human perception is superior.
---
If it gets political then off to Silverpine I go. This is the last thing I want to think about/being exposed to when playing a game.
---
Your dwarf looks like a doofus. I love it.
---
Hey thanks man! I’m not claiming it’s a world shattering guide but it is faster and more organized than the popular Legacy one
---
Oops sorry mods I reposted by accident! Pls delete
---
I cannot imagine not drinking after boss. Also it's not only elemental shamans you are not bringing for absolutely fastest run, you are basically taking nothing but melee.
---
You won't pay up anyway so what is the point? Just revel in the fact that you have no actual touch of the gaming world when that number jumps way over what you think.
---
because most clones dont look into things they like they simply follow the crowds and streamers like the brain dead fools they are

All this weapon skill crap is just blown out of the water.  No amount of weapon skill is going to overcome actual good gameplay until you're at the very high end guilds, and even then it's not as big as people make it out to be.  This game is all about min/maxxing and so people exaggerate things like if you're a Nelf using swords you will get beaten by a human rogue every time.  If you're just a flat out better player, you'll do more damage.
---
Yeah make it harder. It’s called constructive criticism.
---
GOOD POINT! Don't touch John Wicks hunter pet.

---
Another person I hope gets camped by the Top PVP guild in the world. I hope they camp you until you want to quit gaming forever.
---
Kidnapping
---
The main issue I think is that you're going to get super frustrated. Casual players tend to be really bad. I have nothing against casual players and I've been in mostly casual bordering on semi hardcore guilds, and most people were really, really bad. 
---
Especially if you only have time for 1-2 raiding days, and people are wiping on simple mechanics, wasting the little time you can dedicate to the game, you're going to get frustrated very, very quickly.
---
yeah ony neck is legit, idk what above is on about, most of these lists definitely wrong though.
---
Add new content only after giving access to the original expansions first and I'd have no problem with this.
---
http://www.isthatcherdeadyet.co.uk/
---
I’d still go dwarf for rogues and druids. Seeing stealth is nice but removing bleeds and poisons is primo.
---
They aren't going with no changes, they have changed alot when it comes to lots of things
---
I will be counting on this site
---
If you're willing to wait so it's not "a piece of shit" then why are you desperate for a release date????
---
When you hear the stealth noise:  
---
#It's the enemy!
---
Great idea. I've updated the site!

Chuck Norris ordered a Whopper at McDonalds, and got one!
---
Human is best for PvE if you care about that (unless dagger spec). In PvP Dwarf=Gnome &gt; Night elf &gt; Human.
---
A ret paladin benefits so much more than a warrior from sulf
---
Oh come on, vanilla mechanics really aren't that difficult, many people now have a decade of experience with rougher mechanics and people will be properly geared/specced with all the raiding addons
---
It was a confirmation as I have not seen an official note on it. Considering they are releasing later content at an earlier point in the game, it is not THAT far fetched of a thing to confirm.
---
Guessing you are not paying attention to the pvp gear issue?
---
If you want to be better at fighting Rogues, then play humans? Are we looking at the same racials? 
---
No, you'd play a Dwarf. Without Stoneform you literally cannot re-stealth if you're poisoned, and you can use it to remove blind. It is literally the closest thing vanilla rogues get to Cloak of Shadows.
---
The guy has a point.  Google Trends aint exactly showing a lot of excitement either.

Imo, 
---
#Dwarf!
---
They've said they have no current plans in regards to TBC or any other classic expansion but are open to hearing from the community when the time comes. So they don't even know what the future holds for Classic and probably won't make any decisions for a few years.
---
its because in combat you damage their hooves to the point where the questgiver doesnt want them.
---
0% if you go for dagger spec.
---
if you want to pay 1k+ gold for an item that is arguably worse than something you can find in dire maul, go ahead bud
---
Make friends in high school
---
Keep said friends

Incorrect XP values have been fixed on all major servers for the better part of a year. Try harder.
---
Dwarf is much better. Stoneform out of Blind, Stoneform out of bleeds/poisons for safe vanish.
---
Yes, social status.
---
Hey, thanks for the feedback. The dungeons/instances are listed by level (or chronologically) at the moment which I think makes sense. Will consider alphabetising the rest however.
---
...Said the hacker who just injected malware into the machines of over 300 World of Warcraft players. 
---
His plan was all coming together...
---
Jk
---
July 16th.
---
Its been some time, however I remember (if we're talking live side) warlocks having a succubus pet that could seduce.  I would also put a warlock up there on ability to AoE multiple targets at once for CC.  Having a warlock for the rats was always great!
---
I have it on zero authority it will release August 8.
---
Huh? When did I mention anything about grammar? You're an odd fella.   
---
If you have a misinterpreted view of what ahead of the curve means, ie. being ahead of the *majority* of the server, then that's on on you. There's no argument to be lost or won here, now move along.
---
Oh,Does the dwarf racial removes blind?
---
Ok I watched the video again. I guess this is more viable than I first gave credit for. But I stand by my original guess that there's no way he will get his level 5 wand before say level 10. He may get his level 13 wand on time but the extra time spent on the alt, crafting, and grinding mobs instead of questing will put him behind the pack slightly. Under optimal conditions, he will get his 13 wand at level 13 while people focused on speed leveling will be at least level 15 and can get the slightly inferior vendor wand. So he will enjoy added dps from 13 to 22 until BFD quest wand is available. The more likely scenario is things won't go as efficiently as planned and the level gap will be greater.
---
If he or anyone else can coordinate with another player on this strategy then I think it will be super effective.
---
Killing other players is nice, but dominating your class within your faction would be sick. Dwarf rogues kinda freak me out in the way Orc rogues do.
---
Thanks for this dont mind running a combat spec but didnt want do run swords
---
I used Mac most of my life and wanted to better understand how computers worked so I built a gaming rig. 
---
I spent $1200 on a rig that lasted me 6 years before I had to upgrade any parts. It's really not hard to put together a PC from YouTube videos, I'm borderline retarded and I somehow managed to do it first try.
---
Itaintmuchbutitshonestwork.meme.jpeg
---
I could be wrong but I think armor is something tanks use.
---
Agreed. This is VASTLY different then the way it played out originally. The BEST gear will be available and it is now from pvp. Considering PvP is only world fighting and ganking, the most efficient way to get it is to spam gank and farm areas where you know people HAVE to be.
---
This is going to be very bad if they do not release some BGs at the same time. I do not know why people think it will be just like old school. It will not.  The timing of the gear coming out is going to be game breaking for that period of time. The hardcore people will just plain win everything due to t2.5 gear being available and they will be about the only ones ABLE to get it.
---
Pretty sure it did...
---
Whichever one you like more aesthetically. The one you're more likely to get to 60.
---
Something something, stickied mod post on no pc spec posts
---
Being critcapped means you have more crit that can fit into the 100% hit table, meaning only your autohits will be able to crit but your specials wont benefit anymore from it. At that point, you need to hit to add to the table in order to also increase your crit.
---
Unpopular opinion - I would prefer the game to come out in September hahaha.
---
There is so much fun sht to do in the summer.  Seriously folks.    
---
Binge playing wow during the winter months?  Now that sounds perfect!  
---
That said, let's go already!
---
No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Naebliss. I AM the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!

---
That is the worst part about being ganked over and over by a lvl 60 rogue, there is 0 you can do about it besides getting a bodyguard to watch over you the entire time. The only thing I could ever do was have an alt on the other continent to level up instead. In some cases you can't even hearth out since they sit on you and kill you the second you start casting it.
---
Christ
---
Seems like it lol
---
April?
---
Druid: We can sneak in elite places like Darkwisper Gorge to mine the thorium there. Root is handy.
---
We can use Barkskin + Hurricane and AoE farm inside dungeons.
---
We can sleep dragonkin in UBRS and druids in pvp.
---
We can facepalm everytime a guy is screaming for a Battle-res but wont take a second to tell you where he died. 
---
We can heal really slow, really effecient and for huuge numbers. 
---
We can RP as a psychotic murderous moose with our tier gear.
---
You heard the man Blizzard. Give us release date.
---
Same here in Chile, South of South America. Can't wait to grind some boars while drinking Mate 🍵 and eating Sopaipillas
---
Will be looking forward to use it.
---
I'm Mr Adultman and I do business
---
Depends on gear. Until people start getting Rank 12 armor the result of the fight is mainly decided by who opens up first. 
---
Once you get enough stamina to survive the initial onslaught, yea stoneform is nice.
---
Mount Reserved
---
Thanks. Mac sucks.
---
Yep, its april.  Whats your question about it?
---
So you won’t be lonelyyy...
---
A raspberry pi cannot run a modern wow client.
---
Possible, of course. Why though? Just to say it's possible? It's going to be a nightmare to play. 
---
I swear Pis exist solely for people to say "I got X running on a Pi".
---
You are a lot more optimistic than I am. I just hope people have matured a bit more since original vanilla days, but even before the honour system was added people would corpse camp anyone they could in STV. It wasn't about any physical reward, just knowing that someone in the world is pissed off at them for not letting them play the game. Causing someone else angry and frustration IS their reward.
---
what do you mean no stats?  It has 355 armour
---
you think you do but you don't
---
My brain is lagging, "Total" field is not working currently or I can't find a button?
---
Do you keep them in the basement or the attic?
---
Replace Retribution Paladin with Elemental Shaman
---
OP, The probability you get t3 gear, or even epic pvp gear is really low, if you don’t plan to play at least 5/6 hours per day. Do you plan to do this? I’m just doing a reality check here
---
So easy to get skinning levels though!
---
Anyone would take that first pair of shoulders or a helmet though, stats or no stats.  I’m even guilty of buying them off the AH.
---
I always preferred Desolace, that name is right, no one goes there. It is usually a ghost town so just grinding away working on your profession is the best way to spend your level 30s and hopefully make enough for a mount by lvl 40.
---
I think once there is a release date I will be less obsessed.  I think part of the reason they aren't announcing a release date other than the fact it would give them a deadline is that it drives all of us crazy and creates hype.
---
retcon REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

Also happy cake day.

If you're gonna be pedantic about the use of the word "need" then there's no point discussing much at all. You don't **need** anything but food, water and air.
---
People aren't being impatient about the game actually coming out, people just want a **date** so that they can book that time off to play.
---

Can’t wait for the negative stats again
---
I've been out of the game for about 10 years and I find it hard to figure out all the acronyms being tossed around. Come to think about it, I still had trouble with them 10 years ago. I would appreciate a guide for any and all acronyms on the game; other class talent trees, even the simplest ones like LFG :) 
---
Its honestly something I would permanently keep open on my second screen. 
---
For example I just learned BIS (Best In Slot) the other day. Could not figure it out on my own. Binds.... something.....Soul? Far as I could get.
---
I remember buying some terrible helm that had a higher lvl req than I was for my warlock back in the day to motivate me to level up lmao
---
lel no changes

and elemental slots are cloth?

The alliance has like four different zones that cover the level range the Barrens does. They generally have much larger zone variety than Horde does.
---
Well yes, But no.
---
Fury tanking is done because it generates a hell of a lot more threat then prot tanking does. This allows your top preformer DPS Wars, Warlocks to go harder. More DPS, Boss dies quicker.
---
Shadowpriests bring a buff to help the warlocks, that's why they are brought in the first place. Ele shamans its just not the case. That said the reason it doesn't work, is that all those quick boss kills are prep for the longer fights. Your going to be hard pressed to find a guild that will want to throw gear at an ele shaman when they will be OOM on just about every fight in AQ40.
---
Should I play pserver? I'm so hyped I can't wait but I want to save all this will and desire for the real launch

I actually took my vacation in June this year to make sure I spend my vacation.... Doing vacation things! And not spending all my summer in doors ^^,

RE: peacemaker - this item doesn't drop until patch 1.4, and, by that time, dire maul will be released. the king from dire maul north drops barbarous blade which has 1 crit and 60AP. 
---
RE: marksman's girdle - this item drops off of a boss that you need to have completed a portion of the T0.5 chain to summon. the T0.5 chain doesn't come out until patch 1.10
---
can't speak to the hunter-specific gear question though since I've never played one at end-game myself. realistically, i'd think it doesn't matter much for the average player anyway. the 3% hit scope recipe should likely drop from MC early enough
---
Another useful community resource from Teeb!  You’re doing Azeroth’s work, Teeb.
---
If you have a pair of people in a super dense area, it can be very beneficial on the assumption it more than doubles your killspeed.
---
Most quests are more or less fetch quests which the extra people don't actually help and just cuts down on the mob XP.
---
It would be an even bigger shit show id they released a date and then had to push it.
---
I work in IT in Sweden and since our departement needs to have atleast 1 on call at all times, we have to spread out our vacation during the summer so we're making sure 1 is on site. We're just 3 people so it's a battle.

\*\*&lt;Nightshift&gt;\*\* | Server: NA-PvP | Faction: Horde | Off-peak Hours
---
\*\*Intro:\*\* &lt;Nightshift&gt; is an international guild for any Classic WoW players who want to play and raid during off peak hours on a US realm.
---
\*\*Raid Schedule:\*\* So far it's early days, so there's still a few decisions to make. Regarding raid times, we'll narrow it down later with a survey. At the moment, the plan is to have 2 scheduled raids a week, starting some time in the AM (EST/EDT.)
---
Raid loot will be distributed by a loot council - made up of officers, plus 1 random raid member for transparency.
---
\*\*Looking for:\*\* Anyone with an unusual schedule who has a passion for Classic and a good attitude. Applications for raiders are currently open for all classes. If you're interested in an officer position, please be sure to provide more information on your application. Purely social members are always welcome.
---
\*\*Moving forward:\*\* As for the form the guild will take in the future, it depends on various factors but it will be somewhere between a casual and semi-hardcore type raiding guild. We may strive for greatness but our primary goal will always be having fun!
---
\*\*Apply:\*\* If this sounds interesting please check out the link below:

Gnomes are pitiful and disgusting, but their anti-snare is going to do them wonders regardless of what class they are. Don't ever underestimate slows/snares in WPvP. If you get rooted and the enemy faction pushes even an inch it spells doom to you and whoever else is stuck.
---
Bought Risk of Rain 2 last weekend with my mates for only 20 bucks. One of those rare times where early access is worth it. Solid indie game with hours of mindless fun. Highly recommend if you're looking for something to kill time.
---
Save it! If you need a WoW fix try another expansion, but save Classic for Classic I say.
---
I haven't misinterpreted anything, that's your claim. Anyway, have a nice day.
---
Specifically in tu madres closet so I can access them in between shags 😁
---
Yeah but then you'd have to be a gnome.  And for many that cost it just too high.
---
classicwow is no joke &gt;:( 
---
jk you got me
---
Not sure this is a good metric to judge Classic WoW interest.  Of the seven people I know who will be playing Classic WoW on day 1 and are very excited, only one of them are active on Reddit.  Hell, I'm not even subscribed to this sub, despite posting here occasionally and lurking here all the time.
---
To piggy back off of this, notice the lack of consumables. For melee and tanks consumable costs for competitive guilds is quite daunting. 
---
Looking at his weapon though it appears that he probably spent a good deal of gold on that Arcanite Reaper ;)
---
I'll take "*What is Tab Targeting*" for 500, Alex.
---
My favorite was to psych scream someone near an edge so they'd have to blow their trinket. Then you MC them off the edge.
---
Or the best BM was playing with my Ele Shaman friend. I'd MC someone to the edge so he could Thunderstorm them off.
---
Thanks, that helps a lot. Why would hunters be favored with paladins though? Just because of the lack of Windfury, or is Blessing of Salvation or something better for hunters?
---
Enlighten us on what you plan to do on your wonderfull vacation
---
True, but that only really helps if you already **know** an enemy rogue or druid is approaching or nearby.
---
It all pales in comparison to Mountain Lion Blood in Hillsbrad.
---
Same boat plzzzz info
---
now this is true dedication, buying a domain, writing the web code all to make a meme
---
much more rewarding to play with a bunch of friends but take the triple of the time to reach 60 then to play alone and reach 60 faster in my opinion. Enjoy the journey back home
---
actually theres a screenshot of someone running wow in 2015 on a RP 2. the RP 3B+ is much stronger.
---
Bahahaha you are cute. EPEEEN ON THE INTERWEBZ.
---
I cannot wait for you to get camped until your eyes bleed! lololol.
---
Could be worse my Brother, my Honeymoon is mid-July til late August.
---
Keep in mind that while its a nice super short anti-snare, it still requires you stop moving and cast it -- which also resets your swing timer.
---
So its good, but not nearly to the same degree I would consider dwarf, orc or undead racials.
---
Gnome if u are looking for wpvp
---
that was me in beta lol. i had 70g only played for 8 hours or so
---
will do man, we are going home!
---
People get so entitled acting like theyre owed this game. It gets worse when people complain about not being able to book vacation time. The level of entitlement needed to demand blizzard and their job cater to their binge gaming is next level.
---
Of course not. In the middle of the night there are far fewer people playing. I'd be surprised if there was a queue at that hour, it wasn't during vanilla.
---
Straightforward mats though, EZ levels
---
Its because its Plate, which can't be below level 40.  So for most players going from 39-40 using a crappy green mail helm, it still has a substantial armor improvement.
---
Sometimes not everything needs to be a god mode blue/purple.
---
Good luck. Building a consistent, non-buggy hover is the most difficult thing I've tried to do so far!
---
Leave the house at least? Change the surroundings, travel to another country, visit friends and family... So many options, gaming is a time waster for me, but i realise some might feel differently.
---
30m HS wtf?
---
I can only think of a few items that had negative stats, like Deliah's ring, the heart amulet from ZF and the corrupted Ashbringer.
---
I hate the alliance but I had an alliance Priest on ND and I joined some WPvP guild (I forgot it's name) and we went to defend RR from you guys. It went on for a while until you wanted to duel our GM and he obliged. He whooped your ass and then you told your bois to open up on us and we still beat ya. You guys have a long way to go before you do anything worthwhile in the WPVP scene.
---
If this thing will be accurate, I thing I will use it a lot.

They're working more then a year in this game, they already said some improvements ll come, Restructured DB, re-encoding old shit, I'm sure graphic improvements will come, new models maybe, this is totally expected, i'll not be surprised if they put the cross-realm implementation in the new classic (feature i'm against, to be honest), but all major improvements that don't mess with gameplay will surely come.
---
Actually this is the main reason I ll come back, cause any bullshit pserver can provide this untouchable classic experience  
---
I played the 2004 wow classic already, and Cataclism gave me a nasty feeling, so I looked for pservers and some servers totally fulfill my nostalgia..
---
So don't be innocent guys, it ll not be the exactly same game
---
If you're let's say one of the top healers in a guild and end up having to miss a raid or two because something big was going on...family event, health issue, emergency, a big exam, whatever it is, the DKP system docks your 'pay' while the Loot Council system is able to give you 'sick days'.
---
Also I mean just think about how much collective brain power your entire guild's leadership has to use in order to sort out all the various kinks in the DKP system. How do you handle rot gear? How do you handle decay? How do you handle new recruits? Off specs? Minor upgrades for one player that would be major upgrades for another?
---
Loot Council doesn't have to bother with any of that stuff. New recruit? Here take whatever items are going to rot or be sidegrades for our current raiders, maybe ask them to just put some Nexus Crystals in the guild bank. Old main raider coming back from a 2 month break? Continue giving the BiS gear to the people who have been with you during this whole time, but he can pick up less crucial gear. You don't have to worry about whether or not your decay rate was set well enough. Something drops that's a 5% boost for one person, but a 15% boost for another? Long as their attendance and performance is similar you just give it to who will benefit most in the interest of the overall group being strongest.
---
DKP starts to make more sense in a theoretical game with hundreds of players raiding together where it's basically impossible to personally know each and every person on the team and what they're contributing. Even then you'd probably just come up with a branched Loot Council system with 'managers' for groups of players/roles.
---
I'm sure there's some form of DKP system out there that would do a better job than the ones I've seen, but honestly it's just so much easier to have human beings making the decisions for the good of the team.
---
I remember hitting 40 on my warrior and being stoked to buy plate from the AH.
---
Thought he was just on that island with all the elite dragonkin. Couldn't you go see him if you were dedicated enough??
---
The more the merrier. This term doesn’t exactly translate to more exp, but it does translate to more fun. Play the game, whether it’s with 4 others or by yourself, seek the most fun option. I know this isn’t the answer you are looking for but it is what it is.
---
I level all of my characters in about 6 days played and that's just my normal leveling speed.  I don't do professions or long class chains that aren't worth it.  In my personal experience the air/water quests are a waste of time when I'd rather be questing and leveling and I don't need them to level my shaman.
---
Once again, the guy up above all this said " not getting all totems would make shaman leveling unbearable", and in my PERSONAL experience and OPINION, that's not true at all, because I PERSONALLY myself have only ever leveled using Earth/Fire.  
---
If you think they're needed then do whatever the F you wanna do.  I don't know why you're taking my PERSONAL OPINION so personally yourself.  The fact is...they're not needed and leveling won't be "unbearable" without them...and that's a fact.
---
You can do the questing stuff in small groups but trying to get everyone geared up can be fun in dungeons. Your priest needs the chapeau still? Let’s run SM Cathedral for the 9th time together!
---
What is that? Sounds interesting
---
Isn't he in dustwallow somewhere?
---
I loved this too with every new season of GoT. Whenever it started to cool down I knew "winter is coming".
---
Yeah in Dustwallow marsh somewhere I think.
---
Dwarf!
---
my condolences
---
Where I live we celebrate "Mid summers eve" June 21 this year. So we celebrate that we actually get our week of summer and sun, while you just started yours :O
---
*"I like business... transactions."*
---
How can you not mention Mind Controlling people off cliffs?
---
This explanation makes sense a lot of the time, like yeah I can understand why fighting a bear would most likely damage its fur, making it hard to extract a pristine pelt from it, but how hard is it to kill a horse without damaging its hooves?
---
This is the correct response.
---
Hi, I asked the same question on the Druid + WL pair, as that's what I want to roll with a friend:
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ackazs/druid\_warlock\_duo\_leveling\_mechanics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ackazs/druid_warlock_duo_leveling_mechanics/) 
---
I don't know what's better, but I feel Druid will give you more options / variety, if you want it. I'm going Druid because that's what I want to raid with in the end game. It will give you plenty of options to try out while leveling (I have no idea whats optimal):
---
Bear + Fire Shield + Thorns + Rain of Fire (or Dots)
---
Hurricane + Barkskin + Rain of Fire (or Dots)
---
Roots + Nature Dots + Heals + VW + WL Dots + Fear
---
Cat + VW + Dots
---
I also want to run every 5 man, and I don't have the time to wait for groups due to limited playing time, so Druid will let me fill more roles and find groups a bit faster.
---
Yeah, he’ll tell you to hearth, so you do. 30-40m of questing later he’s telling you to hearth again leaving you stranded and scratching your head.
---
Got a guild for classic yet? Making a norwegian guild if interested.
---
Comparing a reddit sub numbers to the actual number of people looking to play is pretty daft.
---
...can't be accurate 1.12 loot tables / spawns
---
Definitely. For me, someone has to fill in when I take time off. That means it has to be approved far in advanced unless something very unexpected happens (death in the family, that sort of thing).
---
I NEED A RELEASE DATE BLIZZARD!! &lt;3
---
So bullshit hunters can’t tame these.. also bullshit they don’t have a unicorn silver elite for these guys
---
It really depends on the guild. In my guild I was the MT in vanilla. The OT and I would share gear pretty often. If I was getting a little too far ahead on gear, I'd give some gear to him. We tried to distribute it pretty evenly.
---
These raptors don’t drop stolen silver!!!
---
Where is mankirks wife???
---
Chuck Norris LOL
---
They gain 1kg of body weight
---
I really need to know what server they roll on. Hopefully the only RP PVP server - that'd be sick
---
That’s when I realized he was calling it “vanilla” but doing it in a later expac. Then I found quest name issues all over Ashenvale and the Nesingwary chains in STV. Quests blizzard changed later on to avoid confusion because some chains like Raene’s Cleansing has like 8-10 steps all called the same thing in Vanilla.
---
Somebody set up us the release date.
---
Because PvP server
---
Dreamwalker set would like to have a word..
---
I think quell sarrar or something and the ring from deadmines
---
Yes, and most are born without hooves.
---
I egoistically want it to be later than that, cause I'm leaving around the 18-21 of july, and don't wanna miss the launch... Hope you tin foil hatted legends are wrong, but just by a bit, so I don't miss either!
---
Dwarf, while smelly drunken fools  -- I will acknowledge their racial is very strong.  Being able to remove bleeds / disease / poison and increasing armor gives them a significant advantage in many matchups compared to their alliance counterparts.
---
Where will be the best place to find it? No idea where people generally put leveling guides, let alone vanilla-specific leveling guides.
---
What about that scorpid venom quest in the flats in 1k needles?
---
[No](http://classicdb.ch/?item=18348), and [no](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1156)?
---
I ran a test on this. Leveled a mage to 10. Then did the same exact thing with my brother to 10. The times were actually close however in a group you will need to tag a lot more mobs while running around. Now that’s only to 10. I can’t speak to 60.
---
Grouping as 5 is going to be absolutely horrible.  
---
1. You will have to grind to keep up with quest level requirements. Even leveling duo, you are required to grind throughout to keep up with quest requirements. Duo leveling can be beneficial with some slower classes, such as warriors and rogues (not necessarily those two classes together), but more than 2 will always be far slower and significantly worse. 
---
2. None of you will have any gold for a mount at 40, or much else for that matter 
---
I highly advise against leveling in groups of anything more than 2 people.
---
That makes sense, those do make a gigantic difference. I loved getting them on my dwarf against shaman with aspect of the wild on.
---
Do you happen to have a solid source on resists in vanilla? Would be fun to theory craft with it
---
Salty Scorpid venom....
---
Yeah I agree, I won't have time like I used to when I was younger, now that I work full time I'll be limited and being able to tank will be a lot better. I also like the priest class more in lore and such but the capabilities a druid has kind of wins in playability. At least until endgame.
---
I never said anything about how much I know about the game. I only ever got through BWL in Vanilla as a tank. 
---
When I played Vanilla, I never heard of anyone downing Rag when everyone in the raid was in greens and dungeon blues lol.
---
Also, some quests have despawning items to grab. One person grabs it and now you have to wait for it to respawn
---
Mac is stable and the OS is good, but the hardware and apple logo are grossly marked up and overpriced.
---
I built an overkill of a water cooled Ryzen / GTX1080ti rig from scratch for $1,700 including monitor and software.  $1,700 is baseline after tax for a macbook pro 13".
---
Dear lord, yes
---
It’s a quote from breaking bad. I probably will get camped, everyone probably will. But with my rating, titles, and achieves it won’t be hard for me to end up in another top pvp guild so...
---
The main tank can’t always make every raid due to life happens. At that point everyone will look to you to step up and shoulder the burden, so expect to get gear that’s a big upgrade for you and marginal upgrade for the MT.
---
But with any serious progression raid there is the expectation of farming consumables and repair bills.
---
Better to just roll with the punches IMO. I know this is not a popular opinion, but just do your corpse runs and do the best you can. If somewhere is LOADED with gank squads, either move out of the way enough to grab another quest or grinding area or jump zones but go MINIMALLY in distance as you need to. We’re all going to get ganked but the worst thing you can do is constantly try to avoid it as far as leveling speed. Also, wow players are like wild animals:  more likely to chase you if you run, less likely if you move with confidence like “bring it on motherfucker”. Dead serious
---
Only thing I find interesting in your plan is visiting friends.
---
Yeah, we need it. People have jobs they want to step away from to play at the start. If the date comes too late you may not be able to reserve that time.
---
Aren't you ignoring the "grind to level X" stuff?
---
That is one angry dookie.
---
Yep,
---
So I agree in that purely questing unless its a difficult escort or elite quest you're better off flying solo.
---
If you're looking to speed grind in a mob arena, then a group is beneficial again under the assumption you can do so with no downtime and a significantly faster kill speed.
---
You see it's a a zhevra not a zebra
---
Ok I like coffee too
---
Raiding was dead long before the TBC patch. The TBC patch just finished it when it was down.
---
You do have a point. I also doubt that 8.2 and Classic will come at the same time.
---
you would think so but thats what i had when i stopped playing.
---
\- Can be a complete joke in every other area of the game but an absolute GOD in WSG due to flag running capabilities.
---
\- Can teleport to a zone created specifically for my class. 
---
\- Has up to four different playstyles while levelling.
---
\- Can turn into an amazing god damn sea cow with increased movement and unlimited breath in water. 
---
\- Gets Circle of of Cenarius rep and lore far FAR before any other class.
---
I said it once and I’ll say it again. Being Horde on Shattered Hand was rough! Death and Taxes, Skyfang and WarEnsemble. They bullied us with superior gear but I managed to get kills here and there...
---
1. Bloody Bone Necklaces in STV.
---
2. Salty Scorpid Venom in Shimmering Flats.
---
3. Everything else.
---
Raptor heads, horns, beaks and zhevra hooves should all be completed when moving between other quests. They're only tedious when you focus on them.
---
A group of 5 might be a bit of overkill in the strictest terms of efficiency, but trust me: go for it. 
---
One of the biggest challenges to leveling in Vanilla is minimizing downtime. Grouping with just one other person means you'll spend vastly more time fighting and playing than bandaging and drinking. While the XP penalties for grouping don't make the leveling that much quicker in the long run (although being able to murder elites and gankers goes a long way) you'll have a lot more fun and the 60 grind will be a lot less painful. Enjoy!
---
Side note: I read somewhere that the most efficient party size in terms of kill speed + XP gains is 3.
---
This was the same way my Vanilla guild worked. Dedicated MT got first dibs, OT would be kept fairly closely geared, and one or two of the DPS Warriors would be given redundant gear after the MT &amp; OT for when we needed backup due to mechanics or absences.
---
Yea that's 1 person on a private server and it took them nearly 5 days played. I never played on a private server but aren't they slightly different than Blizzard servers?  Less people, don't have to worry about mob tagging, getting ganked, etc? 
---
Regardless, I highly doubt that there will be 40 of those people, all playing on the same server. Maybe I'm wrong but I just really don't see it happening. Yea, people know more about the game now but that doesn't take away from the fact that it wasn't easy to blast through MC unless most of your raid was in partial epics.
---
 website updated :
---
* changing how item's image and tooltip are loaded from sync to async with a loader on every item
---
* changing the animation for specialization and faction
---
A screenshot? I need to see video evidence. 
---
I doubt it will run the legion client of classic.
---
Success! Great Tool. I agree with a previous poster that being able to see what buff each consumable will give you would be nice.
---
only reason I looked into this :D as an EU player i just heard it recently on a pserver and never on other pservers I played on (or can't remember it being called vc at all) first time I thought the group was looking for ppl for VC (last Boss) only somehow
---
Tears of Grief (or something like that), best off-hand for the level, haha
---
What’s the verdict on gnome vs dwarf rogue for pvp? I feel like many times when you’d use escape artist you’d vanish, ie frost novad. I think removing poisons and bleeds may be better from a rogue standpoint which is why I still think gnome&gt;dwarf for warriors.
---
Is that optimizing rested XP or just burning right through as fast as possible IRL time as well?
---
There are obviously situations where one race will be better than the other but if I was going to roll a Rogue for PvP I would roll Gnome. Escape Artist can turn the tide quickly on a Mage.
---
In the US, April is when taxes are due and most accountants aren't allowed or able to get time off during the month.
---
You forgot about shaman tanking
---
Hey, at least you can transmog it! Oh wait.....
---
I recognize that Cape! It only had stamina if I recall.
---
Wow that is solid for its level.  Very few items ever give more than 1 or 2 stats at like level 10.
---
[Tears of Grief](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5611)
---
If you see the human activate perception you can vanish in stealth to increase your stealth and haul ass out of perception range, wait for it to seize, reengage. 
---
No such thing with escape artist which can be used twice in a lenghty 1v1.
---
Nah, he chillin' in dustwallow marsh with his dragon bois.
---
Nice binds.
---
I kissed your dad.
---
What is Kargath raid with 15melees piling on top of each other?
---
“Send me back.”
---
I was 100% ready to come in this thread and piss and moan about another one of these having a countdown to a release date that doesnt exist.
---
Kudos, OP.  I like this one.
---
Charge at #7. How long are your fingers?!
---
Take time off in mid/late August, dude. Sure, taking time off right at release is ideal (that's what I'm holding out for too) but better safe than sorry. You legit do not want to spend July 16-31 sitting around pissed off that you're on vacation and Classic isn't out yet.
---
Besides, if you take mid August, you can always catch the flu or get food poisoning or kill off a family member if release happens in July =\]
---
What part of Australia are you in? Everyone has one here. It gets to 5 degrees which will make other people laugh but it's cold for us
---
"much stronger" of something that is super weak to begin with still makes it weak. It can barely run most shaders in an emulator let alone the current game client.
---
Just saying. It can probably be done with a modified client but not retail. A lot would have to be stripped from the engine.
---
Not a link to the one with minus stats, though.
---
But yes - solid one obtainable in level 11 already!
---
[Link to Vanilla item](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=5611/tear-of-grief)
---
Yea stop complaining the small indie company can't put out servers fast enough. Its not like private servers ran by a small groups of people do the same thing on a regular basis or anything right? Life's gotta be so hard to be a blizzard developer.
---
Man, theres a lot of things that are frustrating about where i work, but holy shit am i glad i dont have to give months of notice to use my vacation.  I had no idea how common that was until i started reading all the threads here about it.
---
Level 60 rogues can make a tidy amount by sneaking through BRD and pick-pocketing everything that moves.
---
Most accountants dont do taxes.  Everyone is different.  Some people have a busy month end.  Some are busy at quarter or year end.
---
For me, in my current role, its typically busiest the first week of a new quarter.
---
It still is only 1min CD and removes *all* snares. Mage has CoC + frost nova on you? Escape artist and you run top speed again. 
---
No crippling poison kiting to restealth, no hamstring kiting between 3.8 swings, no wing clip kiting to wait for trap CD to wear off. 
---
The better the players in the fights, the better gnome gets as lots of better players keep their distance throughout a fight by various tools and for various intentions.
---
Stoneform is very strong! I am partial to Escape Artist! I think most people don’t like the look of Dwarves which is why they turn a blind eye to Stoneform.
---
FF14 Shadowbringer expansion come out July 2. I hope they won't try to be dicks and release Classic too early (with technical problems) just to cut the grass under Square Enix feet.
---
Haha, my first thought. ;)
---
You do realize that ele shams are one of the rarest breeds of dps to find in a raid.
---
Shoot for August, Classic will definitely be out by then.
---
I don't see waiting until 31 for seal of command as seriously gimping myself. You get +5% str and int instead and the ability to tank if you cannot find a warrior or bear to do it for you. Seal of command is better damage than righteousness but it's not game changing.
---
You get your first shoulders around level 18ish, and first helm around 25ish.
---
pm me if you'd like to join our discord!
---
If we don't I'll cry
---
Escape Artist is a must for PvP Warriors, I'll attest to that; but I can't really see how it would benefit a Rogue all that much.
---
I run as powershifting and it is pretty damn fun. As long as you aren't in a guild that min-maxes a douchey amount then you will have no problems finding a spot and performing. Let's be honest, MC clears are more than doable with "weird" specs and if you wipe because a few people in your raid are feral/ret/enhancement, you have bigger problems. Feral won't pull crazy top tier DPS, but it will not be at the bottom of the pack either. Plus you bring combat rez, innervate, curse and poison removal, emergency heals, etc. so make sure you aren't "that" druid that sits in cat form instead of popping out to throw some heals or spells when the situation calls. We are a hybrid class and should be played as such.
---
I feel like there are going to be a lot more guilds that are more relaxed and won't require people to spec cookie cutter. I don't plan on being in a cutting edge progression guild, I just want to raid for fun and clear as much content as my time investment allows.   
---
Basically, yes they are definitely viable and able to perform. Just look for the right guild/people and you will have a blast. You don't have to go powershifting if you don't want, that is what I decided to do because it's a very unique play style and I didn't do it back in the day so it was a nice change.
---
50s starting gold iirc? Absolutely not going to get 70g from 8 hours of play through levels 1-30. Not ever in true 1.12 client data without serious AH working
---
The OG! Was bummed out when the model got upgraded, kinda prefer the older look.
---
Rogue vs rogue is decided in the opener. The one opening with a hemo spec + dal'rends or heartseeker+ will end the rogue in the opener + kidney by sheer burst.
---
So dwarf poison removal is not nearly as useful as escape artist, because you are dead before blinds come into play.
---
On the other hand escape artist has a use in *all* matchups and even more so when people use engineering trinkets like net-o-matic.
---
I am not. The one I’m currently working on does include that however.
---
I remember that day. It was an officer of ours that challenged your gm, Mans. Everyone agreed to watch the fight, but I remember someone healed your dude, so we jumped in and wiped YOU.  Lets trade recordings :)
---
I played SPriest from Launch until I quit before WOTLK dropped.
---
I'm UK that's our end of tax year. I presumed that your busy period.
---
I'm from England but yeah this haha
---
Ah I see, I didn't know that
---
A google search of Fenn’s Vanilla Guide should do the trick
---
No you did not. It's simply impossible to gather 70g in 8h of play. Items at lvl 1-15 are just not worth enough. Some copper here, some copper there and the occasional silver. 
---
I don't think loot tables in beta for mobs in the &lt;15 range had loot worth more than a handful of silver. And that's blues only.
---
Well said
---
Thank you for sharing your opinion.
---
It is truly new and original
---
The economics will entirely depend on population and saturation, to start. One server with the same pop can have more folks making it, lowering the price while another server with a higher population can have fewer people making it, driving up the price.
---
Supply, demand. No two servers are the same for a whole host of reasons.
---
Alright pal thanks for all the informative answers. appreciate it!
---
BFA is that way buddy ——&gt;
---
Oh wow you mean uncommon and rare gear is just that? Whodda thunk
---
Holla if you need some stuff done
---
I wanted to have one PC to do it all and I liked the idea of having a Mac. I bought a MacBook Pro and it played a lot of games but man that thing would get so hot I would almost burn my hands on the keyboard!!! I ended up giving the MacBook to my GF...
---
You have 2 other options that will serve you better.
---
1. Build a desktop PC. You can build a beast PC for way less and get a couple monitors as well! 
---
2. If you need a laptop for mobility purposes, buy something like an Asus ROG gaming laptop! Laptops all have some pros and cons. Weigh them out but never compromise on COOLING!!! You want a laptop that blows hot air out of the BACK not the bottom... Remember any device running at peak temperatures for long enough will burn out and break down.
---
At the end of the day it’s Classic on the WotLK engine. Don’t over think it but make an informed decision and be prepared to deal with the consequences. Good luck!
---
These are the moments I just find a weird area nobody is at and grind mobs for hours.    It's good gold and depending on the situation can be better than questing
---
No, and if you could you'd get like 2 fps. You probably want to run the game on your main PC and stream it to the handheld device instead.
---
Yeap that’s part of classic. Let’s go raid In our PvP specs and do terrible or let’s go PVP in our PVE specs and do terrible. 
---
Or we farm gold and embrace the pain. #nochanges
---
what are muchbu tits?
---
Coordinating with others would be ideal. You can trade your skins to a LW for the greens and linen to Tailor for the greens, but the solo plan is just a backup if that doesn’t work out. I don’t anticipate many people leveling LW from the start, so an alt might be needed.
---
Suggested improvements: adding accurate bis lists
---
There was someone here saying they had 1000g when they hit 60 in vanilla
---
Like OK bro
---
Barring really lucky world drops or crazy fast min-maxer nolifers taking advantage of the empty supply economy, the typical level to 60 netted you like 50g back in the day
---
It's honestly kind of rough being a pure tank in vanilla. Not a lot of raidspots and the role is a high responsibility role in raid, often the MT  is the gm or raid leader. Sure a dps warrior might tank, but being a pure tank at 60 is kind of thankless for endgame content for most people so not a lot of people do it. Worth adding that warriors are also great dpsers who also has a bigger chance of getting a raid spot, so a lot of potential tanks get pigeonholed down that road instead.
---
Everyone join the 3rd server in the list of whichever kind you want to be on PVP/PVE
---
No stats? Tell that to the whopping 355 armour!
---
Be a bear off-tank and you won't have to worry about gear competition. :)
---
&gt; Really hard.
---
So, a warrior?
---
Raging berserker's helm is lvl 38 from SM and every single warrior or paladin (and hunter) worth their salt is going to farm it like crazy. Nobody is going to wear this thing.
---
Still appreciated
---
Butterfly effect:
---
&gt; They change respeccing cost.
---
&gt; The need to farm gold diminishes. Players accumulate more and more gold.
---
&gt; Less players gather/mine to make gold.
---
&gt; The supply / offer drops.
---
&gt; World War III is declared.
---
Do you want to start WW3?
---
Shame on you.
---
Uh... yeah, it is. 
---
It's the seal you'll be using 99% of the time if you intend to play as Ret. You're welcome to talent, spec, gear, level however you wish; it's ultimately your journey and your time, I'm simply offering my point of view because Paladin is my forte, it's all I ever play.
---
If you're going to get Consecrate first, you're honestly just better off going full Holy, and doing the bulk of your leveling through dungeon runs. It's entirely doable, and you'll establish a reputation yourself as a competent healer.
---
If you don't want that, then I truly must insist that you level a Priest instead, you can easily go Shadow, level with very little downtime, and every dungeon up to 60.
---
Maybe if you like play a warrior one of your swings misses and cuts off a chunk of it's hoof?
---
Theres no constant dopamine injections you mean.
---
The main advantage is that you don’t have to play as an elf
---
Yeah, I'm interested to see what happens organically, which may be people reliving the old days or it may shift overtime, either way I think it will be amusing.
---
Thank you for the overview
---
Arcanite Reaper hooooo
---
Human deal better dps then a night elf in pve for sure
---
I was on The Forgotten Coast which was one of the last servers to be released before TBC so I don't remember it being quite as dead.
---
I ran combat daggers in vanilla and did well all the way into Naxx.  Never got my damn Deaths Sting though :(
---
These people are always around. When I played Vanillia there were people bragging about how they could reach max lvl in 2 days. That's not even possible if you're botting.
---
Your faster than me I expect hitting lvl 20 about 18 h in... but that’s still day 1 I want to hit 30 by end of day 2
---
AQ was hard as fuck
---
There is no such thing like too good weather for gaming. There's only lack of aircondition and shutters.
---
He was removed in a later patch
---
The Barrens giraffes have the same sound file as the goat demons in Diablo 2
---
Why would you do that knowing they only had 3 strikes at launch. I saw the writing on the wall after the beta and skipped anthem.
---
True... but horde had many great pvp players--and Relentless + a couple other decent guilds. Definitely alliance stacked though lol
---
I like it, for what you’re trying to achieve it’s an appropriate amount of effort, good job.
---
dorf hunter is automatic upvote my friend
---
Not going healer this time around because of that
---
Crystal clear exactly what i was looking for thank you so much
---
What bothers me if the game gives you several fantasy races to choose from yet most people choose dull boring human.
---
I get to be a human every time I go outside. Choose something fun, damn it!
---
The roleplay? I hope you know what Skyrim is. 
---
For the roleplay the stormcloaks always state that “True son’s of Skyrim” would fight the imperials for freedom. I wanted to take this theme and incorporate it into my character and play through. 
---
I created a Nord with the intention of using Heavy Armor and 2H weapons. Upon the opening scene I went with Ralof, the stormcloak soldier who helps you escape. 
---
Went and joined the stormcloaks immediately after finishing the tutorial. 
---
For any interaction I’m always thinking about what’s in the best interest for an independent Skyrim. I only use fellow Nord or mercenary fighters as I see fit. I do not use magic besides restoration. 
---
I’m still fleshing out the RP but when I go to the summit at High Hrothgar I will screw over the Stormcloaks so I can do more civil war quests and regain Skyrim for the nords. 
---
I have not decided on wherewolf or Vampire but I might take vampire so I can be the True Son of Skyrim forever.
---
Thanks for the responses!
---
It probably has a fair vendor price.
---
I know you noted it but I would love a boomkin set and some pvp stuff
---
I get hit so you don't have to. (:
---
I had a worse experience with scorpid venom iirc. The scorpid are all spread out, while the trolls are close together, and you also need the trolls for other quests too.
---
Cheers very useful information
---
Second that!
---
Great map, I never get tired of STVietnam-memes
---
Lier. I have vendortrashed all loot, and sold the occational green on AH. And im sitting on exactly 100g for mount after 39 levels of mobgrinding. Yes it's on a vanilla server, it might not be exactly as the original. But 70g in 8 hours of grinding mobs at that level is not realistic at all.
---
Uh, going healer is the best way to avoid needing to respec between raid and pvp specs.
---
This is it exactly. (Though I normally grind for beaks near crossroads right away, on my way to the centaur bracers quest.) Barrens gets a lot more fun when you think of it like a traveling salesman problem and turn in several quests every time you head back to camp.
---
Its because on early patches Savage Chain has defense on it but we are likely going to have 1.12 item values therefore no defense on the chain.
---
You make a good points but people here would rather have the game die in 1 year than admit that maybe Vanilla isn't some flawless masterpiece that can hold its own in 2019.
---
Find a spec that works in both PvP and PvE. If you want to play the minmax game, you'll have to pay for it. If you want everything for no effort you can always play retail.
---
I remember when WSG came out, wait times for horde were non-existent...while alliance wait times never dropped lower than 45 minutes.
---
Sure, but regardless of the number of crafters, do other applications of the ingredients (e.g. firebloom and illusion dust for wizard oil) push the price of making wzard oil up so high that it's never profitable?
---
e.g. if fireblooms are really valuable because alchemists can make a fortune making {essential item} from them, and wizard oils are not really valued by raiders, does the cost of making an oil exceed the value of it?
---
This should be knowable regardless of the number of enchanters.
---
Someone leveling their first character trying to tank will certainly wear this if it means replacing their old lvl 30 leather cap
---
Ok my dude. I would still post a screenshot but I don’t have access to beta servers.  But I am not gonna argue with you.
---
Chant it.  Problem solved
---
One of the few changes I'd like to see is ALL the holidays as they are in the current game.
---
The worst one is “PST PLZ”
---
Cool thing about being a tank, there’s generally only two people going for loot. You should be getting gear pretty easily. You can expect to farm the same amount of gear and mats as the main tank. If you’re not pushing for def cap and FR cap, you’re not pulling your weight. But, generally you can expect to wait for the main tank to get 5/8 T1, however lots of people do non-tier items based on need (except a shield will go directly to the MT).
---
Mmmmmm
---
There is no Focus Target in vanilla
---
I enjoyed reading this more than a novel for some reason.
---
yes but because of my work times, i'm going to be soloing a lot
---
How dare you, this is heresy. How am I supposed to angrily close the blinds to stop sunlight hitting my monitor and to dampen the noise of people frolicking and enjoying the fine weather if it's dark and miserable outside? *How?*
---
Oh fuck those raptors
---
Yes - my main was a Dwarf Hunter, and when 2.0 dropped I spent some time in AV grinding enough honor for the same weapon shown in your picture. I believe it was around 27-28k honor. I used it while leveling in TBC, but I don't recall exactly what I replaced it with - it was probably some dungeon drop in the high-60's.
---
Every other blizzard game has oce servers, even the ones nobody plays like HotS/d3. Granted they aren't anywhere near the scale of an mmo, but still. I'd imagine some of the oce retail servers are ghost towns right about now and they're still online.
---
I can't see them not giving us at least 1 server (pref 1 PvE and 1 PvP).
---
Maybe replay Warcraft 3 to get you in the mood.
---
If they are leveling blacksmithing alongside, they might craft this for the skill point and then wear it inside SM tanking their way to the Raging Berserker's Helm. They would still be wrong, as a cloth helm with +8 stamina is much better for tanking at lvl 40.
---
A group of 5, you need to compensate for this by pulling every mob you see and kill them.
---
If I remember correctly however, you get a small buff by being in a group (4xp?). I’ll say you have to kill 4 mobs instead of 5...
---
&gt; I'm about to have my first child next month and I can honestly say I've put more thought and effort into preparing for Classic WoW than for my unborn child. 
---
just this quote made me burst laughing, jesus christ Vanilla really is something special
---
Poof! The GM was gone
---
Yeah I’m gonna second this. No one is going to care about your race as long as you know your rotation and don’t stand in the fire (assuming you’re in a casual guild)
---
It really depends on the guild. Keep in mind that some fights have very high requirements on 2-3 tanks, so spreading the gear around makes sense. Allowing for real life obligations etc, many guilds will have 4+ 'main' or primary tanks that will divide defensive gear among themselves. 
---
For offensive gear, every guild will find a system that works for them. Personally, I don't think giving a single MT priority on each and every drop is the best way to do this, but ymmv.
---
From personal experience, raiding with a team of three or four tanks with a flat hierarchy is really fun. This might be a 'leading' tank who handles all the one-tank fights and three 'secondary' tanks. 
---
'High time investment' usually means near 100% raid attendance, when going with the alpha-MT approach. Spreading the loot sort of makes it okay to miss a raid once in a while, the guild will manage. So 'time investment' would not differ much between leading tank and secondary tanks when taking that approach. 
---
There are also fights where a Fury or two might be asked to put on a shield and hold an add. Personally I wouldn't call that an OT, it's just a fury with a shield and maybe a few tier pieces.
---
It depends on the caster's level (63 for bosses):
---
`(Resistance / (Caster's level * 5) * 0.75) * 100% = overall spell dmg% resisted`. 
---
The cap is 75% so over 315 against bosses or 300 against players does nothing.
---
Why are Wild Growth Spaulders paladin BiS starting from phase 5 although they can be acquired starting from phase 2? Also Cauterizing Band is not unique so technically BiS rings for druids, priests and paladins would be 2x Cauterizing instead of Cauterizing + Fordring's Seal.
---
Am I in the barren's chat already...
---
This is a big thing for my group of friends and myself. All of us have played hardcore solo and made the rush to max level. In my opinion, if you are making the attempt to get to max as fast as you can then leveling as a group is not the most efficient way. It will slow you down but it has its trade offs. Classic is not a sprint. It takes time to do things and why not enjoy the ride? You won’t miss out on everything if it takes you 1-2 weeks longer to hit max level. The most enjoyment I get out of the game is playing with my friends and taking a little bit longer. Right before BC, 5 of us leveled 1-60 together and that’s where most of the memories were made. Not by rushing solo and getting frustrated at times. 
---
Group play can also be a little rough. A big problem my group this time will be scheduling. We are don’t have the unlimited time to play every second together. We are going to try and roughly stay within a few levels of each other to run dungeons and do some quest when we can. 
---
If you want to get to max ASAP then I wouldn’t recommend group play as much. If you want to have fun with your friends while leveling then definitely group up. 
---
You don’t need to min/max everything in the game to have fun or be able to do stuff. If you miss out a bit you won’t be that far behind. Everyone won’t have BiS right away and push you out because you took longer to level. 
---
If you really enjoy min/maxing and pushing yourself to the fullest than by all means play that way. Don’t let anyone talk you into playing how you don’t want to play. 
---
In the end it’s up to you. How do you want to play the game? 
---
Like I said before classic is a marathon, not a sprint. Enjoy the game and don’t let min/max kill your fun, unless thats what you enjoy. 
---
Sorry for the long post, but that’s my thoughts.
---
Even. With bottling I doubt that is possible 4 days  makes more sense
---
July 16th my good man, blizzard used the word July during the blizzcon demo. with a level 16..... which also happens to be a Tuesday.. ya, I'm serious
---
now people may try to steer you otherwise. but do not allow such negativity to impact a fantastic gaming experience in wow classic on july 16th lets goo!
---
The options for Mage are focused on Frost builds. Can you also include if someone wants to go Fire or Arcane focused builds?
---
Its a small but noticeable margin. I always here Dagger spec this and Dagger spec that, but honestly, I actually never see anyone swap over.
---
NE vs HU Rogue for recruiting, if Im iffy on the guy already, itll probably tip the scale against him if hes NE, especially if (thats IF) Rogues are as popular as they usually are and you have to pick through 5 different random apps (for more developed guilds).
---
Do you know what happens when there is no respec cost?   
---
Raid geared players will steamroll R10 plebs all day, because they can just respec in the blink of an eye from a medium utility spec to hulk smash.
---
With a respec cost you only have a select few hardcore people respeccing all the time.
---
The rest will PvP in 31/5/15 or fury spec as warrior. 
---
Or combat as rogue.
---
Or 31/0/20 as mage.
---
It also changes guild dynamics.
---
A warrior going for R14 can raid as arms for couple months being less contributing than a fury warrior, however he will eventually get phat R14 weapon lewt to smash content in fury spec once it gets harder (Chromaggus and onwards)
---
\#nochanges
---
Can one of the raid days be Sunday?
---
I just hope they move the PVP gear rewards to a later patch. Having rank 13 weapons available at BWL? That's game breaking.
---
Thats probably a more realistic option. I know I'll play at least 24 hours right after launch, and at 20 it starts really slowing down. I think on the pserver im testing my route on right now I'm level 23 at 21 hours, I think I can probably get 2 mroe levels in 3 hours but live will more than likely be a different story.
---
That website doe... I didn't know  [https://www.isclassicoutyet.com/](https://www.isclassicoutyet.com/)  was a thing until I read your post.  Cheers!
---
When I was levelling my warlock, grinding in WPL, I had skullflame shield drop for me right around level 55. Used it to buy my dreadsteed mats. I felt so lucky to have that much gold when dinging 60 and to this day when I play my warlock I still ride the dreadsteed. Nothing is cooler. But yeah without that kind of luck 1000g dinging 60 is highly unlikely.
---
Honestly as healer you will be the class that get 5+ friendlist invites per battleground.
---
You will have warriors sucking your dick the second you log on to heal them in BGs.
---
If you work in a schedule, healers are the single best class to enjoy.
---
Instant PuG raid invites, instant guild invites, instant PvP group invites.
---
Exactly
---
90000 zhevras later.. 5 hooves 😭
---
That still leaves 3 intact hooves.
---
At this level we arent exactly blade dancing all over our foes either.
---
Basically the raw her mats (lotus and firebloom) will spike in price. There is money in hording stacks of those herbs, getting crafting tips, and crafting (and selling) oils as needed. Do not go make 800 oils as you will sit on them and they will not sell for more than the price of mats.
---
dwarf is very underrated for pvp
---
Maybe if you somehow dropped some crazy lvl19 bis worlddrop and sold it on AH long after release when people are making twinks. Then maybe it's possible. But in any normal situation, nope.
---
Good point, lets add LFR/LFG and flying mounts too while we at it. Can't wait when more people are playing classic wow in 2025 with these great changes just like more are playing bfa!
---
Wait..
---
Damm man your thoughts got the best of me. You made my mind thank you very much for sharing. We have all been harcore PvPers in the past so this time we'll just take the time to enjoy and have fun wasting time together
---
Or you just make a couple friends who all dont PvP in the perfect spec, so you can overcome your subpar PVP build by communication and skill.
---
A holy priest with a 31/5/15 warrior or combat rogue will do just fine in wPvP.
---
The damage reduction from having 350 more armor would add up to a lot more than having 80 extra health.
---
I have the same pet :)
---
Lol, I saw 'Joe' on there, nice. 
---
For my pally I'm thinking 'Judge' or maybe 'Joe', since Joe is my name lmao
---
I wish I had pictures from Vanilla WoW but I eventually had to ditch my Stock Compaq and didn’t think to save my pictures. :(
---
I was expecting Bone Thugs. My Uncle Charles loved the Barrens. I miss him.
---
I seriously hope you're not assuming that everyone playing classic is going to be some expert minmaxer who knows all the best gear for every level. Classic is going to need casuals to survive longer term. And i definitely know that a casual would jump at the chance to wear this helm. I feel like on my first character I didn't have a helmet till 50.
---
I wasn't coming out saying you were lying, just that with proper 1.12 client rates for mobs and drops, that 70g in 8hrs of grinding at pre level 40, just won't happen.
---
Yah I find a lot of the new hatchbacks are trending towards the same/similar look
---
I hear what you're saying, but in theory then, the game is broken from the start, because more &amp; more gold is introduced into the system from quests / mobs / dungeons over time, which has inherent inflation built in.
---
The need to farm gold AUTOMATICALLY diminishes over time.
---
And I get we need gold sinks to maintain the value of gold and make it meaningful, but at least have these sinks scale up over time (i.e. the same way the Fed manages our monetary system).
---
Repair costs are great as they increase over time with better gear.  This principle is sound.
---
But respec costs are a fixed flat rate which are completely out of whack on server launch.  It hinders game play and isnt good for the game IMO.
---
that's a very good point, have to think about it thanks dude, was thinking about hunter
---
I went on to my old Photobucket account to have a look and there they were. 
---
Only a few and no really really good ones but it was nice to see this at least.
---
*Your Stamina increases by 1.* 
---
*Your Intellect increases by 2.* 
---
*Your Spirit increases by 2.* 
---
Oh, how I missed this.
---
Nice strawman. 
---
The fact that you think LFR/LFG or flying mounts have had any impact on the success of the game shows how much you really know.
---
Walk around IF, see a guy with cool looking helmet. Inspect. It's a lvl 38 blue! /w dude where did you get that?
---
I remember replacing a lot of the gear very quickly with quest items but that Weapon definitely held its value.
---
They should just release Classic now so that I can start playing.
---
Yeah I am thinking I might have to make this my discord picture as well... this is badass.  Any chance you could do a revision with Perdition's Blade or something like that?!
---
Nice. Serious question since I’m looking for a new desk chair. Where did you get yours and how much was it?
---
*Yes.*
---
The main thing is if you can end first week around 40-50 you should be well ahead of the curve. I’m going to be leveling in a duo so it may be a hair slower but a healer warrior combo that pushes ahead of the curve is going to have it easy at 60 even if I’m a week behind hunters and mages.
---
Looks like the blue pvp cloak.
---
It’s been a decade and there’s a lot of variations and options so people should correct me but to jot memories:
---
-	Emperor Run: taking the quickest path to the end in order to kill last boss. Usually done for a few great items on last boss.
---
-	Forge Run: clearing to the forge, usually for MC access, MC attunement or in order to smelt dark iron.
---
-	Prison Run: clearing the jail cells and surrounding bosses. Few unique items and I believe required for some important quests like Onyxia attunement. 
---
-	Bar Room Run: clearing to the bar, basically 1/2 of an emp run. Gives loot and access to dark iron vendor.
---
-	Arena / Ring of Law Run: doing the arena event near prison; I think hunters did this to farm for some item or armor?
---
-	Shadow Forge / Safe / Angerforge: clearing to the safe room with the keys and safes. People don’t do this often because it’s kind of complicated and out of the way. I think there’s a quest for it.
---
Holy shit dude that's incredible! Marry me?
---
I've played a ton of FPS, I like to think that it helps when it comes to making decisions on the fly. Sure there are specific strategies in competitive FPS as well, but it's super agile and not as concrete of a strategy as a raid in an MMO.
---
Practice
---
Agreed, Soupa and Congelatore are my two sit back and listen places on YouTube.
---
The cloth at that level will be like 85 armor or so. So the difference will be 270 armor more for the plate. A fresh 40 will probably have about 2500 armor, 3400 with a shield. The extra 270 armor won't do anything to his mitigation, given that 50% of the damage done in SM by the NPCs is holy and that 270 armor on 3400 will add like 0.5-0.8% mitigation in physical attacks only. Tanks don't die from sustain damage, they die from burst.
---
Nah I understand you. I did. when it releases In the summer  I will have 20g or so when leaving the barrens. All I did was running around in beta with 40 people tagging shit and killing rares
---
trying to get real nostalgic here - even using a vinyl cutter from the early 2000's boiiii
---
Agreed! Pcpartpicker is PERFECT for any beginners to building. I used this and had no prior knowledge about building comps
---
Knowing your class and fully understanding what each ability can do is essential to success. Practice and playing a lot helps with the rest.
---
Shit I know.. I have red vinyl I should definitely at least replace it with one of those.
---
The easiest way is to add the biological and technological distinctiveness of your enemies to your own.
---
Depending on how technically savvy he is, a "Hackintosh" might be an option. You can build your own computer consisting only of parts for which Apple has written drivers (aka Kernels) and can get some serious bang for your buck if you're willing to put in the elbow grease of collecting the right drivers and ensuring your parts are compatible.
---
DPS wearing stockades obviously isn't that optimal but it's not really that bad either. They're plate shoulders and there wasn't many alternatives, so if you don't have the might shoulders, or high level PvP ones, you ain't got many other options, unless you start looking at mail and leather.
---
But yeah a pre MC raiding warrior isn't really gonna have 3 different gear sets for tanking, pve and PvP yet so I wouldn't worry about the stockades haha
---
7 was sunder armour for me. Can't believe I can still remember
---
It all became worth it when that glorious item showed up

Will your child's 2nd name be Cairne or Thrall?
---
Sorry I meant to choose for overall pvp not an actual match up between the two races.
---
Gross
---
Sounds like you need to git gud.
---
He was removed during the AQ patch I thought, since he had no associated quests, Id imagine hed stay removed.
---
I understand this. I've lost interest in all others games while waiting for Classic....
---
It's like : "well... let's play this until Classic..." without any feeling. It prevent me from enjoying others games HELP !
---
I am partial to trolls, so Vol'Jin is a strong contender.
---
No sir. I have 0 chill and refuse to develop chill technology.
---
As for me, I like to immerse myself into the world. For me the best way to do it is to play a human. Like, I can't relate to a mysterious elf who lives for hundreds of years, but I certainly can relate to some bearded dude who knows how to hold a sword.
---
You don't in speed runs. I realise that I'm getting downvoted by a lot of normies here, but drinking ***NEVER*** happens in speed runs.
---
Call him first name Vol, second name Jim and mostly use the 2nd name. Nobody will know the reference!
---
If it is a boy (gender is a surprise), he will speak for the Horde.
---
No changes /s
---
Also make sure you have an incredibly punchable face. It’s practically a requirement.
---
Thanks my dude
---
Yeah, there simply aren't enough keys in easy reach, so I think a better mouse could help me a lot. Good and actionable advice, thanks.
---
Who says castsequence won't be available? Not that it would make much difference since it's not especially usable in Classic.
---
Scripts on the other hand won't be, they've confirmed as much. They don't want scripts playing your character for you.
---
I have been debating on going gnome vs dwarf for months, I have decided to go dwarf. I did some testing and while gnome is great, you can farm FAPs or restorative potions to do the same thing as gnome. There is nothing comparable to stoneform to substitute it's function.  Not to mention the amount of Orc warriors you're going to run into. Being able to easily remove a bleed so you can bandage and restealth in a blind is great. 
---
I've been playing gnome on a private server pvping against a ton of mages and while escape artist is useful, there inevitably will be times where it is just wasted vs a good mage, or the fight could've easily been won without escape artist.  Dwarf turns the tide much more than that, every time you use stoneform the enemy will notice it, and every time you use it it will give you options that were never available as a gnome. Tons of different things you can do to rogues, Warriors, etc with a clean restealth. 
---
When the game has been out for a long time and everyone has accumulated a lot of resources and have restorative/FAPs on constant keybind escape artist will be nowhere near as valuable as stoneform. Think long term.
---
Diablo 2 takes place after WoW, the giraffes have been mutated by the stink that is barrens chat and have come to take their revenge
---
Thats the thing.. Usually we get a release date approx 3months before expansion releases so it would definitely be within reason to suspect it on Tuesday.
---
But Im not gonna allow myself to hope.

I gotta watch this again :)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUsF8weJJWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUsF8weJJWs)
---
When I raided MC as second tank, we only had our main tank go prot. Me and the other warriors went fury, but you still had to farm 400+ defense gear and once they start handing out the crafted fire resist pieces, you better show up. That crap takes alot of guild resources to craft. I got lucky and had a main tank that didn't like wearing tier 1, so I got my full set quick.
---
So gimp yourself in both areas? What if the holy priest doesn't want to play healer in PvP and wants to play Shadow?
---
Depends on a lot of things. You’ll get there but you will also experience what happens when a 40 man raid is 40 individuals instead of one.
---
Early on a lot of people will have only gathering professions so the market will be flooded.  I plan to lvl with mining/skinning.  Keep all the mats from mining, vendor all the skins.  Dropping both professions at 60 and pick up tailoring/engi on my mage.
---
I guess you've never killed 150+ oozes in Wetlands in search of this damned bag you need for a quest. Doing it made me question my whole futile existence.
---
you can 2 man the mobs in winterspring pretty quickly
---
Glad this is 90 percent up voted. Never role played but I love encountering people who are really immersed in their character. I remember way back in the day I gave a bunch of animal products (forgot lol) to some guy who's name implied he was clearly a leatherworking character and he profusely thanked me for the goods and told me he would make quality armor with them it was a pleasant encounter

The reason I am likely rolling Alliance this time around.

Joanna from Joanna's Guides is also making an Alliance walkthrough. You should look him up and do a collab! :)
---
I think the world record is 4 days but thats with little to no sleep.
---
That’s exactly right actually :)
---
Ideally yeah, since totems are only group wide you need many shaman to get the full benefit from totems. In reality, most 40-man raid groups will take what they can get, so it will be a toss up as to whether your raid has more priest or shaman.
---
Yeah if you get lucky you can become rich with world drops because they are so rare and exceptionally good
---
But the average schmuck won't have much. I think I had 30g when I dinged 60 because I'd spent effort to level profs and didn't get a single world drop
---
I have 2 different mice I use for different games. MMOs and RTS games like StarCraft I use the Naga mouse. Shooters I prefer to use a FPS mouse like a [Corsair M65](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16826816063&amp;ignorebbr=1&amp;source=region&amp;nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC&amp;cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC-_-pla-_-Gaming+Mice-_-N82E16826816063&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsLKDhLLI4QIVcxh9Ch1t6AvAEAQYAyABEgK1mPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds) so I can change my DPI and switch between accuracy and twitch shots.

YARE YARE DAZE
---
You make a lot of fair points. But I would argue that without the upgrade, the time investment just wouldn't be worth it for anyone if the updated armor and weapons came out around AQ 40 or right near Naxx.  
---
Yeah there would be people still doing it because they love pvp, but those items outside of the weapons. Wouldn't even be comparable to MC gear. Simply because the hard stats wouldn't outweigh the missing crit/hit %.
---
I think people are freaking out about this a little too much. There are going to be far, far fewer people that hit r14 then I think people expect.
---
I think the best part about vanilla is the power scale. We don't really see that anymore in retail and I think that is part, obviously not all, of what makes vanilla so special. Being able to get r14 gear while other people are in blues/MC epics is extremely fun. And I think the sheer time investment involved warrants the disparity in gear strength.
---
Even with those changes, most of the raid gear people would wear is still going to be blues from dungeons because of hit% that people need to maintain.
---
“More and more gold is introduced in the system”
---
Yes, but you also have to account for the gold being removed from the economy. When you pay 50gold to respec, it is removed entirely from the economy. This fights inflation.
---
I agree, I'm not sure if I'm doing Healer Warrior or Mage Warrior. I'm probably going to try the multiboxing path. I wanted to try a trial 1-10 run, but pservers wont allow multiboxing even just for that. :(.
---
Exactly. 
---
That is the thought behind 50g respecs. 
---
You cough up the gold (like a hardcore player who buys shitloads of consumes) or you gimp yourself and overcome the casualness in other ways.
---
Vanilla WoW is about making concessions in large parts of the game beginning with the class you pick.
---
Want huge control but be squishy? Go rogue.

Want to hulk smash in group PvP but be among the worst classes in 1v1? Go warrior.
---
Want to be the very best in PvP? Haul your ass to the class trainer and pay up.
---
Wrong game though. That's vanilla, not Classic :)
---
I've never had a problem with this quest. On like 20 characters. Pristine tiger whatever in STV through...

I'll be in the same boat.  Honestly, my realistic hope/expectation is to be able to mostly reliably clear Ony and some or all of MC.  And later the 20 mans.  But that's about it.
---
If something like a Naga looks intimidating and/or is out of your price range, I suggest the Logitech G402:
---
 [https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Optical-Hyperion-buttons-910-004067/dp/B00L8VNQ88/ref=sr\_1\_2?keywords=logitech+g402&amp;qid=1554997608&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Optical-Hyperion-buttons-910-004067/dp/B00L8VNQ88/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=logitech+g402&amp;qid=1554997608&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2) 
---
Got one myself and it's fantastic. 2-5 distinct, comfortable buttons depending what you wanna do with them.
---
If you get one, the side two buttons work as expected, but for the others you need to get the Logitech gaming software and map the extra buttons to keyboard keys you wouldn't normally use in WoW - I think I use Y and T or something like that. Then bind those keys to actionbars in WoW, boom, you've got 4 extra ability buttons. 
---
I personally use the side buttons for main attacks, and the top two for things I'd want fairly immediately, then use keyboard keys for the rest. For example on a 29 hunter I have Arcane and Aimed shots on the side depending on what I need to use at the time, then I have Distracting and Concussive Shots on the top two buttons as they come in handy in a pinch when trying to pull a mob off a healer or slow a mob down.
---
&gt;I pay attention, I keep in mind what others are doing, and I follow all the standard advice for the classes I play.
---
This is where you're going wrong if you want to take it to the next level. It's a good place to *start* as a mere aid in learning your class. But if you want to be A or S tier, you need to figure out for yourself all the ins and outs of your class. Learn and remember all of your skills and how they work, when to use them, other intricacies of your class. Practice definitely helps, but you need to know the ins and outs of your class as well as a guide writer - but figuring it out yourself helps you to better understand and actually remember the details, and often you'll figure things out that aren't explicitly written - tips and tricks. Plus, you'll find yourself doing things in your own way instead.
---
After I commented I didn’t think anyone would get it
---
But there's also the other people at work.  If I just suddenly stop showing up for two weeks, then others have to cover my tasks.  Some of what I do is highly specialized, which means if I don't train my coworkers on it, then they wouldn't know how to do it.  I've also got to keep in mind that I am not their supervisor, so I can't tell them what to do, which means I need my supervisor to approve.
---
The longer your vacation, the more time you need to give.  There's a big difference between:
---
* I need to come in late tomorrow (99% of tasks can wait)
---
* I need tomorrow off (most tasks can wait)
---
* Starting tomorrow, I'm going to be gone for a couple of days (now some tasks need to be taken over, but won't put coworkers too far behind)
---
* Starting tomorrow, I'm going to be gone a week (now if my tasks are completed by my coworkers, I might put them behind on what they planned on getting done this week)
---
In America, we try and find a balance between the individual's need to take a vacation, and then the slack that needs to be picked up by everyone else in the office.  We still get our vacation time, we just need to plan ahead if we're going to take a lot of it at once.
---
I've only ever hit level cap in wow for very brief periods,   would it be feasible to get good enough gear from pve dungeons and raids to mercilessly slaughter npcs and have a good gear load out?
---
Ah ok that makes sense, thanks
---
Interesting thanks a lot.
---
yea thats a good point
---
I guess it depends on which version they use. At original release, it didn't have a heal reduction - just the attack power bonus. 
---
In 1.4.0 they made it so that when BF wears off you got an attack power decrease for 45 sec.
---
In 1.9.0 they added the healing reduction and removed the AP debuff.
---
They didn't remove the healing debuff until 3.0.2.
---
No one is arguing this white plate helm is optimal. Just that it will probably be an upgrade for a non zero amount of people. Probably a good amount of people have no idea of the sm helm you're referencing.
---
Ahh the Arcanite Reaper. It was only a blue huh and it cost a shit ton of mats didn't it? I remember a Warrior on my server hit R14 with it. It was pretty much one of the best 2H you could get  before reputation epics like Unstoppable Force and Sulfuras huh.
---
Elvis is still alive
---
It has 355 armor.  U are mistaken.
---
MC, Onyxia, ZG &amp; AQ20 is very easy content and there will be plenty of pugs going every week. 
---
BWL is a lot harder to pug but still doable, you need to wait till most guilds have it on farm status before you see pugs popping up. 
---
AQ40 &amp; Naxx are not really pugable. Too big of a gear check and there’s real tactics involved for most bosses.
---
I've been trying to avoid pservers to keep everything fresh, but one thing in the back of my mind is I'd like to get a saber for my Dwarf Priest. Any estiate on what level he'll be by the time I run him to the NE starting area? I know I won't have issues with trainers because there are NE priests.
---
Also, in my goal to craft early wands, how is the linen grind in the NE area? Haven't been to Darkshore in forever, but I assume there were some humanoids, right?
---
Maybe some first aq40 bosses too
---
Dude, can you please speed up the counter? thxbb!
---
It depends on where you work and what's going on.  Factors that might make it harder to take a vacation on the fly:
---
* Your tasks are highly specialized and it would be difficult to replace you
---
* Your tasks are time-sensitive and preparations need to be made if you're going to stop doing them for a few weeks
---
* You have to coordinate with your coworkers or your scheduler so there's coverage for the days you're missing
---
* There's a major project that your absence would negatively affect
---
If you're working an office job, and you taking time off doesn't affect anything but your contributions to corporate profits, then it's easy to take the time off.  But if you're working at a hospital, and there's a major upgrade to the patient monitors that you manage, dipping out in the middle is not going to fly.
---
The amount of "diehard" fans (read: people in this sub) will always pale in comparison to more casual fans (read: People who will sub immediately after the game comes out). I mean just look at something like /r/devilmaycry. That sub had posts with like.. 20 upvotes tops before dmc5 came out, now it has posts in the hundreds and thousands regularly. 
---
65k is still a fuckload of people for a game that hasn't even come out yet.
---
It's in the genes, son
---
Moon landing is fake!
---
Assuming there's a 50/50 split between EU and US here that's still 30k people on a single server with a 2500 concurrency cap. The queues would be horrible.
---
No need to vanish because cheap shot doesn't break stealth.
---
Blizzard won't give us flying mounts because then we could stop chemtrails.
---
I’ve also found that sometimes using cooldowns a litter earlier has helped. How many times do you go though a dungeon or raid and not use your bigger cds.
---
Without the MCP trick, cat DPS is pretty garbage. With pre-raid BiS gear and some ZG gear, I was barely able to keep ahead of the tanks the couple times I went into MC and I mean barely, I had to powershift my heart out.
---
While the MCP trick exists, its up to you to farm an inordinate amount of them to raid. I dont actually know the numbers, but ive heard theyre good. Thing is farm runs still count, youre never going to clear through MC if everyones afking during trash or bringing their alt with trash gear. Maybe a compromise would be to have a feral druid tank on farm runs, dunno.
---
Lastly, theres a lot of meme spec deniers out there that are trying to spread revisionist history that prejudice against bad specs didnt exist back in retail. It did, moreso I would say than pservers. I didnt play before patch 1.6, but after that, nobody even considered a ret/prot paladins or ele/enh shaman for raids. A Moonkin was very rarely taken because people thought the aura was worth it and very rarely feral druids for the niche situations theyre good for and their utility. 
---
So yes, youll most likely be shunned, the only real way to get into a raid guild as feral or balance is to join the guild at the ground level, or be in the guild for a very long time and switch to feral once you have enough clout.
---
Nice, reminds me a little bit of DA:2, stylistically speaking.
---
Aliens was my favorite movie growing up. I still think it's one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Maybe you just watched shitty movies? 
---
I played the Classic demo like it was crack, and the game is just is good as I remember. You might want to try speaking for yourself in public discourse.
---
Blizzard wants to kill us
---
You only need 5 hooves! That should be a enough indication how rare the drop is
---
My cousin will be playing the healer I don’t have any multi boxing tips to help but I’m pretty sure you could break pserver rules without being caught as long as your not manipulating the economy.
---
Yeah, the size of your group matters, too.  For example, we have 15 people in my department, and while any of them can technically cover for me, they'd need to be brought up to speed on my tasks in order to handle it.  
---
If you're one of 30 checkers at a grocery store it's a lot easier than if there's 3 of you in an IT department.
---
You should reread my posts then, because I'm not saying I'm gonna magically just ask for it and get it.  
---
  Scarab lord is something you earn, when I say the one I join is one that guarantees it is more like a guild that sees the effort and won't just give it to an officer, regardless of time dedicated and help provided to the guild.
---
The vulture quest in SF was pretty damn bad too
---
I mean, I dunno when you started playing- but people have been playing variations on this game for like 15 years now. They've literally put more time into it than most people put into their PhDs.
---
Of course, sharding is not the messiah tech they advertise it to be, sharding or not, the servers will shit themselves on launch.
---
If there's multiple people that want vacation but you need coverage.
---
Should use corehound tooth and perd instead of gutrippers
---
I should good around with suboptimal experimentation more, then? Give myself mini-challenges rather than aim only at an efficient grind?
---
Hi, /u/Olzz123
---
With a mat cost of 10g :)
---
what if their culture is based on freedom and self-determination?
---
I mean... This is only true if you're including the entire world's population.  But if you just mean classic wow players?
---
I never played a tank and I know about herod's helmet.  You definitely wore that post-40
---
Yes also good advice. So many people wait for the perfect time to use CDs and never end up using them at all. It's better to use them more often to get the most benefit. Unless you know there's a moment you'll need to save them for, try to be proactive. But again, CDs often are relatively short for these - 3 mins is relatively short in the context of an entire fight or entire dungeon run.
---
Your version of common sense and mine must differ greatly. 
---
In your mind it is common sense to request hearthstone be added as a mini game within Classic Wow - a game going back to the roots of Wow. Hearthstone was not in existence during Vanilla, yet you feel it is common sense to post your request in a subreddit where  the majority of people want an experience as close as possible to the original game. Not only that, you seem to get upset when they tell you that maybe the retail subreddit would be a better spot for your request.
---
Arcanite Bars were on a 24h cooldown for alchemists, and you needed 20 for the Axe.
---
Old millenials represent
---
Lol what an utter dunce. What are you even doing here. You won’t make it in Classic. Go back to BFA where you belong.
---
Did this guide used to cost money?
---
Our guild was pretty trash and only got a portion into BWL despite raiding since before AQ was released. When the pvp gear change went through we actually started raiding a bit harder since our gear quality jumped through the roof in just a week. The weapons alone were better than anything any of us had and we really wanted to push ourselves.
---
There was no difference if you leveled pet from 10 to 60 or just tames 60lvl pet, no?
---
You won’t get dual spec
---
Could definitely add a Perdition's Blade version, it's a bit of a tougher weapon to do this art style but I'll try it out
---
Human racials are useless in pvp.
---
He's on that island near Theramore.
---
There might be for battlegrounds since that was in vanilla but I think that's fine. Crossrealm in so much worse in PVE and the outside world.
---
You had yourself an ugly boi, very Vanilla, here is my upvote
---
it is
---
Price for a Naga or something similar is only like $75-$125. That isn't a lot of money to invest in a piece of equipment that will last you 5+ years. Never let a piece of equipment intimidate you no matter how many buttons it has. It's a tool that you need to master in order to be a better gamer and it's a lot easier to master this mouse than you think. It takes less than a day of practice to figure it out.
---
If I had to go Alliance I'd likely roll Dwarf since I love beer and sausage.
---
I think 7 days /played is reasonable for duo leveling.
---
Sure we can.. On US servers.
---
I had my class/race locked i, then changed, then totally locked in again. Classic needs to come out so I can make a snap decision at the login screen.
---
How much more insecure can you be. If you have nothing to contribute then shut the fuck up and move on.
---
It completely killed the community and entirely fucked economies.  
---
My entire vanilla experience was centered around my community and what it felt like to be a part of a single server.  
---
And i'm pretty sure I remember plenty of battlegrounds queues with only people from Stonemaul on both sides. Pretty sure cross realm battleground came out a while after.
---
First one was.
---
911 was an inside job!
---
The conclusion I came to was the only reason alliance didn't win 70% of random battlegrounds due to pal is most of them were morons or specced ret, but this didn't help you against premades who had actually competent people. I rolled a mage on alliance on a different server to play with friends and found a competent paladin and the things we could do pre 60 and post 60 were disgusting. A mage and a pal should not be duoing 5 man orange and red elite quests if neither of them are twinked. 
---
The thing that made me fully into the camp of oh my god overpowered they are broken was when it was a premade vs premade in AB where they would just stick one pal on each of the three flags and then have one or occasionally a second death ball bounce between the three spots because in the time it took us to kill the pal to capture the flag his reinforcements would arrive. We literally could not kill a solo healer fast enough with 4 people in the time it took them to arrive. Then I read about stuff like blessing of salvation which as a hardcore raider just made me laugh my head off and made me feel sorry for the shit show that was shamans.
---
I agree with most the comments on here. Pvp helped me improve by quite a bit on a warrior, especially wPvp. Teaches restraint and timing, knowing when to pop the CD, when to throw that 'nade, etc.  But knowing all your spells and how each class can and will react to them is also very helpful. The same could be applied to NPCs, knowing which ones disarm or silence, being able to think ahead a few steps, like chess. Might be over simplifying here, but these are a few things that have worked for me.
---
Yeah you're probably right. I may still do it in a week or two. I stream all my 1-10 runs just so people can see the paths and I just dont want some fool on a pserver getting all butt hurt that im multiboxing even though I'm not doing anything that effects anyone else and start blabbing to the GMs on the server.
---
No I wouldn't focus on being suboptimal. Just remove the shackles of "Guide write said to do this so I'm doing this". Take a step back and think for yourself what makes sense, and begin delving more deeply into understanding each individual skill and how everything works together. Just take it upon yourself to learn and then figuring out what skills to use when and in what way will just be second nature. When you know your class well enough you don't have to go out of your way to think about what to do, it's just instinct. You're breaking it down into smaller bits of "what rotation do I do in each circumstance" - I'm saying you need to look at the whole picture and go from there.
---
Hmm, got me there. I just remember the Raptors so distinctly.
---
There won’t be cross realm in the world, if it’s in the game it will be in BG’s only.
---
Yeah only time will tell but I can tell you from private server experience that whenever there was no honor in the game people just wanted to level, sometimes a rogue or hunter would jump you when you were fighting a mob but that was just to claim territory so they could have the quest mobs. I imagine people will want to get ready for phase 2 asap by leveling to 60 and getting their preraid bis. Either way i'm leveling a druid so with stealth, tracking humanoids and travel form I should be pretty safe \^\^ best of luck to you.
---
I suppose it’s fair point, that it’s still a long-ish travel, even from UC. That’s an extra 3-5 minutes you spend just getting to UC. Still, overall, I think it’s faster to travel from org or even from Gol to UC and then fly over, than going through all of Khaz’modan and Lordaeron first. 
---
One thing to also consider is that there’s no world chat (hopefully) in Classic, unlike most private servers. So groups that are forming will take a lot longer to assemble, and people will more often find the tine to make It over.
---
Yup, tanks were always short. Healers, I remember having a harder time with back in the day, because a lot more of the healing classes wanted to DPS dungeons, so it tended to be more difficult. Additionally, there were some people/tanks that would only run with Priests, because the other healing classes were "worse".
---
As for pserver meta, in early pserver meta, like in 2011, most players would come from retail. Tanks were an endemic problem because most Warriors would constantly state "im fury, I cant tank" ie. I dont know how to play my class. Every Warrior in retail knew that Warriors were the tanks. I had never once seen a Warrior spam chat LF1M Tank for over 30 mins before playing on pservers. Pserver meta did eventually change that attitude until around Nost launch finally quashed it. 
---
However I feel like Classic WoW is going to reverse this, with a huge influx of retail players, I think were likely to see more of the "Im fury, I cant tank" noobs.
---
I think I do this in the course of trying to play efficiently. I'm not religious about guides, only aware of them. 
---
Even though it's not what you meant, I think that trying weird stuff that probably won't work more frequently is a good idea for me.
---
For a shadow priest mp5 wins over spell power if the fight is longer than 2 minutes, it could be similar for shamans.
---
Ideally you want gear with both spell power and mp5 on it.
---
There is a god.
---
Its funny you say this because ive noticed it on so many screenshots that people left auto attack on 1. I feel like Ive never ever done that. Its the first thing to be taken off even now. Am I missing something?
---
Yeah blessings are kinda good with hunters, and Windfury is amazing on hunters. Not a raidleader though, so not my place to really pull judgement!
---
Yeah, it’s about 5% at the higher levels. If two Warriors did 1000 dps, being Human would net an extra 50 dps.
---
Coffer runs, is that what you meant by safe?
---
Yeah makes it easier, from memory crushing blows don't apply to hateful. (Could be wrong)
---
Most likely there will be cross realm BGs. They introduced this at the tail end of Vanilla.
---
&gt; They've literally put more time into it than most people put into their PhDs.
---
For the most part, we're not talking about PhD-quality people, though.
---
Nope, checked it out - 14 steel ignots and Solid grinding stone. 70 silver worth of coal and 4-5 iron nodes.
---
No, I removed it too, as soon as I discovered that right clicking on a mob was starting the auto attack :)
---
But it’s impressive the percentage of people that kept it
---
Nope, they already stated "Never". They're well aware of what it did to the retail game and how the community would react if they went back on their word later.
---
I think the biggest improvement from pvp is the need to have all of your skills keybound and the muscle memory to use them quickly. That helps everything else.
---

There are a fair few actually

I love this quest.It is like the starting  quests of barrens.
---
Put your coka kola and enjoy the farming.2Pac also essential
---
Less servers with higher populations. Just let cross realm not happen Blizzard.  
---
And before we hear from the devs that it's too hard/too expensive to do this is fucking Blizzard not an indie company.
---
Yeah, they'd definitely do that for this and not for any previous WoW expansions.
---
Not only would it be super helpful but it would control a lot of the debate between what's "actually" best in slot
---
Music to my ears, you sound like heaven to me.
---
Took a quick check and looks legit!  Very nice job
---
or bestiality
---
Don’t think he’s relying on rested
---
You honestly couldn't speed level Vanilla. It took me like a month to get 1-60. A lack of quests and just taking forever to level. That and you ran into some areas like Plaguelands + STV and it was gank fest.
---
Meh, I hate them. You absolutely don't need 12 side buttons, the 4 I have alongside keybindings are plenty. If you like them, power to you, I just think they're bloated and you definitely don't "need one to be a better gamer".
---
I think you're seriously over estimating the knowledge and memory of people that are gonna play classic. It was a long time ago. Even IF the majority of players know about it, not everyone is gonna run dungeons until they get bis level 40 gear. In fact it's usually not optimal to run dungeons more than once while leveling.
---
My your a tall one
---
Battlegroups came out with 1.12.
---
&gt;Vanilla WoW is about making concessions in large parts of the game beginning with the class you pick.
---
&gt;Want huge control but be squishy? Go rogue.
---
&gt;Want to hulk smash in group PvP but be among the worst classes in 1v1? Go warrior
---
That's fine, classes having unique strengths and weaknesses is good game design and exactly what lacks from modern WoW. But we are talking about strength of spec vs spec rather than class vs class. 
---
&gt;Want to be the very best in PvP? Haul your ass to the class trainer and pay up.
---
What if you don't want to be the very best, but want to heal in raids and play DPS in PvP? Then tough shit, you don't get to have fun? That's even assuming your class has the option to change spec, which many don't.
---
Everything you just described though applies to companies in Europe as well it's not like it's any difference. Somehow though they survive people taking lengthy vacations on the regular. In America we try to guild people into not using their time off that they have, in Europe it's seen as the companies responsibility to figure out how to make it work, nobody feels bad that their coworkers have to "pick up their slack" when they take off because it's expected they will do the same exact thing for them at a later date.
---
Enchantment. ENCHANTMENT!
---
I would still recommend getting into a raiding guild, but as a casual.
---
Filling 40 spots can be hard, even for established guilds, so having people that can fill those empty spots whenever needed is quite helpful.
---
Also pugs will generally try to invite people from known guilds, rather than some random nobodies.
---
Agreed with the others. Play it safe. I know that there's huge novelty in 'being first' and 'being there when shit goes down' for the first time, but it's almost inevitable that there'll be problems at launch, even if it's a revamped game/client.
---
Personally my old estimate was June 16th, but now I'm 99% sure it's dropping anywhere in August, maybe between Aug 10th and 25th or something. My work also ends on September 1st so I kinda hope it launches late lmao.
---
Anyway, just take the time off somewhere in August. It's almost impossible that it would come out September since that's really Autumn and not Summer 2019.
---
There's always the chance of a further delay, however, so we're out SOL if that happens.
---
Yes! I couldn’t think of the name.
---
Found the American!
---
They've been pretty clear there won't be LFD or CRZ, presumably we will get CRBG's as those actually were in vanilla.
---
It sounds like you should level with two gathering professions, with one being skinning, assuming you'll want to keep the other gathering profession at end-game. Another option is to level as an enchanter, but only to DE stuff and sell to other Enchanters trying to level it.
---
That's okay.  Some people don't even recognize the difference between Austrians and Australians!
---
Cross realm  BG was in before BC but it was small (I think 3) server groups. But yeah I agree that I hope In PVE I only meet people from my server, even after everyone is level capped. I want to be the only person in Loch Modan again.
---
Hillsbrad Murloc heads.
---
Entirely depends on the server's economy, the server I played on had mats selling for more than finished goods so.....
---
They have both great tools. Getting kited as a rogue sucks, not being able to stealth sucks too. Human/NE don't have anything special to offer for PvP Rogues but are more common, even on pservers where apparently everyone is min-maxing their race choice (not true at all).
---
How did it fuck the economy? I don't remember that
---
6 servers, 8 battlegroups total
---
That's the way it should be. With items like these having a niche, even if it's just as a stepping stone, they give meaning to further item progression.
---
It's you feel better when you upgrade from +0 to +10 stat than when you upgrade from +170 to +200 stat. Or why blue items were so cool in vanilla but absolutely nothing special in modern wow.
---
Yep. This leads to situational awareness. You basically get so in tune with the game, that basic rotations and positioning is 2nd nature, so your mind wanders and pays attention to other things. You look beyond what is just in front of you and can see a bad pull a mile a way, and you're ready to try and handle that.
---
Wow, what an ass
---
Hi, /u/mspk7305
---
Ludicrous*
---
"You must plan ahead before using your vacation" and "we don't want you to use your vacation" are two different things.
---
It's not about feeling bad about your coworkers.  It's about planning ahead so they're not in the middle of a major project when you dump more work on them.  Or, if the tasks you're doing are specialized, having enough time to train your coworkers before they're expected to deal with it without you.
---
Skin, then either hetb and mine.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if we get dual spec or at least free respecs at some point once people remove the nostalgia goggles and remember how silly the respec cost was.  It was always stupid in general that some classes can do everything in one spec and others can't.
---
Yep, tough luck.
---
Vanilla is known for what it is.
---
In 2004 it indeed was shitty, because many leveled a class without knowing their melee tree will be not as good in raids as in other parts of the game.
---
Now it is figured out and you can work around that.
---
Want to be shadow? Suck the raid leads dick and become the dedicated shadow weaving dispenser or PuG heal and make an arrangement to roll on DPS gear.
---
A warrior effectively can not DPS in PvP without respeccing to arms. The reason warriors get taken along before their big dick DPS come BWL+ is mortal strike. Without, you are subpar and nobody will bring you to a group.
---
There are only a select few classes who can play PvP nearly as well in their PvE spec as in their PvP spec:  
---
MM hunter
---
Holy paladin
---
Holy priest.
---
The rest have to make concessions or pay up.
---

i have 30 screens from vanilla, but i didnt get to lvl 60. i ended at 44

If you're not hurting for gold usually if you save your mats and put them out in small bits on the AH when the price is high, you'll see a better return on your time invested.  If you need the money quickly for something like pushing content and its not doing you any good sitting around try and find a private buyer who will take it off your hands in bulk for a set price.   Also saving the mats for LvLing another skill is always a great idea, just remember to save up all the mats you need to get you to 300!!!
---
I personally think it'll be out a lot sooner than we think. Like June and there won't be a beta.
---
Just to be safe though you should plan your vacation for August, it's bound to be out by then.
---
Thank you for sharing this.  It really made my morning =)
---
isn't one missing? I thought there was one with an undead too
---
In addition to what everyone else has said so far, one thing that helped me over a "skill plateau" was mouse-over macros.
---
I never thought i needed them or that they would be impractical. But after toying around with a ton of them i wouldn't ever go back. it's so much quicker and helps getting these split second Polymorphs/Counterspells/w.e. off, be it PvP or in a dungeon pull-one-wrong.
---
you make it sound like it's easy to get rank 13, but that's like 3 months of playing 16 hours a day
---
Early game people will have little raw gold and lots of gathering proffs, Its a complete waste of time trying to sell mats then
---
Make a bank alt and stash them away for a while
---
Yeah but it was because we were going into a slaughter. Only the most coordinated Horde groups could go against the Alliance on Shattered Hand. We were so outgeared. I remember trying to kill Jubei from Skyfang was next to impossible. Full raid geared Paladin with Hand of Ragnaros.
---
Found someone who has a boneur for superfluous vowels.
---
Yeah, wait for 29th of april. If we don't have a release date by then, go for the 16th of july.
---
Problem is that respec costs affect certain classes disproportionately
---
I just think they should reduce the max respec cost to make it a bit more forgiving.
---
It's 10 years later, the vanilla crowd simply doesn't have as much disposable time to spend grinding - don't punish players as much for wanting to play different content
---
Many of these more brutal gold sinks won't really detract from vanilla nostalgia
---
That I doe. That I doe indeeeeed.
---
Better keymaps. I'm blown away by how many players don't even bind all of their various skills, particularly the niche skills that come into play in those rare situations you're talking about. You need to have access to your whole toolkit, all the time. That means having sentry totem and a macro to swap between its view and your own. It means having a quick way to use your felhunter to devour magic on yourself. It means having self-bandage bound to a key. Macros, game pads, addons, multi button mice, do whatever you have to do to make your character an extension of yourself. You need to have access to everything without having to click it on the screen and without having to move your fingers off of your movement keys. 
---
And even backpedal has a place in pve and needs a key bind.
---
There are things you can change without detracting from the feel of vanilla
---
Ignoring it like you're some purist when in reality you're probs going to be the first to drop classic doesn't make you enlightened
---
I see you haven't gotten to the cats eye emerald quest.
---
OG 4day 20hr speedrun IIRC was done over the course of something like 11 days, so it's just powering through.
---
I'm part of a speedrun community, and we set rested XP rates to 0 on local builds for testing, and many of us are getting mid 3 day / 4 day runs.
---
Grab mining (more people will be selling herbs) and skinning to level, and just vendor the first levels of mats. 
---
The market will be heavily flooded for the first... 2-3 months? so be willing to either repost up to 2x, save, or vendor the rest of em.
---
Youre talking about casuals in one sentence and then optimal in the other.
---
People want gear, bosses have that gear.  Nevermind that I enjoy running an instance like SM or Maraudon, so any time a group is LF healer, Im in.  The optimal players arent who we're talking about /ever/ because they're almost their own category.  The only fun for them is endgame and the race to it, the rest of us are about the journey not being a race.
---
This is nonsense.  My memory is terrible and I definitely remember as a healer wanting whitemane's chapeau, every warrior wanted herod's shoulder and helm, and even hunters got herod's shoulder in prep for being able to wear mail.
---
This was back before everyone had been playing for a decade, it will still happen like this, im sure of it.
---
What was that late 20s cloth helmet that everyone had? Azure cloth helmet or something
---
To be honest, I think they're Divine. The second coming of Christ is taking some time off to play Classic before the rapture.
---
You don't stand a chance, kid.
---
Would be like westfall, darkshire, and redridge all combined
---
Maybe horde, or pve server. I don't think I would try it without a guild group where you know they are going to stick around to farm it  quickly. It's only going to give you like a 2% increase in damage and probably won't be worth going back for unless you get it on your first run for quests.
---
Nice find!
---
Humar's the same model, but black in color :  [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/family.php?id=cat](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/family.php?id=cat)
---
Same stats?
---
NE better for daggers (by a microscopic amount) due to higher base agility. 
---
Humans make obviously better sword rogues, but that isn't the only thing in the game or the only thing that matters.
---
Experience like a lot of people are saying. You should at least know of all your abilities, even if they dont come to mind right away. When things go wrong, dont think about thhe fact that youre going to die, i think about what CAN be done. Then you can start thinking about what you can do to help. Once youve been in that situation a few times your reflexes become much faster.
---
With niche abilities, keybinds arent a big deal, just keep them handy on your action bars, but try to keep them in the same place at least so you know where to click. I never understood the stigma against backpeddling, its very helpful for some maneouvers.
---
I can't wait to farm Arcanite Reaper mats again, oh baby
---
I wish I kept my old screenshots.
---
There is a massive difference between a quick leveling guide and a speed running guide. Yes speed runs will be vastly faster but will not be doable by the normal player.
---
If his guide was how to set a world record pace in vanilla then ya the time would be an issue , but that is never claimed and OP is just discussing a solid leveling guide. Getting to 40 in that /played is more then respectable and far faster then the average player could do
---
The top dps rogue according to legacyplayers is a night elf
---
Weird flex, but ok
---
Bonereaver's Edge is a huge upgrade so basically as soon as you're farming MC that's always on the table (and makes 2H Fury DPS even more viable, which is very fun imo)
---
If TSM addon gets made for classic then profit in general crafting will be minimal.
---
It sucks until 40, then its awesome. A combo of death coil and SL.  The best bet is to just dot and chain fear someone
---
Well we have had vanilla servers for years without gear score so I think we gucci
---
You're best bet is still to join a guild. With 40 mans, it's impractical to expect the same 40 people every raid time, so guilds will want 50-60 active raiders. Having floaing players like you is a benefit. In return for notalways being there, you'll also be less angry if you are there, but there's no space.
---
Humar's got 1.3 attack speed, Echeyakee got 2.0.
---
/1 who wud win chuck noris or bruce lee
---
No probs just switch into your spirit set between pulls
---
I swear, why do people never look anythng up. You kill the RED oozes inside the tomb, not the rest. I have never had the bag drop after more than 10 kills.
---
Out of curiosity. what does that look like? I like the idea of disc/shadow, but it just doesn't seem that good. No silence, no darkness, no vamp embrace, and no shadow form, all the power of the shadow tree seems to be deep, where the earlier talents are really buffing the later talents. And shadow doesn't get that much benefit out of Force of Will since your only spell that crits is Mind Blast which is a long Cooldown and you have no crit bonus talents.
---
Meanwhile holy can boost both your offense and defensive abilities, has a strong talent like holy nova, and buffs your smite and holy fire which get more from Force of Will than shadow does.
---
Unless you're talking disc/shadow as a raid spec, which I can kinda see given it both brings PI to buff the DPS and Shadow weaving to buff the warlocks. So Disc/shadow could be seen as a full-support raid spec that doesn't get any healing bonuses.

Khadgar's Essays on Dimensional Convergence

I think a answer lays with an analogy: 
---
[Peek at this](https://www.logitechg.com/content/dam/gaming/en/products/g600/g600-feature-2.png.imgw.1888.1888.jpeg) and ask a similar question: how do people use all of those buttons? 
---
I have that mouse and at first I thought I'd never use most of the buttons. When I [bound the buttons to everyday functions](https://i.imgur.com/OmbxVpO.png) I got used to it and now my brain just sends my thumb to the right place without me thinking about it. 
---
It's kind of similar in gaming. Practice and frequently consider every potential ability. 
---
For example: when I played mage I'd challenge myself with weird kiting scenarios where there would be casters in the enemy group. I'd die and then consider how I could have succeeded. What if I Counterspell the casters to gather them in? What if I sheep them on the pull? What if I Pyroblast them on the pull and try to blow them up? Maybe there are TWO casters...Pyroblast #1 and sheep #2 immediately? Could I just kite through their damage, throwing up Dampen Magic on myself and fire/frost wards + mana shields? 
---
By exposing yourself to weird situations you get your brain thinking about all the tools at your disposal. If all you ever do is normal stuff you'll be a normal player. And of course there are the savants who are just superhuman but I think that any regular person can achieve a highly adaptable state.
---
&gt;You might want to try speaking for yourself in public discourse.
---
If you tried to read my posts actually, you would notice I did.
---
Cheers.

Lower them
---
Then lower them more
---
Isn't it crazy that we're in 2019 and there still isn't a good Alliance Guide? Hahaha
---
Yup, like how you are tasked with proving you killed 10 bears.
---
How hard can it be to find some kind of instact body part that will prove the creature you killed is in fact a bear??
---
&gt;Nobody is going to wear this thing
---
Is what you stated. Which is factually incorrect, I'm just pointing this out. People will absolutely wear this because it is an upgrade from what they will have.
---
Not gonna dissect your other points even though I think you're mostly wrong. Just sticking to my main, original point.
---
What does " expect the private server crowd tp fail " even mean?
---
Not a weird flex but ok
---
You just gotta be big brain
---
wow, I honestly had not considered this before. what a good post, I enjoyed reading this post and am happy I got to experience it. it was truly informative and gave me allot to think about. hopefully you were all able to read the post before it was removed
---
it depends on what you want.
---
Pure dps? Go for human
---
PvP? Hard to say. I'd say Nelf is better. They are the hardest to detect out of any rogues due to shadowmeld also adding a bonus to sneak. Dodge bonus should also not be overlooked as well as nature resistance.
---
Just go for Night Elf. The damage bonus given by sword and mace specilization is minute. Also, you're going to stick out among all the human rogues who min max. Enjoy the game.
---
Now its vanilla servers with a modified Legion API. So who knows

This is a BiS list for PvE. Arms is not an optimal PvE spec at all. Why would you make a best in slot list for a garbage spec?

---
wont make it into the game.
---
No plate gear without stats is ever worth wearing over using mail with stamina and some other stats on it.
---
Cyclone isn't used to help Warriors get to their target. Roots does that (which is in Vanilla - and actually has a longer duration in Vanilla than TBC). Cyclone is strictly for additional offensive pressure.
---
As of now, which can change, NE zone is around 14. 
---
My goal as a mage is to craft a wand as well seeing life is hell without one and I doubt they’ll be on the AH day one. It takes about 60-70 linen to level tailoring and make enough green robes to then disenchant them to get to level 10 enchanting to them make your wand. The whole process took me 7-10mins in IF and is probably what I will be doing on day one (if I can get the linen). 
---
Most of the mobs you will kill in Auberdine are beasts so the linen isn’t fantastic. However, if you’re willing to wait until Auberdine for a wand, there is one as a quest reward.
---
No, you're thinking of Zygor's Guide, which is still being updated and no longer has the pre-Cataclysm quest guides.
---
This is the kind of thing that Blizzard would actually do.
---
Then again I was depressed when Daft Punk did not have an Alive 2017... so I have been burned by hype before.
---
Makes sense, vanilla provides a few avenues to level trade skills. You can use more resources, which takes more time, in order to build useful items that you can use, sell, or trade to your friends. OR you can power through ranks, investing fewer resources but getting no usable items in return. It's actually a pretty good design that leaves a lot of freedom up to the player.
---
Shoot for 175 hours if you’re following a guide and being diligent about sticking to leveling. You can get much lower than that if you’re really good  at leveling and play certain classes but if you’re new to it expect to be getting a bit over 200 hours if you’re casually leveling but still sticking to a guid but wasting time occasionally
---
Blizzard should use this immage to give us a release date :)
---
By fire be purged !
---
Amen to that, was your char name Draethar? I played an Orc Hunter named Wesly on SH in early to mid Vanilla, we were so outnumbered and outgeared we'd get smashed relentlessly in the SS/TM war, back when the honor system first released. I remember at one point standing in ghost form with all the other Horde in Tarren Mill, watching the Alliance jump around on our corpses, and I said fuck this and went back to Felwood for PVP.     
---
When the battlegrounds came out it was a blessing, being able to at least fight Alliance in equal numbers, and I like to argue that we Horde had better skill by then because we didn't have to rely on gear.  :D
---
Later when
---
I am not worthy haha. I was on his site the other week and did indeed take note he was starting an Alliance one. I look forward to comparing!
---
Soooooooo...what's the pets name?
---
&gt; He tells you to do several quests in random zones without bothering to tell you that you gotta pick up the starting part from a capital city.
---
This is actually because of breadcrumb quests being required in some pserver chains but in original vanilla you could either pick it up or just walk there and take the next part anyway.
---
An example of it working properly would be in "The Absent Minded Prospector" being started by "Trouble in Darkshore" in Darnassus.
---
An example of it not working would be "Mage-tastic Gizmonitor" requiring "Speak with Bink" when in retail it didn't. 
---
Best way to tell is to take a look at an [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20070212141858/http://wow.allakhazam.com:80/db/quest.html?wquest=1879) for the quest and peep the comments/notes.
---
Nope. Anything starting with /run won't work, not in combat at least.
---
lol sure
---
You dont have to be an expert minmaxer to understand that wearing a helmet with no stats is a bad idea.
---
Yes. Practice spells and behavior you know are useful in oh shit situation. I’ve been a hunter since vanilla, and a few years ago I decided to be one of those hunters than can save a group from wiping. So I went out and practiced on normal mobs: trap one, tank a 2nd with my pet while I kite the 3rd. 
---
I did this over and over until it all those moves felt natural and I didn’t have to think so much. 
---
And make sure you key bind those spells/abilities so you can access them in a hurry. I don’t recommend ctrl+shift+5+clinch your sphincter.
---
Lol mace rogue ? In Pve? Why?
---
Except it wont. Your average mail helm at that level still got 200 armor or so while also often giving 10+ stam and some other stat like strength or agi.
---
The additional armor is never going to add up to raw stats for leveling or tanking at level 40. Stamina is king at those levels for tanking.
---
Not enough thunderfury links
---
If it's written by the guy that speedruns, (I am assuming you are because he uses hunter) he uses a ton of rested xp and logged out time so I wouldn't be surprised if he logs out for those 30 min to save 20 min on his time played. Although it is on a private server so it could just be using all the incorrect stuff they have coded in.
---
Just because it may not be optimal, doesn't mean that it doesn't have a BiS list...
---
Think there is a quest in tarren mill that gives a cowl as a reward
---
Tbh, I didn't know the ring wasn't unique and about the paladin shoulders you are correct! I'll update both.
---
Its built around July 16 based on some Blizzard hints, and maybe Blizzard is just messing with people but I can also see them doing something like that.
---
It’s definitely not because they don’t want to give a release date and then realize the games not ready so they must push the date back.
---
The Barrens is very boring. I like Westfall and Redridge Mountains way more.
---
WHY DOES EVERYONE LEAVE OUT GNOME

I dont even have to ask. PTO on my dev team is auto-approved, literally. Don't even let my manager know directly. #devLife
---
Cuz not all information was know at the start of the game? I for one played melee as a hunter for many levels because i didnt realize i could buy more arrows
---
Pets get bigger the higher loyalty it has (https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Loyalty), not by what level is it. If you tame a level 60 beast it would still be tiny for a few days and get bigger as you fed / fought with it.
---
Easter eggs placed by Blizzard, on purpose.
---
&gt;Is what you stated. Which is factually incorrect, I'm just pointing this out. People will absolutely wear this because it is an upgrade from what they will have.
---
Just because you some dogbrain might be dumb enough to wear it doesnt make the point false.
---
Anyone that care to even look the basics of wow stats will not be wearing this helm.
---
I NEED this!!!
---
Why don't you count down to the actual release date, July 16?

Strat undead also sometimes known as Baron run, esp when tier 0.5 comes out.
---
Your memes are bad and you should feel bad
---
You CC the person that put roots and slows to focus another target - nothing to prevent the warrior from getting to the enemy. Or even if a target is actually putting slows/roots you can cyclone them up until warrior gets to melee range.
---
Hi, /u/grandpasweatshirt
---
Anticipate how things can go wrong and have an idea in mind of how to react if they do. What do you do if someone aggroes that roamer? What do you do if the tank dies? Expect and plan for the worst, and it's more likely that you'll be able to react and adapt should it occur.
---
If you want to master your class's kit, pick an ability you hardly use and spend a day or two trying to maximize your effective use of it. After you've done this with your entire spellbook, consider doing the same thing with consumables and clickable items. You have to step out of your comfortable rotation and be deliberate about expanding your repertoire.
---
It's not a conspiracy. Blizzard planted easter eggs on purpose and they line up so wildly perfectly it's not a coincidence. It's July 16.
---
They need to surprise launch the servers....not for server stabilization but just because im ready to play.
---
You value iron ore at less than 3.5s each? You can get at least 2s per ore by turning it into a bar and vendoring it. It is worth way more than that to players.
---
You are a nerd lmao. Calm down bud some people will wear this because they have a shitty helm previously. Not every alliance noob is gonna go run SM prior to getting a mount.
---
I’m with you 100%!
---
The date is July 16.
---
Source: Blizzard
---
A stack of iron bars is like 1.5 gold on the server I'm currently playing.
---
It would be smart not to aim for the release... Server issues. Crashes, bugs... Etc.
---
Or they could combo them very close to one another just to be like, Look see we told you investors people would be resubbing for 8.2 lolol
---
Can you tell us what was the /played for both mages when they were at level 25? Im curious bcuz I recently reached 25 as mage with 26 hours played
---
Just be a real man and quit priorities first
---
Yea but its just ridiculous to expect a BiS list for every possible spec someone might dream up. Should we make a list for smite priest too? Melee hunter? Tank shaman?
---
Alot of it comes down to focus.  You have to play the game second to second.  Trust your judgement, live or die from it.
---
Own your failures, thank the team for your success.   This is key.   Everyone makes mistakes at times, learn from it. 
---
Lastly I'd say accountability.   If you are giving 110%, you can realistically make up for someone only giving 80%.   But you can't have people around you that top out at 80%.
---
This release theory is complete hokum. Please stop posting this level of nonsense.
---
Can confirm.  Shamans can last during the boss fights, but will be oom while the rest are off killing trash mobs. This results in OK boss DPS but really bad overall DPS.
---
What if Blizzard meant southern hemisphere when they said "classic summer?"
---
All of the speed runs I have seen have used rested xp, it's pretty easy to shave hours off your run when you take a few days off to double your leveling speed. During launch that 4 hour difference will probably swing in the other direction without changing their path to account for that.
---
I think you speak for all of us in this sub. I nominate you for chairman.
---
I have a mouse with 9 extra buttons but I don’t know how to program them to use spells. Any quick tips to get me started?
---
I think a lot of it boils down to knowing what that mob or what that class can do at the time, as well as your abilities in full.  Practice is important too! If you know what abilities and limitations the class or mob has you can exploit it.  It wouldn’t do much good wasting mana/energy/rage/combo points if someone is just gonna clear it with a bubble.   Having a good view of your health is important too. Knowing how much a mob hits you for,  what their attack time is like, how long it takes you to heal or cc them.
---
False, Dwarf owns Human 1v1. Opener doesn't matter when you can trinket KS and Stoneform their blind and remove bleeds/poisons. Human can only trinket one or the other. Also Human vs Orc RvR is determined by RNG.

I like having a dedicated autoattack button because it's easier than right-clicking everything.
---
i think i remember having like 317 weapon skill at one point rocking my edgemasters + racial
---
I know because I am and used to be one of those people they are playing 10+ hours a day so the amount of practice they get in is absurd. Everything becomes second nature and you do things without thinking of them which frees up your mind and reaction time to see ahead and somehow magically coordinate things without actually coordinating them. This is especially true for premades in battlegrounds who will smash into the enemy team and have half the enemy team crowd controlled without any overlapping such as the same person getting sheeped twice never happening. 
---
That was then now imagine the people who have done this without a break for the past 10+ years.
---
Classic isn't even out yet and has more active online viewers than many popular games that are already out. 
---
I don't understand, how big does this need to be to be considered a success? There are 1700 browsing the gta online sub right now. There are 800 browsing the RUST sub. Both of those games have a healthy community and rust broke peak numbers on steam a month or two back.. Yet classic has 1800 browsing at this very moment...
---
This was an awesome read
---
Good advice
---
From past experience, there will be two situations.
---
1.   You are one of the first to have these mats.   You can make a pretty penny.   Maybe enough to buy a mount if you are early enough.
---
2.  You'll make money from tips.
---
You're wrong mate, it's going to be released 3rd week of june, I got a work trip then so it's all but guaranteed
---
&gt;Just because you some dogbrain might be dumb enough to wear it doesnt make the point false 
---
A lot of people understand that you hit level 60 quicker by not running dungeons multiple times and keeping your gear perfectly up to b.i.s. each level. It's mostly quickest to only run dungeons once if you have quests for it, and not worry about your gear while leveling if it slows you down.
---
Just because you're too much of a dog brain to understand that doesn't make it stupid to wear a white plate helm.
---
In modern WoW quest gear has a chance to upgrade to blue/purple from green/blue, so not even purples have much meaning anymore.
---
You mean Redridge.
---
my first born child is now 3 months old so this summer will be epic , im trying to pay as much attention to the kid so at summer i can focus on classic while babymama takes care of the baby :D
---
I might be as excited as you. I rebuilt my computer room; built a new desk, got a new screen, new headphones, shelves in the walls. 
---
And I have two young kids and a wife. But the thing is, even with kids you still have a few hours to kill after they fall asleep. 
---
So juggling family and classic wow wont be a problem unless you want to play hardcore. But as a casual player I will get plenty of play time at night. And so will you. 
---
Just make sure you focus on the kid while it’s awake. Classic wow will be around longer than your child’s first year.

There’s a macro named “randy” wonder what it does
---
Do you know what smooths damage spikes? Armor.  
---
A level 30 mail helm has about 20 armor on it.
---
Can we all calm down on the release date? Blizzard will most likely give us a date 1-2 months out from release, they use this timeline for most of their titles.
---
They have said numerous times (even in the recent blue posts) that the game will still release in Summer 2019.
---
Just. Be. Patient.

Its going to be a surprise launch.

Inventor's Focal Sword is not preraid BIS for Paladin; the healing mace from BRD is better.

Back on my server there was a 60 rogue who rode the zeppelins and boats pretty much 24/7 and wore only white armor pieces like this, sometimes with some grays. I never knew what his deal was, but I never failed to wave at him.
---
Well, I get your concern, but according to some sources(Ythisens) Classic was already being planned and possibly even being developed already 1 year before we got the first announcement of it. Yes theyre basically designing a new game, but not really. No creative design on producing of content is needed - just alot of tech problems to be solved. Nothing too major that should really push the release farther than what they had planned.
---
THE DB is great for a stormcloak RP.
---
Thats why you simply dont start a life until AFTER classic launch mr.
---
Does it look badass? I bet it looks badass. I'm a sucker for armor that looks like actual real world practical gear. One of the reasons I'm psyched for classic.
---
I do not know why more people do not realize the giant issue they are thinking of unleashing on us. The "Hardcore" group will dictate the flow of the game entirely. Anyone who is not a hardcore player will get rekt. World PvP is a lot of fun if it is done right, but the system the way it is is ENCOURAGING zerging of people.  
---
THIS IS A HUGE CHANGE from the way vanilla was. Sure there were some dbags camping, but it was not the ONLY WAY to min max. With them potentially doing this, they are forcing everyone to become exactly that. setup large raids of people and kill anyone. Everyone gets the same honor, so zerging will become the meta.

That is horrific. I enjoy pvp that is SEMI even and back and forth, not lawnmowers mowing people over. That is what they are encouraging with this release of the pvp gear. I feel like most people I know will want to roll PVE as we have lives and such and cannot possibly be part of that hardcore rush.  
---
Yeah yeah (Get gud, you shouldn't be on a pvp server, yada yada yada what all you other dbags will say), but actual world pvp can be more then this. The way the system worked in vanilla though, they are encouraging greifing straight up. They are encouraging people to zerg kill everyone as fast and often as possible to get the min max gear.  
---
\*Vomit\*
---
The idea there is just appalling.
---
Doesn't he always ask to be sent back anyway?
---
Counterpoint:
---
They release at same time so that true neckbeard classicists can get ahead of the tourists.
---
Strongly disagree life will be there after classic. Classic wow is a once in a lifetime event. Have fun in phase 2 being lvl 40 &gt;D
---
Quests and move on
---
Some items are worth it, but generally you won't get much XP from dungeons
---
You think Deathbone is better than Kromkrush Chesplate? Why?
---
Complete it once or maybe twice (if it’s for a really sick gear piece) for the quest rewards and experience and then move on. 
---
The amount of experience the quests give it great, but the dungeon itself offers very little, and unless you’re farming prebis gear, it will all be replaced within a few levels anyway.
---
&gt;seemingly overwhelming concern about the PvP
---
It's not.
---
People here bitch just about anything, best we can do is downvote them and ignore them
---
Dragon Age Origins for me but I was playing Skyrim all winter.
---
Get ready for a classic winter!
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
It is valuable, but eventually, you'll have a guildie that will craft it for you.   You in turn help them with an instance or quest.   Vanilla life yo!
---
You’re basically as smart as Lloyd in Dumb &amp; Dumber.
---
What if it's already released and we just don't know it!?
---
Been so long since I’ve seen the glory of a multi-disc installation process.
---
I agree, let those that farmed that hard have their fun. It won't be that long of a stretch anyways. We need to pick our battles on not complain about every decision blizz makes.
---
Inflation in wow is a good catchup mechanic for new players, they just get slightly more railroaded into collecting things that the established players buy.
---
You counting mount and skills in the 50g?
---
Complete for quests and gear 
---
Then move on
---
Blizzard over time: "Release in Summer 2019" "Still releasing in Summer" "Still releasing in Summer." "Summer release has not changed."
---
This Community: "OMG, totally worried they aren't going to do a Summer release."
---
 RemindMe!  2 Months
---
I've noticed some people use "DD" for damage dealer instead of the appropriate "dps" when filling groups. Still throws me for a second every time I see it.
---
May also be worth listing commonly reserved pieces like dal
---
i think most people having an issue with this have absolutely no idea how slowly the ranking goes

So I guess, the super casual will be a regular customer.   Find out your servers peak times.   Seriously, just look up the raiding schedules of the top guilds of your servers.  I'd say either post short auctions, near the end time of the raid, or about 6 hrs before the next raid.
---
Or just do a long auction, ending about 30 mins or less before the raid times.
---
Other than that, put stuff up for sale on weekends.
---
sm/ruin warlock can too. doesnt weaken your argument though.
---
Yeah gnome is viable for pvp with escape artist, but dwarf still tops it in most scenarios.
---
BiS list for arms : No weapon because mortal strike knocks off important debuffs. Seriously, if a mage is in AQ and gets a fat ignite, and you knock it off with a mortal strike, you are going to make all of the mages mad. They work hard for that ignite proc and you are just too obsessed with being a special snowflake to use an optimal spec so you just fcked all of their dps.
---
As a casual father of two I’m going for that sweet, sweet pve server. No rogue will ruin my precious leveling time.
---
This is exactly how I feel. If you're going to PvP 14+ hours a day for 3 month then yeah, you've earned your competitive advantage.
---
Can you tell me why? I enjoy his videos. They’re well edited, good topics, he has a clear and good voice. Why does this sub have such hatred towards him?
---
I'm still a clickyboi
---
TBC arenas.    
---
Yes I clicked for 3 years.
---
Back. To. Back. Champs.
---
I didn't start in the first place :)
---
I stopped clicking when I learned that I can turn around with A and D keys
---
Not sure why people downvoted you.
---
That would actually be sort of funny. Speed the time up by 5x and just add the necessary amount of days to it so it still ends the same time. That way you can ignore the days column and just smile in blissful ignorance as the seconds counter flies by at lightning speed.
---
What's the point of a post-Cataclysm guide? Everything leads neatly into each other now, just show up in a zone and go where it says on the map
---
\*indeeeeid
---
Im pretty sure its a normal healer that goes up to the shadow talent for the % and makes sure the debuff is kept up.
---
CC is incredibly strong. 
---
Even if you're the best healer in the world, if the CC or Tank mess-up then your mana will run out. CC can stop that from happening while also DPSing. I remember "saving" a group from wiping with my Mage simply because I put a Nova down in the right place when add pulled, and Poly'd one and CS'd the other, and kited the remaining. Tank was dead and another person died because they didn't watch what was happening. It's all about awareness. 
---
Playing a Tank I've thought "oh we can save this!" but then I watch the CC basically throw their hands in the air (known as instantly AoEing) and then die. PvP helps a lot. When you treat every mob like a player you tend to not get hit anymore when you don't want to - gone are the times of pulling aggro and having that mob waddle up and 2 shot your group mates. They should expect to pull aggro because they should be aware of how much threat they've generated and then know how to quickly respond when the inevitable occurs.
---
my 14th bday
---
You have given me cause to re-think joining a pvp server. Wisdom of the father = priceless.
---
By that logic Retail is only played by about 100 people due to that being the number of regular active forum users.
---
He’s too mainstream? Thats a weirdly hipster take on such a niche market like classic wow youtubers. I’ve enjoyed a lot of his videos, I really dont get why people like to jump on the hate bandwagon.
---
He was saying disc though, not holy. I can see holyweaver, I can see disc/holy, but disc/shadow just seems bad in practice, so I wonder what I'm missing.
---
why did u bought a DELL instead of a real gaming pc tho
---
Roleplaying probably. Sounds fun tho.
---
Are you seriously getting downvoted for telling your opinion of content creators you like? Holy shit this sub is something else.
---
I couldnt kite in wrath of the lich king in naxrammas as a hunter - don't remember the boss name but it was some zombies spawning.
---
We wiped like 5 times because of me only, and my lack of skillls in kiting. It was almost impossible to kite properly by clicking.
---
It was so frustrating and humiliating that i started learning to keybind next day after that raid.
---
I like him too.
---
I like your dedication to this belief!
---
You just play your bank or go do the chores you needed to do and come back in 30 mins...
---
If it is winter for you then sorry but you won't get Classic in your country. They have already told us many times that Classic release is restricted to summer areas only. :/
---
By one guy in the company, not whole blizzard
---
&gt;  Idgaf, they literally can't fire me, I'm too important. 
---
Famous last words.
---
What do you mean level 14? I'm jut asking how many leves I'll gain from exploration running all the way over there. I just want to make sure the early quests are still green so I can max darnassus rep.
---
As for the wand, my plan is some variation of the ideas I presented in this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bbmjtv/discussion\_on\_holy\_priest\_profession/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bbmjtv/discussion_on_holy_priest_profession/)
---
I'll likely have an alt with LW and tailoring, so all the beasts in darkshore, etc., will be great for the greater magic wand, but I also want to make sure I cna get some linen quick as you suggest to get the lesser wand first. What is the quest wand in Auberdine? What level can you get it and what is its DPS?
---
Craft and vendor. :D
---
1. MT gets geared out first to help push faster progression/kills.
---
2. OT's 1-3 are next in line for all tanking gear to be divided up evenly in most cases; however, seniority can prevail here.
---
3. Fury Warriors are forced to take leftover tanking gear so they can be called on when needed. Most do not want it because they know they will be the one fury called on to tank in a pinch and they want to dps in 99% of scenarios.
---
As MT, it is normally understood you are a raid leader and with this comes many additional responsibilities and prepping, so yes more time must be invested here and your guild expects it.
---
As OT, you are more in the shadows but extremely important to the success of all progression. Typically, there will be max 3 dedicated OT's for every raid. You will eventually learn to become a hybrid, meaning there will be many situations where you will be doing raid dps directly (fury prot spec) or indirectly (Nightfall +15% spell dmg) by equipping your "dps" set for that fight. 
---
Bear in mind, you will never have priority on dps gear over fury warriors but if your guild does not have high turnover on your fury, guess who is next on the list for plate dps gear? You, so sit tight and be ready to pick up some fun items in time.
---
Farming mats for consumables and gathering arcanite bars will take a lot of time, but that's dependant on how hardcore your guild is and what they expect from you. Thunderfury in your aim? 100 arcanite bars is not cheap so start prepping.
---
Bold of you to assume I stopped.
---
Oh agreed.
---
But you forgot gnome so REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Have enough situational awareness to tell when it is going to shit and act accordingly with the tools available. This will come easily in time if you try to improve as you play. 
---
Some people don't want to improve. People with thousands of hours on league of legends who never get past silver rank.
---
If you want to level fast and efficiently it may help to do 1 to 20 and some professions and take some notes on a pserver first. If you plan to just bask and enjoy the ride then wait.
---
Let's just say they'd be shooting themselves in the foot by letting me go.
---
Nobody will do MC to PVP if the PVP rewards for rank 10+ are going to be 2 tiers above MC.... THAT is the innate issue the are building in. MC will be pointless. Yeah anyone can do it. but there is RNG and 40 People... + a once a week timer.  
---
Honestly, if you have very limited change of getting the gear you need once a week out of 40 people, OR you have the ability to camp people trying to level(There will be a TON of them) with the guarantee of getting comparable or BETTER gear, what would you do?  
---
Now ask yourself, what would everyone else do? Because I am under the impression that Better gear = better player. Typically the gear quality gives you some distinct advantages in most cases.... so most people will simply endure the grind of mindlessly murdering people over and over and just get their pvp gear, which is guaranteed! Guaranteed is something that basically takes MC and makes it irrelevant. Yes yes, content and experience. But PVP gear released with better stat lines makes MC about pointless.  
---
They will be forcing everyone who wants to be competitive in pve or just be a better player to PVP.  
---
I personally always want to be competitive when I play games. NO not world first, but I want to be considered good and I believe most players are similar. Well when a Warlock or Mage with rank 10 pvp gear is &gt; a fully geared MC mage... what is the point of the pve content?? You get way better stuff for pvp.  
---
This is a massive change from vanilla. They are just releasing the updated gear WAY earlier then they should. They need to release all BGs when they release this gear or pvp servers are going to be a nightmare for anything but hardcore players, which inevitably will get the server pop to drop, which we all know the snowball affect.
---
Well goodday mate, lets throw another shrimp on the barbie!
---
Practice and good, sensible keybinds.
---
If your "random" stuff as a warlock for instance, like enslave demon, is on a weird keybind, and your enslaving a specific demon would result in a prevention of a wipe, the practice of having that keybind memorized, as well as having it be accessible in the case of time sensitive use cases is critical for the kind of play you're discussing.
---
what? lvl 30 mail helm will have 80-150 armor, what are you smoking? 20 armor sounds at or below cloth levels. And at those gear levels the lvl 40 pally/warrior will have 2500+ armor on his profile in all mail gear. Stop trying to pretend yall can see things others can't, that is a vendor trash helm unless you are wearing complete garbage.
---
a spin off with a diferent timeline diferent history
---
Just do the quests, you'll likely get some gear but it's generally not worth farming them for gear that you'll replace soon anyways.
---
This is kind of how I learned the most. My first ZG run as a healer i was under level 40 going in, I was able to pick up some quests for it so I thought it was the perfect time to jump in (even though the mobs at the entrance were red for me, but the group took me). This made every game mechanic significantly more important. Positioning to keep from pulling half the dungeon, using my fear in ways that wouldn't pull the packs and mobs around what we pulled, optimal use of mana to keep from going OOM, interrupting the healers when possible.
---
Now, not sure this would work for tanks and I am pretty sure it wouldn't work for DPS, but it definitely worked for me as a healer.
---
Finally I would read every ability you get and, decide for yourself whether it is usable or not and even if you don't think you will use it, throw it on an action bar somewhere. I guarantee you will find a point in time where you will use it.
---
And the advantage is mostly short lived. Plus the content is so old and the mechanics are relatively easy, even for 40 people. Nearly everyone will get the chance to experience all forms of content.
---
My girlfriend has EVERYTHING keybound. Would roast the living fuck out of me everytime I'd play. One day she just got on my pc and keybound a bunch of stuff and made me play like that. 
---
Made me a much better player. Still use the same key-bindings she set for me.
---
Because it will be "niche". (Still larger than many other MMOs.)
---
Nothing wrong with that.
---
The jargon file for WoW.
---
Great thing!
---
I surely hope not! I don’t want to tide this train again. I only upgraded to TBC back in the day because there was no one else to raid and BG’s were empty.
---
I did enjoy TBC, but do not want to relieve being forced to basically start over my game. Holy hell, if this is a real possibility, then I’m not even gonna play classic.
---
Winter 2017 release
---
The biggest advantage will be in PvP but personally I like the idea that you can achieve an advantage through time and effort. Modern retail wow and it’s “everyone should be equal” mentality is one of the reasons the game doesn’t interest me anymore.
---
So pressing 1 after you left click a mob is easier than just right clicking a mob and not pressing 1?
---
Probably Gluth. I had issues with that boss even with keybinds (very shitty computer).
---
I personally do quests only and if I want a break from the grind I’ll do some instances in between
---
I remember I had concussive shot on 8
---
I have a gaming PC at my house (Desktop), this Dell is for being to able game wherever my feet may take me.
---
I've looked at a lot of competitors out there, Eluktronics, Lenovo, HP, MSI, and their gaming lineups and there were a few things I was not willing to settle on:
---
1) Bezels, bezels are so thick on most gaming laptops it drives me nuts and I wanted something with a thin/clean bezel look. The New G5 that Dell came out with fits this mold for me since I did not want to dish out $2500 for a Surface Book 2 or some other high-end gaming laptop that weighs 7 lbs and will melt the skin off my legs or burn a hole to China.
---
2) Already touched on this but, price. For $1,049.99 + warranties and customer I have a laptop that is protected from accidental damage and has Dell support. 
---
&gt;8th Generation Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H Processor (6-Core, 9MB Cache, up to 4.1GHz w/ Turbo Boost)
---
&gt;NVIDIA(R) GeForce(R) GTX 1050Ti with 4GB GDDR5 graphics memory
---
&gt;256GB M.2 PCIe NVMe Solid State Drive (Boot) + 1TB 5400 rpm 2.5" SATA Hard Drive (Storage)
---
More than enough to handle WoW and raiding as well.
---
3) Battery Life, G5 is a better built Inspiron 15 7000 series that actually had decent battery life and didn't always need to be plugged in.
---
Not sure what you mean by real gaming laptop, this is enough for my needs. Plus it will be used for newborn vids and side business stuff. 
---
Love that tax write-off!
---
I never stopped. Grab my mouse and double-click.
---
I remember doing this as a Fury warrior decked out in MC and BWL gear with healer and DPS similarly geared. Yeah you can do it but you'll always be much higher gear quality than the content you'll be doing.
---
Why is it the last? You deleted him?
---
Btw, what do you feel about shaman in vanilla? I'm thinking of playing the class! =)
---
My pleasure :)
---
I played in a pve server in Vanilla, so my only MC memories are related to knocking people off the Lumber Mill. I'm looking forward to MCing some cool mobs and to knocking people off cliffs around the world :)
---
Nothing has ever been more true
---
I’m gonna did laughing when I see those first few single copper ores getting posted for 1-2G
---
Gear.  
---
Is the main factor that prevent the initial raids. 
---
Ppl going to there first raid unprepared in bad gear and failing because of it.  
---
If to few tanks got to low FR some mc will be freaking hard.  If to few healers got gear to have mana Regen you will die when they go oom.   
---
DM and ZG really buffs you gear.  
---
But yes you can do initial MC in pretty bad gear.  You just have to get 39 other ppl to do the right thing.
---
Optimization is great, but I'm getting a bear.
---
hooves and raptor heads /puke
---
Frost and Madseason forsure !
---
Kargoz is way too hype/fake for my taste though.
---
What the?!
---
I think that the value of Iron ore is about 10-15s for a piece
---
Depends on the mouse. The Naga works because the 1-12 buttons on the thumb as literally just your number keys 1-0 - + keys so you can just put the spell on the hotbar that cooresponds to the button you want to use. If your mouse has "Mouse button 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc" then you will need to go into the keybindings in your game and assign those Mouse Buttons to your abilities.
---
Every blue post ever is made by a guy in the company.
---
i nutted reading that
---
nobody has named the strongest racial gnomes have, I am still waiting to see.
---
Get that carrot on a stick n then ride into the sunset
---
PvP - wasn't instant though, at first I only bound 1-6
---
Eventually rebound strafe to A &amp; D and found I loved how Shift and Ctrl modifiers made using certain abilities feel. Like for some reason I just love 'R' as a Blink or Charge button, or '~' for Trinket. My muscle memory is such that even when I play a non Undead character I still sometimes press Shift-C for WotF. And to this day I fondly recall how satisfying a Hammer of Justice feels when using Shift-R to cast it.
---
I like to do each one 1-2 times. At least once but probably no more than 2. Odd times I'll do 3 if it's SM or ZF.
---
They have quests and items. But also XP. Helps for any "deadzone" in leveling to never occur, since you have that extra nudge from the dungeon XP. Helps meet people too, which is the best part.
---
Too much emotion there. A true warlock doesn't give a damn about his minions. When my Voidwalker gets low on health, I don't have it perform "Consume Shadows" to heal itself, that takes 10 seconds and doesn't result in full health. I simply summon a replacement which is takes the same time (unless I have Fel Domination and perhaps Master Summoner) and results in full health with full mana for the VW.
---
&gt; people are spouting their stupid opinions
---
And of course your opinion is the one that actualy matters...
---
There is a big difference between a well thought out "official /approved" blue post with the purpose of giving information and a random gnome name from a vanilla video.
---
Maybe it was at some point a guideline for a classic release, but since it was not published, nobody knows if its still the case, which makes it speculation for me.
---
lvl 40 mount and skills maybe
---
It's just ballpark, it's different for everyone
---
LOL I never requested anything
---
Yeah, right
---
Yikes. I remember taking 8 days /played to get to 60 on my first character.
---
&gt;Is that a waste of time?
---
Well yes, but actually no. 
---
It's a waste of time if you only care about getting to 60 as fast as you can. It's not a waste of time if you are having fun, because that is the real goal of games, having fun.
---
I know. But it's not confirmed, so, it's wrong info.
---
Both 
---
As a healer in vanilla I was constantly nagged to come and heal. 
---
My friends list was filled with ppl who played there class well and “missing a tank” was never a problem for me.  (I had an add on that allowed me to add a comment to my friends list)
---
And after proving your self to a lot of other Guilds you sometimes got whispers wanna come help us in MC etc.  (often I was raid locked so I couldn’t but it shows how it was).  
---
5+ good healers and +5 good 5man tanks was all you needed on your list to make it easy to find a dungeon run.  
---
For raiding well if you got invited it was because temporary shortage.
---
Jump on a zepp
---
You can take the Zeppelin to Orgrimmar right away.
---
I actually never really clicked to cast in wow.  I learned from playing Diablo, Starcraft, and Warcraft that keybinds were the easier route.  This was especially important in the precursor games to DotA on battle.net. I also learned the importance of a good gaming mouse, game pad, and addons.
---
didnt tockaray make a video about some girl in war ensemble and post it on DT forums
---
LOL it also is NOT common sense to request that hearthstone be added because that is actually more opinion based.
---
You will farm Scarlet Monastery as many times as it takes to get that sweet Helm and Shoulders and you will like it!
---
If my math checks out then classic released in 50 days confirmed
---
Mage uses Frost Nova + Blink -&gt; cast Roots on Mage. Literally the exact same result. This is a Vanilla discussion, so I'm not going to go into Cyclone diminishing returns and why you would want to save your DR for offensive pressure instead of using it for catch up - none of that applies in Vanilla.
---
No problem. Hope this isn't weird but is your guild looking for more? Also, are you planning on going Alliance or Horde?
---
Trying to find a good guild to join before Classic launches
---
Playing a rogue twink back before AB came out.
---
Just from PvP'ing alot it just kinda forced me to pick up better player control habits.
---
Next blue post: “In order to ensure a classic launch that meets all of our player’s expectations, and to avoid releasing a sub-par product, the release of World of Warcraft: Classic has been moved to early 2020.”
---
lol was gonna post the same thing
---
Oh I agree with that. I'm just being pedantic.
---
I literally just started wondering about what it would be like to have it in the game and thought it was a cool enough idea to post on the /classic and /wow forums. It does not mean I violated any rules. It's all open to discussion. That is the point.
---
My interpretation is:
---
If you are a human warrior, you are a citizen of Stormwind, living in Elwynn. Maybe you were a farmer, a carpenter, but you decided to take up arms against the many menaces troubling the region. The Alliance enlists you to do your first work and first training at the Northshire Abbey.
---
If you are a mage, you will have some sort of innate magical ability, so you can use magic, but you are a beginner, and need to study long and hard - as you adventure and level, and receive training by the many mage trainers.
---
Razer naga comes with software where you can customize each button to whatever you want, even automated scripts.
---
I know all of you will hate me for this, but I'd be okay if the pushed it back till winter. A summer release is going to interfere with my fishing. But hey, fish in the am and grind in the pm if I have to lol
---
I'm the say way. :) Until they give us actual date I don't get my hopes up. But it's nice to have dreams. ;)
---
Yea zepp :3 but taurens run dont they?
---
the same WarEnsemble with Troxed?
---
I might be misinformed but which items are we talking about? Ive only really looked at a few classes but the updated blue pvp set isn't that great. Id say its somewhere between t1 and t2. But not anywhere near aq/naxx. Hell even the warlord gear overall does less damage than t2 in exchange for a lot more health. And I highly doubt anyone will get past rank 10 before bgs release.
---
lol right, i mean its right around the corner so i just want it Like now! i just kinda wanna get through the low levels fast enough. like grind from 1- 35ish since thats when you feel most powerl and the instances are alot more fun IMO so once i get to that point i won't mind sitting back and taking a break from the Classic.
---
Also red Defias mask, this is when I knew I was a rogue
---
I picked up classic midway through year 12 in 05/06. Killed my ATAR equivalent. Still got into uni on a mid 74. C’s get degrees and raids before grades. Also, parties come and go but epics are soulbound. 
---
Worth it.
---
It's a fairly nice run, very safe for a level 1 as well.
---
Rune of the guard captain is horde only.
---
Since they specifically mentioned the T0.5 quests being delayed I'm assuming the blue class quests also won't be in the game until a later phase so no devilsaur eye.
---
If they leave those quests in that would be great, but who knows? I guess we'll find out.
---
unconfirmed is not the same as wrong
---
🤔
---
I never fully clicked. As a D2 vet, the idea of keybinds was already in my brain, but I did click less and less over the years. At first in was 1-5 hot keyed, but eventually my whole keyboard and mouse buttons were added in.
---
It realy never occured to me early on that there were people repeadedly clicking on frostbolt in MC, haha.
---
The more I research leveling on a fresh PVP server the more I'm convinced 5/5 corruption is required. I was trying to see if I could get the improved void a few levels sooner with 2/5 corruption until after Improved voidwalker but I think I will need the mobility of instant corruption as soon as possible. I also think I will be crafting a Lesser Magic Wand as soon as possible to keep my mana in reserve for when I'm ganked. There is a great post here about how to quickly get the wand on a fresh server. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a7kv6d/tip_for_getting_your_lesser_magic_wand_quickly/
---
I have also found the Warlock Classic discord PVP FAQ discord channel that explains strategies to PVP against each class. I think its small things like talent point progression and wands that will make things easier. I'm also considering a drain tanking build with fel concentration to prevent interrupts and then respecing to a soul link build at level 45 for the extra health. I heard people don't want to deal with a Soul Link lock in world pvp.

I have played with Skarm for a couple years. I never raided with salad bakers but our naxx runs usually ran 3-4 hours. We had a boomkin, semi shadow priest for weaving only. No shadow form, just keep up debuff and heal, bear Druid and prot pally. All things are viable if you itemize properly and have a team that cares just as much about the people as they do completing the raid. Just show up with proper materials and a positive attitude and it isn’t an issue.

inb4 every narcissist comes to tell you how good they are.
---
shit too late
---
This is how I feel about life. How did I get here? Why am I doing all these odd jobs? Go down to the LC and buy dad pepperoni and smokes for the *experience* and a new cape?
---
All I can for sure answer is Undead, as I think lore wise you "wake up" in the crypt you were buried in.
---
My main was an Undead Warrior named Boneslayer from &lt;Beyond Remorse&gt; and I had an alt Troll Rogue named Backstabbin.
---
Know your spell, learn how/when to use them, make it an habit.
---
WoW is an old game and it's not uncommon to see people still play the same class 15 years later.
---
PVP is the best way to practice "oh shit" situations and use almost if not all your spells.
---
That helmet is miles better than a lvl 30 leather cap that the typical casual player would have at that point. You guys assuming everyone has minmaxed perfect gear for each level seem insufferable
---
OI! U got a loicense for that computa?
---
After downloading my first addon. Then double checking that add on was allowed. Then I went crazy.  
---
Then I switched to clicking again with decurse and healbot. But hey it’s grid clicking not Button clicking.
---
Whose question are you answering?
---
Or are you just incapable of determining the distinction between “do” and “why”?
---
We should discuss immigration to Europe. /takescover
---
Played a hunter in vanilla, had to master jump shots and dead zone kiting which you really can’t do as a clicker
---
It’s actually really nice on hunters. Right clicking only initiates melee auto attack it seems.
---
Hi, /u/Weaponsonline
---
I found that lowbie campers usually stick to specific areas , like a hunting ground of sort.
---
The area radius can be determined simply by observing when the specific quest mobs end, as it is almost always an area where lowbies need to kill mobs for a quest.
---
If you've identified that specific camper's area you can effectively leave by just rezzing/running, stealth is significantly slower than running, even if the rogue uses sprint he will still have to run a while to catch u so long as you aren't stopping, even if you die you would've put significant distance from the central gank area that the 2nd time you rezz (even further away) they'd have to specifically follow you and leave the area in order to get you, which is not likely so long as there's more "prey" running around in the gank area.
---
Basically what this means is, you only ever need to die once to a high level ganker so long as you know which area the camper is sitting on , but the tradeoff is you need to come to terms with the fact that you are effectively skipping the quest(s) in that area and going off to quest/grind elsewhere ( a lot of people are reluctant in not completing quests even at the cost of them dying repeatedly, which is a huge waste of time).
---
I forget, can lvl 1 alts disenchant high level gear?
---
The quests involving the hinterlands troll cities, ZF and ST are pretty broad. Repeatedly takes you across the world.
---
Only new players and noobs would. "Real" stats &gt; just armor.
---
To reserve days off work.
---
Flaming shield for flaming horse, fair trade.
---
Roots are dispellable and only roots isn't enough while but both Roots and Cyclone are decent.
---
Wait... Blizzard never said which summer they will release Classic on!
---
We've been bamboozled!!!
---
Different companies have different requirements for booking leave. Some just require a set amount of notice. So until we get a date there will still be people eager to get it in time to get those requests in.
---
Of course it is. Pople just took the date outta their asses.
---
Okay so I'm saying that it comes out September 1st. I'm not wrong.
---
This was always my biggest turn off to healing. I love the idea of being a healer, but having to be able to see everyone in the raid and be able to apply heals to them individually kinda ruins it for me. I have a lot of respect for those who loved healing back in the day.
---
It was a joke the whole time. In a month or so they'll be like: April fools!
---
lol.... a lvl 30 mail helm is minmaxxed? There is probably a quest reward, several blacksmithing helms. If you want the extra .7% dmg mitigation you do you. Just don't do dungeons with any magic or poison dmg.
---
Found the Warlock! :D
---
You can, but you should try out Tirisfal! It's a really beautiful zone
---
If I remember correctly it was Pressztwice.
---
Nothing untoward, I believe I was looking to trade/sell the toon when I took this.
---
Because he is the definition of idiot without knowledge who sucks the life out of this game by commercialising what little is there.
---
&gt; And why do all of these player characters end up doing odd-jobs for various settlements around the world instead of serving as a Stormwind Guard, or studying at wherever the mages study at, or fighting the undead in Lordaeron as a priest or paladin? 
---
They are just regular people. Think of a D&amp;D party. Your character is a traveling adventurer. If you read the quest text from Thrall during the Onyxia Key Quest Chain, he says as much. Tells you you are weak and not ready for what's coming, etc. This is where the PC's start transitioning from random adventurers to known heroes of their respective factions. By the time you get to whichever expansion gave you the base building stuff you are fighting directly under your faction leaders as a known hero of your faction/the world.
---
There's also basically no raid in Classic that needs people to be in the top 10% of numbers to beat. If you know your rotations, can do the basic mechanics that WoW raids encompass, and are geared well, it's gonna be fine.
---
Don't worry about me I'm fine, just stop mixxing your preferences with reality. We are talking about what is essentially mathematics. If you leveled in 6 days you understand that doing so with rez sickness would be impossible, wearing the wrong gear would slow it down. Being ganked 20 times over the course of 1-60 would add hours. Having a power outage or a doctors appointment would too. But when it comes to a spell that says "push me for free mana" you get all foggy and obfuscate away from numbers and calculations and say the game is purely subjective. Coca-Cola or Pepsi?
---
Guy was before his time and half ass vids made people millionaires a few years later. This is to this day still some of the best gamer related content to ever come out.
---
Loved the later stuff he did when he was the out of it old man with the MOBA crowd
---
You don't get blacksmithing experience that way though.
---
Just armour &gt; nothing at all.
---
Am I the only one that enjoyed setting up the death camp around the Rush points and just ruining the rushers lives? People would drop out so fast. We would just continue to rack up kills as they tried to rush. I disliked the pvp turning int pve.
---
Biggest issue of leveling in a group is getting everyone in the group online at the same time. But in terms of speed of leveling, solo or duo is best. [Look here for a quick Duo Leveling Guide.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YCBd1VZVb4) A warlock/druid duo is extremely nice, especially when the druid is going for their sealion form. Having the warlock cast Unending Breath on the druid makes the quests in that chain MUCH easier.
---
Some numbers, a table or two and a couple of loose thoughts.
---
I'll be 5boxing a team of war, mage, hunter, druid and shaman - hope to be able to nolife a bit for launch. Might be messy though with lots of competition, my thought is to go to lvl5-7 area right away and grind/kill quest(gathering quests sucks for boxers)  to 10. Do class quests/durotar/barrens to 14 and then go to RFC, and WC at 17. 
---
Did some research:
---
1. XP in group  
---
Group of 2: \*0.5  
---
Group of 3: \*0.388  
---
Group of 4: \*0.325  
---
Group of 5: \*0.28
---
2. As a point of reference, an average level 20 quest rewards around 1200XP. An average level 20 elite in a party of 5 rewards around 81XP.  
---
XP = (Char Level \* 5) + 45 (elite) \* 2 = 290  
---
PartyXP = 290 / 5 \* (party modifier) \* 1.4 = 81.2 rounded down to 81.  
---
To achieve the same amount of XP as the average quest takes 15 kills in an equal level dungeon. A conservative 90 seconds per pack of 3 equates to 7.5 minutes of dungeon grinding to equal one quest. There's no way you can consistently complete a quest every 7.5 minutes. There's also no travel time in dungeons and the return only gets better as you level up and gain better mana efficiency, gear and AE skills so can start pulling more packs at once.
---

This is a good explanation for a lot of skill based games. Reading that made me realize why I like Rocket League so much because I've mastered the basics more or less but there's always weird situations where I need to improvise or decide how exactly to play the ball. Good explanation.
---
Mages have owls that show up to invite them
---
Yup.   And youll get damn near a full level up through exploration.
---
whatever dude.  bye Felicia
---
I guess its mostly a hunter thing but as a priest i could never wrap my head around being a clicker, already from the start i learned that clicking stuff took way longer than a keybind and that meant ppl could die.
---
But if you have nothing at all at lvl 40 you have been doing something terribly wrong.
---
Maybe but hes still not as scary as a warrior who doesnt have it.
---
i thought about this aswell, but my question is, BRE in 1.12 stats ? Thats going to be insane….
---
Some people tab target.
---
Isn‘t it kind of explained in the warcraft chronicles? 
---
The players are folks who decided to fight against the threats on azeroth. Be it the quillboar in mulgore, or the gnoll in elwynn. And on the way we accept being a sort of headhunter or an aid for simpler tasks, just to get some food and energy, i guess.
---
back in vanilla i watched Grim Total Annihilation, saw he wasnt clicking and actually had keybinds. Changed to keybinds 10 minutes later and still using just about the same binds as I did 13 years ago.
---
At higher levels, the dungeons break up the grind and help you gear out. If you have a competent group, the dungeons are fun. Can be hard to get a  group for multiple attempts though, esp with no group-finder.
---
Id bet most people dinged 60 in a BRD, LBRS or Strat...
---
&gt; You guys assuming everyone has minmaxed perfect gear for each level seem insufferable
---
It really is fucking wild.
---
They think every piece of gear in the game needs to be better than whatever came before it. No wonder itemization in retail is so boring.
---
No I get what you mean and I think that we have confused the wires of the conversation. I meant it from a competing in the grand scheme of things stand point. I'm never going to speed run instances, but I do like the idea of the fury tank being viable and us smashing bosses, if an elemental or SP or even a boomkin etc can keep up with the DPS of a mage for that shorter boss fight for example then that's all I'm interested in! 
---
The reason I ask is because I will have to play around my work, and that means that there will be alot of other casual people who I regularly play with. Closing off my options to take an elemental sham etc is just going to hinder me in the long run! On long fights I can see it being an issue taking these specs but if we managed to get these quick speedy kills going, then all is good!
---
There was a moment when I was tanking on my warrior and I realized that no matter how fast I clicked, I couldn't hit sunder and heroic strike at the same time. I had to use keybinds to be efficient.
---
Id do the first 5 levels in Deathknell then bounce to Durotar and start over there.
---
Your spell damage gear definetly does no buff imp or succubus. I'm pretty sure emberstorm does not effect the imp's fireball as well. Utter lack of pet scalability is one of vanilla's many incompletenesses that was fixed in TBC.
---
I never started
---
Yes just make sure orcs and trolls share the same class you choose as u dead or you wont have a class trainer
---
It's 4days 20 hours play time , so independent on sleep.
---
Most importantly though your room has to be an absolute dump and roaches are already starting to nest in your shoes.
---
as a mage who never played beyond vanilla, i will not accept requests for "tables".
---
You are correct, you are not wrong. You are just unconfirmed.
---
Blizzard will add RP-PVP servers. They are just waiting to announce them so they can say "See, we listen to you guys" and make a big deal out of something they were going to do anyway.
---
The problem with dungeons is prep time. You've got to put together a group and then actually GET there. And once you're done, you have to get back to questing.
---
They're also risky, in that you might not complete the dungeon, or the people you're in group with might not want to help with the quest you're on.
---
That said, I plan on doing dungeons as often as possible when levelling, because for me playing in a group is the whole point of classic. I want to make connections with people who will be on my server.
---
The decision was simple for me since I mainly just wanted to pvp in wow and am very competitive by nature. As soon as I discovered a more efficient input method I switched. But it wasn’t reluctance like most people I feel like, it was a burden of knowledge of knowing how to effectively make keybinds.  Also I was new to the game. As soon as I sat down and made time to learn all my keybinds I never thought about clicking again. I was probably in my lvl 30s in vanilla wow when I switched. Wanted to make sure I was building a foundation of a great player :)
---
BLOODY BONE NECKLACE ! \*ptsd flashes\*
---
By far the worst quest ever, shittiest drop rate of any quest and highest concentration of players = corpse running for hours.
---
I &lt;3 Batista
---
I guess since Private Servers have a boner for PI right now, it's simply just a PI disc with shadowweaving flash healing with a bit less efficient heals, allowing the SW debuff to be on the target.
---
Basically, instead of holy/shadow, you know have your meta PI/shadow priest. Hell do I know how efficient it is, but you know how people are.
---
if they go with loot sharing, or the option to trade loot. PUG raids will be an "in house" thing. Where guilds alts will be playing together. And they wont invite random people that will/can trade or sell items at the end of the raid.  
---
i have been holding pug raids on more than 1 pserver now, and if the looting is changed, i feel like im beeing forced to only invite members i trust already. No pug raid leader wants their raiders to sell/trade items between themselfs.
---
I love the undead starting zone! One of my favorites! I hate most of the Hord later zones so usually stuck with alliance
---
Enjoy the game with your friends, though designing a plan where you all only play with each other will likely be frustrating based on differing schedules. Vanilla leveling is nimble enough where you can all play with each other while several levels apart.

Uncle?
---
Private servers totally allow multiboxing.  My brother and I have been doing tons of it to test various things.
---
[Look at these videos for some guides on selecting a race for a specified class.](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheNayKu/videos)
---
But also remember something moonsti videos says towards the end of each video:
---
"In the end, your race won't make a huge difference in your performance. ... In the end, you should just play whichever race you fucking like best."
---
Aion Abyss fort PvP raids. Hard to PvP heal as a clicker lol.
---
I actually think it will release before July. The retail version is in a bit of a lull right now and with the next patch being delayed until the summer, I can’t see them releasing classic and the new patch content within the same time frame but I could just be in denial.
---
Duos seem to be the meta
---
I thought he wasn't removed until end of BC, since they Added him in Wotlk
---
hones twork me, me !
---
Satyr Horns never forget
---
True story.
---
I have genocided entire civilizations worth of zhevras, 3 hooves
---
I guess my plan of going mining/herbalism is way more common than I thought. Those poor gathering nodes will get practically molested.
---
How feasible would holding on to most or all your mats for later be? I mean like putting all your materials in your bank weeks or even months after launch to use or sell? My guess is it would all come down to the amount of people doing the same thing.
---
Try to farm  \[Flask of Distilled Wisdom\] - +2000 mana and \[Nighfin Soup\] - +8 MP5  before raids, should help alot.
---
Just quit your job.
---
That era right before TBC when the epic armor and weapons opened up with honor points was very memorable for me. I saved up the points and was ready to spend them as soon as it all unlocked. the jump my shaman had on gear was amazing.
---
I didn't like taking my eyes away from whatever I was doing, since most of the time I was looking at the action bar, missing out on cool moments, environments, and just the action in general.
---
Sorry I misspoke on the difference. It was a little over 4 hours difference to 25.
---
Mage 1- 22H 31M
---
Mage 2- 18H 15M
---
Joana’s 420 run - 16H 42M
---
Yeah. You can DE anything BOE. No level limitation or anything.
---
I see you are a gentleman of taste as well.
---
Instances are only comparably fast when you have all the quests for them, have a group that's ready to go immediately, and don't wipe at all.
---
I'd go for each 0-2 times at most until roughly Mara, after that there's prebis to consider.
---
Not a new concept by any means.  We were doing this in 2004.  Usually pick up MS and get the mitigation talents in prot.   As long as you arent lazy raid tanking threat isn't an issue
---
The current alliance/horde heroes are fighting a war amongst each other. You are the common citizen rising up to defend your factions territory after it became a mess in their absence.
---
I presume you are familiar with your classes abilities, but you have trained up just one to prove yourself worthy of the quest giver's trust. Additional abilities can only come when you have mastered what you already know.
---
Would suggest doing at least one 60 to get a higher Gold per minute.
---
Tanks, largely because the few raid tanks get funnelled gear and never need to run 5-mans again. And then the tank-capable DPS players have to play a different role with a worse spec.
---
"The cloth at that level will be like 85 armor or so"
---
Even most lvl 60 cloth head don't have this much armor. And at this level 270 armor should be closer to a 3% more which is actually 6% damage reduction if the tank had 50% dr.
---
Sure a mail with good stats would be better but if its a cloth or a leather i would pick the plate helm.
---
Why do anything at all?
---
So you are telling me *logs into retail* that gear of purple color used to be rare? *transmutes gear into something better* Wow, that is, like, so old school game design *does nothing but afkraid*
---
Looking forward to the "WTF Blizz - I booked holiday to play classic and now you're saying it's going to be delayed a week? FU Blizz" etc etc
---
It's not a race.  It's not a contest.  Do what you want.  Have fun.
---
I never clicked but I did keyboard turn for a lot of Vanilla.
---
I dueled a level 50-55ish rogue (I was a 60 rogue) who had a bit of a reputation of being a really good ganker. The level difference gave me the opening and I think I got him to around 30% in the initial stunlock. I had a few combo points, so I threw on cold blood and went in for the kill. On the way I typed out something cocky like "goodbye". I didn't touch him once for the rest of the fight and he slowly bled me dry. It was very embarrassing. 
---
I never keyboard turned again. The rogue that embarrassed me became a good friend and we spent a lot of time PvPing together out in the world. We both faded away from the game around the same time, haven't spoken to him since then, about 12 years ago.
---
You can just macro autoattack into your abilities so whenever you use anything really it starts.
---
If you find level 39 pvp fun then go for it! Video games are for fun, so do what you enjoy
---
See I’d rather grind inside in the AC while it’s hella hot outside and all the non-wow peasants are grinding irl. 
---
How cold does it get in AUS anyway?
---
I plan on doing many alts so I wont be selling mats for the first few months and will be leveling those alts to 45 (or is it 35?) when I get past 225 skill in each.
---
Hunter rogue and warrs all have a use for it.
---
I am not sitting in your lap again, ever
---
Im plannin 29 altwink for 29 bracket and extra profs, no need for golds once everything sorted tbh when you dont reach the 60 tho.
---
As of now my guide hits Auberdine around level 14-15. You’re looking for the xp you’ll get from running from Loch Modan to Auberdine? Peanuts seeing you don’t quest on that run. You’ll probably die to a croc though. And no, you won’t be too high to grind your rep.
---
What’s soulstone juking?
---
You have to be level 5, but my point was more about DE'ing all the soulbound quest rewards as you level and then selling the mats. You can then drop enchanting at any point for whatever profession you want endgame. Skinning is a no-brainier, but herbalism and mining can slow you down while leveling, so enchanting is an alternative with no time cost.
---
A Scandinavian server sounds more wholesome
---
Do what you want... Why do you want people to convince you to get to do something you don't want to do???
---
Why do all level when 39 level do trick?
---
You’ll hate it
---
Prebis for healing is cloth with healing power yes. I'm not saying you should pick that up :D 
---
There's a fair few of high stam int mail pieces and some spellpower you can get.
---
beta's unlikely by this point too, expect horrible quality launch
---
What I did was visit http://classicdb.ch
---
Edit your search according to the bracket you want to look at obviously, so you would enter item levels between 30-39 or 40-49 and from here just visually look at the gear, maybe write it down for a quick glance as you compare it to other gear. Look up each individual item slot (head, shoulder, back, chest, etc) and make the set you feel comfortable with according to your class, spec, and playstyle.
---
Yes, it takes time. But it's more informational on what are your options per item slot and imo more fun.
---
A level 60 you could make a lot of money to fund your 39
---
You say you fumble with your skill bar regularly; meaning you click some of your spells? First step would be to bind all your spells and make a habit of never clicking. Not your mount, not eat/drink, potions, bandages etc. No matter how minuscule it may seem; bind everything. 
---
Some will argue there aren't enough keys within reach to bind everything, which is just straight up wrong. You don't need a fancy gaming mouse with 20 buttons either. Simple four button mouse with a mouse wheel will suffice. Sufficient use of shift, control and alt modifiers along with your regular keys will do the job. Unbind S.   
---
I also recommend moving your spells without a cooldown to the right action bars and hiding them. This will force you to remember the binds, also allowing you to have clear view of your important cooldown abilties. If you find this to be a struggle, slowly add abilities to the hidden bar as you get used to them, and over time you'll get there. Added bonus of having a cleaner UI, and in turn giving you more overview of whatever situation you're in.
---
Definitely engage more in PvP. It'll teach you how to counter x class, when to use/not to use certain abilities, and not to mention you'll get a good grasp of your class' limits which often translates into PvE as well. Your reactions will start to improve, your movement will slowly feel more fluid-like and you'll be on your way to a new and improved you.
---
Good luck.
---
And you also don't have to worry about the repair cost after each raid :)
---
I wonder what percentage of the player base is going to be casual in hours played, but hardcore in knowledge. 
---
Back in the day, I could sit around the auction house refreshing, because I knew the general value of hundreds of items. I could spot certain undervalued posts a mile away, like maybe Shadowfang Dagger going for 10 gold when I knew people would pay 200+ for it (made-up numbers for the sake of argument) for twinks, buy it out, and re-post it. Maybe someone found a green recipe for alchemy or cooking that, unbeknownst to them, had 20x the value to high level players than they realized. How many people vendored these things, not knowing what they had, and they never made it to the auction house?   : /
---
At any rate, I have a feeling that the players joining Classic WoW won't be as clueless this time around, by and large.
---
I didn’t consider this and now I’m depressed
---
Warlocks didn’t need pet scaling in vanilla. They were one of the strongest classes.
---
I click all the time. That's my primary means of movement/rotation/camera positioning in the game.
---
"Hmmm," said a small voice in his ear. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes--and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting... So where shall I put you? 
---
Allbeefwieners gripped the edges of the stool and thought, *not Alliance, not Alliance*. 
---
"Not Alliance, eh?" said the small voice. "Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and the Alliance will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that--no? Well, if you're sure--better be...
---
FOR THE HORDE!"
---
Yeah, that’s my back-up plan.  Which sometimes doing things like this can be fun in itself, but idk what class I even want to choose. Hoping to find a neat organized place I can look at everything for every class and different brackets to see what looks like the most fun
---
Kalimdor.. but STV.. mayne ment Eastern Kingdoms... but NE... I dont get this post.
---
thanks for comment, next please.. who said i do not want 60? was just wondering as pvper to play heroic wow again with undergeared into raid nolifer nabs and still outplain them :)
---
Undeads don't have a single class availabe to them that orcs or troll don't, right?
---
Playing a witch elf in Warhammer Age of Reckoning when I took a break from WoW between TBC and WOTLK, half of her abilities required to be behind the target so I had to learn how to strafe and how to use keybinds.
---
I never did click.  It just seemed natural/easier to keybind abilities and leave the mouse dedicated to camera &amp; movement controls.
---
But they're attempting to run the game in it's originality on a new client... 
---
I'm no programmer but shit man I'm sure I can't even begin to comprehend what it must be like to pick through all of that code to unbreak everything that wasn't compatible or authentic to vanilla. 
---
It feels a little disrespectful to the individuals involved who are doing all the work to make this happen for us.
---
Your newborn will sleep on average about 12-15 hours a day, so you’ll have PLENTY of time to play. 
---
It’s the 2+ year olds that are a handful

this is like the only one of these memes that's really made me laugh, it's always the beaks or raptor heads that give me trouble tho
---
Hundreds lel
---
I remember following Joanas leveling guide back in the day and hitting 60 with about 350-400g, and that is totally ignoring professions in favor of leveling speed.  You loot damn near everything, vendor it all, don't waste gold on useless skill training if it isn't applicable to your spec, don't buy dumb greens/blues off the AH for leveling.
---
You pick up A LOT of shit from 1-60 given the sheer amount of grinding you have to do.  Not like today where the bulk of your experience comes from quest turn ins.
---
You could watch some YouTube highlights on a class I suppose. 
---
Look at talent trees per class all the way up to 39/49 and see what looks fun for YOU. Make your own twink that no one expects or follow a traditional route. Play the brackets on an alt when bg's are released and see what the playing field is like and what you think would work for your play style.
---
This ain't it chief, of the 6 tanks I've played with, 2 held perfect aggro every fight with no "threat building", the other 4 couldn't hold aggro in a 1v1 situation against a mob with the healer only keeping them above 35%. As soon as the healer cast a single spell they drew full aggro.

Just doing the warrior quests (the mid-20 for the chestpiece) you can get a helm having +8sta+7agi having half the armor. Just from BS there's green iron/barbaric iron/golden scale helms with good stats on them and half the armor as well. Herod one just laughs at it. Stamina, strength and crit outweigh  200 armor so hard.    
---
Armor helps mitigation vs pure physical but stamina works against *anything*. Offensive stats have the same effect due to lower TTK -&gt;reduced damage taken-&gt;lower chance to get killed and less downtime. Even spirit does the trick for some regen to reduce downtime. 
---
Armor isn't worth enough to sacrifice everything else unless you're a bear, and even in this case you still need enough stamina to make it worthwhile.
---
60 because it’s a whole new game. 39 bgs fucking suck. It’s just like one Druid can just do whatever the hell he wants with a flag while ur stuck on foot. Imagine having a 100% mount to crush that annoying ass Druid.
---
Is this the MMO-Champ forums? I thought i clicked on r/classicwow
---
No you don't replace "it all" in a few levels while leveling.
---
I 1 million percent agree, but I do not see them doing this. If they release it in the current phases, PVP servers will be dead 1 week after p2 and pve servers will pick up after p3.  
---
Releasing AV, WSG, and then AB later yet is a bad idea imo. They need those to come out when the advanced pvp rewards come out.
---
If they leave it as it sits, it will be a very very very greif filled environment on pvp servers.
---
A bonus for 60s fighting 60s would be fun, but 10 zillion percent exploited. Groups would just form up and get in discord, then go to a zone and just gang bang each other over and over to get ranks. Sort of better then the farming of lowbies just trying to level, but unless they are going to monitor stuff, I do not see them making that change.
---
I really want to play a druid but comments like this are so discouraging.
---
Fact
---
Murloc Eyes for Westfall Stew or whatever that was.
---
I could never get enough freaking Murloc Eyes and they're running all over the place in patrols on that shore god damnit just let me pull you one at a time you little bastards.
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
I have the SteelSeries Rival 110 so I’m guessing it not quite like the naga in terms of 0-10 button layout. 
---
So if I go to keybindings in the options menu, I can assign anything from any of my 4 in game clickable bars? Or only the 1-10 buttons?
---
Why?
---
Relax, babies don't remember the first couple years anyway.
---
Am i the only one who liked these low drop rate quests? They give you an excuse to just grind but in a way that doesn't just feel like pure grinding because you have a goal.
---
You can just read the initial level 1 quest text.

What you don't know, Trin, is that life experences are what makes the man--or the woman in your case--and this blan--uh, cape will protect you from the most important danger of em all: cops. Yeah, you have this blanket on and--cape, I meant cape--cops just think you're homeless. It sounds crazy, I know, but trust me sweetie, it works.
---
Don't you get more Orgrimmar rep from doing quests in Durotar? I plan to get a wolf on my undead rogue.
---
I think one of the reasons they went away from 40man raids was the ridiculous ui requirements as a healer.
---
Do us all a favor and don't play classic at all...
---
What a shame. We all are so much more than our politician of choice. Such a large, large amount of folks however put their identity in their political party. It's a tragedy. To them I want to say, "You're so much more than either red or blue!" 
---
Unfortunately, for the media that is in large part responsible for the current climate, hatred and division = $$$. We should focus more on what brings us together, not what tears us apart. Cheers to you my WoW bretheren. If there's one thing we can all enjoy together, it's this!
---
This. 
---
Lots of good advice in this thread, but pushing yourself is key. It's very easy to get good in your comfort zone, but playing optimally when shit goes sideways means having experience in those situations and is precisely why mages are a high skill cap class. Then when you fail, and you will a lot, adapt. Add spells, change key bindings, think about specs, think about stats, ask around, and repeat.
---
That's what sick time is for.
---
It's literally your post title...And another troll blocked.
---
Eh right in the big ones ToS say no multiboxing being that alt tabbing or using third party software. My guess is that you just havent been caught and people dont care enough to report you =).
---
Haha i want exactly the same. Also rolling undead rogue. Was wondering how much rep i would have with orgrimmar when i start questing in those areas right from the start. Made a post about it a few days ago
---
Damn this made me laugh hard
---
I ain’t as sold on that line of thinking. Besides, that ain’t a reason to not have a back-up plan just in case.
---
Is there anything keeping you from rp on a regular pvp server?
---
warcraft 2
---
Even further. He believed it was the ONLY thing to do and to not do it was wrong.
---
From the top of my head, apart from a few items (that are all quest items), you’ll usually be able to find a better or equivalent item not long after you do the dungeon, and the upgrades are so minor at lower levels that it hardly matters anyway.
---
So basically everyone is saying how we were citizens of our specific geographic areas and we wanted to join the Alliance / Horde armies and we're just living life.  
---
God damn a lot has changed from vanilla to BFA. We once were struggling to find refrehing spring water or some tough jerky... Now we're freaking gods....   
---
Who knew?
---
Why stop there? Detach from your loved ones right in time for the honor patch.
---
As someone who has been plying Blizzard games for close to a decade now, I can absolutely tell you their word is almost meaningless these days. I wouldn’t trust anything they say until an actual date is fully confirmed.
---
I never started clicking. There are certain things that i'd click like health pots but for the most part I used key bindings since the start.
---
I feel like people are forgetting warriors and Pallies wear mail till 40. Depending on the mail helm they had at 39 this could definitely be an upgrade.
---
I dunno about better per se. But it can be very useful to farm a certain mob that is known to drop items that higher level players need. Can bank the items and sell on AH once the market stabilizes
---
Don’t need a pet buff when you just sac it.
---
I'm so triggered
---
Checked out the post. Thanks. :)
---
!Remindme 6 months
---
For me, levels 1-6 are better in Deathknell than in Valley of Trials. Just a more interesting setting to start out in.
---
After that, though, I'd say Durotar is better than Tirisfal. The latter is quite a distinct setting, but I dont really like how all the quests are so spread out and far away from Brill, and the dark, depressing atmosphere of Tirisfal does get old after a while. In Durotar, all the quests are relatively close to the questing hubs (Sen'jin Village, Razor Hill, and a few more minor ones spread out in the northern/western parts of Durotar)
---
I came from FFXI where everything was done in the keyboard.  I never clicked combat spells.

---
Not even in the slightest
---
I feel like a lot of people missed the point here.  A lot of the comments are talking specifically to wanting to know the date so they can plan time off.
---
The entire point of what I can only assume as their hesitancy to pass along information is that they want to present a quality product.  The comments detailing the need for beta testing I can certainly agree with.
---
To the comments regarding scheduling of vacation time, I have sympathy for that reality, however that's kind of out of scope of the reason of the post.  I have a feeling they will provide a good amount of time between announcement and go live date, but I would rather them be confident in that information first off, instead of stating a date, only with the need to push it back (if needed), specifically for the public outcry" if they were to ever not meet the original date.  They had made a fair amount of backlash in the PR department in their Live aspect of the game, that I can understand their hesitancy with the Classic.
---
If all you wanna do is watch, plenty of streamers do stream their private server stuff now.
---
I have to disagree with your assessment of warlocks. I've leveled multiple warlocks to level cap naked just as a private challenge to myself. And I'd say that being able to do so without gear is a pretty damn convincing argument that warlocks are not gear dependent.
---
Only one of him during Vanilla, he still lives! (Was my very first character and still my main)
---
https://m.imgur.com/lnzrrvt
---
As for Shaman in Vanilla? What do you plan on doing, PvP, raids, quest only?
---
Nope, but finding other people to rp with may be more difficult on a regular pvp server. Hence why I think those interested in it should probably figure out where to form a community first so it’s easier to find people.
---
Hotbar 1-4 should allow you to bind any of those hotbar slots to any of the mouse buttons. So you should be able to put Mouse button 1(left click) to Hotbar 1 Slot 1. That should let you bind your thumb back/forward buttons to hotbar slots.
---
&gt; Imagine having a 100% mount to crush that annoying ass Druid.  
---
And then imagine him getting away still.
---
Don't feel like making a macro for every single ability, especially since in vanilla, macros don't show up the same way on action bars as normal abilities.
---
FAPs are even more of a reason why Warr/Druid is strong in Vanilla. Warrior can use FAP to get out of Nova, but FAPs aren't usable in arenas in TBC.
---
As for your desire to PvP. Are you talking battle grounds or world? Reason is that twinks WILL be present in battle grounds and because of that, gear is absolutely critical if you intend on actually enjoying yourself in battle grounds. I doubt that Blizzard will have a separate twink queue after all.
---
It depends on what you mean by “suboptimal experiences”, but giving yourself a challenge and testing your limits is a great way to get better by yourself. 
---
Try killing this elite by yourself without anyone’s help/see how low you can get its health down before dying. Try killing/managing multiple mobs at once. For PVP, it helps to look up skilled pvpers and see their playstyle and understand why they do X action in Y situation. Understand the potential and limits of your class. 
---
An example would be warrior leveling: learn how and when to hamstring kite. It’s extremely useful against fast-hitting mobs but completely useless against those that swing as slowly as you. Learn how to deal with multiple mobs and how Sweeping Strikes interacts with your various abilities. 
---
This is also a peek into the “hardcore” mentality of speedrunning raids that is prevalent on pservers; to see how much you can get away with, how many packs you can skip, how much threat gear your tank can have without dying, how many packs you can pull at the same time, or even bosses sometimes. It is to constantly challenge yourself and being with like-minded individuals. Clearing the content as fast as possible is also pretty fun. 
---
One of the highlights of my raiding career on pservers is a ZG pug where we pulled both big packs before Hakkar at the same time in order to go faster. It was extremely challenging. As a hunter, I was keeping one of the snake adds feared/trapped and kiting another one through Distracting Shot+slows while dpsing the other mobs. The druid was hibernating/rooting mobs, the mages were polymorphing mobs, the tanks were busy trying to keep aggro on the other mobs while being knocked around by the Champions and everyone was careful to not break the CCs, otherwise that mob would murder one of the healers. Nobody messed up too hard and clearing that pack felt like a much bigger achievement than most progression boss kills, to me, at least. 
---
What I’m trying to say is that challenging yourself and succeeding feels extremely rewarding on top of making you better in the process.
---
Ideally you should never do a dungeon more than once for quests.
---
The biggest reason people wouldn't do full BRD runs was that there was a mob level change 1/2 through the instance.  
---
The first half that would include the generals, arena, jail, and front door could be done by lvl 45's. After that it required almost lvl 55 to get to the princess. So if you do princess all the mobs at the start are grey, and if you do forge you can't go farther than the bar because all the mobs from there on out are 50+
---
In terms of raw xp questing is always always always faster, however with the ungodly grind that is 1-60, I found that it’s a lot easier to bare by dungeoning when you can’t stomach questing anymore.
---
So many times where I would’ve logged because I couldn’t take questing and someone’s like lf 1 heals zf! And I go, zonk out while healing, earn xp, and get an upgrade to make my next questing run that much easier
---
Quest and move on but for the instances with better gear (and more fun ones) I do them multiple times, for example Scarlet Monastery, Shadowfang Keep and Zul'farrak are places I like to do many runs of
---
So what, you are just gonna say "oh the game doesn't have much competition and all, it's fine that rankers get overpowered gear that is not even close to the blizzlike values".
---
I'm a BC Baby, could someone translate these hieroglyphics for me?
---
Pre 1.12 bre is actually better for pve. 
---
If you have full armor pen setup then the bosses most bosses have very little armor so getting 2100 armor pen is useless.
---
assuming you actually want to play the BG and not **only** farm kills...   
---
29's and 39's only 3(4) classes have +movement buffs/effects so those tend to reign supreme. Rogue/hunter/druid/(shaman). They all have a good power level in those brackets too. So i'd say roll one of those to twink.
---
TBC still had a lot of the greatness of Vanilla so you will do just fine, my dude.
---
Arcane resistance? Mustaches?
---
Make a lot of mage friends!
---
I'll be doing my part!
---
I could never imagine how someone would start clicking in the first place. Seems so awkward and slow.
---
Not really, go cat and spam claw. If things get tough go bear and spam maul. Pretty simple
---
For PvE, Boar without a doubt. It moves fast, grabs aggro solidly.
---
One tactic that I would frequently use is to have the Boar "gather" the mobs to me, whereupon I kill them. Namely, turn around until I sight my target(s). Click on a mob, command the boar to attack, and then look for another mob (if they're low enough, or I'm geared enough to handle multiple mobs). Once the boar charges the 1st target, immediately command it to attack the second. Repeat until a suitable number of mobs are chasing the boar, then recall the boar back to me until the chasing mobs are within range, command the boar to attack, and then start shooting. Switch between the targets, commanding the boar to attack and shooting them until all are dead. Then casually loot/skin the mobs. If I'm in a hurry, start the boar on gathering the next group to kill while I'm looting/skinning the previously killed group.
---
The nice thing about this method is that the pet runs faster than my character can run. So the gathering process is extremely time efficient. Although I do get complaints from time to time from other players asking me to stop killing everything in sight so that they get a chance to do so.
---
&gt;Is there even a designated off tank in Vanilla WoW or am I stuck playing a fury warrior who just slaps on some tanking gear when an off tank is required?
---
For good guilds, this is the case. But more casual guilds will have a dedicated offtank who gets priority on tank gear above fury warriors but ofc below MT.
---
Non-RP servers are usually full of edge lords trying to figure out ways to say racial slurs without getting banned. Not a good community to be apart of usually.
---
Thanks. I definitely might lean towards the 39. I like having more variety of spells   I definitely don’t want to do 19 at all.   But who knows maybe 29 could be cool too.
---
This happened to us on c'thun attempts. Nothing quite like our Paladin named Porky dropping a hotpocket on his lap, screaming in pain, and running his character into the entrance to get the entire raid eye beamed.
---
Yeah the first few days of the patch that brought them in I made a lot of gold. People use them but usually will buy all the mats then tip you some gold to make them. I’ll also give people a charge while doing dungeons and people will often tip
---
Those are totally different things???
---
Retail isn’t in need of saving it’s just not a game that most of the people in this sub enjoy.
---
I think I laughed a little too much at this. But it's worth it.
---
Well it's official, this picture has now made it onto every Sub I'm subscribed too except r/nba :p
---
To anyone intending to play a class you’ve never played before, I suggest trying it out on a private server first. If you get to lvl 20 or 30 and find out the class ain’t your thing you’ll have wasted so much time already.
---
whynotboth.jpeg
---
This is fantastic to hear.
---
Racials do not matter THAT much. Do you want a negligible % increase or to be happy with the look of your character?
---
I will be a PVPing with human warlock and nelf priest for that sweet meld + mc action.
---
I remember getting a whole 15-20 gold for that recipe. Put me much closer to buying my mount.
---
What Mountain Lion blood?
---
In all seriousness, I think I abandoned that quest back in the day.  Pretty sure I leveled out of the zone and said screw it.
---
I could be lying since I did the quest, like, once.
---
It sounds like this is a level of time commitment I can make work. I surely don't want the added responsibility of being raid leader but I'm relieved there will be dedicated OTs.
---
In your experience is it hard to find a raiding guild as a warrior tank in Vanilla? Warriors make up the bulk of class representation but I imagine most of these will be fury specced.
---
Bubble + mount escape is underrated too
---
&gt; Those are totally different things???
---
No.
---
I played dwarf on k3. 
---
I love the dwarf look but I think gnome might be better. 
---
Gnome is definitely better for premade because you will be fighting druids and mages a lot.
---
Live here in the south of the ecuador, will be winter by the summer lauch. So I need a laptop to play at my cozy bed.
---
I shivered looking at just how long Summer drags on for.  I don’t even like Summer, can we skip it this year so we can have Classic?
---
I’d go Rogurt. It’s delicious.
---
Warrior pros - highest dps, pvp premade gods, flexible.
---
Rogue pros - world pvp, stealth, and my personal favorite( YOU GET TO USE YOUR TIER SETS. Yep full bloodfang, full tier 2.5 and full tier 3    It feels so good)
---
Both are very good.   You will be wanted as both.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/batzz3/im_27_single_and_currently_unemployed_pls_dont/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Warrior is harder to master in pve, rogue is harder to master in pvp (well at least world pvp, premade is a bit different). 
---
If you want to strictly dps, don't play a warrior.
---
I think it was sometime in TBC when I started paying more attention to my performance in raids.
---
You're not my supervisor.
---
"From what I heard" - oya?
---
i just want to get to end game and not fall behind my friends who will have more time to play than me so i will have to be very targeted in my leveling.
---
its going to take me 3 months if not a bit more to hit cap for classic if i can reach my goal of about 7 days /played.
---
On pservers, they rarely have the subtility of having the Savannah Cub being a pet of the Savannah Matriarch (and hence untamable). So the Savannah Cub is frequently tamable. It's also level 9. It also have an attack speed of 1.2. And finally, it's not a rare like The Rake. In my opinion, a very useful cat to tame with little effort (although having a buddy or two to help kill off the Matriarch is definitely useful).
---
Now everyone’s a baby and reports everything.
---
And they all look the same.  That kills me the most.
---
Releases today, confirmed.
---
Honestly 49s PVP is my favorite. After attaining Rank 14 I missed those lower level simpler times. 
---
Especially the pug vs pug clusterfuck 30 minute ABs where it’s 1-1 stable vs farm because no one wants to defend a node.
---
Aside from what people have said there is a huge factor: avoid tunnel vision 
---
Keep you head up at all times for what’s going on around you. Value team achievement over individual achievement - that is to say, if you’re purely focusing on topping the meters you may be missing a threatening situation that’s brewing across the room.
---
As a hunter I know I can’t provide top dps. But with traps, fd, pet tank, kiting and distracting shot I can be a good wildcard if I’m looking out for those situations before they arise.
---
Also, twitch experience from playing shooters growing up helps :P
---
Have some asian genes in you
---
A man of culture i see.
---
Here I am sitting in the south in the US where we routinely flip between close to below freezing and burning hot in the span of twelve hours.
---
I'd be switching often between passive and aggressive. Have the pet on passive when I'm using it to gather multiple mobs to kill. Once the mobs were within range of me, switch to aggressive so the pet would immediately switch to another mob once the currently targeted mob is dead (instead of starting to run back to me). And once all the mobs are dead, switch back to passive.
---
They hate you because you speak the truth.
---
Ah, ok lol
---
Only??? What? Obviously it’s not only for that. It’s the obvious business decisions to make. Most of the people that resub for classic are probably not going to stick around for long so it doesn’t matter when they release it. Even the people that play for a long time will probably stay subbed to classic for the same amount of time regardless if it releases two months later on not. 
---
I guess logic goes out the window when you want to play classic right now lol. That would explain all the hate I’m getting.
---
I read so many different opinions on druids ranging from they are amazing to they are the worst class in vanilla. I do value pvp pretty highly. I just don't want to grind to 60 and get burned from my choice. I know they are the defacto flag carriers and make a great escapist, but I want to be to able to go toe to toe with someone if I choose to.
---
very early leveling my first character. honestly how could you play a hunter or a rogue without binds?
---
If I weren't poor, I'd give you Plat for this.
---
Good chat.
---
How much notice do you really need?
---
Our guild will probably wont do that favor coz we are not BFA or Fortnite kids. See ya WPvP, hope you will make it over 30s40s zones faster in peak times :)
---
You can go Toe to Toe with someone with the right gear. Stack armor, bear form, spam heals. You'll win through attrition, or the other guy will just run away. But from my memory, I was never worried about a druid and usually stomped them.
---
Blizz has launched two wow expansions without any serious problems. Legion was bigger than bfa and was pretty much a perfect launch.
---
Then have someone tag 1 mob, get it and leave
---
It's less about trying weird stuff that may or may not work, and understanding why that weird stuff may or may not work. The people that write guides have a specific purpose in mind for writing them. The mark of someone that has completely mastered their class is to know when it's wrong, or only true in a specific circumstance, and how to correct it.
---
For example, the guy that posted the BIS listing neglected to factor in racial weapon skills and proper hit caps for tanks. Many of the rogue setups he had were flat out wrong or a couple pieces off. I know that because I geared a rogue back then, and tanks knew what hit cap they needed to hit to not have taunt resisted.
---
To give you another ability example, we'd frequently have fuckups where rogues could save the day. Instructor razuveous was a fight where the priests had to mind control adds and tank the boss with them. If the mind control broke before the next one was set to be controlled to tank, he started one shotting melee. I can't tell you how many times I would save a pull by evasion tanking the boss while they fixed the mind control (sometimes more than once on the same fight).
---
Just know your class, know your abilities and try to think outside of the box when weird situations come up. Practice does make perfect as others have said.
---
If the Blizzard Community Managers saw /world on a private server they would die from a heartattack!
---
Ugh this already happened for me. My work schedule was just set until July 2020 and I can't really make any changes. I have a 2 week vacation penciled in at the start of August, so I'm hoping I guessed right or at least close to the release date.
---
Very carefully... But if we’re being honest, very sloppily. I remember when I started, I used the 1-5 keybinds. Then as I got more spells, it became too cumbersome to move my hand over to the right side of the numbers (didn’t know about being able to change binds). So I just started clicking everything. I’m surprised I managed to kill two of the other demons before switching to keybinds.
---
Hmmm let’s see... okay yeah none of what I said is a valid point because August isn’t in summer..
---
Oh wait yes it is lol
---
I won't say min-maxing is stupid because for people in endgame high end raiding that are skill capped that ~5% or whatever really does matter. 
---
      
---
But honestly if you are at the point where you still have to ask about the best race/class combos for a game that's existed and been min-maxed for 12 years with a wealth of resources available then you probably aren't one the people that are gonna benefit from it. Just my thoughts.
---
2/2 Improved Sprint lets you do what Escape Artist already did for gnomes, so...

"I don't like this place."

Good. That shit is fucking hilarious. If you dont like it mute or leave the channel (not you specifically).
---
Brewfest was such a cool one I wish was in Vanilla.
---
I never started. I played Diablo 2 heavily before WoW and I just translated the keybind idea from there.  
---
I was a keyboard turner though because it never dawned on me that the mouse could turn your character. I thought that's just how the game was.  
---
I dueled a warrior at level 30 or 40 and he ran around me in such tight circles. He murdered me. I asked him after how he turned on such a tight radius and he said "Use your mouse"  
---
I messed around until I found out to hold right click. Life changed. I never keyboard turned again after that.
---
Dragon Age??
---
I am going to play an orc hunter... I am only interested in 3 pets...
---
Cat(maybe boar) for pvp
---
Wolf for furious howl - end game pve
---
Bird(owl carrion) - for leveling - screech OP
---
Well I mean, he is pro changes. REPORT THE INFIDEL
---
Upvote for the GoT quote.
---
This is not just a WoW expansion, and it's most certainly more complex on their end. Why do you think they are practically begging the playerbase of Classic to deal with temporary sharding?
---
They have to flight a new server architecture that is supposed to handle Classic and Retail simultaneously. There's GOING to problems everywhere for both games, but it'll definitely be worse if they release as staggered as you suggest they will, as full load will go onto Classic as millions of players hop back onto WoW, a load they haven't needed to worry about since BFA's launch, with a new server architecture, in addition to tourist Retail players.
---
I hate that UD rogues have such bad rep. UD is easily my fav race in the game and really want to play rogue this time (was mage/shammy back then)
---
&gt;gnomewarlock69 the mage
---
Hmmmmm
---
Both are good
---
Rogue is more self reliant
---
Warriors need a group to shine
---
Why are you going to level with mining?
---
2019 players are quite different.    
---
This could be rough and feelings hurt over everything.
---
in 1.12, I feel warriors are a stronger class, but the solo utility a rogue brings such as ganking in cities and towns (if that is your thing) solo farming Dark Iron Ore, pick pocket running, farming thorium and books in DM, getting DM enchants, etc. etc.
---
Both have their merits.
---
Already told the fiancé the wedding was cancelled.
---
Read the stickied mod post; post classoc discussion is not allowed until phase 3 OR official mention of anything like that
---
I had no idea. Haha
---
Blizzard is going to make sure classic content is profitable before investing time and money into more classic content. 
---
IMO, many of the problems that became apparent in Cataclysm started during BC/WotLK (dungeon finder, easy catch-up/epics, multiple raid difficulties, less meaningful professions, etc...) . I would rather Blizzard learn what makes classic successful (assuming it is) and build from that design philosophy when implementing more content.
---
horde pve... we have a core from our TBC raiding guild coming back
---
Only thing I'd change is the daggers. You make a t-shirt ofthis with double Perdition’s or double Dragonfang Blades, I’d buy it.
---
It would make sense for blizzard to have a release date thats super close to when they announce it to maybe stagger all the tourists so they don’t have to make as many servers I suppose... I just think it’s more likely to come out after at this point with all the stuff about 8.2 that we’re getting, and I’m very convinced they will not come out too close to each other.
---
I will save all the materials on bank alts to use for my engi
---
Yes?
---
What episode and season is that from?
---
Imo it’s more likely they’ll use the major patch to compete rather than put out a buggy mess for classic seeing as they seem to really be trying to regain some trust from us.
---
I am delivering my thesis May 3rd, I’ve got thee months before starting life! I am so god damn pumped!

In a nutshell, the pet trainer will teach you growl, stamina, armor, and various resistances. Everything else, you need to learn out in the wild from other animals and then teach your pet.
---
I don't have advice for you that is not already being echoed, but I did want to say that I really wish I could have people like you on my server and in my social circle.  
---
It's rare for someone to get on a public forum and humbly admit that, while they are trying to get better, they are not the best at their class.  
---
The game needs more people who have this kind of humility, and who have the desire and drive to become better.  
---
If you're looking towards Alliance PVP servers, I hope I see you out there.
---
good luck with that.
---
My prayers have gorn unanswered before.
---
pray for June release

I think the most important thing people are failing to take into account is how long it will take for the rankers to get their gear. If they implement the PVP patch after phase 2, it will still take people weeks and months to get their pvp gear. The most you can jump in any given week is 2 ranks at best in the early ranks (unless you're top .8% from rank 1 and jump like 4.) Later ranks like 8+ require 2 weeks minimum per rank jump. How long are the phases going to be? 3 months? 4 months? It's going to take the entire phase and beyond to get anywhere near epic gear from pvp. By that time BWL should be out and there should be PVE equivalents out there.
---
I'd love to see more!
---
Gotcha! Well best of luck to you guys.
---
Wow, imagine if she didnt have Fort.
---
This would be great especially since my main will be mage and I will level an alt accordingly, hopefully u don't give up on this project or else i will have to level manually :O
---
ARCANITEEEE REAPERRRRRR HOOOOOOO

Right but I think the difference is that in other countries, other people having to cover for you isn't *your* problem, it's your company's problem.

24 hours after launch. On a private server with a bunch of wasted time running around and getting ganked for an hour I'm sitting at 23.5 with 21 hours played. EZ
---
They still have to ship WC3 Remastered (2019 release date) *and* the next WoW expansion in a timely fashion, or else they'll get heck from the shareholders. I'm more worried they'll release Classic "as-is" even if they haven't finished ironing everything out and just try to fix it later.
---
It's not. I tried my best to impersonate Ricky.
---
lol well shit, and here I was on the official forums telling people "just because you disagree doesn't make it trolling."
---
Well played, Blizz.
---
I believe they were green, not purple
---
Upvote simply for “purple drank.”
---
Well at that point why would we take about the convenience of cities?
---
A group of 2 would be the max, You will be slower at the start with those quests that require you to get a # of items, but later on you will be able to clear large groups easier and do them much faster. Plus you have less chance of being ganked while leveling.
---
10 out of 10 meme!
---
Loyalty is far more important than happiness. The number of training points available for your pet is a function of pet level and loyalty. Specifically level\*(loyalty-1). So switching to a new pet with low loyalty is going to severely gimp your pet's ability to survive and produce damage. It's much faster to stable current pet, grab a new pet to learn a new ability, grab stabled pet and teach new ability, than it is to get a new pet up to "best friend" to you can actually spend all the training points on useful abilities.
---
Could be a beta in sept and a late august release.
---
Not gonna lie, I'm hyped to get raid gear for pressing 1 and bringing a bag of soul shards to a raid.
---
You're totally right, I'm thinking of the BC potion that had a heal over time. My bad!
---
First... Bookmark [Classic Petopia.](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/)
---
Get the pet you want. Whenever a higher rank of an ability is available, stable your pet. Go tame the pet with the higher rank ability. Learn the ability from the new pet and once learned, abandon it. Get your pet out of the stable and teach the higher ranked ability.
---
Remember that it takes a fairly long time to get your pet's loyalty to maximum and until that happens, your pet is gonna be eating more food and producing less damage. Loyalty is EXTREMELY important for a vanilla pet. Once on a pserver, when I hit level 24, my boar was level 23. Since Charge 3 was available at level 24 and Bellygrub knows that ability, I went and tamed Bellygrub and shortly afterwards learned Charge 3. And a boar is a boar and since Bellygrub was level 24 and my stabled boar was level 23, I decided to keep Bellygrub and abandon my old boar. BIG mistake. Didn't get Bellygrub up to full loyalty until level 27 or so whereas if I had kept my old boar, it would have matched my level pretty quickly and be fully loyal before I even reached level 25.
---
Why is it one or the other?  It's both.
---
Not really, no. Longer sure, but hardly an inconvenience.
---
I love this. Although, bears couldn't use potions. Feral tank main here, just gonna go cry in a corner.
---
I remember trying to do BRD at 48, it was a fucking disaster. we never even made to the arena, that place was a fucking nightmare in Vanilla but it's still my favorite dungeon.

What if you fall behind on mining compared to your level? Are you going to stick around and make sure mining is up before you move on?

Do mages have Tables in Classic, I thought they got that shit in TBC

Good point.

Healing, and it took years of it to finally convince me to break the "clicker" habit almost completely. I still click things sometimes, but I keybind everything so it's easy to access without losing my mouse/camera control or stop moving.
---
I started healing casually in late TBC and dabbled in raid healing in Wrath. Bound all my heals and most-used buffs (like blessings) to mouse clicks but still clicked damage abilities while leveling and stuff. Finally bit the bullet in MoP and made an efficient keybind system and practiced it until I was used to it. I use similar binds and layouts across most PC games now.
---
more please
---
What about sidas bag? Or whatever it's called. I probably killed 500 oozes b4 I got the drop
---
Why is this the only nonsense redditnuke keeps saving? Yes, I totally broke my keyboard and totally don't get off to this shit. I misread and then dropped out. My initial assumptions were too far off to keep going. My first unedited post actually thought the 2 websites were actually 2 different people.
---
Hey guys! Here's a video for those curious about the "Spell Hunter" spec. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on youtube or right here on reddit.
---
What did you play?
---
There's some sweet quests in tirisfal. Angamand Mills quests, arugal's folly in silver pine a little later. That's about it really. But they're good!
---
Yeah the difference between my argument and yours is that all I did was point out how successful their previous launches were and you are pretending to know how their server architecture works.
---
Maybe, depends how far behind I am, how lvling as a whole is going, how the main pack is leveling in relation to me.
---
Who needs forty grand when you've got a shiny weapon that can two-shot Rag?
---
I actually never clicked. I played on a really terrible laptop until Cata, then played on a good laptop until WoD. The mouse was almost totally optional for me, aside from looting and targeted spells. I honestly didn't know how people played with a mouse.
---
I'd say the complaints about competition is short-sighted. The problem with making it EXACTLY blizz-like is that the pvp gear becomes essentially pointless. In that, it takes SO LONG and with such a massive time commitment, that it gates 99.9% of the total population. So yeah, I don't really see much of an issue with .01% of the vanilla population having really strong weapons earlier than most.
---
More people will hit r14 as the game goes on, but the benefit of reaching r14 becomes less and less a benefit until it is just outpaced by the pve gear. The only actual benefit at that point of grinding r14 during AQ 40 &amp; Naxx, is that after the grind you get a guaranteed weapon. But once AQ 40 &amp; Naxx are out, the armor will essentially not be used for PvE. There are to many alternative pieces that are easier to get and that are frankly better because of either raw stats or the hit % associated with them.
---
If PvPers could get r14 gear through a rating system, fine. It would be perfectly acceptable to gate the buffs to the items behind what the original release cycle was. But because it is such an insane grind, I 100% don't mind people being stronger for MC/BWL and parts of AQ. They frankly earned it. I hate the system, but I believe it's fair for them to be stronger if they suffered through that grind.

Shaman. Enhancement for PVP, Resto for Raiding.

I’m gonna PvP but I don’t want to be Horde
---
I’m going to be PvPing but I don’t want to play Horde
---
I think its still to early for this. Wait for the list of servers. If they don't launch with a RP-PvP server, then I think we RPPvPers should decide on a server.
---
I’ll be PvPing but don’t want to play Horde
---
Pretty much every single "all classes BIS List" turns out this way, having tons of inaccuracies because it's put together by someone who doesn't play those classes, and inevitably goes to google search and finds outdated / inaccurate information.
---
4 days 20 hours is the world record as a hunter iirc, so 9 days is very decent. 7 days is a pretty brisk pace.
---
What I did was Tirisfal Glades until level 10 and then I just booked it straight to The Barrens.
---
You can definitely head to Durotar at level 1 though! You'll be fine
---
Gonna tank SFK a few times to get my [[Silverlaine's Family Seal](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Silverlaine%27s_Family_Seal)]ring
---
No it's not. It received an upgrade every time it was patched. As someone who played vanilla on live servers - expose armor and sunder armor will not stack. They were mutually exclusive debuffs. At best you'll have 5 sunders, faerie fire, and annihilator/bashguuder armor reduction. There are a few other procs that reduce enemy armor too but the weapons they're on are too low level to make them worth using in a raid. That 2100 armor pen on BRE will definitely be useful.
---
Hahaha yeah people really don’t like any information that means they might not play classic as soon as possible.
---
And I’m glad someone agrees with my logic lol
---
Yeah, I kind of liked them for that reason too. I was just happy to be playing tbh lol

I too was just a lowly towns person working a shabby job for some master until I became an independent contractor.

Speaking from experience, creating text/video based guides is almost exclusively beneficial to you personally because both of the formats are impossible to follow when playing yourself. The issues only get exponentially worse if you're trying to multitask and keep fetch gathering nodes here and there.
---
I proposed a [solution a few months back](https://www.vanilla-questing.me/) that requires abit more work on the authors part, but is significantly easier to follow, study for details or modify in post without breaking something else. While I'm not saying my solution is the be all end all, don't put the ridiculous amount of effort into creating a 0-60 guide with a decade old tech.
---
Plate is 40, though.
---
 #justblizzardthings
---
Well we are a horde raiding guild, soo
---
I think this is emblematic of a larger issue, things in retail don't mean anything.     
---
In vanilla, actions meant things.   
---
Buffs, potions, food, quests. They mean things and I cant wait for Classic!
---
Can we figure out a normal way to announce were looking for a group? I've been farting around on P. Servers lately and the structures are varied and weird.             
---
        
---
For instance I want to make a group for RFC (Rage Fire Chasm) and I have a Healer and need 2 DPS and a Tank I would say:        
---
    
---
"LF3M RFC need Tank"                
---
                 
---
That conveys how many I need, I need one of them to be a tank and where the fuck we are going. but on Private Servers I'm seeing some crazy ass shit                   
---
"Tank and 2 DPS = g2g RFC"                
---
"LF3M have Heals, need DPS and a Tank for RFC"                
---
          
---
It's just weird all the extra shit people keep putting in there, has anyone else noticed this?
---
That can last till 35+ if you're otherwise just questing!
---
98 damage is sometimes the difference
---
You said "first pair of shoulders / helmet".
---
I don't think anyone would drop their current helmet in favor of a white item with no stats, just for that small increase of armor.
---
Especially considering that every single melee around the late 30s gets [this piece of hotness](http://classicdb.ch/?item=7719) from SM Arm.
---
&gt;The horde manage just fine without fear ward
---
Tremor Totem helps.
---
Well, sorry to tell you but this will not be possible in classic as spell power does not scale with hunter abilities.
---
If it ends up being July 16th as guessed by people, taking off the first 2 weeks in August wouldn't be bad at all. You could get quite a ways into your leveling before your two weeks and then power through and start doing level 60 stuff during your time off.
---
Done Valley of Trials many times.
---
Fuck that imp cave. The spider cave in Deathknell is a cakewalk and the Quilboar crag in Red Cloud Mesa is far more enjoyable.
---
And I dislike all of Sen'jin Village but love Bloodhoof Village and Brill. Razor Hill is ok but they send you back to the Echo Isles. :O
---
Errr, no. Green Iron Helm is what most players will be using, which is craftable for like 1.5g. There will be a TON of those on the AH from people leveling Blacksmithing.

---
And thats for 29. If you happen to find any mail helmets during the 11 next levels before 40, you will have an even smaller gap between that and the plate helm. The armor one is NEVER worth using.
---
Reporting you for for reporting this.
---
Yea we had a small chain going and was wondering where my comments went
---
i played a class that wasnt hunter
---
They said “classic summer” after we had gone a long time without any news when people were starting to question if it was still coming out in the summer. IMO it was just an eloquent way of saying that yes it’s still coming out at some point this summer. I’m not reading to much into that but maybe you’re right.
---
Not everybody is worth their salt.
---
Some blacksmith will craft this and throw it on the AH to be bought for a couple gold by someone who:
---
-Due to ignorance or chance is still wearing some low level cloth hood or equal trash
---
-Is just excited about wearing plate for the first time and doesn't care whatsoever about stats
---
-Cares about stats but mistakenly assumes plate = good
---
The above 3 made up a significant portion of dumbass vanilla players like myself
---
The paradigm shift that was created by Blizzard deciding to release classic is so large, that they are now numbering all years from the date of that decision.
---
Gotta wait another couple of milennia
---
Yea, I'm thinking on my main, I'm gonna take my time and do ALL the quests in ALL the zones. Crap, as soon as mobs starting giving rep for Ratchet, I might even try to get exalted killing pirates.
---

You don't understand speed running. First an ele shaman will have circle of flame, mark of the dragon lord, maril's eye and second wind to switch to after boss fights.  Second they will get innervated/mana tided on cd.  They will have zanzil and be popping pots/runes on cd.  They will have blue dragon for trash.

Back in TBC I wanted to be a better Rogue in PVP.  Always ran into issues during my opener where I couldn’t get enough abilities off in time. Eventually I just said “screw it” and put a bunch of key binds together. It was super uncomfortable at first but I make fun of anyone and everyone that doesn’t key bind now. Lolll
---
Hi, /u/adamsblueguitar

Why are you referencing 1.12 when he clearly states it was during BETA that he played and earnt said gold.

My place of employment just created a new vacation policy that requires 30 day notice so im gonna need blizzard to follow that policy as well....

Fundead 100%
---
Nice. I hear shamans are one of the druids counters XD
---
What kills tanks at low levels is magic damage and mobs with CC that prevent that healer for healing for X amount of time.
---
To survive this you need stamina. Having 500 more hp is infinitely better than having 10% more damage reduction from armor when mobs already dont hit that hard. Pre 60 content in Vanilla is often designed around not even having a proper tank, but just taking whatever you can find. Shamans do perfectly fine as tanks up to 40+ f.ex.

Google Spreadsheet with what I believe has every dungeon quest available in vanilla, the level range for them, quest xp, quest rewards and pre-quests needed for them.

this speaks to me
---
Darkest Dungeon, seriously fantastic game.
---
Alot of it has to do with pushing yourself to the limit alot. Testing your limits as a player and putting yourself in these situations. You start to panic less and focus on what you, individually could have done. Also, alot of these players look at "Worst Case Scenarios." How will you handle it if another group is pulled etc. What will you do if a pat comes and someone agros. Alot of it is Awareness, Critical Thinking, and Experience.
---
Oh yes this one is real nice
---
3d8h to get to 60?

It's 100% superstition but damnit if we won't believe still

Just play whatever appeals to you more lorewise or aesthetically, as pvp-wise those are somewhat equally good.

Discord of an old guild had it linked in a tab of useful things. Kept a copy lying around for classic :)

RIP Vent, and your ears.

Married with 3 kids and a dog. 730-whenever I decide to go to bed(or wife makes me) is my free time. PVE server for me as I just don't care about getting ganked any longer. I just want to play and do pvp in wsg/ab/av. Enjoy the time you have with your kid, only get it once. I unfortunately missed a lot of my oldest first few years due to 70-100 hr weeks and am sad I missed it.
---
Was thinking the same.. I think its going to be August for classic.
---
Nothing says I wrecked you like eating your corpse
---
Others are right that once or twice is the fastest in terms of efficiency. Nothing pre-55ish will matter that heavily in the way of hear, stats, etc.
---
For certain items that I particularly like or certain dungeons that I really like, I’ll run them multiple times at level, because I enjoy it and it’s fun. 
---
Do what you want.
---
Too late for me, I had to put in August 5-12 oh well
---
Really cool! Are you planning to color them fully? Would love to see some color!
---
Really hope not. It is a conspiracy theory but hoping blizzard doesn't believe in classic and is trying to sink it by dropping them at the same time. Just another way for us to prove them wrong and make classic bigger then the live game
---
for a noob - why it is like that? where's the big difference?
---
The Problem i have is that i played undead mage and female orc warrior in the past, so i kinda like both. I think hardiness is busted but kinda random and in tbc it gets weaker. Undead rogue is also kinda Mainstream, so a orc rogue would be a special snowflake.
---
tbh its damn hard :D
---
never stopped. PoM pyro 3 minute mage. dont need many buttons. told people i was arcane frost in raids. never was. made it all the way through aq 40 and got rank 10 in PVP. nerds
---
Well that conspiracy theory seems really dumb.
---
Yup, 8.2 will come before Classic. As they want to keep as many paying customera as possible there will be a time gap here.
---
I went through his videos and noted all the times per level. I put the doc here --&gt; https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S_cnMN6VG66175O-vxT2S-_sp46OKRhMAIGuUWGT8Qg

I have so many google docs open on my PC right now for classic lol
---
When you’re making your choice, yes, your opinion is the only one that matters.
---
Separate teams, so I wouldn’t think so logistically. 
---
I doubt it marketing-wise as well, but that’s a personal belief/observation.
---
Why wouldn't she? If she didn't we'd all be saying "wtf why doesn't she have fort?"
---
But my meme spec is viable and I play what I want in my non elitist guild! *gets farmed*
---
Why would they spend money on building a product and releasing it if they want it to die?  Why not just kill it now and save themselves the money?
---
I hope they don't release it at the same time since I plan to play both (not rushing to 60) but I want to be there for classic launch still..
---
Killing it with serpent sting. Doesnt get more Vanilla than this.
---
Undead if you want to look cool,
---
Orc if you care about min/maxing and want to smash undead rogues in duels.
---
In group pvp like BGs, you get to have OP holy pallies on your side.
---
In solo pvp you get to deal with WotF.
---
Yeah dude come play on a pvp server
---
Horde lok thar

Ah yes... the anal spam.
---
Classic was never coming before 8.2. Getting that out as fast as possible just gets us closer to a time that Classic launches.
---
I imagine we get the Classic testing a month after 8.2 and launch after that.
---
I mean it could have expired during the fight if someone was careless with rebuffing, or they were rushing. 
---
I'm just saying her health is so low that if that particular hunter didnt have that simple health buff it would be a completely different story.
---
Funny thing is I can play only while at work. I guess I'll have to inform my wife, that unfortunately, I will have to work extra for no additional payment...

If you think about it, somewhere out there, the boss of a random company will also be a huge WoW fan and as soon as his employee asks for specific dates for time off, the boss will know perfectly well why.

It'd have to be before Sept 23rd, which is when Autumn starts in the northern hemisphere, unless they push it back...which I doubt they'll do.
---
I'm sure they'll be strategic in how / when they release it, but I doubt that 8.2 moves Classic to Fall or Winter.
---
Depressing zone you mean
---
Alliance locks are better then horde ones. Only one horde class can dispel magic. Where as the alliance has 2 classes. It's a big freaking deal. That being said, warlocks are very good no matter what faction you play.
---
This was great
---
This fight was such a pain in the dick as a horde player. Cant even begin to guess the amount of hours wasted on this bish...
---
You are already half way to high warlord.
---
About a mile
---
I'd say august, I feel like they won't release before patch 8.2
---
Will of the Forsaken is a powerful racial against Warlocks, and there are many Undead.
---
Play what you find fun and mostly, play what you enjoy staring at the back of for hundreds of hours..  If you make it to 60 at like 200+ hours /played, would you rather look at a gnome/human or an orc/undead?  
---
Plus in PVE you get salvation which gives you some more damage before threat cap so you might get more benefit there in raiding.  for PVP yeah undead have WOTF but you can play around that.. wont really matter much in group PVP.. and if you're on a PVP server and really nervous just duo level or find a healer to run around with.
---
Waiting for classic is too fun. I hope it never comes out.
---
Shamans are good against casters in general. Lots of options to interrupt/absorb/dispel spells. Warriors can destroy you though, and a rogue with full CD's will as well. Unless you get some lucky WF procs.
---
You’re asking for a late August release boi
---
People are using logs and sims from p servers to tell them how to play retail classic.  And they don’t seem to understand that every class had a use. The dps peen flex wasn’t a thing in vanilla because some hybrids brought utility that helped kill stuff.  People forget that there were sometimes two Enhancement shaman in a raid because you stacked melee groups together. And that buffs in a raid environment only effected your group, not the whole raid.  We’re going to have a million warriors and no utility.
---
Wait are you posting in r/classicwow calling someone a nerd?
---
I can't.  I am literally unable to can.
---
I loved running dungeons in Vanilla. My PC was terrible so I barely did any raids. For me, while leveling, I had a blast doing dungeons multiple times, especially if there was loot I really wanted. I also liked the general practicing (as a healer or tank) and refining situational awareness. I think if you plan to heavily PVE at end game, it can't hurt to do them a few times, but if you're in a rush to 60 or plan to heavily pvp, then maybe not.
---
Undead never have to look like an Orc. Where if you pick Orc you’ll always look like an Orc. 
---
So Undead. It’s a no brainer. Undead don’t have brains.
---
Prawns dude, no Australian would say such a silly thing
---
Steadayy now, we're only havin' a laugh!
---
I didnt state that, someone else did.
---
👍
---
it either will or will not tbh
---
I prefer the level order for the dungeons, the wow dungeon companion is alphabetical and it makes browsing it in the order you would be doing it while leveling a pain, you end up flipping back and forth just to see what your path would be and only if you have an idea before hand what you are looking for.
---
We will be paying for Classic as well so it won't really be a loss in revenue for Blizzard.
---
Considering stockade doesnt have even a single stat on it that increase DPS, I disagree.
---
Lets be real. The only reason he's using them is they are epic.
---
It’s hard not to burn out but the attention this post has gotten has invigorated me :)
---
I think so. I'm like 90% sure they had a longer reach due to the hitbox. It might not be that way in classic though.
---
There's probably going to be more orcs this go around.
---
Honestly pretty pointless waste of gold.
---
There are other weapons that are nearly as good or situationally better. Like Malown's Slam.
---

I hit level 60, started using CTRA, and learned about mouseover macros.

I have found text guides quite easy to follow with dual monitor.

pvp
---
Fun is allowed, just remember that America invented fun.
---
Arcane shot and rogue poisons definitely scaled with spell damage in TBC
---
gnome is debatably better than dwarf
---
I played an alliance Warlock in Vanilla and it was fun. I started Shaman, but rerolled with some friends after a while. Got to 60, raided a little MC and BWL on the Alliance side, PVP'd a bit. People make the racials into a way bigger deal than they actually are.
---
This is exactly what I’m doing too, and yes I will keep my mining up to date as I level. I won’t be the fastest to 60 since I’m only taking a couple days off and then back to life, so there isn’t much need to rush and skip leveling my mining.
---
I suspect it's fairly easy to inadvertently rack up half a dozen or more DHKs in the space of 15 minutes while doing a city raid - especially if you're throwing out AoE attacks. Remember, civilians have the same combat AI as every other NPC, so they'll charge blindly into your Blizzard or Rain of Fire or jump straight into a raging pet's mouth.
---
Once again, you've effectively killed city raids.
---
And this is why I keep advocating DHKs simply be removed altogether on PvP servers. Everything else is a half-measure that fails to solve the problem they introduced in the first place.
---
Undead or die
---
Moon-stalkers in darkshore, you normally have to kill over 100 to get the claws
---
I feel the total opposite lol. Durotar is a sandy wasteland unfit for civilized life, it reminds me of Nevada.
---
Yeah but you can do it twice! Gnomes are also good because they are harder to click (much more relevant in big group settings).
---
NO CHANGES
---
Praying for that (Soon-not-soon) to be true!!
---
Red in Horde, Blue is Alliance and Yellow is neutral?            
---
            
---
This is fucking fantastic, i'll make good use of this.
---
Agreed. #NOCHANGES
---
I'm seeing this sentiment a lot... firstly it's really hard (read: time consuming) to get to rank 13, and secondly weapons are at rank 14 anyway which is even harder! I'd hardly call it game breaking to have perhaps 1 person with great gear a few months into the game.
---
*reeeeeeeeeeeeee*
---
The OCE classic wow discord already has about 700 members and I'm sure it will continue to increase.
---
&gt; \-I'm thinking of silly guild names and custom titles I'm going to give my guild members 
---
You're welcome to join "She looked lvl 18", a guild of me and a few rl friends
---
Releasing both 8.2 and Classic at the same time won't kill any of the games, but rather just even out the player base between them. This might even be the most logical solution to dampen the massive server overload for Classic launch, and an alternarive to sharding. Blizzard won't lose on it from an economic perspective either, since they will get the same monthly revenue independent of how the player base is split between the respective games.
---
Awesome. Ty! I will try this out.
---
It’s a slippery slope my friend, a firm nochanges keeps it simple and easy without risking way more controversial changes happening.
---
Nothing is as bad as people say.
---
Exactly this, Vanilla Pservers only really started to come on the rise during WOTLK which was notorious for just grouping shit and AOEing it down.
---
It's like people have never heard of threat multiplication..I can't have instant agrro on all the mobs haha.
---
Linked this as a reply to someone asking a question. Think people will find it useful so here it is on its own. Do not know who made the original spreadsheet. I just made a copy of it to save for Classic.

The slopes are so slippery. Super serially slippery.
---
You're drunk if you think classic numbers will be close to retail. at worst retail has 4 mil probably. Classic will be be a shock if it has 40k after a year. Maybe 300k try it out quickly but no way will they retain.
---
And im pumped for classic, but yall gotta chill. Classic is still a niche.
---
2 and 3 are covered by mods.
---
Almost everything that has turned retail into the hot mess it is today started as just a QoL change.
---
Better to just keep a hard stance on “No Changes.”
---
Probably was just my server but I only ended up getting 5g from it :( 
---
Still though, at the time that felt like so much.
---
If you play any race that is not an orc, you are not playing the game properly. Proven fact.
---
An annoying thing though is people who didn't play Vanila retail telling us that we're taking wrong, because we're not holding agrro as good on their broken ass private server.
---
Threat generation especially on packs on retail was a fucking nightmare, that's half the reason why you had to CC mobs because  you could regularly lose aggro to the healer who's just doing his job.
---
Rogue trinket won't remove KS/Blind in vanilla
---
T2 is doable for casual players.
---
You play on a private server but don’t know that there’s an addon for all these things? You don’t even use LazyPig and ExtendedQuestLog?
---
It might have been less. I just remember it feeling like a million gold back then.
---
What are the two Alliance classes that can dispel magic?
---
The only one I'll agree with is the quick linking of items in the text input string.
---
Shift+Click an item should propagate wherever you're typing with the item or link to it. I'm sure an addon could do it so I woudn't mind it implemented into the finished game.
---
Definitely no on 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Typical Redditor stuck in the past. Please educate yourself or allow yourself to be educated.
---
I have not seen anything specific on this, but given Battlemasters were added in 1.6.0 I think it's a safe guess that they will be there in phase 3 (i.e. when they introduce BGs).
---
I've also been making my own custom guide for launch but it's based off a 2 player group. I've found this allows me to push into quests longer and earlier than I would solo (For example I can finish the defense of the king's land chain at around 16 whereas a solo warrior or priest wouldn't have a chance) so it's a pretty unique guide.
---
I do enjoy looking at other guides though and seeing where I might be able to optimize so I look forward to yours
---
&gt;Dragonstalker helmet. That set looked fantastic, i hope they gief new high res versions of the old sets as well 😏
---
Well in pvp Alliance warlocks and Horde warlocks have diffrent jobs. As Alliance you will be doing more multi-dotting and adding more pressure because of paladins. As Horde you will be more focused on curses and controll, since you lack dispell and shamans tend to do damage.  
---
In PVE. its just better on Alliance side, blessings just allow you to do damage, with salvation especially. Warlocks already have threat problems. Haveing Blessings+BoP just makes it way more fun to play warlock.   
---
As to Racials, yeah Undeads breaking warlock CC is annoying, but its just that. When you face an UD you are aware he can break Fear and Seduce, and you just have to bait it out. And count on it before you start the fight
---
So, if Addon's already cover those things, why not just add them in the game rather than manually downloading addons?
---
Yes, this is the core concept behind performing well in pvp. You have to be able to cast something as quickly as you can think of it. Once you reach that point, you can really start learning the ins and outs of your character.
---
I think that is a vast assumption and not really true. I think the problems that WoW is currently facing are far more nuanced than "QoL changes".
---
They didn’t use vent
---
&gt; in vanilla, macros don't show up the same way on action bars as normal abilities.
---
I doubt we get the same macro functionality of Vanilla, I imagine it's going to be a tweaked version of what's in Retail.
---
Any good examples ?
---
Why not just make YaHT a game feature? Why not just make CallToArms a game feature? Why not just make LFR a game feature?
---
Yeah, really liked the one we had during vanilla.
---
If Taurens have a bigger hit box, does this mean it will be harder for them to be kited by a caster/hunter?
---
I really hope noone from outside this sub sees us all upvoting and praising this lol
---
But yeah I feel you.
---
My concern is not with the "Competitive guilds" it is with the environment we will be walking into that is needed to be considered competitive.  
---
By that I mean, I like to have somewhere near the best gear and be able to compete in most pvp battles. In vanilla, I could do that very well for the most part.  
---
The environment that 1.12 pvp gear being released THIS early will create is an area for everyone who wants to be better then average, which is typically the majority of the community, will be forced into an honor grind.  
---
You cannot openly think people will just mosey on through the pve content and knowing full well they could get better gear guaranteed if they grind some serious honor. Think they will just continue their once a week raid and hope to get the gear? In my experience, if people are guaranteed a reward after putting in a lot of time, then they are more likely to do that then play the RNG game.
---
So, people want to be competitive in the PVP aspect of this game as well as be able to do well in their raids. BIS gear on phase 2 will be what? PVP gear. By a long shot. Correct? Guaranteed gear for doing the grind.  
---
Yes yes, the Rankers will be another story, but this release without ANY other way to get those rewards will create environments of honor farming for everyone. Not just the rankers. This is primarily done by camping dungeon entrances, farming flight paths, and murdering people that have NO viable chance to compete. That is just how it is done.
---
Do you think the communities that want to do world pvp, on a smaller scale or are more casual will tolerate the massive groups of people doing the honor grind and spawn camping them? If you believe the community will not quit rapidly or just move to a pve server, then more power to them and you. I played the pvp servers originally and I just do not see that working. 
---
Also, everyone seems to think the honor grind will be harder then it was originally. I think people are way under estimating the coordination that is going to take place. There will be TONS of people swapping kills or "Dueling" all day long to get their honor. By having the BiS gear for most aspects of the game, it will force people to do this to consider themselves competitive or decent at the game.  
---
I do not think that is the intent here, but we all know what happens when there is a way to get BiS gear. I do not have a good answer to prevent this OTHER then making people of lesser level substantially less honor in some way. Let the 60s beat the crap out of the other 60s. WPvp should be a back and forth battle over some objective(release the worldpvp events, zones, encounters early). Give Bonuses for doing these. I think this would about solve the toxic death area that the leveling zones will become on pvp servers?
---
Paladin and priest versus just priest on horde.
---
You're right, what would I know. I've only played since TBC :S
---
That’s pretty sweet man. Any worry on running out of quests later?
---
Because some people want to relive vanilla as it was, with all of it's flaws and imperfections.
---
So glad I reformatted this ugly thing.
---
I'd say level with your friends, you'll have so much fun. Specially when you start running into the opposite faction.
---
Now everyone has to use the word "Communist" like some dank edgelord that has never studied history before.
---
I'm too lazy to. If yours is better, share away. Prob like yours better.
---
Unless you get clique or healbot, and then suddenly keybinds are the slow way again.
---
You say that but it is going to bring a ton of people back. Also new people who try it may find they like it better. Classic will probably start large take a dip them grow over time. You are also forgetting the power streamers have and how many are going to be playing
---
Yes you/we will; just depends on how the boss handles it.
---
Fury/prot is more gear dependent though according to this video:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmlcHhlDLVw
---
Iron going for like 20-30 silver per piece though.
---
1. Avoid the streamers’ servers.  
---
2. ??
---
3. Profit.
---
1. Just the tip  
---
2. A couple more inches  
---
3. More inches still  
---
4. The whole damn thing  
---
5. All my bros as well  
---
6. Every guy on the block
---
Man everyone got the whole right to bear larks thing wrong huh.
---
Had Warlock and Hunter 49 twinks in vanilla &amp; TBC, feel free to ask here or PM me if you have any questions about that bracket.
---
That's just entirely not true. I'd like to see you run a dungeon with a hunter pet as the tank
---
barrens chat on p-server is just racist shit, dunno what happend to these kids
---
The problem with that is civilians have the same combat AI as every other NPC, so as soon as the bread vendor sees an enemy character he hoists his baguette, lets out a battle cry and charges to his doom.
---
Nor does the enemy character even need to deliberately kill the civilian. AoE attacks, pets, any number of things could net you a DHK without even realizing it, let alone intending to.
---
Really, the only solution is to simply remove DHKs altogether, at least on PvP servers. I don't know what the solution for PvE/RP servers would be.
---
Those features affect gameplay, these potential QoL fixes do not in whatever way affect gameplay.
---
&gt;expose armor and sunder armor will not stack. 
---
Of course not, they never ever had. But I guess you watched tipsout missinformed video and now making that as your basis.
---
&gt;At best you'll have 5 sunders, faerie fire, and annihilator/bashguuder armor reduction
---
No at best you have expose armor faerie fire etc. 
---
This is more than enough to reduce almost every boss armor to be very low, to the point where the extra 200 armor debuff that the original BRE gives, is way better than the 300-700 armor debuff on yourself that bre can at most give since the bosses only have that little armor.
---
The reason you're earning down-votes is arguably because you're not suggesting an alternate solution and/or providing any contextual evidence to support that alternate solution. 
---
You're simply stating an outright opinion (you can't...all other talents are far superior), without telling the O.P. *which* and *why*, in your mind.
---
Nope, every section has a grind until X level so even if exp values are wonkey I've got a built in system to stabilize my run. That and once I hit around 55 I no longer care about questing or leveling, I change focus to farming certain things and begin collecting my preraid BiS gear (Lots of BRD runs to start with which will get me a few levels)
---
I had the exact same experience! All or almost all our raid wiped on huhuran leaving a hunter alive (the soon to be famous rogerbrown of Method). This was back in 2006 on Vashj EU.
---
I think that's fine and a valid argument, but these changes don't fix all of vanillas imperfections. I still think you can enjoy playing an authentic playing experience, even if all or even one of these changes are implemented.
---
I remember watching my then-boyfriend playing WoW then having a go myself - Tauren warrior,  turning using the cursor keys shuffle-shuffle-shuffle! 
---
3 months later me and best mate are hooked, still haven't learned how to play properly - we're somehow under the impression that you can't hand in quests in a party and get full XP so ungroup every time we hand in to an NPC.
---
Actually taking the time to enjoy exploring; Ally pallys running past Tarren Mill being chased by Deathguard; running the Stranglethorn marathon at low levels just to get the Booty Bay flight path; the absolute terror at seeing your first devilsaur! Oh my god it was fun!
---
With each expansion pack we went from obsessed to barely casual players before giving up. Hearing the news about Vanilla is making me and then-boyfriend-now-husband giddy again! I feel like Ron Burgundy blowing the conch shell! I'm putting the band back together! I can't wait to get the team back online!
---
You don't even need food air and water, as you don't need to be alive. You just want to be.
---
Nah, I love Sen'jin Village and the Echo Isles (could just be due to the fact that I love trolls). It does take another person to get through it smoothly, but I have confidence that it wont be a problem finding one throughout much, if not all of Classic.
---
If they don’t affect gameplay in any way are they really necessary?
---
Alcaz island. It was hydras, not dragonkin
---
Nah you're the only drunk one here if you think retail has 4mil subs lmao
---
Agree. It also makes even low level gear like Herod's Shoulder stand out so much more. I remember running SM with my friends several times until we all had it - Warrior, Shaman, Hunter.
---
No changes but still... Dual Talent Spec.
---
Yeah, a Shaman in Tirisfal is going to have a bad time with trainers
---
Organized events. Thriving economy. Action. Shitposting.   
---
Sounds like streamer server will be great!
---
This summer.
---
Some lesser known stuff about locks: 
---
-Warlocks can drain mana many bosses (most notably in ZG) leaving many caster bosses without their abilities. This also works well in 1v1 pvp vs casters. 
---
-Warlocks have some of the strongest damage mitigation skills in the game in the form of Curse of Tongues and Curse of Weakness.
---
-Given enough space, a Warlock with Curse of Exhaustion can kite a boss to the ends of the earth "Do you hear me Malganis?!" (this works for the entirety of Scholo)
---
-It's a common courtesy to buff people as you pass by them. Warlocks have a choice of using Unending Breath or Detect Invisibility. Most of the time and in pvp zones you'll buff with Detect Invisibility but in locations with prolific water stuff like the coast of Wetlands you'll use Unending Breath.
---
-Low rank Curse of Recklessness will prevent mobs from running without buffing their attack too much. 
---
-A common tactic for farming the elite demons is to Enslave one and use them to take down another then summon your blueberry which will undo the control on the other demon so you can kill it at low health. You could potentially fear juggle a third with Curse of Doom on it and with that you can solo 3 lvl 60 elites in about 1 min and 30 sec.
---
-Unending Breath and Detect Invisibility function as dispel protection in pvp situations.
---
-With Detect Greater Invisibility, Paranoia, and Perception a Human Warlock still doesn't have enough time to successfully cast Howl of Terror before he is ambushed (Not that it matters against an Undead Rogue). An Engineer can circumvent this by using a grenade to stun the Rogue out of stealth. 
---
-There is an offhand out of Uldaman that players can use to damage themselves rendering the Succubus useless in pvp situations against tryhards.
---
E P I C
---
Thanks for all responses, I do like the Undead rogue think they look cool too
---
I leveled a Shaman, and a priest in vanilla, and raid healed with both. Here are my experiences.  
---
In terms of raw healing the priest was the best, bar none. If you want to be a main healer go priest. Group healing is probably your weakest ability, but even then you have ways to do it and the shield is a lifesaver. The downside is that the priest was the worst to level. It was slow with no good way to deal with multiple mobs. Still, you could heal 5 man dungeons as shadow priest up until level 50.  
---
The shaman is the opposite. Fun to level but noticeably less strong when raid healing. In raiding you can group heal very well, but you will run out of mana much faster than a priest when trying to be a primary tank healer. You will wish you had a heal over time spell. When leveling you could get away with being elemental and still be a healer in 5 man dungeons until level 50. I personally didn't like having to move totems everywhere.
---
Thanks for the imput! I think the biggest get away from the conversation is we all want to play an authentic version of Vanilla WoW and I agree that keeping the game in tune with how it once was is the best way to offer that authentic experience. Somethings though, however, I think could improve the overall quality, while still providing that authentic experience. To each to their own and I appreciate your opinion and willingness to promote discussion.
---
August 27 only leaves 4 days of summer.
---
What if they have a plan to smooth out launch day congestion?
---
What if that plan is to just release Classic without any word of caution at all?
---
I just find that idea hilarious while also being a giant mistake.
---
Sadist haha
---
You look ridiculous and I love it
---
Between June 21 and September 23rd. Or more realistically, between June 25th and September 17th.
---
When I got a Razer naga which was quickly replaced by my logitech G600.
---
Not only for MMO's but for all games, having constant control of WASD while having 12+ buttons to press  with your thumb is OP.
---
Yes! I remember being so happy when I got Herod's Shoulder back in the day.
---
Do you get exploration exp in vanilla? I don't remember.
---
It really boils down to wether you wanna be a sneaky boi with pokey sticks or a fighty boi with big axe
---
I felt the same way about RPvP servers.
---
Here's hoping we're both pleasantly surprised when they finally announce a realms list.
---
8.2 speculated date is [end of May](https://www.wowhead.com/news=289916/speculation-on-the-patch-release-dates-for-8-1-5-8-2-and-azshara-raid), there will be some time between that and Classic.
---
I agree it doesn't make much sense to release 8.2 and Classic at the same time, I believe Blizz will want to keep retail subscribers by giving them something to try (Classic) *after* 8.2 content runs dry.
---
I see your point.
---
Griefing and this isn't really an excuse, will happen regardless of if there are rewards attached to it or [not.](https://not.Now) Now, will it be more prevalent with those rewards at the end? Sure. But I don't foresee the gap between rank release and BG's lasting that long.
---
Coordination will most certainly help in the process, but depending on server sizes and therefore pvp community involvement. The grind could inevitably become much more difficult. There are going to be sold accounts and BS happening all over the scene that will cause premades to play more than they would otherwise need to.
---
I don't like the system at all. But for the grind that it will be and for the limited number of people that will complete it while it still is a sizeable gap in power. I don't see much of an issue. As far as skill in pvp goes, there are a plethora of ways for undergeared people to absolutely outplay and beat heavily geared idiots. Now it's not going to be only 'skill based' like BGs seem to be in retail with their gear normalization. But I think that aspect defeats the purpose of gear progression in the first place.
---
At some point, it's like. "Damn right I want to be able to absolutely stomp this other player that is a fresh 60 because I put XXX hours into the game!" Now whether that geared person is actually good by the time they get their r14 gear? Whose to say, maybe or maybe not. But I feel like an advantage is warranted. You're going to have an advantage available no matter what.
---
2 guilds can run the same BWL the same amounts of times, but if the damn black book keeps dropping and MemeStrike for one guild and the other is getting BWL trinkets off every kill and TF bindings etc. It is what it is. Or if someone doesn't have time to raid and is out in the world in dungeon gear vs another person that is full BWL. That other guy put in the time to have that gear gap. That's essentially how I look at it. Everyone has the ability to create that gear gap, some will get luckier than others on drops. Some will have vastly more time than others. But that is essentially the game. I think that's a huge reason why the people that love Vanilla wow love it. Community and grind = rewards.
---
Because these changes can offer a smooth gaming experience and limit the amount of unnecessary annoyances that the game brings, while still holding true to an authentic reconstruction of Vanilla WoW.
---
I’m with yah. I’m all for random shit gear!!
---
I see alot of people talking about the need to farm the gnome mace. While it's true that it's a huge dps boost, you can still really do fine dps without one (you will need to learn how to powershift properly). Sure you will not top but you shouldn't be last either if you aren't in hardcore guild (in MC and BWL even without mcp you will be near the top, you will fall down after that due to the lack of good upgrade compared to other class after that tho).
---
Also, if you don't mind tanking, you can join a guild as an offtank/ half dps. The expectation on your dps will be lower.
---
But most people who resub for classic aren't retail customers anyway so why would it matter if they release both at the same time?
---
There are videos of every segment of the guide. It's a hunter named Varrak on a private server. Times will be updated for classic once it launches as things will be a bit different.
---
So... spring/autumn in northern Utah, then.
---
Y'all can keep the humidity, though. I'm a desert rat and I like it that way.
---
Its perfectly possible. I have done gnomeregan with a hunter pet in Vanilla, and ZF with a broken tooth tank on private servers.
---
Hunter pets are actually incredibly durable in Vanilla if specced into the BM tree. Some guilds even used them in Naxxramas to bypass some of the mechanics like Locust Swarm (pets are immune)

---
Orcs because they are the master race. Also 25% more stun resist.
---
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.
---
same problem, but with more classes to choose.
---
Since i see something good and fun in every class its super hard to choose.
---
But i know that i don't want to play druids, mages or hunters.
---
As for your question
---
Rogue has stealth, which is always fun and also lots of other good and nice abilities.
---
Shaman has LIGHTNING and heals + can turn into a wolf.
---
I can't wait for the rush that is equipping my first pair of shoulders.
---
I feel sorry for your wife
---
The mob's in the entire dungeon were so close together, several patrols in every area. On top of the dogs running away all the time. It was so easy to wipe without any crowd control. Every pull was like a puzzle for a the low levels.
---
Not really hard. But sure.
---
Can't wait for people to look like retarded clowns with their BiS gear.
---
Ive Played rogue for a bit of time but never shaman, I was never one to heal in groups I always found myself dps. I just want to do high damage.
---
I am going to be leveling with a friend who is playing mage.
---
Alchemist, keep [[Strong Troll's Blood Potion](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=3388)] in Auction House as they are needed for the Elixir of Agony quest in Tarren Mill.
---
Hunter using Serpent Sting on the boss? That's a loot ban.
---
It's not likely a pug will manage aq40 until very, very late into the game.
---
Only twitch kids want to be on a server with twitch kids. kappa?
---
Haha amen! There's no better feeling than hitting level 15 and finally equipping those sweet, sweet Canvas Shoulderpads
---
At lvl 40 green cloth helms sit at around 45-50 armor. A white lvl 24 cloth helm has about 30-35 armor. Where are you getting your stats from? That's at least a 300 increase in armor, which is nothing to scoff at. I agree that Raging Berserker is way better, and heck even Green Iron helm is better in my eyes but if you're gonna use an extreme example at least get it right.

Summer 2019. There ya go boss hog
---
Unfortunately in the intervening years I have learned (and care) more about Chuck Norris' politics. I might launch a Saufang counteroffensive on any claims that Chuck Norris is as badass as my High Overlord.
---
I'm going Horde, PvP server.
---
I spent 90% of my time from vanilla to WotLK as a career Ally, with the other 10% being dabbling in getting Horde lowbie alts between the 20's and 30's before going back to my mains. 
---
This time, I want to experience the other half of the story, and the unfamiliarity of the Horde relative to Alliance will make an old game feel that much more new again, because there will be aspects of it that I never explored the first go 'round.
---
Now I remember why my 13 year old self so so tittilated by WoW.
---
the best thing to vendor to generate raw gold early on is bandages imo
---
I'll have an alchemist alt just to produce those for my other alts.
---
Didn't realise they come complete with the 7.x client version of the game
---
Different strokes for different folks!
---
Chuck Norris was already pretty dated as an actor then so I'm sure it'll be more relevant now that it is even older.
---
Or there's always [Rowsdower](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3oD4UNKw8A)
---
If they launch oceanic servers, I think our choice will be simple as there will probably only be 1 type of each server to choose.
---
Pvping in pve spec with your friends
---
Then i would go for pure dps, since then you can only do damage and that is what you want to do right?
---
No one can ask you heal in raids and whatnot, since you are only doing dps.
---
You do, there were even leveling strats in the more crowded fan servers that revolves around exploring certain areas to level up around the massive crush of people at launch.
---
Can't Shaman dispel with Purge???
---
“I’ll rip the secrets from your flesh”

I feel you, I'm giving birth for the first time in late August and hoping I get a taste of WoW before then.. but wow will have to stop when the baby comes :/

Hooves are easy IMO, thunderlizard horn on the other hand...
---
1. Go orc for racials

2. Do the noggenfogger quest

3. Become a nogoholic

Best of both worlds

Hook it up! I'm sure you can sell those things for 15-40 silver a piece! Imagine how many players are going to spend a half hour killing murlocs only to realize they're going to need to dish out all the silver they just earned on a dang potion in Auction House.
---
It's exploitation of the Sunken Cost Fallacy at it's finest.
---
I'm just saying that the line that the website has drawn for "optimal" should not exist, considering that nowhere does it claim that it only cares about "optimal" specs.
---
Pserver EXP rates are fucked (they're about 20-25% too high, and quest rewards are way too high), 3d8h is not likely to be what you're going to get on Classic, there will be more grinding involved as quests won't come close to providing enough EXP.
---
Because the recent beta ran on 1.12 client?
---
TRUE LULW
---
It can definitely be a raid spot that fills fairly quickly and most tanks stay dedicated but eventually can and will burn out as the server progresses. Initially speaking, it is best to find yourself a guild between now and release to plan ahead - one that fits your schedule and raiding type (hardcore, semi-casual, casual).
---
If you just show up and play the game from Day 1, you can still find a guild eventually but the opportunities will be far and few between. This becomes even harder to place yourself if you are schedule bound on your raid times and less flexible.
---
Most warriors you see will stay 1-59 and likely either A) never make the full grind to 60 or B) very slowly make the grind. It is to your advantage to stick to your warrior and play aggressively to 60 quickly for a fast tank raid spot. Most warriors at 60 will choose to be fury, yes. As I am sure you are aware, tanking is not a fun and laid back as just doing damage. It is much like a job and has a lot of responsibilities, so it's more taxing and doesn't appeal to many. Furthermore, all these people boasting about rolling a tank are in for a rude awakening when they realize it isn't easy in Vanilla mostly due to having less tools at your disposal.
---
Also employee: LF job
---
Dad, do you remember the day I was born?
---
I sure do son. It was when Classic release date was announced.
---
The /who function will be your best bet. 
---
Like the others said there will be huge time constraints when leveling up with just 1 person, but with the /who function you can locate someone at your level in any given area that you can message to party up with at the time and when they have to log you can just /who your area and find another person. 
---
This will probably be the best way to make friends along the way to 60 and they will be more inclined to group up with you then and in the future because you took the trouble to seek them personally and that generally feels good to people. 
---
It also gives you the opportunity to pick the people you want to quest with. For example, you're in the Barrons ready to pick up a Warlock quest. You can /who to find another Warlock in your level range that would be interested in teaming up to do the quest chain. Or, lets say you specced into Resto for some reason as a Shaman and you needed some burly Tauren to hold your agro you could search for Warriors in your level range and area that would be more than happy to team up (warriors suck solo but can be very effective leveling as a team).
---
This is also a great way to get people you need for instance groups.
---
You can level without them, but the DPS boost and subsequent mob kill time will be significant
---
Play PvP. That will be the best way to train yourself to adapt quickly to changing situations
---
And I am saying that you have the draw the line somewhere, because you can always think of some other spec you might try.   Also, I think its reasonable for a BiS gear list to only worry about BiS specs. If you are playing a meme arms dps spec, you already don't care about playing optimally.   In the end though, one true BiS list is not really accurate as it will change depending on the encounter, your racials, so many things.
---
Sir, you deserve a medal for that link
---
Facts. I have a 6 year old, and a newborn due July 4th... I’m trying to decide if people like you could help me raise both. * buys another gaming rig*
---
The Kiwis will be right there with ya! Beanies on and everything.
---
Am kind of curious if Zygor is interested in writing a Classic guide (probably not, I think would be too small of a player base compared to retail if he was looking to make actual money)
---
I couldn't remember which instance he was in so foolishly googled "SM torturer". Forgot I'm on my work computer. Instant flag. Tomorrow will be fun...
---
If he kept his backups all he'd need to do is dig out his old vanilla guide and reupload it.
---
the post is referring to clicking of spells or abillities, not as a means of movement or camera
---
Triggered
---
People bounce around zones out of order now while levelling in retail as levels are meaningless now lol, and its more of a checklist of "quests you have done to get the achievement for questing in zone". The game will breadcrumb you along just fine in retail on its own, but it won't be an optimized route, and won't let you know what to farm before arriving at a quest area so you can just grab the quest and turn it in instantly.
---
Holding shift adds the power of justice.
---
Good stuff! I wish you the best!
---
Definitely, they’re both solid for their levels and hard to replace.
---
We find out in 1-2 weeks, take it easy.

That's pretty sad

No kidding. Sounds like she's going to be taking care of two infants soon.

Top choice of font colour.
---
+100 stress damage if nostalgia trinket is equipped
---
I came to WoW from Counterstrike and was used to making my own keybindings, I never clicked and was genuinely surprised when I realised that's what my girlfriend was doing. She never stopped though, even through WotLK.
---
Who needs a job when you have classic wow??
---
*And* you get +1 blacksmithing. Each +1 to your trade skill is worth a couple gold, at that level.
---
PTR usually take like 2 months if not more for such a major patch
---
1 Shadow Priest is perfectly fine for 90% of guilds. Sure, try hard guilds will use a disc priest specced for shadow weaving but that is very min/max and really unnecessary. You don't need a perfect raid composition to clear anything in Vanilla.
---
"Naaaadroj, take a seat. I just wanted to enquire as to why you've been using the company computer to Google for what I can only assume is Submissive Male Torturer?"
---
Wrong but nice try
---
Do you have the money in the bank to take FMLA for a year, and get some value out of that baby in the form of extended time off work?
---
You got a lot of wrong information homie, including the wrong item stats based on each patch version. I guess it's one thing to consider that we don't know if they are doing progressive itemization yet (at least I don't think we know yet) but you should _assume_ we are and adjust the item stats to their pre-buffed states.
---
This is good practice, you should always have a couple of upgrades waiting for you, either bargains off the AH or gear from instances.
---
Don't know about "legit" runs, the stuff I did was on [retardedly broken pre-nost pserver]
---
thanks for the info, though.
---
Is your info based on pserver data or vanilla?
---
yes
---
That is amazing
---
That first shoulder equip even if it's gray felt like I picked up a fucking legendary in retail
---
The original comment was referring to defensive magic dispel. Shaman can only dispel magic offensively.
---
See I'm heavily against that. What makes vanilla unique is the fact that you DON'T have the option to dual spec. That allows for some interesting combinations of talents. That type of change would ruin the authenticity of vanilla WoW.
---
What is the number 3 and low numbers for? Not like level 3 right? Haha
---
Hey, it's free xp.
---
The last boss of Razorfen Downs drops [Icemetal Barbute](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=10763), which is an upgrade for a tank. Maybe not for a DPS or healear, though a healer might even still be wearing cloth (or engineering lenses).
---
Bookmarked.
---
That's a BC recipe lmfao
---
True, but people use health bars way more now than in retail Vanilla. And tab-targeting.
---
They're pretty cheap considering they have 5 charges and they persist through death. Especially compared to what melee DPS and tanks have to do for buffs. Every caster who raids will want these oils and they will always sell.
---
Oh iv been putting in the lip work, Im getting that time off.
---
The thing nobody has said (probably because they _think_ they are the shit), surround yourself with better players. Your social circle is what will really elevate you.
---
&gt; Your salary is the average salary of your social circle.
---
Hi, /u/toffmcsoft
---
The baby won’t remember how much time you spent with it so might as well just let it play with the family pet and keep grinding. Props OP!
---
Yeah but we have summers where sometimes it doesn’t dip below 30 for weeks. Even at night! So I guess it’s relative? But fuck, I hate winter down under all ready, let alone having to deal with snow and icy roads and all that crap... I’ll take my average 15 degrees and complain all the same hahaha
---
If you’d like to play horde pve server and raid Friday and Saturday 11pm to 3 am EST, I’ve got a raid spot for you my dude.  DM me.
---
No one really cares, as long as u pull ur weight
---
1) is already in game
---
Had a scenario a bit like this on onyxia on recent pserver.  Was fucking hilarious, we were all cheering on the last man standing (our finest resto shaman) and he bloody well did it.
---
Those are the moments that make wow so special
---
12/10 would meme again
---
BiS is for the most part for raiding. Do you plan to raid?
---
So could i pull weight/heal as well w/o BiS?
---
Being excited about a game. Go to see the site with the 8th most traffic on the entire web and see what it says about it. == Nerd. Hmm I guess that makes sense. I was saying in the way you regard min/max and how in general people play games. People play for fun a majority of the time not to be the best.
---
Hmmm mocking anothers culture isn't very MultiCultural of you. I should report you to the EU diversity commission for bigotry?
---
Cmon bro you know the only flame-retardant QoL is Guild Banks.
---
Yea sure u won't be top notch, but good enough
---
Did a quest and got a purple from it instead of a green. I got gear from 3 more quests that were bad compared to it before I did a dungeon that dropped an upgrade. The realization that I should have had several upgrades but my "lucky" rng made them feel like garbage still pops in my head. I mean if the reward was from a chain quest like The SFK ring in Vanilla I can understand not getting upgrades but the quest was just a random "Kill X dudes".
---
Can I get an invite to that brotato
---
The most popular twinking site is xpoff.com
---
They have a WoW Classic section where you can ask or search for it.
---
Good luck!
---
I do, not super hardcore--honestly pvp is what i like best--but having been in vanilla but not being in a guild capable of MC or onyxia--that is a goal of mine
---
I’ve been playing Minecraft and smash Bros lately. It’s fun, but it’s really just to distract me until classic wow :,(
---
If I was a boss I'd legit do a "team building exersise" at launch.
---
Close the store, set-up a LAN inside and play together for a few days.
---
Sunny D, Orange juice, apple juice....ah purple drank
---
This thread is made 10 times a day. Join the club and wait like an adult you claim to be
---
Had extra armor too
---
Stop and do? The quests in those dungeons will make your late 30s easier.
---
I think groups of level 60's gang banging each other is EXACTLY what everyone wants. It's fun, competitive pvp.
---
I still think 60's should kill anything that gives honor, but the meta being to farm lowbies will make for a cancerous gaming environment imo
---
HAHAHA I LOVE IT
---
Totally agree. there are some great grinding spots with excellent vendor trash...no reason to scrounge for your mount money or deal with really annoying ganking
---
this is why you are not a boss lol. terrible business decision!
---
Dude, he is talking about playing a ele/resto shaman in mail. That means he dont have mana tide or MP5 gear. He will stand oom half of the raid...
---
im also really looking forward to how mismatched and odd people will look. ahh the nostalgia \^\_\^
---
Mana pots, innervate and fsr are a thing
---
Yes. It also means its harder to kite against a melee as a tauren shaman for example.
---
Indeed, no mana tide. And oom is (just realized out of mana...)
---
Many companies run team building weekends each year, some more than one. Who sais it has to be on a ski resort?
---
Yeah its not as big of a difference now that people are better. Still something though.

They'd be met with huge backlash if they didn't have atleast one, so it's pretty safe to say there will be atleast one.

que guild y que server?

So excited!!!
---
The intention may be to release them at the same time, creating a spike of subscription and content for players.
---
Wait a second-- doesn't Australia only get down to like 10 degrees C in winter? Here in Montreal your mom will just tell you 'Put on a sweater' :P
---
Unless taurens still got a bigger hitbox in retail, I doubt they will keep having bigger hitbox in classic
---
I never wore Cloth, and once I replaced the leather with Mail, never went back to it on my Shaman. Leveled Enhance, raided Resto. It won't matter at all. BiS is honestly dumb to me for Vanilla. There might be a few set bonuses that make a larger difference, but it's going to be  a few extra HP healed, a tiny little bit of DPS. The ones that it matters the most for is Tanks, and even then, as long as they hit a certain level of Defense/Weapon Skill/etc, it doesn't matter.
---
If you´re not wearing that ugly teal robe im calling the police!
---
Seriously though, just dont join a hardcore min-max guild and you will be fine probably.
---
Trust me, getting hammered gets old faster than you think
---
I'm pretty confident, based on no information at all, that Classic won't launch until at least halfway through summer at this point, if not late summer.
---
Why do you think that? Theyve emulated all the combat mechanics, such as spell batching from vanilla as well. Why would they not keep this one?
---
They've called it a classic summer in the past, which makes me think at least half of summer we will have the game...
---
Not bad at all. You face undeads, sure. Horde locks have to deal with fearward/palas instead. In premade bgs its pretty even. 
---
In pve alliance is just straight up better (bop, salvation)

&lt;Sangre&gt; Probably the top alliance guild in Spinebreaker / ZulJin
---
What was your progress in Naxx?
---
&gt; Each +1 to your trade skill is worth a couple gold, at that level.

The value of a level up is determined by the cost of materials used to level up. I don't think anyone is arguing crafting isn't worthwhile, just that it is expensive.
---
Yep, [that's the good shit](https://puu.sh/Ddmhg/1c0663ef24.png)
---
^ case in point.

See this is what I'm worried about. There are so many trash recipes but how do you know the good ones

I'm not a mod, but before one notices or just to be in line with the sub-Reddit rules, the above is #4.
---
Otherwise, much of what you're saying makes sense about warlocks not being as plentiful as mages and significantly underrepresented compared with rogues.
---
Nostalgia is an addictive substance isn't it?
---
These really aren't what I'd call quality-of-life changes, but actual gameplay-impacting changes in most examples.
---
Quality of life, IMO, is something like adding colorblind mode.
---
Poor little boy is just upset everyone will be on classic and leave his precious life on bfa lmao

I had mine on until level 40 or so when someone told me to take it off after seeing a screenshot of me on my mount. 
---
And no, I wasn't a hunter or a warrior or some class that actually had a use for it - I was a warlock. I also kept my staff skill up to my level at all times because I figured it would either a: be helpful in casting, or b: be helpful with melee since the Firestone was a thing.

Of course, neither were true and I was just an idiot. But I bet I was one of the few locks on my server with 300 weapon skill in staffs.

Summer ends September 23rd
---
That's a little farther down the line than what he's talking. Think that quest is around level 50 and these are more in the mid-high 30s, iirc.
---
Pre-raid BiS is not that hard to get, especially for a healer -- it's just rng on the boss drops in dungeons. 
---
You can get away with sub-optimal specs in MC, but it will come to bite you in the ass in later raids. If your whole guild is rolling sub-optimal specs and going half ass on consumables then you guys will be hating raiding. 
---
I've run a Shaman through most of Naxx on 2-3 different toons now. You wont be getting BiS ele gear until AQ40 is on farm -- so you'll have to go heavy resto for manatide and pull your weight if you really want great ele gear. 
---
You can get a great set for ele with BWL/ZG gear ... but its up to you if you want to work for that gear or have your guildies carry you to it.
---
That doesn't even make sense. Color blind mode affects gameplay for those that need it as much as the other aforementioned changes, but one is considered qol and the others aren't? Come now that's dumb.
---
Keep in mind it takes 30 seconds+ for a single craft. Really effects the profitability of TSM.
---
I don't even play BfA, but nice projecting kid, shows how confident you are.
---
Also, you are mentally ill if you think Classic will surpass BfA at any point past the first month. Your previous comments seem to indicate so as well.
---
&gt;You said "first pair of shoulders / helmet".
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I don't think anyone would drop their current helmet in favor of a white item with no stats, just for that small increase of armor.
---
You have no idea. People did that all the time
---
saved! looking forward to it.

Quested with a warlock last night. I was a mage and my buddy a rogue. It was great. I'd cast maybe one frostbolt or two (Which would get aggro on me) and the DoTs killed the mob quickly. We were all lv 8 or so doing the Haunted Mills quests in Tirisfal.
---
Loved having a warlock on our team. I'm still not a fan of the mage.
---
you might be looking at an autumn release
---
&gt; That's a BC recipe lmfao
---
[No it isn't ](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3836/green-iron-helm#comments)
---
I could be wrong but I just don't see why they would do that as it can be an advantage or disadvantage compared to other races.
---
Imagine if they kept the original dwarf and gnome hitbox too - so many people would abuse safespotting in pvp and pve...
---
I rolled half of TBC mostly clicking. Then again I was rolling the one button BM hunter macro at the time so &gt;.&gt;
---
Wow that's sooo great to hear!
---
I actually have the same goal with my online business.
---
What do you mean by safespotting exactly? Similar to dead zoning?
---
I click even less now when I realized I could keybind my entire Numpad to my action bars. And I finally get to hide my action bars. I love it!
---
Got a few macros for buffing myself specifically. Times are good.
---
What are you planning on doing with these?
---
That’s already how it works. Im pretty sure you get more honour from targets at or above your level and you get diminishing honour from killing the same person up until you’ve killed them 10 times at which point you get 0 from them. 
---
I was pretty concerned about ganking for honour being a problem but I’ve had my mind changed. People farming honour will probably do it in smaller groups because honour is split between members so it won’t be hard to organize a group to shut them down. 
---
People with nothing better to do will probably spend an awful lot of time camping people that farm honour on lowbies too lols
---
It's easier on horde?
---
I would too. I live in Adelaide so we have really hot, dry summer days. Queensland for example has really humid days with lower temp. I’d prefer a day of 42 and dry to 30 and humid!
---
This summer just gone, we had a day where it hit 47 in Adelaide, the temp didn’t drop below 32 overnight... that wasn’t as bad as the summer we had 18 days or something of +35... I was a student then and air con was.. hard to come by.
---
The best thing before transmog was that you’d be able to tell how geared everyone was by just looking at them. I’m looking forward to that again.
---
I don’t know why they can’t give us just the month it might release in.
---
Shit name two months.
---
More seriously, If you only do this, you’ll end up dead quite quickly. You don’t have the dps to kill anyone in cat and you’re squishy as f...
---
You’ll need to use a big panel of skills to win a duel in vanilla. In bc, yeah it was much easier with mangle
---
It also leaves one hoof removed and ready to be turned in! :P
---
Wrong
---
I was talkin about questing mainly, yeah in duels you'll have a bad time.
---
That's already the case.
---
The issue is not with farming people under 60, it's with farming anyone and everyone as efficiently as possible.
---
Which generally means a group of 4-5 people sitting in front of a high traffic flight master waiting for someone to land.
---
it was harder as Horde because we didnt have paladin to bubble heal through the enrage spam that wiped most groups.
---
The absolute worst is the Glutton Shackles in the Deep Elm in Silverpine Forest but I think this may just be a bug in Private Servers.
---
You have to clear out that entire cave + Outside the cave like 8 times for 6 shackles.
---
Shamans have totems for nature/poison which paladins do not
---
I agree completely, but it's "Muh Blizzlike" so they won't dare change things by removing DK's all together. 
---
Ideally, they'd just change it so civilians only attack if they are attacked, and put them on their own ID so players can make so their spells/attacks never hit them. Then make so DK's ONLY apply to players who get the killing blow on the AI NPC. 
---
Seems like the best solution.
---
Doing acceptable DPS as a Feral Druid involves a ridiculous time commitment for consumables - and you still won't beat Warriors or Rogues who put in less time than you do.
---
IMO Druids are most useful as tanks and healers.
---
"I brought you into this world, and I can take you out" - WoW talking to your business.
---
*Cue Linken Park music*
---
Oh yeah for questioning, you’re right!
---
The reason I quit tbc briefly after it was released was because I missed my Stormrage 8/8 too much 😂 just couldn’t handle looking a scrub after putting all that effort in for the full tier set
---
Basically glitching through/under game objects and environment so that you can't be reached by spells or attacks other than AoE maybe.
---
Dwarfs and gnomes can run under bandwagons in wsg and stay under there with the flag and be unkillable. Theres also several spots in both horde and ally bases where they can do the same thing.
---
The totems absorbed 1 hit while the boss spammed damage. They were really not as useful as they sound.
---
Hi everyone,
---
I’ve decided to come back to WoW after 6 years, looking forward to Classic.  
---
I wouldn’t call myself a hardcore player, going to play with some RL buddies and end game Raid/PVP
---
Looking to play a Rogue or Warrior I believe but which one would you say it the easier of the two to master?
---
I'm happy to tank 5 mans etc but when it comes to raiding no, strictly DPS for raids.
---
Would love to hear all your suggestions on which one
---
Appreciate all the replies thanks!
---
What if Blizzard gave every person in the server first raid a choice of one item from the Naxx loot table.Would that be a problem? It takes a lot of work to be the first guild on the server to complete a raid. Not many people on the server would have these items.
---
It would take 5 minutes for Blizzard to rebalance the PvP so that they are appropriate for content level. The fact that they aren't doing it is concerning.
---
Yeah you'll actually get a bit of time at the start to play, but it will reduce as they get older. It's still doable, I'm a new dad and I haven't given up gaming, but it's now something I enjoy fully when I get the time to do it.
---
Yes cause theyre fun dungeons.
---
I was mainly referring to NR totems.
---
in regards to your skill bar: figure out a key bind and rotation style you are comfortable with. ex, most classes/specs, i like to bind my keys so my go to starting attack is on 2, a self heal is at 6 and my main interrupt at 8 (and put other moves in between). because its mostly consistent across my characters, its easy for me to automatically know what to press no matter the situation. i picked those keys to bind to because of the way i like to rest my hand on my keyboard. also, make efficient use of all your extra bars (i suggest getting an addon for bar placement but i know not everyone like em). once i standardized my hotbar it became a lot easier to just go on reflex.
---
&gt;Transmog in retail makes it so easy to make your character look badass that it takes all the fun out of getting new gear.
---
Actually the gear in retail takes the fun out of gear in retail, it has nothing to do with transmog, which is one of the best features they introduced. 
---
Funny to see people excited about this when looking like a clown was absolutely fucking hated in Vanilla.
---
Yeah they used TeamSpeak! Lol noob! 
---
/sarcasm off
---
Hi, /u/JHoneyBadgerS
---
&gt; will it be super noticable?
---
If you're trying to get into a serious guild that cares about BiS?
---
Then yes, it will be noticeable
---
If you're just playing casually, than do whatever you want
---
So the comment from 2005 was just a prediction of the future? These are the original thottbot comments as wowhead bought the site.
---
Yeah but Escape Artist can resist.
---
Sometime during TBC, after I installed BartTender - which allowed me to arrange my buttons on screen in the same way I had my keybinds. Had tried duding Vanilla using the number keys but couldn't get used to it. Once I shifted to 1,Q,E,R,T,F,G,Z,X,C with shift, control and alt (and importantly, visual paging when I pressed shift control and alt), I adapted quickly. Still used clicks for things off the GCD and Nuke buttons that I don't hit frequently though. Not enough buttons/too many things to press. 
---
T will forever be bound to an interrupt in my mind as a result.
---
Aha right, thanks!
---
Going full t1 or 2 on shaman is pretty viable so you can do that.
---
More like 70 copper
---
The moment you will lose a PvP fight(especially one that you really wanted to win), realizing that you lost only because you didn't have *racial ability name* you will be cursing yourself for it.
---
Doing either one I think is fine, doing both isn't worth.
---
Im ahead of the pack
---
[Citation needed]
---
I'm guessing its gonna be mid-late August since thats when blizzard likes to release "summer" games. Also the fact that its April and they still haven't announced a release date...
---
I sure as hell hope so.  It was a vast improvement to the BG scene when it was implemented in the later stages of vanilla.
---
In certain leather pieces, Dwarf Female cleavage looks very juicy.
---
It is better for the option for addons to cover things that blizzard doing it.
---
Addons are completely voluntary, can do whatever you want them to, and doesn't take time off blizzard hands, what is there not to like?
---
Daggers. On fire. Fuxking fire daggers!
---
It ruined the bgs.  Ruined the community, it was not part of vanilla as a whole and shouldn’t be in classic either.
---
ally warlock being poor is a complete myth. They are stronger than horde in BG's, though weaker than orc in wpvp due to orc being plain overpowered. Will of the forsaken is not a big deal, warlocks don't revolve around chain fearing at all.
---
Warrior T3 next.
---
Thank you all for the great feedback and kind comments! I will be working on a warrior guide next and I would love to hear any thoughts. &lt;3
---
Four to five raid nights every week is like DnT levels of raid progression, I don't think organizing 40 mans on that level is something 99 percent of players anticipate or look forward to. Also I disagree with 'dps always care'. Huntards and trailerpark rogues will still be a thing in classic. Agree with everything else you said.
---
Id be wary of becoming an "Offtank" as its a term whose meaning has changed and has become more and more like the MT in pservers. Back in retail there definitely was a MT/OT kind of priority and while it still exists, its kind of becoming more blurred because theres so many fights that require 2 geared tanks. The second tank is basically expected to be just as committed as the first tank.
---
As a third tank, you can find a guild, but that is the definitive handme down spot. The top 2 tanks will basically be splitting whatever gear then need and youll be 3rd to get everything. Some guilds will even run 4 tanks, so its certainly not an impossible role to fill, just a bit more difficult.
---
Pretty sure this was confirmed already that there WILL NOT be crossrealm bgs
---
Lol!
---
Source?
---
The best part is you can keep reliving nostalgia. It never gets old.
---
Correct. You’ll be thinking of the racials that you didn’t have when you lose, never thinking of the racials that you do have that helped you win.
---
I know I did! In LBRS. Thanks for reminding me :D
---
Umm. No.
---
I mean lots of the game wasn't part of vanilla as a whole. Naxx wasn't part of much of vanilla, should we exclude that? Unless you're saying it wasn't in vanilla, which it 100% was. How did it ruin BGs? I argue it made them playable for people who don't have 2 hours to wait for one BG.
---
Why warlock
---
This is so common in the classic wow subreddit. Okay you disagree, but you need to explain more than "no"
---
Ye nvm, I just looked it up and I was mistaken it with cross-realm grouping. https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2042
---
For me, it was Diablo 2 (and hacking the hell out of it).
---
So many of us get the itch from video games. Congrats.
---
You are perfectly fine with any spec and any gear you want, as far as your fantasy does not impact other player experience negatively. 
---
Even the bottom-end clickers don't want to spend hours in dungeons for nothing because their healer intentionally sticks to "mail only" fantasy and because of that is not able to outheal the incoming damage.
---
The day they made a design decision to remove buffs until you got closer to max level was one among many days were blizzard lost sight of their original philosophy.
---
I told my wife that I’m either getting to 60 on time or getting a divorce lol.
---
I came here looking for 'You're a wizard Lovestospooge", but this is even better.
---
You’ll probably be able to find a guild that won’t really care what you do, but most raid leaders / guilds are going to require that you work towards BIS and eventually gave it equipped.  You might be able to get away with it for a while, or maybe even indefinitely, but don’t expect to be first (or second, or tenth) in line when an awesome piece of gear drops that you want.  It’s going to go to the players that are getting the most out of their character, and that’s honestly how it should be.
---
If you just want to raid casually from time to time, it probably won’t matter tho.
---
1. Would impact the social aspect of the game. Get used to having to talk to people more.  
---
2. Get an addon.  
---
3. Get an addon.  
---
4. Wait, you don't like having your mount on the action bar?  
---
5. Nope. Reduces travel time which affects the feel of how big the world is.  
---
6. Just learn to abandon them and move on.
---
That's really nice! I really enjoy it when I'm playing and hear dudes talk about how they're able to work from home or whatever (either self-employed or doing tech work from home), and they all sound like they really love it.
---
What weapons do you think would go best for a warrior version?
---
Solid post.  Thanks for contributing.
---
On one hand, I kind of disagree. Obviously "upsetting" is a broad word, and obviously it's purposefully broad to Blizzard can determine what's banworthy. Not so that *anything potentially* upsetting is ban worthy. 
---
On the other hand.. I admit, I do deeply miss the vernacular of the earlier internet.
---
Not really.  It's all just opinion.  That guy thinks it is an improvement, the other doesn't.  Neither one of them really provide any reasoning.
---
Elluna, I've got it on an external hard drive somewhere
---
Really?
---
- Linen Cloth: 13 copper
---
- Linen Bandage: 10 copper (3c loss)
---
- Heavy Linen Bandage: 20 copper (6c loss)
---
- Wool Cloth: 33 copper
---
- Wool Bandage: 28 copper (5c loss)
---
- Heavy Wool Bandage: 57 copper (9c loss)
---
just vendor the cloth.
---
The one thing I think needs explaining more than where I came from, is why can't I die?
---
No, it isn't. Very few people will get rank 14 gear anyways. It won't make the slightest differenct to most players.
---
Colorblind mode improves accessibility for the game. Cutting hearth cooldown times in half devalues Mage portals, as one obvious gameplay/economy impact.
---
For sure others will notice, but probably not in a mean way. Folks tend to give suggestions when they don't know if the person realizes there is a way to play/gear for even more damage.
---
yeah that's pretty heartbreaking! Replacing your Stormrage with a quest green lmao
---
Aesthetics are usually tied to racials that have close to no use or very little usage compared to obvious ones.
---
Never played a Ret pally before..... is this my future?
---
Only if you're American.
---
The guild will have a certain standard for the number of each role. They're not gonna bring 8 warlocks to 1 raid. Also, this kind of loot rivalry is only going to cost you good times. Treat them as fellow class players with the same taste as you, not people you gotta worry over.
---
Crossrealm BGs ruined the sense of community that everybody had when you knew and played against the same people from the same server. Crossrealm anything contributed to the decline of WoW. 
---
They might’ve helped the server with 30 minute queues due to population imbalance or low population, but at too high of a cost in the long run.
---
If you’re in the northern hemisphere..
---
As a Canadian I am offended.
---
I miss epic raiding
---
truuuuueeee
---
I also stopped clicking because I couldn't kite on my hunter to save my life...which I couldn't. Nor could I save the lives of anyone in my party if they needed me to kite.
---
Their point boils down to "You probably already have something better so don't downgrade to this just because you can", how does that translate to what you said?
---
I just wish i still had my burning crusade Zboard for this. That shit was lit.
---
I'm assuming the first is basing his reasoning on what I stated in the description of the post. The second ends any chance of a dialogue. It's frustrating when people just say you're wrong but won't actually attempt to change the mind of the other person. It creates 2 camps of people that won't talk to each other. We need discourse that is geared towards finding an objectively better wow. I'm actually interested in why Weaponsonline thinks xrealm bgs are bad, because he might have a reason that I could agree with. Instead the conversation is shut down, we have 2 camps who disagree and don't know why, and the game is no better for it.
---
I am going to write a country song about losing my wife, kids, and truck to World of Warcraft addiction.
---
Thinking more Hank III Outlaw style though. Not so much hip pop.
---
You sure would. And then the time you narrowly die you’ll be wishing you were a Tauren and the time you got feared you’ll be wishing you were undead.
---
Me too.  I'm looking forward to seeing people in the gear they're actually using for a change.
---
[Here is a shot of my rogue with some random greens and blues](https://i.imgur.com/AJ63nzE.jpg)
---
glorious.
---
It'll just be that extra special when you do get gear that looks half decent and/or matching set.
---
You hacked the website
---
Ah
---
Is there a benefit to farming honor before the ranking system is released?
---
Other than personal pride obviously.
---
So you haven't even cleared all the raids before and your goal is to get the rarest item in the game?
---
I guess anything is possible...
---
I can pretty much guarantee you that there won't be, and if there ever is, then it'll be well after Nax releases
---
They sleep a lot, yes, but its not in handy chunks- it can be a just a couple of hours between feeds or less. That's ok for questing/grinding/farming but my worry is that they will wake up and need attention just before the final boss of a dungeon... 
---
/equip [Noise cancelling headphones of parenting]
---
(Obviously this is terrible advice. Don't do this.)
---
I remember when I was in BFD and some green mail shoulders dropped and our tank rolled greed and lost. I got the shoulders, examined our tank's gear and realized that even with not excellent tanking stats (they had +2 Stam and like +1 Agility or something I think they were Of the Eagle or something), they would still be a significant upgrade from his level 16 gray mail shit. I gave them to him free without him asking, even though I could have probably sold them on the AH for a decent chunk of change.
---
#goals
---
gotta have 'em
---
lmao yeah thats it, project x
---
I totally agree that xrealm anything is negative for wow. The problem is, it wasn't 30 minute queues. I experienced this, I would regularly wait 1 and a half to 2 hours for one BG to pop. There's no point in having tight knit server community BGs if you never get to play them. This is why I think the best solution is to either have a larger server pop (which arguably also kills the small town feel of a server) or small battle groups that are made of other servers that have opposite faction imbalances.
---
Pro:  More people, shorter queues.
---
Con: These are all strangers.
---
These are really the only arguments about XRBGs.  There's not anything to really discuss.
---
Zygor never had a vanilla guide, his first guide was in 2.0.1.
---
However, you’re proposing solutions to problems that haven’t appeared yet.
---
You should get riposte as soon as possible if you want riposte. There really aren’t other talents in the combat tree that are definitely worth rushing for leveling purposes.
---
Funny thing about vanilla: even though it's been out for so long, most optimal is still not agreed upon.
---
I personally rush riposte unless I'm going to level with someone. It allows for more survivability, and gives dps increases with parry haste, as well as the 10 energy extra attack on parry.
---
So you are worried about competition?
---
Put in more effort than your competition and the officers will take notice when deciding loot.
---
Lol who knows ... I used to make macros for bosses/raids so that's probably what it is
---
Love it! It feels so fulfilling to finally get a cool looking piece after looking like a total noob for weeks/months :P
---
Essentially, yes.
---
How do we find a solution? I think both people actually agree with each other. What they can do is work together to think of a solution. The problem with no xrealm is sometimes you can have 2 hour queues. This means the average person is doing 1 or 2 BGs a day. Xrealm is a wide topic though. Is it xrealm across all realms? Or maybe just xrealm for small servers with faction imbalances.
---
I think this is more likely than July 16
---
Only ever keybound the number keys back in Vanilla. I was aware of keybinds and that it would be easier to use and considered it several times, but I never got around to doing it. It was just something I got used to. Eventually 1 day on pservers, a day ive long since forgotten, I raged a bit at my slow reaction speed during a fight and bound the other keys around WASD. RIP x for sit and z for unsheathe weapon...
---
I'm with you in this one. Summer is when I can rake in overtime, if it doesn't come until October I would be fine.
---
Find a guild, prove yourself, and give everything for the damage meters. Everything.
---
[Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkAe6pg0UJo).
---
Don't get me wrong, I understand very well how hard it is to keep aggro and aggro is not the issue I have experienced in my runs. It's honestly times when tanks wipes the group with an overpull, make us run back in again, does the same pull again and gets called out and told on how to do it where he simply just leaves the group.
---
Yes, many times DPS would be the issue and they overaggro, but when a DPS gets called out they don't tend to leave cause they understand the effort it takes to fill a group for a dungeon and will just suck it up, it's annoying for everyone when they die to stupid stuff like that. Them getting kicked is 99% of the times going to force them to run the dungeon from the beginning again which is a huge  timesink they will have to invest in finding a group and running to the dungeon again.
---
A recent example is in Uldaman, where the big troggs enrage when they get below 50%. Twice, the tank decided to charge in into three of those mobs, twice he just flopped the moment one of them enraged cause it was simply impossible for the healer to keep him up.
---
Another tank that we got in after the first tank got called out and left did the same thing, wiped us once, left with calling the healer shit.
---
It gets annoying at some point to deal with tanks in Vanilla cause you kinda have to walk on eggshells with them, one wrong word and they're gone cause they know they can easily find a group.
---
u should drop the other noobs and pick up 32 more warlocks
---
Agreed! I miss those days
---
History will repeat itself. Just as it did in vanilla, just as it has on many private servers, it most likely will in classic. It's good to have these conversations so we can formulate a consensus on what the player base thinks is the best solution and hope Blizzard can adopt it.
---
Just started watching him, didn’t know he had so much hate!
---
Haha hell yeah!
---
I know people laugh at gatherers selling mats on the market, but that was the soul reason i was able to afford my mount and skill at level 40 on a private server. Ofcourse that could be totally different in Classic Retail, but i will try until i find out otherwise.
---
The only reason I would avoid a major streamers' server is to avoid the inevitable population decline when the streamer moves on. There will already be a pop decline after launch as there is with all games, but if a streamer leaves a server it will be even worse.
---
I don't feel strongly either way but for people asking for reasons why this is a negative:  
---
it ruins the community feeling of bgs. Without xrealm, you are likely to start to see the same faces and make some natural buddies and rivals. I remember I had a rival nelf hunter that I always got excited to see in the loadout. We would also run across each other while leveling in game. It just took the rivalry to a new level.   
---
When xrealm hit, that did not happen anymore. You might see a name you recognize from a previous game that night, but not like before.  
---
Community over convenience is the whole reason I am going back to classic.
---

Get this book if it's not already in your collection. Baby goes to sleep around 630-7 sleeps til 7 or 8 the next AM? = quality WoW hours at night. The book is a  life saver!
---
It's not a problem that needs solving.  Blizzard is going to do whatever they want, just like when they picked a version of AV to use.  Some people will be happy, some people won't.
---
I like it. I think it makes everyone look unique and adds to the character of the game. The uniqueness makes the game more immersive.
---
I seriously hope so, I'm playing right now on a private server with 4000 people online and I've just done a /who basin and /who gulch and both came back with 0 people. There's one AV in progress but no other PVP in any bracket. Cross realm BGs were an important improvement to Vanilla.
---
Unless you are the guild leader, do make your plans around getting any of the legendaries...
---
I managed to be able to kite back then, but I made it more difficult than it had to be because I only bound the number bar. So I had to awkwardly reach over to 6 for Arcane Shot and 8 for Distracting Shot as I pivoted and jump shot.
---
Go push your brain!
---
As a rogue. I will be sure to remind you over and over. That you are not a real dps and are basically human garbage for not being on the approved dps list. So help me god if you ever get a useful piece of loot over me. I will tantrum so hard. You have no idea how hard. It will be hard though. I can assure you of that. The tantrum I mean.
---
At least after you leave Deathknell you can do a lot of quests in a circle back to Brill, really easy and you can complete a lot of quests in one go. I find that quite comfortable. Durotar is so annoying in how it sends you back and forth between the villages, and I can't figure out a good way to do it. After you finish the initial quests from Brill it may get more complicated though. Only done Tirisfal a handful times because I really dislike Undead and dislike the aesthetics
---
All this video really did for was remind me how good "Beat It" is.
---
Sounds good to me.
---
Personally, I've always hoped Classic will eventually go the Old School Runescape route. Not counting on it, mind, anymore than I'm counting on Classic launching on June 21st, but that's the dream.
---
The expectation is it'll keep my attention and provide me with quality entertainment until Pantheon finally launches sometime after 2021.
---
We'll see which one wins out.
---
I'm tired.
---
The answer is the thing you dismissed. Practice, just like with a martial art the more you play a video game. The more your muscle memory automates your behavior. The reason they are able to adapt so readily to new situations. Is because they need waste 0 processing power on old ones. 
---
It's as simple as that.
---
The hungering cold
---
Is this a reference to 28 Days Later by chance?
---
Perhaps your Vanilla server was different but Trollbane-EU had horrible BG queues and now that I have IRL responsibilities I sure as hell don't want to waste what little time I have in Classic just stuck in a BG queue that never pops. Cross realm BGs saved vanilla PVP.
---
Unless you have a premade to carry you through content, yes. Any pug will laugh you out.
---
Artorius... like... of the abyss? Is there a dark souls crossover patch? If so I’m resubbing so fast I’ll forget to breathe.
---
Healed my way through AQ40 and a bit of Naxx as Ret/reckoning lol.
---
Putting a soulstone on a resser, then running through a bunch of mobs in to a safe spot, then having them use the ss and res everyone.
---
2 hour long BG queues are definitely a problem that needs solving, and if there isn't an identifiable consensus in the classic community, odds are higher that Blizzard will pick something most will not agree with. Just look at their original idea to fight classic pservers. They wanted "pristine" servers, which are just retail without heirloom and xrealm, but that didn't happen because the community fought it. It is always better to have these discussions in the forums, hash out the pros and cons, find the best solution, and let that enter the mainstream of the classic fan base. That's why we're getting classic in the first place, because people discussed it in forums for years, and some people went as far to recreate it on a pserver.   
---
It is never better to not discuss something because they disagree. This is why politics is so divided. People don't want to talk to each other when they disagree, and it's always better to do so.
---
I was told that anyone who clicked was awful at PvP, so I thought maybe I should stop clicking cause I suck.
---
I would rather have a ret pally in my raid than a person like you
---
most guilds didn't have a voice chat, or there was very few people who had a mic
---
perhaps I should have added /s
---
Yikes.
---
You're in luck! They've already given us a ballpark estimate!
---
It's summer.
---
It is gear that is equivalent to the best drops from AQ available before BWL is even released. As I said it doesn't matter if only 1 person had the gear or almost the entire server has it, it goes completely against the idea of progressive content release. 
---
Also you are completely underestimating how common r12-13 gear is. Most raiding guilds have at least a handful of players that have this gear.
---
This is the kind of answer I was looking for. Someone who has empirical evidence that this is the one area where lack of xrealm hurts the game. It's not just that BG queues are long, its that BGs don't happen.  
---
This is why this conversation needs to be had. If we're going to get xrealm BGs, we need a solution that keeps server communities as tight as possible.
---
Hey man I plan on smacking stuff around with my staff...you never know what happens when you go OOM...or forget you have a wand.
---
didnt know people hate him, and after your post, I hate him even more. Thanks
---
Yeah, there are a grand total of 7 spawns in the entire area. It will take at least 20 minutes to do this quest alone. And since you won't be alone you'll end up doing skipping it instead.

---
Canada is in the Americas. Also europe doesn't use the same dates as America. In fact not all European countries use the same dates. 
---
Its almost like using seasons to announce dates for a global game is a stupid idea.
---
The issue is, as someone stated on here earlier, if the faction imbalance is big enough BGs sometimes don't happen. In that case we need a solution that keeps server communities tight. Bigger servers? This arguably kills the small town feeling. Maybe xrealm bgs among smaller servers or servers with major faction balance issues? It's just important that we discuss and find a solution on the forums that we agree upon, otherwise Blizzard might fix the future issue with full blanket xrealm bgs.
---
That will happen alot.. Don't sweat make sure you skill on the weapon you are using is up to snuff like if you changed from sword to axe it will happen. Also when you are fighting higher teir mobs you'll miss hit less or have them resist spells so ideally you want to try and fight same level or lower level. 
---
Me i assume i have big balls and try to fight 1-3 levels above and die all the time
---
Are you really a Warlock if you give two shits about a damn demon?
---
if the xp rates are fucked you cant really make a guide untill beta unless you include extra quests every couple levels
---
I wouldn’t call the anecdotal experience of one player on one private server “empirical”.
---
Unless you are gonna level insanely fast I think you should wait to sell the stuff till your near 40. By then the hardcore will be far enough ahead the prices will have gone up as they will have their mounts and will be swapping professions.  The mats will have risen some and this could help you get your mount gold. Having that mount ASAP will feel way better than not.
---
no tables in classic

Isn't that crappy legion lore ?

You're precious comments seem to indicate you have a very unfulfilling life. Good luck brother lol
---
It adds up. Everyone who has commented so far with experience is saying the same thing, the queues are too horrible. This all adds to mean that chances are, this is the likely fate of classic.

Mad season is the best

My old job required 6 weeks notice for a **single** requested day off. With my new job, best I can get is a shorter day. I do have consistent 3 day weekend's though, so there's that.
---
Ret pally is my favorite class. Played them since forever. From vanilla through wotlk. My favorite quote was "lol ret" and them ignoring me. Good times.
---
With all seriousness, prove yourself, get friends, and you'll be able to level up and do dungeons. Same for raids. It'll be hard but it's not like a 40 man raid won't be able to have you tag along.
---
&gt; There really aren’t other talents in the combat tree that are definitely worth rushing for leveling purposes.
---
The question for pure efficiency is: parry% or hit%? I agree to rush for riposte if you're going for it, but for 100% efficiency it's not clear which is better.
---
I mean the only opposing argument is an imaginary and intangible concept of "community" coming from people who think 2005 and 2019 are the same year.

I remember how many damn hours it took to install this. You sat forever waiting to insert the next CD.
---
Purple Drank make you strong
---
You can't prep for the Classic launch. All the best laid plans are all going to go to shit once people login and realize there's a ton of people all fighting for the same mob. You plan on clearing out Northshire and Elwynn quests in the first 3 hours? Good luck doing that with packed launch servers.
---
I even have no idea what exactly I'm going to do at launch, questing would be ideal but I don't even know if grinding will be viable...
---
Well said Poopfacemcduck!
---
You can build in "Grind till level X" steps to normalize/check your progress every so often. This is what is in the old Zygor guides from TBC, if you were underlevelled for the next questing step it would add a step for grinding. You can do that in a straight text website too, just have the last step in a group of quests be "Be X level before this point" so you can pick up the next quests.
---
Me and a friend have quoted this guy to eachother for years.  His weird broken voice is funny to impersonate
---
Tell me... Tell me everything!
---
I didn't make an argument, one way or another. I was simply commenting on the difference between anecdotal evidence and empirical evidence.
---
It may be anecdotal but this is exactly what I remember from Vanilla - terrible, terrible BG queues. The fact I'm sat right now on the biggest private server with more than double the players we had in Vanilla makes me feel this is a problem that hasn't fixed itself over time. Without cross realm BGs there is no PVP scene for casuals.
---
My lvl30-39 queue still hasn't popped, but I was just ganked by a 60 gnome rogue flying on the zeppelin from UC to Org, so I guess I've had some PVP tonight.
---
Download a repack and 2 box on your own private server, that's where I'm doing all my own testing/preparing :) With a tabard of lordaeron (a tabard that is +999 all stats and gives you a 10 minute buff increasing damage done by +500 and gives you +150% run/walk speed) I can do my 1-55 run in under 24 hours.
---
if you plan on going warrior, prepare for hell. It will be extremely worth it but it will hurt, unless you play with friends.
---
You will miss a lot of attacks that will cost your rage and your toons life. Corpse running a lot. Do try to level with a friend.
---
Mine did at the time, and it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.
---
Not everything is a problem.  Not every problem has a solution.  Hardly any problems have a solution that everyone will agree on.  Convincing people that your opinion is better than theirs is usually a waste of time and energy.
---
holy shit, good stuff
---
Because they don’t have anything on dwarves :)
---
the higher the level of the mob compared to your level, the more you'll miss and glance blow (reduced damage).
---
for a warrior its a good idea not to rush to higher level mobs and trying to hit mobs of your level or lower. 
---
if mob even one level higher than your level, its very impactful on the damage.
---
weapon skill level is important but it will always drag behind while leveling. so ya.
---
in general pay the most attention to the mobs levels. 
---
One of the reasons i made [maps like that](https://imgur.com/a/hg6VI) (warning a ton of traffic).
---
In all seriousness... For those of us who are married with kids now, make sure you don't neglect them with this release. Communicate with your loved ones and keep your priorities in check. You get what I mean.
---
Just remember classic WoW isnt going anywhere anytime soon and thats its okay to be a dirty casual.
---
If you don't plan on going hard in Naxx, then gear as like you. I Played Vanilla and most classes wanted class gear - not BiS. (e.g. no pally's in dresses) We struggled, but we prevailed as well. 
---
I can guarantee you getting Ele raid gear will be EASIEST by playing a resto spot...its the same for ret, feral, etc.

So edgy!
---
dude, check your mail already.
---
I enjoy arguing and pointing out people's delusions. For example, you are too stupid to provide any valuable input about the game so you went directly to adhoming me. You going through my post history says more about you than about me.
---
For the future don't comment on topics you are clearly too stupid to understand, saves you from looking like an idiot.
---
Fantastic writing that made me laugh out loud, I feel you would enjoy a book called Awkward situations for men by Danny Wallace similar writing style and humour
---
OK thanks! This is what I've been doing I just wasn't sure if it was optimal or not. I shall continue and practice my skills. Thank you!
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
I would click to give my other hand a rest from mashing the same button. Or when smoking,eating,drinking, etc. 
---
But other than that I was the same as you. 1-5 slowly adding more as time went on.
---
I say you should probably try to save your mats for professions. For example. I will play warlock, and plan to craft my lesser magic wand at early levels, and my greater magic wand right around level 20. I do this because i plan to level without doing dungeons unnecessarily. Next wand after that will be a wand from a vendor at level 26 or so. 
---
Also since i am a Warlock, i will craft the shadoweave set around 40-50. But that requires a tailoring level of at least 225. Thus i will need to craft a lot of tailoring whites and greens. The whites i sell to vendors, and the greens i disenchant for enchanting levels. I will have to fill my bank and bags with as many mats as possible to get everything crafted, as well as making a bank alt to store items if the bank is full. I will sell things like ores and mats that i won't need to the ah of course. But anything that goes to my professions will be saved.
---
If you use professions that your class benefits from, money won't be an issue until level 60 when it is time to farm a lot anyway.
---
Depends on the class. If you have a bush you would barely want additional one to have a crazy diminishing duration. But yeah, when you are rolling a horde rogue you would probably fell frustrated about not rolling an orc or an undead no matter what you choose because both choices are solid, but it also depends on your approach. When you appreciate stable tools that you always sure would work - having WotF usually the best choice and you won't even consider being an orc because it's RNG and it "never works when you need it". But if you like more occasional RNG wins that screw opponent pretty hard - orc is better here.
---
Too pretentious, didn't read. Good luck with finding happiness in your life ☺️

---
So much FUD in this thread but it's only making me more excited
---
playing classic counts as vacation things
---
Me? Right you are Ken.
---
Yes, not everything is a problem. 2 hour queues are a big problem.   
---
&gt; Not every problem has a solution 
---
Could you imagine if we took this approach to all problems in life. Eh, the moon's too hard to get to, there's probably no solution. Ah figuring out flying machines is too hard, it's probably impossible. When we work hard enough we always find a solution. If we haven't, we just haven't solved it yet.   
---
Yes, not everyone will agree on the solution. We can however, have discourse and find a solution that the majority finds to be the best. A balance between community servers and not having 2 hour queues. The answer is there, we just have to TALK ABOUT IT.   
---
It's not about 2 people placing a stick in the mud and trying to convince the other they're wrong no matter what. It is actually possible to have a conversation that ends in two people changing their minds for the sake of greater good for the game. I know it doesn't happen on reddit a lot, but it does. That's how a true argument is supposed to work. It's not about fighting each other, its about working together to find the best solution. Society gets nowhere when we give up on talking to each other to solve problems.
---
Transmog is one of the only things that has an ounce of fun in retail. Of all things to talk down upon I think thats one of the weakest. Unlocking PvP enchants and cloaks and having it be shown as a testament to your skill at that moment of time is one of the most rewarding aspects WoW has to offer in its current state.
---
If you want to raid as a shaman you'll want BiS.  You will be useless after a couple minutes from being oom from weak heals and no mp5 if you're not in some cloth.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=22409
---
Can someone enlighten me on Retribution and even Enhancement's appeal? I've never played either of them in vanilla and assumed it's been an auto attack playstyle.
---
Why? We had xrbgs in 1.12, I'm expecting it in 1.13.
---
It all depends on what your goal is.  If you're trying to be in the top 5 or 10% of the server to 60, then yes.  It's a waste of time to farm instances beyond completing all or most of the quests.
---
For me, I know I will not be the first, or even the tenth to 60.   But I will be 60 in under 6 days played.  I typically run the instance once for quests.  If I'm unable to get all the quests done, depending on the rewards I'll drop them.
---
Running the instances for quests allows you to avoid grinding (which most leveling guides require) and allows you to have some fun in between 8 hour questing sessions in the barrens.
---
"Too pretentious" says the person psychoanalyzing me based on comments about a video game. Get a grip you fucking child
---
For guilds who remember that WoW was supposed to be “the casual MMO” and that all the encounters can be beaten without world buffs and consumables, you’ll be accepted.
---
There’s going to be tons of 25+ year olds who will just be lucky to find 40 players online at once. Until they start raiding AQ40, they’re going to be like Nissan car salesmen: if you have a pulse, you are approved.
---
Arent you one of the people on the forums wanting battlegrounds at launch which is like completely the opposite of how vanilla launched.
---
If you wanna tank then warrior hands down. If you wanna DPS eh flip a coin. 
---
PVP wise whatever playstyle suits you best. MS is boss but our prep rogue single handedly won us many BGs. Play whatever you think you’ll be better at because that’s what gets you included in PVP.
---
Anyone remember that paladin lasthope who was last one alive in onyxia. Good Times.
---
Sorta, Honor System on launch and BGs phase 2.

Never understood the love for the barrens.
---
Elwyn forrest for instance has so much more character.
---
To me this one makes a ton of sense. Seems like everyone on here is so caught up in the #nochange and the nostalgia that they refuse to think about the fact that the population could be a real problem and to remember that it sucks to not be able to effectively play parts of the game because of your spec.
---
Get arcane intellect from mages.
---
Thanks! Serious answer I'm on a budget (hence reusing this old desk) I bought this off amazon for 60. Furmax office chair. It doesn't lean forward so if you need that kind of support without a pillow behind you, upgrade to something more adjustable. It's fine though.
---
I hope so. I think it will depend on Classic's success as they would need to hire another marketing person to run that, unless their current one can stay up to date with both. 
---
As for website, I'm not so sure about that one, especially with how uninvolved the website has become. I remember visiting the website all the time Vanilla - WOTLK, but then mid way through Cata I basically stopped.
---
Unless they bring back screenshot of the day, and whatever other cool stuff their website had back in the day then I don't think they'd put much effort into it.
---
Ehh unlike 15 years ago I'm concious about my sodium intake
---
I can't help but read the Humans lines in the thickest dirtiest worst stereotypical American attempt at an Australian accent and i love it.
---
Oh I definitely agree that transmog is fun and allows players to create unique outfits (especially now that most armor looks identical).
---
But personally I'm just excited to go back to simpler times when the armor that you get is what you have to "wear" until you get something better. It just feels more rewarding when you finally get some good looking gear and you can tell how strong someone is just by looking at them, just my opinion.
---
Your other thread asked for battlegrounds at launch because people expected it to be there.
---
This would be nothing like vanilla and kill wpvp.
---
Their pvp phasing was one of the most praised things on this subreddit.
---
I hope not. I want to see more WPvP and faster queues discourage it. Not to mention the win trading, multiboxing cross-realm rank fests by players.
---
No thanks. It killed PvP.
---
also, you can join this reddits discord https://discord.gg/erjzww and ask more direct questions to other warriors

I really like the generic ibuypower mouse I got with my purchase years ago.. I actually want a backup mouse and would appreciate it if you know where to find em.
---
I dont understand.  Do you think I am the one advocating for min/max?  Im saying running instances is fun and especially when we're talking about raging berserker helm and SM is such a neat instance to me due to all of the books in there, and the herod fight/post fight.
---
Im all about playing for fun.  I wont be in BWL in the first month, not the first three months or probably even six.  I play casually and at friends' paces.

Hi, /u/Asgarri
---
It's an awful miserable experience, don't do it.
---
*proceeds to roll alliance lock for easy raid spots*
---
We are currently internally voting on which days best suit people, unfortunately that means I can't confirm anything at this time.
---
I don’t care very much for BiS, especially pre-raid. I don’t think it is a reasonable use of my time to farm a specific drop or money for some random BoE (which will have inflated price due to being ”BiS”). Depending on class and item slot there is often an alternative or two you can get without much of a difference.
---
Also there seems to be some discussion on which items  that actually is BiS in some cases.
---
When everyone looks badass nobody looks badass. Also being able to gauge an opponents strength by identifying what gear they are wearing is much better IMO.
---
Oh. Wow awesome! Thanks man
---
SM =  Sado-Masochism
---
Probably 80%+ of /whooosh is just people not knowing that Poe's Law exists.

---
You wanna pick people off, slow down FCs and stealth around. Or do you want to be the Frontline brute striking people mortally and hoping to god the priest remembers to dispell the root effect on you.
---
As far as PvE goes, warrior is better then you at everything, if the group has a healer.
---
i think he just wanted to try and put someone else down, not actually provide anything.
---
How do you get faster queues on a horribly imbalanced server though? Many people have commented on here saying they experienced vanilla wow before xrealm bgs and waited hours for a single q pop. I myself experienced it.
---
Game development isn't a specific enough science that they'd have a specific date picked out that early in advance as fun as the conspiracy theory is....
---
You're good at this.
---
Definitely a reason to take engineering. Getting your sunglasses at level 15ish.
---
There will be a separate armory, already has a separate forum. Not sure what else you would want. They don't really have any community driven content on any of the websites anymore. Just the little window on the battle.net launcher.
---
When I learned you can change hotkeys to use shift and ctrl.
---
Couldn't agree more!
---
Yea I agree on that. There isn't too much armor in comparison to whats in the game now. So transmog just became a necessary evil as time continued. Classic tho? Its absolutely great. Seeing people slowly get stronger in recognizable armor is just fun.
---
I can still hear him saying that and how creepy it sounded... funny just thinking the voice actor who got paid to say these lines
---
There will be.
---
Killed that motherfucker a couple times just the knuckles. Was it the best possible gear for my warrior? Certainly not but that didn't stop me from wanting to dual-fist beat the shit out of things.
---
I still click but have thought about switching to keybinds when classic releases. I've never found it to be something that has held me back or hindered my gameplay. I clicked my way from the end of vanilla to mid-way through WoD when I quit.
---
I remember hearing about this on Count down to Classic. 
---
Amazing to see it here!
---
Time to roll the dice.
---
They don't stack with Aspect of the Wild, which you're using on your Hunters anyways.
---
guess any class is ok for casualing, most of us are going to casual vanilla too.
---
Rogue is more than fine and I don't think you really need to respec between raids and pvp if you don't want to min/max
---
You can do that still tho. Its not like you can't transmog into the mythic or elite set you just unlocked. It just gives people more personality in mix and matching sets to look good. The only "downside" to transmog is that it makes the average casual look like anyone they want if they bother to farm old gear from past expansions. But really I think it justifies the nostalgic feeling people have from old expansions and that shouldn't be talked down upon on the most nostalgic subreddit I've seen. 
---
Even though people have the capability of looking the same, people seldom do. Thats what makes transmog really cool.
---
Triggered.  RIP millennials.
---
Thicc
---
You’re also making a vast assumption. Both stances require speculation. No changes is safer.
---
&gt; We can however, have discourse and find a solution that the majority finds to be the best.
---
We don't need to.  You think it's important, but that doesn't mean it actually is. 
---
&gt; A balance between community servers and not having 2 hour queues.
---
If the population doesn't support it, there is no balance.  You will either have long queues, or you'll have cross realm BGs.  You wanting that isn't going to make someone who doesn't happy.
---
&gt;  The answer is there, we just have to TALK ABOUT IT.
---
You wanting to be right doesn't make you right, no matter how much you talk about it.
---
Unless you're grinding xp there's simply not enough exp there. It's objectively faster to do the way listed.
---
You're mistaken.  [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/honor-system-should-be-released-in-phase-1/145650/207](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/honor-system-should-be-released-in-phase-1/145650/207) 
---
Just as I said
---
DIRGE
---
As a druid with only like 3 spells, I never felt the need to keybind beyond the default set.
---
So you think having 2 hour queues isn't important? Or Blizzard putting blanket xrealm bgs in isn't important? 
---
I'm very willing to change my mind, but as of now I see no xrealm bgs as bad and I see blanket xrealm as being bad. Therefore, I currently believe that having xrealm bgs limited to heavily imbalanced servers is the solution. If you can present evidence that says otherwise, I will change my mind.
---
Again, it's important that we tell Blizzard what we want instead of letting them decide, because they have a track record of making bad decisions.
---
Gotcha. So Tauren warrior would be a good choice? Best against casters?
---
I'll rip the secrets from your flesh!
---
Depending on your race the axe would most definitely be worth it for orcs. Where as the one you mentioned is good all round and awesome for humans, it varies depending on a lot of other things
---
I think you bring up a lot of valid points. I don’t think Blizz entirely knows what’s gonna happen. Personally, I think they should keep it as is for now. But they should be prepared for a Phase 2.5 with just WSG if things get too out of hand too quickly. I think phase length will dictate a lot of those and until we have that info, it’s tough to say what is and isn’t the right choice. Good post.
