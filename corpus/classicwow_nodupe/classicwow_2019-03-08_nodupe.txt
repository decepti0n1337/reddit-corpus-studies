Exactly, explained much better 
---
---
---
Possibly in a beta test or something of the sort, but not at all on live. As someone else stated, WoW was considered casual in the MMO market due to the fact that death was not really a problem outside of a short run. This is echoed in The WoW Diary by John Staats.
---
The rare mob/boss spawn. Bannock I think.
---

---
Hes actually soloable as a rogue and you wont have to pull ads with him.
---
There is a video from vanilla days of a guy doing it. I tried it on pservers and it worked. Hes at the drop right before you clear to the spider boss
---
Thanks man. Not going to run DM in classic. Im with the 'Cleef
---
Oh right the joys of waiting around for 39 other people. Have fun mate. 
---
Personally I love Tauren Druid. That has always been my Horde “main”...Jack of all trades and all that. If you have a buddy that plays rogue then it pairs well for all kinds of PVE and/or PVP fun too.
---
Hey! Interesting topic that I myself have thought about, but let me give you my opinion on why I perceive this more good than bad. 
---
So as much as I would love for Classic WoW to succeed far more than retail and pull in big numbers, there are some risks to go along with that.  Rather than the Classic community being small and vocal on keeping the principles the same, I can see a lot of the players with a retail mindset/background start to complain about wanting to add little QoL changes here and there.  In addition, retail is exactly a product of what the players wanted (fly mounts, LFG, LFR etc.) and we have seen what turned from it.  Adding more players to the Classic WoW game would possibly threaten the projects authenticity and it’s true purpose of being created.  
---
I think keeping Classic exactly what they said, a “passion project”, keeps those that truly want to contribute to the world and play that style of MMO, in the game.  It comes down to a situation where you have to decide between a bunch of players as a whole or a bunch of dedicated players who appreciate Classic for what it is, but with fewer servers.  Personally, I would rather be on a server with steady population of players that appreciate the game for what it is.  Also, keeping the advertisement of the game on the down low, keeps the interest from investors and activision trying to profit off of the project like they would on a bigger title (New WoW expansion, Overwatch), meaning Classic stands for what it is, which is a project meant to deliver an authentic Vanilla Experience. 
---
Just some of my thoughts, but I’m totally interested on hearing what others may input :)
---
That's a blood elf I think
---
Over a decade? So in wrath you were fighting for vanilla wow? Get out of here. 
---
That sounds like a lovely experience 
---
Sounds like a problem with community perception to me. I bet a raid filled with garbage specs could clear MC at the very least.
---
I think he maybe means that players were stealing xp by getting killing blows on mobs. So the xp for the mob would go to whoever got the killing blow instead of whoever tagged it first. 
---
Could be misinterpreting though
---
2nd mage. 5 mans with 2 mages are smooth and you bring 7-8 mages to raid. Can be tough waiting in line for gear with that many people but it's not as bad as rogue
---
swords are good for pvp but be prepared to just sit in the flag room 90% of the time in wsg or an anchor in AB
---
Go mage if you want to dps. Druid is forced to heal at 60
---
No.
---
I feel like this is a problem for most players now that I'm hearing from some different people. Luckily/unluckily we still have months to give it some thought..
---
Combat Swords is pretty dreadful in pvp. Any spec without Camouflage and Master of Deception is awful because you're deadslow in stealth and people can easily spot you.
---
Most rogues who want to raid and pvp at the same time go for a dagger pvp spec because it still does decent damage in pve.
---
But then rolling human would be kinda pointless then, right?
---
Deadmines!! Never heard about this weapon before ? 
---
Correct, which is why the best PVP race for alliance rogues is dwarf.  
---
Humar was 1.3, some pets were 1.2 and Broken Tooh/ZG Bat were 1.0. 1.3 isn’t half bad though. 
---
What about no?  
---
Ok, dwarves would probably work well in PvE too because of stoneform. I think I might roll that. Dwarves are unique too.
---
How long were you in the bathroom for?? 
---
That’s some classless stuff
---
I would’ve got my bat outta my car trunk and started going HAM on everyone’s Hard-drive 
---
Don’t fuck with the Horde 
---
Try again. Debuff wil’ say 30-40 secs but CC breaks after 10-15s max. Get a clue.
---
That's the: Void Goes in &gt; Use AoE Taunt &gt; Rain of fire 3 ticks &gt; Pull Aggro from Void &gt; Sack Void &gt; Rain of Fire on Self until mobs are dead version?
---
Then for when AoE Taunt isn't up, it's 1 tick to pull aggro, but 2 ticks will go off before needing to sack Void. 
---
You having issues with finding people to play with doesn't mean that the rest of us do.  
---
You should try retail, I hear they have a system implemented to ease that process.
---
I dig his voice man, I think he sounds like Randal Graves from Clerks 
---
I just imagined someone sapping you while you're leveling. But for an hour straight... no combat... 
---
Yeah Dwarf is the best option for dagger rogues. Stoneform is very undervalued. Being able to remove poison, bleeds and blind is huge for a vanilla Rogue. 
---
[Link](https://www.strawpoll.me/17557953) to his Strawpoll showing what class you're going to pick!
---
You need a lot of gear to be able to 1 shot people. So you have to rank to 14 to get any good gear because 90% of the guilds wont give raid gear to a enh shaman
---
I know this depends on server, but how difficult is to get accepted into groups or is it easier because youre not competing for same gear as like warriors
---
Casual plz
---
Gnomes are best for premade bg's
---
no shit?
---
make a vid of it?
---
Will need this info for later.
---
I legitimately had the same exact thought several months ago when I was thinking up names for a similar guild.
---
What about it? It's a social construct. I plan on being a gnome druid this time around. 
---
Depends. On the fence between Tailor/Chanter, or Herb/Alchy. Depends on if I play lock or druid or rogue I guess.
---
I really believe that the vast majority of guilds will be like this come the release of classic. There were plenty of us in vanilla and there will be plenty of us now. The hardcore raiding guilds who expect everything to be fully optimised and are going for world/server firsts are in the minority, to the point of being statistically insignificant.
---
It is what I will be doing on an Oceanic realm, and pretty much everyone I speak to will be going for this playstyle too - mainly because my circle is in a different stage of life now (jobs, kids, etc), however we are accepting of all ages and levels of commitment.
---
It took me about 5 months to hit level cap in vanilla and I expect it might take this long again - yes, my memories will allow me to level faster, but my time commitment will not be as strong so it will probably balance out and be around the same. I don't mind and I don't begrudge the people who are powerleveling - we'll meet eventually.
---
Our guild will also be a welcome place for those with social anxiety, depression, disabilities of any kind (we had people in vanilla who raided who were deaf, one-handed, etc). I want to provide the chance for everyone who loves classic to have a chance of enjoying the game to its fullest, with whatever playstyle they feel comfortable with. There's always a place for you.
---
 
---
Hahahaha. I got trolled once when I was young, about a decade ago. Kept on getting sapped for probably like 10 mins with a few steps between saps. I was googling how to stop hackers for the next few days cause I thought a mob was glitching, I was so confused. Poor little 10 year old me =(
---
I did play in retail vanilla. There were plenty of players who didn't click and backpedal, saying there weren't is ridiculous. The primary reason there are so few pvp recordings is because running fraps while pvping in 2005 crushed your fps. Unless you had rich parents I guess. People weren't magically retarded just because it was 2005. Less knowledgeable, sure. That has more to do with shitty specs, rotations and bad gear choices.
---
Is it 8% tho? The tooltip's just sayin "minor speed enhancement" 
---
Great story lol 
---
Onyxia was manipulating the nobles at the time, Edwin demanded larger sums than initially agreed upon.  Stormwind racked up massive debt throwing their army down to Stranglethorn and back. Edwin got mad about the debt and demanded more money again, caused the riots, razed Westfall, and generally was a giant piece of shit, and raised an even bigger piece of shit of a daughter. 
---
If ur serious about pvp, ull choose UD
---
Rogues are top tier DPS throughout all of vanilla. Any guild/raid will gladly take a rogue. A guild can actually never have enough rogues and warriors. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
As for gearing up, dagger rogues are very easy to gear up. Sword rogues have to compete with warriors and other rogues for the very few good swords in the game. There's more good daggers in the game and you're the only class one who can use them.
---
This is definitely doable. People used to do all Druid raids or only Paladin raids. Druids are serviceable raid tanks, Paladins not so much. Paladins can't keep up with threat at all. Retribution Paladins are fine though. Better in PvP than PvE but still DPS. Moonkins are fine, their aura is nice and they bring Innervate like all Druids so yay.
---
All the Rogue specs are viable, all Warrior specs too. Ele Shaman is pretty terrible, but whatever. Enh Sham is good, just has aggro issues and mana issues...you're basically an auto attacking totem dropper that hits Stormstrike. 
---
All Warrior specs are great. Affliction Warlock is meh because of debuff limit. Full Demo misses the two key damage talents for Locks in SM and Ruin, but it's utility with all the different pet bonuses and saccing is sweet.
---
Shadow Priest is all about mana conservation, and threat. A lot of SPs that raid on pservers don't use Vampiric Embrace so a lot of the flavor is gone from the class. The healing just isn't worth the massive threat. Shadow Weaving is nuts though. Disc Priests are fantastic and of course Holy.
---
Hunter...Survival is kind of a joke. It doesn't do anything on its own and is a real lame duck. It has neat support talents, but no definitive play style. The other two specs are wonderful. Mage is kind of stuck. Fire is just not possible in the MC BWL and Ony. The only Arcane spells are Missiles and Explosion. So unless you want to spam missiles instead of Frostbolt and sit half the fight OOM you're basically stuck using FB. With that said, Arcane Power / Frostbolt has potential!! An ZG AQ and Naxx you can safely go fire or Arcane /Fire.
---
TL;DR the only really outright terrible specs for RAIDING are Prot Pal, Survival Hunter, Ele Sham...and even then a Prot Pal could always off tank adds, and the Ele Sham could always beat other classes with consumables and skill...I guess. Survival Hunter is ass.
---
Swamp of Sorrows - I've always had a soft spot for the swamps and fens and marshes and mires. There is something special about the claustrophobic feeling, like that attic-rummage tingle in the belly, when I enter the swampy zones. 
---
Swamp of Sorrows had so much character, it was one of the zones that made vanilla feel like a world, and not just a zone in a computer game. The feeling of history, with Sunken Temple, the big turtle skeletons on the beach, the Lost Ones village - just a really atmospheric zone.
---
For me it is bettered by only a single zone in all of the expansions: Zangarmarsh.
---
Now this what I want to see more of, I'm rolling a human Ret pally myself. I can't wait to see mongoloid warriors rage when I out dps them
---
Sign me up man!
---
Hoping to find a horde version of this. I’ve been a enhancement shaman for so long and now want to experience the versatility/ utility of the Druid especially as a bear tank. 
---
I just feel like this mindset or mission statement for a guild would thrive as long as the members buy into the challenge and attitude. 
---
It would be a freaking blast. 
---
At first I thought the monotone was kinda funny but he quickly became my favorite content creator as well. I support him on Patreon where he releases his videos a week early, nice perk for fans.
---
ITT: People who have literally no idea what they are talking about and don't realize this is not possible in 1.12. 
---
This is not possible in 1.12. World PvP or Bg's already. 
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
Paladin:  blessing of salvation
---
Death and decay.
---
Auto install for me will be a dmg meter, vendor prices, map addon that shows where all quest items/drops are, CC/Dot tracker, enemy cast bars, proper character stats (see spell damage/spell crit etc in character screen) and auto buffer (selects correct rank buff for buffing lowbies) and probably some sort of bag addon that has a button to sell all greys. Also I like having an addon to keep track of enemy faction players so if they gank me i can add a note to get revenge later when i see them again.
---
*Laughs in pursuit of justice*

---
Its been known to be 8% for a while.
---
This sounds really great actually. I have a ton of experience in Vanilla just from the past 10 years of private servers alone. With my current situation I am married with a beautiful 1 year old and I just don't have the time to play like I used to. Obviously I will be active and hit 60 pretty quickly but this sounds like a great idea. As much fun as hardcore raiding guilds are it's just not practical with my current situation. Message me if you go through with this!
---
Tanaris.
---
I ... don't really know why. Partially because that's where I finally got my first trinket (Carrot on a Stick), partially because that's around the level that I actually respecced into a non-garbage "hybrid" build (points in all 3 trees and at least 1 in every single talent with no direction/point whatsoever), partially because that's where ZF was and ZF was (is) fucking awesome, and partially because that's where I got my first BOE being Hurricane which made me a shit ton of money.
---
If you want to live hold aggro. Holy priest
---
Vanilla CC had heartbeat chance to break, which basically meant on avg it lasted 8-10 seconds with a low chance of it being 3 seconds - 16 seconds and an extremely low chance of it being 1 second / 20 seconds. It also suffered from DR very similar to how it does in modern WoW. By and large the CC was very similar  to how it worked in TBC/WotlK just it had a 1/100 chance of either breaking early or lasting longer than expected.
---
Shaman: My totems bring all the raiders to the yard!
---
Being a healer is actually fun ^^^^\(totems)
---
Warrior is a fun way to go, especially with full rested, since it’s just your alt. Tanking dungeons, from Wailing Caverns to Strath and Scholo, is one of the most fun excercises in the game. 
---
I’m also going Mage, just to fund my real main, H Pally, but I also want to play pretty much every class except shaman and Druid.
---
Obviously with DR CC you dunce. 
---
What you think is fun only applies to you. If someone has more fun min-maxing then they are playing the game just the right way for them. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I'm shocked no one has pointed this out yet, but weapon skill (and thus human racial) has no effect in PvP. All calculations between players are done assuming max level weapon and defense skill.
---
While it is true that combat swords is bottom tier in PvP, it remains at least middle of the pack just by virtue of powerful baseline rogue skills.
---
If you wanted to be competitive in PvP, you are going to need to spec daggers, or hemo.
---
It's possible in 1.12. 
---
This is literally only a problem in super cutting edge guilds. These guilds still class and spec stack  to this very day. Most guilds won't have the luxury of stacking and will gladly take a competent dps specced (insert hybrid here)
---
Yeah that sounds more accurate. I thought there was at least one pet at 1.0 but couldn't remember for sure.
---
I don't know whether this was 8% in vanilla. The enchant tooltip just says "minor speed increase". 
---
It may well be 8% now and/or on private servers (I have never played on a private server), but I have in my head that the bonus from this enchant in Vanilla was smaller than 8%, I think it may have been 4% or perhaps 6%. 
---
Anyway, it should be easy to compare if you're on alliance; Paladin's Pursuit of Justice granted 8% run speed (and didn't stack with the boots enchant anyway). So you could just see whether a character with the enchanted boots runs the same speed, or slower than, a paladin with PoJ.

Im advocating for blizzard to do what other MMO companies have done with there games for years. Something they have resisted doing because "We dont want to go back and do it again" 
---
The hardest part of this whole venture was getting blizzard to do ANYTHING. To move one inch from the "We don't believe this is in the best interest of our players" or "You think you do, but you dont". FINALLY they have moved seeing how it has both worked for games like EQ and OSRS, more recently Anarchy Online. I am happy to get any movment from blizzard at this point, i fully believe that once this ball gets rolling they are going to be hard pressed to stop it from rolling through TBC and Wrath. The only question is how do we get there. Personally i want a clearly denoted Progression server. Other people want Server transfer or Expansions specific servers.
---
I am just happy they finally moved AT ALL.
---
 Buy my class, sir. 
---
great video, nice production value :D
---
I dunno. By the time I got to TBC I was all into BIS lists and chasing down items. I enjoyed the hell out of TBC anyway.
---
Deadmines got me too. Getting into the big open cavern and seeing the dreadnought ship blew my fuckin mind.
---
Red ridge.
---
Right on! The only reason I am against playing Warrior is because there are going to be so many warriors in classic. I realize that mages are very popular too, but mage is too nostalgic for me to not play it
---
If they do this they will literally chase away a bunch of the playerbase, the same way they did with retail 
---
I love it. I don't care for overly hyper and excited YouTubers. 
---
Strong in 1v1s maybe, but you are going to pretty much be OOM after that. So in a WPvP where it may be 10 or 20 enemies, you are going to end up being pretty useless and just auto attacking before the fight is over.
---
Maybe, especially if your mage is a tailor, you could roll Warlock? They’re insanely fun to level.
---
What is the technique for soloing Hydrospawn as a lock? Never done it, always stopped at lashers.
---
just ditch the girlfriend and play wow. You will save money and be happier in the long run.
---
40 druids? 
---
I'm surprised I didnt see anyone say westfall. That was my favorite zone and I even spent a lot of time there as a level 60 helping people with quests or protecting the town from other level 60s attacking it. Idk why I liked it so much, I think it's the first area where I had a lot of player interactivity and felt like a part of a community 
---
Jack of all trades, master of none.
---
You either win, or you run. 
---
- Druid 
---
Then you get to enjoy tanking Hyjal trash and being unviable for Illidan (woo!) 
---
You're wrong though, i know a bunch of people who do want hybrids to be doing equal dps to pures. I could be perfectly fine with burning crusade style balance, but to say no one wants hybrids equal to pures is a lie
---
Classic is a big deal. They will advertise it.   
---
It is a VERY big deal for people on the WoW team. Also, players know about it and a ton of people will play it.    
---
They just don't need to advertise it right now.    
---
People who think Classic is just a small project for Blizzard is wrong. It's not a major new game, but it's a big deal and will be used to bring players back to WoW.
---
As a healer, why would I want to join your guild when I could just join a normal guild and see more success? How do you expect to attract healers?
---
Wetlands and Hinterlands. So many memories are going to flood back.
---
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
---
You will never have to buff up, or buy water. 
---
If global BoE's added in later patches will be available in loot tables that were available in later patches regardless of what content state we are in.
---
I.e. relics dropping from any lvl 60 man instance that are not restricted by say AQ not being available.
---
Example, [Totem of the Storm](http://classicdb.ch/?item=23199) can drop in nearly any instance but wasn't available for players prior to some arbitrary late game patch, where the Classic client is based on 1.12.  This can be further speculated on general itemization and things like if [Black Lotus](http://classicdb.ch/?item=13468) will be BoE or BoP
---
I was actually considering that! Cause I do plan on doing Tailoring, I just don't know what my other profession should be to go with it. Do you have any experience with Warlocks? How do they typically do in World PvP/BGs?
---
And whose changes make it into the game? Guy 1 wants balance changes but no lfd or flying. Guy 2 wants lfd but not balance changes or flying. Guy 3 wants flying only. Either way people are mad.
---
My soul for your benefit. Warlock
---
You can play enhancement in pvp you ar ok 1v1 most matchups are a skill match. Totem timeing and propper use of shocks gives you a good chance against mele aswell as casters i personally fell enhancement is one of the best specs overall 1v1 you will have som problems whit warlocks and hunters but all other matches is winnable only big problem for enhancement is gearing so late game pvp will suffer alot
---
Gnomes are pretty clearly superior to dwarves imo.
---
Dwarf has one very high impact scenario: Rogues (Blind)
---
Gnome has many: Druids (Nature's Grasp), Mages (Nova, Frostbite), Warriors (Imp. Hamstring)
---
Killing a rogue in rogue v rogue w/o blind is very doable and you can pseudo-blind with half DR gouge into Magic Dust too.
---
Everyone seems to recount being amazed as they began to sense how huge the world (of warcraft) was, and the scope of the game. This was it for me too, I was in the night elf starting zone near Darnassus (or whatever it's called) on my young NE rogue and I was amazed at the sheer size of it all. This same rogue ended up with full T1, full T2, etc. Even reaching 60 took 15 days /played. You really had a feeling that you were stepping into something huge and in many ways I really was. I wouldn't be surprised if I put nearly 10000 hours into that game between Vanilla and TBC.
---
Leveling is pain bit every single guild or group loves you even if you do 50% of possible outcome
---
The whole point of any game is to have fun. I'm going to be playing probably on the more try-hard level, but casual guilds focused on fun and friendship are a great way to go!
---
I've always wanted to do a strat undead run with 1 or 2 pally tanks, 2 pally DPS and 1 pally healer 
---
You’ll do fine
---
I personally liked that cross realm battle groups greatly alleviated the wait times of twink brackets (i.e 29 and 39), and the wait time during off hours.
---
If battle groups make it in, I would prefer it to pull from the local server first, and then if needed pull from the server's battlegroup.
---
Mage is a golden child. You will be spoiled and the world is your oyster. You can be hard core or casual. You will be T1 at every level of play.
---
Druid read headed step child of classic wow. You will put out 300% of the effort of everyone else to get 90% of the result. Do not play unless the need is so deep in your soul. You can't see yourself being anything else. Druids know they are druids. The only way you could ever enjoy this class imo is if in your head. No other option was ever acceptable. Druids are a very unique kind of player.
---
Yeah no. Completely against osrs wow. Player voted changes would only lead to retail. How do you think we got ro retail as is? By blizzard listening to players
---
TMW Fury warrior wins Perdition's Blade FeelsBadMan
---
Or when they repeatedly made them vote on changes till the playerbase gave up and let jagex put in the equivalent of the wow token
---
STV'nam coast line, just north of Grom Gol.
---
Yea i only heard of classic wow last year due to watching blizzcon and it was on there. Totally shocked but also hyped to play it again. 
---
Blizzard need to do more for there advertising. I bet there is alot of people which dont no its coming back.
---
Why are healers somehow a different mindset in this equation? There are a lot of people who want to play in a guild based more around inclusion and fun and less around optimisation and progression. I am sure plenty of those people are also healers.
---
Guranteed they release the OG trailer on cable and get everyone hyped. 
---
Roll a hunter, level semi casual, farm semi casual and raid casually. You’ll be fine. 
---
Westfall and Elwynn. Also like Silverpine forest. "Its my farming spot for matts"
---
B.C. private servers fail because other issues then playerbase 
---
Ouro in AQ is what did it for my guild. You can outrun the spikes with the enchant but without it they will inevitably catch you.
---
Completely against player voted changes 
---
She's also had plastic surgery done, badly, but won't admit it and you're an asshole if you point it out. 
---
yeah that was definitely the plus side of the equation. I just missed recognizing players and the feeling of getting back at someone who got you previously, or downing the well known grand marshall mage on the other side kinda thing.
---
When X-realm happened everyone became nameless to me, i might as well be fighting npcs
---
Most peaceful voice out there 
---
Ony ever played one class. Did it from vanilla to wrath of the lich king. And that was Warlock. Guess what class i will be rolling again :)
---
Im not an alt bloke.
---
Warriors with windfury, alliance getting struck by lightning; PURGE.
---
If the enemies are dead, do you even have to heal?
---
Maybe a few. More likely you're just getting the bottom feeders for anyone playing a real spec. Tanks and healers get poached all of the time already. 
---
Ibthink I've narrowed it down to either warlock or resto shaman.  I've been dps my whole wow career, so I'm a bit anxious to be a healer.  My main fear/question involves raid awareness.
---
Healers how do you keep your raid awareness while staring at raid frames?
---
Prince Nazjak has to be up there
---
Why? So squeakers and manchildren can corpsecamp my level 20? No thanks, I have a life, I don't have time for autists.
---
X-realm is bad, I'm talking more about battle groups, specifically the Ruin Battle group.
---
While you didn't fight only just the opposite faction on your server, it also formed a lot of server rivalries, even with those on your own faction.
---
I'd love to see a grind test. Either of us may be correct 
---
One of my alts will be a DPS shaman, for the challenge. Vanilla is too easy using an optimal spec.
---
That sounds very interesting! And yeah I agree. I would love to spend time with people who also have a passion for the game!
---
I was 18, never touched the game when it came out(Fooling youngling I was) so I didn't play until Naxx was out.  
---
My introduction to the game is shrouded in mystery. I was attending my local community college, one of my classes had computers in it. I set next to a dude that whipped out a CD and popped it in. Back then most computer didn't have administrator locked, so he installed the game. After that he was able to log on and play this game. I can't say I wasn't drawn into it. Focusing hard on the teacher's lesson but not completely committed to it. I was entranced by it. He slipped me that 15 day free trial like the drug dealer who knew his clientele. I went home installed it, and 4 hours later I'm a level 5 dwarf Paladin in second settlement. He gave me 5 gold and I felt like a millionaire.   
---
Fast forward a week or two, the guy is gone. He's not showing up for class, No where on my friendlist, no one in class could remember his name or school email. He just **VANISHED**. So I'm now alone, in a world I'm still learning, on the PVP realm Cho'Gall. So after that I ended up rolling a dwarf hunter, mostly out of knowledge that I knew the quests. So as time passed I reach about level 24ish and go about meandering down to the Wetlands. Now at this point I had not interacted with the other faction, but this was the moment that had changed. Walking down the pass avoiding the Dragonmaw Orcs, I was abruptly stopped. I looked at my debuffs to see I'm Sapped. Hmm, I thought, that's odd. Before the debuff ended my pet fell over dead, and I proceeded to explode. Shock aside, I thought, maybe it was a glitch? Like an elite mob that didn't have it's texture load. I return to my corpse, respawn, and continue walking. No more than 5 steps, sapped, and exploded again. This went on for several more attempts leaving me to keep rezzing and dying, with no recourse. After that I rolled a human mage on a RP realm.
---
That aside, I cannot wait for Classic. Being able to start fresh with my girl(even though she's hyper accustom to current hunter) is going to be awesome even with the non vanilla perks they're "forced" to add. 
---
I hope you're right! :)
---
Yeah I agree. I hope they do more advertising or something that can also appeal to non-WoW players.
---
&gt; you only go troll if you absolutely cannot stand undead and absolutely love trolls. which of course would make you wrong, but plenty of people are wrong.
---
didn't know you could have wrong opinions hmm.
---
&gt;there is no world in which trolls are remotely a better race for mage than undead
---
except the raiding world
---
That's a pretty cynical view of people. The majority of players, from day one of vanilla to right now, are not hardcore raiders who read optimisation guides and farm pre-raid BiS gear. The people who do that might seem like a lot on forums but they are really very few in the big picture of population.
---
There are even some people who would be attracted to a guild like this for the extra challenge. In vanilla there were guilds who did not read strats after they came out because they wanted the challenge of figuring it out for themselves. Some people find personal achievement more satisfying.
---
Desolace for sure. Killing centaurs, pvping all the time, listening to TI, all that shit was super vanilla for me.
---
Isn't this template like a fucking year old
---
elwynn and westfall 
---
Hi, 
---
I'm sorry I didn't realise i'd upset someone by posting a year old template for a 15 year old game.
---
I hope you find what you're looking for.
---
There is no healer meme-spec.
---
I think that's stupid.
---
It's going to be amazing!  Not perfect in every way, but really fun with a ton of people playing it. Vanilla is so cool with all the different spells (imo).
---
Lapdogs, all of you!
---
The first four human zones were so fucking good. I think that the overall questing experience has gotten progressively better in WoW, but IMO that's still the best zone-to-zone storytelling they've ever done.
---
I could play alliance for the first time ever and get basically a fresh game, but I'm not that kind of person. I like dwarves and night elves though. 
---
I haven't played since the tbc release year. It was my first mmorpg ever diving in. I can hop on games like oblivion or morrowind and still feel immersed and relaxed and they're not even online sooo
---
The leveling from 1-20 is brutal though
---
I agree. I'm so excited for it, just counting the days for it to come sooner!
---
Indeed you just make a lvl 35alt that get alchemy and keep herbs on it then filling your main up with them.
---
I mail pots to another bank alt to manage that for raids and selling
---
I never tied my pet attack to spells. I like being able to mark things pre-pull and I like being very deliberate in choosing what my pet does, one of the things I hated about hunters in Vanilla was them treating the pet like it was dot that should always be applied rather than treating it like a pet and controlling it. I actually bound my pet attack to 1 and pet return to 2, lol. 
---
If you don’t want to visit this subreddit then I think you should stop visiting this subreddit.
---
Darkshore, especially Auberdine. Can't wait to visit it again! :)
---
For what it's worth, I've enjoyed a lot of your other memes. Just not this one for whatever reason.
---
elwynn forest/barrens
---
The OP specifically mentions meme-friendly and "doesn't have to be EXCLUSIVELY meme spec". Not everyone has to be sub-optimal.
---
I don't care if the template is old. It still made me laugh 😂
---
free food for life
---
Sign me up.
---
Even Shaman tanks?
---
Going the standard leveling spec for hunter, BM, is also the best pvp spec for hunter all the way until 60. Your pet becomes an elite mob that absolutely annihilates anyone if you get the jump on them, and will still win you the fight a lot of the time since you can use its stun to help peel off you. Honestly BM hunter is the strongest pvp class pre-60, so there's just no need to create another pvp spec. 
---
The only time I would say differently is if you were twinking a hunter at 19 or 29, in which case it'd be better to do something else.
---
I’m aware of exactly what OP said, as is evidenced by my own post. I literally said that there are no meme healer specs, and then asked why they would want to be part of it.
---
2 hours later...
---
I personally can't wait for C'thun to be unkillable for 1 month, just like he was in retail.
---
\#NOCHANGES!
---
[removed]
---
Bring honor to your clan and ancestors by playing an honorable dwarf warrior. 
---
&gt; Except they do have other options
---
The other options are always on one end of the spectrum, there is never a solid middle ground. No one wants to play on Nost's low pop realm where guilds are clearing Naxxramas, people are roaming the open world in T3 and there's 1k people online and you'll never find a guild to do the whole PvE progression with. It's just a waste of time trying to argue about this. If you actually think it's a good experience to play on a server like that I feel like you're just defending it because you're biased and don't want to give up your view. No one actually likes servers like that except the people who are in those 2 guilds that are clearing Naxxramas and even those guilds end up quitting the server, it's pointless to start a fresh character there.
---
&gt; It does affect vanilla somewhat as well, but its 10x worse in TBC
---
It would probably be worse in TBC but I still think it's terrible in vanilla, the world isn't made for 10k players (which is clear when you look at servers introducing dynamic respawns and such which often times don't even solve the problem and sometimes create completely new issues. If the world was designed for that many people none of these changes into the spawn systems would be needed in the first place). 
---
The reason why the changes are made into spawn systems is to make playing on the server even a little bit tolerable, and even then it becomes a mini game of sitting in 1 area trying to be the fastest to tag the mobs.
---
It doesn't feel like you're adventuring through a MMORPG, it feels like a mini game of going to a location and sitting still for hours spamming tab + insert instant cast spell here, and then doing it again and again and again because there's 20 people standing next to you and zero mobs in the world to kill.
---
&gt; Yeah, because they stream on high pop PvP servers
---
It has nothing to do with ganking or stream sniping. Some of these players don't stream that often and when they play the game they are the ones doing the killing. They've also played through multiple servers and the reason they don't like overpopulated mega servers is because to them it doesn't feel like vanilla at all, it has zero to do with stream sniping.
---
Your reasoning here is non factual, it's just something you decided in your head despite not knowing any of the players I'm talking about or their reasons for not liking certain things. I was afraid you would go this route as well, trying to make stuff up to shrug off different views as if they don't matter.
---
&gt; So just have both.
---
I don't mind if Blizzard releases some "fun" servers with custom rulesets for people to play on, as long as most of the servers are the regular vanilla ones and those are the "base line" servers for the game.
---
But it seems like you're trying to vouch for them doing these 10k cap mega servers as a default option at least according to your previous replies which is what I disagree on.
---
Spell hit on boots? wat
---
1 shadow priest is viable per raid, 2 is not. If you have that special Gene that makes you believe healing is less fun then DPS don't play priest.
---
Sounds fun and would be hilarious to see it succeed. All the smug 'ElitistJerks' types will be autistically enraged over it.
---
Man... great job. As a very experienced Hunter I have to say you really nailed it here. This is a fantastic guide for anyone considering playing a Hunter forsure. 
---
Very well done my friend. 
---
Great, funny video. Really enjoyed it. I'm a horde player but honestly humans are like my second favorite race to play. 
---
well for me, what i was marking was what i wanted my pet to tank for me. so it saved me a click. dis i occasionally change targets or vice versa? sure. but what i marked was where i wanted my pet to go, so it made sense.
---
You use a bow as your main weapon 
---
I would totally do this. I have always wanted to play ret pally but no raiding guild would take me unless I ran holy. I just don't like healing. 
---
I loved the video and had fun watching it but one thing that's wrong is Stormwind got their harbor during Wrath not Cata.
---
Grungi? Username checms out. 
---
&gt;didn't know you could have wrong opinions, interesting
---
now you know!
---
&gt;except the raiding world
---
fear break &gt; berserking even in pve
---
What do you have against dire maul?! 
---
;)
---
And that is if he even manage to find a guild to raid in druid dps... yeah go mage.
---
So if you know about DR why did you make your post?
---
If you have top end gear and are specced for pvp, any class can destroy people headed to Blackrock Mountain.
---
Loch Modan was my favorite Zone when I was playing Vanilla for the first time on Nostalrius. The trek through the mountains, the sound track, the great warrior items you get from the mini hub north of thelsamar, the Elven building hidden in the southeast high up on a hill, and of course the Dam. Coming from westfall-another great zone, Loch Modan is like a mix between a forest biome and a tundra biome. 
---
Every item in the game is prio to our class. Especially shields, maces and wands.
---
Because your subjective feels are wrong!
---
More seriously, it's probably because a warrior is always a melee class and a priest is always a ranged spell class.
---
Chain heal and invitations to every raid on the server
---
Is it going to be shared subs? 
---
I tanked a lot in Vanilla on my Shaman
---
it was very painful past level 45
---
Yes, and I'm glad. I don't want the exact Vanilla experience, I already had that. I'm very interested in seeing what a more informed playerbase is able to do in the Vanilla environment.
---
Anyone saying "the magic will be gone" hasn't given it much thought. Have you played a pserver? The magic is gone. You already know the map. You will never walk into Ironforge for the first time again. There are no more mysteries. This is going to be a different game.
---
\*Capital city filled with dps warriors\*
---
Survival hunter is good t2+. Need a ton of agility to make it a viable spec, once you’re in t3 it has more attack power than marks 
---
Pop my bubble and hearthstone out.
---
Warlock: Like a Mage and Hunter combo deal!
---
You're not going to do very well as a paladin without Blessing of Sanctuary or Holy Shield. I mean, you can do it, but people probably won't appreciate it. PvP Healadin should have Holy Shock.
---
It's not the gear that's the problem. It's the class/spec design.
---
Enjoyed the content, would love to see more! 
---
Bear Druid is pretty strong though. Seriously, they’re great.
---
See, this is the kind of lore I like. Not some world ending, demon sword-wielding-destroyer of Azeroth stabbing his giant ass sword into the planet, only to be dragged off by some other nigh-omnipotent beings. 
---
I care about the characterization and backstories. I care about the morally grey characters and the often overlooked story lines. We don't need Avenger-level plot lines in WoW to have an awe inspiring story. We need more stories like this. More story execution like this. Level 3-18 questing + Dead Mines &gt; the entirety of WoD-BfA storyline.
---
Agreed! The vibe of Duskwood is so perfect. The creepy hermit. Seeing Stitches obliterating low level players. Being next to high level and mysterious zone of Deadwind Pass. And having a strange mountain in the middle you can explore and discover a ?? Dragon. 
---
shadow priests didn't raid in Vanilla and if they did they were in a guild that could only finish MC and ZG.
---
Love shaman healing, hate druid healing. Personal preference though. That's the best thing about the game. Everybody can play what they love.
---
This is basically what Kevin Jordan said in the ClassiCast podcast. According to him Shaman tanking wasn't meant to be viable end game but it was something you *could* do up until around the 40's.
---
Sort of like how you could have a Hunter pet off tank certain stuff in 5 man dungeons, it's not optimal but it works if there's an emergency but having a real tank would obviously be better in any scenario.
---
He also said that the Warlock's Voidwalker pet was supposed to be a viable 5 man dungeon main tank but not viable for anything past a 5 man but obviously that didn't really happen because they're just as terrible as a Hunter pet.
---
A little life in his voice would be great but how do you give life to one which has none.
---
Nope, before DR.
---
Any guild that allows a fury warrior to have that when a dagger rogue needs it is trash.
---
I'd be down for this.
---
Just a UI addon and a threatmeter. It's all I ran in vanilla and it's all I plan on running this time. The rest of the game I want to play myself.
---
Orc shaman because they are top tier men in azeroth
---
Yes, please!
---
Check out this [abomination of a spec](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LGMxdMZxVzVMxMbZxb) (I like PvP with a healthy rage pool). Bet I could MT UBRS and OT some of the bigger stuff. Otherwise I'm happy to dps the 20-40s and tank 5-man pugs.
---
P.S. I play Alliance PvE (Rogues can smd)
---
Exactly why i want to make War Prot once Vanilla releases even though i never tanked in vanilla before. Should be fun to learn as well :p. 
---
I've been wanting a video like this, for beginners. hopefully to get my brother to try it for the first time
---
Yes the live sub is going to give access to WoW Classic it was announced at Blizzcon.
---
Lololol
---
Enjoy your safe single player game, World of Peacecraft
---
&gt; but the majority of players will be an older generation that played vanilla back in the day.
---
To be honest I feel like it's going to be the complete opposite especially at the launch. I feel like the amount of people who will be trying out classic is going to be so much higher than the people who are playing on private servers, and there's been so many new players that have started playing WoW since 2005 so I think the majority will be completely new players to that version of the game.
---
Maybe the people who will stay after the initial launch will mostly be older folk, but I think there will be a lot of new players in the mix who find out that they like the game despite not playing it back then.
---
Sounds about right, would expect hunter higher than priest though, and rogue will definitely be 2nd most popular at non lvl 60 population.
---
Im sorry, I only do DM E, W and N. :P
---
My first encounter with a skull level mob was swimming across the river from Elwynn on my first character ( probably around level 8 or so, stealthing and creeping into the forest only to have a pack of wolves see right through it and come rip me to shreds.  That was the moment that hooked me.
---
I remember kiting stitches to goldshire a couple of times in my mid 40s.  Watching them scatter, then try to get organized to take him down was amazing.
---
Shaman is a lot of fun, and totems can be appealing to some or a pain in the ass to others. It's really personal preference. Smart placement is essential and it can be a lot of fun customizing a totem loadout for specific encounters. Resto has a totem range talent which helps a ton.
---
As for Call of Water? Look at it as an opportunity to grab some flightpaths you'd otherwise put off.

this was back in wrath. could just be regular plus hit back then I don't really remember exactly what stats existed back then. I just remember being really annoyed when people didn't have speed enchants and casters were the most likely to do it. 
---
When a game changes so much and the original version is no longer available after a certain amount of years, the original developer looses the right of that game.
---
Ie- in 3 years Blizzard will no longer own the code of Vanilla wow, if they do not recreate it.
---
That’s what they care about , and that’s it. 
---
Probably wouldn't impress the average stock holder if they acted like rehashing a 15 year old game was going to make them all rich. ( I think it's a good move but most of their shareholders probably only care about micro-transactions and new games that have them)
---
thanks! appreciate the help
---
Pretty sure it's France too. I think people get Russia because before LH split off from Elysium it was ran by Russians, but the servers have always been in France.
---
I stopped the video after 3 minutes because i couldn't stand it but went back after reading your comment, put the video on 1.25 speed and it's so much better lol. 
---
thanks! 
---
I’m glad! He understands that some people don’t love it, and addresses it in a lot of his videos.
---
&gt;+Can tank dungeons easily, arguably best 5-man tank
---
Nope.  Warriors are better at 60.  Higher DPS, more oh shit tools.  Not that druids are bad, warriors are just better.  
---
However, being a druid makes it a lot easier to get groups as you can tank or heal. Makes gearing a lot easier.  I got my druid in vanilla geared up quite quickly.
---
&gt;-Have to stack tons of mp5 and chug potions just to not OOM
---
I spam mana potions in every raid with my hunter.  Every mana using class ends up using a lot of pots.
---
My guild beat the MC without a single restro druid.  We had 2 to 4 druids every raid all feral, all healing in mostly cloth gear.  I think some went restro for BWL, but the guild might have been paying their respec costs so they could go back and forth to feral.
---
The time you spend up all night with your kids is just training for the main even when classic launches

We’ve already seen the video. 
---
Stonetalon for sure. Shit design but loved the atmosphere. 
---
&gt; Nope. Warriors are better at 60. Higher DPS, more oh shit tools. Not that druids are bad, warriors are just better.
---
What? Druid’s only issue is that they’re crushable and can get destroyed by raid bosses. They beat warrior in every aspect except 10-20+ mobs aoe pulls in dungeons. They’re beefier and have much better threat generation. 
---
You're right I feel like just seeing tauren from the outside of their body would trigger me and give me character dysmorphia. I do really like some orc looks though. They're my second favorite race. 
---
Handbanana would do more physical &amp; emotional damage
---
&gt; BRD: Ironfoe is clumped in with pre-raid or bis farming.
---
LF3M BRD EMP NO ROGUES/FURY
---
I tried retail, the leveling is too rushed to enjoy and dungeons were just go go go with no challenge. 
---
And it's that way thanks to people like you who want to rush to max level without enjoying the journey. 
---
moreso. Hybrids generally don't top charts. If your gear is bananas, then yes, you will but generally no.
---
Sorry ment Tier gear, mageblades and the like is still contested of course! :)
---
Even past bwl into aq40, closest guild mates and I would run strat live and undead just about daily, it became a ritual, after raid one of us would just invite others to group or on non raid nights when we would log in. Nobody even said it after awhile we all just knew where we were going. 
---
We all loved those dungeons and I know for undead it just became how fast can we clear this place? We didn’t really need anything from here, we all hoped we’d see mount drop( never did). 
---
I’m sure you can find people’s alts to gear or like we did just find people that enjoy running dungeons just because.
---
Pretty sure it was 3%
---
lmfao
---
awesome 
---
gave me a chuckle 
---
Id love that! 
---
Interesting you say that. She’s a nurse too
---
Brace for flame
---
Have you done a 5man with a warrior tanking with 2h weapon in defensive stance?  If not, you've never seen what a warrior can do in 5man.
---
yeah I don't remember exactly, was literally 14 years ago. 
---
But I just read the thread title and was surprised at the idea of it being 8% cos I swear it wasn't that much.
---
I think carrot on a stick was 3% to mount speed.
---
hi me shaman , me live in dme
---
I leave for freaking OTS and AF pilot training in the next 6 months. I swear if this game doesn't come out early summer I'm going to scream. There will be no way to juggle the two if If it comes out while I'm there. 
---
Undead mage? The direct opposite of that to me is a Tauren warrior. 
---
So is literally everything though.
---
I would join. I am interested in being your Smite Priest and/or Shockadin. I would require a Ret partner at all times, either way.
---
\\\*chugs a third bottle of Elmers™\*

"calling someone the n word isnt racist actually"

---
😂 I wish I knew where it went off too though or I would so have it on display in my gaming room now.
---
And my axe!
---
Thanks a lot, glad you liked it. And yeah someone pointed that out to me on YouTube, im bummed i got that wrong. 
---
Suppose i lumped the big overhaul Cata provided in with the harbor as well in my memory lol.
---
&gt;Warriors are better at 60. Higher DPS
---
I don't think anyone brings a tank for their damage output, m8.
---
I've played all 3 tanks at 60 and overall found Druid to be the easiest and most versatile of them. You have a high health pool, ton of armor + dodge, ranged pulling tool with infinite ammo, charge usable in combat (without having to stancedance), good ST threat and easy AoE threat which warrior lacks, and other useful things like Regrowth+Rejuv pre-pull which not only heals you a good bit but also causes some AoE threat. You can also Starfire+Moonfire something pre-pull for a bit of snap threat. Whole lotta options. Yeah, Warrior has Shieldwall and Last Stand, but those are 30 minute and 10 minute cooldowns. Can't exactly use them often.
---
&gt;Every mana using class ends up using a lot of pots.
---
Paladin doesn't. I rarely use mana potions on my Paladin, really only on super long fights like Chromaggus or Nefarian or C'thun. I also didn't really have to use potions very often healing on my Druid.
---
Whereas on Shaman, even with a shitload of mp5 gear I was still spamming potions on cooldown pretty much every fight. Though I guess that's not too much of an issue now that I know how to farm gold a lot better, and you don't really need many consumes otherwise.
---
&gt;Honestly, the best advice I can give is play both to 22
---
Read the top of the OP post. I've already played both at 60, just not extensively.
---
On its way homie.
---
Roll a toon on a private server?  It’s free
---
Exactly...
---
I definitely agree. The story of VC and the Defias Brotherhood is actually relatable in many ways. Ragnaros on the other hand? Hard to empathize with a fire elemental proto god lol.
---
I know myself well enough to know that I am definitely NOT going to be attempting to raid hardcore like I did back then; I'm 32 years old and have an actual life whereas I was 18 and delivering pizzas back in Vanilla. I just want to play the version of the game that I truly enjoy.
---
Bring all the "Meme" specs and just have fun! It's a damn video game and should be fun! I don't care about Min/Maxing and I don't think that I'll ever be pushing server first anything. I'd love to be in a guild where the main goal is having fun playing characters how you want to play them.
---
On horde, during encounters where fears will be present, there will be tremor totems.
---
Mulgore!  Just a beautiful zone and I love the Tauren theme. It's the zone that made me fall for WoW after years of struggling through EQ as a youngster. 
---
To be honest, I don't have terribly much interest in raiding to begin with, but as an inveterate lover of meme specs (I mained a balance druid throughout the second half of vanilla's run) I'm all for the idea.
---
'Course, the problem is faction/server. I plan to be playing predominantly Horde on RPvP. I'd like to do Alliance the same server type (obviously not the same server), but we'll have to see how many of each we get.
---
At any rate, I'm certainly interested, which is enough for the purposes of your question.
---
Duskwood is possibly my favorite zone in vanilla. The ambience is unmatched. Those early human zones are just amazing in general, and the Defias are the perfect down to earth antagonists.
---
My favourite specs to play are ele/enh shaman and ret paladin. So yeah, in a second. 
---
I'm ready... at least I don't want the burning crusade and flying mounts 
---
Ashenvale just for the music
---
Mage: Tailoring and Enchanting so you can DE your tailoring greens. Enchanting is a money sink but viola, you’re a mage.
---
And Warlock: Alchemy/Herbalism, so while your warlock is out in the world you can still farm some potions for your mage, or maybe find a black lotus once in a while.
---
Warlocks are forces to be reckoned with in PVP, especially with some melee to hide behind. They start off a little weak, but get even more powerful later on. This is just from the perspective of someone who is on the receiving end of lock pain, not the warlock themselves.
---
I am so sorry my dude! That is no good i am hoping that it is a june launch!
---
Make it two guilds: all paladin Alliance-side, all shaman Horde-side.
---
It would be almost as ridiculous as it would be glorious.
---
People always find a way to make time for the things they love. 
---
Kids will be on iPads, you'll take many sick days, put on 30 kilos and forget your wife's birthday before Christmas!
---
aside from rhok delar, bows are actually terrible in vanilla. if youre not using a crossbow after rhok delar you are doing it wrong
---
Not well after naxx. I would like them to add content like kara, mt hyjail, outlands, ulda, and make it more difficult than naxx (40 person raids) and some 20 person raids with off-specs.
---
This is hard to understand. You like rage but Heroic Strike whenever off cooldown? It's so meme-y. I approve.
---

I quit the game when it got stupid, a few xpacs back. Shortly after the pandas, really. I dont think I've seen new character models, although I have heard of them.
---
Personally, although I'm firmly in the "dont change a goddamned thing, you apostates" camp, I dont care about this since graphics and interface stuff changes and always has changed from system to system depending on hardware and settings.  If some or all of the graphics are higher rez than original on some peoples' machines, does that really matter at all?
---
Not to me. Because I can set my settings as low as I want. And you can set yours as high as you want. And neither of our choices affects anybody else's experience. 
---
Sheep is the only CC that lasted the duration in PvE. Sap, traps, seduce were all around 15 second duration and lasted around 10 seconds before breaking.
---
I haven't played since the beginning of tbc, and I don't like any of the races or new editions, don't like that the alliance and horde basically got made irrelevant anyone can shammy or pally. I played vanilla. I really don't see how characters having more features or options does anything but add more character and individuality to people's toons
---
This is my list exactly
---
Not a sentence but a song. https://youtu.be/oUiOylPbfV0
---
Where did you possibly get the idea that they lose the right to their IP if they don't recreate the original version.
---
Hey guys! Here's a video for those curious about the "Rogue tank" build/role in Classic WoW. A lot of y'all inspired me back when I made my first post about it on this sub, just wanted to say thanks.
---
I agree, this sounds pretty cool. Not sure too many people are doing too much guildfinding just yet, but I may be wrong, I just dont see it. I plan on going pally and go the heals, its what i do at the moment and from what i hear was pretty good in vanilla.
---
But when the time comes I am looking for a guild that is just fun people to hang with and who have a good attitude. People who would be in guilds like this sounds like they would have a good attitude and be helpful for people to still be viable playing styles that are fun but might not be the most optimal for endgame raiding.
---
So when the time comes I would definitely look at a guild like this.
---
Fire Mage in Molten Core, what could go wrong?
---
Is a cross bow a gun......?
---
Mainly a healer, so I'd feel like I'd need to flask out of necessity.
---
Been playing vids with my dad my whole life, and still do most days gotta love online gaming.
---
Wow - thanks for the replies! It’s so refreshing to know that I’m far from alone on this!
---
As I mentioned - I do not want the responsibility of being a guild leader, but if someone wants to start up a region-based roster or something for people to join, please feel free to take up the mantle!
---
The only people against people having fun are hardcore private server players. The mass audience is most definitely going to be filled with people playing what they like and you'll be more likely to group with them than not if that's what you want. 
---
Sure hope so, I plan to run Paladin tank 
---
The desert soundtrack is also amazing. ZF is a great dungeon too! 
---
That robot chicken quest tho? What maniac made that??
---
They're good words. I'm just glad you don't mind me borrowing them on occasion.
---
I remember healing dungeons as a shadow priest while I was levelling in BC. This sounds like a fun concept.
---
Private servers aren't perfect. They have their occasional problems. But it's good to get a little practice in before the real show begins. 
---
Definitely interested!
---
The ambience lore and gameplay is unmatched. 
---
DM was released in patch 1.3.  The vanilla release that will be coming out will be 1.12.  I don't think this will be a viable option because it wont be there.
---
Because old games are great and don't have loot boxes and 15 different dlc
---
We’re finally going home boys!!! 🤠
---
How do you think I know you're American?
---
Yikes
---
Please explain how you “beat” Classic WoW.
---
Or any MMO for that matter.
---
Pretty much this. Low rank Arcane Explosions to gather mobs, then nova, blizzards blinks kite, repeat until mobs are dead
---
I agree, they gained me - someone who has never played wow. They’re gonna get their first sub from me when classic comes out. 
---
This was my exact experience as well.
---
As a MC/AQ/ZG/Kara tank from the vanilla days, I loved seeing that come across chat :)
---
Can warriors be dps? Or are they usually expected to be tanks in raids and dungeons? 
---
I'll be going mining/BS on my main. I like to take my time and smell the roses while leveling so there's a decent chance I will actually be using some of the gear I make while I'm leveling up fishing/cooking/first aid.
---
My rogue alt is feeling alchemy/herbalism so I can funnel useful pots to my main (invisibility pots are so amazing for non stealth classes). I'm also considering enchanting but it seems hard as fuck to level and won't benefit my main really.
---
I feel exactly the same about Retail.
---
Retail had just abused me over and over, taken my money, and then I've left for a while after each time Retail changed too much, only to come back and spend more money and time on it... and now I'm back on the Retail horse again and living high until the next time Retail has some stupid fucking change that makes me ragequit and swear I'll never come back...
---
As is mine HUZZAH!
---
Sounds good until you realise what makes these specs subpar cannot be fixed with a set unless it's ridiculously bloated with benefits which could break pvp even more. shadow is "bad" in pve because it runs out of mana quickly, suddenly you give them huge mana gain from a set and they are even more unstoppable in pvp, same goes for ele and balance.
---
Yep, if you see a ruined tower, enemy campsite, or dwarven bunker and it looks like no one's been by in awhile, there's a good chance there's a chest in there. That said Dwarven rogue treasure plunderer just feels right on so many levels.
---
I would join that guild in a heartbeat!.
---
You can easily make elemental and eaven boomkin work whit a gear update you just have to  solve the mana issue say a set bonus whit mana refund on crit or enable some regen while casting
---
He just casually said the last time we played classic was 12 years ago, and as he said it I realised it was true and that I'm old. 
---
It's disturbing. I know a few people and they had no clue about the re-release until I told them about it. You would think a company would advertise a new product months before the release just like every other game release, ever.
---
I suspect someone is holding them back. Maybe it's budget, maybe it's people being butt hurt that we WON'T play the garbage they make nowadays. 
---
All I'm saying is that this is not normal, even for Blizzard. Blizzard normally advertises their games during Monday Night Football and during prime time TV.
---
The Kara is particularly impressive for a vanilla tank
---
MY EYES!
---
They are one of the best dps in the game, they are expected to tank because so few people want to tank dungeons, I know many warriors (myself Included) who will be tanking dungeons and refuse to take dps warriors.
---
/w Have key?
---
re: No
---
/r No thanks.
---
/4 LF1M TANK SCHOLO GOOD GRP, HAVE KEY, CAN SUMMON, 20G ANY CLASS
---
Shadow is insane in PVP though :P
---
One of the big problems is most of off specs is that almost all abilities have a debuff component. And almost non of them are good in pve. You kind off need to remove debuff cap as well you can make some specs work whit gear just not alot of them
---
I’m the only warrior that likes to tank
---
You do that one and the ones in Feralas and Hinterlands, then you get a permanent mechanical chicken pet.
---
Actually good in scholo
---
Actually good in Scholo
---
I know this is a bit low...but I would run Dead Mines until they were green, then maybe one more...
---
Then again, I'm super addicted to having fun in a dungeon rather than leveling....so....slowly....
---
Winterspring, EPL and BRM are my favourite zones
---
Shout out to Deadwind Pass, since no one will mention it :\[
---
Sign me and my sure to be fail-spec pally. 👍
---
Heck yeah! Move over!
---
You can use common sense with business practices and the behavior of the company to make a damn good educated guess at what’s going on. To say it’s unfounded speculation is like saying there won’t be another expansion in retail. Could it happen? Ya but it doesn’t make much sense to do that from a BUSINESS perspective. So using past behavior and business sense we can deduce that there will be another expansion. Literally the same thing here it just makes sense since there will EVENTUALLY be a massive decrease in subs if no new content happens. And you can base that off the act that content fatigue is human nature. It has nothing to do with vanilla or retail or even wow for that matter. The human brain seeks new things to experience. That is why people play new games and want something that feels fresh. It’s literally not possible for a game to last forever because of human nature and business needs growth. And I’m not saying it will just be 1 month mass unsubs but over time there will be a decrease. It’s not speculation it’s fact
---
I really want to make/be in a Mercenary guild. We would spend our time killing enemy Auctioneers and important quest givers. We would take out contracts on players or entire guilds, offer protection for gold, control Devilsaur spawns, lock down enemy quest hubs in every zone, basically force the creation of the same tyope of guild on the opposite faction. I think that would be insanely fun. But I wouldnt put it past the retail version of customer support to find some reason to say we cant do those things.
---
If you want to experience capital cities with designated shitting streets, then Shaman is for you.
---
I love his voice.  It's so calm and placid.  
---
Must of been brewmaster :)
---
I'm debating the exact same 2 classes! 
---
Mage is the safer pick, but boring AF in PvE. You're literally spamming frostbolt for multiple raids. PvP gods though. Elemental build is very fun.
---
Feral Druid has a very cool rotation but is quite involved and punishing. They can be top tier DPS too. 
---
As mentioned above the consumables are mandatory and will take some considerable time to farm each week. I'm not sure how viable feral is without the Gnomer weapon, so not sure if a less hardcore option is viable. Check out Shedothedruid's guide on YouTube.
---
Hi, /u/NeedsMoreAhegao
---
Druid and Priest have valid off specs for all theirs of raiding. (Bear is a great off tank and shadow really helps warlock dps)
---
I think people are getting too much of the min maxing. Play what you want, it isn’t that big of a difference in pve. There will be plenty of room as long as you contribute to the group. Every class and race is viable in its own ways.  
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
Though not in my country. 
---
Why do we have to stay ahead of "the curve" though? There will always be the hardcore "server first" guilds sure, but they're the 1%. I know this time I am going to take my time and actually read the quests, do my professions, and generally not rush to 60. I want to enjoy the game this time, not make it a job.
---
Ohhhh FFS. That would make sense to me too, considering it being vanilla. It must've awful, like a kitty playing with a mouse or somethin'
---
Damn rogues 
---
Correct me if I am wrong, isn't another angle that  warriors are more gear dependant? Warrior and mage both in mediocre dps gear, mage wins. Both decked out, warrior wins.
---
If you're tanking I don't think there will ever be a point in time where your services aren't wanted for any dungeon.
---
There's nothing you can do as dwarf that you couldn't as human for a dps boost, if you are set on being a minmaxing dps paladin human is the obvious choice for pve, however id advise just picking your favorite race as you are more likely to succeed and feel better when you are playing a character you actually enjoy logging in on.
---
Once you have cleared all the content, you have pretty much "beat" the game in that sense.
---
I suppose for MMO you can set the bar higher and set BIS for all slots
---
Maybe r/NetflixViaVPN
---
Well his question isn't about wep skill at all, so it seems likely he already knows about that. The question is how does a pve specced/geared human sword rogue (which will be a super popular class/spec) fair in pvp?
---
Iirc the whole thing is on there. Each episode for Netflix is a whole season of the webshow.
---
As a warrior main since the beginning, I'm all for balance patches. I think there is way too much of a snowball effect.
---
Rage normalization is just one thing I have been talking about for a while. This would smooth out the curve a bit. Making leveling better as you can actually use abilities before level 30, it would help with threat, and would reign in Fury at late tier.
---
I would love this as well! I'm saving this post, so hopefully there's some follow up when classic comes through. 
---
I think he's talking about Onyxia since she has effectively been running SW. It makes since she'd let as many enemies as possible set up shop right outside the city gates.
---
Speed to boots is clearly the best boot enchant for every role in pretty much all contexts. Honestly it might be the best enchant in the game period. 
---
Technically if you have 2 pairs of BIS boots it makes sense to switch for certain roles in very specific contexts (e.g. fights that don't require movement - and only certain classes really have another enchant that's any good) but that's so niche and most of those fights are really easy anyways. 
---
Also, everyone should have a pair of boots with spurs. 
---
20g? Try 50g. 
---
Why would you level one just to tank Scholo? I guess maybe as a farming toon? Still seems like a waste.
---
I want in.
---
I beat vanilla WoW when I looted a Shadowblade in Alterac Valley off the corpse of an Alliance.
---
Pro Tip: Increase speed to 1.5x to hear him speak at a normal human pace.
---
Not possible unless you mean an Alliance NPC.
---
Elwynn Forest, Westfall and Redridge mountains
---
Yeah theres a reason tanks were hard to find....
---
Just saying.;)
---
You will melt faces as a shadow priest in pvp.
---
Prot pally is not going to be all that valuable in PvP, and you can't really hybrid spec too much if you want to tank well. You basically have to go 11/32/5 with 3 points left over which doesn't leave much room to play as you can't get the 25 points into Holy.
---
It’s easier to pick the ones I hate : STV, Hinterlands, and Wetlands. 
---
Westfall and The Barrens will always be my favorites though. It just felt like I spent more time stuck in those zones than any other and they have great atmosphere. 
---
Thanks for the info! Why do so few people want to tank dungeons? Just curious.
---
It's not MMO specific, but Video Game High School is pretty great for nerdy humor references. It's all on youtube. Maybe Netflix too.
---
Edgemaster's would make the weapon specialization difference not as big of a deal, but then you can only use swords and you would pretty much be counting on getting Ashkandi and then Corrupted Ashbringer (both of which aren't particularly likely as a Ret Paladin). 
---
I kinda feel bad for Warrior mains when classic releases. There's going to be a fair amount of people DPS'ing like it's retail. Enh shamans earth shocking before you even charge. Hopefully, they learn quick.
---
Let's discuss Mists of Panderia.  
---
&gt; Edgemaster's on a pally
---
LOL. Also Edgemaster's only affects 1h skills.
---
I think it's mostly perception, people think it's a high stress job because you control the pace of the group and many people don't want that responsibility.
---
And then there's also the warriors who just refuse to tank because "I'm dps" without realizing they could get massive amount of gear faster if they just tanked.
---
Pally DPS is a joke but you aren't losing out on much being human vs dwarf. Nobody's going to care about your race in the first place because you're rolling ret. Either go all the way and min/max the shit out of it or be more casual and just do whatever.
---
Hi, /u/MarshallTom
---
its ez to be dps instead of heals/tank and theres fewer classes to tank than heal so theres even more demand for tanks
---
You also get to play alongside your best friend all the time.
---
Wait, barrens have copper nodes? I'm not sure ever seen one.  That's the worst zone in the game for mining.
---
Did players not drop anything besides silver and body parts, then? Must have been a guard, still feels lucky when you've got 39 others clumped up able to loot!
---
&gt; they have Berserk which significantly increases their DPS especially if combined with engineering
---
How does this work?
---
Indeed!
---
Players just dripped money, the body part things and random gray junk.
---
I have seen a few epics drop in AV. Everyone rolls need lol.
---
I've always been fine with shadow priests in groups.  Just be willing to pop out of shadow and heal from time to time if needed.  
---
Guess i was wrong then 
---
You can tank in holy spec, I had no issues with any 5man instance. Great if you wanna heal end-game raids but still fancy tanking the odd 5-10man w/o respeccing.
---
It was a great way to help friends and get some variation.
---
Goal was to AoE tank ZG but I gave up before ZG release (North Dale).
---
World PvP - I made someone rage log, someone made a forum post that they were quitting the game because of me camping them. Exploiting engineering to jump off of mountains with people I had mc capped etc, griefing raids on world dragons ( because I didnt have a pve guild ). I've never had more fun in a game before or since my exploits in vanilla wow world pvp.
---
As a warlock in early vanilla, it was painful how many people accepted invites when saying "can summon" but they would refuse to accept the summon request and run / fly to the dungeon from a capital city, the rest of us waiting at the entrance, killing reapawns. 
---
I would like to see something like this as a future patch to Vanilla, like Patch 1.14. Work to balance and create content for Vanilla instead of expansions.
---
This is exactly what I was looking for. 
---
There are dozens of us!
---
I think you accidentally your sentence 
---
First MMO I played, scale of the whole thing, my love of Blizzard’s warcraft story and best friends in high school were the big reasons. I’m going to do it better this time around. Treadmill walking and a laptop desk, life problem solved.
---
uh... 1.12 is after 1.3.
---
Twelve is more than three.
---
I remember loot being Free For All so it was basically whoever got to that corpse and nabbed it first.
---
Badlands. 
---
NO ROUGES
---
That’s certainly possible if the raid lead set it to that.
---
It defaults to group loot though so rolls would populate for anyone nearby.
---
For every problem, there's a totem.
---
Why do you feel bad for warriors? I'm just going to let them die. Why would I give a shit? 
---
you cant buy a lesser wand off the AH during FRESH. Shouldn't incorporate that into your speed run
---
I'm fully with you on  this one. And it's a large part of the reason why I hope to see them take Classic in a OSRS approach, as  world-ending threats are honestly just boring.
---
You mind controlled the buffer then, not the buffee. 
---
Read the notes.
---
I had 37 cloths - I am positives I can convince an enchanter during fresh to make me a wand as payment. Because I can't find a newbie enchanter currently - I opted to buy it from the AH as replacement, lose my 9s and destroy my 37 cloth in the process and sat AFK for 15 min, since thats how long it may have taken me to find an enchanter during fresh.....
---
Yeah. It's a pretty easily solvable issue.
---
Personally I'd love vanilla style gameplay but with properly balanced (not the same thing as homogeneous) classes/specs.
---
I'd love frost mage dps being more than just spamming one button. Not the ridiculous rotations of retail, but damn if I wouldn't like at least something like an arcane missile proc that makes it do frost damage and casts twice as fast or something. Anything other than just mindlessly pressing a single button.
---
I love the Mage overall, but goddamn, raiding is mostly boring af.
---
So you're good with a run being harder by letting DPS die and having a warrior struggle with aggro?
---
If you want to heal at end-game, it should be shaman, imo.
---
Horde tries to bring 8 to every raid, right? That's some high fucking demand.
---
I mean, yeah? What am I supposed to do about it? People who refuse to help themselves will suffer the consequences. 
---
I won't have any issues finding DPS for groups so I'll just pick people who aren't retarded. 
---
I never said he raids with slackers. I said the exact opposite. I said he's basically a carry. He knows his DPS can't compete with the rest of his raid when they actually put in the effort, so he goes above and beyond what they need to do on farm content so that he can show high numbers on his stream.
---
That's not how Feral is going to get accepted into raids and kill bosses. That's how someone puts up pretty numbers for his stream audience. Big difference.
---
From a PVE perspective Druids are much more fun. Feral is actually viable. Resto is always in demand. You can tank 5 mans. Shamans are probably the most boring healer. Shamans level slow and steady but they are boring. Druids are probably the best leveling melee/wpvp melee post 20 and leveling is a joy.
---
From a PVP perspective Shamans close the gap and it's preference. Resto druids are better than a full resto shamans and a heavy resto druid will wipe the floor with resto as a 1 v 1 duel class. Elemental on the other hand is strong but will require a 100 gold a week respec. Melee druids are more flexible than enhance and a better 1 v 1 spec. Enhance excels early though, especially with Diremaul in at launch and a Arcanite Reaper.
---
So I would say if PVE is your main thing druid. If PvP is your main love go with what you like the most. More into wpvp and 1 v 1 then druids are better. More into BG's and group PvP Shaman's are equally capable. I prefer Elemental out of any spec with those two classes, but that is because I only really raid to chill with people and get gear for PvP. If I was someone that was always doing 5 mans and stuff druid would be way more fun to play.
---
your DPS will be low enough to not matter regardless, play whatever you want

Yeah, but this won't be a problem long. Most people who joined WoW wotlk+ probably won't make it past level 30 anyways once they realize how much harder and different everything was. Those that do make it will probably have the fortitude to realize their wrongs and adjust accordingly. 
---
And old vanilla veterans should only need a little while to get back in the swing of things.
---
it's the best class in the game
---
Warrior: cause I don’t like waiting for groups.
---
Innervate is insane for Priests - but my perfect raid comp has 12 Shaman healers who get basically zero benefit from Innervate. My (hypothetical) one healing Priest and my one Shadow Priest will appreciate the two Innervates that we do have :)
---
I'm not trying to be rude here but what you are saying is simply not true. Knowledge is not the only thing that has improved over the years, movement has too. (It happens in every game, go and watch old CS videos if you don't believe me.) Regarding WoW, I played at the top of my server. My server was at the top of other servers—maybe not the best but it was close. My server took world 1st and 2nd kills on Nefarian and many other world firsts including 4Horseman. My friends and guild mates, Schmitty and Anujit &lt;DnT&gt;, won the first real 2v2 tournament. Other friends and guild mates went on to win multiple early arena seasons. Back in Vanilla none of us played close to as well as players do today. I am certain no random players did either. You know how I know that? Because we were winning almost everything.  
---
Comment sections are filled with people claiming to have played like gods yet magically none of them have any proof of it, be it videos, world firsts, or tournament wins.
---
I think that's a pretty fair substitute. You could also try the slight alternative where you intentionally farm 4 stacks of linen cloth around level 5. Probably would take the better part of an hour, but I'm pretty sure that would be enough to make a handful of green robes. Essentially similar to the making green leather items you could pick up enchanting yourself, DE green robes, make lesser wand, then either drop Tailoring/Enchanting on the spot, or wait to make greater wand and drop then. 
---
Probably the least time/money effecient way of doing it, but basically a guaranteed means of getting yourself a wand.
---
Cool stats, thanks for sharing!
---
Dozens! 
---
I mean how needed are tanks? I would love to go bear 🐻 for fast groups
---
I’d be careful with agreeing because apparently if you give an opinion you get down voted 
---
I’ll be rolling Alliance to start with, but either way, looks like there’s enough support for this kind of thing that you should have no problem finding a guild like that 🙂
---
Enhance is the top dmg BG melee class for like 1/2 of Classic WoW because there will be no rank 14 gear at the start of Classic unlike on private servers and warrior early tier gear is garbage. There is stupidly strong enhance gear in DM and Arcanite Reaper is sitting there.
---
Ret is just as broken for the same reason. Most rets are just awful and don't use utility in between reckoning one shots.  In real vanilla most Rets were so bad they didn't even use reckoning.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxrQnQC5FDs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=72](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxrQnQC5FDs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=72)
---
Ret is the worst played class in the history of MMO's with the worst playerbase. You have a playerbase that sits and cries about rogues 24/7 when their class can literally one shot a rogue inside a hammer of justice (stunlock) the rogue can't even break with a pvp trinket that requires no timing or anything. Simply delusional.
---
After awhile it just feels a bit contrived. This is what retail suffers from. Every 5 seconds theres a world ending threat lol.
---
Well if I'm tanking then I guess either I would have them kicked or I would find a new group. I am the tank after all
---
Dang you caught that.  Here have a upvote.
---
Try making friends. It's what MMO's used to be about.
---
in all the runs I have done (I've done about 7 so far but don't remember the details of the others) - I grind from 5-7 hoping for cloths which was a little bit over an hour.
---
one run all I got was like 20 cloth but 6 bags, another run I got around 45 cloth and 2 greens - so I made my own wand at level 7 or 8. Another I didn't grind and kept going as usual with LW/Skinning and was able to make my own wand at level 10.
---
My current run - I was able to scrap up 37 cloth and 0 bag, so I substitute with what I mentioned above.
---
Basically 5-7 I have no profession and I grind, hoping for cloths. If I make less than 25 cloths, I gotta hope I got some bags and greens to barter with another Enchanter.
---
If I make 50 cloths with 2 greens - I will pick up tailoring/ench and make it myself
---
if I make 66 cloths - I will pick up tailoring/ench and make my wand and sell any excess
---
If I make 35-50 - I will try to barter. Maybe give them cloths + bag or any greens on me.
---
It takes some real maturity and patience to do this.  You have to have people who value camaraderie and learning.
---
If you have this, though, it will be a far better experience than you ever had with the optimal speccers.
---
I've been trying to find a good intro video for my gf and this is perfect
---
What's your zone...
---
....and why is it the Barrens?
---
I leveled as pure bear tank on a pserver. Never had anyone complain. First time druid. You are a little squishy 35-39 tanking dungeons but once you get dire bear at 40 you feel great again. Tanking is super easy for 5 mans. I never did any raiding but I also never made any attempt to either.
---
Everything reserved of course 
---
Just FYI streaming private server is a bannable offence. Might want to lay off that, if you're planning on keeping affiliate. 
---
Paladin tanking is a bit rough. My 2nd toon on Nostalrius was a Dwarf Pally and I tanked everything through ST. Aggro can be an issue if you have brain dead dps who wont target assist you and the lack of a quick cooldown taunt makes certain dungeon runs painful. Despite what everyone thinks, you do have a taunt. Just bubble someone. Obviously that only works every 5 minutes though. Healers and mages will like you since you have to drink pretty regularly. Once you hit Mara it starts to become much harder to tank as a Pally. ST is very hard due to how hard mobs hit you. I had the best possible gear available when I started running it and it was still brutal AF
---
With all that said, a decently geared Pally tank can level fast AF. Any kill quests, like basically all of Stanglethorn, is pure cake with a Pally tank. You can also solo quit a few of the elite quests. Some even a level or 2 below. Finally, being able to alternate healing or tanking early dungeons is a huge boon for...well everything, lol
---
F Tier: Alexensual 
---
I thought this was a NY Yankees subreddit for a second, never mind. 
---
You are freaking HIGH if you think endgame resto druids outperform resto shamans in raids. Like, high on coke or something. Resto druids are the LEAST in demand endgame healer in raiding. 
---
That's kind of what I mostly want to do, I already signed up as resto sham for my guild, but if no one takes the guild feral/OT I'm probably calling it. Takes extra effort but easier main for me to stick with
---
Only if you let it. 
---
Bear is a great tank for basically all 5 mans. I think it's called "swipe" is the best AoE tank ability while leveling bar none. Later on, it gets pretty tough to find +def gear that will allow you to tank harder stuff but that is more for raiding 
---
I don't think you can use multiple rigging that the textures are on top of. What I mean by that is in the modern game the animations were the new ones even on the old character models when that was an option. In Classic they have the old rigging and animations so things like upright orcs wouldn't even work or would be bugged.
---
They COULD add new models that are similar as an option but the problem is the rigging will result in things that look wrong just like the old models on the new rigging. Buggy messes isn't something Blizzard wants to deliver.
---
On creatures, say they use the new sea giant models as an example. The ones that have boat shoulders.  They are a different size than the vanilla sea giants that farted bubbles and popped them. When they get near the shore they will appear to swim on land because of this. This will happen with any animation that is not the exact same size. So they would have to resize or tweak every model in the game or make sure they all work. This would be stupidly time consuming when a lot of these old models already look great with supersampling/higher resolution than their native model. In addition you lose purposeful design and immersion with things like that sea giants bubbles.
---
The reason I know all this is I used MPQ WoD and up models on private servers. It's buggy. Really buggy. Weapons in your hand bug out on personal character models as well due to the rigging.
---
&gt; Unless you are just trolling, you are glossing over the fact that raw damage/healing is not a useful metric in a raid composition
---
Sadly, it's the only useful metric for a hybrid. Because everything you need is covered by pure DPS classes, tanks and healer specs.
---
It would be great if vanilla had fights where hybrids were needed. I wish it did. But it doesn't. What it does have is fights where you need all the DPS you can get and where DPS shamans, DPS priests, DPS paladins and DPS druids are a liability.
---
Like I said, I wish the encounter design were different. Or the hybrids were different. Or something. But they aren't, and anyone telling themselves they bring more to the raid as hybrid DPS is kidding themselves.
---
Even the token shadow priest helps the raid best by going into shadow only as far as Shadow Weaving, spamming rank 1 SW:P for the weaving stack and healing the rest of the time.
---
I can't see why most druids wouldn't go bear tanks for dungeons and collect resto gear while your at it. Especially if they are in high demand. 
---
&gt; No one wants to play on Nost's low pop realm where guilds are clearing Naxxramas, people are roaming the open world in T3 and there's 1k people online and you'll never find a guild to do the whole PvE progression with.
---
The new servers that were added later actually their own progression cycle, so everytime a new server opened it started with the "base" content, and its own release cycle. So nobody was running around with tier 3 since it wasn't out on that server.
---
&gt;It would probably be worse in TBC but I still think it's terrible in vanilla, the world isn't made for 10k players (which is clear when you look at servers introducing dynamic respawns and such which often times don't even solve the problem and sometimes create completely new issues. If the world was designed for that many people none of these changes into the spawn systems would be needed in the first place).
---
Because vanilla respawn rate on quest objects was 15 (!) minutes. This will be changed on Blizzard's servers as well.
---
&gt;It doesn't feel like you're adventuring through a MMORPG, it feels like a mini game of going to a location and sitting still for hours spamming tab + insert instant cast spell here, and then doing it again and again and again because there's 20 people standing next to you and zero mobs in the world to kill.
---
Literally a launch issue, and that has been the same for most WoW expansion releases. And I even think its less of an issue in vanilla because of the more diverse zones. In Outland EVERY 60 character will go straight into hellfire -&gt; Zangarmash -&gt; Terokkar etc. While in vanilla people start in 8 different starting zones, and have multiple zones to lvl in at every tier.
---
&lt;
---
&gt;But it seems like you're trying to vouch for them doing these 10k cap mega servers as a default option at least according to your previous replies which is what I disagree on.
---
Because its better, and years of vanilla private servers proves that this is the standard prefered options by most players, as it solves a lot of vanillas key issues. And even if vanilla was intended to have a cap of 3k players by design, it works better with more (as it creates way less downtime) once the initial launch issues have settled down.
---
Never thirsty.
---
I was in a server first guild until Naxx (missed naxx due to deployment) BWL was peak enjoyment for me.  I would be happy just running 5 mans, UBRS, MC &amp; BWL in classic.
---
There are youtube vids of Shamns tanking Onyxia but i think theyre overgeared for it.
---
Paladin BFH Big Fucking Hammers
---
They won't be pumping serious advertising dollars into Classic (just like they didn't pump major advertising dollars into SC Remastered and won't be into WC3 Reforged). Quite simply put - it's not designed to appeal to audiences who weren't there at the time.
---
Yeah. Tanks are in such high demand that people will love you.
---
Your post is absolute garbage and you should feel ashamed.
---
Blizzard legally own the code of Vanilla wow for all time, unless they decide to sell it to somebody.
---
Fun stuff! Roguetanked some HCs back in BC. 
---
Did you consider having rogues lower than 60? As lower levels scales better with stats, and ??-targets being at a constant +3 level value. Iirc you could attune for and enter MC at 55.
---
It’s also a good way to get burnt out before classic drops. I tried a private server before and I enjoyed it, but stopped myself before I got too involved as I didn’t want to spoil my classic experience. 
---
No they don't - how many ads for Starcraft Remastered did you see on Monday night football or during prime time TV? None. How many have you seen for WC3: Reforged? None. This is no different - it's a remake of an ancient game that absolutely nobody is going to play outside of a fraction of the OG fanbase. They aren't going to make big money out of it, and thus they aren't wasting big advertising dollars on it.
---
Dudu master race.
---
It wasn't slower when you weren't starting in trash greens like on a private server. We were in AQ/Naxx gear and they even gave rank 14 gear away at the end of vanilla for easily farmed honor points. In addition another reason we did it was that quest rewards got larger at 70 (gold amount) then they were during leveling and we did them with a flying mount, **which again skipped pvp** and made the questing stupidly fast and a great easy goldfarm in combination with mining/herbalism or even with that engineering zapper on our pvp characters.
---
For an example of how stupidly easy and fast TBC questing is go in that zone with the modern game and flying where you can just fly form point a to point b. 
---
So we farmed rep, we farmed a ton of gold towards the epic flying mount and we ended up saving time.
---
Just to let you know, even Druids and Paladins are good tanks for dungeons. So if those classes feel better to play for you, absolutely go for it.
---
lol
---
West fall and its music. Running deadmines, seeing first blue staff link in general chat and guild chat, good old days.
---
Back then, blue was like legendary. 
---
It's "shit DPS" vs "wet shit DPS" --- so if you want to play ret, you do you, I guess?
---
I've read about the level scaling, and I have seen videos about 100% Avoidance Rogue Tanks at level 10 in the 10-19 Twinking bracket back in Burning Crusade, but I thought all of that was after the Dodge and Parry Rating overhaul from patch 2.0. I haven't found a place that indicates better avoidance stat scaling for lower levels in Vanilla, but that could be very, very big if true.
---
I'm sure more warriors would be willing to tank if the majority of dps players weren't idiots. 
---
So often I'll be doing a tricky pull with a bow to line of sight some casters and the dps will just start dumping on them. Then of course it's my fault when the patrols join in. 
---
Actually it's probably not the majority, but you only need 1 to ruin a run. 
---
Verog. Fuck that quest. 
---
I mugged Vancleef and stole his designer Defias pants.
---
1.12 Warrior : We make all other melee pointless in PVE and we dominate PvP as well, while people complain about rogues from patches that won't even exist in Classic WoW.
---
I'm in with Mortal Strike warrior and offtank, I'm good as fury but I've recently been given some sweet info on maximizing this spec
---
I’m coming for you Horde scum!
---
If someone does that then you tell them to sort their shit out. If they do it again you kick and replace them. dps are a dime a dozen, and morons can be easily discarded.
---
I was the MT/OT in my vanilla guild.  Only did MC, Ony, ZG and AQ20 but I loved it.  It is so much fun but takes a lot of getting used to compared to how tanking was when I left (cata.). It is not going to be for everyone and I still wonder how much hate stance dancing is going to get because it is so far removed from the game at this point.
---
I agree no changes, but as the servers get older people will have Meta alts. 
---
Well I will do that for sure. It's a super fast way to meet people and get your FL full.
---
And your missing rezz is irrelevant until you get better healing gear. 
---
I pref. Healing, but tanking as a bear is super easy. Can recommend it. 
---
For me it was a little different...
---
I was already and adult, married for 6 years... i had previously experienced the wonder of MMO's with Everquest and was playing EQ2 at the time... one of my best friends had left for the navy and while he was attending Nuke school started playing WoW... He begged me to come play but at first i was stubborn. EQ players looked down on WoW as baby's first MMO and i bought into the elitism, but i sure did want to hang out with my best friend! I was pretty vocal to all my other friends that i would never play the game... but the temptation of a new MMO and spending time with my friend were to great... I'm sure glad i caved. i started telling my friends how amazing the game actually was... eating crow never tasted so good.
---
Fast forward all these years and i have many real life friends as a result of this game, including one from Australia that is like a brother to me... our guild Maniacal is still around and will hopefully see a resurgence in classic! So many good memories, not of the game, but of the people, the friendships, the conversations the laughter... 
---
To my fallen guild mate Aki who died of cancer, we all miss you and love you and we'll never forget you! To my brothers and sisters from my first guild Dept. of Disabilities, i hope life is treating you well and i hope we meet again, even if it is just on the internet!

[Patch 1.7 nerfed defense on items](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.7.0#Items) which might explain the different numbers found on the green "of Defense" items. On your spreadsheet you have 29 defense head, 21 defense hands. The wiki says it was nerfed by ~33%, which is in line with the numbers on my 1.12 test server (19 defense head and 14 defense hands).

Duskwood, for the longest time I was stuck there. (Holy priest) trying to finish everything.  I loved raiding stiches and pvp spill over from STV.
---
See other thread regarding creating a meme spec guild
---
I was a rogue in Vanilla with full T1 and full T2. I'm pretty sure I was doing AQ40 with a mix of ZG, T1 and T2 gear to max itemisation. I was a relatively hardcore raider for reference, I spent more than enough time on the EJ forums.
---
For me its definitely the barrens.
---
I want to try something different this time, but I know I'm just gonna go back to tanking...
---
&lt; Druish Wedding &gt;
---
&gt;+Few druids, thus less competition for tier gear
---
Works both ways though because guilds don't want as many of them, whereas shaman are very much loved in raids and always high in demand because they're one of the slower leveling classes.
---
No, this is the authentic vanilla release experience.
---
http://www.leagueofpirates.com/sirvival/queuedance.html
---
uh, he never said druids outperform shamans in raids, he was talking about PvP
---
you are the one who seems to be "freaking HIGH"
---
Patch 1.7 came out in September of 2005, but I have an archived page from January 2007 (patch 1.12) that says [28 Defense](https://web.archive.org/web/20070112060220/http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=10261). I also have a page from [classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10261/adventurers-bandana) (which as far as I can tell is intended to be a resurrection of Thottbot?), and the page says that Defense doesn't show up at all on the Adventurer's Bandana.
---
Who the fuck is basing their choice off which resto spec is better for dueling? Resto/ele hybrid shaman is way better and more fun than druid. And I'd strongly disagree with you that resto druid healing is more fun, you throw rejuv on people and hope it doesn't get sniped, which it invariably will. Other than that you have one heal. Shamans have totems to manage and chain heal is way more interesting than rejuv or healing touch.
---
Aren't you describing phasing?
---
This is why I'm hoping someone ports the premade group finder as an addon to Classic so you won't have to spam chat, just list your group once and then wait to see who applies.
---
Wait till ppl actually have to learn threat management, aka Vael in BWL........
---
You don't focus on def gear, you focus on health and armor and take those crits like a man.
---
This is why I mained warrior in vanilla and will again in Classic. 
---
This seats taken. Go play a rogue. 
---
I don't understand how this is a reply to me.
---
Mistake 
---
Love the reference!
---
It is the only role that actually takes some skill in PvE. Healing and DPSing is mostly just spamming one button and keeping an eye on the threat meter.
---
The term usually means cheesing mechanics by overdoing something.  
---
There is a sizeable group of people have been fighting for it since TBC launched.  
---
I've been on board since Wrath, and fighting since Cata.
---
Dun Morogh has always at the top of my list. First zone I ever logged into 12 years ago as a middle school student who had never played any online game before in his life. The music, ambience and natural beauty of the snow capped mountains of Khaz Modan blew me away and made me fall in love with the zone and game instantly. Just listening to the music fills me with happiness. 
---
This template is in my top 3 of all time. 
---
You saw it more predictably with phasing, yes.  But it happens with sharding too.
---
Genuine question: will there be loadouts in vanilla or do you have to cast them individually? I can't remember when it was added.
---
I understand that your comment is hinting towards the former, but it also might be a catch-all term for how different totems interact with each other(?)
---
Lightning bolt burst. 
---
I never took a toon on a raid outside my warrior in vanilla or BC.  I loved it until I was just burnt out, it becomes such a commitment considering you get put in the front of the line for tanking upgrades.  The fact that you can’t just AOE trash mobs is going to be a big learning curve for folks who are only used to the later expansions.
---
In vanilla you had to cast each totem 1 at a time. The 4-totem-cast thing was not until WOTLK, iirc.
---
Mana management.
---
IIRC combat daggers was the top tier Rogue dps spec around tier 2.5/3. It wasn't a spec most people would ever have seen unless they raided in top guilds. It was horrible at everything except raiding but it had a decent edge in damage over combat swords.
---
This is how people play on practice servers. As a tank, you learn to deal. Your job is basically to rotate taunt/stun/Intercept/Feral Charge juuuuuuuust long enough for the DPS to kill trash mobs. It's definitely doable, but I recommend making your own groups so that you can ensure you have enough crowd control. You can't tank 4 elites like that, but you can tank 1 or 2 at a time.
---
Bosses are immune to taunt so the DPS still needs to give you a little bit of lead time. They don't wait for 3 stacks of Sunder Armor like in the old days, but they will give you 1-2 global cooldowns to establish some threat, which is all you really need. Just make sure to get some hit on your gear because a chain of missed attacks at the start of a pull can lead to a dead DPS or two.
---
Wow thank you!!! Leans towards troll now :)
---
Thank you for the in depth response describing how to effecrively manage mana. Ive gotten at least 100x better just on this comment.
---
Thank you! Tough call, I’ll play more pve than pvp but that resist sounds amazing 😅....
---
I’m in!
---
Ty mate. I’ve had it save my ass many times, hiding from mobs or enemies, going afk etc. use feign death to get out of combat or simply guarding flag room ab bases example 
---
Maturity has nothing to do with age I have discovered. I now play games with guys between 15 and 45 and some of the 15-18 year olds are way more mature then I ever was at that age.
---
Come one, come all I say.
---
Tips is F tier 
---
Yeah but they can't raid tank
---
A bad 5-man PVE priest is one that doesn't over-heal. Instead, they wait for the tank's HP to drop to a certain level but don't take into consideration their cast time or the attack rotation of the enemy. The result being a wipe.
---
&gt; The fact that you can’t just AOE trash mobs
---
[I beg to differ](https://youtu.be/84OwHLAuQzc?t=50)
---
pve is whatever, pay attention and have an apm above 15, you can't be a competent human being and fail at vanilla pve healing if you're putting any effort into it at all
---
PvP, dispel defensively with obsession, it's pretty much the single most important thing you could be doing at any point. Frost mages blow people up, but how do they do that? With shatter combos, dispel the freeze and the damage is negligible. A warrior sitting in a sheep may as well just be dead. Position defensively and don't make yourself an easy target. Inner fire is a big deal, armor is relevant as fuck in vanilla. A lot of it is just having good vision and realizing what is happening around you. 
---
Can summon.
---
There is no such thing as \#nochanges
---
its a meme
---
&gt; we'll already be doing different than vanilla such as every consume and world buff
---
no one is forcing you to do this.
---
you complain that the content is too easy, but plan to use stuff that will make the content easier.  
---
do you have shizophrenia or something?
---
Because Blizzlike 1x respawn rates in vanilla on open-world quest objects is a whopping 15 fucking minutes. Have fun in Hillsbrad or wherever surrounded by 20 people to loot blacksmith crate.
---
having leveled with both speccs, that's incorrect. thank you for confirming that you have no idea what you're talking about though
---
That is the most early 2000’s video I’ve seen in a long time.  Thank you sir.
---
&gt;Even when I was in my ~30s, i remember Stromgarde Keep respawning elite ogres faster than we could even kill them,
---
Must have been a bad dynamic respawn system then, the good ones only when there are a fuckton of players in close-vicinity, as in almost right next to you and not for the entire zone.
---
No, it had 16k peak on release, and I am pretty sure it had 15k on major content releases.
---
I went from the Ragnarok Online beta in 2003-2004 to RO private servers before getting into WoW private servers some time in 2005. I was going to Uni and never worked so I didn't want to bother with a subscription based game. The private server was buggy as all hell but I was enjoying it enough that I wondered what the real deal was like. In late 2005 I started working, bought WoW and a gamecard with my first pay. I actually went with a mate who also wanted to buy WoW but they only had one left, he insisted I take it and he was gonna take the bus to get it from a different shopping centre in the next suburb over.
---
After a few weeks my hours at work got cut to part time and it wasn't long till I wasn't needed. I smashed WoW over Uni summer break and spent the years following being a terrible student.
---
Oh yes, streamlined content, lfg and lfr were delicately put in the game because of people who enjoy to play optimally. It most certainly wasn't because of casual donuts like yourself who whine about not being able to get a group going.  
---
Right.
---
Really good video, loved the humor and it was really easily understood. Make more!
---
its the only way I'd even consider raiding.  
---
Runas in Aszuna, and the entire Suramar storyline in fact, would like to have a word with you. 
---
It was a looting bug, both what u/RammerJammerYlwHamr described,   but also that you could get stuck in that looting pose and run around while kneeing.
---
you will get into naxx like this, don't worry.  
---
No. I play a lot of retro games.
---
Not knowing something isn't the reason I play them. 
---
It's just because some of the older games are geniunly fun to play. 
---
I don't get why wow must rise from a fog of mystery to be good. 
---
It's a genuinely good game.
---
Maybe it's because I don't live in the past and don't worry to much about the future. 
---
I just want to live in the moment and enjoy myself. 
---
Ofc it will succeed. First Chinese guild to kill Illidan did it like 1.5 month after TBC was released in China. Most of them still had nothing but Tier 3 gear.
---
Everything is possible.
---
Well they shouldn't have. Only current content need be gated like that. No one doing old content is still RPing. 
---
wait till the come across me! the shitty druid and my endless moonfire spam
---
Druids can raid tank, they just likely wont main tank. They can even be more effective on magic damage encounters like Rag. 
---
dispel
---
utilizing all you instant casts properly, but mainly dispel.  
---
its twice as important on alliance side since you do not have shamans for purge.  
---
dispel your enemies, dispel your friends. 
---
for really shit priests I advice to bind dispel to the S key.  
---
everytime you try to backpeddle you do something useful instead.  
---
 And that middle finger will burn those elitists eyes out :)
---
See - you're straw-manning the hell out of this whole thing. I never once said that OG vanilla players were pvp gods, only you said that and starting arguing against yourself. I said there were some "pretty good" players and not everyone was retarded and backpedalled. Nowhere did I say "movement" didn't evolve. You just like arguing.
---
Also - weird brag.
---
I say the same thing every day....nothing beats the rush!
---
Nice troll.
---
lick my nuts
---
Why are you downvoting this person. This is exactly the correct answer. 
---
I've been doing this on a gnome warlock over and over, I'm normally almost level 12 before I get my 40 cloth and head to If for tailoring and enchanting, make my wand then drop it for herb before heading for my warlock quest.
---
I don't mind the cloth grind because as a warlock even before having a void grinding is very fast exp.
---
I'm actually serious. It's the equivalent of only having to post to trade once so it accomplishes the same thing but reduces spam. I'm obviously not talking about the automated group finder they introduced in wotlk but the completely manual one that functions like a trade chat.
---
&gt; you couldn't loot anything else until then
---
That detail did it, the memories came back! 
---
Declare someone objectively wrong without evidence, nice. 
---
Broodlord comes to mind aswell.
---
individual cast, but I like to keep my commonly used ones in little "groups" for easy casting. For example when I see a rogue nearby I have a few totems I want to get down ASAP (poison cleansing for obvious reasons, searing totem to keep him in combat, earthbind to kite) and don't want to search too hard on my jam packed casting bars. I just call em loadouts.
---
I hear you can even do a one button macro that cycles through your four favorite air/water/fire/earth totems.
---
It's a paladin tank. A complete different level of dedication and preparation.
---
in vanilla only shamans, paladins and druids were hybrids.
---
you need to be versed in physical damage, magical damage and healing to be a hybrid. i.e. all forms of combat interaction.  
---
warrior is a purely physical class, no hybrid.  
---
priest is a purely magical class, no hybrid.
---
inb4: no, caster melee swings don't count as physical damage. same as old warrior thunderclap didn't make them casters.  
---
and hunters can only heal their pet, also does not make them hybrids.
---
I think the likely explanation here is that Allakhazam was slow to update these items. I can find a [2007 snapshot of +12 Defense Stalwart Clutch on Allakhazam](https://web.archive.org/web/20071201201015/http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=12115) and a [2006 comment saying it has +8 Defense](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12115/stalwart-clutch#comments:id=2632913). 
---
The general understanding is this: https://itemization.github.io/1.7/armor/waist/stalwart-clutch-12115.html

Current classic wowhead is a frankenstein that I (currently) wouldn't trust at all.

[TBC Quest](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=8476/amani-encroachment), [TBC NPC](https://classic.wowhead.com/npc=15399/lieutenant-dawnrunner), [Spells that would do 0 damage for the majority of leveling](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=116/frostbolt) ("added in patch 1.13" and "taught by Tome of Frostbolt"???), and [Items clearly missing random rolls.](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13386/archivist-cape) It's a WIP. 
---
Kargoz is S. His class guides are insanely high quality.
---
Precision is 5% hit not 50% hit, I won't be missing half my abilities by only putting 3pts into the combat tree. What do you mean "by 60s"? Levelling stops at 60 but yes I'll be hemo spec at 60 as well for a few months  because I'll be pvping and it's the least gear dependent spec. Kill time difference per mob is barely noticeable while levelling, have you tried doing so as hemo?
---
Vanish helps vs a hunter because you vanish before they get in sting range. Some hunters even open up with hunter's mark, I guess because they're lazy and are just hoping your vanish is on cd.
---
I've played a rogue for more than 5mins (1.5 years from 1.9 to mop), I'm rusty but doing fine. As is the other guy who replied to you who got 60 as hemo in 6-7 days without rushing.
---
It's better to experiment than blindly follow guides. For levelling I take 3/3 setup instead of improved sap and love it.
---
Having a hard time deciding if i want to play rogue or hunter.
---
I will mostly be doing pvp. Lots of battleground and probably a little bit of wpvp.
---
Anyone here have any opinions on why i should play rogue or hunter?
---
I played a crap ton of wc3 and frozen throne as a kid, one of my favorite games and I LOVED the world. 
---
I also got mind blown by every mmo I came across because just the concept of being online with thousands of players in a world, I just couldn't get enough of it.
---
I remember buying frozen rhone for like the 20th time, and inside they had a brochure about WoW and I blew my fucking shit.
---
I think vanilla wow would be a good experience for them. The only thing I really worry about is streamers ruining servers with their army of little zoomers following then everywhere 
---
I plan on doing this on my warlock :)
---
&gt; The claim that warriors / priests are also hybrids is a new phenomenon.
---
so much this.  
---
everytime I read or hear someone making that claim I instantly think they did not play vanilla.
---
Such replies will get you nowhere, son. You'll only make yourself look like an ass. Ignore the comment and move on.
---
I'm not pro-change per se, but I thought this was an interesting idea. Is there any server out there that has toyed around with this? I've always wondered where class design ends and gear begin when it comes to certain specs not performing as well as others.
---
I kinda wish they'd add some sort of fun server or PTR where they would try this stuff out just for funsies. Wouldn't necessarily want to see it in the actual game, not all of us found the class/spec balance problematic or in need of "fixing" but I do think it would be an interesting area to explore somehow.
---
I feel like this is something that's at least been theorycrafted at some point though.
---
Nope wrong. Here is proof, http://bfrontz.net/Nostalrius_post_mortem.pdf , page 29 is server population over time. You can see it is nowhere near 16k, at best 13 in some odd times.
---
Desolace and Ashzara (I think?). I was horde on Arthas first and it was something like 2:1 Alliance so questing in the good questing zones was just asking to be corpse camped. So I did like 5 or 6 levels grinding centaurs in Desolace and I think I did 52-60 on Furlbogs in Ashzara.
---
If this was a thing it was before the 1.5 patch in 2005. I started in early 2005 a bit before 1.5 dropped and one of my first memories of the game was telling people to stop killing my mobs thinking they were stealing XP this way. This was due to another MMO I'd tried out a little before where that was a thing. My guild/irl friends informed me that this was not a thing in WoW.
---
Maybe it was in the beta, or maybe an earlier bug?
---
Meaning it takes forever to gear up :/
---
Age isn’t always going to reflect what type of person someone is. Old liberals and conservatives can be just as off putting as young ones. 
---
If you don’t want to play with certain types of people don’t. Just like in real life sometimes you will encounter people you don’t like. Be polite but you aren’t required to spend more time around them than needed just cause it’s an mmo. 
---
If you don’t enjoy someone’s banter ignore them, that’s what it’s for. If you didn’t enjoy the way the person was in group, ignore them too.
---
Tanks are in high demand for five mans, but you only need a few for a raid. I guess if you go feral and can switch to cat in a raid that would work ok. 
---
I agree, except they're definitely a light gray on the spectrum. They did riot against Stormwind, destroying property and killing innocent people.
---
I can see why they did what they did, but they aren't good or blameless in the situation.
---
At least if you need to change guild etc you'll have an easy time finding a place.
---
My most stand-out, memorable zones are Durotar, Tanaris, Zul Farrak, Sunken Temple, and Scarlet Monastery. I played Orc and Troll hunters so I spent a lot of time in Durotar. ZF, ST, and SM were my favorite instances. Tanaris was one of my favorite zones.
---
Yep.  You become the best 3rd tank for raids since you can swap to kitty, or pop out and help decurse so mages can dps.
---
Wait what? Ele/Resto Hybrid spec is godlike in wPvP.
---
That sounds like a pretty good idea! It might be a bit like trust-based flexitime at work though, where most people actually seem to work a lot more than in the usual 9-5 job. So I guess the willingness to actually spec raid-friendly would still be pretty high.
---
They most certainly can. In fact, their higher threat generation makes them arguably a better tank in many situations than a warrior. A lot depends on not the Druid's gear but rather the gear on the rest of the raid. Once you reach higher tiers of gear (AQ40 and Naxx) healers can heal you through pretty much anything, so crushing blows and crits aren't an issue, and DPS have such insane damage that your biggest challenge is just holding threat, not mitigating damage. And druids, with their multiplicative threat, are straight up better at that on single targets. 
---
meanwhile yesterday trying to find ONE f'ing dd for sm for 1h. no success -.-
---
Really enjoying your videos so far, the SM one was great.  As someone who never really kept up with the lore during or after vanilla it's interesting to hear these details that I had no idea/forgot about.  Suddenly it makes sense why there's peasants in the defias.  Keep it up!
---
Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't think that's a single sentence...
---
"making epics that were worse than greens"

Apart from a really few shitty epic, i will say it depends of the situation. Yes green with +frost/fire/shadow damage can be better than t1 for maximum dps in raid. But for pvp or farming t1 is better.
---
It seems crazy to me that the devs neglected to put in a simple hard cap on dodge. Maybe the idea was that you should indeed be able to become invincible via dodging, but only for a limited amount of time, e. g. while evasion is active?
---
"What's a CC?!"
---
Yeah some people are in for a rough ride. I really like tanking low-level dungeons, but raids is too intense for me. I prefer just slouching back in my chair shooting shadowbolts and bitching about the mages in the warlock channel :D
---
One of the reasons why I don't particularly like AQ and Naxx is how focused you have to be to do them. 
---
They can't gank you if they can't see you.
---
Lets see another class solo kill dozens of level 60 mobs at once.
---
Yeah i absolutely love healing, i liked wpvp as a mage but when it came to pve i was so bored.
---
Benediction is a big draw for me, i would love to do that quest line.
---
Is priest pvp interesting at all or pretty faceroll?
---
They are absolutely fine to Tank 5 man dungeons, and like you said you can use them to AoE farm in the Western Plaguelands Crypt and eventually in Dire Maul for decent money. Then you can transition into Holy for raiding and PvP, but still able to Tank 5 mans if you need it. I did this on a pserver and had a blast
---
&gt;Maturity has nothing to do with age I have discovered.
---
This. You could be a chill 15 year old, or a 35 year old rage-baby.
---
In any game with the trinity, tanking is by far the most fun and interactive, so much better and less mindless than DPS or healing. change my mind
---
Only did the first boss ever in AQ 40, and never stepped foot in real Naxx.  I honestly might come back for Classic just cause that was the version of the game I enjoyed the most.  I have no problem camping the slime cave to sell the pet to get money for my epic mount the second time around.
---
I really want to play a warlock for pvp this time, but i'm afraid of the wait time for dungeon. I have always played tank.
---
And the suddenly:
---
Tank:"TANK LFG SCHOLO"
---
Me:*sends invite*
---
My character: They can't join our group.
---
Tank:*already in other party*
---
other party on LFG: "LF3M Scholo, need heal and dps"
---
my party heal:"Sorry I go with the other group"
---
me:"Fuck that Karen, just don't my dps with yo..."
---
dps:*leaves too*
---
me:"I think I miss the retail LFG, but I don't..."
---
thats it, im rolling a hunter
---
Wow, so cool!
---
Personally, I dislike his low tempo and his points, which probably reach an average on the IQ scale. It's not that he's stupid, it's that he realizes that a slow, monotonous, "feel good" with mundane ideas spread out in long vids with lots of fluff is perfect for your average weed smoker. Or just someone who got home after a rough day. Gonna watch the vid now :-P
---
you kids want this to be true so bad. but it’s not. downvote away. i don’t want someone in my raid doing 50% the dps of everyone else. once you wipe 10 times you’ll want to start clearing out the dead weight too. Holy pallys can buff. 
---
If it’s already on farm and you want to gear your alt, go nuts. 
---
You just tell people that you dont talk politics or religion. It's bad for business.
---
That's taking the high road. And you let them know that is the high road, just to let them know you are better then them.
---
Publicly admitting to liking Tips is pretty risky in this sub :-D FTR I enjoy most of his stuff too.
---
Guessing classic success is big question mark for them. Most successful MMO ever going to be brought back, this will put to test audience involvement. I can only judge myself - but my quit &amp; comeback scheme matched each expansions quality vocally judged by community. 
---
And I'm stoked for Classic like I was for Vanilla, mostly not because it's "best game in 2019", "PC Gamer 10/10",  but because for myself I see other alternative as utter shit and feel sahara-level drought in listed 2019 games that could match gameplay to my desire. Probably same feeling will experiance kids with battle royale in 3-5 years when it die off...hopefully sooner.
---
I'll kill you from the shadows.
---
Yes and no - his guides aim at the highest ambition players. For example, his mage guide goes into much detail on aoe grinding. Having leveled a few mages, I can tell you that grind spots are very contested. So in other words, his guides are aimed at the top 10%, but the plebs will watch it too, dreaming that they are that good. Sometimes, it is nice to dream.
---
Once you return later to dungeons due to a various of reasons, warrior is simply the most fun. Phat twohander, some hitgear and rest tank gear is just so, so, so much fun.
---
Without evidence? I don't know which topic you've been reading. If you had leveled as sub and as combat you'd know what I'm talking about.
---
I raided naxx at like 13. I think its fine. 
---
Ventrillo may you RIP.
---
PvP it is dispel. If you let a druid use NS, then you failed at your job.
---
Dude honest advice from priest player if u want to play priest as a dps role and dont enjoy healing at all roll warlock easier to lvl free mount underrepresented (alliance) , people will love u for summons , usefull curses, fancy pets and pretty good dmg in T3.
---
:(
---
Ugh, as a warlock I fucking hate Skeram. Bad luck and he teleports while a shadowbolt is mid-air meaning it will hit immediately after the aggro reset and he'll absolutely murder you with earth shocks. 
---
But that's also a crazy thing with vanilla; the first boss of a new raid is really really hard. Firemaw, Ebonroc and Flamegor are baby bosses compared to Razorgore and Vael. Skeram will murder you while Sartura, Bug Trio and Fankriss are easy mode. Even Huhuran is pretty easy as long as you have the NR equipped melee, same with Twin Emperors and warlocks. Razuvius is arguably harder than the entire Spider Wing, depending on how good your priests are. There are no "gift bosses" in vanilla.
---
That's not true 
---
Well normally you wouldnt have 4-5 seperate 5 man grps with stragglers going in and out of there at once. With that high of a population, there was technically a need for that many ogres, since there was *a lot* of people it had to compensate for.
---
This is so true. Warrior tanks are the most desired class in groups by far.
---
Remember kids, 3 DPS looking for healer and tank aren't LFM, they are LFG!
---
You like efficiency? You dont want to get declined because of "meme-specing"? Hate those long walks?
---
Do you like to do big dick damage?!
---
Mage is here for you. With a decent enough leveling experience. Its no problem you are oom after 2 mobs because the water is free! LF1M DPS SM GY! Whisper that guy  teleport to undercity  clear the dungeon while being top dps. Water and food for everyone so everyone loves you! Gets your shiny blues and heartstone right back into your quest area!
---
But thats not all.. nono there is more..
---
You are high as fuck watching some youtube spongebob funny moments and suddently...
---
Ca$hing! A free gold. Because some guy wants you to click on a button.. 5 minutes later Ca$hing! Some warrior wants some food.
---
So if you love big damage, free gold and fast travel pick mage.
---
If you hate being a meme, hate to get pushed into healing spec or hate to tank? Pick mage.
---
Ps: please dont pick mage we all know its tanks and healers we need... im already a mage...

You can read here comments from 2006, its 8% increase.

I also played WoW with my Dad, he’s the one who showed it to me. He transitioned from UO to WoW with a work friend of his, but my Dad was so cheap he told his friend he’d only play if he bought him the game and the sub, so my dads friend did. I started playing when I was about 10, and with my dad in the Navy he was gone a lot so I would play his max level warrior when he was gone to farm for my level 46 hunter. I’ll never forget things like getting gold for my birthday, or my first epic drop in Tanaris. 
---
You should look into the way hit chance works against mobs at your level and higher before you try to talk about mechanics in the game you clearly don't understand.  
---
Further more the 50% I mentioned was hyperbolic, but then again I shouldn't have expected that to be clear to someone who swears by leveling a rogue as hemo in vanilla.  
---
&gt; 1.5 years from 1.9 to mop  
---
1.9 to mop is def not 1.5 years. I don't know what drugs you're taking but I'd love to try them.  
---
&gt; It's better to experiment than blindly follow guides. For levelling I take 3/3 setup instead of improved sap and love it.  
---
I don't understand what the first sentence has to do with the second one other than it showing how little experience you actually have.  
---
Come to think of it, most of the shit you've said is nonsensical anyway.  
---
Instead of wasting your time leveling a rogue in vanilla with a sub optimal specc, you should consider investing your time in reading a book or 10.
---
Not me. If I am going to raid, it ain't for fun, but to get shit done. That makes it fun. Beating up trash mobs isn't fun par se, been there done that. My vanilla priest was excalted with the waterlords, yet has never downed more than one boss of BWL. That is not fun. This should not contract from you having fun with your meme guild, which will attract every single ret pala, shadow priest and moonkin of the server, all those who were rejected by the other guilds. Best of luck
---
&gt;The goal is to drive all, or most, traffic through capital cities but **some players feel that eliminating these portals takes away convenience in travel** to older locations for farming mogs and mounts.
---
Always keep in mind that retail players are the huge majority in any social forum about Classic WoW, and will be the majority of the active playerbase in Classic at least at launch.
---
When I raided as 14 year old I acted like I was 25. Now Im 25 and I act like Im 14.
---
Both are fine.
---
This is too accurate...
---
All of this!
---
Random hunter who just joined group "Are you even trying to find a tank I have like 40 minutes"
---
Rofl yeah that is a good name for that guild, it says everything. You'll be providing a steady income of MC mats, but never get the score of the likes of Neffie, because you ... don't care to put in the time.... his loot is not that great (for you bcs u have full MC epics).
---
except for all the bosses druids can tank
---
I think all the Classic-oriented content creators focusing so heavily on mechanics and meta is really unfortunate. When I'm thinking of making a new character I really couldn't give a rat's ass about how the racials stack up or how well the class will perform in Naxx; I just want to know how the tauren fit into the world of Azeroth, what nifty things I get to look forward to doing as a druid, etc.
---
Having a solid handle on the technical end of things is great, to be sure, but so much of the appeal of a well-crafted RPG is in the lore and the fantasy of the world building. Focusing on the former at the extent of the latter is really doing the game a disservice.
---
when i used to mine on my pally i would get to a node and be like oh shit a mob aggroed me i gotta kill it before i can mine...fuck fuck fuck what if someone comes? and sure enough they do
---
then i farmed on my rogue and hunter and got to see the delight in someone trying to take your node when youre standing there fighting a mob on top of it and then you just drop aggro and get to mine it while the mob runs off and smacks the other dude
---
its too early, you'll probably see some ads 2-3 months before release.
---
If its druid or mage and you want to dps.
---
The awnser is mage.
---
i seem to remember rogues tanking gruuls in BC
---
Thank you. 
---
Oh shit just remembered you have to fight paladins too. Hammer of justice or whatever it's called, 5 second stun / autolose if no trinket. ORC!
---
Only go pally if you want to heal, if you want to tank or dps you'd be better of going warrior.
---
Thats sugarcoating the tank role. Sure, dungeons with big trash packs are not fun as a warrior, but raids...
---
You pretty much only tank one target and smash the buttons in priority. Instead of interupt you taunt. Tank the target in a fixed spot. 
---
LF Heals UBRS have key
---
Yeah it's a joke after vanilla. Because the lvl 61 or 71 green gear is so much better than the previous endgame gear, there's a stupid power spike. That + flying ruined the fun and longevity of open world pvp permanently. Bfa made it better but fighting a 120 even as a 117 is hopeless. 
---
Has anybody ever been able to decide because of one of these videos?
---
As a 12 year long elemental shaman main. It was a hars pill to swallow to not roll it again. Im planning on raiding on a semi-seriues level so I had to roll a "meta" class. Mage it was because of the many qol extras. And also good for gold farming aswell.
---
&gt; for really shit priests I advice to bind dispel to the S key.  
---
everytime they try to backpeddle they will do something useful instead. 
---
:DDD
---
totally agreed! some class combination are simply useless in vanilla!
---
I let my younger brother play on my account. He was probably 9 or so at the time. At some point he mentioned how I must be really good since I'm level 60 and he cant even kill the level 25 monsters. I asked if I could check out his character.
---
He was a level 25 Tauren Warrior with all white gear trying to grind on level 20 mobs because he couldn't fight a mob close to even level without dying. 
---
I felt so bad for not being more involved for him and explained what greens and blues were. Shortly thereafter with about 100g from my main he became a Twink Terror and spent the rest of his Vanilla days as such.
---
Do you wanna deop totems and heal, t
---
Interrupt and go very fast oom if you twist totems for dps or do you wanna become a faerie fire bot as the only reason they bring you as well with soothes. :p good friday mate
---
Hello everyone . 
---
\- Intended region : EU
---
\- Intended server type : PvP or Normal
---
\- Intended faction : open for both
---
\-  Intended raid/play times : 8-14ish Central European Time (CET) // I work nightshifts 
---
\-  Any priority you may have in a guild : I would be happy to find a guild that has an active playerbase at this time of the day. Iam also very interested in raiding on a regular basis even multiple times a week as well as 5mans and other stuff.
---
\- Any pertinent rules : Iam limited to english or german servers since i dont speak any more languages "fluent" enough, a multinational guild would be very interesting though (as long english is spoken)... but since we dont know how the server will be set up this might not even be relevant. 
---
\- A preferred form of contact : PM 
---
1) Rush to the endgame in 2 weeks.
---
2) Farm all the stuff and roflstomp first raid in 2 more weeks.
---
3) Start creating dozens of topics about "How Blizz can expand Classic? There is no content and the game is dying!"
---
4) Quit because no new content arrives for a long time.
---
5) ???
---
6) Profit.
---
1.5 years between 1.9 and mop is the /played time as a rogue.
---
No guides recommend taking setup over imp. sap yet the benefits of a steady stream of cps over a 90% chance for sap to not drop stealth are obvious for levelling.
---
Hate: paladin, warrior, druid
---
Love: shaman ,mage, rogue.
---
All in order.
---
Its a 20 hit charge with a timer 1.12
---
Ele Shaman Tank signing up.
---
Elemental damage is fine for 20 seconds. Than they are oom.
---
Are you sure it wasn't a bag?
---
Try being a Bear Tank with 7 Ret Pallies, 4 Cat Druids, 5 Shadow Priests, 3 Mages, 2 Rogues, and 3 DPS Warriors as your artillery. And you can be crushed, so while you have alot of health you are also straining the few healers that dont have enough gear to go DPS spec, since why would I join a meme guild if I wanted to heal.
---
Downvote away. I just explained why this wont work.
---
Priest: Best healer. 
---
rogue: they can't say no when they're stunned
---
Probably it was me, who has created that thread.
---
I've only found few profiles from Merc keyboard, that's not very helpful.
---
Maybe current thread may be more useful.
---
The argument seems to be less upset about he removal for concinience but more for the reasons behind it. BFA is losing subs so they’re artificially increasing the time it takes to do things bucks removing portals that have been present for years.
---
Definitely not a bag, I specifically remember it because it gave you +agility or similar and I never saw another item like that again.
---
Frost mage baiting in mid rather than acquiring, escorting, or defending your FC?
---
THONK
---
Im switch sides for the race. I am alliance since wotlk but i want to be an ud rogue
---
Green cookies for everyone.
---
No decent guide will recommend you going hemo over combat. 
---
Too strong a word, my bad. What I mean is that if I'm ever doing trib I am absolutely respeccing for imp FD. Losing a run right near the end from a fd resist is a disgusting feeling.
---
Doesn't mean he isn't S tier. I'm pretty casual but, imo, his content is better than Frosts, even if I'm not going to be at the level to utilize it fully. My S tier is Mad and Kargoz. Nice blend of casual and try hard
---
That's more if you're into wpvp than leveling fast. There's nothing braindead about BM if you're optimising it.
---
Maybe that's the appeal, I'm just thinking about the wanding pve grind.
---
The player spamming is always a fury Warrior. 
---
Not really.  I just like the horde too much to switch.  I spent half of Vanilla playing the alliance because the first orc warrior I created died so many times I gave up trying to finish the starting zone.  Man warriors sucked so much at launch.  So I played an alliance mage for the first year.
---
It was about a year into Vanilla when my guild I'd help build crumbled that I decide to try a horde warrior again and I had so much fun that I just stayed horde.
---
&gt;How do the lore and quests compare between horde and alliance?
---
Lore and quest wise the alliance is better.  Nothing quite as cool as jailbreak on the horde.  The questing on the horde side has fewer story arcs connected to the major cities but I find I generally find horde questing more interesting due to the people I interact with. 
---
Also I grew to hate people who play gnomes. Every person who I knew who rolled a gnome alliance side was a prick.  I had so much fun murdering them left and right on the horde.  Warms my heart every time I hear the gnome death sound.
---
[Lêğöłäs]: My pet can tank, inv pls
---
We had a bear tank for several BWL fights and for trash pulls
---
I did not say that you said OG vanilla players were PvP gods? I said people in comments claim to have played like gods (without any proof being the key issue).
---
Regarding movement, you said back then people weren't retarded just less knowledgeable which has an implicit claim that there were 2 groups of players, retards who could not move properly and people who could but lacked knowledge. My contention is that this is just not true, even the old top players were lacking in the movement department. 
---
It's context and proof, not a brag. 
---
I guess it's my mistake for engaging in the comment section but I just can't believe people are accurately remembering or representing their Vanilla experience considering something like only %0.0004 of players finished Naxx.  
---
I could be wrong, maybe you played on an amazing server PvP wise and maybe you are only talking about the end of 2006 so perhaps you did see plenty of skilled players in Vanilla. I did not.  
---
Enchanted white-quality items can be traded. You can enchant a low lvl dagger with agility and use it for alts etc.
---
I've lost count of all the UBRS runs I did as a DPS warrior when I had some BWL/ZG gear.  2h tanking is super fun and super fast if your healer is on top of it and you have enough stam to buffer the crushing blows/crits.
---
Could it have been a white quality item that had a player enchant on it?  AFAIK all green or above items bind as you equip them
---
You will love leveling a warrior with a priest.  A friend of mine leveled a NE Warrior/Priest combo with his brother.  They cut through PvE like a hot knife through butter and owned people in PvP.  I don't they think they ever made it to 60, but they had a lot of fun.
---
I played alliance like always. I had a shaman lvl24 a few months ago but thats about it.
---
Lok tar ogar this Summer. I also plan to run a guild and i recruit friends i know in real life 
---
Teldrassil (and Mulgore). They both capture that nostalgic feeling and have the most amazing scenery!
---
I can’t wait to watch dumb dps die again.
---
I
---
Perhaps it was a white dagger with high tier enchant. 
---
I burn and I plunder as it suits my desire, the weapon of my choice is great balls of fire.
---
This is probably the worst spec I've ever seen. Does meme spec just mean that the spec is done with no understanding of the class? Jesus Christ.
---
As a tank my thought process is :
---
1. Dps is always easy to find.
---
2. I always have healer friends
---
3. I don’t indulge shit talkers I just let them die from their own mistakes
---
I think I've finally decided to play Lock. I had a lock back pre-BC that I never really finished. It would be nice to try it all again.
---
Its the other way around tho
---
Priest: pathetic version of affliction.  
---
Mage: pathetic version of destruction.  
---
Hunter: pathetic version of demology.  
---
Warlocks rock! 
---
Thanks, now I'll definitely play it
---
You get to kill ERPers in Goldshire with your Doomguard/Infernal
---
Beating Kel'Thuzad and getting Grand Marshal? I guess
---
Imagine you went through all that effort and then another alliance player trolled you by using his mind control cap on Saurfang to promptly one shot your meticulously buffed warrior.
---
Agreed his production value and research is very good. I do prefer the videos to be more ambiguous though, as I want newer players to enjoy it the same way we veterans did - learning on our own. Madseason's videos are good for preserving this aspect.
---
Because on paper combat is superior, but the difference doesn't seem particularly noticeable especially when you factor in your extra survivability on a pvp server. I'll let you know my /played when classic drops if you want, without BGs/tradeskills to get in the way it shouldn't be too bad. What's the record for a rogue?
---
you can also grind maraudon packs 47 to 53, lotta gold through skinning to be had.
---
Thx !
---
Will do, im happy you liked it!
---
Replaying on a p-server made me a shadow priest Fan.
---
Especially when my Pala was still full green, the shadow could take a lot of pressure off of me with his group heal in dungeons. 
---
I expect 1 shadow in a lot of raids.
---
But like all the hybrids, you will have to work overtime. 
---
Exactly. It’s the second pulls without aoe taunt that if something was to happen it’ll be there. 
---
It’s fine though, I just send vw in bring him back to me a bit so when I start rain of fire on the lashers and they agro pull to me I don’t need to recast RoF. I’ll sack the vw immediately. 
---
Honestly, it’s your mana with no/bad gear that’s the issue. I could only cast RoF 3 times and be totally oom. But they’ll all be dead. 
---
I did test it with a totally naked 60 to help simulate worst case etc. They pull with vw aoe is fine, normal. The pull without, you’ll die, just. 
---
Ok so how I got around the second pull, summon your imp, cast Fire shield on yourself then resummon your vw who you sacked last pull. With the fire shield I found it to be enough to bridge that ‘Just die’ and make it. 
---
From my agro testing, doing three lasher packs, the ones near the walls, 57 was fine, middle ones I messed up a few times, surely with practise though. 
---
Hope this helps 👍
---
UBRS/Scholo/Strat UD/BRD for t .5 set/boss loot, quest at Strat UD for Atiesh
---
Why socialise and talk with people when you can just automate the end result?
---
&gt;  In PVE the opener is usually Garrote, hemo rupture ghostly and then slice and dice. Mobs melt from the bleeds and poisons.
---
couldnt imagine rupture being efficient for leveling / questing. just tried your way yesterday and was impressed how good that works. garotte + 2 cp rupture (optional hemo when only 1 cp) plus autoattacks kill so fast. 
---
Wish my kids would sleep in on weekends too.
---
If its a lowbie, unequip mighty 2hander and punch them once and /no. 
---
If they try to still mine it, the game is on!
---
I think you bring up a point many people are really sleeping on. Vanilla has been theorycrafted to death. We know exactly how to min max every single thing, and there isn't any mystery to uncover.
---
While im ecstatic about playing Classic, so many people will be making decisions not on what they genuinely want to do, but instead on the hardcore meta. 
---
You and 90% of the people.
---
Yeah, nobody in their right mind would farm copper in the Barrens when Durotar is chock-full with mountains and tehrefore of copper.
---
One of the best players and guildmates were 15 year old teens when i have been leading my own guild. Couple of them became my IRL friends later on. So no problem for me at least. It is all about the personality.
---
Prince Nazjak, Broken Tooth, Lupos and many other hunter tamable pets
---
Also the t2 and t3 look dope. 
---
I think the term OP was looking for is more akin to alpha striking.
---
My thoughts the last few weeks have been swaying towards enjoying the journey and the long road. I suppose as a prot warrior finding a guild won't be too bad.
---
As a Shamen you are going to be a Rockstar in the meele group.
---
As a hunter you are just a meme. 
---
Hey mate,
---
After lashers you’ll need to wipe out 2 elite packs before hydro. First ones all satyrs and the next to satyrs with an imp. I reliably soloed both packs naked at 60. 
---
They’re demons, banish one and fear another, vw tanks two. The second pack imo banish or kill the imp first, he is the only dangerous one. 
---
Hydrospawn is a joke, well at least on Private servers. Pull him out of the water in to the space where you’ve cleared those two packs. vw tanks him while you melt him. He spawns two adds that have low hp but are immune to magic. Use your vw to grab them and I wand them. Prioritise the adds as they do this crazy water jet knock around which makes cast vhard and stops wanding. 
---
I did make a route to do hydro and the two next solo but you need to be 60 to skip things or you pull agro and you can’t solo the 4 imp 1 satyr packs without vgood gear. 
---
Gl👍
---
I think I would lose a lot of the nostalgia switching from horde to alliance, and prefer the racials on horde. But since I'm going to have multiple characters on horde, I am starting to wonder if I'm going to be missing out not having one alliance 60. I just feel like I'm missing so much content. I think I leveled an alliance toon to like 29 or something in the past. (like a decade ago)
---
Explain to me how if you hit the instance reset cap it's still slower? 🤔🤔
---
It's not easy to mess up if you're not an ape
---
&gt; Without evidence? I don't know which topic you've been reading. If you had leveled as sub and as combat you'd know what I'm talking about.
---
Dude jfc I'm not saying to go ambush spec or some dumb shit like that. All I'm saying is that when the mob is 
---
A) near your level (ie won't see you in stealth)
---
B) facing the opposite direction
---
C) is not mechanical (immune to bleed)
---
D) doesn't have extremely low hp (caster mobs)
---
then it is worth it to pop in stealth for 0.5 seconds and garrote as your first attack. Everything in this thread implies we're talking about a combat specced rogue.
---
For me too. That't around that time you actually feel you're getting powerful and getting absolutely invested in your character. With the talents, the character really starts to be defined and strong in the way you built it. Also the loot around this level can be awesome.
---
IDK why, but ZF feels like the first "big boy" dungeon.
---
And, Tanaris is just awesome, chill zone.
---
Hey, my hunter pet can tank too. That makes hunters hybrids too :)
---
Yeah i pretty much agree. However the  original instigators are clear. Killing innocent SW citizens isn't justified, but it also wasn't the goal of the original riots either. 
---
Starts to get dicey morally when hypothetically elevating the collateral damage of justified outrage against the original crime that started it all.
---
Are you my twin?

The transition from Tirisfal Glades, to Silverpine Forest and Hillsbrad Foothills is very nostalgic for me. I enjoyed the dark theme of the zones. Back in vanilla it was a refreshing change from playing the typical heroic goody-two-shoes champion that every other game at that time seemed to cast you as. The excitement of stepping foot into Hillsbrad for the first time, knowing I was it was my first contested territory, was thrilling. I lived for world PVP and I'm glad I picked Horde.
---
a memespec guild will not kill Twin emps, Ouro, C'thun. They might kill 5 or so of the easier bosses in Naxx.
---
Honestly, as long as you are not fighting elite mobs having even a single other semi-competent player around makes most areas easy and it becomes trivial if there's 3 or more players. Although there is amazing synergy to be had between certain classes. Enemies generally don't benefit from diminished returns, so it's easy for example to permanently stun lock a target with 2 rogues.
---
One of the best benefits of having a party is increased scouting. When you are looking for a particular quest patrol for instance, it's much faster when you cannot split up and then reconverge.
---
You can do pve as combat swords.
---
When it comes to pvp you have to respec to hemo and prep with sword. Or you are just a losing feeding factory.
---
Alternatively you can just get all the weapons and do all the specs and see which you like. Just stick with what your weapons are geared towards. And what is most fun.
---
Combat daggers is also viable raid spec
---
Glad you enjoyed them man, more on the way!
---
They sure do.
---
Now im trying to think what kinda build i wanna play with and what kinda armor/sets would be good
---
I tend to have trouble on the big Satyr pack, never could quite manage it. Will give it a try, tyvm for the info.
---
I’ve played a lot of mmos in my days and by far when it comes to pvp rewards vanilla wow is the worst. You can be hardcore without having to PvP 10 hours a day. 
---
Hell no. Can't stand that LokTar circle jerk here and in the retail wow subreddit.
---
Owl is a meme, cat is wayyy faster. 
---
You know whats the funniest thing about this conversation?  
---
The focal point of your argument is pvp, and yet combat is actually better for low lvl pvp. Which is something you'd know if you had actually played the game.  
---
Keep on theory crafting though. We need people to laugh at every now and then.
---
God that dude annoys me 
---
You’re right, with that set-up you can run into some trouble. But Bear tanks being «meme»-tanks is just straight up a lie. Sure. You got the whole ‘crushing’ thing but generally they have the greatest tps in the game for tanks and have a way better time in resistance fights.
---
This is the decision that's constantly on my mind. I was a hard-core alliance fanboy from the very beginning (Well about 2 months after vanilla release) and I absolutely hated the horde. The atmosphere back then and the way people talked about the other faction... It was like they weren't even people behind the characters. The tension between horde and alliance was a real thing! I really hated them.
---
But now that I've matured and I know a lot more about the Horde, and having played horde for a lot of the more recent expacs, I'm really tempted to switch. 
---
However... I've tested it on pserver and it just feels so WRONG! I don't feel like I could stick to a horde character..   guess I'm just an alliance boi at heart.
---
Not an enchant as you get that info in the tooltip when you hover over the item, unless it was somehow bugged and the tooltip concealed its origin.
---
 **Force Reactive Disk.**  
---
With that shield, you're good to tank almost every dungeons :D  
---
I know, it's just a throwaway meme, so don't take it seriously. But Classic is not a "HD remake". It'll have the original graphics.
---
Very nice guide. Madseaoson got such a relax voice and good content. 
---
Better stealth + faster stealth + extra vanishes = more wpvp avoided. I've played the game and I'm playing the game.
---
Unrelated to wow, but why are you so stroppy and rude?
---
In MC maybe.. but most bosses require tank swaps and few of them are tauntable. You have much more abilities to use; sunder armor, shield block, revenge, heroic strike, shield bash and your cooldowns. Then you have things like stance dancing, kiting without turning your back on the mob, pushing out enough TPS while still being able to absorb the damage, know when to use a cooldown or a pot, stand in the right position and if someone gets aggro, pull the boss back to the same position which can be really hard. 
---
Quite a different story to just pressing your shadowbolt/frostbolt while moving out of the fire once in a while.
---
How long does it take to masterbate?
---
&gt; A) near your level (ie won't see you in stealth)
---
If by near you mean below your level, yes.
---
&gt; B) facing the opposite direction
---
So you're going to spend energy on distract, wait to recoup energy then spend more energy on garrote. You do realize that the kill time on a mob is not the only thing that matters right?
---
&gt; C) is not mechanical (immune to bleed)
---
&gt; D) doesn't have extremely low hp (caster mobs)
---
&gt; then it is worth it to pop in stealth for 0.5 seconds and garrote as your first attack. Everything in this thread implies we're talking about a combat specced rogue.
---
Anything else you wanna add to that shopping list?  
---
Also it doesn't take 0.5 seconds. You cant enter stealth in combat. You need to enter stealth before you aggro the mob. Also, your stealth speed without camo is abysmal.
---
With those conjured mana bottles lol
---
Are guns just very advanced crossbows?
---
And thunderfury.
---
Yeah play horde on pserver and alliance in classic.
---
I used to hate the zone. It looked ugly and I always immatined walking down a damp lake in Washington when I was in that zone.
---
Then I decided to read the quest text. It is now my favorite.
---
Both, 10 min and 20 hit charge.
---
You'll want to refresh it pretty quick if you get a rogue or a hunt on your ass.
---
Doomguards and infernals.
---
While I agree with your choice of class, I think that's more than on sentence.
---
Dps troll. 
---
Knowing what rank is to high for shadow priests.
---
I play Pvp spriest and have all of my ranks of mind flay bound so I can have max uptime in a fight. Your mana should run out when the enemy team dies, not before or after. 
---
Mage: Have other people pay YOU to use your spells!
---
Just take it easy man. Why rush? 
---
Enjoy the journey. 
---
Awsering before reading the question... thats why I failed om school and reddit. Oops
---
No, healer don't want the ability to dps.
---
With priest disc(holy is pve spec), you want to mana burn, dispell, silence(if tri spec), and heal. So spell power isn't important and you'll prefer to stack healing.
---
However you need the pvp stuff for the stam, so you'll roll with that and add as much healing as you can on your other pieces.
---
Stance dancing is the reason why I quit warrior in wotlk... It was not as rewarding to stance dance. 
---
Stance dance is great. Requires a lot of skill and awareness to do it right. 
---
+3% (?) Pet damage Vs the ability to hold aggro on multiple mobs and aoe reduce incoming damage. Your cat is a meme! 
---
I'm going for the fury / prot hybrid. Enough to survive the open world at a decent speed, good enough for dungeon tanking and even off-tank raid tanking. 
---
There’s no reason to advertise for an old game that is returning with no changes this far in advance. 
---
Also, Blizzard is cutting costs, so that’s another reason why they aren’t at this moment.
---
Lastly, when they do decide to start advertising (which they will), they will market it as “Experience the online phenomena that took the world by storm “ and “Experience the beginnings of the record breaking MMOPRG that changed the world “ and “Get addicted all over again”
---
Don’t let your love for Classic/Vanilla get in way of the fact that the video game landscape is different. MMOS aren’t hot like they once were. There are tons of new, big, and hot upcoming games that players of today are looking forward to and will complete with WoW in regards to money and attention.  So advertising at the right time the right way is very important.
---
&gt; Better stealth + faster stealth + extra vanishes = more wpvp avoided  
---
Oh you're trying to avoid pvp. Riiight, now it makes sense.  
---
Your logic is still flawed.  
---
Fighting NPCs (as I'm doing right now) is the most time consuming thing you'll be doing while leveling. Meaning that overall, you're better off as Combat. Even if you get ganked a handful of times. Furthermore having endurance, imp sprint and dps increasing CDS allow you to take fights, instead of poping vanish like a rat and hoping that it doesn't bug out.  
---
&gt; Unrelated to wow, but why are you so stroppy and rude?
---
In  this case? I dislike people who give bad recommendations, based on some bs they, or someone they know or watched, theory crafted.
---
Call me Jon Snow
---
Post removed per Rules #1 (content must relate to Classic WoW). Sorry for the inconvenience.
---
If you call totem management a con and not a pro 
---
Druid is better for you.
---
In theory I'm all for it, and I'll probably play a memespec myself, but in practice I know what "casual" and "meme-friendly" means in a guild context. You just end up with half the raid playing abysmal and when confronted about it they go "haha it's just a game bro". 
---
I always tried to play one of the lesser played race/class combinations, that's why I ended up with a dwarf priest that later had to undergo a sex change. 
---
Being one of the thousand UD rogues on my server just isn't so appealing to me.
---
In Pve(raid) : it's your ability to use the right rank at the right time, to not overheal and save as much mana as you can.
---
Depending on your assignement it can vary a bit (tank or raid). If you're on raid healing, you need to have a very good understanding of the fight so you can use shield in timely manner and quick heal the ones who need it first to keep people alive.
---
In Pvp : It's your ability to dispell(both offensive and defensive)the right target at the right time, use mana burn when you can  , survive/kite anything that aggro you, while obviously keeping people alive.
---
Yellow mobs are still decently easy to garrote as long as their AI doesn't randomly turn them into you as you're approaching. So +2 levels.
---
No distract. Not needed. Run forward, jump, stealth as you are jumping (to preserve momentum from your walk speed), and if you've gotten lucky with the mob's position he was turned around and didn't aggro onto you, and can now be garroted. If he spots you as you run up to it then it's no big deal, just SS and do your normal thing.
---
I played both sides quiet a bit. But I never really joined an active guild on horde side so I wasn't too involved and mostly solo levelled.
---
Alliance has it's charme and I really liked a lot of the quest lines.
---
So the Barrens is barren? Who would have thunk it.
---
My final decision might be influenced by what some real life friends decide to roll. My best times in WoW were on alliance side and I'm super curious if that could be reproduced on horde...
---
Whoa, huge slant on weed smokers out of nowhere. This aggression will not stand man 
---
I enjoy the extremely occasional tips video to hype me for classic.  I can not stand his content and I cringe when I pay attention to his actual gameplay.  Seriously for a guy who mains warrior he causes way too many wipes and nasty pulls.
---
I can always appreciate his attitude though.  He just seems to have a true giddiness and childlike glee about classic that reminds me of how I felt about it back in the day while playing.
---
If you are a top-end min-maxer pick troll. If not pick what looks best.
---
The diffrence as troll in pve is minor.
---
The diffrence ad undead in pvp is major.
---
Not sure but I remember for almost every guild that was 1/12(or whatever naxx was) or 2/12 in naxx the bosses were anub + raz.  Then it generally was followed by Faerlina then either first boss in plague or Maex.  Raz may have been a "technical" fight but thanks to the MC mechanics it removed a lot of the difficulty/gear requirement for most of the classes and just shouldered it on having a few priests who knew what to do.
---
You do realize that this is not retail and that Garrote actually requires you to be behind the target right?
---
Simply starting in Durotar, and hearing the music for the first time again will be amazing.
---
Same for the Barrens or Ashenvale
---
I don't have any irl friends that still play :( *forever alone* 
---
&lt;3 You're welcome to the nostalgia trip :D
---
Switching to alliance. Rolling a dwarf warrior. I'm going to name him my name because I'm too old to want to be called anything different. I've never actually seen Ironforge before. Not even in a video. That's how new to alliance I'll be.
---
or a ret
---
Well the socialization isn't the part where you spam trade chat non stop, the socialization comes in when you get a reply and that's the whole point of a premade group finder.
---
You list your group once and then you talk to the people who wants to join your group. It simply moves the chat spam to a GUI, the dialogue still remains.
---
When I first started out I played alone too.
---
And I made a ton of friends online and some became real life friends down the road.
---
That's the beauty of WoW for me!
---
Is this on NA or EU? Cus I’m down af if it’a on EU servers!
---
the same way i always have
---
unless its an issue i wont make it one
---
i played everquest back in 1999 as a 14 year old and i remember lying about my age and faking it just to play with older people and im sure they knew something was up but i just kept the immaturity to a minimum and tried to be a good player
---
hell...im far more inattentive and harder to deal with @ 35 then i was at 15
---
I'm going to break this down into steps because you're not reading what I'm typing.
---
Step 1. Walk up to the mob.
---
Step 2. If the mob is turned away from you, keep walking as close as you can without aggroing it.
---
Step 3. Attempt to go in stealth.
---
Step 4. If you're in stealth and the mob is still turned around, garrote. Otherwise sinister strike. 
---
yeah...every guild im in has to have a "no politics" rule (especially in the past 5 years) otherwise it turns into a shit show
---
Priorities for healing gear as a priest are stamina, healing, and armor.  Honestly not sure if picking up extra armor really helped at all though but I think I did have a few pieces I wore because the stamina/armor was good and as a priest sometimes you just need that extra bit of eHP to last through a stun.  Best thing you can do for PvP is just pick someone who is geared/not-an-idiot and healbot them and if able toss out heals to others if you can avoid dying while doing it.
---
But yeah to answer your question you won't be doing DPS.  The only offense you will do is dmg to interrupt a flag cap if necessary, mana burn (especially if horde vs pally), offensive dispells and mind control (mainly at lumber mill, although anywhere with a drop works).
---
I hit rank 14 in vanilla and I think the system is shit. Anyone with any type of life thinks it’s shit. 
---
my first toon was horde
---
then i tried alliance and fell in love with stormwind and ironforge
---
org is cool but alliance has the cooler places for sure
---
I’m fine with playing 2 months straight. What I’m not fine with is playing 2 months straight for 10+ hrs a day.  I played during vanilla and got rank 14 and the system is shit and the only ones defending it are no lifers. 
---
How on earth is Tips A tier? He’s class B for sure. Kargoz should be S tier
---
You aren't the only poster to say this but ... why are alliance needing priests so much more?  Playing as an undead priest in vanilla I would have thought the opposite.  Horde need to purge off a lot of defensive abilities because alliance have paladins but shamans don't really have that many important buffs and druids would be mainly their HoTs?  Meanwhile as a horde priest you are the only defensive dispell so your leet warrior isnt sitting in a 10 sec poly/root/etc when his pvp trinket is on its CD.
---
It probably was a quirky pre-1.12 item that got fixed at some point. I'm quite sure it won't be in classic.
---
OP asked for rotation advice recommendations for levelling as hemo. As I said, it's fine to do so, the /played at 60 won't be radically different.
---
Stop with all the no life crap, enjoy the game, and enjoy your life outside of the game. Keep Wow in moderation.
---
ret pally with ashbringer only reason amma play classic
---
Inconvenience acts as a filter. It is integral to the experience. Too many people don't understand this.
---
&gt;Though I wouldn't put it past blizzard to add dual spec
---
It won't be.
---
I played both in vanilla (through AQ40, did naxx horde only) due to rerolling-to-new-server syndrome.  I personally liked alliance leveling better but all of my PvP queues sucked as alliance and were great as Horde so I am having a hard time picking alliance due to remembering this.  Still not sure what I will do.
---
this is awesome! you're really funny.
---
I read something that Inner Fire at some point in classic gave Melee Attack Power, is that true?
---
omfg this is 110% my gf with her Goldthorns. 
---
Druid last, as expected. 
---
Allow me to introduce you to &lt;Pertento&gt;! At Pertento we happily welcome people with intentions of playing "Meme-specs", we still plan to progress through raids at a good pace. We will be focusing on PvE, but we also have emphasis on the social aspect of the game. We would like for the raiding experience to be epic, fun and engaging, and not just a mindless chore only using cookie-cutter builds, so we allow unpopular specs to be played to circumvent the min-maxing culture. We will be an RP-PvP Guild rolling alliance, we already have a strong community with 160+ members. We have plans for PvP as well as RP events if it fits your fancy! We are very active on our Discord, and new members are always welcome!
---
 Interested? Feel free to DM me asking for an invite and more information! :)
---
Lat spot, UBRS, Tank only, needs to have key. No summons available.
---
I'm going to find myself between Australia and New Zealand in "Summer". Will Oceanic servers be a thing? I played in late 05 and can't remember seeing an option. 
---
I'm not so sure, I mean it didn't work before righteous fury got added, and at that point everyone was used to how warrior tanks worked etc. It took some outside the box thinking to make it work back then and dedication to farm the gear for spec nobody thought viable, but now it's different.  Paladin tank is very viable in dungeons with the patch classic ships with. Sure, you need people who can adjust to a tank which works differently (no taunt, aoe capable) but with the groundwork done by people like Atraira I see paladin tanks becoming more common for 5man content.
---
Druid: Don't run, you'll only die tired. 
---
Yeah good call :) this is a twice in a lifetime opportunity :)
---
Un'goro Crater.
---
Used to farm Elemental Fires for epic mount and did world PvP with my IRL buddy for days.
---
I was being figurative, but I get your point. good advice, thank you :). 
---
Just shows how absolutely broken charge was back then charging to a completely random location at 70% was sure fun as hell
---
I'd be interested. Now then, Arms is not really a meme spec but I'd like to raid in it, never liked Fury or Prot on a Warrior.
---
tell that those 80% warriors who refuse to tank
---
most overplayed class, yet always a lack of tanks :x
---
There is a PvP healing spec that uses all three trees. The mix of Disc/Holy and Shadow are needed to give the best mix of tools. They include improved mana burn, meditation, Martyrdom, Healing Focus, Divine Fury, holy nova and silence.
---
Being able to silence a mage or lock to stop incoming damage is essential, Nova is an instance heal that can't be interrupted and mana burn can screw over lots of classes and can often draw an interrupt leaving you free to heal. 
---
The most important thing though is to find a good warrior in each battle ground that will protect you or even better a IRL warrior friend to play with. The only thing that can stop a warrior priest combo in an even fight is the priest being targeted and the warrior not getting them off. All other healer combos with warrior are beaten by mana burn.
---
De Boots probably from one of the uldaman small bosses. Item that has agility and stamina on it but is not bop or now. Worn running boots.
---
[Yes, that's true.](https://web.archive.org/web/20050206133116/http://thottbot.com/?k=1096)
---
I'm confused, the ex gf in the title and coffee grabbing isn't mentioned anywhere in the post, am I retarded or did I miss something?
---
A bit obscure perhaps, but there's a blue quest reward sword given in EPL (possibly WPL) that the rogue class leader made me get before I was allowed in my first MC raid. Does anyone know what it is?
---
Gonna be fun.  When they realise they have to tank their own dungeons
---
Just level your mage when you and your friend can’t play together. It may end up that your mage makes it to 60 long before your warrior, and you’ll still have a wonderful experience playing with your friend. My two cents
---
Razorgore is such a step up even from Ragnoros, literally everyone in the 40man raid needs to be on point otherwise it's a total shit show. We cleared AQ40 and that was still the fight that took longest for us to master. 
---
"guess I'll need on that to"
---
Although I love Draenei and some of WoWs newer cosmic retcons and fix ups.
---
I have to say, old school WoW lore was a special and sometimes beautiful thing. It's grounded in simplicity but has so much depth to it.
---
Unlike much of WoWs current lore, which can be a little unhinged and soulless.
---
Mirah's Song?
---
nightelf is a race you moron!
---
+80 Raid morale
---
&gt; If you’re unemployed and play wow all day, you’ll hate yourself and be bored pretty swiftly. 
---
Keep telling yourself that. I have nothing against people doing whatever they want, but I am honestly sick of all of you trying to reduce the amount of fun everyone who isn't stuck with children/wives/commitments in real life is going to have to make yourselves feel better. 
---
I swear, it's like half this sub is people who can't own up to their decision to have a family but try to circlejerk that they'll have just as much fun, raid just as much, participate in as many things as anyone who isn't. And it wouldn't bother me if it weren't for the "unlike those min/maxers, those wankers who will probably hate playing 14 hours a day on the weekends, yeah they'll feel so terrible".
---
No, no we won't.
---
&gt;How will you feel about playing with under-18s?
---
The same way my guild felt about me when I was playing classic. I was 17 when classic was released in Europe and joined a guild with mostly people that were 20+. I was basically the oddball. Far more impulsive than others, with far more time on my hand than some of the old timers and got a lot of shit for doing goofy stuff. 
---
As for more important roles in a guild? Age doesn't matter. Remember, there have been and there will be young people who are really good at leadership at a very young age. Alexander the great comes to mind.
---
You don't need to spec in prot until you start raiding. Just carry a shield and a good 1 hander, if you have tanking pieces, throw those on.
---
To clear naxx? Don't burn out in aq40 is the main goal. Maybe farm stacks of GNPPs in advance or something. Get AD rep when you can (stratlive is perfect for warriors), and generally find a good guild to play with. Kinda obvious stuff but still.
---
&gt;Most people who joined WoW wotlk+ probably won't even make it past level 30 once they realize how much harder and different everything was.
---
I hear so many say this and it seems a bit snobbish. So you need to have played vanilla back then to enjoy it now? Essentially that means, despite what all the "vanilla veterans" have preached, that vanilla is only fun for nostalgia.
---
Of course we all know it's *not* just nostalgia, there were a lot of aspects of vanilla that were great. No idea why someone that started WoW later can't enjoy that. Seems a bit elitist.
---
And I'm not saying no one will drop mid-leveling. Of course, Classic is a historical piece of gaming, there will be a ton of people that wants to try it out that will find it's just not their cup of tea, but it has nothing to do with them not having played vanilla. The reason people that *did* play vanilla probably will not have as many that quits is because they already *know* it's their cup of tea. It gives a false perspective to compare.
---
There is a build that is mostly fury / rest prot that is "good enough" for off tanking.
---
It's the easiest spec without respeccing 
---
&gt; why are alliance needing priests so much more?
---
Food geared Warriors with Free action Potion is GG ;)
---
All this "vanilla was hardcore" is honestly not true. Vanilla raids are among the most AFK friendly to ever see WoW. Like retail or not, but it has an *actual* challenge in raids.
---
Vanilla was just gear dependent. Not bashing that style, I do like it somewhat, but it really didn't need much focus. Most bosses have generic abilities in all their phases. Like Onyxia phase one, just position yourself properly and you are pretty much good to go for spamming that frostbolt for quite a long time.
---
I think I remember "The 1 Ring" being a green that was not BOP or BOE, for a while. Then it was made BOE, then it was taken out of the game. (no longer dropped)
---
It was a lvl 10 ring or so with +1 to all stats
---
Elwynn Forest, Ashenvale and Darkshore. I've played horde for like 80% of my WoW time, also on private servers and i don't like any of the alliance races, but... when the thought comes to replay those zones again as i did with my first character who was a human rogue, i get a tingle in my belly. These zones really hits the nostalgia for me.
---
Druids seem to be the "flavor of the week" this week.  I wonder if it has to do with the Druid discussion on countdown to classic podcast. 
---
top comment
---
Ive tanked most content in Vanilla and nowdays with 1.12 talents, all world buffs etc you just hammer as a dw fury tank.
---
Sure, pushing frostbolt is easier but everything up to AQ is basicly tank and spank. 
---
unBEARable
---
kek
---
I'm sure you did, I just know that "hardcore players" wouldn't waste their time doing something inefficient if they can help it.
---
How are DLC a problem? Oh noooo, new content for the game - the horrors!
---
The problem is when someone like EA decides a DLC should cost the same as the core game. If only there were a company that didn't do that *\*cough\** *CD Projekt Red \*cough\*.*
---
I feel you man. I'm an old shaman too, who was also too young to understand the meta, who is also drawn back to the shaman class. Even though I'll probably get to 60 and look around longingly at the OP dps classes around me. 
---
Healing is more then that. Someone who spam heals runs out of mana. It's about constantly moving so the heal doesn't go of until its needed. And be prepared for when the tank takes a crit
---
way to move the goal post
---
Personally I think it'll be hilarious to see just how much modern WoW stuff can be emulated by addons, but in an interview, one of the devs clearly said that they will certainly block any addon behavior that attempts to do exactly what you said.  So oh well.
---
&gt;we dominate (warriors) PvP
---
*Laughs in any class that can kite*
---
*Laughs in Paladin*
---
My very first character in US open beta was a Night elf, and just the feeling of Tel'Drassil and the way it looked blew me away, like holy shit i am actually playing IN the warcraft universe as my own character! The music fitts so well too, i hear that music and it's like i am 16 years old again.
---
Madseason the GOAT of WoW content.
---
Yes! Thanks muchly!
---
Damn, you just reminded me of all the QQing I used to do back when TBC was live.. Compared to now, TBC seems amazing but I do indeed remember hating arenas so god damn much and missing vanilla PvP. Your other points are spot on, too. 
---
CD Project didn't release their DLCs in the launch week of the main game and provided actual content that is worth the price.
---
Vanilla model with new content patches on separate servers while keeping a few servers at static vanilla mode. They could take WoW in different places/experiment with things and if people don't like it, there's always OG servers to fall back on. 
---
WoW is his GF.
---
&gt; For some reason, the idea of hybrids being moved from garbage tier DPS to sub-optimal tier really irks some people.
---
Anything that forces change is scary.
---
I'm up if I can join as melee Hunter!
---
True but with the new engine and shaders it looks much more crisp.
---
"Good group" is a telltale sign that it is not a good group.
---
Yeah i'm going to play classic and i only started playing WoW when BC was almost over. I was like 9 y/o when i started so everything i did was awesome.
---
It took me a long time to lvl my Blood Elf paladin back then.
---
And I only lvled it to like 50 ish to unlock my Death Knight class.
---
Then i bought WotLK and instantly made a DK and that was my main all the way untill Legion.
---
I haven't touched WoW for almost 3 years now.
---
But classic will be just like Old School Runescape for me because it brings me back to when i was a child.
---
30/0/21 for Shaman. You’re a powerful healer but can also nuke people down. 
---
Warlocks can dispel hostile targets.
---
You pull it, you tank it
---
There's 2 factions in Vanilla I wish I could join - Defias and Scarlet Crusade
---
You can dispel nature's swiftness, barkskin, nature's grasp, free action potion, live action potion, limited invulnerability potion etc.
---
As an alliance priest you're the only guy on the team who can dispel all of it.
---
CD Project have pleasured me both mentally and physically.
---
Holy shit it's actually there. http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/3234659 huge nostalgia this as i gave this character away when i rerolled horde and the end of vanilla.
---
The same way I’d feel about raiding with someone who’s 81, if they’re a dickhead then either they leave or I do, if they’re a reasonable human being then there’s no problem.
---
If you want to get into a decent raiding guild you will be.  
---
Do you have spell check or something? 
---
Exactly.
---
I think EQ and project 1999 does something similar
---
I've just respecced from hemo to 19-32-0 and ground single lvl60 melee mobs. Equipped with blue gear I've gone from 365dps to 390dps. I didn't use AR but I didn't use CB either. Mob health was 3300, meaning it took 8.46 seconds to kill the mobs as combat, 9.04 seconds for hemo. Bladeflurry will give a slightly quicker 1-60 time but so will avoiding more wPVP. Nerfing myself by unequipping half of my gear gives similar 5-7% dps increases over hemo.
---
PvP: using Mind Vision actively in BGs. You need it to scout incoming assaults on the flag carry, and to scout out the enemy flag carry when they're turtling.
---
Duskwood for its music, storylines, gothic themes, mists, elite mobs and undead.
---
I think I agree with your viewpoint more than the dwarf one. I do have a gnome bias though
---
Not really, no. They specifically concentrate on making it look exactly like it did. (Well, they said it might not be "pixel perfect", but it should be *very* close.)
---
The only "upgrades" are the optional new water, shadows and larger clutter distance.
---
In PvE raids, remove flash heal from your bars. If you are using it you are doing it wrong. Use Heal4 or GH1 depending on your mana regen and use jump to stop a cast if the tank is at max. Use GH (max) when using Inner Focus. Create a macro to /w warlocks that you have cast renew on them and they can tap safely. 
---
I think the fact that players playing the optimal classes badly were able to complete raids means subpar specs played well will be fine. You can find dps videos for different specs like shadowpriest tested on private servers with enough accuracy to give an honest showing of what to expect. If you have room to squeeze them in a manatide group for example between dark runes potion bandages etc they should be fine. On my mage I barely ever used potion unless it was early progression or fights where you aoe.
---
I'M A FUCKING BEAR
---
Shaman will be easier to level with so I guess it depends what your plan is late game.
---
Personally I'm going to play Priest, but only because that's what I've always enjoyed playing.
---
as long as they are toxic i couldn't care less about age. would raid with a 12 year old as long as they put in some effort, no problem here!
---
Me beeing a rogue all my life i don't want to stand out. Even now in bfa i tend to move in steath when im not on a mount. And ud isn't only cool but the best horde race for pvp and i tend to do a lot of it. 
---
I love this idea. I started plating WoW just before TBC. I played mage through most of my time in WoW (Classic to Cata and then a bit in both Legion/BfA) but I always look back most fondly on my time as a Shadow Priest. I am currently leveling one on LH but when Classic launches I would love - FUCKING LOVE - to be in a guild that played casually (I have wife/kids now, no more 12 hour raid days/nights lol). We could run some 5 mans, do some fun challenges, clear group content and gold farm, and if we get luck maybe do Ony or MC if time allows.  
---
I would love to do all this without hearing SPriest LOL every 5 minutes.
---
Cheers to the good idea mate.
---
As mentioned I'm going to be healing Endgame PvE, but would also like to jump into PvP (as whatever spec is best? I guess enhance/shadow?) as I didn't get too into PvP in vanilla.
---
I hate the word Meme spec
---
But i would love joining a casual guild which allowed people to play like they wanted to. 
---
Indeed, that is it: http://classicdb.ch/?item=9398
---
Shadow is broken in PVP.
---
Not arguing that it should be changed as I want classic as classic but it was always a bit rubbish that of all the cloth classes that got a armour buff spell, only priests could be worn off by being hit. Especially as lock and mage can easily slow a melee.
---
Just started a wee rogue alt ehm somewhere.. Any tips for a first timer lvling up? 
---
http://classicdb.ch/?spell=10952
---
to go along with what was said.
---
I think it’s probably true...but I’m not sure Reddit is an accurate slice of the populace.
---
Hoping for the best.
---
Fantastic!
---
You seriously underestimate the combination of stubbourness and stupidity of players. They WILL hit their abilities and spell the SECOND the tank will engage. They HAVE to. MUST.
---
And while I'd be happy to let the idiot who pulls aggro from me die, it's quite often the whole group who refuses to let me build threat. At that point, I just want to get the instance over with and not spend 90 minutes looking for recplament upon replacement.
---
&gt; +No having to rez people in raids (outside of combat rez, obviously)
---
&gt; -Totems are a pain in the ass, have to keep re-casting and making sure they're in range, keep track of timers with addons
---
By this weird Druid "pro" and this even weirder Shaman "con" it's pretty obvious you should play Druid
---
He also thinks not having an out of combat ress a pro.
---
I would challenge the fact that shaman is easier to level. I haven't leveled a shaman in vanilla but I've leveled a priest and I would easily put it in top 3 of smoothest rides to 60 behind only hunter and warlock, maybe even above warlock. 
---
With good wand upgrades every couple of levels and the spirit tap + wand specialization talents, I rarely had to drink at all and killed things quickly. 
---
Imo thats a small pro compared to calling 50% of your abilities a con.
---
In PVP, baiting interrupts with fake heals - start to cast when you know their interrupt is off CD then cancel the heal and watch them waste it. Bonus points if you fake with a heal then get them to kick your hearthstone since the green swirly animation looks very much like a heal.
---
The wand thing is RNG though, big time. Yeah you'll get your level 5 and 13(?) wands but then it's really down to luck.
---
It's smooth with a Priest but it's not exactly quick, that should have really been my main point.
---
The problem is when an unfinished game is released and they add DLC later on. They just keep focusing on finishing the games quickly. I'd rather they spent 2 years developing a game then releasing a game yearly just for profit. Quality over quantity.
---
*Laughs in free action potion*
---
want to know something specific.
---
get the first 2 points into remorseless attacks then skill combat. if you want (had the discussion yesterday) you can specc into sub hemo lvl 30+.
---
Hi, tank here, inv.
---
I can't wait to make my main already which is Protection Warrior ofc :) 
---
See you in Summer guys!

Od flameskull shield.

I didn't get to play Vanilla when it came out either. I never asked my parents back then for money to play an online game (I was 15, E Europe, paying monthly to play a game was not a concept so familiar as it may be today, especially for my parents), but I read the forums and the patch notes and imagined playing. I played Vanilla after that on a host of private servers. But the chance to play something that has been nagging me for the last 14-15 years and something I could not afford back then is not to be missed. I'm going to sub and play it casually, hopefully having a chance to experience something at least partially similar to what was back in 2004/2005).
---
I love my woman more everyday because I get to know her better everyday. Sometimes there's still stuff that I didn't know about her and it makes me love her even more. So yes, I'd marry that woman if I could.
---
Getting to know someone is sweet and thrilling but knowing them in and out is much more lovely. That way I know how to surprise my lady, where to take her, etc. 
---
Like skinning knife with +30 spell power for caster alts
---
I am key for every dungeon group
---
Do you mean slow whilst stealthed or slow to do dmg haha. Stealth is soooo slow didn't expect that as it never seems that way when a rogue sneaks about you in Wpvp
---
But how is that any different from another class? Tanks "just stand there and press a few buttons". DPS only press their buttons, maybe avoid the flames if they are self-proclaimed pro-gamers. Healers just use something like Clique and press whichever raidframe has the lowest amount of HP.
---
For those who didn't understand, correct me OP if I'm wrong but, meme-spec friendly does not necessarily mean having 40 people with a non-mainstream spec. It should mean a guild where people are actually playing a MMORPG, where everything should be accepted, either super skilled / optimal guys who don't bother not clearing everything in 1 week, or first time / noob players who both want to be able to enjoy their class fantasy + seeing all the content of the game.
---
I think the goal is not to do a thing where you exclude people who wanna play either spec, good or bad. I know it should be obvious to most but still.
---
Sheep: you break it, you buy it
---
I know I hardly do it
---
He's misunderstanding how abandonware works, which isn't unsurprising because after the Nost shutdown the word got tossed around as a magic bullet, but there's no time limit on when software becomes abandonware, because abandonware isn't a formal term, it just means no one will stop you distributing that software because either the copyright holder no longer owns it or no longer cares. 
---
People liked to believe, after Nost, that because WoW has changed so much vanilla should be considered Abandonware, because you can no longer play that content how it was intended, but even if Abandonware were legally recognised that argument wouldn't hold water as no court is going to rule that World of Warcraft Vanilla is a different game to World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth - especially when your vanilla character is still playable, your original World of Warcraft account is still there, you can still log on. 
---
If they did rule that, imagine the repercussions across the industry: Valve loses the rights to Team Fortress 2's original incarnation in a heart beat, is League the game it originally released as? Is Hearthstone, now that cards once legal are no longer legal, still the same game (it certainly plays very differently)? No Court is going to open that pandora's box, it's bad for the industry, and it's bad for the consumer - developers would be hesitant to update their games in any significant way, for fear of losing their rights to the original incarnation. 
---
Bruh, I'm in bed by 9pm these days...
---
i mean dmg wise ;) at low levels it takes longer to kill stuff than with other classes. you movementspeed in stealth gets higher with higher ranks of steath and via talents in the sub tree.
---
I arrived there pretty much directly after i got my lvl 40 Mount. Alliance Player here. It was the First zone in which i got corpse camped for several hours. 
---
No idea what that has to do with my comment tho.
---
*Laughs in kiting intensifies*
---
I completely forgot about the pug runs we used to do in TBC/WotLK that only went to the first boss / trash until I read this. 
---
That's evil, I love it !
---
*Those* are the worst. Yea, lemme join your group, knowing that I'll have to leave in 20 minutes.
---
But DLC's are not a problem in it self, that was my point. The other guy said 15 different DLC is a problem, but getting 15 new DLC for a game you like should be a godsent. The problems can be things like pricing models or, like you mention, making a shit game in the first place. Those are really whole separate issues from a DLC.
---
Tbf this is the only I would be completely confused about would be vanilla talents for rogues. Sword or dagger etc. 
---
Some parts the music is too loud other then that great video keep it up.  
---
New sub here.
---
I dont get your "current run".  Kargath, Badlands, is a level 35+ horde hub, what are you doing there at level 3?
---
You actually bring up a pretty good point with Runescape. A lot of people might like the old school RPG style, regardless of having played vanilla. I could imagine a lot of old Runescape fans that never got around to play WoW might really enjoy a second chance of trying vanilla.
---
*Those*  are the worst.
---
Yea, lemme join your Scarlet Monastery party (Alliance), when I *know* I'll be leaving in 20 minutes. Good luck finding a replacement for me who wants to bother walking over there.
---
*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** collax974! ^(hug)
---
&gt;With good wand upgrades every couple of levels
---
Literally any class is a smooth ride with that stipulation.
---
NE and Human are where I'm at. I'd enjoy being an orc fury warrior I think but that's not enough!
---
Paladin: Bubble, Hearth, laugh
---
That's true, although I won't lie, the latest blue post about "sooner than soon" has got me refreshing the "new" page every few hours hoping for more info.
---
If you've never played the Alliance side of WoW, I'd say that the launch of Classic is the perfect opportunity to try it out. I've played both, and I'd say that quests as an Alliance character are... better? (This was of course before both factions got the exact same quests).
---
Played in a Naxx guild during vanilla and also on private, there was ALWAYS at least one group of raiders doing dungeons for a plethora of reason. Farming, Alts, specific gear for someone (like a frost wand), or just to crush something with their gear. 
---
Some people will raidlog but it’s the nature of the beast. But with 40 people per raid and some guilds fielding multiple teams there’s bound to be people running them. 
---
Video doesn’t load - Error. 
---
You're right. They'd probably appeal much more to kids if they said "WoW: battle royale" lol
---
I can't choose between **Rogue, Mage and Warrior.**
---
I have LOTS of free time, and can play hardcore. I will do a lots of PVP (open world / bg), and also PVE.
---
\- I like the fact that I can be a dick with the **rogue** and troll people (don't judge me...), but there will be lots of rogues (competition for stuff), and i'm afraid the rogue will be kinda boring pve-wise/animation.
---
\- I like the fact that **mage** can be usefull to people, do some 1v3 in open-world etc, but i'm afraid I have to always drink and get one shot by rogues.
---
\- I like the fact that **warrior** are f\*cking badass and can be demi-god with great gear, but i'm afraid that they will be kited and out-played quiet easily, especially nowadays.  
---
Send **HELP** please ! :D
---
Sounds absolutely awesome, and is much in line with how my original gameplay went. None of my friends had any idea about best specs and optimal raiding consumeables etc. We just had fun playing 5m dungeons with whatever specs we ended up with. Hope to have the same experience when Classic arrives.
---
I mean if that’s your description for healing and damage then tanking is just letting a boss hit you while your healer protects you xD. 
---
I will play a shaman but I think priests are "better", but, a tauren shaman looks cooler ;)
---
There are several reason why people run dungeons after farming their pre raid Bis gear:
---
- to help out other's. New people as well as alts of friends.
---
- to make money/mats. Some runs are more profitable than farming in the open world.
---
-to get rare epics (like Ironfoe or similar)
---
- after new content is added (like t0,5)
---
- to get buffs for raids (DM)
---
So as you can see although there is stuff to do after getting your items, some people will not do dungeons at all, or will do them rarely.
---
Frequency of running dungeons will depend a lot on how Blizz implements it and how classic does. Higher population cap means easier dungeon finding, and if classic has a growing population it will also mean more dungeons.
---
Back in vanilla, we used to run dungeons all the time, due to other reason as well: 
---
-lack of knowledge (a lot of people would just join anything because they did not know if they needed something or not)
---
- inefficient runs ( most runs were whole dungeon runs, now there is a lot of partial runs, like targeting only 1 or few bosses or parts of dungeon)
---
-failed runs (a lot more runs failed back then, everything lasted longer, people would quit them, or simply due to internet/knowledge would be harder)
---
-item changes and additions, etc
---
Or worse, they say "can summon", but no one is at the instance, and the warlock is in moonglade.
---
The amount of threat generated from Demoralizing Shout is something most people get from Pservers, very few actually remembers how it was back in the day (seeing as most human brains have big problems remembering details 15 years back in time). So we will have to see =)
---
I switched from Alliance to Horde in 2005 already. Could never switch back to Alliance now. Fighting Undeads, Orcs, Taurens and Trolls would feel like betraying not only the Horde, but myself. 
---
I agree with this, and you can near enough afk any non progression boss in retail (in terms of mental focus) as long as it's not progression. It's all just muscle memory, it's nothing fancy.
---
Sure it’s not “the same” but that doesn’t mean it’s bad. I played on some trash vanilla server with boosted exp leveling a pally. I was running away from a higher level horde hunter in STV and came across a doorf priest  named byfuglen on the beach. I explained to him I needed help and he was tryna do that giant quest on the western shore so we hung out and did it. That turned into running dungeons etc etc. 
---
We stayed in contact for almost 3 months based solely on this interaction. Chatting about everything from raiding to sports. If it could happen there it can happen anywhere. THAT is the magic of classic and it’s not gone.
---
He might have meant DM tribute stealth runs, which included 1 druid +1 or 2 more stealthers. 
---
That could be done as single hunter too, although some private servers nerfed that. 
---
Also if we are talking about DM farming there is also 1 man AOE farming in DM E.
---
Druid is very strong on on one and in wpvp due to stealth and because you can escape and fight when outnumbered. Wpvp rarely stays 1 v 1 for long and other casters are much better at dealing with more than one enemy or getting out alive. Mages, spriests excel outnumbered and mages can get away. Ele is as good or better than any caster in a BG. Spriests which are stupidly strong 2 v 1 are pretty bad in bg's due to mana. Not all pvp is the same. 
---
Now if you want to argue a ele shaman with a warrior is stronger than a druid/x? Sometimes. Ele and warrior are a really nice compliment. 
---
Rogues are good in wpvp for the same reason btw. They are NOT the strongest 1 v 1 class in an "arena like" duel and they are probably the worst BG class where Ele Shaman is one of the best. Rogues are GOOD at 1 v 1, but every class has a spec that can beat them or split with consumables/trinkets. The problem is those classes also can't pick the fight and or get away like a rogue or druid. That is what makes those two classes very good at WPVP.
---
Get it now? Or am I going to be downvoted again by people who haven't played Vanilla since 2006 and don't realize that almost all the druids back then were really, really bad and the meta has completely changed with that class. Here's an example of a good druid. 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci5IbZbscaA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci5IbZbscaA)
---
I agree. DLC's in itself are no problem whatsoever. The pricing on the other hand is really bad. And I'm not gonna buy a 50$ season pass either as I don't know how good the DLC is gonna be or if I'm even gonna play when the DLC comes. Some games make DLC cheap and that's a good thing. If there's 15 DLC and they cost between 5-10$ that's more than awesome.
---
You just need to photoshop a Whirlwind axe and some Plate of the Tiger onto the Seagull...
---
During late vanilla and mostly during early tbc, I used to type in "wow paladin" on video.google and youtube, and watch all the videos which got uploaded that day/week.
---
It's still not necessary to over heal all you have to do is precast heals.
---
both are good for what you are looking for. pve healing. both are very good healers in bgs and pvp aswell. 
---
as for dps specs, shaman got enh and elem, priest - shadow.
---
all of these are viable so ya. for pve both of this classes are healers. for pvp other specs are viable aswell.
---
So ya honestly you can pick whaever as both choices are good for what you looking for.
---
Duskwood right after is epic as well. That whole area is just great.
---
Your story is  very pleasant to read !

Kite/stun this. *Laughs at the lesser 1.12 classes.*
---
First 2 items are world drops, could be dropped from any mob in the open world or dungeon, they are not exclusive to dungeons.
---
Face melting
---
You really should just link all 9. 
---
Smite Priests + 1 Ret Paladin for every rank of Seal of the Crusader. Adds up to like +900 holy damage.
---
Taunt
---
Man, if that's the worst mistake you've ever made your life must be easy!
---
Awesome, glad it helped :).
---
Can't tell if this is classic wow or links awakening 
---
Only min maxers give a shit, most casual guilds won't care. You can raid with meme specs easily through BWL. 
---
Overhealing is the sign of a bad healer. (Its a waste of mana)
---
The best healers predict incoming damage and heal accordingly, making sure not to overheal.
---
Secondly, you can spot a good healer by watching them heal team membere while letting the tank take a little damage to make sure a big heal fully restores the tank without overhealing.
---
Spamming the same sentence repeatedly in a global chat isn't socializing 
---
These people will never be convinced that someone else could have a legitimate difference of opinion about the game. Only their opinion matters. I guarantee you that he preaches #NoChanges in one hand and complains about easy raids or crossrealm battlegrounds in the other.
---
Yep. A krol blade dropped in an AV I was in once and like 12 people got to roll on it. I wish loot was ffa because I was the person who looted it.
---
Has to be Feralas for me. 
---
It's just nice, a little off the beaten path and surprisingly friendly to play hide and seek in.
---
It’s also about 3x the armor value of the other cloth classes. 
---
You are comparing them like they are the same... Sure, its a hassle having to reapply it, but demon armor and frost armor give 570 and 560 respectively. Meanwhile inner fire gives almost 1400. 
---
Priests are better healing in raids, shamans are really strong with a melee group in dungeons for farming, and both are highly wanted for raids.
---
In PvP Shadow Priest shines more at 1 v 2 and 1 v 1's and Elemental shines more in group pvp. As only a healer though priests are better at PvP. Shamans are best played as jack of all trades as 30/0/21. So I would say if you like being more offensive in a BG go shaman, if you like being more heal focused go priest or if you like to solo at wpvp a lot go priest.
---
They both level easily btw. With wands on a priest and with the shaman you have a couple options as enhance or enhance ele hybrid. You can go ele after 40 if you want. 
---
Can't go wrong with either class. 
---
I don't think they'll bother advertising much. The gameplay is niche at this point and I don't think they'll want to massively advertise something which people then try and hate. I know some "Cata kids" and they all hated the demo and gave up after about 10 minutes.
---
We diehards will be there anyway. They don't need to advertise to us.
---
Remote chance if stars align to 1 shot any player in pvp
---
Mind Control, Boats, Bridges, Battlestar Galactica.
---
And bad healers misjudge that big heal. Either leave it too late or it doesn't top off the tank. Overhealing doesn't matter so much in a 5-man because if the DPS is going all out, they'll always be using more mana than the healer. It won't cost anybody any more time. 
---
And for the record, topping off is over healing. 
---
What I found out during my raiding time, that you don't have to min/max, be the best possible version, if you can follow the tactics. Being in the most optimal raiding setup means that you have more room for errors. There are not many difficult raid bosses in vanilla, they are simple as hell (todays Mythics are way more complex imo). So I am really interested in an idea of playing suboptimal classes, and stepping out of the fire. Being a casual and a "meme" spec doesn't mean that you have to be brain dead during raiding.
---
The pvp gear is bis for all specs as a priest not just shadow. A substitute for it would be the AQ 40 set. Priests in vanilla pvp main stats is Intellect then stamina. +healing is not that important since your main heal scales really bad. It just costs alot of mana and thats where the intellect comes in
---
I'm glad people like you won't be able to kill Vanilla a second time. The dev team knows that their job is to recreate Vanilla and not make design decisions.
---
They also have secondary effects of slowing or health regen. There is no secondary application to inner fire.
---
PVE downranking well and conserving mana and abusing the 5 second rule as much as possible to regen mana. You also get to CC undeads in some dungeons.
---
PVP dispels, mindvisioning flag carriers, throwing people off cliffs in AB, burning peoples mana for the lol's sometimes. Priests are probably the most interesting "pure healer" in PvP because there is a lot of things they can do. It's more important that you are good at dispelling on alliance cus they have no purge. Paladins are super strong PvP   
---
 healers so you will have the time and you want to use all that utility.
---
Eastern Plaguelands. My inner War3 was always screaming for me to hit 55 so I could quest there. War3 was why I started as Forsaken. inb4 they ruined Sylvanus's character.
---
The best part of shit unviable builds is that really didn't know it until much later. All this modern min/max needs to go. The best thing blizzard could do is change all the values, 
---
quest lines, and make people work to discover again
---
Yeah i know i just want to learn the class. Try to raid and be a good tank. Always been something that i've wanted to try out and here we are ! I'll probably try paladin/druids if i want to make a 2nd character that isn't mage/rogue/warlock xD.
---
Tanking classic is gonna be hell at first with ppl not understanding threat is a thing. Can't wait
---
Tip? You’ve got to be kidding
---
For those asking, the max a rogue can tank in raids is  about~halfway into AQ. If anyone wants to talk more about rogue tanking, please let me know, I have a lot of experience in this.
---
Do you have any link for those build ? Like a guide or something ? It would be awesome 
---
this is wrong, low rank flash heal when you have good gear (t2 or so) is amazing for raid healing. and you never want to use jump to stop cast because it takes way too long. you need a stop cast macro which is super quick and you can start healing again.
---
I'll try my best :( 
---
Again misleading strawpoll with paladins and shamans being separate and all the other classes being together.
---
If warrior has 14%, that means 7 % will end up in your faction. Shaman has 8 % and *all of them* will be on horde, so shaman should be no. 1. 
---
" - Warlocks can now use corruption and agony, which should synergyze nicely with SW. "
---
u can only have 1 curse per warlock, and raid wants elements,reck,shadow. So all wont use agony, and also i dont think it will make warlock damage comparable to top raid damage anyway, there is still a tps problem, with only 8 debuffs.
---
You might as well just be using the discords for each class. They are moderated, they have people who actually know the class properly giving the information out and answering/correcting those who don't. 
---
thanks
---
Why would a tank warrior run with a dps warrior when they can get instant invites for groups with casters and hunters? These people never seem to ask themselves this question. Unless you are friends with a feral, you tank. 
---
because after the absolute shit show that is stv, and it having a crowded jungly feel it was nice to have the wide open desert to run around in with your new mount 
---
20 hit charge. With Inner fire and some clever gearing and buffs. priests can surprisingly tank a few raids bosses. Contrary to popular belief, you can manage to get quite far in raiding. However, its not for the faint of heart and demands you to put in the effort. I grabbed it up a year ago and its a blast to play. If you want to learn more about it, I am available to talk on the priest classic discord.

Dude we’re just trying to relate to one another calm down. I’m so excited to play if I have things in between playing, it makes me love the game. Of course part of me would like to not pay rent, work, see family/friends, and just game all day. But I can’t. 
---
Look if you can game 15 hours a day straight for a few years on one video game that’s great for you but I’m not that lame. (Close though)
---
Do it. Ignore every commitment you have to play classic. No work, family, friends. See what happens to you. Some of us learn from experience, I did. 
---
&gt;The dev team knows that their job is to recreate Vanilla and not make design decisions.
---
For initial release, sure.
---
It is interesting for sure, but you need friends you can rely on and support. There are many different builds you can go from pure healing to somewhat more hybrid to shadow. You make up for your lack of mobility with excellent abilties and their dispel is huge.
---
Well, regarding the game :) 
---
I really, really wish we could join the Scarlet Crusade. It would be so baller. 
---
The difference between an equally geared holy pally with both these specs is a small difference. And as somebody who often switches from nightfall to offheal the 21/30 holy/ret spec is perfect because your still a great efficient healer if called upon.
---
I hated what they did to them in later expansions. Making them all undead. WTF Blizz?!
---
I mean, you can collect their whole armour set. That should make you friendly like Corrupted Ashbringer does.
---
My very first memory of WoW is so fuzzy I can barely remember it at all. But my friend from a few doors down had the game and showed it to me, he let me make a human (can't remember the class) and after running around Jasperlode Mine I wanted to get my own account.
---
After pestering my parents they let me get it. I made a Nelf hunter and after I'd played for a little while my Dad asked me to show him the game, so I gave him a little tour of Dolanaar and the lake next to it. One thing in particular I remember was when I came back to the game after going upstairs to get him my character was sat down and I was 'AFK'. No clue what that meant, but my Dad helped me out and pointed to the chat panel where it was explained. After showing my Dad around I became fascinated by the immensity of the world and how little I'd explored. As a level 11 Nelf I ran all the way to Ashenvale and thought I was in some distant, high level land where only good players go, only to run straight back after seeing a 'skull' level white wolf prowling around.
---
I started making other characters to get the different flavours and see completely different sights. Braving the Quilboar in Mulgore was a proper adventure to me, I was fighting my way through Brambleblade Ravine for a long time and when I emerged and claimed my quest rewards I felt invincible. I was only level 8.
---
The first time I saw a level 70 (this was at the start of TBC) was in Orgrimmar and I think everyone has their mind blown when they see a max level character looking like an absolute beast in their high level gear for the first time. But I was surrounded by them and couldn't believe it. "Woah that guy has a mount wtf!?" "Look at that Shaman!" "How did they even get to level 70 that's crazy!"
---
Everywhere I went in WoW it was like I was pulling the curtain back on an endless stream of cool as fuck stuff. I was a hughe LotR kid so it really hit the spot for me in terms of the fantasy thing, but even down to simply learning what 'AFK' meant it was literally another world and I wanted - no,  I NEEDED to see and learn everything about it.
---
Imagine being the project lead on retail WoW, and classic comes out and gets more subs than you. Your boss will now have a quantifiable way of showing that you fucked up. Your iterations did not improve on the first iteration of the product, in fact it drove people away. If classic is a smash hit, it's direct proof of mismanagement of the IP. I think the only reason we're getting classic now, is due to changes in the organization, meaning that everyone will have a scapegoat if classic do end up being more succesful than retail.
---
I play on a Pserver. and while I can say the "Magic" isn't quite the same. Since we have been here before. I can say however it is very much the same game I loved. Rose tinted glasses be damned. Something about the game just feels more organic then retail, grinding doesn't feel as stale, the non-linear questing just feels better to me. Your not a "Hero" your just some chump on an adventure and people happen to have odd jobs they need done and your the guy that came by. I feel more connected to my character and the world and the mobs actually feel threatening. and to this day I am still finding new things out inside the game. just avoid guides and walkthroughs. I like to read the wiki for Lore and that makes the zones even cooler knowing some more of the back story. Vanilla was special because it was a story. You aren't the story, your just sort of dropped in and have to make a place for yourself. And that to me is cool as shit.
---
As a Druid tank, I concur.
---
Agreed. SM is my favorite dungeons of all time and i thought they were so cool. I am an RP'er at heart and just being able to aid them would bring be a lot of joy 
---
Vanilla doesn't actually require that much raid awareness in the first couple of raids. Besides you get used to alternating between staring at frames and your surroundings pretty quick. It helps that if you take damage you will also be the one to heal said damage, so in that sense it's very intuitive. A good raid frame addon helps a lot.
---
Besides as a Shaman you have that sweet self-rez if you do happen to die. Just press it quick before too many take notice ;P
---
Absolutely. Idiots like you, along with Activision Blizzard execs foaming at the mouth to squeeze out every last bit of profit out of any product regardless of quality, are the two biggest threats facing Vanilla WoW's revival.
---
&gt;The tension between horde and alliance was a real thing! I really hated them.
---
What's wrong with that? As long as it's just in-game, it adds flavor to the gameworld!
---
Good for you! Warlocks are amazing, lots of fun in PvP and really efficient levelers too!
---
If you are about PvP, shaman
---
Of you care about pve, either or.
---
As Warlock, Shadowpriest in raid, Corruption on target, Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian on a mage in group. Soulstone on myself, and limited invulnerability potion/BoP's. And an insane tank that can keep high TPS.
---
(No agony because im asuming i have to place another curse. I.e. Curse of Shadow.)
---
I’m not downvoting you I played in classic definitely not a kid. You can contribute in ways beyond your class. You can be a bad ass herbalist who has all of the flasks and pots your guild will need you will have a spot in the raid. There is a lot more to raising than just your pure dps. Sure if you want to push progression in a top guild they will care about that stuff. But you can still be in a guild and push naxx on any class race or spec it will just be a little more difficult. 
---
Stormstike apllies a debuff on target so that the next incoming nature spell does 20% more. 39 enhancement shaman and 1 elemental shaman can do a 40k+ hit. Not sure about dps tho.
---
Not true. They all have a use, name any spec and I’ll give you atleast one use helpful to a raid. 
---
He needs to strop strafing left so much. One, it was making me dizzy, and two if he didn't get parried so much the duels would have ended quicker.  Stay behind the pally, moving is great, strafing left constantly is just weird. 
---
You might have some extreme cases where for 1 member of the raid some classes might excel. like elem chaman, if you consider you have 39 enhancement chaman that provides the nature debuff, and you, as a chaman, spamming chain lightning/lightning. I remember seeing a video with an elemental chaman popping a 26k chain lightning...
---
I think fury war is already close to maxed out when going to raid (and therefore, it strength).
---
Total speculation however, I don’t have any number to confirm this
---
&gt;#*Top Men*
---
I just want the tentacles to spawn underneath the floor, that's all I'm asking.
---
They can both heal good in raids and do damage when needed.
---
Are you more of a hotdot guy or a burst guy?
---
Damn. In terms of grinding and dps output how big difference is it really between troll and orc?
---
In classic it is a 10 minute duration, 20 charge buff.  
---
Yes it's annoying. I personally hate 'maintenance' buffs that you need to reapply every couple of minutes.
---
Shaman because they're less played less and it makes you a more essential asset to a raid and battleground.
---
All of the classes you mentioned will be very popular and you're likely to see some competition no matter which you pick. 
---
A **mage** or **rogue** is a lot more self-sufficient than a **warrior** and can choose their PvP encounters a lot more, thus they are better suited for open world. I would hesitate myself to play **warrior** without friends or a good guild.
---
You can be useful as a **rogue** or **warrior** as well, with lockpicking and tanking the occasional dungeon.
---
PvE- wise most classes have a somewhat boring rotation. I don't think you should let that influence your choice too much.
---
Ultimately it boils down to which class fantasy resonates with you the most. Luckily you have quite a lot of time left to decide. :D
---
U mean broken tooth the rare cat from badlands which had  1.0 atk speed
---
*Hi human!* It's your **1st Cakeday** esif! ^(hug)
---
Sucks for you. 
---
I think he meant Kharanos, possibly?
---
Haha!
---
Honestly though. Try finding anyone for ST. "LFM ALL ST FAST RUN GOING IN 59 HOURS!!!!"
---
They will probably be leashed since that was implemented sometime during vanilla.
---
Enhance is hot garbage compared to an equally geared elemental shaman.
---
Luckily for you they are both excellent PvP classes, with a very high skill ceiling. Rogues are a bit more cooldown reliant than hunters and you can often find yourself helpless if you don't have anything to pop. 
---
It all depends on your playstyle and what you enjoy. Do you like kiting? Do you like darting in and out of stealth like an annoying baboon? Do you enjoy sniping people from afar, watching your pet chew through their health? Do you enjoy stunlucking that poor priest until he falls over?
---
/pfdb show, profit
---
Some folks uploaded [Illidan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAfoqMbHQ0A) and [Mother Sharazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbG5DfkjgYo) kills as well, from 2008.
---
You can remove buffs as a Shaman.
---
It’s still in game was never removed.
---
Shadow doesn't raid so well but at least you can melt player faces.
---
I do it from behind.
---
&gt;Healing
---
Healing is one of the most skillful roles you can pick. Juggling 12 different ranks of heals between 3-4 different healing spells trying to predict incoming damage while making sure you work together with your other healers to prevent multiple players healing the same target, is not the same as "spamming one button".
---
Stonetalon Mountains and Ashenvale... where you get to wet your noodle with WPvP.
---
I don't dislike the epic world saving storylines, LOTR exists after all and does a damn fine job... BUT the reason why it sucks in wow is because the world needs saving every damn year (every expansion, sometimes every patch) so how can we take it seriously anymore.
---
REPEAT:
---
"Oh chosen one, you have saved the world but a new threat appears, please save the world again!"
---
UNTIL: WoW no longer earns money.
---
Mind Flay is a 3 second channel and has 45% spell power coefficient.  
---
Mind Blast is a 1.5 second cast and has 42.9% spell power coefficient.
---
Channeled spells incur a channeling penalty, preventing you from regenerating mana.
---
Shadow Word: Pain and Devouring Plague are the only offensive Shadow spells with greater than 50% spell power coefficient.
---
I don't know why someone would tell you that Shadow Priests are not gear dependant. They have below average scaling and above average mana costs coupled with a mechanic that prevents them from regenerating mana.
---
If you want a less gear dependent class, look to the Mage. Not Shadow Priest.
---
Like I said, it's not about you folks trying to relate to one another, it's about reading that comment about how sad life would be if you could actually do what everyone who wasn't stuck with a wife and X kids was doing. I don't care if you all want to comfort each other that you are all going to do everything that everyone else is doing on a regular basis with minimal play, but actually implying that passionate people much like yourself would be miserable doing the same exact thing you would do if it weren't for those commitments is lowly.  
---
I mean imagine if we were to constantly keep telling each other "man, we're so glad we're not like these game cucked dads who're stuck with nagging wives changing diapers, meanwhile I'm switching my fuck buddies and taking 2 weeks off work when Classic comes out. Times like these I'm really glad I stayed single and decided not to have kids."
---
Like, how frustrated and insecure would we look if we started basing our enjoyment of anything on how miserable we imagine others being.  
---
&gt;  But I can’t.
---
Sure you can. You just don't want to, because you would rather keep what you have right now. And that's fine, but not everyone feels the same. 
---
What drags you toward only semi-optimal specs? :o
---
&gt;Bad luck and he teleports while a shadowbolt is mid-air meaning it will hit immediately after the aggro reset and he'll absolutely murder you with earth shocks.
---
It's funny, because players think Vanilla takes no skill. That's not entirely true, it just takes very different types of skill than retail.
---
In this case you need to watch your boss timers and make sure you actually STOP casting before the teleports to prevent exactly this from happening. Not as big deal of Skeram, since you should survive an Earth Shock and the tanks will taunt the boss as soon as it teleports, but for other bosses, like Twin Emperors, it can easily wipe the raid if you happened to get a shadow bolt off too close to the teleport.
---
Killed all alliance capitol bosses on a private server.  All they provided was a little honor.  Not sure if they dropped gold in vanilla.
---
There was this AddOn named "Gatherer" I believe that marked herbs and mining spots. Don't know if it was around Vanilla time, but I saw it on private servers.
---
this video was why i played mage haha
---
Mankrik's wife
---
I tanked everything as Arms and trash-tanked for our raid group.
---
A surprising amount of people are just unwilling to spam sunder-tab
---
You've never seen Druids do it either in Retail Vanilla.  All of your decision making about this is based on Private Servers.  So sorry...Be ready to heal in raids if you roll a Druid in Classic.  That's all I'm saying.
---
Oh man, you gotta be a bad rogue if you can't kill a Warrior :d
---
Using those calculations on the Defense kit, the BiS for Rogue tanks becomes the Darkmantle Gloves (Hands) and the Guise of the Devourer (Head). End result is a loss of roughly 1% Avoidance, which means that Alliance get pushed down to 99% maximum whereas Horde can make it just barely over 100% (thanks to the Improved Grace of Air Totem).
---
We had a duo in our guild that was father and son. I think the boy was 10 or 11. The dad advised him not to talk over Ventrillo to hide his age, but eventually we got let in on the secret, once the kid had proven that he was a good player. Perhaps it was necessary that we all knew his skillz before we knew his age. He used to type up a storm, but was still generally quiet on vent. I think once we all knew his age, things we found annoying about him became a little less annoying, because you knew that player was a kid and not some immature 20 something, so obsessing over the loot he wanted in a raid or dungeon, or repeating some meme excessively, wasn't so bad, etc.
---
We plan to play with our kid. He'll be about the same age, and he is pretty annoying too - but it will be on us as parents to reign it in and make sure he is a productive raid member and not being super obnoxious to his guildmates. The no talking on vent/discord thing might be a good way to curb that.  I also think that as a kid, being in a group of (assumed) adults is pretty darn cool and you want to do your best to put forth behavior that lets you be included. You get to hear all the "Adult talk" including occasion curses and inappropriate jokes and you are part of the group.
---
As for politics and the like, the world is more of a F'd up place than it was 18 years ago. I hope some how we can keep conversations to games and pop culture and life experiences and keep politics out of it. As rule, you are never suppose to talk about money or politics with friends.
---
.
---
&gt;everyone in the pserver community knows that Feral tanking is very much not a meme at all.
---
Thank you!  finally someone that specifies that this is only relevant on **private servers**
---
I think like one/two Shad Priests gets a raid invite for the shadow debuff to help warlocks, or maybe that's not even correct?
---
Make an effort to get good swords when leveling. You’ll definitely want Vanquisher’s Sword, a quest reward from RFD for both horde and ally. If you’re horde, you’ll also want to get Sword of Omen from the SM quest. Put some instant poison on them bad boys (or 1 crippling/1 instant if you want) and you’ll be set for quite a few levels.
---
We have a 3 month old. I'm hoping by the time Classic releases she's moved her sleep schedule up just a tad. Right now she doesn't go to sleep for "the night" until close to 11. Which means I can only play during her short naps or if the wife has her. Weekends though are awesome. I usually have a few hours in the morning while they both sleep until 9/10/. 
---
They were leashed in vanilla even with correct kite mechanics similar to AV bosses whereby after moving a certain distance they'll simply reset.  
---
however other bosses (Anachronos for example) weren't ;)
---
That's true, I was thinking that boots, even green ones, can last a while but w/ white ones you'll get them right off the bat too, that's not the case w/ green items typically. 
---
Thanks!
---
Nah you’ll find lots of people willing to join. Many will probably move onto other guilds that raid, but you’ll have some lifers if it’s a positive environment. 
---
Haha, oh the joys of parenthood. Could have told me Classic was coming out before I didn’t pull out.
---
Shit, with dungeon blues I wrecked BWL geared people in Vanilla. Wouldn’t mind me some MC epics this time around :D
---
Shaman tanking largely failed in vanilla, especially at mid-levels, due to the amount of ignorance on talents, stats to go for, and proper tanking knowledge.
---
* Rockbiter Weapon&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;anything else.  Many level 20+ shaman would use flametongue or windfury while tanking and its' just a bad bad idea. 
---
* Earth Shock only, every cooldown.  Max rank below level 60, and then once you hit 60, either rank 5 or rank 7 as needed.
---
* Talents.  Many shaman would ignore the shield talent at Tier 1 Enhancement, but honestly that by itself will help you immensely.   Parry talent also helps, as does the +defense talent.
---
* Statwise, you want to go for Stamina&gt;agility&gt;strength in terms of tanking stats.  Don't ignore int/+spell damage though.  
---
* Early Level Rotation LB&gt;Earth Shock&gt;Magma Totem (Searing Totem if up against a boss or single-target only)
---
* Late Game Rotation CL&gt;Earth Shock&gt;Fire Nova Totem or Magma totem depending on if you need snap threat or not.  I preferred nova totem since it provides immediate aoe, and has less a chance of being destroyed, since magma will frequently pull aggro and just die early.
---
* Lastly, group understanding.  They have to understand you aren't a warrior.  You WILL take more damage, you WILL take longer to get threat.  I'm not saying you should advertise yourself as a tank for dungeon runs, but in the situation that your group needs a tank, you can definitely tank anything below SM fairly easily.  Above SM you'll need to work hard, and people will need to give you a second to establish threat.
---
I really like his content. I haven't watched this one yet, will do shortly. I wonder if he says "I wanna say" at all in it though. I've noticed over time it's a bit of a common theme for him :P
---
It's correct once your guild breaks into BWL.  Early on your warlocks don't have enough gear to justify bringing a shadow priest TBH.  Once the warlocks start getting geared they really start scaling crazy good and buffing just 3-4 warlocks shadow damage with Shadow Weaving will net good results.
---
That's where I'm at. I started a couple of toons on a private server. Got them to 18 and 13. Enjoyed the hell out of it but before I got too invested I stopped playing. It's killing me because I want nothing more than to keep playing but I know in my mind it feels like playing a beta because those characters won't be my permanent characters. 
---
I played troll shaman during all vanilla. I Healed during raid but kept a pvp spec (my guild hated me, yes). I think 22/7/22 was good spec when you don't have too many stuff because it gives better survivability and it doesn't need too much mana compare do 30/0/21. 
---
If you have a good two hander (arcanite reaper was my first good weapon) you can also go 0/31/20  but WF proc are a bit random in my opinion, but it's very fun !
---
In the end of Vanilla when I had a lot of stuff, 30/0/21 was the funiest spec for me because I had huge crits and burst damage. I could easily kick ass in battleground and world pvp.
---
In my opinion, shaman was one of the best option in PVP. We were all noobs back in the days but I felt like I could beat easily any class except for the rogue, they were a bit tricky to kill! Demonist (soul-link) also at some point but I think they got nerfed before 1.12.
---
Overall, shaman was very fun because it had so many spells and it was very versatile. Shaman at not the "best" at something but offer so many possibilities and fun spells, definitly recommended it, I never wanted to reroll when I played it.
---
They didn't provide any honor in vanilla. As for gold, don't remember. 
---
I'd be down to join 
---
A lot of people want just what you want, and maybe try some raids later. So you'll have plenty of people who'd want to join you =)
---
There's also Stormwind soldiers in Silithus fighting the war effort there, otherwise Stormwind soldiers are absent from most other zones. MC/BWL was all the heroes with no help from the factions, Naxx has the Argent Dawn but they were a neutral faction. 
---
Shamans are among the most played classes on horde side. 
---
This is pretty much all my play time will allow, regardless if the guild I join is raiding or not. And I know from other comments/discussions this is not unique. I would say as long as it is an active, friendly bunch and one that understands RL commitments come first (a lot of this demographic will be people with full time jobs and/or a family) it’ll be fine.
---
You have my Cruel Barb!
---
I yanked horde side in vanilla. After a while I started letting the shaman die. Same with hunter pets. 
---
Sometimes it’s more fun to be passive aggressive with retards. Explain once or twice then just watch the shot show.
---
Also don’t forget...you can always kick a DPS. Very easy to replace
---
No, me!
---
Either tbh. I never minded. I guess in PvP DoT so you can run around more and PvE a bit more bursty as you don't have to worry about somebody smacking you in the face as much. I doubt I will be dpsing in PvE though as I will mainly be healing.
---
They did drop gold, I still have a level 20 warlock in stormwind that I used to summon a 5 man group to kill the archbishop (who was the city leader at the time) into the catacombs and kill.
---
He had a 5 minute respawn time and dropped 50-100g
---
How do I find these channels?
---
I was under the impression that there was going to be a check box to enable “Vanilla graphics”.
---
I’m kinda looking forward to having that option available.
---
I'm afraid I have to agree with you.. I would love to try out how bad meme specs really are, and if you could make them viable. But I would suggest against a full guild of them. I'm afraid it would be so bad it would be demoralizing, and break the guild.
---
In premades at least Shamans play Ele/Resto support spec 99% of the time because people think it's the strongest.
---
Your responsibilities as a support are kind of similar regardless of class so this transfers fairly well between classes. Dispel your team, heal the team, dispel the enemy. If all of those responsibilities are met, your job becomes looking for opportunities to set up kills.
---
Ele/Resto is the most offensively minded support in the game. I'd say Priests are the second most offensively oriented healer in the game, but even then they're miles behind Shaman in terms of damage output.
---
I think the lack of both advertising and that it was largely ignored during their investors calls is a good thing. Really feels like they are taking this is more of a passion project, than a commercial product that has to adhere to their "commercial checklist" of trying to please everyone.
---
Thanks for confirming, I knew there was something more specific relating to my answer.
---
I thought this was going to be what I did, but now I have a 60 druid gearing up to do MC and complete the War Effort and I’m loving it. Absolutely looking forward to the entire process again once Classic drops.
---
I'm sure some version of "TotemTimer" will come back once Classic Releases.  It makes managing your totems way easier and frees up your hotkey bars for other things.
---
This is exactly why mages pop off as hard as they do in naxx, due to ignite stacking. 
---
I wouldnt put it past a memespec guild to kill Twin Emps if the people playing knew what they were doing. I do agree that there would be far more hardship in Naxx overall.
---
I would say it comes down to the skill and preparation of the players.
---
&gt; No agony because im asuming i have to place another curse. I.e. Curse of Shadow.)
---
Someone else is providing shadow, I think we're using doom outside of the last 61s of the fight.  Head to Head agony is going to do more receiving our full spellpower bonus every application but on a 121s fight, that's 3 more GCDs and 437 more mana spent on CoA which could be used for tapping and shadow bolts.  And as dots can't crit but shadow bolts can, I'd be using doom once every minute.
---
Not sure why you got downvoted.  Yes, shaman are in high demand, just like paladins.  It's why it's such a pain in the ass to gear them both on each side.
---
Don't forget that raiding drops also didn't have faction specific drops.  You could see shaman gear drop as alliance, and paladin gear drop as horde.  
---
The check box just turns off the aforementioned extra options and sets sliders to appropriate values (not many sliders :). The models, textures, animations, lighting and effects (basically what sets the "look" of the game) will be exactly the same as in Vanilla. (Or at least that's what Blizzard is aiming for. As said, it might not be *exactly* the same but it'll be very close.)
---
Hah, I forgot about this bug. I’m having flashbacks now remembering this happening ALL the time.
---
I would love to join a guild like this 
---
I’d promote Esfand to A tier- I think his content is solid and well made. Alexsensual is D tier, and so is Taliesin. Tips gets demoted to B tier, and Staysafe is A/B tier.
---
If Blizzard releases classic "as a fan service to the community", it is logical they do not advertize too much for it, being a niche market and all.
---
If they advertize a lot more, it may raise questions from the Activision board members and stockholders... "Why are you investing in a 15 year old game?".
---
Keeping it low profile is the best way to be able to keep working on it steadily without much hassle. And the niche market it's aimed at knows they're busy on it.
---
only thing I don't mind about him is he goes pretty heavily into frontstabbing and /sit stuff which shouldn't be possible on classic
---
The Big One is hosted in france.
---
I think it is just jealousy talking.
---
Back in Vanilla I was fresh out of college, so I would put in my 40 hours a work and then play WoW. That was my life (with an occasional/rare social encounter with friends \[who also play WoW\] or family).
---
Now I have my job, and 3 kids and well, I can't just do only work and wow this time. I have to make sure my kids live another day . . . as it is, I am not sure how I am managing that . . .  
---
So, yeah. You no-lifers will get bored way before us with real lives . . . . and you'll be miserable. Meanwhile I will find "balance" in my life and just "enjoy" and "take my time" \[and be jealous of all those who can do more than me\]
---
Or we overestimate it...We are living in the Classic Bubble after all (being part of all the classic wow forums and talking to classic wow fans etc). 
---
Even more reason to go eng as pally
---
Where did you get this idea?
---
Agreed.  Too many people are worried about hype, but if you get official ads/hype too early you get "hype burnout" where people go from "anxious hyped" to "impatient hyped" to "angry hyped".  
---
Here's 3 examples of those statements progressing:
---
Stage 1: "Oh my god.  I'm so excited for Classic WoW"
---
Stage 2: "Woo! I can't wait for Classic WoW to release.  Only &lt;X&gt; more months!"
---
Stage 3: "It's June 22nd.  Why hasn't Classic WoW released yet?  I can't wait any more!"
---
so I should be farming gold on retail in order to play classic for free?
---
&gt; but they can be the best dps, and the best tank in the game. 
---
NOT in the same time. At best, a Warrior that heavily overgears the content, CAN tank and dish out very good dps. But that is an EXCEPTION, and it applies to ANY CLASS. An overgeared Priest CAN tank and HEAL in the same time.
---
HOWEVER, a Shaman, a Druid or a Paladin, can do 2 roles, above average, IN THE SAME TIME, regardless of the gear. This is why they are HYBRIDS.
---
Performing 2 roles, above average, IN THE SAME TIME, is the definition of a hybrid class.
---
A 31 points Protection Warrior will do CRAP damage. A 31 points Arms or Fury Warrior, if not overgearing the content, are mediocre tanks. No Warrior will be able to use the remaining 20 talents points to boost his damage or tanking abilities to a point where he can perform a secondary role above average.
---
A 31 point Shaman, or Druid, or Paladin, can use another 20 points in other talent tree, and be above average in performing their secondary role.
---
Technically, a Warrior IS a hybrid class, but only on paper. In reality, Warriors are NOT hybrids. And even if they can be considered hybrids, they pay a GREATER HYBRID TAX...because they do not have any spec that is 31/20/0, or 31/0/30, or 0/20/31, or 20/0/31, that makes them able to perform 2 roles, above average, IN THE SAME TIME.
---
As opposite to Shamans, Druids and Paladins, that can spec 31 points in one spec and 20 on another spec, and perform 2 roles, above average, IN THE SAME TIME.
---
Tanaris was my favorite zone leveling to 60 on my UD lock back in the day. I mostly grinded my way to 60, but it was the first zone I went out of my way to do all the quests I could find. When they we're all done I farmed the pirates for another few levels. Good times. Was on Gorefiend and it was a pvp server. Made a lot of friends in the pirate cove, and met a gnome warlock and we'd fight for hours. 
---
Priests and Warriors cannot perform 2 roles in same time, and be above average at both.
---
It is impossible.
---
The final circle would just be 20 rogues sneaking around each other trying not to get decloaked.
---
This is literally me in Elwynn Forest with everyone just starting their profs 
---
Well you can check all the polls, usually shamans and paladins land on the 7-9% right above druids. As they are one faction only, their percentages for each faction lie somewhere around 2x that amount, meaning shamans go around 15-20% of the population, which is right below warriors and tied with mages in popularity. This isn't accurate of course, as we can't tell from those polls how other each faction favors other classes over these two, but its somewhere around that anyway.
---
Pirates are a good farm spot, very out of the way 
---
Definitely did not expect to actually see my character here. According to this it took me almost a full year to hit 60. Maybe I didn't play WoW as much as I thought I did back then.
---
Thanks a lot for this website, OP. Gives me some insight into my old guild I'm hoping to reconnect with. There's even one guy that looks to still actively play on that server, though I don't remember his name. I'm gonna try to reach out to him tonight. 
---
I legit can’t tell if this is one of those “Don’t come to Colorado, it’s horrible here” posts, our you’ve just never been to that mountain with the plainstriders on it, or farmed the quilboar dudes that have them every 5 feet inside those thorns. 
---
I remember being in Tanaris when Paladins were given Hammer of Wrath. It was so cool to me that I just killed mobs just to use it on them. 
---
you're correct, totem presets came with Wotlk
---
Mind control is only really funny as alliance.
---
My first contact with that spell was a lvl60 NE priest standing by the freewind post and made people jump to their death.
---
\*Runs to AH to grab a shield for dps warrior friend\*
---
For sure you would have to take off work or school and play 20+ hours a day if you want a week 2 clear imo.
---
Only classes I think hitting 60 on week one is Druid lock and hunter and that’s assuming we have a smooth launch.
---
Then you have the gear grind. While 1.12 is easyer you still need FR ok tanks, the Aquila quintessence quest chain done and enough pots/elixirs/buffs to struggle through it.
---
Do I think people will do a week 2 clear? For sure... but I also thing there will prob only be a few guilds in the world that do.
---
The problem is that the line between "extra content" and "shameless cashgrab for stuff that should be in the base game" is becoming more and more vague.
---
Because you used to get the full game without having to pay extra?
---
Are you talking about classic release?
---
- doesn’t matter just find wherever you can
---
In general?
---
- Quest in whichever zone is your race’s zone, you will save some gold on ability training and mount at 40.
---
This is insanely relatable to me. This is exactly how I feel as well. 
---
Usually through other resources, if you want the Warrior one for example, there are other class links in the Welcome channel for them - [https://discord.gg/Skyhold](https://discord.gg/Skyhold)
---
ffs if it doesnt come with a shitty old compaq or dell gateway to play the game on, then ITS NOT AUTHENTIC AND LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE.
---
i  **DEMAND** shitty graphics and a horrible user experience, goddamnit.
---
oh okay. These are not however classic exclusively? I guess the conversation is mainly around retail wow ?
---
The polls I've seen clock shamans around 4-5% and pallies 5-6%. Anecdotally, if pservers are any kind of litmus test shamans are not one of the most populated classes by a long shot. I'd say 2nd least populated at 60 next to druids. 
---
Who gives a shit?
---
Poor Carine :(
---
True I just want to be spared the barrens color scheme abs chuck Norris 
---
No you won't, people will start to get burned out by 2 hour MC runs and get sick of other people not pulling their weight and they will leave for greener pastures. 
---
Classes with aggro resets are fantastic just for this reason. I mean, I'm not some horrible prick who kicks puppies irl, but if I  see a chance to set 3-4 monsters on someone running through a pack that I just pulled, I *will*  feign  death/bubble/whatever and watch whatever I was fighting chase the newcomer (who's already fighting a different thing).
---
I honestly didn't even realise this was /classicwow, heh :p But yeah, it's mostly focused around retail atm, I would imagine they will add Classic channels too though.
---
I am at stage 4
---
Hmm. I have the opposite feeling, as I played on couple private servers as well. But it's hard to tell by just observing what you see around capital cities. I found this poll, I believe it to be one of the biggest. I wish these polls had the class distribution on each faction separately. [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSKhcR57Lpsk4YIEWO-u-88xEXoZo2rT6mF9gl27ctRpcOlg/viewanalytics)
---
&gt;Hope to hell Blizzard gives add-on devs time to make these before classic launches
---
How'd that work? "Here you go, addon folks, you can have a month of pre-launch access to try and make some addons. Now, don't actually play the game tho, only make addons!"...
---
It'll be fine. So what if you have to play without addons for a few days or a week, it's not like it's unplayable.
---
It was and still is.
---
Or farm gold in classic and trade it for retail gold/token
---
But that is not what a DLC is... The Witcher 3 was a full game, but the devs *continued* to support the game by coming up with new stuff and adding it in DLC. Also, a DLC doesn't have to cost money - if the price is your problem it has absolutely nothing to do with DLC being a bad thing, it is the greediness of a company.
---
As I mentioned in my last comment, the problem is when a company abuse DLC as a fix for shipping a poor unfinished game in the first place, and then charging for DLC's.
---
I Dont disagree with anything you're saying. As a soon to be 30yo dad with two kids and a (somewhat healthy) WoW addiction, I just dont think you can understand where dudes like us are coming from.
---
Deciding to have kids is something that you cant really undo. While of course you love your kids, its 100% normal to go through a phase of finding balance in life that allows you to own up to your responsibilities while still finsing time to enjoy the things you are passionate about. 
---
I am a father, a husband, an army reservist, a full time employee, and a member of our raid team a couple evenings a week. It's a lot to juggle, and WoW is how I unwind at night after a long and shitty day/week. I wish I could play 100 hours a week, but that wont be possible anytime in the foreseeable future. 
---
It's a coping mechanism for people like me to point at no-lifers in WoW and say "thats not true happiness". Similar to "money cant buy happiness", it is of course only a half truth - and one that helps us to accept our own reality, so dont take it personally!
---
As a newbie and while in between quests at the time, I watched a level 60 human warrior of the opposite faction lay waste to an entire village of NpCs.  No level indicator, just a skull.  That’s all it took for me 
---
The Barrens!!
---
I believe I'll have no more than 3 non consecutive hours of available time per week for WoW. I'm debating if it's worth it at all at that point :/
---
I used to skip classes and fake illness to play all day lol. Can't have that anymore. 
---
Avoiding the barrens entirely will be rough, it is a huge level range with so many quests. You probably won’t want to grind out levels on the late teens. 
---
My daughter sleeps in late on weekends. Sometimes i will have to go in there at noon and wake her. It's great for peace and quiet in the mornings. 
---
I believe this man may be from the future
---
I remember accidentally stealing a vein from some dude in Burning Steppes maybe back around BC or Wrath. I didn't even realize he was a miner until he came up to a vein I was fighting on top of and starting mining it. I was like "hey that's mine" and he started flipping out.
---
Probably every gatherer has had that experience at least once. 
---
Yeah his whole Paladin guide revolves around /sit macros with reckoning. But it’s still very well put together and he did do quite a bit of research.
---
Most people despise release day DLC, just fucking include it in the game you greedy fucks
---
You can tank and smash face in pvp.
---
And CD projekt red is one of the few to do dlc in a good way. The majority do not. And it goes beyond just dlc. Remember when companies knew if they made a genuinely good game it would sell and they would make money? That's largely gone. 
---
Dont forget the salute emote when you walk by him in stormwind...
---
I mean it was intended to be a vanilla raid lol. 
---
Going to alliance from horde. 
---
It's tough to get out of my comfort zone, but I think it will be fun to have that nostalgia with just a touch of new game feel. 
---
As a healer my thought process is:
---
1. DPS are easy to find
---
2. I'm always looking for more tank friends
---
3. I don't heal people who talk shit to the tank
---
No wonder tanks and healers are such BFFs!
---
I mained an Undead Warlock from End vanilla to late MoP. I love the Forsaken. But I've never, ever rolled an Alliance character. I'm rolling a Gnome Mage. Should be interesting. 
---
Shaman will be easier to gear once you hit 60 because they can wear cloth, leather, and mail, so there are more gear you can roll on in dungeons. As a priest you have to cry every time a leather or mail healing item drops and it gets vendored or DEed.
---
I completely agree that companies abuse DLC as a way to ship unfinished products and later charging the consumer DLC's to fix the base game. My point is, that is a whole separate issue. It's not the DLC that is a problem, DLC is a wonderful format to give some new stuff to a game. The problem is greediness from companies.
---
Also, DLC isn't meant to replace expansion packs, it's two separate things. Again, many companies (looking at you, EA) abuse all those things, but look at CD Projekt RED. The Witcher 3 had a ton of DLC. They were not things you needed in the base game, it was just continues support of the game by bringing new fresh stuff - *for free*. When they released an expansion pack, now *that* cost money, but that was a true expansion with a ton of content, a game in it self.
---
Day zero DLC for money is a problem. DLC to fix things that lacked in the base game. Those are problems. DLC in it self? They are amazing. Continued support with fresh stuff for your favourite game - how can that be a bad thing?
---
I don't know about Vanilla days, but I found some forum threads from Burning Crusade in late 2007 to early 2008 discussing the vague possibility of melee-immune Rogues. BC had been out for almost a year at this point, but due to the way Gems were changed along the way (as well as new itemization towards the end of BC), it wasn't until early 2008 that people started actually doing it and making videos, and by then Blizzard had caught on too. But instead of ending it right then and there, they decided to increase "Mob Accuracy" by 25% for the new Quel'danas encounters as a band-aid and rework Dodge and Parry later, with Wrath of the Lich King.
---
Personally I enjoy pvp servers more and I also played on a pve server from vanilla through wrath. For me its just a sense of not being limited in any way and adds a little spice to the gameplay. Sure, getting ganked in stv by that rogue sucks but its kind of motivating for me too in a way like " you mother fucker i swear to god if i see you again i will do everything in my power to see you die". Then things start to escalate, they call for reinforcements, then you call for some, then the entire questing area turns into a brawl for about 20 minutes and if your side wins there's a smug sense of satisfaction knowing they cant quest in that area for a while until the pop calms down. just my experience tho, i find it fun.
---
...or the Great Sea
---
I remember being a tank with the key. I started groups myself.
---
Jesus fuck did those groups fill fast.
---
usually hate these kind of memes
---
this one hits it right on the nose lmfao.
---
&gt;Ive tanked most content in Vanilla
---
In Vanilla or on Vanilla private servers?
---
I'm a firm believer of the old way of DLC. The one CD Projekt RED did with The Witcher 3 - DLC's are *free*. You bought a game, DLC are extras as a way to support the fans. Expansion packs are for payed extra stuff. A payed DLC can make sense if it's not big enough to ship as an xpac, but still more than the usual small DLC, so needs some kind of price for all the work. I'm still playing The Witcher 3 because of not only the game itself, but all the extra content for little to no money. They kept a reason to replay it, that is what DLC's should do.
---
According to efficient leveling guides I’ve seen and tested you’ll end up traveling all over the place. I’m leveling a Tauren on a server and you go from Mulgore to Durotar to Silverpine - not questing in the Barrens until 16.  
---
So if you want to travel I’d suggest visit a site like Joana’s or http://www.vanilla-questing.me
---
The trade off of levelling a priest is there's 0 downtime.  You don't ever have to stop to drink or eat.  So you may kill stuff slower, but that time is made up by moving on to the next mob instantly, every kill.  
---
Based on your description, go Warrior.  Reason?  Free time. Warriors are the class that requires the most commitment, but has the highest rate of return.  A skilled, kitted warrior is unmatched in PVP *and* PVE, no other class can say that.  In PVP, you are a demi-god, and if you find a healer, you are an *actual* god.  In PVE, you can top DPS meters or be a celebrity by main-tanking.  Rogue and Mage both have a high "fun" factor (except in raids where you are simple key spamming).  Mage utility is also nice with CC, Portals, Food/Drink, etc, plus their farming ability is unmatched.  Rogues are unparalleled in open world PVP and escapability, but in organized PVP they fall behind mages and warriors IMO.  
---
Looks at feral druid tanks, yep so much to do so interactive I totally don't just spam maul and get my face kicked in and that's it.
---
Hello! My main will be a Troll Hunter in Classic, but as I started playing in TBC, I don't know what proffesions were the best for Hunters in Vanilla. I was thinking skinning/leatherworking (for saving money, making my own equipment and a little bit of roleplaying), but i'v read in some places that engineering it's a must.
---
What do you think?
---
I've always mained healer and played ele during vanilla. Had ok gear but not great (did a few MC/BWL/AQ20/ZG with a friends guild who were semi-hardcore). He was one of the leaders and MT so he'd had mandate. I was reliable but not as good geared or knew as much as the other healers they could get. My job was not to die, provide a melee group with wf-totem (no totem twisting for me) and spam chain heal rank1. And I did just that.
---
I got ZHC my second ZG run and with my gear (something like 250SP and decent crit) I could just eliminate people. LB+CL combo could make 4k+ damage. A frostshock made 1,5k with a crit.
---
Most terrifying combo was as a 30/0/21 offensive healbot when my friend respecced arms. Down with windfury totem and just keep him alive. He could cut down enemies like a hot knife through butter. With shocks I could either interrupt a spell or slow them down wich was very useful.
---
I think people tend to exaggerate how much ganking and world PvP occurs on pvp realms. Sure, it's obviously going to happen here and there, but in general you aren't *always* having to look over your shoulder. When you run into a member of the opposite faction it's likely they just want to not pvp at the moment as well. They might be in the middle of a quest they want to finish.
---
Again though, it's obviously possible that you will be ganked, but it's certainly not "half your time" playing.
---
I personally like the danger and possibility of it happening. I'll definitely be on a pvp server. PvE, to me, just seems like ez-mode. 
---
I have an 8-yo daughter who is already well trained in catching nightfin snapper, winter squid, and sunscale salmon. Really hoping she'll grow up to enjoy these games as much as I do.
---
Maybe I'm not being objective enough, but I feel like most of my successful friends in life have spent much of their spare time playing video games, instead of watching brainless television/netflix shows. I really do believe that games like WoW can help to develop patience, social skills, problem solving abilities, and more
---
Absolutely, pservers have slightly inaccurate resistance values for bosses. That's going to completely invalidate +10 years of theory crafting and practice.
---
&gt; It's all just muscle memory, it's nothing fancy.
---
Well, that's only rotation. Now, I'd argue that a lot of specs are based on reacting to things, so you can't AFK on retail for many specs. Furthermore a few specs also do require some extra focus (not that there are many, but feral is a great example of at least taking some skill to do).
---
But actually I wasn't really talking about rotations, as you can get by with pretty much AFK playing. I was talking about the actual raids - there are not only more mechanics to bosses on retail, they require much more reaction and movement as well as use of utility abilities. No, LFR is not hard, but it is not only weaker bosses, they lack several mechanics. But try to do Mythic +, that is a whole other league than vanilla. Can't even compare them. And you don't even need to do Mythic +, anything above LFR is harder than vanilla.
---
I love vanilla myself, but people glorify it blindly nowadays and hate on retail no matter what. But saying vanilla is hardcore and retail is too easy is just objectively wrong. You might think vanilla is more fun, but that is a whole different matter.
---
Thanks! Yeah I do have time, but it feels good to fantasize about my future classe, it makes me feel wow classic is around the corner :p  
---
I think my choice will indeed be around the general feeling and atmosphere around the class. Maybe about some details too, like the old combat animation of the rogue, which might push me to the mage...   
---
I'll probably go mage undead.... or troll? Maybe Alliance this time? Ahah\^\^ 
---
Take it with a grain of salt due to private server but my guild cleared MC on Nostalrius during the second week of the server being live. We had a comp made out, we had dedicated people to farm hydraxian waterlords rep so that we had quintessences to get rag out and we only had a few people level professions such as alchemy and tailoring and the rest of the guild would funnel them mats so that everyone in raid that needed it had mp5 green crafted gear.
---
Depends on the faction, server type, and region.  If it's alliance, NA, RP-PVP....then yeah it's something I'd be interested in looking into as a holy/ret.  My wife probably would as arms war also.
---
Silverpine is a nice change of pace from the barrens. If you're going to do it, I'd head over almost immediately as soon as you get out of Durotar/Mulgore, since Silverpine is chock full of chains that start at lower levels, where the Barrens can very much benefit from starting out a bit higher.
---
Paladin:  You have a hotbar full of cheat codes.
---
Of course, release day DLC is a scum move. But no one said anything about release day DLC, the guy I replied to just said DLC in general. I'm arguing that DLC is a wonderful format when done right, hence relating to CD Projekt RED - several free DLC released post-launch of the game, that's just getting extra topping on your cake for free. But then DLC is not the problem, greediness from companies are - which I agree is a giant problem right now.
---
&gt;**pservers**

&gt;**theory crafting** and practice
---
Thank you

---
Its 15% debuff
---
I’m in the exact same boat. This subreddit generally leans pretty heavily towards pvp servers, but I’m personally leaning more towards a pve server. This is my reasoning: let’s say I go pvp. I’m going to get really annoyed when I get chain ganked while leveling and even at 60. And I’m going to ask myself why the hell did I do this to myself? But if I choose a pve server, I’m never going to have that issue. The worst case scenario on pve is that I really feel like doing some pvp. In that case, I’ll toggle pvp and hope something happens, or I’ll do some BGs
---
Skilled players rarely play gimped classes/races/roles though.
---
Well if I'm tanking they will learn quickly...you pull it, you tank it.
---
If you gave yourselves the last day of the second week to clear it, you putting in 10 hours a day for 13 days would only be 130 hours. That's 5 and a half days played. The world's fastest speed run in vanilla was about 115 hours and accomplished on a hunter. 
---
So say you matched that pace, you'd have 15 hours prior to the final day to prepare.
---
If your guild were able to accomplish this, I'm sorry to say I doubt you'd have contributed much playing only 10 hours a day. 
---
If you enjoy the social aspects most of the time, then honestly play PvP servers.
---
I rarely really have problems with PvP, because it becomes second nature to adapt.
---
Do a Stratholme run? Wait for all 5 to fly to Lights Hope Chapel and ride together as 5 people to the entrance, you will only be ganked by a dedicated gank squad. Everybody will fall short when the tank warrior keeps concussion blowing, 3 DPS nuke the ganker and a healer keeps everybody up.
---
Carry couple potions with you in the world if you are alone like invisibilty potions once you are level 60 and can afford it and you can avoid most encounters. 
---
You really only will be ganked if you put yourself at a severe disadvantage. If you enter STV as alliance as a level 30 warrior, you will have a bad time. Finish up all quests in Duskwood, do some Desolace and do the very first quests at Nesingwary as level 34/35? A lot less ganking.
---
Un'goro, STV and 1k needles (shimmering flats)
---
Solid pro-tip for any kind of video, changed my life realizing I could do that.
---
K so druids seem like this amazingly fun class to level but that seems to get crushed once they hit 60 and forced to spec resto which isn't the best and has a 30 min cooldown rez. Am I wrong here?
---
Hell storm cheers, brother from wind yeah
---
&gt;And CD projekt red is one of the few to do dlc in a good way. The majority do not. 
---
Well, I fully agree. But then it's *still* not DLC that is a problem, it's greediness of companies. CD Projekt RED is openly making fun of the whole gaming industry, taking shots at all the big companies being greedy. That, along with actually spending time making the game have shown to pay off for them, and we can only hope more companies will try that approach. 
---

Mage it's a safe bet, very good for making gold and a great DPS, but they are kinda boring in PVE. They are a lot of fun in PVP tho!
---
I'm arms all the way but will still tank. I can't remember but I'm pretty sure tauren looked badass in PvP as well. More heavy and less swift than orcs but it felt like insane reach and strength. I remember high warlord tauren just looking like a beast coming on a big mount to crit you all
---
 If you enjoy the social aspects most of the time, then honestly play PvP servers.

Do a Stratholme run? Wait for all 5 to fly to the questhub with its flight master in EPL (you arent allowed to call it by name  in this sub :D) and ride together as 5 people to the entrance, you will only be ganked by a dedicated gank squad.

Best class to watch porn.
---
You go through heaps of ammo, I couldn't play a Hunter without Engineering.  Otherwise you're stuck using storebought lower DPS ammo or relying on the AH/other people.
---
Wtf are you talking about? There are plenty of times I went back to SW (you know, an incredibly short fly from Westfall) to do something.. like ask in trade if there's a low level tank that wants to run Deadmines, or check my bank and ask in trade because I'm there.
---
Like, did you even play the game?
---
No kidding, comparing Witcher3 DLC to Dragon Age 3 DLC was night and day. CDPR basically kept giving away awesome stuff, then sold you two new games at a budget price. DA3 felt like it was some kid trying clumsily to rob me (seriously fuck you EA).
---
Realistically, PvP servers might hinder you leveling to 60 by like 2 hours of total time, tops, unless you actively seek out world pvp and engage enemy all the time. It's also going to be a lot worse on those established private servers, that you're currently playing on.
---
It sounds like you want to play on a PvP server to me! It does indeed open up something PvE servers can't emulate.
---
There's an addon that can handle totems like that and even swap between "setups" on the fly. Can't remember what it was called (will have to look it up in my addon folder) but it basically let you set 4 totems that you want to cast, and cast them all in order with 1 button (pressing it 4 times, that is)
---
And when you pressed the button it would re-cast any totems that weren't active. It was kinda like PallyPower but for totems.
---
Tank and healer BFFs lol. I love it. I'm rolling a priest and will now /1 Priest LF BFF tank 4ever pls n ty
---
When I played ally it was VC, when I played horde it was DM.
---
And plenty of Horde would go out of their way to run it -- that was part of the fun of Vanilla. Doing odd things like that.
---
Disc priest was the original monk
---
I disagree entierly with that. A skilled player on a good class stands out for sure. Skilled players with a good class are clearly going to top everything. Most people think that way and it works well. Skilled players on under performing classes do so for the challenge to prove they have value or that they can beat most other average players with a "Bad class".
---
If the motication of that player is to speed run Naxx clearly its not going to be with an under performing class. On the other hand if there goal is to out perform most people playing with a sub par class in classic, i bet that a skilled player could pull it off.
---
Its almost like different groups of people use different terms and different words and have different experiences. Who knew?
---
Yes. That was part of the fun of the game.
---
I ran a guild exactly this way in TBC and after some time we had enough to do 25 man's, I will say that this time around. I am inviting people through Reddit and I found some of my old guildies to join, but I think that's perfectly fine if you don't intend on running a raid. Some things that people forget is that guild alliances we're common in vanilla, and you could still get into another guild's raid runs, but you'd be subject to their looting rules also. I think if you just invite people you play with that would be perfectly fine but you just have to temper expectations of yourself and your guild members. I'm running a casual / family style guild like what you seem to be interested in, however I'm very upfront with people when it comes to raiding expectations, which is that we will do it, but it will be somewhat casual due to only two raid days. I feel like the more open you are with people the better everyone's experience will be.
---
I don't get the joke. Why no rogues?
---
Just have expectations of people, communicate them, and stick with them. Doesn't matter if they're 16 or 30, some people are gonna be able to function in a group, some people are utterly disfunctional. I mean you're in your mid 20s, you probably work with a bunch of other people in your mid 20s, are you sure you'd want to be in a guild with every one of those people?
---
To me, getting ganked a few times is worth it for what you get in return on a PvP server. The huge guild vs guild battles over dragon spawns, or skirmishes on the way to a raid, are just an extra level of awesomeness that you just don't get on a PvE server.
---
Some parts are indeed very annoying though. Especially nessingwarys camp in STV (atleast the GY is very close), and the Pirate Bay in Tanaris, come into mind
---
Yeah I'd go NE druid, because do we really need more orcs... You let them loose and they're all zugzuging each other constantly and soon FAMINE, then they just make another portal and go ruin someone else's world. I denounce orcs as a blight on this land!
---
If you can't get with your guild and wipe raids going into Blackrock are you really even playing the game?
---
I am really glad my friends convinced me to play PvP back in the day.  It has it's moments of annoyance, but it added an element to the game of unpredictability that was missing when I tried a PvE server.  Could never go back now.
---
We would happily do our mythic clears in Warlords (when I stopped raiding) whilst getting pretty drunk... honestly after 300 wipes on Archimonde waiting for everything to come together, any attempt after our first kill felt very AFK at least up until the final phase. 
---
When you've experienced every possible situation in the fight, it does become muscle memory, even to react to emergency situations. Granted, the majority of the playerbase probably didn't have this amount of experience, on top of the hundreds of Archimonde heroic kills from selling the mount.
---
The Hunter: Easy to play, hard to master.
---
....and also a con. Didn't read the post, I take it.
---
"dispel magic" - he probably meant from his own allies which is more important usually.
---
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
---
I remember totem management just being boring and tedious. Even moreso than buffing.
---
For me totem management is the most fun part about playing shaman. But thats just me :)
---
My recollection was that Cairne was originally not leashes but was leashed at a later time. Not sure about other guys.
---
&gt; Don't forget that raiding drops also didn't have faction specific drops. You could see shaman gear drop as alliance, and paladin gear drop as horde.
---
Blizz might fix this, seeing as private servers have fixed it so that Alliance raids don't get Shaman gear and vice versa.
---
Even then, Zelda does it right following that same formula. WoW just always misses the mark. I think they lack characterization. Or maybe good characterization. I don't feel for Sylvannas or Anduin ANYTHING that I felt for Lich King. You can have world ending stories. You just need damn near perfect characters to make it interesting.
---
I believe that there will be people dedicated to doing that, but I just think it's dangerous on your health and psyche. Half the fun of vanilla was all the quirky things that happen as you level. I'm totally being judge-y and I don't mean to, but it just seems like I want to put my two cents in for your sake. You don't earn any medal for world firsts on a 13 yr old game. People will say "cool" and maybe you'll be server famous l, but maybe because I'm old now but that stuff just isn't interesting and I would caution you from grinding that hard. Burn out is also a thing and MC wasn't that hard, why sit around for months for the next content patch to drop with just pvp to do since you already have MC on farm.
---
How simplistic.  
---
So your sample size is only a few mobs?
---
Didn't take into account the bonus parry and dodge chance, with the way parry works in game in regards to weapon swigs.  
---
Didn't take into account riposte.  
---
Didn't take into account the CD reduction on spint and evasion.  
---
Didn't take into account AR and BF.  
---
Not that it would've mattered, since it appears that you didn't look into hit rating, as I advised you to do earlier.  
---
Going from 0% to 5% hit while leveling isn't comparable to adding 5% hit to your "blue" gear(whatever that means) at level 60 and fighting mobs that are your level or lower. 
---
A for effort. But all you've proven, once again, is that you're clueless.
---
&gt;  Stormwind noblemen can gtfo.
---
Erm, but wasnt it because they were manipulated by Onyxia?
---
Depends on your definition of "drastically" I suppose.
---
Duskwood is best woods
---
I understand completely what you're saying. And what I'm saying is that you're absolutely wrong.
---
10h/day is probably about what you need. Youll have time to level skinning, probably mining with upped spawn rates they had for new server launches or with sharding.
---
If youve never played 10h/day for a few days straight before, well, its gonna be a heck of a ride. I did that for 3 days back in retail and that was more than enough for me. Level 50-60 Hunter in 2 days followed by getting into full level60 blues on the 3rd day followed up by a ZG. At the time I was kind of obsessed with the game though. Dont think I could ever manage that again.
---
Youll probably aim to get 60 in the first 10 days, followed by a few dungeons and helping your guild farm the crap out of Hydrax rep and MC trash grind if you can.
---
Especially for mages, yeah?
---
Did you just assume my faction? Wow 
---
PvP server all the way.  As a warlock yes i get ganked a lot but if you are good enough you can actually beat people, it's so fun to at least try and get better.   It helps me  remember to always keep soulstone and voidwalker up with hotkeyed sacrifice.  I have definitely killed rogues that try to gank me.  Pop void sac, throw on dots, die, revive with SS, instant summon VW, sac again, more dots, kite.  It's really quite hilarious..  plus  a few times I caught rogues in stealth I throw a dot on them so it breaks their stealth and they have to waste their cooldowns or just completely die on the spot.    Even if I die, most times it feels like I COULD have won and it's just fantastic.  It's my favorite part of the game - trying to beat gankers and sometimes succeeding.  
---
I don't think any number of buffs will beat the mage who gets credit for the rolling ignight.
---
This stuff blew my mind as a teenager. I felt I was doing the obviously righteous thing in ending this threat to the city. Then fighting him you realize hes not who you thought he was. By then its too late. Cut off his head and get some sweet loot.
---
10-15 levels realized how twistsd the world of Azeroth is.
---
VanCleef was my Azerothian Red Pill.
---
Great video! I like your style and I appreciate the lack of fluff.
---
It doesn't fucking matter one bit imo. If your raid group is unable to down a boss, it isn't because some guy rolled one race instead of another. It's a lack of preparation or coordination, or a mistake happened.
---
And who cares if your dps is 0.5% higher, or 5% higher, than the dude next to you as long as the boss is dead? If you do care, you should be more concerned about having all the potions, flasks and food to maximize your damage (most people will be too lazy for this, but will still get on reddit to preach about that sweet 2% dps boost from their precious racial)
---
For grinding and leveling, it's meaningless. 5% damage against beast as a troll, 5% pet damage as an orc, 2 or 3 minute cooldown aren't going to affect you. A marginal racial advantage might save you what, an hour on your total leveling time MAX? Having proper questing routes, rotation and talents is what matters. For farming, class choicr and strategy is what matters. And of course gear matters. 
---
The bullshit you can pull off with racials in pvp is way more satisfying, even is pvping casually.
---
I had all keys on my warlock - I offered group summoning services. Good times.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_effect
---
**Osborne effect**
---
The Osborne effect is a social phenomenon of customers canceling or deferring orders for the current soon-to-be-obsolete product as an unexpected drawback of a company's announcing a future product prematurely.
---
The term was coined after the Osborne Computer Corporation, a company that took more than a year to make its next product available, and eventually went bankrupt in 1985.Pre-announcement is done for several reasons: to reassure current customers that there is improvement or lower cost coming, to increase the interest of the media and investors in the company's future prospects, and to intimidate or confuse competitors. 
---
When done correctly, the sales or cash flow impact to the company is minimal, with the revenue drop for the current product being offset by orders or completed sales of the new product as it becomes available. However, when the Osborne effect occurs, the quantity of unsold goods increases and the company must react by discounting and/or lowering production of the current product, both of which depress cash flow.

---
Currently I'm planning on going this spec [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxdNio0zVZxfzoh](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxdNio0zVZxfzoh) when I hit level 60.
---
Can't remember in what guide I found it, but I really like it because it allows you to still be relevant in world PvP and also gives you some great talents for tanking such as Improved Shield Block. Last Stand isn't bad either.
---
&gt;Exactly why i want to make War Prot once Vanilla releases even though i never tanked in vanilla before. Should be fun to learn as well :p.
---
One word of caution, I leveled 1-60 in Vanilla as Prot, it's slow.  Like, really slow.  Awesome for dungeons, but pretty painful trying to solo. YMMV.
---
When raiding you rotation is  
---
1. Shadowbolt  
---
Not many macros required
---
Simply put, it'll take all your time. 
---
Don't level professions (apart from first aid, and some cooking for cooking quests), they slow down leveling significatly. and warlocks got free mount anyways. so it's not efficient for warlocks. 
---
I'd suggest and what i always do, to pick up enchanting, which let you disenchant any item, with no leveled up profession skill.
---
You'll get professions at 60 at your downtime (you'll need tailoring as a warlock). its much more efficient time wise.
---
Now, even fast leveling take at least 5-6 days /played from the average tryharded. you aren't a joana doing your route perfectly for the 20th time and not a hunter.
---
2 week mc clear is 12 days.
---
6 days played is 24x6, so if you play 12h, you just hit 60 at that time you need to enter mc with your guild. 
---
and mind you after 60 you need at least 1-2 days to get at least some prebis pieces and blues and consumables, so you wont be a total liability in the raid.
---
Then take in mind possible launch problems and all that jazz.
---
so i'd say you to play around 14 hours a day at least.
---
if you'd level faster and lets say 5days then 12 hours a day.
---
Dun Morogh, Westfall and Redridge. 
---
Dun Morogh because that was the first time I ever experienced the world when I created a Dwarf Warrior on my friends account and knew I had to play this game for myself.
---
Westfall because I met a good friend that I am still friends with to this day (and planning to return to class with) while questing there.
---
Redridge Mountains because I had a rule that if I leveled a character to at least level 20 and start questing in the Redridge Mountains, that I would keep that character as an alt ( I created/deleted a lot of characters ).
---
Honestly though, I could recall a specific memory for every single zone that I leveled through. Those are just some of my most memorable.
---
This is great! I see I started my gnome rogue on 14 March ‘09, which has been my main ever since. Thanks for uploading OP!
---
As you say yourself, that is more of a special case. Anything can become trivial after enough practice. However, I disagree that it becomes pure muscle memory - because you still need to *react.* In that situation all muscle memory does is letting you effortlessly do the movement / ability you need, but you still need the mental reaction. If it is pure muscle memory it means you could technically learn to do it blindfolded with no audio. But you can't unless the encounter is 100% scripted. But they aren't, things happen differently. Even if you tried every outcome, you can't know which one it will be at any given attempt.
---
some of the best friends ive made in wow started from randomly bumping into strangers in the world and helping them or them helping me.  adds a nice extra layter of gameplay you simple dont get in pve servers.   also how boring must world bosses be on pve servers if there is no pvp competition? thats a huge part of vanilla.
---
World PvP is one of the biggest draws to classic for me.
---
I can't wait to harass same-level people on my Rogue twink.
---
Sucks to get ganked while you're trying to level but inversely it's really fun to gank people while they're trying to level. I like the extra dash of evil that comes with PvP servers.
---
Sorry I meant in PvP! Clarified in my post 
---
If you want efficiency, skinning and another gathering such as mining. You’ll want to be careful here though so you’re not spending too much time gathering opposed to leveling.
---
But, that way you can save all the mats and power level engineering later.
---
Skinning is nice early on to vendor skins for monies.
---
I don’t think it’s just going to be a few times though. I saw your other comment and I think your underestimating the amount of gankage and general ‘red=dead’ mentality that will occur. 
---
I do agree about the other stuff you said. Man, it’s a hard choice though. I’m still not 100% decided 
---
Engineering is a must for a Hunter, it will help you a ton. The second primary is up to you though, LW or Herbalism.
---
LW = Make your own pre-raid BiS gear. You can craft a few things for players for some gold aswell.
---
Herbalism = Easy gold farming
---
My first impression of Tanaris was getting ganked in Noonshade Ruins. It was 2006 and my server was still very PvP-intensive.
---
Can't decide what to play. ** Halp.**
---
* Warrior - I leveled one to 30 on a private server.  My experience was... rough.  I have a newfound respect for tanks.  Not a fan of melee only and they have too high of a commitment level (skill ceiling + gear dependence) for me.
---
* Paladin - I played one to 60 as my first character and it nearly killed me, although I love PVP healing and would love the survivability, I just can't take the grind or buffbotting
---
* Druid - never tried it.  When I played vanilla these guys were always considered a joke.  Fun in their own right, but nobody took them seriously in PVE or PVP.
---
* Mage - my second class I took to 60.  I loved the utility, deadliness, and lore/style of the class.  However, as fun as PVP was, PVE was boring as hell.
---
* Rogue - never tried it.  Not a fan of melee classes but rogue always struck me as the "fun" melee class.  It seems like a blast to play solo but otherwise they struggle to contribute IMO.  Also not a fan of the fact the class is super crowded and I won't be desired for groups.
---
* Hunter - never tried.  I like the ranged damage aspect.  I like the toolkit.  I like the concept of pets (I think).  I like the easy leveling experience and casual nature of the class (easy to learn, hard to master).  I do not like the fact the class is crowded and that I won't be desirable to groups/raids.  This is one of my "top 3" choices at the moment.  Curious what faction/race would be best?  Leaning NElf because daddy wants to shadowmeld.
---
* Priest - my third and final class I got to 60.  I loved melting faces with Shadow.  It almost felt too easy.  Once I got bored destroying people I respecced to Holy and still had fun.  I enjoyed being "the most important guy" in the BG.  If my allies kept me alive, we would win the encounter 98% of the time.  I hated the fact I had to spend 50G to swap specs, and given my lack of time now that is virtually impossible for me to do... while I have very fond memories of this class, I think I need to branch out.
---
* Warlock - never tried.  I like the "utility caster" aspect.  I think I like the pets.  I love the free mount.  I don't love getting my ass handed to me by melee.  Warlocks always gave me fits as a Mage and Priest so I may have a bit of an overinflated sense of their power in PVP.  In PVE Warlocks always felt like a novelty, kind of like Druids.
---
* Shaman - haven't tried.  Another one in my "top 3".  Although I know hybrid classes have problems, I played mostly alliance throughout my life, so Shamans have a good bit of allure for me.  The fact you can be a viable caster OR melee in PVP, or a viable healer OR melee in PVE seems great to me.  Having 4 viable archetypes to choose from in a single class is unheard of.  I *think* this class has enough flavor/tools to keep me entertained while not overwhelming me.  
---
So... there we have it... leaning Hunter or Shaman it seems.... ?
---
Yeah, as this guy said you probably want a gathering profession.  At least to start.  Hunters can farm well so buying mats to supply your crafting wouldnt be a huge issue but on fresh server it may be more difficult.
---
I'm nt certain I'm rolling priest yet, but if I do, I'll almost certainly be hitting up a friend leveling enchanting for wands. If that wasn't an option, it's almost mandatory to go enchanting myself and just drop it once I get my wands.
---
It’s not going to matter your dps will be shit either way
---
Im not seeing it
---
So much PVP in Tanaris. Even on PVE servers...
---
Was it a rogue? :P
---
Not even close. 
---
Just looked into that site and it seems strange to head to Ashenvale as a human. It takes so long to get there. 
---
Which SM? If its Arms I understand why no one wanted in, that dungeon is for Warriors only haha.
---
10h a day would mean that you’ll hit 60 in less than 6 days. This isn’t crazy, but it’s still pretty fast. Considering you’ll get pushed behind the curve after your first 10 hours session, it might be a little tough to even hit 60 in 14 days. Let alone have the gear to raid (not that you need much)
---
I would say, if you're a social guild, you probably never want to start raiding. There was an awesome social guild on a PS I was on. As soon as they started raiding, the whole atmosphere changed and it all fell apart.
---
Engineering and armor smithing. You'll get a lot of use out of engineering trinkets and bombs, use the armor smithing for a few early pieces and eventually start making and selling lionheart helms. Ore was relatively cheap in vanilla so you shouldn't need the gathering ability. Definitely level your cooking though.
---
I think memespec friendly more means you a ret pally or an enh shaman, one or 2 shadow priests, maybe a boomkin.  That's memespec friendly.  16 meme spec dps isn't meme spec friendly it's meme spec priority.
---
I remember watching a video that mentioned there is some NPC in azshara that you need to pick up an important quest from at 60. Anyone know what that is? I'm trying to get general goals straight in my head to prepare so I'm not wasting time or doing things in the wrong order in late game.
---
Right? I think I might've gotten more enjoyment from actually running around in the open than from any of the content (other than ZF, of course).
---
As Alliance?
---
I used to play retail vanilla and I currently raid on a private server. Most of us play with this mindset already and its hyoer competitive.
---
A fire mage being fed ignites from other fire mages is untouchable 
---
Next up is fury warriors, rogues, and warlocks in that order. If melee can stay in range, they will do the most single target dps, excluding the super mage. Warlocks who dont have to worry about threat can play in an entirely new way.
---
Everyone else is somewhere below this 
---
Cant speak for Horde players.
---
Threat isnt an issue because you can also push that to cheese levels using the same mindset as cheesing your dps.
---
Mining to make things a lot cheaper on you. At the very least to level it. 
---
There's often a lot of rogues so it's the most likely class a group will already have. Sometimes they'll already even have 2.
---
tirisfall 😎
---
Hunter here. I'm going to go Skinning + LW to level then drop skinning for enchanting once I hit cap. Farm instances and DE loot to help level my Ench skill.
---
If you're determined to take Engi then I'd say grab mining as well. Mats are expensive. Skinning just for extra gold is a decent plan but the market will be mega saturated with hides from everyone leveling at the same time so you'll mostly just get vendor rates.
---
I was going to do exactly this until I discovered yesterday that Taurens cannot use Undead mounts. A huge disappointment - those giant kodos are so ugly.
---
I can definitely say that from my experience playing Paladin the absolute worst PLAYED class in Vanilla was Priest.
---
Against a descent Priest, a Paladin stands no chance, Mana Burn, heal yourself at \~50% and kill the Paladin at your leisure.
---
However, this only occurred in about 1/5 fights I would say, Id say about 4/5 Priests were SPriests that only knew about like 3 spells in their spell lists. CONSISTENTLY, the fights against Spriests would go as follows;
---
1. Mind Blast opener
---
2. SWP (Cleansed instantly)
---
3. Mind Flay (the slowing effect doesnt work due to Blessing of Freedom)
---
4. Spam either Mind Flay because I am in melee and interrupting the Channeling constantly or spam SWP because im Cleansing it
---
5. At like, 20% health, drop Shadowform and start healing, get HoJd and burst down.
---
Its really amazing how so many people just didnt understand their own class, let alone other classes back then. Most other classes didnt know how to play either, a Mage Frost Noaving me with BoF, then CS Frost Novaing immediately after, despite the immune message, Shamans never using grounding totems, etc. But Priests, at least from the perspective of a Paladin, who they hard counter, was the most jarring for me.
---
I need help! D:
---
I’ve narrowed down my pickings to three combinations; female dwarf holy priest, male human protection warrior, and male nelf rogue (any spec). 
---
I’ve got a background in maining dps in basically every mmo I’ve ever played. In WoW, I was too young and stupid to raid in vanilla, however, in tbc I did do some raiding as a fury warrior, and this continued through Wrath. In recent years, I’ve been a main dps in FFXIV, with aspirations of switching to maining tank. 
---
Do you think I should use classic WoW as an outlet for these aspirations and follow my dreams of being a tank main? Or should I stick to what I know and be one of 5 million melee dps? OR just try something completely new and be a she-dwarf healer!!?!
---
Engineering/mining.   
---
Alt w/ herb / alchemy.
---
If you want to be a serious tank you need serious arcanite bars.   Farming DME very easy way to get them (still takes a while), but get gold from the de’s and such as well. 
---
Just have some other armorsmith make your lionheart helm and strongholds.
---
Because healers will hate you if you gank their resto gear. You can do it and pick up a solid leather +healing set, but tanking to roll on something like Animated Chain Necklace when the healer doesn't have already is a huge party foul.
---
Im not sure the meta game now.  But in vanilla we stacked armor/stam on our pvp gear.  +healing/regen wasnt super important because fights were typically much shorter.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Necro-Knight%27s_Garb. BIS chest, sexy armor and high stam.  AQ 2.5 was also high armor if i remember correctly.
---
I'm a fan of PvP servers because it's a danger you can't just opt out of. Sure, if you just want to farm it might be annoying, but take it as part of the game. Okay, so some *\*insert opposite faction\** scum decided to attack me? Well, I'll either try to avoid dying again, or taking up the fight. Either way, I just became much more absorbed into the game.
---
Also, not playing a PvP server does remove a lot of things from you, but playing on one doesn't really remove anything, only add some annoyance once in a while. It really isn't that bad with ganking if you play smart and while leveling you always have several zone available. Is Redridge taken over by the Horde? Move on to Duskwood for an hour or two.
---
Lastly, this perspective does come from a long time PvP player (vanilla till BfA). I generally do stand a chance unless I'm vastly outgeared or outlevelled. If you can't really 1v1 nor know how to get away from something like a 1v2 then it might be more annoying to pick a PvP server.
---
Even shamans can tank dungeons quite well.
---
Dwfinetly Desolace, you can tell by the water
---
Mage farm is easy mode.. but yes. 
---
I have a kind mage friend that helps my poor warrior ass grind- I run around and gather packs and then he can AOE.  We've done some monstrous AOE pulls with me helping with demo shout or taunting ones that resist blizzard/etc or random adds.  One epic time I had to challenging shout/shield wall and it bought us just enough time for him to get another frost nova without getting owned and finish the pull.  Good stuff. 
---
But mages are seriously ez mode for leveling with that AOE grind.  It's absurdly OP once you understand how to do the pulls and if you have the place to yourself fuggedaboutit
---
Group: LF tank and healer
---
Tank joins group, sees fury war, shadow priest, and cat form druid O_o
---
2 hours later, LF1M Tank Scholo , BOEs and Flask recipie are yours
---
Stormwind Dwarven district. I'll never forget that feeling of coming back in from westfall, having farmed my tin, smelting everything and having the blacksmith teach me more recipes. Crafting some green pants to replace my white ones.
---
Its a little sad I know I won't get that feeling back, kinda like a sense of wonder. I still can't wait
---
Go private server hero!
---
And that's after they buffed a lot of MC items, on release they were even worse. My point is that the devs clearly did not do extensive analysis of anything endgame, so the exact state of PvE balance was not intentional. 
---
Do I want it changed now? Hell no. But it's ridiculous to try and present it as a perfectly designed master plan by Blizzard.
---
Teldrassil in general, since my first character was a night elf. Ashenvale as well because of that.
---
Desolace and Winterspring are also up there simply because I have great memories of leveling in those zones while listening to Linkin Park.
---
Tanks will hate us. Mohaha
---
MadSeason is my YouTubing inspiration. True story.
---
Another great video by one of the best Classic WoW Youtubers. I plan on trying out classes I’m not that familiar with when Classic arrives, such as Paladin, Priest and Warlock.  
---
LMAO at all of the druids thinking they're gonna tank anything but dungeons in Classic.  If it's anything like real Vanilla, just get over it.
---
Private server heros be gone!
---
By completing the goal you set? 
---
oh my god you are doing something wrong. my normal 1-11 run is 2 hours
---
Got to be right? The ruins being UC the town above being brill to the left the starting zone and little ol scarlet monestary hiding up in the top right.
---
I like the idea of Engi/Mining. Like you said, I can always have a guildie/friend craft my BOEs esp if I farm the mats myself. Is Engineering for MT the meta atm? How about post ZG/AQ?
---
The tempo is the same for sure
---
This man is from the future 15 years ago 
---
Tirisfal glades!
---
Nice drawing ^^
---
Westfall.
---
PvP server is the only way to play properly. It really cements the rivalry between the factions that PvE servers just don't have.
---
PvP servers engender emergent gameplay that can't happen on PvE servers. That's the real beauty of them. 
---
Besides it's only really STV, EPL, Silithus, Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge that you have to worry about the other faction.
---
At first glance I thought this was westfall.
---
I hate mining/herb on hunters because it is more BS to throw into your tracking rotation. Bonus points if you're a Dwarf hunter with treasure hunting. Skinning is the only gathering profession I like on hunters, but maybe that's because I always have a couple alts who do the mining and herbing.
---
I know people here are saying no, but I absolutely hear it
---
Agreed. There are lots of knowledgeable players who get bored following the established meta and like to experiment, in any game. Some people would probably prefer running BWL as a ret pally than Naxx as holy. 
---
I totally get you! I used to hate Darkshore, but with the lore it's really cool.
---
&gt; With the confirmed 16 debuff slots, will affliction warlocks be viable/optimal? 
---
Where is this confirmation you speak of?
---
Set on Rogue but undecided on Faction and race. I honestly like all except human as an option. 
---
Dwarves look cool and have great racials but not sure on how armour looks on them and the spinny finisher animation. 
---
Gnomes look interesting but may seem like a meme. Love their finisher animation at least.
---
Night Elves look cool and tall but am worried about the ears and hair clipping everything. 
---
Orcs look cool but seem very bulky to be a rogue, with giant shoulderpads and a goofy stealth animation. 
---
Undead look cool and have some of the best animations but they seem way too overplayed to me. 
---
Trolls again, look cool with armour fitting them quite well, but the tusks worry me and their racials don't compete in PvP vs the other 2 horde options imho.   
---
It sounds to me like you no nothing at all about Warlocks.
---
Stuck between a **Hunter** or **Warlock**. I like the idea that they're both easy to level, and are more or less self-reliant, basically "solo" classes since I'm not sure I'll have a lot of time to play. I wish I was cool enough to be a healer or tank, but I doubt I have the patience/dedication to deal with the downtime of the leveling experience. 
---
Problem with Warlock is the race options. If I go Alliance, I'll feel like an asshole for not playing a Gnome. If I go Horde, I'll feel like an asshole for not playing an Orc. Those (other than Nelfs) are my least favorite races, and while I can't stand to play an sub-optimal racial pick, I also don't think I'll be able to deal with staring at those characters for hundreds of hours. 
---
Hunter has somewhat the same problem, with Orcs being OP on Horde side, but at least on Alliance the difference is minimal. While people say Nelfs are better, at least Dwarves (my favorite race) are competitive. Another issue is that I hear that Hunters become increasingly bad as the end game progresses, both in PVP and PVE, which I feel like will be disappointing after putting so much time into leveling and end-game gearing the character. 
---
PVP is the most important thing for me (especially world PVP), but I will be raiding in a non-hardcore fashion. I know both classes pale in comparison to mages for raiding, but as long as I can get a spot I'll be happy. 
---
Haha damn, some of these replies are gold.
---
I showed up here like it was my first AA meeting hoping for the support and encouragement to finally put my addiction to rest. Instead I was greeted at the door by a guy holding a tray of jello shots, 2 girls in bikinis trying to pour jager and red bull down my throat, the most interesting man in the world offering me an Irish coffee and a chat, and 15 like-minded cool dudes sitting in front of the game with all my favourite beers cracked and a seat with my name on it. How’s a guy supposed to maintain sobriety?
---
I’ll see you fuckers in the summer. 
---
I'm not underestimating the amount of ganking. PvP servers since 2004, even played on Nostalrius. Nost probably had the most amount of ganking I've experienced, and it was typically located in STV/Tanaris. Nost also had 10k players online at any given time. PvP/ganking/corpse camping isn't nearly as big of an issue as people think it is, and weirdly it's mostly people that don't play on PvP servers that think it's an issue. Red = Dead will more often than not get YOU in more trouble than the red target, from my experience too.
---
Okay already knew that, there is also a stigma of resto druids for dungeons anyways? Pick your poison
---
Maybe I'm an idiot (probably) but I don't see where on this site you look up your character?
---
Blizzcon?
---
Pretty sure it's actually Tanaris. You can tell by the trees
---
The lake with the island in it and the scarlet monastery is a dead giveaway. Good old tirisfal glades
---
Playing on a PvP server kept me more engaged in the PvE (sounds weird I know), because having to pay attention to my surroundings while questing forced an interaction beyond mindless repetition with predictable battle rhythms. 
---
There’s a search bar at the right side of the site. Enter your character’s name there and find your server!
---
And if i have an alt with Enginering and Mining, would that be enough or are there some important benefits by learning the proffesion with my Hunter main?
---
It depends on if the people are fun to hang out with or not.  If all your 'weight carrying' players leave it's often a problem of not having fun instead of not going fast.
---
I did day 10 clear of MC with Progress on n0rthdale. I was lvl 59 as a HUNTER. 
---
My guildies all played 16-18 hours a day for the launch, we started running dungeons at day 8 evening then whole day 9 and 10 before raid. I was way more casual, I played 35 hours on launch but then played slowly at around 15-16 hours, and even took an entire day off to attend a family thing.
---
Anyway, 
---
10 hours a day for week 2 = 14 days = 140 hours = 5days 20 hours. This should on paper get you to 60 and some decent gear if you are actually good at the game. 
---
I would heavily advice going very hard on the launch like I did. The only problems with being stuck in any kind of zerg if you play 10h/day is on the launch  levels. So if you go hard and get like lvl 30 before sleeping, then you can chill and level all alone in the zones until 60. 
---
You can def. do skinning while leveling just don't waste too much time skinning for gold early on, only skin for skillups until you hit 30-40 range where gold from skinning makes it worth it.
---
Mining is hard to say though, if you are a pro at your routes and abusing cave spots you can do it but you are already at a rush so probably not worth doing.
---
I know people talk about the resto druid stigma, but I've just never experienced it on either end. Always loved tanking with a resto druid healing, such good buffs they bring along.
---
I'm thinking about &lt;Nostalgia&gt; as a guild name
---
Guess it took me 6 weeks the 2nd time around
---
[http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/20199597](http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/20199597)
---
Surprised it picked up data this old.
---
The world record leveling time on a non-private server is 116 hours. So at 10 hours per day you're looking at almost 12 days just to level assuming you can keep up a world record pace.
---
Can 40+ people, including classes that aren't well suited to speed leveling (not sure if grouping would help or hurt), play at that pace for 2 weeks straight, finish the quests/rep for aquila, get some serviceable gear for your tanks, and clear MC? I just don't see it happening.
---
Do you want to have interesting, unpredictable fights or do you only want to fight mindless robots all the time? Your choice.
---
It's actually Deadwind Pass. You can tell by the tower in the south.
---
That's well done. I enjoyed thinking through the landmarks to identify the zone and I'd love to see more like this from you.
---
It's the no consistent Rez spell is what people bitch about on here all the time rather than straight heals
---
Ah my mistake, definitely Tanaris
---
We don't really know since we don't have access to an authentic environment to test it out with accurate armor values, spell resistances and things of that nature.
---
We'll just have to wait and see until classic comes out
---
For sure but if you're going engineering, mining helps with mats. I've played since almost day 1 vanilla and I can say I've probably only leveled 4-5 professions all the way ever. It is most definitely not my thing haha.
---
Yes.
---
(1.) Do not use daggers in your mainhand while leveling. Dagger specific attacks require you to be behind your target, and it takes a lot longer to gouge and backstab than it does to just spam sinister strike. Leveling as daggers is super slow.
---
(2.) Remember to use a slow mainhand. This is very important for sinister strike damage. Any sword faster than 2.4 should be out of the running as a mainhand. Ideally you want 2.6 or slower.
---
(3.) Offhand should be as fast as possible for poison applications, but this is less important than having a slow mainhand, and is generally easy achieved. Feel free to use a fast dagger offhand to keep your dagger skill leveled in case you want to use daggers for raiding.
---
(4.) Get improved sinister strike first, then get remorseless attacks and relentless strikes in assassination, then, you can either go straight down combat, or or get the faster stealth speed from sub and then go down combat.
---
Shire
---
it will be very hard as a priest at level 54-56, because of lack of int gear :( 
---
I think the choice is fairly easy, because there is only one difference between the two: Ganking. 
---
Do you enjoy ganking or being ganked? Then PvP servers are for you! 
---
Do you not enjoy ganking or being ganked? Then PvE server it is. 
---
I used to play on a PvP server back in the days, because I was a child with glorified ideas of what world PvP looks like. I learned a lot during those days, including what "teabagging" was, but most importantly, that I don't actually enjoy the realm specific feature. You'll just have to decide for yourself. 
---
For level 25, do note you mostly take SV for Improved Wing Clip and Deterrence, but these does nothing against a caster. Personally I'd rather have Aimed Shot and Hawk Eye to fight casters at that level, but I do understand taking SV for fighting rogues. Still, at level 20 you get your trap, and I'd argue trap &gt; aimed shot is stronger than Improved Wing Clip.
---
For level 51 I'd move a point from Spirit Bond to Frenzy, simply to make sure that you get that Frenzy. It adds a lot of damage, and pre-60 I don't think you get that much use from Spirit Bond in PvP.
---
I would not go BM/MM simply because pre-60 the dmg from full BM is extreme. You loose 3 points in Unleashed Fury and all of Frenzy - and most importantly, Bestial Wrath. That alone is like an instant win against most people.
---
Personally I don't think there is much choice post-30 other than full BM to Bestial Wrath, then move into MM for Aimed Shot. Pre-30 BM is still strong, but getting Aimed Shot or Improved Wing Clip can be better if respeccing cost isn't an issue (and it's really cheap first few times anyway).
---
Legend tyvm! 
---
This is my assumption, I cant think of any other class that could boost their dps by this sort of margin.
---
lol k
---
Moonglade
---
Most people that will play classic for a long time already know about classic. Advertising doesn't really need to happen. Sure theyll get a few people by advertising but im that their price per customer just isn't worth the effort. I'm sure we'll get another trailer right before they release a beta (if they do), and a little marketing, but it wont be a ton of advertising. 
---
Engineering could be considered mandatory for tanking. Really helpful for threat generation.
---
You can try out the Dressing room over at Wowhead. It will allow you to check animations and armour on all races. Other than that I can only advice you to play what you think look cool, since you will learn to live with your racials.

Druid
---
I played a rogue, of all classes, on a pve server for 14 years. I still had plenty of pvp, even back in vanilla. World PvP happened anyway because we would just group and attack horde towns until reinforcements showed up. And there's battlegrounds.
---
That being said, I played on PvP pservers and it's much more engaging because you always need to pay attention to what's happening around you. Some of my best memories involved me being ganked because I was able to retaliate. I remember farming mobs in STV with my 43 hunter, a 48 mage jumped me and killed me. When I saw him again I managed to kill him and then camp him for a while. Even when you don't fight, you need to save your ressources against mobs in case someone jumps you. On a pve server, grinding mobs would be boring as a hunter, on a pvp server you're always paying attention to your health, mana, trackings, flare, trap, pet's health, what's happening around you, while weaving your shots between your auto... So the experience is overall much more engaging to me. 
---
If you pick pve server, pick a class that's fun and strong in BGs. 
---
Deadwind Pass
---
No shit? That’s why I’m posting these questions?
---
Hunter for sure
---
Warlock, priest and druid. I have never enjoyed any of those classes for some reason and won't touch them in classic either.
---
This looks like They Are Billions. 
---
Pfft, that's too easy. Wetlands!
---
Still only on 1 of the 8 classes the game offers...and on 1 of the two factions you can choose from. I get your argument but you can't complete MMO games; Just how I think you can't "comeplete" a game like Overwatch which is inherently PVP based.
---
&gt; This subreddit generally leans pretty heavily towards pvp servers,
---
I've seen the opposite myself. Most people I see on here get very touchy about ganking.
---
They did, around 150g, and 1500+ honor
---
this looks great. really a shame there arent more games set in the warcraft universe. 
---
like give us anything in that universe, give the IP to another dev and have blizz watch it closely.
---
could you imagine an assasins creed SI:7 style game set across eastern kingdoms. stormwind, all the surrounding zones. have it set during warcraft 3. 3rd person action adventure with a reimagined world.
---
and i hate assasins creed games but just an example. i wanna get more of azeroth's geography.
---
&gt; Gnomes look interesting but may seem like a meme. Love their finisher animation at least.
---
Their racial, as a rogue or warrior, is borderline god tier against some annoying comp matchups.
---
This post is based on ignorance, a balance druid is viable. Have you even played vanilla?
---
Week 2 clear is definitely a possibility, but 10 hours a day will not be enough, for any class. I would say if you really want to go hard 18+ hours a day and 4-5 hours of sleep and maybe 30+ hours on launch day will be required (speaking from pserver experience)
---
For the leveling i planned on going Skinning and probably stick with that for the first time to be able to get some devilsaur leather but after a while i think the devilsaur set gets less important and so gets skinning. Mining might be not that bad but often times the ores or stones for engineering aren't thaaaat expensive.
---
Also in the end its a choice of going to farm some ores in an contested pvp area or farm for example in a safe area like Maraudon and buy those ores from the auction house but therefore have an additional slot for another profession.
---
That is not allowed! (sarcasm)
---
I personally prefer PvP servers because getting ganked and having my leveling grind interrupted doesn't bother me that much.
---
But it sorta seems like you answered your own question. You don't want to be interrupted with your limited time to grind out levels. Go PvE and just flag for PvP when in the mood.
---
&gt;I can suggest Survival leveling as an alternative. Works great if it's an alt you feed gear to. Most will level BM early due to it being superior with inferior gear.
---
BM is also superior with gear. While leveling BM will simply be the highest dps and survival (through your pet). Look at the talents of SV, nothing even compares to BM for leveling where you don't have epics and mostly only greens (even if you funnel gear from a main you won't be fully updated blue geared). 
---
&gt;However, It's extremely satisfying to see a rogue try and gank you (I played a survival Orc for more rogue tears) and you destroy them in melee.
---
A BM hunter does more dmg in melee simply due to insane pet dmg.
---
It's fine if you like SV, I encourage people to level as they want. I always go MM once during leveling when I get the bow in Wetlands. But don't try to say SV is better in any way.
---
You better switch Tips with Esfand real fast. 
---
Rogue
---
Druids have stealth which is pretty useful in a lot of situations. Also, reduction of fall damage &amp; tracking humanoids in cat form.
---
Tranquility is a great AoE heal in raids, when your whole raid is taking damage.
---
Innervate is usually sought after by other non-Druid healers in your raid.
---
I'm not sure if Bears are the best 5-man tank at max level, but it is true that they are the best choice for 5-man leveling instances.They aren't great at holding agro for more than 3 mobs at a time. (Best paired with a Mage for Frost Nova to keep everything in one area.)
---
Travel form at level 30, this might be faster than Ghost wolf (the talents you get at level 20 for improved Cat form speed are the same speed as Ghost wolf.)
---
Swimming form gives you faster swim speed &amp; underwater breathing. Shamans have Water walking, instead.
---
They were leashed up until a few patches after the honor system 
---
I mean that the individual pulls are slower, it takes longer to kill the packs than it doesn't Mage. You're right as long as you hit the instance cap it's the same exp/gold per hour
---
1. It will depend on a few market costs, however the warlock mount quest costs roughly 400G
---
2. Warlocks are very keybind intensive, micromanaging your pet is a huge part of pvp. Not really many macros though. Some people like a delete soul shard macro for use with Imp DS. I had a macro for the Felhunter that would devour magic from myself without having to self-target.
---
3. SM/Ruin is very much a viable spec but doesn't play like you're thinking, you still spam shadow bolts. 
---
4. Fury wars are a bit rough for locks since they have two skills to break fear. Rogues can be tough as well. Hard to say since the lock specs all function very different in pvp. Conflag builds are the ultimate bursty glass cannon, where SL is the most survivable build in the game but is dependent on damage over time.
---
5. Mages and hunters are better farmers than locks since AoE grinding is tough to compete with, and lock pets don't do near the damage as hunter pets.
---
6. For raiding, bloodvine all the way. Unlike mages, locks don't get +hit from talents, so they're starving for the stat. In pvp, T1 and T2 are awesome stat gear.
---
7. You don't need tailoring, you can just buy a Robe of Winter Night for your pre-raid, pick up some extra int, and only lose +6shadow damage. However for pvp, particularly if you are SL, Robe of the Void is amazing. For the most min/max, you'll wait tailoring for the +2% crit with Bloodvine, but personally I'd take professions I want over that.
---
8. Tailoring/herbalism is awesome.
---
9. Gearing a lock is hard since you're nearly 1:1 competing with the mages for gear, and mages will want those badly since mage tier sets aren't great. Also, warlocks are far more popular now than they were when vanilla was live so expect more locks in raids as well. There's a few items that only warlocks and shadow priests go for like sash of whispered secrets, band of dark dominion, ebony flame gloves, but for the most part you'll be in direct competition with the mages.
---
10. Certainly more popular than in vanilla since locks were shit through the first half. They seem pretty popular on private servers, but they're also frequently rerolled since many people who thought they'd be throwing out massive shadow bolt crits get frustrated waiting for everything to die to dots, micromanaging a pet, and the utter lack of mobility.
---
11. Locks are...okayish...in premades. Destro is good for helping out the assist train to burn flag carriers, but other classes do it better. SL is good for holding flags, but again other classes to do it better. SM/ruin is probably the best most versatile pvp spec whose can switch roles in premades, but you're primarily there to piss off the other team with fear, seduce, curse of toungs, stuff like that. 
---
12. I'd say orc male for the epic size of their shoulders, but they look terrible on the class mount, so probably undead female.
---
I don't see any pumpkins
---
A raid with just meme speccs could easily clear MC. If people can't manage that they suck, or they don't like a challenge. I bet both.
---
Skills&gt;Speccs
---
People best learn to use their whispers and /who lists to save time. You might be advertising to an empty room.
---
I've witnessed people doing a LFG for over 4 hours - when there were only a handful of tanks online, most of them in raids. I remember spending a half-hour myself whispering people and discovered everyone online wasn't available to tank, so I was able to do something else with my time rather than shout into a void. And then, many times, you discover that person you want isn't even looking at Trade/World chat and would be more than happy to join - and spamming that channel was a waste of time in the first place. I've joined groups who complain they can't find a healer for the past hour and I send two messags and get a healer instantly, with a "thanks for asking me!"
---
&gt; I thought this was westfall.
---
Trees in Westfall? I only recall a few, most being in that Orchard past the Deadmines backdoor.

Check out /u/mark_twen's videos from the last week or so. He's been creating cool simulations with near-impossible context (what if you have every world buff and consumable and BiS) for dps tests. They're not realistic in any way, but it's interesting to show classes capabilities and scaling in Vanilla. [Here's the Fury Warrior one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/avz2dz/buffcapped_vanilla_fury_warrior_dps_test_2k_dps/)

 It does thank you much

How do you think Feral will "get accepted"?

Which guild? I thought Dreamstate had the server first at just over a month after launch.
---
"Sacred Classic" lol
---
pathetic fanboy
---
Paladin, just not a big Allience fan. Also the bubble tactics just seem coward to me.
---
Yeah, he doesn't do that. Also 1 hour video, 1 commercial before, 1 after, non during the video. 
---
Tips out would love this guy. 
---
When Classic comes around i will be rolling a Warlock. I have never played one before and my mains have always been Shaman and Paladin with some Mage sprinkled in. Shaman in Vanilla onwards and Paladin from TBC onwards. 
---
I have always enjoyed having one in my group and i have always admired the class fantasy and toolkit from afar. I am familiar with the basics but i will be going in blind on purpose and figure it out for myself while leveling like i did with my Shaman and Paladin back in the days. 
---
When i get to the endgame i will look for more in depth information to enhance my game, but before that i get to experience Vanilla from a new perspective and i am pretty giddy about it.
---
Really depends on what you want. Orc, gnome, dwarf and UD are the best choices for PvP. My race and gender tier list for rogue is:
---
1. Female Orc
---
2. Female Gnome / Male Dwarf
---
3. Male UD
---
Orc stunresist is too strong against other rogues, paladins and tidal charm, which can save your life against a mage with that item.
---
Gnome's escape artist can free you from druid roots, slows and mage frost nova, which makes duels against mages less of a pain.
---
Dwarf's stoneform removes rogue poison, rogue blind, warrior bleedings for safe restealth and shadow priest devouring plague. 
---
Undead's wotf is in my opinion the weakest racial of these as you can remove fear/seduction with the pvp trinket or skull. However, the more gear you will have, having wotf could mean that you can have an additional trinket slot against priests and warlocks. 
---
The question is, what gives you most trouble and which encounters are more likely? As horde you will face a lot of rogues and Paladins, so orc is always a good pick. On alliance you will face many ud rogues, spriests and warriors, so stoneform will be great. It is basically a free win against any ud rogue. Gnome's escape artist is great as it will allow you to beat those vurtne tryhard frost mages easier. Wotf might be redundant as alliance won't have many locks anyway.
---
Clearly Tirisfall... look Scarlet Monastery, and the notable lake right next to it!
---
Umm I hate to break it to you but warrior DPS was actually very good. They are the most played class on private servers. Sure the code might not match 100% but there is a reason for the amount of warriors. I'll take your shaman comment, even though enhance is very fun.
---
Theres no way if it was an illusion of greatness and popularity do you think a multi million dollar company would even glance at it? Ofc not the numbers are there my friend.
---
Min-maxing is destroying the game and turning it into pure numbers. It's boring as fuck.
---
*Laughs in limited invulnerability potion.*
---
Any idea if Strafe/Backstab will work on classic? if so it is very fast leveling especially with a good mainhand dagger
---
join a guild
---
One interesting thing you noted (which I think is correct from my view) is that Druid’s do get passed up for good gear in raids but that comes with a catch: it depends on what raiding system you use)
---
I got all of my Cenarion:Stormrage very quickly because there were only a few Druid’s and I was often the most senior/hardcore amongst them. However, there aren’t a lot of good rings and trinkets and weapons available for healers and what ones are available tend to go to priests or other casters.
---
I remember I got a lot of heat for spending all my DKP on staff of dominance but at that time I was desperate for a good caster weapon and The only other really great weapon was rod of the ogre magi (no AV, ZG when I did MC). Even being super senior, it took me forever to get my pure elementium band and rejuvenating gem.
---
When classic rolls around, the Druid gearing experience will probably be pretty similar. Get all of your main pieces quickly and slowly work your way towards those off slot pieces. It’s got its pros and cons just like anything.
---
What the hell, can't wait I will create a character today and enjoy the silence of Brill
---
Haha. Thank you. I know it's far fetched, but I hear that song every time those mean boars die.
---
It's definitely possible but it's going to be really rough and likely require a lot more than 10 hours a day.
---
According to Joana's website, the world record for 1-60 is 4 days, 20 hours, 52 minutes of /played and at that point there were only 2 people in their 50s when he hit 60 with most of the pack being mid to late 30s. So unless you're a world record speed-leveler, you're looking at nearly double that 4 days 20 hours rate.
---
If you're really fast and can get it within 5 days /played, at 10 hours a day you're looking at 12 days of hardcore leveling to hit 60. Realistically, especially with all the mob/quest competition we can expect, it's probably going to take longer than 5 days of /played.
---
Also that was done on a Hunter, one of the better leveling classes. It's going to require a lot of planning and coordination if you're going to ensure your tanks and healers can make it to 60 too.
---
Yeah hunters are such amazing gold engines that you can net more money farming mobs at max level and buying all the gathering profession mats than farming them yourself. Pre 60, skinning is definitely worth taking just to get more overall gold value from each mob you kill.
---
Wage slaving is for people that can't solo dungeons.
---
Shadowmoon Valley?
---
http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/7972702
---
it's there too !!! Took me forever, 25 days /played
---
That is wrong, you leave raid healing to the shamans. Chain heal has the best hp/mana when it hits 3 targets. I'll concede about the stop macro but that happened since vanilla. We didn't know about that sort of thing back then. Maybe flash healing is used on the alliance side but the horde do not need it.
---
Over the years I expect to level every class to max in classic wow. Unquestionably the last one I level will be druid. Really don't dig the jack of all trades master of none style at max level, but on the bright side they are fun to level so eventually I'll get around to leveling one.
---
Shaman, since that's my current main on retail since I began playing back in '05.
---
Beef is beef

First thing I thought!

Same, the landmass shape is the same but the water is wrong.
---
Silverpine forrest...easy...nicely done though :)
---
STV, the original battle royale game. 
---
I’d recommend Herb/Alch just because making potions for yourself or selling them to others is extremely cost efficient. As a MT you are constantly getting fucking battered and murdered and your repair costs are through the roof due to wearing plate. If your guild is willing to help you with some of the costs the story may be different, but otherwise you can make your own flasks, resistance potions, etc. Knowing you don’t need to rely on others is invaluable and it will help during the leveling process as well.
---
Warrior
---
Thanks. I might post another one.
---
While they were both big games in their day, neither had the cultural impact that WoW did. I think we are going to see a lot of tourists come to see what all the fuss was about. 
---
I was only 9 Years old...
---
Same. I played undead warlock as first character in vanilla. Was super spooky. Plus it was back when one wrong move could end up killing you. Also I got my void waked there and was so impressed. 
---
FYI, I'm seeing you wrote rogue, but the definitions pasted were for the word "rouge." 
---
I second that. As MT you are most likely an officer, at the very least your standing in the guild is:
---
raid/guild lead &gt; officers &gt; maintank &gt; rest.
---
Therefore chances that you get Lionheart, Titanic Leggings, Stronghold patterns first and make a killing crafting it for fees or crafting it outright and sell them will net very good gold.
---
I don't know why there are even pve servers, the whole idea of two opposing factions is to create friction. 
---
found the clicker
---
I played undead rogue until TBC and their half corpse body and movement style of the rogues are a great match especially in stealth mode. Don't recommend Trolls as (for any troll class) they are not able to wear the foot part of their boots and looks really stupid.
---
Don't train every weapon type that you got or drop it's expensive and usually you ended up with a sword
---
Unless you're 100% sure you want a PvE server, go PvP. 
---
You'll get ganked by higher levels occasionally, but you'll also have fun, closely matched duels, small skirmishes, and gigantic brawls. Almost all my best vanilla memories relate to world PvP that came about organically. Ganks on a server with a normal population are really not that common, and will have barely any effect on your overall leveling speed.

Cool work.  This art style reminds me of the game Don't Starve.  Not exactly the same, but the style is similar.  Cool game if you ever want to try it, super cheap on steam and has multiplayer as well.  Unforgiving, hard to learn, but very fun and engaging.  
---
Yes, because ALL dungeons in Vanilla are Undead, ALL tanks are Paladins and everyone overgears it...right?
---
WRONG !
---
AoE is going to be a viable option long AFTER everyone is lvl 60 and overgears the content. Which is IRRELEVANT.
---
Mirah's Song is a BiS OH sword for rogues up until Maladath(BWL) and Hakkari OH (ZG). Getting further into Sword Rogue Prebis, Mirah's paired with Thrash Blade (Mara quest)/Krol Blade (BoE) /Sword of Zeal (BoE) will allow you to do comparable DPS into BWL and is a very easilly obtainable weapon combo. Dal Rends set (UBRS) is better but can be a huge grind to get both of the set. With all that said though if you can get your hands on a perditions blade, thats the way to go imo (unless youre human)
---
As MT you are probably playing a lot anyways and farming wont be always that good. Selling dungeon runs or reserving gear in strat:live on an offday tuesday morning farming session might not be that good.
---
Leveling a farming alt like mage or hunter can be very good. If you indeed have a farming alt, then there is no reason why this one shouldnt have alchemy  + x profession.
---
I'd go mining + blacksmithing as a guild's maintank
---
I remember the days spending up to 1 hour to fill a group. I'd go back to that over instant LFG bullshit ever again 
---
I would hope not. It’s a private server latency related bug, probably exacerbated by the relatively higher pings to the overseas servers. Not something I’d count on as a strat, especially when leveling as swords works just fine.
---
I'm about 95% sure that my Priest will make it to level ~10 or so, but otherwise just be my Bank/Enchanting alt.  I kinda break them out into tiers of how excited I am to level...
---
* Warrior - Main  
---
* Hunter/Lock/Mage - primary alt  
---
* Shaman/Druid/Rogue - secondary alt  
---
* Priest - bank/enchanting alt
---
Rogue would probably be higher up for me if I hadn't already played one for like 5 years.
---
shaman definetly, better support class and more in demand on horde than priest, way more fun in pvp where u can instagib people.
---
Exploration experience maybe?
---
Apparently frontstabbing didn't work in the demo.
---
Engineering gives you:
---
\- dense dynamite for AoE threat pulls 
---
\- force reactive disk for AoE tanking
---
\- battle chicken for increased TPS
---
\- GOBLIN SAPPER CHARGES for toptier TPS
---
Engineering is just the goto profession for any serious tank.
---
Paladin. I'll likely be Horde for a start, but even if I'm not, they're just so boring to play. If I want to heal I'll go Priest, if I want to tank I'll be Warrior, if I want to DPS I'd be Rogue/Mage/Warrior. Chances are I'll be one of those last 3.
---
Vanilla raiding was basically Onyxia Phase 1, right?
---
Just ignore everything else, because, hell, how else can you keep saying stupid things?
---
True, but wouldn't a guildie (fellow OT, Officer, w/e armorsmith) just be able to pick up those pats and craft them for me? Seems counter-intuitive to drop mining and have to rely on guild/alts as well as AH for all my crafting mats, as opposed to farming some thorium on the side whenever I can and tossing em to som1 with the pats to craft my stuff for me. Especially if said guild/friend were still willing to help out with some of the mats.
---

---
for reference
---
1. I think it's a little cheaper. You also don't need everything if you have a warlock friend who has some of it.
---
2. I believe less intensive, though I don't really have experience with shaman
---
3. Always were, always will be
---
4. It's going to depend on spec and situation, but Rogue and Warrior, particularly if Forsaken
---
5. I never settled on any one particular way. You can kill pretty much anything though
---
6. T2 was the first set I had any interested in
---
7. Sure
---
8. Viable
---
9. Average
---
10. You're right; impossible to tell
---
11. I don't think there is a bad spec for Warlocks, provided you're trying to make it good. They'll be different, and your role/play style will change, but you can be good.
---
12. Trick question, best looking Warlock is a Gnome.
---
I think it's better to go Skinning + LW --&gt; Enchanting to get the Lesser Magic Wand mats because you can run around skinning other people's kills to get the leather. Since there will be a ton of people, most of whom did not run to IF to buy skinning yet, you will get skins really fast.
---
DW fury tank...LMAO !
---
Private server players...
---
Please, for the love of god, use a DW Fury tank on your guild raid progression !
---
I would LOVE to see how it works :))))))))))))))
---
In the end you take the profession that generates the most gold.
---
If you generate more gold by selling crafts than you make by riding circles in Un'goro, then you take the crafting profession and buy your stuff from the AH. 
---
I've written this couple times in other threads: One guy on a pserver made about 15.000gold with titanic leggings the first two days he had the pattern. He got it on the very first Ragnaros ID after patch 1.10. 
---
You can imagine how this blows mining or even herbalism right out of the water.
---
Everything not a Paladin.
---
PVP servers can really suck but add a TOOOOON to the immersion.  PVE you can go semi afk or get to 10% when fighting a mob and not be worried.  But having the threat of PVP really adds to the tension and realism of being out there in the wilderness and having to take care of yourself. 
---
That being said, to each their own.  The threat of ganks can be overblown but can also be very, very real =P  You can always join a leveling guild and try to do quests in pairs.  Being in a pair really reduces the threat of both a gank and also of the mobs you're fighting.  Doesn't really hurt XP much either cuz you're killing a lot easier and can assist each other with complementary class abilities. 
---
Yup. That's the joke. Good job finding it
---
If you're into 'Iranman' mode than PvE would be an option because you don't have to discount unwanted pvp kills.
---
For all the rest: play the real game in PvP.
---
True. N2M Engineering is easily my favorite vanilla profession. I'm also aware that some top guilds are requiring every member of the raid to have a battle chicken equipped for maximum up-time. I guess my real question, then, is Mining OK as a second profession? A lot of ppl are talking about BS/Engi
---
The time lost from ganks, compared to 200+ hours that it takes to level, is going to be insignificant. Private servers are a poor representation because of the super high populations.
---
Open world PvP and faction war is a huge, unique feature of Vanilla. I'd only give that up if you're absolutely 100% sure you'll hate it. 
---
World PvP is what made vanilla the best. Imagine playing a pve server LUL
---
&gt;  So you need to have played vanilla back then to enjoy it now?  
---
No. You need to have played Vanilla back in the day to UNDERSTAND what it means.
---
Yes, MOST people who joined after WOTLK will quite before lvl 30-ish. And MOST means actually MOST, not all, as you think.
---
Nobody is talking about enjoyment here. It's about mentality, game mentality, to be on point.
---
Vanilla requires a VERY different game mentality, and most WOTLK (and after) players will rather QUIT Classic and go back to retail, instead CHANGING their game mentality.
---
Some will change, but most will choose the easy way out : Quit Classic and ofc, spam the forums with "Classic sux".
---
Sample size was about 5 mins of continuous pulls. Downtime was the same for hemo/combat, you're not taking into account Ghostly Strike's +15% dodge or any of the other sub talents you couldn't get in combat. Feel free to test it yourself in whatever situation you want.
---
By blue gear I'm referring to typical rares for a lvl60 - I tested Shadowcraft with 2/4/6/8 set bonus.
---
What faction and race are you going with? I am also going to roll a warrior tank.  You really have to be set in stone though. A lot of people will get burned out or turned off their warrior.
---
When /r/wonderdraft  and /r/classicwow collide...
---
My humble opinion....   PvE has been programmed to be defeated at some point.  PvP is a never ending possibility.   
---
This is something I very seldom had issues with back in actual vanilla. Now a days on private servers it is very common because of huge server populations but more so just cause it seems like these kind of people just dont give a fuck about their rep on these temporary private servers. I had someone get mad at me for mining my node I cleared the enemies too and finished before they could come try to steal it too. Like really? fuck off this my node.
---
Paladin. 1 because alliance. 2 because I don't enjoy healing.
---
Druid probably possibly Paladin. This just depends on if i ever play Alliance. If I do i will only be doing it to level a pally.
---
Planning on going orc rogue with a friend. We’ve always played allies and know the usual hangouts so there’s plenty of opportunity for decent ganking. 
---
 Being a parent now, it’s doubtful I’ll get much time to raid but maybe one day we’ll get through MC...
---
I wouldn't bother with blacksmithing. It's really expensive to level, and the benefits of being the crafter are negligible. You're going to need all the cash you can get for arcanite and consumables.
---
F Tauren \^.&lt;
---
Perfect, thanks for your awesome response and time. so I won’t ever be wearing T2 outside of PvP? That’s unfortunate because I really love the way it looks. 
---
Anyway, much appreciated! 
---
You dont even have to have the chicken equipped. Equip it, wait 30seconds, spawn it, equip your proper trinket and engage in the fight. The chicken remains intact even if you dont have the chicken as a trinket equipped.
---
I'm one of the people advocating for BS/Engi further down. :D
---
But if you truly are MT, then you should consider a farming alt anyways and hunters/mages are much better CCers if you want to mine with them. Two people fighting over that black lotus? Sheep and grab it. 
---
I played Warrior as Main in Vanilla and I got never understood back th en why people always wanted to have me in Grps. Back then I really didn't get the concept of Tanking. I always used the highest level blue weapon I found, sometimes even Sword+Shield /facepalm.
---
But Tanking at Lowlevels or in bad Gear is incredibly annoying, because you are rage-starved as fuck!
---
It’s the twisting nether 100%
---
Warlock
---
Actually useless shit class that none will miss.
---
Ok, I was first debatting between Warlock and Hunter, but Warlock is of the table now and Druid joined the table.
---
So would you pick a Hunter of Druid to play in Classic, and why? Just wanna hear some opinions. Thanks!
---
Druid for sure. They are underwhelming in every aspect. Crap dps, sub-par tank, average heal, no rez. They have nice looking sets, though. Unfortunately I don't play for aesthetics.
---
wow i really like it please make more!
---
No, they just don't want to tank. They just simply REFUSE to do it. Why? Because they want to do damage. It's how they think and they think its much more fun than tanking.
---
It's not about the class, it's about the player.
---
A player that LIKES to tank, will ALWAYS be a tank.
---
A player that LIKES to do damage, will ALWAYS be a damage dealer.
---
BOTH refuse to do the other's job.
---
It is how it was, it is, and always will be.
---
This is why the BEST tanks in game are the one who ALWAYS tank, an refuse to play as damage dealers.
---
Rogue and druid. Just zero interest in the playstyle.  Likely will never level a warlock either but the for sure ones are rogue and druid
---
I leveled both, a Warlock as my first toon in vanilla, and a hunter in pserver. They play really similar. You should absolutely choose the fantasy you prefer. I had a female human warlock, and I loved this idea of appearing to be a mage when walking in Stormwind, only for it to be revealed that I was dabbing in dark magic and not an innocent little woman. I also played a dwarf male hunter, and I also loved the fantasy. i would make it a point to only level in outdoorsy areas and never go to town until my bags were completely bursting, and I would set up fires, fish, hunt, skin my enemies and collect herbs.
---
It's all about the fantasy.
---
I like how you closed the parenthesis with a smiley face. A common man such as myself would have done something like: (Fortunately :) )
---
Lmfao I agree with your response to 12, sadly I have an undying loyalty to the horde. But thanks for taking your time to answer the questions, much appreciated! 
---
I agree in fact i think it will be such a success that i hope it opens their eyes to making a new hard core MMO. If they did a Starcraft Universe just as they did with warcraft and it was heavily Classic inspired, they would be back on top. Lets hope this kick stats a revival for the MMO genre!
---
I was also trying to pick between Hunter and Warlock, but I find Hunter more fun. The Hunter pet system is more fun and also not having to deal with farming all those soul shards is also a plus. You only have to take care of arrows, which is not a big deal at all. 
---
Engineering mandatory. Optionally you can use a gold gathering profession like herb or mining. But like you said you probably wanna use an alt anyway.
---
I would say BS is BIS then. As a MT you are a trusted person in your guild, probably even the GM, and using having blacksmithing recipes from thorium brotherhood is probably a good use of that trust. 
---

---
The little lake gave it away for me before I noticed SM :P
---
I've found swipe to be a waste of rage and not as effective for holding aggro.  Target tab through each mob, maul, move on to the next one.  Use feral fairie fire on cooldown as it is rage-free aggro generation (very little, but still).  If I have a ton of extra rage I will use swipe to dump it, but that doesn't happen very often imo.  
---
This is more work that just staying on the skull and spamming swipe, but I'm pretty sure it is the best way to hold aggro on multiple mobs.  Even when dps unload on the 2nd or 3rd mob a bit early I rarely lose aggro.
---
I've seen 4.5k dps for a mage in PS logs for Ouro. So I expect 5k+ is possible
---
Baby I got Blessing of Protection! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Except that is NOT tanking mate.
---
UBRS runs in BWL/ZG gear is like participating to a marathon driving a Ferarri.
---
The only NPC I remember in Azshara pertaining to level 60 is that water elemental dude who chills on a tiny island off the northeastern coast. He gives Molten Core quests.
---
I see. That makes a lot of sense. I'll definitely have to give BS/Engi a strong consideration, and most likely will go down that route. Thanks, I appreciate the help and replies!
---
It's 100% Priest for me 🤮.
---
since it was changed IN vanilla expect to see the 1.12 version. But of course blizzard is a closed book and we really know nothing as of yet.
---
Priest is the only class I never leveled to max in my time during Vanilla - WotLK.  I expect I will never level one in Classic, either.
---
I can answer you that, since I prefer a DPS Warrior in my 5 men groups.
---
He wears plates, he can tank for quite a while (if I am dead, or incapacitated, or he needs to save the healer and I am slowed, or stunned, etc), he can KITE tank, he can basically become, instantly, an off-tank, if needed.
---
I love those battles where shit escalates and everyone has a good brawl
---
I also love when, in PVP server, I'd be at 10% health struggling with a mob and enemy faction comes *and actually helps me to kill the mob*.
---
That shit was like.... the definition of grateful. I'd /thank and /bow and you'd feel like your god damn heart was touched, lol.
---
These interactions are to me, the biggest part of the game. I couldn't go PVE and miss out on this stuff. 
---
To me, PVE is basically one giant team leveling through wow, but PvP is actually two factions warring in the world
---
AT LEAST !
---
That was probably it. Thanks!
---
I guess not as essential as getting the onyxia attunement started but still not a bad idea to pick up before MC.
---
Warlock. I have had zero interest in the class at any point in all of WoW’s lifespan. Not sure why in particular. 
---
A very close second to last is rogue. Probably a tie here really.
---
For those of you wondering how OP made this, he used a mapping site called Inkarnate which is commonly used for d&amp;d. If you want other examples of how versatile this site is, check one of the many d&amp;d subreddits. I also have one in my post history.
---
What is a Druid tank?
---
Ah, that thing on private servers built on TBC data?
---
Got it !
---
This will be the first time since I started playing wow in 06 that I wont be a prot warrior because of the dps. I just dont want to deal with the headache this time around. I may regret it at lvl 60 while waiting for dungeon groups.
---
As a warlock I still can't figure out the best way to dps Broodlord.  No matter how I throttle my dps/aggro, I always seem to overtake the tank near the end.  I've even gone so far as to wand the first 40% health.  Of course, maybe the issue is not my dps but something the tank is doing...
---
Disclaimer - this was a couple years ago on a pserver.  I am leveling a couple toons on a diff server atm, but haven't played in 2 years.
---
How much of fury warrior DPS is just execute?
---
Or corpse camped.
---
I'm pretty sure this meme wasn't made with classic WoW in mind.
---
I'm always confused how they know it is a good group unless they are guildies or RL friends (which they usually are not).  And also, if your "good group" invites a "bad tank" you now have a "bad group".  I know people are just trying to sell it, but I think its funny :)
---
Week 2 is not feasible with 10 hours/day. That's 140 hours, barely enough time to get to 60 if you're an experienced and skilled leveler.
---
This is Brill. Thanks, I’m here all night. 
---
And that was on Nost.
---
Comes Classic, Paladins (and Druids) will suddenly realize WHY they weren't tanks in Vanilla.
---
Eh, it's The Emerald Dream obviously 
---
I love that it doesnt scale with gear
---
so u can get a fat crit even outgeared
---
this is one of the douchiest posts i have read all week lmao 
---
NanoPOMPYRO Machines son 
---
Agree 100%.  This has worked so many times.  And like you said, if you ask everyone and they say no, you can stop spamming uselessly and go do something else.
---
Warrior, Mage and Rogue in a tie. There's going to be so many running around that I just won't find it appealing.
---
Yep same here, nice job to the OP for making it ambiguous but obvious once you know the answer.
---
I believe in you!!
---
Tirisfal brother
---
It seems... efficient? :)
---
I didn't downvote you but your argument doesn't hold up. You can set "artificial" goals also in single player games, but those can be provably beaten by beating all the content.
---
You beat the game when you finish the storyline or if you finish 100 % of the content. If you choose to re-play it with another class, another approach, another weapons or another challenges, it's up to you. 
---
AHH
---
maybe that is what I am remembering?
---
I can't wait to play this game again 
---
Majority of them will be feral, and expect to only dps, and have no healing gear. Wait until they find out what they're doing in raids lol.
---
Warrior.
---
I actually expect FAR more non-pserver bulids in Classic.  The pserver community will be spread out and diluted.  You will have so many guilds with feral tanks in raids that your head will spin.  And you know what? I bet they are going to do just fine.
---
Warrior 
---
I don’t hate myself that much 
---
You sound angry, need a friend bud?
---
The world record is 115 hours to 60, 10hrsx10 days = 100 hours, not nearly enough. That's on a hunter as well, following a well researched, practiced, very tight path to 60. 
---
For an entire guild to hit 60 (and farm gear, quests for clearing MC) in 2 weeks they'd need to be playing realistically 15+ hours a day. 
---
That's funny because I'm a mage and my last choice would be druid.  They're enormously complex and require a ton of work just to be below average at every role.
---
Why is it that anyone who advocates for PVE servers also includes language insinuating PVP activity is "childish"
---
Ironically, the stronger argument exists to say PVE is childish - you choose a game world with no risks and nothing scary because you can't handle the true world with freedom of actions and consequences.
---
At the end of the day, PVP presents a much greater range of experiences in the world both with your faction and the enemy. It adds an immersion and excitement that is hard to rival anywhere. PVE to many of us feels like levelling alone in an empty world without threat. 
---
At the end of the day, play what makes you happy. But to insinuate you are *better* than PVPer players because that stuff is "childish" just makes you sound like someone who can't emotionally deal with losing fights.
---
Contrary to the responses you are getting, Vanilla was a 50/50 split between PvE and PvP.
---
If your goal in the game is accomplishing goals, PvE. If your objective is killing Nefarion, then seeing your MT get killed with world buffs on him, on the way to BRM is a pointless distraction. You can still get your PvP fix in battlegrounds.
---
If your goal in the game is to play around in the game world, then consider PvP.
---
Missing the lake in the upper left corner area
---
Can we got a classicwow art thread?
---
I'm thinking about buying the pro version. Would you say it's worth it?
---
Ayyy you’re using Inkarnate! I love that site. 
---
great drawing
---
Greater tax? Lol. 
---
31/5/15 is a staple for both PvP and PvE dungeon running. So there is a spec. And worse of all, there is way lower stat issues than anyone else unless you tank raids. Even when tanking you'll be using some pure dps gear for threat.  Try on a proper hybrid to do something else. Heal as a druid in pure feral gear to point one of the worse. 
---
Versatility comes from gear. Furies can do so as well PVE-wise as offtanks. 
---
31/20/0 hybrid builds are quite rare. 
---
Priests (holy) mostly go for a 30 holy/21 disc aside the post-zg shadow weaver (which may be a 31 disc/20 shadow), PvP-wise there is the full shadow 20/0/31, but poor healing.  Tri specs also exist.
---
Shamans are either full on resto (40+ points on resto, getting the %mana in enh) or "ele" spec 30/0/21.  Only enh gets 31/20 but it's usually quite a meme.
---
Druids are usually  0/30/21 or 1/29/21 (HotW, real hybrid spec), 14/32/5 (deep feral),  24/0/27 (moonglow healer, hybrid-ish), 7/0/44 (regrowth healer) and some healing+feral charge PvP variants, close to the priests' tri specs.  
---
Pallies' only 31/20 is actually the pure holy.  Prots usually go for 11/31/9, PvP reckoning (either going sub holy or ret) doesn't get 31 point talents either. Deep rets may do so, tho, but are quite scarce. 
---
Rogue.
---
that's funny i found my character too, and he's first seen feb 19th 2005, exactly same date as yours. 
---
http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/3374861
---
Felwood does the same to me. You feel like you're almost there once you hit that area!
---
thats the difference between a good lock and a bad one
---
you can tell instantly when they are ganked, if they pop sacrifice, you have a challenge on your hands
---
I fucking loved those brawls with Locks. 
---
I admit more than one occasion I won the duel only to sit and drink, have the lock pop SS and blow me up before I could react.
---
Thats kind of how I see it. It's a meme that is meant to keep the game as "honest" as possible or is reasonable.
---
You only need to walk to each city once.
---
Where's the /played to 60 ?
---
30 is pretty generous. Early 20s there's going to be a massive drop off.
---
The resemblance is uncanny.   Pyrce's eyebrows are super crazy, bushy though.
---
By filling whatever role the raid needs to clear the raid as quickly as possible. Tank, DPS, sometimes heal/decurse (although in BWL the heal/decurse role isn't necessary on any of the bosses). And by reliably casting Battle Rez, Innervate and Tranquility when an opportunity arises.
---
In BWL specifically: Feral Druids should be the first tank on Vael. If he's able to top the DPS meters as a cat, then I guarantee he would put out more threat than every other tank in his guild. More threat would be a much bigger DPS increase to his raid than doing damage in cat form on a fight like Vael. 
---
Thing is, he would die and lose his world buffs if he tanked Vael, which means he couldn't show his streamers that he's "topping meters" for the rest of the raid. The things that are good for his guild and good for his raid are not good for his stream audience.
---
I start with deep Feral and when I start raiding I would change to HOTW hybrid build. You should be able to heal and still tank 5-man-Dungeons.
---
And then it's really up to you. Maybe you jump into Off-tank mode, if you really want to push your limits you could play cat. I personally pref to go Resto/Balance build after that.
---
Druid has a lot of interesting Builds, you can play around as the game progresses.
---
Thunderfury given to a rogue. Disguisting.
---
100% agree
---
I also played since 2004 and on packed pservers
---
PVP is truly not that bad. If you follow the red=dead mentality, you just make yourself the asshole to the entire faction and people will come after you once they spawn.
---
Lots of times, I would be low or accidentally pull an extra mob, and the ENEMY helped me out when they could've easily killed me.
---
Fun stuff like that just isn't the same on pve
---
If the pope just let himself go for a couple of months
---
I want to see the entire world map like this.
---
The joke is also the spelling as it was common early on to see it misspellled and it gained meme status.
---
Oddly, it's probably mage. I've been a lifelong mage and want to go in a new direction, so its highly unlikely I'll even level one as an alt.
---
if your goal is to get to 60 ASAP without a care for pvp, then obviously its optimal to go pve so you dont have to worry about ganking
---
but that goal makes you the minority
---
most people love the social aspect of it. the open world risks. the leveling experience. the brief skirmishes with the other faction
---
THOSE are the true memories people have of vanilla.
---
not the fact that they got to 60 with 1 less day /played because they went pve instead of pvp
---
So I spec my talent points for bear, just FYI as that makes a difference also obviously.
---
Bear form moves slower - Only if you take the talent for cat speed boost, which I do not.  Cats get a 5min cooldown dash, but bears get Feral charge, which saves time as a gap closer.  I'd call this one a push if you don't take the talent.
---
Therefore taking way more damage - You left out that bears have more armor so they take less damage along the way.  The whole tortoise hare analogy has more to do with popping out of bear/cat form to heal.  
---
I envision a cat doing more damage, taking more damage, having to pop out of cat form to heal more often, and maybe even having to eat and drink.  I envision a bear doing less damage, taking less damage, but having to shapeshift and heal less often.  Tortoise and the hare, I think the analogy holds.  Now the cat may very well have a faster leveling experience, I never said they didn't.  
---
They really focus down the challenge on a few individuals and the problem is that in a 40-man environment it's not always a guarantee that everyone is completely alert and attentive. Many bosses throw bombs on one person who then has to react. Bosses like Razorgore, Skeram, Sartura, Bug trio (for Alliance without totem of poison cleansing), 4 Horsemen which I believe is the hardest progression boss in the game, are complex for pretty much the whole raid. 
---
Depends on price of ore and how much gold you will be able to farm on a hunter.
---
I'd only bother with skinning at first especially if DM is blizzlike and in the game at release. Then at 60 get enchanting, des items from DM, with the gold level engineering, get epic mount, craft engi trinkets, pile consumables for raid and pvp. If you can farm a lot of gold, at some point I'd probably drop enchanting and take blacksmithing for the anti-fear trinket, it's quite good for hunter pvp. 
---
its also exciting to see the zone react
---
people start to form packs in the area, watching for you
---
you may find a friendly stealthed ganker, leading to some 2v2s or 2v3s

Now I am wondering if the Pope watches GoT, does the Pope even watch TV? Does the Pope even own a TV? Is the Palace that the Pope lives in owned by the Pope himself or is he just treated as a temporary resident until his departure of this earth. Is the Pope allowed to do whatever he wants in his own "home" and if not then surely this would be blasphemy as the Pope is the head of the Catholic Church and all that he wills is the sovereign decree of God himself and we shall not disrepescent our lord and saviour.

Warrior. Shit while leveling, shit solo pvp, shit if you want to join a good guild as a dps and shit at 60 if you don't have full epics. And the fact that it's the most played class in the game makes it even worse. 
---
&gt; then doesn't it then follow that (at the very least when it comes to  dps) a competent player on a meme spec can be more valuable than an  incompetent player playing an optimal one? 
---
nope, because 1 button caster rotations don't allow for skillfull anything tbh.  
---
Is the content doable ? Pretty sure MC, Ony, ZG and maybe AQ20 are doable that way. BWL maybe as well, depending on how many memespecs are present. AQ40 and naxx ? I don't see it coming.  
---
Classic is so simple, it comes down to a numbers game.
---
Love point 3 as a healer 
---
Okay, if you really want to min-max then go for LW/Skinning while leveling, get the 2p devil set along with some cured leather on the side and then drop them both for Engineering and Herb at 60. You can pick mining instead of herb if you want, it's all about making the most money and herb is according to me the most profitable out of those two because you can run Mara gold runs by yourself 24/7.
---
The engineering benefits are: Goblin jumper trinkets, reflector trinkets and of course you can craft your own bullets and/or arrows. So yes, you need to have engineering on your main.
---
Can we get a 40 druid raid going? Sign me up for that.
---
15. We had huge problems with Raz so maybe it's just personal bias. We went full spider wing, Noth, Heigan, full construct wing and only then did we actually kill Raz. 
---
Then the guild died... 
---
well said
---
pvp you learn to conserve your cooldowns, take mobs at a reasonable pace... always have eyes on the back of your head for getting ganked
---
it really changes the feel of contested zones like stv, if you just remove the pvp aspect
---
being a diligent player conserving CDs, and the fact that i got mail at 40 immediately on my hunter, meant that I didn't die to a single gank in STV my last pserver playthrough
---
that shit is so exhilarating, getting jumped by rogues and succeeding in killing them, because you pay attention and conserve good CDs and are ready to react
---
Ea bad 
---
Ahah thanks for this. 
---
Casters in general. Bleh 
---
\&gt;:( No one misses us until it's time for summons.
---
Apparently I started March 17th 2006, which sounds about right.
---
I was 60 by the time it next saw me on June 9th 2006.
---
So a maximum of 84 days.
---
Paladin, I would rather be locked in a room with a honey badger then play on Alliance. 
---
I love everything about druid except their healing. All their heals either take too long to cast or are super inefficient. Unfortunately, at end game, you are expected to heal which is the least fun thing about them.
---
I was 20 when I started playing and some of the most fun I've had was carrying dungeon groups for levelers with my prot warrior, there was a pair of teens who were brothers and always afraid too ask for help because they didn't want people too blame there age. My wife and I helped gear them in pre raid BIS in bc and they were both very active raiders and rather competent.
---
Fast forward too wrath and my wife and i were raiding with a guild ran by 3 brothers over the age 40 and it was nothing but drama started by them. Guild fell apart before we even cleared ulduar. Was the most stressful guild I've ever been part of.
---
I love this idea, I'd be dead keen to join, I've also got a lot of officer experience from raiding through vanilla so could offer some advice. What region are you?
---
I can see there being a couple of fights that might be particularly challenging, Vael for example requires enormous DPS output, but that would be part of the fun I suppose.
---
Warrior and Mage will be high pop but rogues aren't normally overpopulated. At least on private servers anyway.
---
+1
---
It's a pine, you can tell by the way that it is.
---
Rogue. Too much competition in PvE, and not my preferred playstyle in premade BGs. I can not imagine a more miserable experience than guarding the flag room for months while ranking.
---
Where’s this at already 
---
I agree. Regrettably, one of the pserver guilds I was in did this since it was an 'open DK' system. It was trash, me and my rogues were furious.
---
Paladin as I will be horde side :p
---
For all the others nothing is decided, I change my mind every other day! I cant wait for summer!
---
This is an aspen, you can tell that it's an aspen tree because of the way it is. Wow.
---
You have a spell where you clap your massive nuts and it generates lightning. 
---
I think Vael would be a real challenge - DPS output is pretty important in that fight. 
---
I am not trying to be disrespectful to the people that enjoy them but for me. I think pve servers are so bad. I wouldn't even play wow if pve servers were the only option. I would literally freak out if I had an ally near me I couldn't attack.
---
That being said I really like world pvp and while I am not a "ganker" per se. I do kill 100% of the allies in my sight regardless of level or fairness. I will charge 1 ally 10 levels below me and try to kill him. I will also charge an ally 10 levels above me and try to kill him. So thats who I am lol.
---
Holy whoosh batman
---
Doubtful. Devs for other games have indicated that the friends list cap is decided by the Bnet team, not any individual game's team. So if they do increase it past 200, it won't be related to the Classic release. 
---
This looks so cool
---
Had it not been for the monastery, I think it would have taken me longer to realize.
---
Cool map, fun game. 
---
Flag room? I guess you didn't rank in a premade with a hunter?
---
100%. I use it all the time in my d&amp;d campaigns, it also adds a ton of new textures, buildings, and world assets. Its definitely worth the like $25 a year or whatever it is
---
Honestly, you'll find plenty of people in the same boat - you'll also find lots of people who will power to 60 and then join like minded people. 
---
Priest, probably.
---
On a side note at his wake he was sent flowers from people he played with in WoW, both old and new. It goes to show how amazing the community was as he never met these people before. It was so touching. 
---
I think he's referring to himself as (formly) being a child, and therefore naive, rather than saying that PVP is childish.
---
Yeah, the poll should be like this instead: https://www.strawpoll.me/17570110
---
I think your secondary profession should be Alchemy.  Just have an alt for making money.
---
The last part is finally done. Hope you enjoy.
---
To be fair most of the clans are just so dumb and gullible. Only the best shamans could see through the bullshit feel manipulation. They're also bred from aggressive Giants so it makes sense. 
---
   
---
Strange to me how green skins can be shamans lol. Oh well 25% stun reduction here I go!
---
short 1.12.1 warlock guide by Seuche
---
MAGE:
---
Use :doggo: Felhunter and position yourself slightly away from it so he can't nade both you and your pet. Precast Shadow Ward if he has shadow reflector, in case he reflects something on you. Open with petattack, :corr: corruption, siphon life, amplify curse :coa: curse of agony, :immo: immolate. Remember to dispel frost nova and ignite from yourself with :doggo: felhunter. Spellstone is good here to remove those 2. Cast searing pain if you have all dots up, only cast drain life if he doesn't have counterspell up. Only use death coil when he doesn't have ice barrier up so you get the full healing from the coil and preferably when he's close range/in a gcd so he can't ice block it. Wait with casting shadow bolt if you get a shadow trance proc, he might be panicmashing his ice block/shadow reflector keys if he hears the sound/is using SpellAlert addon. Spam Shadowburn whenever it's off cd if you feel like wasting shards. If he's spamcasting spells like scorch, fireball, frostbolt use curse of tongues. If he's spamming aoe spells, nova, CoC, blast wave, arcane explosion use curse of agony. If you are soul link spec this duel is 100 times easier. Corruption, CoA, immolate and searing pain. Drain life if he silences searing pain. You should be able to win by just doing that and dispelling nova/ignite with your pet.
---
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
---
WARLOCK:
---
The most APM duel. Precast Shadow Ward. Use Felhunter and use detect invis, underwater breathing for trash buffs incase he feels lucky to dispel something on you with his :doggo: felhunter. Start with petattack, siphon life(rank 1), Corruption, Amplify Curse curse of agony, immolate, Siphon Life (full rank). The reason for rank 1 siphon life is because he will probably dispel the first dot on him with felhunter and you want to keep corruption on him as much as possible for shadow trance procs. Spam dispel yourself whenever it's off cd to remove his dots. Reapply any dots he dispels with his felhunter. If he silences your immolate with his felhunter you can banish his felhunter. At this point he will want to interrupt your cast somehow, either with coil, nade, tidal or such so be ready for that. You can also start the duel by prepopping shadow reflector and banishing his felhunter, but that's pretty cheesy. :P
---
Keep an eye out for his shadow trance procs and be ready to pop shadow reflector if you hear the sound/use SpellAlert. Try to save spell lock for his shadow school, if you outgear him you should probably be able to survive his immolate/searing pain spam. (Or he might instantly start channeling drain life after dots and you spell lock it and it's pretty much gg from there)
---
Something cool you can do here is to try and catch coil with Shadow Ward, this will prevent him from healing with the coil.
---
If he's destruction you probably want to use curse of tongues, I prefer amplify curse curse of agony though as I'm usually pretty confident that I can do more dmg than the other lock.
---
Spellstone is good here, save it for when you have corruption, siphon life and immolate all on yourself. Spam shadow ward whenever it's off cd.
---
Use curse of recklessness on him if he pops shadow reflector to make you immune to fears.
---
WARRIOR: :succ:  Succubus or :boi: Voidwalker.
---
:succ: Sucubus: Seduce, curse of shadow, go maxrange, soulfire searing pain shadowburn, seduce, shadowbolt searingpain, seduce, shadowbolt searingpain shadowburn, corruption, amplify curse of agony, siphon life. (he should be dead)
---
:boi: Voidwalker: Let him charge you (unless you want to be cheesy kunt), Corruption, amplify curse of agony, siphon life, drain life. Cast immolate when he pummels your drain life. (you can also try and fake his pummel with rank 1 drain life) Coil when you are going low on health, sacrifice when you are going low on health. (you should wait as long as possible to sacrifice your pet as you lose out on the voidwalker melee dmg)
---
PALADIN
---
:doggo: Felhunter. Curse of shadow, fear. Then just spam shadow bolt and fear when he comes close and keep rank 1 corruption up on him for shadow trance procs and to waste his mana on dispelling himself. Keep pet dispel for his hammer of justice. Run away and bandage if he bubbles and starts healing. Keep your pet attacking him unless he's reckoning spec and spamming /sit. Dots are a waste of mana here unless he's bad and not dispelling or if he's oom. Use coil when he's immune to fear and in melee range. And only use coil if you can get the full healing from it. It's bad to use coil when you're full health unless you're bursting someone with it.
---
DRUID:
---
:doggo: Felhunter. Enable autodevour if he's specced in nature's swiftness, you should be able to survive moonfire/insect swarm. Just get full dots and drain life him. Remember to life tap before drain life so you don't waste the healing you recieve from it.
---
ROGUE: Your hardest counter. 
---
Use :succ: succ or :boi: voidwalker. Only gonna explain :succ: succ as :boi: voidwalker is very similar to warrior.
---
:succ: Succ: Keep your succ away from you so he can't easily CC it. Spam seduce when he opens. Reseduce if he trinkets. Nade him if he breaks it with wotf and reseduce. Then make some distance. Immolate, corruption, curse of agony, siphon life and run. Coil if he comes close, but be wary of vanish. Try and sync your coil with a dot so the dot breaks his vanish before he can vanish ur coil. Speed items are very good here, gnomish rocket boots, nifty stopwatch and skull. use curse of exhaustion if you're running with rocket boots/skull. This will make you outrun sprint. Antivenoms are supergood here to remove crippling.
---
SHAMAN:
---
Put on :doggo: autodevour for his grounding/nature swiftness unless he's enhancement and you need to dispel his frost shock.
---
Enhancement: curse of exhaustion and kite with dots, dispel frost shock on yourself.
---
Elemental: Curse of tongues, corr, siphon life, immolate. Cast searing pain, if he shocks it use drain life. Spell lock his 1st cast. Kill totems with pet. Cast fear after he earth shocks.
---
Hunters are great, we just didn't have one that was reliable.
---
Anytime!
---
Yea, man, I'm looking forward to joining MC PUG raids and just getting exalted with the Waterdudes over time.
---
Warlock, I just cant stand their lack of mobility and slowing/root. I always feel like I'm bolted to the ground if I want to do something other than spam DoTs. 
---
Priest is similar, but as a healer, it has a different feel, I dont feel a need to be aggressive so I feel little compulsion to advance and when healing I feel as though I am playing defensively, so I feel little incentive to move anyway.
---
&gt; you can tell instantly when they are ganked, if they pop sacrifice, you have a challenge on your hands
---
you should wait as long as possible to sacrifice your pet as you lose out on the voidwalker melee dmg
---
Hey that's my dad!
---
All of these sarcastic points gave me a good laugh, and made me remember why I don't play retail.
---
Def Tirisfall 
---
Thats because people who are obsessed with claiming they love world pvp roll on our servers. Then you see them drop the laundry list of tears about world pvp and, you just think to yourself. This whole list of tears is just them asking for consent to pvp. If thats what they wanted why play on a pvp server? Why claim you like pvp server?
---
The first data point on my character sheet is Aug 12th 2005, had already been 60 for like 6 months.
---
If you are thinking that far ahead, grind your last level or two in NW Silithus.  The elementals there give Hydraxian Warlord faction that you need to start/progress that quest chain.  You can get that faction on your first MC run, but then you are one MC run behind compared to every other player that grinded a bit of faction in Silithus.  If you are really that jazzed about it :)
---
Tirisfall Glades. Do more of these! This is super neat
---
Paladin. I'm rolling Horde first, but Paladin has always been my least favourite class.
---
Yea that’s the name of the game. I wish warriors had a good aoe taunt other than chall shout but I think it would be too easy at that point
---
Roll on the opposite faction you plan to play.  Totally different quests initially.  Maybe you can still scratch your itch but not ruin you classic experience.
---
Ah, Gnome scalps. How I miss them. 
---
I played Alliance in Vanilla until I was hanging out at a buddy's house one night. He was in AV, looted a Gnome he was just killed and I was like, wait - you can scalp those little bastards? Had a level 60 Orc Warlock about 3 weeks later.
---
Definitely give Shaman a try. They have plenty of fun tools for pretty much every occasion and you can seemlesly switch between roles. You will be leveling primarilly as enchance with a dagger + shield or 2h BUT its super convenient to be able to pull mobs with your spells, use shocks on fleeing targets / mixing up your dps, and dropping appropriate totems to either buff you or slow the enemies down. You also offer a ton of versatility in early dungeons being able to heal regardless of your spec. 
---
One of the most popular specs is a Ele / Resto hybrid that functions well in both pvp and pve so you won't have to respec a lot. 
---
Seems like Shaman would allow you to try Horde, play a class that can fill any role (besides tank), and experience a side of the game you haven't played yet. 
---
You should this looks great
---
Same.
---
These things will almost certainly exist before you actually hit 60, even if Blizz gives no info on API beforehand
---
They really just need to notify people of the API changes 
---
Quest Helper was essential for me, which put an arrow on the screen to your current quest's objective. Also Atlas Loot so I could link Thunderfury without actually having it. 
---
It drops often enough that most (mdps) raiders will be able to get it during their pre-raid gearing process, so I don't really agree with the sentiment.
---
On the other hand, it's completely true that there will ALWAYS be people looking for lava runs for HoJ. As a raid-geared player you can make a lot of money off those people :)
---
-
---
An anecdote from when I played on Nostalrius: 
---
Once the tanks in our guild discovered how insanely good Ironfoe was, everyone wanted one. Since many of us were decked in MC/BWL gear, we were able to 3-man it (2-man was doable but we failed too often for it to be efficient). What we did was:
---
Get a tank from the guild who reserves Ironfoe (tanking as 2h arms)
---
Get a healer from the guild who looted ALL the trash (making it worth our while)
---
Get a random rogue from world chat who got HoJ when it dropped, in exchange for 60g (which the tank and healer split 30/30)
---
This was a pretty good system since everyone got what they wanted, and knew exactly what to expect. Tank got his extreme weapon, healer got around 50g/hour from the trash, and the random rogue got a good chance at HoJ without having to play with undergeared people and roll against them. 
---
Damn ninja cutting onions.
---
I think it's a compelling point that taking the absolute min/max approach to a game that's 15 years old is boring. Where's the challenge in that?
---
Did you guys do 40 man dungeon runs up until your first MC?  That seems really efficient.
---
I scoffed and said Westfall as well very deceptive drawing.
---
Doesnt have pre-60 data on name changed chars it seems 
---
Wonderdraft is an excellent alternative. It's more up front but isn't subscription based and allows you to use tons of custom icons &amp; themes. See examples on r/wonderdraft
---
Main points are: rank1 nova for rogues, silence, and Mana burn/meditation. Should have like 2-3 points to play with after that
---
MadSeason is great and actually played real vanilla unlike most of these YouTubers.
---
Hunter? 
---
My best memories growing up were watching my (older) brother play all the video games over his shoulder.  I never really felt like I was missing out on any of the experience.
---
I feel that all the three trees have a lot of synergy and things that you might benefit no matter what you go, sadly i feel that it would be bad to try make some build with points in every tree. 
---
Optimal situation i guess would be being able to switch roles as needed, since druid is "jack of all trades, but master of none"
---
still better than master of one
---
Hmmm, so my plan of going raiding in the 2nd year is a bit on the slow side then.
---
Mind control
---
Yeah for sure. A lot of the things I listed can be viewed as bonuses for people helping their guildies ("I guess I'll help, I need some skins anyways"). 
---
Yeah that's true, gonna be interesting to see what system they go with and whether or not they change it throughout the game. 
---
Still a step up from DPSing. You have to mark targets, pull correctly, and pick off any stragglers if tanking multiple enemies. Nothing in WoW is particularly hard but Tanking still has the most interaction imo
---
Easier groups for me
---
Please make more! So cool
---
Both of those are great leveling classes, so I'd say it mostly depends on what you want to do at 60.
---
* PvP?  Both strong choices.  
---
* Casual PvE?  Druid is maybe the better call here, as you'd have more versatility in what role to fill in 5 mans or pug raids.  
---
* Serious PvE?  Druid if you want to heal, Hunter if you want to DPS.
---
For me personally, I don't plan on seriously raiding.  Just casual PvP and dungeons and gold farming for me.  So between those two, Druid seems like it would stay fresh for longer at level 60, given the multiple roles you could fill.
---
Thank you! That sounds great, i think i will i do just that.
---
Yes but that isn't reflected in droprates. You might bring 8 mages and only 1-2 druids, but Cenarion equipment has the same droprates as Arcanist, so those two druids will gear up significantly faster than any mage.
---
S tier looks correct
---
Player limit is 5 for dungeons.
---
So sorry for the loss! I think it’d be cool if you had a tribute to him in your character name as well, but obviously that’s just a suggestion. May he Rest In Peace!
---
Oof, further solidifying my pick
---
The amount of spec shaming in this thread feels practically thawed out from cryostasis circa 2006-2008.  This is why nobody likes the pserver community, jfc
---
Gutripper.  Dropped off of random trash in BRD.  Can still picture that moment all these years later.
---
Probably shaman. I'm actually quite interested in the class, but will be alliance. Maybe I'll do a shaman alt though, so maybe it won't be the last class I will play */shrug*
---
We do it all the time..? 
---
Pretty sure you can check on twitch any time you want. Everything is a joke when you min/max. 
---
”Private server players”, well if you somehow got a time portal and can lets us all go back we would be happy. Got an authetic vanilla server laying in the drawer? Didnt think you. 
---
Classic is already confirmed to be 1.12 so jokes in you when you see the DW fury tank the raids. 
---
1.12 talents + full world buffs = private server
---
Having played both PvE and PvP, I couldn't ever play on a PvE server anymore.
---
It's like it's missing a giant portion of what the gameplay is supposed to be.
---
less players means more epics for me anyway
---
Yep, that's exactly what I wrote and meant. 
---
Back then, I thought World PvP was like dueling - When you ran across someone your level, you'd wait until you're both full to give each other a fair fight, then duke it out. 
---
That was something you "could" do. But I had to realize 99% of the people didn't. In fact, many people \*gasp\* waited with their attack until you were low from a mob or otherwise made you you had no real chance to fight back. Shock and horror, who'd have thought? 
---
Doing that myself gave me no pleasure. Hence, I always preferred structured PvP like BGs, where at least the level and number of the combatants was somewhat even. 
---
Yes everyone know that? Shamans can purge magic but cant dispell magic...
---
Can you ELI5? Are you guys just getting tailoring high enough to make a few greens to d/e?
---
You *need* Engineering to increase threat generation and very importantly increase AoE threat generation (with sappers).
---
WRONG
---
Only epic gamers will understan 😎
---
As of right now I was going to play with his character names, I was always jealous of them anyways, they were unique and memorable....mine not so much lol. I’ve contacted some old WoW buddies as well and we’re all going to play together so I want him and his characters back in the action.
---
Gotchya. Thanks!
---
Retail players are the biggest threat to Classic.
---
People say retail should be influenced by Vanilla, etc. Absolutely not.
---
They're two different games. Let the microtransaction happy ADHD action RPG players have retail, let the MMORPG fans have Classic.
---
He has just enough game knowledge to make the videos entertaining and right to the point. He doesn't try to bs and pass off false info, he is very up front about disclaimers and info he isn't 100% sure about, which is nice.
---
&gt;10h a day would mean that you’ll hit 60 in less than 6 days.   
---
??? What? 60 hrs is 2.5 days /played, no way he hits 60 in that. And if you mean playing 10 hrs a day will have him hitting 60 in less than 10d played, how would you know that? The amount of time you play IRL has no effect on your /played to hit 60, if anything it lowers it because you get less rested exp.
---
Kids are an untapped resource when it comes to MMO.  Any time they do something wrong and need to be punished, their punishment should be farming WoW mats.  Larval Acid, Runecloth, Thick Leather, whatever you need.
---
A+ parenting and you get some mats farmed in the process.
---
Mage because my wife is going to play with me and she only plays mage... even if I’d love to main one
---
Maybe if you do 10h/day on weekdays, and 18-20+ on weekends. You'll be dead weight for your guild though and need them to carry.
---
Paladin
---
This is it. One of the comments even mentions that it used to be a white but it was later changed.
---
My route doesn't allow me to get a profession until lvl 7 in storm wind. So I am relying on the 2 levels of grinding for cloth, if not pick up skinning and lw and start saving up leather until level 12 when I return back to IF and Stormwind for quest turn ins and trade my greens for a greater wand. 
---
Paladin. Fuck alliance.
---
The average player would not be done leveling in three months. Meanwhile in BFA half the subscribers would have unsubscribed from lack of content three months in.
---
The real irony is the nostalgia argument about people playing Classic. Honestly I think it is more so nostalgia and sunk cost fallacy that is keeping people playing WoW in its current state.
---
Alternate opinion - much of my guild will not group with your guild members because your reputation is that bad.
---
Warriors are in fact the only class with 3 tier1 talent trees. Prot is best pve tank. Fury is best pve raid dps and arm warrior is best pvp class/spec.
---
Redridge was all about the tin. 
---
Also SM top right 
---
The blacksmithing only trinket is pretty great for main tank on some fear heavy fights, especially if you’re horse and not undead 
---
Good, ele/resto shamans are stupid strong in pvp and stack absurdly strong in pvp.  
---
And resto shamans in pve are always in short supply. 
---
The more shamans to purge paladin's shenanigans and in pve to supply totems the better.
---
My route is based on worse case scenario, no sharding, hard to tag mobs. So I do an exploration route that gets me 5 flight paths and skipping all the starting quest in coldridge and some quests in kargath. 
---
It's technically not a "spawn" but the Ghost Saber to tame in Darkshore took forever. :(
---
Make WoW extremely friendly for mods like WC3 was, which spawned multiple game genres like MOBA and Tower Defense. Some private servers are on it already with some interesting genre-changing mods, but of course since it has to be done under the table it doesn't live up to its full potential.
---
My RL buddy and I gamed together from 1998 through when he was taken from us about 3 years ago. That trip included a -lot- of time in EQ and WoW. Something I have done is [registered](vanillafriends.com) both of our names on the Vanilla Friends site in the hopes I can group up with some of the people we gamed with over the years.
---
Sorry for your loss. It fucking sucks.

[https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.3.0) 
---
This was changed in patch 1.3.  Before patch 1.3 there was no limit.
---
&gt;Dungeon Player Caps
---
All dungeons now have a cap on group size to limit the number of players that may enter the dungeon. It was necessary to add this cap as raiding these dungeons trivialized much of the content. Because of this change we can now look to adding better loot to them during future content patches.
---
With that in mind, the dungeons below now have the following caps:
---
Onyxia/Molten Core - 40 members
---
Blackrock Spire - 15 members
---
Diremaul - 5 members
---
All other dungeons in the game will be capped at 10 members.Several dungeons will be re-examined for balancing in light of thischange. In addition, will have their loot improved significatnly forthe next content patch.
---
Love it. It's so pretty &lt;3
---
Yes kharanos...lol I be been calling it kargath all this time!
---
Cool animal forms
---
I am super not interested in playing paladin or priest.  Recently played a paladin to 60 on a private server and have no interest in priest.  Warlock is in a similar boat, but i'd play it again before paladin.
---
Final Fantasy X is coming out for Xbox One in April.... That's how i'm spending my time waiting for classic!
---
Man I must've replayed the scene of him getting uhhh... Spoliers. Many times. sweet sweet justice. 
---
To Vanilla is to PvP, for the golden rule of the golden era in wow; Red equal dead.
---
For not to PvP is to forgo what gives the world life.  To forgo meaning in Classic.  Simply to be unbothered while farming boars gives no meaning to farming boars at all.

That's a perfect description of an Enh Shaman ;)
---
With those builds it will be closer, but that’s largely because your warrior build is pretty rubbish. If you’re going into prot for pvp, you need to get last stand. If not, you want to get enrage in fury, which is nearly 100% uptime when you’re being targeted. In arms you don’t need improved heroic strike or thunderclap, but you definitely do need 2h weapon specialisation and either sword spec or axe spec depending on the weapon you have.
---
Paladins dps is much lower than warriors, but in vanilla pvp dps doesn’t matter anywhere near as much as burst. A warrior with a healer behind him can drop a handful of targets in a few seconds if he uses recklessness. A paladin has minor burst once a minute through judging command on a stunned target, and hoping for crits. 
---
I’ve played both heavily in vanilla, and paladins are fine at 1v1, but in a group pvp setting you want warriors up front and smashing faces
---
I played horde since release. Gonna give alliance a go this time around for a different feel. Most my friends will be playing alliance too.
---
Yeah I would say in vanilla either tanking or healing is the most involved. Healing is always involved because you are literally what keeps people alive, you stop paying attention people die or if you don't heal the right person people die. DPS in vanilla boils down to really basic rotations. Although I much rather the rotations of vanilla than the basic RNG filled dps that modern wow has.
---
Ive seen an alliance shadow priest keep up with and surpass pures in dps, but the dude poopsocked farming consumables.  Ive seen a ret do the same about 50-50 of the time obviously proc depending.  Ive seen bears tank like fucking champs in BWL and AQ40.  These are high risk specs whose rewards have yet to be determined because no one has seriously tried and no groups offer equal support to hybrids vs pures.  Id happily be a pure in an intelligently ran guild like this.  Unfortunately for all you fellow dad dudes, hybrids require more commitment in their less popular specs so gauge your expectations accordingly!
---
Technically it's not that difficult to reproduce moonwalking. Moonwalking is when you strafe right and turn the camera with your mouse to the right at the same time. The old client only updates your character model direction when you stop moving the camera, the new client updates the model all the time.
---
But sadly I doubt they will put in the effort, even though it would be super amazing.
---
My only problem with retail raiding is the abundance of addons you're required to use to stay competitive that basically tell you exactly what is going to happen and how to counter it. Just feels bad to me.
---
From memory it’s around 20-30%. It’s been a while though
---
For a gathering character you want skinning and herb or skinning and mining. Devilsaur leather and mats for the infinite pots and elixirs will make you a rich man. In vanilla I had a 60 healadin and a 55 hunter with herb and skin, I never needed money.
---
your mom's house
---
I was just saying since he was a vanilla tank tanking a BC raid, maybe he was also the Mists of Pandaria Brewmaster Monk tanking it. I guess I coulda worded it better?
---
barrens
---
He has to look his best for the little boys 
---
Savour it, man. It's not a chugging contest. 
---
Shhhhh don't tell me it's easy. Let me feel smart.
---
Yeah my guild in vanilla was like this. We had cat druids, arms warriors, ret pallies, people specced for pvp that just came to raids for fun, we had shitloads of hunters and only 1 warlock that came regularly. We cleared MC / BWL / Ony / ZG just fine. Like nobody brought flasks, we didn't make anyone have optimal specs, no loot council, hunters barely had the brains to figure out tranq, every fight people died.... Idk, it was like not that hard, nobody was even good back then. I played a hunter and was always top 5 DPS or so, and I DEFINITELY was shit at the game. Clicker, bad spec, forgetting arrows all the time...
---
Like I kind of think that making a memespec guild of tryhards would do better than the average guild. Imagine a guild of dedicated players who had a chip on their shoulder. Every feral druid had crowd pummelers and knew how to power shift, your whole raid farmed consumables and enchants, everyone knew the fights and came on time... 
---
That's like all you need to coast through to AQ. You would have trouble in late AQ / NAXX if EVERYONE was memespec, but I imagine that in reality your memespec guild wouldn't be 100% memespec. You'd still have some rogues/mages/warlocks/hunters playing optimal dps and probably a few warrior tanks who collected the plate gear. I'd say it's doable.
---
Obviously Silithus
---
This in fucking amazing if u understand swedish, love that guy :D
---
Druid. Jack of all trades, master of none. I don't like the idea of being a second rate rogue or warrior or an innervate bot.
---
When the unexpected dwarf priest comes by and actually gives you a hand instead of killing you for an easy HK, you just feel a lot better about it -- to the point of actually remembering the player and returning the favor 3 zones later a week after the fact.
---
PvP servers make *every* action more meaningful.
---
Awesome map concept I’d love this for an addon
---
Why is this being downvoted so much?
---
I am a bit confused how people who want to play casually, due to priorities/time constraints, are interested in spending what time they do have making things more frustrating for themselves across PvP, farming, and raiding. How long will you tolerate wiping on Broodlord and re-clearing the suppression room when moonkin, ele shman, and hybrid feral dps just aren't cutting it? Meme specs are perfectly fine when a few are allowed and they have time to try hard but I wouldn't be interested in playing in a guild where a majority play lesser specs and also don't put in the extra effort to compensate for the lesser base performance.
---
Getting rid of bleeds/poisons to be able to vanish is pretty helpful. 
---
Im cryin now 
---
MadSeason is the guy that every mmo should have! He awesome and I love his videos! :)
---
I feel ashamed for not realizing it /facepalm
---
Exactly!
---
If you go around say Hillsbrad or Arathi, or even STV and start ganking... you can just sense the tension rising on both factions.
---
Suddenly players are more cautious around the other factions.. people start becoming more inclined to group up.. and before you know it a 6v6 has broken out and people are getting call outs in [1. General] for help/reinforcements.
---
That sort of thing doesn't happen on PvE.  The only people who flag themselves on PvE are the ones who want a fight.  Its not even remotely comparable between getting dragged into a fight, and taunting some random to attack you when you have the edge.
---
I have many questions! For starters, which faction? Is BoK necessary?
---
Druid 
---
Good post and informative input, I appreciate that. However, considering that we aren't getting an exact copy of Vanilla but just a downscaled version of 7.3.5, wouldn't the bugs he mentioned be irrelevant considering they most likely wouldn't exist (at least not in the same way)? I'm talking specifically about this statement:    
---
"In PvP, if you go Enhancement spec, you are going to be pretty weak for the most part. Stormstrike is an ability that is unpredictable and glitchy, some times not giving WF proc when you should have gotten it."
---
&gt;Inb4 LOL ENJOY getting camped.strawman
---
Lol, you sure? Remember, not everything on pservers is correct. The best of my knowledge they didn't give Honor, but I could be wrong. 
---
Try doing an inland zone and only draw the mountains and roads. Let's take the difficulty up a notch.
---
7/10 Too Much Water
---
Tab target cycle is always going to be the best way to tank multiple targets but during the early part of pulls swipe can provide some initial threat which can be big depending on the quality and intelligence of your dps or even sometimes your healer. How many times have you had a healer HoT you before you pull?
---
And the best BEST tanks (and players in general) know all their specs, and other classes specs and what others can handle. Nothing more annoying than someone telling you what to do when they have no idea how things work. For example a group of 4 lf a tank, only to decline bears since wARriOr BeST tANk!!1
---
Limit was 40 because it's blizzlike at pre 1.3 and since the server tried to be progressive it had that.
---
We'll see what blizzard decides.
---
Engineering is a must. Nothing else comes close.
---
Blacksmithing for min/max. Otherwise if you use your warrior for farming I would go mining or herbalism.
---
I need to know more! Talents, gear, stat priority - is there a place where you have the details written down or should I just pop over to the Discord? Do you go by the same name there?
---
Yeah.. this is till an issue with some people that seemed to never fade over the years. Especially Q+E spammers in combat that leads to just strafing back and forth, especially when they stay in front of you. It bugs the shit out of me for some reason because it makes me think some kid forgot their ritalin. 
---
You can get a bear pet.
---
&gt;Most people who joined WoW wotlk+ probably won't even make it past level 30
---
This is technically me... I love vanilla WoW, but I think my highest level ever (that wasn't on a custom server or an instant max level server) is like 32... Partially because I stop playing, partially because the people I was playing with stop playing (and typically jump to a different fresh server).
---
So Druids cannot be tanks?  I mained one in original Vanilla and was the OT MC, BWL, ZG, AQ...
---
I don’t see your point.
---
I think when Classic comes out I'll actually *lose* weight because I will "forget," lunch and dinner at times and just eat fruit at the computer.
---
Awesome thanks for the quick reply.  
---
So what is the best Arms pvp build that could still tank without respeccing? Or it's not advised since engrage is so key?
---
And I am guessing that a pally comes nowhere close to the same burst considering " A warrior with a healer behind him can drop a handful of targets in a few seconds if he uses recklessness " Correct?
---
Also what was your playstyle when you played ret / holy?
---
Thanks again! 
---
Not so much before the MC, we didn't have the members, but we did do 20-40 man UBRS runs for attunements and gear together and it was a ton of fun. There was a pretty infamous clip of us pulling The Beast and all of the trash through the door while we were on rend because the waves took too long, then we were told by GM's we couldn't do that :/
---
Wow thanks for the write up! I really appreciate this dude 
---
My wifes cousin played the game and I was making fun of it. I was a longtime console fanboy who played nothing but racing sims and madden. She finally got annoyed and told me too try it out, so I made myself a human warrior and started leveling. I stayed up till 4am that first night just trying to hit lvl 10. Not realizing that each level progressively took longer. When I finally hit 10 and got my first talent point I was a killing machine in my mind. 
---
Then I got too 14 and made redridge and got my ass killed almost instantly by an elite. That was the first time I ever joined a group, the level 20ish hunter who was there just helping people also took me too my first deadlines run when i was level 17 and invited me too the guild he was in. Once i joined a guild and people started grouping for everything I was hooked. People are actually helpful in this game!
---
Can you elaborate please. Planning on rolling a druid for casual 5man tanking (and maybe raid healing when I eventually get there). I've been trying to find resources talking about pserver vs true vanilla differences and haven't found any.
---
Death and loss is fucking hard man. My dad died six months ago and everytime I think I got it together, I find out I don't yet.
---
PM me anytime if you need to vent, or reminisce, or anything.
---
"Me, I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest.
---
Honestly, it's the honest ones you want to watch out for. You can never predict when they're gonna' do something incredibly... stupid.
---
If you pvp, maybe blacksmithing for glimmering mithril insignia, 30 second fear immunity every 10 minutes. You are one of only 3 classes that doesn’t get fear removal from pvp trinket, the others being warrior (which obviously has zerker rage) and shaman (which at least has tremor). If you aren’t BM, this makes you arguably the most fear vulnerable class in pvp.
---
Laughed IRL!
---
Woosh, indeed.
---
In my defense, it was really early for me when I wrote this.
---
One actively does something in the game that requires the presence of thought and alertness. Even catching a fish or running to an ore vein in WoW uses more of one's perception than mindless TV watching.
---
Doing different roles in vanilla, it’s not essential you have the right spec for it. Gear is more important. I was a fury/arms warrior for pve and I was the 3rd/4th tank for my guild because I had the gear and was happy to do it. When you first start tanking having more in prot, especially the +threat talent, is a huge boost. 
---
If you’re just doing 5man dungeons tanking, going prot when you first hit 60 is great to get started, and when you’re geared up a bit you can do it fine with any talent spec. The dungeons don’t scale at all, so when you get some raid gear, the 5man mobs and bosses don’t hurt much, and you’re bigger worry is holding threat on everything 
---
tfw when your class can be replaced by a lvl 20 alt. 
---
That's why I love it, his voice is chill. I hate the really over the top "HI GUYS this is UNIQUEcopiedCONTENTDAILY back at ya with ANOTHER EPIC VIDEO, why don't you go SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON AND SUBSCRIBE oh and DONT FORGET ABOUT MY PATREON..."
---
Shut the fuck up we've not all done a line of charlie this morning, at least lube me up before you fuck my ears. 
---
Paladin is the only class that I have never really played in a serious capacity, and I don't think that is ever going to change.
---
Weeeeeell there is a difference between CAN and SHOULD.
---
CAN a pala use a non-optimal spec? Yes.
---
SHOULD a pala use a non-optimal spec? Maybe, if't well established in the guild and it's on farm.
---
My entire vanilla experience was frustrating. I started at the tail end (right when 1.12 was released), and partly due to the game being hard (and partly due to me being a bad player), my leveling was frustrating, PvP was frustrating, and getting ganked and body camped was frustrating (god, Redridge is just a nightmare for Alliance! Horde know this is the lowest-level contested zone for Alliance and come kill some lowbies to blow off steam), but despite all that, I LOVED it. I am fully aware that we may keep wiping and some people might just give up and respec. 
---
If you can get a competent team together that does everything they are supposed to only making a few mistakes along the way (out of 40 people, that’s acceptable and expected), would the below average dps that might happen due to these specs really make it frustratingly prohibitive of progressing?
---
I don't see myself ever playing Horde, so I'll say Shaman.
---
Most of the classes suffer more from lack of Mana than they do from bad damage overall. In a sustained fight they run out of mana to quickly to make the most of there spells for damage. For example Shaow Priest uses rank one Mind Flay. 
---
If we looked to BWL i think that a group of only meme specs would have a hard time on nef
---
Wow thanks for the info, I’ll definitely do this. Sorry for your loss as we. I’ve been just taking it one day at a time 
---
The whole VanCleef story is what hooked me in back in '05.   If it wasn't for this quest chain, I probably wouldn't have continued.
---
Thank you brother, it’s been one of if not the hardest loss I’ve dealt with. I can’t tell you how many memories we made together. I’ll take you up on that PM soon...some days are ok and some days are a struggle to even move from my bed. And also my condolences to you as well.
---
I'm 33, single, basically live alone and have no regular obligations beyond work (3 days/week) and and bi-weekly D&amp;D. I'll be playing the shit out of Classic on my days off, probably for 10+ hours at a time for the first couple weeks. Or months.
---
I've never once felt like I'm being judged for having the kind of time and availability I do by those who don't. If anything, it seems a fair amount of them feel envious on some small level.
---
Which makes sense, as I'm equally envious on some small level of their having wives and families and other aspects of life lacking in my own which I'd rather like to enjoy even as I'm geeking the fuck out over WoW again.
---
Gaming career LOL
---
Not going to impact me much, but it will really suck for everyone making add-ons if there is no beta.
---
[F]
---
What type of shaman was he?
---
So many misconceptions here. Warriors kick ass at levelling if you're smart. Any skilled fury with pre-bis will get into a tier 1 raiding guild no problem, and fury warriors are rank 1 dps consistently through all content. They're far from the best in solo pvp, but with engineering, a good brain, and some hp pots, you can 1v1 any class.
---
The Pope demands 7.1 Dolby Atmos Surround Sound.
---
I hated the aesthetic but it played beautifully.
---
The good kind, I bet.
---
Makes the most financial sense, capture two markets by diversifying.
---
This is what happens when the Pope crash lands on a deserted island.
---
Grizzly, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tX65FOyWCiY
---
Why is warlock off?
---
Mages who get ahead of the pack will level insanely fast.
---
Same honestly. Even to date I enjoy the bottom half of split-screen more, and perfer Luigi to Mario. No regrets.
---
Exactly. Nostalgia is what keeps retail WoW alive today, people are returning to WoW every single expansion because they hope the next expansion will bring back the feeling it once gave them years ago.. but the expansion falls short every single time and the players quit, leaving just a handful of people still playing the game.
---
With classic WoW however, we know exactly what we're getting. We know that we will enjoy the experience because the content and everything else is known and cleared already. We know what we're getting ourselves into.
---
The nostalgia argument hurts retail more than it hurts classic.
---
http://classic.battle.net/war3/human/units/priest.shtml
---
it was because of this 
---
yes on the first half, but you're missing the fact that there is nothing challenging / rewarding / exciting or new in the old content, sure you can play iron man mode of some sort to get that feel back, but the game is inherently different now
---
Played wow classic and raided bwl. My gf and I plan on rolling healer and tank. We’re both looking for a guild to lvl and play with!
---
Same here. I loved being the mana battery. Never hit the hardest but it felt great being able to be a proper support class. 
---
Thank you! I think it leans more towards orc then ;)
---
Is it nagrand?
---
gear list: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pC0engJ0IieOAA1K1EnguvVF0RFLAFEhaf0-e7Okkxg/edit?usp=sharing (still needs stat weight, im lazy...) 
---
The thing is, damage/healing isn't the most important at all. The most important is raid clear time. Having a flexible raid composition is important so you don't have to keep swapping members around for each fight. Hybrids allow that. It could be the difference between being able to run MC/BWL in 2 hours total versus needing an extra 30 minutes swapping members out, summoning new ones, rebuffing, etc.
---
Except you will tank some fights better than a warrior as a bear.
---
I’m going to play Druid and my friend a warrior and we’re going to level together. Would it make sense to spec feral and resto hybrid to more easily heal him both in the world and dungeons? 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMJa7TAAFKE
---
Shaman. Not because I dislike it, but because it’s horde.
---
I think only on a few fights you need to have a bear tank. Don't quote me on this. The fights I here about is the Nef fight with the class calls and a few fights in Nax.
---
Least likely at this current time?
---
Probably either Rogue or Shaman.
---
Rogue because while I enjoy their class quests and the whole Ravenholdt thing, I just don't enjoy the class overall.
---
And Shaman because I'm probably maining Alliance.
---
Ugh. That guy is the worst. 
---
Gnome mage? Come on mate
---
That's a very interesting, and obviously accurte point. I'll be running a Vanilla guild with a couple of buddies and w're just starting to talk about our classes, etc. It looks like both of them want to go Prot Warr, which imo is great because it locks in the tank role and means I don't have to do it, haha. I'm thinking I'll either go a Holy Priest or a Warlock, but I'll have my pick of guild profession. I was starting to lean toward Alch because I know we'll need someone to make flasks (so maybe Herb/Tailor to level, then drop Herb for Alch once I have an alt who can herb).
---
But I'm wondering if it makes more sense to do something like enchanting if I know I could have top dibs on the recipes.
---
Could tell only seeing the lake and SM, first zone I ever stepped foot in love this zone to bits
---
Yep this. I am currently playing gear tank, and getting crit when you have armor cap and 13k HP is not a big deal. You should also be sitting at 30%+ dodge with raid buffs, so that helps.
---
I think the answer is yes, provided the Hordie is PvP flagged himself. 
---
Otherwise, I think not. 
---
I would argue that we are more passionate about Classic WoW than the average Retail WoW player tho.
---
That being said, you gotta be somewhat braindead to think that Classic will be dead after three months :P
---
Alright, makes sense. Thanks man!
---
It is not HD remake, is it? The only thing I wouldn’t mind is updated textures ( OPTIONAL).
---
This is so dumb
---
I love it
---
Hah, joke is on you, I was already old when Wow came out, now I am wise (not)!
---
Back in vanilla - Rogue: I am powerful enough to do the content, but I'm sneaky enough to avoid the fights/repair cost/actual time fighting.
---
Classic WoW - Druid (what I plan on playing): I am self sufficient, and can still be sneaky enough to choose my battles.
---
If you dont want to make friends in order to more easily find groups you can stick to retail. Vanilla is a social MMO.
---
Older memes are better anyway.
---
Plus starting classic off with an epic journey would be sick
---
I have very, very little interest in playing a hunter.
---
Yeah park your level 20 alt in eastern plaguelands! It's so simple! 
---
If you want burst as a weapon-swinging paladin, then reck/ret is probably ideal.  Something like this for offensively oriented, 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AAQ_pA4MBDyXfNQ
---
SoC generally, unless you get reck stacks then go with righteousness or crusader to boost the damage from the reck bomb. 
---
Or if you want a more defensive-oriented build but keeping reck:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/BOqNPEQEP6QODAA
---
This is my preferred reckoning build with a paladin- heal talents are great and you can still just wear mostly damage gear and be a monster.  Flash is your primary heal which barely sips mana, and if you want a big one just pop divine favor and holy light and its a huge guaranteed crit, zero mana cost monster heal. 
---
Sustained DPS as ret is possible but you need a lot of gear to make your weapon swings a bigger threat.  "Burst" is achieved by SOC procs (which can crit for close to 1k) or by judging command on a stunned target which isn't available often. 
---
Reck bombs can easily hit for 4k+ total damage with 5 weapon swings as long as you stun the target first!  Have to get block/dodge/parry off the table before you unleash the full reck bomb. 
---
damn I forgot how much shaman requires keybinding
---
Both people have to be flagged for the AOE to take effect. 
---
The pope 100% rolls as a UD SP
---
But it is though. Because having grouping up and finding members be incovenient force you to make friends and keep in touch with people to avoid exactly that, sitting in town spamming the same sentence over and over.
---
Your mindset is too much centered around yourself only, where groups exist only to further your own goals, and where other players are just something to be used to this end. That retail mindset wont fly.
---
Find a guild to play with, and make sure you all help each others out despite not every member of the group always getting a direct benefit from doing so, and your problems will go away. You scratch their back, they scratch yours.
---
**Tin**
---
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. It is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table of elements.
---
Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons.
---
In 2006, about half of all tin produced was used in solder. The rest was divided between tin plating, tin chemicals, brass and bronze alloys, and niche uses.
---
This is such an amazing video, now every class looks fun and interesting to me. Vanilla WOW really had good class design, too bad they gave the classes to mobile game developers ;/
---
would you like our discord server. We have enough people to start a guild. So if you guys joined now you would most likely have a raid spot and could join us in some leveling!
---
Blizzard is below C tier
---
lol this is going to be awesome!  can't wait til Classic busts all these pserver heros
---
Condolences. I had a friend pass last week myself. 
---
I hope shaman are #1.
---
Yesss I want to druid tank so bad
---
I've been on the same decision for quite some time - orc sham vs troll priest, pros &amp; cons (from most important to least):
---
Priest:
---
Pros: mind control, pws, talent trees, benediction, levitate, full range of heals, Mana burn, shadowguard blackout, dispell(both), easy groups
---
Cons: cloth, inner fire, rogues, slow steady damage, group heal only, primary target in BG, PvE pigeonholed
---
 Shaman:
---
Pros: totem buffer, reincarnate, water walk, fire totems, cleanse totems, chain heal, chain lightning, talent trees, mail armor, big crits, slows, ghostwolf 🐺, nature's swiftness, astral recall, interupt, melee synergy, grounding totem.
---
Cons: totem uptime, ghostwolf cast time, PvE pigeonholed, non-steady damage, wearing cloth, no HoTs, offensive only dispell.  
---
  
---
I may be forgetting some parts. For my experience, I have always mained priest so I am going to flavor it up with shaman this time, however I will only play him with my warrior friend, duo-level. My solo time will be priest, druid or warlock.  
---
Mind control keeps calling me tho
---
If you have a great group of friends there is another obscure way of getting more characters for professions: 
---
if the xp distribution is blizzlike, then mobtagging can be incredibly efficient. One guy on a pserver got banned and within 1day 16hours played he was back at 60 by tagging mobs and others killing them granting the lowbie full xp.
---
This allows people to get chars solely for professions. If you plan on enchanting, you need to do it on your main, because lots of the patterns are BoP and need revered/exalted with certain factions, something you won't experience with an alt. 
---
An alchemy alt can be lvl 35 and can craft everything except flasks, because he needs to enter level 50+ dungeons like Scholomance or BWL in order to use the laboratory.
---
If the raids stay as "easy" as they are on pservers, then you wont need flasks really for raids until late BWL or really in AQ40, therefore you can just grind a character to 35 by mob tagging in 10hours and learn all recipes like Fire Protection Potion on him. later if you fancy, you can keep leveling to 60.
---
Now if Blizzard only had some reference of some independently hosted Classic Wow servers where hundreds of thousands of players play and have played for years now. Perhaps they could observe or even have one of those independent teams provide tons of metrics and personal experience.
---
lol. Ya, I find those people who say Classic will fail rather funny too.
---
Warlock. Can't stand the playstyle
---
A good Shaman doesn't let another Shaman use Windfury while leveling.
---
Start there.
---
You can tank with zero points in prot easily. While the points in prot are helpful while tanking for sure they aren't anywhere near required to defeat the content.
---
That would be great!
---
Thanks man. 
---
Don't forget finkle's Skinner so you can skin the core hounds
---
Never understood people who keybind their hearthstone
---
Probably warlock/hunter/Druid. Can’t decide which one
---
They also do it from behind. 
---
The biggest issue will be the lack of certain class trainers and you may be forced to head back to Org to train.
---
&gt; people are returning to WoW every single expansion
---
This is me and I've never stayed more than 2-3 months since TBC.
---
Hunter.
---
I love classes that can fill several roles, so I'll start with the hybrids and the healers and I'll play the DPS classes last if at all.
---
Also I love leveling and Hunter leveling seems super boring for me. Don't think I've ever managed to get past level 15 as a hunter.
---
I think i vaguely remember this happening and being dissapointed
---
In what universe can a paladin kill dozens, i.e. 24+ lvl 60 mobs at once?
---
Crazy. The guy that got me into WoW 14 years ago, died 3 years back. I also have decided this week that when classic drops, I'm going to recreate his vanilla character, Warlock. 
---
gotcha I've never played horde, alliance only
---
Understandably.
---
As a Paladin player it is the most important keybind next to Bubble.
---
Thanks man, appreciate it. And yeah i did some last minute audio tweaking, not realizing some parts were already on the cusp of being too loud unfortunately. I'll get that issue squared away in the future.
---
Tyvm :)
---
So many of these "sarcastic points" I actually agree with.
---
&gt; 9) Flying. This was a mistake. You know it. I know it. Everyone knows it.
---
Yes. Agreed. Where is the sarcasm?
---
The retail audience really is fucked up. I am sure they are very passionate and protective about the current retail game philosophy, where they have gotten to a point where there is heavy discussion whether or not the game has over 1m subs anymore.
---
Engineering is mandatory. Secondly you can get mining and farm arcane crystals for your Thunderfury.
---
Druid tanks? It's those things running dungeons nonstop. What, you're LFG? Sorry, we're full. 
---
I remember that in legion. Levels 1 to 110 you went from like 60 hp to like 400k. Gearing at 110 took you from 400k to 15 million. So a level 110 player is closer in power to a level 1, than a geared level 110. Depending on how you looked at is, that is.
---
Makes sense. Saving yourself from a death is a pretty huge bonus. I'm not sure about 6% more movespeed from cheetah though. Wouldn't you lose more time than you'd gain by not having Mortal shots and such from MM?
---
Some people are so afraid of being labeled a clicker they keybind everything.
---
Thought it was only going to be Frost Shock.
---
It's not bad to split up into two trees. But depending on your playstyle you can also go as deep as you want. The beauty of Druid is, that there are so many specs that work for different playstyles.
---
I'm not sure if there is a Moonkin/Cat specc, I could actually see that work, pretty well in PvP. Who knows.
---
Personally I go for 3 Sets: Resto, Tank and Cat. I personally don't like ranged Casters.
---
Cat for farming, Resto is my main and Tank when we need a Bear Tank. But depends on what you are aiming for.
---
It all depends of what your goals are in WoW and what you want to do, if you want to do hardcore PvP, hardcore PvE or just explore everything casually.
---
Moonkin is absolutely okay for Dungeons, if that is what you want to do the majority of the time, you should absolutely play it. If you want to be PvPer, Moonkin can crit very HARD. If you want to be hardcore Raider, you might want to invest into Healing gear. On the other hand, you can be a pretty good Damage Dealer if you master the Cat rotation, which is the hardest rotation in the game.
---
What I don't think works for Druid in Classic is, if you limit yourself to only 1 Specc.
---
Druid is all about being flexibility.
---
&gt;repair costs are through the roof due to wearing plate
---
I dont believe this is a thing in 1.12.1. You should be paying just per point of lost durability, and not extra because of armor type.
---
About as long as it takes to Ping from level 9 to 10 in vanilla 
---
For like ur 3rd vid it's still really good.
---
Bear tanks are great for 5 mans and UBRS. They even excel at certain raid encounters. Pally tanks...well they are good at farming and...that's really all I got
---
I dont know about the current pope but a few years ago i watched a documentary about the pope (johannes paul 2) and yes indeed, he was watching tv and enjoyed it.

---
Realtalk, I've never heard anyone use the term "dudu" to refer to Druids, prior to playing private servers in 2015.
---
I see a few assuming that one whole guild must level fast so they have enough for MC. 
---
This isn't what happens normally.
---
What happens if that nearly everyone of you gets in a guild and starts leveling. You chat and plan what lvl 60 will be like with the pre-BIS grind and when you can be ready for raiding.
---
Your top few levelers reach 60. They have enough to form their own 5 man or bring in some singles to round the group out. They get their pre-BIS fast, because they leveled fast and that won't change.
---
Now a small portion of your guild is MC ready but not enough for a raid. They then get invited or snipe other pre-BIS 60s from other guilds. They form a raid.
---
The core raid group fills a bit more from the next wave of 60s but the drive to raid forces the first raid group to either leave your guild for another or they snipe other 60s from other guilds to get the raid group completed.
---
All the slower levels in the guild how have no room in their own guilds raid and "HOPE" a second raid group forms. Many get annoyed and leave for other raid groups forming or have to recreated a raid group because their own raiders already left for the top raid guild.
---
I don't think they will, but I absolutely hope they do. It's so infuriating to get two Paladin/Shaman drops on the same boss as the opposite faction. It happened to my guild on our first ever Neffy kill, iirc.
---
Eh, in my experiences raiding on both factions, Druids were always in very short supply. We'd never have more than 3 per raid.
---
Skinning/leatherworking is definitely fine for enjoyable, self-sufficient playing.  Engineering offers a lot of extra tools for pvp and I guess some pve situations (extra control/aoe damage, or stuff like feigning death during to wipe and try to res the healer with jumper cables afterwards).  I guess nets and rocket boots could help with kiting too.
---
I played a leatherworker hunter originally, and made a lot of money off selling stormshroud to rogues (back in the day when people bought it), but the end-game utility was low.  There are some FR recipes you can craft for MC/BWL, but that's about it.  If you feel like managing a bag full of trinkets/engineering gear to up your game, engineering I think can definitely have a bigger impact.  But there's nothing wrong with the more casual route with leatherworking.  
---
shame gnomes can't be shamans
---
To be completely fair..... classic isn't out. I'm sure a lot of us will actually be playing Classic when it drops and..... not be spending all of our wow time in this subreddit.
---
One would think. I know I (once classic is out) won't be in this forum quite as much). I like to do my chatting in-game (and maybe in the discord).

This is an offensive joke about the pope.
---
God demands 7.1 dolby atmos surround sound, as our lord speaks through the pope.

Reminds me of HOMM 2 or 3, those turned based games from 3DO back in the 90s.

An add-on that aggregates LFG and LFM into a scrollable window will not change the time required to find a PUG.

I never played retail, or anything past TBC, so you can take your condescension elsewhere.

Fair point.
---
I think with one extra talent point you can get SL and Ruin.  You just can't get any affliction talents, so on improved lifetap or instant corruption.

For sure he was super deep into destro, it was just kinda fun to think of him with SL also :)

6-10. This is the level bracket that most of my attempts at converting retail players get to before quitting.

Something that can heal can basically make the hunter's pet invincible.  A druid or shaman makes a lot of sense.  A hunter with someone to add extra dps and heal his pet can solo a lot of group content.
---
The old way was just to add your friends, seeing how (I hope) we won't have crossrealm, we probably won't need bnet as much as retail do.

If I may offer a piece of unsolicited advice. Pick important dates and put them on your calendar with a week advance notification. Maybe it's his kids bday, Christmas, or just the anniversary of his death. Do something for his spouse/kids/parents. Even if it's just a card saying you're thinking about them. Do it like clockwork on those dates. They're hurting too and this will show them his life had a lasting impact on others.

You've inspired me. Here's my Melee Hunter build. Absolutely no use against casters, but oh well.

---
I mean if they're willing to do things like BoP loot trading, then fixing loot tables to prevent opposite-faction drops doesn't seem very far-fetched.
---
Also misleading in that it has an extreme sampling bias. The people tracking classic wow to this degree are not representative of the general population and are likely to make choices not representative of the general pop. 
---
STV is where boys become men,
---
Retail is full of boys and women.
---
What? Why did they remove "some" portals? I swear Blizzard does things literally nobody asked for to screw with the players.

All pet commands are outside of the GCD. You can macro pet commands into nearly any of your skills.

It has been a couple years since I played WoW, I've been doing EQ progression servers for the last year.  I honestly can't remember if a healer HoT tick will agro the healer.  In EQ it doesn't so pre-HoTing a tank is a very good idea.  I think in WoW it does transfer to the healer, even if he cast it before I pulled....
---
Good UI for Phones.

Before Cross realm BG's it was a lot of fun because if you went out to farm or something you'd see, from time to time, one of your arch nemeses' in the world and it made fighting them that much more meaningful.

Maybe paladin, but it depends.

I'm going to be playing horde, probably exclusively, so if I did play all the horde classes and decided to jump on the alliance side to play then I'd probably play paladin seeing how that'd be the only class I hadn't played yet. 
---
I quit so long ago there are so many things here I just have no concept of, without the odd old class name it could have been about a completely different game.

Fear spam.
---
Def the good kind. RIP
---
It does which blows. PW:S sucks pre pull too for warriors and druids, in my opinion, because it takes away from initial rage generation which can lower your initial TPS which again is problematic. Especially if you're horde and dont have Salvation. Certain classes can threat spike with no aggro dump so every bit of threat counts.
---
Swipe shouldnt be spammed but can get cycled in every few rotations depending on the situation. Particularly at the beginning 
---
I think this is one of the few things most NOCHANGES guys will agree on
---
Lets be honest.
---
If I'm going to spend time in the "easier" raids (i,e, Ony and MC) I'm here for the gear to PvP with. Never really enjoyed the Raid content in WoW.
---
In which case, I'm not going to want to ever put up with 5 ret paladins doing fk all or the 3 boomkins constantly out of mana on every trash pull. And I'm definitely NOT going to want to heal a half-assed geared Bear Tank in MC.
---
So with all due respect, I would *never* join a super casual meme spec raid.  Unless of course I'm there to insinuate some drama and cause a wipe on purpose because I'm not a nice person.  
---
&gt; I am fully aware that we may keep wiping and some people might just give up and respec.
---
So then you're hoping to be part of a typical casual raiding guild...except you get to be the one playing a meme spec since other people 'gave up'. I played retail vanilla and many different private servers and I am really wondering what competent main tank is going to waste their free time wiping in MC or BWL while watching arcane mages and ret paladins contributing 1/2 as much as they could. The players that do respec will probably move on to greener pastures as well. Wiping loses its charm very quickly - especially when people choose to contribute substantially less.
---
yeah when you’re wiping because of freeloaders patience wears thin. don’t take my word for it though. you’ll face the reality eventually. 
---
too bad one single useful spell doesn’t justify a raid spot when you could bring someone who is actually putting in effort and values the whole raid’s time. 
---
Off topic a bit but I was also planning on playing a prot warrior ally side and was wondering how 'mandatory' the human wep skill is? I want to tank in raids but I also want to do PVP BG's especially premades if I can and was leaning towards gnome for overall. 
---
The typical hybrid build that is closer to yours listed is 1/29/21 with the point being having 4/5 (due to 1 point Nature's Grasp being worth taking) HoTW so you get the stat boosts in various forms and Int for caster.
---
The true Druid Hybrid builds for pvp required Hybrid gear. Hybrid gear basically doesn't exist early in the game. It's typically smarter to level as feral and go for both healing and feral gear in dungeons, convert to healing (or prove your worth as feral) for raids until you get enough gear to properly build a hybrid set.
---
This feral hybrid build can still level. It's more of a dot build so you don't take Improved Shred. Pure feral will level much faster overall however.
---
If you do focus on a hybrid build, especially for pvp, you have to bloat your stats up like mad. You basically need them all (and pvp hit cap of course). This is why you need a true hybrid set. Feral is easy to stat. It's purely physical and no requirements on additional Int and spell damage.
---
Thanks for that. I think i will go with blacksmithing. 30s immunity sounds very good especially when some warlocks don't know this item and try to cast fear multiple times. Am i getting it right that this q reward is from the armorsmith specialisation?
---
Never played a druid in Vanilla but a lot in TBC.  
---
Looking at the talent tree you need a lot of talent points in resto for it to matter so i'll say no. You can heal dungeons as feral if you save all the +int ger you get from quests.  
---
You will maybe have a bit more downtime as feral but kill enemies more efficient too. Feral is a pretty good specc for damage dealing before endgame du to fixed damage (weapon dps don't matter as feral).
---
The first spec you linked looks very solid, that's what I would play if I ever dare rolling a retpal.
---
Why use SoR with reck stacks ? Is SoC not working with the extra attacks ?
---
&gt;so you can take your condescension elsewhere.
---
So you want to change the game for your own benefit and you get mad at anyone that argue against that? Perhaps this is not the game for you then.
---
Teldrassil has the best music and atmosphere of any zone
---
that’s fair. if you’re going to go above and beyond and farm for hours a day to supply your raid with flasks then yeah you deserve a spot. as long as you realize that you’ll have to put in more time and effort than those playing specs that bring more in terms of core utility. 
---
Yeah, but those things are only in there because they help Actiblizzion's bottom-line by eliminating GMs.
---
Poor, starving waif that Bobby Kotick is...

Nef would be a fight you can't tank as a druid because class call forces you into cat form
---
[Perfection](https://media.giphy.com/media/9WXyFIDv2PyBq/giphy.gif)
---
Rogues. They bore the fuck out of me, as do Mages. I just cannot find anything appealing in either of those classes.
---
It may help your post if you mentioned what region realm you plan to roll on and the realm type.
---
Oh, it's usually bound on 1 most of the time! I just change place with Grace of Air sometimes ;)
---
IIRC the Warrior class call locks you in Berzerking Stance. You would need to switch aggro to the warrior or bear druid based on which class call Nef uses.
---
Let's look at it this way, will you remember a night of grinding more memorably when fighting nothing but PvE mobs? Or will you remember that one time that rogue opens up on you and you clean the floor with him? Or perhaps you do indeed die and starting recruiting folks to have a merry fellowship and protection from that shifty looking rogue 5 levels higher than you.
---
You're correct- SOC only has a chance to proc on one attack.  So you will often get the SOC proc with a reck bomb but only possibly get one proc. 
---
Sotc boosts white damage by a ton, and the boost is applied to all of the instant attacks equally.  So it can be great vs clothy or a druid in caster form/ rogue. 
---
SOR adds that flat damage (and ignores armor) so I usually like it best against shaman, warrior, paladin, hunter. 
---
Always, always use hammer first if you have it when you have a big reck bomb.  I also use a simple mod called "reck counter" or something like that which is a small counter you can place wherever to show you how many stacks you have.  Nice to be able to see, you can kind of know you will get a one-shot and be able to use it properly.  Or if you have 3 stacks, that's still a shitload of damage so go for it.  1 stack?  Maybe wait a bit =P

Haha thats awesome to see
---
My warlocks always end up SM/ruin (until enough +Spelldamage to demosac), which couldn't be an easier playstyle. Corruption, Curse of Shadows, and shadowbolt in your dungeons/raids. Might have to run a different curse depending on whos in your raid, like elements or if you're the big +Damage lock, you'll get to run the curse of agony while some other locks debuff.  When grinding and leveling, just use your dots and use life tap with the combo of your health steal abilities and you'll never have to stop.
---
If you get into point pinching late-game on your warlock, you can run 4/5 corruption talent. You wont be able to cast it while moving anymore, but it does keep the cooldown short enough its under the global cooldown time and wont interfere with your rotation if worked in properly.
---
Keep curse of recklessness handy, as tossing it on a fleeing mob will keep it from running into more shit. Can make you feel like a hero at times. You can also toss this on enemy players to buff them if youre in the carebear mood.
---
I always take tailor/enchant on my locks as it fits the character/profs plan I usually use. Herbalism/alchemy is fine too, as you'll find yourself addicted to shadow power pots.
---
I still have a lot to learn :)
---
Do we know for sure that this guy isn't Jonathan Pryce or the Pope?
---
NPC cuck.
---
I'm really not buying the whole "BoP loot trading is to prevent GM tickets about it" explanation, since playing on private servers, accidental mis-looting almost never happens. Blizzard is a multi-billion-dollar game dev, it's not like they're struggling to afford an adequate amount of GMs for Classic servers.
---
My eyes
---
As I recall that's a more recent change, in vanilla you could get flagged if your aoe hit a flagged person off the opposite faction or if you just accidentally right clicked them assuming they were flagged.
---
What makes them different? You mean like
---
Larger server populations
---
Increased gathering node respawn rates
---
Unknown proc rates on items
---
Inaccurate talents and spell interactions
---
Incorrect Armor and spell values
---
Incorrect boss mechanics
---
Incorrect quest xp and reputation values
---
Broken quests and quests that don’t work properly
---
No one is saying that you can’t any comparisons, but you have to realize thousands of little things wrong add up to big differences. I’ve played tons of private servers as well and they all have differences in scripting, aggro, raid difficulty etc. I’m glad we had private server experiences but they will be different from classic. So quit with the classic vs private server battles that pop up.
---
A warrior can still tank nef in beserker stance though, they just take 20% more damage so healers just need to spam more. A druid going cat form means they will literally get one shot it's not possible to heal through it. 
---
&gt;implying you need everything.
---
Ret paladin is a tanky support character who occasionally one shots people with 4 reckoning stacks. Warriors dance around the enemy team applying mortal strikes and praying for crits.
---

Druid. 
---
In TBC I started a druid alt and ever since then it has been my most maintained alt character. It can do everything. Great at healing, great at tanking, often great at dps too! Shit there are some expansions where I consider making it my main character simply because it seems like blizz loves the class so much. But in Vanilla? God no. Weapon stats didn't matter at all so you end up with dumb fuckery like a blue item from gnomer being the best weapon in the game for feral. They could barely tank anything higher than a five man competently compared to a warrior and their dps was just pathetic. They're also the only healer without a regular rez ffs. There are only a couple things I think they have going for them in vanilla. They're great flag carriers and they're pretty rare so you can probably very easily find a guild. 
---
But yeah every class has something over them. Warriors are better tanks AND dp
---
I don't know why, but I got super strong  Heroes of Might and Magic 3 vibes from this. Looks very much like a typical map that of course spawned you in the worst possible place with literally no resources for miles, but 10 pandora's boxes and 20 utopias. Bitch please.
---
Man, HOMM3, Diablo 2 and later on Vanilla were the goddamn fucking blissful gaming years. Maybe some CS 1.5/1.6 for that shooter fix. Welp, I think I just overdosed on nostalgia again.
---
I'm definitely not saying private servers are perfect, but some people are vehement that *absolutely nothing* about them is correct and that viable specs and BiS lists will change because of their *total lack of having anything correct whatsoever*. Private servers definitely give us a good gist of what classic will be like when it comes to the meta, even if every single little detail is not perfect.

I mean ops question was regarding the overall viability of hotw/ns for all types of content. I gave him the information on what he will needs to do.

---
I have earthbind on the standard side mouse button. Its one of the most common buttons I click and I always have various movement spells on that button for different classes. In the end whatever works for you and your muscle-memory is what is best.
---
Basically just stack stam and int, that's it. Armour is also really good if you can get it, should at least have an armour weapon and trinkets/rings to swap in and out. Strength isn't great but it's ok. Agility is even worse. Spirit and +healing /dmg is just ok at best. Really no stat is useless for you but some are definitely better than others.
---
Really your goal as a druid is just to stack stam/int/armour to make you as hard as possible to kill. Your role in pvp is to annoy/harrass/escape and either slowly wear the enemy down if they can't heal, or delay them until your allies arrive.
---

---
It’s for sure that pre BiS lists will change. We have to re test every item with a proc and have to confirm builds are still viable vs bosses that may have higher resistance or Armor values. It gives us an idea yeah but we don’t know if it’s true or not.

---
&gt; Druid is all about being flexibility. 
---
Yeah flexibility is what i aim towards. My plan is to have fun and preferably do all the content i want, which is dungeons, pvp (but that can really be played with any spec) and at least try raiding, because of sweet loot and epic battles. 
---
I do like big crits, but i also like healing and rogue things. I don't really know what gear is good and all tier sets seem to be towards healing.
---
Cool thanks. 
---
&gt;Warriors kick ass at levelling if you're smart.
---
They are hands down the worst leveling class along with rogues who are slightly faster due to having more tools to deal with multiple mobs.
---
I dont know why you claim the guy is spreading misconceptions when it's actually true.
---
Hahahaha you're right, I just recently heard it and love it! Never heard it in vanilla and I mained a Druid.

Sorry for your loss.

I can't speak too much on Lock as I've only gotten up to about 45ish on 1.12 and never raided. But I'll tell you what I do know. They are a blast to level, probably the best class in Vanilla in terms of speed + fun factor. As you probably know, they have a lot of tricks up their sleeve. Pulling and killing 3-4 mobs at once every other pull is easily achievable, with VW tanking 1-2 while they're dotted up, face tanking one while it's dotted up (easy with Demon Armor on yourself and health stones), and one feared while dotted up. Then just wand em down. You'll never oom with Improved Drain Soul which you should rush when leveling. This + Life Tap is pretty OP. You can always Lifesteal down any mob you're fighting as well. As far as pets goes, not having to feed them is quite nice over hunters. A small tip/trick I recommend is only learning the pet spells you're going to use while leveling in order to save as much gold as possible, IE VW Taunt and/or Sacrifice. You won't use imps or any other of your minions much while leveling, so dw about buying their grimoires, you can always get them later at 60. A small misconception some people have concerns the class mount. At level 40 you get the Felsteed mount from your class trainer NO QUEST NECESSARY. Literally it's a free mount I think it might cost a few dozen silver or maybe a gold or two to learn the spell (it's a spell not an in-bag item I believe). At 60 you're spamming shadowbolt from MC through to Naxx. Always keep 4 or 5 soul stones in your bags while leveling in case your VW dies or to SS yourself, or for the odd summoning portal when hopping into an instance. At 60 you're expected to keep your bag filled to the brim with these while raiding. Very fun, easy class, and an absolute monster at open world PVP while leveling - very quick at leveling too. I strongly recommend this as your first lvl 60/main. 
---
I mained Shaman since Vanilla up to and including modern BFA and have raided at different levels for nearly every xpac. I level'd two Shamans to 60 in Vanilla, once as mostly Enhance and once as mostly Resto (which took forever!). I have raided in top U.S 25 guilds with my Rsham, been raid leader, guild leader, class leader, you name it. I know quite a bit about shamans and I'm happy to help with what I know about Vanilla (which admittedly is a bit less than later xpacs when it comes to this class). 
---
When you're first starting out esp in the very early levels, Shams are actually surprisingly a bit on the weaker side. You're basically going to pull with LB, and melee them down with Rockbiter on the best weapon you can get your hands on (I believe Tauren have a level 9ish quest that sends them into the Mines near Bloodhoof that rewards a nice 2h Mace with +2 strength, definitely get this asap - you may need to learn 2h Mace at TB). Start healing yourself once you hit about 40-50% HP when fighting a mob, because HW takes a while to cast and the spell pushback is quite strong. DO NOT forget to get your totems, my first toon ever I completely missed the Earth Totem Quest, and had to run all the way back to Camp Taraje to get it in my 30s. So yeah, do your Earth totem quest and pretty much all the quests in Mulgore and try to avoid pulling more than 1 mob at a time, or you may die. Heading into to Barrens around 12 things open up, make sure you do your Fire Totem Q which is rather pretty easy iirc. MAKE SURE YOU LEARN THE DAGGER SKILL ASAP - (I think in Org). Contrary to popular belief, the most efficient way for a shammy to level is with Flametongue Dagger and Shield. The second you learn Flametongue which is pretty early on, find the fastest 1h weapon you can (preferably a decent dagger) and for the rest of forever your rotation is LB, Searing Totem, Stab Stab Stab. Searing Totem is the first and most important Fire Totem spell you get, so again it's available early only and should always be down when fighting mobs. You can switch it up to 2h WF later on, but we'll go over that later. Stat Priority while leveling is Stam &gt; Str &gt; Agi &gt; Int &gt; Spirit. Again, you're basically going to Dot enemies down one at a time with Flametongue + Searing Totem (use Earth Shock on casters/healers and Flame Shock whenever you want if you have some mana to spare). I usually don't bother with dropping Earthfury Totem too much just because mobs die too quickly and I feel like it's a waste of mana, but for very fast attacking mobs such as Plainstriders/Cats (or anything else really), Stoneskin Totem is actually very underrated for questing/farming. Don't worry about keeping Lighting Shield up on yourself, again it costs a lot of mana, but I do pop it while I'm running from one place to the next and not really fighting anything in between. Healing in low level dungeons is very easy, general rule of thumb is use one lower rank HW then you currently have, so if you're doing Wailing Caverns and your current HW is rank 3, then use rank 2. (Always bring water or ask mage for water before heading to any dungeon as a healer). It is very easy to heal dungeons as enhance from 1-55ish when you respec Resto, so don't stress too much. Oftentimes you'll end up grouping with a Priest anyway so you can just DPS it out. So you got a good fast Dagger, a decent shield with decent stats, and your two totems. You're doing well. Gz. Now comes Water Totem Quest. GFL. This quest is a pain the f\*\*\*\* a\*\*\*.  It's not hard, but it is VERY long and requires A LOT of running around, from Barrens to Silverpine back to Barrens and just pretty much everywhere in between. Rewarding though, because you'll be expected to drop your mana spring totem in every dungeon henceforth until the end of time.
---
At level 30 you get your Air Totem for free. I don't even think there's a quest involved, you literally just learn it on the spot (which is actually kind of weird and bothers me a bit, but I guess it makes up for the Water Totem). You also get Ghost Wolf which is a freaking god-send and incredibly useful, and other all the other classes (except Druid I guess -and Warlock ofc) will be quite jealous of you (30% speed increase is brilliant, and you can afford to NOT get your mount straight away at 40 unlike most other classes). You get Reincarnation around this time which is nice, but make sure you keep some reagants in your bags (Ankhs). All in all, a lot of fun tricks up your sleeve. Most importantly around this level you get Windfury Weapon. IF you want to try this route, you HAVE to get Corpsemaker from RFK. No exceptions. It's an absolute BEAST of a weapon and basically a WF Shaman's version of WW Axe for Warriors. You'll do MASSIVE damage when WF procs and will 1 shot most enemies. There's tons of highlight reels on YT for you to find of this. However, the RNG can sometimes really go against you, and there are times where you'll just be standing there missing, enemy parries/dodges everything, and your WF never goes off - and then you die. In general, Dagger+FT/shield &gt; 2H+WF 90% of the time, but personally I always grab a Corpsemaker with WF at lvl 30 until like lvl 40-45ish when I drop it for a sick dagger I might find later on. But technically speaking, Dagger and Flametongue is still better and faster than WF + 2h for leveling/grinding.
---
At or around level 55-58 you respec into Resto and start farming your pre-raid BIS. From here on out, you'll basically be farming end-game dungeons and dungeon quests till you hit 60. You hit level 60. Grats! Now you'll be spending your entire raiding career dropping WF and Resistance Totems, and spamming Chain Heal and LHW. In PVP, Ele/Resto Hybrid is very strong spec, where you blow up enemies with massive Chain Lightning burst damage. Alternatively, you can always save up about 10 thousand gold and buy yourself to a Sulfuras, Hand of Rag, then get to work making your Youtube Highlight Reels on the way to your pay2win R14. GL with that last one.
---
A good tip while leveling is to drop your Stoneskin, pull an enemy with LB, drop Searing, and melee him to death. Then pull the next enemy with LB and kite him back towards your totems so you don't have to waste mana dropping new totems every time you pull a mob. Rinse and repeat. Oh, and put all your points into Enhance while leveling until you get Stormstrike, then put the rest into Ele until you respec to Resto later on. 
---
Shaman are a great class, and are a lot of fun. They've been my main since I started playing on '05, and are a blast in Vanilla as well. Locks are amazing and very underappreciated, and are IMO one of, if not the most satisfying class to level with in Vanilla. Either way, best of luck to you and I hope your friend may rest in peace.
---
Or healthstones. Or curses.
---
The only BiS items with procs are weapons, so that's about the only thing that needs to be re-tested. I also don't see how having more armor would affect the viability of a build. Proportionally, damage will be the same whether the boss has 10K armor or 15K armor.
---
I also really want to know what that section is about!
---
&gt; The thing is, damage/healing isn't the most important at all. The most important is raid clear time. 
---
What encounters do you think can't be cleared by a single well-balanced 40-toon raid with no hybrids? Also, speed-clearing seems like it's only relevant when you have all the content on farm, and most raids worry about progression.
---
"Wiser" :'D
---
It has the same glow, to be precise. It only has the same cast animation as well if you're a Tauren, as they have identical targeted and omni cast animations.
---
I remember back when I was selling dreadsteed runs as a warlock I once got called into a group that had an enha shaman
---
and he actually held aggro pretty well
---
too small
---
&gt;sub-par tank
---
Not true. Their tank spec is very competitive for any raid in the game in an offtanking capacity. They have the highest threat output in the game with MCP's, and they share very little gear with your other tanks which means you will gear your raid core quicker by running with 2 warriors and 1 druids as your tank core over 3 warriors.
---
They lack somewhat in aoe tanking capabilties, and not having shield wall means tanking several bosses as the MT is out of the question unless the raid overgears the content, but the spec is overall in a very good place.
---
&gt; you can't complete MMO games
---
Sure you can. The problem with your logic is that you can just keep stacking on more and more objectives to claim that the game is impossible to complete.
---
You can't claim you've completed vanilla WoW until you've done it on every single class, with no keyboard, blindfolded, upside down, underwater, in a plane, with only 5 A presses!!!
---
See what I mean? It's a lot simpler to just set a realistic goal like "get grand marshal" or "kill KT".
---
That UI is my worst nightmare, since I'm always a fan of simplicity.
---
Paladin 
---
So I just wasted the last 9 years on private realms? I think not. 
---
Watch as many videos as you like, read as many guides as you want, there is no replacement for actual experience.  There will be those that are playing at the top on retail that will convert quite successfully, but will they be just as efficient and profitable as someone that has been playing the same game (just vanilla) for close to 10 years on private realms?
---
The "average" player new to vanilla or new to wow is going to take a VERY long time to even master the basics of playing a main class to 60 and doing some of the raids/pvp.
---
I am sure that I could race to 60 join the hardcore guild and play the game like I was 34 (yes I am even older now thats not a typo), but thats simply not fun any more when I have done it a few times already.  I am looking forward to relaxing on a realm I know wont close, helping players in any way I can with information and advice, and taking my time to enjoy the reaction of others to the world I  have enjoyed for close to 15 years.  
---
Exactly the same as a mage/rogue main I always see druids to be too much for too little. 
---
It's certainly doable to tank Nefarian as a Druid, but it's not advicable at all. With proper itemization you will be sitting at around 30% dodge, and 7-8k HP without Bear Form while having 40% damage reduction from armor. On top of this you can pop a stoneshield potion for another 2000 armor whenever the Druid class call happens.
---
That being said, it's much MUCH safer to use a Warrior for this fight.
---
You know, come to think of it... has anyone seen those two in the same room at the same time before? 
---
I doubt MC will be cleared in 2 weeks. Not only will you need all 40 raiders putting in a minimum of 12 hours a day but you will also need a large group of other players farming herbs (specifically black lotus) to make the hundreds of consumables needed to pull it off and given that p-servers have vastly increased spawn rates and spawn densities of herbs compared to vanilla I dont think it'll happen.
---
It'll totally happen a month after release though.
---
I'm sure the pserver pros have learned after all these years how to transcend math.
---
Interesting take on things, where have you seen this? I'm curious to hear more about your experience
---
Lol!
---
wind from hell storm, yeah, cheers brother!
---
I can't remember if it was overtuned or bugged, I think bugged, but something was causing C'thun to be literally unkillable for about a month back in retail vanilla, and once Blizzard hotfixed it, then it died.
---
No changes, you must click.
---
Who has said "that absolutely nothing about them is correct"? Inventing oponents might make you prove a point, but it doesn't make it true.

---
The Tier Sets might be all about healing, but Tank and Cat gear are actually so niche items, that no will even bother picking them up.
---
The only issues you are going to have are trinkets, rings and amulets, but that problem has every class.
---
Rogue thrives on Dex, but Cat needs Str. I mean one of the best Weapons for Cats is the Nat Pagle's Fish Terminator. lmao
---
The only thing that might be hard to get is Moonkin gear. But I can't really help with that, I don't like ranged DDs.
---
Don't let that get into you, you can both play a mage everyone needs two mages.
---
What purpose does it serve to know all the BiS gear if it might never drop for you?
---
Aimed shot taking, leather or mail wearing, roll on everything cause i can equip almost anythaanngg.
---
Lay a trap, Then i send the pet in, take the brunt of the damage while i auto shot, collecting all the xps and drops.
---
While feign death lays in wait for the next stranger to appear and try a gank. BOOM. Scattershot to the face, while hes in a daze i make an escape, or just aimed shot his face.
---
Sorry, its more of a rap/rhyme then a sentence. Im bored :(
---
The biggest question you need to answer for yourself here is if you want to dps or heal. Thats a crucial difference between the classes and if you dont like one of them, you wont enjoy playing the class
---
I was exaggerating, but people say things in that ballpark all the time here. Most posts concerning private servers have these "DAE le private server bad xDDDDDD" types.
---
Hi, unsure if you saw my post elsewhere on this thread but I've just respecced from hemo to 19-32-0 and ground single lvl60 melee mobs for 5mins (continuously pulling). Equipped with blue gear I've gone from 365dps to 390dps. I didn't use AR but I didn't use CB either. Mob health was 3300, meaning it took 8.46 seconds to kill the mobs as combat, 9.04 seconds for hemo. Bladeflurry will give a slightly quicker 1-60 time but so will avoiding more wPVP. Nerfing myself by unequipping half of my gear and trying with 8/6/4/2 shadowcraft with empty slots gives similar 5-7% dps increases over hemo.
---
You actually unironically use tracking on your hunter, outside of PvP stuff?
---
Also, find treasure is super useless for Dwarf seeing as we have Gatherer to show us where all the treasure chest spawns are. I never use Find Treasure for anything other than in Strat to reveal which crates are real and which are fake.
---
Paladin. Or anything alliance.
---
Derp Thrall = best Thrall
---
You must be mistaken, I was never advocating for a hemo build. I'm saying leveling as combat swords, you should start off with garrote on mobs where it makes sense to. Meaning, if you have to spend 5 seconds in stealth to garrote, then don't do so and instead of just sinister strike. However if the mob is turned away and you can quickly jump + stealth + garrote in a second or so, go for it.
---
I’m down
---
there use to not be a limit, we use to run 40man deadmines just for the hell of it at release
---
Its for Interpersonal Communications 
---
Are you retarded? What purpose does it serve to do literally anything if it might not come to fruition? 
---
Joke all you want but people who started with cataclysm or later will have a shock when they’re 36 and there’s nobody telling them where to go to quest; and also they only have one blue, if they’re lucky.
---
Speaking from experience, if you play dps all the time but kind of itch to go for tank/heal, it usually doesnt end up well and you feel wrong while playing it. You will eventually go back to dps because it wont be fun. Of course this is my personal experience and yours could be different, but there is probably a reason you've played dps for the whole time.
---
I played shaman in vanilla, this is real
---
Is remorless attacks worth it? You use at least 5 Sinister strike for a mob and one of them does 20% more damage for 1 skill point. That is about 5% overall, less if you need more SS. Not bad, but also not must have asap worthy when there are talents like precision, sword specialization and adrenaline rush waiting. Same for relentless strikes. I´ll gladly take a free 25 energy per combat, but I would not postpone combat talents for that. 
---
Too bad !
---
Well, I guess the seal swap for optimal reckoning usage will differentiate better rets :D
---
Anyway, the reckoning speck looks very fun to play (even without the /sit trick), as people will get more and more crit% as the game progresses. It will make reckoning and Eye for an Eye stronger as days pass &lt;3
---
Oops I got lost in the thread, sorry! I agree though, garrote all the way.
---
I think there is a lot of potential for people to come back after quitting retail. I've raided competitively in Cata/Legion/BFA and even I'm quitting for classic.
---
Little egregious to say that retail players won't play past level X. I've gotten several friends who aren't competitive into a private server and we quickly picked up the game's rules. It's not a hard game at all and people will be able to pick it up, it's just a question of if they want more of a grind or not. Can't generalize all retail players like that.
---
Yeah, fuck mage, mages are dog shit, nobody should play mage at all whatsoever, I agree
---
(/s)
---
I recently got on retail to level to 10 so I could make a trolling alt, and I was just amazed at how badly the game holds your hand. They do almost everything for you for the quest. No reading necessary in the slightest. I'm actually surprised we can't just pay real money to boost our character to max level. OH WAIT!  
---
Needless to say I didn't even reach level 7.  
---
i WANT to believe in the classic wow reneissance that will shape the future  of the MMORPG  genre
---
Thanks man glad you liked it!
---
I just want to make sure that you are not misunderstanding what for example myself has written in other posts, in regards to Pservers often not being the most reliable source of information. Because that does not mean that I don't find any transferable knowledge, there is alot of transferable information.
---
That's not Classic though. You should throw your textbook away for having a screenshot of retail in it.  
---
Yup, I absolutely HATE playing Paladin. I doubt I'll ever create one honestly, even if I have every single other class leveled to 60.
---
Easy, it's Home.
---
I just don't like that there is now primary attack other than auto-attack. I don't know if there is a word for it but typically it is assigned to button 2. 
---
Has Recalled (the shaman 15min hearthstone, forget the name) instead of Rezzed on my Tauren Shaman during a dungeon once.  Going too fast and hit the wrong button.  Same animation and same cast time.
---
Do vs Know
---
This sounds about right, and is why druid is probably one of the top dueling classes, along with Soul Link warlock.
---
Don't forget Ring of Protection. Also armor isn't just "kind" of good for PVP druids, it's very good. In bear form, your armor is inflated like crazy.  
---
As a casual, I don't want any tanking or healing responsibilities this time around.
---
I just want to be a cat or a ghost wolf. Just DPS.
---
Lol its not like I play like that ;) I have 4 bars at the bottom and 3 on the right side. Very little clutter. I could probably have 1 bar at the bottom and the rest on autohide. There is not many cooldowns to keep track off.
---
I'm an alpha chad. What do you bench?
---
I cant wait for the first WC group where the tank rushes in, pulls 3 mobs and then is confused about why hes dead.
---
Eliiiiite!
---
Druid. I'll reroll Alliance and Paladin before I even consider making a Druid. 
---
I have not seen a single person try to argue that "there is no transferable knowledge between classic and private servers."  Literally no one.  I think you might be fighting a straw man, dawg.
---
[This is what we been through for years](https://imgur.com/a/yH7rn0E)
---
Go full feral and kill stuff faster. If you're expecting a lot of world pvp you could put 1 point into Nature's Grasp and maybe (big maybe) 5/5 Furor for more hybrid gameplay.
---
In groups don't worry about respeccing. Your talents aren't going to show a big impact until you hit the Nature's Swiftness tier and beyond. Respect the 5 Second Rule for mana regeneration and you should be good with int/spr gear.
---
OR....we're all here because we don't have a game to play.
---
They're not on reddit because they're playing BfA.
---
LOL
---
It gets worse: https://www.wowhead.com/spell=179244/summon-chauffeur
---
Not being satisfied with drawing a giant blue polygon around where you do the quest and making the quest mobs glowy blue, the game will even drive you right to the quest
---
I wonder how mods are going to change the experience. 
---
The old way is good enough for me. :)
---
One of the things I loved (and still do) about world of warcraft is the amount of fanart. I have never seen so much produced for any other MMO. 
---
Human hunter :thinking:
---
Yup its nice to see that unconditioned hype:)
---
Reminds me of [Joe Pera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etiyXJPkvyM)
---
I was kind of wondering what happens in a similar situation. If I Mc someone with a Gnomish mc hat can I hearth someone with me?
---
He gets a lot of hate around these parts, but I'll maintain the WW Axe quest chain walkthrough, Ony attument walkthrough, UBRS key walkthrough are some of my favorite bits of classic content anywhere.
---
Imo stoneskin is super underrated for leveling. If offers less damage taken for like half the DPS strength of Earth would give. I'm personally going imp stoneskin leveling up. 
---
Rofl my sense of humour didn’t suit Mad’s viewer base very much tho :-D
---

---
There is only few things worse in this world, than textbooks explaining online interactions in prejudice view.
---
U never wondered how I know week smokers so well huh:P
---
Even if leveling was significantly easier in wotlk,anyone who played before cata will know what to expect
---
i wish people would stop speaking poorly about bear druids because of early russian servers and feenix (with WOTLK damage values) giving them a bad name
---
crushing blow is a 15% chance to do 50% bonus damage. a 7.5% damage increase. considering healers try to heal assuming their crits wont happen in order to avoid overhealing, random healer crits more than compensate for this damage increase...
---
"but ur gonna die if u get 2 crushings or crits in a row lmaooooo"
---
watch this and observe how the dude never gets hit for more than a sliver of his health even with crushings/crits. for reference, he has around 14k hp. walking into naxx, a druid can have 17k+. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alH2QXm8MM8&amp;t=26s
---
also notice that hes using a meme trinket and t2.5 instead of more useful gear (which is easily obtainable) so hes missing a great deal of tanking stats. lets not also mention the fact that he dusts people on threat generation (his guild cleared KT, which means literal BIS dps) without even having a DFT
---
Sounds good :-D
---
There's a really odd "us vs them" mentality with this game. On the one hand you have people who are inexplicably upset that a server option they have zero interest in playing on is going to exist. On the other hand you have people who preach how important a solid community is while simultaneously attempting to gatekeep that community and push away "the wrong sort of people".
---
It's quite bizarre. I don't know why people can't just agree that they are essentially different games that appeal to different demographics. Getting mad at each other for liking one over the other is completely asinine.
---
Most knowledgeable players know secondary or tertiary BiS items for every tier. If you grind enough, you're bound to get them eventually.
---
When does Megaman X-Series gets a HD-Remake?
---
Follow up with Phantom Blade and Trash Blade. 
---
im an orc actually
---
This subreddit is filled with losers who hate retail more than they like Classic.
---
The thing about pvp servers is that 10% of the pvp is good well balanced battles, and 90% is ganking. Yes it feels good to teach some world pvp hero a lesson when they jump you but in the end you realize you're behind on the farming/questing for having participated. Honestly, it varies by class too. As a healer all of your fights take minutes regardless of how bad they are so that also reduces the fun if there's no reward in the end. 
---
PvP servers made a ton of sense at launch because BGs didn't exist. However, over all the time I've played wow all the memorable pvp moments for me happened in BGs, arena, or fair open world fights (essentially a spontaneous duel).
---
I tried this. It won’t work. It treats you as the player who Mc you. Hunter pets and demons can’t go through portals because they are tied to your chars faction. 
---
Interesting site. I was able to see when I first started playing and last quit! 2010 :D
---
I saw it as more tragic, like finally the cruel ruling class is getting a taste of their own medicine and the poor and downtrodden get a little revenge but then, well, classic comes out..
---
That's why they got him to play as Pope Francis in that Netflix thing.
---
Yeah, but I get a feeling that back in the day, a lot of peoples UI looked like that. HAHA
---
You can macro totem sequences to one key.  So press it once you get Windfury, next you get strength of earth, press it a third time and get mana totem.  The macro will check if you’re buffed by that totem before casting the next.  Pretty useful in raid/ 5 man situations where you’re placing the same totems down after every pull.
---
If PvP is your main concern, then I do have a couple notes to make. 
---
&gt;**Warlock:** If I go Horde, I'll feel like an asshole for not playing an Orc. 
---
When it comes to PvP, all you really want is to go Horde as a warlock. It doesn't matter if you go Orc or UD that much, as you will always have an upper edge over equally skilled and geared warlock on the Alliance. It is either an advantage against rogues or warlocks, mainly. Now, orcs' hardiness probably has more uses, but isn't to be relied upon. You can be lucky, or, well, not lucky. UD are not like that. Both races are very good and there is not a general answer to which of the races is better for a warlock. Most skilled warlocks I know are UD anyway...
---
&gt;**Hunter:**  with Orcs being OP on Horde side /  Nelfs are better, at least Dwarves  are competitive. 
---
I am going to be honest with you and agree that Orcs are indeed the master race for hunters in PvP. As a hunter in PvP, your upmost attention should go to keeping your distance. Yet sometimes, your enemy throws a grenade at you, or perhaps they get a charge off (that shouldn't happen tho), or perhaps they are rogue and they open on you. Orc take care of that from time to time, and it feels godlike when it happens. The other 2 races on Horde don't provide much for this, tbh. Trolls have berserking, which doesn't have a big impact on your burst damage and doesn't help you keep your distance at all. Tauren can be hit from 7 yards away instead of the common 5, making them the worst race for a PvP hunter.
---
About alliance choices, I'd actually say night elves are not better. Shadowmeld does have a lot of clever uses and a skilled player can really do wonders (as well as save a lot of unwanted WPvP), but all the other benefits of nelves are rather minor. As a dwarf, you have stoneskin, which is amazing for PvP. It takes care of rogues and shadow priests. Long story short, stoneskin makes up more than enough for all the things nelves can provide, making them equally strong (if not stronger) as nelves.
---
I agree with you. But in my opinion they are better than pallys in terms of leveling speed. Still pretty bad though.
---
What is GNPPs? Good call on the burnout, happened with BFA for me recently. I think a few alts will help me with that.
---
You can MC people out of a BG, so they are kicked out with the 15min deserter buff. 
---
I don't know about you but even when it comes out, I'll have Classic on one screen and /r/classicwow, youtube/spotify/netflix up on the other monitor. 
---
Wait, how? MC and use /afk?
---
Damn, such a shame.
---
Lock?
---
I'm sorry to hear that, sucks bad.  Warlock will melt faces but it's got a very high skill ceiling in PVP due to the outrageous number of tools they have (of varying usefulness). In raids, prepare to cast shadowbolt and then fall asleep on your keyboard. Shaman is a solid choice too but very jack of all tradesy. You'll be healing in raids but in PVP you are a bit more flexible because of potential burst damage.  You have good mobility and can heal on the run decently and also a decent amount of offensive tools to help control PVP encounters. 
---
What you CAN do is to MC people out of the exit portals in BGs. Assuming classic doesn’t put invisible walls like on most pservers.
---
I’ve heard whispers of “Holy damage” stacking from a bunch of priests and pallies.
---
Its ok, since i like cat and nothing really stops me from casting spells out of cat, then just won't hit as hard.
---
Mainly i just want to have fun and be useful in situations that require it.
---
Thank you for the link.
---
Yeah I used to try and abuse the /sit macro but I don't bother except in really cheeky 1v1s.  In regular PVP you will still get crit plenty.  You often can get crit from really low damage abilities too like frost nova, arcane explosion, or hamstring.  Those are always nice =P
---
Eye for an eye is one of my favorite talents- it's a top tier defensive ability vs casters especially if you can use LOS to heal yourself.  Crit me for 2k frostbolt?  no thanks- I'ma go heal myself around this corner and you just lost 1/4 of your hp as well.  I've definitely seen people suicide due to it but this generally only happens when I massively outgear them and get some lucky resists or something.  Really funny to see a crappy frost mage get whittled down while I heal myself repeatedly
---
I think it's from the quests that are involved in becoming an armorsmith, so I don't know if you can complete it and then just not become an armorsmith.  
---
I've also read someone say it can't be used to break fear once you are already feared, and I think there is a delay (30 seconds) after you equip a trinket before you can use it if you are going to switch it on and off.   
---
I'm not an expert myself, played back in the day but never Pservers, so this is mostly based on reading, I might be mistaken.  
---
Still, I'm thinking I will go blacksmithing on my hunter, as this trinket seems well worth it for pvp unless you need your second profession (besides engineering) to be a gathering Profession (not sure why, hunter is so good for farming DM tribute or other spots) or are going to be able to make mad bank being the first to control a specific market with a specific crafting prof, which is probably almost none of us.
---
I disagree, I think enhance has the more predictable and controllable burst. Between shocks and SS, both of which hit as or harder than Ret’s judgment. Enhance also has some very nice survivability between grounding, earth bind, and poison cleansing.

I actually found this video https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq3j86dJfW4 that shows the MC trick I mentioned in my post.

It is Wrath though.

You don't really know what you're talking about, do you? What you linked is a heirloom mount you can drive from level 1, it doesn't take you anywhere automatically or anything like that.
---
Also, "drawing a giant blue polygon around where you do the quest and making the quest mobs glowy blue" all started with addons like QuestHelper, and since everyone was using them, Blizzard implemented them in the main game. Like with most casualizations, you can only blame the players.

It doesn’t drive for you.  It is an early level mount if you have the heirlooms collected.

My concern was that if my buddy and I wanted to hop into instances that we'd have problems. We're not twinked, and I read that while it is possible to heal dungeons as feral spec, it isn't easy or ideal. 
---
please tell me this is your hud
---
It'll change when the game actually comes out, hopefully. A good chunk of the private server community is just insane and why I refuse to play on those servers. 
---
Yeah you're not wrong.  If you know you have reck stacks, it's just as easy to use as pressing stormstrike or shocks.  Judgment isn't as much damage as a shock, and a great cooldown.  
---
I played a lot of enh sham on a private server- if you go up against an equally geared rogue or warrior you are toast.  You can't get away, and you can't outheal their damage so you can only hope to burst.  I can rarely get a warrior down by very limited earthbind kiting, fire nova, and a lucky WF / crit.  Otherwise the warr just hits too hard. 
---
Rogues are worse, really no chance if they have cooldowns.  
---
Enhance can survive well vs casters, between grounding and earth shock to interrupt, or frost shock to chase and keep them locked down.  Paladins have a bit of a tougher time vs casters.  But I think paladins have the easier time vs their tough matchups (except mages.. fuck mages) than shaman do vs their tough matchups. 
---
don't eve say that...
---
I guess the slow from frost armor and not having to refresh could be debatable if its a worthy tradeoff for 800+ armor, but 15 hp per 5 seconds? xD Id take inner fire any day even if I have to reapply it.

---
Frigging Swimming pool DLC. This shout have been part of core game like it was in Sims 4.
---
Let's not even start with swbf2 and that failure of a mess.
---
As other's have also stated, Classic is being made by a small team on a small budget. There is no marketing budget at this time.
---
I'm sure this will ramp up nearing release, but nowhere near the scale of a front line game release. I am sure that Blizzard will rely heavily on work of mouth and the fact they KNOW that a ton of streamers will be moving to Classic. Yes, they totally rely on this form of free advertising.
---
One must consider that major game media promotion is expensive as hell. If a game budget is 100 million, they spend 50-100 million on advertising for it as well. Same with movies. Double the production cost and you usually are close to the total production+marketing.
---
Classic won't have much spent on it. It won't need it as well due to an already confirmed and dedicated audience moving to it.
---
The only relevant answer to any thread here is "shut up and wait". So much pointless drama and speculation.
---
Good one. Guild with such people wouldn't recruit on reddit ffs. 
---
The missing boots always pissed me off.

WoW expacs die in 3 months after release.

My RL Wow buddy died a few years back too. Took me and some others years to start playing games we used to play together.

---
You just MC them near the exit portal of the BG and direct them out.  
---
Maybe you're thinking surefooted in TBC Vs speed enchant.
---
I very explicitly suggest we all just have a good time.
---
Stoneskin Totem is one of the most important spells a Shaman has while leveling, esp in Vanilla. It is sooooo underrated it's not even funny. I recommend using it on nearly every mob you fight while leveling! The quite noticeable difference it makes, esp over time, is tremendous and can't be stated enough. Strength of Earth is unnoticeable while questing and only good for dungeons/endgame. 
---
As far as PVE goes, mage is excellent damage while warlock starts out slow and ramps up with later raid gear (due to lack of +hit talents).
---
Here's some deep dive comparisons to help the choice:

The realm is undecided right now but it will def be a PvP server

so which classes uses fewer buttons? like actually uses
---
Mounts from level 1?!
---
***Flips over table and leaves***
---
Thanks for the assurance. I actually holding off on strength of Earth completely til I get my mount, too much random damage in early instances.
---
Very good points here!! Thanks :)
---
This is so true. I've played every expac hoping for a good game or vanilla-like gameplay only to be disappointed and quit in 1-2 months every singe time.
---
Fraaaastshaaaaaaaaack!
---
I think it goes both ways. I much prefer the immersion of VC and the Defias brotherhood to basically all of Legion's storyline. That being said, I also like to see my character do powerful things like take down a Fire God or completely destroy an evil dragonflight. I want characterization but also to see progress and strength. It requires a balance and going too far in one direction makes it feel incomplete. When we get 40 people together to raid a stronghold, it better not be some random human. On the other side, if I get 5 people together to clear a dungeon I don't think it's particularly accurate to be killing something on the scale of a titan or an elemental.
---
Show me
---
Flip a coin. You will know when the coin is midair which you want it to land on. Pick that one. If you don’t care pick whichever the coin lands on.
---
I dont know about that either. Paladins may have lower damage while leveling, but they have practically zero downtime once they get Seal of Wisdom (to judge), and they have excellent tools to deal with multiple mobs at once.
---
Rogue or Shaman
---
Someone just came from the overwatch subreddit...
---
There's still friction, battlegrounds, and the ability to flag yourself for PVP though.
---
Na, he's more of a reddit guy and one of the top contributors over at /r/dankchristianmemes
---
From what I can tell, I think it stems from some pro-classic players still being bitter about being told they would never get what they want.
---
Though some of them are just assholes naturally.
---
Moving in general constantly is a good thing, but what the guy in the video was doing was just weird. I QE spam a bit between globals, mostly out of boredom and being used to high APM specs. 
---
I’m talking about the highest skill level of play. Wars are better than pallys if the player is hamstring kiting mobs and using spirit gear to regen hp. 
---
Wars can also kill two mobs when sweeping strikes is up. The only thing pally is better at than a war is surviving bad pulls.
---
But if we are talking about high skill players, a war will put level a pally, there is a lot Wars can do if a player is good.
---
Once you get level 40 warrior leveling is really easy actually. Very low downtime and you can easily kill 2 mobs at a time with sweeping strikes.
---
It just sucks a lot 1-20 so lots of noobs think warriors are hard to level
---
Every class can hit 60 in a week. But you better take time off work and stock up on redbull and cocaine.
---
That's a human hunter with the newer racial backgrounds, and you think that's from classic?
---
Though to be fair, you can only get it if you have bought a LOT of the heirlooms, which means you at least already have a max level character.
---
It probably doesn't make you feel better, but the leveling experience in Retail that doesn't have to do with the newest Xpac is the last thing that Blizz cares about.
---
Would you recommend a ret/holy spec? Or just go either reck/holy or reck/ret?
---
I see myself playing alot of Bg's and mostly healing, but also dealing damage when I can get a chance
---
Gotta be a paladin. You could wash the car while you autoattack things.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhtNA-ezimE druid tanking nef
---
Yup. My first char was Alliance because I was literally 12. We all play Horde nowadays 
---
Yeah get wonderdraft 
---
In my current guild on live, we have 5 guys and gals under 18 
---
One of which is 13 and had been in the guild since he was ten. 
---
2 of them only come for heroic and normal runs and they are a good bit of fun to have along. 
---
And 3 are apart of our core mythic team and they are mechanically noticably faster and quicker to react then say our oldest member who is in his late 50s 
---
The only issue i have had is having to have talks with certain guild members about what appropriate conversation with the younger members of the guild. 
---
Come classic if you are a nice person with resonable communication skills and can show up on time, i dont think age will matter for me and guild. 
---
No one says this.
---
I was 9 when WoW came out. Watched my brother play until I got a computer for Christmas the next year. So started playing at 10. 
---
I never hit max during Vanilla. Got to level 51 just before BC came out. I was an altoholic that didn’t know how to level at all. Still don’t ;)
---
Personally I've got kind of tired of Reck specs because most of your damage is dependent on having reck stacks.  It's kind of boring sometimes, if you aren't being attacked you're somewhat of a wet noodle. 
---
In a separate thread I talked about 21/0/30 as you become a capable 5-man or raid healer simply by having illumination + divine favor (gear dependent of course).  Look through my comment history for the past day or two, you'll see a couple longer comments about it.  
---
Getting full vengeance with 21/0/30 can be really great once you get a decent amount of +crit on your gear.  If you're rocking around a 25% crit chance, vengeance will be up constantly and your melee crits will likely be 1000+.  That is serious business.  But good luck farming a bunch of plate DPS raid gear as a ret =P  Perhaps your guild will let you get priority alongside the warrior tanks (offspec rolls) as your DPS warriors should definitely have top dibs on any of the great plate gear like Onslaught Girdle or breastplate of annhilation for example. 
---
As far as BGs, IMO holy/reck is the strongest spec.  You are a very capable healer, can soak a lot of damage and then obliterate clothies.  It's a bit of a tricky play style, and the easiest way to neutralize you is to spam CC on you and prevent you from helping others.  On your own you're a total one-trick pony.  You also are terrible at soloing since you can't abuse /sit on Classic servers so good luck killing anything =P  On private server its a joke to farm as reck because you can /sit in between weapon swings and get constant reck stacks. 
---
It also helps who’s forming the guild and if everyone’s on the same page. Having almost 20 RL friends and all of us OK with meme specs and how progress will be really helps. It’s all about communication
---
&gt;but you will also need a large group of other players farming herbs (**specifically black lotus**) to make the hundreds of consumables needed to pull it off and given that p-servers have vastly increased spawn rates and spawn densities of herbs compared to vanilla I dont think it'll happen.
---
You do realize that flasks can only be made once you obtain a 1% drop recipe from UBRS and Scholomance right?
---
MC isnt nearly hard enough that you need this. The only requirement is getting 40 players together that arent completely braindead and can follow orders with some basic consumes such as Greater Fire Protection and Restoration potions. As long as your members dont mind a 5-7 hour MC clear, which let's be honest, nobody will mind in week 2, you are good.
---
Ele is love, Ele is life.
---
If only there was a bunch of spells n ranged skills available to a shaman that they could spec around, instead of glorofied auto attacking...
---
...like spells and lightning and stuff.  Ah well. 
---
Thats true, but the sac shield protects you from spell pushback so it can help you get a fear off and turn the fight. Much more important than a few voidwalker hits.
---
It certainly sounds that way but you need to look at when this is actually reasonably going to happen.
---
    Druid: if they forget about their Faerie Fire/Moonfire/Insect Swarm abilities
---
    Hunter: if they're bad and don't Flare/Volley your Vanish. Hunter's mark/Pet aggro will prevent restealth escapes
---
    Mage: no effect (Fireball/ArcaneExploision/Nova/Cone/Blizzard keeping you out of stealth)
---
    Paladin: no effect (restealth super easy)
---
    Priest: no effect (SW:Pain keeping you out of stealth, devouring plague removal is nice though [not that it can't be removed any other way])
---
    Rogue: if they're bleeding instead of stunlocking (and you want to save for blind anyways)
---
    Shaman: no effect (Totems/Flame Shock keeping you out of stealth)
---
    Warlock: no effect (Corruption/Curse of Agony keeping you out of stealth)
---
    Warrior: niche usage on Deep Wounds/Rend. Easy to restealth in deadzone regardless of DoTs and instantly open. Demoralizing Shout counterplay unaffected.
---
DoTs don't *literally* stop your vanish/restealth they stop a single use of it (a defensive vanish which is mostly used to run away). You can still instantly use an opener out of stealth/vanish (use it offensively). Stoneform for vanish/stealth is useful against: bad druids, bad hunters, bad rogues who are bleeding instead of stunlocking you, and to run away from a warrior (your best match up).
---
Basically, its really good for blind and removing devouring plague. Meanwhile gnome is impactful vs. actually difficult match ups (druid+mage), is good for your sanity and cooldowns (RNG insurance vs. frostbite and imp. hamstring), and has niche uses vs. almost every class (pally xd). [WITH A THIRD OF THE COOLDOWN LENGTH] 
---
I reckon two druids, a hunter and a warlock will keep me busy. But probably rogue. It's the only class I've never levelled in any expac.
---
Alright, I'm dumb... what does retail vs classic mean? I've seen it use a lot in this sub. Does retail just mean wow in it's current state? Like BfD?
---
http://www.warcraftrealms.com/charsheet/33741050 
---
Looks like about 5 months of I’m reading this correctly. Prozac, 60 Hunter, Altar of Storms. Such good times. 14 years old, 9th grade, raided all night and slept through 1st period algebra, ended up failing and having to take summer classes. 
---
Used to just auto attack in MC while watching TV. Eventually got yelled at because damage meters were created 😂. Got the sinew in MC as well but was too young and inexperienced to actually complete the quest. I’d refuse to corpse run often and eventually got booted after we couldn’t down Alexstrasza in BWL and I probably did less damage than the tank. 
---
Such simple, ignorant times. No BiS lists. Raiding in greens. Purely auto attacking and sending my pet to die constantly on bosses. 
---
That’s another reason why I’m so excited for classic. I only got to the 2nd boss in BWL. Never even did ZG. I no lifed the game and still only beat MC. There’s so much left for me to do in Classic this time around. 
---
I personally love that all the classes aren't the same.
---
Retail is all about endgame, leveling is more like a chore, so it really doesn't change much, and you have to have 35 heirlooms to get it. I agree that it would be horrible in vanilla, but in retail it doesn't matter at all.
---
I just want to play a game that I have fond memories of. Private servers just aren't the same. 
---
Panel is accurate
---
You misspelled "sky-laser chicken"
---
Yes BFA = Retail
---
They're not forced to spec Resto by any means. Much of it depends on what you want to do. PvP? Feral/Resto (0/30/21) is extremely powerful and popular. Dungeons? Spec 11/33/7 and tank it up. You'll be rolling in groups. It's only really raiding where Druids were expected to heal, but that idea is changing as time goes on. Ferals can actually off-tank or even main-tank very well, and some guilds on private servers are now seeing having a Feral tank as part of their tanking roster as meta. You *can* go cat dps in raids but frankly I'd advise against it. Not because you can't do good damage (you can) but because their rotation is by far the most challenging in the game, involving powershifting in and out of cat form with precise timing to maximise energy regeneration, and the item you need, Manual Crowd Pummellers, will drive you to madness farming them from Gnomeregan. Even Balance is starting to see usage in the raiding scene, but in a similar way to cat, you have to go full try-hard to have a chance of respectable DPS. 
---
The flexibility with specs and roles basically comes down to the fact that when a guild takes a Druid on a raid what they're really after is Innervate, a battle res, and Mark of the Wild. Everything else is gravy. They basically won't really care much what you spec, so long as you bring that. Sure, some will tell you to heal and that's fine, it's part of your kit. But since it's typically harder for a guild to find tanks than it is to find healers, the ability to switch into an off-tank role that takes advantage of gear no-one else wants is very attractive. 
---
Lastly, the res issue you raise is absolutely a big thing. There's no way around it, and it means it's more difficult for us to be the only healer in a dungeon group. In PvP or raiding of course, it's a non-issue. 
---
90% of these people have done it this several times recently on private realms, that’s where all the hate is from 
---
But as druid you can BE a pet bear
---
&gt;using spirit gear to regen hp
---
I am aware that Warriors have a higher health regen to spirit ratio than other classes, but this idea that spirit stacking is somehow a viable way to level a Warrior was always just a meme. The effect is pretty much negligible in the long term, and carrying around an extra gear set of gear with spirit that you need to collect and maintain while leveling is not practical at all.
---
Yes, hamstring kiting can significantly improve your leveling speed by reducing downtime, but the same basic problem remains, which is that you have no self healing capabilities or any utility to deal with anything that may happen, which means no matter what, Warriors will always be the slowest class to level up when you dont have a main to feed you gear, such as is the case on a fresh server.
---
I use healbot add on currently in BFA and can’t imagine healing without it. It brings frames up and lets you easily make macros. Ex. Shift+lift click on a frame for me casts vivify. It allows you to change healing targets seamlessly.
---
But as a rogue, you pick up the habit from front-stabbing everything. It becomes something you do unconsciously.
---
&gt;Some just want to see retail fail. The latter are toxic.
---
I'm sure there was no biased intension with your comment...
---
But, 'some' also want to see classic fail. They are also toxic. 
---
I am with you with the time passing. My first day playing I played I played for 13 straight hours then slept for about 6 and woke up and played for 18 hours. It isn't still like that but I still use it to pass the time and have fun. It just isn't as immersive as it once was. 
---
It's not as big a deal as the tryhards make it out to be. Play the race you gravitate towards the most. I'll be proudly rolling a Dwarf Warrior :-)
---
How necessary is the human racials if I want to tank in raids to hold threat? (The sword/mace specialization). I plan on PVPing which I know humans aren't so great at and would want to go gnome for escape artist, I plan on focusing on both PVP and PVE but feel like no matter what I choose I end up being disadvantaged heavily in one aspect or the other. 
---
I love the undead start zones so much.
---
Being 15 when wow launched my initial forays into Warcraft we’re heavily wc3 centric. Obviously the visual of the skybox, the music, the enemies (skeletal mages/warriors) and the abominations just make it so unique compared to everyone else.
---
Agamand mills and my first spelunk down that tomb will always be a cherished moment. 
---
Sweet memories. 
---
Played around a little with every class during the WoW Classic Demo. Was expecting to not like Warrior, but my least favorite by far was Rogue. Stealth is nice, but I just hate how Rogue feels to play. 
---
Definitely won't be playing Rogue in Classic.
---
There’s also a Private server community vs people who haven’t played since classic retail.  
---
As someone who really enjoys the grind in old school runescape, this is totally relatable! Grinding may have been a pain at times, but the sense of progress was real...and dinging a level just felt so good!
---
This sums up the next few years of my life
---
I am still on the fence about Quest Helper. I really want to create an experience....though i had quest helper from day one because i started late and a friend set up all of my addons.
---
So i don't know which experience i want. Something that a fresh player would have done back in the day or the experience i actually had. 
---
Agreed, I believe NELF is better in PVE but for PVP it's pretty close and arguable which is better, both have their strengths. I think a Dwarf Hunter would be a fine choice where you wouldn't be disadvantaged in PVP (besides orc being better) and could still enjoy the look of your char. 
---
Very cool site, gold buying ads aside.  I was a serious alt-aholic, and it took me until the end of 2017 to get a “main” to 60.  According to this, it was Christmas 2017!  Took nearly four whole months real time.
---
I just find it ironic that WoW was designed from the outset to be a casual MMO, and now people are saying retail players won't stick with it because they're too casual. 
---
I think it’s unlikely because there’s no upfront cost anyway, and every person who subs to try out Classic also gets a sub to retail which people are sure to try out if they don’t like classic.
---
Rogue and Mage pop is pretty even on private servers.  Usually there's more rogues on fresh server launches but mages catch up eventually as people roll alts
---
Somehow I don't see this being a problem considering the massive amount of information at peoples fingertips today. Anyone could literately look up a leveling guide, much like what people did in the past with Allakhazam.
---
Grinding can be decent xp and certainly is a great gold earner.
---
Efficiency just depends on the class you play.
---
As a side note, you should do more of these! This is awesome.
---
Never felt that way when I played a rogue. I always felt like their was plenty of room for me. In anything I wanted to do. Is it possible the demand is just high enough that I thought the pop was lower then it was for that reason? Because I never really felt playing my rogue their were way too many of us. Getting a raid spot was always easy.
---
I know that warriors generate rage by getting hit and also doing damage/crits.  I thought I read somewhere that druids only generate rage offensively.  If that is correct then a PW:Shield should be ok for a druid, but only if that is correct.
---
Funnily enough a lot of people who want TBC servers are getting this from Vanilla fans. Sucks that now they are getting their favorite server that they want to pull the ladder up.
---
Man, as much as I love Rogue, it's so bad for leveling. No healing. Many Elites are immune to poisons and Kidney Shot.
---
Back in the days before any self healing, Rogue was brutal. People are about to learn that.
---
I've actually never considered naming a toon to honor my friend (and damnit, it's always the good ones who leave us early). It may be time to do that when Classic hits. He had a list of usual names he used. 
---
In my opinion you won't get the true vanilla experience unless you're playing on a PvP realm
---
I really couldn't play shaman. Too many binds for me, and I play warlock. I'd have to find room for r1 frost shock, earth shock, lightning bolt, and searing totem in addition to everything else. 1-2 ranks of chain, HW, LHW and all totems &amp; consumes. 
---
That Call of Elements addon looks like it would be a lifesaver. 
---
I'm changing factions but my friends aren't.  So that's a bummer.
---
This isn't right. Hell, it isn't even wrong.
---
Not only do I always level cooking and fishing, this time around my wife is playing mage. My paladin will be well fed and full of mana 
---
BUYING gear?!?
---
***flips over table and leaves again***
---
Was a rogue in Vanilla and TBC and was going to re-roll rogue for classic, but I’ve seen a lot posts recently that rogue = worse warrior for raids and BGs (not to mention difficult to gear).
---
Any reason to still go rogue - especially on PVE server?
---
Spot on mate! 
---
Gather or buy 4 stacks of linen cloth (40 cloth), grab tailoring and then craft bolts of linen cloth. This will bring your skill to 30 and you can then learn Brown Linen Robe. Use the bolts you just made to craft 9 Robes and then disenchant them. This will bring your enchanting skill to 10 and you can then learn to make a lesser magic wand.
---
You should get at least one lesser magic essence from the disenchants, but if not you can either keep making robes ( 6 linen cloth and one coarse thread each) until you get one or you can buy one from the vendor or AH if available. Also, if you're the first on the server to get to the enchanting vendor he / she sells x1 lesser magic essence. 
---
I took this from another thread bit the user no longer exists so I can't give credit.
---
Hope this helps mate.
---
Lol I love you dude that is awesome 
---
It was on the edge of Loch Modan, not Dun Morogh.
---
Hunters end up not being too bad. Every single melee attack can be put into a one button macro. Pet commands don't share your own GCD so commands can be baked into abilities and/or multiple pet support abilities can be combined into 1 button macros.
---
Your primary pet control, auto attack, base melee attacks or just wingclip can be put into a 1 button macro. Aspects can be toggled into 1 button macros by logical choice.
---
You can literally half your keybinds through macros as a hunter. Macros are a powerful tool of a hunter to specialize game play per build. Don't overdue it for pvp however as you don't want to limit your strategies too much.
---
I feel like game of thrones is a pop culture phenomenon on equal scale to lord of the rings back in the early 2000s it's interesting how the timing of all this plays out.
---
&gt;What encounters do you think can't be cleared by a single well-balanced 40-toon raid with no hybrids?
---
All encounters can be beat with a 40-man raid with or without hybrids, that's my point.  "The raid is greater than the sum of its parts", or you bring those that lend to your success the most, meaning being skilled, not just putting up big numbers.  Most encounters are made up of mechanics first, numbers second (obviously there are some notable exceptions), so progression has far more to do with "Don't stand in the fire" than do big damage. So, in this case, I want the person that contribute to keeping folks alive, keeping others alive and be willing to swap roles if we fall short an attempt.
---
Think about it like this, you only needed 7 healers all raid, but you get to a particularly different encounter that needs approximately an extra 1/2 a healer for your MT or whatever. That wildcard can put on their healing set and get to work.  But, what this means it that you have to have more trust in that individual than most others in your raid.  These spots that we give to a select few (2 to 3 max), we let play in these hybrid roles.
---
We currently have a Retribution Paladin and Shadow Priest (Both our formerly top healers), and when we need to tap them for certain encounters, they're more than happy to oblige and we can count on them.  Contrary to this, you could bring a full healer, but honestly it'd be a waste because we really would rather have someone doing damage, not sitting there casting heals that turn into overhealing.
---
As for the Retribution Paladin, he's specced something akin to 21/0/30 which is 99% of the spec to be an effective healer, but have the necessary PvE talents while keeping Nightfall up (2 chances to apply per swing depending on the Seal used).
---
So all in all:
---
Doing progression? Don't be bad, stop dying in the fire, we don't care about your numbers.
---
Doing farm? Use minimum required healers, but be flexible in case you need them.
---
I recently took a skinning knife with +55 healing 1-60.
---
I am aware of the drop rate of the flasks and the requirements to craft them. I am also aware that 2 weeks is not sufficient time to get your pre-raid BiS (which are mostly sub 10% drops themselves if I recall) which is why the consumables are necessary. Not just the fire and restoration pots but also all the elixirs that stack to the moon and back to make up for the lack of BiS
---
Wait why cant taurens use undead mounts?
---
False man, you're an idgit. Keep a nice 2h, Bandaids, alch hp pots, and up to date food and your grinding speed is very fast. Only problem is lack of move speed. But enchant boots with mspeed and you're grooving.
---
But i guess the brainlet retard casual hivemind disagrees so whatever. I've levelled to 60 lots of times on lots of classes, warrior the most. Keep being shit and enjoy your tiny brain. 
---
False again man, there's tons of great weps to keep you going until lvl 30 with ww axe, then lots more. Stop spouting nonsense, you're clearly a shitter
---
A work of art, truly magnificent! I applaud your work 
---
A lot of people in this thread are using the world record for solo leveling as a benchmark, but there are a multitude of ways to speed up progression if you are part of a team. Easy example: The item turn in quest line in Badlands. Frost Oil, Gyro, etc. Unless you can snap the items off the AH, it just is not worth doing. However if a team of 3 people did NOT get to 60 ASAP and instead opted to detour into the needed professions and farm the mats for 40 other people, that is a huge free XP boost for all 40 of those people. Raid guilds are rarely just 40 people and even then they usually aren't all the same level of no sleep, no life. This is legit something the other people in a guild could do to help the racers. 
---
Another thing is instances. Normally the major downside to instance questing is the time sink of getting the group together and then the risk of failure. In a dedicated large group of people, neither of these should be an issue. There are no well practiced, researched routes based around the idea of an entire guild speed leveling together (though I know that research is happening literally right now) but you can level faster if you do instances and avoid those two major timesinks. Not just because of the XP/hour being comparable or even greater, but the gear rewards speed up everything else. Every wand user in a guild should get run through BFD, for instance. 
---
Back to our farming team that isn't rushing to 60. They could be making gold off of other people after doing the materials for the rest of the guild, everyone is going to want those Frost Oils, Gyros, etc. What is gold good for? What if every single person in your entire speed leveling enterprise had enough gold right at 40 for mount? Doable, very doable. 
---
Those are just optimizations that'll save a few hours, maybe as many as ~25 hours, averaged over the raid. It might actually be a time loss for Hunters, Druids, etc., but it'll be a time save for the raid as a whole, speeding up Warriors, Warlocks, Mages, Priests, etc., in terms of their leveling speed. However the BIG issue is none of those. If you want to clear MC week 2 you need Quintessence. At some point a group of people is going to wander down to Silithus, around level 54 IIRC, and grind elemental mobs for a loooong time. This will decrease their leveling speed by quite a bit, but if the 5 people in the front of the pack do it together you're really just giving everyone else a chance to catch up. It doesn't have to be a full 5, you could do it with 3 or even 1 person could do it on their own, just get some Warlocks up, walk them out to Azshara, and summon that one guy back and forth. But it must be done, can't kill Rag without it, and it is actually the biggest bottleneck a guild needs to plan around.
---
The thing actually making me the most hype is the journey from 1-60. I'm sure the end game will be fine too, but I NEED the old school RPG style that Vanilla brings. I too miss the joy of leveling up and unlocking new talents and such. Also, can't wait for the open world PvP shenanigans during the entire process. 
---
God I hope classic is good..
---
&gt;You don't really know what you're talking about, do you?
---
Lol. That sentence sums up a lot of this subs' arguments. It's horrible how anyone who is curious about classic wow and stumbles upon this sub will likely get horribly misleading information. 
---
&gt;Also, "drawing a giant blue polygon around where you do the quest and making the quest mobs glowy blue" all started with addons like QuestHelper, and since everyone was using them, Blizzard implemented them in the main game. Like with most casualizations, you can only blame the players.
---
I almost guarantee majority of the people who are playing on pservers right now are either using a quest tracker add-on or following a guide for "maximum efficiency". It's the same thing, but doesn't stop the baseless hateful remarks.   
---
Good luck trying to aoe grind uncontested. Most people know what spots are good for aoe grinding and they will always be packed.
---
Everyone should be able to play and enjoy any version of WoW that they want.
---
I'm partial to Vanilla and TBC, but I also had some fun times in Wotlk, Cata and MoP. I've played every expansion so I can see where people are coming from when they like a certain aspect of one expansion for example.
---
Looking forward to the TBC servers if they make one as well!
---
It just dawned on me that this is all one giant joke by Blizzard.  
---
my vanilla experience, from the beginning,  WAS PVE. And I loved it.  the few hours I spent on a PvP server was annoying. But there were other factors in that.  point is, I'm willing to give it a shot, but I am wary of devoting too much to a PVP server, especially if it turns out my server is overwhelmingly the other faction. 
---
Because of content droughts and people realizing blizzard dropped the ball again
---
Sure hope so! I have a bunch of buddies that I’ve got playing overwatch. If handled very carefully I believe I could get them to try classic wow as well and this would be a big help. 
---
Has anyone heard of someone trying out classic wow, giving it a good shot, and NOT getting hooked? That’s my primary concern at this point just not sure if that is even possible
---
Well with Deadmines, it’s alliance territory, not contested.
---
yup
---
I'd love to see a 'classic expansion' that doesnt necessarily invalidate the work you put into Classic. No level cap. Maybe bring in TBC systems like sockets.
---
On rp servers you only flag when you want. 
---
Some premades prefer having their hunter(s) mid for ranged damage against squishies and more importantly viper stings. Whereas rogues are only really decent at guarding the flag room or going for the enemy flag carrier in stealth. It really depends on the individual premade what comp they play and how they prefer playing it.
---
But in contrast, Horde get a better city dungeon, RFC, while Stockades blows. Also, SFK and Scarlet Monestaty are all way easier to get to as horde. Not to mention Horde has much easier access to AQ and Naxx, Scholo and Strath. Also 2 travel points in STV.
---
Yeah when you coddle new players, for example buying them stuff, they usually lose interest. In my experience.
---
Probably mage.
---
lol windfury doesnt have keybind. noob clicker
---
/s
---
Alterac valley
---
1. it's gonna be as cheap as around 400g if you get someone to do the summoning
---
2. intensive in the sense its a pet class with a high skill ceiling
---
3. the closest to an affli raiding spec would be SM/Ruin which uses Corrption to proc insta-cast Shadowbolts, so yes
---
4. early on we're very weak to physical damage, so warr/hunter/rogue comes to mind as being very nasty to deal with in that order
---
5. your best game would be selling Dreadsteed services, but it's a lot of effort, next good old DM:E jump runs probably or Maraudon runs with boss kills + ghost mushrooms
---
6. T1 is mostly for pvp for its high stamina, and you'd be rocking T2 but it's not comparable to bloodvine either because you need the +hit% really desperately I'm afraid. 
---
7. Can't see why not, tailoring has some nice recipes but not mandatory
---
8. yeah
---
9. Gearing is relatively easy, my raid brought \~4-6 locks per raid, a bit easier than mages probably.
---
10. Warlocks will probably be underplayed as usual
---
11. SM/Ruin is fun, corruption everywhere and pop instant Sbolts hehe, Destro is ofc very good and maybe Soul Link for holding stuff a bit longer
---
12. My choice is female orc :)
---
That's what I mean. If I was in your shoes playing with a warrior friend I'd stick to feral because we both have a good idea of how to not wipe dungeons. It'll be faster questing if you stick to feral, then around SM when dungeons start to get hard you can always respec resto once you can afford it.
---
I quit a week in this time around. I got one level and realized nothing has changed and noped out.
---
&gt; Shadow Weaving is a ONE OF to buff warlocks in NAXX and maybe AQ progression. Before then it is not worth the dps loss of a real dps 
---
While I disagree with this tremendously, it's not necessary, but you will hear your warlocks (we have 5-6 sometimes) will love you for it, increasing morale and focus to not die and increase numbers.
---
&gt; Druid 3% crit to 4 people, not worth it over another rogue or warrior 
---
An appropriately-geared feral OT tank is better than an appropriately-geared fury OT warrior due to the fact that a feral druid will out-threat a fury OT warrior w/ sword-board and be able to swap to cat form with less loss in gear. See [Taladril's Treatise on Druid Tanking](https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/).
---
&gt; Nature damage buff is absolute trash, you could only reference boomkin(probably the worst"hybrid" dps in the game) and a fucking thunderfury proc lmao. Ele shaman will oom themself 40% through a boss fight 
---
This I agree with being on the bottom-side of hybrid utility, but honestly as a warrior tank with a Thunderfury (second in our guild), I would love the hell out of this and so would our top DPS performers since it proc's so damn often. Also, a good elemental shaman will not oom if they come consume (dark rune, mana potion) prepared which would basically be a requirement to even invite them.
---
&gt; \+holy damage is absolutely useless. Ooooh you can buff other terrible pally damage or a sick smite priest build. 
---
I'd say this is 99% useless, but tanks always have Blessing of Sanctuary on them so that's free damage and we get to keep Nightfall (important debuff slot up more often) and we occasionally have our Holy/Prot Paladin do some of the suppression rooms because it trivializes it and they come prepared with the gear so we need 1 less tank to bring and 1 more fury warrior that obviously would be worse than a Paladin at AoE tanking.
---
&gt;  There's just no reason to bring a hybrid dps. I wish there was. 
---
The obnoxious reason you would bring one: for the lulz and memez. The real reason you *MAY* bring one, being flexible to increase guild morale (retain those good raiders) while still progressing and not needing to be elitist as you're still clearing the same content as hardcore guilds, maybe a week later.
---
Honestly Loot Trading *could* be a game breaker if people abuse it, but I’m not gonna let it chase me away from the game that easily. WoW tokens are the first thing I can think of that would 100% scare me from the game. Vanilla is very much about your gold, so it would be straight up pay to win. Want a few BiS peices? Pay 30 bucks. Want a run through Naxxramas? Pay 30 bucks. 
---
People say it just solves the gold seller problem, but instead, I think it just transfers the scumminess to Blizzard. I will not play their game if they have money tokens. 
---
No, I’m pretty sure you can’t enter enemy territory and be free of attackers. Like, if you walk into Stormwind as an orc, pretty sure you ded.
---
Was this before or after they fixed the insane extra damage that sweeping strikes plus whirlwind was causing? Something about it ignoring armor of secondary targets or causing extra strikes, I don't remember exactly.
---
I remember that bug was decimating people in alterac valley and was the reason I leveled up a warrior!
---
Honestly I've heard some people suggest that, and in the start I felt kind of skeptic about it, but it's really grown on me.
---
The idea of having vanilla/tbc esque gameplay, but expanding the world and making a few different design choices.
---
It feels like a fresh start, like the WoW 2 that people have been asking for a while. It would require a lot of effort and planning ahead to work out I think though.
---
Well, I think I’ll play warrior or Druid for tanking the 5 man dungeons. I played Druid in vanilla but unfortunately in resto... either I take my revenge as feral, either I’ll go war and spec fury
---
I prefer PvP servers. I never ganked myself, I only fought back or took revenge at some later moment. I used a mod that I could add players of the opposite faction to, and it would ring an alarm the next time they'd be around. When anyone ganked me (attacked me in an unfair situation), I would add their name to the mod. Whenever I'd encounter them again, the mod would ring so I would gank them with my druid. Sometimes in completely unfair situations. But it was my sweet revenge. :)
---
Hi, I just refresh page all day.
---
It would be because they don't post here. Vanilla has a strong private server playerbase and Classic doesn't need to have a huge population anyway. It's a low cost perpetual revenue stream that doesn't demand new content.
---
Can you laugh not IRL?
---
Same. I could never feel at home if I was in an alliance city compared to Orgrimmar. It would ruin the experience for me, the feeling of being somewhere you're not supposed to be.
---
I remember figuring out other people were mining the edges of Tanaris and plying the mind game of trying to get ahead of their path or circling in the opposite dierection.
---
Good (frustrating) times.
---
I know every time they announced a stat squish I would get excited thinking it meant that I would get that Vanilla WoW feeling.  I know that was the only reason I gave WoD a chance. 
---
Just like you said, every time it still fell short. I dont think I’ve played any xpac seriously past WOTLK and I quit after Ulduar. I know what I want and I haven’t really touched Retail WoW since the Classic announcement.
---
I'm not hating on it or saying it should not exist, but I strongly believe that people wanting TBC/WotK do it largely because of nostalgia. Not that it's anything wrong with that or a reason you should not enjoy it. But if you're vanilla fan and fan of classic WoW design philosophies, you'll see that it started to change as soon as TBC - flying mounts, weaker world PvP, separate disconnected world, obsolete everything from old content, arenas, neutral main city... And the second biggest offense after flying mounts came in WotLK - LFD. 
---
I watched the trailer, had played wc2, wc3 and wc3 TFT, that got my buying the game
---
Back in alpha, I had a NE something lvl ~12, got invited to a xroads raid, ran through ashenvale, with Skull monsters chasing me all the way to barrens. 
---
That was epic.
---
The next thing was watching my friends mage run solo WC casting nothing but arcane explosions, was extremely fascinating.
---
I actually made a thread about that months ago. Apparently stacking stormstrike for huge critts was a PTR bug.
---
Lars-Olof!
---
In sw yes but they can go to deadmines without being attacked which is what this thread is about 
---
Shamans also have the aggro totem, pretty nice for herb/mine
---
For money it's probably enchanting. 
---
Just can solo a lot of instances and DE does not require any skill. I've seen Warlocks making a lot of money this way atleast.
---
Skinning and farming Devilasaur is a good way too.  Hunters Druids and rouge's all want that set.
---
Hello? Giant T-Rex’s, Zelda and Link, robotic gorillas, a fucking volcano? 
---
Ungoro 100%
---
Imagine your favorite soda brand one day changed their flavors and stopped providing what you loved. Then they told you that you're an idiot for liking it in the first place and nobody would ever want it back.
---
The devs did this to themselves. They created a divide between hardcore and casual by jeopardizing gameplay integrity for mass appeal and being smug about it. You can apologize all you want but until they fundamentally change retail they will continue to see pushback. They essentially told their old target demographic that they need to fight if they want to be catered to again.
---
If the hunter T2 set bonus debuff does stack, then it could theoretically go higher, assuming 30+ other hunters in full T2 doing their best to procc it on the boss.
---
&gt;warrior DPS
---
was talking about tanking
---
Plot twist, that’s what WoW Classic has been all along.. the beta was just a smokescreen!
---
^/s please don’t kill me
---
I think it's a great choice, but you can always test different characters if you want to be 100% certain on instant 60 Server.
---
But I felt that as an Ex-Rogue player, I couldn't live without stealth and you are a great pocket healer for the team.
---
Sure Priest would be more powerful in PvP and PvE, but I can't imagine WoW without Stealth. 
---
You can just basically go anywhere with a Rogue and Druid Stealth Squad. 
---
Did you go in?
---
There was one over on the coast of the Hinterlands IIRC. I got stuck and had to Hearth out. I'll be checking to see if it's still there when Classic launches.
---
Truly the only reason I’m not rolling Shaman lol. 
---
Of course! Fell until I randomly died and then ghost appeared at Crossroads.
---
I don't see how these things are mutually exclusive. If a group at the company comes up with a legitimate use case that would justify extending the friends list, they may consider extending it. if that group at the company were the classic devs, then it would in fact be related to classic. 
---
Just way too much speculation going on for any of this to be valuable. It's not doubtful, it's pretty much a toss-up
---
\&gt;What About SQUIRREL Tho!?
---
This subreddit does not have a "people want classic to fail" problem, it has a retail-hate problem.
---
I’m just using private servers to learn leveling routes and class mechanics. Pursuing cutting edge/competitive content on a private server has always seemed silly to me, other than pvp. 
---
Madseason is the only person I'd put up, a 1 hour video from, in fact I'm excited to watch it.
---
That's a stupid poll, it only let's you select one option. 
---
Agreed on all points, I love the guy, he makes awesome videos, and keeps away from the hyperbole that seems to drive almost all video game conversations, especially around classic wow.
---
got a link for it ?
---
But not as low as graysfordays I don't think there's a letter low enough for him. Maybe zzzzz tier. 
---
Rogue. Spam 2 for sinister strike because 1 is bound to attack. Every now and then hit 3 for eviscerate.
---
Even unbuffed MC items can still be good for things other than maximum raid dps.
---
"My point is that the devs clearly did not do extensive analysis of anything endgame, so the exact state of PvE balance was not intentional"
---
Yeah and that's actually why its good.
---
I think there was a post VERY early into this whole thing from BfA's alpha/beta where it showed a new realm type that specifically disallowed trail accounts. Might even have been before that. I'll see if I can find it.
---
If you enjoy rogue more. Other than that not really, warrior is definitely better at DPS and in BGs.
---
The black guy either changed into a yellow shirt, or gray shirt changed skin colors
---
As long as you are able to see the fire the DPS refuse to move out of, you’re fine.
---
The one zone I miss the most. I specifically keep at least one private server account just to be able to log in and do UD starting zone whenever I have my nostalgia craves. 
---
I think UD/Orc starting zones are the biggest atrocities they did to the game in Cata.
---
He leveled enhance and then resto for raiding. I can find them eventually but he would always refer to world of logs to his healing in WotLK he ranked incredibly high in NA. He was a god with healing. 
---
"Private servers are nothing like Vanilla", said nobody ever.
---
In the Wizard of Oz, the strawman needed a brain. 
---
Getting into a zone while grinding and listening to some music, a podcast, audiobook, etc. is so enjoyable
---
My condolences buddy, my friend lives with me everyday on my heart 
---
Yep! this was the first thing I thought of when I saw it.
---
Warlock 3rd highest? No way
---
&gt;because 1 is bound to attack
---
Made me piss. 
---
Thanks for the information, I really want to be 100% ready when classic comes out and hit the ground running. This helps
---
For me there is nothing more exciting than the chaos of world PvP. Getting ganked by 60's occasionally is a small price to pay.
---
muscle memory is amazing.   I quit in 2007 and when I started again on a private server some 8 years later, my fingers still knew what to do, while my brain had forgotten most things
---
It seems like there is two tracks to people wanting Classic again:
---
1. Kids who played vanilla but didn't get the full experience
---
2.  Adults who played vanilla but didn't like the way WOW evolved. 
---
As long as you let me tank on my demo lock
---
Considering going horde for the pvp racials, but I really really like just playing human for aesthetics 
---
Hard to decide 
---
I think we are more active because we have no content. I will all but disappear the day classic drops.
---
I’ll be PMing you soon, I really want to get both of these classes down pat so any information from someone like you I take graciously. Thank you so so so much
---
yeah and like i love stealth in other games too, its just so great. Being able to sneak and attack from behind as a druid and then pop out of cat and cast some spells or heal and depending on the situation go back to cat or a bear mmm so good.
---
I guess i should go cat and healer, but balance interests me to.
---
Maybe best idea would just go blind and not look any guides and put points into something that feels nice.
---
My condolences, I can’t tell you how many days we spent just in his basement playing all night. I want to try my best to live on a part of his legacy 
---
Thank you, he perfected the shaman class so this makes so much sense
---
I'd love this but I'm old now so I will be playing on a laptop in the kitchen with a small book for a mouse pad.
---
There's a lot of things that vanilla do that TBC also does or do even better. I've played vanilla on pservers for the past 4 years and currently playing a TBC server. Would I pref vanilla? Yes, do I still enjoy TBC. Hell yes.
---
Would I want TBC after vanilla? Yes because it's the next best thing.
---
Look at any PvP vs PvE thread, and you'll see most of the posters crapping on PvE players, and how they are enjoying the game wrong. When Vanilla had a 50/50 split between the two.
---
If you make good use of the elite quests in wetlands, quests in arathi/hillsbrad, desolace, badlands, and stv you wont have to grind at all. Not saying grinding is bad, but saying that 30-40 is obsolete for quests is misleading 
---
People saying it's just nostalgia completely ignore that classic wow is a far more accessible game to new players. It also has way more to do if you see MMORPG's as more then just raiding. It's a whole different experience. People arguing whats better classic or retail are completely looking past that they are different games.
---
Classic wow is simultaneously slow enough and simple enough for My mom and little brother to play with me at the same time. With my mom never feel overwhelmed and my brother having plenty of room to flex his budding e-muscles. My mom has no place in modern wow. It's a game 100% designed to please my little brother.
---
You just keep digging this whole for yourself.  
---
Ghostly strike and serrated blades are the only 2 semi useful talents in sub before hemo, when it comes to lvling.  
---
Also, shadowcraft bonuses, random blues? lmao. I keep talking about hit rating and the importance of it, especially while leveling and yet you refuse to listen.  
---
I'm honestly starting to feel a bit bad. You obviously have some sort of a mental disability.
---
I can't be certain but this was pretty early on in the game so it might have been.
---
Hunter is probably bottom of the barrel for me. They seem boring to play and tedious as a class. I don't want to have to deal with managing my pets in combat, camping rare spawns, pet food, ammo, etc. 
---
EU or US? 
---
&gt;to struggle with that level 30-40 range when you run out of quests and you have to get creative with the way you level.
---
that was never an issue, except maybe at the very beginning in patch 1.1  
---
It was mostly people not knowing where to quest.   
---
You still get the same shield later in the fight.  It's best to use the shield wisely so you have that push back protection when you need it plus get extra damage from void. 
---
It's almost like you losers literally spam this reddit because you have nothing else to do. Retail players can play retail they have no reason to go on reddit.
---
I leveled to 60 as feral specc and healed in all dungeons, in vanilla. It was easy, and I had never healed before. Just keep some healing gear, that's enough.
---
They are realistic btw... :-)
---
Just grab gear, wbuffs and good enough tank ;-)
---
"Exactly. Nostalgia is what keeps retail WoW alive today"
---
This times 100000000000000. I can't even speak to the amount of time nostalgia for this amazing game has caused me to resub to this skin walker. Wearing the form of my favorite game ever. It doesn't take me more then an hour to realize it's an imposter and I have no interest in this,.
---
Epic!
---
It’s not just about raw theoretical dps when leveling. Burst damage from extra energy and cp can be really useful when you accidentally pull an add and need to finish off the first mob fast, or if you’re low on hp and need to kidney shot and bandage because your evis didn’t quite kill the mob you’re fighting. And the talents discussed are much more controllable than the sword spec procs, though I agree that precision is quite good and could arguably be acquired first as missing special attacks is awful. Adrenaline rush is pretty meh as a leveling talent as it’s only up every 5 minutes. It’s great for raids as it’s up every boss attempt, but for leveling it helps burst down 1 mob every 5 minutes, or to kill single elites at the ends of quest chains. It’s fine, but it doesn’t improve QoL as much as talents that do something every mob fight.
---
I love it *because* it reminds me of Washington State
---
But you might not want 8 fury warriors in your raid if they’re outperformed by mages because armor...
---
But druids can fill any role. 
---
You see LF1M need tank and that's you. 
---
You see LF1M need healer and that's you. 
---
You see LFM any/dps and that's you. 
---
You just be what you need to be depending on the group make up and situation. 
---
If you're rolling a druid just to tank or just to dps you're doing it wrong and are just as bad as the people who say druids are only good for healing. 
---
Sure you maybe have a preferred role but the whole point of druids being gimped at every role is because they can do whatever role is required. 
---
Maybe I'm missing the option to turn on vanilla mode - but I'm only seeing the new models and animations.
---
In before the neckbeards swarm you.
---
You’re about to catch some major hate.
---
It's funny because Warrior is the class I enjoy the most. Sure, the leveling isn't the easiest but its not as bad as people make it seem and there are ways to work around their shortcomings. And at 60, if I'm not tanking or at least raid healing, I get really bored with PvE content. 
---
Yea im on the youtube classic wow binge. Bored trying to play other games whilst waiting. 
---
Nothing seems to keep my attention much. I do other things in real life but when i get on the PC. Its allways the same question "FFS When is classic WOW going to be out" I no its in summer but its taking forever. 
---
Lol ty. Everything I say on this sub catches major hate so I'm not worried about it.
---
Order 66
---
Hit the nail on the head there. Plus Classic WOW is such a great game. Cant wait to run around in westfall doing quests and the music lol. Full on nostalgia thinking about it.
---
1. Yes but with blizzlike progression you won't get your mount quest for a while. We'll see how it goes. Also you can save a big buck by having another warlock summon the dmw horse for you.
---
2. It's not too bad as a warlock really. Probably more than hunters way less than shamans.
---
3. There's 2 viable specs. Shadowmastery + Ruin, which is affliction + destruction, and then there's DS + ruin, which demonology + destruction. The only real difference between the two is that DS does more damage, but SM allows you to have a pet for tank buff, be more useful in the world, and might be allowed to use corruption. So I guess it ups the dps of a SM warlock a bit early on that's all.
---
4. Realistically nothing. A good druid can outsustain you maybe. That's about it really.
---
5. No you can't. You can farm maraudon slower than a hunter and you can use professions that's about it. And possibly some solo demon in winterspring stuff but idk how viable it is.
---
6. T1 is useless. T2 can be used to limit threat with 3 set. What point can warlocks properly use tier? Not really before naxx. You can wear pieces but not like full set or anything.
---
7. Tailoring is not a must before ZG comes out. So yes you could that.
---
8. Sure why not. If you want to make money with herbalism as an off spec. But I very much recommend engineering always.
---
9. Good guilds typically bring 3 warlocks and maybe 4-5 with AQ/naxx. You share all items with mages though so it can be tough. Typically you get priority on hit gear though because warlocks needs it more.
---
10. There's no reason for them to be any more or less popular than they are on pservers. How popular are they? Pretty popular on horde, not so much on ally.
---
11. The standard SM + Ruin pve spec works wonders in pvp honestly. The conflag spec (destruction) is very popular in premades on alliance because it gives huge burst, which is something ally needs. This spec is not so strong in open world as alliance actually because it's commonly used in world with succubus(wotf counters it), but it's still pretty good. SM+ruin is decent in world pvp too. Obviously the best world pvp spec is SL because you are basically a 15k hp tank with dots. But this spec isn't very good in premade because people will just ignore you and dispell your dots.
---
12. Female orc warlock looks sick, and orc is better than undead.
---
Not necessary at all. You should only bother about it if you want to truly min-max.
---
I have been mocked my entire life. I am absolutely notorious for not being able to navigate. I get lost in straight hallways. Not surprise then when I confidently clicked on this and went westfall. I was wrong lol.
---
Imagine if inner fire was a buff that could be given to other players wc3 style
---
Mining is not worth it for leveling engineering at all.
---
Yeah, because there were no vendors in vanilla.
---
I am not saying you are wrong, but some of my fondest memories are literally when our MT got ganked on the way to BRM.. I t was at those moments when our guild leader would announce on Ventrillo that we had had enough: ' all inside BWL, get out on my sign, it's pay back time. We are going to paint this mountain red!   
---
ok, it might screwed up our whole raiding night, but boy what a fun we had the next two hours.  a simple scuffle would evolve into a massive epic battle involving several guilds.     The same happened around the Opening of the Gates  period, but even more intense.   And it was not like this happened on every PVE night, more like 10% or even less.  Most of the times we could do our PVE stuff in peace, but those special occasions when all hell broke lose made it all that more enjoyable.   I am a PVE player, but I will never play on a PVE realm.  
---
I doubt it. Back then it seemed like while the competition stole a lot of ideas, so did Blizz.
---
Like the pvp zone in WotLK. This expansion released after Warhammer Online; a heavily pvp game with every zone having a pvp subzone. On release, WAR had a player base of half a million users. Not bad.
---
But then Blizz announced their next expansion will ALSO have a pvp zone. It felt like a forced addon to the game to steal back any leaving or possibly leaving players WAR might’ve caused.
---
Of course, WAR went on to fail; but it‘s mass-pvp is still better than anything wow ever had to offer, even to this day (a private server still lives). Perhaps only AV encapsulated the same feeling of “battle”, before the nerfs.
---
Big difference between 20% more damage on 1 attack (what I assume you simplified the average as, and not just read it wrong) and a 20% chance to crit.
---
A 20% damage increase on one attack will likely not change the number of hits needed to kill the enemy resulting in higher, but effectively wasted dps.
---
Whereas a single crit will greatly speed up that kill, which also reduces the damage you take making both your grind and  recovery time better.
---
I made a similar post and got called a conspiracy theorist, a wacko, paranoid, etc.
---
To me? Blizzard is smarter than this. They see the feedback. They know what an absolute failure this expansion is.
---
Meanwhile, they have youtubers, streamers, veteran players literally pitching them idea after idea that make sense on how to improve the game. They just won’t.
---
They’re fucking up sooooo bad it actually seems intentional. It really really does.
---
Why would he catch hate?
---
I love your Classic content :). Keep it coming!
---
I love you both
---
As long as they don't take real money!
---
Upvote
---
wow very cool
---
More great content from the very smart and attractive Staysafe
---
I'm gonna upvote that.
---
You can skill skinning + LW while leveling and use the crafts to get some gear. It's bad if you wanna speed level though but nice if you wanna afk craft a bit while leveling. Then you can drop skinning later for engineering. 
---
I can list some of the good parts about the other profs:
---
Skinning: Farm devilsaurs. Hunters are amazing at this and honestly don't bother with all the idiots who think there's gonna be mafia's and stuff. There might be mafias on a few servers but most likely not on yours. 
---
LW: There's honestly not so much you can at 60 with LW, you can get the MC recipe sure, you can get some gold refining salt but that's about it.
---
Enchanting: This is actually a pretty decent option because of maraudon and tribute farm. Disenchanting select pieces of the gear you get is going to up your gold per hour quite a bit especially in diremaul tribute. You don't even need to properly skill it. I don't think it's worth actually skilling and getting the recipes though, it's a lot of work.
---
This video is okay better than your stream :)
---
Hah! Noone sleeps until Kel'Thuzad dies!
---
I’ve seen a lot of posts similar to this and that’s just how it seems to go.
---
I know this is going to sound a lot like high school senior prom all over again but:
---
Where is the hole?
---
Classic won't be cancelled. I don't expect a shop besides Murky/Gurky/TCG mounts/collector's edition pets, as that'd be a great way to anger a huge portion of the potential playerbase.
---
Rest easy, amigo. Go play something else for a few months, unsubscribe from here, and come back in May.
---
Did you just assume my gender?
---
2 months and a bit, from April 10th  till June 20th 2005
---
“Sorda”
---
Hahaha, some friends and I found this spot in the Eastern Plaguelands. It was unfinished, and to get there you had to cliff-walk and swim for quite a long time.
---
You could quest there if you're not a shaman or druid (no class trainers in UC) with a lot of grinding, you could probably get to 20 / 21 before the mobs were too low. The only downside is you'll be too low lvl for hilsbrad and the walk to the other zones will take you quite a while. Though if you were to quest in ashenvale you could go through the back of org and do a mad dash past the high lvl demons. 
---
I'd suggest getting the Tmill fp before leaving though.
---
Fuck that walk of doom.
---
Best thing to do with things like this is to play it out on a pserver and see what works best.
---
The world record is easily broken, joana himself knows this. It's a 13 year old record not because it's amazing but because it is not longer possible to contest it. But yes it's a pretty realistic /played goal.
---
You are correct that it's the bottom that hurts, but as long as he is able to hit 60 he did his part.
---
The reputation grind is nothing really. You only need a couple of  people to complete it and mages can easily do it while leveling up(it's a bit slower but mages level fast and don't need to farm dungeons for gear as much as others). You can just summon the dousers back and forth and you'll get it done in 30 mins, no rush really.
---
The real stopper is having 40 people hit close to 60 and having a tank farm all the fire res gear needed.
---
Current pserver record is 10 days btw. But obviously private servers are cooooompletely off and that would change everything and make the grind take 3 weeks instead.
---
No it would be impossible to reach classic wow's success by just mimicking it's game play. Online video games are like planets. The bigger they are the more gravity they have. Once you become a supermassive planet. It's very hard for other games to enter into your orbit. Because even if they are better places to live. The gravity or pull of the other larger game will destroy you. Only wow can kill wow. Until wow dies completely.
---
why would you say something as controversial yet so brave
---
Hunters ain't awful, although you do have an above average number of "urgent" binds that have to be set to something convenient.  I found warlock to be the most hotkey intensive class, at least for pvp.  For pve every button you need can be bound to your mouse.
---
You are on a classic wow forum months before it's release. Yes I just assumed your gender lol.
---
Fine.  Let me provide the substance behind why I want TBC/WotLK and it isn't just nostalgia, just like I did with everybody who said the same things about vanilla for the last ten years.
---
I don't prefer 40 man.  It's cool, but very impersonal and I'd rather have a smaller group than a huge zerg.  I like mechanically challenging bosses, and almost all of the TBC bosses and hard mode WotLK bosses make vanilla look like a joke.  I like the class gameplay of TBC and Wrath.  I don't care about world mounts or world PvP and never have.  I don't mind old content being obsolete because I like being able to progress beyond things and not feeling a need to run them anymore.  I don't even mind LFD at max level, because in WotLK you have a daily heroic to do and the dungeons are both old and easy.  LFD screws up leveling, but at the end of an expansion?  Really not an issue to me.  I even like dailies or at least prefer them to farming the same herb for hours on end to make my gold.
---
My problems with modern WoW do actually begin in WotLK with the inclusion of multiple difficulties, but it isn't until LFR that my ability to enjoy WoW breaks.
---
It entirely depends on your play focus.
---
Some will want to do world firsts. They will rush.
---
Some want to maximize PvP advantage. They will rush.
---
Some want to be on the 1st wave in raiding. They will rush ... because their raid spot will likely be filled by sniping another 60 from another guild.
---
It's up the the individual to decide what is important to them.
---
Heirlooms cost gold and other currencies. You can't buy anything with real money other than cosmetics and gold.
---
I agree with you
---
&gt;They were cheaper/free to play, they were new, different and most crucially, they could offer the complaining WoW fanbase any immersion breaking new feature they wanted.
---
Are you sure about that? You mentioned the Vanilla -&gt; WotLK time frame. Iirc none of the WoW competitors went F2P then. Most of the F2P transition happened later really. 
---
Warhammer never really went F2P. Until it’s shutdown was already announced. 
---
Conan went F2P in 2013 from what I’m seeing.  
---
Swtor came out in late 2011 and didn’t go F2P until late 2012, e.g, Cata era. 
---
So. I don’t think your timeframe really makes sense. Most MMOs were 12.99 - 14.99 a month, just like WoW, until Cata.
---
Lol, shit you might be right. That I cant remember
---
Fair enough.
---
Dark Spears 4 Life!
---
It's ok time gating everything and making BIS not doable with rng wf/tf will make people stay subbed!
---
Yeah I suddenly just started noticing this "private server heroes" bullshit
---
People legit don't know what to do on the internet anymore if they don't have an enemy to position themselves against. 
---
Hahaha i can relate.
---
Is this the one where you run along the coast of southern Tanaris to get to?
---
Classic is also more easily set down and picked up, I can choose to stop playing Classic for a week, return and pick up where I left off. Sure a few friends might get ahead of me but the repercussions for taking a break are nominal.            
---
            
---
Retail is a ramped to max speed treadmill. Oh did you stop playing for a week? Fuck you missed out on AP, guess your neck will be severlly gimped, oh you didnt fucking do Arenas well there goes your points. No raiding, probally not a big deal, nothing you wanted would drop and your rerolls are all AP anyways plus fuck it, honestly the next patch makes all your shit pointless oh but damn you didnt Mythic+!? Well no chest for you!                 
---
Retail seems to completely bank on your FOMO + attachment to all your previous achievements and time spent.           
---
           
---
Where as Classic is a fresh start with no attachments and nothing pushing you to the end except your own personal drive for progressive raiding. 
---
I'd much rather play with competent players focused on having fun while progressing through content than competent players focused solely on progressing for the sake of progression. Sign me up.
---
It's not really payback when the people who are ganking you don't have anything to lose from death. (Whereas the dragonslayers getting killed are losing world buffs).
---
I also forgot to mention. One of the biggest things that made wow a success was that it had over 15 years of lore to pull from. If you guys remember classic was pretty soulless all of it's soul came from 3 games that laid out it's future. No other MMO is going to benefit from that either. WC3 was all but a set up for WOW to slam dunk it home. 
---
No other game type has ever been as good at story telling as RTS games had been in their hey day imo. As that game type is no longer tripple A I also don't know that any other game will benefit like classic did
---
Sadly I doubt the demo will reflect the game release candidate. 
---
I'm not familiar with the more modern engine when it comes to macros. Blizzard will have to decide what is allowed in the newer API and what is not if they are to emulate what can be done in Classic.
---
I just hope some very popular class macros don't become useless in function. Classes like hunter and Druid will be nearly unplayable early on for many dedicated class players if they can't emulate their previous setups.
---
A side affect of me choosing to play Shaman as my main is not requiring many macros. I'll decide which alt is best once I learn how macros and addons will be handled.
---
Gnome is better for pvp, escape artist. Weapon skill is largely irrelevant for tanks, because of heroic strike spam. 
---
This one we swam along the coast north of lordaeron to the east, and then cliff walked to the eastern plaguelands.
---
One of the cool things about classic too. Is if all your friends are already ahead of you. It means they have a lot of the gear you need. So if it does drop. It goes right to you. Feels good man.
---
There were several free to play games (I can't remember their names, sorry) that I tried out in those days because I was cheap. The games you mentioned had a bigger budget than the ones I'm referring to. There were about four or five of them, (perhaps not all free to play but they all offered free trials and a better price) all blatant ripoffs of old WoW.
---
14 Days played or something.
---
Warrior. Not a true answer really. I'll never play one ever.
---
Warlock. I just don't enjoy going and collecting a bunch of soul shards to do anything.
---
I'm really trying man, I just picked up Metro Exodus and Division 2 to try to keep busy on weekends, it's normally at work where I have so much downtime to kill and only can get on certain websites and Reddits one of them.             
---
         
---
I know it's obvious to us what having WoW Tokens and cash shop forced into Classic would anger the player base but Blizzard seems completely tone deaf to anything not being said by a board of directors 
---
I don’t recall anything like that existing in any form that actually would be considered competiton to WoW. 
---
Why would Blizzard consider them competition, if they’re so forgettable that you can even remember them?
---
That, or maybe blizz is just incompetent now because a lot of the folks that made warcraft great in the first place aren't around anymore and instead are more interested in profit rather than passion? Gaming companies lose their way sometimes - it's happened before Blizz and will happen in the future. 
---
That glourious body. God damn!
---
BGs were cool when you had to go to the physical location to queue up. We'd have epic battles in barrens/ashenvale/arathi and shit.. People from alliance would try to raid our queue for warsong gulch and we'd retaliate and there'd be battles all throughout the area.. It was fun
---
Never hotkey a flask :)
---
I legit think people should roll non Dwarf Priests
---
That way you can filter out the massive nerds and min-maxers who view the "game" as a job that they must be optimal at.
---
I'm down play Ret Paladin or Enhancement Shaman depending on faction.
---
Dwarves are cool though. 
---
