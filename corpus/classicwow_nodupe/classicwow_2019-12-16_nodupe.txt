Funny you should mention this, I'm going on vacation tuesday.
---

---
Thanks for the info tho!
---
---
---
No. It's disabled in BGs.
---
I just went through the entire classic screenshot channel, and the earliest screenshots i saw were from hoppy, who did it in response to my screenshot on reddit, 3 days after me.
---
Sounds like a healthy guild to be in. One that isn't blasting the fun out of a 15 year old game because of numbers.
---
Sorry, can you please explain how I do this?  
---
I want to change my main from a Human Mage to a Gnome Mage. I want the Gnome Mage to have the same nickname as my Human Mage. I want to do this as quickly as possible with losing as little raids as possible.
---
that's true about the 1 handers. but they dont have a particularly good drop rates , especially viskag/deathbringer. I know its anecdotal but my guild has only seen 1 of each of the ony weapons and zero brutality blades. we are pretty unlucky :(
---
One thing I love about vanilla / classic is that the alliance does NOT have a definitive leader. Instead in terms of gameplay and lore important stuff is split between ironforge and stormwind
---
The whole concept of a high king just collapses under scrutiny
---
Man you guys sound like a bunch of fun.
---
The game is running out of content for you, but a newer player is gonna have *plenty to do*
---
I also am running out of things to do, can't wait for bwl
---
Crusader if using it in the offhand as a rogue
---
Striking if main hand as rogue
---
Yea you should sell them to horde if you can, alliance pve tryhards roll humans anyway.
---
Cross server you mean?  
---
Yes but there aren't many oceanic servers and there's more horde.
---
Gives 100 rep too.
---
If it's a BG or a raid, I come with lots of water made and say, "Open trade for water." Easy for people to find me and expedites the process. If it's in a city and all you do is open trade or whisper, "water" then fuck you. You have all the time in the world in a city to be polite about it. I've legit just put people on ignore who do that.
---
It's not that hard really. If you have a mageblade/perditions/whatever bis item and have the people say "pay 10g or you wont get it" do you really think people wouldnt easily pony up the cash for the loot? I'd probably quit the guild right after I got it because that's scummy as hell to have a couple leaders charge a tax on something 40 people had to work to get but you bet your ass I'd pay that small fee for a bis item if I was strong armed for it.
---
I'm the guy who's gonna laugh at you for thinking blizzard is ever going to change anything about AV 
---
LMAO
---
"not spamming shocks" idk how you think shamans pvp and what other spells you think we've got man.
---
Or you can let them come and give them equal priority because they're another human being playing the same game, investing the same time into it, and it hurts no one except greedy assholes who will look for any excuse why it should be "me me me"?
---
I agree, I was kinda trying to make that argument to the above poster. Guess it came off a bit wrong
---
1: it's situational. Depending on the mobs you are grinding and how low you are getting between fights it could be more optimal to throw on a rejuvenation sometimes to keep moving, and HT other times. Whatever keeps you moving / minimal drinking.
---
2: I like it. Instant ranged pull without having to shift to caster. Helps dps some. It doesn't cost mana.
---
3: Try to maul each mob you are tanking. It produces the most threat. Maul, tab, maul, tab, maul, tab etc. Use swipe when you need to dump rage so as to not waste it or you're not worried about threat.
---
4: I'm guessing you sometimes open with moonfire and sometimes stealth cat? I would only shift out of cat when you need to heal or pre-hot yourself for a difficult fight. Shifting costs a lot of mana.
---
Is this an old clip or are snowballs active in classic right now
---
Our ret luckily got it in a pug, would've been hard on him otherwise. All dps warriors got it now too though, as well as one of the tanks.
---
this guy probabilities
---
It's not going to be optimal, but it is viable. I leveled up to about 30-40 primary single target, and then once I had enough talent points to get pretty much every aoe grinding talent(it's hard to perfect and I was new to the game), I leveled only aoe from then on, but was easily able to do decent (very good) damage to single target fights in dungeons
---
It's only neck beard pathetic betas still playing it, got boring after a month
---
can you capitalize the second letter tho?
---
Faerie fire is mostly good for threat, u pull with it in dungs and later u get talent to use it in melee
---
Against small packs (3,4) its better to Tab (switch) targets and maul on cd, fill with swipe. On big aoe Tab swipe.
---
For questing/grinding goin stealth is usually a waste of time in your rotation. Rather HoT heavy and kill 2 mobs.
---
Yeah but constantly hearing in each and every post how classic is garbage takes away alot of the fun of using this sub. I stopped coming here as often due to all the "venting" going on. It just takes energy and fun from the game.   
---
I know its a good way of bringing attention to problems but one big thread about a topic should be enough.
---
no reason not to throw a rejuv on yourself before shifting back to cat while grinding
---
pve-wise, feral faerie fire primarily gives you a ranged pull while tanking, without having to leave bear form
---
if you have enough rage, you can do both. maul is on your swing timer, while swipe is on the global cooldown. If your group is aoeing, you can spread maul around on different targets. If focusing on one mob at a time (with adds) maul that primary mob while throwing out enough swipes to keep the extras on you.
---
how are you stealthing after entering combat?
---
I didn't know any rolls prior to calling it lol
---
&gt;For healing after I'm low HP, should I use exclusively healing touch as it's the most mana efficient, or should I heal up to full, throw a HoT on myself, and then go into combat as it heals me while fighting? Which is more optimal?
---
Throw a healing touch of the appropriate rank in between fights, and use a HoT if it's a bigger pull or tougher enemies otherwise you'll use up more mana.
---
I've found that as long as you fight monsters around your level that you can kill like 2-3 staying in cat form, then using max level HT to get to full, then going back to cat form. By the time you kill another 2-3 your mana is usually back to full.
---
&gt;Is faerie fire (feral) all that great? I just got it and even when it use it, it doesn't really seem to increase my damage all that much.
---
It's amazing for ranged pulls, and fucks up rogues badly. I'll be honest in that I don't notice the DPS increase, but it does have some very good uses.
---
&gt;When tanking in dungeons, is it better for threat generation to individually maul each mob, or should I just spam swipe?
---
For AoE, spam swipe. For single target, spam maul.
---
I usually pull, do the roar, then spam swipe until there's one enemy left and then maul it. I'm usually tabbing between enemies and if I see my target-of-target is our healer/DPS I'll use my taunt on that mob.
---
&gt;Finally, my current leveling rotation is: healing touch &gt; moonfire mob &gt; rejuvenation &gt; cat form &gt; stealth &gt; ravage &gt; faerie fire &gt; claw x4 &gt; ferocious bite. Does this seem reasonable?
---
How do you stealth if you have moonfired a mob?  
---
Other than that, I'd throw a rip in at the start if the enemy can be bled.
---
CAN RELATE
---
Well retribution paladin has more buttons to press than mage. Anything has. Even a MobA character does. At this point Blizzard should just allow bots to play mages in raid. It would just save a few carpal tunnel syndrome to some people.
---
Don't worry Holy paladin is God tier and retribution is meh I fully agree.
---
This.  Ally gets like no honor in a rush whereas they can get 2500 to 3500 for a 13 minute loss.  Since many got exalted due to 8 min wins first 2 days they want the honor not rep.
---
Why are we presuming the ret pally is the former and the warrior is the latter?
---
[deleted]
---
So then it wouldn’t work? You’d be bleeding raid members and never be able to keep a full roster of geared people.
---
Dumbest shit I’ve ever heard
---
No it actually makes capping those graveyards much harder. Instead of just fighting npcs and a few stragglers, youre going to be fighting all the allies that died during their zerg and that number will keep increasing if the horde down south defend all the graveyards. Also capturing SH GY takes a while, youre still going to be respawning at Iceblood.
---
What most people don't want to understand is that the honor grind is against your own faction. Extra honor means nothing if all of your faction is getting the same amount of extra honor in these matches. Extra rep however is at least useful in some manner to most.
---
need 30 copper to send gold via mail !!!11
---
Not so much if you had to do it right after work pvp started.
---
[removed]
---
There were no other rolls above. Only three people rolled, and the last roll was too far down to capture with the good stuff. He rolled like a 27 or so.
---
unless they cap snowfall............
---
Reposting because there was some confusion about the "world first" claim.
---
1) This is the north side of BRM. There are many videos of people on top of the south side of BRM, which is easy to get to. 
---
2) This was done on November 27th, which to the best of my knowledge predates anyone else doing it. The only other known people to make the climb did it in response to me doing it and making a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e2ugc0/i_challenge_the_entire_classicwow_community_to/) about it.
---
If someone has proof of someone doing it before November 27th, I'll edit the video thumbnail/description and take down this post.
---
What classes ARE technical?  This isn't MoP.
---
That’s the spirit
---
I feel like this could get you suspended for griefing
---
why is he summoning his pet right there?
---
Yeah, society outlaws substances because the United States has an extremely puritanical view on bodily autonomy and used their political clout after WWII to get laws passed against drugs world wide. Then. People realized you could get rich off prescription drugs and other substances stayed illegal because of lobbying. But continue believing whatever you want dude.
---
What other profession gives you additional abilities in combat?
---
NONO NOOOH
---
Yes yes, your definition of fun is the golden standard of course.
---
I leveled engineering to 200 with about 30g. Granted I'm a gnome, but the higher level skill ups are the expensive ones
---
they were introduced very late
---
I played vanilla since day one, mostly without x-realm
---
Someones mad because they're losing games
---
heh, dont you love it when people give anecdotal evidence for some shit like this
---
Maximum loss for a week with no HKs is 2500. More than 15 HKs that week convert to flat 20% loss.
---
Either pvp alot or not at all on your vacation week if you're rank5/6 or above. Doesn't really matter otherwise.
---
Lol. dungs.
---
Atleast its good DPS! :(
---
lol
---
Slower weapon in main hand
---
add an honorless, repless / tokenless av.  that way the players who want to play for fun can.
---
Thank you for respecting my gaming choices.
---
If you aren't talking about highly optimized then why talk about theorycrafting at all
---
Dirty fuckin dangles boys
---
&gt; pve-wise, feral faerie fire primarily gives you a ranged pull while tanking, without having to leave bear form
---
Just out of curiosity, what's the benefit of ranged pulls?
---
if youre geared for regen, you do.
---
I wish people learned, like you did. Gj:)
---
Imagine being like you
---
Enough for other guilds on the server to pay my guild thousands of gold to get summoned to the spot, so yeah a fair amount.
---
Comments like this makes me realize that most of the people raiding in classic thinking they will actually get somewhere are absolutely delusional and never raided properly before. Benching is standard, you got to have a few extra. It's like anything else, something can come up, someone's internet can go down or whatever.
---
awww, the endless attempt of meme spec to justify themselve never get old.
---
hopefully you don't vanish out of existence in AQ-naxx even if nobody wants you.
---
Good to know actually, thanks man. Will help since I travel a lot for work.
---
And why wouldn't you. 99% of the players will never reach R14 anyways. Yea you get a lot of honor but how much honor does the guy get who queues AV 10 hours more per day than you?
---
Grinding Honor seems kinda pointless if you don't have your whole life to spare for it.
---
well if you look at all the best performing guild they are indeed pretty slim on caster.
---
Can confirm this is a problem as Alliance player.
---

crossrealm bg was in 1.12, not vanilla
---
Please no
---
And that's the problem with people like you, you are so convinced you are right, when you don't know what you're talking about.  
---
People like you are exactly why turtles happen so often.
---
You also give Thunderfury to pallys, hunters and rogues?
---
Even if all 1.4% drop out immediately after attaining the mount (unlikely as as a few will go on to ranks for the epics), that means after 10 weeks 86% of the population would still not be able to qualify.
---
It's a concern for a minority of players, no matter how you look at it.
---
Just discovered this. You're great man. &lt;3
---
enchant that bitch up
---
&gt;Every single bot for every single game ever gets a fix the same day or the next day after their ways are found out.
---
&gt;Every time.
---
Which is precisely why they don't ban em the second they encounter them
---
At 39 you get 2-second lightning and from there ele takes control and never gives it back.

the pvp is the best it's been in weeks, no

NO ONE WANTS WPVP BACK
---
Myself and another rogue were 2v1 a warrior in AV. Had him almost down. He popped retaliation and we killed ourselves before realizing it hahaha
---
Well played, warriors
---
I’ve raided every xpac, just not vanilla, never been benched bro, I’ll leave that one for you champion
---
Slightly less than a ret but you buff other classes with your crit aura and an innervate, which is more than you can say about a ret paladin, if you had to pick between a ret or moonkin, moonkin wins.
---
I tend to ask for water and toss them an innervate.
---
Problem is mages don't know they get the same mana regen through casting because they never get innervated
---
So they'll cast water once or twice and then stop! Ah!
---
Set your hearth and alternate with flying.   
---
Easy.
---
It doesnt matter if youre speedrunning or not, if you kill the boss anywhere from 15s-3m the aura is a dps increase
---
No, you horde made your bed and now you can sleep in it.
---
Honor rank 3 gives another 10% discount too.
---
I joined av today to win 1 game for the quest. Literally took 5 games and 4 hours to win one game. The last game when we finally won, they killed gav fast, and made it to drek without losing to many people.
---
But most games consist of a wipe, then giant chunks split off, and the people sitting back "defending" bitch the entire time while the offense struggles, because 15 people are sitting around doing nothing.
---
Good video dude
---
do you even know the difference between a PvP server and a PvE one?
---
go to a PvE server and enjoy picking flowers
---
edit: imagine having ego to speak on behalf of everyone, while being a moron who can't even tell the difference between server types
---
damn!! i usually conjure til i’m oom unless there’s less than 30 seconds til it starts
---
13 minute....
---
Ours are 30-50...
---
Why are you complaining?
---
This was a great get rich quick scheme back in vanilla. And a great lesson in Supply and Demand 101. Anyone mad about high initial prices or mad at others driving the price down need to go back to school. Made over 100g today. I remember making like 300 in vanilla one year. The angry whispers I would get were hilarious.
---
I can confirm. As an exalted min maxer i spend my time in these AVs killing fellow alliance with snowballs.
---
I would anticipate that we'll probably see a ban wave before the reset (including removal of gained honour/ranks from botters). I would expect some sort of announcement dealing with the obvious AV botters very soon.  
---
PVE botters is a different story. Eitherway: even if they don't manage to ban before the reset i'm sure they'll manage to do it later in the week and re-calculate all the honour brackets etc on the next reset.
---
First week of BGs is a shitshow with people farming AV rep. Expect less than usual rank up this week and it will get noticably easier following this week.
---
Thanks I had a search for executus but don’t see any tank specific videos
---
Some people have all the luck
---
You're telling me there are guilds that will pay "thousands of gold" for you to summon their raid up on to a ledge...?
---
Beautiful. Please please please do one of Ironforge someday!
---
Im reporting the same bots everyday , no matter what range lvl they are everywhere , mostly in super late hours or non seen spot in the zone , i have a list of all players name which keep growing . Sadly banning in wave is useless as they already farmed a lot and will reappear in no time. The best thing  we can do as a player is to carefully pay attention about player we seen ingame , most of the time , they are guildless , have a non sens name and are doing repetitive movement and arnt interactive. I noticed both mage and hunter are the most suitable class as a farming bot . Also dont buy any items on the auction from them , they are already undercutting us.
---
Respect is definitely a stretch.
---
Yes, comparing giving a melee weapon to a ranged dps as the same as giving two melee dps equal chances on gear is the same thing. What a fine point you made.
---
One pally bubble pull. Hunters distract shot to tanks and locks banish.
---
I wrote this to another comment, but short version is that i looked at the 3 guilds with the fastest mc clear in the world and i only found one BRE on a horde warrior used on bossfights with adds. Every single other warrior were DW fury, that includes a fuckton of warriors with dal'rends.
---
I am fairly confident with stating that DW fury is better than 2hander fury when player properly except BRE might be better if you play horde on 5/10 bossfights in MC
---
Agreed, please keep daily q&amp;a thread
---
Those are even worse. Such special human beeings. Games out since 15 years and it has been proven a gazilian times that this shit just doesnt work...
---
...B-but I havent tried it. I will show everyone how its done. for ME it will work. 
---
Like imagine the mindset of such a person.
---
Triprunners my man
---
\#NOCHANGES.. everyone wanted it.. enjoy
---
Ashbringer-EU
---
big server. decent faction balance (horde still wins tho)
---
"rest of us"
---
you mean people who are clueless about PvE/PvP server differences? the ones that react with emote spamming whenever they get to taste the real pvp?
---
I especially enjoy ganking people like you
---
Lmao...wizard of oz is missing a straw man bro.
---
Im obviously generalising.  Same as you had with benching a non-meta vs a meta
---
Ok
---
&gt;I mean if you’re alliance BRE is strictly a pvp weapon
---
Why? Because it's not the very BiS weapon? You people irritate me.
---
Fuck all that jazz... you play as the dominant faction on a server, you made the minority factions life literally unplayable for all of phase two until bgs were released.  Your Queue time should be long.
---
#nochanges
---
Why is it beneficial to have a ranged pull while leveling?
---
I’m with you OP.
---
Cassp is talking about arugal it’s amongst the highest populated servers under the NA region.
---
Fury warriors definitely are. More so if you go for HS toggling.
---
They nerfed it, sadly. But I did some runs with a group yesterday in SM cath where we used the warlock’s voidwalker instead of the eye and it worked ok, just not as smoothly and the packs weren’t as big. You CAN still use eye of Kilrog, but to make it work you need a mage following the eye ready to arcane explosion on the mobs and take agro right before eye dies (otherwise mobs will reset.) That same mage must then either a) nova and blink or b) ice block.
---
Once you get to ZF though you don’t need a lock. Get 4 mages and a priest and use ice barrier and mount up!
---
But generalizing what?  I’m generalizing based on damage output, you’re just being arbitrary.
---
Yes
---
That trade window popping up IS me asking for it, and the politeness is in me not contributing to your tell spam.  You're welcome.
---
There's a quest item dropped by the crocs, not a great drop rate... See photo
---
It's also hilariously unfun. Like, if you're gunning for server firsts and speedrunning, power to you. But that feels like a wasted activity in a game where people figured everything out a while ago. PvP is more dynamic and in a PvP guild you gear up people faster since you bring more class variety. I'd fucking hate to be in a raid where you compete with 10 warriors and 6 rogues for the same piece of loot, or play something like a hunter for "nightfall duty" because their "dps doesn't scale". Seriously. Content is perfectly doable with even a significant amount of suboptimal classes and specs.
---
You also, realistically can't even play your class, because most of your week is spent offline on that character babying your world buffs hoping you don't get ganked or purged getting to the raid.
---
Players at that level haven't really figured the class out yet, ESPECIALLY druid players, who have so much on their plate. Also they're probably inexperienced with pvp so they seize up and fat finger things. He attacked me in cat form, noticed he was getting destroyed, and switched to bear trying to run away.
---
no
---
the tunnel is far too long and the snowballs got a 30s cd.   
---
You'd need like 10 men to kick out one of them or you might not eben be able to kick one guy out in time before the BG finishes.    
---
I did like the idea but in reality it sucks.
---
take the towers and earthbind the fuck out of them, do it with an enhance AND an elemental.... hoooleeee shit you'll see whining on the forums
---
I literally said to do this and everything thought I was joking
---
And you're so pathetic you dug through a reddit post history for a shit tier insult 
---
I'm good not being like you, champ. &lt;3
---
Not vanilla.
---
But but but, nobody warned them this would happen.
---
Oh wait...
---
or maybe people want to spend more time in a match then in que?
---
To be more precise we were selling 3 summons (to their warlock alt + 2 clickers) for 1000g. We considered this a low price and dropped it to that because we didn't want to be hardasses.
---
People will pay over 100g for a flask of supreme power. How much do you think it's worth to get your entire raid, every week, into MC with full world buffs instead of losing them to the 100+ horde players in BRM?
---
 And yes guilds did take us up on the offer. One guild even had pictures showing how to climb the statue but still paid because it was too hard for them to make it up.
---
On Oceanic servers the queues were 5 mins on Day 1, 10 mins on Day 2 and yesterday they were over 40 mins and it hasn't even been a week.
---
Some of us like to, I dunno, have fun
---
Should just send a tell then imo.  Same for all other buffs.  I frequently hear people just blurt out in discord or posting in /raid for a particular buff.  If you just ask for AI then 5 mages might cast it on you and you've just wasted mana, time, and maybe reagents.  Look on raid frame, right click a blue frame in range, send a tell "AI plz".  Easy, simple, efficient.  More people should do that.  Channels would be more clear.
---
This. I couldn't give less of a shit.
---
Just give me my last 12k rep so I can leave and never touch this again.
---
He rambles about equal priority. So suddenly it's not always equal priority? You don't give melee weapons to hunters?
---
And that's the best of the best going for sub 30 minute clears. You dont have to be anywhere near that percentile to clear naxx or AQ.
---
Yes but probably once nax came out, people would talk about vanilla wow, as what it was when it first launched.  So forgive people who still think this way.  It is not their fault that what vanilla wow now entails, is everything prebc. I was shocked when I started playing classic when I saw things like boomkin, because my memory is bad, and I had forgotten they were introduced pre tbc.
---
No it syncs across raid guild chat battleground and yell
---
Drekkisath
---
Wasn't an insult it was a simple fact, what you get from that is entirely up to you. You saw it as an insult because you know its a pathetic game and you're pathetic for playing it, I didn't say that. And by the way checking your front page isn't digging through anything
---
Maybe it’s a guild who lets people play what they like? 
---
That’s the only kind of guild worth joining IMO
---
How can you say that MC 2handers are better than pre raid weapons when there is one single warrior between the top 3 fastest MC clears who uses a MC 2 hander? and that is only for half the boss fights, for the rest there is a few vis'kaggs, brutality blades or deathbringers but everyone else is choosing pre raid weapons over MC 2 handers
---
Set graphics to preset 3!
---
Yup, even better is AP+ PoM pyro with that sweet ignite damage.
---
You make rogues disappear from 41 yards away
---
Too behind for what? If you like the game play it
---
2.0 was vanilla in that case.  vanilla is more than a number, it's a flavor, and crossrealm is not vanilla.
---
 Always played horde but decided to roll alliance for classic. 
---
This hits a soft spot for me having levelled so many toons through durotar. It’s almost like homesickness. Great job!
---
Sweet, cheers for that :)
---
didn't even bind them. 1/10
---
Which means you need to get your honor as fast as possible, meaning you need to hit the battlegrounds harder and faster than everyone else - Yes, you're bringing 40 other people up with you, but hopefully they get stuck in a stalemate next game.
---
Hahaha
---
Yeah okay.
---
I’d kill for 13 minute queues though. Best we’ve had was about that for half a day after BGs came out and now they just fluctuate between 25 and 60 mins.
---
Obviously I’d bring a ret if int meant getting improvement might or something, but most raids have enough Paladins.  And rets don’t take tier gear so as far as gear distribution is concerned they’re basically warriors.  Still, no advantages.  Unless you’re massively overstocked on warriors and are passing Paladin loot, this doesn’t not matter.
---
Again, these are all matters of ‘if you have a specific reason to bring the ret’, rather than which you would take all things being equal.
---
&gt;If you're playing with randoms there is literally no way to win...
---
Yeah, there definitely is.
---
&gt; IMO if you solo queue you should be match maked with other people that are solo queueing, not with people grouped up.
---
I only very slightly kinda sorta agree, only because there's a difference of intensity with premade vs solo que. Sometimes I just want to get in and lose or win with some quick pvp during, not be GY camped for 30 minutes, being stomped by a premade. But try to group up with guildies or maybe try looking in LFG for a WSG group (I feel like this would be easier if you're on a pvp server) and make your own premade. I kind of wish we could premade AV without manipulating the system.
---
What about those who've never played WoW?
---
Forget exactly how much but it's around that. I'm also human though
---
Of course you can get back in to the game.
---
Vanilla/Classic should be pretty easy to catch up or play at your own pace. Early tier raids will always be run for legendary pieces/gearing alts the only thing you'll miss out on is things being progression as by the time you hit 60 you'll be carried through fast.
---
You'd want to get some answers from others on herod on if you are better off rerolling.
---
You're not the register though, you're aisle 3.
---
A lot of people in the battlemaster room still complain so I guess alliance win some too.
---
&gt; It’s about having a conscience
---
Come on mate, that's where you're going with that?
---
Crippling the Alliance Rep train helps the horde by forcing the Alliance to grind longer, shortening Horde queues and providing more foes.
---
Addon: Leatrix plus
---
Turn on faster looting setting
---
Thank you, I have been trying to use sword and shield so I can be ready for harder dungeons but I am rage starved a lot
---
no. they were introduced at the very end.
---
vanilla was mostly wpvp and small scale BGs with 1-2 guilds / pvp groups competing each faction - the closest thing is what you had in classic prior to AV/WSG release.
---
How hard is it to get 11?
---
Atm, it's the rogues who make me disappear with their oneshooting ambushes.
---
I feel like paper
---
50/50 u get it or u dont
---
Not that I think it applies but I would trade out a mage for a shadow priest all day in DM W. But that doesn't apply to this warriors situation. Just being contrarian.
---
Ok bud.
---
Thank you for the detailed answer
---
Some monsters will be clustered in groups, at times it's better to be able to single pull one by themselves without swapping forms (huge mana cost) so you can avoid engaging a fight that may draw unwanted adds.
---
While tanking mobs with range in instances, using FF then hiding behind a wall will pull the range creep and get them to come to you. Again, you'll save mana and maintain your rage because you won't need to swap.
---
A lot of monsters patrol an area, and you may not be able to get to them easily, a ranged pull in cat/bear form can be a lifesaver in those situations depending on the environment.
---
Letting the alliance rep grinders out hurts the Horde's queue times.
---
Memes keep subreddits alive. Without meme posts all we will get is complaints, posts bragging about some crap most of us don't care about, and art.
---
If people dont want to see memes then have them filter out the meme flair. Simple.
---
That picture on the right absolutely kills me, lol
---
1. Dire bear doesnt multiply your armor by 3.6, it adds 3.6x your armor to your base armor, so your armor is actually 460% of your base.
---
2.  Thick hide is multiplicative.  So it takes that 4.6x and makes it 5.06x, not 4.7x.
---
3.  Context is important and so is knowing how to interpret numbers.  Moving from 60% damage reduction to 61% isn't a 1% mitigation increase.  It's a (1-.6)/(1-.61)-1 percent increase, or 2.56%.  So improving from 70 to 71, for example, is better than improving from 60 to 61 or 50 to 51.  This is why the same amount armor gives less "percent damage mitigated by armor" as player armor increases.
---
Thick hide is awesome and should be at least 3/5 in cat hybrid tank builds and 5/5 in bear tank builds
---
What is it
---
Cross continent BGs are bad, but forcing them to be purely solo queue like they did with AV does way more to ruin the social aspects
---
theres nothing i hate more than undead mages.. and i still feel like that guy comment was uncalled for, good video.
---
Simple napkin math tells us that the total weapon DPS between the two Dal'Rend's is about 67.3, assuming dual-wield specialization (ie. `1 * 41.43 + 0.625 * 41.39`). Spinal Reaper has 74.7 weapon DPS, while Bonereaver's Edge has **75.9**. If the weapon itemlevels were equal, dual-wielding would easily beat out two-handers in the weapon DPS department (eg. Vis'kag + Brutality would be sitting at 87.4 DPS), even with the dual-wielding hit malus, but it's a different story when comparing pre-raid items to the highest itemlevel weapons available right now.
---
I would say the marginal amount of extra rage and whatnot that you'd generate in dual-wield spec pales in comparison to a &gt;10% raw weapon DPS increase, plus you'll apply your damage far better because you're now autoattack hit capped unlike with dual wielding.
---
I said "every 5 or so runs". Also I haven't sperged out and recorded everything in a spreadsheet so maybe sometimes it's lower
---
Seems fake
---
&gt; Here's the catch, this quest can only be done once per year per level 60 character.
---
Level requirement should be 30. The lowest level character I could test it with was my level 50 alt.
---
Maybe they get banned on the 1st day after buying another month of game time to maximize profit.
---
Some real mad people in this thread.
---
TLDR: mages are fucking trash.  Just shut up and give me water, water boy.   No need to bitch on Reddit
---
Wait until you get hit by a 1,9k MS+1,2k Autohit+HoJ 1,2k hit. And this is the early stage of the game..
---
I use leatrix and its still noticably laggy.
---
Maybe 10% will keep playing a month in
---
I really wish this game was an RPG, but that element no longer exists.
---
This game is 15 years old. Plus it's an mmo, unless the player base actually dies off it's not too late to start.
---
kromcrush?
---
you kicked the already loose soil for a sick (judging by the cop out comeback at least) burn. digging is def a stretch, still man, plenty of people are playing the game, pve servers are safe, its only pvp imbalance that is killing pvp servers, not people being bored.
---
I suppose if you enter the queue with a super positive attitude you could nearly guarantee that you'd be put up against a premade SO shitty that they couldn't beat a pug.
---
True. Since they rolled a 78% that makes it a 22% chance of beating it.
---
I hate it when I spam everything on a shaman and it's just OS me at the end. I feel like getting OS by lots of things while being undergear.
---
Yeah frost sp makes a huge difference. I think i've hit a guy today with a 2.7k with an arcane power pom frostbolt(  i'm at 430 sp)
---
Huh. Same here. Guess they are doing something wrong. ;).
---
No one is going back to wpvp.  It's not happening.  Players who want honor won't wpvp.  People who want to pvp want fights, not 15 minutes of running around doing nothing at all.  As a result, there are no targets for high rank people to prey upon.  Which further reduces player deathballs in the world.
---
When AQ comes out, it will return with a vengeance but not before.
---
I definitely disagree, the people playing now are people that played on private servers anyway, there's nothing attractive for a new player about a game where everyone already knows 5000x more than you
---
Spotted the person who didn't play launch wow!
---
YO BRO YOU KISSED A DUDE THAT'S FUCKING hot
---
that's on horde side, on alliance they haven't quite figured it out yet.  You're saying it's awesome cause you're winning, and before it sucked because you were losing.  That is all.
---
My memory may be fuzzy but for some reason I think they might've only been looted in AV but usable elsewhere.
---
Wtf its the source of this photo, lol?
---
Best day of my reddit settings was when I unsubscribed from /r/funny
---
Yea honestly i'd consider BRE pve.  We've had 0 DBs,VKs,BBs,OEB, SR.  1 perditions.   We literally have the worst luck known to man with weapons.
---
Oh snap, thanks! I'll update the post. Wowhead says 60, but that very well could be a mistake, as it also says daily
---
You said good luck getting 10g out of you for an item you "won." You didnt say anything about a raid group. I was replying to what typed not the situation you created after the fact.
---
Hardest part here is clearing the dogs and bugs as a hunter. Bugs is probably doable but the dogs are gonna either take forever or be unfeasible (gotta slowly kill one at a time because getting back up the stairwell will evade heal them).
---
Some packs if you walk up to them you will body pull an entire group instead of being able to just range pull 1 at a time.
---
As a tank you will want to line of sight (los) pull caster groups too by using a ranged attack then running out of line of sight forcing the casters in the group to come running to you. If you don't you'll just have the casters at range not being hit by you so they'll probably aggro onto a healer from heal aggro or a ranged dps who decides to kill them.
---
Also may have times where a mob fears so range pulling them back to a safe spot can prevent accidents.
---
Imagine playing 10+hrs a day. Yikes.
---
Yea, if I won the roll or had the most DKP and I won it. Then to ask for a 20g tax? Hah. Fuck off.
---
I dont know, why would it cry if the horde cant attack lol
---
Thanks man. I never touched a video editing program before yesterday so i know the editing is poor af ahah
---
Yeah, people should just roll Greed on the Onslaught Girdle that drops from Ragnaros.
---
Charge- sweeping strikes- whirlwind
---
Def stance sunder and revenge, use ww on cd
---
I don't recommend leveling prot warrior, especially in leveling dungeons SS+WW+Engi dynamite is the way to go
---
and your raid will always be as strong as its weakest player, thus the weakest players need the good gear first so the raid progressively gets easier through the weeks. Obviously this doesn't mean that terrible players should be rewarded, but if someone plays well and their gear is the only thing holding them back in terms of DPS or whatnot then they need that more than someone that's already doing well without it.
---
You can right click their name in chat and target them then trade them. Don't have to find them in the mess of people.
---
Or maybe there's more factors that go into deciding the winner of WSG than whether one group is premade.
---
I personally think global queuing is a good idea in the abstract but introducing changes like that is going to lead to a deluge of requests for all sorts of stuff. At the end of the day it's not that big of a deal to sit around for 10 mins to get into AV.
---
Maybe they just like to let people play what they want? Not everyone cares about min-maxing.
---
Crossrealm were introduced in 1.12. Not at the very end ffs...
---
Theres a creepypasta called abandoned by disney. Look it up on youtube or on the creepypasta listings. It'll put this photo into more context.
---
Nice witch hunt, you should be banned off the reddit.
---
Rofl.
---
&gt;You have literal limitations making you not as good as others.
---
Not as good in ways which are utterly irrelevant.
---
&gt;We have the choice to bring you or someone better. We're taking the better person. Bye.
---
Well godspeed to the people in your life both in-game and out.  Having to deal with such a raging spergling must be rough.
---
i mean the same could be said about modern wow, on that note, i was a retail player (albeit one dissatisfied with bfa) but im looking at sticking on classic until shadowlands more or less just using my retail AH to keep my sub up.
---
I will be sure to hit you up, but I haven't had any luck finding other people. Apparantly there are discord channels to find them, but I haven't even heard of where to find those.
---
&gt;It’s not about min/max. It’s about having a conscience and not being the literal worst dps class in the game, taking gear away from the literal best dps class in the game.
---
Its not about min maxing, it's about min maxing? Wtf.
---
If you want to care so much about what's the best and what's the worst that's min/maxing. Who gives a shit if it's not the perfect efficient combo. Just because someone spent their spare time to research a 15 y/o game to min max everything, doesn't mean they deserve the loot more. Some people just don't care enough or don't have time, however that doesn't make them below you on the loot totem pole.
---
If your ret pallies are pulling 150 dps maybe you should stop inviting level 40s to your raids. Lol.
---
This is how you're supposed to pull drek lol. However, the tank should probably position drek closer to wall so it doesnt get fking yeeted by 56 palas.
---
DPS would not be able to complete raids without tanks, who cannot tank without healers.  Warrior DPS is especially dependent on buffs to achieve the heights they do.  Mages get 10% of their damage from one of the warlocks.  Warlocks receive major damage boosts from a single Shadow priest.  
---
The hand that feeds you is everyone.  If you think that you are somehow giving everyone else their gear and therefore deserve it more than them you are delusional.  Furthermore, this line of thinking is precisely what eventually breaks up guilds when things get difficult, not the guys who put in extra work to make something unconventional work.
---
and nowhere in that picture does the ret paladin comes in... as holy pallies can do everything they can.
---
You keep saying we all have big egos and are clueless or not backed up by anything but you are literally the only one in this thread who has these thoughts about wpvp. Time to take a look at yourself bud.
---
This is legitimately the most satisfying thing to land as a warrior- sword spec and hoj don’t really proc that often, but the 1-2 times a night they all pop together and make a caster disappear make everything worth it. More fun when they disappear the priest than the lock / mage, but the procs are super noticeable and satisfying whenever casters get blown up. 
---
I distinctly remember just how tilting it was to have happen to me on my first time through in Vanilla though, my condolences.
---
the salt in 6-7 month will be glorious
---
I still think solo leveling enh is better.. just feels better. always died alot as ele especially if I pulled an extra mob. if I did it with enh was no big deal. so depends on the player..
---
Your statement is true on a broad scale, but not entirely accurate. Scaling isn't equal, nor is utility or reactivity.
---
neckbeard comment of the day

&gt;The title of your post clearly states “in BGs”

&gt;  
---
&gt;Lmao. You’re drowning.

You're arguing semantics which I have already clarified several times in the post.

Again, a failure of your ability to read. Please, let the adults speak if your attention span is that short.

In pvp I play 1/29/21 spec with a heavy mix of +int/+sta pieces (t1/t2 parts) and like shoulders from scholo that are +10 to all stats and same with wild heart legs from strat UD. Attack power is a bonus to be found in gear but not what you strive for. In my current PVP gear I got like 5200hp/5000mana. 
---
A good chest for PVP is the blue BOE craft from Timbermaw rep. Slam +100hp or +4 stats on that one and you gucci.
---
One sentence is rambling?  Are you dyslexic?
---
The dominant faction was able to continue farming FPs, BRD, etc. while they were still able to queue for BGs. Basically a somewhat lighter version of P2 -  forever. The smaller faction (myself included) basically quit entirely.

This is the actual smart strat

He used an AV snowball to knock back his own factions NPC into aggro ranged of the other team who weren't ready to pull yet
---
They had managed to pull the general out while resetting the WMs. He used a snowball to force one of the idle WMs to facepull on the ranged dps fighting Drek. The hunter+an untanked WM was enough damage to kill everyone inside the safe zone and force Drek to reset.

Can confirm.  I've been banned on retail for MCing enemies through their portal.  Mostly in AB, but it warranted a 72 hr ban for griefing.

Right and Frostbolt is a binary spell. Quite informative, will change my post. 22,5% less dmg from non-binary spells and 22,5% chance to miss for binary spells. But from what I understand there is a chance that 25%, 50%, or 75% of the non-binary spell is resisted which total at 22,5% less dmg at 90 resistance. + the 1% chance of spell being completely resisted once you get 90 resistance. Did not know binary spells had such high chance to miss, I get why hit rating is so important then.
---
Uptime, wasted procs.
---
Looking at parses is circumstantial evidence at best, because
---
1. The number of people who have gotten a Bonereaver's Edge or a Spinal Reaper (which are very rare) but *haven't* gotten an epic one-hander (which are reasonably common for warriors, seeing that they can use a very wide variety of them) is rather low.
---
2. Most people are blind slaves to BiS lists and established playstyles, even among top performers.
---
No you didn't. This was embarrassing.
---
Wsg gear is out however that trinket has spell penetration which isnt a stat until later on afaik
---
&gt;They can come to the raid as a useful spec like restoration and then bid OS on it.
---
Must feel really good to treat people poorly for literally no reason.  Personally I don't enjoy being a massive cunt but I guess to each their own!

Guild i'm in is Loot Council. I volunteered to be a Winter's Chill mage and I KNOW I might not get the Mageblade until after BWL launches, 13 weeks of raiding now (maybe 14?) and there's still more than half of the casters to go that are more important than me damage-wise.

I just wish everybody had the same mindset, raid performance&gt;personal performance. Parses are cool, but clearing raids faster is cooler

The mage didn't cast another poly. Cause he wasn't in range of me after he polyd me.

Don’t feel bad fuck the alliance. They have to gang up in you in fight for a BL happened to me dude sat there watching me fight 2 mobs thought he was gonna give me a real duel but fucker was waiting on his buddy to come before attacking me while I was finishing one mob.

How do I get these and how much do they cost?

I love it when I get an innervate, especially when I'm oom and there are a dozen people asking for water in the next 30 seconds.

---
I was in your boots just a week ago. I'm a feral tank druid too and I farmed the majority of the 800g for my epic mount doing BRD coffer and Plugger runs. I buy the coffer keys from 20 to 30 silver per key. I solo Plugger as it's really easy if you LoS his spells. He can drop blue items which vendor from 2 to 4 gold. Then I head to coffer room where I open 11 coffers and get 70 to 80 silver on average. This average includes gray and green items which I vendor and sacks of coins. The sacks of gems are not included, but can add up a bonus if you sell the jades and moss agates on the AH.
---
You can watch videos on YouTube on how to achieve this. Basically watch any rogue video, since the majority of the run is stealthing.

interesting... i'll research the highborne history in classic wow to see what can i do
---
As a warlock, I usually will open trade with mage and put a healthstone in the trade window. 
---
They usually know I want water/food in return. Mage gets healthstone, I get food/water. Win-Win.
---
Yeah, I see that. Your Warchief gave you good advice.
---
These eggs are incredibly easy to farm from the Moonkin in Darkshore. You can get 60 eggs in about 10 minutes.
---
If you think those standards are even ok to offer up for someone to accept or decline there's something very wrong with you.
---
&gt;We have shaman in our guild that respec every week for pvp the same as the rogues that spec sub during the week and raid combat.
---
Big difference is your rogues get gear that's valuable for what they do for most of their game time while your shaman are going to be PvPing in blues (maybe the token epic or two to show for their 9 months of contribution to the guild) at the same time as your guild is getting ready for AQ.
---
Also please please please do not try to argue that the difference between a sub rogue and a combat rogue is even in the same galaxy as the difference between every single hybrid spec.  Different hybrid specs are functionally different classes, while no matter what rogue spec you are you're still an elusive, nimble melee fighter who stabs people.  Neither the fantasy nor playstyle is significantly different.
---
He means using an authenticatior, I haven't done mine in like 10 years i assume you can do it from the account settings page on battlenet
---
Total ass.
---
worth it for a fresh opener.  
---
Trinket crippling and you're in for a nice stunlock, especially if you're in battle stance half the time.
---
Ugh seriously? Enclave was on my old retail server The Venture Co. Horrigan is the worst.
---
I do that. While I wait in queue because its 10 minutes long, I will go to attack ally and when I get the pop, I am considered invincible for 1 minute because as soon as I die or begin to lose ill accept the queue
---
You should definitely play what you enjoy! But the research has been pretty exhaustively done and from a pure efficiency standpoint ele is faster 40-60 than enhance.
---
Its the same amount of effort when you literally auto attack and do less DPS then tanks? Yeah dawg same playing field.
---
Lol good argument. We shouldn't get upset when people kill eachother either. 7 billion people on the planet who cares
---
TBC with any luck
---
Shouldn't that be reserved for the other side of the argument? I'm of the opinion that an upgrade is an upgrade. I don't care if it's not BiS, if it's better than what I'm using I'll take it. These people that are "BiS or nothing" are the ones that are holding out using their copper swords until a musket is available.
---
How do I get hard packed snowballs?
---
I mean is it just a /roll with large numbers

Warrior is the hardest class in the game
---
Saying a ret pally is melee dps is a little facetious.
---
 It sure why this is getting advertised.  Crappy thing to do
---
&gt; Which only happens in a 1v1, so prior statement stands. 
---
&gt; In group settings ...
---
...
---
Theres a little more to it than that. The gist is that you roll against someone until one of you rolls a 1, then that person pays up.
---
Except they can’t wear plate or use swords............

---
You see, enjoy the game at your own pace. You'll never be too far behind for anything in Classic. I mean, otherwise, no one would have any twinks.
---
Classic became such a rush made by the community that I understand your comment, but in the end, nothing of that really affects you.
---
It's a lot easier to balance PvE ability around consistent damage compared to hoping for a WF proc every swing.  
---
I did like PvPing as enhance in vanilla, but being so reliant on WF is so rage inducing.

I lived in China for 6 months in 2010. Played a lot from my office with a mediocre net connection so I mostly flew around mining. My account was locked twice and I had to call Blizzard both times to let them know that yes, I was actually in China playing my own account regardless of how much my activities look like those of a farming bot. It was annoying that I had to call, but they had no issues unlocking it and I have a funny story to tell.

Dude imagine an MMO where you actually had to do that
---
Wait... You are aware that mages for sure use more than 3 buttons, right

I stopped dropping totems because the chances of someone in the same group as me being near is slim to none
---
Hybrids suck at everything except healing. That was the class design. You're treating it like they are disabled and we are breaking employment laws by not letting them come lol.
---
If you want to raid with Melee locks, Spell hunters, Ret pallies, Moonkins, Enh Shamans, then good for you. Complaining that other people don't want to raid with them is hypocritical. The other 39 people are people too. If they don't want their time wasted they don't have to take bad specs.
---
If the info is dependent on people using the addon, the it’s skewed simple because it’s incomplete due to not every raid has someone using the addon to record and report the data. This is exactly the concern i raised.
---
Yes I know this, but crusader leads to higher damage overall according to the simulations. So why use striking?
---
true I should be more cynical
---
20! Is like 243,290,200,000,000,000. That’s a lot of spirit.
---
How so? They are dps that preform their role from only within melee range. Seems pretty astute to me. 
---
If you wanted to make the statement that they aren’t the best preforming melee dps, that would be completely factual; but to say they aren’t melee dps is just asinine.
---
That is something to consider but in boss fights crusader still sims higher
---
I am, what is this setting?
---
this was surprisingly fun to watch
---
Not everyone wants to spend 3 hours in MC because they have to carry 2 ret pallies. If a off spec finds a guild that lets them raid, good for them. If they can't find a guild it's not everyone elses responsibility to make sure they get gear.

Anecdotal of course, but [this was an Eredar Twins kill](https://youtu.be/DBC48zA3ngs) from back in the day. Our enhance did pretty well, and was consistently in the top 5-8 for most fights.
---
are you talking about the animation? Cause that was so bugged, it happened like 1/5th of the time during classic.I seem to remember them failing at fixing was reason for removing it.  
---
Sequence procs was OP and removed in early classic.  
---
You could still throw on a 2hander, but damage and health/resilience nerfed random burst to the ground.  
---
Enh was at least viable in PvE and some meme-comps in arena in TBC.
---
If having 2 Ret Paladins causes your clear time to go up that much higher, you have bigger issues than having Ret Paladins.
---
Classic is only 4 months old. Vanilla may have been different but that was a different game in a different time. Classic is what we have now and it can never be vanilla
---
I'm also want to know about this.
---
You could get 15 hks in one bg.  It would be less than you think.
---
Just say I'll pay for water and the mage will find you...
---
Thunderfury
---
Crown is better than lionheart for AP-ret because we don't need the hit from lionheart.
---
I'll probably ruin your day by telling you I still occasionally use phone to make a screenshot since it allows for much quicker sharing that doesn't require any alt-tab action on my PC which could potentially make my game performance worse or make me miss something important in the game (basically substituting phone for a second monitor). This shortcut just makes it easier to share a particular part of the screen which is one of the strengths of the phone (in exchange for the quality).
---
Sometimes convenience &gt; quality. Similarly how screenshot is more convenient than saving and sending a full quality picture I want to share.
---
Absolutely this. I haven't heard ANY negativity about being a druid so far, groups don't seem to give a shit about min/max like I keep hearing.
---
They are dps the same way prot warriors are melee dps. A raptor strike hunter will do around the same "DPS" as ret pally.
---
&gt;If you wanted to make the statement that they aren’t the best preforming melee dps
---
They are the worst, by such a margin it's like they aren't there.
---
If you said Ret pallies are melee, that would be astute. Adding dps makes it facetious. 
---
That spell hunter post yesterday is the same as taking a ret pally.
---
Yeah Snowballs add a new dynamic to the game and really liven up the meta
---
Well + nature damage gear prices just skyrocketed
---
I think all 3 are gorgeous.  I tried playing a Tauren at one point and Thunderbluff turned me off so much I got rid of the character lol.
---
Not sure but &lt;Cool Whip&gt; on Yojamba lets their members get away with some abhorrent shit.
---
Making the claim that having a couple of suboptimal specs is going to drastically increase clear time on content you seem to be farming for future raids just seems completely ass-backwards. Might it go a little slower? Yes. Will it go from 2 or less hours to 3? No.
---
Nothing I’ve said is complaining about others. I’ve simply stated the facts of the matter that having them and letting them receive gear isn’t going to prohibit you from clearing said content. Personal attacks, rather than discussing the subject, just shows you have nothing else to say.
---
*spirit
---
Put some math on it.
---
It's still that bad?
---
Why tho
---
YOU FELL FOR IT FOOL
---
Yeah. You guys had 20 years of glory. Chill
---
Yeah..cause you'll stay within that mana spring radius and/or not use poison cleansing totem before you get a return on that mana spring investment lol..  
---
Unless you're precasting it in a duel mana spring has little to no use in PvP
---
I think it's only retail that gives xp for wins in pvp not classic.
---
Absolutely. Outside an activity? You do you, give it away, sell it, whatever. But if you get in a group with me either give me the fucking water or you can figure out how to heal and buff yourself.
---
Not to mention it costs me reagents to drop group buffs on everybody, you literally create as much food or water as you like by clicking a button.
---
Fixed.
---
Bears in general don't have much mitigation going for them because they lack parry and block. I'd say it's necessary to hit the armorcap of 12k before gutting your armor talents. You can really notice how much it sucks not having block/parry in aoe pulls and every bit of armor helps.
---
Better than some simulated number based purely on a perfect scenario that'll never happen in the real world.
---
keybind it, you take so long to click it.
---
lmfao
---
:)
---
Westfall is my  favorite zone in classic
---
Taking advantage of a bug blizzard is voluntarily leaving in the game isnt really technical.
---
it seems fun, honestly
---
Well, that gnome warrior doe
---
I don’t get it
---
Is this &lt;Checkmate&gt; on Herod? Oh no they never had as good phase to start off with...
---
Yea why would you even need with your main?
---
&gt;Then you get more loot over time, which increases the speed at which you get gear for ret.
---
This logic does not hold at all.  A handful of pieces of gear being diverted from officially sanctioned DPS specs is not going to appreciably impact how your guild progresses or how quickly.  On the other hand what impacts how quickly *you* get gear is, ya know, getting fucking gear.  
---
We don't have any paladins given we're Horde, but were we to have some and they had to wait until every warrior had their girdle they'd be waiting closer to a year than not in all likelihood.  When you're talking about one item in isolation that's maybe ok, but that's the same with every item.  Every warrior and rogue and mage and warlock will rack up item after item but items rarely actually become available for off-spec because even though all of them have a ton of loot there's still plenty of them that don't have this piece or that piece in specific.  So you end up getting zero loot outside of the scant few tier pieces that are kinda-sorta ok for your spec for bloody *ages* and then when you do finally getting gear it is always hilariously outdated even by vanilla standards.  Getting a ToEP now is absurd when everyone is rocking 300ish spell damage and health pools are relatively low.  Getting one (or ZHC) when AQ comes out when everyone has a ton more health and the "real" casters are sporting as much spell power passively as they used to when the trinket was up is still ok but your experience with the item is easily going to be a quarter of what it could have been.
---
I'm pretty patient and don't at all expect to be showered in loot every week, but if you're asking me to wait for probably a year after a given item becomes available before I start having a shot at it that is simply an absurd request and I am not going to accept that deal ever.
---
The thing about naxx is you need gear from naxx to reliably clear naxx. I'm sure some super tryhard nerds can clear it in bad gear because they've been doing it for years, but having flasks during the first month will help because that can easily mean getting another boss or two each week
---
Minmax ret dps is a divide by zero error anyway
---
You still used WF/WF after the nerf, you just didn't downrank your offhand. It was just a straight hybrid tax nerf.
---
Over 400 runs dirty a guildie no SGC
---
You lost me when I saw stromstrike on your bar.
---
Doesn't really need to be a "not" there's so many fucking scanning add-ons that just put a huge button and make a noise whenever they scan something like that.... I honestly wish blizzard could do something to crush that shit. AH trolls are just annoying.
---
No exp for wins. However, the quest ofc yes. Basically, if you’ve got any plans to get rep with AV you might as well level a little while doing it.
---
Yeah :) I saw all the memes now for real do you have answer or not I only like orcs from horde
---
Haha. I don't mind thunderbluff. Orgimmar I a decent city, but it is so huge, if you don't have a mount it basically sucks.  The best horde city is UC. It confused me as a new player, but I ended up loving it.
---
cat druids with pre bwl, and the 100% energy from vael mechanic, will actually destroy that fight.   
---
so long as they dont pull threat and die ;)
---
It wouldn't be the first time a big guild screwed over its members.
---
Eartshaker. Might be a bit more ally then horde
---
Were they a gnome? I know there's a machine in SW that turns you into a gnome wearing a santa suit. Thanks for the info though, gives me hope that the tailoring patterns will drop :)
---
I remember reading somewhere it's a "softcap" or a good armor value to have. Gotta check my sources.
---
Snow piles on the ground in AV. Like white ungoro soil mounds.
---
How many times have you fallen for the /afk
---
nah im on Kirtonos
---
AV queue pop btw
---
Does someone have a link to the original image? This shit is hilarious
---
The problem with the way BGs are working is theres a million fucking servers on the same queue. If memory serves right there was 4 servers in a battle group in vanilla, and that's after they put in battle groups.... The current "problem" with how AV is being played and how alliance can effectively run premades and horde can't is entirely due to them NOT KEEPING THE EXPERIENCE AUTHENTIC.
---
The vast majority of the problems are have with classic are unintended consequences from blizzard NOT KEEPING THE GAME NO CHANGES.
---
Rank 4 flash, yes. Not heal.
---
It has a 43% coeff. With 3 set you're getting the throughput of a heal/gheal .3 seconds slower but split into two precise casts.
---
Hype and Aim on the alliance sides are being massive a-holes about the R1 bracket. A couple of guys accidentally hit the bracket the week before BGs without being aware of it and got bombared with abuse and threats from the Aim boys.
---
Ah, Blizzard Customer service in 2019. Somehow leagues worse than 2004.
---
Happened in my guilds last MC run, westfall server. Warrior was top on DPS charts and logged off in a rage.
---
Pfft, Org is shit, UC is the best horde city. (Thunder Bluff is great too for a bank/crafting alt too).
---
the top 100 parses for paladins  averages to like 305 dps. Compare to that to warriors at like ~1013 dps. 
---
So yeah, safe to say the average guild paladin is going to likely pull in like 150 dps because the class *is that fucking bad*
---
Edit: Also, its super fucking selfish to slow 39 other people down because a guide says its your BiS piece.
---
With the new talents and abilities DWing spellpower daggers also made enchancement spec with spellpower gear viable.
---
Yea, atlas shows 6, wowhead says 2.5.  I thought i saw 3 somewhere the other day.  Who knows what it is supposed to be.
---
Since when? The last update said this.
---
&gt;Sync over Battleground, correctly
---
It'll add 15s or  to every fight for every meme spec you have. So yes if you have 2 or more it can easily add up to another hour.
---
&gt;Personal attacks, rather than discussing the subject, just shows you have nothing else to say.
---
Dog whistle of the embarrassed.
---
&gt;I’ve simply stated the facts of the matter that having them and letting them receive gear isn’t going to prohibit you from clearing said content.
---
No one argued with you on that point. It will objectively be worse and slower, but you don't seem to want to hear that. If you have a meme spec let them have loot. If you don't want meme specs you dont have to take them. You keep replying for some reason.
---
What's that?
---
Ok tnx mate.
---
I like you, but youre a horde. So i dont like you.
---
Thank you.
---
Sure, but that's not what they were saying. They pretty much said that if you haven't already started stockpiling flasks it's already too late or like if you have a ret paladin in your guild you may as well give up now.
---
its nog, made out of eggs
---
And after you ripped his fangs out he cant use biting attacks until he rips someone else's fangs out and replaces his
---
its a shame, hes such a brick wall he would be great on defense, but it seems he just wants to zerg
---
Wait, I’m so lost, are you saying all people playing multiple characters at the same time (multiboxing) are doing it to sell the accounts?
---
How is that server honestly? My buddy and I usually like to play on RP servers but blood sail is an East coast server and I live west coast. However, I'm finding out on classic servers people from all over is all over every server. So it seems it doesn't matter and blood sail is the ONLY non pvp RP server.
---
I saw a video of this a while back from a zoomed out dev version of some game where as the char turned it would render a cone of terrain and objects in the direction they were facing. When I'm not on mobile I'll see if I can find it
---
I feel like you're misunderstanding him.
---
I made the ginger cookies with my grinded out ones today (am level 12 on a pvp server went to grind them out in alliance lands lol) got 89 of them sold a few but the rest would not sell)
---
I am just gonna keep a few stacks of cookies and advert in /2 every few mins saying I have some if anyone wants to buy them for the quest.
---
Those gloves are insane for any spec. 18stam 9sp and fireblasts get full benefit. No other gloves come even close, give or take r7 gloves with the bonus
---
I agree. Armour on a Feral Tank is it's prime stat and if a Feral Tank some how manages to become MT over a Warrior then 5/5 on Thick Hide is a must. However, chances are a Feral Tank in a Raid will be playing an OT role meaning it will need to be DPSing for at least a few fights. This is where Improved Shred comes into play as it provides a much needed DPS boost to cat form. With the remaining points it seems more worth it to get Brutal Impact as the 0.5 or 1 second longer stun duration is the difference between a heal and reju or death in a PvP scenario. If duel-specs existed or respecs were cheap all our problems would be solved, but alas.
---
Would love to see a time lapse video of your process
---
Well, thats what i use. With my mana/mp5 i dont even need consumes unless we are speed running it that week.
---
Stop baiting people. And if you aren't, go have some time to selfreflect on what wPvP means to you. You'll find the wPvP is still there but the way it was meant to be. Small-scale. Go twink in WSG if you like sealclubbing random people and shut up.
---
stop spoiling my farming method :P
---
i always said its  a quest item it cant be that rare.. :P
---
i solo farm them with my warrior + heal bot   and sold 10 of them for 350-500 gold  \^\^
---
fastest eye was 1 mob... longest was 4 hours,  but on average i get 1 every 2 hours so that is still 150-200 g per hour
---
edit : i have  a warrior on my main account  and  a heal pala on the 2nd account i call it solo farm  cause i don't have to split the money .. but yes its  with 2 chars / accounts
---
And Danny Devito as his brothers ghost.
---
Why’d you kill your teammate?
---
Pretty sure that would leave me feeling salty.
---
35 actually makes them a millennial.
---
Rather, they shouldn't have added city battlemasters until P3 or later. It makes no sense that some chump in Orgrimmar can teleport people to the other side of Azeroth.
---
I'm not sure about the others, but i can guarentee it's lvl 20 to get to 225. (My lvl 22 lock has 225 tailoring).
---
Meh, not bringing an enhance to my WSG premade either so that's a mute point.  
---
It's like you don't see a middle ground between sending in someone who is a handicap and going all in with world buffs/consumables. My guild doesn't care about world buffs anymore, but we havent found any room for boomkins/Enhance/elemental. Finding capable DPS isn't a problem, should guilds have some sort of affirmative action to match a hybrid quota? Not to mention avoiding the drama of how to prioritize loot.
---
Yeah but warm asters seem to come in duos even with the most careful of body pulls, so is the single pull thing avail to both factions right now?
---
Blizzard wants us to kill our teammates in AV. That’s why they made snowball apply a knock back to your teammates.
---
Aren’t you tired of AV by now? I know I can’t stay focused. I just goof off and let my team bring those bonus honors to me.
---
I’d rather spend the whole game hitting teammates off bridges and into all the NPCs in the allie base.
---
My hero
---
It's definintely 30 seconds, maybe it was changed
---
These are hard packed snowballs you loot in AV, not the snowballs you buy in IF or org

Funny, I don't remember calling anyone a prick, or telling them there was something "wrong with them" because of the way they and 39 other people choose to play the game.
---
The only prick I see here, is you.
---
Don't feel the need to respond, I'm done with this conversation. Enjoy your multi day partial pug mc clears and inevitable wall of non progression in any actual challenging content.
---
Why were horde getting triple honor?
---
Lol I'm surprised there is a person alive that doesn't at least recognize Jon Snow at this point.
---
this is how it looked in my head playing it as a kid
---
Scripted orcish gifs
---
Right now specifically for a few days you could make big bucks farming small eggs. Be it a vulture, crocolisk, moonkin or a windrider. Any egg laying trash level mob could earn you a fortune while the prices are up.
---
Soooo you're saying ret paladins deal effectively infinite dps?
---
Haha anytime man! :)
---
I do the same but try to sound a bit more friendly about it. Never failed, sometimes getting multiple stacks from different mages.
---
No, just edgy
---
That feels more rude than asking...
---
Grobbulous was a fun one for awhile.
---
Guild called Final boss when WoW Classic got released was caught shit talking RP players saying how they wanted to dominate the server and how all RP players are absolute trash. Someone recorded this and released it to the public and everyone fucking hated them, refused to play with them and just shat talk them the entire time.
---
I ended up leaving Grobb after hitting 60, not sure what ever happened to them.
---
I need a thicc Wow gf
---
They finally turned on friendly fire. I haven’t been on for it yet, but this gonna be good!
---
Impossible, coal is a stackable object.
---
Yes, "carry" him, rofl.  Might want to leave that term to games that are actually competitive.  Also when does this carrying start?  Sure mages are doing nearly double ret DPS, but they're *also* doing 50% more than hunters.  Should hunters get no gear prio whatsoever then?  I mean they're obviously just there for tranq shot since their DPS is barely better than meme specs like elemental.
---
If you are East Coast and want a PvP server, Herod is great!
---
He got first bonereavers though.
---
Is Classic literally like the modern equivalent of Gaia Online at this point?
---
Do you hate being asked directly in a whisper, or would you rather have someone in the AV tunnel ask to all of the mages "maybe I please have some water?" Mages seem very stingy lately no matter how polite. I usually end up just buying some off of a mage in IF so I don't have to ask again, but that's pretty crappy.
---
If you welcome hostile posts like this, don't act surprised when you find yourself surrounded by assholes.
---
I look fowarded to min maxing buffs and clearing as fast as we can and aiming for the fastest clear on my server. Id rather it be fun and concentrated for 30~ minutes rather than raid with rets and clueless people that wipe over and over put everyone in a bad mood and take 2 hours and give loot to shit classes. I was pugging on my alt hunter and they unironically gave a crown of destruction to a warrior that already has lionheart
---
Rainbow six wants me to kill my team mates. That’s why they turned friendly fire on. 
---
Aren’t you tired of multiplayer? I just goof off and shoot my teammates
---
This is how stupid you sound.
---
I mean there aren’t any super technical classes in vanilla wow pve tbh. Warrior and rogue probably are the hardest in pve and there’s not that much to them really.
---
Ironforge was the only city with auction house in early vanilla and it became capital cause of this.
---
the image shows a 60 alliance warrior
---
We’re in the opposite boat, 3x brutality blade. Finally got our rogue who has wanted to go daggers the Core Hound dagger. Made a Hunter real pissed because “ItS oUr BIS toO”
---
I never argued that it wouldn’t be slower,  but stated quite the contrary. My statement is it won’t be drastically different and min maxing farm content, where people are using neither flasks nor consumables for every fight (an assumption from experience), but pushing for the exclusion of specs because they preform lower than others is contrary. 
---
With your 15 second statistic, you would need 60 fights to reach your 1 hour increase with 2 of them. If you are making 60 individual pulls on content you are farming, you are doing something wrong. 
---
How is pointing out a personal attack the, “dog whistle of the embarrassed?” I’m not saying you have to bring what you consider “meme” specs, nor am I the one attacking those that do or enjoy them. What I’m saying is there is no reason for people to /not/ bring them. I keep replying because I enjoy discussion and debate.
---
He plays to his strong points. Smart guy.
---
No this won't work in classic, as Pservers had nearly 99% incorrect data.
---
That why i was always alliance, was like that even on private server, there is more horde player than want to pvp because of their racial, so enjoy your 15 min queue when mine is instant :P
---
Loved knocking people down on UC elevators. If you time it right and they are late you can knock them down when the elevator starts going down and they fall to their deaths. Or of course you can also make them miss the elevator.
---
reroll alliance for instant queue then
---
Been doing this for hours. Smacking them into Van is funny as hell too 🤣
---
It'll subside once people get the rep they need
---
They're looted from snow piles scattered all around Alterac Valley! Mostly on top of mounds and near trees it seems
---
GW1 was a fucking masterpiece
---
Co GM of an alliance guild disbanded guild during a Sulfuron Hammer craft, cancelled the craft and made off with the hammer mats and guild bank. He defended himself by claiming all sorts of things about the loot council being corrupt (highly believable if you knew them) and added some great fuel to the drama bonfire.
---
Arugal has the best drama.
---
Exactly
---
Assuming you can even find 15 ret paladins that are raid ready, that will raid in the same schedule and agree to be on the same core (and thus  share loot) and that somehow will not interfere with other class requirements for whatever content you are running, then if you start wiping for poor DPS it might be sane to split the core in two or see if any players are willing to change spec. Not before that wall has been reached.
---
Got a green hat from Gandling in Scholo and a red hat from the cannonman in Strat live.  Both bosses were wearing hats when we pulled them.
---
You can probably do jump runs.
---
Very good keybind, yes.
---
*laughs in 1600+ ambush*
---
Reroll the cowards faction? For real?
---
You cant que BGs as a group?
---
Sounds like the real issue was the GM.
---
Heartseeker here, apparently "Monarchy" is a newnazi guild on the Ally side. As a fellow Ally, I encurage horde to kill and camp them with /clap and /cheer
---
What about Pre-Raid Best in Slot 60 rogue?
---
The average raider now is late 20s early 30s. So yeah shaving off 30 minutes to an hour helps them. We have a ret pally. He heals if we have less than 6 healers. He can roll on loot. If we get to BWL and he slows us down too much that we cant do MC and BWL in one day he's going to have to spec holy so we have another dps take his slot. We only have one day we can raid so he accepts his fate if it comes to it.
---
Ya'll have a wide definition for "fine". All hybrids do much worse dps. Can you clear MC with Rets,ENH, and Boomkins? Yeah. Can you clear MC, BWL, and ZG in one day with them in a 5 hour raid? No.
---
You say it pays to be honest and stand by your principles but literally the only one who lost anything here is you.
---
Thank you god. This is a great PSA
---
The alliance does the same thing but worse
---
HOW DARE YOU
---
34 is too young?
---
Not AV in vanilla
---
I just want to see the resultant DPS charts
---
Hunters bring trueshot aura.
---
AV isn't going anywhere though, you have plenty of time to get rep. Take a break from AV and do something else :)
---
Not AV
---
These kinds of debuff have very low priority for the most part and will be pushed off easily for more important debuffs.
---
What level are you? For leveling, I’d suggest going down Feral to Feline Swiftness, then over for Omen Of Clarity. Even with Travel form at 30 it’s just too good. I also like getting Improved Thorns for leveling because I tank a lot of dungeons on my journey.
---
As far as rotation for tanking:
---
Maul is your primary threat generator, and it should be used exclusively on one to two mob pulls, as it’s more more effective at keeping Aggro.
---
Swipe is only REALLY good at getting initial threat on three mobs. As you start getting hit harder and having more crit, you’ll be able to tab between mobs and maul and swipe each one. It works great.
---
Larger pulls you start having to throw out a demo roar and just tab swiping. Luckily you’ll have enough crit built into your build that you can swipe indefinitely in those situations. (Rage from critical strikes + damage taken is enough)
---
As far as DPS goes: Furor talent and a Wolfshead Helmet is your bread and butter. Download an energy timer add on, I can’t recommend one as I don’t play DPS. You should (when possible) dump your energy with Shred, and at 4/5 Combo Points add in a Ferocious Bite. Whenever you run out of Energy, quickly swap out of, and back into Cat form and dump your energy again. You should do the swap right before the energy ticks back up, as you’ll swap into form with 80 Energy.
---
I loved shamans in PvP too. We finally got some 'spammables', we were less reliant on RNG. It was great. And you still had options in PvP, you could play 2h or dual wield.
---
Lmao no its not. Anger management is literal noob trap and if you cant see how and are trying to argue that talents are "based on preference" you should not be trying to make a guide, plain and simple.
---
Cry more, Im the guy that got 10+ people to recall back to wipe ally on D when everyone was trying to zerg and now I see it everywhere, Horde wins 9/10 with this now.
---
Score!
---
Yea good luck trading the 2g useless blacksmithing recipe (totally not salty) for the 200g super profitable frost power recipe
---
Then you were doing it wrong. 60 2hander is just proc = kill, no proc = no kill while 70 sham was more reliable with more tools to fight all classes. You just had more options, you could even play 70 with two hander if you want.
---
“Clearly the solution is &lt;thing that will obviously just make the problem worse&gt;“
---
Come to netherwind and try raiding IF , won't be so easy. If your on a horde dominant realm then its a whole different ballgame. Horde get camped all the time by ally on my server because they have the numbers, simple as that
---
I feel that man, hope it helps!
---
You are probably just a faker horde, an alliance player at heart. Us real horde destroy the alliance lamos.
---
Reddit is no longer a safe space
---
We pally bubble pull gar, and the tanks pick up there shit asap. Shouldn’t be hard. Can mage pull too with ice block
---
I swear to ~~god~~ all that is unholy if a pally puts their filthy, grubby little light "blessed" hands on my Azuresong Mageblade I'm gonna drop an infernal on Light's Hope Chapel
---
I have no clue what that could mean.
---
The jump in price wasn't as much as I thought it would be.  I was holding onto the eggs as I leveled alts and had about 120.  I was able to sell them for 20 silver each, so about 24 gold total.  
---
I mean it's better than a poke in the stick with a sharp eye, but not as much as I was hoping for.
---
corpse camp this cringe out of the game
---
Did you read the comment you replied to? At all? Also, just curious but why did you accent the u in Super Bowl lol
---
Cause it’s fun to step on bugs
---
In any team based RPG you do what you can for the team. As you usually do in any team based game or sport. Just by going ret you're already breaking that principle.
---
Be glad that someone lets you play the way you want, by taking loot from your highest parsing classes is just putting  another strain on your raid.
---
Dual wield is to strong right now because of how heroic strike works. If you have a macro that ques and cancels heroic strike your offhand doesn't miss. So you have insane rage generation.
---
I rolled for it and almost got it... And you know what? I'll do it again! I'm gonna rub my filthy holy fingers all over your pretty lil mageblade
---
Well what are you waiting for?
---
carebears will never get it dude. you get it, he doesn't.
---
not enough loot to go around. wont be ready to clear bwl and onward when you are rolling off good gear to someone who will replace it in a month instead of the guy who will have it for a year  
---
is it fair? no. It's just the truth
---
Thanks for sharing

URL is off the top of my head. It's data from player input but sees the whole population rather than only the raid scene that ironforge bases it's population data on.
---
I have an addon called bump. Which totals all the gold and rep I gained In dungeons or BGs and informs me when I zone out.
---
So now there's a class requirement? That sounds like some min/maxing to me. That's some elitist shit right there.
---
then enjoy the 15 min queue :P. If you think i am alliance because It s my choice u r 100% wrong, Cannibalize on a destro lock make such a difference in BG. BUT I cannot stand the queue. So I am a human lock that can see rogue and dot them to get them out of stealth instead
---
thats a racism

You can see him shift into zerker, but it's just too late.

What more tools? Elementals you couldn't use in arena? Enhance got a mana regen shamanistic rage and that's it. Burst was basically the only reliable way to kill people without any other tools. Later on when you actually had lava lash, maelstrom, and wolves you had more tools. You didn't have those in TBC. And considering the gear scaling differences between vanilla and TBC, using an outdated 10 level below current weapon I shouldn't be beating raid weapons from current content.
---
Generic blanket statements don't allow you to win a 1v10 where you are the 1. If you play on an alliance dominant server then you will die to them, a lot. Playing on a horde dominant server is EZ mode pvp, no challenge at all. Go roll on an alliance dominated server and let me know how the 1v10s are going. 
---
And to answer, I played horde back in retail. Never played alliance. I am horde all the way. Never would play alliance
---
There's also [good reason not to take the evidence presented at face value](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/proof-for-fixing-changes-to-the-talent-reckoning/388589/32).

Alt 1-2-3 are pretty nice.  Left/Right middle mouse  button are great binds if your mouse has the functionality and turns into 8 binds with shift/ctrl/alt modifiers.
---
Swords, easy decision
---
people are misremembering. private servers added things like lotus drops and mine nodes to AV .
---
Nah it would be fucking hilarious to raid with 15 Rets sign me up for that
---
I think you might be wrong about that. I agree the shit's expensive, but it's BiS, so hey.
---
And how is the weakest player supposed to get good gear if nobody lets them have it because they’re the weakest?
---
I'd take salvation over anything a enhancement shaman can do.
---
&gt;Funny, I don't remember calling anyone a prick, or telling them there was something "wrong with them" because of the way they and 39 other people choose to play the game.
---
Well I don't do prick-like things so it wouldn't make any sense for you to call me one.
---
&gt; Enjoy your multi day partial pug mc clears and inevitable wall of non progression in any actual challenging content.
---
I remember the last time I did a partial clear like the second week I raided nearly three months ago.  Also challenging content in vanilla top kek.
---
So did Grom and the Warsong not drink from the blood of Mannoroth then kill Cenarius who was a key obstacle in the legions way?
---
Yeah that makes sense. Our tanks always play fury prot there's no real reason not too, you can always equip a shield if you need it. You gain very little from going past defiance in the prot tree.
---
What race was it that attracted the demons and tried to summon Sargeras resulting in the first cataclysm and destroying the well of eternity?  Elves?  Yeah.
---
Neither faction is the good guys or bad guys.  They've both committed atrocities and both have sacrificed nobly to save Azeroth.
---
Nope, just molars.
---
oral cumshot? yeah, that fits
---
Lol ok. Big guy over here rolling up on some level 10 alliance. I guarantee you cannot 1v10 lvl60s unless they are ridiculously bad. Sounds like you don't have a lot of game knowledge. Classic is probably your first time playing wow. So every AV you go in alliance has never won and gets 0 honor each time? I'm sure.
---
Right now ive got him by a good bit. Ill post when done
---
How about it? What’s your question?
---
"Comprehensive"
---
Our biggest drama these days is when we see an Alliance player roaming around...
---
It;s not inconsistent. They have Tank &gt; Dps &gt; Healer prio and let ret dps roll on dps items. Mageblade is a dps item before a healing item, and I wouldn't actively roll on onslaught as a ret even though I am able to if warriors still needed for MS.
---
Let me guess your lvl 60 and your 1v10 all the people questing  in a leveling zone gg your such a big man.
---
Throw me some numbers
---
&gt;well then it's time to piss off the casters and get a mageblade lol
---
The whole point of this is to get a weapon with a spell proc ...
---
They press frostbolt more than 3 times on fights in raid im sure
---
Does that seem viable over vis'kag mh / mirahs song (or better) in PVE
---
Eh, if the rogue is trying to deadzone a warrior the window between trink and intercept is near zero. And generally by this point against a rogue, they've already cycled through most of their lock and are trying to evasion to close things out. Blind's probably been used, likely in response to a zerker rage, already.
---
And speaking from experience, the number of rogues who get me low through a full prep rotation and then fall over during evasion is *very high*.
---
Damn the amount of people forgetting they're playing a RPG here, what have you unleashed
---
To be fair you are right, until we start wiping on harder content.
---
For now it's minutes, in the future every wipe below say 5% is entirely because of our theoretical wheelchairs.
---
In bgs cat form get it rough. Rogues have a hard time surviving and cats are like rogues without the escapes. 
---
Bears are ok but not very threatening. The best classes for group pvp are casters.
---
Boomkin or resto will give you the best results.
---
Last I checked the Highborn who summoned the legion aren't in the Alliance (they join the Horde later) but the Warsong are still in the Horde.
---
yeah. it’s unfortunate that it’s not a +40 spw like the shadow one as 15spw pails in comparison. still a highly sought recipe and will be used. ALSO suck asssssss that wintersbite has a SUPER low spawn area and so that will prob be a festered zone or an expensive herb/pot

&gt;If your time is that tight a) you won't be clearing all the content in all likelihood so it's no worries in any case and b) you probably shouldn't be raiding or expecting much from it. What exactly are you going to do when ZG and AQ comes out?

We'll be clearing it in one day because we will have an optimal group to spend our limited time with. I'll make sure to send all the hybrids you're way since you're so accomidating.

When you mitigate a 100 damage hit by 66% you take 34, not 44.
---
Seems like you're the one that needs to get over it. Let people do whatever they want
---
Why pallies don't need hit?(horde player here)
---
You act like there are any alliance as hardened and strong as us horde. The alliance are weak and only flee when they see the might of me and my guild. Darkshire is abandoned quickly when we destroy the alliance there.
---
It's NOT BIS. If YOU aren't sure why are you arguing that it is?
---
Stop using wowhead for BIS lists, the ret one is HORRID. Crown has MORE AP than lionheart, you do NOT need the hit as a ret paladin from lionheart(you need 3% hit from gear when using a 2h sword or mace).

---
I am a human but BRE has 10dps more than OEB and I don't know how that compares to +8 wep skill. 
---
I know wep skill has a diminishing return effect so to speak so Humans get less benefit from additional wep skill on items.
---
This is correct.  DPS warriors want like 4 things from MC that arent weapons.
---
If you do horde quests during the leveling journey, its really clear that Horde are the bad guys. Period.
---
Sure, Alliance committed some atrocities, but it was in response to Horde invasion or betrayal or outright slaughtering Alliance folk.

Or anything from exalted WSG. Like no ty

---
2 months ago it was discovered that Prot Paladins are basically the best 40-man raid tanks in the game right now thanks to the previously-unknown mechanic of Greater Blessing threat generation. This means that Paladins can gear up exclusively for mitigation and never lose aggro because their "taunt" is a friendly buff that never gets resisted.

That's some straight bullshit luck.

1. Yes, the addon SuperMacro.

2. " " NugEnergy
---
3. Yes, but I don't know it off-hand. Google will know.
---
4. For Rogue, iirc, it's 9% for PvE, 4% for PvP. But it's not wasted after because poisons use spell hit, and auto attacks need more.
---
5. Get either TMW or WeakAuras2 for specific cooldowns/buffs/debuffs, but general buffs most UI mods will do it.
---
6. Keybinds are entirely up to what is comfortable for you. Shift/ctrl are best for me, but might not be for you. Don't use other people's binds. You should invest in an mmo mouse if you can, that'll net you another 19 buttons at your fingertips (multiplied further by shift/ctrl/alt).
---
WoW was competing with EQ2, not EQ1.
---
EQ1 was brutally, brutally outrageously fucking difficult, had pvp griefing (you could steal shit from dead people), with raids that went for hours and hours and by 2004 the gfx looked awful. I had a friend addicted to that game when I was in my early 20s (like the dude was playing 12 hours a day and stopped showering and when I'd call him saying I'm going out, his mother would literally give us money to do anything but videogames and he'd shower, she'd shove him out the front door, lock it, and toss his clothes out the window lol). I tried it a few times, and I don't get it. The raids were literally like 12 hours long and people would fall asleep during them, not because they were bored but because their bodies were failing lol.
---
The gfx in EQ2 at the time were the opposite problem, they required a very, very high end PC and they basically did what WoW Classic is doing to WoW retail, they split their own fanbase in half.
---
It's the first game I remember that happening. A lot of EQ players jumped to CoH, SW: Galaxies, and WoW. There were some other big SOE ones too for a while like Matrix Online. A lot of the SOE MMORPGs played similarly. Then Guild Wars came out in 2005 and there were a bunch of KRPGs starting in 2008-09
---
Contrary to what many people are saying, Warcraft was a relatively weak IP compared to a lot of what was out there. SW: Galaxies and Matrix Online had really strong brands associated.
---
WoW launch was terrible. It was not an immediate success like people like to say now. I thought the game would last under a year and just went back to CoH, which at the time was a much better game with about the same size community. They fixed WoW, and kept fixing it, but it launched rough. The mechanics have always been fairly mediocre to compared to other games in the genre.
---
PETA would have rounded them all up and killed them at their HQ! Hurray for an 80%+ kill rate!

---
Only one person can be rank 14 a week and doubt only 53 people are truly vying for it on each server.
---
I flew over this today... what’s that all about?
---
None of the pvp gear is PvE BiS for warriors by AQ.   The shoulders are damn good and some of the pieces are very close though.
---
"So then I said 'Molar? I hardly knew her!'"

Ya undercity is cool looking but kinda hard to navigate

Dude, buy some eggnog, it's amazing.
---
Ah, children do so enjoy mindless repetition don't they?
---
It must be wonderful to see the world through your eyes.
---
Thought it was 12 per wk?
---
I mean duh?  The horde genocided (genocide! Even the children), their own world, then tried on ours twice.  Then destroyed their own world escaping justice.  Yeah, they were under demon bloodlust.  Demon bloodlust they accepted and reveled in.  Btw, that excuse is absolutely akin to a drunk driver who just killed some kid saying they aren't responsible cause they were drunk.  
---
But anyway.  The alliance races, who would have been well within their rights to exterminate the invaders who tried to mass murder them, twice, instead spare them.  In return for this act of near saintlike mercy, the horde murder alliance races constantly and also ally with the blatantly evil Forsaken.  
---
Thousands and thousands and thousands of innocent humans dwarves and elves dead because we didn't give child killing demon worshiping invading orcs to death.  Because we believed they could be better.  
---
Turns out they couldn't.  Daelin did nothing wrong.
---
Horde were, are, and always will be the baddies.  Except Tauren.  You cowfolk are alright.
---
PS: almost every horde city is named after a genocidal homicidal monster even horde themselves have to put down like the rabid, demonic, evil monsters they are.  Kargath.  Orgrimmar.  Your next city will probably be named Garroshmar at this rate.  Not like you have anyone who isn't shit to name it after.  And even if you did, you wouldn't, because you revel in evil.
---
It depends on server population but I’ve heard it’s roughly 1 per 2500 people ranking.
---
A couple people can get r13 each week but that is still a hefty goal
---
Hahaha sick gl
---
&gt; Being right doesn't make me immature
---
I've played my account in multiple states and countries. Never had a problem.
---
And unless you have 4 holy pallies that ret brings a blessing
---
I will swap to a shield and often dstance when I know a rogue is around, and run blood craze. That's a lot of mitigation - easily 35% less damage taken compared to normal, and a heal ticking through the whole thing.
---
With spell batching it can be pretty easy to slip a demoshoit between parts if the rotation and deny the reset + further mitigate, too.
---
&gt;Is there a way to create longer macros than 255 characters? I have my travel/waiting for wsg gear and I’d like to just create a macro to switch between outfits. 
---
Not that I am aware of. However there are addons like Outfitter and Itemrack that does this for you. 
---
&gt;Is there a Rogue mod so I can see when my energy ticks? 
---
Yes. There are many. I recommend downloading the addon called "WeakAuras 2" of curseforge. This addon basically functions as an additional "addon language", where you can download and install mini addons very quickly that does literally anything you want. Search on  [https://wago.io/classic-weakauras](https://wago.io/classic-weakauras)  there are so much good stuff there.
---
&gt; Is there a macro to simply un-equip an item without having to equip a different item? 
---
Macro not that I know of, but with itemrack you can open your character menu and hover an item slot and pick what you should change to or unequip. 
---
&gt; What % do you want your chance to hit to be at? I’ve read that there’s an ideal % for different classes. For example, as a rogue would I try to aim for + 9% chance to miss or? 
---
Depends on what you are doing.
---
For PVP you want 5% hit as a physical damage dealer, 3% as caster.
---
For raiding you want either 6% if you have 305 weapon skill with your weapon(which as a rogue you should from combat tree), or 9% if you are at 300. However this is just the minimum hit you should have, going above is okay and still gives benefits at around 0.6-0.7 of 1% crit  
---
&gt;I’d like to be capable of seeing when a sap or poly effect is going to wear off without targeting the player. Like a bar showing the duration or something on their character model, same with dots &amp; ETC. 
---
There's a brilliant weakaura for this. It puts your debuffs on the nameplate here's the link: [https://wago.io/4je3fCkT3/2](https://wago.io/4je3fCkT3/2)   Btw when you get these weakauras you simply go to the website, press "Copy weakaura string", then you go into game and type /wa , press "new"  and under External you press "import" and paste it in, then you get some options to change the position and stuff but that's about it, takes 10 seconds when you get used to it.
---
&gt; So, I’ve started to run out of keybindings… I was wondering what do the majority of people use for their keybindings? 
---
Personally I use a MMO mouse(12 buttons on the side), and then I just use ctrl/shift/alt modifers and a few keys close to W-A-D. I use my pinky finger for both shift and ctrl, and my thumb (which normally rests on spacebar for jump) for alt. My alt keybinds are typically stuff I don't need to use in "intense combat"
---
Then he sucks or his gear is garbage. Nothing can out threat a fury/prot warrior except another dps.
---
Hey, I was in the city while you were doing this and it was so cute. Thanks for spreading cheer!
---
For me its rank 11 or 12 or bust.   The blue pvp gear is pretty much outclassed already.
---
Reminds me of TBC arenas where hunters would name there pets the same name as themselves (or was it their arena healer partner) to confuse focus macros for counter spell and possibly gladius addon.
---
I got one of those too. If you want i can tell you how the reduce the number size.
---
rank 11 mounts did not require Riding skill (1) of other reputations . I hit rank 11 on vanilla and still have all the pvp mounts to this day.
---
Grab em by the zug zug
---
I had R13 druid on Nost (Coathanger) and it was maybe the most tedious grind of my life. In 2004 I was r12 on my rogue but went to a festival and my guild told me they would 'grind me some honor while I was away' but I came back and had dropped to r11 1%. The second time around on my druid I was devoted flag runner and ran the premade for a while. When BWL came out I tanked Nef and then called it quits.  I still keep up with some of the friends I made grinding and wonder what happened to the rest of the guys. I got to play against a lot of the guys in NOPE who are doing worldfirsts and they kept us on our toes. They must have thought I was an asshole running the flag as a feral tank.
---
Trying isn't gay, but doing that to yourself for pixels in a 15 year old game is stupid.  Plus you'll be going up against people that either bot or share accounts.  So unless you're willing to cheat to get it, you won't achieve your goal.
---
The Cowfolk did nothing wrong.
---
Except for those dratted Grimtotem. Screw those guys.
---
copy.
---
paste.
---
Get mad
---
&gt; Dual wield spec is 25% increase to offhand damage.
---
Yeah but it's multiplicative not additive. 50% base damage times 125% results in 0.625. Rogues have it better since their dual-wield spec gets them to 0.75 (50% extra damage).
---
This is what AV is when you dont get a game that rushes to end:
---
Horde spawned the boss in a game that went off the rails. Did Alli just let the boss push in and end the game? No, they kept attacking it one at a time letting Horde just farm them for no reason. Conversely, did the Horde use the distracted Alli to just go to the boss and end the game? Nope, they stood near the ice ele and farmed kills. The game has an objective, but players either dont care or they lose focus of the goal at any moment.
---
AV really sucks when there isnt a mechanic in place the more or less forces a win at some point. Sitting around doing nothing for an hour isnt fun. Going afk and then literally wasting 15 mins doing nothing isnt fun.
---
Vendor your deathbringer, you'll never use it as human.
---
“People are making alts to trade fangs. Is this bannable?”
---
As a level 60 undead rogue, this is completely accurate.
---
Hey! I was your healer for this group! So glad you got redeemed haha! Was fun running with you.
---
This is exactly what I was asking about. Thanks!
---
Vis is bad OH, Brut blade is better.

Killing tree  
---
Oh killing tree  
---
How bloody you are ....
---
Thing is, they do. By the time your warriors need to have it, they all will.
---
Thanks for reminding me why I don't raid.
---
How long you were at a festival? You decay 50% of a rank per week, max.
---
Really sucks being r12 and not reaching r13. Just half the epic set, damn.
---
R14 grind is absolutely brutal but it's also quite optional even for minmaxers, since you'll end up replacing the weapons eventually.
---
Pretty sure the human racial 5 weapon skill = 1% hit.
---
I wonder if you could inject names into Spy like Black Lotus and then run around and when it sees a black lotus it would pop up in spy? Not sure how the add on works because honestly I despise it and won’t use it. But if you could abuse it that way it’d be interesting to see what would happen.
---
wellithoughtitwasfunny.jpg
---
Running out of keybindings!? Never heard of,.......I'm mage xD
---
If you are raiding and twisting having cast sequence macros is just better. To twist between goa and wf and one for wf and tranquil depending on the situation along with cast sequence macros for sets of totems.
---
I only have singular totems hotkey'd like tremor, eb, grounding and like fire Nova totem.
---
I am am kinda peeved that totemtimers isn't working atm because it was a ez mouseover and 1-5 press. More about the timer though instead of counting 9seconds on twisting for the windfury falls off in my head. Didn't like the other totem add ons that are out/ported into classic. 
---
Cause let's be honest if you are totem twisting full on you don't have alot of Mana leftover to be doing a whole lot other than. Like shocking or ss periodically.
---
Back to retail you go
---
It's 1 per 333 ranking people actually, assuming perfect brackets, 0.3%
---
The Wowhead and other BiS lists for ret are notoriously bad and filled with a lack of information.
---
Case and point is that if you look at the Ret BiS lists against others you'll notice a lack of "Optional" gear where as the warrior is filled with not only 3-4 optional pieces for each slot but gives you a breakdown of 2handed Warr dps vs 2x1handed dps.
---
As for Lionheart. Is it good? Yes. But is it needed? No. The reason /u/Penguinbashr is saying its not BiS is because if you actually compare Lionheart to Crown of Destruction. Lionheart actually loses.  
---
Lionheart Helm - 565 armor / +18 STR (1STR=2AP so ***+36AP***) /  +2% Crit / +2% Hit  
---
Crown of Destruction - 392 armor / +23 STA / +9 INT / +9 SPT / +10 FR / +44 AP / +2% CRIT  
---
Now for any 2handed DPS class you need a Hit % of 8% to guarantee that you do not miss. Lionheart may have 2% Hit - But as a Raiding Ret you'll have 3% hit from talents on top of. Meaning you'll need to make up 5% hit somewhere.   
---
But if youre smart, you'll be playing Human Paladin as Ret - Giving you and extra +5 Expertise to Swords/Maces (2h &amp; 1h) giving you a max of 305 weaponskill. Which equates to roughly 3% hit on its own.  
---
So if youre a Human Ret Paladin Using a 2h Sword or Mace with 305 Weaponskill (3%hit) 8points in Prot (3% hit) you'll only need to make up 2% hit. Which could be done easily with either Truestrike Shoulders or  Battleborn Armbraces + Brigam Girdle.
---
Less people are playing but this is more saying the grind for rank 14 is nasty, i guess. You rank by having literally more hk's than others. So literally whoever is playing the most will get higher ranks. And when you have the kind of grinders we know gamers can be it's kind of insane how much the high ranked are playing.
---
Naa dude just edgy af.
---
Thanks guys,  Vis'kag and Brutality Blade it is.
---
theres a rogue on my server called "wait" so every time someone says to wait, my chat addon colours it yellow like a rogue
---
The real humor is that you’re using wowheads bis lists, 90% of them are inaccurate.
---
Yeah I figured it wouldn't be quicker but I enjoy fighting multiple mobs and I find it more enjoyable to level that way. (E.g. pulling multiple mobs while leveling as a warrior or using juggling tactics as a warlock.) So I was expecting it to be slower but more fun, I just wanted to make sure it wouldn't be unworkable.

The bracket you’re in determines the amount of ranking points you’ll get for that week. The higher the bracket, the more ranking points you’ll get. The top bracket gets 13k ranking points and each one below is 1k less. Take 80% of your current ranking points, because of weekly decay, and add the ranking points you’ll get from which bracket you are in. That’ll be your total amount of ranking points at the start of next week. Then look at the chart with the different titles/rewards and see which one you have the minimum rank points for and that’s where you’ll be.

At least you can get WSG gear eventually.
---
There are other ways to play WoW my like-minded friend
---
Huh I always thought you had to be #1 in the standings unless the server had a really high pop
---
Sigh. Yes. But.
---
That's 5% leeway gone.
---
So 5% more mistakes can be made.
---
More bm this way, but nah i have replaced it with my iron grenade keybind since then
---
Fyi /lfg and /lookingforgroup are two different channels, the latter being blizzard sanctioned.
---
Not a waste of time if you're having fun and doing turn ins.
---
Judging that this is my first time ever playing alliance, I'm pretty sure I'm familiar with horde tactics.
---
But enlighten us, why does it give horde motivation to lose quickly if they win the race rather then lose it? I'm curious of your reasoning.
---
A month in solitary for you sir
---
Heres what I do. Set f1 to skull f2 to X and f3 to moon (raid targets). This will give the dps a target order (skull first, then cross. Moon is if you have a mage and want them to poly something.)
---
I have a macro with /cast battle stance and /cast defensive stance set to my q key. That lets me jump between the two with a simple push of the q key.
---
You want the anger management skill under arms. This will give you extra rage regen and let you keep rage points when you switch between stances.
---
I start in battle stance, mark the mobs and charge in. I use thunderclap then hit q to switch to def stance. I have blood rage set to z and I pop that then use demoralizing roar (I have that set to 1). After 1-2 sunders on the main mob I switch to the secondary mob. Always use revenge first whenever it pops as its 1/3 the rage and good threat generator. If you have any stragglers use your taunt ability to grab threat back (remember taunt only works if you don't currently have aggro.) 
---
The casters are your number 1 priority. Most pulls will be 3-4 mobs. If your dps warr or enh shm or rogue pills aggro on 1 mob they will be ok for a few just as long as the other 3 are hitting you. 
---
My very simple tanking setup on my 50 warr is
---
Battle stance-
---
1 demo roar
---
2 hamstring
---
3 sunder
---
4 charge
---
5 thunderclap
---
Def stance-
---
2 revenge
---
3 shield block
---
4 sunder
---
5 taunt
---
6 disarm
---
7 the 5 second stun (concussion blow?)
---
Z blood rage
---
Q change stances
---
E battle shout
---
R shield slam
---
T execute
---
Aimed&gt;auto&gt;ms&gt;dead. Never gets old when all three crit and evaporate someone
---
Such negativity...it blows my mind. You ok man?
---
Thank God I hit exalted yesterday, waiting for 10-14 mins is just annoying.
---
True and that's why I roll on it haha
---
*cries in arms warrior*
---
that was a bug lol
---
Ho boy, that guy 10 levels higher than me sure taught me a lesson while I was at half health fighting other mobs
---
I read that thread every day. Learned a ton.
---
Aren't there Qs that have you kill players?
---
&gt;I think I lucked out with the guild I have though, fair loot council but you don't have to play 20+ hours a week to get loot either
---
Lol wtf, barely any guild has "play 20+ hours a week" requirements. A guild with two raid nights is between 6-8hrs total, and let's say another hour for basic consumable farming
---
R14 gear is 100% not BIS for dps warriors compared to Naxx40 gear
---
&gt;Like, if you're gunning for server firsts and speedrunning, power to you. But that feels like a wasted activity in a game where people figured everything out a while ago.
---
It feels like you think that simply because someone knows what is good that means they can't get fun out of it. I don't think you've ever done speed running before. Nor do I think you realize just how much optimization you could be doing. 
---
Like if you think that most of your dps/healing/tanking comes from your gear than you are thinking about this game all wrong. At least on PvE side. I've been able to get easily over 500 dps with 70+ parses in 6 pc shadowcraft. It comes from consumes and enchants. You enchant your gear, which enchants you need could change as you gear up, and you farm up the consumes you need. So for my rogue I have a pretty long list:
---
* Juju Power
---
* Juju flurry
---
* Thistle Tea
---
* Grilled Squid
---
* Dragonbreath Chili
---
* Winterfall Firewater/Juju Might
---
* Elixir of the Mongoose
---
* Grilled Scorpok Assay/R.O.I.D.S
---
* Elixir of Fortitude
---
That's not even counting gnomish battle chicken which I have yet to make. And really the big thing for me is making sure I have all these up and for Thistle Tea and Juju Flurry it is matter of timing those so that I don't waste the consume mid-fight. Not to mention maintaining positioning and making sure to know when to just auto and when to really chuck dps and when to not dps at all depending on the fight and threat wiping/dropping mechanics. And with rogue on horde side or with HoJ you have to plan out when to spam your sinister strike/Backstab so that it comes immediately after an auto so that way extra attacks that could proc don't interrupt your swing timer. 
---
But yeah if you just want to go up to bosses get combo points, slice and dice at 5, eviscerate at 5 and rinse and repeat, then you can have fun doing that. I won't knock you for it. But if you think that there isn't more depth for you (and I've only been talking for 1 class with 1 role), or that it couldn't be fun or engaging because the content is figured out/easy, then I'm going to have to strongly disagree.
---
Well yeah its just a title.
---
imagine playing a dps class that does less dps than a shaman
---
Yep. They use lfg as a world chat. When there literally is a world chat. I hate those people so much. They get reported for spam very frequently. 
---
If you ask them to go to world chat they say it's dead. No shit because everyone is in lfg. Migrate over and others will.
---
Classic servers are much bigger than "really high pop" vanilla servers.
---
If you and a whole raid party all que for the same server all synchronized and shit it worked in vanilla till the end of tbc
---
This is on Earthshaker EU :)
---
it was mr dragons fondest moment too. he got a promotion
---
Good guys, bad guys, don’t matter. Rest in rip you silly blue guy.
---
Just simmed it and deathbringer was still behind.
---
Dude I agree with you 100%. For the Alliance!
---
It was almost a guarantee that Germs was going to kill you in Kargath if you stuck around long enough.
---
100gph if you’re amazing at it and don’t make any mistakes. I make about 20-30g per reset vendoring and on a really good day I can get 4 resets in almost an hour but it’s usually closer to 3
---
Looks like someone better have gotten their healing outside
---
BB gives 1% crit, 9str and 9agi. Vis'kag does 240 damage on a very low proc rate. BB is worth about 30dps more.
---
My day-1 guild that would exist for ages died in a month. I was 1way for a week and the guild wznt from 50 members online to me alone.
---
Oh yeah that's how I expected it to apply. I just thought you were saying that there's zero talents that benefit dw exclusively, but yeah its marginal so I get what you're saying.
---
The fact that the game is 15 years old is completely irrelevant.
---
Some jerk on whitemane horde named their pet "devilsaur" so now whenever we are in orgrimmar at the same time my rare-scanner addon goes crazy pinging his pet.
---
I see you are a man of culture as well fellow dwarf pally.
---
then all the copy cat rogues showed up
---
Sounds like he did.
---
But the key part is that they open trade, that's what's important
---
Reminds me of the time in sunken temple when we were fighting the dragons I got knocked up into the air and fell into the sacrificial hole. Everyone called me PGA Tour Andy afterwards :-:
---
Welcome to every pvp server that ever existed, just part of the game
---
&gt;sorry only a very few will get rank 14
---
Do you understand R14? There could be hundreds of R14s on any server within a year.
---
I haven't down voted your comments :)  
---
Edit: 99% just seems very high. A lot of us here played on private servers; and while some were terribly off - some of them were great and are the reason that classic is now getting smashed through at record rates. There will have been a large amount of errors but enough of it was correct to allow players to carry their private server metas into classic with success.
---
Earthshaker is pretty close to perfect balance and also highly populated.
---
Results in point hoarding and disenchanting upgrades that people don't want to spend points on.
---
Horde dont deserve any trees. Just sayin.
---
thank you &amp; i completely agree.. i plan to use for pvp only. just making sure im not going crazy when the other rogues are claiming this an an upgrade to their viskag for pve
---
Mana spring totem is beyond worthless. You have to stand by it for like 10 seconds or something just to get the mana you spent on it back.
---
You can use it in PvP Fury is realy Not that Bad espacially against casters Like warlock or priest. Weoponskill doesnt Matter in pvp
---
If you run WSG premades all day every weekend, you might be able to get that gear by the time Naxx comes out. Rank 14 though...
---
corpse camp till he drops it
---
Seems to be asking horde to stop turtling so that more alliance play AV and thus reduces horde queue time. Not too sure what ya had trouble with there but hopefully this explains it adequately for you.
---
Truestrike and mask of the unforgiven are the only ones I can think of besides Devilsaur. Kinda stops being a thing after pre-raid BiS except for the 24 str leather bracers in MC.
---
I'm referring to to the blizzard one
---
As an Orc, it feels like Hardiness is bugged or something. I never resist stuns, it's insane.
---
Yeah but when he dies his corpse turns back into cow form
---
We all do. But something no one should do is following all these damn YouTubers telling you you need this and that, only to realize you don't even like to farm x and y. Do what's fun god damnit
---
Crown is better for pvp
---
If you don't by the time you're exalted, it's not BiS anymore
---
i mean its the alliances strat i dont see why they would downvote it if the horde caps everything they are suppose to then it doesnt matter if alliance downs Drek first or not
---
Snowballs FTW
---
How do i become a gnome in santa costume?
---
Which ones are better tho
---
First off I'd always suggest that you get a ui addon the blizzard ui is kinda terrible, but if I remember correctly you should have the ability itself which can be keybinded
---
...that's not griefing
---
You can’t de all the bop blues you get soloing bosses on your main if you rely on a bank alt.
---
 If you have a character whose primary job is to solo dungeons for money, you should go enchanting.
---
Lmao
---
Reading comprehension is hard for you I guess. I asked what the POINT of it is, not what is he saying. I can read the words in the post, I'm wondering why he made a thread to say it.
---
Don’t feed the troll...
---
Trust me it'll be fine
---
Weird flex, but okay
---
should be listed as SpecialActionBar or something in keybinds
---
Albion online where you make up your own story haha
---
His point is to try and get horde to stop turtling for faster queues ...
---
Want to know too
---
Short answer: They can't ban the addon because all it does is read the combat log.  
---
  
---
Longer answer: Good players kept their combat log open and could see the information Spy is telling them anyway. The only thing that's changed is that now people don't have to do that and instead get a nice little noise to let them know. It's a quality of life thing and can be entirely played around as a stealth class.
---
Mage is legit one button. Most other classes are also extremely simple, with only a few buttons they have to press regularly.
---
I'd bet money you haven't touched Naxx.
---
1. I used to HoTs and back to cat form when i was around 35% hp. When you wait to get some energy you get healed.
---
2. Its awesome. Pull without going into humanoid, form, constant threat generation when tanking. And avoid rogue’s vanish (it’s important now lol)
---
3. It depends. before lvl 60 maul tab was best, and using swipe when you have some extra rage and more than 3 targets. Always get your FF on cd too, that will help.
---
4. Opening with tiger’s fury + ravage + FF its great, mobs will be like half hp, just claw and FB and its dead.
---
Quest mob here, yep.
---
Grind BRD for XP and loot. When you get to lvl57 you can do WPL and EPL as well as Strat/Scholo.
---
By the time I was lvl 54 on my warrior, I had several good people in my friend list and it was very easy to put groups together.
---
I agree, I like to think I don't really have a bias in this case because I think the Horde and the Alliance are cool for their own reasons regardless of the morality of their actions. With that said the Horde are the bad guys, I struggle to see how anyone believes they aren't. 
---
Along those lines, although changing the topic slightly, you could look at the goals of the Alliance and the Horde in contrast. The Alliance wants to bring order and unity to the world so as to combat the threat of the Burning Legion. The Horde wants to band together to protect themselves from anything that threatens them. Whilst there isn't a conflict of morality it does give you perspective as to the priorities of each faction, the Alliance wants to protect the world, the Horde only cares about itself. This isn't a good argument to whether one is good or not, but I do find it interesting.
---
Not sure - as far as i know that is the case but im sure someone who knows will confirm
---
wow imagine if your bags were full
---
Why
---
We had an add-on in Wildstar that would have a line leading to objectives or treasures on the map, such as Discoveries, and scientists would name their scanbot Discovery to fuck with it
---
Flamelash.
---
No kid, you got it all wrong. I'm the reason classic even exists in the first place.
---
And Geoff. Don’t forget Geoff.
---
I was thinking the same thing, i was so close to having a full bag.
---
No, they don't have top teeth either
---
Honestly, by the pace of content releases, a r14 factory guild will have a raid team decked out in r14 gear in time for BC to nerf the costs by revamping the system.
---
Yo, chill bro
---
The concept was covered above, 12 hours ago... I don’t think it’s as beneficial for something like Maraudon, for example, considering the abundance of herb/mineral nodes.
---
It's a either a low or trash tier debuff. It won't push off anything important.
---
The comment sections on wowhead.
---
I switched at 40. Early 40s is fine I think
---
 #NPCToo
---
My guild gave Bonereaver's Edge to a ret pally that bid over the Raid lead warrior, for 159 DKP.
---
The Rag neck went for 233 that same night.
---
Install questie, then you'll see what quests you still can do
---
Quest item: *imma not here*.
---
Lots of players are rolling alts now. I suspect most of those people are grinding out BG rep and might be pushing PvP ranks but there's no shortage of people leveling out in the world.
---
I came back after quitting in Cataclysm and not playing since. I'm having a blast.
---
Remap the special action keys. I use the extra buttons on my mouse to swap stances so I can always do it at a moments notice.
---
it might've been, idk I leveled 52-60 in Brd doing gorshak with 59-60 only taking 5 hours
---
Also on every pvp server that ever existed: rogue comes out of stealth and instead of murdering you while you're low, he helps you kill the elite you've been trying to solo. Slaps you a /wave, and then dips out.
---
The difference? One rogue has fun being an ass hole, the other has fun being chill af. I can't tell you how to have fun or play the game, but I'm definitely gonna call a spade a spade, and you aren't doing yourself any favors being in denial.
---
Hey, the usual switch is around lvl 40+, you want to have 31 talents to make sure you can pop the double crit off elemental mastery. So starting 40 or mid 40's is your bet.
---
During vanilla there was no Russian servers at all, they started to be only at TBC. Dunno about premades, I saw some Russians in non-Russian teams (as well as full-Russian premades), but maybe something changed.
---
. . . and in my guild Bonereaver's edge went to the Ret pally for 159 DKP
---
Now this is the bite-sized news that I crave in the morning.
---
Unfortunately this is the only spot in AV that will actually kill some1 at 100% from fall dmg. However you can use the snowballs on drek and war masters right before they AoE. And knock them into the enemy healer/caster group. That's loads of fun
---
So you're telling me that an alliance player with a history of shit talking horde, who is already exalted in AV, made a thread in an aggressively charged format solely to give horde some helpful advice?  
---
No, the point of the thread is to talk shit. Me asking what the point is is rhetorical and I'm not sure if this is eluding you or if you're trolling.
---
977 games to get from neutral to exalted. 10 rep and 1 token per game.
---
Honestly your clear times don't matter to anyone but yourself. If you wanna pat yourself on the back for clearing in 30 mins good for you but it doesn't effect me and my guilds raid in any way. This isnt av we aren't racing.
---
All the tanks need to go in together, raid behind them. If your positioning isn't crazy bad all they have to do is walk forward, sunder or taunt their add on the way through (pop bloodlust to get rage on the pull countdown obviously).
---
Also, the Paladins and mage/lock don't get an upgrade until the same boss with Nef in BWL.
---
This or send in all the tanks at once.
---
I don’t think anybody says that
---
No one talking about OP's name, Maggotyann.
---
Nu... 🤷🏻
---
A rare remain of the arrow key breed (abilities on numpad)
---
I’m just here to say Maggotyann is a great name
---
It’s gonna be the difference between us clearing mc+bwl+aq on the same night while you raid 3 nights a week but sure, keep going with that attitude!
---
Yes, and use itemrack to equip your spirit weapons on evocate
---
Weakauras is an amazing tool but can be a bit difficult to set up.
---
Have you checkes www.wago.io if there is a wa for what you want? Its always easier to copy paste and edit rather than reinventing everything from scratch.
---
To import someone elses WA you copy the "string". In the addon ingame select new and add or import from string and paste the string there and press import.
---
When you have a WA you can always check its settings and play around with it and add/remove things thar are relevant to you.
---
My stances are: Battle stance on Q, Serker on E, macro (Prot+sword and board+interrupt) on Shif-T
---
I really should make macros for Battle and Serker stances as well.
---
It's very easy to stance dance, either by simple hotkey or by macro.
---
But you have to ruin your life to get them and they're really only useful in BWL and AQ. (AQ weapons are close enough to R14 weapons that they can carry you through Naxx progressions.)
---
Rank 14 gear is not practical for anyone except pro gamers or people with literally no life. WSG exalted items could be practical for your average player if they want to dedicate almost all of their game time to getting them
---
Rep? Your not already exalted? I got that shit 2 days ago as a horde.... Fucking casual.
---
Then Rattlegore took him in approximately 1.5 seconds.
---
UBRS is not considered a raid
---
Be glad its the OH shit drops every 5 runs
---
"Casuals picking wrong servers"
---
There were multiple large servers where horde took over major alliance cities and roamed in raids, camping corpses, flight points, and spirit healers indefinitely. This isn't people picking the wrong server, it's people going too far. No one could have expected the horde to be able to completely take over like that. 
---
Found the horse player.
---
Probably the ones in the class specific discords.
---
Yeah jist found the post of them talking about that
---
I do both, depends on my mood.
---
15+ and counting... that was the first since. Haven't seen it since about 10 runs before these 15 where I gave it to a guild because I wanted him to complete his set.
---
That was thousands of years before humans crawled out of the dirt in Arathi. There was no "alliance" and there wasn't to be one for millennia. 
---
Whereas the horde was created on draenor a few years before they invaded azeroth for the sole purpose of invading azeroth. Oh and burning and killing the peaceful dranei who lived there. I think the word is "genocide". 
---
Imagine being both as confident, and as wrong, as you are. Woah.
---
Those crits don’t lie
---
We downed Kazzak, I was Master looter and got killed during fight, didn’t release. Boss died and all the loot went to need/greed. Everyone passed except me to then trade it to the people. Turns out world boss loot is not tradable for the normal two hours. I opened ticket and after 2days I got the answer that they don’t care although I had screenshots of it all. We could atleast roll the epic boe-s....
---
Had one drop off cannon master in strat as well.
---
It actually does work for blues.
---
But only in Molten Core.
---
But I've been where you are, or at least close by, Blizzard doesn't do ANYTHING for tickets, we were in a situation similar to yours, the person who got the loot put in a ticket, nothing happened. It took like 30 hours.
---
You tell me. I killed around 200 rebelling stonemasons instead of bringing them to jail. All because our nobility didn't wanted to pay Stormwind repair bills.
---
For outfits, just download the ItemRack addon. 
---
ClassicCharacterStats is another great one.
---
I only have a sample size of 140 runs but it worked out to every 5th run for OH for me. Reed was every 3rd run. MH took me all 140 runs.
---
Oh man..... fuck my story
---
This is disgusting.
---
the min maxing discords
---
warrior's fight club is extremely nice and even have "simcraft" up (dps spreadsheet) to offer personalized advice and etc.

Then rip it out before he dies.

Yeah blizzard doesn't count ubrs as raid
---
I saw 1337. Enough said.
---
I’d say the spellcrit is the bigger benefit to having int, and there’s also that 5% bonus int talent to consider, but your points have merit and I’m to lazy to crunch the numbers. *shrug* I can say that a lot of Paladins tend to drop off from lack of substantial loot though, which is a shame. Ah well, glad I switched to prot. ;P
---
Best of luck, sucks but be glad its a 17% drop rate and not 3%
---
Yep
---
Is that santa on the roof?

Thanks for sharing this, I went and modified mine to pollute the list with garbage data every broadcast.

Just report em to blizz with the proof?

Try not to get emotional about stuff like this.

Why did I read this in Bane's voice

People not opening with Ravage? Crits fairly often, taking mobs straight down to 50% hp

Feel like I missed an opportunity with that one 😮

The MH is 4.5 luckily. I'm still without hoj. It.just.wont.drop.  but I'm actually pretty hopeful ill get dal reds offhand tomorrow or the next day at the latest

This comment section is a true testament to how much y’all have grown up.
---
My guild looted the first one to a Ret, all the fury left the guild.
---
Arugal represent!
---
What you’re doing is unimportant, auction house or doing quests doesn’t matter. The TOS as I understand forbids third-party devices/virtual desktops that are not under your control, but remoting in to your own device should be ok.
---
Flamelash seriously needs horde.
---
Is someone going to die because they don't get the item?
---
Is this action going to actively cause another player to die or otherwise quit the game?
---
Come on dude, that's next level sad.
---
&gt; those are already bound to CTRL + number
---
Yeah. You can bind them to whatever you want.
---
&gt; So If I "accidently" change my stance because I want to use a skill, I lose rage. Or maybe I just have to learn...
---
Yep.
---
You just don't notice the stuns you resist, trust me
---
If you think that's anything of an edge outside of duels, then you're deluding yourself.
---
Proud of the little green boys. They figured out how to win in 15 minutes now. Turtles seem mostly dead.
---
There is a vendor that sells water and food, why are you entitling the time of the mages to yourself?
---
addon name?
---
IF you get decent DPS team , you can do BRD relative fast and you get plenty of exp.
---
da orkz use fangs to trade and they are doing fine in space
---
Not sure that's completely true, my guildie did this to fish and turn in quests and Blizzard gave him a 6 month suspension.
---
arena/anger/golem is decent exp if you clear at a good speed
---
Oh great, another way blizzard favors the horde: gives them downtime to conjure water between matches. Us alliance are granted no such luxury.
---
So even worse was in my WSG recently, mutiple occaisions I had mages refuse to make the group water and we were 10 casters. Do you want to lose the game ebcause us all being OOM is going to lose it for us. Dont trade me your bad water either as that is barely worth it.
---
I /s ask politely and then open trade so it is minimal effort. I literally cannot udnerstand how shitty some people are about it. Im playing a healer for gods sake! Why play mage if you cannot handle a bit of clicking water. I dont mind even trading just 10 or so for the game, split stakcs etc. it helps a lot
---
disclaimer: not sure how the other discords are or whatever but the warlock discord "BiS" stuff is determined by a sim. So i'm sure technically yeah, it is BiS, but if you look at the p1/p2 BiS stuff for example, most of it is a pipe dream for a warlock to get and pretty laughable. So yeah, "technically" BiS but realistically no warlock will see all the items or even a lot of them (rings of SP, mana igniting cord, robes of volatile power...not saying impossible/it doesn't happen but unlikely for a lock to get all those + choker etc etc)
---
also if you take a look at stuff like the top 20 on WCL you'll see none of them have the full or even most of the BiS list. funny enough last time I checked the top 20 warlocks had ROTV and there was only 1 with volatile power (also happened to have cord, go figure)
---
that said, the warlock + im sure all these discords are a great resource that can teach you a lot. i'll end by saying just don't take everything you read in them to be 110% true no matter what and try to add a dose of realism into any opinions you form off the information provided.
---
I play horde on earthsaker :) its alright over there
---
Alliance propaganda is strong with this one.
---
Lol that is awesome. Someone make Mankrik next lmao
---
Well, [Qiraji Execution Bracers](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21602/qiraji-execution-bracers) are also really good.
---
Comapred to the palte bracers from AQ, you lose 8 Str and 2 Agi, but gain 14 Stam and 1% hit. So, those may be of interest to warriors as well.
---
Why skulls though?
---
Unitscan
---
If you're looking for PvE you got a few options, if you're looking for a Horde dominated server go with Mankrik, if you want to play the smaller faction Pagle's your place.
---
I'm a ret paladin and I got the 2nd Onslaught Girdle which dropped for us (on the 3rd rag kill to boot)
---
Dire maul tribute solo is 100g+ per hour if you are good at it

Holy fuck you’re actually a brony Jesus Christ how is that real?
---
Because that's a gross overexaggeration, when in reality you don't need to play anywhere near that much. Hell, even attending one raid night for Onyxia + MC would be 3-4 hours per week
---
Lmao bro the Orcs were bloodthirsty ass holes at first. The only reason they became more civil was because Thrall lead them with a more peaceful message.
---
This is Lore from decades ago
---
How to get it?
---
If you are so geared why dont you farm strat live? Or tank for gold.
---
Boots of the shadow flame are great as well depending on hit set up
---
Nice. Thanks for the insight. Sucks though. I saw Javel’s pvp vid and goddamn it looks like fun. Farming is what I do like 70% of the time I’m on so a hit to farming speed really sucks. The other 20% is raiding and the last 10% is like... jumping around  org bank roof for no reason.
---
Workaholics and Olympus still going at it
---
No, they didn't. ZG just drops nothing interesting.
---
*palpatine voice* DO IT!
---
We could use a different contrast. Imagine this, Satan is real, you are starving to death and wolves have been hunting you for days. You have no idea why the wolves are attacking you but they are and the best guess you can muster is because you are on their territory; you won't last much longer. Satan says he will give you and your family the means to survive and beat back the wolves, he doesn't say what it will cost you but based off of common knowledge you can be reasonably sure it will cost your souls. 
---
Do you sell your souls to the Devil or do you accept that you and your family will die to wolves without even knowing why they are attacking you? This is to say that yes I can blame him for selling his, and his warriors, to enslavement by demons regardless of the circumstances.
---
Regarding your example though, Cenarius ignores Grommash's statement, hardly a plea, that he and his warriors are free *after* they drink from the fountain. Cenarius is no fool, he knows full well they are now demon puppets. He also never vowed to wipe them out, only to 'cleanse them from the forest' which could mean that he wanted them all dead, or it could have meant that he wanted them driven out.
---
"Why is he just wanding for so long with all that mana when all his party is being thrown into the trash!"
---
I swear everybody trying to decry minmaxing always manages to come across as so butthurt about it.
---
I got both WSG and AB exalted before I got rank 13, to put pvp into perspective
---
And yet here we are on a thread started by a mage asking for everyone to just open trade to get water
---
I relentlessly gank pvp flagged horse lowbies in SM because you shouldn't be marked unless you're trying to shit on my fellow alliance lowbies
---
Got shadowfang my first sfk run. 50 or so runs later no assassins blade =(
---
We usually have 3-4. We had a diff raid time today so a few missed. Just happened that they were all locks lol
---
Is that A mount ? How to get it ?
---
Was he using a chromebook or cloud services to stream the game?
---
I know blizz doesn't like cloud services because you dont own the hardware its running on so that makes it less secure. I see 0 issues with remote play i know a few guildies who use it to play some at work and they have never had an issue.
---
Except everyone on PVE servers.
---
Keep in mind it was the Draenei who attracted the Legion to Draenor which eventually led to the Orcs being used as Kil'jaedens tool to kill them, also the Orcish invasion of Azeroth was made possible by the Sargeras possessed Medivh. Really the Orcs were just tools to be used by the Legion for their goals until the Orcs broke free of their control.
---
&gt;This isn't people picking the wrong server, it's people going too far.
---
No. That's something a PvE / Casual player would say. This is them trying to stay competitive in PvP honor system. No other way to reliably farm honor, you have to corpse camp, camp flight points, and gank major cities. This is **exactly** why BGs were released early.
---
&gt;No one could have expected the horde to be able to completely take over like that.
---
You joking?
---
LEFT SIDE
---
EVEN SIDE
---
And then fought the burning legion with a smaller army? They did it because it was the smartest move, for everyone, sure, but also for them.
---
&gt; You also, realistically can't even play your class, because most of your week is spent offline on that character babying your world buffs
---
Dude what? It takes 15-25 minutes to get tribute buffs. Say raid is at 8, you do that at 6:30-7, go to felwood for songflower, and then go to stormwind for Ony buff. Log until head drops and go to raid. Why can't you guys acting so angry about it even make an attempt to tell the truth about it?
---
You have fun spending 20+ hours a day in a game for 7 weeks straight and then probably failing anyway.
---
Unless you're account sharing/win trading I guess.
---
imagine somehow equating the ease of MC and ony to people tryharding
---
no shit this content is easy. it isn't always going to be this easy. and maybe some people like to clear MC and ony in 90 minutes instead of 5 hours split across 2-3 nights. or maybe they don't care about clear time, maybe they just like to be in a "tryhard" guild so they're rewarded for their performance instead of losing a TOEP to some fresh 60 in 40 blues and greens, or losing mageblade to some nerd who doesn't even have half his pre-bis but he saved up 42069 DKP or whatever
---
many reasons to be in a tryhard guild even in the easiest phases of content, sorry whatever one on your server left a sour taste in your mouth
---
I rerolled to Morgraine and it’s been awesome. From what I hear and read, it’s well balanced at 60, and while levelling there are always groups for every 5 man
---
I only kill the people playing super douche race/class combos. Gnomes always KoS, especially mages. NE hunters, we all know you rolled that shit to aimed shot out of your stealth...
---
Well obviously the point is to talk some shit.  Nothing wrong with a bit of shit talking.
---
Don't think so, if you want to be a hybrid, it's one or the other.
---
I'm getting 'Make Azeroth Great Again' vibes from you.
---
You cant do the attunement quest before 55
---
Claw of Chromaggus is better than mageblade.
---
If you mean the mace then mage/lock can't use that.
---
If you mean staff then Claw of Chromaggus + AV Exalted OH is only about the equivalent of 10 SP inferior for a mage, or like 16 SP inferior for warlock (since they scale better with crit) compared to staff, but it depends a lot on gear so mileage may vary.
---
At any rate if people have a problem with paladins getting mageblade they're dum-dums. Not every paladin is gonna get nef's mace because of the low droprate so might as well give them some mageblades... especially since mages and locks can just get Claw of Chromaggus if they lack a good weapon, but I know all too well that people have no precognition and how much of an ego thing mageblade can be for some.
---
It's not Blizzard's fault that we can't have nice things. People chose to overpopulate horde because they were told their PvP racials are better, top PvP players will play Horde etc.
---
Sure Blizzard could have held our hand and forced faction balance but then people would rage that they can't play the race they want.
---
At the end of the day, the horde players who knowingly over populated their faction and then made P2 hell for alliance on most realms made their bed and now it's time to sleep in it.
---
&gt;i'll end by saying just don't take everything you read in them to be 110% true no matter what and try to add a dose of realism into any opinions you form off the information provided.
---
No offense dude but your criticism is pretty unfounded as every discord I'm in offers up plenty of alternatives, none are just saying "this is the best ignore anything else." Hell the warlock one specifically has a massive slideshow with about 25 pages dedicated to every viable piece for slots at 60.
---
&gt;There is a vendor that sells
---
&gt;sells
---
That's why
---
There were no Russian servers in vanilla. They occupied some English speaking servers though
---
So youre a mage.
---
Pros: Great Damage, Great slows / freezes  / CC's, Blink, 1 Panic Button if people are in your face.
---
Cons: If people GET in your face,youll die.
---
Im a Warrior, if I get in your face for more than 2 Swings you are dead.
---
The Solution, dont let me get in your face for more than 2 swings. (refering to your Pros from earlier).
---
Use your Kit and get some stamina!
---
Vanilla raiding is costing you 2-3 nights? Thats on you then chief. No guild should be revisiting mc multiple days out of the week. Even pugs can clear it in about 4-5 hours. An average guild should clear mc/ony within 4 hours, 3 hours if theyre decent.  
---
Also idk why you feel the need to make the distinction of "adult life". Time is time. And if you think yours is more important somehow, then as an adult you should find a better guild that isnt wasting your time. MC is a joke.
---
I saw you !! Small world !
---
WHO DO YA VOODOO, BITCH
---
I was in your situation not long ago and everyone said BRD. I thought it was terrible XP and wanted to quest. Make sure you do Searing Gorge ASAP as you outlevel it at around 55-56. Then you can move on to WPL and some EPL. Do BRD and LBRS when you have quests to do in there as they can net you 1+ level just through the quest XP alone. Then get started in your Ony attunement quest (starts in Kargath at around lvl 55-56 and sends you to LBRS)
---
&gt; and basically every piece of gear retardins go for, warrior go for?
---
Umm, no. A ret has basically 3-5 items, which the warriors. A ret doesn't compete on weapons and a lot of hit gear. 
---
If I go by MC gear, I share 4 items with warriors (ony necklace, flameguard gauntlets, Onslaught Girdle and quick Strike ring).
---
In BWL I share 0-2 pieces with warriors (draconic might and fallen crusader legs, however both have an alternative, which reduces the chances of having to contest warriors here). Stuff like Chromatic Boots or Drakefang Talisman, highly sought after warrior items are completely irrelevant to me.
---
Why didnt the mage blink
---
What's the incoming damage like on this? I'm the typical dw fury/arms spec and wondering how viable this would be for me
---
True but it’s more beneficial to gear your DPS before your healers
---
Of course not. Pouring a skull atop a Christmas tree is completely normal.
---
Death or survival, death or survival... yeah I think most living beings would choose survival.
---
Aww that sucks man :( I put bracers of might for 4g BO also, the guy who bought it ignored me after I asked him for at least 50 more gold coins (They cost 450g on our server)...
---
The problem is that you need to remember exactly where the mailbox is and cant use any landmarks because the city looks the same. Mailboxes for org/tb is infront of the bank. Mailbox for uc is technically infront of the bank but gotta look at the minimap then remember which part of the circle its on, then make sure you dont fall off the bridge.. then if you forgot something from the ah gotta go back down, and climb up 2 levels again for no reason. Org and tb ah is right across the street.
---
The price dropped pretty quickly. When I logged in yesterday morning and realized the event was live, I went and farmed a hundred eggs. Sold them for a total of 106g. Farmed another hundred and sold them for much less, not sure how much exactly.
---
Well Im not the best player around.. I play for fun and I just random got kicked so decide I would ask here if I did something wrong haha.
---
discord.gg/avpremade
---
Generally, I've found the best place to look for a guild is your server's discord.
---

Lel
---
Actually, it was added in patch 2.0 which was released 45 days before tbc launched.  So, technically you could DW in Vanilla for a little while.  😊
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MANPRkcoTqo
---
Makes sense, ill probably end up more ele/enh then
---
Nah, it's wrong for mages as well. BIS for mage is combining pvp shoulders and t1 helm/bracers/gloves.
---
On Wowhead they use 2 tier 1 pieces for no good reason because you don't get the set bonus, only 1 piece of pvp for no good reason again because of the same thing.
---
They also don't even list pvp gloves as an alternative EVEN THOUGH getting pvp gloves + boots is better than anything else until you're rank 10 and can pick up the shoulders (and replace the gloves, going pvp boots+shoulders) because of the set bonus... which goes back to my previous point about Wowhead neglecting set bonuses.
---
12 of us did it for 100 minutes before 1 dropped. Multiple blue BOEs as well, but goddamn we were gettin impatient
---
The spell penetration trinket from WSG isn’t out. The spell penetration ring from AV also isn’t out.

---
To be fair, what exactly was alliance supposed to do with those Orcs? It’s either killing them or having them as prisoners. Just letting them live their lives is not an option. Everyone knew what those orcs did. How could they be trusted not to do it again?
---
They did the only thing they could do because slaughtering defenseless orcs is not right but letting them free after what they’ve done is neither.
---
Nefs found some Orcs making a camp in their sacred forrest.
---
Super nice good guy elves attacked these Orcs instead of trying to communicate.
---
Nelfs got their ass beaten so they send their demigod to kill Orcs.
---
Orcs corrupted themself for defence and killed the demigod.
---
Yes... Orcs are only evil people here.
---
You probably have to kill him 10 times to get his head...
---
Well, BRE for a ret paladin is the 2nd best possible weapon right now (behind sulfuras). BRE for a warrior is what? 5th? 6th best?
---
SM arm/catch is doable with a few Bis items but you will need bandages and last bosses will not be too easy
---
If u go ele for leveling you definitely want to go ele / resto to get the +hit talents and crit
---
Can someone who knows enough about av and math do the math for this please. With some examles with different queuetimes. I hand in some easy percentages. Horde can go for a fast game but then they prob lose 95% of the time. If they defend a little bit after belinda I would guess the game length is around 20 min average since it stalls sometimes. But I would guess winrate is around 50-60% then.
---
Then don‘t get water
---
What class are you?  Salt is recruiting.
---
So? BRE is the 2nd best weapon for a ret. BRE is 3rd best for a 2h warrior and there are several better 1hs available.
---
No class really needs 2h weapons besides ret paladins and enahncement shaman, so why in the world is it surprising, that 2h weapons go to rets first?
---
I use bartender, very easy way to create your action bars and to create your keybinds
---
Nope, the chance is what it is, a chance. Every roll is independent of the previous and has the same 1 in a 100 probability. Which means there's no guarantee the 1% event will ever happen at all until the heat death of the universe, however that is extremely unlikely :)
---
I set that keybinding up when Cataclysm came out and everyone was crowding around the Flight Master to train Azeroth flying.
---
Good times.
---
&gt; Besides do you really think he would have stopped if they had asked, or that he wouldn't have drunk from the fountain to defeat Cenarius even if he knew why they were attacking?
---
I think so, actually, to prove to thrall that he learnt his previous mistake.
---
I still don’t think it is a fair comparison though, while I’m not saying he did what was right, my main point is that he didn’t do it out of evil. He did it out of desperation. If the story goes something like he entered ashenvale, saw a bunch of natives, saw fountain, drank that then slaughtered them all for resources then I’d agree with you.
---
However he never really was on the offensive until he drank that stuff, in which case you kinda gotta shift the evil stick to demons rather than orcs.
---
A similar story from alliance side could be made of the acquisition of frostmourne
---
Mine are the same except I have defensive stance as R, and I just use a separate macro to switch to a board. Because sometimes I want to be in defensive stance for the extra threat gen in dungeons , but want to keep both my swords on for the rage gain.
---
Still, /moo at them when you kill them.
---
Woah imagine that some people actually enjoy getting good parses and doing speed runs in MC, since it's a fucking boring ass raid otherwise
---
Put lobotomizer in the bank and use mirah's song in your off hand.
---
t. bottom dps mage/warlock/rogue/warrior
---
Yeah... when I'm running in and out of the instances over and over and over and I see the same guys still flagged for pvp. Nah.
---
Judt got 2 characters to exalted and that was probably one of the worse grinds ever.
---
lol this really upsets you

Ikr lmao. I'm going for rank 11 (: rank 7 54% ATM. Just gonna stay in bracket 12

Just keep on truckin. You'll get there
---
What’s the name of an addon that gives You dragon „frame”?
---
I play 2h slam spec, using BRE. I don't like dw, but afaik fury prot dw is bis for threat.
---
Any contested zone you come and your 5 minute pvp flag will almost certainly be gone by the time you've walked to SM
---
Plan your BiS drops and make a list from dungeons and mc/onyxia-quests u gotta do, then start your own groups.
---
My trick is offering the tank 5g in LFG, then once the tank arrives they usually say "nah man not needed". This happends 80% of the time so it costs u 1g per tank on avarage.
---
Also no guildies who wanna group/help?
---
Can't play the AH at the same time if i'm in Alterac.
---
Shouldn't have probably done that then huh?
---
Here's a general charge macro to give you an idea how stances and macros (can) work.
---
#showtooltip Charge
---
/cast [stance:2/3] Battle Stance;[stance:1] Charge;
---
Stance 1 = Battle Stance
---
Stance 2 = Defensive Stance
---
Stance 3 = Berserker Stance
---
The macro casts either Battle Stance if not in it and Charge once you're in it (2 button presses maximum)
---
I have it on a action button that doesn't change on stance to have it always accessible.
---
I got my stances on Y,X,C (QWERTZ layout) and dance manually for most things.
---
I like BindPad as a warrior as it allows you to bind actions/macros directly without cluttering up your screen/actionbars.
---
It's really not
---
Don’t be [so sure](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zjqOHkAftmc/hqdefault.jpg)
---
The goblin merchant looking away from this sinful scene.
---
Ye could also just drop the stance skill from yer spellbook into actionbar and keybind that actionbar
---
\^ this.
---
Blame the mentality of "I only roll on bis, anything else is inferior!", not the bis lists.
---
It's honestly hilarious how so many people think they can get rank 14.
---
You’re def good ppl are afk farming, fishing, doing quests etc. sounds like you the ppl u were playing w were dicks which happens.

---
Dont listen to him. He's completly wrong. 
---
Continue to defend!
---
Look at these guys thinking a warrior would using anything but damage skills
---
Lol i saw what was happening god damn
---
3 weeks ago, I was bored waiting for a mate to go in scholo and decided to go kill some mob who drop crusader enchant recipe (the mage in the tower). I was alone, there was 6 mage. Killed them all, got 2 enchant recipes. Never ever saw it again. And still no other interesting loot in dungeon :(. Used all my luck for the rest of the year
---
I gotta see if there's a character on the Taiwan servers named 有人
---
Yeah, I'm only lvl 51 atm, but I love DW with swords. Fury is so fun. The more damage and crits you take, and the more damage and crits you deal, you meaner and more rage filled, (literally and figuratively) you become. Your just slinging blades and dropping dudes left and right.
---
&gt;why do you get to determine that?
---
Because you're responding to a post about discords, saying be careful about what they list, when literally every class discord says plain as day not to just blindly follow lists and list viable alternatives.
---
&gt;it is easy for a lock that isn't advised otherwise to see the BiS list and think "huh, I have ROWN, but I see volatile power is BiS, I guess I should skip making my ROTV and drop tailoring now"
---
You're talking about being realistic, but realistically nobody who is making an attempt to be informed by looking up BiS lists is having that opinion. The number of people I've interacted with who blindly follow the BiS lists without a second thought have been too dumb to make the best of their gear anyway.

I wonder if I could go solo deadmines and see if the final boss drops it lol

We aren’t turtling by choice, we are by necessity.

Alliance have tried to (and succeeded) wipes us at Bal at the last 5 times we’ve ran it, which means we get both shit rep and shit honor. So we defend, get tonnes of rep, tonnes of honor, and for 4 out of the 5, win. So you can blame us for defending, or you can stop wiping us on Bal.
---
That said, I would prefer you keep wiping us there, as the long game is way more fun! I got 50 killing blows, top by almost 20, in an 82 minute slog on Saturday. It’s was the most fun I’d had!
---
And we're also entitled give nothing to people that treat us like mere vending machines.

So much this

Eu or na

When I ask for water, I try to formulate for the mage to be able to answer : “yes or sure”. I think the effort is reasonable. I just wait for the answer to pop before trading as I already had some people refusing a trade invitr
---
Razorfen pve is 50/50 many good pve guilds but also some wpvp
---
No it's not. AQ gear is better.
---
And being a new player who doesn't even raid he probably won't even dream of becoming R7+
---
Thanks, I'll test these out.
---
First of all, imagine writing this much over a thread that's clearly being facetious lmfao
---
Second, 
---
&gt;drunk driver who just killed some kid saying they aren't responsible cause they were drunk. 
---
this is completely false, unless there was legislature passed forcing people to drink before they drive? Or maybe others enforce it? 
---
Afaik, people CHOOSE to drink then CHOOSE to drive themselves then CHOOSE to flip the ignition, put their car in gear, and drive. Many many many layers of conscious choice as a free-willed human. 
---
However, that entire hypothetical changes when you're talking about being drugged or forced to be inebriated 
---
None of this is to mention the fact that orcs only came to azeroth to escape their own demise, along with their homeworld's.
---
Tbh I'm not even on the hordes side but the notion that they are *more* evil than night elves or humans or dwarves? Laughable, especially because thrall is by far the most honorable and respectable leader in all of azeroth, including Varian.
---
Thanks man, I used openshot, its a free software.
---
I just bound the tree stances to shift 1-3, no need to be fancy.
---
The least popular class is Druid. But with the exception of tanking in 5-mans, they're not super sought after in groups.
---
Tanks are by far the most desired role in 5-mans. You'll have no problem getting any 5-man you want pretty much any time of the day if you're a tank. The problem comes with raiding. Feral druids are not highly sought after in raids. For main tanks, Ferals *can* work fine in this level of content with enough consumables, but in the content that's going to be released in the future, Ferals just don't work well as the main tank, people prefer warriors as tanks. They do just fine as offtanks, *but* with warriors as the most popular class in the game, most guilds just have a couple dps warriors slap on their tanking set for encounters where they need more than one tank. They work totally fine, and when they're not tanking, they do better damage than a feral.
---
As for Druids' other options, they're the least desirable healer in 5-mans, but they're about equal with every other healer in raids.
---
For DPS, neither feral nor balance is especially desirable in 5-mans, but they're not especially undesirable either. In raids, feral  sole DPS is not really a thing, you'd probably be expected to offtank as well as dps, but you bring a desirable buff to the melee dps. Similarly, Moonkins might be kind of a joke spec, but the buff you give to casters is enough that most guilds are fine taking one moonkin per raid.
---
Now, everything I've said about raids has a hitch. For the vast majority of guilds out there, the most important thing is *attendance and not being a jerk*. If a guild isn't rushing for speedrun records, then ultimately, warm bodies are more important than the optimal class composition. If you can show up consistently, refrain from being an asshole, and demonstrate at least a little effort, most guilds will be happy to have you along even if you're a "sub-optimal" spec. The one exception is for the main tank, guilds do have to be pretty picky about their main tank so unless you want to start your own or you have a friend who raid leads and is willing to give you a chance, it's pretty unlikely you'll get a main tanking spot as anything other than a warrior.
---
If you're not planning on raiding, then a feral druid tank hits the "desirable but not popular" role you're looking for. If you are planning on raiding, and you really want to be the character the most guilds are looking for, then I think probably, alliance-side, your best option is a Dwarf holy priest, and Horde-side, your best option is a resto shaman. Though note that healers are generally the hardest to find 5-man groups as.
---
Just don't defend, it causes turtles and reduces honor/hour. Simple
---
It's better to get all liutenants and some towers and lose quick than sit in stalemate av for 40 mins for 3k honor.
---
Last time i checked wowhead it said the forst thing you mentioned
---
3 options:
---
Cold blood prep - High burst low utility - Good for beginners and lower geared players to just burst some guy down
---
Imp sprint prep: Medium burst medium utility - The bread and butter spec. Does decent damage and allows you to sprint out of novas and slows to fuck mages in particular
---
Imp kick prep: Lower burst/damage but high utility - A bit of an advanced spec for BG's. Imp kick gives a silence which can be deadly when used by a very skillful player and preferably with good gear since the damage is on the lower side with this spec.
---
The exact pick of the build varies from preference, but here's how I'd build them
---
CB prep:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheoRxzZGMZVMjcc0R](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheoRxzZGMZVMjcc0R) 
---
Imp sprint:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fbe0oxZGcM0bZVMjcc0R](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fbe0oxZGcM0bZVMjcc0R) 
---
Imp kick:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fbe0oZGccbrZVMjcc0R](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fbe0oZGccbrZVMjcc0R)
---
I second this as well.  Real discussion happened in this thread and if someone had a new-player question, I felt people could ask it in that thread without judgment.
---
As many have already stated, I checked this thread almost daily.  It was a great place to get your WoW fix during the workday and probably learn something new in the process.
---
Tanks are most needed. Followed by healers.
---
In that sense, play Paladin or Druid, as they can be both, Druid in particular is the best tank for dungeons.
---
It's mainly due to the # of trinkets &amp; items a eng/rogue has to use. I never had this problem in retail.
---
Im still baffled that more people didn't take few hours out of their time to reserve as many "good" names as possible. These are mine and in fact that is Razorgore server conversation from few weeks ago.

Also. Here’s a tip. When wrath of ragnaros hits, it will only knock back 3 people. So, first wrath of rag, gave everyone stay in and have healers be ready to heal those knocked back. Those people knocked back will ALWAYS be the ones knocked back for every run, forever if you bring the same 40 every week. So for my guild unfortunately I am one of the ones getting knocked back, while all the other melee stay in the wrath of ragnaros and DPS him down. 
---
We figured this out after being stuck on him for 4 weeks. This week we one phased rag using this strat. Hope it works for you aswell!
---
Yeah, so? What do you want to happen?
---
Report him and if he stays out of pvp he gets 0 honor.
---
There are separate addons that do just this
---
be the change you want to see in the world
---
I just did it on my 35 hunter.
---
It’s for pvp not pve headass
---
This reminds me of the meme where two spidermans are pointing at each other because I reckon you're both cancer.
---
Ah yes the complexity of raiding in vanilla WoW as a Rogue: learning how to to count and installing a swing timer add-on. This one simple trick gets you above 85% on all parses! 
---
Like half your fucking damage comes from passive auto-attacks. C'mon buddy. 
---
Honestly, as much as people knock on retail, raiding is much more engaging if that's your thing. Speed matters, and boss mechanics actually make fights challenging. Classes have a more involved damage rotation. 
---
For the vast, vast majority of players in vanilla, you essentially sit stationary spamming one button. Raid composition and a bit of rng determine how big your dick is that night. Your only influencing factor (outside of being able to count) is how many passive buffs you can stack and that's the consequence of how much time you're willing to spend out in the world (or let's be honest, buy gold from Chinese farmers, otherwise they wouldn't be spamming) to stack these passives. The enchants you get from for your gear are marginal upgrades that are a disproportionate gold sink (because +4 to chest is clearly superior to +3, so it must cost thrice as much obviously! ), and all this amounts for you is to eke out that last 5% that puts you above the rest.
---
But even within this great echelon of autism, all the 'big brain' players do is follow guides and spreadsheets crafted by a small handful of intelligent and bored people. Those folks are probably the closest thing to "real" speedrunning that happens in WoW. And they're not even playing the game at that point.
---
Did you just sit just before felhunter hit you to get enraged? good good
---
But the only reason it's war ravaged is because of the horde!
---
How obtuse.  Obviously the person you're replying to isn't talking about contributing to group success.  Almost every mage in a group or raid is expected to provide water and food and they do so because they know it'll make things easier for them as well.  
---
However, how often do you get people asking you for buffs in capital cities?  After all, it's just a click of a button!  Ever had someone trade you in town for a healthstone or soulstone?  Probably not, but maybe they should!  After all, you just click a button and should get over it!  
---
My first 60 was a mage and I swiftly made my shaman my main instead because of how annoying and offended people get.  Imagine trying to walk between the auctioneers and the mailbox and getting bombarded by requests for water, food, and portals by people who will tell you that you're a fucking mage and therefore should give them service when they want it.  
---
Since you're talking about buffing the group and using mana pots, I'll assume that your flair is inaccurate and you're actually maining a healer.  Get over yourself.  If you're in a good guild, you aren't really ever expected to flask, so sure you're spending 3g on a potion, but everyone else ends up paying 100g+ weekly while you don't.
---
But they account for a significant number of games because of how many they play.
---
Do it
---
Yeah i ment Vandar ofc.
---
It's not that bad but you should calculate with 20+ shards for a raid night. SS, HS, summons and pets eat them quite quickly.
---
Yeah, a lot of people have recommended me the weak auras mod. I did try it out in the past but I couldn't really figure it out. The wago website has a lot of information I really should go over. Currently, I'm at 9% as a combat/assassination rogue with the 305 wpn skill. Unfortunately, I don't have that much time to play the game, so I can't really farm gear or anything and a lot of my gear adds +1% chance to hit. Ideally, if the minimum is 6% with 305 wpn skill is there a max %? Also, since I dislike large mouses I probably won't get an MMO mouse but that tip with the thumb for using the alt key might come in handy and create a lot more keybindings for me, thanks.
---
Get first aid, a ranged weapon, look for green gear with spirit on it early on. After lvl 25ish start stacking str, agil and Stam.
---
Don't fight mobs higher level that you, and same goes for quests.  Once u start running early dungeons keep a sword and shield with ya for tanking. I suggest leveling as arms. 
---
Just watch some YouTube guides on warrior leveling and what not. It's a challenge, but it's super fun. You'll probably hit a wall around lvl 30ish, but just group up or run dungeons alot. Once u hit 40-45 you'll get a pretty fat powerspike and it only goes up from there.
---
Just keep in mind that tanks are hard to come by later on and everyone always needs you. So just stick it out and it will pay off
---
The one problem is sometimes it feels like half the team is doinking around back at base or in the mines or farting around on quests. It gets to theres so many people back at start that the team thata actually trying to win the BG dont gave enough to push through and finish it. Like previous poster said - it either causes a turtle which wastes time, or a stalemate which wastes time, or the opponents are 40 men deep pushing to finish it and we lose. None of those outcomes are preferred
---
&gt; Also idk why you feel the need to make the distinction of "adult life". Time is time. And if you think yours is more important somehow, then as an adult you should find a better guild that isnt wasting your time.
---
My guess would be he/she was implying that adults generally have less free time to themselves compared to when they where teenagers and/or students.
---
Cries in PvP no swappable offhand
---
Okay thanks for the info! yeaaa seeen some games get over really fast.. Just had one that has 1h+ :P
---
Thanks for the nice comment!   
---
I will keep doing my best :)
---
Wow, sad state of affairs. Sorry OP, apparently this subreddit is in favour of botting. I can’t believe the morons in this place. “Botting doesn’t affect you” - of-fucking-COURSE it does you idiots.
---
Botting is shit and anyone who does it can get a lifetime ban from all Blizzard games, the fuck
---
Well we only have (had) 3 dps warriors, but yea it dropped a lot.
---
Oof, Smolderweb alliance numbers just keep dropping lately
---
Resto shaman, if our raids are anythto judge by
---
If you're in the type of guild that is going to be running every raid, you're probably also the type of person who doesn't have much better to do than do all that stuff.
---
Eu or nah*
---
We moved from Firemaw and it was absolutely the right choice, Bloodfang might not be the size of the mega servers but it is by no means quiet
---
Man, a lot of people are recommending me the MMO mouse, I am going to try out the alt key again before using the MMO mouse. But if the alt key doesn't work I'll probably have to get an MMO mouse. Thanks, I'll check out the macros and good to know about the % chance to hit.
---
Yes.
---
Yeah.. I saw that just in my game.. some people quit the push so we wiped and now its a turtle game \^\^.
---
Seriously, been dueling a friend of mine who has TUF. He only needs to get in melee range and I'm dead. Ridiculous.
---
If the XP is bad, you're probably going too slowly.
---
having flame + cloud or even devilsaur or flame + BDS 3 pc should outpace the fact that all you get from cloud is weapon skill and not even benefiting your OH.
---
I think for humans there is no reason to go DB unless its the only thing that drops.
---
I am going to try out the alt key again but if I dislike it I guess my only hope is the MMO mice, thanks.
---
What bop blue drops in MC?
---
That's WSG.
---
It is 15 min in this version of classic :p
---
&gt;  when literally every class discord says plain as day not to just blindly follow lists and list viable alternatives. 
---
you're sure of this? every discord, plain as day? huh, funny...
---
regardless, i'm saying how easy it is for a new or uninformed player to see a "BiS list" and not realize that getting most/all that gear isn't a realistic thing for 99% of their class, at least in the case of warlocks for example
---
Yea it sucks when shamans take your spinal reaper, but why aren't you getting windfury?
---
So true.
---
Imagine you are clearing mc and ony for 3hours.
---
what is this post even
---
lololol. so wrath of rag knocks back 3 people each time? the 3 highest threat?
---
First of all, you wrote just as much as he did over a thread that's "facetious in nature"
---
its not hk, its just honor
---
you've yet to answer why it's actually unrealistic. It's as realistic as any other class getting loot.
---
Just adding in here that while tanks are the most sought-after as far as roles go in dungeons, getting a tank spot in a raiding guild is tough unless it's a new or currently forming guild - or a guild that's setting together another raid group.
---
In dungeons you need 1 tank, 1 healer and 3 DPS, whereas in a raid there's usually 1-2 tank spots out of 40 and 8 or so healer spots. The good news is that as a warrior you can do very competitive DPS, but the bad news is that warrior (and mage) is the most played class on many realms. 
---
In the example of a paladin or druid, both will most likely be relegated to healing if you plan on raiding.
---
Oh yes tell me about how one Old lodaeron Commander that was murdered by Sylvanas after helping her retake undercity was mean to a bunch of elves, that same group of elves that followed Prince Kael Thas to outland and became servants to the Burning Legion, the same Blood Elves we kill in TBC? Because the rest were jsut chilling in Quel Thalas and decided for no reason to join their historically hated enemies
---
nope, they were a 20 man premade who wanted to do whatever they wanted to do (rush galv, I think), and I, as I always do, said 'Mages! I need 2 or 3 of you with me to slow them at balinda'. They said 'we don't need any of your monkey tactics'. I said 'slow at balinda makes it more likely that we get galv' and they mass reported me for abusive language. Don't assume that people are lying . . .
---
Oh shit, I'm an idiot. Yes, that neck is pretty good.
---
There is one, or at least was, not sure why mmo-champ post got deleted.
---
I enjoy having F1 F2 F3 as your hotkeys for stances. Them being above your normal hotkeys also makes sense visually.
---
Then i put same function or overlapping abilities on same key bind. Example; I have charge and intercept on 1, pummel and shieldbash on E (macro), whirlwind, overpower and revenge on 3.
---
Then I make sure that the same abilities are always the same keybind in stancebar, eg. heroic strike is 5 in all my stances and bloodthirst on 2
---
Cant Find the gentleman in this toilet language.
---
Already? That’s some serious dedication dude!
---
Which add on shows you the auction price?
---
Hey now, don't pretend like you couldn't play your character since you had to schedule your game time around ony buff. C'mon. People in my guild either remoted in during midday or raidlogged a few days in advance essentially when they got a chance at head, because they couldn't afford to spend the excess hours waiting for another head to drop. And we're like, hardcore casual raiders. In an ideal world, and a pve server, yeah, you can get everything done in an hour. But that's definitely not the case for the vast majority of players, especially with ony head. 
---
Lets not pretend that Onyxia head doesn't have a 6 hour cooldown and you're at the mercy of whoever the fuck feels like dropping it whenever the fuck they want. It'll only get worse with ZG buff.
---
I picked horde because I thought allies in the lore were a bunch of raging homosexuals and the horde were about honor
---
I think it's common to bind side buttons on MMO mouses to numpad.
---
So explain why we don't cap it?
---
The real question I have is: is capping updated and working? Or are you using a different addon for bg timers?
---
My priest from back then needed 25 days. I was very happy back then.
---
Also I had 0 point of reference.
---
Good video, btw you have a pretty good youtuber voice (easy to listen and speak clearly) i would consider doing more videos ;)
---
I get the feeling that every mage must be spammed by people for water and portals all the time, cause basically 4 out of 5 times if I ask someone politely to buy water off them, they either tell me to fuck off, or want me to pay an outrageous price (5g+ for a portal or 1-2g per stack of water).
---
I've relented to only pestering my IRL mages with water and portals.
---
With my current gear i am able to do even higher frostbolt crits, if you are decked out and have ToEP this isnt to hard, also talents provide a 100% crit multiplier.
---
You must be really lonesome
---
Back in 2006 there was a horde player with that name. Bought quite a few items early on made by Me!
---
"Because" really reminds me of that Who's the tank video on YouTube 😂
---
because Russians want to play game too? and its not our fault that blizz decided to make nicknames for russian server Cyryllyc only. Most of the games in Russia allow using English nicknames. Barely anyone uses Cyrillic... but Blizz thought for RP (which we never had any server for) or any other reasoning English words are banned during character selection.
---
To hijack someone else's comment since you didn't read a 20 post thread.
---
Its because taking Stonehearth graveyard forces allies to respawn at the gy near their base up north, Stormpike. This means your attack team heading up to do Vann are going to be clashing with the respawning ally players and be heavily slowed down from taking Stormpike GY. The more ally that die down south, the more the allies turtle up near Stormpike meaning a very long 30+ min stalemate. 
---
By letting them take SH gy, they respawn at the middle point, which means traveling to attack and defend is much further away. A common strat is if you can hold all the lower graveyards while your attack team gains Stormpike or Aid Station, you can send most of your team up north to finish because the ally are in a poor position to reinforce their team to kill Drek.
---
That's some serious dedication for a practical joke.
---
I was expecting to spend about 200 hours for it but this seems pretty solid tbh. Would be nice to have WSG at exalted before AB comes out. Getting sweet enhancement gear in PvE is pretty difficult unless you're part of the officer core of a raid team or very lucky with pugs so PvP is pretty much the only good option for if not bis then atleast a competative gear setup. I'll be content with the WSG/AB epics, my Unstoppable Force and Don ring and then rank gear for as high as I can. Honestly the only thing I cant really get from PvP is a competent 2nd ring since the caster one from AV is locked to cloth classes for some reason, a decent trinket but I think HoJ is pretty much enhance bis during all classic anyway, and a neck.
---
Somebody would probably have to harvest it, so that you get something in the log like "playerx harvests black lotus"
---
Damn son, get some sleep xD
---
nice dedication, are the rewards already for sale ?
---
It isn't
---
This is classic you can afk play many classes
---
All I wanna know is how the fuck you got into a bg without all your addons freaking out and forcing being disabled.
---
There’s one in AV as well
---
People who run ret in their raids and let members use DKP to buy whatever they want aren't going to be clearing AQ40+ so it literally doesn't matter where the gear goes. They're casual and their playstyle reflects that. Those that do prioritize gear and are optimizing for AQ/Naxx have playstyles that reflect that as well.
---
Guilds who run shit like ret and don't prioritize and gear and think they'll be clearing AQ40 and Naxx, well, sucks to be them!
---
1)Be a Warlock
---
2)Have gear...ANY gear will do.
---
3)Cast Shadowbolt
---
4)Crit for 3k
---
Good thing gurubashi is close
---
&gt; For a majority the items aren’t unobtainable. 
---
Long term, in a DKP guild, possibly.
---
if your guild is rolling the chances of you getting all of the items is incredibly small
---
if your guild is LC and has any idea what they are doing with loot the chance of 1 warlock getting most let alone all the current BiS stuff relatively soon is pretty laughable
---
We’re gonna need a bigger knife
---
Not true, I've been in mc raids with crit capped tanks.
---
Healers got aggro all the time, but at least the tank was the last person standing, right? Hitcap is for noobz
---
Honestly i would like the option for  way longer matches, like the option to choose between old av and this one. Its fun, but could be way more fun for the people that actually enjoy av and arent there just for the honor grind.
---
Me neither :-)
---
Thanks, and grats on the achivement ☺️👍
---
Having multiple raids open across different tiers was one of the absolutely best things WoW ever did. Imagine complaining about it
---
If you're bored doesn't mean that everyone is bored aswell.
---
tyvm =)
---
Or you know, you can just kill it normally, it really isnt that hard, and if you struggle with it and has to cheese it, you imho dont deserve the weapon
---
Rank 14 is the highest PVP rank obtainable in Vanilla/Classic. The PVP system was different back in Vanilla, your rank is based on how much honour you earn comparatively to the rest of your faction. This means that in order to achieve rank 14 (the highest rank) you have to earn more honour than everyone else which typically involves playing ~20 hours per day for several weeks. The gear that you get as a reward is incredible, but absolutely not worth it in my opinion.
---
Duel him and see if it give credit when defeating him! 😂
---
Those "pugs" were actually veterans of the game, MC is by far the easiest raid in classic, and we're playing the 1.12 patch with increased debuff slots, better items and talents. With this information in mind it's no surprise. Naxx however was hard even with the best gear at the time and the 1.12 itemization. That being said, ofc some guilds will get naxx done in the 1st day, but that is, again, because they've been practicing this raid for years on private servers. You and your dumb guild definitely won't be doing that, or finishing naxx for that matter, unless you're those people I mentioned.
---
Nice. However your addon for combat damage triggers me. Original combat damage looks much better and is actually something Blizzard have done right.... Except when fighting massive bosses, then it makes sense to enable.
---
Why not?
---
Haha dummy, just /afk and take your deserter buff. 
---
Horde is always going to win. Its the name of the game.
---
A raid will take any number of Paladins for blessings and good steady healing. Druids on the other hand can't stack HoTs so a sensible raid will only take a couple or they start waste each others mana.
---
that is painful to watch....
---
Grandpa winterveil is in IF so....
---
The worst part is that the fall isn't far enough away to kill :\[
---
Why is it so valuable? Isn't arcane elixir more spell power
---
Daelin believed that, given that historically orcs had a history of murderous atrocity filled wars of unprovoked aggression, if left to their own devices it was only a (short) matter of time before they did so again.
---
Events subsequent to his death proved the admiral entirely correct.  It is indisputable that many, many innocent alliance lives would have been saved had he succeeded.  He pursued an enemy army to try and destroy it before it could regroup and resume its attacks.  It is absolutely tragic that in the end he was betrayed by his own blood, which he fought his entire life to protect.
---
You can tag along with a hunter doing trib runs and open the door for him. Then stay in stealth the entire fight. And not get any loot.
---
Equal skill and gear. Little to no chance.
---
Grats in the rep but showing you have a gear score addon is a bummer
---
AKA Phase 2 and the *cooler* Phase 2
---
Ok let me break it down for you then. Are you like familiar at all what so ever with what we're even talking about? it really doesn't seem like it
---
phase 2.5 bis, not listing all (IE: HWL gear)  
---
r10 head (with set bonus from r10 shoulders), not terribly hard to get but also not easy
---
Choker...again not terribly hard to get but a good LC guild will prob prio this to a spriest if y'all have one, then either top lock or mage
---
shadow dam cape, not hard to find a 21 on AH if you look frequently
---
robes of volatile power, not the rarest drop but sure ain't common, good LC guild will only give this to a lock if they have ROWN/don't plan on getting ROTV, otherwise mage prio for later phase when they drop their tailor robe
---
bracers are shadow dam green, ah again
---
felcloth gloves, cheap enough crafted
---
mana igniting cord, good luck getting this over any mage if you are in any decent guild lul
---
2x ring of SP, hell lets just say getting 1 ring of SP, if your guilds LC has any kind of game knowledge at all they would know that in BWL warlocks get prio on the hit/sp ring and equal(maybe slightly less to a good spriest) prio on the shadow damage ring from BWL trash, literally no reason to give a ring of SP to a lock over a mage
---
fel infused leggings from kazzak, again Spriest prio, BiS forever for a spriest, of course great for a warlock but when p4 comes around and we want full bloodvine set for the hit, what are you gonna do, put these legs in the bank? LOL
---
trinket 1 reed nbd
---
trinket 2 toep nbd, guilds do it different but mage=warlock on this usually
---
MH mageblade or fang of the mystics, i know not all guilds do it like mine so i guess mage=warlock prio on that but also a fairly rare drop, and good luck getting fang of the mystics over a shammy, or if you are alliance i suppose you have a better chance but not exactly warlock prio
---
so getting some pieces (the ones from MC) sure no problem. all of them? even just 1 ring of SP instead of both? good luck lmao. not saying its 100% impossible, just unrealistic for the time being, and by the time BWL comes most of this stuff isn't BiS or close anyway.   
---
do me a favor. take a look at say, the top 5, 10, 15, 20, whatever of these warlocks. the top warlocks on WCL  
---
 [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#metric=dps&amp;class=Warlock&amp;spec=Destruction](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/zone/rankings/1000#metric=dps&amp;class=Warlock&amp;spec=Destruction)   
---
how many of them have full BiS for this phase? half? most, even? I can tell you out of the top 10:  
---
2 have volatile power, 1 has volatile + cord, 1 has a single ring of SP, some don't even have a TOEP and one is even using t1 chest(widely regarded as garbage by the warlock discord lmao)
---
so please, tell me
---
&gt; you've yet to answer why it's actually unrealistic. It's as realistic as any other class getting loot. 
---
I never said "it is unrealistic for a warlock to get BiS but a druid/shaman/mage/any class it isn't"
---
&gt;I really hope they release BWL in early january. I don't see any reason why they should hold it off.
---
Because early January is way too fucking soon? Not everyone can afford playing 12 hrs a day. There's still a ton of things to do (dungeons, BGs, professions, gold farming, alts, etc.) for most players.
---
Instead, they get to earn back enough money to activate another 2-3 accounts to bot with!
---
Such a braindead strategy.
---
&gt; MC is by far the easiest raid in classic, and we're playing the 1.12  patch with increased debuff slots, better items and talents. With this  information in mind it's no surprise 
---
Didn't stopped everyone to wank MC and onyxia to no end before people stomp those raids in the ground.
---
https://i.imgur.com/lRL8out.gif
---
And those things will still be there when BWL comes out. I don't get your point.
---
We're playing checkers and they're playing 4d chess
---
BGs are alright i guess, but most people in my guild aren't super interested in them including myself. MC + Onyxia is 2-2.5 hours a week for my guild and World bosses aren't really an option since we are competing with over 150+ other guilds for them. Sure there are plenty of things to do, like BG's level an alt etc. But i'm only really interested in raiding and that is something i can only really do 2-3 hours a week.
---
Wish the Echo Isles were as dense in forestation as this painting
---
But you're wrong, people have this impression that BGs survived due to crossrealm, it didnt, this never happened in Vanilla, it's literally the other way around. BGs was healthy and thriving, full on activity until the very last day of solo faction BGs, week after week you saw people stacked outside the BG masters, until crossrealm hit and literally weeks after all that activity died out, then BGs became something niche you maby did a couple of hours in a week, I remember this like yesterday, people literally started to focus only PVE when crossrealm hit.
---
There's plenty of other solutions that can be implemented to battle queue times and it is not that hard honestly. But that is to late now.
---
Never lul, stop being a mad boi .. btw pve servers exists and world ganking is not close to being the same after BG release
---
#Onechange
---
Going to just leave us hanging without providing your source?
---
Interesting read. Thank you! Good to hear you got it turned around
---
This hurts because i'm sitting at work and it's 3:00 a.m. but my real shift doesn't start until 7:00 a.m.
---
It does that when a character named something is online on your server.
---
&gt;Not everyone can afford playing 12 hrs a day. There's still a ton of things to do (dungeons, BGs, professions, gold farming, alts, etc.) for most players.
---
I think a lot of people doing that stuff would rather do BWL, so why not let them? Its been almost 4 months, i think most people have a level 60 by now, if they have been playing since release and are still playing, don't you think?
---
Whats is exactly your problem if i may ask ?
---
Sorry should have specified I'm on US. Started on Blameux at launch.
---
That has been a feature in Isboxer for a decade.
---
Never tried RP before. Is it chill? I'm not sure I have the stones to build a whole backstory around my WoW character.
---
looks like Adebisi from Oz
---
If you spend all day farming them, you can get quite a lot of them.  Guildy of mine got eight in a single day.
---
Yeah compared to the PVP server I left, the people on my RP server are way nicer, more helpful and alot more fun. 
---
I definitely reccomend it.
---
Why are those things a reason to hold it off, i don't understand? So what if we have Naxx in a year? What is the problem with that? I just want to have fun and play the game. I'd rather have opportunities and decide if i want to do that or not, than to not have that opportunity.
---
really? well shit haha
---
who cares if u dont see the \*skill\* in this video haha
---
Interesting I'll have a look. The idea of an RP server always seemed a bit intense to me, but if it's chill I'll definitely look into it
---
TBF nobody cares about your KoS list lol. When I see alliance, I kill them. I expect them to try and kill me. So who cares if I am on your list?
---
Vendinglivesmatter
---
The server I'm on isn't like hardcore roleplaying, you just play normally and roleplay when you want. There are a couple hardcore doing guilds, but I'm not about that life.
---
Try lowering your polling rate on either the software or your mouse.
---
Wow classic does not handle high polling rates well.
---
And I'm here rolling a 100 on the first mageblade that dropped, so I've had that for like 5 weeks now and I have yet to see a single Nemesis piece drop :/
---
&gt;  I haven't done mine in like 10 years
---
It's incredible that the Battle.net authenticator was doing MFA before my bank actually did.
---
There is literally no skill involved in life, it is just doing the right things.
---
 But why?  Holy is more useful and you could gear another warrior instead for later content...
---
IF is the de facto capital, not just because it has the most convenient layout out of Alliance cities, but because most players spend time there.
---
Why should he change his ui? 
---
With some small addons the Standard ui is fine. 
---
Like shadow unit frames, plater, weakaura and Quartz
---
Can I just say, as a level 51in av I love joining the gang bang on guys with that weapon. Feels great to see them targeting me as they die
---
That's DejaClassicStats, it has bunch of features. He just hasn't disabled show item level.
---
They stack.
---
Because, you know, some people like enjoying the game, fishing, dungeons, rping... you know, having fun

Did you even read the context of the thread? A guild who doesn't allow at least 1 ret pally in MC/Ony is imo a tryhard guild. It's not BWL or AQ. You went off on some other shit.
---
Robe of Power; 14 Spell Dmg is a lot on Your lvls :)
---
Doing bad stuff cos somebody else does, makes u just as bad. Excuses do not make anything look better
---
Undead rouges literally fuck everyone stranger they meet
---
Cool. Thanks pal!
---
Nope. Early January is too soon. And what you "think" isn't always how things actually are. Someone who hasn't finished grinding dungeons for gear or is still struggling with gold would definitely rather *not* do BWL. It's a massive ramp up in commitments that a lot of players aren't yet ready for. "Almost 4 months" is nothing for a game with a planned content cycle of roughly 18-24 months.

Felhunter can devour Polymorph. kek
---
You can forget about killing the pet at all, resistances way too high, without -resist (penetration) gear in later phases, the pet takes little dmg.
---
np
---
Pray he disconnects
---
Funny enough I already have the hypnotic blade and ravager
---
I was considering going ele/enh if I could make it work (pvp) - in my head that would be my prefered playstyle
---
Gratz on the turtle
---
I was about to say that. We have a bear and a boomkin in our core, been working well so far.
---
Yes, because they assume no waste. Most fights aren't like that.
---
I mean it says hunter right there on the binding
---
We need to do ubrs too... but only at the end. And honestly the escort quest is a pain in the ass...
---
Having done both multiple time, I prefer the alliance one for the lore, but the horde one for the simplicity!
---
You aren't required to roleplay, ever, to play on an rp server.
---
So when there is someone yelling on IF bridge that they want to inspect that you’ve got pre-BiS gear in order to be accepted to their MC pug where everything is reserved, what BiS list am I supposed to use to not make a fool of myself?
---
They already removed the possibility of having Russian players in your team. What else do you want?
---
Firemaw
---
Earthfury is good as a horde server eh? I been thinking  of playing an orc shaman so that might work as well.
---
Do you have to find rexxar or rather the equivalent?
---
Depends what do you want to do or focus most in the game:
---
\- Raiding: healer (holy pala/dwarf holy priest) or dps (probably warlock is the most needed)
---
\- Dungeons: Tank (warrior)
---
\- If you want to PvP, probably healers are most needed and should chose race for pvp.
---
Druids and rogues have always been the BIS duo.
---
&gt; Is this action going to actively cause another player to die or otherwise quit the game?
---
Maybe not quit the game but definitely quit the guild.
---
Not true, and even if it was, a necessary evil is still evil.  
---
The Horde are evil.  They are a protofascistic military cult of personality under Thrall, and become full fascists under Garrosh and Sylvanas.
---
You mean "Sergeant Major ?????????"
---
thanks guys, I'm horde, and its not easy, we have tonnes of running about to do, and drakes to kill. its a long ass quest, but loads of XP I guess, will look to pick them up soon (as soon as I am done with AV rep on my resto shammy) :D
---
Yeah you could have mixed teams for one day until they "fixed" it.
---
Eeeeh. I forgot about this part. Well finding Windsor in brd jail, that needs to get back getting his stuff, his friends... a quest you can fail! And in that case you need to reset the instance... :(
---
This screenshot is painful. Learn to crop my dude.
---
I farmed for 10 hours, killed over 150 demons easily, no drop. Fuck this post
---
Those are 100% feral tank prio.  I can see so much drama surrounding those boots.
---
the moment you clicked your wotf i knew you are shit tier player. not even insignia on keybind, so sad.
---
Damn my guild is on a 8 mageblade drop straight up... But isnt there better for a paly?
---
Why not buy the legs while you were there? Fake?
---
Sounds like you picked a PvP server when you should've picked a PvE servers.
---
Maybe dual boxing?
---
Yeah that definitely is annoying but finding rexxar FINDING REXXAR BRINGS PTSD
---
Technically every eye drop takes one mob.
---
You mean the one handed mace from Nefarien? The same boss mages get their mainhand upgrade from?
---
&gt;Nope.
---
According to [wowclassicpopulation.com](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?lastSeen=7) the last 7 days 43% of the characters spotted are level 60. And i think it is safe to assume that most people at level 60 has at least one alt above level 5, don't you think? I personally have 12 characters above level 5. So if we are conservative and say people on average has alt character above level 5 besides their level 60, that is still 86% of the population. Why do you think most people don't have a level 60 already? 
---
&gt;Someone who hasn't finished grinding dungeons for gear or is still struggling with gold would definitely rather not do BWL. It's a massive ramp up in commitments that a lot of players aren't yet ready for. 
---
You aren't forced to do BWL if it is there, most people will still do MC on the side, so even if you are only interested in MC and don't have a level 60 character yet, you will still be able to find raids to MC after BWL is released.
---
Except against hunters where you definitely need to get in their face!
---
That Frost Shock resist. I felt that.
---
Im on earthshaker its pretty damn balanced, also so high pop that we almost get queues but still dont.
---
Ok ok, i give you that! (Plus roaming around the world to kill dragons...)
---
If you are looking for a balanced server yeah. As horde there is plenty of PvP servers you can go and be in the dominant faction.
---
You can block certain words. Atleast with ElvUI there is an option under "Chat" settings.
---
The content has been milked dry years ago. We're waiting for content we've had for years. Stretching it out like this will kill a lot of interest in Classic.
---
They atleast don't despawn for 40 min each time he leaves desolace
---
I prefer Grid2 for raid/party frames, Shadowed Unit Frames for player, target and target-of-target, but can be extended to show party and / or raid frames as well. With this I'm using [mouseover macros](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/priest-healing-macros-classic-wow) instead of an addon like Clique, more out of habit than anything else, as well as HealComm - more important for raids and UBRS when you get to level 57/58. Also using Bartender for action bars, as they are easy to resize, move and keybind. 
---
You might think you want bigger health bars now, but if you all of a sudden find yourself having 40 health bars to watch instead of 5, you might re-think things. Just something to think about so you don't get overly attached to big health bars - at 40 people with big raid bars, raid frames will take up a large part of your screen. [Here](https://i.imgur.com/F5QYe2M.jpg)'s an example of what my UI looks like - note that I've hidden all my action bars to increase visibility. Got 5 full action bars worth of abilities and macros.
---
Kill emporor in brd or kill canonbro in strat live 100% drop
---
I have a priestess called “what” a warrior called “where” a shaman called “there”. I am with you on this!
---
Yeah for sure balance is ideal, I think I'll give that a shot yeah, thanks!
---
Sometimes I rush so fast, I crash the server
---
I farmed them for an hour or two when I got my divinity, it's super annoying and inefficient to solo so I gave up and just farmed maraudon for a bit (it only cost me 160g iirc, but I was on the low after crafting truefaith).
---
Went there about a month later to check for thorium, accidentally ran into a mob that someone else pulled and leashed, killed it and it dropped an eye, just seconds before the horde party went back and found me.
---
Bis lists are to strive toward not necessarily to obtain
---
The most beloved thread of all!
---
Is that all Arcane Wrath gear? I’ve heard flat spell damage is better, as it can also effect serpent sting(nature)
---
You can't sheep the pet, it's a demon.
---
Lol come on
---
I really like luna unit frames. You can also look into alt key modifier macros of various spell ranks. I have 3 ranks of flash of light on one key with shift and control for modifiers
---
\-you expect: people to perform, and help the guild NOW. For people to use consumables and their precious work and time and IDs. 
---
\-you offer: the VAGUE PROMISE of loot in the future. With the option for you to refuse loot. Even after the job is done.
---
Your """argument""": don't be an entitled manchild. Give everything you got, and don't expect to get what you want.
---
Outside? There's a vendor in one of the bunkers selling 4410 mana water that also grants a spirit buff, or 4410 hp+mana food (which is twice more hp than mage food).
---
A lot of LC guilds aren't min/maxing what comes in later phases and rather just have everyone get decent loot. You can call these whatever you want but it doesn't change the fact that warlocks have a good chance of getting drops.
---
This is so awesome! Just had to tell you guys that. It's very rare to see that type of thing still happening in WoW. That is what Old school wow was like. I'm loving classic though. You see a lot more of this there.
---
Took me a minute of staring at that painful screenshot to understand it. At first I thought you didn't want to roll on the ring of spellpower and I was very confused. In my guild we never roll for the blue items, they fund the guild bank.
---
Tiny tooltip. Took me a bit to get used to the change in fonts but it’s highly customizable.
---
Aimed shot the  multishot.
---
Keep sting and mark up. 
---
Feign death.
---
Simples!
---
Well he is gnome so how much can u ask for really Xd
---
From WoD we see that even without demon blood, if the orcs are given military power from another source they enthusiastically start the exact same genocidal campaign.
---
Demon blood or iron stars, give the orcs the means and the result is the same.  WoD conclusively proves that the demon blood excuse is just that, an excuse.
---
60 fury warr here. I read all the comments and I think you guys all could be playing more optimally. Keep in mind I mainly PvE
---
Here’s my setup 
---
- mouse wheel up - berserker stance
---
- mouse wheel down - defensive stance
---
(I have a side mouse button set to battle stance but honestly never ever use it)
---
In battle stance my main bar has- (in order)
---
1-bloodthirst 
---
2-cleave
---
3-heroic strike 
---
4- whirlwind (macro to switch to berserker and cast whirlwind)
---
5-demo shout
---
Q - sunder Armor
---
E- pummel (berserker stance macro)
---
R- taunt (defensive stance macro)
---
T - overpower 
---
F - charge/hamstring (macro with battle stance, charge, and hamstring - hamstring and charge can be on the same macro/button because you can only do one or the other at any given time. This is not optimal because it’s the only bind I have for hamstring, which can be cast in any stance. However it hasn’t been a big deal to me. 
---
C - execute 
---
V - rend (rarely use)
---
Defensive stance:
---
1- bloodthirst
---
2- cleave
---
3- heroic strike
---
4- revenge 
---
5- demo shout 
---
Q- sunder 
---
E- pummel (berserker stance macro - I almost never put a shield on so I don’t even use shield bash)
---
R- taunt 
---
T- overpower (battle stance macro + Spell Activations Classic - addon to show you overpower procs regardless of the stance you’re in)
---
F -charge/hamstring (battle stance macro)
---
C- execute (battle stance macro)
---
V - rend (battle stance macro)
---
Berserker stance :
---
 1- bloodthirst 
---
4- whirlwind 
---
5- demo shout
---
Q- sunder
---
E - pummel 
---
T - overpower (battle stance macro)
---
F- charge/hamstring (battle stance macro)
---
V - rend ( battle stance macro) 
---
Then, on my actionbar directly above my main bar ( does not change with stances) I have 
---
Shift-1 - deathwish
---
Shift 2- thunderclap (battle stance macro)
---
Shift 3- battle shout
---
Shift 4- bloodfury
---
Shift 5- usually a potion/consumable 
---
Shift Q- berserker rage
---
Shift E- bandage
---
Shift R- mocking blow (battle stance macro)
---
Shift T- shoot (ranged weapon)
---
Shift F- intercept (berserker stance macro)
---
Shift C- disarm (defensive stance macro)
---
Shift V- intimidating shout 
---
 
---
So, if you noticed 
---
F= charge
---
Shift F= intercept 
---
R = taunt
---
Shift R = mocking blow
---
All keybinds/ orders are up to personal preference however I way prefer to have all these stance dance macros and are very used to them. 
---
(Lots of info on macros but message me if you want to know more) 
---
I also have mount up on a different mouse button. Shift- mousewheel up/down zooms my camera in and out. 
---
Alt 1,2,3,4 I use for marking targets when I tank dungeons 
---
Not sure if I missed anything. I just can’t imagine hitting F3 and then another keybind to intercept quickly when it matters - which another commenter said he does
---
oh good hint I also downloaded the wrong one xD. Now I got the right one.
---
I've almost exclusively played it as a premade and won 99% of the games from neutral to exalted by doing this tactic. The 2-3 random games I've done I think we won 1-2 of them by doing this tactic aswell but it took closer to 15min.
---
I'd say 5 games and all lost is pretty unlucky. Keep at it!
---
If like to see the 140 Def gear those tanks were wearing in MC
---
Welcome back, old friend.
---
Questions for prot pallies:
---
1) Is the Greater Blessing spam the best threat generation method at 60?
---
2) Can the same be done with regular Blessings? Or do they not generate as much threat?
---
3) Should I heal until 41 then switch to tank (to get cons + BoS)? Or should I go up to 51 to get HS as well?
---
I basically am leveling my pally (after hunter and warrior), and I wanna tank but having troubles with threat (not 20 yet).
---
Druid is the least played class at high level and during leveling you can both be healer and tank making you great in pretty much every single 5 man group.
---
Should be no problem getting a guild as a resto druid and getting some sweet gear. They are also very attractive in WSG due to their flag carrying abilities.
---
How can i practice WSG jumps without gimping my team in a live match
---
Paladins are on of the easiest classes to level just a bit boring. Lots of auto attacking.
---
Drek in Dutch aswell
---
Actually I find the default UI for party/raid frames to be pretty good. You can display buff/debuffs on them through the bilzzard settings. You can also adjust size and location and even have different profiles for raids &amp; 5 men groups.
---
This + mouseover macros, add-ons are not as mandatory as many people would suggest for healing.
---
We had the green one drop of the second boss in UBRS. Quite funny is that the Boss is wearing the hat.
---
I'm a ret and I do around 430-460 dps on a static fight like Golemagg right now. And that's with just giants, mongoose and arcane elixirs. With full worldbuffs and flask, I'd probably be able to push 650-700 right now and around 800-900 in AQ gear
---
Im doing this when i get back home from work!!
---
So in your neanderthal brain the pservers are either 1% accurate or 100% accurate?
---
Perhaps it’s the fact that AV is actually improving ?
---
This is very accurate. The server is so busy it's almost not important it's not exactly 50/50. It feels like a busy, alive world and there's never a point where you feed outnumbered as such. If a big group of Alliance decide to take over BRM, hit up world chat and start those summons. Enlist the mercs!
---
I don't get it
---
same but its a priest named Around
---
Except I'm a rogue and only fight when I will win.
---
Probably, yeah. They've [added the support](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=299379/classic-patch-1-13-3-includes-support-for-paid-character-transfer-no-eta-for-ava) for it.
---
Private servers i guess
---
Yeah thats the next thing to look into I think. I don't know wich ranks to use to be the most efficent yet. or is it just so you don't waste too much mana if you don't need big heals?
---
That's what I wanted but the screenshot on the addon page doesn't show guild ranks?
---
The option is in there I had to turn it off cause I didn’t want it. It’s got a ton of features and toggles
---
Community hasn't created such a drastic faction imbalance on Vanilla. If you remove cross-faction BGs and lock it to server only, you are welcome to have 2h queues for Horde on PVP servers and 2h queues for Alliance on PVE servers, most of them.
---
Ah thanks!

---
&gt;The Alliance also tried to genocide the Blood Elves when the Belfs were still part of the Alliance!
---
That's not remotely what happened. Garithos had concerns about Kael'thas and his squad, warned about executing them (a squad) if they disobeyed. Kael'thas then went and allied with the naga, one of the few races in the lore of the game with zero redeeming qualities.
---
As a fellow traveler, I have only ever had an issue with getting it locked and having to unlock my account. 
---
You may get asked to do your security questions but thats about it.
---
Where is B in AV?
---
People are too busy due to it being AV week. Wait until the bonus honour comes off and the forums will be a shitstorm again QQing about the AV bots, which to be honest are a bit of a nightmare. As a horde it's not bothering me anywhere near as much as the version of AV we've got though.
---
This makes me so proud to be a troll.
---
Huh, the more you know
---
That's why I spice it up.
---
 "Hey there big Mage, mind helpin' a thirsty Priest out? ;)"
---
Gets 'em every time.
---
So now an expansion of the game with consequences in two different expansions (Gul'dan, Mag'har) is not canon? Ridiculous.
---
Literally every druid that heals me when I tank is oom after 3 mobs. The amount of downtime is nuts. Not talking about lvl 60 with alot of +healing. This has been me tanking zf, mara and what not. It's to the point where I won't pick a druid up unless they are resto.
---
Yeah extends mana pool greatly. I am not super familiar with the system but someone can link you a down ranking tool. MelderonTV also has a very good video on it but it’s like 30 minutes or longer
---
legs not available till phase 6.
---
As a hunter shooting those glass canons when they are drinking is so satisfying. 1 aimed shot is usually enough. But you can still ad a multishot if needed.
---
Ah well - that's a fair point I did not think of mentioning, but obviously one should not be using a rank 1 heal which normally heals for 50-60 before healing at level 60; one should consider what rank would constitute the "sweetspot" between decent healing output and HPM usage. Hopefully no 60s are sticking to their rank 1 heals in raids, for other purposes than proccing +25% armor buff on tanks that is.
---
You are a racist xenophobe
---
Looks pretty sick for some Voodoo Magic :P
---
Good Job!
---
So does UBRS, when you're in a raid party, not share the two hour trade lockout of raid loot then?
---
Same thing happened to my buddy Eliza... while we were levelling people kept trying to duel him in Duskwood haha
---
You can't proc armor buff with lesser heal :p
---
It's almost common knowledge that Russians (for some reason) are very poor if not incapable at communicating and coordinating with foreigners perhaps because of the online stigmatization of Russians and the subsequent hatred towards them in game and elsewhere. We've all seen it.
---
All things taken into account, this is probably the best case scenario for working things out. If you were to have russians mixed in with EU then you'd think it was the 4th of July by taking one look at reddit.
---
About the French and German - I've seen both in my AVs on my side, so I'm not quite sure where you're getting that. It appears that only Russians can queue in their region.
---
I had a guildie whose name matched with a part of the color tag for one of item rarities (you know, the |cFFA**ABBC**C one, for example). So every time an item of that rarity appeared in the chat, the chatlink would be garbled beyond recognition.
---
Dude. Defias. Better to poison a dog than be such a major dick as Sw was to them.
---
thanks, great advise and just what I was looking for.
---
Yeah, the fact you just rant and whine about something which isn't up to discussion is the one I point. At the moment you look and sound like a salty alliance who lost to RU premade (which is hilarious by itself), so now you complain about them having an option to make such a premade - if it wasn't your intent, you should think it over.
---
you can fish there quite low - but you wont catch any fish
---
Ooooooooooh
---
If russians are too shitty to play WITH, then IMO they shouldn't be played against either.
---
The problem of calling out players names is a pretty big one. Let them play on their own battlegroup.
---
Are you using the ledge to kite the imps? That was my biggest hurdle healing it.
---
No idea which heal you are using to proc it, but I know you get it from some heal - hopefully you might excuse my ignorance, as my other reply points out that I'm playing Shammy :)
---
LBRS would be much more viable in my opinion due to how the pulls can be managed and how much less sneaking past lacks there is.
---
Right click the queue icon on your mini map and choose enter battleground. Won’t get add on errors that way.
---
Depends on the server, some server prices are jacked way higher than others.
---
Isn't it lovely that someone who isn't really contributing to the success gets the prime loot because he also never uses his DKP to get upgrades that would help him just as much, but aren't as rare?   
---
DKP only works because this content is trivial.
---
thanks for the great reply. really appreciate it.
---
shouldnt dps warriors go dual wield anyway?
---
What happened to the details threat meter?  I did an update, and now it says the plugin is missing?
---
I am not ranting or whining. 
---
Why is this not up for discussion? The battle groups were implemented without consulting the community, if we don't give blizzard feedback on their mistakes they will never fix them.
---
I just won versus a russian BG, and also I play both horde and alliance.

You clearly haven't heard about Warsong.
---
LBRS the boss that drops the second gem has dropped the red hat 2/2 kills for me.
---
Better at what? Having more players on almost all servers?
---
Tell me why having better gear and more max level players *wouldn't* affect the win rate on AV. Then you'll have an actual point.
---
On my server there's someone named "come" so I see that coloured every time someone "has come online".
---
Classic pathing doesn't allow for the charge/intercept while in air though.
---
No we aren’t the bad guys. Our land was just run by bad leaders in the past so we are looking for a new home. Sure when we started looking I’m sure a few of us murdered, rapped, and pillaged. Their king has been heard calling us rapist and murders and a few other slang term I won’t repeat here. He even had a wall built in the highlands to try and keep us out. The alliance is a bunch of racist xenophobic nazis who won’t let us enjoy their lands.

Not that slow but i was 21 days to hit 60. A lot of afk time from launch when I was logged in 24/7 to avoid queues, and I swapped to boomkin at 40 to meme it up (it was worth)
---
Its so dumb. We're clearing MC without any issues (MC + Onyxia in 3h with 30 man groups) while atleast 75% of our guild is extremely bad players compared to my normal standards coming from raiding in retail, and our guild leaders are still extremely serious. All consumes, no PvP-speccs allowed, no meme speccs allowed etc etc, all the while the game is a total fucking joke.
---
I'll make sure to try and join a casual guild as soon as I can. I play for fun, and the game is so easy that its not like it matters. I'll happily play with boomkins and other suboptimal speccs, as long as we have fun. We'll clear everything without any big issues anyway.
---
5set T1 causes a weird link between you and pet from what I hear, not a hunter myself. I am pretty sure there are ways around it,  but if not you can just replace some tier.

Shamans need to be the keybind kings in classic. I've got tonnes of keybinds, probably around 25-30 - but even i struggled when i capped at 60 on my shaman.
---
My 1-4 is Earth Shock, Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Highest rank Healing Wave.
---
T is my Rank 5 Healing Wave, F is my Lesser Healing Wave and G is my highest rank Chain Heal.
---
Then i've got tonnes of totems on my mouse side button - which has 12 buttons. Each totem group you'll need at least 3-4 keybinds for semi-optimal play.

Next time, try actually taking all those people with you and ATTEMPTING the objective of killing Vann, rather than force a turtle.

Earthshaker: Firemaw refugees botch up our nice atmosphere.

Our first one went to a pally ;)

Good.

There is no mana burn to LoS on last boss; use an addon displaying enemy castbars to see when he's casting Enervate (the poison which drains your mana) and just insta-cure yourself. We're having trouble with pulling an add pack lately despite the boss being positioned well, that's been giving us some issues. Imps are a non-issue as long as the tank manages to hold them, so they're not all hammering away at you and causing your spellcasting to be pushed back. With Stoneskin they hit for 1-4 damage per hit. Purge the HoT he applies in tree form and the Thorns, and make sure to insta-cure the Wither disease from your warrior - it reduces strength by 100 IIRC, leading to a huge DPS loss. Also might be worth for him to stand in zerker stance as much as possible to push more DPS and burn boss quicker.
---
It is not my impression that is wrong, it is you who see whiners in everything you read.

ony head has a 6 hour cooldown, normal servers have guild coordinating to go get the buff.

They weren't evil in Wc3 and vanilla but Activision ruined the story forcing that narrative with Garrosh and Sylvanas.Them going evil makes no sense

Hahahahaha

I have a 50 druid I don't play on. I didn't do much healing as HotW/resto. I even had a decent healing set. But man I sucked at it. Like 5 decent heals and your oom lol.

You know horde run the majority of premises and you’re probably griefing.....
---
The split is not up for debate buddy, Horde palyers have a lot more players on almost all servers, if you are arguing with that then you're burying your head in the sand.
---
There's nothing inherently skilled or better about not being able to quest because you get 3v1'd constantly and there's nothing you've said that shows better geared players don't have an advantage. Bigger gear stat numbers kill faster and let you live longer, that's why you're killing faster and living longer in BG's. You still need to show why that isn't the case before being able to claim a greater skill level.
---
Honestly surprised me when i found it, as i had never heard of it before. I had just finished setting up my grid the way i like it and Aptechka still came on top with it being setup for every class, including defensive cds. I totally understand not to touch a working setup, nor would i normally do it myself. I just wanna recommend it to as many as possible, specially as ive notice nobody seems to have heard of it before either :)
---
Some salty people in this thread
---
[there is this lovely chart](http://i.imgur.com/k6Fevyc.jpgP
---
I, three, would like to know
---
DBM is supposed to do that but it doesn't seem to work.
---
There's a weakaura for it but I can't find the link right now :(
---
Thanks! =D
---
RDP phone AV is going to be a thing, I am sure about it.
---
Nope
---
stop being so reasonable this is r/classicwow !
---
Yup, sooo much honor.
---
You don't need to maintain rank. You had to originally IIRC but was quickly removed.
---
Just cause people were wrong and didn't account for all the changes that trivialize these raids doesn't mean Naxx is gonna be easy. Pugs will definitely not be doing it and many of the more casuals guilds wills struggle too. Like I said, Naxx used to be hard WITH all the changes that we already have now and with people being geared to the max from previous raids.
---
Haha I don't use it for the score, I use it for the stats
---
&gt; Horde palyers have a lot more players on almost all servers
---
Source?
---
Really? Feral tanks aren’t super common.
---
It's now been confirmed to me that it can be accepted at level 30!
---
This is what you guys are looking for. 
---
https://wago.io/jMD8pQ6ZP
---
So I'll never get demoted in other words? So if I get my rank 6 this week, I can celebrate xmas and take it easy, and not worry to be demoted/loose rank?
---
It's because for MMOs they are extremely useful. An extra hands worth of keybinds in easy reach. 12 buttons at your thumb, mouse wheel tilt, usually another 2 buttons near the wheel too. 19 vs 3 is a big difference. Also much easier to use modifiers on because they're on a different hand.
---
yes, you can wear the gear if you fall in ranks but cant buy it anymore. The rank restriction is only about beeing able to buy it so make sure you have the req. gold to do it when you reach one of the higher ranks
---
example: If you buy a rank 14 item like the weapon when you are at the rank then you can use the weapon at rank 1 (or any other)
---
Move on.
---
The problem with that is that it is boring as fuck
---
Ye I saw that in wago search results but couldn't find timers without honor tracker. I have them separately but I don't think they're on wago.
---
Seems like Alliance always runs past Iceblood and Towerpoint without capping them and then if someone points out why it would be a good idea, to despawn the marshals in Dreks room, they get shot down real quick by those spamming "ZERGRUSH GALV THEN HUT THEN DREK GOGO"
---
Im sorry little one
---
Yea but still doesn't compare to the 2mil honor stalagg n br1 from premade AVs...
---
And having fun in an epic BG?+Reputation and honor is still good in defense wins
---
Quality content, good job.
---
You'll be demoted in the sense that you'll need to grind your ranks again if you want to purchase higher rank gear, but once you buy your gear you can use it even if you stop PVP completely.
---
It's because this weekend is the AV weekend with bonus honour. Things will be get much better this week, once the bonus honour of AV is knocked off we'll see much higher participation in Warsong Gulch which is a much better PVP experience all-round IMO.
---
Its no wonder they have alliance flair rofl... Losing to horde who defends
---
Just remove the honor portion inside WA
---
I agree on the extreme min-max zergfest part; I also enjoy minmaxing, but the pserver crew (or whoever else it might be) have really pushed it to a whole new level to the point where it starts taking away from the fun of the game. 
---
I do however enjoy that I can once again farm stuff in the open world - unless you were grouped, or better yet, in a raid, it's been freaking painful to try and farm anything since P2 came out. And some AV-games that last longer than 10 minutes but shorter than 2 hours actually can be pretty fun.
---
Out of interest, what guild? Horde here too!
---
WSG/AB are going to be premade battlegrounds. PVP is a competitive thing, it's very hard to match people who apply more effort than you (in this case, by entering as a premade). Join or build a premade ourself and have fun!
---
If solo queue is absolutely your thing and you don't consider playing in a premade, then I suggest AV as the only battleground for you. It's pretty much solo q friendly.
---
Deathbringer has more damage than Vis but as you are on horde site i guess the orcs will get it  
---
Both would be really nice tho and the difference in damage would be quite minimal
---
The spellpower items for warlocks are good in BWL?
---
I still need 50 for Thorium Brotherhood reputation. Thanks!
---
&gt;Wowhead.
---
Any regularly updated link? Here is mine:
---
https://i.imgur.com/cgcKFFP.png
---
&gt;Alliance favour PvE heavily so they do level just as fast there, but Horde favour PvP so on PvP servers it's always easier for them to level.
---
So? That's not what you initially said and not what I asked a source for.
---
He walks trough desolace from the stone talon mountain border all the way to feral as where he despawns walks a bit turns around despawns again walks up to stone talon despawn
---
I enjoyed that part of TBC, when you complete the quest chains feels epic
---
It is called being left handed. We do exist, as much as the world, especially gamedevs with their hardcoded keybinds, wish we didn't :P
---
Imagine sending reply 2 hours later.
---
If the felhunter is out, I don't think there is a way. I die to mages 50% of the time when I have succubus or imp out (just stepped ou tof the instance). Maybe I just don't know how to play. :D
---
We killed rag third try with 1/3rd the ppl having FR and 32 ppl in the raid.  You’re not wrong.
---
You really dont need that much perhaps if you are only lock in the raid.And tou can always get them on trash in raids or in AV on npcs etc etc.Trying to keep 10 is enough
---
You can tank everything, including raid content.
---
Unless the extent of your classic ambitions is mid way through aq40, then yeah you should be trying to min max somewhat.
---
Fishin rping? For 10 days in game time?
---
Brutality is better as OH for PVP. 1st reason beeing the crit. 2nd the stats on BB and 3rd BB is 0.1 faster :p
---
How about we don't stop them from premade
---
I have less time in the game than this guy im level 60 300 fishing done all the dungeons more times than i needed and had lots of fun... I have no idea how it took this guy so long lol!
---
Feel free to check out my work at fb.com/stayupstaylow
---
Imagine being this triggered.
---
Thanks, this was the issue.
---
We've not even had an OEB, and never had one in my old guild too.
---
Sucks for the dps warriors, I guess.
---
Yes obviously capping everything is optimal, to bad we’re talking pugs and the fact that cordinaton isn’t there to do it effectively. 
---
Most the times we don’t rush galv then horde catch on and honor farm is the whole game. Turns into a turtle majority of the time.. with that being said anyone can make a min max list of AV. It’s all about the comp/grp you have.
---
That's what I wanted clarified. It crops up in half the threads regarding AV strategies and is not in the current classic build. We had a few runs where we had the guild MT just run in and pull everything at once. Turned lethal for the melee dps but the tank damage taken was nothing unhealable as long as Drek was disarmed.
---
I think its more like Dead island, even text are quite the same
---
fucking bravo
---
bollocks to the salty ebois in this thread, that's legitimately impressive
---
The stances are labeled as “special action button” 1, 2, and 3 for Battle, defensive, and berserker respectively in your key bindings menu,  personally I use shift+ scroll wheel up for battle, shift+e for def and shift+ scroll wheel down for berserker. I like having them on my mouse, feels much more fluid imo.
---
This is why alliance loses.
---
We have this on my server a bit but then people realized you can kill the marshal npc with horde toons and it lets you get the buff again lol
---
I’ve done almost every higher level dungeon with a bear tank in the group, you’ll be fine. I don’t know how others feel about bear tanks when lfg but I personally prefer bears over warriors because they tend to hold threat better overall.
---
If a guild has that priority order they would reasonably not let a meme paladin get onslaught over a fury war.
---
Well if you dont have a feral tank it doesn't matter.  But ferals have a really hard time getting hit compared to lots of other classes and these boots are 2% hit with 300 armour and 22 stamina, they are BiS for bears through all of classic.  They are also BiS for cat so feral gets far more use out of them.
---
I just use 16 slotters, more space for farming stuff and ill sometimes fill em up with soul shards
---
how does it matter?  You are ranked compared to other horde players, so its no issue. Just get in and get the honor you need. Killing Belinda and all the lts and commanders gives horde more honor than alliance normally get, so I honestly dont see the issue here.
---
Bartender 4 or Dominos addon.
---
Gives you ability to alter your main bar when you press modifier (Alt/Shift/Ctrl or combinations of theese like ALT+Shift) Also automatically changes with your stance. Like you can have overpower in battle stance on same button as revenge in defencive stance.
---
I usually change my stances WITH ALT+Q/E/R with Q, E, R being my main offencive rotation abilities without modifiers pressed that change depending on stance I am using. Shift and ALT pages are universal for all stances.
---
Only problem with theese addons that they use default 10 action button panels. I used to play with Trinity/Macaroon/Ion (same addon different names of builds) that allowed to create infinite number of buttons, untill addon author "Maul" stopped updating it.
---
Ironically, he was the exception because he was raised by humans.
---
By fire be carved!
---
No idea.
---
I understand the point entirely. DFT is also BiS for cats but I wouldn’t want to be in a guild giving it to them over rogues or warriors.
---
This is the way.
---
Why the hell do you need AV now? Just play premade WSG.
---
*laughs in EU horde player*
---
Better than  nothing
---
This ^
---
Finally, about time you found a mirror.
---
Both rep and honor only gets worse with game length. The only point you have is fun (which this isnt for a lot of people).
---
What prevent the horde from qing together??
---
Yes but coincidentally most games has 30 from one the servers and then 10 from others. Next game it's 30 from another server and then 10 from others. Clear evidence of premading right there..
---
But isn't Deathbringer the better MH for PvP - that's more the point I was getting at.
---
What new servers?
---
They will start at the same phase current classic is at
---
I remember we used to do this in AB with taurens riding kodos using firewater
---
I'm also lefthanded! :&gt;
---
Luckily, I ain't in terms of mouse/keyboard. Guess this is my feat. Condolences for you, mate!
---
Most of us grind AV for the cheap 100% mount.
---
Enhance shammy you can understand, but there are definitely pieces where feral tanks have priority over rogues.  You'll likely only have 1 feral tank as well so it makes sense that they get certain pieces first.
---
As a German all I can say pls remove the Russians ,holy shit it's so annoying
---
Enjoy your 1 month ban for griefibg lmao
---
Since you fail to define what's "make a premade" to you, here is your answer: everyone is allowed to make a premade, just like them, duh.
---
I have my Naga keys bound to Num keys, then use my mouse instead of hotkeys. Is that a problem?
---
DM East is also pretty easy to do and has some great loot.
---
I don't believe you had two hour queue time all the time, everyone are always exagirating, you probably had 10-25 minutes during peak hours and could reach 2 hours queue time post peak hours, I have played in those conditions to in one of Europes most unbalanced server faction wise. Like I said, there's plenty of solution to implement without going cross-realm to fight queue times, you don't have to go cross-realm.
---
And it was true in every server, exactly the same thing happened in factions who could reach hours of queue time, they stopped playing BGs when crossrealm was released, even tho they now had instant queue times.
---
Don't say it wasn't true on every server, it was, you either didn't really play Vanilla or you had no idea what was going on around if you claim otherwise.
---
We did that except for the last group of mobs 😄
---
We saw, but thanks for spreading that link around! 
---
Probably dealing with outdated Questie version, current tooltip code checks if the target is a creature.
---
But you foster a raid team now for later content. When aq comes out do you kick the pala from your 40? Force him to go holy now? Or do you just not bring a ret in the first place saving yourself the headache down the road?
---
Tryhards strapped for time.
---
True, as an ally i have instant queues and the only nameplate I see is Drek.
---
Yeah that honor is about right.Final score doesn't even count HKS which you get way more in longer bg. Just 10 kills (solo) are 2k estimated honor .Even with diminishing returns you get plenty on HKs alone
---
You lose up to half a rank per week so if you plan to leave for some time you probably want to take it easy until then.
---
It most certainly does
---
Source: Rag fights
---
Lifetap is a lock spell.
---
You could probably experiment with 100 of solutions to fight queue times for BGs, crossrealm isn't the only solution, it was only the simplest one according to Blizzard who went with it.
---
how is doing molten core and every other raid you've already done to death every week for more than a year the best thing about classic wow
---
Have the same issue here. Guilds start raids all from 17:00  to 21:00 and everyone want ony  buff to speed it all up.
---
So guilds "ninja"-buff early in the morning to lock it to specific times. And sometimes random pug players ruin it by just popping the head at 16 if it's possible ruining buff for all guilds.
---
All fun
---
Fuck yeah
---
No, they changed it so you couldn't stack a bunch of elixirs early into TBC.
---
For alliance 2h weaps should go to ret pally no? Like if you brought a ret pally then he'd take prio on it since it's pve for him.
---
I thought it was since Orgrimmar is the main city and so I thought that IF was the main Alliance city (I base it off the fact that both cities have 2 racial leaders, but that is probably totally wrong)
---
Haha great running with you too! And i was able to get that 55 glorious water! It was a great time you guys were accomadating and understanding haha. Let's get down soon!
---
You nearly tricked me in that clever web of words, of things I didn’t say. Top Reddit’ing there
---
New server? Why?
---
Horde biased sub? Are you delusional?
---
How many fucking posts have we seen these past few months where alliance players non-stop bitched that the game was broken in the horde’s favor? Get your petty shit off this sub.
---
I feel like getting in range to life drain is more important for me + I use silent fang/mageblade switch macro so I'm always going melee range against casters
---
Mad and bad
---
I kinda want that...
---
Yes i knew this and thats why i am always asking ppl to defend bunkers in longer games :-)
---
True that. Gotta keep the pace up as much as possible. The dungeon is definitely longer in terms of walking distance.
---
Like which for example, you mention 100, give a list with at least 10 effective please?
---
The first shadow talent thingy with gain mana bacl after a kill xD
---
This definitely makes it sound sleezier.
---
1. a lot of people are fine with r11-13
---
2. well some people will, why not me?
---
/u/OrangeKefka You are probably using an old version of Questie, as the current code checks if the target is a creature or not. Please let us know if this happens with the current release (v5.3.1). You should see your version in the ingame addon list or when mousing over the Questie minimap button.
---
If you indeed have an old version you can get the latest release from [Github](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev/releases) or [Curseforge/Twitch](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/questie/files).
---
Guilds that realize that raid improvement is more important than a single players performance. Warriors have tons of options with edgemasters, rogues don't and you won't get enough sword weapons for them if you let any fury warrior go for it as well.
---
Oh i thought asmongold did MC on his rogue before 55
---
On horde side perhaps, on alliance we have equal priorities on swords for fury/rogues (most warriors aren't human, even). DB is nice, but the only axe in BWL is too fast for fury.
---
Pallies shouldnt be judged by their dps parse. Ahould check their healing done, dispells and else to have an idea how that player contributed on the fight.
---
A mage topping charts on every fight but 0 dspells done is a bad raider on every book
---
No.
---
You can go to MC without attunement, it just takes longer to enter through BRD. But you cant enter ony lair without amulet, and that chain requires 55 iirc
---
I dont see why the price of consumables should be that big a factor in deciding a release date for phase 3. You don't have to use consumables, and there are often cheap alternatives. 
---
&gt;Then the last phase is out in less than a year.
---
I don't think that is necessarily a problem. I prefer that over having extended periods of time between each phase that aren't fun.
---
How did you know? She would roll alliance if she had the choice.
---
its so funny that poeple who blames the players actuelly exists 🤣
---
I uninstalled details 2 weeks ago, after struggling with it since launch.  I picked up recount and it is better, and I havent experienced any bugs yet.  Get recount.
---
Don't listen to the people telling you to grind gold. Go farm pre raid bis gear. Getting all the pieces is a long grind and gold just pours in as a side effect. Odds are you will have your mount money when you're done.
---
If you just purely grind gold you will have nothing but an epic mount when you are done. The other way you will actually have decent gear and an epic mount.
---
You gotta remove that auto-attack button on your bars and just att a /startattack macro to most of your rogue abilities man. I'm actually hurtin here
---
If you are talking about PVE, it isn't even necessary to change your weapon for two reasons. First, you have multiple ways of insta-mana regen through demonic/dark runes, mana potions, mana gems, and robe of archmage. With the MC fights being very fast, you will never run out of mana. Second, swapping weapons in combat causes a GCD, so you are are losing damage to gain negligible mana back as you need to swap weapons twice.
---
Prob what the other shaman was trying to tell him.
---
Warriors are very dependent on gear, probably more than any other class. Running a lot of dungeons is a good idea while leveling, and if you're willing to rank it's easy to form groups. 
---
I'm also finding it helpful to stay a couple of levels ahead of the quests/mobs I'm facing.
---
It‘s not a guild hosting the pug. We call the pugs the FIRE BRIGADE. Because everyone liked to see the world burn. *But we don‘t*.
---
We're talking about horde's ability to control the map and reach top level and best gear faster so if the alliance heavily favour PvP that obviously makes that point, lol.
---
Surely you can see that alliance not being on the PvP servers as much means that the horde have an advantage?
---
You argued that bigger stat numbers wouldn't affect things and I think I've realised the issue... do you not understand that bigger numbers are bigger than smaller numbers? because otherwise i don't know how you would think it doesn't affect it.
---
&gt; They enslaved the Orcs, who had been under a spell put on them without consent.
---
Oh, so it was a Gul'dan how manage to convince orcs to drink Mannroth blood.   
---
If only someone could stop orcs from this dreaded fate. Someone to attack when they started drinking blood. Someone with Iron will to unify tribes.  
---
Yeah, they definitely would be better! Not like this "old Horde".
---
nope, showed up again just to tell me not to try again
---
&gt; Later I found a Nice priest and he stand by my side to kill the mob, this goddamn shaman show up again in the middle of the fight just to say "wtf are you doing, this mob is immune to all kind of spells, give up" Blazerunner died just after he spoke out.
---
I got one from Cannon Master Willey in Strat live!!
---
Which math? AV food gives twice more *hp* than mage alternative, on top of taking up less slots. Even healers have to eat sometimes.
---
10 spirit and a bit more mana is not much but it's still better than nothing. If you have mages feeding you endless water you can skip that but I find it very handy to carry some stacks in case I can't find a mage when I log in.
---
Keep your knees on the ground
---
I'm ally, no idea why other ally are salty... They played it well.
---
&gt;I pulled the elemental with the quest item
---
As 52, i couldn't solo him, 5 hits to death
---
You dont have too.
---
But then you have plenty of reasons to still do MC. And not rush the death of the game. After phase 6 there is nothing. The longer each phase takes, the longer i get to play vanilla wow.
---
Are all NA realms in the same battlegroup, or are there multiple battlegroups?
---
I'm alliance, I downvoted you because you're a dickhead. Mate.
---
It says invite only. Can you send me one please?  Danked#3640 is my discord.  I would be most grateful. thank you.
---
I would definitely enchant that, but it depends on your budget. That coupled with an AV offhand will be good enough for next phase, you could wait for a mageblade forever.
---
aint no skill when the warrior doesn't trinket kidney

Depends on how long this "long time" is and how far down you are on the priority list for it. I think we've had 1 or 2 drop for us so far, and our raid has been running two groups for months. Obviously depends on luck, but if there are many people before you who will get to loot it, you might as well pop on +30 and be done with it. If nothing else, that will probably increase the Mageblade drop rate tremendously, causing you to get it and consequently forcing you to enchant it.
---
Should have won the war beforehand
---
Just commenting to say I'm glad the Daily Questions Megathread is back. It was my main reason to come to the sub.
---
Care to explain yourself?
---
mate you’re a fucking master detective
---
Warriors aren't that bad to level. Paladins are by far the worst. Any good warrior or rogue will tell you that warriors are better levelers than rogues. Burstier, takes less damage and more frequent AoE all contributes to warriors being noticably faster than rogues, In addition to that, rogues are shitty in dungeons whilst leveling, while warriors are really good.
---
Garrosh did nothing wrong
---
Again, you seem to fail to realize what you said 
---
&gt;Horde palyers have a lot more players on almost all servers
---
Is wrong. They don't have a lot more.
---
I think because it is additional damage TO your melee attack it will also Show as blocked when your melee is blocked but the damage Output is the same.
---
TL;DR: I think it is a log error (bug)
---
For 5 man dungeons, bears are pretty good all the way to the end.  It's the raid content where some people have problems with bear tanks.  I've run everything from BRD and scholomance to UD strat with a bear tank, and it all went pretty smoothly.  At a time when tanks are in high demand, people arent going to care so much about you being a bear, but they will care about your level.  
---
If I'd been looking for a tank for BRD for 30 minutes and I got a whisper from a level 56 druid who was confident in his/her tanking ability, I'd invite you.
---
If it would be only this simple.
---
As a bear you need your migitation. SHOTM is fairly easy to get (enchanting mats up to 265 aint that expensive) while the combo with mark of tyranny gives you a good armor base to for instance use devilsaur for threat. Not having the trinket limits your options.
---
I suggest first completing all the high level quests for money.
---
For farming I recommend taking either herbalism or mining. Both are pretty effective on druid as you can stealth to nodes which other people cannot reach without engaging in combat. (example - in Mazthoril is mostly one rich thorium, sometimes its right at the haleh portal in the cave, but sometimes you need to pass a few mobs and elite dragons)
---
If you currently only have enchanting you can learn both gathering professions (after getting the trinket), see what one makes you the most money and discard the other for some other profession you like.
---
Because some people have a life and dont raid every week for a year
---
Seal of Command correct.
---
Yes, it is holy damage, however, it is still treated as a weapon swing. Weapon swings are prone to be blocked, parried, missed, etc.
---
This is working as intended.
---
&gt;The longer each phase takes, the longer i get to play vanilla wow.
---
I don't think this is a good reason to decide how long there should be between each phase. 
---
People will still do MC after BWL is released, so that won't be a problem.
---
What if you’ve no energy?
---
I just wanted to Display the sheer amount of unskilledness that is prevailent in his Family. 
---
It is not only him that sucks - it is his whole Family.
---
:D
---
As others pointed out, no luck for you in that department. When and if they are added is anybody's guess - if I were you I'd just reroll on their realm. It doesn't take super long to get back to the 40s, and they can probably chip in with some mount money and/or the occasional blue leveling item for you.
---
Looks like he's laughing!
---
It's a really toxic, elitist rep grind atm. People flaming if the game isn't over in 10 minutes. Calling you trash if you get killed by horde and can't "rush south" cause the horde dominate mid. Alliance are so brain-dead in particular, if their rush fails, most just quit the game. It's quite pathetic.
---
if it aint **F R E S H** i dont want no game. in fact, just launch a F R E S H realm every day of the week
---
Our guilds main off tank is a bear.  He does great.  No problem clearing all content available.
---
You surely like using reddit as a free advertisement and promotion base, huh.
---
So two days ago I was on here talking about how the Horde had figured out the Alliance zerg and if they wiped the initial zerg with defense Horde normally won. I was sitting at an absurd winrate on Saturday. 
---
Then yesterday I played a few games throughout the day and it seemed like everyone forgot how to counter the zerg. Did anyone else experience this and start losing again? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!
---
What is that tho? I don't think it's a thing in my country
---
Not really, turn off what you dont want and have it do what you want. 
---
Kind of the nice part of Elv is the alacart.
---
YES!
---
Everyday they start FRESH and every 14 days they get deleted.
---
Perfect :)
---
Then there is 1 vanity realm where you can Transfer your characters from the seasonal realm to.
---
Sounds like Diablo - but better
---
"Jokes on you, I am broke"
---
I had the exactly the same issue by updating it yesterday. What you need to do is uninstall it, and install "details! damage meter classic wow". What happens is that it somehow updated to the retail version, or that they decoupled the retail and classic versions. 
---
The good news is that, if you do this, it keeps your settings (I've done it through the twitch app).
---
Ah so we're abandoning the original topic of horde having an advantage at the moment?
---
Cool, sure I'll concede that when I meant to say that horde have more players on PvP servers, more max level players and more fully geared players, that i said they have more players overall.
---
Not sure what that does for your overall point about horde simply being better (I'm lying it does nothing for that point) but I give you that tiny victory.
---
That's exactly how the system works anyways. Rank 14 is not achieved by being the best, it's by grinding the most.
---
Yep, there is really no reason to not release BWL soon at this point, people can circlejerk all they want about how they want stretch the game thin of content and watch the population drop, but having another raid in the game would be fantastic.  
---
And the sad reality is that the people that advocate for longer phases are most likely the people that will quit soon enough, they spam reddit/blizzard forums with how classic content is being released too fast and how min/maxers are ruining the game, then suddenly 3 weeks later they find out, "Wow, this lack of content is boring, I'm gonna play another game", and then they disappear into the night, never to post their final 'Maybe I was wrong' post, leaving the circlejerk alive.
---
I still think it's a big overkill on both the loading times (unless it's heavily optimized to only load used modules?) and configuration options for one small part of it.
---
Spirit tap :0)
---
His username is relevant.
---
Guys, I'm 41 on my druid and 15 on my warrior, I don't have time to play much.
---
I see everyone farming MC (and BWL when it comes out), and people are already exalted Alterac etc.. 
---
Is it worth it? I'm having fun and all, but last time I played I was doing server first kills in PvE..
---
Lesson learned, regardless he stops his farming, come closer to me, target the mob I'm about to fight and start jumping, just after I called him for help.
---
All PvE servers except Mankrik are Alliance dominated.  On PvE servers, faction balance is not a big deal.  I heartily endorse play on a PvE server.  You can queue BG's and play with all of the PvP bois, but don't have to worry about getting ganked in the world if you don't want to.
---
Holy hand grenades
---
I might go for this too, Details has given me some issues in AV and I had to disable it. Any similar problems with Recount? I remember using Recount in some retail expansion, I quite liked it but didn't find a working version when I first started Classic.
---
Spirit Tap
---
Yes I did - the answer is, drumroll please: just don’t do raids you don’t want to? I know, astonishing, isn’t it?
---
Can we get an example of one?
---
Indirectly, yes.  However it's the result of the burning legion meddling on azeroth. 
---
If BL never existed: 
---
&gt;Khadgar, the orcs, draenei, and all of the events in Outlands/Draenor leading up to the opening and to current day (including retail) would never have happened.  
---
&gt;The Emerald Dream would never have been corrupted.  Fandral staghelm and likely Illidan would still be normal night elves.  Nor'drasil/world tree still standing. 
---
&gt;Neltharion (deathwing) would see oversee the black dragon flight and likely still wage war on the old gods.
---
To get back onto topic:
---
The orcs were peaceful before the burning legion attacked. Mostly shamans and hunters at the time.  When corrupted they became bloodthirsty, killing everything that stood against them, including their own kin.   
---
Because of the burning legion, humans and night elves have a deep footed hatred for orcs and their allies, whether or not they still rape.and pillage their settlements.
---
Yeah horde have a huge terrain advantage in AV, dont they?
---
Ah, I usually run all the way through and pull those into the stairway that goes down to rattlegore.
---
Make some macros but more importantly, get used to stancedancing. You don't wanna be a bum and pull your guildies down.
---
need more info pls
---
This is what people don't get. When you're ranking, 20 - 30 min queues, means 20 - 30 min queues for everyone else ranking on your server too, so you  can actually take breaks or queue from work. Instant queues means you have to play constant BGs as well, the honor cap on your server goes up etc. 
---
When I ranked in Vanilla before cross-realm there were no queues popping for alliance between about midnight and 8 am, which meant sleep was possible. I logged in to check banks before work this morning at 6 am, and people in my guild were on grinding AVs.
---
lol mad i got these on my second run and haven't gone back to wc since
---
I always used recount from TBC until Cata when I unsubbed, and I love it.  I've only been using it for a couple weeks now, but havent had one single problem.  It's really easy to parse your damage too - I never could get details to work.  I'm sure that's because I didn't download something right etc.... but just get recount it's easier and better IMO.
---
What I do
---
Load tool tips and party/raid frams. 
---
Rest of the stuff if done via other addons. 
---
I clear my catch once a week Nd had zero issues with load times, so not sure what specifically you are referring to. 
---
Each sub set of mods has a “deactivate” option.
---
It's treated as a spell AND a melee attack. It's pretty silly. It can get resisted and partially resisted too.
---
you can see that the ally ain't using neatplates, id they did, that plan wouldn't work
---
It's not that new but it's a pretty uninspired insult template
---
I had some really crappy games yesterday too. Might be bad luck, or then the decent Hordes are already exalted and quit AV / the Allies decided that in addition to pulling off some quick Drek rushes, they can also prevent Horde from capping bunkers and stalling them at bridge. 168 rep game is not very productive with 11 minute queues, but then again, I saw some guildies bragging about getting 2k rep in 3 games. Guess I just pulled the short straw a few times.
---
are the epic legs in?
---
Dracarys
---
Sure, but we are taking about ret Paladins.. They don't heal while they do bad dps, when a holy plain could do heals and at the same time dispel shit.
---
Kurinaxx west coast pvp is good!
---
It will still work - first goes the macro to start attack, second ability itself
---
No, mageblade is his for pally.  Doubly so because we can’t use the staff.
---
Nah, we're just Metal.  Have a corpse of a tree in the middle of our major city.  Throw some skulls, shields, chains on it and boom Heavy Metal Winterveil Quest.
---
Sorry, my bad. I assumed that mage food restored as much hp as water does mp. I was wrong. Happy holidays!
---
I'd say yes as Deathbringer got more damage both the range and per seconond. So bigger crits when in fury using whirlwind. Fury overall is not optimal for pvp as is but i guess Deathbringer damagewise is like a blue 2h axe so it can make a punch sometimes
---
How am I supposed to call out a russian name in voice? Please enlighten me.
---
I don't care if you are russian chinese spanish or whatever the fuck. You shouldn't be allowed to premade, and I shouldn't have to eat my throat trying to pronounce your name on voice.
---
One of three scenarios occurring here. 
---
1. Druid is bad and not downranking efficiently 
---
2. You are bad and taking too much damage
---
3. The DPS are bad and taking too much damage
---
What's your honor for this week?
---
So salty
---
Dark Whelpling just dropped.
---
so much salt
---
? there are a shitload of awful mage bugs
---
Not really, the ones done with the rep mostly went on to play WSG because they actually enjoy PvP.
---
I think I'll go for it as well, Details feels very finicky and whenever I try to swap the "Display DPS/Damage/Dispels/Interrupts" to a different category I seem to hover the mouse pointer in the wrong spot, causing the menu to disappear - infuriating. 
---
I'm not sure Recount comes with any threat plugin, but I'm already using ClassicThreatMeter as well so should not be a major issue.
---
I have a druid named Driud, a warrior named Warior, and a hunter named Huntar.
---
That's the thing, there's not a lot of options. Edgemasters opens up axes and daggers, but you're not going to take daggers over dagger rogues (especially if the guild is PVP inclined), and humans should not take axes over non-human fury.
---
As far as I know, no
---
Are you having fun? Then does it matter much what everybody else is doing? 
---
If you don't have time to be server #1 and R14 then you just don't have the time. I am level 60 and I'm playing 4 hours each week to do MC. And that's what I have time for.
---
&gt;horde have more players on PvP servers
---
That's a nice backpeddle, what happened to "almost all servers"? Yeah, your bad indeed.
---
So while you agreed you were actually wrong with this one, we can proceed to the next point. What was it? More max level players? That's actually correct but irrelevant. Horde having more lvl60 characters doesn't have to do anything with Horde being better and winning. If anything, it gives them longer queue time but that's about it.
---
Hello! This bot is just ... what I was looking for. Please, I'm begging you, can you add a The Elder Scrolls Online template ?
---
A lot of testing has gone into SoC. Basically it procs about 7 times a minute. This means it will do a lot more damage than SoR, if you use a slow 2h weapon. By slow I mean 3.2 or slower.
---
I’d say RPing à fisherman! You have to take your time!
---
You sound like an entitled kid, raging and crying. Not a good look smh
---
Totally with you, I'm glad we were heard.
---
How?? If one faction eliminates the other it doesn't mean there is somehow less power left in total, it's a zero-sum game. It would be much easier for the Alliance, as it would have fewer worries and more land, resources, and subsequently people in it.
---
Havent had any problems with warriors at all. I beat most classes if I get the opener except on pallies and hunters
---
Step 2: Get yer pliers and walk em to the lift.
---
If you threat someone for water, don't except to have some.
---
I'm just afraid it'll be hard to do some content, when everyone is overgearing it and won't come back there.
---
Same for gold, prices keep rising because there's more money. And I have 50g in total and 0 mount, for example, no time to farm, no time to put groups together if no one wants/need to do them etc.
---
Yeah I mean, shouldn't we be able to do this with  gnomes? Thanks for the strat! Duly Noted!
---
Yes, but we don't need any more non rpers on ZT.
---
Can you?
---
If you have your mont and some gold and friends stick it out. 
---
It will just take a little more work on your end and a guild willing to take you in (if you dont have one). 
---
As long as your server is not dead, you should be fine.
---
The best Thing is - yes you get your epics "Fast" in a classic Point of view that is fast.
---
In retail you can get 4+ epics per hour with Little trying. Most of them are useless sure. 
---
In Classic "fast" epics are epics which you grind 12+ Hours of stail PVP/E Content for. That is in no way shape or form "fast" xD
---
Good reason not to watch him - but still good effort for the Video. I just don't Support your viewpoint @OP
---
Same goes for water!
---
Making jokes in an online game isn't the same as killing but you can think whatever you want

Do you mean trash farm or can they actually solo alzinn.
---

The stickies being the only topics that are worth anything on this sub, I'm glad this one is back.

---
It's like being upset that cows eat grass.
---
Cows gonna cow

Humans gonna human
---
Dang that sucks. Shaman were all the rage on ours, especially once it came to light how OP chain heal was. I think during BT/Sunwell progress we had 3-4 resto shaman and 1 enhance.
---
Always funny seeing horde trying to desperately stall alliance and failing every single time. Galv always dies before balinda and the game is usually over in 7-8 minutes.
---
You farmed us 10 to 1 in world pvp now we farm you in BG's, enjoy your queue times "pvp faction".
---
Yep, still works. It's a lot easier and cleaner imo than either pressing "T" or having it on your bars.
---
ye hate mages not react - i always open trade without ask first.
---
Some dont even react if i emote /oom
---
I am referring to the official blizz channel
---
Thats amazing i want it
---
dont feel bad! Its a nice spot to get Rich Thorium Veins while farming the mobs
---
Loving the tears from the PVEers who hate AV but are forcing themselves to do it. Nomnomnom
---
Alright, it seemed a bit rude. But no problem.
---
learn to read cyrillic, and fuck your rubberish Name.

xenophobic douchebag.

Basically if it has crit its bis for pally.

get educated, ROFL.
---
You’re an asshole and you’re abusing game mechanics to grief enemy player.
---
Oh I replied to the wrong person lol my bad
---
It does kill them if you shoot them far enough to the west. But if you shoot them too far towards east, then they will survive. Like that warrior did.
---
Isn't the blue set released in a later phase?
---
well I like the afk and fish people way more than the turtle and drag-out guys
---
Sry but, a not good looking shaman is the one who roll a **Supportive** class, and don't do anything to **support** a mate in trouble, mainly after got asked. 
---
But of course nobody has any obligation to come help. 
---
Just saying, don't give hope to the hopeless, this is not good looking shaman
---
The forsaken for sure were evil from the start. Literally one of the first quests is to slaughter the human “infestation” and make a new plague to turn captured prisoners into a ghoul.
---
If 1 army eradicates the other, they will not, within a couple of years, magically have the combined manpower. Especially as both armies are reasonably equally matched.
---
It gives two chances to downvote though.
---
Lmfao the mental gymnastics you must go through on a daily basis. Then what are your previous comments on this post if not “effort”?
---
Very true 👍
---
If you don't want the guild to get better, then sure, improperly distribute BiS loot.  Give a top 4 dps class's  BiS to a below-the-tanks class.  I'm sure the Boomkin and Spriest should get Mageblade before the Locks and Mages too
---
Odd. I use Sexy Map and so far, the BG Button still works; ~40 AVs and going.
---
It also appears this is a problem with Blizzard's FrameXML "addon" (a lot of the UI is done up like you would via addons). I got a post over at the official forms (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/lua-error-after-battlegrounds-implemented/389031) and people have responded saying they get the same error, but with different addons.
---
And that disabling those addons just leads to other addons throwing the same error.
---
why should I care about reading your damn moonrunes no one else uses?
---
Fucking awesome, that's so cool. Kill him.
---
Elemental got shafyes hard in TBC too.
---
Again, gained no form of CC's or stuns so they were bad in arena... But then what made it 10x worse was lightning bolt and CL became 0.5 seconds slower cause they nerfed lightning mastery talent. So now you COULD NOT cast your lightning spells while being attacked and you had zero panic buttons (stuns, cc, fear. Bubbles, WTC.) .
---
Yes they gained some sustainability pve with regen from talents but you also lost about 25% compared to vanailla by casting so much slower.
---
The only way to play a shaman was to be Resto which just felt like a shitty Resto druid without bear or cat form.
---
People will be doing MC and ony for the rest of eternity. Relax and enjoy the game.
---
From grinding all weekend, i found that the most rep/hour was when the games were (as you say) 20-25 minutes long, so that you have time to complete all the turn-ins available (wingmasters and blood for the boss), and then win. The absolute worst is when both teams do the rush and Alliance wins, since that only gives around 150-200 rep, and kicks you back out into a 15 minute queue.
---
Well I can only assume, but based on TV shows it seems wildly addictive. Not sure if it compares to wow, though, that would necessitate an extensive and border-line illegal scientific experiment to investigate. 
---
In any case, those horizontal groups should be yours for the taking. DO IT!
---
I find it also really useful for dungeons. Like I was surprised to notice after doing strat live/undead I’d get about 4-5g in passive silver from mobs. It’s a nice QoL addon I find
---
yes, but at least from what i remember in actual vanilla, it was very possible to achieve high ranks doing only WSG premades and nothing else.
---
now, you solo queue into a boring shitfest of a BG and get rewarded for being afk.
---
I’m also glad you made it to your 8-5 desk job just fine, I was beginning to think your little game had ended. You’re my entertainment for the morning so please don’t quit

ASHBRINGER-EU 
---
Horde side Warlock looking for raiding guild that does later raids than the others during weekdays. 
---
I’m based in the UK/Ireland timezone and I can’t raid before 20:30 Server time (= 19:30 in UK) due to odd workhours/long commute.
---
Ideally the guild would start around 21:00 Server time (=20:00 UK time).
---
Alternatively would anyone with the same issue as me be interested in creating a new guild that does later raids? I’m happy to create the guild but I would need some officers and raid leaders/class leaders
---
When i see some classes AOE on the flag knowing it won't stop the capping of a flag makes me laugh. Only stuff like arcane explosions, holy nova, whirlwind stops capping. Also iron grenades and sapper charges. Not stuff like blizzard or rain of fire.
---
Here's a link to a BiS list from Fight Club, the place where all the sweatiest warriors hangout and discuss.
---
 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;sle=true#)
---
That would be a fun build for TBC, DW Edward the odds and focus 100% on spell damage.
---
I recommend joining the warrior discord channel "Fight club" I use their bis-list and like them a lot more than wowhead
---
Depends on the ideas and views, duh.
---
Yes, though I think it's plausible for other options to become viable eventually due to HS canceling reducing the significance of hit.
---
queue times are great. plenty of time between queues to craft, buy/sell, world pvp for minmax honor, etc.
---
also, having lower honor rate from av spam allows serious rankers to pull ahead more easily. 
---
all around, great decision by horde to play to win.
---
Because it provides a very real sense of character progression even for new characters. Whereas on retail you ding max level and are just fed whatever catchup gear there is and then you're in the final raid, in classic you ding max level and you begin the grind. You actually play through all the content in the game and not just whatever the new and shiny is. It means there's always groups for all the raids and there's a lot of content for you to run.
---
It's not for everyone, which is why retail is the way it is now. And that's fine because classic is also around now.
---
it was great. played it from launch till well into EOTN farming.
---
the day i quit was they day they nerfed solo farming. basically they started making it so if you killed a large amount of mobs as a solo player (ex: one big mass AOE skill) you would receive less drops than if you used a skill that would kill the same mobs, but over a longer timeframe.
---
So Earthquake builds or Meteor builds stopped being viable, but you could sliver armor mobs down and be fine.
---
Sell tank service. People will pay out the nose for a geared and skilled tank.
---
I still use that in classic lol I’ve had many rogues blind my pet or a lock deathcoil it
---
Not gonna lie, even in a lot of guilds that consider themselves casual you'd get in trouble for not bringing any consumables.
---
I think there were talents in enhance that buffed your so too via strength. 
---
And since they nerfed lightning mastery, it wasn't like you could spam lightning bolts as hard ad you could in vanilla anyway.
---
exactly !
---
A druid!
---
* Leveling is a blast with +30% movement speed at level 21 (2/2 feline swiftness) and +40% movement speed at level 30 (travel form)
---
* You can spec [something like this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505030130302215-05501310501), collect 2 sets of gear, and you can tank or heal almost any encounter (some raid encounters really require warrior tanks, at least on horde side since they have no fear ward) for great versatility and you'll most of the time be able to help your friends out if you want to.
---
* You are the #1 pick for WSG flag carrier for some pvp action
---
Cool, thanks. I’ll just work out what gear I still need and go grind for that. Seems to be a lot of money in disenchanting from blue drops too, so worth the runs no less

Hi, /u/dat303

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ebf5b7/will_snowballs_still_work_after_winter_veil/).

and then out of nowhere the  MT quits and all hell breaks loose
---
You're the mvp of the day
---
you will learn, and eventually get the hang of it. By that time, you will almost always beat warriors, Paladins, easily beat rogues, hunters, priests, have problems against warlock, shadowpriest, some shamans.
---
Druids and priests cant use swords, try again
---
They are probably hearthing/flying to PvP spots while waiting in the AV queue.
---
If you're updating via Twitch, you need to revert to DetailsClassic.1.13.3.187.141 under the Versions tab.
---
Its pretty obvious no?
---
Classic wow is released in 6 phases. Once phase 6 is released there is no going back. Then the game is dead. 
---
So the greater spaces we have between each phase. The longer i get to play my favourite game. I dont care for TBC or retail. I just want vanilla. The same as many others playing this game.
---
If you are getting antsy and bored with the game in its current phase you can do something else and wait for the phase to come. Play a different game, take up a hobby or whatever. If i get the phases released in a faster order i cant do something else. Im stuck with it. Thats the difference.
---
If enough people report you you jump right over the warning to the instance kick.
---
Not entirely sure, primarily because of the old guns. The Russian Orthodox Church is very much married the government, and I've seen pictures of them blessing government servers and such.
---
Many of them. VuhDo is nice for setting up your bars and customizing them, and shows incoming heals (heals from other players so you don't race to heal and waste your mana). Supports mouse over healing as well, really all you need in 1 package. 
---
Grid2 for bars is ok, healbot some like as well. 
---
If your just healing 5 mans, it's easy just to make a macro to heal on mouseover without clicking. I did that till I started doing MC, then I realized not being about to see the incoming heals was a pain and switched.
---
Nobody is obligated to help you dude lol. Support classes heal *when they agree to a group activity* not just at your fucking whim. Are you dense
---
Found it!  I eventually went to their Discord and it appears that the Twitch version was uploaded with the Retail file.  DetailsClassic.1.13.3.187.141 is the correct version to use currently.
---
Glancing blows only affect white hits.
---
Lol noobs.
---
It's gonna be hilarious when they downrank. Talk about the best way to fall behind the pack.
---
Oh that might be it. Today queue was almost 20min maybe they use the time
---
Taking about your mother like that, shame on you.
---
A comment on this: No need to macro the skull assignment, it is possible to keybind all the raid markers in the settings.
---
Or take 20% threat reduce AND wf from the same shaman.
---
for 95% of the year? yeah
---
Is Heartseeker a good server? I rolled human warrior on it yesterday and was wondering if its an active server and stuff. 
---
also if any levelling guild is recruiting, hit me up!
---
Yep, in a top guild. We all will read reddit, but never really post. Couple times some people did they just get downvoted or ignored. So we just browse and laugh at the dumb shit, while catching on to the infrequent tidbit of useful information.
---
&gt;And what you "think" isn't always how things actually are.
---
The irony of this statement, while you present your opinion as fact.
---
Yeah, people get super triggered when I cap stonehearth. Even though every time I've done so, we later go on to win the game.
---
I agree with this, but I still might end up using this. I have mutiple bar setup, one bar full come macros and the other just another shoot to kill bar. If I don't know what target to kill, press Shift+4 to back bar, acquire my target, then go from there swapping back with shift+1. 
---
Yeh though,,,, if the tank is managing threat between multiple targets this might not work well..
---
My guildmates rage over capping graveyards. The consensus seems to be horde fails at AV so let Ally win quickly so we can quickly queue up again for more rep.

for playing the game? :D
---
This is the exact reason I went horde, that and them taking mage loot and having to deal with a million people playing a meme spec.
---
Can you explain how this works? What abilities should I use it on
---
hahaha, love it. People will hate you so much :D
---
that was a great fucking read
---
It's if you're spamming shadowburn that makes it an issue. I pushed deeps in MC last night doing it and spent half a wsg afterwards trying to get 1 shard to summon a pet lmfao.
---
Other then that it's not bad at all, you can farm what you need from 0-30+ in about 20 minutes or so and you only really need that for raid nights.
---
i want the ram mount too :o its 200g cheaper than the normal one!
---
good $&amp;@&amp;!%&amp;!%#%!%
---
DW Fury Pre-BiS gear is hard to get? What? Half is from quests, other half is crafted, only very few rare drops (HoJ or SGC, for example).
---
A friend of mine is making millions fishing in azshara :)
---
i'm German, i use latin letters. Why should you care? Because appareantly you can't "call out the players" if you can not read it. 
---
Your own stupidity is limiting your ability to function in an MMORPG and probably in real life too.
---
Farming felcloth or elemental water. But might be contested. You could work towards enchanting recipies  which will be profitable when you get them such as crusaiders.
---
Horde bad.
---
earthshaker?
---
Stop capping stonehearth graveyard. You are being carried.
---
There is a decent possibility that there was a contingent of premades that made the call to kick you, but left the fishermen because they were part of the premade.
---
The issue you will run into as ele/enhance is healing the later dungeons as Mana will become more of an issue. The other problem is the ele/enhance build isn't an ele build; it's an enhance build that goes into ele, thus the gear for that build is different than if you were ele/resto.

very funny and original /s
---
I use Plexus unit frames. Very similar to Grid. It’s powerful as you can set it up to show icons for different buffs and (more importantly) debuffs. I can instantly see which raid members have Renew, Power Word:Shield, Weakened Soul, Mortal Strike, Dominate Mind, Soulstone, Fire Protection, etc. Also, which ones are missing Fortitude.
---
Much negativity here! Bit sad. Big grats on the tabard man :)
---
I will do some WSG grind on the BG weekends with premades. Much lower queue times (on horde side at least). Cool and unique looking tabards.
---
Heartstriker-GER
---
Lol, not capping stonehearth graveyard is so horde can win. Some people are just bad at av.
---
I'd say 40+, and once your gear is ready for it.
---
Not a very intelligent addition to the conversation at all lol
---
That's a lot of words for ''I'm still not going to address the main point you're making about gear''. Horde level easier, get the gear easier and therefore win easier.
---
Too many dodges in a row and it's not dodging, it's squirming and you're past that point already.
---
You are right. The russians does not work. I have a couple of russian friends on my server that chose to play on an english server to talk english, those are not the problem. 
---
People on russian servers are only interested in talking russian. Almost every game you queue, there is russians talking russian to each other.
---
It's also impossible to understand their names both on your team and opposing team.
---
People that downvote either is a salty russian, or probably from NA/lowlevel not understanding the situation, defaulting saying what you say to "racism" (russian = not a race).
---
Those people are free to/afk
---
Alliance seems to be able to queue-coubt pretty consistently. Horde seems to struggle more.
---
They farm honor between the queues
---
I was hoping someone would post this.
---
&lt;3
---
How is one supposed to NOT "be carried" in a 40man BG?
---
aRtsuB
---
Premades roll in groups under 10.  You didn't stop anything.  That player sat out a game and that's all.
---
Wait, no meme made &lt;5 mins, no n+1th thread complaining about AV (or whatever the current No.1 "issue" is), but an actually useful guide? How dare you!
---
(Nicely written, good job!)
---
I found [this old thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowaddons/comments/66av5t/play_only_addon_sounds/), don't know if the solution there works for Classic. Give it a try maybe.
---
I think it's just armor mitigation, let's take a Winterfall Ursa, if I trust classic db, he got 3435 armor which would grant 36,8% damage reduction against a lvl 60 so the numbers seem correct.
---
Plus you say that you see significant difference in damage when executing with 20 rage and 10 rage, if you have +15damage/rage then a difference of 10 rage translate to 150 damage, which fits with the number in your post.
---
It’s the legion engine, you can charge in midair, I do it all the time in rag
---
I have a lvl 28 alt, been trying to get a group for the stockades for 4 levels now without any luck
---
Druid, shaman and paladins. Druids are the least played and usually have an easy time finding raid. Can also both tank and heal 5mans. Shaman and Pala are both sought after for their buffs and stronk healing capabilities. Raids wants plenty of them.
---
I have type 2 diabetes.

no blizzards stupidity is giving me an unfair disadvantage

I'm not gonna learn to read a whole fucking language to be able to pronounce the name of my opponent, bgs should've never been crossrealm anyway (a language that is used in one single country in the entire fkn world and that I will never ever have to use outside of pronouncing names of players)
---
oder auf gut deutsch gesagt: ich lern keine verfickte sprache weil blizzard zu behindert ist mich vernünftig spielen zu lassen
---
If all you care about is gear then stop playing. It will never be worth it... you’ll get something, have a brief “yay shiny!” and then go back to waiting for the next thing.
---
If you don’t have fun playing the game with your friends and guildies then you’re really wasting your time.
---
I caused a 1.5 hour turtle game as horde we lost but I got exalted from the 2k rep I gained that game 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Brd is big, you have to do specific parts to get good xp. Best way is take 3 mages a priest, do the first big room, go right and make big bomb pulls leave the boss and reset.
---
What a stupid comment. Lol
---
"Maybe YOU believe it, but that's not my belief"
---
- horde sympathisers
---
Okay...someone please tell me how this happens lol. i have never seen this before. How on earth did he straight up charge *away* from mobs and down the death hole?
---
capping stonehearth combined with a defense capable of wiping the rush - which isnt exactly hard cause Allies will come in a large conga line - will end in a Alliance turtle. That all there is about SH GY.
---
If you cap it or not will end in a very likely Horde victory as long as you have a defence team, the difference is a 15 Minute game compared to a 40-60 Minute game.
---
I dont mind people capping SH, cause it opens up time for Ice Lord, but I do understand totally why people rage about it.
---
so you share 4 of the .. 5 piece fury warrior look for in MC? ( the 5th one being striker's mark...)
---
ok, moving on.
---
Imagine
---
If your guild falls apart just cuz main tank is gone, then you really didn't spread the loot correctly among ots. Our ots could step up as main tank easily
---
I think everyone is in for a big letdown if they ever release TBC-classic.

The nerfs that came to all pve content in tbc during its various duration is insane compared to the content we all remember from tbc launch.

---
Before I clicked on the Picture I thought it was Yoda :D But when in full size the goblin Comes through :)
---
If you factor in farming the gold needed for constant respecs between raid spec and pvp spec, then it certainly increases the time to raid. Not all classes have this issue, but some classes pvp builds are not even allowed during raids due to debuff slots.
---
So you failed each of your points except gear which I haven't addressed indeed? Well, let's fix that: you get gear in instanced areas and everyone had plenty of time to get everything you need aside from raid dungeons. Getting to raid dungeon even after 30 mins for corpserunning isn't really a problem and then you are off to your luck/dkp whatever. Prebis was grindable in P1 and there was a lot of time for a good player to do it.
---
I see how you're thinking, but I really can't see this working in most cases (the fact that you can't always rely on having bloodrage up or being able to charge notwithstanding). Best case scenario you spend 2 global cooldowns to generate 30 rage, then 1 more to get SS up, then stance switch and hope somehow you've managed to land enough melee swings to be able to ww. While hoping that during that time noone in your group as done anything else to pull aggro off you.  
---
Normally I'd suggest you're better off doing a quick thunderclap, tab target around and be ready to taunt the last mob that someone will inevitably aggro while you're busy doing that.
---
thanks everyone, now I really got something to work with &lt;3
---
The Alliance didn't get to decorate our tree now did they?
---
Manners on reserve items and hiding they're on reserve?
---
Joined a lbrs group, got through to the first boss, start moving on and then the tank decides to tell us the greater fire protection potion recipe is on reserve, I responded with "no its not" (it's 275g minimum on my server but I'm also a alchemist, I would have learned it). Proceed to watch him have a meltdown, I assume we were all going to roll on any big money drops, I assumed it was common practice that big money items = all need roll.
---
Didn't think it was that big of a deal and so when the tank lashed out, I left the group. Isn't it common good manners to announce you want reserve an item before the dungeon? I preferably don't join any group that has something on reserve.
---
That made me chuckle and then feel bad for chuckling
---
Got mine on my third kill, felt like cheating :D
---
All good.
---
On my Server there is like 30-40 People in STV alone. 24 you still blast through in your 40's you will see a lot of People :)
---
Also what time is it where you live? A lot of People still work (in my time Zone) so maybe that is also a reason
---
Yes, I play on it. I joined a guild called Redemption. They are awesome, I play a human warrior and they helped me complete my Whirlwind Axe quest early, were super cool.
---
My  name is bonehardthug if you want to join/chat :)
---
  I guess you're oppressed by being unable to cope with the fact you exist, but that's going to be fixed someday anyway.
---
No the quest specifically says murder
---
He wasn't aware of the quest or quest item. It's a long chain that has you move all over the world. He tried to tell you the mob was immune because any time he has hit it, it is. He didn't know you could weaken it and was trying to help by telling you that it can't be hit, because in its normal state it cant. He saw U die and assumed that's what happened (probably doesn't play with cast bars either). He wasn't being a dick and there was probably a language barrier.
---
It does. Looks like it’s fixed. Thanks!
---
If the horde sends a squad to defend while continuing their push, props to them.
---
If they stop their entire push to turtle, it gets old pretty fast. Zero cooldown teleport trinket was the worst decision ever, it basically means both factions spawn at the same graveyard (frostwolf relief hut vs the middle of the base) and mindlessly aoe each other for no gain.
---
Worked! Thanks!
---
Yes the essence of water (I presume you mean) is great in azshare when you have them to yourself :)
---
Wiped the Horde 3-5 Times now with Just 2 in defense mage + Warrior its super easy Just try it dont be Meta plep that Doesnt use its Trinker to Port Back to win and get sweet real Honor 100-200 Honor each kill btw
---
So true. I love learning more about the game from the stickies.
---
In my case I have a hard time keeping up with the content, and have  the impression I'm just running after the bus since the start of P2. Getting to 60 amidst death squads, go after Pre-Bis, getting profession to 300, farming mats, helping guildies, making pre-made BG, building reps... I'm anything but bored.
---
Kurinaxx is a pretty evenly split server

Hmmmm, so the 16 year old kids time is as limited and precious as a 45 year olds with two kids and full time employment?

I dont think so pal.
---
&gt; Also what time is it where you live? A lot of People still work (in my time Zone) so maybe that is also a reason
---
Yeah I've got a week off work for Christmas so will mainly be playing around the same time people are working I guess

---
Good to hear that you are having fun. I don't think it will hurt you at all, if they released phase 3 in start january, do you?
---
may is not a certain word.
---
So when and IF
---
When you cap SH you force the ally to respawn at SP, which means you have to run through them at a few chokes to win.  This drags the game out even longer. Leaving SH up allows you to bypass, mostly.
---
2k rep in 90 minutes isn’t even good though
---
I'm in the same boat, but for me the AV rewards are just guaranteed huge upgrades, so trying to put a group together is just frankly ineffecient
---
The “I shit on you now” HoJ AND sword spec proc with a BRE on a clothy. Aaaaand that is why I want a BRE haha.
---
I am alliance. There was a bananas shift. Went from 10 min wins 80% of the time, to 30 to 40 min loses 80% of the time. Fortunately, I am just 2.5 bars from exalted, but AV is fucking cancer right now.

    /cast [stance:2/3] Battle Stance;[stance:1] Charge
---
I am not playing BGs, can someone explain to me what happened here?
---
This is the thing which will hurt AV long term and you can already see it.  Many of the better players who just wanted the rep got finished by Thursday and the remaining people are either just honor farming or couldn't get the rep by then.  Rush CAN still work, but you need people paying attention and healers.  As the week went on, the players who understood what they needed to do to properly pull and deal with warmasters went down.  Even in the games where there is minimal horde defense still stalls at warmasters because they pull to many or the tank sucks or there is one healer.
---
Those people aren't coming back an it shows for Alliance.  THe rush still works win with some of the people getting premades and organized enough to properly pull/heal in drek's room.  The problem are the pugs have absolutely not concept of how to do this well, and yet they don't change strategies.  You end up with people getting themselves in failed rushes and then the afking starts.  Sometimes the horde can win in 20ish minutes, other times it starts to turtle and the game is like 45mins.  Alliance cap no towers, don't get galvanager and end up with minimal bonus honor/rep.  
---
what this means for AV though is less and less Alliance doing it.  As more finish their rep grind, and Horde have presumably already noticed queue time increases, less Alliance will play.  Once all of the people who actually try are gone and Alliance are still trying to do their pug rush, there will be almost no honor or rep for Alliance.  More people will stop playing AV since the entire experience will get shittier and shittier for Alliance.
---
For those Alliance who hate the galv rush, the entire point isn't to make it more likely to win, it's to get the bonus rep/honor so the game isn't entirely pointless when you all die to the like 12 horde defending.
---
It’s not only good manners, it is straight up reportable if loot rules are not followed.
---
Crown of Destruction from Rag is better in some ways if you are hit capped otherwise.
---
Right so then saying it works one in a hundred times isn't true....each individual roll he has a 1 in 100 chance of guessing the right number but he could roll the dice 100 times and never roll an 82?

Can't wait to see the guild breaking that happens when BWL pops.

rep does get worse over time tho. You cant turn in flesh and armor forever. Not an issue in a game that goes on for like 40-50 Minutes, but after a certain point the rep/h would keep getting worse.

This is why I don't donate to the guild bank.  On the flipside, I never ask for anything from the guild bank, either.
---
I've just never really understood the whole idea of donating to the guild bank.  It tends to only benefit moochers.  The only exception to this, IMO, is when you're focusing on gearing up the MT.  But that's not really as vital as it was back in the day.
---
Level up Herbalism and get some decent pre-raid gear with high int/stam (e.G. Necro-set from Scholo) and go for lasher farms in DM East. You need around 6k mana to bomb the packs. Power infusion makes it easier to kill multiple packs at once. If you want, soloing the first 2 bosses is also pretty easy with disc/holy talents, just takes longer.
---
Yeah it works for 5 man, sure. I'd just like to get comfortable with a good addon so I don't get pushed into the cold water when reaching 60 and learn it in lower dungeons with a little less responsibility.
---
Yeah just ask for a “summon” and a mage will surely pop one up!
---
Not gonna disagree with you, but definitely will question the viability. Gonna agree - def meme spec, aka no raid spot, no real pre-made spot, just a couple of nights of fun. I guess that's what I meant by saying it doesn't exist. Also, had the feeling that OP meant ele with enh side, which makes absolutely zero sense, didn't even think of it the other way around.

Also, damn dude you make it sound so exquisitely masochistic :D kudos for making it work like that..

Could always find players to MC off a cliff edge :)

Point is, everything doesn't have to be about progression, just find ways to have fun :)

Yup. Better bring 2+ CC for every pull or you're going to have a bad time.
---
You definitely don't want /startattack to be on your stealth-openers.  You can end up starting autoattack and whacking the enemy (thereby losing your own stealth) before the ability itself goes off.
---
The humans you kill in the starting area are members of the scarlet crusade who are hunting and killing any undead they find. They're defending themselves.

---
huh? I'm just saying the devs for RS classic actually listen to the player base on twitter and reddit. They take their advice and run with it, that's why it's so popular. They could learn a lot from that, just listening to their playerbase.
---
Cloud?
---
Piling on with everyone else, they switched to 2 elixirs, or a flask which counted as a guardian and battle elixir. There was still drums though. BC did start with Vanilla style consumes, but it was quickly becoming a problem, especially since BC raids were pretty hard and could kill a skilled group repeatedly, so they made a change.
---
There was a post at the top earlier complaining that it's annoying when people ask, and to just open trade instead.

\#showtooltip \[Ability Name\]
---
/startattack
---
/cast Battle Stance
---
/cast Charge
---
This one makes it so you'll always start auto-attacking, switch to Battle Stance and cast charge with only pressing one key. It can even be used while in Defensive Stance to switch to Battle Stance and charge.
---
Then you have to juggle between this one and all the others - key ones being Thunderclap, Intercept, all your defensive cooldowns, etc.

If all of these wannabe unbreakable enhance shamans could just go resto we would have an equal amount of healers. Alliance don't just win by map imbalance but because they have a ton of holy paladins. We've had a bunch of AV's where horde succesfully defends but the 20+ attackers still wipe 5 times on the marshals because we just lack healers lol
---
We did it Reddit! Haha upvoted :)
---
OP and other posts/comments
---
Wow is not really a sandbox. Is more than retail but still not a full sandbox game. Unless you RP which is just full on cringe.
---
BWL first half of feb.
---
Paid transfers first half of march.
---
Let's say BWL drops beginning of February, thats about 6-7 more MC clears.  Mageblade has a 25% drop so you might only get 1-2 more MBs (and 1-2 SoDs).
---
If you are farther than that down the list of MB/SoD then you'll probably want to just keep the dagger for BWL progression and enchant it.
---
Imagine being ret and thinking you're getting a raid spot.
---
As others have said, people are in BGs. Just give it a week for everyone to get exalted rep on their main. Everyone just wants to get that grind over as soon as possible while the queue times for Alterac Valley are still short. Once it's over you'll see more people taking the time to level alts.
---
But on retail you can do the previous raids and gear up progressively just the same. Nothing is stopping you.
---
I dont see any use of it
---
It doesn't but if you have the "Attack" skill somewhere else then that skill will flash because you're basically activated it with the "/startattack" command.
---
That's fair enough I feel if time is limited though most if not all specs can be viable in pvp (especially AV); and can gold farm. Priests certainly don't need to respec between raids although of course they can if they want to.
---
Paladin.
---
Druid is least played but also low demand, while paladins is always going to be highly demanded.
---
Um, ok. Didn't know, that warriors don't need any weapons, which already puts their needed items to 7.
---
And great of you to ignore bwl, where I said I need 0-2 items, while warriors need 7-8. MC has the highest overlap, as there aren't many options.
---
I would worry more about getting prebis than leveling at this point leveling is just a bonus to farming your prebis because if you want to not be worthless in raids you need to be atleast hit capped
---
Item level.  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dejaclassicstats](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dejaclassicstats)
---
I miss the good old days where the are 3 people from the start that rush to RH, a couple rush to the towers, and the main force kills galvs and all the captains on the way down while we wait for the RH to cap.
---
I guess he meant cloudkeeper legplates.
---
If your guild is min maxing...mages aren't even close to topping the meters on any fight except for Domo in MC.
---
When you replay Skyrim, do you skip straight to killing Alduin, or do you go through the other quests first?
---
I never said it was good I said I got exalted lol
---
Yes priest is the most popular healer I would say. Druid is the least popular.
---
Any big guild will be doing most if not all raids. That doesn’t mean it’s all one team though.
---
&gt;it isn’t always going to be this easy 
---
I remember people saying that about molten core before it was cleared with almost half of the raid under level 60. 
---
Where are the goalposts being moved to? BWL? Is that when things won’t be so easy that a rag-tag band of players wearing gear from MC can’t cut through it like butter? Are they being moved to AQ or Naxx, where how you gear in MC now is largely irrelevant? 
---
If your guild struggles doing a 5-hour clear, it isn’t because of the class comp, it’s a player issue. A 90-minute clear is simply people playing smart and you guys not wiping to stupid mistakes. Your group doing a few % more damage because you funnelled gear to specific players isn’t going to make or break your 90-minute timer. 
---
I think it’s funny that you talk about players wanting to be in a guild where they get funnelled loot for working hard. It’s literally impossible for that to be the case with 40 people unless you have a rotating group of bitches that are there to make sure you get the mageblade.
---
That's not a source, that's something OP pulled out of his ass.
---
Why don't you go play a game that actually requires some skill instead of applying your braindead elitist logic to this one, players even in non hardcore guilds are already pushing way past 400 dps and there's a ton of gear upgrades to be acquired from bwl, zg, aq and other sources.
---
The gear in previous raids is worse than gear from catch-up dailies they add in for every tier...
---
u dont have to be mad at other players for how they play. focus on having fun yourself. let others play how they want. if u want to RP thats cool and all but some of us just want to raid with friends once per week and have fun with that.
---
Gotta love that "lmaoo" at the end
---
Listening to your playerbase is good and all, as long as you take your playerbase with a pinch of salt. People don’t know what they want and blindly giving people whatever they wanted in regards to for example catch-up mechanics and quality of life improvements gave us LFR and previous raid tiers in the same expansion being outdated whenever the next patch comes.
---
It is a slippery slope and why #nochanges is a thing at all.
---
I don't donate to our guild bank. Our GM seems to lose all his gold on gambling every raid. Yet he's "saving" for Thunderfury mats.
---
And our guild has to silent bid for Onyxia Bags. If I want a bag from her I have to Pug the raid or pay for it.
---
Guilds should have no problem making money w/o donations. Don't give gold to your guild bank, unless they are giving out mats/consumables for free.
---
Off with yah, be good
---
Thanks I couldn't get it to work on my phone.
---
That's hilarious.
---
As far as I know, the built-in party frames does not allow this. 
---
However, the built-in RAID frames do. What you wanna do is to enable raid frames in party (Interface menu) and make sure to enable Show Pets.
---
Yeah, I love the attunements. You don’t even have to finish the whole chain to get somewhere meaningful. Even just 20-30% into the attunements chain is Kara, and soon SSC. It gives you some shit to do in a way that isn’t dailies.
---
So, like others, I use stance-dancing macros a lot. I also have a "system" with them. For example I have bound my charge-macro to "T", and it is accessible from all stances:
---
    /cast [stance:2/3] Battle Stance; [stance:1] Charge
---
Then I have bound intercept macro to "shift-T" since it is a kind of charge, and its easy to remember that T and shift-T are the charges and these macros can be used to stance-dance if needed since you cannot charge while in combat or intercept a mob at melee range so pressing these keys while fighting something will only swap the stance. I have all key abilities bound like this so they are accessible all the time. It does lead to quite a lot of bound keys but it's manageable. I currently have 3-6, R, T, F, V, C, X bound plainly and with shift. I like to keep the bound keys relatively close to WASD and in such a position that I can almost freely move while using any of the keys, and the abilities that I might need to spam are at C or V so I can just spam them with thumb while using other fingers to move with WASD.
---
The thing is...you won't. MC is easy, it was always easy. The raids get progressively harder. A lot of these casual guilds will die in BWL, then in AQ, and if one or 2 survives that they'll die in Naxx.
---
MC is like grade school math, it's just reaching you critical thinking and good habits so that you don't fail at life later on.
---
Yeah I like the tug of war the game I was talking about we were on the verge of winning about to pull van then ally full party recalled and wiped us with atleast 20 or more players took the Gys and forced us to fwgy. We couldn’t recover because then it turned into us just trapped south when we finally went North the alliance won the base race
---
This sub is a cancerous cesspool of idiots.
---
Yeah I can’t wait for tough Heroics. I want to see 5-mans crumble apart at the second boss.
---
I seriously read that as "nice addiction" the first time around lol
---
But cloudkeeper doesn’t have weapon skill.
---
Wait.
---
**YOU CAN USE THEM ON THE FRIENDLY NPCS?!**  
---
Does it work on Van? :O
---
What’s not worth it? Leaving an efficient guild, or dealing with a guild who pockets everything?
---
Yeah.  When I very first started playing, this quest was going on and I had a similar experience.  Feels good.
---
BWL and AQ is also easy. In fact, everything is easy by todays standards. And yes, I have raided both on private servers and top end mythic raiding on retail for years. I know how it works
---
Definitely BGs and the Christmas event just started yesterday.
---
I M M E R S I O N
---
I keep it as a way to verify that I'm attacking and not just admiring the backside of some dragon.
---
So? Isn't the prestige of gearing up progressively through the raids what you're after?
---
I assume you said "Haha, glad I could help." when they thanked you for it.
---
Omg I’ve never seen this in all my years. Thank you.
---
You're out of your mind with anger, dude. I don't raid because I don't enjoy raiding. I play this game to enjoy it. What am I doing, you asked in an above comment? I'm living my life, pvping when I'm online, and not investing time into something I don't enjoy. 
---
Sorry that this somehow offends your sensibilities. I hope you get the help you need, dawg.
---
1g for a full inventory of food+water vs 50s for 5 biscuits. It's not worth ever buying food from a vendor unless you're in a pinch and can't find a mage(never happens with these big realm pops)
---
Sociopath much?
---
This is why you aoe capture points
---
Hahaha so cool!
---
Thats my guild!
---
Correct, this is Mankrik PVE server. The player is from my guild.
---
Dwarf priests are god tier
---
How do you figure m8
---
Is fury good for raiding or other PvE of you don't have raid gear? Do most warriors dual wield fury dps or can you 2h?
---
They said something about "washing my back" ;)
---
Not my experience at all buddy.
---
I absolutely saw the same thing. I ran 30+ games Saturday and 20+ Sunday. Saturday win rate was 85%+ Sunday was 20%. My theory is a lot more casual people were playing Sunday, Que was also longer which could mean more horde players. Also snowballs have made the bridge much harder to deal with. I really dont understand the its better to lose fast, if you want to grind rep, (which most players should) then its way better to win. I am just glad i am 3k from exalted.
---
TIME IS MONEY, Friend
---
You can only go to those instanced areas after levelling through the world, which horde can do a lot easier. Maybe for some people who play all the time they had time to get all the best gear at this point, but not everybody has that time and that has nothing to do with skill.
---
The very fact that you think all players have the top tier gear at the moment (like yeah any good player has full gear only months after release /s) means you're obviously just a fanboy of horde who likes to think he's amazing and looking for reasons to justify that opinion.
---
''I'm simply better than the alliance players'' - said the side with 3 clear advantages vs the alliances 1.
---
IKR, we have people constantly complaining about goblins holding 95% of ranking positions within the media and banking industries despite being only 2% of the population. Shit gets really old.
---
That's pretty cool haha, clearing it in true dramatic fashion.
---
He used it on van
---
APES are pugs? big yikes there
---
You need all of your CDs. You need to counterspell fear, block coil and fear. You have to rush him down with instant casts. You can definitely win the fight if you have all of your CDs

The first video is a great feral pvper who is specd HOTW. The second is a great balance pvper who is specd 30/0/21. I’ve learned a lot from watching them. Hope this helps!
---
Honestly our guild bank takes anything thats not needed in raid (matts, extra purples, etc), and uses that to fund our thunderfurys. We are currently at around 110 arcanite bars.... and only one binding @.@
---
can you pm me the import stirng.
---
At least he told you when you started going.  It's okay for the group leader to reserve items, but he should have put it out before he invited you.
---
What do you guys gold farm? I'm a feral druid and looking for ways to get my epic mount. Also have a rogue friend .
---
You do know the Scarlett crusade was formed because armies of undead roamed the kingdom of loredron massacring thousands? The Scarlett crusade are bad, but it's not like the undead are innocent either.
---
Why God why are you making them use questie
---
Short turtle (45min) that was getting towards the end, both groups were on their last warmasters. I got an orc hunter to chase me to the nelf druids, he ran away after his pet pulled. He didn't feign death so the druids entered the fight combined with our ragtag alliance defense and two marshalls we wiped the horde while our offense killed drek.
---
Well it was both and in the end I would rather wipe with egalitarians
---
Yes and no. Doing it on retail just wastes time, which most folks have limited amounts of. Doing it in classic is the only way to do it and therefore feels worth doing with that same limited time.
---
Again, different games for different audiences.
---
Started 2 days ago after 2 months break, and there is plenty of people still leveling/leveling alts.
---
It's up to you guys to use this addon or not :)
---
 /w magename yo could I get some water please, I'm going to open a trade window because I want to save time and not because I'm assuming you will do it. Will send nudes if necessary.
---
Hasn't failed me yet.

MAYOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!! Str8 Dikn
---
You can't milk those!
---
If Horde are fascists then what are the Alliance with their racism and concentration camps?
---
You know, there's a simple rule of thumb for exactly this kind of dilemma. If you don't enjoy it, *don't do it.*
---
Can mages still blink inside the flag and "stealth" cap?  I remember this being a thing back in vanilla.
---
Yes and what you do in your free time is surely worth more than that..
---
One of them was a Human member of the Scarlet Crusade, the other was an Arathi Dwarf.
---
I think there's at least one that involves going into something like Gurubashi arena where allies turn hostile and you kill anyone
---
Do you want Goldshire? Because this is how you get Goldshire... LOL
---
Windfury totem, check.
---
Healer spam healing you, check.
---
Free action potion, check.
---
Recklessness, check.
---
One of the best 2 handed weapons in the game, check.
---
10/10 this is what you level a warrior for
---
You’re real dumb, huh?
---
Nope you have to quit if you don't play the AH all week sorry those are the laws
---
Imagine coming back after a week to yell at someone after they long since left the topic.
---
&gt; I hope you get the help you need, dawg. 
---
Follow your own advice.
---
I've farmed my epic mount quite fast by just doing dungeons with guildies, just find a healer friend and invite some random dips and you'll get the gold needed ez while farming your bis gear. Strat Living in particular is good money, especially these days with everyone pvping instead of orb farming.
---
&gt;just because you have experienced something doesn't mean it applies to everyone
---
And just because you disagree does not mean my experience is """"""plain wrong"""""" as you keep insinuating.
---
W I experience the same thing time and time again for four years straight, you can't just say "HURR THAT'S JUST UR EXPERIENCE!!!!!", no, it's how PvP servers work.
---
And these were pvp servers that already had battlegrounds out too.
---
Just ask your guild if they are OK with it
---
&gt; If a guild is using loot council in classic, please be highly suspicious of what that guilds goals are and who they are prioritising with the gear.
---
9/10 guilds are using loot council. It's not some scheme.
---
Oh I agree but I mean what is there to do as a healer outside of structured pvp/pve content? Mind control people in a pve server? I can’t exactly farm reputation for timber maw because I’m stuck holy. Classic really need dual spec, they already changed the game by allowing more than the max in server population, might as well do dual spec too.
---
Cheers for posting, I have a feeling it might be located elsewhere in my version - but really can't recall. Good that you got it fixed :)
---
I feel like that defeats the purpose a little but I’ll certainly be redoing all my buttons later.
---
Just gamble
---
Ok so this is another thing I want to point out.
---
People love blowing the old AV and say "it was great" or some other bullshit.  Even here the guy says 'put a lot of effort into your victory."  Here is the problem, the games often went 10+ hours or even spanned days.  Very few people were there for all or even most of it.  The time you put in was minimal and the impact of individuals was negligible.  It also had the problem of people were virtually avoiding AV entirely by the time it was changed.  Smaller servers often wouldn't even have an AV game open because they couldn't get enough people to even play the fucking thing.  If I have to hear someone else say how great OG AV was, I want them to explain why this great and wonderful AV was so fucking underplayed at the time people mythologize that it was wonderful?  Virtually no one fucking liked Original AV.  Did people like the new AV? Mostly still no, but it was playable at least.
---
The second thing is people comparing shit which isn't the same.  "It was great during Vanilla", no it wasn't.  It may have worked better on Private servers where more people were optimizing it and going in prepare for it, but it was complete dirty ass during Vanilla.  Also you aren't going to get the Private server version because you aren't getting entire servers of Private Server players who go in knowing what they should do.  You are getting pugs, so it will be much closer to the hot ass Vanilla times where people just did shit.
---
You don't like how much fun pvp is right now?  Well it was never fun.  This is the same system but people are doing it with a different mentality.  You don't like people going all in for gear?  That is exactly what people have always done.  The only change from now and 15 years ago is people having a better plan of how to do it.  Go back to retail if you want gear?  I love this awful logic.  Go back to retail if you want gear, because i don't like that I can play the game exactly how I want and not make the progress towards the gear I want.  Sounds more like you want to go back to retail and get your gear playing the game your way instead of having to actually compete for it.  Welcome the vanilla honor system!  You don't play the game for the most fun, you play it for the most honor.  That is the way it was and if you don't like it why don't you go back to retail.
---
I hate this entire mentality of people who have this idea of how classic should play because of how it was in vanilla.  The systems are more or less the same as vanilla.  The updated gear stats and talents make thing interesting, but the honor system in the same.  Do you think people weren't poopsocking AV when it released to get The Unstoppable force 14 years ago?  This is even the nerfed Unstoppable force without the knockback.
---
I hate this mindset of people bitching that they are mad they can't play classic in the way that is the most "fun" for them and still make honor progress.  It was never this way.  Once AB came out, WSG was massively left behind for Honor because AB was more efficient.  People still did WSG from time to time, but the top ranking people were crammed into AB regardless.
---
Nothing is stopping you people from playing the game in the way that is most fun for you.  If you want to play WSG, go nuts and do it.  No one is forcing you to play AV.  You are doing it to yourself because you want the items, which is exactly the reason you are bitching about other people. The difference is they admit it.  They admit they are willing to do something they don't want to do to get their items.
---
If the guild is letting Paladins and Druids DPS then they don't care about any of that minmax nonsense. There is no Nightfall yet.
---
Most people are 50+ right now. And the big majority of people don't like leveling alts so I would say probably 80%+ of active players are 50+.
---
This hurts to read
---
Sorry I’ll talk in your native language so you can understand. Me zug zug oof smash.
---
What would theoretically be the fastest way to farm skins of shadow?   Obviously there's 1 guaranteed from scholomance, but the bone constructs in the pally mount quest room all drop skins as well, and some of the bosses drop them as well.  I wonder if there's a good way to farm them.  I'm trying to make a couple shifting cloaks, and could use some ideas beyond doing a full run of scholomance 12 times (and reserving the 1 skin of shadow).
---
Another thing not mentioned much here is that you can also have macros that do similar spells but in different stances bound to one key, thus saving you space on your bars. I have them for Charge/Intercept, and Shield Bash/Pummel, as these can't be cast in the same stance. 
---
Something like this (off the top of my head!)
---
     #showtooltip 
---
     /cast [stance:1/2] shield bash; [stance:3] pummel
---
Tried to do this a month or so back and it was glitches out then also.
---
I mean it reduses honor for alliance since they have instant queue times but for horde hunting alliance and turning in scraps is a lot better.
---
Yeeeesh
---
You can only do the Greench quest once per character every year so you need to do it on a alt or buy it off the AH.
---
It is fine you either ones hot her or you take hours. We all fuck up you feeling bad about it makes sense but it's not a big deal
---
Dark master Handling in Scholo dropped the green for me last night.
---
Sounds like you made a simple mistake. Since there’s no mention of “group fell apart and we didn’t down her” I’m guessing y’all still got the kill. Live and learn, no pun intended. Try to figure out what got you killed and learn how to avoid it next time. We were all there at one point.
---
A kodo is not the best mount lol. The shoulders and legs shake in the most obnoxious way lol. I’m a Tauren with an epic kodo and still going to the frostwolf.
---
You are fine, a lot of people die to Ony, healer or otherwise.  Just learn from your mistakes and do better next time.
---
you are gonna be doing MC every week till AQ 40 is out regardless or who has onslaught
---
It's full of irl losers that feed their self esteem by crushing one of the easiest mmos available to play right now. I can respect the guilds actually speedrunning taking 20something minutes for MC but if you're acting all elitist while taking 90 minutes for MC you're nothing but a joke. Like, go play a game that actually requires some skill and prove it before you act smug on Reddit.
---
But are those people not doing heroic dungeons the kind of people who are worrying about getting attuned for SSC, TK, Hyjal, and BT?
---
Nope, you are the first person to mess up on a raid.  
---
Congrats on world first
---
Same as the last ten "EPIC RAGNAROS KILL!"s that have been posted here.
---
You would think after 14 weeks if the rooster isn't complete, there's a lack of effort on the leadership to fill it out. Also, you don't need a perfect 40 man for MC, we've recently split our core group and brought a couple more new people, right now G1 has 29 people and G2 has 36. Both have downed rag.
---
You didn't have to be Revered to get the Heroic keys anymore. Just Honored.
---
It's fine, especially on your first time. It only becomes a bigger deal during progression, especially in a high visibility situation like pulling aggro on Vael. Try to figure out why you died, check your combat log, etc. If I had to guess a caster had threat after phase 2 and didn't run to the tank spot in time so you ate a flame breath.
---
LOL I'm telling him, and thank you :)
---
Of course dude
---
Anyway, if it was phase 3, you might have been too far forward and got hit by her fire breath, or at the beginning of the phase while the tank was trying to regain agro, you or a nearby dps might have pulled her and then she flame breathed.
---
I'm just hear to collect the tears of rage.
---
..need them for a quest. :P
---
The ultimate disappointment is when you summon your raidboss only to find him standing around in the middle, not moving at all. But hey its only a small indie company...
---
14 raids isn’t 14 weeks (MC + Ony) and this is my second guild.
---
&gt;Is that worth 10 months of my life?
---
If its not worth it to you, don't do it. Simple as that
---
Dying in Onyxia isnt that uncommon, so dont overthinkg it. ;)
---
It was only like that until the first patch. Then they went to the consumable system that was carried forward. E.g. one flask OR one guardian + battle elixir.
---
When you try to afkreport a player, you get blizzard UI warning "addon blocked action" and the suggestion to disable an addon and reload UI. Unlike entering BG (same problem) you cannot circumvent it. I, for instance, have simply given up reporting afkers.
---
(But yes, AFK reports were misused by alliance premades massreporting players outside from premade so their friends could get in instead, so Blizzard "fixed" it somehow and it resulted in the issue I describe).
---
Agreed. This is a very chance thing. 
---
And TC is what I normally due to it being very consistent to pull off.
---
Lol :D
---
Don't worry Onyxia is where a lot of People fuck up if it isn't explained properly :D
---
Especially the Transition into P3 is difficult because you have a full threat reset and when you still have HOTS running you just get agroo right away. 
---
DD's stop doing damage and Tanks try to get agroo ASAP.
---
When you have agroo you are supposed to run to the spot where the tank will tank the Boss. And die pretty much. 
---
If you get lucky the tank gets agroo before you die - or someone else gets agroo but usually someone dies there.
---
Also when the Boss looses agroo and you raid eats one of his breaths - half your raid can die within a second
---
Bruh saying russians being toxic as fuck in video games isnt russiaphobia, its fucking reality. Youre worse than brazilians, which takes serious efffoet to achieve.
---
No I'm sorry mate, you're delusional.
---
Have fun playing wow and being better than all the alliance players, you deserve it!
---
you had 7+ rets?
---
That wasn’t my question. İ clearly stated in my question that i am wondering about healing effiency with HotW specs. My guild is chill, i am sure they will be “OK” with it when i asked them.
---
If you have herbalism you can always look into farming black lotus
---
more commonly:
---
you'd get in trouble if they *notice* you aren't using any consumes, but in a casual guild 99% of the time nobody will even notice lol
---
Yes, most of the time Druids use a lower rank healing touch for raid healing. HotW would give you a larger mana pool for that while still being able to throw on tank gear for a boss like Garr if you are short on warlocks and off tanks. IMO, druids are a support class. They bring some of the best buffs/battle res/versatility to a raid.
---
To be clear, you need to mouse over their party frames. I did not know this all those years ago when WoW launched and only learned it recently.
---
Onyxia is a very hectic fight if you haven't seen it before. Admirable to survive to p3, honestly. Figure out what you did wrong and don't let it happen again. Stand to her side, don't stand in the cracks, and top yourself off before fears.
---
The situation he's detailing is not reportable, it IS bad manners though.  Even if this guy changed the loot rules before the potion recipe dropped and looted it to himself, that's not a violation of ToS.  It's a crappy thing to do, but when you get invited into somebody elses group you're agreeing to allow them control over things like that.
---
How is it that you think like 6 raids per week is not "more involved" than 1 raid per week? lol
---
yes
---
Well then. Yes it is 100% fine you won't be top healing but you will certainly not cause your raid to suffer.
---
Do you know why you died?  Was it positioning on your part or just unfortunate fate due to who had aggro(Phase 3 transition is the most "delicate" and only difficult part of ony)?
---
We do split ony and clear MC in about an hour and we still have people that die any time ony deep breaths...
---
Very Interdasting
---
"Can anyone make me some water, please? 55"
---
"No."
---
I don't know why I find this so hilarious, but I do
---
I hate hate hate when an idiotic DPS pulls aggro and managed to turn her on the raid/me. How hard is it to wait?
---
Pure racism by Blizzard, put Russians on one side and the western players on the opposition to fight each other. This is even more hilarious if its true that Russians can make character names only using Cyrillic letters...
---
Youre seriously one of the best trolls on reddit, you should branch out into more subs. I mean this as a compliment.
---
People are going to tell you different reasons, but there's one true reason why most people don't want it to come out early.
---
Once Naxx is out for a bit, the game will mostly die. They want the life cycle to last a long time. The quicker BWL comes out the shorter the life span of the game will be
---
Defending towers with these is OP :)
---
Heartseeker, if I'm not mistaken, is one of the few PvP realms that is Alliance dominated.  The server is seriously imbalanced, and may be in some type of danger in the future of the imbalance getting worse which is not  a great thing for a PvP server.
---
Totally worth that AV queue
---
I've never been wsg exalted on any character, including my main in retail with about 2 years /played on. Good job.
---
early on yes the SSC/TK attune issue existed
---
later on it was just clearing TK again for people you needed for BT. which was annoying enough because the KT fight was annoying long and boring
---
If you need a good spot to grind out some XP, check the blood elf camp in north azshara. They are caster mobs and have very low armor, they also drop runecloth, food and major healing pots. I got around 40k xp/h there, did a few levels worth of grinding between 53-59.
---
I start every AV with “I’m giving out all the buffs I can, hope you do the same” then I give a stack of water to each priest unprompted and end up inting every mana user in the raid by myself and leave the tunnel with no fort Everytime.
---
PROFANITY FILTER LOL
---
Thank you for answer. İ guess i will respec into HotW again because right now, i am not having fun at healing like this and cant tank with this talents too. İt is best for me to go back into HotW.
---
This is a long shot but a lot of the new AV gear has frost resist on it.
---
Also berserking
---
I’m not sure, I’m guessing it was positioning. Honestly it happened so fast that I don’t really know what I did and wish I was recording it or something to look back on. I wasn’t really 100% clear on the whole positioning thing though so I think it was likely just my screw up. 
---
Just felt bad about it since it was my first time clearing Ony with my new raid group (and also thankfully several people’s first time clearing Ony).
---
Might be oglow
---
Lmfao.. I have done about 20 wsg's and I think only one wasn't a premade. I would say it's kind of deserved, and that both could be viewed as abusing game mechanics.
---
Lol no, fuck up and don’t get reinvited, mastrace people don’t fuck up
---
Because consistency.
---
Crusader, ON PAPER, is better than striking if you have 100% uptime and the best luck with having the buff be 100% uptime.
---
Absolutely useless, sorry.. Tanks are tabbing to build aggro on targets you are not supposed to dps, but you do by using this. And in raid, you should know what to target anyway.    
---
Btw how about solo content? Do you have every spell twice on bars?
---
Nice I'll check that out. A guildie told me to go to jaedfire run in felwood but there's a lot of ppl there grinding for fel cloth.
---
It was 4 paladins that where in tank\ret spec. It's better for downtime between raids, and they didn't respec back for raiding.
---
OFF WIF YA
---
Yes, HoJ and SGC are rare and so are Truestrike shoulders. It's not only about the drop rate, tho.
---
There is too much competition (Dal Rends swords, Baron's cloak etc) for said pre bis gear.
---
It is  fairly common and I often defend because of it. They try to aggro and have someone else cap. A single person can ruin their day, due to the help you get from NPCs and archers.
---
LONESOME GOD SO PROUD
---
some skull (to level 24) Tauren hunter was goofing around Lakeshire this morning, I assume he was trying to snipe Corporal Keeshan for maximum douchebaggery. When I got there with my warrior , he had two high level guards on him and was at 10% health. He ran away, I got a charge off but of course he resists it (and I only have 9 rage from charging anyways) \*but\* he turns on Aspect of the Daze, so I do him the favor and daze him with my level 9 bow. And the guards catch up :)
---
Tyrs Hand is always good. Can get crusader enchantment drops there too
---
Yes we are the bad asses, why else join the horde?
---
We had a dude yawn during bomb in Barren Geddan and kill 6 people....
---
When asked, “Dude I yawned and it was over!”
---
He now has YawnnySmurf as his Guild Note.
---
I'm right handed, I use the arrows, numpad, and the insert/home/pg up/down keys. Just what I stared using 20 years ago playing EQ, and never able to break the habit.
---
Almost nobody will pug naxx and aq thats for sure.
---
Can I two-man kill Angerforge easily for HoJ? I just want to run-rinse-repeat quickly.
---
This needs music.
---
Even after soloing DM tribute. I don’t know what items are worth selling (besides the ring) or what to vendor to an NPC
---
You with another rogue and a really good healer. Or even three rogues. Sap the pets and blow up one of them. Blind the rest.
---
Seriously, the research Fight Club is doing, is borderline obsessive. Loving it.
---
I love when people brag about stuff like this, but you just exposed the fact that you're unemployed and play wow 16 hours a day.
---
Grats I guess.
---
Don't even participate
---
It's more that new raids dont trivialize old raids in vanilla, it's still worth doing them
---
Truestrike aren't required.
---
Lots of people say to use mouse over macros. What's the benefit of this?
---
 Usually 90% of my heals go to the tank: wouldn't mouseover macros require me to click their frame every time, slowling me down?
---
Well rip, I stopped playing shortly before TBC and mostly remember this from my guild's forums until I stopped following it, and when I came back in WotLK it was already the new system. Good to know it changed early.
---
What am i missing?  The one she's happy about seems to be full of turtles....?  Just basing this inference on the scattered numbers that one would think being more sequential means that they are ending, and are not turtles...
---
Reminds me of Crash Bandicoot
---
&lt;Horde&gt; Windseeker - US   is a Casual raiding guild (9/10)(1/1). We raid on Friday &amp; Saturday evenings 9:00-12:00 EST(server time). Open Slots for Mages and Warlocks, other classes may still apply.

---
So before Phase 2 dropped, there was a survey that the subreddit did, but I never saw the results posted.  Does anyone have the results?
---
Don't wait for mageblade. You already have epic weapon and you're in a lc guild. You probably won't get mageblade before everyone else has at least sorc dagger as well. That blade drops once every 4 weeks on average. Odds are you won't get it before bwl.
---
What's wrong with questie?
---
what exactly is happening here
---
Cow poop
---
3 Pompyro Mages - all 3 of you Pompyro 1 WL in his god damn ugly face.
---
Then loose.
---
But you got the JK's out of it :)
---
Also when he rezzes - kill him again just for the jokes though.
---
And then again because he is a filthy Warlock - no joke
---
This is true.  I didnt even think of this.
---
Just What i Did thank you very much
---
How would that work? The auction house is one way, and addons can only modify your own UI, they can't magically add more functionality to the game. Trade chat or server discord are your best options.
---
As someone currently described by the first paragraph, the rest of this and my own vanilla experience of raiding through naxx makes me just want to quit now haha.
---
Steals my hope that I'll ever have the time again to juggle 3x 40-man raids, ZG, and Ony with a 50hr/wk job and a kid.
---
Sap is on humanoids only.
---
All Flamelash ally guilds moved to Hearthseeker pretty much if I'm not mistaken, fucking up the once pretty balanced server completely.
---
I myself would not roll an Ally there right now because you only help to make the problem worse and potentially kill the server.
---
There's plenty other active EU servers that while Horde dominated aren't that bad yet and could actually use more Ally players insteaf of Heartseeker.
---
I've 2 manned Anger with Rogues.  Rogue can even solo Anger.  Three man is safest with a Rogue, but 2 manning is easy enough.  Especially if one of the Rogues has Riposte.
---
Whew lad no need to come at me like that. 
---
Just curious if other people noticed such a dramatic shift in winrate as well.
---
I was never a fan of PvP, mainly because I suck balls.
---
Pretty sure its ahhhggg-ro - for the for sound you make when the boss turns to you and deletes you from the game.
---
Form your own group with the rule that you'll pass on all items/runes but that you want all shadow skins. Clear Rattlegore's room.
---
Found the racist
---
There's another way to get in that is not nearly as shady looking.  You just have to make 1 well placed jump from the right spot (which you can run to).  As a hunter you can do it, a lot of NPC's that are impossible to kill solo will pull but you can FD them off.  It's almost as easy as running straight through the entire horde base unmolested, straight to the frostwolf aid station only taking 1 or 2 shots from archers.   You absolutely cannot run through the middle of the stormpike base in the same way.  Archers in the towers get LOS on you starting at the bridge and ending just before the flag.  If you're by yourself doing this, you'll get picked apart and killed before you even get to the flag - let alone agro some of the NPC's with massive health pools.
---
Homie, right now on Classic it's hard to find people to do the Onyxia attunement dragons and that's current content. 
---
Catchup gear is an option but, if you wanted to, you're free to raid progressively if you want. Yes, I know certain people are loathe to have a choice and they get upset when people don't do things "their way" but you're still free to do it. It's not missing at all. 
---
The truth is, as you admit, that you don't actually want to raid progressively. You just prefer not having a choice, which is kind of interesting. Funny, too.
---
Sure, it also increases out-of-combat health regen by 11 hp/s though which is nice.
---
Dont the AV ones last like 5 min? Pretty impressive timing for that move you suggested
---
Actual imbecile
---
If the ready to enter instance is at the bottom of the list, it's a fresh bg.  If it is near the top, it is probably a turtle.
---
Rogue+druid runs were quite popular at some point. Warrior+healer works too, but you'd need to find someone willing to help you for little gain.
---
Some classes can solo it using the ledge kiting method. I've seen videos for mages and rogues, did it once as a priest, might be possible on warlocks too, though for casters it only makes sense if you intend to sell runs.
---
here's the thing if you can't "afford" to play hardcore hours (obv don't need 12 hours a day lmao) then you don't *need* to be on the fucking bleeding edge of progression. It's really ok if you're not
---
Unpopular opinion: I hate Danny McBride in every role he's done
---
You can always respec, can't you? 
---
If gold is an issue I believe shadow priests can easily solo farm dm east for arcanite crystals.  Or farm lashers.
---
My guild does MC every other week Monday &amp; Tuesday back to back, leaves lots of time in offspec to pvp.
---
Hands of Power, if you get a mage partner you can duo the boss in LBRS, just bring invis pots and feathers.
---
Are you on Earthshaker and play alliance side? :)
---
The death rattle of the WoW Classic enthusiast as he loses an argument.
---
Negative, I am alliance but I play on Sulfuras
---
My server is lucky then. All the raiding guilds GMs have their own discord to coordinate when the heads will drop so we can be ready.
---
Furbolg lives DON'T matter
---
Do mages have level 55 food yet? I've only been given 55 water and 45 food
---
Just saw a post where someone said that the red hat dropped off Dagram Thaurisan (final boss) in BRD.
---
Horde won a few matches. Still 29k rep to exalted. Decided I’d just grind 3k rep a day while leveling my mage alt on second account.
---
Prot pally nulifies all that, particularly if they know how to LoS.
---
Arcanist is the best if you also have the helm &amp; bracers for the 3 piece set bonus.
---
For the PvP set Boots &amp; Shoulders are the ideal pieces to wear.
---
Hands of Power are pre-raid BiS.
---
My very first Onyxia run was as a healer, and I had absolutely zero idea what I was doing. I ran in during phase 1 and pulled Aggro on the whelps from left cave and ran them straight to the tank, causing half the raid to wipe lol. Don’t feel too bad, everyone fucks up. It is a 30 min encounter that resets every 5 days, strive to improve and you will have the opportunity to run it a lot.
---
Since the release of AV the prices have dropped from 8g a stack to 2.5g on my server
---
I have not tried to do this quest due to all the horror stories.  Everyone that has done it successfully has their own theories on how to keep it from glitching out.  Try searching this subreddit or google.  Good luck.
---
It's common knowledge that if anything's going on reserve you announce it prior to the run. Either you missed it or he's just a big ole douche. Probably the latter.
---
how do knowing item levels help you in classic? what do you get out of having them on every graphic?
---
kinda problematic lol. Blizzard's 2004 really showing here
---
Thankfully, there are alternatives for most items.
---
At some point in retail it was definitely reportable *if* loot rules were stated beforehand. It doesn't apply to classic though because they decided to save on support staff.
---
The further down it is the newer it is. If your queue pops and ypur number is high up on the list, that is likely an Ongoing AV. If far down it is likely a brand new one.
---
And the #1 reason an old AV suddenly recieves empty spaces is that it became a fight where both teams are turtling. 
---
Now I find those fights fun, but likely in those games both Galv and Balinda is already dead, plenty of officers dead as well, so theres much less bonus honor to go around.
---
I mean there is always retail , you just raid log do your shit and switch to retail or another game . No problem here tbh
---
People moved the complaining to the AV battleground chat
---
3 rogues, sap all three. Kill the pets. Resap, burn locks one at a time.
---
Though idk uf the pvp class trinket for locks breaks sap.
---
Which, on my realm at least, you never do. Almost never, at least. I did manage to get 70-80% of waters for my Hide of the Wild and healing enchant, but it took quite a few early mornings and unorthodox camping. 
---
"When you have them to yourself" as you say, indeed!
---
At this point drop enchanting get herring sell those for gold enchanting is a gold sink.
---
That's a hunter item right there
---
“Won”
---
Sulfuras is an awesome server. Even during the Phase2 madness when everyone here was complaining incessantly I was thinking how it seemed great and balanced on Sulfuras.
---
You love to see it
---
Council and Illidan have very punishing mechanics and are long fights which can limit attempts by most guilds. If your two tanks for Illidan are super consistent during flame tanking it isn’t bad but I wouldn’t say any of those three fights are jokes. Mother can have strings of terrible RNG where the teleports hit the worst spots and cause wipes
---
Yes...
---
Ya it's very easy. Just mention that in your lookingforgroup message. Do a jump run. Take lvl 30+ to make it super easy. Should only take an hour or two with travel time and making a group.
---
Don't worry. I know some guildies who died every Ony we made. It has been 12 weeks and they are present in every raid.
---
Wow this is awesome. I finally found a good reliable way to solo farm gold. BTW if your an orc and you can do the jump @0:45 is almost impossible to do as an orc coz the model is bigger i think. But dont worry u can go left and stuck yourself in that corner and jump on top of that big branch thingy.
---
Isn't it 175 wins? In 2 days??
---
It wastes time in different ways. In retail, it wastes time because it's completely inefficient to gear that way when you can just do world quests and m+ to gear up. In classic it wastes time because that's what classic does.
---
Again, different games. If you still don't get it, you're just being dense and I'm not sure why you're in this sub.
---
Much prefer adibags.
---
Our first Obsidian Edged Blaze went to a rest pally!
---
Loads of people love having a druid around but never more than one from my experience. I'd never pass over a guildy based on class, with the exception of greens who've never done the Lyceum in BRD and we have no AoE, but you try pug and no one wants a second druid in the party.
---
The crit buff your provide the party as a feral or OOMkin is always loved but the fact you can Innervate the healer (if you're the healer yourself it's never noticed really), battle rez when shit goes down, throw out heals when it's needed in emergencies AND pop bear form as an impromptu tank/meat shield with an AoE taunt is so nice.
---
You'd never really want one of you're doing fine and have it down to a T but just like real life shit tends to happen and the druid brings so many little things to help.
---
Haha from horde point of view its pretty damn funny when you wipe the entire ally raid with just a couple of mages and hunters when they do those big pulls.
---
Then its like most of the allies give up and its a free win.
---
2 manned it as a warrior with a priest friend. If you tank anger along the wall on the bottom under the ledge the adds won’t aggro. One of you logs on an alt and resets. Have to use the wall jump on the trash between arena and the window(don’t open the shadow forge lock you can jump over it and glitch down) and then invis pots to get past the trash between that and angerforge. Quick runs we threw arena in there as we both got better gear so we’d avoid lockout.
---
Put a shadow resist set together. Bait dispels and use fireward if the warlock figures it out. Still not gonna roll the warlock but you will have a decent chance.
---
It really depends on context. Am i doing stuff in IF and you just open trade? That's rude.
---
If we're in a raid or BG together and you open trade we're partymembers and providing water/food is my job.
---
There's a big difference...
---
Hes a druid so he needs to go cat form first.
---
Right. But it shouldn't be random. In my experience playing many AV games since Wednesday there was a clear gradient from losing every single game to Zerg mid week to winning a few if we could manage to get a turtle going and then Saturday I no joke had like a 80% winrate over like 20+ games doing the same thing every game. It didn't feel like a fluke. 
---
Anyway you're definitely right it doesn't really matter, especially since I'm like 3 bars to exalted. I just found it very odd and wondered if others experienced it too or I just had weird luck.
---
well played! :D
---
Yeah, dunno.
---
I get that much, i'm sitting at just under 300 right now without the epic mount (fingers crossed for AV but even 600 is like FUCK) But i'm pretty much at the raidlogging part aside from BGs. Although i'm pretty damn pleased with that i just can't ever really find dungeon groups as a healer.
---
Do you read this sub reddit these days? Wheres your vast majority gone bro?
---
I'd go for R7 and grab the pvp hands and boots. Those two, with the 2-piece set bonus, are really solid.
---
If you can get to R10, the pvp shoulders can be used instead of the hands for the set bonus, and then you can use Arcanist gloves instead for the 3-piece arcanist bonus. But, you'll end up using the R7 gloves while grinding R10 and waiting for arcanist to drop.
---
The two locations I remember are the volcano in Un'goro and the lake in Winterspring. Check around there and you should find an invasion eventually.
---
Thats greatfather winter. NOT SANTA.

It's a kind of drink. Usually takes eggs, white rum or similar alcohol, shaken until creamy/frothy. Sometimes served hot and with a little bit of nutmeg on top.
---
It's popular around easter in some countries though, like mine. I never had eggnog around christmas.
---
He boutta be drownin in puddy with that tabard though
---
Did you keep laughing when 50 skeletons came after your ass?
---
Is there a chance to also transfer from Horde to alliance, like in retail?
---
They can get it but I think it requires an item from Strat and some quest from DM. I have not run either so only have the 45 stuff...
---
Get used to it, my Starfire Crits for up to 2500 and a moonfire is 600+, and they both hit at once when linked together.  It's not uncommon for me to instantly delete a player with under 3100 health.
---
As you gear up, things get better.  But if your fresh, it's going to feel like your just a hot air balloon waiting to be popped.
---
The other two are very top right of Azshara where the Little mountain is at the very edge.
---
And Silithus where the wind elementals spawn. Where you kill the thunderfury Boss etc. Top left of silithus
---
I haven't seen one either. Not heard of them on my Server.
---
But quite sure they exist ;)
---
Heartseeker is pretty alliance dominated. Still a decent amount of horde so it definitely still feels alive. Everything has gotten much better now that BGs are out.
---
How do you figure? You still need to get hit capped in PVP. Also try pvping with with 1/300 wep skill if it doesn't matter, see how that goes for you.
---
Ive noticed tons of people in top bracket running 24/7 and mostly afking. Fucking sucks that its happening. Blizzard rly should look into peoples accounts that stay active for the whole day.
---
I love to mindcontrol the handlers, they destroy those whelps with the AOEs and your party doesn't take any damage. Too bad it's hard to MC them without pulling half the room.
---
That database is incorrect on this. I remember double checking this a while back, I forget what patch it was added to EPL but it was after vanilla.
---
Sigh *unzips*
---
Oh wow look at one thing in the only negative fashion you know and come to a negative conclusion about a game. Sounds fun!
---
Nope.
---
Ruling a guild is just another full-time manager job with its ups and downs.
---
Good luck to you and I wish you well with BWL releasing and many wipes coming - it's going to be the true trial for the health of your raiding roster!
---
Looks like Food isn't coming until p6.
---
Luckily for our group, we did the summon boss first, and could see the altar thingie through the hole.
---
Not the case in my guild. Ran by 2 hunters and a warlocks. Neither of which are getting TF. Sorry for your lack of guild leaders not wanting legendaries.
---
I personally don't. Just now I found out what eggnog translates to in my language, and apparently people in my country also make eggnog and drink it for Christmas. I guess it's just my family that never made eggnog for the season.
---
It's not that, even if I became good at it I would get far too heated for my own good. I have a short fuse and tend to avoid stressful situations. I got enough stress in my life as is.
---
What is the best way to get honor in AV as horde atM?
---
&gt;Right now I have no idea how to enjoy this game anymore.
---
Well it's a game, not a job, so you can just not play and move on with your life. No big deal
---
Fuck Vanqueef
---
THANK YOU. God it feels like I'm babysitting grown ass adults half the damn time running and main tanking my guild.
---
Fuck yeah I remember this. It was such a breath of fresh air. Now it'll be min maxed and abused.
---
Me too but then I remembered the video thumbnail said 0:05.
---
New servers on starting on the current patch is how they handled it in vanilla, not a bit reach to assume IF they made new servers they would be at the current patch level.
---
Go back to.....retail?
---
Yea, we run around, ok, maybe I'll just jump in next time to find it.  I've only done Rag 4 times and this was my first swimming experience and just couldn't get out.  Thanks!
---
That might make sense if you want to win a duel, but what sane person would carry that crap around?
---
Yes! TBC is gonna be great
---
Just going to mention that no one should use "Heal rank 1" even if that wasn't what you meant incase someone wasn't aware of the subpar healing power coefficient on Heal rank 1 compared to Heal rank 2.
---
Garithos never represented the Alliance as we know it in WoW, tired of this excuse. He was a single rogue warlord in a post-acolyptic hellscape where society had completely broken down. What the hell does he have to do with the humans of Stormwind, the dwarves, the gnomes, or the NElves?
---
Meant to be running away from a rogue
---
trade chat being typical
---
Germans are a nationality.  Orcs are a species.
---
Salvation buff is honestly a great resource. Definitely something to be jealous of from our side. I think its mainly a big deal for MC and progression on BWL because Fury/prot hasn't come online yet. After TF + Fury/Prot + Gear + windfury totem, threat will be the least concern.
---
But trying to hold threat over min/max orc warriors WITH windfury totem right now.... Such a challenge lol, but I'm loving it.
---
It’s more of a mix of the new and old players not knowing what they were signing up for. Old players that were very noob in vanilla, wanting to take it more serious now. New players expecting it to take little effort. None of them actually looking into the reality of it.
---
There’s also those that reach their goal and decide to just cruise for now, playing other games to not burn out. Some people don’t like idea of nebulous goals, it’s why many don’t like games such as Minecraft. So they set simple ones, nothing lofty.
---
Probably still an upgrade from DrCatharticDiasshoea :)
---
While I get the whole efficiency honor thing people talk about with AV, any game I'm in that goes longer than 25 minutes is always just so much fun.
---
Foreal fuck your gains I'll be camping IBGY chokepoint
---
Nah. Salv.
---
Not on daggers no
---
Thats kinda weird dude, nobody is forcing you to have fun but at the same time your goals would literally flag you psychotic on a mental health test.
---
Seems very alliance centric, as a horde survivor on there I’ve enjoyed it though.
---
So theres no point in me getting AV exalted right now?
---
as a mage you get really used to ignoring people's pms or you are going to waste a shitload of your own time
---
that said I always give free water in bgs because im fucking afk in city during queue so why not make a ton
---
Why not grab some buddies and do a premade yourself...?
---
I literally only see constructive critism. People are asking blizzard to do X, Y and Z all the time. I don't see anyone actually just saying "game is shit fuck you"
---
&gt; Keep sting ... up
---
Don't waste debuff slots on that garbage.
---
Yea, if you as a mage, have all cool downs, and top level gear, and get to play against a lock that isn’t allowed to use all his skills you have a 1% chance of beating a lock with equal skill.
---
I think I had 5 runs for defias chest haha , also got venomstrike on first try
---
seriously, those guys calculating rewards like accountants on a excel sheet make me so sad for them
---
i got rank 11 in hearthstone after making a new deck while afking at a bunker in AV. im done grinding honor after this week, rank 8 it is. Hoping they will nerf the honor from killing NPCs soon so other farms are competitive.
---
Option 3, don't turn it to turtle. Kill all captains from bunkers and win the game.
---
I don't understand why some people thinks there is no such option.
---
Yeah you're not wrong at all, objectively it's not a playstyle that's very rewarding. It's just stupid fun, but certainly not *good* or desirable for most of the content, generally speaking. 
---
You constantly switch from two-shotting a dungeon boss and thinking "holy shit this is broken" to almost submitting a ticket to Blizzard because your fucking windfury hasn't procced in a million hits so it absolutely *HAS* to be bugged. But this is more of an enhancement thing anyway.
---
The amount of times I embarassed myself by attacking players with a wet noodle hit that chipped a whopping 4% hp off them before they turned around and killed me. Atleast you'll reliably make the one squirrel near your corpse break the sound barrier as you shoot it straight to the fucking stratosphere with a 4k burst.
---
Goddamn I hate/love this character. It's like the one friend that's hilarious to have around but often let's you down in the end.
---
Ummmmmm maybe don't judge my culture? Excuse me?
---
when you actually want to have pvp on a pvp battleground
---
:0 I look forward to buying the print!
---
Until 3.0 pre-patch when I remember 5 ret pally clearing with divine storm healing the place faster than any of our clears during the xpak... damn level 70 new talent power creep.
---
The answer to this isn't that his gear was good.
---
But that the other mage probably had the +30% EXTRA DAMAGE BUFF - "General's Warcry" or something like that.
---
/thread
---
But did you know you can be both efficient and fun at the same time? Some people will back cap without looking at the map and realizing that by back capping they will only be locking themselves into a stalemate. There is a difference between winning, or losing and being efficient and having fun, vs just mindlessly doing things that untimely hinder the games progression. It would be like driving backwards in a racing game, and defending it by saying you're just having fun. I'm not saying that you are specifically arguing this. I am just ranting lol. I guess the problem is that the Fun all too often leads to mindlessness, and disorganization, which everyone agree's is not fun to deal with. Also for some being efficient is fun.
---
I have never been prouder to be alliance
---
Last man standing kills are always the best.
---
Kinda off topic, but anyone know if ILL is still active on Sulfuras Horde?
---
Had the same thing with a guy named "Panther". It fucked the addon a bit, since I killed him (enemy faction).
---
Try World of Warcraft: Chronicles, it's a trilogy dealing with everything from the creation of the universe to warcraft II i think
---
Sweeet
---
Frostbolt has a nice spelldamage coefficient because of the improved frostbolt talent. Something like 84%? Spell damage is a great stat for mages. Anyway, both AV and WSG have +30% damage buffs, even with crappy dungeon blues you can still pull 1.8k on the regular.
---
Was insane!!!
---
Every time I would land in everlook I would use /1 and ask if anyone was ethnically cleansing furbolgs in the area. Got some really weird responses....
---
Can you say that on Reddit?
---
Damn, that sucks to get so close
---
Was out in ungoro herbing and everyone just wanted to chill no one was fighting.
---
Do you know if anyone logged the fight on warcraftlogs? If so, you could watch the replay there.
---
For any dragon fight, you need to stay away from the front (breath) and back (tail swipe). If it wasn't one of those things, and it was actually phase 3, the only other thing it sounds like it could have been is an aggro pull during the delicate transition.
---
&gt;The truth is, as you admit, that you don't actually want to raid progressively. You just prefer not having a choice, which is kind of interesting. Funny, too.
---
I don’t admit that at all. You literally just made that up, after misinterpreting what I said. Is it fun to be delusional? You clearly are.
---
&gt;Homie, right now on Classic it's hard to find people to do the Onyxia attunement dragons and that's current content.
---
Homie. You know there’s a difference between hard and impossible, right? If not google that shit.
---
You also realize that a raid in BfA takes more people than an Ony attunement right? Because it does. 
---
Lastly, the Ony attunement is a gate. Old raids are not. Drastic difference there.
---
&gt;if you wanted to, you're free to raid progressively if you want
---
No. You can’t. As I mentioned before by the second month of a raid being out, it becomes impossible to pug anything below heroic mode. 
---
Normal mode legitimately will have 0 groups running in the group finder tool by the time a raid is a few months old, *while it’s still current content*. Old normal mode raids tend to have 0 groups going since world quest gear is higher level that old normal mode raid gear.
---
&gt;I know certain people are loathe to have a choice and they get upset when people don't do things...
---
That literally has nothing to do with it. You really don’t understand how the system works. It’s obvious you never lived in it or experienced it. 
---
Might help to pull you head out of your ass. Your arrogance and false sense of superiority are preventing you from perceiving reality.
---
Huh, interesting, I was under the impression that they were not released yet. Thanks for correcting me, might actually be worth grinding r10 then!
---
Theres no threat reset, fireballs drop threat in p2, and then highest from p1/p2 that's left picks up in p3. This means you want your highest threat producing tank to be 4-8 on the threat meter in p1, hopefully get rage off whelps and then go absolutely nuts end of 2/start of 3
---
Just my personal experience on alliance, might not universal.  If people want to heal they’re usually a priest and priest is what’s in demand. So, pallies and druids are in a small number and get geared quick. Priests are usually stacked and need to get in a long line of other priests to get gear.
---
That's a great one too and I've used a similar one for my druid so it would cast water or travel form depending on what type of ground I was standing on/in.
---
But I'm actually kind of against macros that do "too much" for you - read, macros that are clever enough to think in your stead. I don't feel like warrior is button starved (not as much as druid at the very least) so I have 2 or 3 macros for stance-swapping and casting charge/intercept.
---
Also, here is the copied version of your macro since phone formatting is a bit different than your outcome:
---
\#showtooltip \[ability name\]
---
(/startattack)
---
/cast \[nocombat, nostance:1\] Battle Stance
---
/cast \[nocombat, harm, nodead\] Charge
---
 /cast \[combat, nostance:3\] Berserker Stance 
---
 /cast \[combat, harm, nodead\] Intercept
---
Again, thanks for sharing!
---
so you never played tbc but you talked about it as if you were familiar. 
---
basically this sub
---
I think everyone is having their rose tinted glasses on about the difficulty of TBC just like they were having about classic. Why not make new content even harder than naxx on classic+ and really push the limits, open up some of these off limit zones with content like hyjal. Give us more 5 man dungeons for all level ranges, give us more 10 man dungeons for all level ranges, etc.
---
Tons of shit they can do, tons of quests they can add, and even new mechanics that dont affect current difficulty scale and itemization.
---
What I took from this was the fact that the runner has the word virgin on his chest
---
That's why I just duo corpse camp anyone and everyone in open world as 2 undead rogues
---
they will do it with 8 Ret Pallies
---
Took ages for that to happen? He gets healed at the 00:00:00 timestamp of the video by \[Milkydonuts\] for 945 health. And gets healed pretty much non stop until Milkydonuts gets interrupted. Then he gets a Power Word: Shield and a heal from Elena at 00:00:15. He then gets healed by Milkydonuts and Elena at the same time.
---
You need a large group to do it at a decent rate. We take a team and it drops in less than an hour.
---
And this is why I don't think people should have multiple raids groups with the same people, because there will be so many raids and people would have to do the same twice a week until they burn out
---
A lot of people got into markets before they crashed, so they were able to get a good jump on gold.
---
There’s also those that don’t mind smoking a bowl or drinking some beer and just zoning out farming while they watch/listen to Netflix.
---
Also, if you are raidlogging already, that’s just time you could be making gold that you are choosing to do something else (this isn’t bad, I’m not saying you’re wrong, I’m in those boat too).

good news AV is a PVE race with PVP on the side
---
You need to stay logged in and play long enough for that 1g to make sense.
---
Do you have a premade group that you play with?  People from your guild?  Do you play solo at all?
---
How about some guild drama. Our guild has merged/co-raided with the same couple small guilds for awhile now. We are basically at a point where we are one group but one guild wants to keep their name to play with RL friends that don’t have time to play a whole lot. Since not having a whole guild from the start we have been just rolling on gear for now which has its ups and downs but we do give priority on every item except for one, and you guessed it, that’s where the drama is. In our raids we mentioned that those who take the time to farm crafting mats will have priority rolling for hand of rag. We give priority to hunters for their leaf from domo if they have the sinew, and vice verse for the sinew if they had the leaf before grouping with us. However we did not give any priority on the eye of divinity. Only 1 of our 5 priests took the time to farm the eye of shadow. The other 4 did not. The first eye of divinity went while guilds were still freshly grouping together and there was not really any drama about it. After a couple weeks of only getting leafs, officers brought up a possible priority on eye of divinity for the one priest that farmed the other part. The second eye of divinity went to a shadow priest that did not have the eye of shadow, nor the gold to buy one. 3 weeks went by and that priest had shown very little effort in farming for the eye of shadow. Since no effort was shown, the one priest with the eye of shadow  emphasized priority should be given to him and the officers agreed but the loot master did not. The loot master (not guild master) made his own decision and gave the next eye to another priest who did not take the time to farm for the eye of shadow. Now there is drama because the priest with the eye of shadow is pissed. He is mad because everything we have has a type of priority except his item and he will likely be the last to receive his item since the guild officers are wanting to change to a DKP system instead of a rolling system. What are your thoughts? Should he have been given priority or should he just be told to deal with it and risk losing him to another guild?
---
Good thing you don't have 2 hunters or one of them would be named *******
---
As a Tauren druid I really do view myself as more neutral. I'm down to help an ally kill their quest mob, or throw out a hurricane with an alliance mage aoe farming. If you /moo at me though I am going to attack you. We're tauren not cows, get it sorted.
---
b/c my guild always needs a tank. I'm not charging guild members to get orbs. But if I can earn some cash in bits of down time, that's pretty good.
---
hopefully you can hold down a guild long enough that you no longer need to run MC and Ony. Once the key gear has been obtained from the raid, and upgrades from BWL/AQ/etc make the MC gear irrelevant, no need to go anymore. If you have 38 peeps in BiS or close, those 2 new 60s to replace the ones the disappeared can be carried in preraid BiS and crafted for the most part
---
The AV items are in (except the caster ring), but the WSG items are not.
---
Gotta have them to be able to care
---
Yah I play for fun though, not for you.
---
Yeah, thats pretty much what i was saying. I get that but its just ehhh.
---
I'm alright with raid logging, its just nuts how much gold some people get.
---
Mankirks wife is dead
---
/duel ftw
---
turns out if you're funny and not an asshole, things usually work out!
---
Sorry friend but it does and it's a lifesaver for many fights or to save yourself from fall damage! (=
---
I've been playing WoW for like 13 years. I understand the system quite well. 
---
The solution to your problem is to find a guild of like-minded individuals who want to raid progressively, by the way. I love how your go-to argument is that it's impossible to "pug". Because pugging raids is the mark of one who really cares about pve content.
---
Just admit that you don't actually want to do it, buddy. It's okay. No one is going to judge you.
---
The funny thing is that you're the cry baby crying about premades.
---
“I play a Paladin because I’m righteous and always fighting for the greater good. I also sniff my own farts and blame my surroundings for anything that doesn’t go my way”

Kill him
---
Do alliance get more rep for winning? if so then it won't be long until horde can't AV at all because all the alliance players have moved on
---
WoW is inspired from human history. There were many cases where indigenous tribes did not trust the outsider until the outsider helped them destroy their rival tribe(s).
---
I make about 60-100g an hour. I just vendor the items. The only thing I sell are mana potions on the AH. They go for 15g a stack on my server.
---
yeah id still take the bindings if I had a chance to do so tho lol 
---
but I guess some people take this stuff super seriously lol
---
Well this is wrong. I've started it a couple weeks ago and wandered about healing the raid just fine without mishap
---
I a warr dps. P1 white hits, some more abilities later on. P2 chill. P3 white hits until every other melee dps takes aggro from tank and dies. Then healers, then we wipe :)
---
A trade discord channel is probably more what I'm searching for then. It just struck me an hour ago when i wanted to buy Staff of Jordan &amp; Eye of Shadow for a reasonable price but the AH prices are just way too high, and writing in Trade wasn't generating any whispers. So basicly i just wanted somewhere to put up "Hey, im buying item x for y gold, pm if interested" on some place where other traders on the realm could see it.
---
Imagine being mad that a tank weapon goes to tanks
---
This is the new meta.
---
They’re in. Had a fire invasion in Ungoro on my server.
---
This rapidly evolving meta is why I’m starting to not hate AV
---
ah, that’s interesting. i never really got good at the priest and this didn’t occur to me.
---
watch out, we got a badass over here.
---
i did months ago
---
When you stall out the game to make everyone miserable.
---
hey did you used to play on The Rebirth pserver?
---
Ohh I‘m sorry he did indeed get healed quite fast.
---
Yet with a pocket healer I would expect more than 4 heals + 1 shield in 30sec.
---
It was 2 people even. That just looks like regular healing to me... 
---
I didn’t mean to hit any vulnerable points I even agreed with you :D 
---
Except for the pocket healer but which is obviously just you trying to discredit this clip...
---
You mad at Warriors, brah?
---
It's not even about the rewards, it's about just not being purposely detrimental to obtaining the objective. Like if you wipe the enemy team while their only graveyard is in-between you and your objective, you will have just screwed yourself from getting to your objective. It would be like if you knew you needed to drive 300 miles, but only had enough gas to go 100 miles, would you choose to try to make the whole trip without stopping? That would be a stupid game to play.
---
The irony of playing a competitive game and actually wanting to lose quickly so you can play another confounds me.... Why even play if your only goal is to be a.... well.. a loser. 
---
I get that individual agency in a 40man slugfest isn't high but encouraging others to act like sheep and not better themselves or learn about how the game flows is horrible. Nobody should encourage this weak behavior especially the horde.....
---
Literally you can't get 55 food as a mage yet. AV food is great because it's pretty much the only 55 food in-game.
---
What the hell is going on here? I just logged in to see this beached crocolisk nightmare -- far in excess of spawn rates and with no sign of player farming. Honestly a little unsettled.
---
This made me laugh more than it should have
---
Slyvannas put it there.
---
What can I say, I like to be rewarded, getting max rep/honor is what makes me happy as it leads to the gear. If losing is the fastest way to get there, then that's the path I will want to take. I have other things I want to do with my time than sit in a stalemate. If I wanted to do that, I could stay in town and stare at the bankers.
---
Turtle problems require turtle solutions
---
I have still seen a lot of people out in the world but it has felt harder to get dungeon groups together.
---
And you saying it isn’t relevant doesn’t make it all irrelevant — Oh wow look I did it too!
---
I play alliance and horde, not sure what you mean by “hiding” you cum-frothing inbred
---
Mind control to to solo? Seems pretty impossible
---
We've been friends for a long time so I know hes a try hard when it comes to MMOs. I dont play as hardcore as he does and hes never given me shit for it.
---
"Wait until TBC".  I really really really really hope that classic does not turn into the same expansion progression with re-leveling to 70 and everything.  Classic+ is actually a good idea, BC has improvements that could be given to Classic without all of the reset and flying being added to the game. Please no.
---
Yeah, I found these myself while Googling around. I might order them on Amazon. They look pretty cool.
---
Get some friends and premade you big pu$$y. 
---
People like you cry when things get hard or challenging. 
---
Here would you like me to bring you a win on a silver plate. 
---
Absolute pu$$y who has no friends.
---
Climate change is real!
---
Also where I get my mage water.
---
If it makes you feel better, I wiped my guild because i got the bomb on barron but i was super tunnel visioned.
---
It was by no means my first raid. But luckily, after some time, someone else screwed up worse than i did and I stopped being the butt of the joke.
---
Seemed more like you just wiped all the alliance at that point. You were 3 people standing right at the flag, and all the aoe stopped at that point. It was just good timing.
---
Bloodsail Buccaneers has been one of the nicest servers that I've been on in years. I always enjoyed the RP realms that I've played on over the standard PvE ones. People are much nicer and the occasional RP event is actually quite nice!
---
If the Germans reorganized their entire state into the New National Socialist party, swastikas and all, named their capital Hitlermar, and started a mssive military buildup, I would absolutely say that that state should be dismantled.
---
That is what the New Horde is.  Destroying that state before it delivered on the horrifying promise of genocidal aggression implicit in the name Horde is what Daelin was trying to do.  
---
The orcs didn't name their faction the New Mag'har alliance.  They named it the horde.  It's the equivalent of putting god damn skulls on all your iconography - which the Horde also does.  Face it, when your faction name and logo is the exact same as the army of legion allied genociders, and your principle decorating motif is skulls and spikes - yes, [you are the baddies](https://youtu.be/ToKcmnrE5oY).
---
That is TBC, in vanilla only certain mobs in wok drop it.
---
This is why i went pally instead of priest. If you're the last one standing at least you have plate armor on and can maybe weather the storm
---
I don't think that last part is entirely true, for instance gnomes, dwarves, and troggs all come from creations/constructs of the Titans.
---
&gt;You’re an asshole and you’re abusing game mechanics to grief an enemy player.
---
Victim complex confirmed. Lack of spine acknowledged. 
---
&gt;crying about premades.
---
      
---
Using an example to counter your logic and explain how both could be viewed as forms of abusing game mechanics is not crying, sorry.
---
many of them are also so called PVPeers more interested in efficiency than actually battling people
---
Can tank as dps war for the most part, especially if you have a decent amount of your bis list. Plus a couple dad gear to replace non plate/mail items
---
It's out, and the boots/shoulders are raiding BiS.
---
Hooooly moley. That sounds intense! :D Thanks!
---
And there’s that nightelf right next to you that have you the lap dance after the mall closed. 
---
Nice. 
---
Nice.
---
How do I join AV with my buddies?
---
Logically, the orc strength after WC3 should be negligible the entire orc population fit on a fleet of stolen alliance ships, and then they suffered significant losses to night elves and demons.
---
However, Azeroth doesnt operate on logic. The Alliance would still have exactly enough troops to deal with whatever they encountered., just as the Horde does.
---
Not really important. It's not like you HAVE to be exalted as fast as possible
---
We had one person that constantly stayed by the well. Completed the quest just fine. Not to say that's the solution but it worked for us
---
I believe you. Totally.
---
I've killed the fire boss and the earth boss with one other player. They dropped essences/elementals/unique to them green item.
---
Weirdly enough that's the one dungeon that seems to go 24/7 on my server
---
I agree, something needs to be addressed.  There is absolutely no point to bother grinding anywhere but AV for honor in the current state, which means you cant play with friends which hurts enjoyment for me personally.  
---
WSG, at least as horde, is 80% pug vs premades so unless you're queueing with a premade the honor is terrible.  Not a complaint, just an observation of how unplayable WSG is as a solo player.
---
It's a decision you make.  Being a MT is not exactly a sacrifice, you're funneled loot and press buttons like everyone else, most of the time everything you do is funded by the guild.  Main Tanks are necessary and that's about it, a Thunderfury is a guild achievment and not a personal one, it's just a shame that the only person who truly gets to show it off is the person who wears it.
---
Rogue here that recently won Brutality Blade. Already have the Dalrend set as well as Mirahs song. What’s the best combination here ?
---
In ten years you didn't learn this before? Pug smashing always was the cornerstone of ranking in BGs. I don't like it either at all but that is how the system works and I don't hold much hope that blizzard will change it.
---
yeah but it can damage all the guys around the flag trying to cap it
---
Maybe not fully "drunk" in raids but that's our plan. We are still building up the guild though for a nice small group of casuals. 
---
We did BRDrunk the other night where we had drinking rules included. Each time you died you had to take a drink, wipes were extra drinks, butt pulls were drinks, and so on. It was a lot of fun. Once we get larger, I will start hosting weekend BG events with drinking rules as we used to do this on another server of less legit origins. 
---
If you are on the server, we are always looking for more fun people so give me a shout in-game!
---
I think it is more the speed at 3.4 and 2.9 on Ashjre’thul and Rhok’delar, respectively. As well as the top end damage of 186 and 166, respectively.
---
Funny story maybe.... but our raid has 8 Warlocks most weeks for our MC runs.  I guess we locked out?  LOL.
---
We have only two Druids and they are tiered out already.
---
While the longer AVs are definitely more fun, my honor/hour has dropped drastically since day 1. I think my AVs average around 15-20 minutes and the queue time is around 17 minutes. Day 1 queue time was 3 minutes and matches very rarely took longer than 10 minutes. 
---
At least I can be happy that everyone are getting less honor, so it doesn't matter for ranking.
---
Depends on how you define winning.  For a lot of people it's not about the individual games of AV, but about how quickly you can get your reward (Exalted gear &amp; Honor Ranks).
---
I've been apart of the guild since day 1 and helped recruit a fair number of members while leveling. I'm also one of maybe 10 or 15 active discord members so I'd be surprised if I was just another random. But I suppose I dont feel like I owe anyone anything. My buddy is the sort of meme cliche that says "let's play together" then hits 60 in the first week. He gets significantly more time to play than I do.
---
Nothing even comes close for a holy paladin atm.
---
&gt; Well I guess you're the only person in the world who wants to raid progressively. It's actually impossible for you to find like-minded individuals to group with.
---
Do you understand that, right now, heroic dungeon gear in BfA is the same level as Mythic raiding gear from the first tier of content? Normal mode dungeon gear is like heroic level from that tier iirc. Mythic 0s, which are part of the standard progression path, reward gear equal to heroic tier from the second raid.
---
So even if you skipped traditional catchup mechanics, that is unavoidable. Which you’d know if you actually played retail. 
---
So you will outgear and trivialize those raids, just by getting your pre-raid BiS. Which then bumps your world quest rewards up, You’d understand that if you played.
---
There aren’t any people willing to spend months progressing on a hard Mythic boss, that will factually provide 0 upgrades. So Mythic raiding those, is completely out of the question. Those fights still have one shot mechanics that a whole team of 20 needs to know. 
---
Heroic raids, that are older, tend to be an absolute joke, because of the catchup gear. You walk in, everything just dies.
---
So. How does one progress under that paradigm. E.g. the current game where Blizz increases the power of *basic dungeon gear* every major patch.
---
It was actually a lot of fun just interacting with other people, would do again!
---
previously the spawn rate was awful for this quest, as well as the drop rate.
---
looks like they increased it in this latest update.
---
I was enhance till level 58 then went 30/0/21
---
Then the whole life is unfair, duh.
---
Imo, try to get your name reported and be forced to do a namechange; I'm not sure how many reports you would need.
---
Yay Sulfuras!
---
Look at all that free leather!
---
I'm spoiled with an insta-queue on Alliance side, and feel for the Horde with their 8+ minute queue times.  But if you turn every match into a turtle, and I spend 58 minutes losing (or winning, frankly), I'm done queueing for the night and your queue just got longer.
---
It's for my Twink so I had to have it haha
---
Yea, then shadow burns crit for almost 2k I’ll take my shard bag
---
nice
---
That's the idea of them anyways. As with anything else, people tend to corrupt things that were set up with good intentions.
---
Can't wait.  I should have rethought being a DPS warrior... is that even a thing in BC?
---
Racist but definitely not genocidal, and I’m saying that as someone with a Horde main. The Alliance isn’t on the same level of badness at all lol
---
Yes it is in av to shadow burn fools
---
If you’re goal is 60 then I wouldn’t put too much thought into what is bis for a 34. I’d focus on leveling and the gear will come. Gear at that level will be expensive if you look on the AH due to twinking
---
I got hoj last night btw. Around 20 runs :)
---
check out Electrocutioner Leg, for off hand sword.
---
If you are horde look up "Outlaw Sabre" for main hand.
---
if you feel like grinding WSG, there rep sword you can buy.
---
otherwise there is mainhands on the AH. 
---
At level 45, get the quest to kill the princess in mara and find someone to kill her for you. Thrash Blade is amazing at lvl45 (especially if you are combat swords)
---
All of your posts have this moronic addendum where you attempt to gaslight your audience into thinking they want all previous content trivialized when new content is released.
---
And the funny thing is that classic wow has plenty of catch up mechanics, prebis was buffed several patches during vanilla to improve the contribution of non-raidgeared ppl looking to join raid teams
---
The only difference is previous content wasn’t trivialized so there’s still a reason to kill Ragnaros even if you aren’t required to kill Ragnaros before Nefarian
---
Sounds fun. Reminds me of the one time Oldschool Runescape's new homosexual mod implemented a gay pride event without polling it (all updates are polled) and the community freaked out. Everyone was wearing white robes and carrying noose wands (sticks with nooses on them used to trap small animals) and rioting. The pushback was so strong that they never had another gay pride event.
---
It was able to knock people down with regular snowballs, but they changed it to party members only, most likely because you were able to prevent someone from the same faction from picking up black lotuses or skinning devilsaurs etc. by throwing a snowball on them and steal it from them
---
Good point! I’ve thought about making a Pali alt. I main a priest and more often then not when this happens, I try to rez as a last ditch effort. If I have enough mana, haha.
---
Queue times seem to be getting longer and correcting this trend.  People are less likely to throw away the game they are in if it will take 20 minutes to get another.  Sadly, then we have long queues 🙁
---
I believe queue times are much better on Alliance, so only way to do it is to queue all at the same time and hope you get into the same one.  If you dont, leave the queue and try again.  On Horde the queues are 11minutes so not really feasible.
---
Level 1 blizzard/ rain of fire would like a word
---
why do you have to play dps warrior until a tank quits? that doesnt really make sense
---
also, I am there should be rogue leveling guides on youtube that will have a list of weapons you should progress through. That will prolly be your best source of info.
---
It's 15m queues these days.

Also I still haven't seen these mythical 1h turtles to be honest.
---
If you read the quest text, they only send you to kill the gnolls after communication is rebuffed. Tauren talk first then fight.
---
If it were a Forsaken quest, it would have had you kidnap some gnolls to perform torturous experimentations on, then poison their well to turn them into undead abominations.
---
I tought the same, but i do not think emma has BB.. :)
---
Have both a 60 lock and a 60 druid and I agree. Anecdotal evidente: I raid with my lock and there is only 3 of us in our guild, we would love more. We have 2 druids, one resto and one feral tank, don’t really need more of those.
---
Warlocks do nice dps and are monsters in PvP, don’t know why there aren’t more of them around.
---
Argh, my warlock is alchemy / tailoring. He'd better not miss out on the frost power elixir over some shitty green rags...
---
Lol
---
Look up the fight club discord and read the pins
---
They are abusing game mechanics by playing as a team and besting you, got it.
---
It’s just super easy to farm shards in AV and I was planning to do wsg premades afterwards didn’t want to run out
---
As somebody who doesn’t play wow but enjoys reading posts here. I haven’t a clue what’s going on sometimes.
---
Can somebody break it down for me?
---
This is the third or fourth post about this. I honestly think it’s one of two thing. Most gold farming bots on horde are troll hunters and my guess is that they make them in batches and just mindlessly kill these things after they get a pet at 10. There other thing could be this nightmare of a quest gives a lot of people a lot of grief so possibly someone called in a 60 mage friend to drag all the crocs in the river together and started blasting’ so no one went crazy.
---
This \^. Lasher Farming has helped me build gold back after throwing it all on the lovely tailor/enchanting recipes I can find.
---
I'm sat steadily at 6.5k Mana with a Disc Holy Build. Great stuff getting to AOE farm as a raid healer :)
---
But dude you need level 70 to do Mag's Lair and do each dungeon to progress!!!! Having played in TBC the only thing on that chart that was actually a hassle was getting heroic keys, it seriously is just an exaggeration and the person who made the chart intentionally tried to make it look as complicated as possible.
---
Textbook example of griefing.
---
My healing output as HotW is no less than other druids in the guild that are resto specced and I'm typically 2nd/3rd overall on meters...and my gear is no better than theirs.
---
I suspect I'd be more efficient in Moonglow build and as soon as my tanking is not needed, i'll respec.
---
I'll put it this way...HotW/NS build is not the most optimal build for tanking or healing.  However, there is nothing that would stop a properly geared druid from doing either, just as well as most tanks and most healers.  If you can afford to, picking a role and speccing towards it would probably be best...but if your guild needs both, sticking with that build is absolutely doable.

Objectively wrong.
---
and this thread is about ret paladin rolling on warrior gear.
---
Oh no sorry if I sounded like a dick lol I wasn’t complaining about seeing it a lot. It’s worth posting, I mean ya this is probably worth investigating. I know we got a bit problem now just like in vanilla. They just might be getting sneakier with it, it would be worth reporting as a bug. I’ve done that quest 200 times and I don’t see how it’s possible to have that many crocs spawn. One time I went nuts with it pulling them one after another without looting to increase my chances when I finally stopped but it never even got close to this.
---
I can hear a tiny ^^^"DIE ^^^INSECT!" in his voice. This is adorable.
---
But you're talking like Blizzard puts all your best items inside the raid. They don't. If you're a raider, you can raid and enjoy the gear rewards. Some people aren't raiders. Some people do dungeons and some people do pvp - they get their gear from there. You know that's okay, right? Like it's different choices and avenues for people to play the game how they best enjoy it. 
---
I mean, you can gatekeep the best gear in game inside raid content if you want, but that's trusting blizzard to actually know what stats the players want for every spec, on every piece, and put that item in the raid.
---
Yuck I'm sorry that sounds like a really crap position you got put in.
---
Hell yeah brother, preach
---
Hey you deleted all your other comments in this thread, but not this one?
---
This doesn't work on the horde.
---
I don't understand this. Horde kinda *is supposed* to lose in AV, since for allies to 'win' and make it worthwile rep &amp; honorwise, they *must win.* 
---
While horde can just go cap everything in sight and turtle a bit so they have more time to do that and they end up with more honor and more rep on the scoreboard.
---
the tabard is bis forever, so yeah he didn't.
---
hahahaha actual fucking moron
---
Cry about wpvp? All I've done is wpvp until BGs came out. All I do is pvp. My whole guild does it. Not sure where these "pussies" are youre talkin about.
---
Hello, fellow benediction player!
---
Level some warlock alts to lvl 20 and park them in the mountain with bags full of shards.  Summon yourselves into the mountain and run into MC.
---
The flag allows one team to use the graveyard (graveyards function like spawnpoints after you die). The person we are watching wants to take it from the other team for his own, but to do that he has to stand still without getting hit for that bar that says "Opening" to fill up. You can see that he tries it a few times, but gets hit and the bar changes to "Interrupted." So he asks that other player to transform into a bear, which has a large model and stand on the same spot as him. In this game players have no collision with each other, so it's possible for your model to be completely inside of someone else's. As a result, the other team cannot easily see him, therefore they can't target him and he is able to fill up the bar and begin the capture process for the graveyard.
---
Just to clarify a little further, it would be possible for the other team to see him if they position their camera inside of the player who is transformed into a bear. But, in the chaos, nobody thinks to do that. This also doesn't protect him from area effect attacks, so he got a bit lucky that nobody was spamming them at that moment. The strategy is often to have constant AoE attacks going at the flag.
---
That tabard is BiS forever.
---
this should be reportable.. this is not world pvp. this is some EVE shit.
---
I hope you reported them for extortion.
---
The higher ups in guild knew he was meme spec. 
---
Legitimately the only reason this post exists.
---
You could ask right here. Why use daily question topic to ask for resource, and not to ask about question itself?)
---
Damn dude, Blaumeux had a mass exodus when free transfer were up. shouldve joined us on arcanite reaper. I love the new realm
---
You could find a warr/druid and do Tyr's Hand farming. Or farming bats in EPL isn't too bad. A lot less ganking since AV is out.
---
Or do premade WSG just for fun. I just accepted that I won't be super high rank and I hate AV and there's nothing I can really get from the rep grind as a geared out holy priest. 
---
Me and a friend are also making twinks and running each other thru Deadmines for gear right now.

What a genius fucking idea! Fart-sniffing Paladin Tekuila87 at it again!

Auctionator includes an option to display vendor price. Seems a bit redundant to have a separate add-on for it.

It was our guilds first drop. He bid 91 dkp on it over every caster

i don't replay skyrim for the same reason i don't wanna raid MC when AQ/Naxx are out: I wanna do fun content and not dogshit content

You'd probably be better off running SFK SM or ulda

what?

the only way I have fun in BG is with premade. Heck, this is why i do WSG (who reward less honor) instead of AV as much as I can.

---
good mix of humor and /r/iamverybadass
---
You thought you did, but you didn't.
---
The rogue hid inside the bear character model so no one saw him capping the flag.
---
Also i have solution for you
---
1. Add new folder for fonts
---
_classic_/Fonts
---
2. Put there any fonts file with Cyrillic fonts and name it 
---
FRIZQT___CYR
---
Atm i using Montserrat font and i like it.
---
Revered, you don’t get rep from killing undead after that I’m pretty sure
---
Yeah I'm familiar with tanking in general since my warrior is mainly a tank, not a DPS. I prefer tanking to DPS even if it's slower in killing.
---
If others gain mana from judgment of SoW, does that threat count for me or them?
---
Wait do people actually buy toys based off of mobile game characters? Do people actually like mobile games that much?
---
Did you have to scream in chat to get the legs to drop?
---
I’m a fan of clash, yes :)
---
How fucking long was his yawn?!
---
I'll never understand the ultra wide, but I do get the upgrade!!  Congrats...  I prefer the 16:9, but you do you!
---
Maybe it's just don't go TOO far away, as a healer I didn't go as far off as some of the dps so that seems reasonable.
---
Yeah, they made the drop rates pretty stupid here.
---
I’m curious as to why that age minimum. Is this like the “18+” guilds that think there’s a magical age that people cease to act certain ways because they had a so many birthdays?
---
Unfortunately, there’s boomers that act like 12yo kids. And there’s zoomers that you’d never expect were.
---
Druid Cat &amp; Bear form Stat Priority.  
---
There seems to be some controversy regarding which stat a druid bear and a druid cat would benefit from the most; Strength vs Agility. I'm leaning toward Agility for both. Does anyone have an opinion on the matter?
---
Thank you?
---
Well yeah, assuming rerolls would stop as soon as factions are balanced.
---
Ah I shouldn’t be so judgy lol
---
Raid progression is to complete the next step in the process. To do something progressively is to increase something in increments.
---
You can gear an alt by raiding progressively. You can level an alt on BFA, get all the dungeon gear, do all the raids and gear up in the order they released which is, to say, in a progressive manner. Increasing in increments from one stage to the next.
---
Of course, I know you don't actually want to do that. My point is that doing so is still a choice that is available to you.
---
I define winning just like the dictionary does lol. I think it actually depends on how you define fun and getting gear. 
---
And thinking about it more, it just makes you realize how good the core of vanilla was but how bad some mechanics were like honour points compared to marks. With honor marks this whole dumbass strategy of quick AV losses would vanish overnight, i'm very interested with what Blizzard will do after the planned phases...
---
Yeah I wouldn't want to stay and wailing caverns too long
---
Elec leg is a main hand if my memory is correct, which is not very good for a 1.7 speed sword. The proc is good however
---
Use everything after revered only.
---
Sounds like you got caught in the middle of the room on a deep breathe. It happens, positioning is one of the most important things to learn as a healer. You gotta keep the heal cast activity high, but also not stand in or near fire. 
---
If you've never seen it before, start of Ony P3 can definitely get crazy quick, especially when tank is trying to re-establish aggro and position Onyxia.
---
If gear is all that matters to you in this game, no, it’s not worth the time.
---
Yikes
---
Nope just had to post on Reddit lol
---
Pretty much all of the specs are viable in BC, to some extent or another. We did cleared up to M'uru with a ret paladin, moonkin, and elemental shaman. I *think* it was when they introduced tier gear for each spec.
---
Man I've tried a couple times to get a group for this with no luck.  It says Raid, but how many Level 60s do I need to beat it?
---
LMAO I can see it in my head
---
Use them at revered. Most repuatations no longer give you rep per kill once youre revered. You normally wait till you hit revered, then turn in the drops.
---
Sulfuras alliance druids respect
---
Thrallmar
---
Why does it look so foggy
---
Ya i've seen this, seems impossible
---
When we first started we used consumables such as fire pots etc to help us (only the first 2 times), but not anymore. They are not needed anymore, instead the big thing seems to be speed without them; getting people to switch specs a bit so we have less heals but more DPS etc.
---
Had a dude in AV yesterday who refused to do anything but stand in mid because someone suggested we send 10 to defend to stall Alliance. He stood in mid and wrote out a complete essay about how we ruined his honor/rep per hour. Everyone just made fun of him but he thought he was educating us somehow.
---
&gt;lots of us actually enjoyed running in a group of 3-5 in leveling zones killing anyone trying to level
---
Maybe some hunting season opener in a very orthodox place? From my first glance earlier, looked like a vast assortment of different bolt action rifles, which makes me lean towards hunting.
---
RIP your neck
---
What fish are bringing in 20g/hr?
---
It's not really about good or bad for leveling, you can level with any talent choice.     
---
Affli is just smoother, basically without stopping to drink/eat. Because you leech life from enemies and mana from your demon (or your health pool which you cover with the selfhealing from Siphon and Drain).    
---
Btw the Demo % increases look huge on paper, but 20% melee damage for demons is barely nothing due to low base dmg of demons. Same for the 30% increase on Lash of Pain, it's actually very small increase (and Lash has 10-12 sec CD).
---
Those people are 13 years too late.  Now everyone just wants to login to grind rep, honor, bis, to log off once they're complete.  So few people now want to play the game to enjoy the fucking game itself.  It's both sad and pathetic.
---
Hell yeah! I've met a bunch of awesome fellow Druids on Sulfuras. Funnily enough when I was spamming Strat UD for the Robes of the Exalted one of the groups I was in was almost all Druids (4/5) and we were all having a good laugh about it.
---
Jesus Christ I've had the same main since BC with 101 exalted reputations as of yesterday and I don't have sentinels done
---
I'm a homey priest and farmed timbermaw rep (and firewater, sells 3g each on my server) for the last week. I just get a few stacks of water, kill 1 at a time. I do the camps in eastern winterfall on the north side of the road. Mobs respawning right as I run back from killing the other camp. I just go back and forth between camps. Make about 30g/hr after selling everything.
---
After you hit revered, the only way to gain rep with Argent Dawn are: Scourgestones, Healthy Dragon Scales, Quests, killing Bosses in Stratholme (undead bosses) and Scholomance, and completing the repeatable quest to neutralize plague cauldrons in WPL. Eventually, when naxx is released and the corresponding scourge invasion event starts, there will be more quests that will also help.
---
To maximize rep gain, save up all scourgestones and healthy dragon scales for after  you hit revered. But even then, I only got around 3k rep from all of them, so be prepared for a long haul.
---
Drek or Kek is hilarious.  I'm fine with losing to such an aptly named strategy.
---
&gt; get all the dungeon gear, 
---
Nope. You’re wrong. The progressive path stops there. That dungeon gear is better than any gear from the first two raids, bar Mythic from the second.
---
On top of that the quest gear from Nazjatar and Mechagon are better as well.
---
Then on top of that world quests will give you better gear.
---
You just keep illustrating that you don’t understand how it works. The progressive path is constantly broken by Blizzard.
---
The choice does not exist. You really don’t get it.
---
🥰
---
Want to see him really rage, go cap Snowfall.
---
Same here. On my priest there isn't much I need from AV, a few things, but on my Mage there is quite a few upgrades, so farming AV is really the best upgrade path for my mage currently.
---
stop doing ketamine
---
Just do Strat until you stop getting rep from the elites in there. (Not bosses they go to exalted) and then use them.
---
Plays overpopulated faction. 
---
Moans about queues.
---
We good. Difficulties of online communication and all that. Thank you for clarifying though. Yeah, I submitted a bug report on it. Something's atypical is definitely going on here -- and while I'm not really concerned about level 9 crocolisks, I wouldn't want to find out that someone can force dozens of Azuregos or something to spawn.
---
Looks good! Ive loved playing wow on my ultrawide monitor, the UI fits so much better!
---
If i was him i wouldve laughed at you for good measure
---
True
---
Omg I want and need that monitor
---
I'm currently spec'd like [THIS](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/01430533010003--505103105305).  (Please notice, that I took healing talents in the Resto tree, and not that other shit).  I'm at +509 healing when I'm in my Fire Resist gear.  
---
I took 2nd in the healing charts while healing Rag in MC in our last raid.
---
My raid team has 5 Druids, (myself included).  Each druid is assigned groups for MoTW and HoT's.  These group assignments go a long way in making your mana last.
---
They managed to kill the priest in time to stop Holy Nova spamming the flag anyway.
---
My name is LFG so I literally can't play wow
---
questie crashed my game yesterday. had to switch to classiccodex. honestly it is better
---
Correct, but asshats will cap SH WHILE SF is in contention.  Alliance that die during this time will spawn at the next available gy, which is SP.
---
Horde gain nothing except a headache by capping SH.
---
Likely dire maul tributes. Maybe jump runs. Google "Dire maul rogue druid duo".
---
Didn't think it would be well received.  Worth a try I guess.  My issue is the quality of the voice chat seems to deteriorate as I play.  By the end of the night, more and more of what my party members are saying is getting cut off at the end, and they usually can't hear me at all by then.
---
This so much. It really is adapting hourly. Meanwhile on our side, I lost less than 10 matches the entire day. Grinded out 21,000 rep  using the same strat with me and my closest 1,000 buddies in a discord. 
---
Gotta give the horde credit for trying new things. I especially enjoyed the fruitless efforts of the few trying to stop us in FOS for a bit. that only lasted a few hours
---
I'm a rogue and I was sitting on the bridge in stealth and knocking people to their deaths with snowballs. Good laughs.
---
Not a bad idea. Probably get some people to bite, who don't care about rep. I'm gonna slowly chip away at it, as I want to hit exalted before naxx releases, of course.
---
Wtf are u doing in ur base!!! 😂
---
You can slur us all you want, but at the end of the day you orcs are just a means to an end.
---
What are some good items I can use the holiday wrapping paper on to troll guildies? I was sad you can't wrap stackable items so I can't send coal :|
---
Are you available every raid?
---
If you can make all the raids and are just sitting in tier 2 because tier 1 is too full, I’d look for another guild that has a space for your class. Keep in mind though that most raids are going to have spares of each class in order to not have to bring pugs in every week, so occasionally sitting out a week isn’t abnormal.
---
If you’re someone who’s only available to make it once a month who’s upset that you can’t roll against the people there every week unless they already have it, then that’s another story. 
---
If you want to be a core raider and there isn’t a spot, then look elsewhere. If you want to be a casual raider who shows up when you can, you have to either accept the fact that any guild with a core raid team isn’t going to give you priority on loot rolls, or find a guild/pug that’s okay with that.
---
Alliance arena bunch of ketchup eaters
---
As a healer, all that really matters on Ony are these things:
---
1. Heal the tank
---
2. Heal the dps
---
3. Phase 1....don't get too far north
---
4. Phase 2....stay in the safe zones for deep breath, but keep range from others as much as possible
---
5. Phase 3....try to avoid being in front of her...otherwise stay as far north as possible without getting hit by her breath...once the fear fades, get back in position
---
People will die on phase 3...it's mostly up to tanks and dps to manage threat effectively.  As a healer...just be where you're supposed to be (NE/NW corners, not on the cracks) and do your job.  If Ony turns and focuses on you, it's mostly the tank not managing threat effectively.
---
Saruman's Uruk-hai were likely orc/man crossbreeds, rather than pure orcs.
---
How do you feel when you see a grown man playing a fidget spinner in 2019? It's pretty cringe right? You kinda wanna tell him "Bro, it's over, no one does that anymore." But you don't, they just go on being their cringy selves. Well on Reddit you can tell people what you think of them without going against social norms.
---
Playing retail wow is cringe, I'm not going to pretend it isn't. It's the fidget spinners of video games.
---
Except that we do know. They stated in the media summit (check youtube for interviews from Tips, Esfand, Quissy, etc) in the summer that they would support the same identical set of paid features as vanilla did, and answered specifically in the context of this question.
---
No, you will not have faction transfers. Yes, you will have realm transfers.
---
Are they're any pugs on your server join them instead, we have a funny loot system to that's really off putting imo for new members
---
You can pick up snowballs in AV for the christmas event. Throwing them at a played causes a knockback. Knocking peeps of bridge is good fun.
---
&gt;  On Horde the queues are 8-10minutes so not really feasible.
---
you are right! xD
---
My Classic main is a mage, so I'm thinking fuck you, I've been rolfstomped an absurd amount of times by stealthy types.
---
My Retail main and Classic alt is kitty, so I'm also fearing the future.
---
It's okay, they're fel-diseased, they're [life unworthy of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_unworthy_of_life)
---
Yo, if we’re In phase three Ony and I’m low on health and mana you best believe I’m still healing the tank right up until I die. I’m at 50% survival rate right now
---
I thought I was being so clever before I found this out.  :(
---
We were killing galv faster all day - they stopped trying to counter in FOS to try and regain the Balinda rep. A hunter sacrificing himself to trap them all the way into Balinda is a good strat too. Or snowballs on the bridge later on
---
3Ds max and photoshop :D
---
Lots of good answers here.  But what I haven't seen is to clarify that a HOTW/NS druid is only good at certain aspects of healing especially in these earlier tiers before the 3 piece t2 bonus is available. 
---
You have a lot of mana, because of the +16% or +20% bonus to int.  And you can easily get 200-300 +heal which scales very nicely with healing touch downranks. 
---
That being said, HT is still a slow cast and so it's really hard to get heals on off tanks or melee DPS that might get hit once or twice butnot die, because other classes (priest, paladin, shaman) all have relatively mana-efficient flash heals or shaman chain heal will almost instantly start affecting non-tanks who take damage. 
---
So your most efficient mana-&gt; HP conversion is healing touch but its too slow to get on targets often.  Where does that leave you?
---
Spamming HT rank 4 on tanks is very mana efficient but only heals about half (or less) of the tanks damage taken from each melee hit.   So once in awhile you might try rank 7 or 8 if oyu know the tank will need a bit more HP.  But it's impossible to "know" that, because if the tank is at half HP and you start a cast, I guarantee 2 or 3 other heals will get flash heals in there or even use their nature's swiftness+heal before your ht lands. 
---
I often will spam rank 4 on tanks and cancel the cast if I need to early in fights.  Often my mana is preserved quite a bit, but then LATER in the fight when the eager beavers are closer to OOM I'm still stacked with mana and can start healing more to supplement.  
---
In 5 mans you can be way more efficient because there's often no other healer, os you can plan it out more =P
---
You can also top people off between pulls with HT4 which often can speed the raid along and help other healers save mana.

Ive been in for about 2 months. Yes people have been in longer, so i cant put in hate for that. But ive gotten in 3 times since i got in, asking for a slot every sat and sunday.
---
Stay away from da Voodoo!
---
No that’s completely different. 
---
You just keep illustrating your lack of understanding.
---
My pre-raid BiS helm is ilvl 57. My shoulders from MC are ilvl 71.
---
The shoulders are better than the helm. They are 14 ilvls higher.
---
A preraid BiS item in BfA is ilvl 400, if you only do dungeons, and skip all of the quests that throw better gear at you.
---
Normal mode for the first raid. Rewards ilvl 355 gear. 45 ilvls below what you have. If you do the current timewalking event, then you could have an item 65 ilvls above that raid content. 
---
Does that help you understand the drastic difference here?
---
It’s like walking into MC with dungeon gear that has been inflated to AQ 40 power levels.
---
It's kind of a balancing act. The more people that force a turtle, the longer that queues become, as well as that the less ally that end up queueing. Because if every game starts going to 25 to 30 mins, queues are going to become even longer.
---
stupid horde doesnt realize their queues will only increase the longer they keep alliance tied up in stupid turtles where both sides get less than 3k honor no matter who wins or loses.
---
We trolls be da best mon! :3
---
I see a lot of people saying join your friend and if you're playing wow to specifically play with this person then I agree, but if you're playing wow to progress in a vast game and make your own way while enjoying your friend's company, then I encourage you to stay. It will probably be very rewarding to help a guild get up to raiding speed and your buddy has to learn somehow that being an asshole doesn't help, it just means he's acting like an asshole. Maybe your refusing to join him will open his eyes in some small way to how little regard he seems to have for the people around him.
---
That's a borderline scummy loot system that's very clearly designed to funnel the loot into specific individuals whilst still giving the other guys the illusion that they might get some loot. Personally I would rather PUG than go to a guild raid under those conditions. I can't believe they get enough people to form a functional raid like that.
---
If you think those guys are cool and you like playing with them, then you can stay in the guild and just PUG. I would have left already personally.
---
Are low level 10/19 bg enjoyable for someone extremely casual (1h a day)

Yooooo my face is literally getting sore from smiling and laughing. REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

but for real, this poor bastard
---
how bad does hunter damage fall off?
---
At the end of the day, what do you value more? Getting phat l00tz and topping meters? Or do you more highly value having fun with your group?
---
If getting lost and topping meters is your priority then bounce. It's not like your xfering servers or anything. You will still be able to talk and run with some of your guild friends.
---
If having fun is your priority, then are you having fun with them? If you show up every raid night and do well when you able to join, then talk to your class leader or the gm and ask how you can become a core raider.
---
Get out, if the raid wants to segregate people based on whether they are the "in" crowd or not for loot you really do not want to be there.   There is a cascading effect of loot waste in these guilds.   
---
EX: Player receives OEB because he is core raider first, several warriors want OEB but only one allowed to roll, player sees BRE drop and it's better for him, Player receives BRE, player can't dual wield 2h swords, who group sees loot wasted, drama ensues.  
---
This will happen, it's not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. You will see people leave because of it.  It's bullshit and designed to use people to gear a select bunch.
---
That would be awesome, maybe in wow 2.0 :P
---
If you are using hots as a Resto Druid your guild is not very serious about clearing raids quickly. Hots knock buffs off and Can seriously fuck over your dps and tanks knocking off something important.  If your dps and tanks aren’t using full consumes them your advice is okay.
---
The spawn rate for the crocolisks on that river are horrendous. I wonder how this has happened? I can't imagine the crocs would respawn fast enough before the old bodies had disappeared.
---
Definitely seems a little odd.
---
I was in starter zones a couple days ago and saw a few other people.  BGs JUST dropped though so a ton of people are spamming bgs rather than level alts.  This will be the case around the release of any new content phase, often folks will flood to that specific new content and other stuff will be a little underutilized.
---
Idk, probably a lot of twinks, why not just try it out?

Woah that's sick, I'm gonna add that lightheaded add-on to my client.

This was one of the movies along with stepbrothers that me and my friends quoted over and over

Absolutely impossible, because of the one great force on Azeroth nobody even questions. The all powerful force that keeps us constantly warring for their own benefit.

The Spirit Healer Conspiracy runs everything, man.

&gt;mindless grinding is being rewarded over actual skill.
---
Welcome to MMOs.
---
Oh no that's not my problem at all, the tanks can get all the bindings they want. The issue arises when they decide to use up all the guild funds as well. To make Thunderfuey, you will need 10 Elementium bars. To make one elementium bar, you need - 
---
Elementium Ore x 1
---
Arcanite Bar x 10
---
Fiery Core x 1
---
Elemental Flux x 3
---
So in terms of only the Arcanite bars, you would need 100 of them to craft Thunderfury. On my server that would be almost 6000 gold.
---
Reason why Resilience was added in TBC
---
Honestly, the difference between 0/30/21 and a "real" resto spec is pretty small, and definitely not necessary for MC/Ony of all things.
---
IMO, it kinda balances out. A full resto spec gives you -9% mana cost on your heals and +10% healing, whereas HOTW gives you +20% mana, which will provide roughly the same amount of extra healing overall.
---
hahaha i use 3D max and photoshop voodoo magic!
---
Yea im available every sunday. 50/50 on sat. Seems to me that we just have a full comp team, but feels kinda bad leaving for a lack of a spot. When literally every other aspect is fine. I basically wait to hear theres no room, then join s pug afterwords
---
Best way to do it is to get a group and spread out.  I would assume it will get easier after a bit.  Fyi, the rewards are BOE so you can trade or buy the recipe if you need too.
---
What threat meter addon should I use? Currently I have ClassicThreatMeter, but this thing barely works - for example, if a mob resists Feign Death, it shows 0 threat even though the mob still keeps attacking me.
---
lol. I enjoyed the story. : )
---
If you just choose "Update" via Twitch, it's downloading the Retail version and screwing up the Plugins for Details!.  
---
DetailsClassic.1.13.3.187.141 is the correct version to use in Classic at this point.
---
This is why we have the Deathbringer to the Reckoning Paladin. It has been quite hilarious.
---
Druids are pretty much the Rock to mages Scissors in pvp, can't cc us easily and sheep is useless.
---
Snowballs can be used to make enemies pull too many warmasters for a guaranteed wipe! They will spawn at SH GY and have no time to defend or attack again :)
---
Because questing sucks
---
It’s when the raids gets stuck trying to pass certain areas due to a clash, usually on top or near a graveyard so people continually respawn. The opposite would be when the raids just pass each other to rush straight to the commanders, which seems to be the meta.
---
If you were sarcastically asking because it’s uncommon to see a turtle instead of the cancerous rep farm that currently exists, then well played, lol
---
No. It's not there
---
I usually just tap a few times above my guy or below to adjust camera view
---
Mine looked like that 10 years ago, perseverance is the key mon!
---
The guide I use has Hide of the Wild as BiS until AQ40 so I would say it's worth it for sure.
---
Oh cool ! I didn’t know that. Does he drop all possible recipes and schematics or just a random one ?
---
It's not completely different at all. You can still go and do the raid if you want to. The content will be trivialized just as MC is trivialized, but you'll raid progressively all the same. 
---
You seem to think that your alt will struggle through MC and that it'll give some sense of satisfaction. Your main didn't struggle through MC so I don't know why you think that would be true. It's all trivial, and all a waste of time, what matters is experiencing the content how you want to experience it.
---
Or, at least, how you claim you want to experience it.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ebhldc/wsg_3039_bracket/). 
---
Seems quite odd to me. So essentially your guild has 80 slots (two raids) that are \*basically\* hard-filled by core raiders and the GM/officers/etc? And this leaves yourself and other T2 members (and the T3 members) unable to join, because these 80 slots always get filled by T1 only?
---
My guild, for example, has 2 raids but we usually hover around 36-38 people per raid and are always looking to expand.
---
I'd examine your options and, again, discuss with someone higher up in the guild. Determine how likely it is (just ask them to be brutally honest) that you get a guaranteed raid spot SOON, and if you don't like the answer, start searching for other good alternative guilds to join.
---
Lol they literally have a button to "join as group" in WSG. How is that abusing game mechanics?
---
I'm sure there are all sorts of bots that are on most of the time, and don't ever make it to 60
---
I ripped the duct tape off as hard and fast as I could and no lifed it. Some games were fun most were forgettable

Phase 1 - "stop grinding dungeons"

Phase 2 - " stop zerg farming honor"

Phase 3 - "stop premades"
---
Hey reddit, shut the fuck up
---
Even so, rejuv should only be used on tanks because any raid damage is going to be quickly sniped by paladins/priests.
---
Only if theve been looted

Was doing this yesterday. I don't think I've actually laughed out loud at anything in the game for a while before this.

Rated BGs: fuck yea but only for titles not gear. Don’t change classic systems too much. 
---
Achievements? Fck no
---
This is the case on the US side too. We have an xrealm discord going and it results in 8-12min wins @ 3k honor
---
Get back to me when your guild is wasting raid nights on MC, BWL, Onyxia, and 20 man raids when you're farming AQ40 and Naxx.
---
&gt; in these longer fights 9% on moonglow is going to get you more casts than 20% int.
---
The problem is that the only "longer fight" in this raid tier is Rag, and even then, it's only "long" if your DPS sucks and you get a submerge.
---
Ah I use a different stat sheet addon that looks more like the TBC interface. When I used one with a pop out next to the character sheet It didn’t seem to be very accurate

Oh wow, 20 whole minutes? MINUTES? The ones made up of Sixty Seconds?!??
---
It just sucks how little content there is for a pve player in p1-2 in classic. Tbc and wotlk were way more fun for me imho.
---
For no queue, sure, but with a queue, then yeah, horde benefits from longer games.
---
If you gotta wait 15 minutes either way, getting a bit more honor in a longer game starts to look better. Average honor/hour overall starts to reward turtles. Or at least, the 20 minute games people call turtles nowadays. All day games are dead and gone.
---
Tanks can easily farm DM:E with 1 paladin, you just need a few professions  
---
engineering - bomb the adds on last boss / shadow reflector second
---
mining - arcane crystals / thorium / dense stone
---
herbalism - pick the flowers along the way
---
enchanting is optional but can turn the 1g items into \~2g  
---
We make 40-60g/hr and are at the point we have to slow down because we hit the instance reset cap with 2.

Being fury/prot makes this very very easy.

Every party needs a pooper that's why we invited you, party pooper, party pooper.

Rofl. You should use consumables no matter what loot system your guild uses. Other systems just reward people who get carried. It's not a vague promise, loot will drop, and people will get it. If you want something, you can communicate that, and if you even remotely come close to pulling your weight, you'll get it! The only way there's a problem is if you actually are an entitled manchild, and you feel like you deserve everything you want FIRST, and are going to complain and cry if someone you perceive to be less deserving gets something you want before you. 
---
At the end of the day it's a system that's dependant on good people with good attitudes. Work on yours lol
---
to expand on this a bit, if you are using a cloud service and don't own the hardware blizzard would see you possibly log in from one state and in a short amount of time logging in a fully different location. If you are using it to control the same computer you always play on it would never really get flagged

I don't think you need it on cheapshot, it will automatically start attacking anyway.
---
Gouge will also automatically stop attack.

Habit. Can relate as a fellow tank lol

Phase 1 is fight start. Dying here means you had bad positioning or a bad DPS pulled aggro and flamebreathed everyone. 
---
Phase 2 is when she is in the air. Dying here is usually too many people in one spot and all getting fireballed repeatedly or if the fight is going slow, a deep breath hit them which all comes down to bad positioning. 
---
Phase 3 starts when she lands. The threat table is all messy because of how her fireballs clear threat in phase 2 and if a tank can't grab aggro fast and the DPS doesn't run to the tank spot, you can end up with a bunch of people flamebreathed or swiped into whelps. The start of phase 3 is where I'd say most wipes happen because of the free roaming Ony in the raid. Otherwise, you can take a bunch of damage from the fire in the cracks if you don't keep your health up (going into phase 3 with less than ~1600 can get you killed on them).
---
I wouldn't feel bad for dying on phase 3 though. There's a lot happening once she lands if you aren't used to it. But I've seen people die in the first 10 seconds of the fight by standing too far forward and eating the first flamebreath. Or wiping the raid by pulling aggro in phase one and breathing/swiping half the raid.
---
If you're down to listen to a lot, I've been fond of Nobbel87

I think the undead should have been a third faction unaligned like goblins.   
---
Most if not all their horde "allies" mistrust them severely and its pretty painfully obvious in your first quests that they want to wipe out all life on Azeroth...

I just love to troll those guys. Suggesting completely bonkers strategies just to watch them blow up is delightful.

&lt;Lords of Havoc&gt; is currently opening enrollment for a few more DPS members and Healers. 
---
We are an active “Progression Guild”  in the sense that when we like to have fun and joke around, but we expect members to be prepared for any raid they attend.    We understand people have lives and do not require you to make every single raid, and we understand sometimes you might need to roll in a little late.
---
We raid Sunday, Tuesday Wednesday 9:00pm Server - 12:00am Server
---
We are 10/10 in MC and Ony on Farm.
---
We have many members who enjoy helping players lvl or get their BIS gear, PVP (Battlegrounds, Twink, open world), or grouping up to farm mats.
---
If you are interested please reach out to me or any Lords of Havoc member for an invite
---
Yea I got to rank 8 first two weeks of wpvp but after seeing the av grind this week I got burnt out after I got exalted and I gave up on chasing rank 12-13 for the armor when in a couple of months it won’t even be any good.
---
&gt;with enough money to support several generations
---
What do you think I am, a mage?
---
Bro it’s a 15 yr old raid, lighten up
---
Eh there always was speed grinders m8. We simply see them more now because their more vocal (and prob have a few more in their number, but nothing insane). Play the game how you enjoy it, find likeminded people (always a challenge, regardless of wishes or year) and ignore all the meta maniacs.
---
where is it you start to learn about them btw? I saw them in I wanna say ferlas but could be wrong, and I get the quest thats like OHH THOSE GUYS R BAD.  
---
but then I start my lock alt and realize the first RFC quests I get are from the leader of the grimtotems who is sitting in TB....  
---
wtf?
---
My role as a Mage is DPS. I provide DPS. The healers role is healer. They provide healing. That tanks role is tank. They provide tanking. Creating and passing out food and water is a luxury. If we are part of a raid group, dungeon group, farming group, world pvp group, WSG premade - you get water for free from me. If we are part of a solo que AV, you are on your own in getting water because I don't feel like spending my time in between ques making stacks and stacks of water for cross realm PUGs.
---
As a warlock I would be 100% okay with the gbank paying for it.  It's an amazing threat weapon.
---
They are fools, that's what they are. Any sensible leader would've exterminated these marauding, demon-juiced alien invaders after their defeat. To be left alive, even as slaves and playthings in concentration camps, was an unparalleled display of mercy they did not deserve after what they had done. Alliance being nothing more than incompetent idiots has been proven again and again.
---
Man this is awesome, would work great if my priest could live...
---
Hey what raid frames are those! Been wanting to ask someone this question for awhile.
---
you guys have actual friends?
---
I honestly disagree that "it was always like this".  Neither of us really have any information beyond distant memories so no point to argue.  
---
Either way in its current state, theres absolutely no reason to queue WSG unless you're in a full premade, which I think is a problem.  AV gives too much honor and WSG not nearly enough.
---
NOT MY PRESIDENT.  
---
Kidding kidding lets not bring politics in =P
---
&gt; Serious question what are you gonna do when you get the gear? 
---
That's a problem for the future. For some people, having a goal and working towards it while improving ones own efficiency is what drives them. Then once they reach a goal, they are free to set a new one.
---
Obviously not. But that's part of the whole deal with the Crusade: They're blind to anything but killing people not wearing scarlet. 
---
Maybe you haven't played forsaken, but their story in vanilla is pretty damned interesting, and there's definitely distinction between them and the scourge. Imo, the forsaken's story-line is the best in the horde by a mile, and only comes in second overall because the human story-line is just (a) so damn good and (b) so directly tied up with one of the most iconic end-game bosses.
---
The good alliance players already switched to wsg premade for honor
---
Ya the trade off is being fed gear.
---
Guild split after looking at raid logs. Found out our mt only ever used sunder armor/shield bash the entire raid. All this after we funneled all the tanking lot to him since we started raiding. We do loot council so a lot of the geared people that raised since day 1 are split and now I'm salty I passed on stuff for people who left.
---
Honestly, longer games are healthier for everyone.  The 10 and under minute games were shitty for everyone.  Sure it was a fast rep grind but it wasn't fun and it certainly wasn't pvp.
---
AV needs to be a longer game, 20-40 minutes and it is trending that direction.  This is why queues are lengthening for players, not because people got their rep and left.  The people who got rep are probably also honor grinding, which means they will still be playing a lot.  But the key is that they will be shifting from pure rep grinding in AV to honor grinding in general.  This results in a more balanced honor per hour between AV and WSG, if you can hit groups that aren't practiced and coordinated premades.
---
Maybe I'm just facing some bad locks, but I've never lost a 1v1 to a lock, and I'm rank 7 with 16k HK's.  There was this one SL lock that popped a greater frost protection pot during the fight, and i killed him right before i died, so i still got honor, so maybe that one counts.
---
Except Forti, fuck Forti.
---
PvE has an endgame. Once you're done it's over!
---
This really depends on you, but I had some questions I thought of when reading your post. 
---
Are there set criteria for moving between tiers T3 -&gt; T2 -&gt; T1.  I'm guessing T3 to T2 is probably just time and attending a certain number of raids. But what about T2 to T1?  If that's just up to officer discretion then I'd probably leave. 
---
However, are you actively participating in your guild?  Or is guild chat just another LFG channel / showing up on raid night to see if you get a slot? Are you farming mats and consumes, or just out farming gold / rolling alts? Are you helping guildies farm bis/attunes?
---
Last - with 2 raid groups running, how many other warlocks are there?  Are you really saying your guild has 80 people that show up for raids almost every night that you aren't getting a consistent spot?  Are you able to make all raid days, or is your attendance less?
---
Are those Dreadmare?  
---
They drop:

Poor guy
---
Whole grain mustard is where its at.
---
I mostly raid log because I can only do so much of one game at a time, and I want to play other games right now.
---
It's about the rep. In a standard alliance rush victory, I sit in queue for 10mins, then lose in 8mins for roughly 200 honor in ~20mins. If I "turtle", i.e. actually play the game instead of just riding to belinda and spamming shadowbolts until she dies, then killing a few more commanders and lieutenants with 0 pvp, the calculation looks different. I sit in queue for 10 minutes, then spend usually 20-30 minutes pvping until Horde usually wins, gaining additional turn-in and winning rep for a total of at least 800 rep, usually more around 1000.
---
Rolling over: 10 rep/min and boredom, with even longer queues once all alliance quickly gets exalted. Actually doing pvp: 25 rep/min, excitement and rewarding gameplay and delaying queue length growth.
---
I kept telling him my rep and honor per hour were off the charts and he was getting mad.
---
What kind of no-life loser bullshit is this? People like these guys need to be banned from WoW AND public spaces in the real world. Goddamn cockroaches.
---
Where did you end up grinding for the golden pearls?
---
Sure, but with that logic you shouldn't be capping SH untill Snowfall has been fully taken over.
---
At least it's not skinning a future alliance race like we do to the duskwood worgen...
---
No it's not.
---
Well, on one side, we have people like you. On the other side, we have people who cry, whine, arrange a mass transfer to fk up their server then cry even more.
---
Exactly.  It's very easy (relatively speaking) to die at the start of P3 Onyxia when it is not your fault.  Between wonky threat drops in P2, DPS potentially being overzealous, and bad fear RNG, there are several ways to find yourself and several other very dead from fire breath.  Bad luck with the fire fissures during the fear can also end you if you manage to take damage from them twice, which isn't all that uncommon in my experience.
---
It is not part of a Mage's role. Their role is DPS. Also, it takes way more time and clicking that you are making it out to be. I do chores or random shit while I sit in queue. You aren't entitled to my water, or to my time and energy it takes to make it.
---
I don't think there's a right or wrong answer here. You'll want a balance of +healing, mana, and mana regen.  For example, I'm BiS with a +healing around 545, 5100ish mana unbuffed, something like 25 or 30 MP/5, and not even sure how much stamina I have.  I seem to have less mana than some similarly geared raiders, but a little more +healing. Not sure which heals or ranks others in my raid use, but meters show that I have top 3 raw healing output with usually bottom 3-4 overhealing (so, efficient healing by me).  I played around with healing ranks in 5 mans with guildies to find what I liked for output and longevity, and it seems to have translated into raid healing fairly well.  Following a BiS list will likely focus on +healing as main stat, but there's pieces that can be swapped for more int or MP5 if those stats are lacking.
---
Whoa that's interesting, clever, cool, rude, and ballsy. I do wonder if it's allowable - threatening to grief players unless they meet your demands cross-faction. Either kill them Alliance or don't, but maybe don't draw them into debt agreements in order for them to play.

You can download an Authenticator off the blizzard website. Basically it’s an app for your phone that will send you a temporary code which you will use to verify it’s really you when you’re logging into wow on your computer. 
---
I use a vpn so it’s similar to jumping around the world in seconds which means I sometimes have to use that.

I cant imagine that wide of a screen is useful or comfortable.. could u tell how u experience it? Is it stretched out or like a bigscreen and then just cut in half on the vertical bit or..?
---
You do realize it takes 5 minutes for a cap to turn to your team, right? So if someone caps SH right away (which is usually what people are referring to in their complaints), capping Snow Fall is completely irrelevant.
---
Also curious where
---
I play on us server, but I am Russian. It is sad to see eu treating Russian player as lesser. Us players have to deal with random bouts of Spanish.
---
This is a bit like asking why someone's in a hurry to get to a restaurant. They don't have an "end game" in mind, they're not eating a fancy meal for any particular purpose, it's just an enjoyable experience to have. The effort required to have that experience isn't unpleasant, but it's also not particularly interesting; the meal itself is the point, not the car ride to get there. WoW is much the same. Gear isn't obtained so that you can play the game, getting gear *is* the game. You can enjoy it for other reasons, of course, but WoW is designed around loot being the primary dopamine hit.

Kromcrush had some drama about a guild killing Azuregos, got the tag, then the loot master died at 15, another guild tagged the boss, when the boss died the loot was only lootable by the 2nd party who hit the boss a couple times.
---
This isn't at all viable until BC. Sorry
---
Heh, yeah arguing about lore always breaks down to this. After every crushing defeat, you always have enough troops to make the next battle exciting and competitive.
---
You could try Old Blanchy. Its decently populated, Westcoast. Currently its 58% alli 42% horde so relatively balanced. The horde side does a pretty good job of coordinating to be competitive with the alli side. I play on horde and do some pvp when they get going. So far its been pretty fun.
---
Yes they did and out of the classes listed here dps warrior is worst off.
---
Winners in tbc are hunters, locks and enhancement shammies
---
Warriors are in a rough shape

---
Yeah its great, It's not on twitch for some reason but I was able to find it here.  You have to install it the old fashioned way.  You have to download the v11302 zip from here.  That's the only one that I know for a fact works on classic!

#dontassumemyclass???
---
Sweet, I am going to try it when I get home. I love grid, but am always looking to try new addons. As far as not wanting to touch an already working setup, you just uncheck the box, try the new thing (In AV) and if you do not like it uninstall and recheck the old addon. 
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
Clearing Rag 4 mobths later is hardly a measure of success. You will hold your guild back at every step of the way so that you can be a special snowflake prot pala shitter
---
No clue why u got downvoted.
---
Well yeah you can't expect much from a PUG. It really is night and day. Unless the horde send over half their team to camp at the FW keep entrance... their chance of winning is super low against a premade. I'm not even trying to honor rank high and I avoid straight up premades like the plague
---
I’ve played 20+ hours the last three days and love it lol not sure what you’re asking about the stretch
---
&gt; The content will be trivialized just as MC is trivialized, but you'll raid progressively all the same.
---
Nope. Completely different. Look at those numbers again. If you played BfA you’d know that any content you outgear by that amount, just falls over.
---
You walk in, ignore mechanics, and it dies.
---
That’s not how MC works, in pre-raid BiS, if you’ve never been there before, and aren’t abusing world buffs, flasks, etc.
---
&gt;You seem to think that your alt will struggle through MC and that it'll give some sense of satisfaction. Your main didn't struggle through MC so I don't know why you think that would be true. It's all trivial, and all a waste of time, what matters is experiencing the content how you want to experience it.
---
Damn dude, this is like the fourth or fifth time in this conversation when you literally are just making shit up. I never mentioned an alt. Can you maybe stick to the actual conversation we’re having and not just make shit up?
---
As an aside I progressively raided in Legion. I get you haven’t played, despite claiming to, so I’ll explain in depth, but there was a lot of incentive in Legion to do old content.
---
Legion had a questline called “Balance of Power” that provided a special set of skins for your artifact weapon. Part of that massive questline was 2+ weeks of farming the first two raids in the expansion. 
---
So you always find groups for those raids, back then, because provided an incentive.
---
Granted, you could not experience them in any meaningful progressive manner, by the time I got back to Legion in 7.2.5. You’d join a group, you’d all outgear the fights, and you’d just Zerg the whole place down.
---
As a result I often didn’t know those fights until I later tried to do them on Mythic. Where the mechanics actually would still have teeth. 
---
Legion also had three other major things that kept old content alive:
---
1) Tier sets still existed, set bonuses were often quite good, and it could all titanforge. So even hardcore Mythic raiders would go back and do old content, to fish for tier, and titanforged tier.
---
2) Legendaries in Legion had this weird built in catch up mechanic, where essentially, you’d increase your chance of getting one, by killing certain things. Raids bosses were on that list. By 7.2.5, you could reasonably expect to get a legendary every two weeks if you cleared all raids and Mythic 0s, in that time.
---
3) Legion gear looked great. So people would do old content for transmog.
---
BfA lacks those entirely. It’s old content is dead as a result.
---
50 DKP MINUS!
---
Read the lore. You will find out the alliance are way worse. Forsaken aside.
---
Just because you don't know how to maximize your chances of winning effectively in AV doesn't mean your little anecdote proves anything.
---
How do you know somebody plays on Sulfuras? Don't worry, they'll tell you they play on Sulfuras!
---
No, it's just not possible.  Even if you queue at the same time, you get different AVs.
---
So for the 98% of raids that don't farm every buff it's fine and for the ones that do who 4 heal it with no resto druids it's fine.
---
Sure. But not that many pieces of them. And they're not \*that\* much better. I'm just ignoring rank14 gear as if it didn't exist. It's fine. I'll still be able to tank literally everything in game.
---
This is a valuable lesson in the value of an item not necessarily being what it is POSTED for on the AH.
---
I'm azuresong horde too! What's your IGN?
---
Newp
---
... but tranquility is trash in Vanilla?
---
Yea it became very apparent today that the long queues are mostly to blame for this behavior.  Otherwise it would be purely psychotic.
---
I think people missed the Humor / Meme tag.
---
&gt; I honestly disagree that "it was always like this". Neither of us really have any information beyond distant memories so no point to argue.
---
That's fair. Just saying that the memory of getting into BGs and rolling my eyes because the enemy is damn near already camping the GY are strong and persistent lmao. 
---
And I am definitely with you about pre-mades in general, I've always been a little annoyed by how ubiquitous they are because sometimes you just wanna be able to solo queue a few casual BGs. But there's just not much to be done unless Blizzard were to implement a pre-made and non-pre-made queue. And even then I suspect the honor farmers would work hard to find an exploit like the folks queuing AV together.
---
I dont think i used tranquility once.. its only partymembers not raidmembers.
---
Lowlevel pvp is very imbalanced (even more than max level) since many classes lack key abilities to make them viable in pvp. Lowlevel bgs will also have a lot of decked out BG twinks that will destroy any normal character.
---
You can still have fun there but dont expect fair fights.
---
T3 -&gt; T2  is participation. T1 is class leader discresion. Both raid teams have 5 locks ea. Some of the people run alts for both days. Ive only ran the raid with them 3 times, i always make sure im available sunday. Wait till i hear there is no room, then join a pug. Sat is 50/50 whether im available, so i dont blame for the sat group
---
The classic bear cap. Only slightly inferior to the all mighty kodo cap.
---
There are 3 furblong dudes that patrol winterspring, and the other day a mage was killing them where they spawn, then drinking and before he finished drinking, all 3 would respawn again. He had a huge pile of the things gathered when I stopped by to watch. Something was definitely up with the respawn/despawn of the things. Could be a similar thing happening here!
---
It’s really not hard to hit buff cap relatively casually especially on classes that have self buffs that proc. Most serious raid guilds expect dm buffs, drop only head, and expect everyone to be fully on consumes. I am obviously not talking about a bunch of scrub noobs.
---
Thats when you strike a deal, sapper bomb them and engage all the rogues in your guild to farm some poor sod 24/7
---
Warlock, didn't take a fireball on Ony P2 despite absolutely bombing, I wanded in P3 about 10 times (and not exaggerating) to make sure I didn't pull threat since I'm sure I was near the top anyway, then my first shadowbolt crit, pull aggro and she breathed on the raid.  :(
---
Is your field of view actually wider or is your vertical view just cut in half (thats what it looks like on SS)?
---
*literally no one
---
&gt;UC is the best horde city
---
Ah I see you never played a Tauren?
---
Four Horsemen is about where I think the hard stop is for pugs and stuff. There's a lot in this game you can eventually get sorted well enough to mostly halfass, but that fight is cancer if people are not on the ball and appropriately geared.
---
Excellent work!
---
Thanks, ill guess classis is no longer for me
---
On a crip kite, to guarantee a disarm, absolutely.
---
Who the hell plays with the profanity filter on?  Savages!
---
I’m on the largest PvP-West server, I’m already exalted with AV so I wanted to run UD strat for my black Barron cloak, took me 45 min to find 3 dps.
---
Found the tryhard honor farmer.
---
Any suggestions for what my stable should look like as a Hunter (currently lvl 52)? When I first started I got a bear in Elwynn at level 12 and because I was new to WoW I watched some hunter guides but was generally confused about the pet stuff and since my bear was working out fine I never felt the need to find anything different. Then the other day during a dungeon run someone asked me if I had a pet that was more dps and less tank and said it's generally a good idea to do dungeons with a damage-heavy pet instead of a tanky one. So I started doing research again and realized a few things. First that I totally forgot to get Broken Tooth and second that I had left my claw and bite attacks at rank 2 because I forgot I had to tame other pets to learn the higher ranks so I could teach them to my bear.
---
So anyway I went out and got the higher ranks for those two attacks and then camped the Badlands until I got BT last night. So now I have BT for one pet, and a tanky bear for the other. I still have one stable slot open and while I'm probably going to go tame a couple more creatures to learn the abilities I don't have yet, it won't be long before I'm ready to find my third long-term pet. What should I be looking to fill my last stable slot with?
---
I bought them all off the AH - they were going for 20g apiece on my server.
---
Oh ok, tbh i havent played in a while so thats my bad
---
I intend to use the gear for PVE and other PVP events that aren't some isolated PVE/PVP hybrid bullshit.
---
If you look at the bonus honor, win or lose, horde always come out on top.  This is because, unlike the alliance, we (generally) always kill Bal and all of the LT, after we have done that we have basically already "won". The objective at this point is the make the game end as fast as possible to do it again.
---
AV is not a PVP encounter... its a PVE/PVP hybrid, it can be fun, but once you have completed most of the PVE content in it, and all that remains is the last boss, there is not much gain to be had, and everyone is better off with it just ending.
---
Yes, if executed properly, some def will snipe a win in a clutch situation.... feels good when it happens right. But half of the enemy isn't a fucking computer in AV... The other team will just adapt and use the same D strats against you. This leads to a stalemate, leads to no honor or rep, leads to long ass queue times, leads to long ranting posts on reddit...
---
We have a good thing going, Ali gets wins and instant queues, horde gets more rep and honor per hour. IMO when the computer is half the battle here, it's kinda selfish to try to get it all.
---
Our other Resto Druid uses it a few times a raid and I always hear people in discord going “Nice tranquility good job” or something along those lines. It’s like, 5% of his healing since his group is likely not next to him not necessarily needs heals and he can’t heal anybody else the entire duration of tranquility. It also costs tons of mana. It’s really bad lol
---
 So basically you want Blizzard to force you to do old content, which is my other point?
---
I have never seen someone agree with me so violently.
---
You know. In cataclysm. I ran a max-member guild. 1000 people. Removed 1month inactives in order to add more people, regularly. 40-70 people always online. As the GM. We were progression ladder. But not top clear. 
---
One thing I did as GM, was use my ability to broadcast to a large player base that I would buy all green, blues, at base line rates. As CoD. I got hundreds of items mailed to me every couple days. I bought them all. And I turned around and either DE, resold, or used those items. I made an absolute killing. In cata, the 4000g for flying level 2 training was considered the current trending goal. I had well over 50k gold. And another 20k in the guild bank. 
---
Sure. I made a lot of cash and was flush. But you know what else I did?
---
Our two raid teams (am&amp;pm groups, 25&amp;10) had ALL their personal repairs paid for regardless of number of wipes, by the guild bank. All potions and food were provided for to all raid members for free. Members who donated potions and food to raid team where tipped/payed well. Interest free loans were given to trusted members. Raid members were gifted faster flying training. And countless other generous gestures. Not to mention each rank of the guild received a differing salary that they could take out of the guild bank each week for being an upstanding guild member. (Although a lot didn’t). 
---
Just goes to show that one can profit in a position of power, but you also need to give back to your own community to show appreciation.
---
Whats kills me is that they think people want to win for better honor, so they have to explain the math and correct evreyone on the proper way to play.  We get the math we just don't like to lose on purpose.  Not everyone is grinding ranks.
---
It's already happening with an xrealm discord. Why on earth Blizzard is using this version of AV and not allowing raid group invites is beyond me and a lot of other people.
---
The game should honestly require you to cap the two forward towers before Van/Drek can even spawn. 
---
Discord has changed the game for how players can communicate. Yesterday afternoon xrealm premades had a pool of over 1,000 players. We had 26 channels going at full capacity all day cycling through matches being fed from one call out channel. 
---
It's only going to get more prolific
---
But you can stomp, cast roots. then put a natures grasp on to root them again when they intercept
---
no. idk what that word even means
---
Yes!  This is what we all asked...  🤣
---
I’m starting to feel more and more that people don’t like alts as much as they do on retail, which is shocking because alts are arguable more accessible in classic right now than they are in retail. I never played private servers so maybe I’m just not tired of it yet but I have a 60 and 5 characters from 20-40 and none of it feels stale.
---
Owl I think
---
What's your point?
---
I started my rep grind yesterday aid have been having a ton of fun in AV. Thought I'd hate it, too.
---
Love VUH Du  but  having trouble disabling auto dispel and tracking debuffs leaves much to be desired as it doesn’t show an icon to tell me what’s afflicting the particular player.
---
&gt;It is easy to understand why so many of my contemporaries prefer to let this history die. Let it sink into oblivion silently, slipping
---
beneath the waters of time until the surface of the lake is once again unruffled, and no one knows of the shame lurking in the
---
depths. I, too, feel that shame, though I was not alive when this occurred. I see it in Drek'Thar's face as he recounts his part of the
---
tale in a shaking voice. I saw the weight of it on Orgrim Doomhammer. Grom Hellscream, friend and traitor and friend again, was ravaged by it.
---
&gt;But to pretend it did not exist is to forget how dreadful the impact was. To make ourselves into victims, rather than claiming our
---
participation in our own destruction. We chose this path, we orcs. We chose it right up until it was too late to turn back. And
---
having made that choice once, we can, with the knowledge that we have of the end of that dark and shameful road, choose not to
---
take it.
---
&gt;So I wish to hear the testimony of those who placed one foot in front of the other on a road that spelled near obliteration of our
---
kind. I want to understand why they took each step, what had to happen for it to seem logical and good and right.
---
I want to know this so when I see it unfolding again, I will recognize it.
---
Humans have two sayings that are wise beyond imagining.
---
&gt;The first is, "Those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it."
---
&gt;And the second is . . . "Know your enemy."

-Thrall, Rise of the Horde, Chapter 9
---
Yea non-elitist guilds will have a few people pushing DPS like that, like I said, good luck having a raid full of them by the time those types of guilds hit Naxx.
---
I mean....That's just how thunderfurys work. It goes to the main tank and then the off tank. It is the best threat weapon for both AoE and single target in the game.
---
Yikes those tongue/teeth/mouth sounds..
---
That’s not what I’m doing, and again, you’re basically just making shit up. Can’t continue this since you aren’t actually discussing this with me, and are instead talking to yourself. 
---
Take care man, god bless anyone that has to deal with you irl.
---
There's a link in the description of his video.
---
Oh man you’re dumb
---
In our raids: Druids, Warlocks, and Hunters.
---
We're always short of them. 
---
We also have too many prot warriors, though we're getting a decent amount of fury finally (4).
---
Depends on how many times your team loses. My record is about 80% loss so far.
---
Not a victim complex. This MC thing has never happened to me so I’m not defending myself or offended or anything. I just think people who do it are assholes. That’s about it.
---
You sound like you’re frustrated that premades exist and use that to justify people MCing players out of WSG.
---

---
The bracket / rp chart is incorrect
---
The calculator also looks like it is based on a fixed weekly rp, which is an odd way to track ranking progress. I made a spreadsheet and use the weekly rp value via Honorspy to calculate both “bracket needed to overcome decay” and “bracket needed to rank up”. This is more valuable to someone pvping and tracking progress imo
---
Thanks, that's one I've been considering since I've heard screech is a pretty useful ability. Plus owls look real cool.
---
Adibags is a gamechanger, especially as someone that never has been organized with my bags and what goas where in them. It does it for me magically. Glorious
---
I think no priority as you can farm eye of shadow in no time.. but some guild members (officers/leadership) should be gung-ho to farm them as they drop.. that's what my guild does, 5 man farm team and we haven't been there more than an hour.
---
think of it as a filter.
---
if you can't figure out how to queue just because someone is sitting on the quartermaster... we don't really want you in BGs anyway.
---
It's possible to queue though.
---
Just because its well written =/= to doing the same horrible shit that the original undead horde did. I have played it, and for the most part the forsaken run around claiming to not be the undead horde that arthas controls, while doing the very same things the undead horde under arthas does. At least there is a lot of Slyvanus present the right hand to people while doing shadowy shit with her left hand behind her back.
---
So you are right, the nameless unrepresented undead NPCs we don't really get to see often just want to be left alone. While the representative of their race and people in power just keep waging war and committing atrocities. So for the part of the game's story that matter, the undead are effectively the same as the forsaken.
---
Note I'm not trying to defend the sacrlett crusade. But we also can't pretend the Forsaken arn't horrible terrible monsters, generally as a group. Sure an npc here or there might mention that Forsaken just want peace. But that's not what gets shown to the players of either faction.
---
No I love Warriors :D my first 60 ever in vanilla was an Orc Warrior actually. Just saying it’s not really shitting over Mages if you’re using reck, fap and have two healers helping you :P
---
Get two birds stoned at once. If you run Strat Live for the gold needed to buy the mats for Hide of the Wild, you might get lucky and score the Archivists Cloak of Healing. That is perfectly good enough if you don't try to min-max the absolute best items for every slot.
---
it does have its draw backs.  Other methods can be worse though.
---
How so? This whole thread is a testament to how far more players are in AV than WSG and his comment is just reaffirming that just like every other comment on this and every other post on the topic.
---
Lol well get used to OK because that's by far one of our most common words/expressions!
---
What's the best weapon options for an Orc Warrior tank in BWL? I've done some research and as far as I can tell it would be Crul'shorukh Edge of Chaos, and a close 2nd would be Deathbringer, but I'm not sure if I should aim for a faster weapon instead.
---
Well spoken, thank you for responding in a non antagonistic way. Im not knocking anyone just confused, I just want the best for my faction and this game
---
Wish we had achievs and Barber shop.
---
Achievs up to LK level i mean... I stoped playing in MOP so i have no idea how it is in Retail right now.
---
I’ve never actually seen the AV battle master on my server. There’s always 100 people on them. 
---
Make a target macro and bind your interact key.
---
I dislike achievements because they are just lazily implemented quests or other content to me. You don't need an additional intrusive system that tells people everything you have done. If you have exalted with AV for instance, others can see your mount/gear and there doesn't need to be a popout that tells you that you got it. Exploring the whole world could easily be a quest from some adventurer in a major city that wants to make a map of the world.
---
I agree that a lot of content is underutilized, but I don't think achievements are in any way in the spirit of Vanilla to fix that problem.
---
It seems like theres some sort of error with the despawn time. I did this quest the other day on an alt and even after looting, they weren't despawning
---
hmm? bash a party member?
---
What is a raidlogger ?
---
Because most tanks are warriors, and so they can only go fury.
---
Also nobody raids with a prot pally, we're like the only guild that I know of that consistently does. It's severely gimped, and while our guy is good, he's handicapped by the class, basically everything in MC is tauntable and most of them have taunt mechanics, a prot pally cannot be a main tank in MC because there are too many threat drops and taunt needs. I wish it wern't so, but it is. Our plays as off tank, and I really really would not want our guild to even think about having a second one.

What is a core Felcloth bag?

DAE fuck horde? (+184747292938)
---
BGs yes, achievements no.
---
Achievements are trying telling you how to play the game and min max your time in the game. If you're not working on an achievement you're not playing optimally. 
---
Hence removing them lets you decide what you want to do in a game. You create your own achievements and goals you want to make happen

HPriests can efficiently farm lashers in DM:East for 20-40g/hr to pay for consumables/epic mount/etc.

You're right about armour and damage values, those were intentionally buffed.

Are you talking about the time where you can't do anything before the gate opens? 
---
I would always ask first myself, but I don't understand the attitude with some mages in groups, particularly if there's down time, about making water.  It's part of your class, and if you can help your party with it why wouldn't you? It would be like me as a paladin charging people for greater blessings/symbol of kings, except that actually costs me something unlike making water.
---
It's an awful DPS weapon due to the proc threat. It should go to tanks and no one else.
---
My patience is thin. Lost Malistar's Defender to a warrior the other day as a resto shaman in Molten Core. Still don't get why he needed it.
---
The Horde slaughtered a peaceful society including women and children, skullfucked their planet until it became uninhabitable, and then came to Azeroth to do the same. The only reason they’re “hunted refugees” is because the Alliance was too merciful to slaughter them all, and instead used their own funds to provide them food and water.
---
and regardless if they did get that poly/kill off a fear is all you need for a hard-cast pet summon

Holy priest in my guild farms mara on a nightly basis, lets just say that his gold count is over 4k...

More complex than a ret pally? Yes.

The forsaken arent murdering peoples pet or experimenting on prisoners for "survival". The quest lines make it pretty clear they just enjoy doing those things.

I've been winning like 70% of my games as horde these past few days.

Feral Druid? Is that some new fangled resto specc for druids?

more like they will spawn at shgy and then run back to defend so you get a 90 min turtle game.

it's not an AV weekend btw
---
Then why do horde players have ques ?
---
Jeez what's the ratio on this? I have a 21:9 that's difficult to play wow on I cant imagine this. Also love the clash figurines
---
Look, sometimes Mages get to take a break from pushing the water button and push the frostbolt button. It's only fair.
---
I don't believe there is any issue with using guild funds to forge Thunderfury(s). Obviously 100% of the costs shouldn't come out of the gbank alone, but a solid majority is fine and actually optimal.
---
The way raiding works is that MT gear and skill is largely more important that any other single role. If the tank's gear or rotation isn't at least above average, the guild will not be able to progress, especially in BWL and later raid tiers. MC is way easier since the mobs and bosses can be taunted. This means that after MC, tanks need as much threat (in the form of damage) that they can get. No Tank Threat == Wipes == No Progression.  
---
The gbank exists to help push raid progression and success, and not much else. TF is 100% a solid investment from the gbank. Hand of Rag is a different story entirely, and yet some guilds still fund that with gbank money just for the prestige of having it.
---
If you're on a pve server rogues are generally the least played class. My guild is having trouble keeping more than 2 rogues active.
---
Same. Now that Horde has changed the meta to play some defense, there have been a lot more wins.

You could solo sfk for BOE's, was doing that on my shammy

Summoning has never been enabled in Classic WoW bg’s - at least not when i started in like late vanilla 1.10ish

I still don’t get whats the point, why didnt the bear just cap the flag then.
---
His acting or his character? Is it his typecast or some other factor you don't like?
---
Paladins get way, way more loot in MC than DPS warriors, the hypothetical retadin is the one denying progression.
---
Why would I not want to manage a cat in raids? I've only ever been in one raid group and we didn't even fight much, just exchanged a few shots with some horde outside South Shore and then everyone got bored and left. Is furious howl better than screech?
---
What’s his name. Tell him he needs to get dm north, songflower and ony buff minimum. Then he needs as many consumes as possible. I use Mongoose, greater arcane intellect potions, flask of supreme power, and roids, but there’s a lot more I’m missing like jujus. If he does all this, he’ll do 500+ dps. He should also be full pre bis. Ony buff is probably the #1 most important ret pally buff in the game.
---
&gt; The orcs were peaceful before the burning legion attacked. 
---
In WoD, the orcs genocide the drenai and invade Azeroth without any demon juice. They seem predisposed to it.
---
Is this guy crying about premades existing?
---
definitely set them on kill lists, follow them around and gank them when solo.  Also gank lowbies to stifle their recruits and gank consumable locations. 
---
Outnumbered servers dictate you follow guerilla tactics lol.
---
I would probably put a few points in Curse of Exhaustion instead of improved life drain, as youg et that from shadow mastery and ur spell power anyways.
---
I just find Curse of Exhastion to be useful a lot of the time when you are chasing or kiting
---
Horde have 12 minute av queues compared to alliance instant ones? Therefore more horde are queuing than alliance. Implies that horde has more players across all realms.

You only feel embarrassed cause you missed everyone else wiping a bunch when guilds we’re getting their first clears. Trust me, we’ve all been there and even the best of us make mistakes. Last night, our top geared priest accidentally stepped to forward casting gear ward. It happens.
---
I didn’t mean that you did.  Just the normal echo chamber of reactions without thought.  
---
It sucks being in that spot.  Hopefully you made some good friends along the way and are able to keep in touch with them and run stuff together.  With a little luck you will be able to find an open spot with the same environment that you like even better.
---
I don't exactly hate him, but he instantly breaks immersion for me in any work of fiction.
---
well then that would mean OP is an idiot....
---
Oh okay, I respect the hussle. Thanks for answering
---
Jfc I remember when I first downloaded.. ahh what was it called.. with the square yellow FPS numbers. Point being, the filesize on those video captures were fuckin immense on the ol 50gb HDD
---
Good, fuck mindlessly afk grinding AV as being the way to rank.
---
Sunken cost fallacy.
---
Starting in a new guild might be better but people are nervous that it will be worse.  Not to mention if you have lots of friends in the guild or have given materials to the guild bank.  They hope their time and energy will pay off, not just wasted on assholes.
---
I'm using the Addon GatherMate2 and it's working fine but when I'm trying to import the GatherMate2\_Data there's nothing shown on my map.. like the import doesn't work at all. Anyone an idea what I can do to fix it?
---
Imagine a knight refusing to use a sword because gunpowder is gonna be bis when he gets it.
---
Personally he breaks immersion for me.
---
It's not people pulling aggro, it's people having leftover threat from phase 1 and 2. The tank gets fireballed during phase 2, so his threat gets reset. Then she fireballs the next highest on the threat list to reset his/her threat, then the third, etc. When she lands in phase 3, she turns to the player who then has the most threat, which is usually a DPS. That DPS might have done zero threat in the last 15 sec and might continue to do zero threat in the next 10 sec, but if he's currently on top of the threat list, she'll go for him.
---
Wpl, circa 2004
---
Ret paladins have piles of gear to choose from in MC.
---
DPS warriors have like 3-4 pieces.
---
In no universe is a ret paladin getting onslaught before warriors fairly.
---
your original post says "You will have to play a dps Warrior until a tank quits". that means you are saying that every tank regardless of class needs to play a dps warrior. therefore paladin and druid tanks will need to level a new character
---
Yup.you can actualy stay non pvp tagged if you dont attack guards as a pve player
---
awesome, appreciate the detailed response! may i ask what your end game talent build is as well? and just curious, with your mana 5100 ish unbuffed, whats your HP after fort? this will just give me a lil idea what your ratio is. thanks!
---
there's a group of 20 tauren that do this for giggles on sulfuras. it's a thing
---
Horde players do more pvp than ally players.
---
Also majority of pvp servers are horde dominated, majority of pve servers are ally dominated.
---
You can either make a reply like the one you did, or something more useful where you tell OP to make a /tar NPCname macro and bind a key for "Interact".
---
Yeah.
---
Looks like small eggs used to make cookies and eggnog for the holiday event. I assume he is farming them for sale.
---
Gun powder was not used like you apparently think it was in the renaissance lolol
---
Its funny how alliances calls it a "turtle" tactic, everytime the Horde wants a pvp fight.
---
How do we call the alliance tactic of avoiding every pvp contact? Ah, ye PVE Racers!
---
 horde have superior pvp trait which make it much easier to defend with fewer number
---
I saw multiple invasions during vanilla.  While I was in a zone like Azshara or Un'goro, you'll see a named elemental yell something throughout the zone.  That means the invasion has begun.  It just spawns different mobs of the same elemental type indigenous to the area, except they have a higher drop rate for elementals and essences.  Then there is an elite mob and it drops loot like a rare would.   If you're in a zone and see a zone-wide yell, make a beeline for the elemental area and kill as many as you can ASAP for the drops.
---
Except that the old dismount hut doesn't dismount anymore. :/
---
Wonder why
---
If you do it correctly,  you can have everyone summoned in a minute or two and be inside the raid before they even realize what is going on.
---
They must take hours to clear MC now.
---
I mean PvE raids, Broken Tooth is best in pvp for the damage and pushback.  
---
In a raid you need to micro manage your cat so it doesn't die so easily, so if you're lazy you can use furious howl as a good alternative to boost you and your melee's damage.  
---
Screech would take up a debuff slot in raid so its a no no ability, but out in the open world its fine
---
Lol, chill. Its a joke.
---
Just because you don't like what's being written doesn't mean you have to resort to such childish attempts at a comeback.
---
Pretty sure that breaks like half of the eula.
---
what
---
That bridge is the almightiest of chokes.
---
He is using the problem created by his own action as justification.
---
I don't mind the 20-40 minute games, I just hate the fact that alliance strategy really hasn't changed other than adding Galvanger to get the bonus rep/honor.
---
By and large they skipp Iceblood and TP and go straight for the keep.  THey might take Frostwolf, but they don't always wait to cap anything before pulling.  If Horde defend at all, the rush almost always fails and I know the game is going to be a 30ish minute loss.  If they at least capped their way down, or had a token defense the game would be an interesting 30minutes.  Instead it's either a 11-14min win or a 30min loss.  That's the part I dislike.
---
Damn you have a queue?
---
I bet it wasn't even that, it was probably the Christmas gift that turns you into a Santa Gnome
---
It's so heavily skewed towards alliance favor that a turtle is the best option for horde!
---
1 week after BWL releases: lfm BWL pug need all link achieve for killing nef or no invite
---
Pretty sure the Alliance never slaughtered almost an entire species and then paved a road with their skeletons.
---
At no point in vanilla did reta do anything close to raid-viable DPS.
---
I keep auto attack on bars so I can turn it OFF, for example mob Im fighting gets sheeped by my mage so I can bandage.
---
Banked stacks of these for months as I happened across them. Then made bank selling them highly marked up. Also, selling milk on the auction house for 10s each, because nobody can be bothered to go find a vendor. And selling the recipies, for the people who can't find the vendor. It's a magical time of year. I regret nothing.
---
Yes, those are pug players I described.
---
So what would your advice be? I would like to complete the later raids, especially the legendary Naxxramas of course. But after this post I worry that I'll get burned out long before that.
---
Play AV
---
While I agree with your strategy with regards to Stonehearth, having 5-10 people pick people off from the Alliance rush and wipe them at Drek/Frostwolf Aid Station is a solid strategy that delays the game to go on for a total of 15 minutes if done well, and 20 minutes if the offense bogs down.  And currently it has a very high win rate.
---
In any case, this vid shows them capping Frostwolf Aid Station, not Stonehearth.  That is an excellent idea, because if most of the Horde is at Stormpike GY or further and you didn't capture Stonehearth, the Alliance are set back enough that Horde can methodically clear to Vann and win at any pace in every game I've played.  And if you're in a slog where neither side can win easily then your honor per hour is already screwed, so just accept it and either leave the BG or push on offense as hard as you can to get things to end one way or another.
---
I'm not trying to vindicate them, just saying that the story, and their situation in the world, is more complicated than your characterization that they're the same as the scourge, and you can see that in their story line. Which is why I asked, because I thought the story was well written *because* it showed the ways that the forsaken are similar to the scourge, but also how the shape of their existence is fundamentally different. Apparently you got a different vibe from it than I did.
---
Party frame, raid frame, name plate and their actual model all work just as well for @mouseover macros
---
Summoning 40 people in 2 minutes? I wanna see that. 
---
My guild can't even ride into BRM as a single unit ...
---
Report them for having cross faction characters (its a suspendable offense on PVP servers)
---
For some people it's the same. That's why modern  games are built like that...
---
I found drain life more useful as i would just rotate fear on the mobs drain life then use that health to cast life tap, curse of exhaustion is deffo better for pvp for chasing or kiting tho
---
If you call Hiding inside drek room and trying to aggro npcs "Pvp" sure.
---
Details! with TinyThreat plug-in is best practice
---
Alliance are not bothering to stop and Cap Snow Fall at all.  They know Horde are not capping SH.  
---
It's also giving a alliance an HK farming bottle neck.  
---
I get the reasons and I don't cap SH.  However, I think it ends up helping Alliance a lot more than it does helping horde to leave it uncapped.   Especially when Horde doesn't play D at all.
---
A few weeks ago I sold a quest reward item that I now realize is a great long-term item that I should have held onto. I have heard it's possible to get it back - can someone walk me through the details? Thank you!!
---
Ahh. We ran two, so I just assumed they were solid. Were they bad even with the armor pen/haste gear in Sunwell?
---
I don't. I use bindpad macros or account macros (not much of an issue for me, I have one account per character).
---
Imagine crying you didn't get hand of debt.
---
I was referring to actual quests using the same mechanic. I'm pretty sure there was a legion world quest that made you kill people of both factions in a similar arena
---
Vimeo???? Lol
---
Omg is that your password too? I can’t read it! My pass is *********
---
Gay rare frame around your character.
---
Have you been on the forums lately ? It’s nothing but horde players complaining about ques or alliance premades. Its just a meme dude
---
&gt; talk to your class leader or the gm and ask how you can become a core raider 
---
I'm GM of a guild, and we have a Loot Council system with about 5 officers and myself discussing loot distribution. I cannot state strongly enough that most respectable guilds and their leadership want people to be vocal about any issues they may see in structure and practices. Leadership may not give you the answer you want, but at least there is a discussion being had an both sides can walk away knowing each other's perspective. A single raider may see an issue that wasn't considered by leadership, and leadership may explain how their singular issue cannot be addressed the way they like because leadership is managing 50-500 people. At least a discussion raises awareness at the very least.
---
Yes, very nice, thank you! Is it have a way to share short links?
---
Tank prio, stay mad dps.
---
If you meant that you vendored the item the only two options are to look at the "Buy Back" tab on a vendor (this has a time limit, I think this option is unavailable after you've logged out) or you can open a ticket for the item to be restored
---
Flamelash isn't the most imbalanced server. Some servers are worse.
---
Blizzard won't address this. There's no solution.
---
Oh good. I just figured with them saying "RIP" it would be gone
---
But then there are quite a few weapons Warriors compete with each other and with Rogues, if your the raid goes with DKP bidding.
---
Although i would never give Retpalas Onslaugt girdle. Spelladins are much more powerful and rely on shitloads of spellpower. That means mages and warlocks will be pissed. In the end it doesn't really matter who gets the items as long as it benefits the entire raid.
---
I had a game with 2 alliance multi boxers. 1 on defense. 1 on offense. We lost brutally. Overall Horde has been winning by putting some on defense though, even when going against premades.
---
Simple solution.
---
Everyone that has the Sulfuron Hammer has to duel each other; bracket style, Best 2 out of 3, class-matched, naked with only the weapon equipped. The winners from each 'class bracket' then go on to duel each other.
---
Champion gets the Eye.
---
How? Not being saarcastic, I'm wondering what debuff I'm missing in my mental math. 5x Sunder is 2250 + FF 505 = 2755. I get that most bosses have \~3000 armor so it's really close. Are we counting annihilators?
---
Going to keep this up but monitor it closely. Remember to remain civil or bans will be issued.

The meta in the last few days has moved to making it pvp, but now a lot of alliance players are complaining, so what gives?

*GOD* I GO TO CHURCH EVERY GODDAMN SUNDAY, YOU GONNA BRING THE DEMONS OUT IN *ME*?!
---
Doing dungeons is a great way. I'm a tank and I have just north of 2000 gold just by doing a bunch of dungeons every day, and that's with most expenses out of the way already. I have epic mount, QS, AV ring, Edgemasters and a consumable bank stocked to the brim.
---
Yeah, battlegrounds instantly flag you, also you’re in a contested zone, so I’m not sure where this came from lol.
---
Link to the macro good sir?
---
I’m with you on this one!
---
ah good call. didn't notice that.
---
I've already said it isnt feasible on the dominant faction.  I've had the same success rate (0%) queueing at same time as guildies.  Only time I've ended up in an AV with a guildie was completely by accident.
---
As alliance you can continually drop queue and requeue until you end up in the same one because the queue times are damn near instant.  Played against multiple Alliance premade AVs this weekend.
---
Fuckkkk that
---
I lost the only T2 helm I've seen for my class so far in a month of raiding to a pug that joined as a fill spot. No loot rules were broken but with things like T2 I feel guild only should get priority. Is this something you would personally leave a guild over? We're switching to a DKP system next week so I get extremely unlucky...
---
First time I've been extremely upset with loot in the game so far. I don't really have a question just wanted to vent. Only one of 4 raiding gear pieces I needed....
---
So last week I reached Lv40 and bought a Brown Horse for my character, soon after I realized that Black Stallion was also an option at a different vendor.  I'm now regretting my choice and I put in a ticket to Blizzard asking them to either me refund me for the Brown Horse or replace it with the Black Stallion.
---
I got my first response today and they said they wouldn't/couldn't.  Is this just a lazy GM and I should keep trying or what's the likelihood for getting help with something like this?
---
A ret paladin can upkeep that dps for patchwerk pretty trivially by naxx, even in just tier 2 and some good rings and a good neck. By the time naxx comes out it really shouldn't be an issue for them to get the necks/rings they want, and giving them a good two hander shouldn't be hard.
---
A spelladin can push that sustained dps even easier, but who wants to farm all those MCPs and farm out ironfoe?
---
If you just want to be able to fill a role, choose Paladin or Druid. With Paladin especially you can fill two roles with a single talent spec, you just have to swap gear.
---
Feels like all I see in AV are Pallys, Warriors, and Mages.
---
Elves are just technically juiced up trolls right?
---
The amount of drops in AV seems high. Also all the epic post on reddit with so many games spammed. I bet there are ppl who only pvp and getting these greens would be a huge upgrade. Have not seen a blue drop yet
---
If it was balanced PvE then it could work as a PvE contest. However, as I become aware of every time I enter Stormpike and get immediately swarmed by npc, it is not an evenly designed PvE contest. So, being a PvP battleground, the human players are using this thing called *strategy* to overcome these environmental imbalances.
---
Lol paladins. Stfu
---
45 meat for hunter pets.
---
We loot council weapons. If our 1 ret has the points, he's getting the belt.  I agree that it would never happen in loot council but that's not what we run.  Changing rules to stop someone from getting gear they earned is BS
---
That being said, just don't take too many meme specks because that could get old quick.
---
Damn thats cheap. 90g a piece on Herod.
---
Queue times for me are between 10-12 minutes on average. A bit longer than I would like, but not awful.
---
Not sure if legit, I spilled a jew joke in trade chat back in vanilla... Got a week ban almost instantly
---
Not true.
---
The person starting the drama is the Ret pally who didnt get it because they had zero mats saved so far.  They lost the eye to another of our ret pally who solo farmed Hammer of sulfuras by month two and half of release.  But the pally who didnt get it argues it was his because he is higher dps more often. We arent on a DKP system.....
---
Can't you replenish them off trash packs?
---
I had an orc warrior kill me twice as I was just sitting there trying to fish. Feels bad man.
---
Stemz from Thunderfury if you’re reading this: you’re a whole entire douche and on my shitlist. Who attacks someone fishing??! That’s just low.
---
A few points
---
My guild has a similar system for ranking members.  You're either "core" for one of our three raid nights, or "bench" where you have to sign up at least 24 hr in advance, and then if there are open spots in the raid then you compete with other "bench" slots for whoever the raid needs most.  So it's definitely hard to break into an established raid, we often have 8-10 signups on the bench and only 2-3 slots available for raid. 
---
That being said, there is some turnover as folks who have raided for 8-10 weeks by now have most/all of their gear and opt to not show up, thus opening spots.  plus there's a mechanic that if you are listed as "core" but miss two out of any four weeks you are relegated to "bench" and thus miss your guaranteed spot. 
---
ALL THAT being said, that is about getting a *SPOT* into a raid which is one issue.  As long as it's fair, that's at your discretion to decide whether it's OK for you or not. 
---
The *LOOT* system you describe is definitely a "loot council" which means that certain tiers of players get better access over others.  My guild uses DKP which isn't perfect but it is at least fair.  You arne't subject to one person getting super lucky wiht /roll- you earn currency based on your participation and can then spend currency to get loot.  It's fair and straightforward, and anyone can access the DKP logs to make sure other oflks aren't getting unfair boosts to their DKP. 
---
IMO your loot system is bad.  If you are raiding you should have an equal shot at gear, rather than waiting for an entire different class of player to gear up before you get the scraps.  What your guild has established is not fair to "non core" spots and you have extremely low incentive to raid with your guild vs just doing pugs, or finding another guild that will give you a fair shot at loot.
---
TL:DR-  In my opinion your guild has a fair system for determining who gets a *SPOT* in a raid, but not a fair system for *LOOT* distribution.
---
Wolf for raids. Furious Howl &gt; anything else.
---
Broken Tooth for PvP. If not possible, get a regular Cat.
---
Owl for solo. Screech is just really good. You can also get a Wind Serpent, Bear or Boar instead.
---
Do you know the name of that addon?
---
It’s accurate af.
---
It's onyxia. You'll get it.
---
Argent Dawn have a combo consumable that's health and mana for level 55. It's also like 300 mana better than what level 55 mage water gives.
---
Don't DPS warriors want to dual wield?
---
Honestly they should have PvP-hardcore and PvP-normal servers
---
Since pre biS are pve gear, can I skip it and just farm for pvp gear?
---
Being level 60 ≠ being done with gearing, profession, and gold. You intentionally skipped  all of those things I listed. 
---
Early January for BWL is way too fucking soon, period.
---
I've noticed some of the respawn rates are impossible. I was in that area south of ratchet and had mobs respawning just seconds after killing them. I got killed like three times because of the damned respawn rate.
---
Horde Racials &gt; Paladins.
---
This isn't quite the answer you're after, but don't bother. I just kept levelling and doing quests and vendoring junk loot and I had the mount at about 43 without going out of my way. The higher level you are, the more money you make and it's a pretty significant difference, so if you spend 5 days grinding at lvl 37 you would spend a day or two at 60 getting the same amount of gold. Ultimately the ~90g you spend at 40 is a drop in the ocean compared to the 800-900g you spend at 60 and IMO it's not worth the time investment.
---
Considering half the time they parade about being nice and then plague people or massacre something to gather reagents for the plague and the other half they just plague things or kill something to take its territory I'm not sure what other vibe you could have gotten from them. Their story only get more bloodthristy after the cata world update.
---
Yikes, I'd be wary about staying with a Guild with such poor planning.  Ours helps with Ingots and such
---
Why would a pug come into your raid if you they couldn't roll on gear. Either dont bring pugs at all or let them roll on gear.
---
The main story of WoW should probably be held aa canon.
---
GMs wont help on lack of knowledge matters
---
“Horde players be like”
---
The content is stale bro
---
Self deprecating humor my good man. Have I also told you about how I'm a vegan who does crossfit?
---
No. You'd be destroyed by twinks. You stand no real chance.
---
Higher level brackets like 29 or 39 are much better for non-twinks. You have some chance to survive.
---
That one of them new fruit roll up monitors?
---
Seems like your Guild made the right decision.
---
&gt;it was his because he is higher dps more often
---
Woohoo he won the special Olympics more often
---
Best part on the full video was the comment, "That better be on /r/classicwow tomorrow." Then someone chimed in and said, "That better be on Fox News tomorrow!"
---
 Respect his decision and leave a nice comment on his social media. We wish you all the best Zack. See you soon.
---
The tone of this post suggests your team knew what they were doing. Maybe tone the toxicity town a notch a see if they help you next time? Or, crazy thought, maybe ask why they didn't help you. 
---
Blizzard isn't going to force transfer anyone.
---
I thought it was the simplest choice ever to make, we had only one pally who already had sulfuron hammer. We gave it to him.  The ret pally, with no hammer, who has always been slightly higher dps is starting all this drama
---
no that is not what was said. it specifically says you HAVE to play DPS WARRIOR. am i the only person who can read english words here? its very clear what it says. it never says you can go healing or dps on your druid or pally. its saying to go dps warrior
---
Lol, it happens. Dying your first time out is pretty common, I wouldn't sweat it. Particularly if the raid as a whole didn't wipe. The phase 3 transition is the trickiest part of that fight, if people die, it tends to be there. Odds are nobody else even remembers this or cares.
---
Which is a good chunk. Also I want a wolf.
---
Because the opponents will see the bear capping and hit him.
---
I heard him crystal clear in my head with that. It's amazing how much he can say without saying anything at all. It is very clear from those advertise and world discord calls
---
This isn't lazy GM stuff this is 100% appropriate for the concept of WoW classic.  Older games didn't have as many fail safes for destroying quest items, misplacing things, getting stuck, etc...
---
Many of us appreciate the difficulty and punishing aspect of making a split second regrettable decision.  
---
Get used to measuring twice and cutting once.
---
Also, eventually you'll save up for your epic mount so it's not a permanent mistake and you can always go out and buy the other one of you want.
---
What are you talking about? There's that hammer off nef
---
I just right click to begin auto attacking
---
Would that be cool? Sure. But does anyone actually think blizzard is going to spend development time on classic plus when they can sell us TBC a second time and get practically free money? 
---
I'd like a new direction but I have my doubts it's anything but a pipe dream
---
lol 1 class vs race STFU
---
kill balinda then push straight for win
---
make the game end quickly after taking those two objectives. if ally is competent they'll kill drek before you can win but they usually aren't so you'll get bal rep and win rep and get to re queue quickly
---
I get the impression that these type of players don't fully understand the honor system in Classic, otherwise this type of thread wouldn't exist. Their idea of PvP was spending the time they thought would be enough to get the rewards of PvP, now that they have the real experience they have realized it takes way more effort than they realized and because they can't get their gear rewards as quickly or easily as they wanted, it's the system and playerbase that is the issue and not their expectations or attitude about the reality of what it takes.
---
And are you really gonna gatekeep mage water usage bro
---
&gt;When you replay Skyrim, do you skip straight to killing Alduin, or do you go through the other quests first?
---
Implying anyone actually does the main storyline at all :)
---
Yeah. I just still feel a bit guilty because I got a T2 helm out of the fight (by default because I was the only Druid there) and meanwhile I was just like... boy, I hope no one noticed that I got absolutely fucking deleted halfway through that.
---
He could say he was going to hang himself and we wouldn't care and just ask for his stuff
---
I was happy/content with freeroll ms&gt;os since I mostly raided in BC/wotlk and it wasn’t much of an issue back then since raid sizes were smaller. After my second or third MC run I was like fuck freerolling, watching fresh 60’s win majority of the loot in some of those runs including a few items I was looking forward too. I saw one guy win every roll in his class one night, at one point the raid leader and the guy winning was like yea we need others to get loot and he let others get the pieces he won. Hell I hit 60 and two weeks later two buddies of mine hit 60 and got epic 2h swords right after hitting 60, with one being a holy pally in the raid. He made an agreement with the raid leader beforehand that no one knew about until it dropped that he would be able to roll on some Ret pally gear.
---
Now I’m in a raid group with loot council and round robin, I’ve been content since everyone ends up with at least one piece of gear or more a week. Still some people have gotten really salty with loot council even after getting good gear. Blows my mind.
---
I haven't had any issues so far. The only reason I didn't put much effort into finding other pets before level 52 is that my bear was always able to do what I needed it to do. The only time I have any problems is when I dump a ton of high-damage abilities in a short amount of time and even then it doesn't always make me pull aggro. And when it does I can almost always get the aggro back on the bear by using intimidation. I was able to solo-clear Shadowfang Keep a couple dozen times with my bear at level 39 to make my mount money.
---
I cap it just for the responses.
---
Our Guild sees this as an PvP only weapon which is totally fine for me but the thing i dont understand is why not letting every pvp active player roll for it... i just gave up on my guild on making good decissions i stop raiding with them and focus on PvP
---
Some guy posted the Pendulum of Doom for 2,300g on my server. That does NOT mean it's worth 2,300g.
---
Someone has to buy your item for it be of a certain value.
---
The best way to find out the value of your item is to advertise in trade chat, and ask for offers.
---
i'm just posting this because i think the whole thing is pretty funny - they only slowed us down 2 mins this last one and compared to phase 2 it's a vacation
---
The whole point of the hordes strat is it turns the relevant advantage from the rush distance (which favors the alliance), to how hard it is to kill the warmasters (which favors the horde due to the layout of the keep).  It doesn’t matter if the alliance can reach the relief hut first if the group of horde in the stronghold make it impossible to not pull multiple warmasters at once; you won’t kill them off before the towers start falling and the horde creates even more warmasters.
---
Forti was actually hilarious before phase 2 though.
---
:O my face when I realized he was the rogue
---
Absolutely.
---
~10 people to wipe Alli on their first Drek rush wins almost every time, unless you happen to be against a really competent group / your group is awful.
---
These matches are won in 15-20 mins.
---
HOW COULD THEY?!?!
---
And on a srs note, I had one that was actually srs about that. Pvp in a bg.... how could we!?!?
---
Move anything addon

You cannot apply full dots and then use TOEP. The trinket does not work that way in case you were wondering.

You need to use TOEP and then place your dots.

If they leave oh well. Classic is not for everyone!
---
&gt; The ret pally, with no hammer, who usually gets slightly higher dps
---
Not for long.
---
What´s even more concerning is that that guy is probably old enough to not have a kid mentality and yet when he logs in his the mindset changes to that of a 10 year old.
---
What you really should do is report the guy and have your entire core raiding guild mates report too with link to what u just linked us.
---
Probably Blizz (under the new managment of the biggest cunt ever to grace gaming industry - yeah, im talking the "you think you do, but you dont a\*\*hole) wont do anything, but one can always hope.
---
This kind of behaviour doesnt really do much for the game or the comunity.
---
Or gather some of your mates and and straight up camp his kidies, sry, his guildies i mean,  when they are not in raid (thats probably why they think they are bad and mean) or when some of them are farming and grief them. 
---
Keep powering on my dude and do not let yourself and your guildies get bullied around by some cocksucking hillbilly cousinfucker like those dudes, sry, i mean those kids.
---
ps: To all those cunts in that guild: 
---
"Your sister is your mother
---
Your father is your brother
---
Yall fuck one another

Assuming burst means they don't get time to be healed, an ele shaman can do 3k damage for free with EM, and then continue to murderize things. Its not being oom that shamans worry about it, its not being allowed to cast becuase of the dozen things that can interrupt casting.
---
No one but the loot master noticed that you got this helm, 100% sure about that, don't worry mate keep going
---
I was thinking of that. But I'm doing a lot of my questing with a hunter (I probably should have mentioned that).
---
That guy is nuts warriors scaled fine in TBC.
---
Could you explain what this means? I'm not very aware of recording softwares and how different every one of them is.
---
Spell damage gear wont work for poisons but it does work for shadow oil..
---
Check out defcamp and melderon on YouTube if you have any shammy questions.
---
Do I do that in game? Thank you both!
---
I dont know enough lore behind WoD vs the original timeline.  That being said, the original draenor orcs and draenai lived amongst each other, result of this is half-draenai orcs.  
---
As far as WoD goes, I only can suggest that Garrosh arrived earlier with help of chromie, and turned the orcs.  As with much of the WodD timeline fiasco, things sure did change.
---
Funny enough, dragging out the games is making alliance want to queue for AV less and less.  Especially after they've hit exalted.
---
So the people dragging the games out are also increasing queue times for the entire faction.
---
Yeah they fluctuate between 30-50g usually on Atiesh, but I was patient and grabbed them whenever someone posted them for cheaper.
---
Who is "we"?
---
what is honor looking like on gehennas now?
---
You can use a weak aura for that and save a button.
---
I'm on the same quest want to group up?
---
Distasteful
---
Thats pretty solid to have the guild funding 5 of the 9 ignots tbh. We are doing every other ignot we give to our sham who got the eye, and then the ones that dont well sell to him for a discounted price. Then we supply all the other stuff other than the bars. I think thats a pretty fair compromise, but we haven't seen hardly any ignots at all so its a bummer.
---
It's quite simple, and you guys chose correctly: He who has the will to farm all that crap gets it. The other one who gets slightly higher dps because he lands one more crit in those 30sec fights can shut the fuck up.
---
Harry Potter and the deathly hollow points??
---
Ivan is correct for this state of the game it's all Warriors followed by Rogues just below every other dps is irrelevant. Mages and even Locks will start to go ham and compete later on in AQ etc.. I get where Pbz is coming from though there is literlaly no point in min maxing on a Hunter just to be middle of the pack lol.
---
Isn't 2h pretty bad for alliance, meaning Ashkandi would only be used in PvP by the warrior?
---
Yea ok, and? Arcane shot hunters exist. Nothing wrong with rogue having TF.
---
had a  few questions regarding imp sprint if i may:   
---
1. How come no endurance if it is an imp sprint build?
---
2. Is ruthlessness really worth it? I find myself building points slowly because backstab costs so much energy, maybe my rotation is wrong + are the fights that long?
---
3. A friend was saying "dude, you need master of deception" but i imagine master of deception is kinda pointless in bgs right?
---
So to phrase it another way, you would like to require players on PVP servers to fight the other faction or risk getting server rolled away from their friends, guild, etc? That's going to be a tough sell.
---
'So there I was, trying to turn in a quest before the guild's MC run when I saw it: A fellow Alliance member engage a party of three Horde. Knowing my server status was on the line and not wanting to get reported, I jumped into the fray and was quickly put down. Three corpse walks and 30 minutes later I get replaced in the raid group for holding up the party.' - just an example of how that system may affect play if implemented. 
---
 WoW is an open sandbox and letting people choose when, where and how to fight is part of that. A lot of the PVP and honor farming has moved into the battle grounds. The majority of people you meet in the open world now will be questing, farming or something similar. Them failing to play how you want isn't so much a problem with them, but an issue with the unspoken expectations assigned to them.
---
He earned his stripes
---
wow really? İt always sounded like more rude tone of “okay” to me until now. My english is not very good and i guess i learned a new thing about it today :) Thank you for explaining. And i also owe u/zappg a public apology because just because i known “OK” as a rude tone until now, i thought whole tone of his comment is rude and snarky. Totally my fault :)
---
Because WoW is a preindustrial world.  You use what you have available to decorate and the Horde has plenty of skulls lying around.
---
You can just zoom in and walk into the guy until you find the battlemaster
---
You shouldn't need to open a ticket. On the blizzard website log into your account and look for the item restoration tool. It's limited to one use every couple weeks.
---
Accuracy by itself doesn't make a good meme. It would be equivalent if I used this pic with title reading, "Americans" with caption "I like fast food." 
---
Can't believe brainlets think 0 effort memes are well deserving. But you are probably ally who gets confused when there is 5-10 horde defending so it's okay.
---
This didnt age well
---
those raid frames are the built in ones.
---
You are a monster.
---
I have played wow classic only for a few hours a few years ago. Can anyone explain how he did it?
---
r/ontheledgeandshit
---
I would turn fury warriors into wisp right before a pull and then watch them sit there not knowing what's going on, good fun.
---
If your leveling with a hunter most the time, your dots wont have time to do much damage. Depending how often your paired up you may want to do a build that is more up front damage.
---
You're full of it.  I can tell you picked your class and have made up a mythology around it.  I've raided and ranked nearly every class including druid.  Paladin is best healer, priest is best most flexible most diverse healer, shaman is best raid healer, druid has brez and innervate.  HoTs overheal a ton and even with all that overheal you can't get your HPS anywhere close to the other classes.  You use rank 4 healing touch and a couple ranks of revuj.  If you're topping 'healing done' than there is something super wrong with your guild.
---
I would prefer someone whisper me and open trade. I am less stingy than most mages though. I always make extra water.
---
You must be ally. The rush gets horse a loss, the turtle gets us a win.
---
Respecing increases in cost until 50g, so respecing often starts to cost a lot.  
---
Play what you are comfortable with, but know your highest damage potential will come from being MM, and when you are clearing raids with 39 other people some might not like having someone not "pulling their weight", but that completely depends on your guild / group.  
---
You can easily clear all the content in game now as BM
---
Undefeated, 6-7 min games
---
The druids bear form covered my entire body while I capped!
---
Lmfao this is perfect
---
agreed
---
It's not as used as it used to be fraps was popular because it was super lightweight on your games performance, with the tradeoff being that the filesizes of the recordings was massive. people have better PCs nowadays and can afford the extra processing power that a screen recorder that does some compression requires.
---
It's two different goals. One is to win a BG and the other is too get R14 and or exalted rep. Theoretically, the two goals would be the same; winning the BG would be the best way to gain honor/rep but the honor system is one of the worst designed grinds in video games.
---
The context behind the reply is that, "If you wanted to get good honor to get good pvp gear and be ranked higher this week, you should have left that match 70 minutes ago."  You personally are welcome to have fun in that av.  The opportunity loss of 70 minutes in a game that resulted in either a win or loss in terms of pvp rank, honor, and pvp gear was ginormous.

Hunter weapon

In addition to being able to see when a boss is casting a spell that can be disrupted, or knowing the % HP to effectively manage mana for the fight.
---
" wE gEt 10o g/Hr " hahaha I bet you do. Even jump runs at BEST give like 60g per person. Stop talking shit.
---
sounds like someone needs a good old gkick for being a dick.
---
God I am so excited for BC if they release those servers
---
to me it seems to be slowly shifting back towards playing the battleground to actually win it again. There's always a contingent of people who play defense  and make it interesting it seems like

Damn, well you'll get there. I believe in you!

Hey my dude! Branflakes of &lt;Dude Wheres my Mount&gt; here. By the looks of your photo, you'll fit in just well with us. We're the biggest guild of smokers on the server, been here since day one and PvP/do dungeons on the daily.
---
I like to endorse/help out all our lowbies we can, so please give me a shout if you need help. Also type /who dude wheres my mount ingame to find a member/get an invite right away! All members can invite so you're in the clear.
---
Cheers

LOL
---
Gimli makes that claim in the movies but it was never properly established canonically iirc.
---
I haven’t read the books in a couple of years unfortunately but quick cross checking on Tolkien Gateway talks about how the Uruk-Hai are just described and larger and stronger orcs and were Saurons creation, not Saruman, and were first seen when they conquered Osgiliath.
---
Saruman does breed them for his army, but like everything he does it’s just a copy of what Sauron has already done.
---
Treebeard speculates if they were somehow corrupted men or some foul crossbreed, but doesn’t know for certain. 
---
What we do know for certain is that their name literally means Orc.
---
Honestly the whole origin of Orcs is super up in the air. It’s hinted in the Silmarillion that they were originally elves that were picked off by Morgoth before Orome found them and brought them to Valinor but again, if I recall correctly, that was never fully established. I personally believe they were a result of Morgoth’s discord, like Ungoliant likely was, or perhaps something he created before he fully lost his ability to create. 
---
It’s fully possible that they were somehow corrupted men or some cross breed, which would help explain their resilience to the sun, but I think either way it’s fair to say that they are Orcs, just a slightly different flavor.
---

That was his helpful reply. He recognizes dumb because he sees it in the mirror every day, lol.
---
Zebra mount confirmed
---
that's rough buddy. our guild pretty much decided before we started doing raids to give eye to our one ret pally, and bindings to our one prot paladin
---
ret pally now has sulfuras, no drama, still barely does half the dps of warriors/rogues/mages
---
I don't see 90% of pvp server population is alliance.

All pets end up having the same amount of points at 60.

#**&lt;Tribute&gt;**
---
Horde | Whitemane (PvP-PST) | Wed/Thu 8pm-11:30pm PST | Semi-hardcore | Loot council
---
This isn't the greatest guild in the world, no. This is just a &lt;Tribute&gt;. Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh! :)  
---
Our main goal for **&lt;Tribute&gt;** is to foster a fun gaming community of like-minded and social players who put the needs and success of the team above their own. Our raids are relaxed, but focused - we get shit done. We prioritize loot and invites with the goal of gearing up efficiently, clearing content swiftly, and no drama. We're all adults here and many of us have families and/or demanding careers, so we want to be strategic in getting the most out of our game time. We think having fun with friends is critical to the overall success of the guild, and host "Game Nights" once every 4-6 weeks or so; Game Night normally includes some form of intoxication and free online games like Cards Against Humanity, Jackbox Games, etc.  
---
**Expectations**
---
We'll expect you to bring your best, strive to be knowledgeable about your class, never be afraid to ask questions, accept and give feedback graciously, improve the experience of the team, and be social &amp; have fun. If you like our philosophy and want to be part of our team, then read on. Even if you aren't interested in raiding, social members that fit with our culture are always welcome to join and hang out, level, PvP, and/or farm with us.  
---
**Raid schedule**
---
Our regular raid times are Wednesday and Thursday from 8:00pm-11:30pm PST (ends earlier on farm nights). This means we start pulling at 8:00pm so you'll need to be online, at the instance, with consumes, ready to go by 7:45pm. We will have other guild events such as group farming , PvP, 20-mans, old 40-man content, and/or GDKP runs on Saturdays. Our loot system is described in more detail on our discord.  
---
Interested?
---
Please join our discord at https://discord.gg/yZfrb8S, read things, and chat with us!
---
the big down being that instead of getting paid, you pay to do it with money and mental wellbeing.
---
but god damnit the dopamine from seeing purple items is otherwordly
---
Prebis* , and yeah I never said it was inefficient, he just asked for the first commenter's  rogue/druid duo farm strat
---
Doing dungeons from ~43-60 is by far the best way to  a trifecta of 1.  exp 2.  your prebis (and some current bis) raiding and PvP gear 3.  mount gold
---
Pretty good overall, I personally prefer suppression over improved LT though for the 3 points after imp corr having a fear resist can kill you when you are juggling mobs, and you save alot of mana not having to double cast dots cause of resists. Imp LT is great, it just didn't seem like it mattered all that much until I got a few higher ranks of lifetap
---
New store mount incoming.
---
What? That statement makes no sense.
---
PvP by itself is about as toxic as any other competitive activity. It's the reward system that I think puts it over the top, especially in the early phase. Lots of people are only in there for effective rep grinding, and they rage if it gets delayed. I found AV much more enjoyable when most people had their rep, and Honor farmer meta had shifted to smaller BG premade grinds.
---
Then dont engage if you're losing 1v1s lolol..
---
That just tells me those guilds needed to either merge or have an agreement that the one will feed the other.
---
But you're forgetting about the epeen gains you get on warcraft logs when you put up them sexy parses!
---
Put on a couple movies and grind it out, you'll get there.
---
Yup, mutated by the well of eternity (and pretty much any other strong source of magic).
---
so you are trying to tell me when you party up for dungeons and ACTUALLY DO them .. you get pre-raid BiS gear ? no way ... damn really ? thanks for sharing this insightful knowledge bro.
---
I remember TBC being pretty easy. But then again I pretty much lived WoW
---
yes, if you desire to not raid to get the best in slot pvp gear.  The items given from pvp vendors are not the best for necks, trinkets, rings, cloaks, belts, bracers and sometimes depending on your class even the weapons from bwl and aq will be better than the high warlord items.
---
majority of raidloggers i've seen don't come prepared, on time, or perform well (90th percentile or higher).
---
Where can I find that option? Sorry I have the Addon in german :D
---
You sound like you need a hug. Who talked shit? Are you down with the syndrome?
---
Ohh shittt  MY GUY

well he didn't say per person...which equates to 50g/h

[Jame's Alliance Leveling Guide - Chapter I (30-41) [old version]](http://www.wow-pro.com/leveling_guides/jame039s_alliance_leveling_guide_chapter_i_3041_old_version) and continue into 40-51 part
---
While I agree about the instant flag in BGs I'd like to point out that contested or hostile zones won't flag you on pve servers
---
Does the honor from honorable kills still diminish the same way in BGs as wPVP?  After 4 kills, that target is worth no more honor for 24 hours?
---
That's kinda pointless if you can wand a tank so boss kills them instead by reaggroing. Bonus points for Onyxia.
---
Horde doesn't have to play ideally since alliance isn't doing that either... They just have to play better - but it's way too much to ask since balianda really really needs 37 characters to be killed.. It can be killed with 5man, same 5 man could clear stoneheart and icewing bunker captais for extra honour.
---
Best server
---
I was gonna say, EVE is leaking
---
They will. There are really big ticket items from MC/BWL/AQ so those raids will always be ran. Every week. Pugs or guild runs, people will be clearing them for the entirety of the WoW Classic lifespan.
---

2019: Posting a shameful rag kill gets you reddit karama.
---
How much estimated honor should I be looking at to go from Rank 0 to Rank 3?
---
Yeah I am in one of the guilds in the server where this has come up. The buff helps, but really isn't that big of a deal.
---
i got all 3 main bgs exalted on 3 characters originally.. WSG seemed the slowest, but since i played it more i got it before AB/Defilers
---
Came in and turned in the quest after a raid already cleared it.  Good times
---
The playerbase tells you how to play via achievements (requiring achieves to do the content). Nothing about achievement inherently forces you to complete any of them.
---
“The level of outrage”?
---
I am pretty calm.
---
I’m just saying I think people who do this are assholes
---
I’m unsure about Legion, but Draenor had garrison quests that had you specifically kill certain races and collect their broken bones. Fun stuff!
---
&gt;This project is highly dependant on community participation, because the statistics are only as good as of how many people have the CensusPlusClassic addon
---
But they won't. I've seen several screenshots of players doing this and the GM response is always essentially "sucks to suck."  
---
Sorry OP but the item is permanently gone. Blizzard will not help recover accidentally vedored items.
---
Cross-faction coordination is against the rules
---
Sulfuras needs it's on sub, would be nice
---
They are decent but don't expect to top meters. They can pump when needed. HOTW is about flexibility so no one should really expect you to top meters with it.
---
Swiftmend isn't a great raiding spec. Most go Moonglow/NS
---
I highly doubt a huge portion completed their AV farm. I've been running it during all my free time since BGs released and I still have 10k rep left to go. I play maybe 2-3 hrs a day. Most players probably have jobs and such. The only people I know who are done are the ones who played for 8-10 hrs straight some days.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] ?
---
Do you have a better source?
---
Its 42% A - 58% H
---
Did anyone find a solution to this issue? Still exists in current version of atlas. Tried installing other atlas mods but still get this error every time I log in.
---
Hi, /u/risu1313
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ebir72/i_just_want_a_haircut_changes/). 
---
that's what he clearly meant tho . I refuse to believe that anyone would say how much g/hr they make as a group ... that's just a braindead thing to do ... bu then again ..... this is classic so I should expect these type of comments lol
---
weird i guess atlas loot is wrong.. it has bracers already unlocked and legs at P6
---
Points of pet = level x (loyalty-1).
---
I'm a salty human warrior that's seen 5 DB and 0 VS.
---
Everything you just said can apply to ally. Even if every horde member works like you want them to if the ally did too they'd still win. Turtling is hordes best chance at winning and it shows
---
Having a hotkey to stop attacking is actually useful when your target is suddenly CCed.
---
Myself and the other DPS Warriors saved our DKP for 4 months until the first Ashkandi dropped.  We were planning on outbidding Paladins and Hunters and /rolling when it was just warriors left.
---
Out of nowhere, a hunter had saved all his DKP and won the Ashkandi.  He ended up leaving the guild shortly after.  
---
I am still bitter to this day.  :-(
---
And accurate.
---
Bowsette.
---
Nobody really knows, because this is the first week BG's have been live, and no pattern has been established yet.  It will probably be incredibly difficult to get more than 1 or 2 ranks this first week.  As the weeks go by and BG's stabilize, we will know a lot better.
---
The only reason this is an issue is because you are letting it be. Tell him he can have the next one when he shows you a trade window with a finished hammer.  Ret pally drama lol.
---
If he keeps chirping Gkick and replace with a boomkin.
---
hey! are you already painting the new picture? :P
---
I guild hopped till I found one with monolith DKP point system. By far the most balanced system, though it's not perfect as some guilds will choose to give away rare drops like eye of sulfuras and bindings to their main tank without bid.
---
5 druids?!?!
---
There are two reasons:
---
1. The wpvp situation is completely resolved.
---
2. Everyone is sitting in a city grinding AVs right now. The complaints have switched to how AVs are one-sided, not enough pvp, alliance sucks, etc.
---
All I'm saying is play the class yourself and see how quick that tune changes when people are asking you every AV for water lol. Even if you give out 1 stack each you're down 3-4m worth of drinking and then you don't even have any for yourself. No I'm not going to make 400+ water before every game.
---
IMO single mobs when possible, chain pulling.  When one is about to die, send your pet to the next.
---
Alot of players on both sides only want quick wins or quick losses.  Since 85% of the honor in AV is earned within the first 8 minutes with Lieutenants + Galv/Belinda dying.  Dragging out the games to 20+ will just make alliance want to queue for AV less which means you spend more time in queue.
---
Unironically. Only class that should use it in PVE alliance side.
---
&gt; BWL Cloak
---
Are you talking about the very competitive caster cloak that drops from the final boss nefarian?  As a priest, you will get last priority on that over mages and warlocks.  That is after you fully clear the raid, if your guild is capable and doesn't break before that point from bosses or controversial loot decisions.
---
bug guild bad, hat guild good.
---
@nodead
---
Good job bruh. Question: what is the name of your honor addon on the bottom left?
---
60x2 = 120g. Is your brain not working due to the overload of salt in your body?
---
One dropped off the Darkmaster in Scholomance for us, it was green though
---
As Shaman who has farmed all the mats as well.. put in countless hours farming, buying selling, trading, etc I would hope that shows my guild the dedication and work I'm willing to put into something like that they do me the honor of awarding the Eye to me. If the other Pally who does better DPS should have also put in the work and the effort. I mean its really a dumb argument. You put in all the work and effort to do the best DPS you can as a Ret but you dont put in the same effort to be ready for that BiS gear when it drops.
---
Horde sit inside drek room, they propably have never seen that bridge.
---
You are wrong
---
I apologize, I fell asleep. It isn’t necessarily those with the highest threat. Ragnaros decides to knock you back by your character ID number, something you can’t see. Thats why you need healers quick on the draw to see who gets knocked back. Those three people should be the only ones knocked back, and that persists from every run forever.
---
If you get a new melee DPS odds are 2 of the people knocked back will stay the same. But the third may be different. That’s why I suggest doing this when you have your core melee DPS group that you know will show every week. So those three people (one is always the tank, but won’t get knocked back if he had the fire resistance) will always be the ones knocked back.
---
Yep. I was listening to Skarm’s BWL loot breakdown and he’s like “Hunter weapon? No I’d probably give this to a warrior for PvP first” 
---
Warriors are loot whores
---
we're definitely not feeling bullied - i'm only posting in an effort to share the laugh we all had when our GM showed up that convo. this last saturday we still pulled at 10:02 (2 mins late, oh no!) and we only have 1 guy that world buffs regularly (and he always dies right away anyway lol)
---
this is all a joke to us
---
Hold on to hypnotic blade, it won't be replaced until 60 dungeons as far as sp. 
---
Ele enh seems like it would work well, but for pvp specifically ele/rest is way better. This is because the beginning resto tree gives you some amazing talents such as 25% mana red on totems, 3% spell/melee hit, 5% lightning/healing crit, imp ank, and ns if you decide to go ns, which makes you way more useful in dungeons and raids (along with the resto talents making you way more versatile than enh)
---
You can go ele now, but I'd honestly wait until 40 because storm strike well make you realize how bad enh is and when you respec to EM you will likely never want to go back to enh. Ele is far superior to Enh for pvp but overall you should play what you're having most fun with. Enh to me was great, but was getting very stale. Blowing things up with ele (I can 1 hit people with my EM combo as a geared 60 now) Is just way more fulfilling.
---
It’s weakauras honorperhour. It’s not accurate after BGs came out.
---
If you're gonna try it wait to get [Ebon Hand](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19170/ebon-hand). Someone said this scales with SP as well.
---
Blizzard had many 100/0 servers in retail and they didn't comment anything about it.  
---
And what do you expect from them? There's no magical solution, it's a dead end for server.
---
How do you farm 3k+ gold solo...
---
Why would the top tier guild bother? The situation works perfectly for them: they get people whenever they need them, without putting in any real work. The less-known guilds would love some sort of agreement, but they don't have the leverage to make it happen.
---
This would often lead to smaller guilds disbanding, since the officers and players would eventually get frustrated over the situation and just give up.
---
New week, new PvP whinge from Alliance.
---
&gt;doing 20man bwl
---
By that point everyone is going to be super geared and it's going to matter even less.
---
Imagine being a pvp player and not being a pvp guild to make a premade group. Wild.
---
I had to kill 45 wolves the other day for that one Quest, then I realized they weren't wolves I was killing but the same level 10 horde over and over. Oops
---
Your lack of research on what color mounts are available is not something any GM would address.  Erroneous tickets like this are the kind of thing that unnecessarily slow down ticket response times.
---
Oh looky here at mr. triehard nolife here that's already 53 some of us are a single bubble into 50 because we have a life /s.
---
Sure!
---
Looks like it's happening with the wolves around Thunderbluff too
---
um.. why are approaching me like that.. no.. NO STOP PLEASE OH DEAR GO- ARRGHHGGJHGHJ-... (dies)
---
it wasn't really that bad, you did most of those heroics and stuff anyway
---
maybe if you had a lot of alts it would be worse, but if you were just playing a main and one alt or so really not bad
---
It’s Hunter BiS if you do a melee weave rotation. A lot of people will assign it as a PvP weapon though, like you mention.
---
Normally I would agree.
---
But let me add; Pick a class that fits you for playing solo, not with friends. Choose your second choice  for playing with friends they may not always be around to play with.
---
you did not mention the top end damage on the weapons.  All you do when comparing hunter weapons is pick the highest top end damage and call it a game.  BWL bow until NAXX OUT.
---
AV should have been original AV not this shit version.
---
You make an excellent point there.
---
Its funny to me that this shit somehow drops more often than BRE.
---
21:9 is Just finde for wow, would never Go Back
---
So would read like this?
---
&gt;@nodead
---
&gt;/tar Boar
---
I do this, but I keep a rejuv up on the tank so I can swiftmend when it's about to expire (if the tank is missing health). HOT's really helps reduce that spikey tank damage on our fury prot warriors.
---
Ret pally gm. Rip
---
Faerlina is just the worst
---
Ho Ho Ho!
---
The post said `we` mate
---
Dots snapshot in classic, they take the stats (including spellpower) active at cast.
---
you do not owe them anything.  take your friends and find a guild that has mc on farm and all the geared players from your class, so that you can get easy epics that would normally be de'd.
---
Sounds a lil riske. Anyone do this in classic yet?
---
I'm blind. I thought it was a marshal at first glance.
---
so on a common week night it didn't take corpse running the entire path from flight path to BRM?
---
Crusader was added to those Tyr's Hand mobs in the TBC pre-patch and is not in classic.  Every pserver had it that way as a QOL change.
---
For what? Just shiftclick their name or %t when you’re targeting them.
---
Logitech G600. 
---
It's great. I only use the top ~6 and the back corner with the side of my thumb but the extra shift button for cooldowns is great.
---
Someone do this
---
I have heard people say this, but I've had trouble getting people to pay for runs. Sure, they are always LF tank, but ask for 10g or reserving an orb and everyone goes crazy. And even then, a decent run takes around 45 minutes, meaning you could have made more money in that time by just farming with a DPS spec.
---
Admittedly you obviously play way more than I do, because I expect the AV ring to take about a month of playtime.
---
Thanks for all the advice. I guess once I get into raiding I'll just let everyone know what my loadout looks like and tell them I'm new to WoW so if they need me to make changes I'll be more than happy to do so. Going to work on getting BT caught up to my level and try to find a good wolf, so by the time I'm ready for raids I should hopefully be able to just drop some gold on a respec and swap to a different pet.
---
Time is money friend!
---
By being a no-life neet and playing 10+ hours a day.
---
Sulfuras isn't a warrior weapon, or a paladin weapon, or a shaman weapon, it's a "who has the most free time to farm gold" weapon.
---
See when people say they get 100/hr doing duo dm tributes I look at them a little funny. Hunters by definition can reach the instance cap for dm tribute and make 60-70g/hr. Yet all of a sudden a duo party faced with the same instance limitation and killing the same mobs somehow get 100.... Lol
---
TL:DR op is sexually harassing other players.
---
There's no API for threat in the game, so all threat addons works on estimates based on known values.  
---
And it's not 100% correct.
---
No sorry, I'm not a shitty drunk that passes out mid raid.
---
lol, wow.
---
Yeah, I thought Nvidia and AMD both provide built-in "Always be recording the last 30 minutes" features to make easy clips from.
---
*not all sub-humans were unworthy of life*
---
Oh well theres a positive 
---
*slavs for instance* 
---
Ah nice, slavs getting a break for once
---
*were useful as slaves*
---
Gdi nazis
---
Awesome, ty! Around what lvl should I be to try and tank/dps those runs?
---
It is feasible to do them at level 58, but most groups only take level 60s because lower level players make the group kill extra packs due to the larger aggro range.
---
that's just like, your opinion, man
---
And why do you think Horde is the favorite side to pick for  people on pvp server?
---
Because 1% is ridiculously wrong and an idiotic thing to say
---
what do you mean by that? what "kind of person" am i?
---
I agree there trash, but it’s easier to get a ret to be a nightfall bot over a hunter or warrior.  So I was under the impression that’s why most guilds have one.
---
Dang it. Thank anyway.
---
Probably would have done alright if it was made anywhere but on the classic subreddit. oh well
---
A good guild wouldn't care if you are ret because a good guild knows you can down content with 20 people
---
Fair point. I said in another comment that we dont play together often because he leveled to 60 much faster than me. I was looking forward to raiding together but just as I'm ready (lvl 58) this whole thing went down.
---
Wait, what? They have friends that would like to play as a TEAM? Impossible! I can't do that, so neither should they!
---
To reddit!! Complains ahoy!!!
---
Yeah
---
Yeah, but that ignores leveling and dungeon running etc.
---
Maybe it is just me, I recently hit 60 and only have 160g to my name, but I am playing a warrior so not great for farming
---
I'd like to think I'm not a scrub after my years of experience and the only reason I haven't been able to get the full exalted in 2 days is due to work+spouse+child. 
---
However... I have a sneaking fear that maybe that is just scrub mentality and I am just a filthy casual pretending to be good! OH NO! The horror!
---
It seems like if the ret pally already has higher dps then he didn’t need the hammer anyways? 🤷🏼‍♂️ Lol
---
Horde are perfectly capable of winning fast, it's exactly what happened for the first few hours of day 1 before people started getting greedy for Balinda. This version has the original Horde starting point, which is far more balanced distance-wise compared to Ally.
---
But when 30+ out of 40 of you people stop your attack every game to kill a trivial NPC that can be 5 manned, you forfeit your right to complain about others not wanting to win. Because *that* is the single most detrimental accretion that you can take in the current AV, too many stopping in middle at the beginning to fight NPCs.
---
And it happens literally every game. Then people complain about others not being energized to try to fight an uphill battle after they willingly put the team 2 minutes behind on everything.
---
Prepping for classic, my friends and I discussed class choice at length and made sure we had all of our bases covered! Of the 12 or so, we had maybe 5 healers, 2 warriors, and a bunch of mixed dps. People chose their race and class thoughtfully to maximize synergy. 
---
Flash forward 4 months later. Offline has smacked most of us in the face. 3 have quit, 1 switched to an alt and leveled that, and 2 of us are leveling much slower than the others. 
---
Seriously, don't plan your fun around your friends. You will have around 250 hours to catch them at 60. Don't spend that doing something you dislike.
---
It would be pretty awesome for a warrior using MS I would guess, an amazing PVP weapon
---
This would be the path of least resistance because I dont have the kind of time to commit to 5hr MCs each week.
---
sure thing cringelord
---
No, a good guild pushes for sub 45 min MC clears so we do not bring Ret pallies or meme specs lmao.
---
Brain dead warlock with felhunter &gt; above average skilled mage with full gear
---
Well since I'm feral some of the stuff is bis until AQ/Naxx
---
For healing raids and probably dungeons full resto is worse than ur previous spec (Hotw/ns) been healing MC since week 2 with hotw majority of the time (some moonglow) Raided with another druid who went full resto up untill a few weeks ago and never (9/10) got beaten on the meters
---
It's "pretty awesome" for any class that can use it. (except Hunter)
---
Sure let me go back in time to 2007 and find a prot paladin. We worked with what we had back then.
---
Maybe he's a lone wolf? I mean, i understand him. Its not like this is a MMO game.
---
0 chance, you made a decision, it is not their fault it was not taken with more thought. I am not being mean but they want you to farm more gold and buy the other mount
---
Can confirm, played lolret in vanilla (I healed with 20/0/31 though)
---
Pet rock
---
Whoops, you're right.
---
Really? IF is literally a straight line from AH to Mailbox to Bank. With vendors on either side of the bank.
---
I keep my bank alts in SW because Humans spawn so close to the city and it's just very convenient.
---
It's definitely not the majority of games. Not that I'm not saying it isn't abusive, but it's very easy to disrupt horde trying to do the backdoor jump as it's rather difficult to pull off.
---
Because it hardly lasted any time. Like private servers it will be cleared effortlessly by anyone with time and half a brain
---
SM with 4 carries paying 3g each nets you about 45 per hr
---
This is why dkp is aids. I’d gquit so fast if all the dps warriors/other dps didn’t want upgrades cause of a single weapon. 
---
You even went months without noticing others doing it as well. Sounds like a fun raid when no one wants gear. Reminds me of the rogues in my guild rolling for the Rag cloak instead of just doing UD strat to get a better one.
---
My mouth is as credible as your source.
---
Fight club is name of warrior discord, join it, they have spreadsheets of this stuff
---
Take my advice and wait a week.  Everyone's crowding that quest right now but in a week you will have no competition.
---
Well, there are some choice items from MC at least (the legendary items) but by the time we're in Naxx, MC is going to be like running UD Strat. We started splitting the raid into teams to clear the multiple bosses during Vanilla, I just can't see people doing six day raiding for 12 hours a day in Classic, it just isn't needed, we're all so much better at the game these days. Mostly I am just talking about the idea we will have to spend more time in Classic farming consumables, world buffs, and old raids and how its more involved than "one raid" (they were talking about retail).
---
Can’t ignore the Druid (me) NSing into Root and then casting 2 more roots on two other targets, while some warriors charge and dps gangbangs.  Just scrumptious. Fresh meat 🥩🍖
---
that's 2020 vision
---
That's a really good way to disenfranchise healers though.
---
My favorite line was "You'll get a better weapon in BWL". Okay, there's going to be better gear in TBC too, may as well just wait till then.
---
The best bet is to just let healers know that they won't be rolling on anything that can't be used by DPS, before the raid, not when the item drops.
---
Being a healdin kind of sucks TBH, I'm only allowed to roll on like, three pieces of gear in MC.
---
That’s cute, but it really isn’t
---
Ret pally's arguing about DPS should change classes.  Better time investment, less idiocy.
---
With how long it takes to level and BG’s having been released I’d say it’s as good a time as any to start. You shouldn’t run into any serious issues with getting ganked until around mid 30’s if you even do at all (outside of “natural” WPvP encounters). Ask around in realm discord’s about the server balance/health, pick one, and have fun.
---
The kind that doesn't see the forest because the trees
---
I’m still not 60 yet on my pally and haven’t played a ton but I’ve still managed to farm about 1k gold to fund. Skullflame, flurry axe, demonforged breastplate, and a bunch of other stuff. It’s not too difficult if you’re smart about what you farm. Golden pearls paid off big for me personally.
---
Only if you're not in a group...
---
Just like all the people who said they were gonna get 60 and do all the raids.
---
So if they want him to be a nightfall bot then you probably don't want to give him that thing anyway, holy/warr might want it for pvp
---
sounds good ill send you a message tonight! thanks
---
"i love it when a plan comes together"
---
Getting to 29 is not a lot of time, if you are ally on Blameaux I would help. Level 29 is already a lot better than 10-19 which is all about how hard an imbalance you can create
---
Go to GatherMate2 settings in the addon window. You'll find it.
---
Save them.  After you hit revered, the only rep you’re getting from mobs are from the boss level ones.
---
I feel like I'm one of the core...though maybe I'm not because I'm only lvl 58. It feels like the guild has really been looking forward to me getting to 60 though. I would be the 2nd warlock in the group. They definately lost some of the top dps. The MT and OT and 4-5 healers are still there though. It's been tough though because finding players that are willing to join an 8/10 guild ain't easy.
---
genius idea, provided you have multiple people in your guild crazy enough to make their own Sulfuron Hammer without an Eye
---
If your guild doesn't let casters roll on maidens then you might want to find a new guild.
---
For warriors Bonereaver's Edge is superior to Hand of Rag, also probably to Untamed Blade.
---
All of the raid content is solved shortly after release nowadays. That doesn't mean your average Joe can execute the strategy effectively, particularly when there are 40 of them in a group.
---
OBS is just better and it’s free
---
How is this even a comparison. Sapphiron is better all the way, mana pool is huge in PvP and it offers roughly double the damage while sacrificing minimum resists.
---
the most epic memories I have of WoW are my guilds getting attuned and furthering progression. Finally defeating Kaelthas and joining my servers list of elite guilds in Black Temple is by far the best and most epic moment I have of this game.
---
Or being a druid tank and some shit rogue needs your gear.
---
Hey at least consider the fact the druid is the tank and could've easily found a different dps.
---
That's not the point.  You're carrying a ret pally, they don't contribute.  They give out kings buff.  Even priests and druids out DPS paladins.
---
They affect you massively.
---
Granted that is rarely the case here lol ...
---
How does the fire damage from emperor in BRD work? I was tanking him the other night on a "rescue the princess run." And it seemed to be going ok, then suddenly he just wrecked me. First, he chain stunned me. And then I just took this MASSIVE spike in damage. A flurry of physical attacks, but also a TON of fire damage.  My log showed him doing over 1500 fire damage (6 attacks of 2-300) in less than a second. I don't even think he was in his "big" mode at the time where he goes immune to spells.
---
Still better than yours.
---
I don’t understand the draw of these monitors. I don’t want my eyes to have to zip all over the screen to find my data. Much less my neck and/or torso.
---
Imagine being in av for 30 minutes
---
People see the orange text and think it's some godlike item.  In reality the gold grind to build it is insane and it's a side grade to most of the later BWL weapons.
---
Your guild did the right thing.  It should 100% go to someone who has the hammer ready to go.
---
Which quests? I tried to hand in some items the other day but NPCs were already dead
---
Take days off? Ah. Some no-lifers are going to ruin it for them.
---
I’m glad somebody else noticed.
---
It’s your issue for ever allowing a reg pally into raid.
---
You work as a team to benefit the team best - players want to progress. 
---
These two need to work together but a meme spec fucks all that up.
---
HotW is one of the best specs in the game from what I've seen, crazy good versatility in pvp, raiding, and dungeons.
---
Also wouldn't HotW be better with gear since the int increase scales off added int, whereas moonglow stays the same forever.
---
I'll say moonglow is more fun for things like solo pvp though.
---
Nope - talking about Shroud of Pure Thought from Flamegor.
---
it is not stretched, you can see more to the sides on ultrawide. helps alot with peeking around corners in dungeons
---
It’s not, because this pulls actual data. You are just making an educated guess. Good try though
---
Jesus, the noble knights in this thread. "YoU'rE a SHitTy PerSoN fOr DrInKiNG!!1!" You do you man, I also drink after work. But that's hilarious. I was tanking Strath after a 14 hour gaming session, and I was basically coma pulling trash on UD side. So much so I "came to" at the last pack before the final boss with the party in tears because I would just afk walk forward pulling trash without tanking it. I was nicknamed "Pull-Walker."
---
I can do that. Thank you ! I’m new to Wow I had no idea The event lasts quite some time so I should be able to slap this yeti eventually lol
---
How so? 
---
Aren’t I just competing with people inside my bracket? Like, if there are 50 people on my server grinding out honor like a full time job, wouldn’t that just slightly affect the bell curve?
---
Username checks out.
---
That would be really nice to see, as far as I know our guild does not farm them for our priest, they are told to get it themselves since everyone is busy pvping. Our last priest decided to buy it for 600g instead of getting his epic mount since nobody would help him farm.
---
Right, but mages and warlocks can't wield maces, so there's Aurastone and Lok'amir in MC/BWL respectively.
---
Some typical runs:
---
Arena/Anger- Clears arena and adds to Angerforge boss in BRD. Medium experience. Probably want to be 54-55 minimum as Angerforge and some adds nearby are 56.
---
Prison or BRD aoe group- Clears the initial prison area. 50 minimum. Best exp/hr if you run multiple times, but falls off the higher level you are. These are similar to Jailbreak runs, but those are specifically for Ony attunement.
---
Quest run- Clears through the major quests of the dungeon, including Bael'gar, Shadowforge Key, Coffers and Guzzler. Probably fine to do at your level.
---
Emperor run/Save Princess- Clears the entire dungeon, killing final boss and not the princess. Usually only done once. This is usually the run you get your MC attunement done on as well. Also similar to Lava runs, where you skip a huge portion of the dungeon by swimming through lava.
---
LBRS- Lower blackrock spire. Do this at 55. It sucks but you gotta do it at least once for the UBRS quest.
---
The rest are end game dungeons and really require 58 but can be done as soon as 55. Strat (Live or Undead), Scholo, DM (N W E or tribute). UBRS is a 10 man that you only should do for quests and gear. Outside the quest experience you won't get any relevant experience because of raid penalty.
---
cant relate
---
how do u have 8k mana im in a similar spec with only 6k mana? are u running different gear than u normally would
---
You say this, but then this same faction has you doing what's basically the same quest to cats, puppy's and farmers in hillsbrad later on.
---
There are quite a few forsaken quests for the apothecary's that basically boil down to "Collect these poisons, now go force feed it to innocents FOR SCIENCE!"
---
Arenas eas the best. Can't wait to hear about all those so called multi glads struggling to break 1500.
---
People have been doing it just fine. Just takes coordination/leadership to organize.
---
I've seen APES members just farming gold during mondays/tuesdays while getting bracket 1 honor. Even while taking 2 out of 7 days off completely
---
Good guilds care about MC times and BWL gearing for week 1 clears.
---
Not really, I guess it's because if I ever get to that point, I'll just move on completely. WoW for me was always about the game as a whole, and the time gated/weekly lock-out kinda of content is the least appealing to me. But to each their own I guess, everyone can enjoy it in anyway they please.
---
&gt; It’s your issue for ever allowing a ret pally into raid.
---
Its your issue that you minmax a creampuff game.
---
Hitlerburg*
---
Who are YOU to decide? Serious guilds in a 15 year old game lol. You can pug every raid up to naxx 4 horsemen.  This game is so easy you need to use speed runs to make it more serious? Lol
---
Endurance gives you more sprints, but you only need one to bust outta nova and have a shot to kill a mage, the points are better put into damage. 
---
Idk I always run ruthlessness, maybe I’ll aim without it and see. 
---
Master of deception is gonna get you the opener a lot more than without. You become much harder for lots of classes to target and get outta stealth in that little dead range where they can see you but you’re out of range for the open.
---
"it's not about the journey, it's about the destination" -Zerole00
---
Yes, you get some greys to vendor with chances at greens and blues/epics. You can check for book spawns. But overall, without herbalism, you lose out on a TON of potential gold gains. The guaranteed dreamfoil and gromsblood nodes (2 of each) almost double the gold gains from lasher farming.
---
The most fun I've had in AV was yesterday. Knocking Horde off the bridge with snowballs is a good laugh.
---
I wouldn't consider this situation "winning" by any stretch of the definitions.
---
Westfall-US Horde side
---
There's a few mega-guilds that've formed, but the biggest one was (or is, I'm not 100% sure) is ***Ganked***
---
Ganked seemingly take anything that moves and put them to work, they're on their 4th or 5th MC team despite not even having downed Rag yet
---
For some reason, the guild leader of Ganked left and formed the aptly named ***Properly Ganked***
---
Both guilds now basically spam LFG chat trying to hoover up as many members as they possibly can
---
Wrong again, zoomer.
---
that would be worthy of a screen shot. Unless you post it, we ALL will assune youre full of shit. 
---
tldr: pics or it didnt happen.
---
You may have given it to the wrong person, but a 40 man raid roster needs to donate almost nothing per person to get it completed.
---
Cool, ty
---
Fuck forti. How is endlessly killing level 30s in stv hilarious.
---
You made the comment stating the definition of raiding not me.
---
I think individuals can decide what is fun for them and what raiding is for them.
---
there is an interact with target keybind you can bind to something besides right click
---
PvP Ladder would be neat.
---
Never said it was good, I'd like to see the logs of your prot warriors pulling 350+ every fight though. I just checked APE's mc logs and their prot warriors even doing dps some bosses pull ~250 average.
---
The same way that the horde are evolving their strategy to counter the alliances zerg, the alliance are evolving their strategy to counter the hordes defense.
---
I went from 55-56 literally underwater off the north coast of Azshara to avoid wPVP. Must have had 200 clams, not a single golden pearl was found
---
PVP is every direction from here
---
I just completed the AV rep grind only to realize I spent all my gold on making sapper charges along the way and cant buy anything yet :(
---
Getting to BRM as alliance took 5-8 deaths on average from horde camping thorium point/marshal's refuge. They would often gank you on arrival immediately or have the flightmasters dead.
---
It's a balanced ish server but most of the "it's totally balanced guys!" people are horde who didn't have to contemplate changing to pve realms because the game was unplayable.
---
Several of my friends and guildmates swapped to leveling chars on pve realms because they just couldn't do anything.
---
So yeah, not as balanced as horde likes to say
---
It definitely is the majority of games, probably 80%. I am sure it is easy to disrupt, however most games there is no one defending. Alliance are stuck in the zerg rush meta.
---
It has its own Discord. That's good enough.
---
Exactly.
---
He's not being elitist. You're being salty. 
---
Why are you even posting in a "baby's first mmo" subreddit? Bro...are you a baby? Look everyone, this guy is a baby haha! Say googoo gaga baby.
---
Cool story bro.
---
The enjoyable world pvp is still there, there just isn't server killing zergs running across the world.
---
Oh another *"they aren't playing the way I want them to, Blizzard force them to do something, reeeeee!"* post...
---
brings me back to my runescape days
---
makes sense thanks
---
Sorry, PvP realms don't entail forced team deathmatch gameplay in all settings.  Have you considered making friends who will voluntarily fight by your side in these situations?
---
Imagine having not one, but two ret Paladins in your raid...
---
Ya my raid 1 group has 6 paladins, and raid 2 group 5.  They are the best healers in the game.  It's almost like you can bring a healer paladin that is useful instead of a buff bot auto attacker.
---
Ya the hammer is the hardest part, and if a guildie doesnt even need the guilds help to make this hammer, thats a fucking slam dunk. Your other ret pally is being stupid. If my guild gets that item, im sure it would sit in a bank for a year. My guild has already decided we are going to work together for thunderfury on our main tank, not hand of rag for pvp.
---
Ok Boomer.
---
\&gt;high dps
---
\&gt;ret paladin
---
Does not compute
---
for the most part it is, not anyone but blizzard's fault
---
Yup. Who cares about honor. I want rep. I dont want 100 rep in a 10 min game. Then I'm in que for 10 min.
---
I can get 1200 or higher rep in a 30min match
---
There’s a website just google wow item restore. You don’t need to do anything in game
---
bigfella on whitemane is a warrior
---
I agree that it doesn't matter if you kill it in 1 hour instead of 2 but clearing the raid in one raid night is very important especially when BWL will be out.
---
We clear onyxia + MC in about 2 hours and everyone just loves how they can log off at 11pm instead of playing til midnight
---
There should be
---
Sounds like someones lost all their games against premades lol
---
Holy palys cant get up close to keep wisdow and other things up and gimp themselves bringing out melee dps. A holy paly cant keep up wisdow and nightfall for caster while keeping the melee powerful
---
I'm not genuinely outraged but probably in current day giving you a reward for /kissing a random (non-consenting!) NPC would probably not be approved lol
---
I mean, I play a mage, so I definitely have no reason to be salty about bad specs not getting their due.
---
And I'm here because I like playing a more casual game where I already know all the fights because I don't want to have to play a new game and have to relearn a bunch of mechanics.
---
But I'm also going to be honest about what it is.
---
Use Mirahs. Dal Rend off hand is bad without main
---
Report all you want, it's not an offense.
---
That’s why I main tank as a Warrior in my guild. Much more engaging and more responsibility.
---
Wish they had an option to mark yourself as traveling like credit cards do.
---
Tell him to shut up it will drop again.
---
where's the lie tho?
---
Welcome to Benediction! Honestly, we're not super drama heavy. You get the occasional ninja or what not, but beyond that? People are mostly chill.
---
Lol what kind of a neck beard loser thinks of shit like this??? Report him. Total piece of shit.
---
It's partially true, they were constructs like we see in Uldaman/Ulduar but the Old God's Curse of Flesh turned them in to what we see today.
---
Priest is a fun class in that you can heal, and it's a different dynamic healing versus Warlocking. That being said, I would suggest Warrior since you can see what a different Rogue-style class plays like. Warriors suck until 20, get better until 30/40, then start ripping faces off like absolute mad men.
---
Also fuck Okuser &amp; Lunchmoney
---
I am 1K into revered and also would like to find a discord for Alliance premades. This is so painful. The worst part? Even if I hit exalted right now, there is nothing I can use. Not even the offhands.
---
So why do it? Because there is a chance (to be fair, a reasonable chance) that I might need the offhand in the future, at which point (so I am told) rep will be even slower to get. So therefore I should be doing it now.
---
Stating the definition of raiding? That's a troll right?
---
Is it that much better? I haven't touched my Fairbanks characters since phase 2, hesitant to go back...
---
Get Hide of the Wild or Archivist cloak from Strat Live or Cloak of the Cosmos from DMW. Caster dps who like to PvP will not appreciate you taking Sapphiron Drape.
---
It's just an issue with raid gear in general. When I played from vanilla to Cata I went from free-rolling to DKP and finally loot council.
---
Every single one of those had at least one salty raider that would up and quit the guild even when people were trying to be reasonable. It's just something about purple pixels that gets under people's skin. The more people learned about their class the more bitter they can get about it.
---
I don't hold anything against them, I'm still mad about losing a pair of cloth pants in Kara (that never dropped again until I was in BT) to a shadow priest back in like 2008.
---
What ever it takes for the player to have fun.
---
Legit qeustion here about Alterac Valley; Obviously the meta keeps shifting with this battleground, but I find it really hard to beat Turtles as Alliance. How do you defeat the Horde forces if they choose to have 15+ people defend Drek when we have a group of 30 alliance going South after they kill Galv? Is there a counter to this so I don't have to suck it up and deal with another 30-50 min game of the Horde literally not leaving Drek until their 10-20 man clear Van up North?   
---
And especially if you are a lone Pug, what the heck can I do to help? (Reference GEARED 60 Warlock that knows how to PvP, need Rep for Offhand.)  
---
We have the first 2 to fury wars, the next 2 to tanks and then the last 6 dps warriors gonna have to wait
---
nice bad word filter bruh
---
BUT THIS CAPE IS PURPLE!
---
Druid main. Can confirm. Extremely fun and versatile.
---
I think deathbringer is better for pvp, cause the low speed and huge enddmg.
---
For pve the swords.
---
Sadly enough I was in the middle of this nonsense as Horde. There really was no chance for some alliance.
---
you can't do that in 1.12 client ?
---
I like this one
---
I did the same and I'm happy to sell them for 10 silver.  That is a nice 5x profit of what I paid for them
---
The difference between gamers in 2005 and 2019. And why this game isnt very fun for the veterans
---
This person is just intentionally being difficult because they are prot pally and want everyone to know that prot pallies are tanks just like warriors
---
roflcopters
---
Agree to disagree I guess. Works well for us. We are very casual, but still manage to clear MC with ret paladins, ferals, moonkins and arms warriors every week, and we've usually been under 30 people. We use no world buffs and consumes are not required. 
---
Just saying; content is easy. Find someone you enjoy playing with, and if that is a ret pala then who cares, you'll still clear the content. It's not like he refuses to heal when we ask him.
---
It does depend on the fight, I just checked our logs for last week's Magmadar and our tank did 375.8 dps (we're a pretty average guild). Definitely not every fight though. Top DPS was a 2H Fury doing 730.9.
---
I’m not sure, didn’t play warrior in the old one
---
The screaming warrior party below you monitor distracts me way to much.
---
Don't let the mass of unhappy folks posting their unhappiness deter you from jumping in. I'm playing on Benediction - Alliance and I have encountered so little negativity in-game it honestly makes me question the sanity of all the complainers. 
---
Benediction server is high-pop, evenly balanced, and there are plenty of people questing in all level ranges, as well as plenty of actively recruiting guilds. If you're looking for a North American - Eastern PvP realm, roll here. Horde or Alliance, doesn't matter.
---
There’s a lot of reason why people pick the side those choose and I’d say that PvP racials are lowest.
---
Anyway, what is the point here? We are talking about alliance getting their asses kicked in INSTANCED PVP. That means 40 vs. 40, so Alliance are not outnumbered here. What does being on a PvP realm as horde do anything here?
---
They shouldn't be called concentration camps. All the orcs placed there were under the influence of demonic bloodlust. The alternative was execution, but unlike the first horde, the Alliance of Lordaeron wasn't cool with genocide. So they were really prison camps for war criminals.
---
Yes the timeframe where Metzen had control of lore. We all know Thrall is basically his personal avatar in the series. He tried to make it into the usual noble savage vs corrupt civilization trope but couldn't paper over the flaws of the Horde that ultimately revealed Thrall's philosophy to be a minority opinion.
---
I'm a geared tank and I reserve boes solo but if I am having trouble getting healers under such conditions I have healer friends I do it with.
---
I actually find the groups are just as good as normal. It's just a bitch to get tanks for Strat UD because all tanks want to go live.
---
I get a craaaaazy amount of boes at UD. I guess I'm just lucky.
---
Like destro?
---
Did you find a pet to be more helpful than others? I have a cat currently.
---
&gt;(Total **chars** recorded: 3,367,477)
---
Characters including every single bank alts, craft alts, gather alts... Such good data for to reaffirm your hypocrisy. 
---
I don't see any horde exodus happen like Ally's Flamelash.
---
I never missed any at 200 fishing 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Haha thats a great strat
---
Honorspy can't give you a weekly overlook to plan for months in the future, and also from most knowledge and things that i've seen, people refer to Bracket 1 or Top Bracket as the highest. HonorSpy does it differently.
---
We both hit 60 within the first 2 weeks of launch 😅
---
Die insect
---
need this for my threat mitigation pvp shadow resist naxx raid hogger killing spec soz hunters.. also ill take that crossbow to match my red boots
---
To be fair, I deleted at least 20 of them while I was leveling too - knowing that they'd jump in price at this time.  I didn't want them taking up bank space for that long, and honestly they're not worth that much even right now.  
---
On the flip side, if I was starting a new character on a new server right now, you bet I'd be farming and selling them as much as possible to carve out as much meager profit as I can.  At 60 as a hunter, there are other farms more worth while than selling small eggs right now.
---
21:9 is fine for everything
---
im never going back,
---
Meanwhile im getting 310+ without consumables in fire spec as a mage KEK
---
For hunter PVE DPS; 
---
Barbarous Blade or Lok'Delar?
---
Is the 1% crit, 15 int and 26 stam worth the 60AP in PvE?
---
You must be specially gifted to think "characters" in a MMORPG means 1 account. 
---
Is there horde exodus on Heartseeker?
---
From most of my past history i've seen Bracket 1 or Top Bracket referred to as to highest and hardest to get, HonorSpy just does it differently.
---
I would include Leatrix Plus over Speedy. It gives you a few more options as well.
---
I don't see why everyone suffers. Explanation?
---
I'm more referring to the times he'd jump into 1v5s against other alliance just to snipe a kill in the arena, kill a bank alt in org knowing he'd get camped by the entire city, battle rez fellow alliance to let me kill them again, and willingly losing (probably) thousands of rep with neutral cities just to kill some lowbie that doesn't net him any gain because they emoted at him or something.  
---
But I'm also biased, a lot of Druids tended not to kill other Druids back then and he's a big part of why I got my AGM trinket.
---
Kromkrush. Can confirm same thing.
---
okay, link it then? "decent" doesn't mean good. but lets see your 310+ fire spec. better be using fire spells too
---
So, what you do inside AV doesn't matter?
---
You can achieve the same result with  triple-monitor setup... it was a big thing before ultrawide appeared on the market. 
---
Ultrawide just removes the monitor-frames so nothing spoils your view.
---
It looks real cool, someday ill have money for one too. :)
---
It is more technical than MC, and Vael is a hard gear check. More encounters that one mistake can wipe things, etc.
---
It won't be problems in knowledge, but with execution.
---
Uhuh, okay. Sick argument.
---
Can't play MS in raids though, need that debuff slot for something useful, and a fury warrior with dal rends will do more damage than an arms warrior with HoR anyways.  
---
It is great for PvP for sure though.
---
So you demand source and now whine when i throw it on you. Typical hypocrite horde.
---
Who said anything about 1 character = 1 account? 1 character = 1 participant in this context.
---
&gt; Is there horde exodus on Heartseeker?
---
Not great on druids either.  Would be great for my fire res set for the BWL drakes, but that is a pretty expensive way to get 30 fire res lol.
---
I've farmed about 6000g so far on my mage alt just doing zf/laser farms with herbalism
---
Dme
---
Untamed blade with proc up is the strongest 2h weapon in the game per the nerds on the warrior discord. The proc rate on that weapon will dictate this debate.
---
I’d imagine you’d have to be very geared and coordinated to do that. I’ve done it with a priest and pally, with me being a warrior. Three Manning it with the pally tanking occasionally but ultimately I ended up tanking the last boss since I had an easier time reducing damage and holding threat. Ret pally was dpsing lel this was a while ago and I’ve gotten much more geared same with the pally. Once I get some more tanking or dps gear from MC I’ll try and get my pally buddy to see if he wants to try and two man it.
---
Currently, at least what I've witnessed as an Ally during the weekend is that it's a 50/50 if the Ally go Drek only or Galv -&gt; Drek. The only issue is that, if there is a Horde Turtle waiting all the way at Drek, they will simply wipe us out and we will respawn by Balinda. 
---
ALly say to simply run to your corpse and hope the FW GY is capped by then (They get counter capped by turtle horde) so you waste your time running in ghost form.
---
After that, the Ally goes silent, people start leaving, and we're running around like chickens with their head's cut off getting picked off, waiting for the BG to end, or we get bottle necked North, they summon the Ice Elemental, bam we lose. 
---
Horde eventually win.. after 40 minutes, 70-80% of the time because the Drek strat is a bust since we just hit a deathwall of horde who have the GY advantage down south. 
---
I'm just at a loss because that's all the Ally can do (that I'm aware of) to actually win. If there is a turtle, well shit, it's over lol
---
I'm going to go min/max this body at the gym. I'm step out of this discussion.
---
yea a paladin friend sent me your video about a year ago showing how you kept charges while on your mount - are you playing classic now? i just sent you a PM about the paladin theory crafting discord - come and join us :)
---
I'm just shocked you have TWO ret paladins...
---
Enjoy your pixels, which are the exact same as mine? You started this weird discussion dude.
---
There is also something arong abput arcane shot hunters.
---
For lightweight I think Nvidia shadowplay is the king now if you have a Nvidia GPU
---
Ret Pally is a real class?
---
&gt;Who said anything about 1 character = 1 account? 1 character = 1 participant in this context.
---
1 participant = 1 account
---
&gt; Yes
---
Not really.. +healing is definitely more valuable on a pally than crit. 
---
Pallys are already the most efficient healing class and shouldn’t be going OOM on fights. Increasing healing throughput is more important than getting 35 mana back from a crit heal. Crits also contribute to more over healing so benefits of a crit heal are also wasted there too.
---
MB is way more valuable on a caster DPS as that actually speeds up clear times and l, as it is currently, MB is a greater increase from their pre-raid BIS (+14sp caster weapon versus a +31 healing mace pallys get)
---
If the goal is gear, none of the effort is worth it.
---
If you raid for gear, there are 2 possible outcomes:  
---
1. You get your gear quickly, and then have run the raid forever without any benefit while waiting for the rest of the guild to gear up.
---
2. You are one of the last ones to get geared, and you are frustrated that you aren't getting any items.
---
IMO, the only way to stick with it is to enjoy the social aspects of raiding (including the joy of reaching/killing bosses), while treating loot as a nice side reward.
---
I play alliance and horde alike LOL. If that’s your argument you really are dumber than you’ve posed.
---
And let’s rewind, you cum-frothing inbred. You included someone’s OBSERVATION from ONE SERVER. Really pulling in the data that way aren’t ya? Thanks for the structured assessment.
---
Download pally power. It's one of the most useful addons for a paladin and is really a must have. It shows players pets but it doesn't seperate hunter pets from warlock minions which can be annoying if you want one to have might and the other to have wisdom.
---
I mean we have ALL thought about Tauren on gnome amirite
---
We took about 4 hours and got every priest in the guild one to ensure we all will have the staff as soon as we can. Really not hard unless another group is really farming at the exact same time.
---
It can be obnoxious to farm shards, but AV makes it pretty easy. Head to the mine right at the start and farm those mobs for a couple minutes. They have low hp and many can be pulled individually.
---
Really solid line of thinking there
---
If you have a recent Nvidia graphics card and use geforce it always copies the last 2 minutes and you can just click a button and save it.
---
Apparently, yes.
---
It ain’t much but it’s honest work
---
Just wait a few lvl and get sword from sm quest
---
I tried Nature's grace for awhile.  It just wasn't proving out for me in our raid group.  Swiftness, i assume you mean Nature's Swiftness, none of the recommended Raid healing builds shows taking it, so i never took it.  
---
Honestly, i don't see the value in it.  Every 3 minutes, i can instantly cast an HT or Regrowth?  No thank you.  Give me an instant cast Nature Spell at half mana cost every 3 minutes, and I'll sacrifice a point somewhere for it.
---
LOL.  Is he at least a tank so he can use it in his fire res set?
---
Yeah I’d love to share my MC plate/dps loot with scrub pallys who get 1/4th the use out of it. It’s too bad I rolled horde and have to wait a while extra day for AV loot. Man what was I thinking?
---
barb blade in raid. Lok while pvping and I prefer it for the mana/stam soloing DMT.
---
Wtf a guild bidding for an ony bag... I’ve seen pugs do that but not guilds. Also we have a few people gamble on raid nights which is fun and entertaining to watch but our raid leader does not participate. He is all for the progression of our raid team as a whole. He’s one of the few people in the guild that actually does his role and really well at that.
---
Cause Uk (english) realms are mostly international realms full of psurver guilds and players who have little bit different perception and understanding of the game compared to casual language realm guys who play with their girlfriends and nephews. But the fact that realms are separated by language but we are all thrown in the meat grinder together is enough reason. Battlegrounds are communication and organization. I speak english. How to communicate with ppl who do not speak English?
---
then move the interface closer to the middle? :P 
---
It just gives you a wider view into the gameworld....  you  dont have to turn the camera as much.
---
Especially useful for simracing, in real racing you easily have 180 degrees of view because of your  eyes but in simracing its usually restricted to monitor size (most have triple-screen setups so they can see better  to the sides)... some race with VR-goggles but having a wide-monitor is cheaper and sometimes even a better option.
---
phase 5 because blizzard
---
What is your addon for tower/graveyard timer ? Thanks :)
---
https://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/heartseeker/50
---
&gt; But the pally who didnt get it argues it was his because he is higher dps more often.  
---
The easy response is.... not anymore
---
Yeah once the Zerg rush is broken, most ally simply give up or don't have a counter play at all once we get wiped. It's a slow eventual loss since no one doesn't communicate what to do.
---
Not a single person on the Alliance side had on any type of unit plates so they could see you capping?
---
Yeah I can see that, MCP + druid threat is just nuts though.  I know that not all bosses are best tanked by a druid, but for initial burst its stupid how fast we threat up.
---
Is that the caster ring? If so I just hit exalted to find out it doesn't come until phase 5... feels real bad.
---
Because the content was fresh
---
I didn't mind playing til midnight for my first few MC clears in classic I definitely don't want to do it everyweek I'm glad we're done by 11pm
---
It'll be fun to raid multiple time a week til midnight when new raids come out tho but not for months.
---
Rank 14 whit 80k honor/day?
---
My sweet sweet summer child, you have no idea lol
---
Yeah it’s pretty great for Boomkins
---
Having more salvs for Vael might actually make them worth their spot.  Enabling warriors to reck-execute on that fight without worrying about threat makes it much much easier.
---
Its all about your level of play. Telling all speedrunners they all arent enjoying the game is like telling labron james he would have more fun in a rec league.
---
When I hate someone in my group or think they’re terrible (Usually if they cause multiple wipes or ninja or something) I just add them to my ignore and finish the dungeon. Reputation is important and all that.
---
My friend however just starts cussing them out and is getting a bit of a reputation....
---
speedrunsplits
---
A player who is only online at designated raid times.
---
Yeah I have it already
---
Claw is a 15% drop rate so it’s much harder to get. There are also DPS checks in BWL so it’s better to give MB to caster DPS now so you can actually progress through BWL to see mace, claw, and staff drop
---
Loot council is even more effective when a core is already carrying a raid with their prep, knowledge, farming of pre-bis, and performance.  I think you have this misunderstood, these people should be counciled gear first unless there is someone that is also pulling their own weight outside of just showing up and being a warm body.
---
If he’s ally it’s 39 for vanquisher’s.
---
He wrote it from the perspective of a warrior, but the same thing applied to druids and paladins, quit being so dense.
---
Don Julios band is released. The caster ring is not
---
I'd boot someone for using the word "toxic" unironically, so there ya go.
---
Looks like someone is sliding down Santa's chimney tonight
---
Donny J's is the melee ring, and it's in right now.
---
Donny Ro's is the caster ring with spell penetration, and it will be out p5 with AQ unless Blizzard listens to these complaints.
---
Try to find BRD groups around your level. You will likely have the same goals in mind.  At this point you can probably benefit from all of them, and after a bit you will figure out what they are.
---
Ret pallies can't even sit in the melee group on rag. Being a part of a guild is about contributing, if you roll as a ret you are actively saying that you don't care about helping the guild in any way.
---
I dont use firespells on most bosses, just blast wave and fire blast sometimes :) dont have a link as our guild doesnt log
---
We're literally in a thread about AV, not the capital cities. Also, no one in my guild is flasking because MC is on farm, but when we move back into progression, healers are expected to flask too.
---
The healthstone isn't a good comparison because you still need to gather soul shards to craft them. That would be like demanding leather from skinners.
---
And yeah, my flair is inaccurate. Due to duo leveling my warlock, my solo alt priest has far exceeded my warlock which was my originally intended main.
---
Everything is lost.  It is all coming to an end.  You have no hope in enjoying a game by playing it at your own pace.  The game will be in the burning crusade by the time you get to black rock depths.  also, this is very classic like, because not many people got their first character to level 60 before 2007.
---
*accidentally right clicks him while trying to grab a quest*
---
LOOKS LIKE MEATS BACK ON THE MENU BOYS
---
Druids aren't given enough credit for how amazing they are. There are tradeoffs sure but damn they are good at doing certain things. We actually used a druid MT until our warriors got some gear. We still keep 2 ferals in raid to help tank.
---
&gt; Raiding isnt about how fast you can clear it. Jesus enjoy the game  
---
It is. Guild who spend first month on hardcore raiding and get all loot possible, will be free for next 3-4 months until new raid tier come out. While guilds who "have fun" would be still gearing and clearing for all 6 months.
---
I have a mana set and a healer set :) thats why :p
---
right right
---
I'm a lv. 16 hunter right now (not new to the game, but somewhat new to the class) - could I hit 60 in 3 weeks from now playing a reasonable amount? (6-8 hours a day).
---
Heartseeker is NA. Flamelash and Heartstriker are eu.
---
I think an Arms Warr gets a slot for Blood Frenzy debuff iirc?  But it's been a while.  I made the transition from Prot to DPS at the end SWP and I'm pretty sure I was just the BF bitch, but maybe that was just my guild.
---
I play rsham so correct me if Im wrong. Isnt aurastone hammer better for hpallies?
---
Don Julio is available. Don Rodrigo is not.
---
People min-maxing their raid teams right now aren't doing it for MC/Ony, they're doing it so that they can smoothly and quickly clear AQ40/Naxx.
---
Whats the actual resolution?  I saw another post on launch week that someone had a similar setup, but a much larger resolution / viewable area vs regular screens. 
---
Wouldnt this be a competitive advanced in PVP?
---
It’s simple, really.  Kick out both ret memes out and replace with literally anything else.  Or don’t and raid with 38.  There won’t be any noticeable difference.
---
brb let me teleport back to wc3 era and tell thrall he’s doing it wrong with his hammer
---
Lol doesn't help that some horde side guild leaders are straight up dicks and can't be bothered try to work with other guild leaders so this is what happens I guess.
---
Lol don’t worry about it dude, especially if y’all didn’t wipe. I got killed my first Ony run cause I misunderstood how the pathing on the deep breaths worked, clarified what I should’ve done with some guildies after and runs have been smooth ever since. 
---
Also, as others have said, the transition to phase 3 is probably the hardest part with tank having to get threat back. Figure out where you’re supposed to go once she starts coming down next time. even then, it might not have been your fault as it is pretty easy for a dps to turn her the wrong way and get you killed.
---
If everyone can speak enough english to communicate proper why there are separate language specific realms?
---
I'm here because I like Vanilla WoW so I'm enjoying replaying it at a high level. I've replayed plenty of video games that I've enjoyed over the years, single player games, open world's, multiplayer focused, etc.. 
---
It's fun bumbling through a game, learning as you go, and ultimately raising your skill. However it's also fun having that skill and knowledge to start with and playing the game at peak efficiency. 
---
The only reason that I'm playing Classic WoW, or any game after the first few hours is because I love the game. Not playing a game because I'm unwilling to learn new mechanics is a completely alien concept to me. If retail wow wasn't a steaming pile of shit I would happily jump into it and learn new mechanics, the thing is, retail wow is a steaming pile of shit and I don't like it.
---
You ever play Zelda breath of the wild? I would get more enjoyment replaying that game while cheesing it to get the ancient armor early on and completing objectives faster, then doing a no armor naked run. But I wouldn't enjoy playing the new Breath of the Wild that hasn't come out yet more.
---
Bringing ret pallies to a raid is like doing a naked Zelda run, it just gimps your progress. And since I view retail wow is a flaming pile of shit, there is no equivilent to BoTW 2 in wow terms. So I'm enjoying min maxing classic and parsing high while killing bosses quickly and efficiently.
---
If a person without DMB will handle head - you won't get this notification at all.  
---
It's not in the game, it's just DBM communicate with eachother.  
---
P.S. IIRC it was disabled when Blizzard modified how addons could communicate though custom channels.
---
&gt;purple
---
We're talking orange here buddy
---
Well the problem is that you have to be almost standing on someone for their nameplate to appear.
---
Yeah it kind of sucks. If people knew a bit more, they would realize quest turn ins are actually quite good rep, killing an enemy player is easily 5+rep for everyone in the BG when their loot is turned in. It doesn't sound like much, but wiping their raid once is over 200 rep which is more than you get for losing. But I have found nobody does these quests when horde turtles, and most of them aren't active as the quest givers never get triggered or are killed on their way in.
---
I comes before O?   So alphabetical hierarchy in the event of a tie when using group loot?  Interesting
---
shamans are supposed to be chill and down to earth. and possibly high. they’re shamans....
---
PVP, I’ve seen a ton too, but PVE wise I see a lot of guilds recruiting spots for Resto and ele shamans
---
haha, I jokingly used that as the reason why I should get it.  Troll the server and laugh at all the rage whispers.  
---
I wouldn't be willing to spend that much gold to troll though, so gonna have to give it to someone that it is slightly more "useful" for.
---
There is nothing to show your skill in pve now except speedrunning. And speedrunning is lame as fuck.
---
Dam any tips for a lone 54 to push to 60 ? Find grinds really draggin my feet
---
| They just don't bring anything important to the raid
---
Excuse me but as a mage that Hand of Salvation is the only thing keeping me alive in every boss fight.
---
My girlfriend and I play priest and paladin together and have a ton of fun! It's maybe not the fastest thing ever, but with how many heals and Shields and stuff we can get out of some VERY sticky situations. She's brand new to the game, so that's a big plus for us. For vets leveling alts something like warrior/priest sounds like a good way to make a rewarding class (warrior) less miserable to level early while not being too easy.
---
You stupid fucking cunt, lying through your teeth: https://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/flamelash/50
---
[Avatar of Flame](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=15636/avatar-of-flame)  
---
&gt;Surrounds the caster in flames for 10 sec., giving the caster magic immunity and the ability to inflict 170 to 230 Fire damage to an enemy on attack.
---
Yeah but still its a battleground its designed for pvp and when people then complain about pvp, they should rethink what they are doing there! Best for honor is probably premade wsg atm.
---
There's another way to do it where you have to kill the one other at entrance
---
Keep losing your fight then my dude. I didn't say anything about trinkets or gear. I'm telling you to pop a potion and you're saying they're too much variables to consider??? What??? Don't assume that people won't use consumables, that's why you're losing these fights.
---
If you’re guild is in progression  or new, you care a little bit about stamina.  Full Pre raid BiS is a glass cannon with like 2.5k hp unbuffed but like 600 healing.  All the int and healing don’t matter if you’re dead.
---
Only shows up when you’re exalted
---
Those aren't decent numbers.
---
Unfortunately, in a good guild, deadweight won't really start to show until AQ40, and be a complete detriment in Naxx.
---
Yea definitely a tough position, I don't envy you that. Especially if you've been waiting a while to actually play with this person.
---
Maybe so, but if they were min/maxing then the only purpose of the Eye is PVP. DW fury is the optimal warrior spec for raid dps &amp; they would reject an Arms warrior just as much as they would a Ret paladin in a min/max raid.
---
So you give the hammer to the person who did the work. In this case it happened to be a paladin. If it was a shammie or a warrior it would be the same story, they did the work for the toy that has no place in a min/max raid so they get the big thump toy.
---
Druid + Rogue is fun. That is what my friend and I are leveling currently. It is that nice combo of a melee+healer, and has the added benefit of both classes being able to stealth.
---
&gt;(tanks often do more than they do) 
---
If I kicked everyone of our dps who did less than our top tank then we'd have 14 people in our raid. Some guilds just don't have the options.
---
I like german people
---
I do like it
---
&lt;Horde&gt; Mankrik US - I'm feral durid who has pre raid BiS LF casual raiding to become a raid logger. I have successfully off tanked Garr
---
I know right
---
Are you an apes member or just an ape?
---
Thanks for responding, though I'm not sure you understood my question. The DBM notification doesn't do much for me. I'm interested in just knowing that an Ony Head was dropped at 10:00am EST so that another buff will not happen before 4:00pm EST ( i think it's 6 hours? ) Then I an login after 4 and sit around Org and hope a head is dropped.
---
I actually debated lol
---
and?
---
Yeah, Blade may be debatable, but Hand of Rag is definitely not PvE BiS.
---
All it takes to rank right now is be curious enough about AV to queue up for a game or two.  I tend to believe honorspys numbers.  Especially since I installed it on Saturday, not a lot of opportunity for it to get out of date yet.  
---
The people who are going for R14 tend to all make the push at once, I would be pretty shocked if the server doesn't have the max number of R14s possible nearly every week.  Pretty rare for a R13 to give up at that point.

Reddit often devolves into being a Yelp when it comes to games. As in you either have fanatical support or people swearing x game is the worst thing ever. There's issues with the game, various servers, and playerbases, but for the most part *this is a classic WoW experience and you're likely to have a good time if you enjoyed classic WoW.* 
---
I would indeed do some research about servers before choosing one - but don't let toxic complaints desuade you from choosing a particular server if you think it's the one for you. Something to really keep in mind is that your reputation (even in classic with 15-20k servers) **does** matter a lot. As you level you will have good and bad dungeon experiences. You will see which guilds have a good reputation and which have a shitty one. 
---
With battlegrounds released, any PVP server is now much more tolerable. A few weeks ago it was indeed miserable. 
---
Use wowhead classic for just about EVERYTHING.
---
&gt;Balance competition Blizz, balanced competition....
---
Blizzard don't decide if the majority pick Horde or Alliance. This blaming Blizzard for everything is getting ridiculous.
---
Or if you want to DPS you can roll a class that has more than meme DOS specs?
---
&gt; You seem unable to store long term memory, classic character of a horde.
---
Are you admitting you were dropped on your head as a child?
---
X is a multiplication sign )  
---
All pets of same level and loyalty have same amount of points.
---
For level 60 pet with level 6 loyalty it's 300 points.  
---
For level 1 pet with level 1 loyalty it's 0. If pet already know some skills, they would be subtracted from this, so you could get a pet with -100 points.
---
Yeah they do poor DPS, but they can hit the DPS threshold to down any fight in the game. I would rather have a Ret that doesn't die and knows what they are doing then a mage that dies half the time.
---
I asked about this in a post, and got awesome answers to make myself a mini guide. It’s under my recent posts if you want to check it out!
---
And now I'm at the gym. I'm a interesting dude I hear
---
Yep, I was talking solely about two-handed weapons.
---
The hell are you on about now?
---
I’m all about personal choices and freedoms, hard thing to disagree with but obviously do you bro. Good luck!
---
I choose when and where I want to fight.
---
Part of the reason is because when I log for a few hours to play I don't want to have to spend it bailing out asshats that think playing on a PVP server means attacking anything and everything they can.  Can't tell you how many times a level 35 (for example) player of my faction attacks a level 40 or 41 of the opposing faction, gets owned (as they should) - and then cries for everyone to come help them.  No - how about you learn what battles to fight and which ones not to.
---
To the OP - as soon as you start paying for my subscription you can tell me what to do with my time in the game.  There are tons of things to do on a PVP server other than PVP.
---
I additionally choose the rage costs as the macros name, so I can always see how much rage an ability costs in the action bar. I mean I now know, but it's usefull for beginners.
---
I do 500+ dps as a ret paly on rag. But OKAY
---
Nope aurastone is 32 spell and mana per 5. Crit heals make pally heals free to cast
---
I'm at the gym right now brotha.
---
shhhh =D
---
Meanwhile my guild has 0 onslaught girdle 0 BRE 0 Spinal Reaper 0 eye of sulfuras. Also literally 0 eyes of divinity. NOTHING but hunter leaf since our first clear. 
---
We're inundated with mage blades and staffs of dominance though I guess
---
Depending on what you came from this could be life changing lol...  If you have a busted 22" to that... Significant changes hehe.
---
Enjoy your brown horse.
---
Sounds like only one here that needs to read the lore is you.
---
Thanks for the blog post, OP.
---
as of last night when I went to bed 705k
---
Are you kidding me.... this is amazing. I could see a WoW animated show where each episode is different. This would be the first one.
---
Why do you guys turtle. Just let it happen.
---
updated with his side
---
Without wanting to sound mean, maybe the reason you can't find 40 consistent raiders is that you would invite extremely suboptimal builds like it's nothing.
---
I am not part of the "if you don't come to flask, a completely 100% optimum build and everything, including blue items, enchanted get the fuck out" crowd but...you know...there are some limits.
---
I wasn't asking you what *you* enjoy.
---
I was able to clear the entire SM Cath sub-zone in right about the same time as respawn. It's best to keep your eye on respawn. Cathedral has a ton of solo pulls, but there are some doubles that can be quite challenging. You can "split" those pulls if you kill 1 mob, then feign death, and go back and kill the second one a few minutes later.  Then they will respawn a few minutes apart. 
---
But remember you don't need a group to reset an instance, you can just run out and reset by yourself. The only time you have to do group reset tricks is with big one-way zones like dire maul, Maruadon, etc.
---
If you get a double Myrmidon pull, I'd recommend avoiding that. Pretty much impossible to kill without kiting around the pond, they will shred your pet.
---
well they don't help me I use other parts of the addon
---
Wasnt saying you are one of them, referring to the biggest % of it
---
They were probably confusing it with the paladin quest.  That one involves a pretty lengthy event.0
---
Like Elmo
---
Nobbel87 for sure!
---
I remember a clip of a Rag kill ages ago where a Mage was the last man standing and just nuked rag down while the guild screamed and cheered.
---
All guild premades
---
Fucking animals.
---
There's no way ingame to know when Ony head was handed. 
---
One possible solution - have a bot online 24/7 that will sit in city and write this info when someone hand head. You could then post this information on your local server and check from work :)
---
Hell ya
---
Do you mean Blessing of Salvation? That's not a Ret-only spell though.
---
"From a certain point of view..."
---
I didn't pass out... It was a brief lapse of consciousness.  Far enough for me to walk from the last pack to inside aggro range of Garr.   Also after drinking for 7 hrs or so I'd think even you may slip for 7-8 seconds...
---
&gt;I can't stress enough how important this is to the quality of the bg's for everyone.
---
Rofl ok mate. ALL of the people i've encountered so far know enough english to communicate with basic stuff that people can understand like writing "SH bunker ally def" or "flag tunnel", which is more than enough.
---
Also tbc wasn't heavily time gated until Sunwell.  The base game launched with Karazhan, Gruul's Lair, Magetheridon's Lair, SSC, TK, and Hyjal.  Three raid tiers and most players didn't get into Hyjal until Black Temple was released.  That's how every expansion should be.
---
Yeah im not exalted and i still get insta q as ally. Is just that theres more horde than alliance.
---
Pretty much and but having herb makes it even better :)
---
"I like turtles"
---
Def did this on my priest.... many many times....
---
We cared very much about time to clear in vanilla, after all we had 4 40 mans and 2 20 mans to run every week.
---
So you can't even admit you have advantages in pvp. 
---
Yeah everyone and their mums on pvp picked Horde because of shits and giggles. Also somehow on PvE server, somehow shits and giggles magically disappear and there are more alliance than horde. I wonder why.
---
Anyone else instinctively trying to press the enter battle button?
---
Is there anything to counter fear? Like a trinket, potion, etc
---
cool, thanks!
---
Well not in PvP which is what 2h weapon debates for Warriors revolve around.
---
Spam Arena/Angerforge/Golem all day everyday
---
Capping SH doesn't = turtle and not capping it doesn't not = turtle. 
---
The point of not capping it is so that alliance spawns in the middle of the map and has to choose to run all the way to the top or all the way to the bottom. While they're running they're not killing and so that's valuable time. 
---
If that GY is capped they spawn either really close to their base or really close to their offensive push and they can start fighting immediatly. 
---
Whether it's a fast game or a slow game it's not smart to cap SH. If you don't cap it it splits the Alliance forces and leaves more of them wasting time. 
---
It has nothing to do with speeding the game up or not, it's just basic battle tactics that helps in almost every AV game regardless of strat.
---
Maybe they want to chat in their own language on general/trade chat, which is 'forbidden' on english servers. Or they want to play in a national guild, and having a nation/language specific server allows them to organize stuff like that easier. Or maybe there is just demand and blizzard is meeting that demand. If there were 200k turkish players playing classic wow and they spammed forums about how they want turkish servers and threathen about cancelling their sub if blizz doesn't create one, maybe there would be a turkish server aswell without any specific reason at all.
---
(I'm not implying people spammed on forums to get language based servers. I don't know why they have it. Maybe they did spam, maybe they didn't)
---
There are certain bad luck yeets. It sounds like you just got unlucky. Don't overthink it. Try and stand somewhere else on your next run. But also make sure you /range 11 so you don't yeet other players and vice versa.
---
I also love, even though it's not Danny:  
---
"C'mon Richardson, you're being a tool, man..."  
---
"There's no tool...in this pool...."  
---
Which then leads into the best montage in the whole movie later on.
---
Dwarf priest
---
Druid
---
Warlock
---
I can't imagine thinking this let along actually posting it
---
I hope one of ours won't be too proud/selfish to be the Nightfall bot.
---
/r/yourjokebutworse
---
Oh I know, as the content gets harder (AQ/Naxx) our shadows/rets may switch to healing. But somebody still gotta swing the nightfall.
---
I know ours aren't, they are super committed. One of yours will I'm sure.
---
Jump runs are 50g an hour easily.  60 hours gets you there
---
This is similar to saying “I’d rather have a ret that does more damage than a mage than a mage that does less damage than a ret.”
---
Like yeah, if you find some way to balance the large, objective, numeric disadvantages with specific IRL advantages then bring the ret.
---
I’d rather have a ret that is able to complete raid mechanics than a mage that purposefully sabotages raids.
---
I’d rather have a ret that presses their buttons than a fury warrior who is afk all raid.
---
I’d rather have a mature ret player that helps with guild leadership than a mage played by a 5-year-old
---
That doesn’t really contribute to conversations about rets though
---
I'm not a piece of shit, I don't drink for 7hrs straight.
---
So it is bugged counting as both, but orcs shouldn't resist it? That lowers Orcs op-ness quite a bit in PvP, alting a tauren shaman/undead warrior just became a lot more attractive!
---
and if it happens he'll be back here within a few hours whining about queue times.
---
I like it
---
"The level 14 tauren druid player" 
---
Murder him
---
Ugh I know actions having consequences sucks. 
---
Or maybe his guildies didn’t want a racist around. Why would that bother you?
---
RIP.  Sorry my friend.  
---
Only way queues get solved is if Blizz mergers all Battlegroups.  Otherwise AV will die.
---
Do you always take everything you read so literally?
---
Pick two classes with different gear requirements (mail/plate and cloth/leather) so that you're not competing for gear.
---
What are the dimensions? If you stained this you could get a lot for it on Etsy or it'd make a great wall piece.
---
I was exalted days ago and earn ~150k honor/day.
---
My premade lost one game in the past week I think? And that's because our main tank went afk to watch the UFC title fights.
---
So yeah shut the fuck up scrub you have no idea what you're talking about lol.
---
This is Bubblegrl from Benediction, isn’t it? She has spinal reaper already....
---
The grinds the grind. at least its guaranteed. You need about ~100+ AV's to get exalted which means 18 hours of at least being in queue and about 30+ hours of being in AV. 
---
The players that did this day 1 did have much faster queue times and games which cut down on it a lot.
---
Gz.. though that - is a horrendous monitor lol
---
If you want to be server first, you’re screwed.  If you want to play casually, it’s worth it, there are casual guilds recruiting now (mine is one of them)
---
I'm not making a joke - everyone is mad today about anything. People enjoy and go out of their way to be mad. We have a very angry society
---
I don't see the problem with this, really. What if your primary gaming rig is a virtual machine, say through Shadow PC Gaming? You're kind of doing the same thing, are you not?
---
Yuck. I would be 100%
---
Yeah, I never seem able to get a DM group together
---
Chinese gold farmers are making a killing with classic. Half my guild's raiders bought gold.
---
I want to go there, I want the range item with +hit, rare to see groups going
---
Nice flair
---
You can definitely get enough with a basic blue set like [full devout](https://classic.wowhead.com/gear-planner/priest/undead/AjwAAUE1AjNVA0E3BUEyBkE4B0E2CEEzCUE5CkE0CzEBDC4wDTaQDjKCTzRKAw0QM8ESNnI).
---
I've been able to get them with no mining or herb.  What class are you?
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4328/spider-belt
---
Item rack it; 30 min cooldown; can be had for 2.5g on my server.
---
ele shaman to dps/heal &amp; warrior to windfury explode on stuff.
---
&gt;I speak english. How to communicate with ppl who do not speak English?
---
Warrior, I am a miner too
---
If you parse well and beat a lot of your guildies in DPS then your guildies are doing something wrong
---
I'm currently healing as 0/31/20 (and a fair number of the "20" are in the tank talents)
---
I know I'm not going to be topping any meters, and my guild doesn't need/expect me to... well I do try for 1 meter. I try to top the "decurse" meter any time that's relevant because I'd rather the other healers be healing, and the mages be DPS'ing.
---
I play the druid purely as a support class although I do plan on going full tank as soon as my priest is old enough to join the MC runs :D
---
But as a full support class I try to anticipate OOM's and hit our big healers with an innervate ahead of schedule. I try to keep my BRez open for a tank/healer that needs it in a critical moment. And I will toss out rank 4 healing touches all night long (and rejuvs on the warlocks) I also don't fight our other druids for BiS stuffs, and I'll wear the cenarion leftovers until everyone else is topped up. But I do roll on the occasional tank piece as long as our actual tanks don't need it. It'll take me a bit longer to gear up than other classes, but I'm in it for the long run, I don't expect to be BiS everything like my 4th week of raiding. 
---
But we've been 1 shotting Ony with 25+ people every time she's been up for a while now, and as a group we're killing Rag pre-submerge on 2-2.5hour MC clears. (Or if he does submerge it's at like 8% health, and we clean him up pretty quickly after the sons have been dealt with)
---
AQ Mount is ugly IMO, so I'm not particularly concerned.
---
I mean most serious guilds do give it out as a pvp weapon. We had it rolled among palas/warriors who played pvp and were serious about completing it. Dunno why you should be forced to waste the money for mats before you actually get the eye.
---
Can we also separate the whites from the coloreds?
---
^/s
---
Wow never seen someone so salty over losing with a premade... I guess this makes sense though
---
You can reflect fear?!
---
so wait someone like Payo could technically be banned for this?
---
I got 30k Honor last week! doesn't that mean i'll have rank 14 in 2 weeks xD
---
But yeah it is enjoyable seeing people put their numbers in instead of making a copy.
---
Alliance probably wouldn't even listen if they were given an idea like that.
---
Yeah shouldn't be an issue,  find a dps and a healer one of which needs to be an herber.  Engineering helps if 2 of you have it because you can clear the imps with 2 grenades but isn't needed.
---
OP never even said they did high dps, they just do higher dps than the other one.  So it's like being the smartest kid at the special olympics.
---
Yes, you are.. But not because of your tree, that is just metal. The constant war crimes make you evil though.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVhoZxxMsfbdtV
---
you can swap out feline swiftness for thick hide too if you want
---
A good resto Druid will out heal a mediocre priest/sham/pal. To say a Druid is useless and is getting carried just isn’t true.  There are many druids in the top 15 percent of parse out healing thousands other healers of other classes.
---
I am a level 57 warrior, when can I start clearing mc? Should I Pugg or try to find a guild that has it on farm?
---
I think i screwed this up the other day in dire maul by rushing in when the mob was not dead yet. I think i was worried that they were all going to come after the priest when it broke and i wouldn’t be able to get them all in time. what’s a good protocol for that? wait until just before it dies? if it dies, how much threat does the priest have on the others? can i just shout and get initial aggro? or does he start out with a significant amount?
---
My thoughts exactly. Bye Felicia!
---
Next step enchant your armor
---
That elixir is going to sell like hot cakes until AQ, and even then it will still sell pretty well. So the good note is it’s an easy gold maker. But yes you probably could have sold the recipe for a large amount while people are still drooling over it and buy it in a week or so when there’s a plethora of them. I personally sold it to a buddy for 100g, but I did see AH posts anywhere from 350-1000g
---
Ok let’s clear this up, because it comes up a lot here but I’ve rarely, if ever, seen someone post the correct info:
---
If you want to raid heal as a Resto Druid, and raid heal WELL, you spec Nature’s Grace. This massively boosts your Regrowth crit chance, and when you crit, your regrowth cast time goes down to 1.5 second - same as all other snipe-healing spells (Flash Heal, Flash of Light). 
---
You crit with Regrowth a lot. A lot of your Regrowths are 1.5 s. And they leave a long HoT. Keep your innervate to yourself, and boom - you are an incredibly effective raid healer.
---
You’ll overheal with your Regrowth HoT, but you’ll also get plenty of effective healing with it. And, as ever, so long as you aren’t oom; overhealing means nothing. 
---
ggwp
---
You should it’s a personal referendum on you and your characters as a whole! 😄
---
We got one last night and it went to one of our Holy Paladins who does PvP and is the closest in mats to making the hammer. The only Ret Paladin we have already won BRE (we use DKP) so it didn’t go to them. I’m sorry one member is ruining it for the rest of your guild it seems.
---
Fury prot is online and fine, if you are trying to stay deep prot praying on TF proc to solve TPS problems you may have a melee mutiny. Start with hit cap, swap might for threat gear. Nothing dictates you have to DW every fight, just compare the trees. 
---
"Melee hold back" is not a strategy, are 15 people doing something wrong or 1? By that logic melee can't get upgrades because they are capped.
---
Please tell me it's not 1080p.
---
The argument that he deserves it because of higher dps is ridiculous. Tell him to shut the fuck up or get lost. If I was the GM, I would shut that shit down so fast.
---
Maybe if people didn't abuse it in the first place to evict lower levels and to cycle guild members into select AVs we wouldn't have this problem.   Funny how that works.   Even more funny is the people coming here to complain about it.  Community creates a problem, blames devs, devs change mechanics, community complains about it.
---
If they just made it actually the exact same and refused to change any of it, we would all be better for it understanding it's just the way it is.   Sick of the crybabies, gamers today have a social disease.
---
yeah
---
eye should always go to the warrior, enhance, or ret that has the most gold or ability to farm the mats
---
its a pvp item that functions on all 3 classes for pvp
---
bonereavers and spinal should go to a warrior 100% of the time until they all have it
---
Lmfao. What even is this post. Imagine complaining about having multile things to do in a fuxking videogame thats ment to burn your time.
---
Yeah MT regularly can outdamage a ret pally, even in Deep Prot spec. 
---
As a new player to WoW, I really thought the ret pally hate was blown out of proportion until I started looking at legs. A good one does like 200 dps.
---
I still dont know what the mine mats are good for 15 years after release.
---
About amplify curse; I really like to use it when multi pulling. When used, CoA and corruption + fear and a few wand hits is often enough to down a mob before the dots run out. Combined with a voidwalker holding threat on another mob this means you can pull and kill 3 or 4 or even 5 mobs without going oom.
---
I prefer they open trade naked
---
Thanks that's what I was starting to think. Also looking at the model it looooks siiiick. I'm gonna buy it when I got home from work tonight.
---
I can fap to that
---
Eh, Alliance has already slowed it down and made some adaptations. I at least see them killing Galv &amp; Commanders now. But I agree that overall they are still stuck too much in PvE mode. Ultimately there's going to be clashing mentalities of rep grind, honor grind, win at any cost, and people that want to do various objectives.
---
I've made peace with the fact that I'll get exalted 2-3x slower, but enjoy my games 10x more.
---
So you are telling me ppl who want to dwelve in their own language communities suddenly gonna be open to play with everyone else? If there are language specific realms there should be language specific battle groups. Simple as that.
---
Nothing wrong with having 2 ret pallys. You can clear Naxx with them.  
---
But if they stir drama on top of being nearly useless (nearly because they can still bless) then I wouldn't think twice about kicking one of them.
---
Awesome. Haha
---
its not hard, just time consuming
---
Enhancement is just as useless as ret, and even more so for PvP. If we’re talking nightfall wielders, hunter is by far the best choice.
---
It was the fact that the dude was a dick about it. I love how you ignore that part. This is a social game, so you better not be antisocial or bad things will happen. 
---
It’s good for the zoomers, having some accountability when they’re online for a change.
---
Actual BiS during this phase is Arcanist gloves because you need them to hit the 3 piece arcanist set bonus (the other options are worse)
---
If you compare prebis to bis, your point stands, but to determine overall value to the raid, you need to take into account the MB upgrade over the alternative options (staff and dagger).
---
You mean primal fury?
---
I don't use it but if you wanted to you could easily get it by losing feline swiftness which does nothing for cat in raid.
---
Thanks =D
---
who spends 4 hours in MC? its a 2 hour clear for casuals now and getting faster every week. 
---
even pugs do it in under 3. 
---
this game is not hard.
---
shhhh
---
you're doing it wrong
---
People are nuts for using bots. A friend of mine caught a 6 month ban for using fishbot. In fact, he wasn't even using it, it was just installed on his computer from using it a few years ago in retail. While I don't condone using fishbot, 6 months seemed a bit excessive.
---
Seems like a lot of hunters would be reluctant to be the NF bot unless they were in a hardcore guild trying to speed run content.
---
I mean it was a grind I was proud of lol.
---
Thats really cute
---
That and the horde AB tabard are probably the coolest ones in the game. Nice job
---
Onyxia do be lookin kinda fresh doe 😳
---
Oh! What do I need to fix?
---
I also wondered how big raids never messed up manual rolls for master loot. This is pretty cool!
---
A turtle is beatable if your group is willing to sit on FW until it caps instead of rushing the defense without a GY. I've had pretty good luck with /rw, when I get assist. People ignore chat, but for whatever reason most will follow simple instructions that make noise. "Group at FW, wait for 60% mounts" 
---
\*scout ahead* "Horde Turtle, hold FW until it caps"
---
I try haha
---
they both do shit dps w/ a bad spec, 100% the eye goes to the person with more mats (or completed hammer)
---
Havent done mara but this is relaxing :)
---
Yeah there are 0 hunters i know who want to do this. Was just giving an example of a better class for it
---
just fyi bracers, boots, gloves are also worth using over prebis pieces if you manage to lock in that 3-piece
---
According to anyone that isn’t a ret paladin.
---
dejastats
---
Dude, congrats. Legit jelly
---
Sorry yes, you're one point short if you drop feline swiftness completely but it the talent isn't required then I stand corrected anyway.
---
Arms or 2h furry do significantly more DPS than ret. You missed a word there. Sulf isn't the best for pve but it's not bad and certainly isn't non viable.
---
Capping Battleground Timers
---
mistletoe itself is a pretty problematic idea tbh
---
Plenty of Horde have over 1M queueing in AV, with queue times .... so confirmed; instant queues for premade WSG still worse than solo AV with queue times. Sad.
---
Classic community everyone
---
There are 0 guilds like that.
---
"Snake"
---
Well there’s this kid I had to gkick for harassing other guildies and people in other guilds as well. So now he made a guild called &lt;Rozen is De NUTZ&gt; i guess to flame me or something. I call them my fan club. They spam lfg recruitment. I think it’s like a 14 year old or something. He was harassing players over how much they sold stuff on the AH for. He is under the delusion high AH prices ruined vanilla... ya know not the whole tbc expansion. When I kicked him he claimed i did it in front of 6000 viewers on YouTube. I don’t care and doubt it. He claimed he was going to report me to blizzard because he broke no rules so I can’t kick him. If it’s an adult they have serious issues.
---
Our first BRE went to a Ret paladin by DKP
---
ashkhandi is better... and thats literally next tier
---
the hammer is way undertuned
---
Mara is pretty relaxing other than princess from 100%-50% hp. It’s also crazy money if you sell at least one black stone ring an hour. I’ll probably try lashers tonight
---
It is never that great, if you are in top 10 dps right now in MC then your guildies suck, it slowly gets worse in BWL, then gets far worse in AQ.
---
The **only** thing I am claiming is that 2h weapons are pvp &amp; unless your raid only exists to gear for pvp then min-maxing who gets a pvp weapon is a waste of time.
---
If **you** want to claim that some spec of some class is not viable, **you** can go right ahead and make that claim.
---
Isn't mortal strike super useful for Ebanroc?
---
First and only question - you run with 2 Ret paladins? wow. We have 2 raids downing Rag and not a single ret paladin. One tried; but prot warriors beat him consistently
---
I don't disagree, but everyone has to manage their personal level of burnout.  I did a pretty hardcore raid schedule for a few months in Vanilla and just decided it wasn't for me.  Rolled some alts, got into PvP, came back to raiding a year later with a more casual guild and had a lot more fun.
---
It seems simple to you, but people are weird with loot.  
---
While maybe this other pally farmed all the mats for the hammer, this guy thinks that he farmed his pre-BiS and worked on doing the most damage to help the guild out. In his eyes, he was the one who 'worked' to 'earn' the reward. 
---
With things like this, you should be crystal clear. Legendary items drop, and people will want them. Multiple people. 
---
Everyone should know who is getting those items before they drop. If you need to go into another channel to talk about who to give the next eye to, you've failed in your leadership role. 
---
If the item drops, multiple people on your raid team are going to be saying 'finally, all of my efforts are about to pay off.' Then it goes to someone else, and it's game over. Logic goes out the window. The item dropped. It has a different color than the other items in the game. They worked hard for it. They *deserved* it. You didn't give it to them, which must mean that you don't appreciate what they've done for the guild. Must be a corrupt loot council, maybe the person you gave it to is your irl friend, etc. etc.
---
There's no reason to be had here, because it's a purely emotional response. 
---
Publicly complaining and starting drama in the guild is not acceptable, but this situation was avoidable. 
---
How you talk to this paladin that is fueling drama is something else entirely that's going to depend on relationships in the guild that no one but you guys can possibly know. 
---
But moving forward, legendary drops should be clearly determined before you guys zone into the raid. Who is getting thunderfury? Who is getting the next Hand of Rag? Those decisions should be made before the next raid night.
---
Not excusing them but when you can buff 10 people per man's bar vs 2 per bar you tend to buff more.
---
No Pacman? Disappointing
---
LOL this is what i was thinking too
---
&gt; You wouldn't bring a warrior with invis pots on a stealth run, and you wouldn't bring a ret paladin on a raid.
---
If he can get through, why not? It's his own money he's spending. 
---
And if he can't manage it, then the analogy doesn't work, because a ret paladin does "pull their own weight" and raids get completed with them doing bad to middling DPS every day. In fact you're in a discussion thread about two such paladins in one raid
---
They just aren't pulling the maximum possible weight. And if that's what you require, then yeah, that's probably elitist.
---
And you know, elitism is fine in the proper context. For instance if I'm getting surgery done, yeah I think I'd like the best I can get. For filling out a raid team for the easiest raid of the easiest expansion of an already easy game? 
---
Well, I think maybe that's a bit silly.
---
Yes, but they still got the world first ragnaros, a pve achievement, without the "bis" pve racial, showing it's not the deciding factor between success or failure in reality even if it should be on paper.
---
Mark is a Hunter buff. How do I need roll.
---
Yeah, we sometimes let 1 of our paladins go ret and he tried to say that if we were going to have a shadow priest we should be okay with a ret paladin at all times too since both are not top tier DPS. We then pointed out that the shadow priest had 6 times the dps of the paladin and buffed the six warlocks in our raid with the debuff shadow weaving.
---
Frostbite is better. My question is should I continue using the Bone Slicing Hatchet as my offhand? Lower DPS and Stam/Agi instead of STR but a much faster attack speed than AotDW. 
---
So basically, after Frostbite: Continue using Bone Slicing Hatchet or use AotDW?
---
or you can just report them then kill them
---
lol cant even win a premade let alone come up with an original comeback
---
Is this done by hand?!!? I was an art student once and switched to accounting... I think you just legit inspired me to return to my passion.
---
happened to me at the same place once - big difference being i was the tank. OT picked it up and they somehow managed not to wipe, but my guildies give me crap every UBRS run when we get there now...
---
Dude was probably sick of the guys whispers. Honestly, anyone that brings your GM into something like this isn't someone I would wanna run with anyway.
---
Good guilds?  Or hardcore raiding guilds?  Those sometimes, perhaps even often overlap, but they are not (and should not be considered as) the same thing.
---
I'm running arms warrior, girlfriend is balance/resto druid. We tear through quests. I played solo for about 10 minutes the other day and got to experience how hard WoW Classic is.
---
Imagine PvPing in a PvP instance.
---
just because you can it doesn't mean you should
---
i play classic because of all the things I can do outside of raid... and that's as someone who quickly clears the raids each week
---
Hurrdurr goToreTail. Sure that's fine I can bring my own, but my point was that if they arent paying for consumables OR ANYTHING for that matter then all the profits go directly to the GM and officers. They keep everything and give nothing
---
Same clash was one of the only games I was “addicted” to on my phone.  So much fun until I just couldn’t keep up anymore.
---
I dont know about shamans, but on alliance side I cant see how druids can do anything. Their heals are simply slower than fast heals from paladins and priests.
---
While the fights are short (like they are now) I think your healers have to be atrocious for druids to do well. Or they have to be in some good Rag spot where they get to do most of the healing.
---
we run with 3 ret pallys, we were low on melee dps when we first started the group plus we like our buffs and dispells
---
Most guilds will raid on reset night because it gives them more gear for the rest of the week's activities, and they'll usually do it at similar times for timezone advantages (generally 6pm PST, 9pm EST for US servers). If you log on a half hour that magic starting point, you're virtually guaranteed to get a buff.
---
better to have more core players with meme specs than just pugging their spot
---
also, cant play warr dps? Isnt that also just like 2 buttons lol
---
That ranged knock back that makes all your casters spread out? Yea that hits any1 with a mana bar... Including rets and enha shammys, we almost didn't get rag down before submerge last week cause the enha knocked almost every melee away :/
---
We have 0 ret pallys, and will never invite one to our raids, probably because we are Horde though. *shrug*
---
why what changed?
---
Oh god i can smell the cupcakes already
---
"Haha I'm going to fuck with this guy"
---
*Gouge crits, activates Enrage*
---
o.o
---
Was a warrior in vanilla and two private servers. In vanilla, I had gear thrown at me because I was one of the two main tanks. I was a fury warrior on private servers and hated competing with a half dozen other warriors and multiple rogues (weapons). The experience of having no gear for weeks or gear that was only a marginal upgrade influenced my decision to roll another class altogether this time around.
---
Why, drop chance increases?
---
Pretty easy actually. I farmed 1k in a week as a holy priest. Played maybe 2 hours per day.
---
Do you get that it's not a quest?  The assumption is every group going into Scholo is killing Ras.  Literally just have to clear on extra group and everyone can run to the next room while the Warlock releases the Imp.  
---
To the OP's original point this literally adds 15 seconds to 30-60 minute Scholo run.
---
Ty. Good to know. For some reason I thought the blue set was being held off until later
---
its been too many weeks of mc to still underperform. if you are parsing green on mc you either have a learning disability or don't care enough to learn. if you don't care enough to learn then why do you deserve to raidlog?
---
we've got 2 raidloggers that deserve to raidlog. they both parse 95th or higher on every fight, always come flasked+, bring consumables for others, always early on raid night. they only raidlog because they put in the work to deserve it. raidlogging is a luxury that most people can't afford, but assume is their right to be able to do and keep their spot.
---
Thanks for being that guy. We have a mage that does this every raid night and they're the just best.
---
A raid that is min/maxing is not taking Arms regardless of how much more dps it does than Ret.
---
"So do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide..."
---
Is there one for Targets? Me enabling it on the drop down menu you specified only does it for me.
---
Good point; Many of the groups I'm in, they don't call out if there are Horde beyond FW:GY, so they all just trickle in and die one by one...
---
I normally end up being at FW GY (with/without turtle) defending it until we are essentially over run by the turtle. The only reason why FW GY get's recapped is because the Drek Rush died the second they got into the Frostwolf Camp and are getting camped again by Bal.
---
&gt; If he can get through, why not? It's his own money he's spending.
---
Because he's drastically slowing everything down by waiting for pot CDs.
---
&gt; They just aren't pulling the maximum possible weight. And if that's what you require, then yeah, that's probably elitist.
---
If someone specced for "DPS" does less DPS than the people specced for tanking, they are objectively not pulling their weight.
---
Damn, and here I can’t even win a roll in a 5 man group, what’s it feel like to have the luck of the gods on your side?
---
Tyty
---
Patch notes said it resets "in the night"
---
In phase 1, I'd turn into a bear and sit on top of a booty bay guard and wait for alliance to try and fuck with me while pretending to be AFK
---
They'd attack me, and then a pissed off goblin would burst out of my stomach.
---
It was the guards up the hill btw, so people thought they were out of range and could get away with it
---
The raids don't scale. If you can clear MC with 25 people and 1 Ret pally. You can clear MC with 40 people and 16 Ret pallies
---
I don't recommend this route. You waste a lot of time waiting for patrols. The wall route is better. Also, not killing the stealth satyr means you miss out on felcloth, demonic runes and possibly ghost mushrooms just beyond him.
---
Sane issues on thalnos except we tried to reach out to other guilds to set up a rotation. Well this one guild refused cuz they didn’t seem the point. Everyone on the server hates them at this point. I’m pretty sure they’re teenagers. That’s how they sound anyway. Nbd though. We’ll bang the gong without them.
---
So an update after like 12 hours of AV!   
---
I made some new friends that was playing for fun to and had a blast on discord with them :)   
---
We didn't get kick any of the games and some of them ended in 10 min and one was 2hours + was really fun and just run around and do some killing!   
---
Thanks everyone for all the tips + comments :)))
---
derrr hurrrrrrr
---
MC is easy because it's the nerfed version and everyone had 1.12 pre-raid items.... BWL will prob be easy but your shit guild is def gonna struggle in later phases unless you clean stuff up
---
We have had 0 bindings and 0 Eye of Sulfuras drop, also 0 leafs drop (I think we are at about 10 eyes of divinity). But we have been fortunate with 1 BRE, 1 Spinal, 1 Staff, and 3 Mage blades. Only one 1h weapon tho so far.
---
If you want something braindead you can do solo I've done some SM Library farming. It's not great but not horrible. Easily make 20-30g an hour. And that is without selling boosts. You can make more if you just advertise in general chat that you are boosting for gold.
---
Amazing considering how meh that ring is.
---
Multiple raid groups, and by week 3 I was raiding MC (first time at lvl 58).  To be clear I don't want/need the CHT (Shaman), but my rogue bro is starting to question the supposed 10% drop chance.
---
Well, if you complain hard, maybe they change it, who knows.
---
Why though? If he’s performing highly above the other ret, why can’t he question the choice?
---
So true. Trying to hit parses and pulling aggro has been my MO so far.
---
Yes, I have it.
---
Have you been playing at all recently? Horde actually defend and they turtle for 20 minutes and eventually win, meanwhile ally has greedy honor farmers and dont care about wins. 
---
I feel like i rolled the wrong faction.
---
thanks to wow i see 90% of people are really smalltime/bigtime scumbags if they can get away. but again 10% are worth to live in this world. i play a ret pala and i am grateful it taught me so much about society. i used to play every other class but vanilla ret is by far the best drama you can get, in every aspect of this game lol and therefore it's the least played class/spec of all. Full Retribution!
---
BRD is really helpful. Look for Prison runs for the xp. Felwood should empty out now as well. You could also chance it in Burning Steppes.
---
I have decursive downloaded and I just click the boxes when curses appear during MC.  My question is, is there a way to set the order in which the decurses are so I can prioritize healers/tanks when curses happen?
---
LMAO. It does a viable amount of damage for most guilds vs one of the lowest DPS specs in the game. 
---
Even then you're ignoring the fact that you can 2h furry with the damn hammer and do chart toping DPS for the next few expansions while others get upgrades. 
---
Stop arguing something you don't know anything about.
---
I was hoping you were leading it into one of those small hole traps found in remote areas.
---
We got a 2nd BRE yesterday and one of our fury warriors started a hissy fit for not getting it for his PvP gear when he already had 2 deathbringers and the guy who got the sword has a blue sword from Stratholme. This game turns people to loot hungry man childs.
---
The agi on BSH is worth .75% crit, and the faster speed means more crusader procs and more bonus dmg from sharpening stones
---
I am resetting myself so I just wait like 3 extra mins, np, no lock out.
---
All I see in AV are undead frost mages and undead shadow priests  They must seriously take up like 75% of the Horde population together.
---
I usually help people complete raids with my shamy, but recently ive been seing soo much crying and people trash talk that i just gave up, glad i can play halo
---
There is no such thing as behind in classic wow.
---
Replying to a guy on the wow classic sub bragging about being at the gym, while at the gym. Lol
---
It's not even about farming honor, the GY's position just fucking sucks.
---
I think there is a 2H from AV exalted that is better than the Omokk weapon for cat dps
---
&gt;priority on the tank gear
---
Currently this translates as "priority on fury gear". 
---
\-disgruntled Fury warrior
---
But there is no fault. It’s not for you.
---
Man that sounds like a shit show. We just had the best night of our lives yesterday with a Garr Binding and the Eye Dropping, but with only one Ret Pally, it was pretty easy to see who it went to ;P
---
I enjoy being corrected and learning new things as well.
---
It's not that bad. There is plenty of people that haven't hit 60 yet. Also plenty of people like myself that can't stop making Alts.
---
Arcane Crystal's when layers were still around bb
---
As a hunter... I love the seal of wisdom they apply to the target. That's about all they are good for that a holy paladin can't do - allow the rest of us to balls to the wall much faster and for longer
---
Is this like a lazy healers BG/Dungeon macro? I swear I used something similar to this in WotLK when I didn’t wanna be so focused on my bars.
---
I would also turn off all the addons and turn them on 1 by 1 to see which add on it is and trouble shoot it that way.
---
That's really sad dude
---
Your friend lied.
---
Same lol
---
World PvP is pretty dead right now aside from the likely no-lifer 60 rogues trying to grief you, so it’s a good time to level. Depending on your server leveling shouldn’t be dead, and actually way easier than I was before aside from dungeon groups being slower to form.
---
Before getting invested in a server I’d look up that servers balance and make sure you aren’t a large minority. You could be level alliance on a 20% alliance realm
---
u love to see someone be super super wrong but also very confident. Shit hits different
---
Ah, thanks for the info! =)
---
If you are a running a DPS class that can use that hammer. Why wouldn't you have the mats ready for a drop?
---
If there is only one AH bid up for that big of a price it may not be that actual intrinsic value of the recipe as that seller is a market maker and his bid should as a result likely expire.
---
My first raid in vanilla:  I joined a new guild and they immediately invited me to raid.   They were on eye of cthun.   I died twice just running in...(the damn tentacles spawned on me twice in succession two pulls in as row).  I was so embarrassed I just told them it was a good fit and left raid/guild.
---
I thought of that. But they're going to have their stealth detect pets out on aggressive and most likely pop us out of stealth and ruin the opener before we can get a sap off
---
Yeah they’re always pretty fun for leveling. Raiding guilds might invite you but most 60s sort of ignore non-60s, which might not be the most pleasant way to level
---
Yeah I love leveling guilds like that, tons of people and a lot of banter.
---
That makes you the 5th best guild in the world!
---
30 days hahahhahahah try again with more than double that.
---
wrong flair
---
I don't remember exactly, but I believe the Bears did about 170-180 DPS and the Prot Warr did about 150. One Ret did ~200 and the others 140-150. So yeah, you're not wrong.
---
I've started on Firemaw. Thank you! 
---
What do you think about paladin and druid? I don't know what class to choose :(
---
I'd grind AV in Mara gear if I just had a damn epic mount. Being a poor makes AV much harder lol
---
After running it the 10th time it does become something to consider. Doubt youd rather spend 5+ hours than 2 hours to clear the same content you've done again and again. At a certain point it just becomes something you have to do for gear
---
Yeah, filthy disgusting locks are OP. Even Pom pyro cant gib them
---
Everyone says Druid but I think it depends on your server/guild. I play a resto Druid and in the first guild I joined, I was one of 8 Druids on the raid team - literally couldn’t get gear to save my life. I switched guilds and now I’m only one of 2 Druids on the raid team, which makes a world of difference both for gear drops and actually feeling like I’m useful.
---
But... yeah, probably Druid or Lock.
---
In my guild we’ve had it drop 4 times, this thing isn’t rare rather it’s just more debt for the guild.
---
Of the world buffs you mentioned, we won't get two of them, ZG/Darkmoon for a few months.
---
Also, one wipe and your buffs are gone.  No guild is immune to wipes.  And if you do the speed run path, you will wipe occasionally.
---
Yea orc for me great, WotF is the nuts for tho.  Love killing casters.
---
Classic Wow, Retpallies, Drama...
---
&lt;insert surprised pikachu face&gt;
---
I didn't see it, but someone did ask about why there were so many dead crocolisks in Org city chat the other day on Mankrik.
---
If you are top dps as enhance, your guild has a real problem.
---
Yeha no furor, no cat dps
---
Yeah I'm way more casual now, vanilla was probably when I was most hardcore about it but I was still doing progression raiding in a top 200 Guild in WotLK and Cata.  The shitty wipe nights on Spine and Madness of Deathwing really made me rethink my approach towards WoW.  I quit progression raiding in the first tier of MoP.
---
I need to look up the upcoming raid mechanics. I don't know them and I want to be ready to help prevent wipes. 
---
Like don't stand near Ony's tail, it has a knockback. Things like that, just experience based knowledge.
---
&gt;So you are telling me ppl who want to dwelve in their own language communities suddenly gonna be open to play with everyone else?
---
Dude what are you talking about hahahah. Open about what? It's not like you are trying to convince muslim people to eat pork and they wouldn't be open about that. Why are you trying to impose it like it's a culturally harmful thing? It's a fucking battleground in a fucking video game. I haven't heard any complaints about the non-english players about this so far.
---
I've heard a lot of complaints about people who call russians "rustards" or spanish people "spantards" though. I don't even know you but I wouldn't be surprised if you were one of those people that say "I'm not racist but.." kind of shit.
---
The most basic english is more than enough to commumicate in battlegrounds and even though if they don't know english, they know enough gaming terminology to express themselves. It's simple as that.
---
Thicc
---
You should look into Shaman &amp; Warrior. 
---
You both have played ranged characters, so why not mix it up and play melee? This combo also gives you the benefit of not competing for gear. While you *could* go rogue instead of warrior, the issue is that windfury and poison take up the same slot; you can't utilize the rogue to the fullest extent then. 
---
Going with these two, you'll have: 
---
 * Rez
---
 * 2 Tanks
---
 * 2 Melee DPS or
---
 * 1 Melee / 1 Caster or
---
 * 1 Tank / 1 Healer
---
 * Plate / Chainmail
---
&gt; If you /moo at me though I am going to attack you. We're tauren not cows, get it sorted.
---
Shit, I've always /moo'd as a gesture of good faith and friendship.
---
Ele all the way.
---
MC does a metric ton of threat on the mob you use it on, but on others I don't think it does any threat at all (maybe depends on how much damage the mob does but I don't think that's the case). It should be fine to charge in towards the end and shout or something. It's also nice if the priest drops MC at the last moment so you can actually loot the mob.
---
Most attacks already do this anyway.
---
Nice toys! Love them too but Im not so in to clash, but whow that monitor! seems a little wide for me.. haha, how big is it?
---
Yes I did, killed him 5 times for honor as well!
---
Double rogue priest and Rogue Mage Priest were ny first ideas. Idk which would fare better. But the locks can use their Felhunter to find rogues in stealth before we get the opener
---
Man how tf did you come up with that just on the point .
---
Nope, Lava Lash was added in Wrath to put the final nail in the WF/WF (and 2H enhance) coffin by forcing players to go WF/FT.
---
Just ignore them. AV is not theirs and I don't give any fucks if I ruin their so called efficiency.
---
He asked me to list off world buffs so I did. If you die on the way in your buffs are gone, if you dc in the wrong place your buffs are gone, etc. That comes with raiding in classic.
---
1. How much would you make me pay to help me finish the Wirlwind axe quest ?
---
Please be nicer to people
---
Paladins are excellent.
---
But not for solo play or tanking...
---
Source: Leveled as a Holy Paladin to 60.
---
Druids are excellent.
---
Source: My raiding guild always wants a Boomkin and our off-tank is a bear-form Druid.
---
You could do this in Temple of Kotmogu too but even crazier. Hide the ball carrier under the mammoth mount + gamon/Mr smite you + world shrinker.
---
They can't target your ball carrier unless of course they tab target hahahaha
---
&gt;random orc female
---
&gt;he
---
yikes
---
You wouldn't use any arcanist pieces iirc in pvp if you hit r10
---
Doing god's work stopping bots in classic
---
I'm at work, which makes me want to click it even harder....
---
It could cost my reputation... better wait til later at home...
---
I ... must... resist...!!!
---
Yea but it requires everyone to use this addon, at which point you might as well just use a discord or something. Also since addons can't communicate through global chat channels anymore (unless they post actual messages) it's not going to work well.
---
There's a dead boar just decomposing at the front entrance to Orgrimmar on my server and it's been there for a few days now. I wonder this bug has to do with things dying on the borders between zones/areas.
---
So I've seen 5/5 feral instincts (the threat one) and 3/5 thick hide in the 0.30.21 build.  What do you think about doing 4 in each instead?
---
Imagine being so immersed in reddit that real life is less important. 
---
Sorry you're not on my radar homie. I get to this when I have time, it's not nearly important enough to even install the app on my phone lol
---
What's Enrage do?
---
In my instance, it was a greedy eviscerate when I should have kidney punched.
---
1.12 AV is Trash, I don't know why they put it in or why people defend Blizz. They pick and choose what mechanics they put in (1.5 this, 1.7 that, 1.12 that) and yet people still come on here and say "bLiZ GiVe AuThEnTiC VaNiLa". Mob respawn rates are broken, Server Population is broken, Tons of little things are broken (like not being able to get knocked off ledge in gnomer, or walking on ZF graves not spawning zombies) and yet people still come in here and defend Blizz for putting the dumbest, most broken, and most of all, Lazy version of AV in Classic.
---
Holy pallies are gods in pvp. So premade wsg is going to gimp themselves with a ret pally. It's the exact same situation as a raid. You are making an active decision to fuck over multiple people because you want to play a meme spec, this isn't a single player game.
---
If challenging content was in the game it wouldn't be good, but remember you don't even need 40 people to do MC.  So you could do literally nothing and your guild could still clear it right?  That's why everything is "viable" in raids.
---
Ease of completion doesn't really matter, they said they didn't want to deal with it, yet everyone feels they should take them.
---
this is fire, fuck ya classic
---
Will you stream it?
---
What kind of lunatic is looking this up?
---
Paladin is extremely good at healing and vital to any group, but they’re basically stuck in the healing role at 60. You can dungeon tank and a raid guild may accept you as Ret but most Paladins just becomes healers. For the most part you are nonstop buffing in raids (Your buffs last 5 mins each and the greater versions I believe are 10 minutes), so pretty tedious gameplay, but again, extremely good healers and all groups want you. Also by far the best PvP healers so they’re monsters when paired with an arms warrior.
---
Druid is tons of fun but if you’re brand new to wow it might be a bit complicated, since you’ll need a lot macros and addons to play it effectively and it’s mostly considered the worst class of the game at most things. They’re extremely good at random things and basically okay at everything else. Flag carrying, leveling speed and dungeon tanking are probably their strongest qualities.
---
Have you...ever read the quest text of any dwarf quest?
---
If you are this warrior, F1, /guildquit. Guild is trash and you will find a other guild quickly.
---
You are still prioretizing revenge &gt; bloodthirst &gt; sunder  over heroic strike. Depending on what your tanking there shouldn be " spamming heroic strike most of the time ".
---
Just turn your brain off and power through. Do something else when you get burnt out. I did about 7 hours of AV premades yesterday, took a break and came back to help a friend finally get his epic paladin mount. Ended the day on a positive note that made me forget the mind-numbingness of AV rep grinding.
---
Context matters. He could have been saying it in jest.
---
If you're suggesting/confused that I used the wrong pronoun, the "he" is referring to the player (me), who is male.
---
If you're suggesting there is something "yikes" with a male player playing a female character, well, you'll need to explain why.
---
He is laser engraved and laser cut on ~1/4” plywood
---
Are you playing on a toaster?
---
It’s 1080 bruh
---
We put it up for DKP and only one person bid on it. No one else wanted it. Things excessively expensive to craft.
---
All we're getting are leaves, lol. 5 weeks in, 5 leaves, one mageblade, none of the other drops. This dry spell is going to be awesome once is swings the other way and we get flooded with fat loot.
---
Ever tried playing for fun?
---
This is kind of the problem with 1.12 being the baseline for Classic.  It's arguably the least relevant period of vanilla WoW.
---
tbh not to be rude but "idk what quests I've already done" is a really dumb reason to not play a character lol.
---
Best of luck with your recovery, hope you feel better soon!
---
Druid-kun, cover my body\~
---
Can I do that as a warrior? Do I need ravager axe? You make that much just from selling drops to vendors?
---
Back up everybody, we’ve got a casual redditor here
---
EVERYBODY HIDE YOUR MAX LEVEL CHARACTER
---
&gt; BWL will prob be easy but your shit guild is def gonna struggle in later phases unless you clean stuff up
---
People are downing heroic raids in pugs, sometimes even mythic raids in pugs
---
I'd be surprised Naxx isn't downed by pugs after the gear is there, including unoptimal specs
---
I love Av 1.12 ez farm
---
Get the addon realmob health
---
What upgrades you lookin forward too for your mage?
---
That's funny because I'm on the horde side of that server and have had very little issues with toxic players. Barrens chat is nice and edgy but outside of that people seem pretty normal.
---
I am an engineer, you mean thorium grenades?
---
Man gtfo of here
---
Last week makes 8 eyes in a row. We literally ran out of level 60 priests to give it to. There are talks of giving it to a pug for gold or recruiting a new priest for lolz
---
lol can't even form a premade let alone come up with an original comeback
---
I'm just under 10k armor and I switched to 0.30.21 build to mix it up in pvp and so I can heal raids. The norm is 5 in feral instincts for threat. And 3 in thick hide... what are your thought in doing 4 in each instead for a little extra armor since I'm not capped yet, or is  the extra point for threat more important?
---
Lamb and tuna fish?!
---
but if your guild could clear in 30 mins that would affect you and your guilds raid
---
Based
---
Ret pally btw

The EPL mobs drop plenty of great loot on top of the raw gold generated. Krol Blade to certain nationality rogues will always get near your epic mount training straight out

Cannot say, I have used this system mainly and have never used what you are talking about. This basically gives me the functionality of @mouseover when my mouse is over Grid and removes the downside of @mouseover when my mouse is over player targets while giving additional functionality of casting heal/shield on enemy targets while being able to quickly dispel magic effects (HOTS/shields) from enemies as well.

You want the game quick, easy and well-balanced? Go back to retail

The way you people hand-wring over the shittiest and least relevant thing from vanilla WoW is seriously impressive to me.  AV sucks.  AV always sucked.  AV is complete shit and was a terrible idea from the day it was implemented, and it only got shittier as time went on. 
---
The fact that you guys are shocked that it has flaws and game-breaking elements is really something else.

Bowsette is a Trap!!!!!

This is why I love playing a druid. So versatile.

Like when I was doing the Mor’Ladim quest with a hunter (both only level 30, Mor is 35 elite) and we 2-manned him because I started in cat, got my dots on him, swapped to bear to get aggro, then went back into cat and used dash and just ran in circles kiting Mor around a tree while the hunter ranged him down. He was laughing his ass off. Totally didn’t expect that to work!
---
I mean doesn't that apply even nowdays. If you did this or that you arn't getting in X country because they won't grant you visa. Obviously it isn't that black or white but still works in my opinion.
---
People were banned for doing this sort of thing during WotLK on the big mammoth mounts. It actually is a bannable offense.
---
Agreed
---
For low health mobs yes but for raid bosses ideal cast time is actually to weave your dots into your last two toep active shadowbolts.  This makes it so the dots are empowered after as well as the first corruption you put on at the start maximizing boost.
---
Why not both?
---
Uh, nope. It was actually 3 of my friends (two of them were actively using fishbot, the other one just had it installed). They all got 6 month bans for "using third party software". Why would my friends create new accounts and level new toons to 60 if they didn't get banned?
---
I only did progression raiding for a little while, shortly after BWL was released, and I don't have any particularly fond memories of it.
---
Nothing stirs guild drama like an evening of wipes.
---
You have nothing to be sorry about. Thank you for sharing.
---
Dang. We have had no issues over either one of our Eye drops. First one was a roll between interested parties. Second one was to the person with most mats that didn't already have eye. No drama, no issues. Perditions Blade on the other hand....That we lost like 5 or 6 folks over lol
---
Gives the Warrior +25% DMG if they've been critted, it's what causes their Mortal Strikes to hit so hard that even your alts will feel it
---
I do it as a fury warrior. 20-30g/h is just for vendoring. Just make sure to have plenty of bagspace and I hs to brill when I need to sell.

Any expansion..... arena is a very niche aspect of the game, always has been. 
---
Wow is a PvE game and the majority of its players consume just that. 
---
So saying that “ohh my favorite part” will increase replay value blah blah, just doesn’t hold true when blizzard has long released most of their old metrics and it shows that only small segments of the population pvped at all in any form.
---
I can think of a handful of guilds that still wipe on rag(and other bosses in mc regularly) due to not having enough dps to beat submerge phase on my server. Any half decent guild will walk through mc, but there will be tons of guilds breaking apart because of bwl.
---
Sweet post history dude
---
lol imagine admitting to losing and having to make excuses for losing in a premade
---
someone forgot to install cs source
---
&gt; I don't see why it is so important to delay BWL.
---
Because it's not being delayed? BWL comes out early 2020 which means somewhere between January - March, but early January is way too soon.
---
If your guild planned 6 whole hours of raiding when there are only 2 raids in the game, then that's your guild's fault for mismanagement. Keep waiting.
---
10 days is super slow though. Since the op isn't new to the game it's probably closer to 5.
---
Btw full tank was/is really fun for pvp when you can trust your healers. I wanted to switch to be able to heal more often in pve also
---
of course, very authentic, will not come with any hooves and will have a picture of chuck norris on it's underbelly.

So the person who would more or less use it as a transmog ( meaning it’s would not improve their dps) should be the person who gets the item over one who could actually use it to its full potential?

I think he can get extra attacks by chance. His rare legendary drop is a mace which gives a chance for 2 extra hits on attack. Sometimes he just proccs this twice and rips you apart.
---
What is the druid casting on the rogue? Apologies I have never played druid.
---
Download trinketmenu. That way u only yse 2 kb for all trinkets. As a rogue it should be extremely gard to run out of kbs when using shift and alt modifiers. as a rogue u dont rly need kb to target party members so f1-5 are also usable
---

---
This sub and hating fun, name a more iconic duo
---
lol it's mostly enchanted.
---
You have higher HPS if you stack +healing over crit... 
---
The dagger is complete ass and the pally prebis mace is better than it.
---
Staff of Dom is also significantly worse than MB.
---
1 spellpower is worth more than 1 healing. Giving pally MB is a loss in value if you just look at stat weights alone..
---
Also, gearing out healers doesn’t help the raid as much as DPS.

---
Not as described by OP. No single guild would expect members to be flasked for MC. There are a handful of guilds that compete for speedruns, namely APES, Progress, Onslaught, Dreamstate, Return, and Salad Bakers, and of course you will be expected to have all of your gear enchanted regardless of the gear, and you are required to flask for speedruns which are only scheduled every couple of months.

But beta capped at 40 lol...

Why are you comparing normal mode to classic raiding? Mythic raids will do exactly what you describe and so will heroic raids for the most part. Heroic is very puggable
---
you still should. Rp servers with low rper % are just sad.
---
Being ok aboput specific language realms but being against language separation is devoid of logic.
---
If you want to Smite DPS for the lulz and still do stuff without being crippled outside of raids, consider this spec. You can swap Renew with Inspiration if you'd like. In Scholo, and where I didn't run out of mana, I was able to break 300 DPS.

We’ve had 1 eye of divinity, then 11 weeks of leaf...
---
My point is, getting to the point where hots will knock off damage buffs is rare and not something you should base your spec around unless you are speed clearing.  Stacking so many buffs that not being able to be healed with mana efficient hots essentially fucks over your healers.

ayyy

Frostbite is one-hand. I get that technically I worded my question wrong, but I appreciate the people that actually helped answer the question that was blatantly being asked.

They seriously need to nerf the AV rep. I was very disappointed at how quickly I was able to grind that out. In vanilla it was at least a week before we saw exalted people.

Hey I'm Rattlegore! What guilds are being accused?

Yeah, that spot was so OP... since you have total overhead coverage approaching the two base towers.

I’ve had trouble getting back to do the hand ins. I use the insignia and die almost instantly and then cant cross the bridge to turn them in. How do you manage this?
---
Yet a couple dozen people running Nostalrius, Elysium, Light's Hope, and Kronos did a better job replicating real vanilla than Blizzard has with Classic. If they can utilize older AV based on old info alone, so can Blizzard.
---
Darkshore Moonkin look to be a decent source, considering they are clumped in one area. The Owls in NW Teldrasil also seem to be relatively clumped and closer to a main city.

why would you give bindings to a prot pala, thunderfury is the single largest upgrade your raid can have.

I mean thats almost 1kg on my server lmao and i dont think you will have a problem selling it

Ye im exalted and i'm not populair when i start doing actuall pvp as an ally
---
The game stop about being fun when everyone on pvp servers roll horde. 
---
Let face it, if people weren't minmaxing for pvp then the faction ratio wouldn't be so heavily skewed to horde on pvp servers.
---
Get Details! Threat meter. Super important for raids like Onyxia. That's just about the only addon that's required for raids other than "Monolith DKP" which is what your DKP question was about. DKP is a point system that's used as a form of currency to "bid" on loot drops during raids and is managed in-part by the DKP addon, but mostly by your guild leader/officers. To put it bluntly, it's a loot system that rewards those who repeatedly raid with the same raid group. The more you earn gives you a 100% chance of getting the item you bid on over those who have less points than you. Once you win a bid, you lose 75%, 50% or even 10% of your total amount of points, depending on if it was a weapon or piece of armor or if nobody else needed it. These are the basic rules but can be modified depending on how your guild is run.
---
Finding a guild can be tough, especially finding the right guild for you. Luckily, warlocks aren't the most popular class so loot should be easy for you to grab once you start raiding.
---
I think yesterday my honorspy showed a few hundred people that are earning over 200k honor per day.
---
That being said, I'm not earning more than 80k myself, so maybe I shouldn't bash

I do lasher/satyrs farm on mage. Tried bosses but not worth it for me, waste too much time for some chance of good loot. Very chill farm, everything is under control here in DM:e.

---
I mean doing more damage is the skill right now
---
I would farm fire eles in un'goro for all of my rested because I knew the epic mount grind would be brutal.  It helped a lot
---
Other than that, Warrior leveling is the worst and having a healer to quest with is almost necessary if you want to be efficient at all.  Like, I was killed at 400 hp by random Alliance while trying to kill 2 quest mobs at the same time.  It's brutal, but once you get gear and start scaling, it's all worth it.  Farm BRD, Hinterlands if you missed it, WPL.  If you're solo focus on green quests first and try to keep your questing to those as it's safest and easiest, especially if it's a PvP server, because you dont gain XP while dead.
---
My guild is loot council and honestly they've been very fair about everything so far. One of the roles of a healthy loot council is keeping people happy by making sure ppl only roll on gear that's good for them plus some progression based loot distribution (gearing the main tank first type of thing). Obviously loot council has room to go corrupt but that hasn't been my experience (although my experience is limited as this my first WoW experience).

Is the mad Pally aware the eye is not a limited resource and will drop again? In the meantime, he can work on his Sulfuron Hammer.
---
Pixystyx from the thread in the OP states this though "Right now grenades are being erroneously resisted by talents/abilities/items that grant stun immunity, and they are causing diminishing returns to both controlled stuns and incapacitate brackets, simultaneously. Berserker rage is correctly giving immunity to the effect, blink currently is incorrectly breaking the effect."
---
Thats brilliant man have to admit.
---
I said hand on accident thinking of WotLK (when I was a paladin)... who else can cast Blessing of Salvation?
---
Where are the arena participation numbers for TBC?
---
Raidlogging in classic now can work as you only have MC and Ony raids to clear. But later people will have to farm up consumables/rep/mats for AQ and Naxx (At least for Progression)
---
Thats usually the time where raidlogging doesnt work anymore imo.
---
Besides that,i personally dont like raidloggers very much because they are not participating in the guild very much
---
Not particularly, you just have an off tank taunt him when he goes to heal. Much better to save the debuff slot for something more useful. Though the real 40-man pve comparison should be to 2h Fury.
---
&gt; Why arent games lasting for hours or even days? 
---
Because, like Blizzard announced well in advance, it's the 1.12 version of AV.
---
Really? Thanks for enlightening me with your knowledge lol.
---
Moonkins go oom very fast. You shouldnt be using max rank star fire.
---
Thanks for your input on telling me I'm wrong without explaining why.
---
We had a charity ret paladin for a bit but thankfully he quit the guild. We’re never inviting one again. I honestly can’t think of a worst spec to invite to a raid &amp; we have a feral Druid &amp; boomkin druid so we’re not like hardcore min max

---
More news at 11.
---
Oh, I don't disagree with you. It *is* a guild problem and I never said the Rets were the issue. But it doesn't help us in that they choose to play Ret instead of Holy. If they played Holy, that would open up DPS spots for useful DPS specs (we have max 2 Fury Warriors per raid...). When we're more geared and especially more experienced, they could go back to Ret. But for a new inexperienced guild it's unfortunate that 3 or 4 raid spots are filled by Rets.
---
because he can benefit more from it than the warrior who doesn't have any threat issues
---
I actually want to start recording things. How do I get something in a quality as high as this?
---
even then, will still get out-dpsed by a fury with no world buffs and only basic consumes

WSG gives less than 1800 per win and less than 30 per HK. Excuse me while I call bullshit at a 'consistent 12-15 wins per hour'

How is 2hand fury at 60?

I wanted to tank but my guild is full for raid tanks.
---
I was thinking going 20/31/0 and use my 2 hander until I get enough  +hit gear. I assume with good armor and a shield I can still tank 5 man dungeons fine.
---
&gt;however you justify your actions doesn't make them any less weak and pathetic
---
For starters, cheating in wow or any other game is bad and I don't encourage anyone to do it. It doesn't means people don't do it anyway.
---
They are still better than you though. Their disposable income allows them to do it and their ingame standing is higher than yours. Of course they won't admit they cheated and will say it's fair one.
---
&gt;there have been plenty of r14 who didn't have to buy it.
---
If Blizzard continue their relaxed policy on bans and keep the current bracket, even for 0.3% there won't be any fair r14 players, very unlikely. Maybe mafia players will be able to ban non-colluding rankers with constant tickets and calls to support, then mafia non-botters and non-account sharers have hope. Vanilla isn't Classic.
---
&gt;right, so we'll have both achieved the same thing - nothing. he's just out some money and wishing he had achieved it lol.
---
Main nostalgia audience for Classic is in their 30s and more or less tech savvy back there in 2004+, which says at the very least 6 figure income on average and likely on the upper spectrum of it.
---
Including finding the party and traveling time a dungeon is usually 2h min. You should also include extra time for wipes or whatever.

Crit damage (not percent chance) would snapshot but by that point nothing else did.

---
You can downvote me all you want, but I’m never going to stop liking current AV
---
how much honor did you get farming Exalted with WSG? just out of curiosity.
---
are you factoring curse of recklessness?
---
Queues are cross realm.
---
Ah, so I don't need to worry about Monolith DKP until I start raiding then? IsGet Details! and Threat Meter two seperate addons?
---
And my mistake I really should've made it more obvious in my original post. I'm actually playing hunter, not warlock.
---
So sounds like it's all about finding the right guild then.
---
it definitely will not solve the issue. horde are the over-represented faction. all the "60/40 is not that bad!" can now be, "15 min av queues is not that bad!" (15 min queue is how some horde are experiencing)
---
Get your AV rep now! the grind is a pain but will only get worse as people cycle out of AV
---
Download HonorSpy addon and you can see an estimate.
---
I want TBC to come out, then WotLK, then fuck it, all the other expansions.
---
Just keep every expansion alive on their own server and give players the choice to transition their characters onto the new servers or stay back. Why not just allow a one-time character copy so that your characters can exist on several servers at once in case you want to come back.
---
The only problem will be population, but that'll be a problem no matter what. They'll eventually have to merge servers anyway.
---
I realized one person has to be in the same party as the target, once he knocks the target down anyone else can too
---
more then 30 for most HKs the first 2 go arounds usually around 69-50 for first 2 kills of each person if not more. and per win w/ turn in you get 1400+ the marks of honor.
---
Seems like horde won the war then :d
---
We've had 1 mageblade and 1 ring of spell power. No robes, no staves, no talismans, no chokers. The mages are getting desperate
---
&gt; highly
---
He's not though. From what OP has said he's slightly higher, most of the time. And it's not clear what the gear difference is, basing loot on raw numbers without factoring in gear just makes the "rich richer," so to speak, and is ultimately harmful to the raid as a whole.
---
why would u give 2 deathbringers to a fury wars lmao 2nd one isnt even a upgrade over CHT
---
omg I would love to find a guild without 30% racist people. In all my time playing wow I've never been able to find such a thing. That sounds great
---
It's average of new character without help from highlevels.  
---
&gt;    The most common playtime to 60 I saw on private servers with all my friends was 8 days played. That’s with questing addons. – Eliariath
---
&gt;    Average is prob around 9-10 Days played – /u/kingclax  
---
Also world record 1-60 is 4 days and 20 hours in Vanilla.
---
So your statement about 5 days looks not very trustful)
---
We were deciding on sinew from ony for hunters based on if they had their demons killed yet or not. You do the work you get rewarded. That's not even close to what that hammer requires. 100% chance that ret pally complaining would have never finished it and would have caused more drama trying to make the guild fund it.
---
The other pally SOLOd the hammer? This shouldn't even be a hard decision. My guess is your dude is just going to be toxic. I'd have your officers warn him to chill or get booted and if he doesn't then just go ahead and not out up with it. It's not worth it.
---
Lmao imagine a bunch of Ret Paladins arguing who does "more dps" and who "earned" the Hand of Ragnaros. Get outta heeeeeeeeeereeeeeee lmao
---
Draenei porn is the real seller. You'll have to wait for TBC Classic to rank.
---
I'm not arguing about whether or not expose is stronger than sunder, thats obviously true
---
I don't know shit about how warriors build threat in classic, I just assume sunder is necessary since the top damaging logs use it... if expose armor were better... they would be using it... they would have higher parses

The AH is your friend. It isn't a get-gold-in-your-hands mine in the short term - but long term if you use it right and are smart with professions it will provide a constant income stream.

I agree, AV rep gain should be as slow as WSG rep gain.
---
Blizzard LOVES the nochanges movement more than the player base that thinks it was defending it does.

Blizzard gets to arbitrarily tip their hat to no changes whenever a moment of controversy comes out because it knows there's a flurry of people ready to sqwuak "no changes" until people with valid points are work down by attrition.

Slippery slope? Ya remember when we all had the best version of savage gladiator chain right out of the gates? Oh wait... Or how we started with 1.12 AV...Oh wait...Or how we knew about all the mats for the opening of the gates before the game came out? Oh wait...

We've already slid down the mountain so Blizzard could benefit from the obscure convenience of "1.12 no changes, but a few changes that make it easier for Blizzard".
---
brilliant
---
It's only that expensive because the event just started. By the end of the event there will be tons of them and they'll be worthless.
---
I'm not exagurating lol but I mean feel free to doubt wsg =). Sometimes if your luck you can even get solo kills for like 200+ honor depending on the enemy rank. We don't win every match but I've went 50+ winning.
---
What buffs?
---
If enough assholes reported you it would kick you out instantly.  "premades" (dickheads) would kick out people they didn't want by all reporting you.
---
Now what happens is you get a debuff for 3 or 5 minutes, and if you don't initiate combat before it runs out, you get kicked out with a deserter debuff.
---
I had a premade group of dickheads mark me the second the gates opened but I was able to get into combat before it wore off and it goes away.
---
I think you overestimate just how much information he's expecting to see at the far edges of his screen. It's more about immersion with extra background in the periphery. You would never actually put important information like unit frames or chat boxes at the extreme edges.
---
If it makes you feel any better, Tuesday and Wednesday were absolutely painful as Horde.  Everyone preached the "let alliance win, everyone else zerg balinda + lts" strat and that strat is great for honor but very mediocre for rep gain.  Trying to convince people to defend or not let the alliance win was difficult.  Took a couple days and the Horde strategy adapted, it'll be interesting to see if the Alliance adapt aswell.
---
Wtf this apple doesn't taste like this orange! They're both fruits!  
---
That's what your post reads like.
---
To think that she actually notices those details is adorable.
---
I see videos of dogs and cats watching TV/monitors and reacting to what's being displayed, meanwhile my German Shepherd doesn't even recognize any movement/display from our TV, he just lays in front of it facing me, pouting, giving me sad puppy dog eyes because I won't play fetch with him for the 47th time that day.
---
Thanks! :D Sadly these sorts of things don't do well on reddit and never gain proper traction to get a lot of eyes, but they're fun to do!
---
lol cope more with having no friends
---
Seriously, people go to odd lengths trying to persecute meme specs.
---
I used to have the epic t-shirt. Basically it just has the tooltip for a shirt printed on it with its stats. I dunno if you can get them anymore, but I had it back in 2008 so it fits the timeframe.
---
go to arathi highland after 11pm on your server, they are everywhere
---
What UI is that!
---
not really
---
most of those realms had wildly different stats, from mob HP, armor values, to attack tables, etc
---
I did a lot of grinding to start out my grind from 50-60. First my favorite spot was the gorilla cave in Un'goro. Got myself a lot of gold because I had skinning and they drop good greys. I was also able to get my mining skill up because there are 2 veins that spawn there. 
---
My 2nd spot and a personal favorite is the Blood Elves in Azshara. This would probably be more up your alley now because of your level. I think they are level 51-53. They die pretty fast and are great for exp/hour. However I had pretty piss poor drops from these elves so I only spent about a level with these guys. 
---
I would also start looking into doing BRD a lot. Theres so much good loot to get from here. I don't have a lot of it as a level 60 so I will still have to go back and farm it. At level 55 you can start tanking most of it unless you wanna shoot for a full run. 
---
Honestly I would really recommend finding a grinding spot and put on a move or tv show on a side monitor. I was getting so bored of leveling by  level 50 so finding a mindless grind was great because I could pay very little attention to the game while getting a lot of played time in. I also didn't have to worry about travel time for quests and figuring out what to do.
---
That's how it should be. As long you don't hold back the guild then by all means go with your spec.
---
Love the letter present ! 
---
Thank you !
---
^ This is the one.  Get money for yours as fast as you can, buy it back later for a few copper.
---
Very true, lok'tar!
---
I think another problem is just the stun resist chance, it's the possibility  to resist a spell. I thi k a grenade is firedmg and it can just be resisted.
---
Im currently on rattlegore us :D
---
On some days the Alliance does the same so I would call that balanced.
---
You sure seem to be taking this personally. Do you use racist slurs “in jest”?
---
You need int gear which means you need to have a whole nother set on you at all times (rip bag) or just put it in your bank (rip bank), which is annoying but there's nothing to be done when you play a shitty spec that can barely solo anything. I wonder when p3 is out if blue dragon will have an independent proc chance on every instance of holy nova damage, if it does aoe farming as priest will be much easier.
---
Omg this is premium healer info right here.
---
Jesus fuck, thats still lvl 58 warrior dps territory lol
---
I don't see anywhere saying jump on the tent.  It says run to this spot.  If that is how this reset is done maybe OP can explain more.
---
Threat meters are especially fucked on Ony because they don't account for the threat resets from fireball
---
I used to farm air elementals in all my free time in vanilla to make gold and I saw the wind boss in Silithus all the time.
---
cb - hemo - prep.
---
imagine being this salty losing a premade lol
---
It says run...not jump
---
No, you queue heroic strikes because it gives your offhand the same hit-cap as your mainhand, which is not only a rage and flurry boost, but also a threat boost.
---
Tell that to top parsing druids who just roll hots
---
If anyone's wondering, that's 221 wins for non-humans.
---
Alternatively, 1575 0-flag-cap losses.
---
Big yikes dude. Thunderfury should only ever go to a warrior tank.
---
at least on my server, the pugs that are doing smooth (lets say &lt;90 min MC) clears are also pretty limited in their tolerance of meme specs, and often implicitly expect more buff / consumables prep than most guilds.
---
Id rather lose 2 quick, 7-10 min, games for 300 rep than lose one long, 40 min, game and get 120. If I even cared about honor, Id still get more from the two quick losses than one long loss. The fact that one long win is only a little better rep and honor-wise than 2 quick losses should say something.
---
Heroes in a half shell

Zug zug orc smart

The burn was so hot it got past Ragnaros's fire immunity
---
WSG prob need the 30 min match cap
---
finally won one after an hour the other day, was annoying
---
you can right click on the box and make it “priority” or “vip” or something so it will go to the start of the list
---
Hey if anyone ever gives you guff for being a guy playing a female toon feel free to use my dads explanation. 
---
&gt;If I'm going to be spending hours looking at someones ass as they run around doing quests it's going to be a females.
---
AB and WSG should've launched first. You can't efficiently bot these two the top without getting caught more often than getting away with it.
---
This would've created actual rank 14s and gave actual players a chance at some point to creep into 12 and 13 later in the game.
---
Classic WoW is now a PVE Raid Finder mmorpg that is easier than any raid finder raid in the history of wow. It's honestly become what everyone hated about retail.
---
If you've played the game with any ounce of seriousness, you now sit in town and que with pugs for AV for the next 2-3 months before the raid is out. Sick
---
Bring on TBC at this point, world PvP already died, and at least arena is challenging.
---
With warrior, do I not risk getting geared up for prot and just not being able to find a spot in a guild since they need so few tanks for raid compared to other slots?
---
Regardless of how much people deride the honor system, it at least required (pre-1.12) that you not be AFK, you fight other players, and you win games. This current version does not.
---
If you died that fast in phase 3 then it was probably either her flame breath, swipe, or maybe a tail whip. You want to try to stand in line with her shoulder/tummy area
---
I see, thanks for the input. Yeah I'm horde/tauren and got my first +1% hit piece of gear just yesterday. I do have some +crit% pieces already at least.
---
&gt;pretending AV is akin to a fancy meal
---
AV is the taco bell of battle grounds.
---
not the worst, but weather you take it slow or fast, your are not gonna be happy you did it.
---
I play moonkin, use max rank Starfire and never go oom on 90% of MC boss fights.
---
 You use demonic runes and major mana pots and you're mana is fine. I sometimes don't even use my innervate because I don't need it.
---
Assuming if you have an alt rogue with the lockpicking level you can't use him to open huh?
---
With most people preferring honor over rep now that many have finished their grind after only like a week, AV rep is pretty slow too. One 40 min game is only 100-500 rep depending on if you win or lose.
---
Spelling  /s
---
&gt;Hold my Hand
---
I love you too
---
They're hiding with the thorium veins.
---
Think he is saying he did the grind in vanilla and wished they fixed it for classic, cause it’s all just people who don’t have other things to do
---
I have done Strat live orb runs and sold tanking services and stuff (it’s how I got the gold for my epic mount) but it always feels a bit scummy... Also you need to organise a group of people who are happy to go, pass on first orb, etc. 
---
I have done Strat live runs where I have gotten orbs and epics and grey weps to sell and made upwards of 80g, but the “run” would have taken 45 minutes, not including setting up the group and travelling to the dungeon.
---
YES you can make more gold doing other things, I feel like I’ve said it a few times now, but this is solo, relies on no one, and is fairly consistent.
---
Jesus was more than cool with people drinking for 7+ hours. Hence the water into wine. This guy is just an ass.

what if a person is rushing to get exalted for the trinket that lets you port to your teams boss?
---
Out of curiosity, what's your honour earned at that point? You'd easily give us some clarity on how efficient wsg really is since to do it this fast you definitely won a healthy amount of your games even as human.
---
he's saying he wishes it was different from vanilla
---
Racials aside, alliance are lame, especially humans.
---
Exactly this - plenty of better farms for most other classes. Not so much for a prot warrior.
---
Have that! For the gank fest all horde participated in the last month or so in wpvp. 
---
So glad to hear it’s balancing out all the shit (mostly) alliance had to deal with. Don’t you dare complain peon.
---
So now i play on german server KEKW. Atleast i can have my normal name...
---
Same thing in the badlands. I saw the corpse of broken tooth and thought "oh, I have a timer on him."
---
Druid cat dps is pretty involved once power shifting comes into play
---
I did it fine, we didn't have anyone specifically stay by the well but we made sure no one ran too far away to pull shit so we weren't that far from it.
---
Bloodthirst, WW, Overpower, Heroic Strike, Cleave if needed, plus a few different cooldown abilities. And of course any side duties like taunting loose mobs.
---
It's not hard but it's not a 1 button class like mage.
---
When the lower portion of your body is positioned forward? No, it's not meant to do this long term.
---
Fury prot is online and fine in certain aspects yes, but not all. Right now you have to heavily sacrifice either TPS or Mitigation heavily, as getting both is nearly impossible with the current itemization.  I can tell you with certainty that fury/prot is at the same level as impale prot overall. You do get slightly more TPS with current fury/prot, but at the loss of HEAVY mitigation, and its not worth.  
---
Source: I am fury/prot MT right now in a speed clearing guild.

When you start flexing your income, you prove to everyone that you have insecurities.
---
Is that gromsblood? It’s down to like 9s each on my server. Why are you buying them out? Just converting to elixirs?
---
What server has these at over 1g each? My server has them down to like 20s each. Or is my math bad on this?
---
Gotta get that enchanting pattern somehow.
---
I heavily disagree, you will lvl much faster getting a blue and enchanting it as a rogue. The difference between an awesome blue sword enchanted and a green at lvl 34 is huge.
---
Id rather not perpetuate the drama without any evidence to back my words up, to be honest.
---
Rattlegore is a good server though, wouldn't trade it for any other.
---
Derivative
---
Yeah I'd love this. I want to be useful as a holy priest, but so far seems like my only choice is leveling an alt. I'm doing that, but damn it's slow.
---
I am on mograine.
---
in my experience, ally typically get galv done before horde can do balinda.
---
i suspect that is because 10 or so horde go straight to choke points and straight to base at the start.
---
Hope you don’t go thinking you’re entitled to any of my buffs, or my heals. Or if I’m tanking you best not expect me to taunt from you, manage your own aggro.
---
Honestly you just sound like someone I’d never want to group with. 99% of mages I play with happily provide water the same way other classes buff or hand out healthstones/whatever.
---
You? I’d just kick you and replace you with one of the thousands of other mages who aren’t total dicks.

Spend 100g a week ? No thanks.

---
It's 32:9 I have the same one it's awesome

Well lets see, most money making methods are going to be around 40-50g/hour. So... spend 100ish hours farming gold and you'll be chillin

Anyone able to tell me what the most popular twinking bracket was out of 19/29/39 on Vanilla and PServers?
---
I’m in a pretty small battlegroup (OCE) so not sure if that changes things.
---
I heard they can both be active at the same time but only one will impact your actual spellpower
---
Shards are simple, put a shard bag in your bank and just bank your excess from every raid\\dungeon and withdraw them before the next one. I never have to farm them anymore and start every raid with \~50 shards and by the end of the raid I'm back up to around that number which just let's me bank a bunch again. I don't get why people have issues with them.
---
PVP you'll burn through more but you can pick them up in BGs pretty fast as well.
---
Darn tank privage! I could've disenchanted that item...
---
That likely has nothing to do with their decision.  Implementing anything other than 1.12 would have cost them a lot more development hours.   It's obvious why they went with the version they had.
---
I didnt play much on open day 1/2. Total time spent about 50 hours. At least 25 of that fishing.
---
the better your rage income is (whether from wbuffs/good gear) the less value hit over 6% is, yes.
---
do you have any representative logs? I'm definitely interested to see examples of solid HS queueing without messing up other cooldowns.
---
&gt;We arent on a DKP system.....
---
and there it is.
---
19 was the most popular on both
---
I have 3, how can I set it up to display across all 3?
---
is there a list of better mage pvp gear somewhere?
---
You're thinking about wsg
---
I just wanted to be a shaman.
---
Yikes, I'd be worried if a guild spent 5k+ on a meme weapon is more like it. That gold would be 100x better used making anni, nightfall, flasks, anything but a pvp hammer.
---
It's not.  I was even more right than I thought watching the bitchfest going on in this sub about BGs.
---
Is it significantly worse than a preraid bis set for raiding? Or would i at least be able to contribute meaningful damage?
---
You didn't address my previous point regarding context. Are you open minded?
---
*Yeah guilds in which people don't get offended at every little thing are great. Your guild full of bitchy whiners are fantastic.*  
---
Well first off you wrongly assume what I consider to be Toxic Behaviour.  Maybe Toxic behaviour is people thinking they are hot shit and deserve every single loot drop for their class.. Maybe Toxic Behaviour is some jerk-off in Discord screaming into their mic over a videogame or causing infighting with the guild over trivial bullshit. 
---
*Can't wait to see the drama play out when people like you fail at BWL and harder content. It will be sooooo satisfying watching you cupcakes explode.*  
---
Then you assume that my guild, because we are level headed and nice to one another, are somehow shitty players because of it. I am proud of my guild. We have people from all over, we have active and retired military personnel, men, women, older and younger people, parents. Despite our makeup we get shit done and we get it done fast and coordinate well.  
---
*I'm a piece of shit because I don't like weak bitches? How does that work exactly? / I don't like this weird little overly-sensitive bubble culture who all talk the same way. And anyone they don't like for any reason, they call "toxic". So do tell how I'm a piece of shit for not liking that?*  
---
You're a piece of shit because you make assumptions and jump down peoples throats based on your wrong assumptions. You have probably been Gkicked from some guilds for being said piece of shit and now that you have settled into a guild full of like minded pieces of shit you go online and project on others about their perceived Echo Chambers when you yourself are likely in one.
---
The very top one is where the strat dungeon actually sits, hayven (rip) had a video on that.
---
Lok'tar!
---
One of you need to be able to tank (war pref) and one needs to heal (Priest/sham)
---
Loot competition is better for a caster shaman imo since DPS can use a lot of the cloth pieces.
---
Though for gearing purposes, one of you could sub for a druid if the war didnt want to only tank/dps, if they want healing as an option roll druid. If one goes druid other would go shaman. Ghost wolf and cheetah form compliment each other well.
---
Let me fix it:
---
"I've always hated AV, and since I've always hated it, I believe the my opinion is shared by everyone in the world.  Therefore, AV has always been a pile of shit and literally the whole world agrees with me!"
---
Have him post that instead, because that's clearly what he means.  I have always loved AV, but I'd be a fool to think everyone did, so I'd never make that blanket statement.
---
Problem is basically that the games are too short for them to ever play a factor. At least the handins were made to go by quick, so if the game lasts 30 minutes, and people have been looting corpses semi-well, you'll get the boss/wing commander no problem. The cavalry and infantry take more work though, and you'll just never see them realistically.
---
The infantry is pretty hilarious if you do get it though! They've got a bunch of units with stealth so it's pretty hilarious to see them open up on some unsuspecting enemies.
---
#NoChanges right?
---
Okay, this will only make us turtle more though now that we know you dont enjoy it. So is that the point?
---
The thing is we didn’t ask for 1.12 everything which sucks. I remember when J. Allen Brack stated if we were gonna get the pre nerf ubrs and scholo. 
---
But yeah it sucks.
---
ur obsessed lol
---
Which was a response to my question. I’m going to ask a third time, and then assume you have no interest in an actual discussion if you continue to dodge the question. Do you use racist slurs “in jest”?
---
Yr a cunt.
---
I'm not complaining just providing clarification
---
Sure give me a sec. We split our raids half alts and half mains for awhile now to funnel gear to our mains. But our warriors still parse high. I'll DM you
---
Boomkins actually can do very high DPS though, and chop off and add 3% from your next 4 top casters to them and they may even be high on the list.  It's true that they don't have the sustain for 5 minute fights, but nobody is actually taking 5 minutes on a fight right now are they?
---
As far as clear times vs progression goes, having at least 1 Boomkin is a solid choice.
---
wow you just unironically posted copypasta nice
---
As evidenced by vast number of good guilds with multiple rets, shadow priests, and moonkins.
---

If you're inefficient sure.
---
Meme specs are great, everything is fun, everything is viable. Some folks just like to whine.

---
Here is an addon guide! https://www.wowisclassic.com/en/addons/addons-pack-starting/
---
As a new player that just discovered addons, especially questie and actioneer are very usefull. Castbars aswell, you can use it to interupt spellcasts, helps in pve and pvp.
---
But im still figuring out BiS so cant help you with that
---
There is a severe excess of tanks for raids whilst dungeons are only a means to an end. 
---
Please don’t confuse the lack of dungeon tanks for a lack of raid tanks. Raid tanks are more than full and the last time our tank lead had an open slot to fill there were something like 16 applications in a day from spare tanks. I can bet it’s the same for every other server you only need 2 dedicated tanks per 40 people not 8 as per dungeons ratios.
---
OK this is seriously bugging me. Almost every clip I see on this sub people are running that 2sec rundown meter regardless of class spec or w/e. What's the point of this thing? Is it just for GCD? Because I always thought GCD was 1.5s.
---
Idk, with the games slowing down, if a few people are actually taking the time they can get a lot of rep through turn ins. I've had some games where I swear we came out with a 30-40min win and between that, Bal, and turn-ins I must have gotten 1k rep.
---
Do you have another video suggestion that covers these?  
---
Hoping to give this a try soon as I gear up.
---
What do you mean "all horde"?
---
I no life'd it this weekend and only got up to 150k on my best day. That was like an 18 hour session. Lot's of matches that weren't optimal honor tho.
---
Should have rolled a Mage instead, just bind every key to Frostbolt
---
Wait. Are you saying no elemental fire transmute in phase 3?
---
I mean, the entire internet isn't made for Americans.
---
Yah yah, the speed runs and top guilds aren't representative of the WoW community, I know I know.
---
"Alright guys they are at 20 percent start going I melee (pops all cooldowns)  but whatever you do hold off a sec on the cooldowns and let me get I bit more threat"  immediately aggros the boss and gets my face ripped off
---
what kind of stupid system is that? highest dps gets the loot? i think thats kind of a catch-22 right?
---
I got 300 fishing while watching 3.5 seasons of "The Wire"
---
No, that is not what I meant
---
Adding my related question: does hit % make any difference in the 41-49 bracket?
---
Except for they literally developed a very close to 1.7 version of AV and you can play it currently. It's been out for over a month. Considering we know the back-end is the BfA client, it's not even that drastic of a consideration. 
---
'Old School AV' is part of the great mythos of WoW. Something that people still talk about to this day on retail in it's 15th year. That is absolutely something they could have milked as an advertisement for Classic.
---
i think it's the tick timer for energy/rage/mana
---
some people use weapon swing timers too
---
Perfect, thanks!
---
There is always a super high demand on Paladins and Shamans.
---
Druids are rather rare. But also low demand. For a raid you really only need one. They're pretty decent in pvp. But so are Paladins and Shamans.
---
Fury is great DPS. Yes there are less tank spots with a guild, but for a boss fight that demands more off tanks, you would be fine to simply have a half-decent tank set to offtank. Look at MC Garr or Domo or Harbringer. The demand is that you have enough other-guys to offtank the adds while healers / DPS are stressed to kill the extra enemies in time.
---
This is completely wrong.  In fact, when it first came out, AV didn't even put you all in the same raid together.  People would abuse this by not inviting you to the raid, and would exploit the shit out of it, denying other people on their faction honor because of it.
---
Ranking up was never, and will never be, about skill.  It is purely a time investment.  The "play with friends" you should swap out for "share your account".
---
Since it appears you are Alliance by your semi-active Paladin friend, I’d say druid. It would give you the flexibility to fill in the hole at tanking or healing depending on what is needed at the time.
---
What happens when classic is done?
---
Well , then theee will be classic classic. 
---
Ez life
---
Actually there was a lot of controversy for a while about how Warden anti cheat worked in that it scanned your computer - so its entirely possible that it was just installed but he got banned.
---
Did you checked your Raid Profiles option? I checked "Keep Groups Together".
---
Private servers weren't perfect   
---
Issues that Classic have:  
---
* Wildly different itemization with overpowered gear from 1.12 patch despite having a progression of content patches. 
---
* Layering, and all the issues that came with it (I get you can argue that it's not in the game anymore, but the fact that it even existed is still valid). 
---
* Using the later iteration of AV. 
---
* Nerfed versions of raids.
---
* Spell batching. 
---
* The reckoning patch recently going against no changes.
---
* Not nearly as thorough of a phasing sequence compared to what was offered on pservers going through each patch.   
---
Issues with blizzlike servers that I had mentioned:
---
* A few changes such as halved respec cost and having BG's/ranking in at launch (which no one really complained about having, but it *is* a change). 
---
* World buffs that can go out more than every 6 hours &amp; songflower being shareable.
---
* Like you said, different stats across those things, but I'd argue they're not wildly different at all until you get to AQ40/Naxx if anything. 
---
* Mechanically, the way certain fights work (such as Onyxia behind the hood was completely different on Nostalrius, but my time playing on Lightbringer compared to Classic, the only noticeable difference beyond it being easier in Classic is the P2 to P3 threat drop).   
---
I'm not going to mention server stability, bug patches (like the whole buff/aura stuff that was fixed), and so on, because both had these issues, however for a company as large as Blizzard it definitely is more inexcusable to have these issues. However, I'd definitely would take what those private servers had done over Classic. Itemization affects way more than slightly off damage tables and resist tables.
---
Started a hunter alt. I know pet training is a thing, what pets abilities should I go after (and from what beasts) for both pve and pvp?
---
I wouldn't worry about DKP until you find a guild. Different guilds will use different variations and different addons to track or may not use addons at all. Some guilds may just use rolls, some may use a council who decides your loot, some may use GDKP which is using gold to bid on items then sharing that gold with the people in the run, some will use suicidekings which is just a random order of the guilds raiders and if you are the top on the list needing the item you'll get it and drop to the bottom etc etc.
---
There's a lot of loot systems so I'd wait until you get in a guild and just ask the guild for details. All the systems will require some trust and all can have their upsides and downsides. 
---
You don't need your BiS to start raiding, but outside of raids you can start following those guides. Find a good one that also has alternates on it as some pieces that are BiS can take ages to get if you are unlucky and their may be a far easier item to get that's basically just as good until you get a raid upgrade.
---
Other people have covered addons, key is a just a threat meter, DBM and if if you want it a dps tracker which can be handy to compare your rotation to the other people in your guild.
---
If you are unsure just ask the guild if they want you to have any other add ons or consumables or anything like that.
---
Imagine using DKP past 2006.
---
No one asked you to join.
---
Not everyone is a seasoned wow player like you, who knows all the efficient leveling locations/quests/NPCs. Some newbies are literally newbies, playing wow for the first time. Everyone starts somewhere, so don’t be a dick about it.

Yup. My most recommended interface addon if you could only choose 1. Helps your inventory management TREMENDOUSLY.

sorry im low on sleep.  Yea in a duel, snutz would bend me over and spank me like a child.
---
What's funny is you know the people bitching will never use the loot outside of raids anyway.
---
Paladins are THE best single target healers. And Shamans are THE best group healers. Priests can dish out larger heals that are not so costly than it is for Paladins. Druids are the worst healers really. Very slow casttime, mana issues, HoTs not stackable.
---
The reason why a raid needs several Paladins (and Shamans) are their buffs. Paladins have several Blessings but can only buff one blessing per Paladin on a person. The totem buffs of a Shaman only apply to their group. You have 8 groups in a raid.
---
Bored of classic?  Head on over to BFA!
---
Not until BC I think
---
6-7 losses for every win as horde? I'm at like 1 win per 10 losses, as alliance... and it seems completely effortless for horde. Alliance is still trying to rush south and horde just kills us on the way, and no one even fights back. They break the initial rush and it's already over.
---
Harsh terminology does not indicate mood. I'm just not gonna celebrate someone for being an addict like the rest of you losers. Fuck him, he's a piece of shit and he doesn't deserve applause for it.
---
rly makes u think.......
---
We're still winning most of our games on 7-10 minutes :)
---
More so because the ret can only justify his spot if he is using Nightfall, once P3 drops.
---
AV exalted literally only takes ~10 hrs total of you rush drek and win every game. So if you're alliance, you can quite easily get at least~10/40 players into the same AV, and at that point carrying is very easy since horde can't really easily get into the same games due to queues, so you could easily expect to win 9/10 games or more.
---
The alternative to internment camps was mass extinction. There was no way they would just be released. What do you think the Horde would have done if the positions were reversed?
---
It’s not a hub in practice. That’s what I mean. Fewer people hang out there. I like it because the forge is right there too
---
Aye. Our situation was that we had it our loot rules that perdition's goes to a dagger rogue over sword rogue (as in they've been cooking to raids as daggers). One rogue threw a hissy because he was swords but had a dagger ready to go in his bags. Him and his buddies left after that (a few remained and left two or so weeks after). After the incident we had a long discussion with the melee folks to get their input and have since changed our rules to be a bit more fine tuned and ensure everyone has read them. 
---
Was a bummer that night, though. Had just got mageblsde and had maybe 20 minutes to enjoy that high of a new weapon before that shitstorm lol
---
Yeah its weird that the fastest parse is not the highest dps? 
---
The logs I linked definitely have tanks using sunder though
---

---
Here is the Garr fight from one, sunder with 92.75% uptime, 100 parses.
---
Almost makes me wonder if they are fudging logs? How could they have a slower kill but such insane DPS? Doesn't make sense.
---
Gnome Paladin.
---
Pretty sure this is 32:9, meaning its really just 16:9 2 monitor but no bar in the middle. I also assume you can make it into two monitors
---
Congratulations, you've invalidated literally every team based strategy. Moron.
---
Find what spec you want to main and look up its preraid BiS list. Ignore the xp and start farming those dungeons for gear. You’ll get a couple levels, get pretty well geared and be ready for life at 60.
---
You guys should work on killing Ragnaros, he’sthe boss that stops this stuff.
---
Finding and fucking with bots is a gleeful experience.
---
you get called out for being defensive so you resort to the ol' "no u." nice one.
---
it's obvious you have no response to anything i've brought up otherwise you would have said it instead of just getting triggered and trying to insult me.
---
I'll take it. I want "No changes" more than I want changes period. The more the change and give in to whining the more likely the game gets fucked up.
---
So far nochanges has killed LFG mods autogrouping, killed a bug where people got extra hits on extra attacks and more. When TBC classic comes along Ill be cheering for the same thing.
---
Yep, it is extremely hard to get used to as a retail healer going back to Classic
---
DKP system but the mage didn't think the Druid should be allowed to bid.
---
The AV quests award ~4g if completed at level 60
---
getting more honor in YOUR match makes you do better against your own faction as well, basically winning doesn’t matter is the point, whoosh
---
2019 wow wants a pretty tree in horde cities!?!?
---
And you’re upset that they achieve more than you in a video game
---
Consider kicking the paladin thats complaining if he continues to make too much of a fuss about this, I think giving it to the paladin with the hammer is the right choice.
---
yeh but u drink a flask and it's gone :&lt; but a cool hammer is forever
---
I focused on stamina and armor and then their individual ability (claw, bite, furious howl, dash, etc) because they essentially act like your tank.
---
Forgot the name of the boss but one also in Scholomance
---
Then you will struggle with long fights in the next tiers. If your guild is not learning how to conserve mana, they will have a rude awakening when the first fight goes over 3 minutes.
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
If she was playing it would be ferocious bite on repeat. No combo points needed.
---
Also "help with morbent fel?" all day errday.
---
But it doesn't really bother me that much.  Easy enough to answer questions or take 20 minutes to make somebody's day a little easier.
---
I got stuck looting these guys.  Then I couldnt log back in when I logged out.  Glad it wasnt just me!
---
So you're saying I should be able to skin Feral Druids? Nice!
---
Mix of bartender4 and shadowed unit frames.
---
 I sorry I should have mentioned I am 2h fury but I imagine the timing would be somewhat the same as I have to bandage and eat a decent amount where you shouldn’t have to
---
The perk of Loot Council is that you don't have to worry about some silly point system dictating your raid, the con is that you have people that believe they are more worthy than others. Honestly, people who take it more than 24 hours of venting probably just need to get a reality check and get over it. It's Classic, loot is sparse and that reality has to be managed.
---
So beind 2nd last on the dmg meter is his whole arguement lol
---
13-15 minutes in queue for a 5-10 minute game.
---
are you sure you're looking at good specs? every spec in the druid discord that goes deep enough into resto to pick it up grabs it, because it's that useful. the power is that it lets you drop a rank 10 HT on the tank when they're dropping low without having to go through the full 3 second cast. even if you're focusing on raid healing, having an emergency button to save the tank or a key person is super useful.
---
btw, improved rejuv is a pretty weak talent. it only boosts the healing of baseline rejuv without accounting for any +healing. if you use rejuv a LOT, like you're the one that's rejuving the tanks, or if you're using swiftmend, then it's good, but if you're not using rejuv a lot or there are other druids with more +healing, you should just spec out of it. put those points into nature's swiftness and nature's grace, and the last point wherever. 
---
grace isn't all that amazing unless you have 5/8 t2 and run the regrowth build, but it's still pretty handy imo, especially for just one point.
---
What do you mean cutting tanks to 2/3? Thats the standard number for def tanks lol. Everyone else is Fury and gets into tank gear only when necessary (Garr and Majordomo).
---
I have no clue I hope you are right lol
---
warlocks can be assholes bc it fits the rp (if they wish) and summons have probably saved several lifetime's worth of time (like asshole dr house or something they are saving lives)
---
I was completely unaware of such a piece of gear, that would be a pretty good reason to play. 
---
Notice though, play is very different from lose intentionally as quick as possible as many times as your mental capacity allows.
---
I guarantee we will clear AQ40 and beyond with our 2 ret pallies that we enjoy playing with.
---
Honestly you really are lucky it's just the OH since the drop rate is much higher than the MH. I got 5 OH before the MH finally dropped for me in at least 30 or so runs sorry to hear about it though.
---
Personally I don't but I don't see a problem with other people liking it this way, just wish it was optional so everyone can choose what they like xD
---
I mean, there's certainly a lot of fan art/comics/etc to that end... though in fairness, the same can be said of Sylvanas. ;)
---
If you read this thread you will see that I am not the biggest advocate for Thick Hide at all. Although armour cap is a main priority for a Feral tank you will achieve that anyways without Thick Hide albeit a little later in terms of game content. As for Feral Instincts the threat is nice but the stealth bonus is huge for PvP and MCP farming so I obviously went 5/5.
---
Here is my build: [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005201-5051001323022151-05002](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/014005201-5051001323022151-05002) 
---
You can take one point from Improved Shred and put it into Brutal Impact for a little more CC. Another possible change is to not take Primal Fury as you will never be rage starved in a raid however it is very useful when fighting slow hitting classes like Arms Warriors and Paladins as the crit and rage bonus can swing a fight.
---
ah damn ok well thats good to know I didnt fuck something up
---
So THAT'S where the Game of Thrones showrunners got their logic on the army strengths in Season 8...
---
Loot council is the best for serious progression. It assures loot stays with dedicated members of the guild, within the right team, etc, all for the betterment of guild progression. It prioritizes guild progression over individual "wants" heavily and is by far the most efficient way to run a guild. It wont work with a bunch of children whining over drops, though.
---
Don't worry dude, if you are doing MC you can just show up with 5 shards and build a pile of them on trash. If you are doing ony you should bring some more def.
---
those are spots to farm high value blue boes
---
I would rather make a decision based on a players time online and current gold. Instead of it being a PvP roll to a guy doing AV for 6 hours everyday and farming 2 hours a week :p
---
Probably because chests have different loot rules. You just walk up to and take whatever you want in a chest with no rolls. You could hypothetically do the same thing with chest of 7 in brd.
---
thanks for this, i figured R11 wouldnt be that hard for the mount.... but.... it is :P
---
AV MOUNT! HERE I COME!
---
That's amazing, exactly how I think a guild should be.
---
In vanilla we always let our GM have the gold from bosses, and then he would supply the whole raid with potions/flasks/repairs whenever needed. Good times.
---
Should be a guild ranking
---
I would probably say TBC plus.
---
What happens if people give up and get burnt out? How about they take off AV queueing to watch some bowl games or play destiny 2 or some star wars during Christmas and new years?
---
Life on the internet.
---
Hi Folks,
---
My guild is doing a secret santa with in game goods. I got paired with my class leader (mage). He is a really nice guy, but he is obsessed with data and writing out class guides etc. Is there any in game items I can gift him that encapsulate that?
---
EPL off peak hours - been averaging 1 black lotus an hour + dreamfoil/plaguebloom/silversage on top of it. Can get 60-70g recently but typically 50g an hour when I was less lucky with the lotus.
---
Me and my buddy have a lot of fun as a druid and a mage. Now at 60, we can farm *most* of the dungeons under BRD just the two of us. Druid tanks and heals, mage brings down the baddies. Good money and quite fun.
---
Grob represent!
---
&gt;They are willing to go this far because the alternative is going back to being commodity. It’s hard to blame a whole people for trying to remain free when surrounded by those who would oppress them.
---
You must be misinformed... who is surrounding the horde who would oppress them? Theramore is to the south lead by Jaina Proudmore who in case you forgot betrayed her own father in defense of the orcs. Jaina for years was the only one keeping peace between the horde and alliance alive. She finally got sick of their crap after garrosh. So at this point in Vanilla she's not an oppressor. 
---
North of the orcs are the Night Elves who have zero interest in oppressing the orcs. They just want the orcs to gtfo of ashenvale. There's still horde lumber mills in ashenvale 4 years after the events of warcraft 3... withdraw the horde from ashenvale and you can have peace.
---
I found the largest subreddit I could for each realm and used those data for my graph. A few interesting notes:
---
* Some realms have upwards of *five* subreddits, interestingly enough. I'm looking at you, Sulfuras!
---
* Apparently, Benediction recently had a moderator "go rogue" and close their subreddit, so they lost whatever effort they put into r/Benediction and recently reformed as /r/classic_benediction.
---
* r/Fairbanks is *not* the Fairbanks realm subreddit, lol.
---
Who needs to buy fish from vendors? They're always on the AH cheap.

He means there's zero reason for anything to be in the posted pic except the tooltip part. It's useless white space that isn't relevant to what you're trying to convey.  Plus, anyone on a phone has to zoom in to see what you're going on about because of all the useless stuff in your pic. 
---
Next time take 30 seconds to open it in Paint, select the bit you want to show, crop it, then save.
---
They’re what classic is 
---
Unfinished
---
&gt;If you've played the game with any ounce of seriousness, you now sit in town and que with pugs for AV for the next 2-3 months before the raid is out. Sick
---
This blows my mind. What do you mean by "Seriousness"? I have played every day except a handful of travel/family days. I took 3 PTO Days when it first came out and own 2 accounts. 
---
I am still trying to get Tier 2 helm and other MC epics like an epic weapon/offhand. I don't have an epic mount yet. I'm probably going to only be Rank 4 MAYBE 5 this week. 
---
There is SO much to do in this game and if you do it all on one character there's like 8 other classes for you to play with and figure out. If you're just sitting in town Qing for a dungeon that you don't find fun that seems like a you problem. 
---
If you're playing this game to just cap out on the best things in the most efficient way then ya there's gonna be some real down points and you're gonna get bored fast. If you enjoy the game and just do whatever you think sounds fun in the moment like leveling an alt or starting a new profession or something there's always something to do.
---
Some crimes against Demonity right here. Come over to the Horde side. We will embrace you with open arms, and then youll only have to fight mages and warlocks.
---
We actually don't exactly know each other IRL exactly.  However, the guild was basically put together through the grapevine of players on our original vanilla server (Blackhand).  Many of us who stopped playing kept in touch through steam and other multiplayer games and basically we kinda just threw together a guild. A majority of the guild (~70%) played on Blackhand in the top guilds from back in the day so we all sort of have the "been there done that" attitude.  It's mostly chill, though we have had 1 or 2 loot drama happen already.  Our GM and I (an officer) are actually pretty good buds, and he plays the AH well and is setting us up for future success.
---
If you mean on the subscription that will not happen, ever.
---
I actually suspect this week was as easy as it's going to be for the next few months. More people participating casually means more open spots for top brackets.
---
forgot all about that racial
---
If we are just following what the best guild does, its worth noting the world 1st speedrunner guild gave that boomkin *zero* gear.
---
Hi, /u/izi-kid-get-rekt
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ebmib4/what_server_to_roll_alliance_for_pvp/).
---
While I appreciate your post and find it very informative, I disregard some of your conclusions. 
---
First of all, PvP participation will just decrease from this popint forward, therefore completing the blue set as fast as possible should be top priority for everyone. 
---
Secondly, the difference in terms of efficiency after rank 10+ is not worth it due to the exponential difficulty increase in getting the superior rank, unless you are in a guild that controls server rankings. 
---
Thirdly, I don't think waves will happen at all due to cross realm BG. In 4-5 weeks people reaching for 10+ will just collude and rotate at the top of the leader boards (to get rank 13-14). Depending on the size on your faction that participates in PvP, this rotation will take anywhere from 12 weeks to 20 weeks.
---
The guild should at least provide ingots imo
---
Is it a crazy idea for a holy/prot pally to use a fast 1h in PVP with SoJ for fast stuns? The wowhead talent calculator prot tree One-handed Weapon Specialization includes daggers in the list for effected weapon types. I wonder if a dagger + SoJ would make any sense. My damage would be pretty trash anyway and my focus is on healing but the stun is still helpful. Are SoJ stuns calculated in diminishing returns with other stuns like Hammer of Justice?
---
1st and second day maybe 5-10% premade, third day half my matches.
---
My mistake
---
Ofc you did.
---
I'm 30 gold away from my epic mount... I just can't do it anymore.  Every minute I spend playing this game feels like a waste of my life. Now that I'm at endgame I see the treadmill and I don't like it. I don't like raiding, running dungeons for gear feels like a waste of time, and every time I queue for a bg it's a fucking premade every single time. I don't really know where to go.
---
Blame the people that decided to use the system to troll people for lulz. Or to try and get their friends in the BG. 
---
A child can't use its toys sensibly? You take the toys off the child. That's what happened here.
---
Don't forget, when posting your DPS numbers on reddit the equation is x=y(z)+50, where x is the total dps you want to tell reddit, y is the real dps you do, and z is the handicap you give yourself for things like if you didn't feel like using an elixir or you weren't trying very hard. Usually on reddit z is 1.1 or so. So you really do like 180 dps? Go ahead and make that a solid 300.
---
As an Australian I'm confused why he ignored you?
---
He basically said "thanks for the portal cunt" which is a positive but then ignored you?
---
Orcs genocided the draenei and razed stormwind unprovoked and yet they wonder why humans put them in camps?
---
TBC was the sweet spot for me, i hope it becomes a real thing in the future.
---
I go 3am server time have all to myself. I got a flawless sphere yesterday!
---
Ah okay, I see, thanks!
---
Yes, it got mildly infuriating
---
Hold the fuck up. How does someone raid as a ret pally with only one other ret pally and NOT notice he's been using the Sulfuron Hammer for several weeks?
---
I mean, my guild isn't a speed run or a top guild by any stretch of the imagination and our tanks are pulling 200-300 and our rets doing ~250. Sounds more like you've just got players running around in random items with no clue what they're meant to be doing or gearing for.
---
No, I dont but its irrelevnet in the example I gave. Game-queue-Game vs Game.  In both scenarios you end up queueing for a new one.
---
It’s pretty shitty when ppl do it right up at the mic
---
The question actually asks if I should use BSH in my offhand, or use AotDW. Since Frostbite can go in either hand, my question is technically worded correctly. Just because you are unable to read good doesn't make me the asshole for your 1/10 effort answer.
---
Sounds like servers should be ghost towns...oh wait they’re still unbearably full
---
looks good, needs some paint
---
Don't let facts get in the way of horde fanaticism.
---
 you don't need dps CDs to do well.  You just need lots of targets 
---
Speaking from a mage pov
---
People will prolly demand wowprogress logs or simular pretty soon for higher raid tiers
---
There's also a thin strip of glitchy land north of Statholme. I've been there and it leads to the uninstanced classic version of what would become ghostlands called "Quel'thalas" all it is is some Azshara style style ruins with a tower and a Darnassus style dock.
---
Complete the quests and it comes in the mail 24 hours later

I think it's the grinch quest, but I can't remember exactly which one
---
True but their oppressors were invaded twice and lost entire Kingdoms and untold numbers of men, women, and children to the monsters.
---
Imagine Aliens invaded your planet and toppled 50% of all Human civilization. 
---
They murder, rape, and pillage with ferocity and blood lust unseen even among the wars between men.
---
You beat them back. They return and you're forced to beat them back a second time and cut off their means of continued invasions (Dark Portal).
---
The remnants of these literal alien nightmare monsters then get interned like the dangerous beasts they are.
---
But suddenly "Oh, this is racism! We are oppressed."
---
The Orcs chose war and battle, time and time again.
---
On Draenor. With Grom, with the Burning Legion, with Garrosh and with Sylvanas.
---
Thrall is a blip on the radar compared to all else the Horde did, and continues to do after Thrall gave up his seat.
---
This griping whiner of an entitled player needs to suck it up, get over himself, and get a grip on reality. In no world should he be getting the hammer over the guy who already had hammer built.
---
See first 2 points of my example. He would lose up to 0.5 rank.
---
The impact really depends on what your current rank is. The top rank right now is R9 (67%). Dropping down to R9 (17%) isn't the end of the world and really just delays their goal by a week or so. Dropping from R13 (99%) to R13 (49%) is much more punishing as you would lose 2-3 weeks of progress.
---
jesus fucking christ I'm gonna make one of these videos just to show the actual fucking route
---
0/30/21 probably not the most optimal spec for either tanking or healing. But Druid mana problems will become a lot better when you have 3 piece t2 and ace of beasts trinket. Really surprised you don’t take omen for the free clear cast. But depends on how much tanking and healing is really going on within the raids. If it was me I’d ask the guild to treat you like a shadow priest so you can just be feral only healing if short healers or pushing content.Being half a tank or half a healers isn’t fun imo.
---
Can confirm. Was a massive pain in the ass for me, too. 
---
I basically pugged full runs because that was the only way I could find groups that included Quartermaster.
---
Okay, wow what a write up.  Made me realize how little I understand about the honor system....
---
Is it possible to get from 80% R5 - R7?  From what I understand based on the brackets, I need ~7600 RP which should be attainable?  Or do I need 2k RP to finish R5, then 20k more for R6 (for a total of 22k)?
---
Yeah that's fair. But because it's farmable without limit, loot trading would cause some pretty big negative side effects.
---
Why do people always have to put music to there videos. Your music isn’t cool it’s fucking stupid to most people that watch. Couldn’t even get through 30 secs of it.
---
That rushing drek strategy with a high win rate for alliance ended after the first few days for various reasons. This weekend as alliance, I won maybe 20% of the time so rep gain has been much slower. But yes, If you can have some sort of premade arrangement, that would be the fastest way.
---
A well run organization, whether it's a business or a WoW guild, is almost always a pleasure to be a part of.
---
&gt;What do you think the Horde would have done if the positions were reversed?
---
We're on EU Servers, so cunt is an insult. He was most likely pissed that I didn't give him a special-boy portal to IF and decided to send me off with some rude words letting me know that I had wronged him.
---
I feel you. That's how I felt once I got to 60 with my mage. Decided to roll a rogue, currently at lvl 52 if I feel like I felt with my mage  at endgame then I'm gonna stop playing wow, cus I don't like raiding or spamming dungeons for gear neither. I like AV and wsg but without an epic mount im useless. 800g for a fuckin mount is too godam much.
---
Details! Is the threat meter, and yeah you only need MonolithDKP if you're raiding and your guild is using it. Also, there's more hunters than there are warlocks on average, so loot might be slightly harder to get, but I'm sure it'll work out. I cannot stress enough the importance of finding a good guild you can find a weekly spot in and in my personal experience, avoid loot councils.
---
This killed me 😅 i have a pharmacology exam tomrrow btw
---
I got a steal of a deal in a Transmite Undeath to Water at 120g two and a half months ago.  It’s already made me twice what I would have made if I had sold the recipe then.  Think long game bud.
---
It's heavily class dependant. For mages (I am a mage), the boots and shoulders are bis until bwl, but also are bis during AQ because Ringos Blizzard boots are obviously not great for fire mage.
---
I can't speak to other classes, because I don't really know how good their pvp gear is
---
OP can still run wow on middle part of screen and have netflix on side as if it were 2 or 3 monitors. Really cool.
---
Except that there are hundreds of people on each server thinking this exact same thing.
---
Nope, that's the issue. All they bring is bad DPS + some buffs, but those same buffs can also be given by Holy Paladins (who are one of the best healers).
---
I find it hilarious how obsessed people have been with "pre-raid bis" in classic. No way I'm paying 350 for that.
---
And that's why anybody subscribes right? So that they can feel like a person with lots of honor points. BLEH.
---
I worded that poorly, I meant that they intend to use GBank mats, which isnt really a huge portion of it but still significant considering BWL will be soon.  Either way, as I said not worth alienating myself and possibly having to find a new guild when this one is clearing MC in under 2hrs consistently.
---
You say you don't know where people are getting all of this gold from but you also say you are raid logging.
---
Herbalism can make you tons of money... Woosh around the plaguelands and pickup everything, vendor the arthas tears and AH the rest.
---
No no no, you don’t get it he HAS to do them all or he’s an epik nub!!!
---
You want +Frost and +Spell Damage. And those dungeon sets have very little on there.
---
People have been complaining about this since week 1, dont want to let you down, but i dont think its happening.... sorry....
---
How the hell is ”she” higher then Mercy :S
---
Yes I realized the fault in my ways and send him a few hundred gold in hopes that he may one day forgive my crimes.
---
this is the right answer. shadowplay almost costs no processor resources whatsoever, as the capturing is achieved through the gpu. i love using shadowplay.
---
The post was a question which he answered, that he personally doesn’t enjoy it.
---
I mean, you're right, it doesn't drop in EPL during vanilla. But 800 kills is not even close to a decent sample size to prove anything.
---
Is that puisant cape? If so gz!!
---
Grobb on top as expected
---
I think they're spending as little as possible until they can figure out how to wedge in the cash shop.
---
Part of the point of my post is to show how meaningless middle brackets are. Anyone who's not consistently Bracket 11+ is most likely not getting R10.
---
I was speaking specifically of those that have now begun raid logging, not of the general population.
---

I was going to ask about dots is there anything I can do against dots as a rogue every time I get dots with like 5 different dot spell I can’t do anything about it, I have a trinket that dispell 1 bleeding spell but since I have like 5 on me it will not make any difference.
---
&gt;Our guild doesnt support with Gold or Arcanite Bars or whatsoever. 
---
literally why tho
---
Yeah when you think about what went down there it really sends home just how evil Arthas was.
---
On one side you have Undead with a Dreadlord commanding the town be purged by turning them all to undead. Monsters going door to door turning people into undead.
---
On the other end of town you have Arthas and the Alliance brutally murdering people who are infected but not yet turned to undead and lighting their homes on fire to purge the infected. Fires begin raging uncontrollably throughout the city and still burn hot years after the fact.
---
Meanwhile untold numbers of the people in town are infected and actively turning to undeath and attacking their friends, family, and neighbors while Arthas and the Dreadlords armies close in like the jaws of some beast.
---
All the while women and children are trying to flee a town without any means of escape. Their options are death by fire or death by becoming undead, swiftly followed by death again by fire.
---
&gt;Yes they do, I promise. You’re vastly underestimating the capability of your characters.
---
You're vastly overestimating the capability of our players. 
---
&gt;We don't have...the skill to do that
---
That's the issue for most guilds
---
&gt;. As for your comment about dps, it’s not about making the encounter short enough for fury prot to be viable, it’s about the tank putting out enough tps that your dps aren’t in danger of pulling threat.
---
That's no issue at all, there's 6 people in our guild who can pull threat on a good day. There's 24 who aren't even close. Increasing 6 people's threat by 20 dps doesn't matter at all when we could increase those 24 by 100 dps and still they'd be mediocre and threat wouldn't matter. 6 people with good dps can't carry a fight hard enough to speed it up so the healers don't run out of mana. 
---
&gt;I’m in full prebis now with an OEB and I’m able to do 700-1200 dps pretty consistently
---
Good for you, nobody is even close, and I only ever see that in guilds where they're fully buffed with ony and other world buffs, we're not getting those because we raid an hour or two later than other guilds and they pop ony first. If I had that I could probably hit 600 or so dps and I'm the top dps in our guild. Also I'd like to see your median parses and not just your best parse. 
---
&gt;Our fastest mc clear is like 70 min, a far cry from any of the actual speed clear guilds.
---
You realize you're talking from the 1% and saying "Oh the .1% is richer so you can just be good like us, we're not hardcore." Like I get it, I'm with you, but the vast majority of people playing are not like that. You're not dealing with the median player, you're dealing with the top 5% player at worse.
---
human = sword
---
6 months after release would be pretty good considering how slowly vanilla gears people. It's a gearing issue which is down to time, not the complexity or difficulty of the fights.
---
Mythic isn't like that, skill matters way more than the gear you get in there.
---
I am aware it's Warsong, I'm saying that many people were exalted with the Warsong Gulch Silverwing Sentinels 2 days ago.
---
My guild (Alliance) ran like a 15 person premade the other night and we started all our games by waiting in the bunker with Balinda, wiping the Horde raid that came to kill her, then slowly moving down the map killing every Horde trying to take objectives until we eventually choked them out of the map. If a group snuck by and managed to ninja cap a graveyard or tower near base, one group would trinket hearth back, kill them, and ride south again. Our AVs took ~45 minutes each, we never lost one, and our team’s DPS would have ~30-40 killing blows each. It was good honor, rep, and tons of fun. 
---
AV can be and is super fun, you just need to treat it like a 15-20 man raid. Get into a premade and have a blast with it
---
Grobbulus is the definition of community.
---
Never left Draenor; defended it from the Scourge perhaps.
---
Halloween candy, firewater, and Sejin village buff and you can't get INTO the berserker buff hut.
---
yep you just have to hover over them til you figure out which ones you want that for. i only discovered it recently myself
---
&gt; But for a new inexperienced guild it's unfortunate that 3 or 4 raid spots are filled by Rets.
---
MC was one shot by a guild that didn't even had everyone at 60. The DPS isn't the issue there
---
Actually, no. That's why it's represented as essentially a zero. I meant to add a mark denoting that there is no subreddit for it, to my knowledge.
---
Why are you still playing? It’s obvious that you’re not enjoying it. 
---
I hope you at least enjoyed the levelling part so it wasn’t a complete waste of time, but there’s no point pouring more time into something you don’t like.
---
I admit, this made me chuckle.
---
Can i casually get rank 12?
---
plz say yes
---
There's a ton of running around, too. Gotta find the guy, in BRD, fly to redridge, fly to stormwind, fly back to redridge, go back to BRD....it's tedious.
---
I can't get game capture to show video on OBS :( only audio. Not sure why.
---
eye of shadow doesn't drop in MC it was an eye of divinity
---
That is for energy ticks.
---
Energy ticks are super important for playing feral druid well, have to properly time your power shifts to get that good deeps.
---
Brd emp room?
---
I'd love it if they were all 5-10 min lol
---

---
&gt;after the gear is there 
---
Just glancing over the part where you actually have to get through Naxx to get the gear first huh?
---
Friend who plays rogue is extremely active and probably the most likely one to stick significantly longer than me.
---
I think Paladins are the only class with no tolerable dps specs.
---
Feral druid and Elemental shaman are at least tolerable dps along with their utility.
---
Took 30 mins to figure that out? I dont understand how Alliance lose based on the competition... we must be even slower....
---
Do the Christmas items poor away after Christmas like the Halloween masks
---
showmemyheals is the best you can get. it will still put the text above your head but at least it will show what you healed your target for
---
Yeah R10 is pretty hardcore. R7 and 8 have huge PvE upgrades though that a lot of people are going for, and this week was very hard for those people.
---
Pretty sure he means duo running with a healer or trio with healer + dps for gold farming:)
---
I pulled aggro and wiped the raid on my first only, you're good =)
---
Hey man that’s great, thanks for the info. I’m not sure about you but I don’t see Pendulum of Doom dripping very often at all, in fact I think some people think it’s one of the rarest items in the game.
---
You’re right that those items would net you more gold, but none of them are guaranteed. This RFD method is guaranteed, albeit, much lower gold per hour compared to MANY other methods (as I’ve said a few times in comments and in the video).
---
If casually means 80 hours a week, yes.
---
If you're not enjoying yourself, take a break or just stop playing entirely. I'm sure your times too important to be doing something that you don't enjoy when its supposed to be entertainment.
---
That doesn't make it non-canon, just because it hasn't happened yet.
---
Some people are very good at auctioneering. You can make great money by placing bids on things under value but enough to push it off page 1, and the person forgets to cancel

---
Someone was faerie fires... :P
---
They're dead, they no longer have the capacity to care. When I die, I want my future grandchildren to turn me into a lampshade
---
You run to the tent, dont have to jump on it....its simple out ranging of NPC agro.....
---
Paladin. Always needed, and low in supply.
---
bracket 13  and i am not even starting to grind for r14  this is motivating to me :P
---
i only want  r13 since i have eye of rag but i guess  ill go for 14 and take those sweet fury weapons too if it stays like this
---
The amount of loot drama I have experienced as a CoGM in classic is horrendous. So many people out for themselves. Literally had people trial to guild and the first boss kill get pissed and go off in raid that they didn’t get an item over someone that had been in guild since launch because it was “a bigger upgrade for me”
---
Shadowburn on CD for boss fights really ups your DPS during raids. I'll bring 40 shards to a raid, easily.
---
Why waste gold or other stuff for a PvP only weapon? The enhancer has to play with nightfall the entire time at p3
---
finally got exalted today, the games have gotten terrible since the 10th
---
Its amazing the amount of players who thinks hybrids dont deserve loot and/or raidspots because they didnt roll the class  they are supposed to play
---
Sounds like you have to many Ret Pallys
---
Oh so now that you've hit exalted they should nerf the rep gain for others? Good one
---
They don't bring some of the best buffs. Out of all the healer hybrids, they actually probably have the weakest buffs.
---
holup, it absolutely does not have more AP, so I'm really sire you have no idea what you're talking about
---
Thanks for the feedback. You and other comments and DMs were all really quite polite about it and helped us see our mistake.
---
Cause the first two are worthy reasons to kick you stupid fuck
---
Not really. Game is very gear dependent. Most classes have a raid rotation of like 1-3 abilities. Having gear funneled to you doesn't make you skillful. 
---
Not only that but it's very class dependent too. A shit mage/warrior/rogue is always going to demolish an amazing ret pally. 
---
Comparing skill really only comes into play if you have 2 identical characters. Even though, numbers will reflect how lucky they get with hits/crits/misses/etc.
---
Pre-60 and post-60 are different games.  It's always welcome to have a raid-geared 60 drop in and help with something, but for day to day stuff it's nice when people who are leveling can just help each other.
---
&gt;If it's a chest/tribute, anyone can loot it though.
---
Definitely for the trib chest, but I've heard that this is not true for the Domo chest and the normal loot rules apply. Can anyone with first hand experience in classic comment?
---
Rich get richer in that system.
---
Oh yea, R7 is great and truly a casual rank. It's even the single biggest damage upgrade for Hunters due to the gloves.
---
Nice
---
Time to retire that character and reroll
---
you dont go hemo with daggers.
---
Is it possible you went though portal and dropped group? I think that stops anyone else from using it and has happened to me before but still no reason to whisper someone a cunt lol
---
Do you have ANY idea how many people called me a bull shit liar when I told them you can do this to bots? Then I posted a video and it got deleted because apparently I faked it. Fucking hell.
---
He didn't say 20 man BWL runs, he said 20man runs to gear up for bwl. The 20man runs being current content to prepare for the BWL launch, so 20man ony and MC.
---
Holy shit, so being rank 3 right now, it’s unrealistic to believe I can get rank 7 with a couple hours of AV grind...
---
Similar thing happening in my guild. Gave the eye to an enhance shammy, but now he just raid logs and doesn't put any effort into the game at all, don't think he will ever get a single ingot.
---
4 x as much, to be exact. It only takes 7 loads of resources from the enemy mine to call an infantry charge, compared to 28 from your own.
---
sheep and leave my man.
---
Prove it by teaching your dad how to break honorspy. Vid or didn't happen.
---
Benediction is pretty decent. Faction balance isn't as bad as many, and since BGs opened up, PvP has been pretty chill. Sure, it happens in the world sometimes, but it's quite common for us to wave and do our thing unless there's an expensive resource to be had. Corpse camping isn't really a thing anymore.
---
When I realized I need about 255-260 wins, with turnins, to get to honored with WSG I kind of lost all my energy and will to get the rewards I was hoping for. Maybe it would be more fun on a class that can be more helpful than a badly played warrior.
---
I dont know, maybe? Several had gone through and a few were using hearthstones when i went through and later dropped group. Was kind of assuming it was fine. But interesting if that is the case!
---
This happened to me like two weeks after launch and I hated it. It fixed itself but this patch brought it back. People I've added on bnet are people I talk to a lot and I'd like to see them first
---
No everybody is losing the games when both teams turtle and the players cycle through leaving and joining an endless game. Sure it’s cool is guess but I like downvotes.
---
Niiiiiiiiiiiiice
---
Plus we have a couple locks with the staff, and pallies can't use it.
---
it's from the vendor outside AV.
---
I read 3.5 or slower
---
Why would anyone want to play on a server where a bunch of skill-less people play. Role play servers are for people who enjoy talking like a fucking pirate or some shit. It’s cringe inducing
---
Red Arrow: Stratholme. The city is incredibly big story wise.  
---
Top blue arrow: Twilight Highlands  
---
Bottom blue arrow: idk
---
Thank you! :3
---
It's unrealistic at your current rate. Starting from Rank 3, Rank 7 would require a couple hours every night for 2-3 weeks.
---
Warden scans files, basically violates you. If you have CE on your computer you can comp a ban.
---
That applies to every spec.
---
They were not used in TBC though....
---
Super Mario lmfao
---
That's the exact alliance strategy right now (except galv obviously)
---
When did your friends get banned?
---
Was stoked they did this, I’m always offline in bnet anyways and was tired of having to scroll through a long list of people playing on other servers whenever I wanted to check who’s online in game. I can see some people may have the opposite problem though, they should have just added an option
---
Everyone can be replaced if they have a shitty attitude.  
---
No one should be excused because of their role
---
This is exactly why I realized classic wasnt for me. Classic revolves around someone getting something speciAl and evrryone else sitting there looking stupid. Yeah no thanks I'm noT About that agendA. the way legendaries/artifacts/loot works now is a thousand times better and thats why they replaced this.
---
Bro, if you plan to get decent gear or raid Molten Core or Onyxia you **have** to spend a shit ton of time in BRD, like were talking at least like 4 or 5 runs worth to finish up quests, probably even more.
---
Onyxia and Molten Core attunement quest lines will force you to do BRD. There is tons of pre-bis equipment in there for you too.
---
If you expect to do any endgame content you will be doing BRD. If you want to wait till you're level 60 go right ahead. But you're going to have to do it anyways so you might as well do it when its level appropriate and will give you experience along the way. It wont go much faster at 60 so you might as well start now so you can do level 60 dungeons when you're 60 instead of being forced to backtrack.
---
Once you do it at 60 you're only completing the quests, not gaining anymore experience.
---
Dont be stubborn, go into BRD.
---
I hit level 52 and started Onyxia Attunement and all the BRD quests and Princess questline.
---
By the time I killed the Emperor, finished all the side quests in BRD, finished Onyxia Attunement and Molten Core attunement I was about level 58.
---
Then I started hitting Stratholme, LBRS, UBRS, Scholomance and so on from 58-60.
---
Solo leveling a warrior is aids. Quests are slower unless you're using a super time efficient guide.
---
BRD is the first step into the endgame content. If you plan on hitting 60 and quitting then by all means just level and finish.
---
But if you have any desire to raid or even get good gear, you need to do BRD and the associated quests.
---
Good gold, good experience, good loot, quests that are required to do endgame raids and content.
---
The answer is obvious.
---
Priest shaman can grind with very little downtime and it's fun as hell when things get squirrely.
---
So the guy who put thousands of gold in so he could have it same day as it dropped is the transmog guy, and the who hasn’t put anything in is the guy who actually use it to it’s full potential?
---
I think they have it becuase #nochanges...
---
You're still a cunt /s
---
This takes them out of circulation so that they don't take resources from other players. Also it stops the botters from getting what they wanted, a win win.
---
Lots of books, like [Peeling the Onion] and [A Thoroughly Read Copy of Nat Pagle's Guide to Extreme Anglin] and of course [The Arcanist's Cookbook] and [Foror's Guide to Dragonslaying] (PERFECT FOR MAGE).
---
I guess my memory of people who wanted changed getting downvoted into oblivion was actually just my imagination and definitely not a daily occurrence on both this sub and the official forums.
---
Grats
---
You’re completely wrong. They have a specific section of their website where you can recover an item you vendored.
---
I know this for a fact because I did it a few weeks ago. You receive it in the mail in less than an hour with a cod price of whatever you vendored it for.
---
I Faerie fire rogues and about 1/2 of them still vanish, and then probably complain that it doesnt work.
---
I mean you are what you eat ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
World Of How Does Anyone Still Have An Army!? Was just too long of a name, I guess.
---
Then again... warcraft and starcraft are based off of warhammer and 40k... which suffer the same problem, really.  So I guess it's no surprise.
---
Yeah, orcs should experience the same thing where they still get a good boost from edgies, since it'd put them and humans at 312 axes/swords and maces respectively. That almost completely removed glancing blow damage penalty. While they still can't crit, it's still a good chunk of damage. Also I know with enough weapon skill you can get your soft hit cap to 5%, but not sure if it needs exactly 315. Regardless, it keeps edgies decent.
---
Get HonorSpy addon
---
I got lazy with my AV grind and now it's about 10x slower than it was. I should have just dumped a couple nights into it because it's brutal now.

Arrrrgghh!!!! Ye'll soon be walking tha plank with that kind of talk, ya lily-livered landlubber!
---
Druids is by far the easiest to gear of the 3. Nothing is harder to get gear on than a mage, and priest is by far the hardest healer to gear up.
---
Lootwhore found the thread.
---
well it’s a work computer so i didn’t spend any money on it
---
how much does RFD pickpocket run yield a run?
---
I don't really want Spy visible when in BGs. It just blows up constantly when we reach choke points.
---
is the druid atleast going to do some boomkin shenanigans in pvp or just trolled the guildie for fun?
---
N
---
I think you have a bigger problem with obnoxious bragging
---
Amazing show. Some of the best writing in tv.
---
Do I have to collect anything manually or is it just having the mine under control? How do I send foot soldier raid?
---
Warlock can use eye of org and underworld band, which are just as good or better. 
---
Mage can use eye of org and freezing band.
---
Maiden's is good and all prebis, but not 350g lmao. That's just absurd
---
its really hard to help your decision without knowing if you want to focus on raiding or pvp
---
it does. also works with cleave and should work with hamstring (didnt test that)
---
I disagree. The majority of the Vanilla playerbase joined during the last second year. Most players I know started somewhere after ZG was out, and before Naxx. Most never even got to 60 before TBC.
---
Yeah man I hate thinking about how a bunch of people might be having fun doing a thing I don't think is fun.
---
drop all your quest and get questie.
---
Why trade window?  surely they could just equip it.
---
I don't know why you're so adamantly defending something you know nothing about. The player was toxic and using wetback as a derogatory term, because the person he was flaming was from California. You are literally creating imaginary situations to argue about.
---
it is tyvm =D
---
Elemental is REALLY only viable as a pvp spec - you would need to put in a LOT of effort to not go oom unless your guild is killing bosses in like 45 seconds.  
---
They have a LOT of burst though and great utilityso are great for pvp
---
Well yeah, lol. No, not really, it's far too late and the cat is out of the bag on this one. I guess I should have said I wish they had corrected this before releasing the BGs.
---
Niiice
---
About 7 weeks ago if remember right.
---
Highly comparable or better options, one being a quest reward, and the others being slightly more in price for that amount of gold. Even still, I'd go get the 9 sp ogre circlet or whatever from arena caster ogre and live with slightly less stats over spending that amount of money. What a joke
---
Gehennas? Why are you surprised?
---
And good lord is that a beautiful thing. It's like the sun is out again, the birds are out, the air is crisp and fresh. It's like the server had a rain of shit covering the landscape for weeks, and now the shitstorm is gone.
---
Fucking memes to a single day has never had the desired outcome. The subs gets stale and boring as all fresh content is pushed out and replaced by karma whores resposting the same 10 pictures of &lt;Insert Trending Karma Whoring Horseshit&gt;. 
---
If memes weren't popular they wouldn't get upvoted. The only reason you care is because you spend too much time on reddit and think everyone else sees it the same way you do.
---
When /r/wow did this shit within a month it was all posts of Grizzly Hills. Willing to bet if I went there now it'd be the same thing. I can't wait for a dozen posts of Azshara and Winterspring guys by Hunters who completed their life-long dream of getting Rhok'Delar; so much better.
---
Reddit is dominated by cock gargling power mods and I'm so tired of it.
---
Sunken Temple.
---
Never made it, no idea if it was able to be equipped or not prior to forging.  Either way, that he actually has the stupid thing.
---
I think it’s extremely pathetic
---
Your wife = our wife too right?
---
The only mitigation you get from talents are 20% Stam and 10% armor. The rest of the tree is about threat. If you are off tanking something that doesn't need high threat you just need the gear as full resto and you can do fine.
---
Okay thanks for the reply
---
The problem was allowing more than one ret pally in the raid. We have one in our guild and he's our little baby.
---
“Loot council” &lt;- why I will never raid and just grind BG :)
---
(Don’t have much free time, and zero time for drama)
---
Need to set it up in something like Nvidia Surround to have your 3 monitors act as one.
---
Wow, destiny 2, overwatch, PoE, all do. Probably more but that’s all I play
---
I think the number of HKs is overestimated both ways. In a 10m game i get on avg 10hks, and in the 30m game i avg 100-150 (presumably I'm getting the same people many times though)
---
Not really... You can backdoor into Alli base, cap gy, reset anything you've aggroed (jumpiig on top of aid station roof), then pull Cann without ads and win.
---
Ofc that requires people actually coordinating, which we can't do because we don't have instaqueues so Alli premades are pretty much unbeatable at the rush game (unless you turtle hard).
---
I would second this. If you have great mitigation gear then going fury prot or even impale fury will increase your damage and threat. If you don't need the increased threat because your raid does slow clears and doesn't push the dps then they also are casual enough to allow the MT to be fury prot.
---
Nah it’s a huge competitive advantage in fps to have that FoV.
---
Was that alliance? Did a rogue named Frend get it? Because that's me :)
---
Huh, I haven't noticed this.
---
3 spells? You dont toss ip DoT? Why's this?
---
(Thanks for the write up btw, super informative)
---
I had one, for the first month or so it's fricking awesome.. but eventually I realized I'd be better off with 2 smaller monitors
---
That's why I pay $15/month. Nothing is more fun then spending 12 minutes waiting in queue only to avoid PvPing in a BG so you can spend 5 minutes riding to the other side of a map and another 5 minutes spamming 1-2 abilities against easy NPCs.

This.
---
They know their shit.
---
All your suggestions are in demand except mage.
---
Priest: On alliance be sure to be dwarf for Fear Ward (dwarf only).
---
Pala: Just always in demand (as holy, that is).
---
Druid: Not really in high demand but not a whole lot of people play them.
---
That’s what I meant I’m just big dumb
---
Honest question, how the fuck can you have a all day game when summoning Ice Lord pretty much guarantees a win unless you are extremely bad?
---
nothign wrong with the honour system, the issue isnt an issue anymore, and idk there may be some dead servers that exist? Just dont pick one?
---
Did mention phase 2 and honor grinders in general? No, I mentioned people continuing to gank post battleground hype, because that's what gankers and corpse campers do when they're bored.
---
Cool story
---
Yeah I didn't foresee AV being better honor unfortunately. That means the majority of people playing WSG are either trying to beat AV honor by being in a premade, or have already hit exalted in AV and want to work on WSG.
---
I'll replace it in 4 lvls in
---
As a mage, I love going up against solo warriors
---
A warrior with a paladin/shammy/priest friend on the other hand is someone to run away from really quick.
---
In Spy options, you can choose "Invert the Spy window". Then it will grow vertically instead.
---
You dont actually stealth tho you just get snare/root break which is how it always worked from vanilla till Pandaria when I quit playing.
---
But you are gonna have a bad time in harder tiers with your 16 rets tho...
---
Visit a doctor mate.
---
&gt; True no changes would have been a progression of the game from 1.1 as it existed originally all the way through the final version of the game.
---
Call me crazy, but that sounds like fun, warts and all.
---
I want to go check out walled-in Andorhol again.
---
Its just a nice change of pace sometimes since you get 3.3k xp every time you turn in 3 marks on honor.
---
I love how the ice Poseidon Reddit made the Andy meme and everyone still uses it 
---
Good video too 10/10
---
It's pretty entertaining to read all the comments that seem predicated on the idea that the poster's guild has a surplus of mats and gold.
---
Don't get comfortable, boys and girls, the cost of raiding is about to shoot through the roof over the next several months.
---
did you know there are communities of young boys that fuck peoples moms on xbox live? should we just.. NOT talk about how there are communities of mom-fuckers in video games?
---
You're getting uber-j'baited to the maximum if you get upset over some users in an mmorpg getting their rocks off by typing racist shit into their keyboard.  there's a lot of edge lord neck bears that play this game. they exist. they're out there. they're going to do what they do. which is be pathetic miserable pieces of trash. 
---
so much easy trollbait out there these days, it's pathetic.
---
Allow me to use your faulty logic with regards to all your assumptions. People that make assumptions are stupid. You are stupid. 
---
Harsh language =/ Mad
---
Making assumptions =/ Stupid
---
Get it dip shit?
---
Did your fuck up hurt only you - then w.e
---
Did your fuck up hurt the entire raid - then you probably should have watched a couple strategy videos before joining

If you're not on Grobbulus you're missing out tbh

Exactly, furry is the type of person to populate a role play server, thanks for proving my point
---
Guess people really hate rogues since they're  downvoting this haha. It really does suck.   
---
Generally rogue just feels like a class that is heavily influenced by batching in its current form.
---
Even distract is batched. People hit you while stunned, blinded etc. Kills the reactionary gameplay that makes the class so fun.
---
One up him and give the next one to a boomkin.
---
Red arrow is stratholme if hou look at the warcraft 3 map of lorderon its the same spot
---
Selling a PEndulum of Doom here
---
No you’re the furry, silly
---
Quickclickz is right it's 15 minutes exactly now. I know through more trying than I want to explain. The 2 hour thing went away a long time ago.
---
&gt;just wait until TBC
---
Did I miss an important announcement or are you jebaiting me.
---
What are your favorite warrior weapons? Do you agree with list? What would you change?
---
werent deadwood and winterspring tribes corrupted by legion tho?
---
Cept the AB tabard is better in every way.
---
windows 10 has that function built in but it kinda sucks. doesn't hurt performance much but getting it to start is finnicky and sometimes it just decides its not gonna wok
---
r/hailcorporate
---
Farming Hederine Slayers in Winterspring near the gorge/bridge that drops into the Frostmaul Giants.
---
I get jumped by a Rogue, I pop basically everything trying to survive (it's a bitch of a run bacK), he uses most of his cooldowns to try get me. I cripple my way to the bridge, pop slow fall as I'm falling thinking I'm safe and that the Rogue wouldn't be stupid enough to follow me.
---
I land, and start drinking/eating to recover... A second later a fresh rogue corpse appears right next next to me from the sky and immediately releases + spirit resses.
---
Best place to farm felcloth? I killed the people in felwood south of Jaedenar for over an hour and didn’t get a single one
---
At some point they added a short (.5 or 1 second) invulnerability for this reason.  May have been in tBC tho.
---
Try to kill Satyrs, not the players.
---
This weapon lasts easily into your 30s, enchant it with fiery IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT, ENCHANT IT!!
---
Like respeccing holy for raids
---
What is an SL lock???
---
I definitely can't disagree with that.  I've definitely had a lot of fun bullshitting with these guys and gals over the last few months.  We are still sorting some shit out and recruiting more people, but we have a super solid group of 30 guys right now, and leadership mostly knows what the fuck we are doing.
---
Sounds like a horde problem
---
Well, if it's an 8 minute run that's actually 4 minutes faster than it needs go be. You want 12 minute clears to avoid the lockout. I run it in about 6-7 on my paladin. Takes 4 pulls.
---
The only reason people run Moonglow is because it's mana efficient and hots drops buffs off of tanks. 
---
If it's a quick fight and buff aren't a problem you should all be swiftmend.
---
never thought of people not defending the summoner, lol, that would make it last forever, yeah, haha.
---
An I've never even seen the tree. I haven't lost a singe game that lasted over 30 mins. Alliance seem to not care about that, don't know if u guys have equivalent to our flightmasters but neither have seen them.
---
Ice Lord stays 10 min in the middle, so there is a chance to
---
Lol which is why the game is over for me once I reach end game. 
---
Raiding is basically a different game that I’m not interested in playing.
---
I mean I understand what you´re trying to say. But what is so painful about to zoom a picture on a phone? It takes less than one second and can be done with one hand.
---
And the rest of the picture isnt just useless white space. Two guys asked about addons in this thread and can therefore expand there UI. For them it wasnt just useless white space.
---
Last time I tried with LoL it had some major problems.  Overwatch gives you a lower fov when playing in ultrawide, they intentionally made it worse and even then it's only up to 21:9. I don't play PoE but Destiny 2 is one of the only other games that actually work flawlessly.
---
I don't know if it's the 'best' but the Satyr's in Azshara drop it, they're low level and it's usually pretty quiet.
---
Personally I farm the Hederine Slayers in Winterspring, they're much tougher but they seem to drop it relatively commonly and even have a chance at the Eye of Shadow.
---
I solo warrior in a bg is like half a character.
---
And how does that shed any light on my question?
---
its sooo good. I grabbed Beserker buff in WSG yesterday and unleashed this in a big mid team fight. soooo many numbers
---
Yes, they are diminishing.  
---
Also IIRC all Seal effects have Procs-per-minute limitation, so you can't make SoJ stun more often with fast weapon.
---
This is correct. And it's still not nearly as wide as this monitor, so OP would have zoomed in fov *and* black bars.
---
this aint vanilla bruh its classic
---
This is more of a problem that comes from how blizzard created classic wow rather than vanish specifically. Fixing it would require fixing spell batching.
---
Mage + hunter isnt an option because those are your mains
---
Warrior/druid tank + druid/priest/pally healer would be ideal for forming dungeon groups
---
You're right that orc's have something similar going on but it's importantly different for orcs because Deathbringer is a stronger item than Vis'Kag in a vacuum. DB would always be bis for horde with VK being worse because of windfury. This applies to all races on horde.
---
Also flurry axe is the bis offhand for orcs and it is just BARELY worse than Brutality Blade or Core Hound Tooth for non-orc horde warriors since all serious horde warriors are orc or have edgemaster's. Deathbringer and Vis'Kag are actually the 4th and 5th best offhands respectively behind all of the options above.  
---
Why is flurry axe so good? Because the proc generates another mainhand hit which generates more rage so despite being lower dps with no additional stats the rage generation from flurry axe is excellent. In fact Deathbringer mainhand with flurry axe offhand is still better than Doom's edge offhand from BWL.
---
Soul link. It’s a talent spec that makes them tanky as hell
---
Idk if I had to pick what’s more pathetic that or spending endless hours farming mats and items in raids so that you can... farm mats and items in the next raid, and min max everything according to guides online where smarter more prepared people “solved” it for you, I think that’s worse.
---
its crazy how almost everyone from herod, faerlina and whiteman is a bitter misanthrope edgelord that thinks they are unique and hilarious. i can't imagine playing there
---
Not sure but I hope not, I like cosmetics.
---
*Furiously presses my 1 button harder* HOW DO I INCREASE MY SKILL ON THIS!?
---
Herod and Whitemane too
---
Funny how attached you can get to them eh?
---
Thats pretty much what I did back in the day, 2 pets in the stables for "group" activities, and then *my* pet, which was a white crocolisk called Stumpy.
---
The actual honor number doesn't matter at all. It's how you rank among your faction.
---
Freezing band is worth over 700g on my server.
---
So is your reasoning for 350g for Maiden's being absurd because you can use a 700+g ring instead?
---
I grind dungeons all day as a tank and I don’t have anywhere close to 2k gold? Soo either you are lying or you are doing other things for gold income.
---
I’m a paladin so I usually use /cast divine shield followed by a /cast hearthstone
---
In arena you would just wait for polymorph to end while RMP is killing your friends. Battlegrounds, especially AV, are the best PvP scenario there is for warriors.
---
Cc them kill the vw
---
The potion I mentioned removes 1 magic effect every 5 seconds for 30 seconds. That’s probably the best thing out there as far as I know. It works well against mages because you can use it just before getting sheeped and it’ll remove the first sheep almost immediately and then remove any re-sheeps too.
---
If you go through the portal no one else can use it anymore, curiously.
---
How long is it repeatable?
---
If spamming the same button every GCD for the entire raid night sounds fun to you, it sounds like you should've rolled a mage or warlock.
---
Well why does it matter if he already has hand of rag, the one without can just farm it after solo. Should have just let them roll for it.
---
As a mage, I AP+PoM pyro and hope it insta kills them or I lose.
---
if alliance is that far into horde base then recalling is just gonna lead to you dying instantly. I only recall late game if my AoE trinkets are up so I can pop eranikus n the middle of a crowd then throw an un'goro fire charge at my feet. I'm dead a half second later but its worth it to delay.
---
The only thing it would be replaced by in "4 levels" is a boe blue.
---
Like freezing band isnt twice as expensive lol!
---
Sounds like something out of EVE or the original Star Wars Online, where someone just straight up wants a player dead.
---
I killed the water elemental in winterspring today.
