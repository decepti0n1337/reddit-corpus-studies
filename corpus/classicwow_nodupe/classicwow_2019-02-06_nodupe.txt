Oh, that makes sense! Thanks for the clarification!
---
---
---
Demo shout, thunderclap and tab target sundering would be the main way.  You can get shield spikes/blessing of sanctuary that return damage on block. Druid thorns and paladin ret aura do thorns damage. Engineering has aoe grenades to help with threat. 
---

---
Later on thunderfury is a huge help. Force reactive disk can do a lot of aoe damage. 
---
Most other items that add thorns damage are too low to really make much of a difference. 
---
Really odd blizz never gave that one guy loot. Wonder if they will fix it and give him a chance to drop a green
---
Are you telling me the sound from the flute is even a fraction as annoying as 40 characters going CHOOO CHOOO every 3 seconds forever until the fucking thing despawns?
---
Been on vacation so sorry for the slow response.
---
Things like using your skills - I know this seems simple, but I had a hunter watch a healer die after the tank died and just do nothing, yelling at the mage to snare the mobs - No wingclip etc. No pet off tanking mobs, etc.
---
Later on being able to chain trap - not hard, but needed.
---
Not breaking cc with multi-shot, but using it, so good positioning.
---
Kiting mobs as needed. Maybe the healer is tanking a mob, maybe the tank is getting wrecked. Sometimes tanking a caster saves the pull, etc.
---
Not needing on everything. I had a hunter need a str ring because he "didnt have one". Sure its OK, but it's not really a good ring, compared to giving it to a melee dps or the tank. He basically need rolled everything that dropped.
---
Leaving pack on. Not dismissing pets. Pet management in general - when to just leave it passive, etc. Pulling it back when needed.
---
Hunter in classic is really more of a support class, not a pure dps. Most people won't do any of the support roles and would be much better off being a mage.
---
I think something that almost everyone has missed is that we do not know anything yet about the release of content on a time-line.  Regardless of this fact AQ will "hopefully" be locked behind a community driven event that gates progress to a degree.
---
AQ is scheduled to be in the THIRD stage of content release, and I would guess you would be back in the game long before Naxx is even released.  Heck we may not even have the AQ patch.
---
You are never behind in vanilla, even naxx guilds run ZG and Ony just for the buffs.  There will always be a ladder of guild progression on each faction of every realm.
---
I have played on private realms that are "fresh" and ancient, and there is no such thing as behind.  ALmost every player has an alt or 5 that they want to progress, realms dont get old they get more "experienced"
---
Warlocks do have a lot but a lot of it can be delayed until your income is higher. They're also very efficient farming and leveling so you generally do okay during the hobo phase. 
---
Engineering helps, so serious tanks in raiding guilds go eng/BS, but good luck having any gold ever.  Sapper charges for a good burst and that one shield that procs an explosion but takes durability hit every time are the only thing you can do to effectively hold lots of mobs.
---
boomer is not just an age, it's a state of mind.
---
That’s correct. There are many things not quite the same. 
---
For a druid healing 5mans, most of the drawbacks are negated by a DPS with a rez. Find and befriend a shadow priest.
---
It’s definitely OP in PvP. One of the best trinkets in the whole game
---
I slept through this dudes baby rage, damn. Pretty obvious he tried to stream once failed now hates all streamers, likely the same way he hates all women because they won’t text him back. 
---
Visually yeah, sounds can be turned off, and there's the wind-up wrecker as well :p  
---
    
---
This is what MC ended up being after BWL was on clear. An easy and fun way to gear alts and new recruits.
---
If you are on a PvP server Searing Pain can be really good.
---
NS roots isn’t something you would get a lot of use out of. NS is really meant for max rank regrowth and HT’s. It would be a more efficient use of mana to NS HT yourself and then just slap on the autoroot and hope it doesn’t get resisted.
---
That being said, I’ve NS rooted someone before in a few funny situations, like when you need to prevent them from catching your flag carrier in WSG or freezing people in Midair in AB or preventing their escape in world PvP. Oh you thought you could just run by? Surprise root and let me introduce you to my warrior friend.
---
Just get Thunderfury LOOOOOOOOL
---
MX Master 4lyf
---
The trick is not to rely on aoe tanking when 95% of pulls are 3-5 mobs. Revenge/Sunder and fast tab targetting and prioritisation. Have taunt/mocking blow/shout/shield wall/last stand bound and ready to go. Demo shout is for reducing incoming damage and getting the very initial aggro- it is not a good threat building skill. Thunderclap is similar and only hits 5 targets, and breaks CC. 
---
From what I remember, paladin ret aura generates threat on the paladin. Thorns is good though.
---
This was always going to be this way. From a PR perspective you gate your announcements. The main game had a new raid incoming after Blizzcon. You dont spend time and money promoting classic thats 8 months away when BFA has a new patch pending dude.
---
These last few months have been all about the new patch, the new raid/content, and the World First race for the raid that Blizz just congratulated the winner on. Thats proper PR....
---
When this content begins to become dated, we will get a dev blog update on classic. But not until then. You have to space out and temper your delivery.
---
And now I have a new wallper. :) Man, that truly feels like home. So many hours spent dueling at Org gates.
---
I loved the old broken vanilla trinks. I also loved the old secret quests
---
You know your guild will have like 4 thunderfuries by the time you're in aq lol.
---
Would you rather have a trinket that stuns an enemy or a trinket that removes stuns from yourself.  Hmm.emoji
---
as if that rule would do anything, *creates random username* "hey guys found this youtube video by the way
---
I really like Esfand.  I don’t know anything about Method.  Is this a good culture fit?
---
All these YouTube comments talking about abusing it on stronger players while watching a WF race with none getting banned
---
"We have found a lost item of yours Twisting in the Nether"
---
Thanks blizzard..  😑
---
I read somewhere that using battle shout to buff your party generates aoe threat. So it’s always better to use it after pulling instead of before. 
---
Yeah lol, I just hope they retain a lot of this stuff for Classic and don't try to homogenise everything.
---
 
---
Well, that's going to be stuck in my head for a week. 
---
My experience as a warrior was being jealous of druid AoE threat. Bears are better at tanking groups of mobs and that's often what is most important in 5mans. Especially helpful for farm runs. 
---
Most guilds didn't get to AQ. 
---
I am currently playing on a private server, making friends, exploring and leveling all over again. It's actually making me more excited for the blizzard release, so much so I am toying with the idea of reupping my subscription and maybe playing a bit of bfa. I understand the feeling though that private servers aren't the REAL experience, even if I can't quite figure out why I feel that way. Even still, there is a lingering sensation that what I am playing is false in some way, spawns for ore and mobs are just a bit off, it feels a bit unnatural. That being said, go ahead and roll on a private for a few levels, you don't need to feel pressured to rush or start raiding, play it casually a bit, and if feel it's draining, go right back to league.
---
Alrighty rolling dps smite priest. Private servers are bullshit I can play whatever I want.
---
&gt; It's been over 2 months and not a word out of them. If there is no word by March and a Beta test schedule then we should all be worried.
---
As someone who has been following Blizzard development since they began; this is absolutely hilarious.
---
Theres clearly an entire new generation of gamers that don't really know about how Blizzard typically operates in regards to "announcements and updates". The development of WoW or even WC3 would have driven you guys absolutely crazy.
---
Battle shout.  This is your bread and butter for AoE threat.  Don't bother with demo or thunderclap.  See here for math and a more in depth guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/2zoe1p/vanilla_tanking_assistance/cplcejo/?st=jrshbpyk&amp;sh=ffafbcd7
---
Method is a huge organization now so he will surely find his place, we don't know what he'll be doing; if it's raiding or just being a Method partner.
---
&gt; This is how blizzard operates. Always has.
---
It is, but as I posted below, I think this might be news to the newer generation of gamers. Old school PC gamers are familiar with how quiet blizzard is about development, but many younger gamers may not be.
---
&gt; its huge that classic wow content creators are getting attention from the big gaming orgs.
---
Huge in what way? How will "big gaming orgs" be a good thing for the vanilla feeling?
---
It means classic wow will be mainstream
---
Now do some Sims based on what a good deadmines drop would do to your overall leveling speed for the next few levels, then compare that to % drop rates, and rerun to see if poopsocking a 5 man with guildies to speed run it is still a net loss
---
&gt; Huge in what way? How will "big gaming orgs" be a good thing for the vanilla feeling?
---
It would honestly be accurate. Its not like huge orgs like SomethingAwful/Goonsquad weren't making massive guilds in classic and doing all manner of madness back then.
---
Nothing new here. Except I expect Method wont be NEARLY as trolltastic as the old SA/Goonsquad guilds were in the classic/tbc era.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZmKm1XvxB4
---
There is already a post about this from earlier today
---
&gt; Honestly, I don't even think you're concerned about griefing. You played Vanilla so you know it was extremely uncommon and that automated-bans are unnecessary.
---
It's obvious by now that you are changing your story constantly. Before you were saying that summoning people off cliffs and ninja looting was good for the game because it caused "chaos" or something, now you're saying it hardly ever happened anyway. But if it hardly ever happened, how can it be so good for the game?
---
&gt; I feel like you do not want this game to be good fun for us. I always get that feeling from your posts.
---
Who is "us"? Ninja looting, newbie-griefing, trade chat spamming racists? If so then I'll wear that badge with pride. I do *not* want the game to be fun for "us" if that is "us". I want those people out of the game with extreme prejudice, or whipped into shape with muting and banning so they learn to behave.
---
Because the other "us", the people who think they spoil the game for others, will have lots more fun without them. I want the game to be good fun for those people.
---
The fact is we do have a subset of the population here who dream about Classic being a free-for-all for scamming, ninja looting, griefing, racism, sexism and general channer dickery. To them that was the best part of vanilla and they want that back. They obviously are not getting what they want, Blizzard has made that clear, but it's what they want. And I am very happy to dance on the grave of their dreams of being dicks.
---
There may well be a real problem with an abusable reporting system. If it does turn out that any five jerks can kick anyone off the server with fake reports, and Blizzard doesn't police that abuse efficiently, that is going to be a real problem. There were certainly people who abused things like snowballs and the AFK reporting system in the past to grief other players. I think it is a solvable problem though, you just make a big deal about banning or suspending people who do that.
---
Devilsaur mafia
---
You can use both. The stun is on a 15 min CD, with a 30 second CD from being equipped. It's possible to use it then swap to a different trinket before the next fight and before it's off CD. You're not constantly stuck in combat in BGs/world pvp. 
---
You earn the title of Archmage when you can destroy anyone who questions your fashion sense.
---
Publicity, Classic needs players. People who are following their esports teams in other games than wow might be encouraged to try out classic when it releases. 
---
The most effective thing was having group mates that understand classic mechanics and don't sperg out and start dpsing too early.
---
Theres no real way to turn classic into Wrath levels of AoE threat. Its all on your dps to play smart really. Do your part by using TC and Battleshout as well as Engineering if you have it and a shield spike if you prefer; but after that AoE threat is a shared responsibility.
---
Name is Malown, wears purple and gold, is black, drops Malowns Slam... what have it away
---
He signed with method? As if this is some professional football team. 
---
Was it the kicking and screaming or the numbers that were another $15 a month each? Most likely the potential cash was what spoke. Retail has people kicking and screaming over many of the systems and Blizzard isn't budging.
---
besides your comment beeing retarded. Insignia doesnt removes stun for everyone in classic, also having multiple trinkets with long cooldowns and swapping them out all the time is a staple in vanilla.
---
Take the trinket if you're even remotely interested in PvP. 
---
For you and everyone else: you can go to the Inked playmats site and submit any artwork to be made into a custom playmat which is basically what this is. The actual art for this comes from a deviant art user and is linked elsewhere in the comments here. So you could find a cool alliance art and do the same!
---
I don’t know about you guys but I’m excited to walk around the capital cities with that full Twill set again. 
---
LOOKIN FRESH
---
Nah but divine shield is. Although problem is the divine shield would be cast to remove sheep just before Pyro cast was completed most likely, so counterspell wouldn't do anything anyway, correct me if I'm wrong. 
---
Oh true 
---
They do now... everyone is pro af at vanilla because we been playing it for like 10 years
---
And so many more yet to be spent!
---
Warlock Hunter or mage are the best solo farming classes so yeah either of them are a good choice
---
Thanks. Is this for sure the original artist? I've seen this image elsewhere
---
Alright, enough - we get it, people still own CD's and manuals of WoW.  Don't need to see a new attic find every day.
---
What makes you think they didn't exist in Vanilla?
---
There are a lot of sad nerds out there who cheer enough to make them seem like a professional football team.  
---
If you're interested, I've built a "repack" which is an offline server you can run solo or with friends. You can find it at stygianthebest.github.io.
---
looking pristine
---
Revenge is a vanilla ability?
---
good for him
---
I honestly don't know, I hope it is. 
---
What more do you need to know? That watercooler and the panel has basically explained all their techniques in a high level manner.  They're not going to give any lower level of info as it will just confuse the majority of people.
---
Yeah - it's going to be interesting going through it again. I was a bumbling nub of a warrior back in Vanilla. 
---
Do you really think people who like e-sports will like Vanilla?
---
I mean, as a streamer, his only options for WoW when classic releases is Classic and BFA. I'm sure Esfand would still rather play a butchered Classic than BFA.
---
They were also pretty good at tracing gold back from the person who traded it and seeing what each person who touched it is doing.  
---
I think they used the AH a lot in an attempt to "wash" the money but it was still traceable.  
---
Some might, even it is only 5% that is still new players trying out classic wow
---
I didn't come across one... I was looking up WoW based playmats, mostly what I found was the Warcraft TCG themed ones, then this one randomly.
---
Lok'tar, friend
---
Of course you like it, Zugmeister
---
Sign? He accepted a guild invite? 
---
Yes, bombs are awesome for pulls, here are 2 shields and a nice chest for AoE tanking: https://i.imgur.com/wZPifYW.png
---
Dope
---
Not worth the risk, in my opinion. I'll be playing Classic to enjoy the game, not to advance some social agenda. If somebody is linking The Nicker axe, I simply don't care about that enough to pay for its elimination with the consequences to the game of handing everybody the ability to cause other people to disconnect at crucial times.
---
Yes
---
Multiple people can ring the gong on the same server
---
Activision mismanages everything they get their hands on. Ultimately what happens when the person pulling all the strings is only interested in cash and not making great video games.
---
How would you typically farm gold? From mining/bs? I’m leaning towards those professions and It seems like they make good money once they have some recipes... is it still a good money maker early on? 
---
yep
---
Thanks for the response! I guess I’m hoping to be somewhere below server firsts but above drunk raiding lol. A guild that wants to progress and takes it seriously, but also understands at the end of the day it’s just a game. So it sounds like I won’t have to spend every second of every day farming. Whew. 
---
Did you go Armor smith or weapon smith for blacksmithing? Is one better than the other in certain scenarios?
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Thanks for the response! How did/could you make 40-60g an hour as a warrior regardless of spec?
---
&gt;ToS is a legally binding agreement.
---
Well... yes, **but**. A contract being legally binding does not mean that all terms of the contract are legally enforceable. Basically this means that if you break the ToS and get banned from the game, you do not have legal ground to sue Blizzard — but on the other hand, Blizzard also has little legal ground to sue you over breaching the contract. Basically the only thing that can come out of breaching the EULA/ToS is the termination of the contract and losing access to the service.
---
Now, there are cases where EULA breaches go to court, but these tend to be lawsuits involving two companies. This is because there's more motivation to sue another company (because suing individuals will generally not do you much good), and possibly because when companies do breach EULAs, they tend to do so in ways that are more enforceable than the EULA breaches individuals commit.
---
&gt;And yes, they can compel you to shut down a private server if they discovered one. Remember Nost?
---
Remember Molten-WoW (nowadays known as Warmane)? The pay2win server making thousands if not tens of thousands a month in revenue that's been operating for like ten years with over 10k players? Yeah, that one. It still exists.
---
He'll definitely be their top DPS. Totally. Definitely. Didn't make it into the guild because he posts. Definitely because he's a top DPS.
---
Remember M\*ltenWoW (nowadays known as W\*rmane)? The pay2win server making thousands if not tens of thousands a month in revenue that's been operating for like ten years with over 10k players? Yeah, that one. It still exists.
---
(also turns out the automod removes your posts these days if you mention private servers by name, holy lmao)
---
That's the cool part, there is no risk for the reasons explained in my post. 
---
Of course it's TBC. Same philosophy as in WoW with Frankenstein-ing your gear, though. Of course, TBC and it's space vibe with all the crystals and colors makes your mismatched gear pop out more like in this picture, but let's not forget how silly gear could look in Classic with trangles for shoulder pads, a pink dress, a handkerchief for a cloak, and 'boots' that are just ankle weights
---
It's not as wonky as in TBC but you still have your pink dress with your green paper airplane shoulder pads and your yellow handkerchief for a cape, with ankle weights for boots that don't cover your soles or toes
---
If they don't sell Classic in physical form with 8 installation discs i'm going to be slightly disappointed.
---
The leveling armor was mostly bland, weapons they did a good job on, and tiers after the rework. But before the rework, T1 and T2 looked just as bland as anything else. But then T2 ended up being perhaps the most iconic class look for much of WoW's early (even current) history - see Judgement set
---
And the flips
---
I tried your comp.(pally and priest) It's a great group in theory, but horrible...horrible with 5 mans. You would be much better suited with 3 dps, 1 healer and 1 tank.
---
The "disable helmet" option from the interface menu will probably be enabled for me all throughout my experience. A tabard will be a must. 
---
I remember it being 35s. May have been for a 5-stack but I think that was per elixir
---
Ur acting like it’s a new game. It’s like 15 years old and they told you when its ‘coming out’ relax. 
---
Blizzard has ups and downs. WoD was bad, Legion was arguably the best expansion WoW has had. Basically, I feel like they are due a win soon again. 
---
It'll help him heal better he'll have more mana
---
As a tank your best bet is probably DM east jump runs.
---
This was definitely like a tbc release shot before he could get more pieces that fit together.  This dude would have been the best tank week 1 tbc.
---
Replying only to disagree with Legion being the best. It pales compared to WotLK. 
---
TC is shit threat, but I believe demo will do more threat than battle if there are tons of mobs. Battle gets split while demo applies a flat value to each mob.
---
Most humans
---
Ftfy
---
I think TBC is pretty well respected around here overall
---
I took my vanilla main to Outland, did a few quests, replaced my gear with some greens, then stopped playing him because I wanted to sort of keep him preserved as my vanilla main.
---
I had already rerolled another main for TBC because I wanted to play warlock instead of rogue, so it's not like I completely gave up a 60 level head start for just that reason
---
Of course, and [Pitchfork]
---
It all looked wonkier in TBC and more obviously mismatched, but we had a lot of mismatching in vanilla with people putting on anything they could find (especially since people downgraded armor classes often due to poor itemization)
---
With a [Pitchfork] in hand
---
So you're telling me...milions of people will spend currency getting a secondary account, getting organized enough to grief a few random players before they ultimately get banned. In a game they're not even playing!?
---
Man I thought I was paranoid. 
---
I've done the math for paladin (since all these maths I'm doing are for myself, and just sharing cause people have asked)
---
And given the XP per hour from the deadmines, and following up, the stockade... there's 1 upgrade for paladins from either - the pants quest reward that end up being about a 1 dps upgrade.
---
And for paladins in the 20-30 range (deadmines, stocks, for the next few levels) that 1 dps from the pants means 1 in 5 mobs will die in 4 hits rather than 5. So like 3.6 seconds saved every 4 minutes, or normalized at a 0% increase.
---
I'm just churning out the data for anyone to do the math for themselves.
---
I'll hopefully have a crew before launch and we can do a little more deep dive look into the viability of dungeons, but so far my data says skip everything pre-and-post 34 for a hypothetical poopsock group.
---
This must come as amazing news for Blizzard, they're sittning on a potential gold mine. Getting 6 subs out of every Classic player is frankly nothing but amazing.
---
They're gonna be swimming in millions of banned accounts though but this can't be helped. 
---
I'm looking at doing alliance - likely Night Elf.
---
When I played in Vanilla, I remember doing: Teldrassil, Darkshore, some of Ashenvale, and then ended up making the long trek to meet friends who were playing human in Redridge. I want to say I hit up Wetlands at some point, then made my way to Duskwood. Then vague memories of Hillsbrad and Arathi Highlands. Then STV - which I have very fond memories of (PvP server). After that, it's all a blur. I definitely remember spending a lot of time in Tanaris, but I can't put my finger on where else I spent a lot of time on the way to 60.
---
I'd love to hear any suggestions you can come up with! I definitely plan to write down a mini-guide on the general flow of where I should try to make sure to hit on the leveling process.
---
Doesn't seem too different from any other game in development to be honest. 
---
Disable cloak from me from day 1 as a part of initial setup
---
I guess we've had different experiences.  I only ever played an Spriest in vanilla and there was no single class that I avoided in PVP because they were difficult to beat. I had more success against certain classes for sure but never had any real issue against Hunters.  
---
Just the fact that your engagement style is preset "I immediately scatter shot, viper shot, conc shot and run out of range for a few seconds. Then 1 more viper sting and they have 0 mana left." makes you predictable.  Might work against an unskilled player but isn't going to work against even a modestly skilled Spriest.
---
But again, different vanilla experiences I suppose.
---
Hot damn.
---
I had a few rare recipes and was a swordsmith which was uncommon. I also played alot with the auction house to make my money. Farming rich thorium usually also netted between 25-50g an hour depending on arcanite crystals. As someone else said DM runs could be fine, but you needed a partner/healer. I probably made 200g-300g a week from smithing, but several of the patterns I had cost 1000g upfront to begin with so sorta takes money to make money type deal on that. Early on tips were pretty good, on the 3-5g per craft sort of deal but as a server matures that slows down as people don't need as much. I also eventually leveled a mage alt with herb/alch to do my arcanite transmutes etc. 
---
/roll 100-100
---
Competing in vanilla requires much more dedication than retail. If you're running four split raids like Method will most likely be doing in order to snag all the world firsts that's going to require a lot of hours, no guild will be able to match that amount of strength and raw power. 
---
&gt; \*Pre-Raid BiS wasn't really a thing in Vanilla, thats really a pserver thing. 
---
This is an excellent point, however most prot warriors were measured by their health. Not the best way to measure as you can stack stamina at the expense of all else and get pretty high but I think stamina was a how you were measured until you got mostly into raid tier gear.
---
Every class has their own version of the basic PvP Trinket and only a few of them remove stuns. Regardless, you have 2 Trinket slots and most people consider Tidal Charm + PvP Trinket to be one of the best - if not the very best - combo.
---
Yes, that’s exactly what they are. They’re easier than BWL, and I know that AQ20 doesn’t require attunement, maybe ZG also. They are more puggable and make gear is more attainable, making it easier for a player who, say, misses the initial wave of MC being current content to be able to spend much less time there.
---
Honestly you’ll be fine. I started on a classic server a month ago that already had Naxx released a month or two before that. I’m at 60 already and there are so. many. runs. Of non-“current” content. IE Naxx. The most hardcore guilds are doing that, sure, but the most run raid is still UBRS. There’s a constant supply of fresh or less-geared 60s who need to run preraid-BiS dungeons, attunement quests, MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20 and Ony - as there will be pugs and guilds doing this content actively until the end of Vanilla, you really needn’t worry about missing the initial rush. I missed the WHOLE rush on my server, but it doesn’t even feel like it.
---
Most people didn't record stuff like that back then. YouTube only launched that year and it wasn't at the level with content creators like you have now. 
---
Loot was buggy and if something bugged blizzard often wouldn't help.
---
I feel like for warrior, imo it’s very fun to level up. I enjoy the challenge, and it’s very engaging. For leveling you must be hamstring kiting, which makes leveling easier and more active. And warriors have those shiny weapon drops throughout leveling like the whirlwind axe, the Rockpounder of stoneslayer, dreadforge retaliator, etc. 
---
I think Hunter does have a lot of group utility actually. They have traps, auras, in raids they tranq shot, and they can kite. They are great levelers, and when hunters get BWL gear with Ashjrethul the crossbow, you start annihilating people in pvp.  
---
I had a lot of trouble picking a class ( which I helped resolve by playing pservers), and I narrowed down what I want to do in classic, what I like playstyle wise, and the lore/fantasy and cool gear you could wear as that class. Once I settled with my main-warrior- I try not to watch any vanilla content pertaining to the other classes because then I will think hey that class might sound like a good idea. I only watch warrior content pretty much, and I have seen a lot of vanilla class guide content prior to deciding to main warrior. I dunno hope this helps in some way
---
&gt; Did you go Armor smith or weapon smith for blacksmithing? Is one better than the other in certain scenarios? 
---
Armorsmithing offers more for a tank. The dark iron chest is BOP for armorsmiths and has a good chunk of FR. Armorsmiths will also be given lionheart helm plans if they drop which is a great money maker. Most of the desirable weapons are BOE, like nightfall. There isn't anything that a weaponsmith can make that can't be beaten by a raid item, so if you're already raiding, the armorsmithing is going to be of more use to you. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm also very excited to make a balance druid! From what I've seen, I'd take the suggestions on NS or the bear charge spec. And by seen, I specifically mean all the pvp videos I've watched. 
---
Find a guild you can trust and it was never a issue. 
---
I am sure you did fine against most hunters, hunters had a bad reputation for young kids and newbies playing it. 90% of hunters did not even use Viper Sting in vanilla retail, it was always serpent sting. 
---
Also, it doesn't matter if im predictable. Scatter shot opener is unavoidable, and sets up my viper and kiting. Conc shot gives me enough time to apply a second viper. I was in a guild with Spriests with Tier 3 and everything min-maxed, it was never a challenge to beat them, just being honest. Rogues/warlocks had the best chance against me in a duel. 
---
Im with you on the sharding. Ill only see it acceptable at launch for the first month in 1-6 lvl zone.  
---
Charge, TC, Swap to Def, Main Target Sunder, demo shout, tab sunder, tab sunder, tab sunder, main target shield slam, tab sunder, tab sunder. You're going to wear out your tab button.
---
&gt; but kicking and screaming hasn't worked in the past so
---
It absolutely has.  It saved us from REAL ID in 2010.

Not to mention that he released this video hours after Alexensual released his on this right click to report topic. Tips used the same points and argument as Alex, tips used the same reddit thread source and clips as Alex, tips even used the same panoramic camera shots of vanilla WoW zones in the background. 
---
My memories are from vanilla, and may not reflect what happens on private servers.
---
Cleave and Thunder Clap were the only things that would hold multiple mobs (that I remember--it has been awhile).  Cleave hits the primary target and one other nearby mob.  Thunder Clap hits four nearby mobs (maybe the main target is one of them, maybe not).
---
If you had one mob, aggro was easy.  A second mob could be held fairly well with cleave and thunder clap.  A third and fourth might be held by the thunder clap part of 'cleave and thunder clap', but it was tenuous.  It helps to reduce the damage you're taking so the healer generates less threat.  If the four mobs deal too much damage, you can't hold them.  If you had more than four mobs, one of them is running to the healer.
---
It was useless trying to put sunders on multiple targets.  The sole purpose in life for every DPS was to pull the skull off the tank and wipe the party.  They wouldn't give you the opportunity to change your target like that.
---
What we had to go by was the description in the tooltips that read "this ability generates additional threat" or "this ability generates a high amount of threat".  These were vague and not all that helpful.  So you had to try out all the abilities that did damage or said something vague about "more threat" and go by feel (no threat meters).
---
Also, until you hit level 60 the levels of your party members and of the mobs will vary a lot and nothing will work consistently.
---
Theres not much out there. Primarily caused by low bandwidth. Let's plays became popular when it became easy to both record large amounts of video (while still being able to play as well) and upload them, which only barely started becoming a thing in 2008-2009.
---
How often do you think a hunter needs to do stuff like use Frost Trap and such? I admittedly having been dabbling on a pserver and found hunters in dungeons to be rather dull outside of micromanaging my pet lol.
---
I tried capturing some gameplay back in the early days, but my pc couldn't really handle it.  Fraps was really the only video recorder at the time (or all I knew about) and it would just absolutely kill your already pretty bad fps if you didn't have a super beefy machine.
---
Look mate, every class is boring to play in vanilla raids. Don't pick a class for their PvE rotation.
---
You have 2 hours a night? Max? You should pick a class that can be geared easily, leveled quickly, and has some capacity for making more then 30g an hour solo. Druid, Hunter, priest.
---
wat, i mean the game was pretty good and reporting was ass thats kinda the point. ease of access if too extreme usually means neutering of how someone can speak. Lets say i was a thin skinned little baby and your big mean words hurt me feelings. I click report, then the automated report goes off, and you have no way of justifying it because technically you where "mean". Is that abuse or not, it makes quite the grey line which leads to more petty stuff
---
If they only made it cosmetic and didn't add things that made money or produced tradeskill items, I think it would have been cool. Not somewhere that would replace going to a major city. The only non-social thing I can think of is that guilds would probably meet at the guildmaster's house before a raid maybe, but that's about it.
---
I thought that back in vanilla retail. When Destiny 1 came out and they had shaders I about shit myself.
---
What removes stun?
---
Because of the ML bug where it wouldn't let you send loot to players sometimes.

Some people just like being dicks y'know?

Perfect, that is the Classic exprience, no more hiding behind sharding, CRZ or flying mounts.
---
Agree to disagree. The TotC period was one of the worse ones in patches. The spirit of the tournament was pretty nice, but the way this raid superseded Ulduar was not done well. WOTLK was good in finally adding ways to close in the gear gaps for new players/alts and generally is my second favorite expansions as well, but I'd say it's on par with Legion at best. 
---
You gave an anecdote about streamers failing to abuse it. Meanwhile [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/an8jpd/the_rightclick_report_feature_as_it_stands_could/efrljc8/) are a bunch of anecdotes about it being successfully abused.
---
Your "no risk" claim is not very convincing.
---
Besides, you seem to be missing the point anyway. A report doesn't have to result in a total ban for it to be a problem. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skWzi3o4oGI) showing it being deliberately tested. It knocks you offline and mutes you for three hours, and apparently the duration doubles every time it's applied to you, with no upper limit. Here's an [official Blizzard notice](https://i.imgur.com/QeBLgPO.jpg) explaining the things you can't do. No mail, no generate chat, no party invites, etc.
---
This is incredibly abusable.
---
&gt; YouTube only launched that year and it wasn't at the level with content creators like you have now.
---
[THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCF3ywukQYA) was the ultimate and peak pinnacle of YouTube content creation during OG Vanilla. Aside from terrible PVP videos and some machinima, vanilla content didn't exit much.
---
* I didn't farm for consumables - ever.  We were never required to have them.  Most people didn't use them because most people didn't know to use them.  We were highly encouraged to bring fire protection pots when were were trying to down rag, but that was about it.  I think people might have started using them by naxx, but I had quit and come back in a different guild at the point so I was running MC and BWL again.  And we didn't need consumables for that.
---
* I think we raided two nights a week for maybe three hours.  We would have a third raid if we were close downing a boss.  A lot of times we would have a raid night to bring alts.  So I guess it could be up to 4 nights, but you definitely weren't required to be at all of them.  Once things were on farm we could usually clear a raid in one night.
---
* Pre raid BiS wasn't really a thing in vanilla.  You just showed up with whatever you had.  Also, everyone had their own play style and had a different definition of what was best for them.  You also couldn't just google "Best in slot for x class" because those lists didn't exist.  The way we upgraded gear was by looking over your character and thinking "hmm, my bracers need an upgrade."  So you go browse Thottbot for bracers and then start killing which ever boss you decided dropped the best bracer upgrade for you.
---
IMO you don't need the best gear to clear raids in classic.  You just need people that won't blow up the raid when they are the bomb.
---
I believe they came out saying ToTC era was a filler using stuff developed for the area beneath Dalaran that wouldn’t work out but they needed a content gap filler and wanted to use the stuff still. 
---
I will say Legion had a  good story that wrapped up the disaster WoD was and what I think everybody wanted in a final battle against the legion.  What killed Legion for me, really WoW in general was sharding/Dungeon finder and how the community was ruined by it. Even ghostcrawler came out saying he regretted doing DF. 
---
As usual - it depends. Frost trap is super useful on any fight with adds you get to do kiting and tranq shot too! Auto-shot clipping is also fairly engaging. 
---
If you are concerned about playtime, hunters have the added benefit of being a tier 1 leveler, being relatively easy to gear and having some of the best gold farming options.
---
Dumb leftist whine
---
"Lol fuck off, deal with it" - literally everyone including the GM.
---
Bye.
---
Pretty cool WOW
---
You and me both buddy.
---
Anyone who says Thunderclap has no idea what they're talking about. It is only usable in battle stance in Vanilla. That means it comes with a reduced threat mod from the stance. You're way better off just tab sundering.
---
Really your only hope is having dps smart enough not to go balls deep AOE from the instant you pull. The most important thing is to give the tank at least a couple seconds to establish threat.
---
&gt; meaning possibly doing some dungeons by us 2 only, or at least trying! 
---
LOL...are you looking to take on 5 man dungeons with only the two of you?  Sorry I kept reading.  Yep you are.  That's not gonna work.
---
WoW indeed ;)
---
“Oh btw Classic is out too....” Imagine?
---
I know about it, but this trinket so rare. Very hard to get it, and many PvP players want to get it. As I play rogue, I don't need it so much.
---
We don't ban people from promoting their own content here outright, but we have specific content creator rules in the sidebar for r/ClassicWoW.
---
Haha this is awesome. 
---
Why isnt shaman in the list?
---
You shouldn't have to worry too much about being declined as a tank for dungeon groups. As long as you have some skill and gear, tanks will pretty much always be the most in demand. Healing 5 mans can be a bit trickier because of the rez situation. Having a friendly shadow priest or enh shaman to run with can always fix that though.
---
Nah brah, level 10 where it be. Bear form, duel wield, pet, totem, stance, and void walker. RIP priest, paladin, and mage. 
---
I just forgot about it lol
---
Been playing forever and first time as well.
---
And bloodfang, ten storms, nemesis, netherwind, wrath.. full of classics!
---
You should play it. Everyone loves a shaman. We need more shamans. When I see a druid as my healer for a dungeon I think, what a fucking waste. Kinda like having a hunter for dps.
---
You can ank, res, totem twist, big dick burst dps. Shamans are always needed and more sought after healer. If you can totem twist you are above the rest.
---
Mine was not an anecdote, streamers are video proof. Your source is an anecdote. 
---
And the point is that it doesn't knock you offline. There is no punishment at all unless you fall into the category where you said something in the blacklist. 
---
&gt; What we had to go by was the description in the tooltips that read "this ability generates additional threat" or "this ability generates a high amount of threat". These were vague and not all that helpful. So you had to try out all the abilities that did damage or said something vague about "more threat" and go by feel (no threat meters). 
---
Idk where you were but the work of many people such as Ciderhelm pretty well fleshed out all the threat mechanics in pretty short order. And KTM/KLH were very available in vanilla. 
---
in-game experience when greeding/needing. Unless you 2 actually /roll than ya can settle it however you want.
---
I started playing in summer of 2005, seven months after the game had launched and was able to get into a decent raiding guild pretty easily. 
---
So I'm correct.
---
&gt; Mine was not an anecdote, streamers are video proof. Your source is an anecdote.
---
Dude, I **linked a video** of it happening.
---
Yep.  If it sucks, then back to the private servers for me.  I haven't been playing in anticipation of classic.
---
It gets more fun in higher levels where not ccing a mob is punished more. You can tie up 2 mobs for a good amount of time. I love the trap survival skills for this reason. 26 second frost trap that wont get resisted, and you can get a solid fd/trap macro to reapply. And your pet can tank something for a bit with you healing.
---
When you pull cast blood rage and then battle shout on your whole group, gaining rage and battle shout give you aoe threat. After that you just have to tab target or demo shout.
---
Dont waste time and rage tanking mobs that arent a threat. Ive seen it so many times;
---
One mob at 50% hp goes loose and the tank goes crazy trying to get it back. Meanwhile, three other mobs get loose. Dont be that guy.
---
Absolute classic no doubt, but for comedy I prefer Roguecraft Episode 3, and for favorite WoW movie in general, I loved The Return: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQvjNRIsyDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQvjNRIsyDM)
---
"Community ruined". That is one of the most nostalgia glasses things ever. Know what the truth is, from end of Vanilla onward point of view that I have? There was no "community". There was your guild, maybe friends from other guilds. There were pricks on every realm which you simply had to endure because there was no one else you could partner up with in activities. Now it's something we can do, now we have so much more ability in finding people for less specific tasks. It made it easier to avoid people you didn't like. My guild gameplay pretty much stayed exactly the same. 
---
Ghostcrawler went on to work on a game with much more limited gameplay possibilty and interaction in WoW. He clearly has a certain criteria to his expectation of communication in games, which is his choice, but still.
---
Por que no los dos?  You could roll Tauren for the stamina and stun and bring a stack noggenfoggers for animations.
---
Yes, you were technically correct about a detail irrelevant to the point of the discussion. Give yourself a big pat on the back, my man.
---
&gt;reporting thinly veiled racism
---
&gt;advance some social agenda
---
You don't have to be pushing an agenda to not tolerate retards. Passive acceptance is already why these people feel safe spouting their edgy dumbassery on pservers. I'm glad they won't be able to in Classic. 
---
You also don't know the algorithm blizzard uses to hand out report-bans. Clearly just having a bunch of people mass spamming one dude for 5 minutes doesn't work. I've never been report-banned on live from whenever that feature was added up until Legion. I don't think Classic is going to be any different. 
---
Even if it is abusable, I don't even care. The salty tears of edgelords realising that they'll have to behave are worth it. 
---
Don't get me started about fel energy 
---
My main memory of it is that I was so closed minded as a child I remember it being vaguely around the time I decided my human female rogue had the wrong shade of hair and I needed to delete it and remake the exact same class race combo. Unsurprisingly I never levelled a character to 60 until right before TBC launched, despite playing from BWL release. 
---
&gt;Look mate, every class is boring to play in vanilla raids. Don't pick a class for their PvE rotation.
---
I found hunters and DPS warriors to be quite fun in raids.
---
&gt;TC is shit threat, but I believe demo will do more threat than battle if there are tons of mobs.
---
BS depends on how many people you're buffing with it. TC and Demo shout our quite good at reducing incoming damage which can be important when trying to hold aggro on a ton of mobs at the same time.  Taking so much damage that your healer pulls healing aggro is a real possibility on a big pull.
---
Best answer. 
---
Wasn’t carrot on a stick a quest reward?
---
Yup but often is the first trinket that most people obtain.
---
Good advice.  One of the things I learned tanking is to let mobs that are going to die soon go, or just hamstring them as they go by. I also liked to let mobs run almost all the way to the healer just to intercept them.  Tanking is often about giving people time to kill rather than making sure everything is beating on you so, letting a mob run around harming no one is fine as long as you prevent it from harming your healer.
---
Yeah, but there is not much to do right now. They just released early access.
---
Never touch early access. 
---
Except, as you pointed out, it IS illegal. Just because you're unlikely to get caught doesn't change that one bit.
---
&gt; But when you get to Miami, you can't be more in Miami.
---
You should check out Cuba.
---
Didnt say anything about it being evil :). But if everyone would do it Alliance would only have Dwarf Priests and Human Rogues/Warriors (obvious examples ofc). 
---
But this sub is just a part of the Classic community so I yeah... there will be plenty of people who don’t care as well probably.
---
Ok
---
If only companies had some department tasked with hyping up and promoting their goods and services...
---
Lol
---
Probably. It’s a great trinket for wpvp or BGs where generally I have an entire bag of use trinkets lol
---
Fucking imagine if Method brings and gears a Ret pally.
---
Coming from someone who never even created a warrior alt until wotlk, was the TC mob attack speed reduction ever useful? I am to assume it didn't work on bosses, but on trash in 5mans?
---
Less attack speed = less incoming attacks = less damage, right?
---
Dude, calm down.
---
I have mine too but at no time since release have I ‘just found it’.
---
Nice bait
---
I was a warlock in vanilla - I was so stoked to get my free fire horse that I actually hearthed the split second I hit 40.
---
In the middle of a dungeon.
---
^^^sorry ^^^to ^^^everyone ^^^in ^^^that ^^^run ^^^:(
---
Omg the multiboxers are going to be the worst. Kill a multiboxer out in the world? Insta-disconnect. Start farming or doing a quest where a multiboxer is farming? Insta-disconnect
---
I see you didn't understand what I said. Breaching a contract is not a crime, it's a civil court case. Violating a ToS/EULA agreement is not any more illegal than, say, not paying your phone bill.
---
You *can* be taken to court for breaching a contract (but you can be taken to court for pretty much anything), but for you to lose, the contract must be valid and enforceable. Many of the clauses found in your average EULA clickwrap agreement are not enforceable. What constitutes (un)enforceable is pretty much at the judge's discretion, though, but that is a can of dumb worms that I'm not going to open.
---
So no, you're not "unlikely to get caught", you're "unlikely to get sued". And on the infinitesimally small chance that you get on the bad side of Bobby Kotick and he decides to sue you for running a local MaNGOS instance, you're even less likely to lose the case, given that there is virtually nothing Blizzard can do to show that you have caused them any meaningful damage by your actions.
---
Also, many EULAs, IIRC including WoW's, have a clause that says that both parties of the contract will, in the event of problems, pursue settling the matter out of court before filing any lawsuits. In other words, if Blizzard sues you outright for a ToS violation, they themselves are in breach of the contract.
---
Classic isn't going to be anywhere near their main focus. This is basically just a little side project that they want to just basically let be self-reliant and not require any additional support after release. We aren't going to change their mind on this. The least we can do is suggest the next best thing.
---
Our guild was also a little goofy - we did gold rolls occasionally (lowest roll wins - we did loot council, so /roll was usually just offspec/BoE/minor upgrade shit anyway).
---
I would win a good 50% of our rolls on our golf nights. We (they - not me) started to resent them because I kept winning *even though, mathematically, the odds were the fucking same.*
---
I was curious to check it out. The only official sauce I found was that patch 1.3.0 made it so that [If more than one player ties a loot roll, a random player will receive the loot.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.3.0#User_Interface).
---
"A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad"
---

---
I'd prefer a summer release date, but have all/most of the things working in the game than have a rushed/unfinished/unpolished piece of crap that'd held together by duct tape and Elmer's glue (ahem, BFA).
---
I posted saying something to the effect that I knew human players didn't even get Exalted with Stormwind upon reaching level 60 in Vanilla in that other thread about trying to get Exalted by 40 as a Gnome. Some people were downvoting my post because others were saying they did it on pservers. :/
---
Arent they already changing classic though with loot trading? 
---
You're absolutely right. Either their options are to make the servers bigger without sharding and cause there to be literally thousands of people in each starting zone at launch or have larger servers with sharding in the beginning zone.
---
Thanks again for your responses!
---
I've got an ergohuman v2 plus deluxe. Pricy (not as pricy as some), but works well. 
---
I think I had like 50 gp and so 40 was kinda depressing for me because I realized It's going to be awhile before I get my mount even though I got the level. This was back when the game was first realesed and I think it cost around 100 gold to get your mount. 
---
For what it's worth, this just took me on a trip down memory lane. Remember my first login (NE Warrior) and immediately start shouting about how beautiful the world is lol. 
---
wtf :D

Soon tm. It's how they used to handle the media. 
---
Right click *reported,* banned!
---
Ninja looting, while extremely scummy, isn't against the TOS.
---
It's important to remember that without the ability to be bad, being good has less meaning.
---
The fact that people could corpse camp you, or ninja loot, or leave in the middle of a dungeon,
---
made it so much more meaningful when some people didn't attack you while questing, or passed on an upgrade because it was a bigger upgrade for you, or stuck through with you in a dungeon after many wipes...
---
Really hoping that the Activision Blizzard ethos of "play nice, be nice, or get banned" doesn't interfere with the old Blizzard Vanilla WoW experience of "real world, real people, real consequences to your choices."
---
Ignore anything that's marketed as "gaming".
---
As a priest wouldn't the memory be at 45 since wand spec is a thing?
---
This post (trolling or not) signifies all that is wrong with this fucking sub. I really should just stop looking here.
---
Coating your argument in legal lingo doesn't make me wrong. I never once implied it was a criminal offense. Go back and read what I wrote. I'm well aware of the legal process involved, probably quite a bit more than you.
---
The Vanilla trinket game is about having as many good trinkets as possible. TrinketMenu or any similar addons with priority systems are great.
---
They and their server don't use the vanilla code anymore. They need to convert it to the current programing language while keeping it looking and working like the old world without all the bugs and hacks. The logic release date should be late August when the vacations have ended amd everyone is coming back to school or work. They have time until then. I hope they release it as close to as it was without any newer wow life comforting features. 
---
Agreed. Hunters are great if you want to focus on timing+pets while Warrior is always about making the right split-second decision. Then there's feral druid if you just want to mash buttons all night powershifting.
---
&gt; I never once implied it was a criminal offense.
---
You said it's illegal. That's implying that it breaks a law. It does not.
---
Of course dps and healers have responsibility managing their threat, but especially in dungeons, a good tank will enable the entire party.
---
I'm in a high end raiding guild on a pserver and when with one of my guild's tanks in a dungeon I can AoE dps to my heart's content (more or less). They're so good at holding threat.
---
Meanwhile, I can't touch any target other than the main target with some PUG tanks that don't even put sunder on any of the adds. This leads to slower clears of dungeons overall.
---
Speed is the ultimate goal in dungeons when you're at the high end.
---
People underestimate how much "AoE" threat a good tank can really hold in Vanilla.
---
The best thing Classic will do is, even if Activision Blizzard ruins it with right click report etc, they will have released the accurate Vanilla values,
---
so all these private servers which employ actual GMs and still have the old client and older more free approach to social interactions can finally have more accurate quest and rep values to make the experience more authentic.
---
Even if Activision Blizzard botch Classic, Vanilla WoW will benefit.
---
Hunters are kings in dungeons where you have multi-mob packs and can fully use multi-shot's damage. Between doing that, managing my pet and keeping random mobs off the healer I haven't found dungeons boring. Ditto for kiting around 1-2 wing clipped mobs to take pressure off the whole group when shitpulls happen (looking at you, UBRS). I've found it gets a lot more interesting when you're not in your levelling spec anymore as you get Scatter Shot and can peel a lot more proactively + use it as an interrupt. You can also keep a mob trapped for over a minute straight if you chain FD--&gt;Freezing Trap correctly and you don't get regular/heartbeat resists.
---
I'm still hyped as f$#%!
---
Playing on pservers the whole time. Can't wait for release. It's gonna be so epic!
---
Sigh. Read your post I was responding to. You clearly weren't referring to criminal law, and neither was my response in that context...
---
The answer is yes. There is catch-up gear.
---
When ZG is released, and to an extent DM gear, both offer good enough gear to get you raiding BWL+. In fact some ZG gear is bis until Naxx even.
---
There is also "Naxx blues" which were added to dungeons during Naxx, which may or may not be available during launch (Activision Blizzard hasn't commented on whether or not they're going to do progressive itemization in this regard).
---
A lot of this gear is better than early raid gear, and was probably intended as a catch up mechanic when they were eventually added.
---
There is also dungeon 0.5 tier armor from the questlines, which may or may not be worth it. For some classes it's absolutely worth it to go as far as the gloves in the chain, but I don't know if it's "really worth it" to go all the way in the chain.
---
So some of the items you get during the chain to summon summonable bosses are extremely valuable because those summonable bosses in dungeons drop some pieces of gear that are comparable to AQ40 gear.
---
Your preferrence points seem to scream warrior to be honest. Dynamic fluid rotation, lots of damage, ability to tank and be useful in groups, shiny weapons. The leveling is hard, but it's far from boring.
---
I did a LOT of AOE tanking through to naxx. For massive groups like whelps and goblin technicians in BWL, Oil of Immolation and Demo shout worked for me. Engineering will help. But really it's going to depends a lot on how different the mechanics in classic are going to be in comparison to private servers.
---
Back in time 2005 with Hunter 40 Hours over some weeks after this i have always enough money and no need for additional farming.
---
I spend money, epic mount, all enchants, raiding, darkmoon sets and a lot of pvp. this all costs money.
---
its cost you 2000 gold to make pvp, raiding, epic mount and all enchants + repair, pots and so on.
---
in summer with classic i will try to farm while leveling.
---
Only if you specced into it (which is NOW considered the "right" way to do it). But for a nooby 15-year-old, I was FULL SHADOW POWER!!!!!!!
---
Right? My buddy Leika even warned me to save everything, but I still went into level 40 with something like 15 gold. XD
---
RIP XD
---
My plan is to tank 5mans and only inv casters so i can have my hand of justice and ironfoe 100% when the drop.
---
Yeah, but it doesn't have that same sense of accomplishment since you got there in just a few hours.
---
I may actually do this. Thinking about it, there are  lot of benefits to it if you can get the habit
---
I very clearly remember it being considered very impressive for some factions to do this even at 60.  For the most part everyone on the medium pop server i played on didn’t consider it worth the massive time sink because of how little rep you got for the cloth turn ins.
---
The only healing chests better than the quest chest are T2 and thr exalted robes from strat( which is also the best chest until AQ40 and Naxx). The healing chest from the 50 druid quest are absolutely the best option to pick out of the 3 options. 
---
The staff can be easily replaces with the Av rep staff.
---
And the dps chest can be replaced by the crafted bear harness fairly easily. 
---
Seems you PvP'd in PvE gear which from my experience only really favoured classes with solid burst DPS (read AP PoM Pyro Mages). Then again Hunters had reasonable burst dependingon build.
---
 I never raided so my gear was restricted to R13 armour set with Anathema which I bought rather than raided for (I had the R14 staff but preferred the look of the Anathema).
---
PvE gear lacked stamina which makes any class vulnerable to be bursted down.  High stamina PvP gear + SW:P + Devouring Plague + Vampiric Embrace and Mindflay spam usually ment I dropped the other player to less than half HP before they got me under 90%.
---
I agree that many kids were drawn to Hunters (and Warriors) which would make them seem easier to beat as a Class in general.
---
You've probably got a point.  The young/newish players focused on damage over utility abilities which would reason why so few used Viper Sting and almost exclusively Serpent Sting.
---
Things might be different now that many returning players have more experience.
---
This is really cool, but could someone explain the new playmat vs mousemat trend? Like why are things this size taking off, doesn't the keyboard cover 80% of it?
---
Don't feed the troll.
---
Playmats are for card games like Magic the Gathering. They usually have outstanding artwork and the material is close to what you need for a mouse pad. However, this is not large enough for me to fit both my keyboard and mouse on, but luckily I have enough desk space to fit both, and I put this pad on the right side of my L desk and rest my mouse hand on that side.
---
Those super long "gaming pads" that you're interested to put your keyboard on are different,I don't know much about those, I've been a laptop user for a decade until this last Christmas.
---
For me I chose a player because it's later than a standard non-gaming mouse pad but has awesome art that the big gaming mousepads don't have
---
Isn't that why guilds used to use "dragon kill points"? You get more points as you complete raids with the guild, and then you can "bid" on item drops?
---
always save the rage you don't need for the next pull. 
---
if you lose aggro on a mob don't panic. especially in the first few seconds. if you switch before securing aggro on the other mobs you will just end up losing aggro on them aswell and become rage starved.
---
only taunt when its necessary. also try to have at least rage for 1 sunder before the taunt or you will most likely lose aggro very quickly again.
---
keep mobs away from the healers. if a dps pulls aggro and dies its usually not your fault. besides, most dps have way to handle a single mob for a small amount of time.
---
You shall not taint my legacy!
---
Trolls are cooler but i think UD because of extra spell is better.
---
i like farming, but if i watched some videos it seems its terrible to farm with sp. Now i have 6 months to check pro and cons to really make an SP. 
---
This group has already done that although there are some bugs with it and it isn't quite complete because they don't do enchants or some racials. https://www.classicwowtools.live/
---
When they added xmog, I would often have sets to make me look like a skittle bag anyways as a throwback to vanilla.
---
Can anyone else do the Mara farm besides hunters? 
---
Yeah, I've been wondering about this as well. People saying "exalted at level 35" feels wrong to me.  
---
I remember farming runecloth for weeks to get exalted with Darkspear for that sweet raptor. A friend of mine was doing morrowgrain research a long time to get a Kodo.  
---
  
---
I wonder how a community used to private servers will react to realizing private servers are wrong. 
---
Notice this comment on wowhead:
---
&gt;By swotam (4,219 – 1·15·59) on 2006/12/27 (Patch 2.0.1)
---
&gt;This quest rewards 150 Stormwind reputation as of patch 2.01
---
So it could be that classicdb is simply using more recent value.
---
I will try this quest on a pserver later and I will let you know how much rep I'll get. But it is generally accepted that pservers aren't 100% representation of vanilla WoW even if they claim to be "100% Blizzlike". Hell, mage's Blink works slightly differently on every pserver, I can't wait to try how it's supposed to work on vanilla once Classic releases.
---
Oh god no.... You know the loot rules before joining to a raid / guild (if you don't understand to ask this it's your mistake). Just don't join if they have loot council system. It not the only way of distributing the loot you know.
---
I like farming, 2005 with hunter farming was no problem and fun. but i don't know to roll SP because the ability to farm with him or not. some advice for me? i don't make twinks.
---
Id say something like level 42 when you actually can hit exalted. But then again, if thats your FIRST char on a FRESH server, you might not have the gold to buy the mount before that anyways. Since you wont be grinding areas where you can make good cash, you are mostly doing quests to get the rep.
---
Thanks! I had the idea that playmats were exclusively for card games, but I've seen more people posting "gaming pads"/playmats (general Internet trend not just this sub) and got very confused as to why people were picking them for mouse/keyboard lmao.
---
They mostly existed in form of new gear added to the game, such as Titanic Leggings, a neck that drops in stratholme (forgot its name) that is better than the neck from Ragnaros, or just certain item or set reworks.
---
That's weird. What's wrong with ASCII eyes?
---
Tired of these non-issues being discussed on the subreddit.
---
You wrote what you wrote in response to "every class pays the same except for pally and warlock". The implication being that druids do not pay the same. Either you're too stubborn to admit your quote proved nothing, or too stupid to realise the implication of what you wrote. If that wasn't what you meant at all then why post it as a comment to the original statement? 
---
You should thrust the team that you are in. Or look for a guild that uses DKP.
---
Classics most important catch up mechanic is other people quitting. A LOT of guilds will have open recruitment almost all the time. Lets say game is in BWL patch, if you join a guild doing BWL, you will instantly be geared with MC stuff (if its worth using in the first place). The part you have to do is getting somewheat pre-bis in instances. And people constantly run instances for gold, quests, alts etc.
---
From a complete non-biased point of view, id say Shaman would be a good pick for you. They are incredibly useful in a group situation, they are almost always under represented so finding a guild/raid spot should be easy, they get ghost wolf form which helps with travel times while leveling, also while leveling you will be chasing the next shiny weapon for windfury procs, and end game you’ll have an engaging rotation with healing and totem twisting to add some flavor.  Its what my best friend landed on after months and months of indecision.  Did you by chance get to play the demo?
---
Sounds reasonable. 
---
Id say, unless the mob attacks a healer (very unlikely) just let it go and focus on the ones you got. And if there's only 2 mobs left, you might want to get the runner back to keep decent rage regeneration going for the next pack.
---
Where do people see those corrupt councils? I raided since 2009 with councils only and I never seen a corrupt one.  On the contrary I more often saw councilmembers not taking loot, because they feared accusations. 
---
A LC is always a trust thing, and needs people that know what they are doing. On the other hand with personal loot you make the whole raid the council. Even little billy that wants Cts on his hunter....
---
My orc looked just like this in BC before I started getting t4/t5 
---
Ahhhhhh the good days cant wait to relive some of my nostalgia in classic! 
---
Better late then broken. 
---
Exactly. 
---
Racecar chairs are designed to limit lateral movement and be light weight. They are designed for racing, not for office work or gaming.
---
Real ergonomic chairs for office work look much more pedestrian and of course you don't pay the gamer tax.
---
Great addition mate.
---
It's a DMCA. Blizzard actively did this.
---
Terrible pvp video?!? You dont like disturbed, rammstein and unregistered fraps???
---
Can you prove anything related to Joana doing something not legal? You cant, so dont assume that he is comminiting a crime it is defamation.
---
I am pretty sure I did not get any of the major factions to exalted during vanilla (yeah I know you can turn in cloth but there was no point)
---
I'm pretty sure you are right about this. I got my gnome to exalted Stormwind on D----wshire (PServer) by level 43. I remember doing those super low level SW quests (basically just delivery quests) to get those chunks of rep.
---
Damn. It really continually amazes me how much stuff was/is wrong on Private Servers. I know a LOT of people are planning to pursue Exalted, and when those correct values hit them this summer.... they are going to cry foul... **LOUDLY.**
---
&gt;  don't try to homogenise everything.
---
*"will it blend (into a paste of beige gruel that taste like shit)?"*
---
sunder TAB, repeat
---
Thunder clap is only for small groups as it hits only 5 targets
---
&gt; Anybody with the free time can sit down and play 12 hours a day of video games
---
I like how you started to backpedal from your original claim
---
&gt;Anybody can spend 12 hours a day playing video games
---
Where's that "free time" suddenly coming from? Why was it not in your original statement?
---
So you basically agree that not everyone can play the 12 hours a day consistently to become skilled enough for pro level playing? 
---
he backpedaled with the free time thing. It was not in his original statement, so he basically just disagreed with himself anyways. 
---
Exactly this. It will be extremely well known by the time launch hits. I don't mind the content, but yeah.... not gonna be any secrets this time around with so many content creators searching for unique items to make guides on.
---
This guy was already a nightmare to camp/farm.
---
Charge (bloorage while charging), thunderclap, def stance, demoshout and you have a good start going. A healer wont pull aggro off after that. Then you can briefly focus on the skull, next sunders for EEEEVERYoNE. If there is loads of mobs just do shout spam.
---
If you charge in, your group can easily be out of range of battleshout and it generates threat based on how many ppl it hits. Meaning thunderclap is going to make MUCH more sense. And id say people underestimate thunderclap anyways. So, if your charge is on cd or its a pack you dont want to charge, its best to pull ranged, bloodrage, battleshout (as you stand in middle of your group) etc.
---
Forced personal loot is pretty horrible. I don’t like the idea of someone getting loot who barely shows up or is a fill in, over a player who is there day in day out, let’s face it the person who doesn’t deserve the loot isn’t going to trade it to the person who does under most circumstances. 
---
I agree with you about loot councils tho, I don’t like a mob of self entitled elitists deciding if the like me enough to give me loot. 
---
Dkp is the go. You kill the dragon you get the points, you spend the points you get the loot. 
---
A DMCA strike paints an entirely different picture. 
---
I cant wait to see some dress wear bitch healadin and be in awe that he has BIS. 
---
Another fantastic thread about Months Behind 
---
The winter months are the most quiet time when it comes to Blizz news. I'm expecting new information in march. If they plan a beta, the announcement has to come soon. 
---
Ofc a high end tank will hold aggro, he usually has a engineering shield. Great weapons and stats generating much, MUCH more rage than a crappy geared pug guy. A pug tank will stack defence, avoidance and stamina. Highend tank will stack %hit, %crit, agility, str. They even use leather or whatever to LOWER their armor value to get more rage. Go dualwielding in fury spec. Just because they know their healers can handle it.
---
But, its about skill too.
---
Denial.
---
It took me months of runecloth to get near orgrinmar exalted.
---
Yeah ridiculous denial.
---
 \&gt; How much time daily did you spend farming for flasks/elixirs/other raid consumables?
---
Depends on whether your guild requires you to flask for the raid or only regular consumables. Also depends on your class and professions. A couple of hours during the weekend or while waiting for a dungeon group should be fine for most people.
---
\&gt; How many nights a week was typical for raiding in vanilla? How long did each raid night go?
---
Back in 2005 we raided tuesday and thursday from 19 - 23h and sunday from 15-23, we were one of the better guilds on the server. In more recent times it was like twice a week for 3 hours.
---
\&gt; Was it difficult farming your required mats as a warrior? Or did someone from the guild help you out?
---
Never played warrior myself but as a DD warrior your best bet is teaming up with a healer and farming the sh\*t out of elite mobs (e.g. DM:E), as a Tank running strat live and reserving first or and recipe works wonders.
---
\&gt; Will flasks/consumables be as necessary this time around, since the fight mechanics are all known?
---
Depends on the guild, definitly overkill for any content on farm, probably mandatory for progression. Flask make a HUGE difference!
---
\&gt; How long did it take you to get your pre raid BiS?
---
Term did not exist 2005, on a more recent server if you try to get most of the pieces and skip stuff that lets you run UBRS 50 times you can do it pretty quickly if you find the right dungeon groups. Just flist a couple of tanks, healers, mages, or just people that are good at the game to always find a group quickly after logging on. If you go really want all pieces from spread sheet X it will take you a while (Hand of Justice, Briarwood Reed or even worse Ironfoe require some luck to get...)
---
\&gt; Was it best to go herb/alch as a tank and make your own flasks/elixers? Or Mining/BS for gear while levelling and as a fresh 60?
---
You can level any profession while leveling, but it will slow you down. Crafting professions are a big time sink, gathering is okay, but it depends on you. There is no bonus on having Alchemy on your main so having it on a level 35 alt works fine. You need a level 60 for gathering herbs/mining/skinning though (or play the AH).
---
First aid is mandatory for all classes and especially important for warriors.
---
\&gt; Was any/all of this different for Off Tanks?
---
Applies to any class. Most tanks in the game will be offtanks (fury specced with DEF gear), there are usually only 3 full time tanks per guild. The MT is usually an officer as it is the most time consuming role to play and all gear is funneled into him for obvious reasons.
---
[removed]
---
Play a priest/druid. It doesnt matter what your gear is, youll always be in demand.
---
In vanilla you had to turn in a lot of runecloth to get exalted with a different faction. There was a gnome player who found a repeatable quest in swamp of sorrows that he did a buttload of times to get exalted before they actually put in the runecloth turnin
---
This is why aq war effort was a godsend, you got tons of rep if you helped out
---
I guess this is just a semantic argument, but to me it's not piracy to play a game that is not available anywhere else and whom the original developers have no intention of making available again (which was the case before Classic announcement)
---
I think people who are used to private servers in general are in for a surprise. Dropchances, reps, goldfarming, xp values, resistances etc.
---
Guess you are playing alliance 
---
quick wifey's boyfriend is over go chug that last bottle of soymilk before u gotta eat his ass
---
Something to remember, if you charge in...
---
&gt; In vanilla Battle Shout does 55 threat per person buffed (so 275 in a 5 man party), split between all mobs; compared to 130 split plus the damage caused per mob with Thunderclap. 
---
No other player will be in range of your shout, most likely. Your charge has 25y range, while shouts are 20y unbuffed. So if you charge from max range (and usually stand bit closer than anyone else), others WONT be in range of your battle shout, unless they move in. Meaning thunderclap/demo might be better than battle shout.
---
 Same thing if you have mostly ranged group.  Healers and ranged dps have around 30-40y max range. 
---
Honestly I didn't even know it was a thing to use playmats as mousepads, I just knew I needed something bigger than my $10 travel mousepad from my laptop if I was gonna game more seriously, then remembered I had an old Magic playmat laying around. I started shopping for a new one and I saw some sites selling both things.
---
Nowadays the companies like Corsair and Razer like to slap "Gaming" on everything and market the hell out of it and people buy it up so I'd say that's why the trend started
---
You found one example. Doesn't mean every quest has less reputation gain. I checked 6 quests from Teldrassil. They have the same rep gain on classicdb.ch and classic.wowhead.com
---
Sure, some quests might give you less, but it won't be impossible to get to exalted at 40.
---
Once you had runecloth turn ins, you could easily buy exalted for 5k or so gold if I remember correctly.
---
Yeah its super important. IMO one of the biggest problems you can make for yourself is skipping dungeon quests. They really do matter alongside grinding mobs as you go to eliminate the "gaps". They start to show up a bit like @Gurgles1 mentioned around 37-45 if you skipped all the instance quests like DM/Stocks/Uld/SM.
---
The small bits of xp you get from killing the instance mobs during your runs + all the quests adds up to more than I ever thought. I wont be making that same mistake this summer. I hate Uldaman, but Im gonna do it.
---
I'm not making any claims in regards to Joana, just pointing out crap logic.
---
Are you saying it should take longer in classic or shorter? I reached exalted with Org as a Tauren at 51 on lightbringer.
---
Warlocks have that too, we get a free mount at 40, but our 31pt talent is at 45 ( 5/31/0, or 5/0/31 ).  
---
imp corruption is absolute must have.
---
P.S. I'm sure someone will comment that you only need 2 points in it, ignore them.
---
Personal loot won't work when there are 40 ppl fighting over 2 drops. Some will never have the RNG gods on their side. 
---
I was going to roll Warlock in the Alliance, which is often said to be in demand as well. What do you think?
---
Regardless of PUG or guild run or raid, loot rules should always be agreed before you join the group/guild.  There will be guilds running dkp or suicide kings systems, there will also most likely be raid PUG's after about 6 months.
---
The one thing you control is if you accept the loot rules of the group.
---
I have seen LC corruption, but its VERY rare, and this is coming from someone with several YEARS of played time on private realms.
---
There is literally no solution required to a community driven problem, You join groups that meet your criteria, you join a guild with a loot system you approve of.
---
Obvious troll.
---
But we are in February and hearing so little official news is getting annoying. Especially for those organising summer holiday but wanting to book time off for launch.
---
I'm afraid we aren't going to get news until PAX East
---
How does DKP work with consumables ? Do officers have to check and give them accordingly or is there a way to track this to reward people who come prepared.
---
Legion and Bfa both got announced in November. The releasedate got announced both in April. 
---
So April it is.
---
Warlocks can iirc, but without access to fd it becomes slower and more difficult.
---
If your LC just gear themselves, they wont have raiders very quickly. And then what loot are you going to steal from others ? People will spread the news about your guild, about that corrupt LC. Nobody wants to join your guild. You wont get raids going so even the people who stayed will leave. 
---
And thats how the problem will get solved.
---
Every youtuber atm. Make up a problem that might or might not be in the game. Bitch about it for 20 minutes and say it will kill the game. Sigh.
---
Both races get 2 racial priest abilities. Trolls get hex of weakness and shadowguard. Undead get touch of weakness and devouring plague.
---
The arguments are, that Devouring Plague is the way to go, because it deals high amount of damage, is instant cast DOT and heals the caster over time. It does have a 3 minute CD.
---
On the other hand, there are some crazy shenanigans  you can do with blackout and shadowguard. Hex of weakness is also pretty neat in PvP against melee classes.
---
The most important thing is that you don't hunch over for extended periods of time, and also get up when you can, like on fps.
---
I did do this in live when I was leveling, it took me over a month and a few levels to get the tb rep as undead. This was during bc so not sure what changed for main faction rep.
---
It's not the LC that's the problem, it's that you had guild officers you didn't trust.
---
Or you have about 30trinkets in your backpacks, use two on your bars, disengage by using your classe's kite ability (like warrior hamstring), queue new trinkets with TrinketMenu and go with 2 new on use trinkets. In drawn out fights PvPers use 5+ trinkets all the time.
---
Conflag in MC? Thats a big yikes. 
---
As someone who actually has been muted:
---
1. It is for 24 hours, not 3
---
2. You are refrained from every communication available, that means /say, /yell, /party
---
3. The so called "blacklist" you refer to is actually anything that offends anyone. I have actually bothered to read the terms of conditions of blizzard. You can literally be muted for anything
---
But, once again, because I still don't understand, what is the point of this system? Why bother with it all?
---
This is a pretty good answer, but with that said; dire maul and t0.5 could be considered small catch-up mechanics, albeit much more subtle than "get a billion billion artifact power".
---
Zero-sum DKP and Loot Council were the two most popular loot styles when I played classic and BC. 
---
DKP (in general) rewards attendance and contribution. Folks who show up and contribute get points. Highest bidder gets loot.
---
Loot Council puts the 'gear balance' in the hand of an oligarchy - usually guild officers. They decide who gets loot.
---
Loot Council Pros:
---
 * (ASSUMING NO DRAMA) Loot is going to players that benefit the guild the most.
---
 * Loot distribution is planned by people that (IN A PERFECT WORLD) know the game, know what's BiS, etc.
---
Loot Council Cons:
---
* All the assumptions made above... are massive assumptions.
---
DKP Pros:
---
* Attendance is rewarded. 
---
* Contribution is rewarded.
---
* Loot is player-determined. Players set their own expectations.
---
DKP Cons:
---
* Players often ignore the 1~5% upgrades because they would be a waste of points - even if it's upgrading to something raid-tier bis. Because they want to bank points.
---
* Objectively worse players (for the guild) could get loot before objectively better players.
---
That's my 2c at least. I'd say -- if you're in a 'new' guild, use DKP. If you are in a guild that is fairly tight knit -- use LC. 
---
Nifty Stopwatch and Insignia would like to have a word
---
I think they are secretly embeding server sharding and LFG dungeon teleport features so there is nothing to be loud and proud to community.
---
Thats the pro about it. But look at it this way : you are benefiting the "good students" by giving them fancy things whilst the "bad students" get nothing. This creates a gap that will only increase due to the "good students" pulling more dps and having the feeling that they are getting rewarded for their time.  Again the "bad students" will feel like their time is worth less than the others and will start to sign less and less because why would they even come?
---
Are the mobs considered infight with you aka have they aggroed you when you start your charge? Because bloodrage produces threat and you dont want to have the initial 10% health damage threat go to waste.
---
Watch yourself on that edge my dear.
---
Its how we did it back in the day. 
---
In the serenity now clip, you see people in RP gear. This was the gear they kept to look cool for events, guild screenshots, funerals, etc..
---
My mum had most of her bags and bank filled with gear to change into for when she was hanging out with her friends fishing, hanging out. 
---
If you bring ur slave robes, noble finery, battle gear you show your real dedication to RP. 
---
Not just some kid that googles asmomgolds xmog comps and put on the most glowing fiery outfit that he sees. 
---
Rogue with ironfoe? what heresy is this?
---
AoE aggro is only considered for 6+ mobs really like the maggots in Maraudon. Your best bet is to be the one pulling them all together and then ask your group to bomb these mobs with allout AoE with no regards for threat. Equip your 2hander and join in in the fun. Warriors have no chance of properly AoE tankig outside of challenging shout. So focus on nuking the non elite 20mobs. If there is an elite, make sure to hold threat on that one and let your group do its work.
---
Well the guilds ive been in have been enabling the loot drama. For example : we had a good mt,  no problems with tps and he logged every raid and came with full consumes. 
---
Now the guild leader that started as a priest, rolled warrior. First as dps.  He starts taking BRE and other fancy purples. In the meanwhile the mt was getting all the big items.
---
During one run the guild leader sees that he can get good tps and decides on the spot that he wants to be mt.  Now the decked mt goes dps and the guild leader starts taking all the big items...
---
Fair?
---
You are the one that said you would love opinions. Being passive agressive makes you look cool though. I get it.
---
But my guess is you never played vanilla. Or you are just bad at the game. Or both.
---
Thank you for asking for opinions. You are the type of person that will make ppl stop reading this sub lol.
---
I am almost exalted with darn, almost revered with stormwind, honored with gnomes and dwarfs at level 35. I only did Elwyn and Westfall apart from the NE zones. These values are clearly wrong. I remember playing a human (10% rep increase) and being stoked for becoming honored with SW. That is almost a given in pservers.
---
Not alone, but I wish it would return with TBC and not vanilla.
---
If you HAVE to tank 5 elite mobs, then reducing their damage by 10% means your healer has to heal 10% less. Combine that with demo shout and your healer can effectively heal for 15% less which is significant for healing aggro. 
---
You either charge pull (you have rage for TC from charge) or you range pull (activate blood rage, by the time, the mobs are on you, you have rage for TC). Demo shout, start your sunder/revenge rotation and its easy going from there.
---
Naturally we need to consider what AoE tanking is. Tanking 4 elites you obviously just spam your revenge/shield slam/sunder and with 20 non elites you pull them together, equip your 2hander and bomb with the rest of the group.
---
Vestments of the Shifting Sands. Only for the truly fashionable.
---
Ive been playing since beta my friend. Im also top 5 dps in the guild so afraid you assumed wrong... 
---
Hope you have a great day.
---
&gt;they will have released the accurate Vanilla values,
---
No they won't. They don't have a complete backup of 1.12 data, only the source code.
---
&gt;It can **at best** make things worse. 
---
in combination with 
---
&gt;Damn you’re naive.
---
makes me wonder about your sanity. 
---
the big con of DKP is that you need your most active players to game the system hard and pass on upgrades that would help the guild as a whole because 50% attendance joe blow decides on bidding all of his DKP earned in the last three months on the awesome new main tank agro weapon.   
---
So as a result you either have your MT burn all of his DKP and therefore not get a shot at armor upgrades for a long time, or you have some half-geared offtank wielding the best agro weapon in your guild while your DPS (that is now overgeared compared to your actual MT) has to hold back.
---
And this is exactely that makes it fair.
---
Im quite sceptical when it comes to total strangers  in an online environment. 
---
I don’t think this will be a big enough issue to warrant changes. If it did I would add a 20 minute deserter buff for leaving BGs in progress.
---
do i need to say. your name into a mirror 3 times to summon you? :) 
---
Is this a joke? Who is not getting loot? Your logic is retarded.
---
And then you have Dreamstate going without TF for years on end because of bad luck. :(
---
Pserver ppl, the real heros of the false world 
---
You sound like a baddie. Not trying to make it personal. But you also sound like a liberal cuck. Gtfo of here with your personal loot lol.
---
Dont understand your question. Isnt it clear? The loot council decides who they want to give gear. Read up mate.
---
Thanks for this information. I don't follow Retail since I don't care about it. Hope this rule will apply on Classic too and we'll see some info soon.
---
When is Pax East?
---
Wow you obviously got some frustrations... Im trying to open up a dialogue and you feel the need to tilt instantly. Quite sad but feel free to join in and discuss. 
---
Cannot recall the faction part. I know for a fact rogues did not have cloak of shadows or shadow step.
---
Not only that but an assassination/sub rogue. Heresy!
---
If memory serves correctly my guild used a  raid buff tracking addon. During progression raids they would use this to check for flasks, mongoose, juju, etc. If you were not buffed with the mandatory consumables you would be hit with a dkp penalty.
---
I'd give you the pocket watch for sure but most new people don't grind bg's for trinket. 
---
Indeed, you get ppl like me on the internet that call you stupid and fat. Because you are stupid and fat.
---
roleplay tho. lmao.
---
DKP is so much better.  If you raided enough in progression raids, you get the gear you want.  It's a simple do the work, get paid, model.
---
Lot of players do not give a damn about gear (me included). It's just a means to an end (help the raid succeed)
---
If the same 30-50 players show up for half a year and clear the same raids, everyone will get some kind of gear, regardless of the system. Out of those players a few will bitch about gear regardless of which system you incorporate, the rest will just play and enjoy the game.
---
Who on earth told you that?
---
I think the booty bay quests thing you are referring to is that the more you do for booty bay the more the bloodsail buccaneers hate you. If you get exalted with bloodsail buccaneers you can get a sweet hat.
---
Also I think in desolace you can loose or gain rep with different centaur tribes but don’t remember any particular reason why off the top of my head
---
It wasn't so bad in the beginning. You just made a macro that used the trinket 10times in a row. It didn't active the cooldown or globalcooldown when fizzling. They corrected that in a later patch.
---
Is this egg referencing the ending of T2 or is it from somewhere else in da movie? :)

My biggest worry about classic isn’t that blizzard will fuck it up, it’s that a very large majority of private server players don’t seem to realize that private servers are still very far from perfect replications of vanilla.... while at the same time spouting #nochanges! To shut down discussion on any change they don’t agree with.
---
Example: I was having a discussion on the classic wow discord where someone spouting #nochanges wanted progressive itemization despite the fact that 1.12 talents and abilities never actually existed with 1.1 itemization on an official server.
---
Their reasoning was that because we are getting 1.12 talents/abilities, progressive itemization would be a compromise (not a change)and therefore the most authentic...
---
And to do this he is ignoring the fact that the most authentic implementation is either progressive everything, or being dropped straight in to 1.12 as it was.
---
For some reason I think they really aren't sure about specific details for release and they just aren't 100% sure where they want to go with this "new old wow" after release. So I think they want to avoid painting themselves into a corner.
---
Think there was enough for the media in my opinion, we had panels with quite a few bits of interesting info and several media outlets had developer interviews. 
---
&gt;There are tons of inconsistencies and outright false claims in that. This is one of them. His death is scripted.
---
Yes, I've seen a ton of errors :D That's why I was asking to players
---
Never had any issue with loot council, in my experience they often gear themselves last to incentivise other to perform top notch. Maybe if you have been playing in some Russian блят guilds then yeah LC is not working. Generally tho, it's far superior to dkp, it's like socialism where the government decides who gets what in what order to increase the benefit of all. 
---
They have a 100% completely functional 1.12 client running internally.
---
[source](https://i.redd.it/xphjyye02l001.png)
---
That is the client, not the database. I also have a 100% completely functional 1.12 client on my PC.
---
That’s what im worried about.
---
No single tank can hold aggro for all mobs in AoE situations in classic. Focus on the dangerous ones and keep those.
---
Without the kicking and screaming...Blizzard wouldn't even looked into THE NUMBERS.

I though you might like this.

&gt;A majority of the time you are passing low level mobs that give no XP
---
You are in the wrong area then. You only do that when getting a new areas flypoint.
---
Shadowstep isn't available until pre-TBC patch. (IIRC we got the talents just before the expansion hit?)
---
&gt; My suggestion: make all loot personal but give the opportunity to trade the item you get to another player. 
---
Instant quit from Classic WoW for me.
---
Personal loot is cancer. I want to play a damn MMO with master loot.
---
If you are willing to go healer, Shaman is incredibly fun and engaging and you can easily top meters during raids. As PvP is not your main concern, the abysmal respec costs might be less of an issue.
---
If you want to DPS, Warrior seems to be a clear choice.
---
Both are quite bad to level though.
---
Yea this doesn't surprise me. The core for nostalrius is based off of tbc so there are tons of tbc values floating around that never got changed back. Up until last year they had he required exp for level 1-60 30% wrong so this is nothing new.
---
There's no reason to lower corruption from 1.5s cast to instant while leveling. Warlocks are god awful at pvp pre-death coil anyway.
---
And tbh, example with arms warrior build later on you can easily kill 2 mobs at once. If you do that on your own level, you are going to have to eat/bandage afterwards. But if those are 2-3 levels under you, moving the next mob might easily be enough. Just because the next single mob wont really do any real damage to you.
---
Mostly playing as a healer it took me quite a while to get used to warrior, "im at 45% hp, i can still pull few" mentality.
---
Not worth the debuff slot.
---
Yeah, you might want to skip few mobs just to get bit more regeneration while moving (so you dont have to bandage, eat or drink) while still moving to the area you eventually want to go.
---
Personal loot is not even close to being fare.
---
Because you said mages don't need wands, and I was just adding that they are still very useful early on.
---
&gt;You can level to 60 without ever running out of quests if you're okay with super suboptimal ones.
---
And if you are doing it slowly (meaning gathering a LOT of rested xp along the way). It compensates the lack of quests.
---
If they don't make Classic as Vanilla-like as possible 
---
That‘s pretty the exact same that Ion Hazzikostas said when talking about the main aim of the game. So no worries for me
---
OK, snowflake.
---
I guess this is kind-of to be expected anyway with a 14 year old game.
---
I really want to get a Nightsaber as a Dwarf at 40 but we will see if I can plan some good route or something.
---
to be fair, he's replayed the 1-60 stream about 15 times already. so I'm surprised the little snowflakes took this long to falsely report him
---
"Most warrior abilities add a fixed amount of threat when they land successfully. The following table gives the raw values, i.e. before the modifiers from battle stance or defensive stance, and ignores the damage done by the abilities.
---
Sunder Armor............260
---
Heroic Strike 8...........145
---
Heroic Strike 9 (AQ)....173
---
Revenge 5..................315
---
Revenge 6 (AQ)..........355
---
Shield Bash................180
---
Shield Slam (1.11)......250
---
Thunder Clap..............130
---
Demoralizing Shout.......43
---
Battle Shout.................55
---
Cleave.......................100
---
Execute...................x1.25
---
Devastate ..................101
---
Battle Shout generates 55 threat for each player that is buffed; up to 5 people in your party and their pets, as long as they are on the relevant mob's threat list. For example if you buff a player that is out of combat, no threat is generated. Therefore in a tightly packed group, Battle Shout can rival Sunder Armor for threat, but as a buff the threat is split amongst all the mobs that are aware of you. On the other hand, Demoralizing Shout gives 43 threat to each affected mob. As long as there are 6 or more mobs affected, it will hold aggro as well or better than Sunder Armor."

---
Well, I tell you how I always tanked in Vanilla and how I do it now on Pservers :
---
90% of the time I DO NOT tank the Skull. Most pulls in Classic have a weak mob / caster in it. That weak mob / caster is focused by the DPS, while I am tanking X and another mob. As for the 4th mob, that one is CCed. If there is a 5th mob that one also is CCed. If we have NO CC at all, and the pull is 5 mobs + (let's say 4 elites, 2 non-elites) each DPS will kill the non-elites, I will tank 3 elites and a hunter pet / lock pet will tank the 4th elite.
---
Charging in is not really a viable option most of the time. You have to pull stuff. Thunder Clap is nice, but it's a waste of rage. You can still use it as an aggro generator on packs of non elites, packs that will be AoE'd down, and you won't have to tank them. Non-elites are never tanked in dungeons.
---
Shield spikes are a waste, they work for low lvls (when there is no point to use an expensive enchant on your shield), but marginally.
---
Engi grenades are great, but they won't add too much aggro for an AoE pack. However, their damage will count in reducing the time that pack is AoE'd down.
---
Thing is...your job as a tank is not to tank everything. You can't, for first, and secondly, it is stupid to do it. Mages can kite, hunters can kite, DPS Warriors can kite, Rogues can TANK perfectly any non-elite / weak elite / caster, Hunter pets and Lock pets are great off-tanks in dungeons, any Shaman can kite AND tank some weak mob, Druids can tank some weak mobs...and I didn't even mentioned the CC options : sheep, sap, trap, sleep, etc.
---
No matter the group composition, as a tank your job is to lead the group and give orders on what to do. Tanking mobs is the easy part or being a good tank.
---
And again...don't bother on AoE tanking. It is stupid and unnecessary. Look at your next pull, see which mobs hit harder...AND TANK THEM. Let the DPS and CC deal with the rest. They have to do their job also, which is not limited to doing damage only. CC and kiting and pet tanking and off tanking is widespread in Vanilla.
---
The two Centaur tribes in Desolace, but it's a shit quest chain and totally skippable anyway. Other than that, nothing much comes to mind. Ravenholdt/Syndicate is a rogue thing so maybe that's what you're thinking of, and again, rep rewards for those seemed lackluster.
---
MT means being more committed than most of your raid. It's a big ask.
---
Yeah, it's about ending of T2
---
ZG, AQ20 are designed for that very reason.
---
Because customet service employees know everything about the engineering/technical side of a side project right?
---
thanks for this, gonna listen to it at work!
---
What a beautiful zone to summon an infernal! 
---
&gt; Also I think in desolace you can loose or gain rep with different centaur tribes but don’t remember any particular reason why off the top of my head
---
That was blizzard first test of their factional system and the only difference between the two is the final quest rewards from the chain. 
---
Governments are well known for their virtue and incorruptibility   
---
Infernal + doomguard in Goldshire shows better your appreciation towards your fellow low level gamers.
---
Thank you for listening :)
---
If you have to tank more than 3 elites, your group must be retarded.
---
There is NO SCENARIO, EVER, when a tank HAVE to tank more than 3 elites, considering a proper pull. Even with a group of 4 warriors and 1 priest, you still DON'T HAVE to tank 5 elites. You can tank 3 elites , 2 Warriors will hamstring-kite 2 elites. And that is a group that have 4 Warriors, which is like...NEVER.
---
Seriously, there is no scenario where a tank have to tank more than 3 elites in Vanilla dungeons. Unless, ofc, a messed up pull of 2 groups of mobs. But that is an EXCEPTION, not a rule, so, it should even be mentioned.
---
no amount of panels (that are technically paywalled) will get the same amount of publicity as the original Chromie teaser that took them 30 minutes to put together.
---
I liked some of the more demonic elements of BC. It was in most zones, but to small degrees (aside from Netherstorm and Shadwmoon).
---
I played Legion two times, both for 1 month for a total of 2 months. That was enough to just make me sick of the overblown demon stylistic choices stupidly fast. I made a demon hunter at one point, and I didn't last 10 minutes, literally. While the DK tutorial was immersive and brilliant, the DK starting zone just felt like a copy paste of Shadowmoon's blight texture, arguably my least favorite zone in BC, but when the first real quest was an objective crammed into my quest log, I gave up.
---
It may not be as wholesome as Vanilla's charm and aesthetic, but it was still rooted in it, to me, anyways.
---
20 lvl. Poisons, lockpicking : 3
---
my warlock farming zg and bwl looked like such a hobo
---
Int is still sweet though! Holy Paladins are pretty sweet gear-wise, in that almost every stat you can use is at least useful, except Spirit. +healing, +sp crit%, +int are all pretty helpful stats. If you have a peice with 1% sp crit and +40 healing, an identical piece with +10 intellect is still a huge win.
---
Single, no kids, vacation saved and Ez 60. Here i come World of Warcraft. I'm gonna enjoy the shit out of you.
---
also in 2019, "this tank is fucking geared man he's in all blues". 
---
It's not a matter of long or short, it's a matter of the only source of +rep with the major factions being quests that can't be repeated. 
---
I see Ironfoe, i press like.
---
Yeah, try hamstring kiting in Scholomance with a 2.8 MH and 1.8 OH without totally gimping your DPS. 
---
Farm runs in Strat live, you fight bigger groups all the time for efficiency. Pull one pack of non elites + the elites of the pack + an abom + a ghoul and go to town. Use TC repeatedly to keep damage down and nuke everything. 
---
Not everbody plays My little Pony adventure in Azeroth but actually do stuff fast and brute force their way through dungeons by using - :O - abilities that allow you to jsut do that instead of fighting one elite at the time.
---
Wasn't there a hemo mace spec late vanilla? Though I'm pretty sure it was combat/sub focused and the assassination/sub was a dagger spec.
---
I cant go into specifics but I can give a general guide.  Melee classes depend on having multiple abilities at max rank FAR more than casters, For example as a mage you can skip about half your spells completely until you hit 60, compared to a warrior that really relies on having a full toolkit.  
---
Pet classes cost a little more than other classes, although hunters and locks are farming kings (no mount cost for lock either) so money should not really ever be an issue.
---
On top of training costs you also need to consider repair costs, something often forgotten but oh so costly as a melee as you level up.  
---
Almost every class has several abilities you can completely skip training until max level or at least until after the initial mount is purchased.
---
I really dont think this is worth taking into consideration when choosing a class to play, even if the difference was 50g, that is only an hour or so of grinding for any class at 60.
---
The "you think you do, but you don't" guy is in charge of the whole Blizzard now. Do you think he's passionate about Classic? Don't you think he'd be happy if Classic flopped and he'd be vindicated?
---
When the guy at the top is not passionate about the product, it's not going to get the resources and extra push that it needs.
---
For combat-mace spec very nice. Anyway, if it drop, why not? Tank pass it, casters and shaman no need it.
---
Tbh, i cant remember, but even with a start macro you should be in range of the mobs mid charge. 
---
Way longer, during Vanilla most people didn't even reach exalted with their own race at 60.  There is plenty of things wrong with Pservers. (/Sit to procc on Crit Abilities for example) It's the best you can get in the absence of Blizzard Classic servers. 
---
I've started playing on a private server recently after years of absence and noticed plenty of things wrong straight away. Some minor issues, some major issues &amp; some thing that are outright ridiculous.
---
Not going to happen. Unless also Blizz will have there values incorrect. That's going to be impossible. 
---
They have all the 1.12 data, including the database, which they recovered from a backup, according to what they claimed at blizzcon.
---
Hopefully they are able to get the weather effects implemented. They were non-functional as of the Classic demo.
---
Once again, Vanilla WoW still throws up stuff you never knew about 15 years later :)
---
&gt; if the difference was 50g, that is only an hour or so of grinding for any class at 60
---
But you need that gold *before* lvl 60, and since WoW doesn't have a bank that gives out loans, you're going to have to somehow actually earn it.
---
Having played through the vanilla leveling again over the past year, I can say that for rogue at least I had to choose what to train and purposefully leave out many spells. I couldn't just blindly train everything like in modern WoW.
---
It's not a huge deal, just another aspect of the game that you actually have to think about and plan a bit, rather than just blindly smash buttons.
---
I didn't say that. They are not 100% reliable, but unless I find other evidence, what they say is more probable to be true than the opposite.
---
Okay then, I must've missed it.
---
How do you define that? One of the media outlets i visit most often for example had the Chromie accouncement tucked away in a general Blizzcon article, while the Blizzcon panels and several Dev interviews had separate "In-Depth" news arcticles on them each time. 
---
This, basically. Vanilla tanking compared to retail tanking is orders of magnitude more complex. The limits of tanking in Vanilla require the ENTIRE group to use their BRAINS and abilities to make up for the limits that a tank have.
---
Rage starvation, initial threat, range kitting, CC (both pre-combat and in combat), pet off tanking, DPS kitting, fears, swapping weapons, changing stances, DPS off tanking (Warriors, Shamans, Druids, Rogues), gear usage, engineering trinkets / grenades...and the list continues.
---
Almost every single pull in Vanilla have a different approach.
---
...and people say Vanilla is easy. Those people clearly never, ever played it.
---
They stated they have the 1.12 client and server running so that they can quality check the new client and server accuracies. They do not have database data for every patch, but do have it for 1.12
---
Look at these bad boys I found in my mom's attic.
---
You must be stupid:)
---
Except they don't. Private server data shows that all of the guilds that cleared BWL only 15% cleared AQ40.
---
Fingers crossed :)
---
I watched and can't say i'm impressed, more or less half of it is him speculating again in his fake cynical attitude. The only real point he made that i actually found worth discussing is realm caps. As i do feel that having authentic realm caps will be very important. I don't know what it is with him, the more i watch him lately, the more fake he seems to get for me it seems. He just doesn't seem honest to me anymore. 
---
My current char is a druid, but I might migrate over to shaman at classic release after reading this comment...
---
On retail, when 10isch players report an enemy in rated bg. He gets disconected resulting in a 9vs10, wish is a win for sure.
---
The system is broken.
---
80% of your game time at lvl 60 will be spent on farming.
---
So, if you can raid 6 hrs/week, multiply that number with 4, and you will see how much time you will have to spend farming.
---
The answer is : roughly 24 hours/week.
---
Adding the 6 hrs of raiding, you are looking at 30 hrs/week game time. Which is like 4-5 hours/day. Also, add in like 2 hrs/day helping your guildmates doing dungeons, because IT MATTERS for the guild. So, you are looking at roughly 40+ hrs/week
---
If you think you can spend this much time in game, go be a Main Tank.
---
I bet u're fun at parties.
---
I usually play Horde on pserves, Warlocks are the only DPS class which is in demand in more established raiding guilds even though we tend to have more of them. It’s a good choice, a blast to level, good farming potential and one of the few classes where you can PvP and PvE with the same spec.
---
Hunter with skinning + alch sounds like a eazy leveler and good gold machine.
---
Same here but it would be nice if we got a definitive release date already because I can't hold off booking my long vacation forever at work.
---
That's when you leave and find another guild - one bad example doesn't make the system bad.
---
It is in the interest of the Officers to make the LC fair, otherwise, the guild will fall apart.
---
I have been in a guild that used DKP, where everyone saved for weapons and no one wanted to bid on other upgrades - so they were forced on people. Those people complained and that caused drama. No one wanted to spend DKP on a ring, when they could save for Ashkandi.
---
Also, the guy who ran the DKP website we had used to go emo about once a week, leave the guild and shut down the website until he got his way.  
---
Assuming you have a good LC, it remains the best way to distribute loot - if you don't have a good LC then the guild won't survive.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if Naxx hasn't even been released by Summer 2020. I suspect that when you come back Ony and MC will be puggable, many guilds will have BWL, ZG and AQ20 on farm, and the progression content will be AQ40. If you're already raid-ready before your hiatus you should be able to catch up a couple of raid tiers quickly.
---
One thing to consider is find your raid guild \*before\* your hiatus, and keep in contact with them on Discord or whatever during it, so that you have a smoother path back into the game when you're able to come back.
---
You're assuming he's actually thought this through. 
---
Which is why I am not planning to be MT, even though I like tanking, playing hard-to-level classes and being the most useful class possible. I just won't have the time to gear that much up and farm non-stop, so I'm gonna be healer instead.
---
&gt;  Im one of those no changes kinda guy!
---
[](https://old.reddit.com)
---
&gt; My suggestion: make all loot personal
---
kek
---
I think niche outlets with niche audiences would cover the panels in detail, but I browse a lot of very surface-level gaming outlets, and the most I ever saw about classic wow was a blurry screengrab of the release date.
---
Also worth mentioning - even if a major outlet had indeed covered the panel discussion, how many punters would read through an article that reads like a user installation guide compared with how many people would watch a trailer?
---
They are also part of a quest exclusive to Blacksmiths. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=5103
---
if u can jump through the rings of fire to even get invited in the first place
---
Once the good people got it first the bad will get it eventially. It should motivate people to do better aswell.
---
And a good student isn't just the best dps. Its the one always showing up, have suplies ready, comes with the right tallents etc.
---
These are things everyone is able to do no mather the skill level.
---
If your not able to do the things mentionst above because lack of time to gold farm, its only fair than others get it first.
---
Point is that dps isn't the main reason to priorotize players above others.
---
You will be fine
---
I used to have a janky chair and back problems, but invested in a DxRacing chair during last black friday. I understand that people hate on the "gaming" chair productification so I had my doubts whether it would improve my situation.  
---
But truth be told, it works for me. It's weighty, and feels very stable. Along with the back and neck supports it is very comfortable. My back and neck problems have lessened and I feel all around better.  
---
I'm not going to make a grand proclamation about the benefits of gaming chairs, however. Just because one works for me doesn't mean they work for everyone.
---
Looks dope, your mouse is a pro choice, as well ;d 
---
Socialism = personal loot.
---
Doesn't work.
---
Capitalism = work hard, get noticed, get loot.
---
Kinda stuck between Dwarf Priest or Troll Priest honestly.
---
My biggest hangup with Dwarfs is that I don't really imagine them being shadow priests that much, conceptually in terms of lore, and also in terms of their offensive animations etc. Something about Dwarves doesn't look very Shadow Priesty I dunno. 
---
Not that I wanna be a shadow priest but its a large part of the priest and its weird.
---
For Trolls I am not sure that the Priest Aesthetic works fully on them, in terms of gear. All the priest sets look like they're made for humans and a troll in them with something like Benediction just looks goofy IMO. 
---
One of the many Blacksmithing quests in the game. You can find info about this and the others here -&gt; [https://www.barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=1043#quest](https://www.barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=1043#quest)
---
Seeing as I am now a dad, work a fulltime job and generally have a lot less time on my hands to play WoW, I feel like choosing a class based on having less time to play.
---
I have always liked playing a shaman, but I fear that this class is more "raid-oriented" than for example a hunter. Seeing as I rarely will be able to raid, and have to play in shorter timespans, I feel like choosing a class based on this, and I think hunter seems like a lot of fun nonetheless. 
---
At the same time, I fear the whole "every DPSclass sucks but rouge, warr and mage"-meme has some merit to it.
---
My questions:
---
1. Is hunter really that horrible in classic, DPS-wise? Will I have trouble finding groups? In basic numbers, how big is the difference of a decent hunter and a decent rogue in a dungeon, for example?
---
2. Should I base my choice of class on how much time I have available to play? Warrior is, as I have heard, more dependant on other players to be good, while hunter, for example, is better at doing stuff solo. How big are these differences, really?
---
3. How will my life be if I roll a Resto Shaman, outside of raiding and dungeons? Will it take me a minute to kill a mob? 
---
RFC is so easy you don't really need a proper group composition to run it. If you have a shaman, Stoneskin Totem trivializes mobs' damage, and basically anyone can tank a mob there for the brief moment it takes to kill them.
---
It's doable if your guild either uses DKP or has a competent loot council. Paladins are better healers than druids and druids at least have solid T2 shoulders. The fact that Wild Growth Spaulders are leather and not plate doesn't really matter.
---
Right? I'm a teacher and I'm just hoping that it lands before September XD
---
Hated it so much... Started playing a private server after 10 years as a mage with the illusion I'll run around in full arcane and full netherwind. Eventually, I did, just not during raids...
---
It's interesting how in the first orchestral swell (after the repeat of the motif), the chord progression sounds exactly like the opening of the LotR main theme.
---
I have to decide until the end of May. I just hope there will be some news until then.
---
Everyone who did PvP knows about Tidal Charm. It's pretty much the most famous trinket in vanilla.
---
Dark and rainy dusk in STV = brick shittingly scary times.
---
Actually good tip right here, get up every now and then. I tend to stretch my legs / arms / back when im on FPs during long leveling / gaming sessions \^\^ When you get into the rhythm of doing this it actually feels better on your joints after a while. 
---
Im a tallboi btw so I have to look out for the back.  
---
People just want to play the game asap and ready to build up all kinds of optimistic theories, including myself.
---
I do agree that in this case beta is not that much of 
---
 necessary thing, considering that they have a perfectly running 1.12 client as a reference which simplifies the task drastically. 
---
Moreover, public beta run means costs. And it seems that Blizzard is not doing great financially either. 
---
However, there is one "but", and it is called stress testing. With all the classic hype and solutions like sharding, they would likely want to test it out on a bigger scale. But I would not call it "beta test" whatsoever.
---
I think 29/11/11 is way better
---
Feral charge helps a lot in PvP, and I'm not even talking about the interrupt part, but the mobility. When you are being zerged you can feral charge to someone else, even an enemy totem or a critter, and you can procceed to kite.
---
You won't be able to travel form if you are being zerged and slowed constantly.
---
You laugh now but he's on a fast track to an Activision internship with these ground breaking solutions.
---
Well, it's not "earned" if it's heritage is it?
---
All of the hype ran out for the most successful MMO of all time.  Guess myself and 4 other people will be the only ones playing.  :(
---
Agreed, although it depends on your tank gear, your healers and what boss you're fighting. You'll want TC during progress raids on hard hitting bosses such as Broodlord, Chromaggus, Nefarian etc.
---
The wait is agonising. Starting Monday I’ve got 6 months training at a new job and leave requests will be instantly denied. A September/October release would be the tits.
---
I was running an AMD Athlon 64 3500 back then, with dual GT 6800's and twin WD Raptors in Raid0. It was an OG Alienware, before Dell bought them.
---
You still couldn't do a decent job recording with FRAPS while playing, even with that monster. 
---
Thanks for the reply, im only curious about the total cost though, it wont affect my class choice. 
---
There may be a Beta, there may be no Beta. There may be a short Beta. There may be instant 60 for testing etc. Noone knows.
---
What I'm pretty sure about is there will be no Alpha.
---
Competent loot council still gives them to the druid since it's bis for them as well and that way plate intellect gear won't get scrapped. It benefits the raid as a whole more.
---
your'e so right. sure bringing up these points over and over is obnoxious, but I guarantee that if the community goes silent about (X subject), then blizz will not treat (X subject) as an issue.
---
Mate, I've had to put my master's on hold for a year due to mouse-arm problems in both arms. What I've learned (for me specifically) and what I would recommend to others is the following.
---
Get the blood flowing. Stretch those arms. Stretch those shoulders. Massage your neck with a ball on the ground or a foam roller. Massage your shoulders with a ball between you and a wall. Swing your arms so the blood starts running down to your finger tips and they feel a bit funny. Swing them horizontally. Swing them vertically. Swing both arms the same way. Swing them the opposite way so you stretch your chest and back. This might sound like a lot of work, but I do this every day for 1-3 times. Sometimes for 5 minutes. Sometimes for 15 minutes if I'm watching something. It's a great coping strategy that'll relieve some stress instantly.
---
Also, do sports where you stop thinking about these complaints. I used to do running and basketball. Now that I'm more confident in controlling my complaints, believe it or not, I now practice a lot of climbing/bouldering (would have never thought I would practice this sport with my complaints). Just do sports that you enjoy and distract you from feeling weird stuff in your hands/arms/fingers.
---
Also, if you're experiencing tingles and soreness, the most important lesson I've learned after having different types of therapy is: do not stress about it. Stress is one of the factors that increases and causes these complaints. Learn to talk to yourself whenever you're having complaints. My mantra was and is: "It's just tingles. Don't worry about it. I'll go for a walk, stretch, and it'll be over soon. I'm fine and I will be fine." 
---
Stressing out about my complaints was what fucked me over really hard and this advice has helped me the most. Why? Because it re-inforces and starts a weird cycle of tingles, which can be the result of too much computer work, but can also be your body saying: I'm stressed out. Stressing out more and getting anxious will give you more tingles, and after a while you won't know if the tingles are caused by your anxiety or your overworked arms/fingers.
---
This also goes hand in hand with learning to make rational decisions: if you're feeling pain , don't stress out about it, but do make a decision: I'll finish this now and take a long break. Or: I'm not enjoying this now, I'll take a break now. Tomorrow there'll be more time to play WoW.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Yes it is. Infact, its the most effective threat talent if going by threat-per-rage.
---
I can't wait to play Wailing Caverns again. I remember getting excited about the Savory Deviate Delight dropping. One of my favorite memories from vanilla. 
---
With engineering shield and a few seconds head start you will.
---
This just reminds me of Vurtne's PvP videos.  Literally my childhood hero.
---
Ikea Markus ftw.
---
Mathematically you'll complete 1 TF every 6 months. Assuming Bindings wont be on the loot table until BWL is released (due to elementium ores) I think more like 1-2 TFs by the time of AQ release.
---
Don never got his before he quit, and then they finish 2x TFs in the course of one raid ID after Naxx was cleared.
---
Sad.
---
1. At the first stages of the game, namely MC and early-mid BWL hunter does absolutely fine DPS-wise. Also, the damage is always fine in dungeons. Hunter just does not scale with gear that well as other classes do. However, keep in mind that hunter is one of the most popular classes and does not really bring a lot of neat utility like mages and warlocks do, so prepare for competition. 
---
2. Imo, no. You should play the class and role which appeals to you the most while keeping some meta things in mind (Like your chances to become a boomkin raider are very low, and so on). Hunters are indeed good at soloing stuff, but on the other hand it is **World** of Warcraft, so why would you play something solo-oriented? Being dependant in classic is something what creates bonds between players. 
---
3. It will be fine, there are decent hybrid elem/resto specs, which would allow you to raid (Assuming RL is okay with the thing that you don't have mana tide totem, and usually they are okay if your guild is not progressing atm) and kill stuff in solo. And elemental shaman burst damage is not a joke.
---
Deadmines. I like doing the pulls at the ship, double-poly on the goblin robot-makers.
---
That's harsh man... I just started this new job in last December but my only restriction is that I can't take day offs until my probation is over so I will be good to go from March.
---
That is correct, although you get diminishing returns with many mobs since the threat is split among the targets. Basically, 3-5 mobs BS is king but past 5 mobs, demoshout gets better threat-per-mob.
---
Maraudon weirdly.
---
Oddly though despite doing up to aq40 on a hunter I just cannot remember scholomance at ALL
---
Anyway also UBRS and BRD
---
Raids bwl and aq40 😍
---
Tldr 
---
Please be less butthurt and focus on the game. Not reddit 
---
Ok downvoted it as you said. 
---
You can conceptualize a troll vodoo shaman as a shaman who is a partner of the elements, a mage who has arcane knowledge (that the other tribesman don't have) or a priest worshiping some dark deity. Either one fits in my opinion.
---
I’m willing to take it on the chin though, dream job, Passenger Train Driver. Waited a damn long time for all the pieces to fall into place and ate a lot of shit sandwiches along the way.
---
If WoW releases before training is finished I’ll find a way!
---
Multi shot does more damage than arcane shot?
---
No No NO No no. Don't  even try and say that ninja looting is in the same moral territory as corpse camping. It's certainly not against ToS and isn't ban-worty behavior, and it shouldn't be, the community sorts itself out with these types of things. Like the end of this video implies, I doubt this guy ever raided again on this server with this toon. That being said, corpse camping is not even close to a comparable situation. I shouldn't  even have to explain that. You are straight up glorifying the existence of ninja looters. What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
Brd for me :) cant wait for the 100 hour full clear run :P
---
Blackwing Lair
---
I always set an alarm at 01:00 and played till 05:00 and went to bed before my mom woke up. Than faked going to school untill my wow went to work. Go back in the house and play all day. Than before mom arives I went out. Waited till the propper time to go back in the house, greet my mom and went back to wow.
---
I tought myself to life without sleep and now 10 years later I still sleep between 4 and 6 hours.
---
I always feel like shit tho. Worth it.
---
cant decide between human or undead rogue. 
---
human:
---
- i like the outer appearance of humans more
---
- i like sw / if more than og / uc
---
- i love leveling area of alliance (elwynn, loch modan ...)
---
undead:
---
- best racial for pvp (i pvp a lot)
---
- horde has my favorite mount (frostwolf)
---
Hey! I have commented on a few of your videos in the past, I just want to say thank you again and please keep uploading :)
---
nice contribution to the discussion
---
&gt; Please be less butthurt and focus on the game.
---
kinda hard to do that when the game isn't out buddy
---
Im preatty sure ( withought having any proof or done any reserch ) that this was a feature that was more used in TBC than in classic. The only time im sure it was used in classic was in the centaur clans. Im preatty sure there were a few more in tbc.
---
I'm with you on that. Stress testing is much more likely than a beta.
---
You're in classic wow, are you talking about the BlizzCon demo that ended ages ago? 
---
Who says they will do a beta where you test EVERYTHING ? Im sure they will do a open beta, just to stress test their chosen type of server, phase/no phase, max cap start areas, login and que systems etc. Other than that, its a complete game with some database transfers and modifications. 
---
Not a fucking new AAA-game.
---
&gt; Noone knows.
---
exactly, so why are select people here so confident there will be one?
---
Thottbot wasn't 100% accurate and also could have had outdated pre-1.12.1 information.
---
decent points, but it'd still be a shame to find bugs due to the lack of testing.
---
I agree with people saying they are more likely to stress test rather than holding an actual beta.
---
That's no where NEAR possible
---
Can't wait for the smug pricks to be knocked off their high horses
---
Edge masters???
---
Loot council was great for 10mans back in Cata, since you're a tight knight group there isn't much complaining. Too bad our warlock officer decided to jump ship after he got his BiS items + legendary staff. Last straw for me in trusting people online, specially when my gf as the guild leader didn't want to be seen as the one taking the legendary to herself just because she was the leader.
---
I’m currently using a noblechair Icon. It’s a good solid chair that I’ve had no issues with.
---
You spoiled yourself with ps's. I've been waiting for many years and the hype keeps growing. All my effort is going into convinsing friends to play aswell.
---
Happy to find passionate people like I am :)  
---
A thank you from all my heart.  
---
Maybe he is playing on a private server? Anyways. wrong place to ask :P
---
Coming up soon :D
---
I dinged 40 back in the day on my hunter in SM had about 10g at the time, messaged my 60 druid cousin in game to ask how I get a mount, of course he asked how much gold I had, lets just say I got lucky here... he rode to SM and gave me 90g to get my mount.
---
Wish I still had the screenshot I took on my mount by the mount vendor in Darnassus!
---
Yeah that's why I asked if they meant the demo, figured he wouldn't be daft enough to ask here about why the private server disconnects him. :p
---
Sunken Temple!
---
Mind helping me out with shaman leveling? Feels like I nees most of my spells.
---
Yes, someone else commented on the channel, how at the beginning everyone jumped like "it's LotR music" and now it's common knowledge that this is "WoW music". :)
---
Dont base on will of forsaken. Id go with human in your case as its 3 pros vs 1 pro of Horde.
---
Humans have Perception with which you could beat any rogue as you will detect first.  Cleansing one fear from lock wont help as much as destroying every rogue. Also I'm not sure if you can touch Spriest so you are basically going for that cleanse vs holy priests WHILE losing on killing every "PvP fanboy superstar undead rogue".  
---
Why not undead priest? Shadow suits them best by far.
---
Are there cloth turn ins for Night Elves? If yes, and assuming they will be in with launch then if you keep killing grey mobs and farm insane amounts of cloth (under or at 40) you could in theory achieve it lol.
---
Masters of the edge.
---
&gt; Method is committed to support Esfand as a content creator. You will see many collaborations at upcoming conventions, at Method events and of course in WoW Classic which is scheduled for release this summer.  
---
If you actually read the article, you'll see that he has joined as a content creator, not as a raider.
---
On the one hand I'm so happy I'm not the same person I was back when I straight up no lifed Vanilla.
---
On the other hand I want to be that person again.
---
Same but many people have said September unfortunately. I’m hoping for June. 
---
The way we torment ourselfs, waiting in agony for Classic, I’d say most in this sub like SM...
---
And big daddy Vek'lor.
---
&gt; FFXIV is one of the success stories, definitely, and a very good game.
---
When the new dev team took over the disaster that was original launch, The head guy made everyone play WoW to see what a good MMO was, compared to what they had. if i recall 100%
---
Thanks man, good points. I think we would go for Warlock + Mage or even double Mages but I really like to heal. Actually I like both heal and dps thats why Spriest sounds best fit for me. Even during TBC PvP I rolled those shockadin and simillar things, even trying to get the tanking part in there somehow (thus why plate wearer). Too bad I want it all. 
---
But nice stuff. I think I could go actually with affliction warlock as I like dot dps, also I can self heal a lot with drain life and healtstones. That would be the biggest stretch I could do.  
---
What about you? Any ideas, going solo or with someone?  
---
What country if you don’t mind my asking?
---
You practice taking concussive force to the head twice a week.  It really shows through your opinions of others.
---
I play football, not hand egg. 
---
That's unfortunate! But thanks for the heads up, I thought more about low level dungeons, like Deadmines or  Shadowfang Keep when we are few levels above mobs. Eg: Deadmines is avrg. 18/19lvl mobs while we are 22 or so (so they are green). 
---
Still, craving is there to try and we definitely will. Maybe finding a third would make it possible, who knows!
---
?????
---
What are you rambling on about? What gave you the impression to make you labor under the delusion that anyone is "straight up glorifying the existence of ninja looters?"
---
Do locks have a hard time getting into raids later on? I've heard that people start taking more mages and less locks later in vanilla. I'm really torn between the two. I'm leaning more toward lock though. I don't really care about best top dps. I just want to get invited to raids.
---
Live to win man.
---
Okay thats quality info! Thanks a lot but we wont rush it or anything just try all the crazy stuff that are on border of impossible. Warlock and mage could do the same, right? Rain of fire or whats the spell called? :)
---
Scarlet Monastery (Cathedral)!
---
I’ve never had that problem with loot council. That’s a guild issue and not the system. 
---
Except when people stop taking upgrades to horde points for that one item that may never drop.
---
&gt; And then were was some Korean shit MMO that was basically RNG:The Game.
---
Ah, Korean MMO#20.. or was it #21? They all blend together so nicely that it's hard to really tell them apart. :x
---
I appreciate Undead for sure, but not going for shadow mainly, just that I have it in mind. They seem a bit overplayed IMO. 
---
June would be a nightmare for me
---
Ah I see. So only way we could possibly pull that out is going Warlock and Mage, send VW to tank one mob, polymorph other mob, and fear third while we dps 4th (or third if we manage to smart pull or whatever the dungeon is), still seems like super clutch thing to do.
---
Having third would help so much
---
&gt; You are the one that said you would love opinions. Being passive agressive makes you look cool though. I get it.
---
&gt;You sound like a baddie. Not trying to make it personal. But you also sound like a liberal cuck.
---
&gt;You are the type of person that will make ppl stop reading this sub lol.
---
Isn't it lovely when a post writes itself?
---
Yeah I get it. And I also get that having third would help 10 times in clear and overall difficulty
---
srsly, every class can raid. it depends more on how good you can play your class. i would never chose a class on how high the percentage of raid participation is.
---
True that, they are overplayed. 
---
Okay I think I am in same boat with you, but I don't wanna go horde and dwarf is a total miss for me in points you mentioned. Ill go human most probably, they have best spirit in game and animations are on point.
---
&gt;because others were saying they did it on pservers. :/
---
Most people who played on pservers never played on retail classic back in the day, they're just assuming that it's identical. They don't realise just how different a lot of things were.
---
I think mages are preferred of all spell-casters, locks are second. But hey if it means anything I heard locks are insane in naxx (naxx equipped) and do not lose any damage compared to mages. There is also a lot of talk of having 5-10 locks in raids and one Spriest to buff their dmg by 15% so they are primary dmg source. They are viable for sure but who knows what min-maxers will tell us/or how they will ruin experience cause of .23sec faster boss kill.   
---
Another note: Utility is very important thing, locks are must in most raids as you can summon people, make healthstones etc. So overall you shouldn't worry about spots, what you will experience probably is some mage getting priority on a staff or whatever cause he does few % more dmg than you. 
---
I thought of rolling lock but my wife will roll one and all I can say is so should you.
---
Why thou? They are created for gamers to play games in. Sure a 30k office chair is going to be better, but the memory foam + back pillow helps alot and they are comfy to sit on for long period of times. And the pricetagg is usually between a crappy IKEA chair and an expensive office chair. Ive used 2 different ones for about 10ish years and i have no problem at all with my back anymore. I would say the back pillow helped me not hunching forward and i actually like it that way, even at work, on the buss etc.
---
I hope for that too, even though there was no weather effects in WoW on launch day.
---
BiS/Really good gauntlets that give weapon skill for warriors.
---
there was one in that hidden demon area, wasn't there?
---
Well, "Amberhorn" could refer to both Druids and demons, so...
---
Yes but no you couldn't. I don't think I EVER got exalted with my own faction in vanilla.
---
I plan to roll a undead warrior, but can’t decide what professions to choose. Ideally i would like Mining/Engineering or possibly Herb/Alchemy
---
Though I will be playing casually and want to try out a build using the Arcanite Champion from Swordsmithing.  
---
But i fear no one on Horde will be taking that blacksmithing specialization, due to Arcanite Reaper and Sulfuron Hammer being much more popular and sought after options from Axe and Mace smithing.
---
Sorry for the rant, but my question is~ should i take up mining and Swordsmithing and craft it for myself, and then possibly drop Blacksmithing for Engineering or another profession?
---
Lol wtf is this picture :D 
---
Congrats to you man, proud for you. 
---
Literally all of them... except Mauradon... fuck Mauradon 
---
But think of all the new best friends you will make!
---
Gettin that atiesh boys, night matter how long it takes
---
If you're month or two late to the party, you won't miss really anything 
---
I've never seen this video, but regarding the first part I just wonder how the hell is that even possible! Kinda makes me want to play rogue. However I did notice not taking on any paladin. 
---
Either go for a Herman Miller or a Steelcase chair imo. They offer alot of customisation and help your back staying in form and they last quite long so you can get them as used good.
---
Check https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/
---
Or https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/#steelcase-seating-difference
---
I would suggest a Leap 2 off Steelcase, awesome chair!
---
fgjkhfghjdfjhg MAN THANKS FOR YOUR WORDS. Wow Classic is coming, we have to live it again. I'm really glad to wake up those feels in some of you guys.
---
My next pixel will be Arcanite Reaper. I never had it :&lt;
---
I'm socially equipped. I'll make new friends.
---
&gt; I want to be able to walk into a place, ask to speak with the manager, and just ask if they would consider looking at my CV.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; However, what with the state of the world, with a bunch of people that disregard other peoples lives and hurt others etc, there's worries about security.
---
&gt; Another thing is the lack of jobs.
---
the weirdest thing is that unless the manager wants you personally, like you are handsome and he's gay or something, then you have quite no chance. 
---
And the even more weird thing, is that in such world, by logic, there should be only a small percentage of people that make it into proper adulthood - heavy natural selection. Because every job offer gets 1000 responses, and there are only 100 offers. That would mean the other 900 would remain unemployed, and eventually run out of funds. And, I don't hear about 90% of people being homeless, or dying to hunger...
---
Anyway, today it feels like nobody cares, it's your problem, etc. If you are unemployed, it's your fault and everyone will do their best to punish you for that. Back then, such attitude was presented only towards drunk/addicted beggars.
---
Another thing is that one person works 2.5 full times, and pays shitloads of taxes for all others' unemployment benefits. And, he is mad at you that you are "stealing his money", instead of apologizing for stealing your job. Maybe there should be some restriction on the max amount of jobs one can have?
---
I would call warrior leveling (at least solo) tedious and time-consuming more than hard. Because you have no self-healing, limited utility and are rage-dependant, you pretty much have to go mob per mob more than any other class prior to max level. Two mobs is a knife's edge that you can still pull off if you have sufficient gear. Three mobs is a guaranteed suicide mission. You also have to eat after every pull because if you're not full health you'll probably end up dying on the next one. 
---
Rage generation below level 30 is a pain in the ass. Damage dealt barely generates any rage, and while from damage taken is higher it's irrelevant because the damage you can tank without a healer covering you is not nearly enough to get a steady rage generation. Which means you'll end up dying even with increased rage gen, making slow and steady the only option. This means that you'll spend about half of your time just auto-attacking. 
---
What makes warrior leveling even worse is that it's one of the most gear-dependant classes in vanilla. A good green or blue can get you a long way, but as soon as your gear starts falling behind you'll have problems even killing a single mob, let alone two.
---
All in all warrior leveling is not hard, just boring. Not as boring as Paladin, but it's close. Ironically you roll a warrior because you want to feel like an unkillable tank of doom, but you end up having to be one of the most careful levelers in the game. Getting a vanilla warrior to 60 has been one of the most harrowing experiences of my WoW career.
---
Back in vanilla, cheap shot, kidney shot had seperate diminishing returns, sap also lasted a very long time, allowing the diminishing return of cheap shot/kidney shot to reset.
---
Eviscerate also had static damage, so it didn't really matter if he had gear or not when eviscerate crits is what he relied on to kill his opponents.
---
Also preparation which was a 10 minute cooldown, which allowed you to reset the cooldown of vanish, cold blood, sprint, evasion etc, essentially all the rogue cooldowns.
---
The stun you see when he is naked, is essentially a recipe to pretty much guarantees a kill, unless, of course you have an ability to break out of it, such as paladin shield, which is why you don't see them :) 
---
That place was a godsend to rogues.
---
r/iamverybadass
---
Yeah, they are all good! 
---
I remember I was waiting for episode 1 to be released, there was a lot of forum drama on the Arthas realm forums in the lead up to the release. I remember a particular level 49 twink priest, commenting and claiming that Mute could never kill rank 14 opponents naked, and that all the fights were staged.
---
I honestly don't have a clue why I hate it so much. I think it's probably because I've been through it like a million times. It seems that even now, on current wow, you seem to get dropped into this dungeon EVERY time you queue for a random dungeon between 38-50 ish.
---
Locks can, I have also heard druids can but don't know much about it.
---
Luckily for you there are no random dungeons in classic ;)
---
I may try it when I get to 60 as a hunter. But I really cannot be bothered with it either.
---
I know :D ZF here I come! 
---
That's another thing. This brings weird political situations, such as 37% votes for antisemitic party party, and not because people are racist, but because people want closed borders.
---
Same.
---
You know how memories just sort of get trapped in your head and certain things trigger them?
---
Whenever I hear Jimi Hendrix I get flashbacks to playing my rogue in Wailing Caverns and the Barrens because I would just listen to those songs on repeat during that time.
---
Just ignore armor penetration bullshit
---
most current blizzard employees are newfegs who didnt even work there when wow was a thing so probably have no idea about anything related to it
---
&gt; Venture Co dungeon in Mulgore =)
---
look, there are two blue dots on the map, but only one dungeon name.
---
The one in Mulgore is red.
---
Don't actually remember dinging 40, but I remember borrowing about 40g from my brother to get my mount. He more or less quit at that point (with a short visit back when tbc released) so I don't think I ever payed him back.
---
I'll be horde.
---
I want a strong 1v1 pvp class that won't be terrible to level. I'm debating warlock or rogue. I would likely pick whatever is the least pop. If asusme lock. But lock is pretty damn great and people seem to have realised that.. 
---
You're not making any sense. Cya.
---
I just logged into Blizzard chat for the first time in 6 years and my friends are still there &lt;3
---
(When you pretend you didn't just pick up that gear upgrade because the one you're wearing kind of matches.)
---
I'm not 100% on the details but this was definitely a thing in retail.  Some recollections/ observations:
---
To the best of my recollection, having leveled to 60 7 times during the original, and puttered around on pservers to the 40s a few times, the points at which you hit honored/ revered are very similar. Obviously this is fuzzy but that's my informed but unscientific experience.
---
Many people needed seasonal quests to do this.  In particular the lunar festival gave generous rep I believe- hunting down the elders gave 50 with all city factions per turn in iirc. 
---
There was a forum post or guide of some sort that detailed the route taken to become darnassus exalted through questing.  It required a very inefficient questing process to ensure no quest that gave darnassus rep become grey.  It also wasn't remotely feasible by 40.  This was also possibly before bgs - I think the pvp quests gave rep and it was added to get rep from killing City bosses.  Of course things were also being tweaked throughout vanilla.  The biggest difference on pservers I believe is not that values are wrong but that the world exists mostly as 1.12 (with the exception of raids) which has a full complement of quests and it's own values for everything.
---
Of course at the time I could give 2 craps about rep and didn't pay too much attention to it (besides honored for the discount) so it's all just incidental and I could easily be wrong about any number of things.  But that's half the fun of the speculation isn't it!
---
Do note that private server resources aren't always relevant to the actual game. Not saying that this one might not be accurate but a lot of information out there is only relevant to private servers where a lot of things are off.
---
you are straight up discribing a warrior. no other class fits your description really.
---
&gt;1. I like dynamic (but not tedious) gameplay.
---
check. 
---
&gt;2. Shiny weapons. Getting that next "weapon" is one of my pulls that keeps me playing.
---
check
---
&gt;3. I enjoy being useful in a group.
---
check. offtanking when needed, or taunting off, battle shout buff, or piercing howl kiting to save the day. high dps. (better than rogues). and obviously you are super useful if you tank in 5man at least.
---
&gt;4. I also like having the ability of doing lots of damage.
---
check, fwars top dps.
---
&gt; 5.  I don't care much about PvP but will dabble in it.
---
check. get some op 2h from raids, go reck ppl in pvp.
---
&gt; 6. I will be doing every dungeon while leveling, but I have a limited play span (10-15 hours a week) and I don't want to take 6 months to level.
---
check. doing every dungeon while leveling is easier as a warrior, cos its easier as a tank (you tank in dps spec while leveling ofc). On top of easy groups, as a tank you control group passing and what to do and to what speed, so you control your own time played.
---
basically as a warrior you reduce your time of forming a group drastically, and waiting both while leveling and at 60. for instance as a rogue its a pain to find a group.
---
&gt;7. Class fantasy is mostly a non-issue (other than 2 classes stated below).
---
check.
---
~ 
---
&gt; Cons - leveling is slow and boring, gear dependent at max level.
---
leveling is abit slower, compared to speedrun classes, but if you know what you are doing, its not THAT slow. its like 1+ additional day played. And definitely not boring if you know how to approach it.  
---
Also since you plan on doing every dungeon it will be way faster to find/form a group, as a warrior than a hunter, for instance. We don't know what server pop structure gonna be, but you literally can spend hours looking for a group and finding a tank for some dungeon. and then this tank dc or quit mid run.
---
when you are tanking yourself you eliminate this. and if you a lucky to have another tank you happily dps. 
---
About leveling warriors, I highly suggest you to check these two videos. you'll change your mind. pulling multiple mobs sweeping striking is entertaining. and hamstring hit kiting if needed and so on.
---
[monkeys warrior elwynn speed run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPBsAyzuZgM). 
---
and [Kargoz warrior leveling video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxX1WQILnM)
---
I care
---
Ravenholdt / Syndicate, Bloodsail / Booty Bay and Magram / Gelkis are the factions where gaining rep with one causes you to lose rep with the other in most but not all cases I think.
---
There was no 16 debuff slot, no 1.12 talents, no lots of things on launch day. Some items even got visual improvements like the Obsidian Edged Blade and tier 2 sets.
---
All of that is expected to be finished by launch. If there are no weather effects the only reason will be because Activision Blizzard didn't put the resources into developing them for the Legion client.
---
Ahh!
---
GDC 2019 - 18th March 2019 
---
PAX East -  28th March 2019 
---
Maybe GDC, if they can lock down the release date before that.
---
I'm excited to do that one pull before the bridge leading up to drakisath in UBRS. So many wipes due to that pull.
---
Oh man I have a bunch of albums like that. Listening to them takes me right back. 
---
Right, I was leveling my first human warlock.
---
I started to create my character late evening. So many options, it took a lot of time. When I was finished, it was time to sleep, school tomorrow.
---
Back from school, I clicked that "Enter World" button - sunny, green fields, with this soothing music. Some wolves here and there, some bandits, but generally things felt peaceful. Some woman growing grapes, some growing pumpkins. Also, in real world, it was the first sunny day of winter. This is how "human" vibe would feel for me from now.
---
Then, I stopped playing for the day. I wanted to return as soon as I could - luckily, it was Friday, so I could just wake up at Saturday morning, and return. But, on Saturday, the weather outside wasn't that good - it was cloudy and raining. Since I had no courtains back then, I felt "good, no sun on the screen". Unfortunately, when I logged into the game, the vibe was completely different. Everything was gray, and it was raining. Everything was so sad. 
---
But then, I made it to Westfall. Praise the Sun! Beautiful, cloudless, orangish sunset. But, it was still sad, as people were very poor and eating "leather shoe soup".
---
I remember very little about it, but I think I got the mount at 40 or 41 at the latest. There wasn't much of a 31 pointer to look forward to as a Fire Mage, since the old Combustion wasn't very spectacular. 
---
I remember jumping to the Arcane tree really early on because I wanted PoM. My leveling build was 28/23, because I put my money on crit being a valuable stat to have (3% from Arcane Instability, 6% from Critical Mass). I actually skipped Blast Wave, because the numbers seemed really unimpressive and I didn't realise there would be higher levels of that spell. Obviously not a spec I would recommend leveling with, but having PoM early on was pretty cool.
---
Same here, I need to know at least 4 months prior. And even then I have to be lucky nobody else blocked holidays within the release timespan...
---
I‘m praying daily, please rng-sus, I know it‘s not your usual field of work but DO SOMETHING for all of us.
---
&gt;I posted saying something to the effect that I knew human players didn't even get Exalted with Stormwind upon reaching level 60 in Vanilla
---
I wasn't even Revered - I remember being at some 20s and hitting Honored, and feeling high-level.
---
I’ve already booked July 16th off and plan to move the holiday if they announce a different release date 
---
My argument applies to both Classic and Retail alike, they have the money to put GM's where they need to, they just don't because they'd rather save money by making things like this automated than pay people any amount of money to provide a quality experience. 
---
i really wanna take 2 weeks off for work. already replayed to 60 on the best vanilla classic p servers using both factions. im ready for a /played of 5 days. 
---
r/iamverysalty
---
Maybe. It would probably be fun to be there at ground zero with all the people who've never experienced vanilla before. 
---
BRD, BRD and BRD again. And that long corpse runs when you wipe.
---
And oh, Maraudon. I loved the last, bluish part, which was so pure and uncorrupted...
---
and, at some part of the year, it had an Elder NPC there, and after an of completing his quest, I got a mail with an item that would make similar glow.
---
Yeah, I think we a know this. It's just that we know they dont care so we're trying to make the best of the situation
---
Because every blizzard product in the past 20 years have had a beta.
---
I will never forget that guy from Band of Brothers.

&gt;Wasn't there a hemo mace spec late vanilla? 
---
I don't remember that being a thing until patch 2.0 as you have to sacrifice too many +damage talents with vanilla talents to make it worth while (stun locks don't mean much if you can't burn down your opponent by the time they wear off). 
---
Another key change was, in 2.0, literally anyone co could get Rank 14 maces, which were bis at the time (and other maces were either hard to come by or not worth it). 
---
Every single Blizz game pass I wanna say WoW had beta. Not sure about W3 tbh.
---
Pserver folks are going to lose their minds. Gonna be fun to watch
---
I have 100% confidence in there being a beta.
---
I never played Rogue during vanilla. I played Paladin during vanilla and never had to much trouble in a 1v1 with a rogue. And therefore I always thought them to be weaker as a class then Paladin so why change. I now understand why. Got to say I was a kid back then. 
---
I always envied the people playing Shaman tho. Every time I met one of those I died. But also I did not consider changing because that would mean changing server and faction. And I would lose all my friends.

but the content was not illegal. Even though an illegitimate version of the game was used to make it, the streamer did nothing wrong, apart from breaking the **Blizzard's EULA** for connecting to private servers.

He even **had the license to run World of Warcraft**, so he **didn't pirate** it or anything.

---
I believe so. Aggro might be tricky if they pull onto the warlock, but with the right timing, I’m sure it’s possible 
---
"Wouldn't" isn't the right word, it's more like "couldn't". Master loot was bugged for a loooong time after vanilla launched. #nochanges
---
&gt;Notice the rep gains are double for ClassicDB, the private server data.
---
Not every private server uses the database found on that website btw.
---
When it comes to values in general though, private servers are wrong when it comes to mob stats, drop rates, quest rewards (rep and XP) for MOST but not all mobs / quests etc. Some stuff can and have been researched but not every aspect of the game has been documented so there's not a lot to work with tbh.
---
Australia 
---
&gt;Yeah, I think we a know this
---
Some do for sure, but I'm seeing a lot of comments that aren't quite hitting the nail on the head. Some people are blaming "sjw culture" or, in the case of this particular comment thread people think it's a lack of funds but I don't believe that to be the case. To me, it's obvious that this is just some billion dollar company trying to cut corners to make more money and that's what I'm trying to shine light on. 
---
As for making the best of the situation, yea, I agree, that's about all we can do at this point (unfortunately). 
---
&gt; If they do not release a beta by May, then there is no point holding a beta whatsoever
---
This is objectively not true.
---
Me watching this back in the day: "hahaha yeaah show him who's the boss!! Badass!!"  
---
Me now: "how the fuck is he not getting fired?"
---
Did something like the 16th slip anywhere? Or is that just your precaucious assumption?
---
[Real examples from Retail.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/an0dxc/blizzard_has_dropped_the_ball_on_the_new_report/) No one responsible for those reports has been banned.

It's cool to lord over the issue and dismiss everyone's concerns if they aren't realistic. That's not what's happening. 
---
Yes it’s the unofficial release date based on some Easter eggs during the blizzcon 2018. This site explains it. 
---
https://wowclassiccountdown.com
---
I believe we'll get more information regarding Classic SOON as what little buzz surrounding the latest WoW raid is about to dwindle real soon if it hasn't already..Classic news could carry them until the next retail patch at the very least.
---
I think we all share this feel, friend.
---
Hitting Lvl 40 back then was all about trying to figure out by what level I could afford my mount. Lmao.
---
Cath cath cath!!!
---
Most places are pretty relaxed with that 'INSTANTLY DENIED' policy.  It's just written so they can if they need to.
---
I'm sure if you are there for 5 months and doing great and ask for a day off they will let you.  
---
If they don't look for a job somewhere else, lol.
---
Play all classes. 
---
Yuck. Did it twice yesterday that’s enough for a lifetimes 
---
Warlock 
---
2 buffs (trash buffs) 
---
1 self buff 
---
2 healthstone (create &amp; use) 
---
2 soulstone (create &amp; use) 
---
4 demons 
---
3 drain spelles  (life, soul &amp; mana) 
---
2 aoe dmg spells 
---
9 curses 
---
1 shadowbolt 
---
1 death coil  
---
2 fears (single target and aoe) 
---
1 shadowburn 
---
1 soulfire 
---
I'm probably forgetting some spells as well. 
---
Lol I remember the first and second time I turned cloth in. The first time I was like sweet I got pretty good experience. And the next time I only got rep, and maybe a tiny bit or zero exp. I felt so ripped off. Worst trade deal, maybe ever.
---
## Zul'Farrak
---
nice, thank you :)
---
Last time I did a warrior I hardly trained up the ranks of my stuff. There are alot of small differences prior to getting lvl 60 gear. Where its like Heroic Strike - hits for normal damage Plus 5, and the next rank is plus 9 ... I actually didn't take the time to look up the values but that is precisely the small amount I am talking about. Where as a Mage is going to be like Rank 3 to Rank 4 is going to add some 80 damage per fireball.
---
Not really, there's no non-tier plate healing shoulder piece until AQ40. If we're talking about scrapping T1 or T2 shoulders, you are more likely to have to scrap them because you gave the Wild Growth Spaulders to a druid. You will likely have around 5-6 paladins but probably only 2-3 druids. This means that if 1 druid gets the WGS, any druid tier shoulders after the first one or two drop will get scrapped. 
---
danger -  the possibility of something unwelcome or unpleasant. 
---
I would say this is a generally unwelcome outcome.  If you're going to criticize someone on the basis of semantics you might as well do it correctly.
---
I’m beginning to see a trend here. 
---
It may or may not be all of our faults... woah
---
A ban doesn't happen immediately since the appeal has to be manually addressed by Blizzard and as we know they've cut down on their support staff by a considerable amount. It can often take weeks.
---
If you don't contest the reports and trigger a manual investigation then yeah obviously nothing is going to happen. My guess is that he won't contest since it could get his friends into trouble.
---
Falsely (or wrongfully) reporting someone once isn't a big deal, they're not going to ban you for that, but if you're a repeat offender you're gone. Plenty of people in Overwatch have had their accounts banned for example for falsely reporting players they deemed to be bad.
---
You must be fun at parties 
---
how do you know this?\
---
do you have any proof that can back this up?
---
Cant decide between druid and warlock. 
---
Warlock brings utility to the raid, is great in wpvp, does ok dmg early on and great dmg later AND can be played with only one specc in pvp/pve, SM/Ruin spec(Ive heard).
---
Druid brings some utility, i guess, inervate.They have stealth whoch is great for wpvp and pvp in general. I can heal/tank/dps in 5 mans. For Dungeons i can go HotW Spec, but can i also heal Raids in HotW Spec? 
---
Sooo, my Questions are:
---
1. Can i play warlock really with only SM/Ruin?
---
2. Can i raid heal in HotW(0/30/21)?
---
I wont be Raiding Hardcore Progress, but maybe clearing the Raid before the next one come would be cool.
---
It's ok, just be devilsaur rich
---
/u/Teeb
---
A rogue got it. I press dislike.
---
There were a couple pvp specs involving sub. Hemo/prep/cold blood (with a sword/mace/fist) became a popular pvp spec after the rogue talent re-work made the deeper bits of the sub tree more viable. There was a similar pvp spec for daggers that went deeper into combat for improved backstab and shallower in the sub tree and was used as an alternative to seal fate.
---
The combat/sub spec you’re thinking of came with level 70 in BC, and used adrenaline rush and preparation with maces for a lot of burst damage and stuns. Once that was nerfed, deep sub using hemo and shadowstep became the preferred pvp spec.
---
I explained my thoughts, how about you explain yours instead of just making a blanket statement?
---
!remindme 3 months
---
Why do you care how many servers and the cap? So you can whine more here if it's not what you want? 
---
Spell batching will be as close to they can get it to how it was (like they are receiving doing with rogue regen), sharding will be used when it's need like they said and they also said the only database they have is from 1.12 which means unless they trust old data mining sites or comb through screenshots then all gear will be as it was in 1.12.
---
They have already said they will release the patches when the feel the community is ready.
---
Just because you don't like the information that's out doesn't make them required to give you more.

The ole 'you must be fun at parties' defense, you must be an original guy!
---
Yeah.. you're right corpse campers are worse
---
Shadow Fang Keep up in this motherfucker!
---
Hell yeah! :)
---
What class is going to be the best for healing (Horde). I'm swaying towards priest as thats what i rolled when i started in vanilla but remember the levelling was painful (Could be more to do with the fact i was new to the game). 
---
I'm aiming to do both PvP and PvE and neither hardcore so what would you suggest? Stick with priest or is there a better? 
---
Check the other comments.
---
You do need other patches data, especially the changed item values if you want to make an authentic vanilla experience. Many items got buffed as time went on to make entering raiding easier. 
---
All the original Scarlet Monastery dungeons. Zul’Whatever-the-fuck in Tanaris. 
---
Love those dungeons. Hell, I miss OG tanaris. You want 5 kill quests and 5 quests related to getting items off the exact same mob youre already killing? Tanaris has it in spades. 
---
&gt;Once that was nerfed, deep sub using hemo and shadowstep became the preferred pvp spec.
---
Shadowstep was ridiculous, I remember in BG's setting up some incredible crits with it via the berserker buff. I think my record was ~6k on a priest in AB.  
---
It kinda seems like you're taking this personally. I hope everything is ok in your life.
---
&gt;What update do you want?
---
To answer those open questions, like sharding, right-click-report, cash shop, etc.
---
That’s a good point. I didn’t think about it that way. 
---
It's still a whole dungeon group!
---
Priest is the hands down best healer for horde if you’re talking about mana sustainability and being able to heal raid tanks efficiently. PvP you can still do well considering shammy players will be oom after they chain heal for 10 seconds. Leveling I’ve done recently on a priest and it was a slow but steady process. Making sure you have the best wand available to you increases your dps dramatically, and the mana conservation you get from not casting (since you’re wanting) allows for non-stop pulling single mobs while bubbling and HOTing. What is also amazing is that even in shadow spec you can still heal dungeons while leveling! If you want to heal on horde this is the healing machine that is good for all scenarios. Side note: shadow decimates in PvP if you ever want to kill everyone.
---
yeah, i've seen it after posting. is that you or did you find it somewhere else?
---
not at all, I hope everything is ok in yours too, especially if you're assuming things about people over the internet with very limited information about them
---
Charge will not put you on the mob's threat table until they have aggro'd onto you.
---
Cheers dude, i guess ill be rolling an ud priest then! 
---
Well the pic's the original version of the game, can't get any more original than that right. Why u so frustrated bud? 
---
A whole 0 people will get exalted with any faction by 40, it just won’t happen. People are living in a dream world if they think it’s that easy.
---
Rogue will be vastly overpopulated and you have to contest with a large variety of classes for gear. Getting places even in 5man instances can be hard. Warlocks are fantastic in PVP but likely still wont have anywhere near as big of a population as rogue.
---
40 was amazing. I had no where the money I needed for my mount. I however learned pyroblast and had so much fun with my gnome throwing pyroblast through terrain onto unexpected horde players because of the lack of line of sight restrictions when the game was in its early stages.
---
still decent pvp weapon as mace spec ;) 
---
Retail tanking is a lot more punishibg and complex at the top end.
---
Vanilla tanking has a much higher barrier to entry but doesn't really compare with pulls where a retail tank *needs* to use their whole kit effectively.
---
HotW is fine for early raiding (MC/BWL/ZG), but come AQ you'd likely need to revisit your specc.
---
I just have two comments.
---
1. Maybe I misunderstand but you seem to leap from "looks like classic data is 1/2 of what this one particular private server database had" to "its impossible". Frankly I actually totally agree its impossible, but that is a pretty slim piece of information to make that conclusion with
---
2. The classic wowhead data is in a really weird spot and should be taken with a grain of salt. It isn't really clear where the archived data came from and how updated it was. Also remember that WoWhead, Allakhazam and Thottbot were SIGNIFICANTLY less reliable through BC and WOTLK , iirc they operated practically as a wiki while harvesting data from the thottbot addon from players who opted in.
---
So, just sayin, I don't disagree its probably impossible, but I do disagree that you've presented any evidence that it is impossible
---
ALL SCARLET MONASTERY ALL DAY
---
It's going to be hilarious to watch people get stuffed by mobs in the starting zones.
---
"I've been playing for 3 hours and I'm only lvl 5 wtf!"

You know you can do splits right?
---
Deadmines. So I can tell the guy that picked up the gunpowder to shoot the canon.

At your side M' Lady!
---
QAZXCVBGTRW are now open to binds with modifiers alt/ctrl/shift. I do move the whisper reply over to Y and keep shift B for bags. I really like having ` aka ~ key as my mount too.
---
What the fuck is that? Trailer??
---
Looks really good! 
---
Had it in my background while playing today
---
Okay I have a spreadsheet where I have ranked all the classes on multiple pillars of excellence.
---
No single class scores perfect on my sheet.
---
I need help deciding here are the top pillars for consideration:
---
WANT:
---
	\+to tank dungeons
---
	\+strong class fantasy (lore, quests, visuals)
---
	\+fast movement prior to lvl 40, the earlier, the better (ghost wolf, travel form, aspect of the cheetah)
---
	\+melee focus with enough range to pick off a fleeing target
---
	\+stealth is cool but not mandatory
---
	\+specs good in both pvp and pve (does not have to be the same spec but preferred)
---
	\+enjoyable to level
---
	\+rotation that is about 4 buttons (arthritis), OS buttons are fine
---
YUCK:
---
	\-pets
---
	\-rage
---
	\-class mechanics that take my bag space
---
Which class best fits these pillars?
---
Thanks!
---
I have bought a new DAC, a pre-amp and a set of new speakers in anticipation for Classic WoW. I can't wait to experience the game again in high fidelity sound and in high definition resolutions!
---
How do I make gold as druid? 
---
Oh please, its kill or be killed.  He was a scout for a PvP guild that goes out of their way to wipe full raids with world buffs.
---
If you want to win every.1v1 you go orc warlock sl
---
Wait does WoW no longer have weather effects in it as of current client? 
---
I agree with you dropping us straight into 1.12 as it was would be the most authentic, as that actually existed at some time during retail vanilla, while 1.12 mixed with 1.1 itemization never existed at any point. I still think progressive itemization is the best option, because i feel like dropping us straight into 1.12 would be bad for the health of the game. Straight 1.12 only existed a short time in retail vanilla and a lot of catch up stuff like the OP blue gear in 1.10 was added as a catchup mechanic for people until TBC arrived. These catchup blue items added from lvl 50-60 dungeons are better than MC/ZG/BWL gear and i dont think its good for the health of the game to launch in a state like that and have it stay like that forever. Just personal opinion
---
I should've linked the reddit post, which is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7fygmu/gm_talking_about_classic_servers/?st=jrta0y3w&amp;sh=13a09283) one.
---
Yes, but I'm not talking about the quality of the designs, I'm talking about mixing gear on Vanilla.
---
For example, T2.5 helm and shoulders but rest T2 on a rogue, stuff like that. On Rogue particulary there are not blatant "eughh" combinations because the theme of subtlety and dark tones are mostly preserved. Now try mixing Druid or Shaman vanilla raid gear. This is what I'm talking about.
---
Deadmines, SM (any and all), Strat, Scholo, UBRS/LBRS.
---
Any of them, really. Well, maybe not Gnomer. Hah. ZF will be great. Stocks. Whatever. Unfortunately I probably won't have time for raids, so the 60's dungeons will be my main playground once I hit that level.
---
I’m going to go off on a limb here and say that most people that play vanilla private servers, DID play during classic. Just because they never hit 60, or don’t remember pieces of content, and their memories are clouded by pserver play, that doesn’t mean they didn’t play the original game. 
---
Dwarf priests will need Fear Ward for certain fights, as a holy spell you'd have to drop Shadow to apply it, not the best way to spend your mana.  
---
When was it changed?  I'm having a hard time finding the patch notes where it was.
---
Think we’re looking at a late August release earliest.
---
If i had to bet on it i’d go with September release
---
A few years ago I played for a couple days in a private server and was amazed at how much more immersive Classic is due to the weather effects and implementation of a meaningful day-night cycle. 
---
I was too young to no life Vanilla when it came out, then again i barely knew what i was doing half the time.
---
This time, i’m ready to no life! 
---
If you don't have a healer you're going to die a lot doing that.  I recommend a full party.
---
I actually have this as well as the receipt from November 2005 still tucked away inside the manual lol. 
---
I am really stuck between playing a Warrior and a Rogue on the Horde side.
---
I am focused on both PVE and PVP. I played a Rogue from late Vanilla to Cata and a Warrior from Cata to Legion. I have experience in both PVE and PVP but I just can't decide which one I want to play. As a Warrior I would ideally play Fury DPS but have no problem tanking also. 
---
I like the idea of Fury DPS but also like the benefit of rogues having vanish to lower their threat because we will not have Salvation on Horde.
---
Any input from people who have experience in Vanilla or PServers is appreciated.
---
I think there's a difference between adding intermediate content and a catch-up mechanic.
---
Haha that's so cool, hold onto it for anotyer 20 years. The ink on the receipt will prolly not be visible by then lol
---
I also do not expect to raid unless I'm playing in two years time with a bunch of casual raiders. I.e. we can play once a week or something. But still cannot wait.
---
Lock is the 4th best dps class imo and you bring great utility. If you are somewhat decent player you won't have trouble finding a raid.
---
It looks like a man is jumping off a roof into a swimming pool whilst another man simultaneously breathes fire in the direct path of the first man’s fall. There also appears to be some tables set up in the background and a couple of rather uninterested onlookers.
---
for you [https://i.imgur.com/rsMLapt.png](https://i.imgur.com/rsMLapt.png)
---
	\+melee focus with enough range to pick off a fleeing target  +stealth is cool but not mandatory
---
Do you think wotf would be good though? 
---
This is one I remember of a guy leveling his hunter pre patch 1.2.  No one has any idea what they're doing lol!

---
Go warlock. Rogues suck to level assuming the backstab sidestepping method doesn’t work. Warlocks on specifically the horde side can do serious damage in PvP. Rogues are 100% going to be overplayed due to the legacy of rogues being overpowered in vanilla. It sounds like you like warlock more anyway so roll with what you like. I can say that playing in the forbidden servers warlocks are much easier to level and have incredible utility. The rogue can pick locks and 1 shot you in world PvP that’s about it. Warlocks are a more solid class if you can get over the soul farming later on.
---
You only get once chance at this, do not screw it up!
---
Beautifully stated.
---
My issue is, as I get older, time I have goes down. The character I want to play gets ganked and guildies are offline. My only option is to keep corpse running until rez lockout or log off. 
---
When I was younger I found it exciting. Now, it’s a question of if I want to spend all my free time today as a corpse and the answer is typically “no” and I log over to an alt or play something else. 
---
I’ve never minded getting killed by a 60 (still don’t) if they’re in transit or something. Getting camped or having them decimate a leveling zone (Lakeshire comes to mind, or the Crossroads) is annoying if you can’t get a counter gank going. 
---
Feral Druid is literally your only option. And you’ll have to play in cat because you don’t like rage.
---
&gt; For example as a mage you can skip about half your spells completely until you hit 60
---
Solid advice if you want to be completely helpless in PvP.
---
I want to play warlock alliance.  Half the fun for me is looking cool, the other half is min/maxing, but because I am now an adult that works I don't plan on raiding that much.  
---
Am I crazy for wanting to play Human Warlock just for the aesthetics and lose out on the Int buff and Engineering buff?
---
Debating between focusing on PvP and PvE. 
---
Due to working shifts I would only be able to raid on Saturday and Sunday nights. I don't want to raid hardcore, but Id like to be in a serious raiding guild that gets forward and doesn't wipe on the same shit for days. 
---
With classic having much smaller realms and hopefully no character transfers and the uncertainty surrounding the launch on how big and stable realms will be even months after the launch am I setting myself up for disappointment finding a guild of shift workers that suits my needs?
---
3 or 4 isn’t over and over to you? Also, it sounds like your character is a twink. 
---
As for killing bitters, you’re doing the lord’s work. 
---
It took outrageously long.  It wasn't worth it at all to me. 
---
This is awesome while I'm at work. Thanks!
---
Maybe. I think the effective difference between the two is too small for a discussion.
---
Not liking rage won't prevent me from using bear form but yes in my considerations Druid (cat form) is pretty high up there.
---
Wouldn't Paladin with shocks qualify? 
---
I'm not necessarily saying they need a full rotation at range, nor that 4 buttons are the max possible (just the most comfortable), nor is stealth required (it's just very helpful imo).
---
I thought the battle shout spam tactic was proven to be a private server bug, that it is 1: only granting threat to those in range of it and 2: only grants threat if those affected by it were not already buffed by battleshout. At least this is what I remember being discussed couple years ago on the big private servers. 
---
Human vs Dorf Paladin for healing at 60? It's the Dorf Priests that get fear ward so I was thinking it's more of a balance.
---
Also I was thinking of picking mining and blacksmithing while leveling since it'll give me potentially free armour and weapons and I can smith lionheart helms at 60 for gold. People keep raving over engineering though.
---
Thank you for watching &lt;3
---
I was just running DM the first time and my group said that double poly wont work on the robot makers in classic. Just sharing what I've heard. DM is so great though, I liked it way more than WC, which is what I was always used to.
---
Thank you \^.\^
---
Yea, with my play time it will take me a bit to hit 60 anyway. I intend to just enjoy the game along the way. I would rush a main to 60 if I was able, but since that isn't to be.. *shrug* Mostly looking forward to revisiting old haunts in the world, running dungeons with groups and (hopefully) making some new friends (group or guild), and tinkering with professions. Hopefully I can find a good guild that is social and doesn't mind a casual player. Although with my demographic being a pretty common one among those waiting for WoW Classic (late-30's, career, kids), I don't imagine it will be difficult.
---
accurate
---
Well I'd say shaman (or druid) based on your wants. I am personally going shaman for complications buffing of totems and chain heal/lightning. I love supporting always been priest. I didn't suggest priest because you want speed, melee + slow, tank.  
---
If you're more interested in tanking dungeons druid all the way, if you hate rage enough go pally
---
Please define the current client. Is it 1.2.1? No, the "new" weather effects are garbage. They've got some improvements in Legion / BfA but they just don't seem to feel right.
---
Uhhhhh..... yeahhhhh
---
I've been downvoted so many times saying this but I just decided to let people learn on their own. 
---
This is the correct answer.
---
This weather makes me nostalgic. I think on the contrary, it lifts my spirit too. I guess it depends on what type of persons we are.
---
Not much exp but I'm going shaman after always maining priest. Consider a fresh look since you mained rogue early on
---
I have very limited tank experience dating back to retail vanilla as just a wailing caverns tank. I remember being extremely effective and running multiple runs one night doing tab sunder and shield block + revenge. It worked really well but I doubt I was being “optimal” by today’s standards. Felt like shield block always gave me revenge immediately and revenge did a TON of threat. I basically only used sunder otherwise and never lost threat. I might have been going too crazy but it sure worked well. What’s the meta for tanking anyways? Is shield block not commonly used in combination with revenge or is it something that’s used at low levels to generate revenge procs and later tossed when higher level/geared? I’ve been too nervous to try tanking and have ppl yell at me for not doing the meta lmao
---
Druid.  It's the only class that can Tank, Stealth, Has ranged spells to finish off runners, you generally level as feral so it's a melee focused class.  Can soft CC with Entangling Roots, has high self-sustain (power-shifting, healing, power-shifting back), has Travel form, is the de-facto WSG flag carrier, has high level rate.  
---
The 2nd class I'd suggest would be shaman.  They have the best lore IMO, and the class fantasy feels more fufilling than druid.  They hit a lot of the same boxes, and can tank lower level dungeons (and a few high level dungeons as well if properly geared/talented...but thats another story).  They get ghost wolf form early.  They are also good WSG flag carriers in pvp, and TBH because their ghost wolf form is slightly ethereal they are actually a little hard to make out in AV (due to the snow).  They level as enhancement generally so it's a high melee focus, but they have spells to finish off runners.  They have better burst than a druid, but less CC (earthbind and frost shock are the main soft CC's they have).  They have lower leveling speed than druid though.  
---
The 3rd pick would be paladin.  You might be noticing a pattern here:  hybrid classes.  They'll get better in TBC when/if that ever releases in a classic progression environment, but for now all 3 classes are pretty much stuck Raiding in end-game guilds.  You might get 1 slot for feral druid, or enchancement-nightfall shaman but them's the breaks.  Paladin is the slowest of the 3 in leveling I've suggested.  They get a free mount at 40, but no prior movement speed bonuses.  Their rotation is very boring and mainly consists of white damage.  The only saving grace is you will be able to aoe farm half-decently at level cap with good gear and a hybrid build of holy/protection.  They can tank some of the higher level undead dungeons because of their vastly improved abilities against undead, but you'll have a hard time convincing people you are a real tank until TBC. (even then Pally tanks were considered aoe/off-tanks most of the time)
---
The assets are the same as in Classic btw. They will not change. So I guess if you are now playing private servers, you will experience the same level of quality as in the WoW Classic launch day. (That's if you are opting in to see improved graphics - at least the water is changed.)
---
Focus on the yucks. 
---
No pets takes out locks and hunters.
---
No rage takes out bear drood and warrior.
---
No bag slots for class mechanics takes out shaman for totems and rogue for poisons even though most classes use reagents
---
So mage, paladin, and kitty durid (is 4 fite) are your options.
---
Then you said you wanted melee focus and leveling fun in your wants and so you're left with pally and cat druid.
---
With your want of faster movement you've whittled down to cat druid.
---
25% stun resist.
---
LOL
---
If only people realized how much it was abused in cata/wotlk, they wouldn’t not care
---
Roll warrior.  I'm not a warrior main myself by any means, but 1.12 and beyond warriors were king.  You'll also have more available slots as DPS (Generally raids would take 6-8 fury warriors.  Rogues generally numbered 4-6 for 40 man raids; that being said, more slots=more gear competition....FWIW)
---
Also, dps warriors scale with gear, and i think around 1.8 or 1.9 a few guilds started keeping one ARMS warrior around for mortal strike, though remember....a crit mortal strike might steal threat so you gotta use threat meters)
---
im just laying inclined in my couch and have keyboard ontop of myself and mouse on the side of the couch, and screen at the opposite end of couch. May be strange but it's insanely comfy :D
---
Simply not true, there is no need for half the arcane or fire spells, no need for scorch while levelling or arcane missile, dampen magic amplify magic, slow fall, no pyroblast or blastwave.  None of these spells need to be trained until long past 40 even on a pvp server.  Every sensible mage will be in a frost build from lvl 1, and only maintaining fireblast and fireball at max rank.  Heck you only ever need to learn rank 1 frost nova for the entire game.
---
I have levelled well in excess of 20 mages on private realms over a period of close to a decade.  I will never claim to be an expert pvp player, but the basic tookit for a mage in pvp is very much the same as your levelling build. 
---
You are correct. ClassicDB has many, many incorrect values, as it is partially based off of a TBC database.
---
The private servers people have played on the last couple of years have had very different values for quests, everything from rep to experience. They're probably still not spot on, but there's no point using this website as "proof" of anything.
---
&gt; So, let's get you all in here, let's hear all the bullshit one more time so I can type a !remindme on all your comments. 
---
Let’s be real here, you don’t want to have a discussion. You want to be smug. From the title to the ‘!remind me!’ posts, your goal is just to be inflammatory because you like being inflammatory I guess? I don’t know much about you, but that’s what has become readily apparent from your conduct in this thread.
---
Okay, lets start out, what's the point in a beta?
---
Lol, why?
---
Could one say that +int gear is more useful for lower lever paladins while healing dungeons for example? I remember healing deadmines as a paladin and my mana was always very dangerously low, even with downranking.
---
A +int set for healing could be more useful in the range of lvl 20-50 than a +healing set since lower level gear doesn’t have crazy +healing?
---
Idk whatever BFA has going on. I never played vanilla just BC-BFA. I felt there was a level of immersion that withered away, but I thought that was just my brain getting used to the game and childhood fantasy being grown out of. Didn’t think there was actual weather differences that made you feel immersed. 
---
Also I subbed to you :) good stuff my friend.
---
Vote with your wallet. CHANGES = CARD STAYS INSIDE. NO CHANGES = CARD COMES OUT.
---
It had the hidden keyword: fun
---
I wouldn't downplay shaman that fast.  Early on shaman would go oom because a lot of their gear wasn't great on the stat distribution until ZG.  Also, shaman should be spamming rank 1 chain heal on tanks to raid heal aoe/dot damage.  Also, eventually shaman would want to get the darkmoon card: blue dragon as that helps a ton with mana management.  Just remember, shaman weren't #1 healers, but they brought more utility than a priest in the form of totems.  Remember that time the priest prevented onyxia fear?  As horde, you didn't because only dwarf priests got fear ward.  But tremor totem says hi.  
---
Resto Priest = Pure healer.
---
Resto Shaman = Utility healer.
---
While this movie does take things to extremes, I've seen first hand some really, really incompetent people move up at the company I work at purely by brown nosing and have seen people who are really great at their job quit, get fired or stay in the same role and get denied promotions because they're not "people pleasers", they sort of tell it how it is. 
---
Don't get me wrong, there's a good balance but you'd be surprised how far sucking up can get you and how much more important that is than actually doing a good job. 
---
Of course this is just my experience at a large company, I'm sure everyone's experience is different. 
---
Nothing can be Nogg-aholic the Movie
---
Nogg aholic is great as well, introduced me and got me addicted to trance music :)
---
The first time my buddy ever ran that dungeon with me, he got BOTH blues that drop to combine into the Epic sword... it was awesome.
---
sense of accomplishment
---
Most people don't own a standing desk or have proper ergonomics (myself included) so getting up every 30 minutes or so is a hugely important factor in not ending up with back pain at the end of the day. 
---
The linked map was real, just outdated, or listed unapproved, abandoned ideas. Metzen (or someone) would pitch kobold lair to the team in a map like this...and he’d weigh everyone’s reaction. If no one thought the idea was cool it would fizzle, or become something smaller, like a micro-dungeon (non-instanced play space). The same was true with zone ideas, monster, races, etc. Devs should take the path of least resistance, and abandoning dead end ideas is just part of a healthy, organic process. A bad studio creative usually forces ideas on the team, and it takes longer to create content that way. 
---
not at all, honestly, if you have anything you want to say about the subject I'd be glad to hear it, I can see how people can perceive that from the OP though from how I came across - all people have spoken about on this sub is 'there will be a beta', but I have my own doubts - if anyone has any good points to change my mind then I'd actually be glad to read them
---
the point is a ton of people just comment saying 'there will be a beta' and adding nothing else as to why they think so, this is a recreation they already have all the data for, which is another reason as to why I have my doubts for them holding a beta.
---
so what do you think? will there be a beta? or will there not a beta? and why do you think so?
---
Oh man that’s so cool. I ran that dungeon so many times on my warlock to get those swords for my buddy. It was a big moment for both of us when he finally combined them. 
---
Yesterday some dickhead lvl 46 was killing Westfall quest mobs for his lowbie friend (carrying him).  After I told him he should make his friend fight his own battles he lost his shit.  
---
During our whisper war, he claimed his level 12 friend had 1 hour played time....  Wut...
---
He also told me my mom should have aborted me when I was 10.
---
I asked for your thoughts, not mine lol
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much. The first week or two of Classic's release will likely be plagued by bugs, crashes, large crowds, tourists, fighting over quest spawns, etc. I am also planning to take a week off at some point, but it will probably be after a month or so.
---
Depending on exactly when in 'summer', your time off might be more when kids are getting back to school, so colleagues are back at work.
---
Me and my mates are taking the second week off.
---
We plan to play as and when during week one, and then as soon as the first weekend is done, we'll be free to enjoy from the monday onwards.
---
Hopefully we'll have had time to make characters/race decisions, any patches will have been done, the "rush" will have passed us and we can select a non streamer server.
---
In the end we have zero desire to rush Classic, so we're all pretty excited about this plan.
---
Hits home man. Hits home wayyyy too hard.
---
Very cool, thanks for the info!
---
extremely rare given the amount of work required
---
making a system that suddenly makes that super easy to do is not a good solution
---
This may be what you are looking for https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mage/Abilities
---
You can search for the class you want then total it up, HTH
---
Yeah exactly what I thought.
---
I have to admit I also cant wait for Classic and catch myself way to often by refreshing this sub.
---
But as i read this thread, all I thought of was [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d8/10/76/d81076188e5f0fda98ddd90135911718.jpg)
---
Chill dude :-)
---
IMO if they keep it, it will vastly change the dungeon experience from 1-60 and the entire the awesome loot system that existed in Classic. 
---
BoP's are bind on pickup for a reason. This system was a shitshow in cata. I hope they smarten up!
---
This is what I found from patch 2.3 
---
Wyvern Sting (Survival) is now instant cast and has a maximum duration of 10 seconds in PvP.
---
Wyvern Sting: This ability will no longer be overwritten by lower ranks of Wyvern Sting.
---
I know that there's a hunter ability that has a 5 min cd but it resets all your abilities. So it was possible in pvp and pve to cc multiple targets or keep somebody cc for a longer duration.
---
Exactly ! Was the first time I heard Airwave - God surrounds us. 15 years later, still my fav trance song.
---
Have run it a few times in the last week on a ps- nice mix of 'where the heck am I' and challenge for that level.  Final escort event is also a nice challenge, your group might do fine going through the rest of the instance but once you get to there it's definitely a notch above the previous. 
---
In the room between Beast and Drak?  Yeah that room sucks ass.
---
This. Almost every other class has threat drops, CC abilities, burst damage absorption/negation abilities, escape mechanisms for kiting or limited OT abilities. The job of DPS in Vanilla was more than just “hit your rotation.” Make em earn their keep.
---
Okay, and my thoughts are a beta is there to find issues, what do you think it's there for?
---
Since Blizzard own all the rights to WoW only they get to decide (via TOS) what kind of use of their software is legal and what use is illegal (hence "piracy").
---
Using your points you can argue you're not inflicting any financial damage to Blizzard (which I believe is true), but in the end it's still piracy. 
---
I don't really like the term either, since it implies something gets "taken away" which is not the case. But I can't come up with a better short and usually widely understood term for the illegal acquisition, reproduction or distribution of software. 
---
No way man.  Dampen magic is a great buff for when you're soloing.  
---
Slow fall is great for navigating or as an escape ability leaving various "elevated" areas. 
---
The others maybe sure, less useful, but dampen magic can save you easily hundreds or thousands of HP if you're fighting mobs that do magic damage over the course of its duration. 
---
Sweet, thanks!
---
Yeah many warrior abilities are like that.  Heroic strike, cleave, overpower to name a few.  
---
Is my leg being pulled? 
---
Its useful, but not essential. I will skip it entirely until my mount fund is secure.  
---
Shaman have a bunch of totems that waste bag space..
---
Didn't they try to release BWL without doing any beta testing, and it suffered because of it?
---
This is 100% legit information on spectral citizens in Strat, as to the rest of the comments I cannot confirm or deny ;)
---
Dammit:P
---
Humans in Azeroth were either adapted for aquatic or arctic environments. Feet = paddles or snow shoes, take your pick.
---
Hey guys, I kinda wanna go enchant/engi on my rogue at max even if its painful. Do you think I should lvl with herb/mining then and replace them both later? Then grab them on an alt?
---
A buddy got both after just a few runs.  He used the epic sword on his hunter.
---
None of those are vanilla so I’d hope they’d be gone. Shouldn’t need an update for that. 
---
They don't need to make news just to have news.
---
The game is 14 years old. They shouldn't be changing anything and they shouldn't be adding anything. Anything that qualifies as "news" or an "update" means that Blizzard is informing us of another way they've decided to change the game's original formulation to save money. 
---
As far as I'm concerned, the less "news" the better. We're here for rose-tinted glasses, not to be shocked and awed by sweet new gameplay.
---
Doesn't matter much, but Dwarf is slightly better because of Stoneform for a free bleed/poison/disease cleanse and 8 secs of immunity. I find it most helpful in PvP against hunters and rogues but it helps a little in PvE too.
---
I'm more about being a less common race so I am stuck between the two as well. However i love alliance cities and zones so much, always mained alliance. Love dwarves too. For trolls the tantalizing part for me is shadowguard blackout crits. I may roll troll and level shadow but I would eventually go holy/disc.  
---
 As for dwarf I feel the same way about the lore, I'd honestly level smite over shadow because 1. I've never done it, and 2. It just feels right as a dwarf priest.
---
I disagree. Other expansions were fun. Each was a bit different but they each have their own charm.
---
My honest thoughts are this: we can’t possibly know, and spouting doom and gloom isn’t constructive or helpful. We have an approximate timeframe from Blizzard, Summer 2019 which can technically mean until mid September. That’s over 6 months for things to get moving, all we can do is wait and hope.
---
I honestly don’t know if there will be a beta, but I do think there is internal testing going on for Classic. I don’t like saying this kind of stuff because I can’t substantiate it in anyway and it sounds like that kid in elementary school who swears his Grandpa is a super secret spy, but I do have several friends with connections to Blizzard. Technically it is a “friend of a friend” sort of deal, but everything I’ve ever heard from this guy has come out more or less true. Spec changes, the conclusion of Legion, some BFA information, it’s pretty on the money. 
---
But, anyway, back when the information about the Netflix Diablo animated series leak happened, my friend told me that it caused a serious uproar at Blizzard. Like volunteer testers and people on that sort were kicked to the curb because those kind of leaks could cause lawsuits. He said that maybe have affected the chances of an open beta or an invitational beta. Like I said, I have no way of knowing if this is true in any
---
way, all I know is that the things my friend has told me in the past have usually lined up with reality.
---
Take it how you will, but my overall point is this: we can’t know, and drumming up doom and gloom doesn’t help. It just hurts moral.
---
\*bad expansions ruin the game
---
The extra int from being Gnome is a miniscule benefit that you won't even notice. If you like PvP you might miss having Escape Artist though.
---
Sharding will be there based on earlier responses, loot trading will be as well. And if loot trading is there, right-click-report will most likely also be there (both achieve the same thing, cheapen customer service for the company) 
---
There hasn't been any info about cash shop but it isn't unlikely that they will add that or at least tokens to curb down RMT and get more revenue.
---
I mean, if they do TBC servers my assumption would be it'd be a new server with optional character copying over to them. I don't see them removing classic entirely.
---
&gt; I wouldn't worry about it too much. The first week or two of Classic's release will likely be plagued by bugs, crashes, large crowds, tourists, fighting over quest spawns, etc.
---
I completely disagree.  This isn't a brand new game and infrastructure.  I know they're "remaking" it from the ground up so to speak, but this type of release is not going to be prone to the same bugs one would expect in an MMO launch.
---
This wasn't really a thing in classic.  When the first level grind was out and first round of alts it was Rush shadow and drink like crazy.
---
/silly

It’s important to note that it is beating a dead horse (which is quite useless). Beating a live horse is inhumaine but can have results.

UBRS, Strat and Scholo.
---
I hate leveling.  End-game is where my passion is at.
---
I’ll be thrilled if you are correct! But I’ll believe it when it happens.
---
Like /u/Vejret I will take week 2 off I think.
---
Just curious, do you guys tell your bosses that you are going on vacation somewhere? 
---
well in essence every so often an mmo needs some form of new content to keep people interested.
---
while late vanilla did rather a good job providing a variety of content with pretty good gear its an issue most mmos have.
---
i.e. even on a raid level , every time a new raid comes out people want the new stuff and for the most part the old raid gear becomes only usefull to new guild members and alts.
---
ive played a few korean mmo's that try and do it different but they really loose that feeling of chasing a drop and finally getting it.
---
BDO for example there is basically boss gear and world gear but once you get the base gear you essentially are then just trying to upgrade that piece of gear for what could be over a year.
---
when materials to upgrade gear drop or a second piece you can upgrade later it really looses that feeling of getting a chase item.
---
I could go into some of the other systems ive tried but i sort of like the wow system of new raids or expansions all with chase items and unique 3d models etc. It sort of needs to be like that so there is chase items
---
Pretty much the same here and I only have time to delay the booking until the end of May...
---
OP has gone into full on "checkmate atheist" mode.
---
No we have a number of days to do anything with. But when you apply for holidays boss has to check service levels to make sure not all staff are off.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Well, some pieces of the set are amazing for enhance shammys as str gives 2ap. I've recently gotten yelled at for rolling on some gear on North of Dale by warriors, so not really fun (but I did equip and use it for many levels after...almost to 60).
---
Totems aren't nearly as cumbersome as ammo though...
---
As an intro dungeon DM is great because of the "wait, there's more?!" factor.  Also, I don't remember the double polymorph being a trick in Vanilla so I think they may be right.  Seems like it would be a private server glitch.
---
Warrior. Because there is no better feeling than executing an Alliance rtard for 900 when he only has 250hp left. It’s like, instead of just burying him 6ft deep, he’s like 20ft deep. 
---
I'm doubting between Rogue and Druid.  
---
Druid pro's:  
---
I like the pvp (hotw spec) and general play style in PVP  
---
I like that it's a underplayed class
---
Druid con's:  
---
I don't know if i will like healing in raids / if i will be good at it (never healed before)   
---
Don't like to be a flag carrier in WSG  
---
Rogue pro's:   
---
good in PVP and PVE  
---
I like the play style but not as much as druid I think  
---
Rogue Con's:  
---
Overplayed class  
---
They can both make gold and I don't mind the leveling speed / difficulty.  
---
Any suggestions? thanks in advance  
---
I do not plan to raid and I have been researching itemization for Shaman tanking but I am worried about how gameplay with totems will feel. I've never leveled a Shaman so that is one of my biggest concerns about the class. 
---
Generally against someone prompting their guild outside of the weekly thread. However this is great editing.
---
SM/Ruin is used for later game raiding.  Since most early raiding is done against either fire immune or fire resistant mobs, early raiding uses a DS/Nightfall talent build for warlocks.  
---
As for raid healing as 30/21 you'll most likely still be required to innervate, HoT up anyone who needs it as feral. But be warned.  Most raids only kept 1 feral druid around (if any), and usually only had 2-3 druids tops at all from my experience.
---
only website available was [warcraftmovies.com](https://warcraftmovies.com) and you had to fraps everything, so max 30 seconds per clip. Also people had HDDs with like 256GB of space or similar, so you could not capture footage for days. 
---
So no, there are no lets plays, 99% of all videos are either raid boss kills or PvP videos.
---
To be fair, why the fuck would you care about that? Find something better to do with your time than start dumb arguments in a game, dude.
---
I always ask myself 1) What is useful while leveling and 2) What is leveling useful for.
---
1) Enchanting is useful during leveling for casters (they can make wands, wizard oil, and things like that), but it doesn't do quite as much for rogues. You can still enchant your gear, which is always good, but there aren't any temporary best-in-slot items that you can make yourself like for mage/warlock/priest. Engineering also doesn't help too much while leveling, but is great at 60 for just about everyone.
---
2) If you want to collect herbs and ores, leveling helps with both herbalism and mining because you are in the zones you need to collect the herbs/nodes that level those skills already. Going back to do them at 60 so that you can start collecting the high level materials is a pain. Enchanting benefits the most from levelling because you can disenchant all the gear you no longer need / don't need from drops and quests to enchant your stuff and progress as you go. It's a very natural progression that goes well while leveling. However, disenchanting this stuff instead of selling it puts a big damper on your gold progression and will make it quite a bit more difficult to buy your 40 and 60 mounts, compared to vendoring excess gear.
---
Another possibility as a rogue is leveling skinning and leatherworking while leveling, then making the gear you need when you get to 60 before dumping leatherworking and skinning for enchanting and engineering.
---
Lol Druid, Paladin, Shaman, and Mage are the top  positions on my spreadsheet (in that order). Just not sure which to pick.
---
Good year to be a online college kid.
---
Progressive everything or dropped into 1.12 as it was are the only 2 options you have if you claim #NoChanges.
---
However, I am not a #NoChange-er. Some changes could lead to a much better classic, so I'd rather judge each prospective change on it's own merit.
---
With progressive itemization, I'm against it unless it's progressive everything. It makes very little sense to me to intentionally do the effort of restoring items to a specific iteration with the intention of changing them down the line. I think it's far more important that there be consistency in the items people spend their time acquiring.
---
Given that we're already going to have 1.12 talents and abilities, we may as well have 1.12 items for consistencies sake.
---
If this would trivialize the early endgame too much, then it makes more sense to rebalance that specific content for the state of the game upon release.
---
3 or 4 times camping? Kinda a dick move. 3 or 4 times while you patrol the zone? Still probably a dick move but way more enjoyable for both parties. 
---
I am a bit twinked. Decided to dump my not-quite-60’s gold into the rogue, enough to get me 2 decent weapons, crusader and fiery, and cheap green armor. No engineering yet but soon hopefully. It’s more than enough fun though, and it’s challenging. Nothing to give you an adrenaline boost like hiding from a ?? specifically hunting you down.
---
That's whats up. 
---
Say the game comes out on a Tuesday. Tuesday, Wednesday i'm taking off. Then I'll take Monday, Wednesday or Friday off for the next two or three weeks. Keeps me from burning out playing 12 hour days for weeks at a time, minimizes work building up, keeps me ahead of the pack.
---
It seems like you didn't read my OP properly when you made your post. My point, that you quoted, was that there isn't any point holding a beta any later than May because players won't be able to test things thoroughly. In my OP, I made it clear that I understand what a beta is, and what it does.
---
You still aren't answering my question properly, nor are you contributing to discussion. You keep coming out with questions which are very obviously from a sarcastic standpoint.
---
So I'll ask again, explain your thoughts as to why it isn't pointless to hold a beta later than May?
---
I hope very soon
---
4 totems....
---
&gt;why the fuck would you care about that
---
He's killing every mob for a quest, and those mobs take ages to respawn.  
---
&gt;find something better to do with your time
---
I'm already doing something better with my time by playing the game. Typing out "get your friend to do his own work" takes four seconds, and replying to his flaming takes seconds as well.
---
&gt;than start dumb arguments in a game, dude.   
---
  He's the one who started the argument, duuuude.
---
Lightning shield, flamtongue til wf at 30, Earth shock, ghost woof and heals. Stormstrike when u get it and then swap to 2her. cc/buffs are optional. Everything else is pretty much useless.
---
Kinda why I hope of blizzard does something major that isn’t on private servers but was in vanilla they do a blog post backing it up so we don’t have to deal with this.
---
you articulate your points very well, and I agree with you, there is no point spouting doom and gloom because it isn't constructive or helpful, and I can see why people want to remain outwardly positive about the situation. very interesting to read you have connections with people at Blizzard. I do hope they give us a beta so we can test, my fears come from them not testing it thoroughly enough, or missing mechanics, but I guess we just have to have faith when it comes to their internal QA team.
---
Swordsmithing is woefully inadequate in vanilla and won't be half-decent until TBC comes out and you get the much better sword recipes from that expansion.
---
As an undead warrior you will benefit greatly from the racial Cannabilize which will essentially act as a free food item every few minutes assuming you are fighting humanoids.  
---
That being said, alchemy could greatly benefit you as a warrior giving you unlimited access to better self-sustain, rage potions, invul potions, and eventually flask of the titans.  Blacksmithing is not a bad profession as a warrior, it will allow you to easily fill gaps in your gear as you level, and engineering is the de-facto PvP profession so if you plan on playing PvP a lot as a warrior, go engineering and don't regret it.
---
Is this a pedo post? 
---
No, they're distinct.  Catch-up mechanics are:
---
* A new raid is released.  You can use LFR to skip over the previous raid tiers.
---
* You can use dungeons to get marks that will get you gear comparable to the current raid tier.
---
* You are below a threshold in Artifact Power so you get a boost to allow you to catch up to be a week behind instead of a month behind.
---
A catch-up mechanic is when you spend less effort to get to the same point.  Intermediate content is simply content that evens out the progression.
---
Then why is classic coming back?
---
Wailing Caverns, Sunken Temple and Scholomance.
---
I really miss the original version of those dungeons on live, can’t wait to do them again.
---
Dorf for beards!
---
&gt;With progressive itemization, I'm against it unless it's progressive everything. It makes very little sense to me to intentionally do the effort of restoring items to a specific iteration with the intention of changing them down the line. I think it's far more important that there be consistency in the items people spend their time acquiring. Given that we're already going to have 1.12 talents and abilities, we may as well have 1.12 items for consistencies sake.
---
so i'm just curious then, do you also want the game to launch with every raid out, BGs, honor system etc? for consistencies sake. I just don't see how adding 1.1 itemization to a 1.12 (talents and spells) game is any different than adding 1.1 content (no diremaul, only MC/onyxia out) to an 1.12 game. And blizzard is already doing the latter. 
---
&gt;If this would trivialize the early endgame too much, then it makes more sense to rebalance that specific content for the state of the game upon release.
---
The problem i personally have with no progressive itemization isn't really that earlier content becomes trivialized, it's more the fact if you launch with 1.12 itemization and 1.1 content (only mc/ony), then you will have lvl 50 blue items from brd that are the best items in the entire game for 1 year + until AQ40 releases. 
---
No booty bay fishing tournament if you're a bloodsailer :(
---
Miniscule differences like the other guy said. Go with your feels
---
Please point out the ridiculous ones 
---
Yes! Me and my mate will have a small "lan" like wr used to in vanilla tbc wotlk. Alot of coke and energy drinks ;)
---
In Vanilla it could only be used outside of combat.  I was trying to find when that changed.
---
That was part of the AQ event, and Blizzard confirmed at blizzcon a progressive release of content. So there won't be cloth turn ins for quite some time, as there will be no AQ war effort.
---
Thanks
---
I was 12 when I first started playing vanilla back in 2005. Now I'm 25, and since I had a break between high school and uni to work and travel, I'm in my last year of uni now. Feels good 😀
---
I think one of the first videos I watched on youtube was Pat's PvP video and "The internet is for porn".
---
I'm not planning on being a shadow main, mainly to level with it or dick about with it, but I'm saying that its a big part of the Priests identity and it just doesn't feel appropriate for a Dwarf in a number of ways. Its an odd feeling. 
---
big ass feet
---
We have 5 weeks every year. And the company is usually closed for 4 weeks during the summer. I just hope it launches in mid July. Cuz that is when the vaccation is
---
It's a perfectly reasonable and valid thing to do. There is no reason a higher level player can't help out his lower level friend with questing. You complaining about them doing something that isn't wrong is you starting the argument. I'm sorry to burst your bubble but you were the asshole in that situation.
---
i already ranted a lot about the issues of expansions. But ya TLDR of what i wrote, expansions don't expand, they replace content in the way TBC and beyond where implemented. Higher level caps makes old content obsolete, and outlands had no connection to azeroth.
---
If you want to make expansions useful you go a route that doesn't break stuff. Is 1-60 a pain for levelling? No its enjoyable so why make 60-70? Does 60-70 add on to it? No because levelling was dumb downed, elites where removed, and gear progression was made more generic with less sense of reward. 
---
Welp, my plans went up in smoke I guess xd.
---
On Horde side will I be able to pump more DPS as a Fury Warrior or a Rogue (because of Vanish) without Salvation?
---
Now that is a good one! Would love to do that one
---
do you have proof? you and OP both contradict each other without offering any substantial proof.
---
Because there is a huge demand.
---
There's also a huge demand for other expansions (people seem to love WotLK) but it'd be weird not to start from the beginning.
---
Nah, I didn't insult him, but after I made that one comment, he starts flinging insults at me.  He was the asshole.
---
We might get to see our old favourite “Error 37”
---
Thanks for the help, I figured I could pick enchanting later since I can just stack all the green items and disenchant them later. Herb could help with poisons and mining was to max engi when I hit 60. Once I got engineering maxed out I can replace mining with enchanting and start lvling that. Then pick up mining on an alt to supply engineering on main. Does this make sense or am I just being crazy
---
Classic is the best iteration of the game, which is why weare all here, I get it and there is barely anything to talk about in regards to classic, but this sub isn't /r/RetailWoWsucks or /r/ReadMyStoryAboutWhyClassicIsTheBest
---
Genuinely tired of reading the same rambling on this sub over and over again. This shit has been said a thousand times before. Just like the constant shitting on retail is just embarrassing and pathetic at this point. 
---
Pro Tip vanilla WoW would have died too if they didn't release expansions.
---
Personally hoping for September 22 (last day of summer) so that I have enough time after my move and blizzard has plenty of time to polish the game. 
---
You make it sound all doom and gloom, but Blizzard will see great profits with minimal work if they continue on with BC and WotLK.
---
I don't think the expansion system ruined the game, it kept the game profitable and relevant for over a decade. Sure there maybe disappointments, but there's no failure in my opinion. If they did nothing but small updates to WoW, without doing massive sweeping changes that come with expansions, the game would have become stagnant to the masses a long time ago. Sure there'll be a smaller following of people who would have loved that, but the numbers would have peaked 3 years into WoW's life, but by 2010 the numbers would have dwindled to lower than they are today.
---
The other thing about expansions, they're an excellent marketing tool. They're exciting, they get to show off shiny new stuff that gets people's attention. People who never played it, or ones that left years ago see a shiny new expansion and think 'maybe it's time I go back'. 
---
Regrowth/rejuv yourself before pulling trash in Dire Maul, kill stuff in bear, loot evetything (even the grey trash sells for a decent amount if you gather a lot), sometimes the DM books drop which sell for a lot, also green and BoE blues. Living essences too.
---
Call for help in guild or general and get someone to come help you. PvP on a PvP server is perfectly fine. Worst case you log off and do something else, or you play an alt for awhile. I got corpse camped plenty in 2004-2006, I never complained about it beyond normal bitching. Never acted like it was something that shouldn't happen/should be reportable. Can you imagine? Getting in trouble for PvP'ing on a PvP server? How absurd.
---
It's not like they could release a tbc server without first releasing classic. You'd have to start at 60 because classic zones/quests wouldn't be exist. Profs would have to start at 300 because you couldn't get vanilla mats etc...
---
TBC &amp; wotlk are built ontop of classic, in order to make an accurate tbc server, you'd literally have to recreate all the classic content anyway.
---
I hated  the way TBC gear looked. All the floating crystals and rocks (shudders). 
---
I did like the Deathmantle set for rogues though, rivaled T2 as far as looks go but then we got Slayer's armor which, IMO, was one of the ugliest sets ever created. 
---
What a horrible boss to fight haha. Especially as alliance.
---
&gt; It seems like you didn't read my OP properly when you made your post.
---
I did.
---
&gt; y point, that you quoted, was that there isn't any point holding a beta any later than May because players won't be able to test things thoroughly.
---
And my point is that some testing is better than no testing, which is objectively true which means, the part I quoted is objectively false.
---
Its the same story with most of their stuff, you are just noticing the only one you care about.  
---
For example, we haven't gotten a word since Blizzcon's WC3R demo as well.  
---
&gt; Nah, I didn't insult him, but after I made that one comment, he starts flinging insults at me ("your mom should have aborted you").
---
&gt; He was the asshole.
---
Both can be true. I'm sure you're a nice person, but in that moment you were being an asshole. He responded by being a (bigger) asshole back.
---
&gt;My entire point of my OP was that he made a claim that his lvl 12 friend had 1 hour played which was total bullshit.
---
Maybe. Maybe not. If he was rushing his friend through the content that maybe it's possible, or at least not as big of an exaggeration as you think. I don't really know.
---
&gt; I just don't see how adding 1.1 itemization to a 1.12 (talents and spells) game is any different than adding 1.1 content
---
Talents, abilities and items all serve to make your character stronger relative to the content you face. Only making one of the three progressive trivializes the controlling effect it has on power creep.
---
I'd have no major issue with the game being dropped in a 1.12 finished state, but I don't really think that would be the best approach. The 4 phase plan they have so far isn't bad.
---
&gt;The problem i personally have with no progressive itemization isn't really that earlier content becomes trivialized, it's more the fact if you launch with 1.12 itemization and 1.1 content (only mc/ony), then you will have lvl 50 blue items from brd that are the best items in the entire game for 1 year + until AQ40 releases.
---
That's a pretty authentic classic experience, though, and progressive itemization doesn't even come close fixing it. You still end up with things like Gallant's Wristguards (which are a green) being BiS until Naxx.
---
Vanilla itemization was just that poorly thought out.
---
Hello there WoW baby  
---
Need I remind you of Warcraft 3 Reforged?  
---
There isn't enough inventory / bank space in classic to keep all the greens and blues you would have by level 60m unfortunately. Using an alt is always a possibility.
---
Another thing to consider is leveling with skinning / enchanting. Keep all your skins, then swap skinning to leatherworking at 60, disenchant all the leather items you don't need, but level leatherworking to get your level 60 items, then drop leatherworking for engineering. The alt would have mining to support leatherworking and herbalism or skinning, depending on what you need.
---
We have different definitions of asshole then.  Snark =/= asshole to me.  Blatant insults = asshole to me.
---
Thank you for the kind words and the Silver, it’s always nice with actual discussions happen, lord knows I’ve only had a handful. XD
---
But, on topic, I’m glad my third hand information could help put your mind at ease. Like I said multiple times, I have no way of knowing if it’s 100% accurate but all I can do is hope. Plus, I can understand being cynical, but I feel like people have crazy unrealistic expectations in a lot of cases, so I try to point them out. That mainly ends in rapid downvoting and no discussion.
---
Oh, and if totally trust the internal QA team. Those guys are BEASTS. Stupid example, but the Challenge Mode Race they had at BlizzCon before MoP dropped? I remember watching Blizzards internal team just CRUSH Blood Legion. Like it was a massacre. Never seen a Top 5 World Guild look that frazzled.
---
But some dungeons are well worth doing as it's faster leveling...
---
I done think server reset will work. But they could simply release new servers and let the old ones die out. 
---
So for example:
---
Year 1-4: classic
---
Year 4-6: tbc 
---
Year 6-8: wotlk and new classic servers 
---
And repeat :)
---
Patch =/= Product
---
They don't want to undercut retail anymore than thier own stupidity already has I guess... Either that or they are just thick in the head. 
---
I actually just made this post like 3 days ago voicing that lmao
---
Hope they say soon!
---
I had a check but didn't see it. Sorry :')
---
Hm that could work, just need to be sure I got the right amount of leather materials before replacing it with LW. Thanks again
---
Yea, bwl was bugged to shit to not "leak" the bosses, which is what caused blizz to make sure to test all content in the game before putting it live.
---
The reality is I doubt most of us here give a flying fuck who beats the raid in the expansion we don't like first. 
---
Where do you work and can you put in a good word for me!
---
&gt;Scholomance 
---
I ran that instanced hundreds of times during Vanilla, I'll run it hundreds more times again come Classic. 
---
Looking forward to UBRS too, I loved that instance but it was hard to put a group together that would do Drakkisath, most if not all of my groups fell apart after Rend or The Beast. 
---
SFK is def one of my favorites. They really should've had more castle like dungeons in the game IMO. 
---
My biggest problem with expansions is when they make old content obsolete so that no one does the old raids, top end quests, Etc. There should be a progression from each game to the next.
---
Making everything old irrelevant just to tack on a small new game on top is lazy and bad game design. Imagine how huge and immersive the world would feel if somehow all of wows content were sought after to do even after 5 expansions.
---
I think it's kinda funny how much of a role not knowing when the drop is is playing in my life right now. 
---
I'm just checking this and twitter every day in hopes like a drug addict.
---
I'm doubting between Rogue and Druid.
---
I don't know if i will like healing in raids / if i will be good at it (never healed before)  
---
Don't like to be a flag carrier in WSG
---
Rogue pro's:  
---
I like the play style but not as much as druid I think
---
Overplayed class
---
They can both make gold and I don't mind the leveling speed / difficulty.
---
Any suggestions? thanks in advance
---
I've got 17 days of holiday to book a good 10 will be on classic launch week 2 I think. But if it's all booked up looks like it's a random week in September. 
---
Good luck surviving bro
---
Im taking the day after release off and the second week of release. Best of two worlds i guess
---
This weather, small far clip distance, no flying mounts, nearly 8 bits char models they were all part of classic experience and I loved everything about it.

Thank you for the sub ♥️

There's other ways to level my dude

---

---
You still dont see the point...
---
Why is there a huge demand for previous expansions?
---
A: Because current ones are worse
---
B: WOTLK and TBC is still in the main game but its dead content even for new players. and thats my point. Even if its good content, its going to be dead with this "wipe out everything" expansion system. 
---
This requires specific circumstances.  You need to be near the dungeon, you need the group to form up and get there quickly without wasting time, you need the run itself to progress efficiently, you need all quests to be readily complete-able (i.e., no long journeys out of your way afterwards), etc.
---
When the planets align, yeah, a dungeon run can be a huge XP boost.  But generally speaking, you're better off to just keep solo leveling.
---
All you have to look at is BFA and Legion launches. Classic is essentially the exact same thing as those, just with OG level 1-60 content. They launched pretty much flawlessly.
---
Hell, BFA was worldwide simultaneous release, and I had 0 issues from 110-120 in a direct rush.
---
Classic will likely have a bit of congestion, but I think it'll be smooth.
---
I think we'll get more info after the 8.2 patch drops,  so maybe in march or April. 
---
Shadow fang keep !!!!! maraudon, lbrs, ubrs. Yes yes yes 
---
Lol I like how this isn't even an exaggeration.  If ur healer or tabk leaves and u happen to have a mage who can port back to a city to recruit a new one... it'll take u hours to finish this place but the satisfaction is gold. 
---
Zul farrak ? 
---
There is space in raids for druid offtanks and a single HOTW druid in a 40 raid. From what you just posted, go druid.
---
&gt;Talents, abilities and items all serve to make your character stronger relative to the content you face. Only making one of the three progressive trivializes the controlling effect it has on power creep. 
---
it will still help. It will still be a positive addition. You won't have to raid through all of MC/ZG/BWL without replacing 80% of your gear that is blue gear from 50-60 dungeons. The only downside i can see is that blizzard will have to allocate dev time to implement it. That's a fair point, but i feel like it's a relatively simple task and important for the health of classic in its first ~1-2 years. 
---
&gt;That's a pretty authentic classic experience, though, and progressive itemization doesn't even come close fixing it. You still end up with things like Gallant's Wristguards (which are a green) being BiS until Naxx. Vanilla itemization was just that poorly thought out.
---
there is a massive difference post 1.10 though. It really can't be compared, as there were so many dungeon blues added/buffed by that point that were better than any raiding gear until AQ40. With progressive itemization there are very very few dungeon items that remain bis for that long, stuff like hand of justice, and to a lesser extent devilsaur set and a few other items. Gallant's wristguard would not be there at launch with progressive itemization but would release ~3 months later. 
---
&gt;I'd have no major issue with the game being dropped in a 1.12 finished state, but I don't really think that would be the best approach. The 4 phase plan they have so far isn't bad.
---
I guess i'll ask you this then, why do you not think its a good idea to release the game with naxx and everything else already available? 
---
To me it's not much different than with progressive itemization. You stagger content to give a sense of progression, as well as for balance reasons. 
---
Scholo, u walk in a bridge pike structure. Enter iron gate. And there is a small lab library area full if mobs, then u progress into different rooms and channels til u get into the deeper labs and ritual sites below for boss fights. 
---
Get a used aeron. Get a used aeron. Get a used aeron. There is no debate. Just get a used aeron. 
---
5 weeks is pretty common in Europe. I've got 6 weeks and 3 days myself that i can spend freely. So yes I'll take some of it to play classic. Not sure yet if I'll plan them at launch or a little bit after launch.
---
&gt; Well the guilds ive been in have been enabling the loot drama
---
Find a new guild then.
---
The first time I witnessed that, I was in Goldshire when my main (priest tailor) was selling bags.  I was so noob at the time, I had not learned about the Auction House, and was   “  /s 6 slot bags, 3s.  8 slot bags, 19s.”  like I was an Enchanter.  LOL. I got really excited when someone paid me a whole gold when they were buying 4 8-slot bags!  Then, someone messaged me, saying to shut up about my bags, and go use the Auction House.  LOL !!!
---
Yeah all the rooms going down does ring a bell. I can't remember the bosses though.
---
My point is, Blizzard didn't do a beta with that patch, it went badly, and they realized they cannot skip patches. Since then, every single major patch and expansion has a beta. It's become a standard operating procedure because of this.

I had to pick and ended up going with early July. Hopefully that’s good enough. We’ll see 
---
"To much of a grind"(MoP) and now we know why you aren't feeling classic. Lol
---
I’ll probably just take off the Friday after it comes out and give myself a 3 day weekend to binge on it. Allows some time for any server issues to resolve and doesn’t give me so much time that I burn out too quickly. 
---
I understand, but I imagine taking work off and my boss being like, “oh yeah you got a fun trip planned?” Unless you aren’t friends with your boss I guess. 
---
Different kind of grind. But yes , I am not found of time gating by grind and exalted farming. 
---
Iam more the skill &gt; time guy. Which is why I prefer Arena about the old pvp system 
---
It's not the expansion system, it's the vertical progressing power creep. Even within vanilla, Naxxramas completely breaks the balance of the game in many private servers and causes a pretty big drop in population.
---
A more flat progression curve could be more fun to some, but apparently a vertical one lets players chase after the carrot on a stick the hardest, and in return, subscribe and give Blizzard their money. 
---
If you haven't looked into it you should check out John Staats "The WoW Diary". It gives a good look at how tight lipped Blizzard was developing vanilla WoW. I'm sure the development infrastructure is different now a days but I'm sure they don't want to give information on things that are subject to change.

---
Our guild leadership consists of players from as far back as WoW Alpha. We're a relaxed group that plays various games together outside of WoW. Every vanilla server we've rolled on has seen us steamroll raids due to our intimate knowledge of the game during the classic era.
---
Many of our members will be pushing for Grand Marshal and leading a ranking pre-made group on whichever server we select at launch. We have reliable leveling paths and help available to those who need extra information to get ahead in classic, and we encourage anyone who is willing to learn to ask our experienced players any questions they have about the game and their class.
---
In our experience some of the best players are recruited as newbie WoW first-timers. And that's great. Classic WoW is the perfect environment to learn how to be a pro raider, if you can find those willing to teach you. Come with a positive attitude and willingness to learn, and we'll help you to become one of our core raiders that pushes content with some of the fastest clear speeds on the server.
---
We're expecting raid days to take place Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights EST. Exact times are yet to be determined, but off nights are eventually planned for alt raids and other optional content. We also recruit bench raiders who don't want, or can't have, a consistent raid schedule, but enjoy being pulled in when a spot needs filled.
---
Outside of raids, we have many players who enjoy a variety of games together. Among these are such games as D&amp;D, Rust, Atlas, CS:GO, Path of Exile, Minecraft, BDO, and more. While not required, we encourage our members to play other games together during content droughts.

Shite. Druids good in PvP and in raids they use HT not HoTs, stopped there.
---
I was going to say exactly this, the last rocky launch I remember was Cataclysm, and that was mostly just issues connecting to the game itself. MoP only had the bottleneck at the stupid fucking gyrocopter quest in Jade Forest. Since then launches have been pretty much flawless.

&lt; xxxxx &gt; is now recruiting for our Classic WoW team! We are a group of experience raiders looking to build a competitive raiding team for classic. We have extensive vanilla WoW experience and plan to be on the cutting edge of raid competition. 
---
Currently our raid times will be set to Tues/Thurs 8pm – 12pm but that will not be set in stone until closer to the release of classic. We expect our raiders to be dedicated and will ask for certain progression requirements to stay a part of our core raiding team. 
---
We will be implementing a DKP looting system as it is the only way to fairly distribute loot amongst 40 raiders. More details will come to the surface as we get closer to the launch of classic. For more information or to apply to the guild, please join our discord server and come chat and play with us up until the release of classic WoW! Look for Casey or Tom and we will get you settled!

Yes, I've got plenty of vacation days off work. More then I know what to do with normally. So this year is the first year I might actually use all off them.
---
Couldn't you just win the special fishing pole first then become a bloodsailer?
---
I don't see why not. I think some people actually grinded it out both ways but I could be wrong. Going bloodsail and then back to Booty bay but idk if the outfits work without the rep?
---
No and I really don't understand why anyone would do that tbh. Classic isn't going anywhere after it's release. Taking time of to get "ahead of the curve" won't mean shit in the long run. 
---
I have to second this. As far as instances go, Scholomance was absolutely beautiful in terms of atmosphere and composition.
---
It wasn't until Karazhan that I felt they had done better.
---
Grandmaster lich below in the bottom, and there is a another lich in the back science room, like a long hallway shaped room tbh lol. 
---
Yeah I love that place. I have a few memories of 3 manning it with some mates (Shaman, Rogue and Mage). We were higher level so all the mobs were green, it was still hard and we only just managed to kill the last boss.
---
zug zug
---
Lacking any sort of context, I'd imagine the reason is that they're not there for honor. They just want to blow some scrubs up, and BG's give them a constant supply of fresh targets.
---
BRD, far and away, ia the one I'm most looking forward to
---
No way. I never played on p servers, but in vanilla, it took a LONG time to get exalted with another race.
---
You won't be able to by 60 for your epic.  It's easier to buy your race's epic mount at 60, then start the grind on a new one.
---
Don't loli the king
---
I had to book my vacation before 15th January.
---
I don't think I hit spot on sadly...
---
A lot of inaccurate or incomplete info here. The race/faction info on a lot of these are clearly just what you prefer, and aren't actually based off racials... ally locks should go human over gnome? Ally warriors should go human, when it has no synergy except some +hit from swords vs. NE dodge? Hunter races are skipped entirely?
---
I mean, some interesting stuff, but very very far from an "ultimate guide" for anything.
---
Gnomeragan.  I know this is one of the most disliked dungeons (which actually surprises me) but I remember being like 12-13 years old and being fascinated by this place.  The mobs, the robot sounds, the wacky elevators.  It will be a super nostalgia overload and I will most likely be playing a gnome so the class fantasy is 10/10 
---
It’s around 121g for warlock 
---
You forgot Shendalar exalted. 
---
Back when he wasn't ashamed to wear cloth!
---
&gt;playing with arrow keys
---
Why would you go gnome as a warlock? 
---
1% dodge lol... Tanking is all about threat now. Tanks are tanking in with DPS gear on and they pop deathwish. This isn't 2007.
---
Forgot the Hunter races tbh xD
---
Biased and gay. Downvoted
---
Shit I knew there was a science room but my brain said it got mixed up with bwl lol
---
Random exploration inside of Ahn'Qiraj?
---
Vacation is for casuals. Quit your job entirely!
---
depends how much runecloth you turn in.
---
If you enjoy rogue (you mentioned Shadow Step, which isn't in classic by the way), and you're interested in faction stories and reputation, then my suggestion would be go Alliance.
---
SI:7, Ravenholdt, Syndicate, great storylines that you will enjoy all the way to 60.
---
Because people liked them, there doesn't have to be any quantum physics type reasoning involved.
---
Some people like retail, they pay Blizzard a sub.
---
Some people like Classic but don't play retail, they currently don't pay Blizzard a sub.
---
Clever man in suit at Blizzard has lightbult moment.
---
Why do you think alliance mages wont have competition?
---
4 days enough 
---
&gt; RIP...
---
I don't get it
---
Did you at least cover July 16th?
---
&gt;WOTLK had the highest pouplation
---
While true, WotLK also stagnated the curve of active subscribers while Vanilla and BC had the curve skyrocketing. In addition, I'd argue a lot of the player count in early WotLK was due to their new Ressurect-a-Friend and Recruit-a-Friend program.
---
&gt;Whats the point?
---
Like in any other recreational activity, the point is to *have fun*. There's no greater meaning.
---
&gt;hopefully classic servers will never upgrade into a TBC server
---
They wouldn't create WoW:Classic only to ditch it. Classic will stay whether or not there will be progressive servers. As for not creating progress at all, have you ever joined a private Vanilla server that has had Naxx on farm for over a year? It's lame. Everything's farmed, everyone got full BiS, the market is inflated and you don't stand a chance anywhere in PvP if you're new.
---
It seems to me that you're more in a "Life is meaningless"-crisis and applies this on WoW. You could likewise argue that Classic is meaningless because in a hundred years it will (most likely) be gone. Games, just like movies, music and the like, is meant to be enjoyed in the moment. Meaning is always subjective.
---
I never said it wasn’t a good idea, just that I didn’t think it would be the best approach. But if I had to give a reason to dislike it, it would be that it skips the AQ war effort events.
---
Same, I have about 25 days to spend this summer and until May to decide when. I don't even know if I need to count saturdays and sunday into those 25 days
---
Weather wasn't implemented until 1.11. This is NOT ACCEPTABLE AT LAUNCH.
---
I would assume this was done using the exploit under first boss stairs that lets you go under the instance and skip to any boss you would like.
---
This is quite a subjective guide, I'm not sure there's much in here that I agree with. 
---
&gt; That was part of the AQ event
---
You are thinking about other turn-ins, for the gate opening.
---
The cloth turn-ins for rep already existed before that. AFAIK they came in on the same patch that brought us Alterac Valley.
---
Of course they get to decide when they own the IP. It's still not piracy.
---
Ofcourse people will be fine. Its just virtual pixels... But that doesnt take away the time invested in the game... 
---
He's talking about another turn in. The cloth ones you talked about existed way before AQ, but I think they won't be in at launch.
---
Gunna go dwarf priest but question about profs while leveling.
---
Is it worthwhile to level tailor + enchant while levelling or should i go the collection route (mining, herb skinning) for the gold and grind the other profs once i hit 60?
---
I'm not a fan of the grind tho...
---
Sometimes an open discussion can bring forth useful things.  Hope you can contribute more in the future.
---
I noticed people not trying the most in AV when I last played on private servers
---
- Horde pugs won most games
---
- a lot of people who don't even like to pvp go there for the rewards
---
- if you actually try, you make the games last longer and people get pissed
---
So you have a lot of raiders yelling at people for not just giving up, because they don't even want to be there.
---
Need to watch the adds like a hawk!
---
There is a staff which gives pernament under water breathing from this instance that I kept the entire game =)
---
Reckoningbomb was a thing in oficial vanilla.
---
So was sitting to proc crit talents. But they removed it soon (way before 1.12). But it was ecentually there, yes.
---
he hosts his own pserver where he plays on and does not stream it. he does not play on a pserver that is hosted or open to the public.
---
Scholo any day of the week, love the fantasy of the plaguelands
---
I think even people who are used to oficial vanilla are in for a surprise. :(
---
That's not how I remember it, but it was over a decade ago I suppose
---
The tricky part is how are you going to decide what personal effort is. Raidloggers that barely speak that are there vs active social people who might miss a raid here and there but contribute to the social aspect of the game? 
---
alright, i think we just have complete opposite ideas of what's right for /fun in classic. Nothing wrong with that, nice chatting with you :) 
---
At least 40 hours a week for warrior? Wtf that’s most people’s work week. 
---
Im not one to abandon ship when the going gets rough but an open dialogue with the actual persons behind the computers is always helpful. 
---
People prefer to roll UD if they want to play Mage, probably because Human males look ridiculous in robes and gnomes look weird in general.
---
They got added in patch 1.5
---
The war effort are different kind of turn ins, with lots of variety on foods etc.
---
The cloth ones may be up even now on retail, so you know that it's not part of war effort (because the war effort ones are not there today)
---
&gt;Please don’t roll a dwarf...
---
I've been called in about a domestic disturbance, and I'm gonna have to take you in buddy.
---
You have the right to remain silent, and anything you do or say can be used against you in the Ironforge Court of Law.
---
Tired of seeing these.. 2005 graphics are not superior in any way to 2019 graphics. I’m sure I will get down voted to hell. The game looks infinitely better now than before. I want what actually made the game great before, and it wasn’t the god damn graphics.
---
I work as a teacher so i'm free from late july to the first week of sept. Hopefully they'll launch it between these times, but it worries me that late sept is still technically considered summer
---
My hopes are that blizzard releases Burning Crusade and Wrath after. So while most people are thinking about what class is good in Vanilla, I’m thinking about the long term and trying not to have so many alts this time around. 
---
Despite some bias I have towards ugly (world of warcraft) races, the rest of the guide is quite objective.
---
I used a Razor Nostromo after a yeah of playing hurt my fingers. However, this device (and every itteration of it) is designed for larger than average hands (for males). So for my slightly smaller than average male hands, a smart use of layout is advised. 
---
In wotlk we raided with dkp and there was a decay system in place. If a player was saving up they would graduatelly lose dkp (in small numbers) to incentivise spending dkp. 
---
100% agree that the loot isnt the main goal for some.  Clearing and progressing is the bulk of the fun.
---
At the same time you are investing time to reach those goals and it feels good to be "rewarded"
---
Warriors are really popular in vanilla while at the same time they struggle with leveling and farming gold AND they have huge repair cost and need to enchant/obtain 2x different sets. It's not worth it to play warrior if you can't play hardcore since you won't be able to keep up with the competition.
---
Warlock pets largely do no damage do to either being phase shifted or sac'd
---
&gt; significant release
---
A fun trip to Azeroth! 
---
Why the hell would the tank pass?? Ironfoe is dumb for threat generation. My MT ran over 200 runs and never got it.
---
&gt;Is honor better if you are only killing people?
---
Probably not. IIRC, most premade groups would try to avoid other premades if they were farming honor for rank 14 because the games would take too long. It's better to just when games in the minimum amount of time than kill people over and over (in part because the more you kill someone the less honor they give). 
---
&gt;Is it more fun to run around/more boring to defend?
---
That's going to differ from person to person. I liked defending, but only if the other faction was adventurous enough to come to the flag room or the resource I was defending in AB, but if not then I typically would try to convince someone else to take over defense so I could go offense.
---
I'm only speaking to my experience in vanilla though, can't speak for pservers. 
---
I'll add that I *agree* that there is a problem, I just disagree with your articulation of it. As Gothic90 formulates it:
---
&gt;It's not the expansion system, it's the vertical progressing power creep
---
How older content (as for PvE dungeon/raids at least) is made mostly obsolete and irrelevant partly because of the level distance, partly because of the loot value distance and partly because of the actual distance; TBC, for instance, introduced an entirely new content where almost all high level characters spend almost all of their time. 
---
which one?
---
Uldaman, no-one? I love how you first can do quests in the outside instance area and badlands proper to prepare you to delve into Uldaman. The dungeon has a cool theme and if you prepared well with James Dungeon guides it has great exp with the quests. The final boss was also a nice challenge which required your group to strategize. There is also some fantastic loot, including crazy rare BOE blues exclusive to Uldaman like Pendulum of Doom and Papel Fez.
---
Almost all abilities have some built in threat, though its probably minuscule - probably less than 100 threat per target. The AoE stun is far more important for a tank
---
&gt; I agree with you about loot councils tho, I don’t like a mob of self entitled elitists deciding if the like me enough to give me loot.
---
&gt; Dkp is the go. You kill the dragon you get the points, you spend the points you get the loot.
---
Fuck, this is so retarded, if the loot council is corrupt, what prevents them from making a corrupt dkp system?
---
All of em. I love dungeons, especially the leveling ones.
---
I think ive done BFD the least so I guess Im looking forward to poppin in there as I level up my shammy.
---
&gt; Of course this is just my experience at a large company, I'm sure everyone's experience is different.    
---
This has been my experience over decades at several large companies.  Knowing what the hell you are doing is great for job security, but never as helpful as being the guy that goes to the same church as the boss or being a shameless ass-kisser.      
---
       
---
/shrug.  at the end of it self respect is priceless.
---
Speaking for myself sometimes I Really want the win and sometimes I just want the kill, depends on my mood 
---
I guess some people are the same, though I will laugh at anyone trying to motivate a group of zergers to play strategically... just join the bashing and get some sweet jumping killing blows /spit 
---
BFA launch was successful on many servers. There was a handful, including mine, that took around 3 days to start being played with any sort of consistency, and about a month and a half to get rid of the .8 second response time on abilities and inventory management. AH took around 25 seconds to go from page to page, and it was like that till I unsubbed. So many servers were fine, but the one I was on was so incredibly messed up that it doesn’t matter as my experience both from a gameplay perspective and from a server stability perspective were atrocious. Even in 2019 blizzard have shown they still can’t handle large servers, so vanilla might be fine for the most part, but huge servers are gonna suck. 
---
They do not
---
I'll stick to my DXRacer chair, it's like sitting on a cloud and has enough memory foam (all in the right places) that it's basically smarter than your average bureaucrat.
---
however, the gaming lineup doesn't seem all that... appealing. stick to DXRacer Work/Wide (if you're on the bigger side, say ~180+ cm and 85-90 kg) or the Formula models (for smaller people) and it's perfect.
---
More impressed that only the 3rd attack hit you.  What are the odds!?  Maybe Priest tank should be a thing. 
---
I raided as a druid. Mostly used rejuv and regrowth to raid heal while pallys healed the tanks.
---
Listening to Judas Priest brings me right back into BWL...I hate it and love it that mucic triggers so many memories
---
Wanna make a Tauren at some point; should I go Shaman or Druid? I like Druid but I'm worried about its limited usefulness at late game. Shaman seems like it might be unwieldy with its keybind issues. 
---
Meh. I’m playing a warrior now and I don’t play hardcore. I love it, but yeah I guess I’m never gonna be like raiding high level content. Don’t plan on it. I have fun in 5 mans and world PvP so that’s good enough for me. 
---
Sunken Temple and BRD.
---
Probably the best dungeons ever created in WoW.
---
Not all of them
---
It’s about the quality of the game, not the graphics.
---
Do you have numbers on this?
---
its really not about what is better or worse. it is about matching the style of wc3. thats what they drew their style from for this game. which it does in quite well. current wow has strayed so far from that style that they are remaking wc3 to match current wow. think about that. 
---
Yeah, like everyone I played with on p servers used to play vanilla retail. Not many people will go to the trouble of playing on a p server without the nostalgia factor.
---
They changed the style of the graphics when they updated them in the modern game. It lost its classic feeling, so in my opinion. Classics graphics are better.
---
You edit the realmlist don't you? 
---
Violating TOS = piracy, deal with it. 
---
Please write "these are my opinions" at the top...
---
I know I'm probably mostly alone in this one, but I actually am REALLY looking forward to Blackfathom Deeps. I honestly love having to swim through certain sections of the dungeon - it makes it feel more like an environment and less like a loot corridor, which is 95% of what I feel has been lost not only in modern WoW, but modern MMO dungeons in general.
---
I just logged in to my old main which had 100 days played in vanilla, 0 major cities at exalted.
---
Sure if you don't mind missing out on like 90% of the game and you just plan to do a couple of 5man dungeons every other day, you can roll whatever. But most people want to raid or/and PvP. 
---
I would not call this ultimate and rather your personal opinion.
---
For the warlock:
---
Soulshards are a none issue in any decent guild that makes group travel mandatory. Even if that is not the case it takes less than 15 mins in total to get full bag of shards and if you use DS here and there as a finisher you do not run out of shards.
---
WoTF isn't as bad to deal with than Paladin cleansing is in premade PvP. For world PvP it comes more into play. And if you are going to be technical the optimal race would be Gnome for Alliance PvP and PvE as it has the only dmg increasing lock racial aswell as Escape Artist and Human have no benefit.
---
Horde you would prob go for Orc if PvP is your niche as that racial is by far more beneficial than not having to face Undeads.
---
Which makes it even more stupid. 
---
Nice avoidance 
---
I've never understood why its one of the most unliked dungeons either.  Its a bit more "playful' than many other dungeons, probably part of the reason I found it fun.  
---
My guess is that mob aggro &amp; patrols drive people crazy and that's why its not enjoyed by some, but if you have a good group at appropriate levels, the place is a gold mine for quests and loot.  
---
I was being sarcastic because the guy I was replying to was being overly dramatic.
---
Is it really just about the graphics?
---
Looking at the picture makes me think about Varian dead now and that I miss him because Anduin is nowhere near as charismatic as Varian was (IMO ofc).
---
Im very excited for Zul'Farrak(Farrek???) switching from leather to mail on my Tauren Shaman maybe getting some cool gear, and being outside!!!!! had good memories there from my pally in vanilla
---
I just PvP pretty much. I played vanilla back in 2004-2005 for a bit, and then quit. 15 years later, I started on pserver. Never did the endgame content, but sounds like you need to put so much time just to get there. I’m content with getting some decent gear from 5 mans at 60 and just world PvP.  That’s fun to me 
---
That's what I did too. But I hit a wall at level 20 when faction imbalance revealed to me that even getting a mob kill or quest item in contested territory was going to be nearly impossible.  I think I'll need to wait for a fresh server to have a chance. In the meantime I'm watching to see any classic developments.
---
Thanks for your advice!
---
I am pretty set on using a Arcanite Champion though, so it sounds like i will be one of the few who pick up swordsmithing haha 
---
Uldaman, my favourite by far!
---
I played wotlk and cata, mostly solo, and that didn't happen to me once in my memory. There's been a very few times I can remember something similar did happen in raids during wotlk, but considering the huge amount of raiding/dungeon puging I did, it really was an incredibly rare issue.
---
Soulshard farming just adds another chores to the many chores of vanilla raiding (consumable farming, pre quests, enchants, reputation etc)  
---
Paladin can cleanse fear from others but you can still fear him and he olny got bule to break it.
---
I said that orc is better for horde but UD look better with robes
---
I personally highly doubt there will be a beta, and things will just get hotfixed or patched after release.
---
My first 40, I remember that run from Orgrimmar to Sen'jin Village to pick up my raptor, mon. The raptor mount was a significant reason I picked troll in the first place so I was stoked, especially with how long it took me to get to 40 as a noob. I ran around in circles with it for an hour like you would if you just got a fresh new car and took it out for a spin.
---
My 2nd 60 was a paladin and obtaining that was not nearly as exciting or memorable...
---
A couple years ago on a pserver I felt super stoked again to hit 40 on a priest because I got Shadowform AND a mount, and the look of that undead mount in Shadowform is something I had wanted since I saw my friend with in 2005
---
Good job turning a completely good discussion political. Please at least read a fucking book on economics before starting this shit.
---
Druid ticks the most boxes. Strong dungeon tank. Shamans can't tank for shit. Paladins are pretty bad, too.
---
Except, charge generates rage. Depending on your spec, you may not have  enough points in tactical mastery to have rage when you switch to defensive stance. So you can either use your rage on Thunderclap, or switch to Def stance and lose it. Thunderclap isn't great threat but it is instant snap threatand reduces healing aggro  and there really is no reason not to use it. 
---
My rotation: Berserker Rage &gt; Battle Stance &gt; Charge &gt; Thunderclap &gt; Defensive Stance &gt; Blood Rage&gt; Demo/Battle Shout &gt; Single Target threat tabbing around.  
---
You want to use your shout from Defensive Stance for more threat.
---
A trip to another world...
---
Yet not 2 days ago a streamer was automatically flagged for a rename by the automatic system.
---
Casting while kiting has something to say about that
---
Every summer you mean?
---
Depends on if they revert shield slam changes, and also if your Mt has thunderfury. If they stick with 1.12 shield slam, I'd go warrior for sure. Both are strong though.
---
Why would you battleshout from Battle Stance instead of Defense Stance? Makes no sense at all. Defensive Stance increases your threat. 
---
No, you are patently wrong.
---
The new graphics were slopped together by lazy corner cutting devs with major clipping issues and wonky run animations.
---
They are in every measurable way inferior in quality with the exception of polygons.
---
Also shaman heals best 5 man healer on horde. 
---
Played a 39 twink back in the day, and this was a crucial item to have. Spent forever camping this mob. 
---
Out of curiosity, why not arcanite reaper? It's way better for warrior.
---
It adds bag management and soulshard management. It is far from a big chore unless you only do pugs as a one of the few locks there and ppl are to mazy to make their way over.
---
My recent experience on a pserver I can count the amount of times I had to go farm shards on one hand and even then it takes 15 min max with travel time included.
---
And the whole WotF thing is overdone. Yes for WPvP it is anoying that you got to use a Deathcoil or othermeans to make room. However for organized PvP it is less an issue than having to face paladins is.
---
I hope my points help you improve your "Ultimate Guide".
---
What software did you use to record the smooth fly-bys?
---
Nah leave wrath out
---
People are trying to max out honor/rep per hour. A quick loss is 'more efficient' than a long hard fought battle where maybe you win, maybe you don't. It's a more efficient option to just take a quick loss and hope you get the quick win next game, or another quick loss, than a really long loss.
---
In the long run, no it won't make a difference.
---
It will be fun though.
---
\-Being 60 while the average player is still like lvl 30 for pvp/ganking. 
---
\-Farming the good spots relatively uncontested 
---
\-Cracking out for a full week
---
\-Being able to help friends that couldn't take a week off by boosting through dungeons etc.
---
In my opinion those things make it worth while.
---
I'm so glad the internet made all these games.
---
Thanks internet!
---
Yes, but the repeatable one isn't unlocked until 50 so you'll be running around on foot unless you buy a ram to start.
---
Also assuming they don't gate the quest as it came out in patch 1.5.
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20060709074947/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?wquest=7800
---
Alternatively at level 49 you could start doing Morrowgrain for Darnassus rep.

---
This meme. I know it's just a shitty meme, and shouldn't be taken seriously, but it's not exactly comparing gameplay, now is it? :P
---
&gt;Say the game comes out on a Tuesday
---
I'm pretty sure Blizz releases all their games on Tuesdays.
---
Deadmines, SM, UBRS, Scholo
---
as significant as classic wow  
---
They're remaking Warcraft III because remasters are a thing for some time now, and Warcraft III is a popular game. I doubt it has anything to do with matching art/graphics styles. 
---
My guild is in AQ and has 0 thunderfuries. Same for most guilds actually. Maybe 1 guild that has each tank in their separate MC PUG run each week and got really lucky has that many thunderfuries. Many guilds will not get TF for years just due to bad luck. Stop talking bullshit.
---
This felt like the first high level instance to me. You got your first end of the talent tree talent, the instance was varied and interesting with tons of different enemies and even starting some of the boss felt like an adventure, and then the fact that fearing someone usually ended up pulling half the instance.
---
The thing is, with Classic there is a situation you can't compare to past patches or expansion, they have never done the "put old data into newish client" process before. Only game you could compare to is StarCraft: Remastered. On the other hand StarCraft is not an MMORPG and SC:R got completely new graphics and sound. 
---
How did they handle SC:R, was there a Beta?
---
Unless Blizzard has a massive open beta stress test then there is no way for them to test what happens when millions of players are connected.
---
Planning on a smooth launch week will have you in a very bad mood come launch week. I expect at least half of current WoW players will at least login and attempt to play on launch week.
---
A lot of this info is subjective and/or irrelevant. 
---
That said, it's entertaining and refreshing to read an honest if flawed review of the classes and races that don't rehash the same 3 points over and over again.
---
So everyone just said generic things. I will try to give some more obscure tips:  
---
1. Always use  shouts (demo/battle) from Defensive stance  for increased threat
---
2. USE CLEAVE - learn to watch your swing timer so you can sneak cleaves in while still tabbing and sundering correctly.
---
3. The cloth helmet from Gnomeregan shoots AoE lightning and is great for a bit more aoe threat on pull. It can be swapped with a plate helmet while the lightning bolt projectile is traveling. 
---
4. Bombs are great for more snap aoe threat but kind of wasteful if you don't have much money:
---
5. Reflection gear: Force Reactive Disk, Shield Spike, Razor Gauntlets, Essence of the Pure Flame, Nagelring, Drillborer Disk. Stacking as much of this as you can really helps. The guy who said shield spike doesn't make a difference is wrong. It is the best enchant for your shield. Mayb Block % on Force Reactive. 
---
6. If you are in a zerg/ strong group. Mark a skull and don't tank it at all. Some Rogue or warrior will take aggro but it will die so fast it won't matter. In the mean time, you can build up threat on the rest of the mobs without worrying about dps stealing threat on them. If necessary you can taunt this mob back to you and be at the same threat as the rogue who dpsed it initially.
---
7. Rage pots can be very helpful.

8. Pulling fast and with full rage allows you to put alot more threat into the mobs. Same goes for pulling while your dps is still finishing off the last pack. Gives you a window to build threat while the dps goes ham.Try to save rage at the end of packs instead of blowing it on aggro that you don't need.   
---
9. Ask the dps to wait until you sunder a mob a few times if you are unable to do 6). 
---
10. If you can't charge, then bow pull yourself. Don't have a hunter or mage pulling for you it makes the whole thing alot harder since they aren't targeting you initially and you get rage starved. 
---
Any of the raids. While I did all dungeons "level appropriate" in TBC/Wrath, I never played in Vanilla, so didn't do the raids. 
---
Lol 20 fps by yourself. Your potatoe was slightly better than mine at the time.
---
Yes, sc remastered had a beta.
---
Will look into this JWT and report back. Lots of bugs to fix and this one is noted down on my list too.
---
I am reluctant to reveal my master plan haha, but i want to try out some self-sustain healing shenanigans with the valor/heroism set bonus, plus the arcanite champions proc with crusader healing, and darkmoon card heroism + hand of justice all working together. 
---
no idea how it will go but i want to try it come classic! 
---
&gt;The new graphics were slopped together by lazy corner cutting devs with major clipping issues and wonky run animations.
---
I cant think of anything more lazy than the copy pasting they did for classic Anduin's model.
---
Yeah that is what bugged me the most about private servers, I have no idea how it was back in the day. I can live with the defeatists that just give up, I guess its part of war, i can also barely live with the farmers just fishing away or killing mobs that is no help to the battle (for gold or for exp). I asked a guildy that was farming and he really did not care about our faction, the battle or whatever. He was there to get the reputation and level at the same time, which i can completely understand.
---
But fucking calling people to stop fighting and just giving up to make it quicker? That sucks all kind of fun out of the entire escapade
---
I loved the different ways you could contribute to AV, I really hope the backdoors are completely removed and the elites + upgrades are worth it, aswell as a few hours long battles that **is worth it**, reputation wise atleast. 
---
CRZ =/= Sharding.
---
CRZ = fill the zone with people in the same server bracket. -&gt; to few players
---
Sharding = split zones into multiple instances so people from the same server get spread out -&gt; to many players
---
Blizzard only mentioned sharding, they didn't talk about cross realm zones.
---
Because I'm fun at parties
---
I'm actually thinking of doing the same. I want to take two weeks off (fortunately, in my case, a 2-3 weeks notice beforehand should suffice, so no pressure for a release date), but I don't know if I should from week 1. Even with sharding and what not, I still expect it to be pretty hard to play. 
---
Whatever floats ur boat my man
---
It shouldn't add threat if the party member already has the buff. BS threat was never that good in Classic. In Classic TC was the best spell for group aggro but you ran the risk of being stomped cause you had to be in Battle stance to drop TC.
---
This is just another one of those things private server people are going to be bitching about when Classic releases, if Blizzard gets everything right.
---
WoD? At least I had unplayable lag for a few days, and at least a few days, if not a week or more, of sometimes being unable to enter the garrison (which may have just been the server's way of warning us to stay away from it :D )
---
Thanks bud
---
Someone posted this like 2 days ago, but with the proper Jaina and not Drake.  Try harder young padawan.
---
Really now? WoD is the only expansion I didn’t play on launch, so I can’t attest to that one
---
I don't need to give a reason. If it comes up in conversation, I won't hide the real reason. Everyone already know I'm a dork, no need to lie that I'm doing some normie stuff xD
---
Graphics?  Sorry, when I see this I think of the 4+ years that Anduin was a child in that model as opposed to the grown up one... not the graphics... the age of the character.
---
Pserver players might be wrong but this sub can also be clueless due to lack of pserver knowledge, as evidenced by this post and many. Pservers do not get their data from ClassicDB. Likewise ClassicDB does not get its data directly from pservers. Making a statement about one does not make something true about the other. Classic bowhead is not authoritative either. 
---
By OP using the 'evidence' he did, he lost all credibility even if he may be right about pservers not being accurate. 
---
a) I'm sorry you're leveling holy. Ret can heal well while leveling and put out a lot more damage
---
b) If you are firm on staying holy, level Seal of Righteousness, ignore the rest for now, especially in a duo.
---
c) righteous fury is 100% useless while leveling with a warrior. Feel free to skip it, along with additional ranks of redemption.
---
BUT... you should have 0 gold issues 1-60 since you don't need 100g for mount at 40. Train all the things.
---
No opinion on warrior talents.
---
I did the same as a Tauren with Orgrimmar [pic](https://img.photobucket.com/albums/v39/Pirwzwhomper/WoW/EpicMount.jpg)
---
I'll take cata (especially early cata) over wrath any day.
---
I you're on a populated server you shouldnt have a problem with money by using the auction house as you level. I would say one of you get skinning/herbalism and the other get mining/enchanting or some other combo and you'll be good on funds. 
---
My first cross rep was getting a horse for my gnome mage in classic :D 
---
Lived in scarlet monastary for over a month just for the silk drops... good times!
---
Dkp is my solution.
---
This made my day xD
---
"Screw you guys, I'm going home."
---
I'm going to play approximately 8 million hours of WC3R - but SC:R wasn't a big success, and original world of warcraft is the most successful video game in history. Blizzard's expectations ought to be very different.
---
In Ryan's Mod you can be a night elf on the outside and Horde on the inside. I just posted a video on youtube if you want the link i will send it to you.
---
&gt; Unless Blizzard has a massive open beta stress test then there is no way for them to test what happens when millions of players are connected.
---
...seriously?  So the last 15 years of running the world's largest MMO gives them no knowledge or experience about this?
---
Like your contribution that you clearly haven't thought about at all, but decided to post anyway?
---
It's difficult to have a discussion about the subject and take it seriously when you hold this particular opinion.
---
You can get a sword in Sunken Temple that summons whelps on attack but ultra rare.
---
I hated that piccolo. I always tried to win it just so I could throw it away.
---
I won't comment on the corruption thing, if I can make something instant I'll make instant, I'm a lazy bastard.
---
Though I will say that I'd just level as affli, so no level 45 :)
---
I haven’t been able to take a private server seriously since the nost shutdown. Had an account easily worth marketing at $1,000, would never sell it but it’s tough seeing something you worked so hard for gone in a matter of hours. At least we had like a ~12h warning before the shutdown. Waiting patiently for something that won’t get deleted. 
---
No specific memory about level 40, but I do have one from around 50. It's also not from Vanilla, but from TBC :D 
---
I remember playing a paladin, and knowing nothing about how to spec. I was a weird hybrid between holy and... something else, don't even remember. I abandoned the character, and came back to it much later when I knew more, respecced full retri and got crusader strike, and felt like the character had new life.
---
As for chair I have a Herman Miller Aeron and highly recommend it. I'm actually thinking of buying a 2nd one to take to work.
---
It's also pretty important to me to have a standing option as well. I bought a Jarvis standing desk a few years ago. It's really great being able to sit or stand whenever you want without having to have some goofy varidesk-style contraption cluttering up the desk.
---
Wow great analysis! I can see the problems you bring up and i just posted a video on youtube about my ideas to change Classic into the best game ever.
---
Vanilla and BC without Outland zones.
---
Relationship just ended, I'm ready to commit to this.
---
It is the same though, the game allows both. If you don't like the rules the game sets out then either don't play or try and get them changed.
---
Probably won't hear anything until March.
---
I doubt Blizz will do a full beta and let everyone play the entire game in one sitting. I'd expect them to release beta stages with different zones like in demo.
---
Considering they have the full original 1.12 client running locally to check everything, a beta may not be needed. 
---
I will agree that giving us the cold shoulder for the past 2 months isn't very reassuring about the release.
---
I believe the model is Racing pro r131. 
---
Nope, with my guild we skipped all optional bosses, but during raid time I had no chance to explore the whole raid and bosses, so I did it on my free time. We where stucked at twin emperors, but thanks to mind vision I was able to see C'tun itself. Great joy for a little teenager noob. :D
---
A real test to see how much gaming my gf can put up with before she leaves me. I've got one ace up my sleeve. Have her playing with me.

When i used to run pre made AB runs back in vanilla. we tried winning as fast as posible. Most puggs are just way to uncoordinated .

Admitedly, I am.
---
Probably the second week Classic launches, so once I get out of the starter zone and the first week of inevitable server crashses passes, I can spend the 9 days being a no life. At least that will help me get the urge to play 24/7 our of my system so I can go back to being a semi-functional human being and still play after.
---
My plans for Classic took a drastic hard left recently. My plan was to take 2 weeks off work and power through to 60, then play semi casually building up gold and prebis till I could get a raid spot and then raid and PVP semi-hardcore. Not that interested in Naxx, but at least wanted to do AQ40 and some world bosses. Found out my wife's due date for kid #2 is right around the Classic release. This is going to change everything (obviously irl), but also my choices in game. Going to play a different class to make sure I can get a raid spot, and getting to 60 is going to take quite a bit longer now than i planned
---
Honestly, after the initial quest run. I wouldn't dwell on stocks too much. Theres just so little going on in there. Yeah the run is quick, but the XP is so low and theres little to no gear you can get unless you catch the occasional rare. 
---
Also keep in mind that deadmines is great filler to get you out of westfall and can also net you a level or two, and believe me some of the gear you get in there LASTS. 
---
my first character was allways a disappointment for me. lvled up a rogue, didnt know much of the game. hard to solo stuff. and getting to 40 just felt like a drag since i had to farm even more for my mount and ofc i had every spell rogues had to that point ( stupid idea ). 
---
Then i lvled my priest and that was a much nicer experience. Im hoping to experience my priests experience more than my rogues :P

What does meeting with the 'bobbs' mean? 
---
Racing chairs AKA "gaming" chairs are modelled after car chairs.
---
Their bucket seats are designed to stop sideways movement when turning a car. It adds little in the way of comfort and can actually be detrimental to your health and posture during long gaming sessions as it locks you into a limited set of positions.
---
-
---
Typically anything marketed as "gaming" will have a high price, low(er) quality and full of gimmicks.
---
A higher end, ergonomic design, office chair will be much better bang for your buck and better for your back too.
---
Also, almost everything at IKEA is low quality, high price.    
---
As someone who builds furniture for a living, I couldn't advise against their products more.    
---
(I couldn't recommend the stuff we make either. But we sell to schools, so it's a different story.)
---
Damn, now that looks badass!
---
I had a kodo on my Orc as well, really hated the wolves. The ugliest mount on horde side imo. Dont think I had the epic mount, did have an epic wolf.

Don't mind me, I'm just here to reveal to you the existence of [imgur.com](https://imgur.com)

I never did this in vanilla, my friend grinded out TB on his ALT orc though, the crazy guy.

Will be playing dwarf in classic, so probably getting a nightsaber :o

nothing wrong with that. I told my boss last vacation I was going to stay at home in my house coat and play video games all week. He laughed lol 
---
Coke or *coke*?
---
NOT Gnomeregan. I hated it!
---
Looking forward to deadmines und ubrs!
---
&gt; and believe me some of the gear you get in there LASTS.
---
Definitely varies class by class, and I post some basic math so everyone can gauge it for themselves. For me (paladin) the only real thing of value is the quest reward pants, but they only end up being like a 1dps increase. I'd rather not 'lose' an hour of prime speedleveling time to run a dungeon that will drop pants that will gain me four minutes of faster kills over the next 10 levels, ya know?
---
It lets them do the prep work over the prior week/weekend, final checks on monday, and then gives them the rest of the work week to play reactively with the patch/launch.
---
Out of all the things to complain about Blizzard, their content launch sprint is not one of them.
---
True true. Classes like Rogues should 100% make the trip in though. Otherwise very informative and useful info. 
---
Office Space is a movie and in it are two consultants, both called Bob.  In this scene Peter is referring to having a meeting with both of the consultants. 
---
Yeah we're on a very populated server right now. I play the ah a lot and I know I wont have to come up with 100g for me at lvl 40, but this is sort of a trial run to get things ironed out so Im just trying to figure out things I need to do when classic servers go live. We will likely level gathering profs on live servers but were just kind of fucking around right now, not really trying to level super fast. I just wanted to cut out spending money on abilities that are 100% unnecessary until later levels.
---
Thanks for the advice man
---
Now that's a very good question. Assuming rep works the same as pvp ranking (you unlock x but later drop in rank, you can still use it) then it might just work.
---
I believe you can do similar things in professions, for example, gnomish and goblin engineering, you can make the exclusive items and switch sides and still use whatever you made on the previous one (but it's suuuper expensive to basically level it 2 times to 300).
---

See this info graphic for priest racials.
---
Ultimately determine what is best for your playstyle, but for alliance: Dwarf is the clear winner.  For horde: Undead.
---
Who could afford mounts at 40? I killed turtles till level 43 before I could afford it.
---
Vanilla  - WotLK is my dream. I'd be able to retire from gaming after that.
---
:)
---
Yes! I was one of the first gnomes on my sever to get a horse. So worth it 😊
---
&gt;what memories do you all have from hitting level 40?
---
This was a long time ago, but I remember being completely surprised by mount costs. I'd seen people on mounts, and asked about it, and so i knew that they'd be unlocked at 40...but it never occurred to me to ask about price. Pretty sure I'd given up on trying to buy every skill by that point, but apart from that gold hadn't really been a huge problem up until then, so I I'd been regularly buying gear and profession materials and not exactly saving for anything and didn't have nearly enough for a mount.
---
But I was a druid, and I'd been using travel form extensively for most of my playtime at that point, so it wasn't a huge problem. I remember doing an AV match where I was one of maybe three people in the entire group without a mount, and I stopped doing battlegrounds for a while because I felt bad about it.
---
I think I managed to have the gold by level 43 or so without going out of my way to farm for it. I just stopped spending money and kept playing regularly.
---
&gt;Are you planning to try and recreate how you dinged level 40 back in the day
---
No.
---
&gt;What are you most looking forward to about level 40 - the big talent, the mount, or something else?
---
Not really looking forward to 40 as a significant milestone. I know it's coming this time. I don't think it will be a big deal.
---
This may sound stupid, but I just really like consecration and I want those mana returns on spells asap without having to respec. So Im fully aware that I am gimping my potential dmg, but between the two of us we kill stuff relatively quickly so I just wanted to try out the holy talents for now. I very well may go ret when live servers release depending on certain factors.
---
Im glad to see that righteous fury is indeed worthless to me. I pretty much only use SoR right now and it seems decent so I'll stick with it.
---
Im aware that I don't have to have 100g at 40 so Im more or less going to help funnel gold into keeping my warrior's weapon updated since that is very important for them.
---
Do you have an opinion on the usefulness of seal of light/seal of wisdom while leveling?
---
Thanks for your advice btw
---
Meh, it's really not that. This is typically the thoughts of Someone who hasn't played vanilla. Sure while leveling you'll probably look a bit mismatched.
---
Either that or I've been playing vanilla so much that now the mismatched stuff looks so normal that it now matches. I can only ever think of warriors being alittle mismatched though.
---
I did the same as a Human with NE saber. Good job mate!
---
Disappointed isn't the right word, but I am surprised that we haven't got any news.
---
What does BC without Outland even mean?
---
Why would they test naxx in the beta and hold off releasing yhe game when naxx wont be released for quite a long time?  Quite a few flaws on your math, buddy.
---
How about a Dwarf with a robot chicken

Hahahaha. The one u drunk . Coca cola 😅

Would have been the Morrowgrain to Darnassus quest (or Morrowgrain to Feathermoon Stronghold). I do know there was a Gnome who did it early in Vanilla, but I don't recall their name or the realm they were on. Only Darnassus, Thunder Bluff, Stormwind, and Orgrimmar had original repeatable quests that gave reputation. But the ones for Darnassus and Thunder Bluff could be done at level 60 for the full gains. The Stormwind and Orgrimmar ones were lower level and needed to be grinded intentially at lower levels in order to maximise reputation. I do know there was a Night Elf named Galdian that got Exalted with Stormwind for a horse this way. I guess in a way you could say it is possible for those factions (though Orgrimmar's requires killing mobs, so you'd eventually outlevel the optimal quest level range)
---
I believe they work on Goblins, but are useless against the robots.
---
Shut up and heal me!
---
Nice!
---
I remember the first time I saw an undead on a Raptor (a character Zol, one of the first R14 characters on our server and in the US IIRC) and I knew I had to have one. 
---
Fortunately I got to rank 11 and got one, not sure what would've been faster though, grinding to rank 14 or collecting cloth but i was happy regardless. 
---
Im 100% the opposite. As tauren there is just no cooler mount than the unarmored wolves. As tauren they also have the just the right movement pattern. As undead and orc the wolves move to fast and look jerky. As tauren they look epic!
---
Because I wasn't normally speced into tactical mastery so when I switched stances I'd lose the rage from the charge, so might as well do a shout as I switch. Some threat &gt; loss of rage to no gain.
---
Married, one 4 year old and a second kid due in a month.

I'm screwed and should be 60 by 2020. Maybe spring 2020.

---
Lol the downvotes. Babies confirmed.
---
Also why waste and ruin only two years of my twenties when I can go for 6.
---
Cata but no farther than Firelands, just bc robocop warrior pvp tier is best forever
---
Balanced classes, heroic dungeons, more focus on max level stuff in general. 
---
As a paladin, you don't need 100g at 40! But be prepared to start farming for your quest items for lv 60, which will be around 800. 
---
You tell me the artists name and I'll buy it from him.
---
I first hit level 40 on a night elf rogue, Rogek. A guildie, who was leveling an alt with me, spotted me the gold to get my mount.
---
Later that week, a friend of mine from school told me that he had rolled on a different server, Balnazzar. A rolled up a human mage over there figuring I'd maybe play him some. The mage wound up becoming my main and I never touched the rogue again. Still feel a little guilty about never paying back the gold.
---
Lol playing a warrior not really. Don’t want to drive myself insane 
---
I don't know if people think those goals are attainable.  Like, holy shit.  Grind rank 14 while farming rep in two different factions.  3 if you count the Brood rep grind for Scepter.
---
This man has some pie in the sky dreams.  Good luck, traveler.
---
commenting for later thanks!!
---
If you havent pirated anything before and you get cought by your isp doing it occasionally they wont give a shit and just send a warning.
---
You could pay for a proxy server to avoid this. Dont get a free one because while they might hide you from your isp theyre shady and likely to fish for your info.
---
Or you can just not play it and let me have the main game I'm after in this whole classic thing.
---
This should be 3 dancing ghost wolves to be truly accurate.

gimme some of that

Your welcome

Oh..private servers not allowed here?
---
stockades is my favorite instance
---
Vanilla with balanced talents, pvp, and gear from tbc or wotlk is my dream mmo.
---
First, office chairs don't cost $30k.  They don't even cost $3k.
---
There's really no physical difference between PC gaming and standard office work, so a chair designed for one task would be equally suitable for the other.  Further, the market for office chairs is orders of magnitude larger and more mature than the market for gaming chairs; this translates to more R&amp;D, more competition, and higher quality products.
---
YAAAAAS!
---
I want all 3.
---
I'll repeat the saga over and over again.
---
Like I did with Star Wars.  Before the Dark Times.  Before the Special Editions.
---
I remember worrying my very christian boss was going to ask what my off days were for when I was going to see Slayer in Dallas last year.
---
I haven't played retail in a couple years. Is this really a thing? No troll, reality?
---
WTF is wrong with Activision and people in general? It's like everyone was raised as a single child and never had an older brother pound on them or a little sister bug the crap out of them.
---
I really hope this isn't a thing in Classic because it could easily be something that drives me away. No reports save botting and hacking, no loot trading, no changes. Let the community handle social (lawl) justice.
---
I too had an Undead Rogue with a Kodo. I just remember it taking weeks and weeks of cloth turn-ins. Worth. Going for a kitty for my human warrior this time around. :)
---
Same thing goes for melee classes. A ton of warrior spells only require rank 1
---
Scepter is from the AQ questline for bug mount, edgemaster are very good BoE gloves for warrior, usually cost around the same price of an epic mount.
---
Ooh of course - though it does make rp more inclusive for players after all we already have people regularly mock us for our form of enjoyment just look at one of the responders to me.
---
YOLO 
---
Less of a PVP focus in Vanilla - the only thing to do is BGs,AV, and world pvp.  So you can enjoy doing PVE and PVP at the same time. Not like TBC+ where you need to farm resilience gear. 
---
I'm going to take the week after release off, just in case there are any issues with login servers or whatnot.  Will still be playing hardcore that first week just in my off work time but I for sure will be going hard in the paint on this game.  It's something I loved so much 
---
Yeah there's more quality exploration and fun to be had with the quests in the world anyways. I'd rather travel to sfk, wc or bfd than run this place over and over
---
* If you find you're not using something, stop training ranks in it.
---
* If you're okay with not upgrading something (like you are with Redemption), stop training ranks in it.
---
* If you look at an ability and think "I won't ever use that" or "I won't use that until 60" then skip it
---
* If you look at an ability and think "I don't need it yet" or think "it's not enough of an upgrade" then skip it
---
I leveled a hunter recently, and I found abilities fell into 3 tiers for me:
---
1. Skip
---
2. Get whenever you're in town
---
3. Immediately go back to town to skill up (Mend Pet and Growl topped this list)
---
These are, of course, rules of thumb.  If you find you have plenty of money, go ahead and buy the abilities.  If you find you're poor, go ahead and only get the abilities you absolutely will get the most use out of.  
---
you dragged a poor paladin down there?
---
Not truly classic, but I ran my Belf to Lordaeron to level her up Forsaken so when I got 40 I got the Forsaken mount. 
---
Thx!
---
I've taken time off for wow expansions, game launches etc.   
---
Anytime the game involves online requirement (such as wow) it never pays off. Server issues, floading of the starting leveling zones, game breaking bugs, or even burnout because I spent 3-7 days just straight playing it.   
---
It's never worth it. Don't do it. You're losing both time and money. You should just stay at work at the times you're scheduled, make that extra money, put it towards more enjoyable meals the times you are playing classic wow. If you want something delivered,  you made more than enough to cover it that day at work. If you order food and you take time off work, you lose money no matter what.  
---
Now lets say you have paid time off. Most companies I've worked for don't give paid time off to cover every single holiday and say maybe a week around christmas &amp; other holidays. I'm not sure where you're from, but if it's the USA having a week off around christmas is enjoyable.   
---
If you REALLY insist on taking time off for classic, let it be a time when you can guarantee yourself you will be able to login without any issues at all. After the launch hype, maybe mid leveling, or at 60.   
---
Just understand, if you do it for launch, and you do take time off, you will regret it. I promise. It never goes smoothly. BFA had made major connection issues. In fact the ONLY expansion where I didn't have any kind of launch issues, was Legion. Even then there was queues, but not for my server. BFA I didn't have personal issues either but I heard a lot less issues for Legion rather than BFA.  
---
But look at TBC, or Wrath, or Cata, or MoP, even WoD.   
---
It never...goes...well. Don't do it.
---
I want to see what they come up with, and test it out in Beta before I make the decision to play when it goes live. Will there be loot trading or RCR, sharding etc? Many things are still unanswered that could have an impact on the community. I don't want classic content wrapped in a retail experience.
---
Naaah dude Peninsula, Zangarmarsh, Nagrand and SMV were the absolute goat zones. Just scrap flying mounts and gg
---
lmao "is there something else you'd rather be doing?" 
---
you really ask me if theres anything else id rather be doing than sucking the dick of the masters wage slavery? 
---
1. It is only horrible in a hardcore raid setting if you like to fight for #1 on the meters.. and even then there are a couple fights that you can have high dps and top the meters in depending on circumstances... but to me that feels empty since you are fully aware the only reason youre on top is because of Feign Death allowing you to cheese aggro reset mechanics or ranged-only fights and stuff like that. Sounds to me though like you will be playing a lot of solo time and for that, hunter is a great class. The DPS is just fine and any concern over the amount of DPS in a 5 man dungeon is meaningless. People will still bring you for trapping/pulling/kiting and most of the time the group will already have a rogue or warrior and he will prefer to not have a 2nd duplicate class since thats extra competition for the drops they want (assuming you dont try to roll on melee BiS gear and such, this is all very specific depending on which dungeon etc etc)
---
2. Yes, I would say so. I think you are making a good choice in hunter because you will be able to do a lot of cool stuff solo, including kiting world bosses into towns and fighting tougher mobs solo via kiting mechanics much better than other classes. You can also farm a lot better.. Warriors will generally rely on tanking 5man DM East Jump Runs to make money off the Thorium veins at the end, or doing other sorts of mining/profession type money making.
---
3. I have never played horde so I dont have personal experience there, but everything I wrote above is based on years of experience both on retail and pservers. From what I know about the game though, you will be able to burst mobs down but you will likely have mana issues and have to stop and drink a lot, while the hunter would be able to keep farming just fine even when completely oom
---
Hope that helps! I think Hunter would be a good choice and personally I might do the same when classic rolls around, as I have been the meter whoring fury and rogue in a past life and have similar life circumstances as you these days haha. So if I do play, I will definitely not have the time to tryhard like I have before.
---
Thats another thing too... as a hunter, you can Feign Death and save a ton of money on consumables. As a tryhard #1 dps warrior one of my pet peeves was when someone ELSE (not even myself) would fuck up and wipe the raid, and cost me hundreds of gold in consumables while I watched the hunters just Feign and laugh it off. 
---
The worst part was when hunters would mess up the jump-skip in the beginning of Molten Core speed runs by forgetting to dismiss their pet, wipe the entire raid, and waste literal thousands of gold and hundreds of hours that the entire 40 man raid spent farming, since we would go the whole 9 yards and get world buffs and songflower and all that for the entire raid prior to running. So make sure if you go hunter.. never do that! hahaha Good luck and happy hunting!
---
&gt; I'd rather travel to sfk, wc or bfd than run this place over and over
---
BFD is next on my list! It'll likely get a positive mark for Gravestone Scepter - but we'll see how it all turns out. WC and SFK will get a pass, no Alliance quests :(
---
Thanks for this, I like the intricacies of things like FD-&gt;FT and FD-&gt;Gnomish Army knife :)
---
I could live without wrath
---
My Top Ten list of possible answers to this question:
---
1. I think the biggest thing is people get distracted.  They see an enemy, they need to defeat the enemy.  That's why WSG has everyone fight in mid, and AB has everyone fight at the intersections.
---
2. Players get bored sitting on a flag.  They don't mind defending if the flag is being attacked, but they don't want to just sit there and wait.  I've done several ABs where I sit at a flag and do literally nothing the entire game.  I'd get virtually no honor, despite the fact that I was doing my job.  Later Blizzard added honor ticks for defenders as you got resources to balance it out.
---
3. Go with the crowd.  You have a much better time doing stuff when it's 8 vs 8 than when you're alone at a flag and 3 people come up.
---
4. They're more interested in meters (topping damage and kills) than winning.
---
5. They're more interested in fighting than objectives.
---
6. They expect to be carried.  If they fight, then someone else can win the BG.
---
7. They feel their "distraction" is helping win.  (I'm guilty of this one, although I think I was right).  If you take a 3-man group and hold up 6 enemies in mid, that leaves it as a 7-v-4 for the flags in WSG or a 12-v-9 for the flags in AB.
---
8. They are just stupid and have no concept of strategy.
---
9. They were on their way to an objective and met the enemy.  Attempts to escape are hampered by snares, roots, and stuns, so you might as well fight.
---
10. Because last time you did the objectives and nobody helped you, so you're paying it forward.
---
Sounds pointless. Bandages are enough for Rogues from my experience. 
---
I leveled a shaman to 54 in 2.0 and I played some demo and played some pserver. Without DW - shaman leveling would seem even worse. 2h WF sounds fun though...
---
I'm more about novelty when leveling. I level priest alot so gravestone is absolutely a must have
---
What about warrior solo runs at max level? Do they still need a pocket healer or can I potentially go double Crusader DW Fury and kill some stuff? Obviously if I'm willing to tank, groups shouldn't be a problem but it's just something I was wondering after reading your post. Thanks for the detailed response, I'm definitely leaning warrior atm.
---
One thing people never take into consideration is that trying to do a double-collecting on a fresh start server (classic wow) is insanely hard.  Bag space is at a premium and its usually awhile before you start to get good size bags in all slots.  The last thing you want to do is clog your already small available space with double the collection of materials...
---
Not saying it's not a good method for money making, but its far better in an established environment where you can feed your alt bags.
---
the class fantasy translation from wc3 shaman/far seer to wow was a massive failure.  at least paladins had a spec dedicated to smacking things with a hammer and going invincible.  shaman didnt even have their most iconic ability.  
---
and the voices in the inns, you couldn't make out what they were saying but it made them sound more alive and immersive
---
Good point didnt think of that. Will roll ench and tailor
---
Yes, I already knew that the rep on private servers was off from the majority of retail Classic. I remember full well trying to get rep in vanilla and it took absolutely forever.
---
There are many differences on private servers when it comes to the match and mechanics conversion. The greatest difference is just having the changes and population for the 10k+ servers. It's those players who will be shocked at how different Classic will play. Those players think that less than 5-6k players on a server are a "DAD server"  ... as they say.
---
I can't state this enough: I look forward MOST the more balanced and mixed community Classic will bring because private servers have become very, very stale with the typical core audience and I've lost interest in being part of that community after nearly 3 years of participating. 
---
Classic isn't just about Blizzard reclaiming the rights to the game, it is about them reclaiming a unified Wow audience again under a version of Classic balanced more toward it's retail meta over the private server meta. I look forward to all the little changes but certainly hope core functionality isn't lost anywhere.
---
iirc, the best 19 twink rogue chest was the one from Van Cleef's head quest if you were alliance, and the chest that drops off Van Cleef if you're horde
---
Yup -- confirmed and it will also highly depend on how tryhard your guild and tanks are. If they go impale spec and wear some threat pieces and such you will have a much higher threat ceiling to work with. So if you are not planning on being in a super hardcore guild, rogue may be a better choice.. while if you ARE going to be a hardcore meter chaser, you will overtake equal-skilled rogues once you start getting good gear late BWL-ish
---
That's my team!
---
I think a short, quick flight (15 seconds) that works similarly to zone abilities in Warlords would be interesting. However, it'd have to be unusable in combat so that you can't escape pvp. That way, you could use the ability to get to the areas that are only accessible via flying without having to completely change the zone maps.
---
Well you do you, but if you're gonna be snarky with people don't be surprised if they hit back. Especially when you're being snarky with them for doing something that... isn't even wrong to do.
---
I'm also a teacher, but my wife is due to give birth around September so I'm going on parental leave anyways. At least I'll have something to do on those sleepless nights hahaha
---
What was it? I never played
---
You can keep the Wrath copy
---
Maybe spirit weapon or items with spirit/Stam swapping for items with agi/stam. 
---
You are right about losing stamina and therefore re-equipping the stamina item would cause you to remain at low hp
---
I specifically asked you not to play it ffs
---
&gt;Didn't happen to me, so it didn't happen.
---
Happened to me, quite often. Trying to get trinkets in Cata from dungeons was a particular pain in the ass.
---
&gt; more focus on max level stuff in general.
---
That's bad for the game
---
&gt;We're running the dungeon at level 25, since one quest prereq, Dark Iron War requires 25.
---
What? Nobody does that quest at 25 mate, so leave the whole "speedrunning" out because you're going SLOW if you include that. 
---
No one actually does this. Bag space is more important than tiny regen benefit. 
---
There's a huge difference between saying "Didn't happen to me, didnt happen at all" and saying "I personaly barely ever experienced it even though being in the perfect position to experience it a lot, so it most likely wasn't super common like the other guy implied". I never said it didn't happen, just that it wasn't rampant and happening all the time.
---
I got the undead mount on my belf too, but didn't know to level in tirisfal.  So i got the +3% run speed boots from AB and went like that til the early 50s when i could turn in runecloth.  Never got one of those stupid turkeys though, so it was worth it.
---
Yea but it wouldn't necessarily be that bad.  It's widely recognized that WOTLK was the last great expansion.  It's also when a lot of people think the game should have ended TBH since it culminates the Arthas storyline.  Consequently it was also the period of highest peak concurrent subscriptions I believe?  After that it was downhill...
---
Holy shit, that's really neat
---
&gt;In this video about leveling a rogue back in vanilla, the guy advised to have spirit gear in order to switch it with main gear thanks to an addon (outfitter).
---
Not back in Vanilla, it's a private server guide by a private server player. 
---
Nah, I'll definitely be surprised when someone says I should kill myself after I tell them that they're making life difficult for other players.
---
Call me fucking madman, but Dire Maul is my jazz
---
Also Maraudon, Deadmines, SFK
---
... and Blackfathom Deeps, hell yeah
---
Classic Warlock trinket does not break stun, so this guys got the right idea. 25% stun resist is huge.
---
Today I prefer small mounts (mechanostrider) but back in Vanilla I had the Frostsaber on my gnome mage (was my 1st priority when I hit 60, didn't care about gear)
---
All day 'err day.
---
Warrior checking in. You are going in with the assumption that everyone wants to be a uber leet DPS'er, and it comes through in your assessment. Some of us aren't just fine and able with tanking. We love to tank. It is an art and a way of life within the game. 'You will have to tank.' is not a Con on a true 'ultimate guide'.
---
You also assume everyone is going for raid spots on top raiding guilds to amass all their BiS. I flat out don't have time to raid. I know many will be looking forward to raiding, and that's great for those. Every server will need some good raiding groups and every server will have them. But I know there are also a lot of us that won't be able to due to time constraints. We'll have plenty of fun in 5-mans or other small group activities. In general, I wouldn't make such hard distinctions of pro's, con's and 'when should I roll warrior' based on their raid status, as that will not apply to everyone. such a guide would be more based on the role(s) the player wants to play.
---
I say all this taking your 'ultimate guide' concept at face value, and not assuming it was a tongue-in-cheek comment for a personal class selection guide.
---
And a minor thing.. I really hate the tier gear for warriors. The choice between a porcupine or a mobile axe rack is a pretty poor one. I really wish the Imperial set was better suited for upper-50's/new-60. There's some sexyness, in my personal opinion.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YePpuaIi8c4
---
I know right?
---
Ah, if you mean the one in Darkwhisper Gorge on the southern end of the zone, that was the Hyjal one. 
---
I fully agree a streamlined patch release system to keep the waits from one to the next down but still get time to gear and enjoy each part.  A ride I'd do again and again.
---
I'm not saying it's mature of them, but this is the internet.

Everyone gets the saber as Alliance.

It was the last of the best ones. I just dont like the gameplay because of all the lfg/lfr and such. Story/setting/raids were fun. I just didn't like the quality of life improvements. There are some in TBC I didnt like either but it has Kara so Im all for it.
---
Nothing better.
---
This guy knows work-life balance!  Also, I'm sure most of the demographic is in late twenties/early thirties so we are all more grown up and have more responsibilities now.  So taking one day off a week (monday or friday) is the best way to maximize playtime.

Random thing to be curious about, but what's the "12" above the mail indicator on the minimap? Mod that shows the current date?
---
As much as it would be fun to go through BC and Wrath again, I really hope they don't do it just so as to not split the player base. I'm also of the mind that while I love Burning Crusade, and I love Death Knights in Wrath, I wouldn't want to spoil myself on them. I'd much prefer adding onto Classic after Naxx with more 60 content.

My situation is similar I think. I'm trying shaman for classic and saving tauren in case I go druid for horde or alli. I'd prefer to have a different race for all my played heroes. Might go troll or orc shaman but might go troll priest, so by deduction I'll probably do a orc shaman.
---
Except it was done quite widely in Vanilla.
---
its because you used parentheses to form the cleavage instead of a Y... ( . Y . ) See how much better that looks. You deserved the ban.
---
8,500xp is missed without doing it, and done as a group, it's quick and easy.
---
With that said too, don't forget dwarves have track treasure. Personally I hate track swapping. So I will probably go skinning + ench.
---
Believe whatever you want to believe. 
---
Ryan to Acti-Blizzard: Just fuck my shit up

photobucket used to be the shit back in the day.

---
No, it's not quick. If you're ahead you're less likely to have a group of randoms to do the quest with as well. If you'e doing it with friends it'd still be a net loss.
---
It's definitely overkill unless you're doing some kind of competitive speedrunning
---
Aldor vs. Scryer was the main one in Shattrath.
---
The video isn't about leveling a rogue back in Vanilla. Work on your reading comprehension.
---
Ofc Spirit is good and I never said it isn't.
---
Just give us Vanilla with the Wrath talent trees. What could possibly go wrong?
---
The game needs work. And i believe i can make it perfect
---
A lot of people will come to the game in 2020. A lot of those who started in 2019 will roll alts.
---
There will be plenty of people to lvl with and play with. You can join any raiding guild, there will be plenty of MC alts/PUG runs and lots of BWL alt raids.
---
Yes, you will be behind, but that doesn't matter. You will catch up with gear even faster, because you will have a main character among lots of alts.
---
Guilds ALWAYS raid anything, MC for mats / bindings / gearing up alts, BWL for mats / gearing up alts, ZG / AQ 20 for mats /rep / gearing up alts.
---
Yes, you will be raiding, A LOT, even if you start 1 year later.
---
Just an observation from people I have talked too on private servers over the years.
---
If you cleared naxx in vanilla you hated wrath.
---
If you didn't you love it.
---
I'll pass thanks, I stopped as soon as you said you should get tokens based on playtime that you can spend on gear and tier sets.
---
Somehow you managed to make welfare loot even more welfare.
---
I 100% agree with you! Male Tauren on a wolf is the best combo! (Undead on wolf looks pretty cool too!)
---
Belfs and Dreanie and their capitals.
---
This has also been my biggest gripe with the game aswell, makes me sad every time i think about it. but what would the balance implications be if they added it?
---
According to https://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Human_Condition which may or may not be completely accurate, it's roughly 10K not 30K XP per quest.. and the quest was removed in 1.10 which means it wouldn't be in Classic either way (going off available information) 
---
You never asked how many hours it would take to obtain some of these items. Why not reward players who might not be as good as you?
---
I loved Outland zones. But then no one would be in the original zones of Azeroth.
---
Oh wow that's a huge bummer. I just stumbled on this hoping it would be good leveling. NVM I guess
---
Pretty sure Runecloth is the only hand-in that's repeatable. So farming that sub 40 without leveling could be a challenge.
---
I dont know why nerds mock other nerds for nerding out :( 
---
I can see your inclusive arguement. However, i hope the RP realms will be a haven for us. Not a ERP furry giggling point.
---
Retail doesn’t have the scepter bearer grind. This is the worst addition to classic yet.
---
 I might not remember correctly, but it might be "Calendar"(or something similar), and addon used to register to raid group made by the guild's officers
---
Wait... where is the part where you say you are joking?
---
Because then it’s not classic wow 
---
Sooner if they are smart
---
US - Altar of Storms (Horde)
---
Well the quests were probably replaced with something else so it's still some XP but not those numbers I'm pretty sure
---
They don't have to put lfg back in. It was only added midway through the expansion anyway.  Lfr was post WotLK.
---
Go play retail then, that isn't what classic wow is. You're on the wrong subreddit. Literally no one here will want that, you shouldn't be rewarded for literally just logging in no matter how long it takes.
---
It's a bad idea and if you think that will "fix" wow you're ignorant and delusional.
---
Agreed

Going with a healer class to get an easier raid spot? GL with the second kid!
---
I played on a vanilla private server a while back that was 100% "blizz like" in every way except the talent tree was from TBC. It was honestly the greatest game I've ever played. 
---
&gt; Mage
---
&gt;If you are alliance, you won’t have much competition for raids, premades or 5mans
---
&gt;INSANE amount of competition if you roll horde.
---
What why?
---
100% serious.
---
Interesting question and hard to say until we know what the servers look like. I very rarely see guilds raid on weekends, as those are the nights most people go out and do IRL things or spend time with their families. If they ARE raiding those nights.. then it probably IS a hardcore guild which is not what you are looking for according to your post. 
---
Organizing raids in Vanilla is hard because it requires a 40 man presence, and you can never control exactly who shows up day-to-day as people will naturally have things come up.. so you need to schedule for 50+ showing up and expect a few to not make it or the wrong classes to show up etc "cool we have 40 people tonight but no healers we have to wait for at least 2-3 more now" etc
---
Anyhow to answer your question, it depends on what you want to get out of the game. Not sure if you have leveled in vanilla before but if you are only playing 2 days a week it will take you a long time to even ding 60 especially if you take your time and world pvp along the way and have fun with it. If you are into that then you could still have fun even if things end up not working on the raid side.. you could also look to START your own guild with those specific times, if you are into that too.. that might be a good idea. Call it &lt;Late Shift&gt; or something like that might be cool haha -- good luck man :)
---
I do not think it will effect the release. The release will be Q3 anyway
---
Are u a homeless with carpal tunnel that cannot own $10 mouse from amazon?
---
If not ur just lazy dumbass
---
I guess it can two either way. Investors can demand them to cut costs to increase the net revenue, which would hurt the development i suppose. But they can also see it as an additional revenue stream (people resubbing) - to increase the net revenue. Guess we are at the mercy of the big investors :(
---
most places western countries that arent the US give something like 20-30 paid days off per year as standard
---
You're correct, the more you take it 'to extremes' you would simply swap back to a lot of gear with +stam/+agil and lose out on whatever difference there is. 
---
There are plenty of pieces of gear that have either agil/spirit or stam/spirit.  So you can get a bit of 'best of both worlds' by just wearing pieces that benefit you the most.  If you have 2/2 agil/stam boots and all the sudden you get 5/5 stam/spirit boots then obviously go with the stam/spirit.  
---
I feel like rogues probably have a lot of out of combat downtime if you're in stealth, sneaking around trying to get a sap or whatever.  So that whole time you're getting spirit ticks.. not too bad.  
---
I've got a 23 warr right now and spirit tics are VERY helpful and I didn't intend to gear for it, just got a couple random pieces with a chunk of spirit.  Plus if I go to Camp T and get that spirit buff using blood shards (25 spirit for 4 blood shards) I'm getting like 50hp/tick which at level 22 with 800hp is a crazy amount of regen. 
---
:(
---
You see, I've been playing since vanilla and I didn't know about this.
---
Also Terminator 2 is like in my top 3 list of the best action movies of all time, so it makes me even happier.
---
Had an undead horse for my orc rogue. Cheers to everyone who did the grind for rep. 
---
The struggle is real. 10+ years, a wife, steady job and 3 kids later....no lifing classic wow again is such a dream but sadly wont happen. I'll be hitting 60 in months sadly instead of days or weeks.
---
No. Classic's release is already baked into the price and baked into a BNet subscription. 
---
&gt; If you're ahead you're less likely to have a group of randoms to do the quest with as well.
---
If I don't have a group available for this, I'm not doing Stocks either. If I have a group for stocks, I have a group for this.
---
Always start with Unending Breath.
---
This is so that you don’t drown in the sea of tears caused by all the people you kill.
---
what is that even supposed to do?
---
Bannable in classic.
---
I did the same for the Zandalari raptors
---
I played from Vanilla to MoP and I’m going to disagree. When sharding happened, even when DF came there was a drop in realm interaction. It isn’t nostalgia glasses, simply what actually occurred. 
---
Investors only "demand" things in certain circumstances and I don't think ATVI is in such a position, yet. Looks like most of the big players in the industry saw a Q4 slump. ATVI's earnings are next week so we'll see then, I suppose
---
This is the kind of maths/thought I like to see in this sub.
---
Looks like you created a new 2nd post instead of replying to the other post, so whoever you replied to did not see it. If you scroll back and find your original post you want to reply to, there is a small "reply" button on the lower right under his post. That way he will see it and know you are replying to him.
---
Also if I can chime in as a random 3rd party I strongly urge you not to do what you are planning on by going swordsmithing.. you can get better swords from raids or pvp rewards and the people who I knew that went swordsmithing regretted it. If you go axesmith you can at least make money with crafting Nightfall while also making the better weapon in Arcanite Reaper.
---
If youve got your heart set on it though, do your thing and have fun man! Just wanted to give warning because things in vanilla are a bit more... permanent.. than some are used to. It will literally take you months and months to do this even if you "no-life" it. If you play casually it may take you 6 months-1year to get where you want to be and then realize.. oh, thats not what i thought it was.
---
i played wotlk the entire expansion and then 1 month into cata and never had it happen to me. i didnt even know it was a thing until this subreddit.
---
Not really, no. I wish I could share your enthusiasm but everyone I know treats ActiBlizz like the plague. They want to play on Classic servers, but they don't want sharding, CRZ, loot trading and right click report. It's much easier for them not to invest time in to a project when ultimately they feel they can not trust Activision or Blizzard to stick to their word. They're particularly concerned it's just a playground for bored retail players that will quickly be bastardized with changes to appease them.
---
Other posts complain that there's no news so the sky is falling. No news means I get more time for uncorroborated math.
---
This x10000000. I was thinking of the possibilities that blizzard could explore by maintaining level 60 content and expanding it.
---
But each time I did that my thought process ended up making BFA again and I can't 
---
&gt; If you cleared naxx in vanilla you hated wrath.
---
All .001% of players, then.
---
It looks like the 'big' investors hold a share  45.31% share in the company (if Yahoo is correct), so that yeah, activision probably still has the last say. But at some point they have to change course if the price keeps tanking ;)
---
Thank you for your reply. Good point about those weekend guilds more likely being hardcore and yeah organizing a reliable raid on weekends will be even more difficult than on working days.
---
I ll play quite a lot during the week, but would only be able to attend raids every second week and I don't think that would go well with most guilds.
---
Guess I will just have to hope for the best. Certainly will enjoy the game no matter what :) 
---
What's with all of this "healing slave" "forced to heal" bias? It's not like rogues aren't forced to DPS. It's okay to note that a shaman will be healing in raids, but that's not a con lol. Healing is fun
---
It doesn't matter though. It's not fast.
---
Not every guild requires you to bring every consumable in the game.
---
Not to mention investors don't control day to day operations, that's the CEO. Investors/the board can vote to replace the CEO, or encourage the company to make certain decisions, but they sure as fuck don't run the company.
---
So how about people that pay for your "premium subscription" with multiple accounts? You want pay to win to be the model of Classic?
---
Not *harder*, but it took a lot more time. It was very uncommon to have Exalted reputation with a reputation beyond your starting reputation.
---
I never said they run the company - i said they can demand stuff. Also didn't say Activision would act on the demands ;) It's all speculation
---
5 players killing 30 mobs isn't fast?
---
Wotlk DansGame
---
Never had it happen to me In WOTLK. 
---
You can only spend the tokens on the account you accumulate them on. Also you can send friends or alts the items you buy
---
8500 xp, that requires you to run on foot all the way to the north end of the wetlands to get, and it requires you to do a level 29+ elite quest before you can even do it, which at level 25 will take you quite a long time.

You don’t need prep to kill a mage.
---
Nah, not totally wrong. The idea is there, it's just that in order to start making demands, investors need to hold a certain % of the company
---
You can’t even refer to it as classic in your video with all the stupid shit you just said. 
---
you can get 50 fishing in like 10 mins lol

They can demand returns on their investments at the cost of quality of the companies product. Investors are the only thing companies care about catering to.

Would be easier to pick one.  Druid is a healer in progress and lock is dps, pretty easy to differentiate them.
---
Eh.. tbc marked the beginning of the end, wotlk dug the grave (and cata put the final nail the coffin)
---
When Classic first got announced I wanted to go back and play a Hunter just like I did in retail Vanilla through WotLK. But I had that itch I needed to scratch via private server so I tried that and realized that I also really liked healing and playing a priest. I decided to do priest in Classic but had since waffled back to Hunter for Nostalgia purposes. Given my change in circumstances I think a priest is my best bet for getting a raid spot. And thanks! I'm pretty excited!
---
I'm fairly sure they would have. 
---
Source? 
---
Don't know if you more about this; but Yahoo states that 93.19% of the outstanding shares are held by institutional investors. I recall reading somewhere that a 50+% ownership of the outstanding shares constitutes a controlling interest. Doesn't this mean that if more than x of the institional investors decide todo something, the company is sort of forced to do it? Or am i missing something?
---
It's actually all very transparent considering they are a public company, also your reference to net revenue made it seem like you didn't know your jargon hence my further explanation. Net Revenue is net profit minus discounts and returns, meaning it is unaffected by "cost cutting". Net Income/Net Profit minuses costs. Yes, it's pedantic but they are very different.

He'll have a 2nd kid soon. It's not like he's going to be sleeping, so may as well grind in between cleaning the piss and shit stains from the wall and feeding the damn thing.
---
Curse of exhaustion plus escape artist to beat the melee classes early.  
---
That sucks, we had 3 TF on nost but we were running double mc for like 6 months.
---
My thought as well. It's not worth the bag space. 
---
And for a non-mana class spirit is a waste of time when you can use first aid.
---
I don’t know a single rogue player who would swap to spirit gear while farming. Sure some would swap to int gear while leveling a weapon skill but it wasn’t that prevalent.
---
I understand, i'm by no means an expert (as you can see :) ) in this. And i probably also wrongly translated my intentions. What i wanted to express is if they can't increasing the amount of money coming in (subs, etc) then just decrease the amount of money going out (salaris, etc) :)
---
Thanks for the explanation tho - you never stop learning! :)
---
As far as I remember warlock dots couldn't crit in vanilla nor in tbc?
---
So the 2.0 prepatch?
---
With the gear that will be available shaman and priests will be great for damage and healing
---
Yes, you're right, but institutional investors don't agitate for change. That's just not their style. If they see an underperforming company they'll just slowly dump their holdings rather than try to right the ship.
---
Investors who do try to get involved are called "activist investors". They'll buy a certain portion of a company's stock (usually 7-10%) and start to agitate for a board seat or something. Sometimes they'll launch a campaign with the goal of getting seats on the board (so they can control direction, replace the CEO, etc.) If they can get 50% of shareholders on their side in a vote, they'll win. 
---
So as you said 50+% is the threshold. Zuckerberg has like 53% voting rights in Facebook, so he can basically tell any dissidents to get fucked. 
---
Orc rogue if gear is progressive otherwise orc lock.
---
There will be alot of overlap in consumables, and you can just have herb on one of them, and have extra professions for gold making having a second character. Main thing will be finding two guilds where the scheduling lets you raid with both, or a guild that will be doing two runs a week.
---
I don't really remember that specific quest but I recall doing at least a few others that were worth a lot of XP and some loot. AV was always my go to after hitting 51.
---
I prefer my undead mage on the wolf.
---
Right, so you have multiple accounts, and you just run them AFK in cities. How is this fun for anyone?
---
It's annoying to try and win that battleground with a bunch of pre-60s in the raid who are there not to PVP but as some kind of leveling hack. I hope for a tier restricted to level 60s only.
---
I was the first Troll on my (retail Vanilla) server to have an interracial mount. It was a kodo.
---
I was a real noob back then. I spent 95% of my time farming gold and runecloth and nothing else.
---
I was devastated when the Kodo was a mini kodo ;_;  I expected to be on a large mount just like the Tauren.
---
It really crushed my spirit tbh. Thank goodness we have this dressing room now

Nope
---
Fear healer dot the rest nuke the lowest Profit 
---
Highly considering going resto shaman from the beginning...
---
Why are people so adamant about flying mount etc TBC and WotLK? Sure, content is nice, but TBC invalidates virtually the entirety of Vanilla content, while Naxx doesn't invalidate any Vanilla content (tier 1 raids and even dungeons are always worth running).
---
TBC and WotLK will fracture the playerbase, and are they really worth it in the first place?
---
Why stop at WotLK anyway? Many people including myself enjoyed Cata. Why not Cata too? Or every expansion? What about people who love Pandarens as their main race?
---
The community ruined Vanilla WoW once. I hope the community doesn't ruin Vanilla WoW again.
---
Keep Classic classic.
---
I'm just saying there's no definitive proof he used private servers so he shouldn't have been banned for that.
---
Yea. What was it... 1.13 in 2006? 
---
If you’re a weapon chaser 2-H windfury is your best friend 
---
It was 2.0
---
There were less ways to do it. 
---
The best way would be to intentionally go over to the other place's starting area before the quests go grey and do a buttload to get that head start.  But you're still looking at a loooot of cloth turnin either way most likely. 
---
Even if individual investors dont have control to make specific demands, the goal of the company is to look as good as possible to current and future investors. This influences the companys decisions like releasing a game early to boost a quarter or promise certain profits and 
---
I live in the US and my company gives me 18 PTO days (about 3 and a half weeks) yearly and 11 paid \*scheduled\*  holidays. Sounds like you have it made friend!
---
Not to be snarky but there are numerous warlock vanilla PVP guides out there you will get much better information there than by hoping someone types up a similar thing here. 
---
To combat that we'd have to have afk timers and auto log people. I did not think about people doing that thank you!
---
This is why you shouldn't do drugs, kids. 
---
Hardcore players would have a blast theory crafting new BiS and shit, and casual players would enjoy more class options.
---
What a shit encounter that was.
---
Same, and likely rarely if ever getting into raids.
---
Rofl snarkiest comment of the day :)
---
I am planning on being an undead rogue.
---
Wrath was my down turn for WoW and that is when I kinda stopped enjoying it because they started to push the whole cross realm dungeon finder and felt that is what killed communities in MMOs. 
---
classic and tbc is what I will stick with.
---
but level 17 and 34s need mounts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and Night elves should start in troll zones for reasons!
---
I skipped ahead twice and that's what I heard.
---
What the actual fuck?
---
Nah.
---
It really did feel like a mini-raid. Most memorable by far 
---
I some how made it through the entire video...it kept getting worse and worse lol. 
---
I'm now reminded of the pre-patch days for BC, at the end of Vanilla. It might have been the most fun part of WoW for me. Nobody gave a fuck, all raiding stopped, and we just ran around killing each other for a week or two. Good times.
---
I appreciate everyones comments and it seems like it's between Warrior/Shaman/Hunter. I'll watch some videos and so some more researched and go from there.
---
&gt; Me now: "how the fuck is he not getting fired?"
---
It's like you forgot the whole plot of the movie...
---
Han shot first!
---
Yea but I’m sure there expecting a pretty large increase in subs.  I for one haven’t subbed in 6+ years and will be again for classic.
---
I mean, I've heard arrogant bullshit on the internet before, but this one is pretty high up there.
---
Charge in, whirlwind, Stance Dance to Prot, Demo Shout, Battle Shout, spread Sunders
---
The drop in realm interactions was for casual events like dungeon grinds, weekly valor caps, etc. Your primary contact, being guild etc, stays the same.
---
This, wotlk was playable, but isnt even in 5he same league as BC and vanilla.
---
&gt; there expecting a pretty large increase in subs. 
---
That's what baked in means. The market is expecting an increase in subs. If the actual numbers exceed estimates, the stock will probably go up. 
---
I would ONLY be fine with that IF tbc dealt with the legion properly. Have the Kil'Jaeden fight be for real, then a Tomb of Sargeras raid after that (seriously, broken isles didn't need a whole expansion).
---
The warcraft reforged team said they looked to the Mists of Pandaria cinematic as a base for what orcs and humans should look like in Warcraft III: Reforged.
---
Vurtne popularised it back in the days
---
Jeeze this is really awful
---
I mean, yeah, I agree with you, but this topic isn't about war mode or pvp. It's about the ineffectiveness of the ignore function if someone is determined enough.
---
Did you actually read the post? Here is the blue response(from the bottom of OP):
---
&gt;Hey Morajin,
---
&gt;First, let me assure you that this action was not taken due to any participation in world PVP. I can understand how the timing of the action could have led you to that conclusion so I want to make sure we’re clear that it was not related. We would not find actions, such as taking over a flight point or quest hub, to be actionable offenses. Players have the option of disabling War Mode or organizing a counter attack with their own faction to retake the area.
---
&gt;What you were suspended for was ongoing targeted harassment of others. We investigated a report we received and were able to verify that, after being placed on ignore, you continued to harass another player through in-game mail using multiple characters on your account. Your messages were not limited to a single person; you harassed other associates of this player with unsolicited mail. We provide a number of tools to allow players to moderate their own social experiences in-game. Bypassing this feature to continue unwanted interactions constitutes disruptive gameplay and will result in account action, including silencing or suspension from the game.
---
&gt;I hope this helps to clarify the reason for this penalty. I suggest that in the future if someone places you on ignore that you do not try to contact them either directly or through their associates.
---
Im betting it will help it. Bought some this week :) 
---
r/WarcraftLore has a good resource for this in the Community Info page
---
Low level dungeons were the most fun to me, classes are still getting their abilities and so any CC feels incredibly useful. People are incredibly vulnerable, and bosses are actually pretty challenging for groups that aren't max level for the dungeon's range. Deadmines is infamous, such a great dungeon. I liked BFD as well, and both Krauls. I'll have to see if I can get a solid group of 5 players during launch week- I plan to nolife plevel it, but if I can get 4 people to breeze through some dungeons at the highest level for the dungeon, may be worth it just in terms of keeping sane during that grind.
---
Kind of but with a giant asterisk.
---
DM was a dungeon released later after MC/Ony had been on farm for a while, and offered gear that was often better than many of the other level 60 dungeons. 
---
ZG and AQ20 werent 40 man raids and offered items that were in between MC/BWL and BWL/AQ40 content, while the raids themselves were not as difficult as MC or BWL.
---
That being said, the items were not so much better as to completely take MC or BWL off the table, more of a helping you along.
---
mop and wod was slowly rotting in the grave

The goal of the company is to make a profit. Operations are not, generally speaking, influenced by a company's share price. Obviously people with an equity stake have incentives to make the company's shares more valuable, but that value is largely tied to the expected future performance. 
---
Pushing out Classic WoW sooner wouldn't really have a noticeable long-term impact on the price. Actually, the market would probably look at that release and raise a questioning eyebrow. 
---
I'm disappointed no one has mocked me for referring to "exalted" reputation as "epic" in the post title. Where's my "mods don't know anything about Classic/Vanilla" squad!?
---
'xD' is the same era as photobucket - time to move on. 
---
I have bad news for you.  The community will fracture regardless.  I like vanilla.  Vanilla is cool.  I am willing to play it for two years.  After that I need Burning Crusade.  I don't want horizontal progression and I don't want to play Vanilla on an endless loop.  After Naxx I will be leaving vanilla because I will have had my fill.  Even if Burning Crusade never happens, you will never keep those people "against their will" in vanilla anyway.  They will lose interest like I will.  I know people who love vanilla don't want to see people leave it again, but it IS going to happen, whether we get more expansions or not.
---
Only problem with kodos is in vanilla the doorways were not big enough. 
---
I recall from somewhere on this sub that the rep rewards are off on classicdb versus what we will actually get. At least for the city reps, so it is possible BG rep rewards are also off. You should cross check with classic.wowhead.com, the values for wins and the quests might be different there.
---
Probably best to choose one main, than take your alternate to content that’s on farm. You’ll gear up the second much faster. 
---
Im one of the naxx clearers and I see wrath as the beginning of the end.  They started making everything easier and homogenizing classes.  Putting in the work to get top end gear was less of an acheivement because they kept nerfing things till everyone could do it.  They also started giving out tier sets for tokens.  Bummed me out.
---
Ok so expand ignore to mail messages.
---
Oven baked chicken - salt + pepper is all I use. 400 F for just under 20 mins (I use tenderloins).
---
I make a few pounds each time then put it over salad cold, easy and healthy. 
---
Greek Yogurt + fruit (banana, apple, berries, etc) is also very easy and healthy.
---
Cold brew coffee - soak your grinds for 24 hr then strain, super potent and delicious.
---
That's gunna be my mealplan, adding in some chips + salsa, or also making some Nachos Supreme via microwave + cheese + beef / chicken.
---
I hit revered with AB in Vanilla and only achieved rank 10. I sure as hell did not play 400+ games, though I did spend a lot of time there
---
Damn I actually never thought about the first one. I’m gonna try exactly this the day classic gets released! 
---
Many guilds host alt-runs for the lower tier raids, so it can be quite feasible that way.
---
Ahh gotcha I misread what you said.
---
And stuff like home computers are a couple decades old. Time to move on?  
---
No. Some stuff is timeless, like ECKS DEE. Photobucket is an old, outdated and inferior product, like trying to use a 133 mhz computer for anything other than starcraft 1 and diablo 1 lol.  
---
Imgur is the sleek modern gaming computer.
---
I have a feeling the numbers are off as well. I'll check a few more sites. 
---
I covered 24 June - 29July, so yeah:)
---
Not taken as snarky, I am going to look in to it when I can. For now was just hoping to get answers based on my specific questions that maybe a video or guide would gloss over.
---
Switch R to auto run and make reply shift+r.
---
Also get a gaming keyboard and mouse for the extra buttons.
---
Dark Iron War has no prerequisites that I'm aware of, just requires level 25. And it won't take that long to complete with 4 other level 25s in the group.
---
And the plan if I'm considering running Stocks is to be in Wetlands at level 24-25, so it's not that far of a trek.
---
I had a black war kodo on my orc after they changed the PvP system. 
---
Get the Despecialised.....can confirm they're worth the effort
---
You can also turn 3 marks of each BG for extra rep
---
Honestly if they added various realms which include TBC and Wrath AND Classic? That would be ideal. You could choose which expac you want to play at any given time. 
---
Let me backpedal a bit. Play whatever you like to play, however some classes will allow you to jump into progression faster. Warlocks are definitely up there in terms of demand. Youll definitely have much higher chances of finding a raid spot in a good guild as a warlock, as opposed to a rogue or mage.
---
I sit on the floor with a cushion called a zaffu. Monitor on the floor too obviously. I also cut a few inches off the legs of a coffee table to make it the right height for my hands.
---
I did the same as an Undead for Orgrimmar.  Finished during AQ event after becoming an AH tycoon.
---
The highest level on my account was a 28 warlock.  I was so proud.
---
True. But in terms of a pure time to exalted standpoint waiting for 3 tokens for all 3 BGs isn't worth the extra 50 rep imo. 
---
This is good content actually.  Blizzard always made a point to care for the health of their players back in the day e.g. flight paths, loading screen tips etc.
---
There is a WoW cookbook I think exists.  You should seriously look into that if cooking is your jam.
---
/r/slowcooking and /r/MealPrepSunday
---
I'll likely do a prep of breakfast burritos like I normally do
---
and then do a chuck roast with stew veggies in one crock pot for something filling and heavy
---
and dijon chicken and broccoli in another crock pot for something lighter.
---
toss both into a dozen tupperware containers.
---
That'll last me the week of power leveling.
---
I set auto run to middle mouse personally. I'm using my mouse to move/steer most of the time out of combat anyway, so it just makes sense to me. Reply seems like something you could do without even binding IMO, since you can just type /r. 
---
&gt;toss both into a dozen tupperware containers.

Smite's Hammer is a great 2h weapon for warriors and will last a long time. I probably milked it, but I didnt replace that lvl 19 hammer until I finished my ww axe quest at lvl 31. There were some vendor 2h weapons I could have replaced it with, but I didnt want to spend the ~4g.
---
in Wpvp you play as a control-caster. You will almost always open up with curse of Agony + fear, or if you have succubus, Seduce. Soul Link dominates in Wpvp, whereas destro/ruin is preferred in BGs. 
---
Either way, your main goal is to keep your pressure up while mitigating as much as possible. Some classes mitigate taking damage by dealing their own, applying pressure, Warlocks mitigate via Fear / Death Coil + Kiting, and they have pretty good sustain whether it's through VoidW sac, siphon life, drain life, or health stones. Always keep a healthstone in your inventory in the open world. 
---
You want to LoS casters, and Fear + reapply DoTs vs pretty much every class. Wanding can even be worth it to conserve mana if you're vs some sustain class.
---
Yea thats the biggest issue. While I can understand some people want to ERP for some sort of gratification, I hope Blizzard put a stop to it happening in the starter area's I believe Goldshire is a bad impression to new players for example.
---
Ah, good point about /r, I forgot that. I used middle mouse for attacks myself, (generally cooldown ones because it's hard to miss-click) but your logic checks out.
---
I’ll take all of it *and nothing more* 
---
I'm a big fan of tuna salad. If you make it yourself go heavy on the mustard (0 calories) and light on the mayo (a ton of calories). Dress it up with celery, carrots, walnuts, almonds, raisin, cranberries, or whatever youd like. Make a bunch ahead of time for easy sandwiches/wraps, or just eat it with a spoon.
---
If you dont like tuna then try canned chicken breast, although it's a little expensive IMO. To save money you can cook your own chicken and shred it, or buy a pre-roasted chicken.
---
I mean the class might be called shaman but it's a mixture between shamans, witch doctors, far seer, shadow hunter and even spirit walkers
---
With that in mind I think they did fine but TBC probably fleshed it out more with blood lust and spirit wolves
---
O man brings back memories for sure

Cross realm dungeons were literally the cross realm bgs of Wotlk; they came in right at the very end, with ICC.
---
Although I agree with you on the welfare epics. I was just talking with someone a few days ago about how if they made a wrath server they’d have to either get rid of or change the gear from the TOC and ICC 5 mans. Force people to go the original Heroics-&gt;Naxx-&gt;Ulduar-&gt;TOC-&gt;ICC progression rather than the ICC/TOC 5 mans-&gt;TOC-&gt;ICC that existed at the end of the expansion. 
---
This is suggested for warriors as well but IMO it's not worth the bag space. Plus, idk where they think all this spirit gear is coming from. I guess if it were an alt and I were rich then I wouldn't care about bag space and I could buy spirit gear off the AH every 5 or 10 levels. 
---
When I lived in Germany in college, I would pick up this vacuum-packed cheese tortellini and pan fry it with onions. Cheap and easy. I was a poor college student. Today I would add a bit more. Likely use scallions instead of yellow onions, toss it with some pesto or pre-make a bunch of Alfredo or red sauce and use a bit of that. 
---
Grilled cheese is a tasty option. Google grown up grilled cheese. Lots of things to put between two slices of bread and pan toasted.
---
Buy some white fish. Roll it in a beaten egg. Sprinkle some seasoning on it like Old Bay or whatever is popular there. Roll it in bread crumbs. Bake until it flakes easily (425 degrees F for 25min in states) and enjoy. 
---
Not sure about Germany these days, but here in the states there’s these frozen meals for two which can be decent for being frozen foods. 
---
There’s plenty more, depending on one’s tastes, how complex they want to be (but still quick), etc.
---
Home-made fried rice is pretty good for you and is super easy to make, BwB made a video on how to make it recently too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk0axPbD2pc

It's possible that ninja looting was against the [ToS](https://i.imgur.com/Le5nhH2.png) just have a look at #9. I've never heard of it being banned until WotLK where "loot rules" was introduced but it's certainly possible that those rules would/could apply to ninja looting.
---
Oh yeh also a Dire Maul fan! Forgot all about that place for a moment..!
---
Makes the choice easier for them I suppose, Druid it is! 
---
I know a lot of people will hang me for this since I’m a modern WoW player but I feel like every other expansion is shit.
---
Vanilla: Good.
---
TBC: I fucking hated what they did to Illidan, Vasj and Kael. Made me a sour puss for a lot of the expansion.
---
Wrath: I’ve been an Arthas fanboy since WC3 so obviously amazing. 
---
Cata: Unsubbed.
---
MoP: Came back, loved Chen from WC3. Loved the class mechanics especially warlock.
---
WoD: the great pruning. Worst subs at the time. Unsubbed again.
---
Legion: what I wanted from TBC story wise. Loved going to Argus.
---
BFA: *Screams in apathy*
---
Unless you want it for all 3 factions.
---
Can't wait to play a Blood Elf!
---
LFG wasn’t added until 3.3 IIRC and I think LFR was added in Cataclysm or the very end of Wrath. Wrath is one of my favorites, but I could definitely do without LFG (or at least limit LFG to people on the same server). 
---
Not completely sure, but I think aspect of the pact might speed things up as well as feign death (don't have to fight through as many mobs towards to end). But I'm not completely sure about this. 
---
#HOTPOCKETS
---
which insta 60 server do you recommend? And will it have training dummies to test rotations?
---
Also true. If you're going for all. It's worth it
---
Might take a day or two to get ahead of the leveling crowd. If I do decide to use vacation time it will be for PvP ranking 2 days a week for as long as I can.
---
So interesting, because I've always felt Kodo was the ugliest mount of either faction. It's all  a matter of taste, but it's always wild to hear stuff like this. 
---
Player base would be divided into three groups. Big risk. 
---
Whoever told you that only Hunters do it[?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cRjgVz4uGw) Most classes can do it. Don't count on it being very effective in Classic though as there shouldn't be any Blizzlike methods of resetting the instance from inside and getting teleported to the entrance. 
---
What playstyle/gameplay is more fun? 
---
Enhancement Shaman or Arms/Fury Warrior?
---
What I predict will happen is that there will always be dedicated servers for each expansion, but when they add new expansions you could probably just copy your character to a TBC or WOTLK realm. This way people who want nothing but vanilla can have it, or people that want to play TBC or whatever can have their own servers. 
---
Still, what I'd really like to see is some new content for vanilla. Maybe add hard modes for raids and dungeons, or perhaps a new tier after Naxx is cleared. Sort of like a reimagining where TBC didn't exist. 
---
What would be neat is if they had TBC or WOTLK servers that only allowed flying in certain areas.
---
Wish I could play my space goat :/

---
Poor wolfie.
---
In WotLK, one of the dumbest things they did was allow you to level through PvP.  Not only did this turn me off from low-level PvP, which I used for...
---
* Gearing up a character at 19, 29, and 39 to have better gear at 20, 30, or 40 (especially to get mail or plate at 40 on a class that upgraded)
---
* Taking an overgeared character to be dominant at 19, 29, or 39
---
* Using as a  way to spend my time on a character I'm leveling with a friend without overleveling him when he's offline
---
So those all went out the window with WotLK because you out-level the gear you get, you don't stay long enough for the 500g in gear to matter, and I can't hold myself back from outleveling my friend.  But it came with another problem as well:
---
* Alterac Valley AFK Grinding
---
I leveled my druid from 70-80 using this method.  It was ridiculously easy.  I could just sit under the base and it looks like I'm defending, and with 40 people nobody's keeping track anyway to report you for AFK.  All you do is jump every minute or so and you're good!  In every run I did, there were at least half a dozen players in the cave with me.  (I don't remember what faction I was, but the other faction couldn't do this).
---
This ended up being faster than if I quested through Northrend, and it was extremely easy.  Easier than leveling a Paladin or Hunter.  I had two accounts and would dual-box this and power-level two toons at once.
---
The only problem was I got no gold while I was leveling, and I was still in ilvl 128 gear (Tier 5) moving into Tier 8.  But a couple weeks of being carried and I was G2G.
---
You do however ban people who didn't do anything wrong from your Discord server 
---
I agree, it's a super, super fast run. Yeah, the boss drops are kinda mediocre, so you only have so much to hope for, but it's better than grinding mobs in the world, and it's possible to chain run it extremely rapidly. Running it at least once is a gimmie, but honestly I tend to chain run it while in the appropriate level if I can cobble together a decent group for it. 
---
It's also extremely accessible, which is nice. Travel time to/from dungeons matters a fair bit. BFD or SFK, for instance, is kinda out there. Unless you've got a support team willing to summon/portal you everywhere, which seems unlikely for server firsts, or most people in general, travel time is extremely relevant for efficiency, and stockades is unusually convenient. 
---
Stratholme UD side. I really like fighting through the streets full of undead. Chance at an epic mount as well, very cool.
---
Least looking forward to Scholomance. My memories of that place are not fond ones.
---
I got a gaming chair from staples for 100$ I was like you as well thinking that gaming chairs were just bullshit but my back was hurting me on my old chair so I needed to make a change. I’m now loving this chair and can game for hours no problem.
---
It's amazing to me how many people in this sub don't realize this. Endless Vanilla will not last past 2-3 years and Blizzard will not dedicate resources to creating new, unique content for classic/vanilla (I wish/hope I'm wrong on that last part).
---
A progression through expansions every 2 years is the only way to keep people playing.
---
Damn I want fish now lol

Not true. My staples chair was called “gaming chair” and it’s been the most comfortable chair that has helped my back so much.
---
Nah nah nah, you're doing it all wrong. Get alchemy, only kill stuff 2-3 levels lower than you and use cleave the whole time, you typically only need bandages and you can kill many mobs between heals, especially if you keep good spirit. (If you're on a PvP server you're gonna wanna be overleveled for the area you're killing mobs in anyways, otherwise you'll just die at the whim of other players, and that's no fun.) If you're too low on health for two mobs just grab one and white hit it to death for the rage. I have by far the most fun leveling as a warrior, the only thing that slows you down is dying, so I find riding the knife edge between speed and staying alive constantly entertaining.
---
PS: Warriors are weapon dependent, not gear dependent. According to my calculations stats do approximately fuck all.
---
Meatloaf.  Cheap and easy to make.  Always have leftovers.

You can as moonkin as well, just not as good.

I had a saber cat for my gnome.  They jumped so majestically!
---
Same here! I was specifically a Gnome Mage too, so much for being snowflakes :(
---
Shit, I'm just glad to see another post that isn't fighting about sharding
---
Yeah sure. EVERYONE. 
---
The achievement didn’t require having both at the same time but only that you obtained them at some point, among other reps required too.
---
But yeah the DM quest turn in is the only way iirc to keep bloodsail rep and gain rep with steamwheedle cartel.
---
I heard of that back then! I totally forgot that. Thanks for reminding me.

---
The cataclysm book was so good. It really made me enjoy that expansion. Perhaps I will read some of the earlier ones, thanks for the inspiration!
---
Not much choice since Tauren couldn’t ride the Skeletal Horses or the Raptors lol......unless they were special versions like the black war mounts or dungeon drops. That was the one change I loved about BC as a Tauren Druid. 
---
You know you are weird when you are playing an armored cowman riding an armored wolf in a videogame. On the other hand, it is the good kind of weird. The fun kind of weird. Hehe. Take my updoot.
---
The classic method that I remember is drowning yourself in the water below (optionally while fighting the giant croc - can't remember it's name). Dying to environment doesn't damage your equipment. Then you run back to purple entrance, respawn, leave, run back to the sceptre location, reset and enter again.
---
Probably not as effective as some farming options, but it will probably be a thing regardless.
---
I made it to field marshal in vanilla on a warlock. At the end of the day it’s all situational based. Knowing your abilities and role within your group is important. 
---
Having a good group is 99.99% of the issue. On my vanilla server there was a wait list to join the group that could get you into the upper ranks. It’s actually quite silly how they did it, but essentially everyone is on a curve, and only strict amounts of players are allowed to hold the top spots, if you can’t get in that group, it’s a never ending grind.

Next expac gon be lit.

This thread is very likely off-topic but I'll approve it because healthy eating is key to a sharp mind. Don't forget to hydrate!

I think it has to be or WoW is done :(
---
A favourite of mine, pasta alla carbonara.
---
It's easy, boil the pasta, then dry it when you think the pasta is good. In the frying pan, fry the bacon, add cream and mushrooms, some yolks if you like... And then mix the dried pasta to the sauce (in the frying pan), let it soak most of the cream... and ¡pronto!

We got ourselves an easy but tasty meal. Trust me, I'm a student...

Was the Stormwind one turning in library books? Seems like that would take unbelievably long.
---
Do you use buttons on the mouse? I mount with mouse 5. And jump with mouse 3. Auto walk/move mouse 4.
---
I wonder if you can shift bind these. OMg
---
I've got one of the Herman miller Aeron chairs at work, they are fantastic. Wish I could justify dropping that much cash on one for home. 
---
Something other than just PvP.  I played a warrior in vanilla and ranked him to 10 and I found out after the TBC pre-patch that I was honestly much better at ranged and Warrior wasn't really a very fun class for my play style. For those of you who played vanilla...you know the pain I mean because leveling a warrior, much less leveling to 60, is a pain. Ranking to 10 was kind of a pain too.
---
So...I'm either going to level a hunter and do that epic quest for the MC bow and clear at least T1 and hopefully T2 content and do some PvP this time as I didn't raid in vanilla at all.  Hopefully a guild will take me because I hear hunters did shit DPS, but I will work my ass off to gear up, learn my rotation, and come prepared with consumables, etc. ready to rock and be a team player. Hopefully that will be enough.
---
Otherwise, maybe a druid casually...they look pretty fun and I definitely know how to tank.
---
Not sure if joking, bulk meal prep saves money.
---
A little older than both of you...my wife and I have already said our goodbyes.
---
Shaman.  Lol
---
Smite's has a ~20% drop rate tho - I know a lot of warriors go for the quest reward [Staff of Westfall](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=7230) if it doesn't drop. 
---
Having enough gold to actually craft it usually puts the dot in the argument of who is going to get it, not the DKP.
---
And oh boy, it could be a lot, like 10-15k gold or even more. 
---
I stacked spirit when possible on my rogue in vanilla. Worked even better because I was a troll.
---
I wonder if that dude above is aware of Serenty Now's funeral raid.
---
Huh interesting I always thought that trinket specifically had some potential for swap abuse. I'll have to try it out thanks.
---
Unbind keys that are close to WASD and used for non-combat keybinds (C, V, R). Change strafe left/right to A/D so Q and E are now free to use.   
---
I use Q E R C F Z X V, mouse button 4 / 5, and then Shift for these for bottom left bar and ctrl for bottom right. 
---
Bankrolling a guild?
---
I was able to create a monopoly on a certain shard with a  hunter/enchanting during vanilla.
---
Is it feasible to support a casual raiding guild on a herb/alch mage?
---
Filthy casual no wonder you had to wash your hands lol.
---
What's all this about farming rep for mounts? *summons felsteed and rides away*
---
Sounds like garbage.
---
I'm here to heal. I love paladins cause they're amazing tank healers. Agreed.

[Reddit: "Who should get priority for Hand of Ragnaros?"](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ak9b9f/who_should_get_priority_on_hand_of_ragnaros_in/)

[WoW forums: "Who should get priority for Hand of Ragnaros"](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/who-should-get-priority-on-hand-of-ragnaros-in-your-opinion/85442)  
---
So here are two posts made to gather people's opinions about who should get Hand of Ragnaros.  
---
Based on the information in each, here is what I would do to try to get the weapon:  
---
* Be a Shaman or Human Paladin any spec  
---
* Roll Blacksmithing to 300 ASAP  
---
* Be a master at farming gold  
---
* Buy 1 [Sulfuron Ingot](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17203) to receive the [Sulfuron Hammer recipe](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18592) from [Lokhtos Darkbargainer](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=12944) in BRD
---
* Show up to every raid  
---
* PVP a lot to paint yourself as a serious PVP'r  
---
* Generally just be very skilled at both PVE and PVP  
---
* Help guildmates out with pre-raid BiS and other activities  
---
* Basically slave myself as a member of the guild  
---
* Save as much DKP as possible (if applicable) through all available methods  
---
* Make it known ahead of time that Hand of Ragnaros is a key goal but don't act entitled  
---
* Continue farming gold until you reach the amount of gold that would be necessary to buy the materials  
---
* It's a high risk if you buy Sulfuron Ingots and craft the base hammer before you get the Eye, and I wouldn't suggest it, but it's an option  
---
I believe these are all necessary actions to take towards your goal of getting Hand of Ragnaros. You can get it on a warrior but it will be slightly less likely on a warrior than a shaman or paladin. In fact I would say the order of most likely class is: Shaman &gt; Paladin &gt; Warrior  
---
It's all pretty obvious. One little tip for keybinding multiple classes is keep things similar between characters. I have q as my counterspell/silence/kick/pummel, E as my main offsenive cooldown, R as main defensive cooldown, T is always health potion etc. Keeping them consistent across characters helps a lot switching between them.
---
We have WoW Classic simply becsuse they figured out a way to make money from it. Don’t ever think for a second in the 21st century that corporations value anything above profit
---
"More dots"
---
Oo hadn't seen them - look very interesting indeed - thanks for the tip! :)
---
&gt; save DKP
---
"No one" is using DKP... Just look guilds recruiting and you will see that not a single guild is using DKP.
---
&gt;original world of warcraft is the most successful video game in history  
---
Lol imagine the delusion to believe this.  
---
TBC and WotLK were more successful. Next to that there were more games that were more successful. For example GTAV
---
Retail wow has already fractured the player base more than any other expansion. There are millions of players not playing, more who've quit since vanilla til now than who are currently playing. If they can recapture those players interest there will be plenty of people to go around.
---
I found what also helped with keybinding was the type of mouse I used. Doesn't have to be the latest and greatest RGB gamer mouse it could be a simple Logitech mouse you buy at a Walmart or Target. If it has 2 thumb buttons then you can use those in conjunction with shift and ctrl for 6 additional keybinds. 
---
I generally like to use those 6 binds for a few things. For Feign Death and Trap macro for my Hunter, for stance dancing as a warrior. To alternate bear or cat form on my druid and also for for blink and counterspell on my mage. As for my Paladin I used to bind those buttons for HoJ and Hammer of Wrath.
---
Thanks. Might I ask if this method is doable by warriors as well? Or if there is any better method of farming gold for warriors?
---
World of Warcraft Chronicles 1, 2 and 3. Then you can go and look for the other books for a more in depth story.
---
I'm almost certain most servers have ironfoe proc wrong.
---
&gt;What is the rotation or style of play for Warlocks in PvP?
---
You had two fun specs to play back then, either Siphon Life or Soul Link. Both were very viable and played similarly, dot and try to stay alive through kiting/hiding behind your team/fears.
---
&gt;What is the role of a warlock in BGs? And what is the dominant spec?
---
Your hole in organized group pvp was mostly putting out the numbers and spamming tongues on healers and being generally disruptive. There arent many classes that could sustain higher dps than warlocks back then.
---
You could also play ruin and try to 1 shot people for fun clips/montages. But this wasn't nearly as reliable or good.
---
&gt;How do they fare without BiS gear?
---
Not great, but passable.
---
&gt;Do they get destroyed if melee get on them?
---
At equal gear and skill level? Yes.
---
It's even worse if both sides have healers.
---
As either spec you'd absolutely boss any caster around though, and tongues was insanely op vs anything that couldn't decurse. And even if they could, your dots are still ticking while you both are trading curse/decurse globals...
---
Hard to say, depends on who you roll with. My guild on a classic server used DKP as our loot system, the eye wasn't really prio'd to anyone in particular. We did let the Shamans and Druids Duke it out over who should get it with both coming to a pretty mutual understanding that it was fair game for each.
---
It really came down to who had the gold and farming capabilities to gather the resources, most had capped Blacksmithing alts or knew enough folks who could craft/help with various reagents.
---
Long and rambling advice based on what I do, if you want some ideas.
---
Set up as many things as you can and learn them as you level. I typically use the bottom left and right action bars, and at least one of the right side bars. It’s always better to have too many things to put spells than not enough. Through this whole process you want to have when you would use a button in mind. If it’s an “oh shit, time sensitive” button, it better be close to your hand at all times. Your bread and butter, use all the time abilities should be in one area near your hand. For me that’s 1-6. Less frequently used stuff is better on 7-=.
---
From there you want to look at your keyboard and mouse to find any easy to access unbound buttons that you’d want to use. I like to put these random buttons onto my right side bar. For example, the ~ key is right by the 1, easy access, and is unbound by default. I use this as kick, and my side mouse buttons for things like stealth and sprint. Not core abilities, but always right by my hand when I need them. 
---
I then usually bind a whole bar, bottom left, to shift + the number. I like to have these as my CCs, cool downs, potions, bandages. Still easily accessed, but are have less convenient bindings because they are used in less of a hurry or less often.
---
Sequence of abilities is a nice thing to consider also. For example, I like to gouge and bandage immediately in combat. I have gouge as shift 5, and bandage as shift 6. Right there ready for me to use. 
---
Then I just throw the random out of combat consumables or spells on the bottoms left bar and click them. There’s no hurry to be coordinated and hit a button to eat my darnassian bleu, hearth, open first aid, etc. 
---
It's not really a Hunter only thing, but Hunters do it have it easy due to Aspect of the Cheetah and Feign Death
---
on top of simple 1234 and one letter binds. q e r а and so on.
---
what i discovered after years of playing wow, that alt+shift+ctrl modifiers for AWSD is one of the most convinient binds. 
---
cos you don't even need to move your fingers from the default movement position and strech it somewhere.
---
Its quite uninutive, since you don't usually think of binding modifiers for moving keys. since you'd think you occasionally mispress it, but in reality it never happens.
---
also use mouse binds, unbind scroll from zooming, bind it to ctrl+scrollip and ctrl+scroll down instead. so you can use scroll up scroll down for the actual binds. and scroll pressing too. and other buttons if you have them on the mouse.
---
In the time it takes to get that group of 5 to do the group quest and then the instance you could have just killed mob and got just as much xp especially in that level range lots of really good spots
---
It wasn't a ton of players for sure, but it's more then people think it was.  I always hear "23 guilds cleared naxx" and that is just not true.
---
I was doing them as a resto druid... -_- what a blast. A very slow blast.  
---
I said most rather than all because I'm not sure if warriors can do it. Being able to do it doesn't mean it's necessarily the best gold/hr for any given class ofc. I haven't played the class enough to know of the best farming methods so 2-man DM East with a healer / tank for gold / gathering professions is all I can think of right now..
---
I just realised that I replied to the band of brothers comment.. 
---
R is always my CC key. So if I'm playing lock my R key is fear, or if I'm playing mage R would be sheep. I use T as my movement ability. So blink or sprint. I use G as an emergency oh shit button. I might put a healthstone or a defensive cd here. Find a set up you like and stick to it and you will find swapping between characters and binds becomes much easier
---
Good read man. Although your friends ended up disappearing I feel like it was a happy ending for you. Glad you can continue on in life with your new kidney. I'm hopeful we can all make those same connections that made Classic the game we are so fond of. 
---
modifier+mwheel binds are way too precious for zooming, bind that shit to your arrow keys 
---
Ironfoe? Threat generation? Not with its slow weapon speed. Maybe if your lucky with lyrics but I always saw it as too unreliable as a tank weapon
---
Yeah because guilds recruiting ahead of Classic represent 100% of guilds in Classic 
---
No loot system is perfect, they all have various pros and cons. It just comes down to whose running the show
---
Just how much agi really is on low level gear? The answer is not very much unless you're twinked out. Sacrificing +3 agi for +5 spirit? Sign me up any day. Spirit is weird because as a stat it scales off itself. The more spirit you have, the more per point it's worth. If you have no spirit gaining +5 might only give you 5hp/5 but if you have 40 spirit +5 might give you +20hp/5. These are just example numbers but you get the picture. I also generally find spirit to be more common then combat stats while leveling so putting together an armor set that's gonna abuse a certain threshold of spirit probably wouldn't be too difficult. To get over the bag space issue it just might be efficient to rock this gear over your normal set as long as you weren't giving up too much agi.
---
Still helpful. Thanks, bud.
---
I’ve seen it where in progression, tanks generally get loot council while the rest of the raid is DKP. 
---
God damn, fuck my country.

Hi Ryan. Thanks for sharing.

Quick question, what did you mean by:
---
 "Led by the Devil from the Holy Bible, the disgustingly evil group secretly known as the "Illuminati" was defeated today thanks to help from many sources. The group is known to defraud, steal, and practice sexual immortality including rape and child molestation. There are many music artists, actors and world leaders who are apart of this occult. Do not be afraid these people are lazy and have no useful skills. Praise be to God the Most High and repent or suffer in Hell. "
