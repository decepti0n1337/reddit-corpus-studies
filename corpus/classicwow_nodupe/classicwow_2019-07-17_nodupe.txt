It was never super hard, just time consuming.
---
---
---
I don’t think most people have the grit to make it to 60 as a warrior.  I only made it to like 28 or something.  Druid is he only class I actually made it to max level.
---
You raise a number of good points. I agree that the value of the drop to yourself compared to the other classes in your party should be considered, especially if it concerns gear for the spec you aren't leveling with.
---
I got all my fucking and whoring out of the way so i can remain celibate the way blizzard intended.
---
I disagree.   Every spec should be viable in raids.  Pvp doesn't much matter.
---
Spoken like a true rogue!
---
Back in Classic I was a huge loser in high school who played WoW every waking moment outside of school.  
---

---
Now I'm 30 and I'm a huge loser who is single and has no friends and will no life Classic WoW every waking moment outside of work.
---
Oh, nice. I'll remember this tactic for when I want to ninja loot items for my friends.
---
It's the main perk of being a Rogue. Mages get to make food and teleport and Rogues get to ambush people as they fight mobs
---
I mean, if they agreed to the res, they agreed to the res. No ninja required.
---
I don’t think any will quit due to mob competition.
---
They are close.  Ashkandi has higher dps and better stats. Sulfuras does have higher top end damage though.
---
If you want to see how awful the game became after "making all classes equal" and homogenizing everything, try a MoP pserver. The game turns to dogshit.
---
I cant wait for Classic to come out! 
---
I was a freshman in high school in 04 so between 04-06 I had zero responsibilities and zero social life outside of WoW, which was awesome because I was able to play any time after school! I made lots of friends while playing which I miss dearly...
---
Fast forward to now... I have bills to pay but still no major responsibilities (and still zero social life lol) ! I'm currently playing BFA but noticed I dont have the same drive to be online 6+ hours like I did back in the day, and I'm okay with that too! 
---
Any casual players on Uther, wazzup!!!
---
As people have learned 14 years ago, they can learn now. Unless you think thay old vanilla players are the only true Gamerz and that nobody can replicate their performance.
---
Everyone keep saying that wow classic isn't mechanically challenging, retail is harder under the more action-related aspects, retail players will do just fine.
---
I don't have any hard evidence for this but it was a topic of heavy discussion on the Tichondrius server where a moonkin druid stole an Eye of Sulfuras. The consensus among everyone at that time was that the proc would not work in moonkin form, but I don't know if anyone really tested it, it would be interesting if someone can give a firm answer.
---
Because having options is more fun than generic cookie cutter builds.
---
That's pretty much true, but I feel that every spec is more or less viable in pvp, and the same should be true of pve.
---
I getcha, but I'm honestly torn. At least we know what we're getting with a TBC launch. Throwing it up in the air with Classic+ is a little scary after the direction retail took. I mean, sure, maybe our opinions will be valued overall and C+ could be a great experience, but it could also be worse than TBC.
---
What would you think of TBC \*without\* flying being released?
---
&gt;There's no reason to be 31 feral if you're going to be healing.
---
If your healing there is no need to put any points into feral.
---
&gt;keep all of the necessary talents to be able to do whatever you want outside of raids and be flexible.
---
I get it. You want to raid with a non raid spec. No need for 29 in feral if you are going to be healing. Go full resto or hybrid bal/resto as stated.
---
&gt;Losing the point in NS defeats the entire purpose of the hotw spec and leaves you with a gimped tank/dps spec.
---
What is the point of HotW spec then to once every 3m toss large HT on the MT? No it defeats your ability to solo and pvp as well. QQ you are already a welfare class, now you also want to bring a welfare spec..
---
&gt; In addition, having NS is vital if you want to pvp, which is the point of the poster you originally responded to. 
---
No the main topic was if MCPs are required to raid, the next post was both raiding and pvp specs, then the next one (which i replied to) was about pvp. And i my post was saying that not having 31 in feral with hotw builds is a weak spec for raiding.  See two people turned the OP's comment about RAIDing to then pve and pvp then to only PvP. And i was replying I don't care about your pvp spec, for raiding you want to bring this. 
---
Hey guess what, prot warrior isn't a great pvp spec. So what, you wanna raid? You bring a raiding spec. You don't have to. You can find a guild that lets you do whatever you want. However, its not going to be the one i am in (nor a good number of guilds). 
---
&gt; These are the specs where you pick up lotp for the raid.
---
1-2 ferals tops (including hotw). You really don't need hotw druids, unless they are maximizing raid benefits.
---
Woops, you are right lol.
---
I don't want guild banks because the potential for drama is amazing. Guildies are expected to donate all their pots and mats to the guilds bank alt, especially if they want to be an important raid member, the potential there is just amazing.
---
lol, a server noone actually played on. great reference.
---
You are missinformed my friend.
---
By top do you mean below rogues, warriors, warlocks, mages? No boomkin topped charts in vanilla.
---
Anyone who thinks blizzard can make new content for WoW without ruining classic is completely fucking delusional.  This isn't runescape.  Everyone who made classic good no longer works at blizzard/on WoW.  We just fought for ten years to get these servers made, don't push to throw it away in a year.
---
Wife and a 4 month old child. It's going to be a struggle to raid. Haha.
---
See rogue dismount.  Cast PW:Shield.  Pull next mob.
---
Turn 180, pop perception, run away from mob.  Hit psychic scream.  Dot rogue.  Break engagement with mob.  Kill them if you have to.  Get 1-2 more mobs and leave before more show up.
---
I like that he comes back to classic after his genre-bending outland science-fantasy bullshit. Perfect.
---
Hand of Edward the odd did work for boomies in vanilla, I still remember having one drop for my guild during the initial AQ invasion event and playing around with it. The proc chance was relatively low, so it seemed counterintuitive to melee rather than spam starfire. But moonfire spam while meleeing, and then instacast starfire definitely needs to be tested haha
---
That's what I want to know! I don't trust that they'll give us content that's good/what I personally want... Then what, when/if they mess it up? :/
---
Heals don't need to lug that shit around. You aren't going to start farming 1/2 way though raid.
---
"+spell damage and +healing are separate" Not always.
---
yeah man I don't know why, but I love that zone. I always thought it was because my first character was a dwarf. But maybe it has more generic appeal than that? (I like redridge too!)
---
How long do you think it would take for the nostalgia to wear thin?
---
Typical classic player, doesn't get their chicken tendies so they go on a rampage because Layering and Leeway is the new Classic+
---
In Classic you are a random person living in a vast world that doesn't dictate you what to do. In both TBC, Wrath and every following expansion you're pushed in a direction with little choice of your own. Linear storylines, linear zone-progression, linear everything.
---
The whole reason we fought for classic WoW servers was because we wanted the content made by people no longer working at blizzard.  The entire premise of new content beyond naxxramas is counter to the entire driving force behind classic.
---
Trifecta FTW
---
Well, [void Walker already tanks good enough](https://youtu.be/UKKPoWKatns) outside of twin emps.

ReeEeeeE
---
Since you love fallacies so much, I'm sure you're aware of the Fallacy Fallacy? You know, just because somebody's argument may contain a fallacy, it doesn't automatically render it incorrect.
---
This shit is so annoying. Like fight me at full health, initiating a fight when I’m oom and %15 health from tanking two mobs. Weak shit.
---
Guess me wanting to play disc /holy priest is me wanting to play a meme spec. Feelsbadman
---
There are "tutorial tips" that will appear above your action bar as you level in Classic. They aren't as hands on as the newer tutorials but still provide plenty of info to new players.
---
I was 24 in 2004 and played 10+ hours a day on most days, basically any time I wasn't working or sleeping (and sleep is for the weak). My girlfriend was in college a few hours away so I only saw her on weekends. We moved in together just after  TBC launched and that's when I quit wow. I went back and checked out WotLK and Cata when they launched but never played for long.
---
I'm 39 now and married (to the same girl) with two kids. I work second shift and plan to play most nights for a couple hours after work when everyone else is asleep.
---
Way to be hyperbolic
---
You forget that by rolling a rogue/warrior/mage it makes your skill playing that toon increase proportional to their potential DPS. Then if you played them in vanilla, TBC or WOLK it adds a bonus factor that no spreadsheet can truly calculate.
---
Old enough to realize I'm aweful at hunter pvp. Going warlock this time.
---
Honestly just sounds like a huge pain.
---
1. Druid pre hots, goes bear form and gathers a couple of groups, spams swipe. 
---
2. Pally casts HL.
---
3. 3x Frost mages with imp bliz/frostbite cast blizzard from max range, everything dies (or bolt for boss).  
---
  
---
Playing 5 different classes at once sounds really annoying. I guess it depends what your aim is. To have an effective fast team? To have 5 different classes to play at 60? Hellfire just creates more work than it's worth. Hurricane sucks balls and you only get it at lvl 50.
---
I really hope they don't, tbh. :(
---
Right click reporting will be in, which is terrible even in retail
---
No one played one due to the stigma. They were fantastic. Wait until ac comes around again. If the vanilla servers are patching in new content.
---
He replied to me in a personal message for some reason. 
---
Here is what he said :
---
"In what world would a fury warrior consider respeccing to arms for PvE? Come on now.
---
But fine, Id use skilled fighting blade over eshkandar's left claw if I had a good MH dagger!!! Hey look I win!
---
I would not say using an objectively inferior weapon makes you win at anything. Sounds more like a really stupid decision. Sounds a lot like losing, actually.
---
Eshkandar's has more DPS and a higher damage range, and only 0.1 slower attack speed. It's a lot better off hand than the Skilled Fighting Blade." 
---
It appears he thinks you can only use a 2 hander if you are arms spec. 2H fury exists. Also, the stats on your off-hand tend to be more important than the raw damage on them, as those stats boost your main hand damage as well. Additionally, that claw in particular puts an undesirable debuff on the boss, making it very bad for PvE. 4 Weapon skill is alot more valuable than a bit of dps.
---
Hmmm. Blessing of light procs?  Probably need a token healer or two. Maybe only druid heals?
---
I agree with you. Just a little notice, it's a lot not alot lol
---
I think people will quit because they've already spent a good chunk of their life in this game before, and 15 years later they have better things to do, but it will be fun to stir up some nostalgic memories for a bit.
---
As for the new players, they will probably enjoy it as long as they go in understanding what the game is, a slow paced MMO.
---
Many people would just go back to private servers if they forced us to go to TBC.
---
Oh man, I remember 3.0 ret. I was PVP'ing and destroying max level characters while being a good 5 levels under them. I was unstoppable.
---
I think I had just turned 19 as I started around February.   
---
There are so many actual babies here... WHY WERE YOUR PARENTS LETTING YOU PLAY AN MMO AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE!?
---
&gt; Those two will make you an amazing 5 man tank at 60.
---
Obtaining Mark of Tyranny is easy. Leveling enchanting is not.
---
I'm hoping to start or find a Dad's guild haha.
---
This is why you don't get invited to parties
---
tbc has hord paladin and alliance shaman. that alone makes it shit.
---
&gt; Since you love fallacies so much, I'm sure you're aware of the Fallacy Fallacy?
---
Yep, and pretty much any time someone brings it up on the internet they identify it incorrectly.
---
&gt; You know, just because somebody's argument may contain a fallacy, it doesn't automatically render it incorrect.
---
I never said it was incorrect just because of the fallacy, just that it was a bad argument because it's fallacious.
---
The joke here is that you justify master looter being on "just in case" by claiming one reserved item nobody really cares about, then just ninja other stuff.
---
Which is exactly what people are going to expect when you do that.
---
Is that not how it worked in Vanilla?
---
Yeah; your plan for playtime I think is going to be really, really common among *actual* returning Vanilla WoW veterans.
---
I’ll keep that in mind. My reaction and finger agility is lacking as I have grown old. But I guess I will get a good practice doing things like this when I start to play on a pvp server:) I have developed a decent macroing ability at least.
---
 They all have some use.  Even sentry totem.
---
I remember waiting in a quest boss to spawn.  I dropped my sentry totem where he was supposed to spawn and I killed other mobs in the area.  When the boss spawned I was able to see him and I went back there and killed him.
---
That’s the only time I recall ever using it though.
---
If you’re going with a mix of 5 classes because you want to have 5 different classes for endgame stuff then that sounds alright to me but just going triple mage dps would be vastly superior if you’re interested in farming dungeons for gold at max level. 
---
I’m going to be 40 boxing and will be pulling some wacky shenanigans to level so I’m not too concerned about 5 man content but I strongly believe a prot pally tank+resto druid specced into +75% thorns damage and 3 frost or fire mages is by far the best comp for multiboxing. Mages stack extremely well together and your tank will never lose aoe threat. Your druid will also be doing crazy aoe damage just by casting thorns every 10 minutes.
---
I have seen a few people discuss it on here. I assume there will be some. My wife will be pretty cool about it but I doubt my son will when my wife is at work haha.
---
Who cares about 26 stamina in PvE? What a joke. You lost the argument. Don't cry.
---
Many will just flat out quit all together if they just sit stagnant at the end of Vanilla indefinitely as well.  Moving to TBC would bring new players and bring some of those that quit back.
---
Even if it's done in the same spirit as Classic? I have that worry too, though: that if Classic+ content was created it would just go the way of retail...just...quicker. :/
---
I got one of those razer orbweavers a few years back and it make life so much easier in mmo's where you need all the keybinds.
---
I haven't seen anyone else mention having the same drive to play for a long period of time. I thought maybe I was alone in that feeling. I doubt I will have the patience to sit still long enough to raid anymore... especially if I get that nagging feeling that I'm neglecting something that needs to be done.
---
It's alright though, I'm fine with being a filthy casual. Can't wait to play!
---
&gt; in a year we're going to be talking about how Blizzard should add WoW tokens to the game to combat all the gold sellers.
---
You just threw all your credibility out with that line
---
Thanks:) yes I loved it back in vanilla so I will try to find that good warrior feeling again.
---
This is not necessarily true because of the interaction between backpedaling and leeway, there may be times where backpedaling allows you to avoid damage you would otherwise take if strafing.
---
IMO that was a great change, because it allowed blizzard to balance the shaman and paladin specs.   
---
Ever wonder why paladins couldn't tank in Vanilla?  It's because blizzard couldn't fix them without breaking the faction balance of the game.  It simply would not be fair to let the alliance have 2 tanks.
---
You can run low level dungeons with 4 dps and 1 healer. It doesn't really matter who the mobs are hitting at that level.
---
Lmk when you drop one for Stormwind, you’ve got some serious talent.
---
First i advise to get a mouse with at least 2-4 extra buttons.
---
my way is too 1-5 keyboard and mouse has 6-8 from extra buttons with Shift and Ctrl with the same numbers. 
---
for the mouse buttons you want your instant cast/life saving spells this is so you have as little movement when pressing them.
---
for example Frost nova on 6 (mouse forward button) something gets close i can always use this while moving away (either WASD or L/R click hold) while my Shift+6 is Iceblock this stops me from hitting Iceblock when i dont mean too.
---
While 1-5 are more of my casting/channel spells one i know i want to stay still to use i have the spells that i use the most on 3 and 4 because i find those numbers easier to press with my hand positioning.
---
i normally have buffs set to Ctrl 1-8 because they are little less useful in combat normally applied before but if something removes a buff u have them at hand if need be you can also add food to these or consumables having one key modifier to consumables and pots helps if you run multiple characters as well because less placements you have to remember.
---
you said you plan on maining a mage but if you do run other classes as well it helps to have abilitys that are similar on the same keybindings (example if use frost bolt the most and its on 3 and than you roll a healer you want you main healing spell on 3 as well get used to the positing of you main spells.
---
Also have wand shoot bound to a key 1s fine when running out of mana its a pain if you cant find it.
---
The phrase "where do we draw the line" is itself hyperbolic.  It's just a thinly veiled slippery slope fallacy.
---
There are tons of people mad about layering
---
I think the 2-3k people per layer will be once people have spread out. Initially it will be a lot lower so there are not too many people in the starting areas. The reason I think this is because when they launched a new server back in vanilla they always had a much lower pop cap initially and slowly raised it as people spread out. I think competition for mobs will not be that bad outside of named quest mobs.
---
Private servers are subject to being deleted any any moment.  I would be sick to have /40 days played time on a private server just to have it all taken away in the blink of an eye.
---
But if you think that playing on one for “free” is worth that risk then go for it.
---
Sorry but this is factually incorrect
---
I'm there... but lord help me ever trying to find it.
---
You can not win this argument its just too funny.

Same age here, friend! I'm 39 now and still single but work &amp; priorities are (begrudgingly 🙄) greater than game time. Here's to us oldies who are still die-hard at heart!
---
I'm 35 as well, with no children. Married to a fellow gamer. I'll definitely be using any free time I get to play. On days off, I'll make sure to get any chores squared away bright and early, so hopefully I'll have no distractions pulling me away.
---
I think the video clearly shows that pirate servers had a leeway mechanic very much like the one Classic will have, because the attacker's melee range magically increases when they strafe. It also shows that melee hitting people from *way* outside any remotely plausible range for their weapons is also what pirate server players should be used to.
---
Whether it's exactly the same or not is not really the point, as I see it. The point is that Classic behaviour is very close to pirate server behaviour, hence the Chicken Littles proclaiming that hunter is a dead class and tauren warrior is the new master of the universe are being silly. If there is any difference it is not a very big difference.
---
Just use windury and Strength of earth totems and im happy.
---
Probably true, but for my sake I hope they don't.
---
Wow this is really amazing. I want to see more of this artist please!
---
I have the same plan as you
---
Was there ever a time you had to stop raid in the middle of it then go farm then start raiding again? 
---
Or do you mean while leveling? While leveling you MAY find 2-3 items to switch for priest and maybe paladins (spec depending). Shamans would need to switch if going from melee to healing.
---
So no they will not lose A BAG SLOT. Which was the claim. 
---
None of them need 3rd gear sets.
---
You. I like you.
---
Im not angry and I didn't ragequit to a PvE server lol
---
The only addon I'm really curious about is the AH addons, I've had such a hard time finding one that works properly. Apparently over at the TSM subreddit people are saying they wont bother making an addon until Classic has proved itself popular, would be very happy to be proved wrong on this though.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I want to play the AH fairly aggressively and it's going to be much harder without a proper addon.
---
Hi, pserver player here, I had multiple 60s on every pserver since Emerald Dream (many years ago). The first thing I noticed after playing Classic Beta for about 1 minute was how much longer my melee range was on warrior. 
---
I would agree with you, itssang, that OP decided to write this post with the intention to show that the leeway was about the same. And in the video, it does look almost the same. I can tell you the extra 0.5 yards or whatever it might be, though it *looks* small, *feels* really significant. Like I said I noticed within the first minute of playtime how significant this change was before anyone was talking about it on the subreddit or in-game. It was actually the first bug I filed out of 50 or so bugs I submitted during my few days of playtime. This is an anecdote obviously but I think significant in the context of our discussion.
---
You're right that OP's intention was to show how it's not that big of a difference and that private servers have been playing with leeway for years (and we have) but the pictured difference despite looking small is actually very significant when you live it and feel it playing the game.
---
!remindme 1 year
---
Folks this thread should be located in the weekly LFG Monday thread. Due to the amount of conversation this will remain open, but any future recommend post will need to go into the aforementioned thread.
---
This is fucking fantastic
---
I was 7 in 2004 Lol. I’m 22 now. I really didn’t play until early BC with my older brother.
---
I only wanted to play feral Druid cause you were a cat. And yep I’m going to main feral this time too.
---
Is that the number now? Not being a dick, just wondering if death toll has changed from new data.
---
i was like 12 and didnt know about wow and now im not 12. i know about wow now but i still have about the same life responsibility and will be playing 10+ hours a day
---
Why would you?
---
Yeah, I agree 100%. Although noticeably longer than in pservers, I actually don't think it will make much of a difference in practice. Ranged classes have a lot more going for them than enemies being restricted to an 8 yard maximum melee range. Increasing it to 8.5 yards won't be a big deal.
---
The attack range values should be kept as they were in vanilla.
---
Neither elemental nor enchantment provide mana tide totem seeing how it's the 31 of resto.
---
*rubs hands vociferously*
---
Isn't the parry chance of bosses much higher on classic? Like 14% as opposed to 6%. That's a near 10% threat loss for MT.
---
Retro is using the core that nost made public after they shut down.
---
Oh yea I'm sure you have proof that its overtuned, that every private server has just ignored all these years.
---
&gt; unless you are good and prepared and have a healer.
---
Really, a pocket healer will go a long way to make up for being mediocre and unprepared.
---
As a proud Republican I will continue voting for people who deny global warming exists so I can continue hoarding money from oil investments to prepare for the inevitable collapse of human civilization. Then I will move my elitist guild to the PvE server of Mars while Earth remains a barren PvP shithole stripped of it's resources. MAGA!
---
Yes, it's a common trait of people who have nothing going on in their life.

It's actually funny watching how much in denial people still are about their idea that Vanilla was actually difficult despite every evidence to the contrary.

That's not how MangOS works, mate. All private servers use [the same server client.](https://www.getmangos.eu/)

Except there's already a shitload of changes.

thats actually pretty dope
---
Why do you refuse to answer my question?
---
There are more reasons to dislike a class other than world PvP you know. Are you a rogue player?
---
kill the pet first
---
Are prot pallies not viable in classic?
---
Not that it matters, if you're not holy you're not doing it right, but I'm curious.

maybe all the people that would have been borne from those 20m dead?
---

Shamans &gt; Paladins any day in vanilla

Yeah and I've voiced my opinion on how it's a bad idea. Unfortunately we're getting Classic from 2019 Blizzard which are laughably out of touch
---
ill join a guild after i hit 60 because layers
---
People did the math back in the day, and determined it wasn't worth farming.
---
Mages having remove curse makes it so you only need one druid in a raid for motw, fairyfire and thorns. Sure they have inervate and combat res but that is more of a bonus and never actually needed in a raid plus you have one of each already whit the needed druid
---
Ed, edd, &amp; eddy and Vanilla WoW. Two staples of my childhood.
---
Yet, I can only give one upvote.
---
My comments were about how 0/31/20 is a bad feral spec. Hotw is not the optimal raid spec, no argument here, but losing NS, which is not for raids, defeats the reason for going hotw. If you want to pick up lotp, go for a real feral spec instead.
---
If your problem with this thread is that people are recommending hotw as a feral raid spec, then recommend a real feral raid spec. 0/31/20 is not a feral raid spec. Your options are 11/33/7 and 14/31/5 +1.
---
Hey buddy I missed you
---
If you can't get ganked what possible reason is there to hate a class? Your logic doesn't make sense and you dodged my question.
---
Druids are great tanks for caster mobs, since the huge HP pool is really the only mitigation outside resists.
---
Don't listen to the above poster. Esfand only showed that while dueling with a player who is purposefully letting you swing hundreds of times in order to exploit server lag, it's possible to generate reck stacks—something that was possible in Vanilla, too, but completely irrelevant for any actual gameplay.
---
Obviously in practice there's no point cause you have to stand in the same spot and channel over and over, but you can do the same thing with looting and then moving a step to cancel the animation and "instant loot". And then immediatly start tapping the node again
---
85mill?  And also it's not just my family but the millions of people who were born due to their family fleeing nazi germany
---
Discord is still a social app, it's simply different from the old forums. I expect many WoW Server specific Discords to crop up.
---
What your saying is spot on. Whats your thoughts on the 14% parry and prot? Obviously fury will be hitting from behind so no parry.
---
Druids are by *far* better dungeon tanks than Warriors, simply because of the ease with which they hold threat on large numbers of mobs.  Great for lategame when people want to start zerging!
---
Thanks for sharing
---
Just at a glance, raiding isn't all that matters. Most pvp hunters will have more points in survival than anything, and BM is great for 5 mans and leveling (and some will have intimidation/scatter build).
---
Saying 2/3 hunter specs are trash due to there being an optimal raiding spec isnt accurate.
---
Perplexity video shows something complete different. You're obviously biased so this isn't at all proof of private servers having the same leeway is in classic.
---
Ha nothing wrong with getting them hooked young.
---
My TBC was world top 50 through all content. We cleared T5 content in its first killable form before the huge rounds of nerfs. I'd say raids were still 15 carriers and 10 being carried.
---
Maybe for a hardcore SRS BUSNSS guild, but for a laidback guild that has a few memespecs, it sounds like fun.
---
You really believe ganking is literally the only reason to dislike a class? And you dodged my question first and havn't answered even one of my two questions...
---
Anyways, Rogues, and I imagine you are a Rogue player, which is why I asked, often are just annoying people to deal with, like you, hence I asked if you were one. Are you?
---
Is that the bell curve for population growth? Time to go down the google hole.
---
A little more.  As your raid progresses, the warriors go dps spec and equip dps items to maintain threat.   Druids don't have to do this.
---
That person is doing the fight wrong.   You should be spamming the tank with heals.   It doesn't matter AT ALL if the tank dodges an attack, because you aren't cancelling the heals.
---
Not valid.  No one is saying that a druid should be the sole MT.  Heck, even guilds usually rotate the MT role between warriors so multiple people have experience doing it.
---
&gt; Druids have to farm the exact same consumes as Warrior tanks. 
---
Except they don't have to use them as the Offtank.  
---
&gt; No shit. 
---
lol, it was a stupid argument to begin with.  Don't get mad at me because of it.
---
Paladin spec'd retribution
---
SoC does a flat damage percentage based on your weapon's top end damage.
---
All the ranks of SoC do the exact same math. The only thing that changes is the JoC proc, which is not worth casting because it's a DPS loss in combat. So save your money and don't buy SoC ranks.
---
Yes it is
---
Source: I’m some dude, and it looks about right to me
---
I hope that happens to me!
---
So if the majority of us are 60 would you join?
---
Maybe best vanilla rogue. Obviously retail rogues are way better than him.
---
You seem to miss the point of Vanilla completely. Most of these trees you list are perfectly fine. They are just not raid trees. Not everything is or should be about raiding.
---
There's also no such thing as "specs". You have talent trees. In the case of Arcane you see that tree as trash but it's not. The Arcane tree is meant to supplement either Fire or Frost, and you choose how deep in the tree you want to go to do so.
---
Same with Warlock. Your dots are PvP and solo abilities. Not raid abilities.
---
You are applying a retail mindset to a game that just isnt all about endgame raiding.
---
They do look a bit short but I think those thick calves are just leather boots.
---
Tell me more about these demon dicks
---
&gt; You have to watch healer mana, mark targets, etc.
---
These two roles can be performed by a designated puller who is not the tank, like a hunter or mage. I was considering rolling a hunter for a long time because it's fun to set the tempo and strategy for the group, but you have to convince everyone you meet that you don't suck before they let you do all that, and if they suck they still won't.
---
Maybe some day there will be a WoW that takes TBC class design, and injects it into the classic world. It is all ive ever wanted.
---
I wonder if the confusion was from US players playing on EU private servers. Now that the Classic servers are US based and their pings are lower they are noticing this.
---
I'm going with priest. Versatile with all three specs and has a lot of power in both PvP and PvE. They suck to level and aren't great raid dps but they have a place with every role so I'll take it.
---
I mean it's the hardcore players who won't mind constantly respeccing back and forth and keeping 2 sets of gear. Its us filthy casuals who are already having nightmares about being  asked to  respec to a pure healer. But yeah like the other guy said look at classes that basically use the same abilities for both pvp and pve like mages.
---
I agree.  plus when the party dies down, if you haven't scored, just hop on yo laptop and get some drunk gameplay goin'.
---
I swear they already answered the melee leeway thing before - maybe not.  
---
That cone of cold line is going to make some mage players I have been listening to sad for sure.
---
The first 12 months of vanilla was just a blur of trying to fix broken stuff and open more servers. After that twelve months they made a decision to put vanilla on just 'small-fix' mode and bake all of the big important changes for the game into a future expansion. When naxx was released and were doing the shaman talents they would have already fairly well finalised ele/enhance design for TBC where they knew what and how to make those specs viable there. They didn't put them in vanilla because they considered it as a flawed but final game - it was time to move on.     
---
     
---
If you want to look at intent for vanilla you just need to look at TBC. They wanted some sort of end game pvp that wasn't just mindless grinding. They wanted all specs to be viable in raiding. They wanted there to be things to do at end game instead of just raiding. They wanted pets to not just be a liability in raiding. They wanted people to be able to use dots in raids.      
---
      
---
So yeah what they wanted for vanilla doesn't really matter. It is how it is, as silly and wonky and annoying as it is it was brilliant, and it's the same game they're bringing back.  
---
Now if you want to talk about 12 months down the track when all the content is out and people are no longer just about recreating a 12 year old game but thinking about what sort of game Classic should be for the next 10 years that people will want to play, that is a whole other question.
---
if we were on the same realm/raid schedule, probably
---
The "haha" is the hardest hitting part of the entire meme for me.
---
5 priests = ideal group.

---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/classicwow) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
These are the classes I think don't have to respec to be viable in both PVE and PVP. While they won't be the absolute best at either, they'll still bring enough value to raids and premades.
---
* Mage as Deep Frost
---
* Rogue as Seal Fate Daggers
---
* Priest as Discipline
---
* Hunter as Marksmanship
---
* Paladin as Holy
---
* Warlock as SM/Ruin
---
My personal three will be Priest, Mage, and Rogue.
---
Everything except meme specs
---
I would say the flip side is that you have the most control over if the group succeeds. 
---
The reason I like tanking is because when I do, things go smoothly. that's really it. I am tempted to roll a mage, but every time I do, I think about pugging dungeons as a ranged dps. And sitting there while the tank and healer scream at each other, and I just don't want to do that. 
---
I also like that I can just not do a group with anyone. Seriously. About a week a go, I was on a pserver, in a group tanking deadmines. Some warlock asked if we could do the undead for the quests outside the instance. 
---
I said sure. I always do. No one said anything against it. I figured "okay, we are doing the stuff outside the instance". 
---
I ran over to the start of those mobs, and it was me and the warlock who asked for it, and the other 3 guys had not joined us. And not even "requested we not do it in chat". Just flat out ignored this warlock because they couldn't be bothered to even type anything. 
---
And then when we were there, no  "oh, sorry, I didn't read that", from the guys who didn't even give the warlock the courtesy of a RESPONSE telling them they couldn't spare 5 minutes of their precious time to help him out. Then after they were waiting, and we were waiting, in separate locations? They all of a sudden NOW feel that it's worth the effort of talking in party chat about  how it takes too long, etc, etc.
---
So I suicided and dropped group. And left 3 of those jackasses standing at the entrance to deadmines with no tank. (and admittedly, stranded a warlock, which was too bad). 
---
But if you are good at tanking..... it's so easy to have a good dungeon run, you just feel ZERO obligations to go out of your way for shitty dungeon runs. 
---
I think one of the reasons everyone else might hate private server players and I like them a lot, is that because I am a tank, I just never DEAL with these people. I could have been stuck, as a rogue, with those jerks for like an hour, because I desperately wanted to get to roll against the tank for cruel barb. As a tank? the single worst part of that experience was 8 minutes of res sickness. 
---
When you are tank, bad group members matter so much less, and when they do matter, you have so much less incentive to put up with it.
---
I switched to the corsair schmiter recently but after two days my thumb and right hand started getting rsi. Went back to keyboard
---
&gt; That person is doing the fight wrong.
---
That is completely besides the point. The important part is this bit: *"The druid had a larger buffer when getting hit by hateful strikes, but the the number of hatefuls he dodged, parried, or had miss was a lot lower. This meant that the total healing per second healers had to output on him needed to be much higher. I couldn't understand why the fight felt so much more difficult than previous until I broke down the attempts in SW Stats. I was blown away by how large the difference was, Patchwerk seemed like the perfect fight for a druid OT, they have huge HP and armor... But ultimately having to eat a 10 to 15% higher number of hateful strikes made healing the druid far more stressful."*
---
&gt;Ever wonder why paladins couldn't tank in Vanilla?  It's because blizzard couldn't fix them without breaking the faction balance of the game.  It simply would not be fair to let the alliance have 2 tanks.
---
You dont fix these issues by homogenizing. You fix it by diversifying further.
---
Make Protpaladin an actual good AoE tanking spec and make sure to include plenty of pve content where AoE tanking is needed.
---
In turn, let Horde be the only faction with Bloodust.
---
Things like that would be the game a lot more interesting than trying to balance everything. Which was a fools errand to start with.
---
A close second place to this is the Balance Druid.
---
Short and sweet.
---
For a hardcore player, I'm not aware of a single spec where the absolute best for PvP and PvE is identical. That said, there are some close ones. Warlock's SM/Ruin is only \~5% worse than DS/Ruin, and is amazing for PvP. I'd argue that frost mages can run a solid PvP/PvE spec, especially if you're willing to give up mana talents (often unnecessary). Warrior would not be suitable, nor would rogue. PvE spec'd healers would probably be ok in PvP.  
---
In terms of gearing, you're going to have to give something up. For sure. Even when your BiS is identical for PvP and PvE, the enchants are not. Stamina is king in PvP, where as extra health is near useless on a mage in PvE, or any DPS for that matter.  
---
Any caster should be better than a melee in terms of flexibility.
---
Awwh yeah. 26 years old and still rockin' that V-card, baby. Trump 2020!
---
Your assumptions and opinions aren't any more valid than mine. There's no reason to assume that the Vanilla servers will transition into TBC, forcing all those players into the expansion whether they want it or not.
---
They didn't mention PVE so people said that they only tested pvp and it shouldn't apply to pve.
---
why should every spec be viable in raids? in order to do this you must break any semblance of class diversity and treat every spec as its own class.
---
this is part of what kills retail for me, you are no longer a mage, you are a fire mage and you for some reason forgot how to cast half your frost spells?
---
immersion and flavor are more important then balance.
---
Yah, that's kind of a fucked up comment.
---
How about DM farming that to completely avoid any player or environmental sources of danger in the world?   How about world buff stacking to completely avoid any player or environmental sources of danger in the world?  This WPVP fantasy is just that... A fantasy.  It's never been largely prevalent and never will be.
---
I hate dailies.  We can agree on that.
---
Vanilla Pvp is crap.  TBC isn't much better.
---
idk what that means.  Never even played FF.
---
Badges is a great system to helps people catch up.
---
BC &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vanilla
---
I think a pally might be able to OT core hounds and such.
---
Well you’re not wrong haha
---
I am not planning on raiding until I've got most pre-BIS. o . O
---
And I can easily level those characters during their limited rest-XP periods.
---
You don't have to power level to get -into- a raid, since most people /aren't/ power-leveling. wat.
---
All of this is based on speculation and no one knows how it will be. I for one, will be grinding out from launch and I think it will be fine and for the people that want to wait, even better, less competition for me.
---
As i said, you have the luxury of both. You can go in the world and farm some dongeon to DE stuff and sell on AH. Or simply chill on IF bridge and profit.
---
Wow, the no glow is a lot better

&lt;Empire&gt; Alliance | NA | Hardcore | Late Night | Raiding and PvP guild on a PvP Server 
---
&lt;Empire&gt; is currently recruiting passionate players who want to push for the top level of our server. There's power in numbers so we're recruiting just about anyone but we want our raiders to be dedicated and ready to work to be the strongest guild on the server.
---
Raid Times: Tue/Wed/Thur 12am-3am EST, potential 4th night added as content phases progress and potential need for a 4th night comes
---
Our leadership is comprised of experienced players and leaders so far who want to succeed as a team, and we're ready to put in the work to make it happen. Below you'll find our discord server, I'd recommend reading our welcome introduction and then filling out the very simple and straightforward, quick application note if you're interested.
---
https://discord.gg/Bq2fgnD
---
We look forward to hearing from you!
---
I’m worried I’m gonna pick the wrong class and hate it and end up making 10 alts and never getting 60
---
I dont get the pretty races argument. I mainly played alliance but Orcs and Tauren just look better than humans imo.
---
I think the starting zones and cities are much nicer on the alliance though.
---
Durotar is soo plain. If i want to see red dirt for miles ill look out my window( I live in Australia).
---
I really like Mulgore though
---
I thought about that hit talent for about 2 seconds until I remembered that warriors don't have a hit % talent.
---
Purposely wait till they *almost* kill the mob and are low health for maximum gank
---
Then execute rank 5 will probably also not put you into combat. It also has the "Does not engage the target" tag on classic wowhead. All other ranks of execute don't have it. Kinda weird.
---
Druid: Resto
---
Hunter: Marksmanship
---
Mage: Arcane/Frost, Deep Frost, and Fire (after AQ opens)
---
Paladin: Holy
---
Priest: Discipline, Holy, and Shadow (but only one per raid and only if your raid has 4+ Warlocks)
---
Rogue: Combat Swords, Combat Daggers, and Seal Fate Daggers (around AQ quality gear)
---
Shaman: Resto
---
Warlock: DS/Ruin, SM/Ruin
---
Warrior: Prot, Fury
---
I literally didn't read what you said, mainly because i already agree on the point and just wanted to say that shit is boring when things are equal, shit is also boring when things are out of your control. Finding a balance of what you can control and what others can control and combine that with cooperation = good
---
I can't see this without thinking of that song from The Prince of Egypt.
---
"Lord of all remember us, here in this buuuurning saaaand."
---
Remove layering.
---
Arent there more humans and dwarves than night elves?
---
People say the same goofy thing about shamans.  It's not true.
---
&gt; use those 43 people
---
lol
---
Sure, the private servers just pulled numbers out of their ass.
---
Probably won't join a guild til 60 also. I've been watching the Wednesday posts and screenshotting guilds that match my goals and raid times, and will be keeping an eye out for what severs they join to get a better chance of having a match.
---
Wouldn’t it make more sense to give the better item to the people with lower dps? So the warlock can catch up to mage dps
---
what an incredibly underwhelming list that is, holy shit
---
I guess a lot of the horde racials have pvp applications so it makes sense
---
Not the first time I've noticed you on this sub and just had to tell you, that you're a pathetic lowlife, man.
---
Your answers and discussions just reflect your low self-esteem. Every single time.
---
Tailoring and enchanting warlock. Going to level fast and grind out those rare recipies.
---
Player rep doesn't matter in that instance, I couldn't give less of a fuck what the other faction think of me.
---
Sure, so could an enhance shaman XD. Naw, you're right tho. I left Pally tanks off alltogether as most wouldn't consider them viable for all content.
---
The funny thing is there are people like me that are fine either way. If no changes winds out, I'll play until I get bored of the content. If either Classic+ or BC comes out, I'll happily keep playing.
---
That's what ~~paid level boost~~ Ebay is for my friend.
---
Thank you very much for posting that. That was very impactful.
---
Lol, this site is blocked at work because of...*Category:  dating*
---
So by your rationale, the equivalent minority’s that do vote for their best interest in democratic run shitholes like Philadelphia and Newark for multiple generations are living their best life? Interesting theory.
---
I wonder why those are the worst places to live in America? I would think after 50-80 years of those liberal policies things would finally start to improve, hmmm...
---
not gonna lie, our druids all did that when we downed a boss.  one feral and the rest were resto.
---
This person played vanilla.
---
I’m planning on playing priest and this is exactly my concern.
---
Oof that's rough, he was private Ryan then.  Luckily my great grandparents were able to secure passage out of Austria before things started getting to bad
---
Yeah, being part of the madness of a real mmo launch, especially one you know for a fact is going to be a good game is really exciting.
---
Nobody on the alliance side can wield nightfall while still doing respectable dps (top 5 if you include 15% of caster dps during Nightfall uptime as the ret paladins dps) while still also being on par with the healers in healing while also bringing raid utility and dispels. 
---
So no actually, 8/8 t1 ret paladin with nightfall is the best hybrid in the game for raiding imo and sure hunters spamming wing clip have marginally more nightfall uptime, but no raid utility.
---
Lived in NYC for 10 years, but in NJ now - have 2 kids and a family lol.  Wouldn't mind just chilling and having a good time.
---
Dont take things out of context, lol.
---
Must have been a faulty one for sure. Mine is super good. Super clear, even if its right next to a fan.
---
If you're getting Vael to 2% the difference could easily be another real DPS instead of a Ret or making all of your mages spec frost.
---
If you're downing Nef and waiting for AQ to open, sure an enhancement shaman is going to be viable, but you could probably kill Nef with 39 players too.
---
Not every talent build is viable at every stage of the game.
---
Hoping to get my hunter leveled fast enough to get some devilsaur skinning done.
---
After I get the set for myself and a bit of selling I'll start gearing up in earnest.
---
Once I'm no longer getting meaningfull upgrades outside of lockouts it's Mara run time.
---
Depending if I'm on 310 duty or not I'll relearn professions to herb Engi, or wait till resist cloaks are done.
---
Was planning on having a transmute alt as a priority, but I'll save that till I'm bleeding out the eyes from gold farming.
---
That's more or less what TBC was.
---
Maybe he or both of us should have 2 characters? How do we play if we are totally different levels?
---
Eh, you really didn't need that many unless you were trying to use shadowburn for dps.  
---
You could get 1 shard off of each trash kill since dps didn't matter, and you needed at most 3 or so per pull.
---
I believe someone in your party has to be in combat with them in order to get the hk.  For example, if someone is just about to die and I purge them just before they die you get an hk.
---
I’ve never seen it written out before, but this was actually true in high school. Wonder if it will work this way with my wife, probably not.
---
Honor doesn’t care how much damage you do.  You get full honor whether you did 100% damage or 0
---
Pretty sure Warlock is what you're looking for. Raid spec is also PVP spec and there's minimal gear swapping between the two
---
This is correct.
---
My old 19 twink rogue, Beertaster of the Twink Guild Laguna Beach had a crazy high dodge rate.
---
shrug
---
Your title should read "World PvP: To not be a piece of shit vs being a piece of shit."
---
Wut??  Frost mage works very well in PvP...
---
You can 'get away with' playing pvp spec in raids or pve spec in bgs just fine as a mage.
---
No dude
---
They didn't exist from day 1, some took almost *2 years*
---
It's a *much larger change* than having guild banks.
---
In fact, some of the class changes are closer in time to TBC than to vanilla release.
---
We didn't have the raid UI in vanilla either. We aren't going to have healbot and decursive game-breaking mechanics.
---
There are much more massive changes to classic that will make it better than vanilla, what's wrong with a guild bank?
---
Gbanks were literally one of the most requested features during vanilla, because account sharing was an actual problem.
---
Class changes? Itemization changes? Whatever. Guild banks? REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
In vanilla you were the story.  In tbc and wotlk you were the main char in blizzard's handheld story.
---
Thanks, I haven't heard that song in a while.
---
49. Classes have virtually all their PvP relevant abilities but the gear gap between players is much smaller than at max level. Great bracket to stop at forever for a pure PvP alt. I really enjoy the variety of playing a lot of different classes so the bracket is perfect for me.
---
/r/definitelynotmeirl
---
He’s thinking about being a healer so I was thinking mage because it sounds strong and people say it’s easy to learn.

There’s also a huge difference between playing a spec in legion, where blizz has taken painstaking measures to get everyone within 5-10% of each other, and vanilla, where classes had unique identities and some specs kinda just suck

You had me confused for a minute lol
---
I tank everything and I’m anti-reserving loot to the core. Shit like that really sucks the fun out of the game. If you’re in my group, you can roll on the loot. We’ll all get our pieces eventually and we’ll all have the enjoyable moment of winning the RNG roll fair and square.
---
Do what you want, obviously, but your attitude is a plague on the game, right up there with boosting, and I condemn it in the most fist shaking way.
---
About 350.

It worked!

It's my understanding everything is "viable" except oomkins and ret / prot pallys.
---
ye 6 secs
---
keying always only showed if you had keys
---
Very cool
---
Nope. You're going to have to actually cheat on her. Can't let her get too comfortable.
---
I still don't understand your reasoning.
---
Yes, those did in fact change the game quite a bit, but all those changes happened within the confines of Vanilla. Anything added after 1.12 should not be in Classic. 
---
How is this hard to grasp?
---
It really depends on the class. My 29 hunter was good times, but that’s also a fun time for shamans because of ghost wolf. 
---
39 is great for Druids if you want to run the flag because no one has mounts.
---
I will level a paladin (my main), and make a hunter, and a mage on the same day.
---
If youre failing at 2% you probably need your raid members to get the mechanics down better, react faster, and not take unnecessary damage.
---
Talent stagnation, as opposed to vanilla wow when you got to pick between a couple shit talents.
---
You can't raid without Trueshot Aura.
---
&gt; I have not seen any mention of it being reproducible in the Classic Beta.
---
This is exactly why I asked...
---
Dude, I played the fucking Beta and had 2 Keys ...no Keyring!
---
I mean, i wasn't talking about on a progression pull. I meant during farm content with an extra warrior to tank if (i.e. when) it inevitably fails and you get squished.
---
I think he made me watch a video of that
---
No ques. Get running
---
Frost pve spec is atrocious in pvp.
---
This.
---
I remember seeing 350-400ms and thinking "low ping today".
---
Then every time someone complained about lag in vent, I asked how high their ping went.
---
When they came back with 180-200 I used to get so triggered.

My memory I only did it once, we had a shaman, me as mage, a warrior, I had to use potions, constant cooldowns to keep my mana up, was always moving and always felt behind when I was drinking. We barely made the timer.  I was full rank 10 blue + random pieces. All my gear except trinkets had spell power on it, but few pieces were raid pieces if I even had any. I may have had a few ZG set pieces, MAYBE.
---
I like all the brackets equally since instead of twinking, I sell overpriced twink items for massive profits :D
---
Hahaha
---
&gt; This is known as a slippery slope fallacy, and is a very poor argument. There is no reason to assume making a specific change would inevitably lead to an infinite number of other changes.
---
The slippery slope fallacy relies on the idea that there will be unintended events related to a decision. In this case we're talking about a decision (to make ANY changes) with intended events (changes).
---
Took me over 500 runs to get. I wanted it for my alliance DK so bad.
---
Feral can tank nef, maybe not optimal but as alliance especially.
---
fear ward can be used to negate the fear and if using stoneshield pots even when the class call comes out and puts you in cat form you still have more then enough armor to survive crits/crushings, at most he crits you for like 3500 on pservs which isnt a very big deal because its almost entirely only the tank who takes damage.
---
maybe if the damage is crazily different on classic it might change but i doubt it, pservs seem to have damage output overtuned if anything.
---
Chromaggus is an issue because of not being able to use the sands without shifting out of bear form and he hits quite hard.
---
Huhuran can be tanked by feral but the reason its not advisable is that you are likely more useful to be casting abolish poison on people.
---
also she does hit fairly hard in enrage but there is no reason a feral is "not viable" here, sub optimal sure, but definitely viable.
---
no reason you cannot tank twin emps? in fact its probably one of the better fights for a druid tank because you have downtime waiting for the boss to teleport so you have tons of time to stoneshield pot and you can also shift off the snare when you are not tanking.
---
there is even bosses where druid is actually a better tank than warrior such as:
---
patchwerk because he cannot crit or crush so druid is actually better in either main tank or hateful soak role.
---
k't since in bear form you are classes as a beast and thus immune to mind control.
---
you also have the advantage that all your BiS gear comes from pre AQ40, and in some cases level 43 BoE's:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=943 (or MCP's depending on threat).
---
meaning feral is quite viable for naxx progression as they basically start in full BiS compared to a prot warrior stuck in T2.
---
main tanking aside tho, i would argue that a feral is probably the top candidate as an off-tank simply due to how versatile they are.
---
can become extra healer/poison dispel/decurse bot on a whim.
---
provide 3% crit aura, and can do some pretty decent damage for an off-tank.
---
Hear hear!
---
I think your funny lol
---
Totemmasterrace
---
I dont have one right now...
---
And I want to remember my old guild name but for the life of me....I dont remember! If anyone from Uther, 15 years ago remembers Chiibii, let me know what guild we were in.
---
Or you could just replace the non viable ret Paladin with a viable fury warrior and kill him.
---
TBC was absolutely better class design. They didn't homogenize classes, and classes still had well-defined strengths and weaknesses. Also hybrids are actually all playable. In vanilla hybrids were mostly a complete joke and their existence in the game only served to mock people that were actually interested in playing that spec.
---
Also, most of the changes you mentioned didn't stop the class from still being weak in that area. It's not like warriors were chain pulling mobs because of victory rush, it was a very small heal and didn't really change anything. Water shield didn't give shaman great sustain, it simply made it so you can actually play enhance and ele at a non-joke level, etc.
---
Wasn't there a ranged tank needed on a boss in ZG
---
Having a meme spec dps isn't a big deal, tank on the other hand is, if people use consumes it might easy cost the guild 2-300 gold and half an hour.
---
If by tank with anything you mean like a tankless AoE mage grind comp or something, then sure. But I was actually saying shaman may be the most optimal tank at lower level, even above warriors and druids, because of how fast they can put threat on the target. Higher levels of course, multiple things catch up to them like mana regen scaling, more mechanics they don't have tools to deal with, more damage the mail isn't sufficient for, and better rage gen for the other tanks, etc.
---
Yeah I think controlling is going to be hard. I’m not used to the camera but learning the right way to do it sounds important.
---
Some would argue those are big things
---
Northern Jersey good enough? Lost all my friends who played
---
Everything is "viable".  I'm never going to be able to hear the word "viable" without cringing after this sub.
---
Hey, nice titts.
---
Yeah on the AV Beta test I was filling up my bars and thought "why would I need to keybind Shadowmeld" then saw another druid drink and go into stealth and immediately put Shadowmeld on my bars lol
---
You can perfectly fine play pve and PvP as priest with the same spec.  
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMushboZbxtIc0Vh  
---
First I had PI build but casters often get aggro with my buff and the +heal loss from holy talents is not worth it in my opinion
---
I like the idea, but you don't need to go past 300 to do it.
---
I plan on playin prot main tank for raids, and i would LOVE to have the second/third tank slots be filled with druids over warriors
---
That lack of gear competition is amazing, and avoiding too much gear competition is critical in reducing guild drama (good luck gearing a raid where 90% of the dps are rogue/mage/warrior).
---
For my guild I don't plan on forcing people to spec 100% optimal raid specs (as re-speccing is expensive, and a large amount of time is still going to be spent runnin around in the main world), and i'd rather have an extra feral druid in the 40 man than an extra prot warrior.
---
Thank you I’ll read that!
---
You're right. The problem is players. All they see is the meters. What would those fury warrior numbers look like if all of their windfury hits were attributed to the shaman? It'd be a very different game. The real problem in terms of class design is making many of these powerful support abilities baseline, and not spec-based. So why ever bring an elemental shaman when a resto can do it. Why bring a shadow priest when a disc/shadow can do it. That's where they made the mistake, and where they fixed it in TBC.
---
Is mage fun if he is a priest? I’m also thinking about warrior.
---
On private servers as soon as you cast arcane missiles on the mob, it comes running to you well before the 1st missile even fires/connects.
---
I think this change implies itll aggro once the 1st missile actually connects.
---
[ConsolePort](http://consoleport.net/home/) will be available for Classic and is 100x better than using some generic mapper like xpadder.
---
Wouldn't you agree that rogues get trashed by Warriors in pvp and dps though?
---

I started around age 8 because I wanted to play with my dad way back in tbc.  He had this big irl friend group who also played then.
---
 
---
I never really got to properly experience raiding for a long time since that was pretty much off limits for me. Regardless I had a good time back then so I can’t complain,but I am looking forward to do my WoW my own way this time. Sadly my dads too busy irl anymore to play games so it’s likely he won’t play classic much.
---
I was like 6 when original vanilla was out, so I never got to experience that and have always heard so much about it. Vanilla was always something I wanted to play so I am so excited for the classic release and to see the old world.
---
hahah its INSANE how much gold you can make off them, especially in the early onset of a fresh server before a twinking culture has been solidified. There are so many people going to be running low level dungeons that the AH will be flooded with these items for a criminally low pricepoint. All you have to do is grind enough gold to stash a few in the early days and you'll have enough gold for your lvl 60 mount

This pretty much goes out the window when pre-bis farming starts. It is a free for all with everyone trying to get ready to raid.

I can say from experience that winning against a max level in the arena happened more often than you would think. I had I think 8 or 9 AGMs across my level 19s. I think that was 15 STV arena wins per AGM. There was definitely a strategy to it.
---
I'd say the 3 main ranged DPS. Hunter, Mage, and Warlock. Mage is definitely strong no matter what spec you pick even though it would definitely be optimal to swap the spec around but deep frost is "good enough" for most things. Hunters DPS isn't exactly through the roof regardless of spec so most people probably won't notice if your spec is more PvP oriented as long as you are doing what you need to do. Warlock is imo the most rewarding once you get geared up and know what you are doing, so much fun and can get decent results with several specs.
---
I like sushi, doggies, cooking, girly things? Lol
---
We played a bunch of coop games, overcooked, super Mario on switch, cavestory, lovers in a dangerous spacetime, donkey Kong country, league of legends, secret of mana, and others I can’t think of.
---
Benedict's Key and Kolkar Booty Key? Those never went into the keyring
---
FD didn't resist very much in vanilla if my memory serves correct. But they changed it in tbc and it resisted all the time, sometimes 5 times in a row
---
Now the concern you mentioned isn't valid. But is very widely felt. I can tell you many others voiced the same opinion towards Jagex and runescape in the direction that old school runescape will be taken.
---
Jagex ruined runescape. Completely. I'd say worse than what blizzard did with retail wow. We did not trust them. So what did we do?
---
We told them that we want no updates unless it is community voted. That takes it out of their hands and into ours. WE choose what we want. That way we don't need to be scared of blizzard screwing up. 
---
Sure, we know what we get with TBC. But it comes with a lot of bad that we don't need.
---
I do not support TBC *without* flying being released. That is because there are a lot of issues that came with TBC besides just flying. TBC was different from vanilla/classic, a lot changed. We do not want to leave behind classic/vanilla lovers in favor of TBC. We need to stay together as a community, not split.
---
What I imagine is everyone gets the best out of each expansion while keeping it classic and vanilla. We know what works and what doesn't. So let's add what works, and keep out what doesn't.
---
And sure, there are some screw ups along the way. Osrs definitely had some bad updates. But that can all be fixed and learned from.
---
I suppose the game keys  have been used before
---
Tbh I’d probably have an easier time using xpadder, only because I’ve used it for over 5 years and old habits are hard to break. Although tbh I don’t really recommend anyone to use a controller period. It’s inefficient for a ton of things like accurate targeting and limited hotkeys. A keyboard and mouse is miles ahead, but like I said old habits are hard to break. I slowly adapted to 25+ hotkeys on a controller using modifiers n such , while my muscle memory can’t get past 10 keys on a keyboard and mouse. It’s weird
---
[removed]
---
Exact same scenario. I'd be way game for dad guild.
---
garrosh shoulda been leader with thrall as his senior advisor with serious weight or prime minister ish
---
So you are intentionally gimping your main to level alts? Got it. That is totally fine and your decision, but your advice overall is terrible for someone who wants to be a respected ret paladin.
---
Warlock is better in 1v1, has healthstone, fear and VW sacrifice, but mage has more tools to escape from fights and CC's, making it better in big group fights, for example bgs or organized pvp (premades). If you strictly want to dedicate to wpvp, I would recommend you to play warlock, it is more difficult to kill than a mage. However, both classes have very different playstyles. Mages are more similar to rogues, because you can start the fight at your own terms. If u are caught off guard, u can just poly and restart the fight or gain some time until your cds are ready to use. If u have fun playing rogue, I guess that you'll have more fun playing mage over warlock.
---
it was an old private server
---
Ayo, started last week of BC!
---
I feel sorry for the min maxers having to rush to 60 and only play what elitest reccomend, ill be accepting any class and or spec while i enjoy memory lane
---
I was automatically doing that out of habit because its the same in Retail. (normally with a shorter delay) Hooray for being used to latency!
---
Lvl 40 and 100 hks before sleeping is our goal.
---
&gt;differences in loot drop rates (e.g. greens in chests)).
---
are there no greens in chests in vanilla? or do you mean they're much rarer than on pservers? i didn't play back in the day and i'm curious
---
&gt; On the beta a lot of mob packs were flat out boring for healers where
---
When you outgear shit.
---
Also, running back from the GY is more boring.
---
You're a girl playing a MMORPG, when people find out your female you will get extreme special treatment. From being invited especially to raids, personally run through dungeons, gifted loot over other people that have been working towards it for months, given gold, had your mounts bought for you.
---
The list goes on. MMOs attract a certain type of male, the kind that functions so badly IRL that they become 100% absorbed by these worlds. they are not know for being players in real life. But here they can act alpha as fuck, a lot of guys pretend to be girls because of the enormous benefits it brings.
---
There are countless stories of girls being sucked into this over the years, and cheating IRL with guild members. It has been the downfall of many a guild and there are plenty of stories on line reporting all the graphic details.
---
So when I say, dont sleep with this guild members, it really isn't a joke.
---
As a prot paladin main, it's hard to argue that prot pally wasn't broken in vanilla. In TBC, the toolkit felt complete and useable. Vanilla tankadin felt like you were missing part of your class. I'm struggling to think of a strength to balance out the weakness.
---
Imagine that...
---
Nope.

Hahaha you’re wrong and can’t accept it. Reeeeeee

Watch these two videos then tell me that melee leeway is working as intended in PVE.

Sorry but if you're not to lvl 60 within 90 seconds of release you really shouldn't even bother playing.. retail plebs.
---
Imagine actually thinking that wow makes 60-70% of their revenue from micro transactions.
---
Blizzard just announced paid level boosts to 60, so that's perfect.
---
So that should also mean that you can regen 100% of mana while casting it, correct? That would make spirit very useful.
---
It's probably correct for average, but way above the median.

*takes off trolling hat*

Could u imagine how much money they'd actually make tho holy shit.

Game ded
---
I said 50%, the other 20% is expansion sales. Silly boy.

I was in college, failing a physics degree. I spent 100+ hours a week in game. I ended up quiting cold turkey before TBC came out to fix my relationships and squeak out a degree. 
---
Now, I have job/wife/house and four kids. But I really want to experience walking into Ironforge again. I think I have the self control to be super casual now.
---
I kinda doubt I'll be able to enjoy much end game with the limited time I'll have, but I'm hoping to experience a bit of the nostalgia when I can.
---
My guild is about 450 right now. 😀
---
Still wrong
---
It's been forever since vanilla, but I do not think it stacks with other hunters.  I think you only need 1 hunter to provide the aura for the raid... other hunters don't need to.  You can easily spec survival and do just as good damage if not better. because you get the aura from the other hunter, and the agility bonus from survival will out damage the ranged damage bonus from marks.
---
I raided plenty in vanilla as both specs and the dps is highly compatible for the hunter himself.  So unless multiple trueshot auras stack... there is no need for every hunter to have it.  Marksman is highly popular spec, highly possibly at least 1 on raid will have it.
---
They're a utility class that deals less damage than other pure dps and warlock stacking sucks, so there's little reason to have more than 4. You only absolutely need 1. Warlock number 4 can easily lose warlock number 3's progression slot for them in AQ+ progression as well as the shadow weaving slot if they deal shit dps. 
---
They're so terrible for pure dps that superb warlocks deal 1000 dps on a patchwerk fight. Think about that, you went from MC/ZG gear to Naxx BiS and shit and you didn't even double your dps....
---
In PvP they are great at 1v1, but are actually both less survivable and have a much worse cc than frost mages in groups. On horde side, ele shamans are more tough competition for them.
---
Ah, I see you have absolutely no idea what Thunderfury does.
---
Nope. Still a silly boy.
---
&gt; Also, most of the changes you mentioned didn't stop the class from still being weak in that area. It's not like warriors were chain pulling mobs because of victory rush, it was a very small heal and didn't really change anything. Water shield didn't give shaman great sustain, it simply made it so you can actually play enhance and ele at a non-joke level, etc.
---
That's true, but the person above you said:
---
&gt; These unneeded changes were the start of the arms race of classes getting everything they wanted every expo that culminated in modern versions of every class being 100% self sufficient.
---
And I think that's also completely true.
---
TBC did a lot of great things to make hybrid specs worth using, but also took the specs that were already worth using and gave them something specifically designed to mitigate their weakest points... which slippery-sloped itself into what Modern WoW is now.
---
I think the ideal that the devs should strive for is to lean into those weaknesses and make sure that other classes can use their utility to compensate for each individual class's weaknesses.
---
You make it sound like the move is uncertain. Bad breakup? Natural disaster? Hope you’re ok!
---
Druids can Main Tank most fights. There are even a few bosses where druids are better than warrior MTs.
---
I loved this.
---
Oh ya mage is incredible and so is warrior, both are very strong during classic. Which do you think you'd enjoy more?
---
I think it’ll be open Saturday. They want to stress the servers, after all
---
I don't think so. Combat and 5 second rule are two separate things.
---
Need to get ahead of the initial rush.  I hear lots of stories of people taking a week off for work, but hopefully that's a minority.  I'm hoping if I can get out of barrens fast enough, things will be a lot better.
---
B-B-B-BUT MUH #NoChAnGeS
---
Hey there, we have an old farts guild that's looking for more raiders if you're rolling alliance. We're mostly 30+ with kids. Message me if you're interested.
---
I've never tried that, but it's actually sounds delicious.
---
This sub is full of people who literally can't grasp that "everyone should play what they want" and "Serious raids won't take meme specs" are perfectly compatible ideas.
---
They are like "What you mean I can't have my cake and eat it too? That makes no sense. You are just saying that to be mean!"
---
Also when the VW is about to die you can sacrifice it for the shield then just spam searing pain for that insane threat generation. And if you have points in demo like you said, you have a lot more stamina than your average cloth wearer which helps a bit. Locks have a really good tool kit for tanking imo, they really just lack better armor, if they could wear mail they would probably be second only to warriors.
---
Am i dreaming or could you only do AB in the 20-29 up bracket? That may have been. Deciding factor with my 29 twink.
---
That’s when you /dance
---
Amazing how much trying hard can do!
---
Yeah shammys are awesome but their great benefit is to melee, not healers or ranged DPS.  If it was 8 shammys vs 6 shams+2 more DPS - I'd take the 2 more DPS.  6 Shams, 4-5 priests, 2-3 druids - great raid healing makeup.
---
Sounds fun!
---
Ohh no.! Only a few of us know each other. Just a friendly place to play the game. 😀
---
Was like 10 at launch and managed to do well with my tons of free time. In medical school now, have more time than most would suspect and still not a ton of reaponsibility. Gunna be fun
---
43% haste
---
You can easily do everything in shadow, with a small respec at 40. I wouldn't worry about it at all. There are a couple of priest videos on YouTube that calmed my fears for my 2nd char, even made me seriously question my decision of rolling hunter for a main.
---
Don’t stand in bad stuff, got it
---
&gt; If we as classic players band together and hold blizzard to high standards, drive them to only implement community voted and agreed upon content then classic will not only survive but thrive and grow exponentially with no end in sight.
---
Yeah but we (the community) were wrong just as often as blizzard. I fully admit to being on of the many of us the loved the introduction of flying mounts (when you've been grounded the whole game, it sounds hella cool right), and LFD, and so on. It took seeing those implemented to understand the effect they had on the game.
---
Now, if the community can vote OUT certain features, that's a pretty interesting idea. Try something, hate it, remove it. Done.
---
Don't forget you use WoW tokens to buy game-time as well. While they aren't available in Classic, since the sub covers Retail as well you can use gold on Retail to pay for your Classic sub. 
---
I reactivated my account recently (stopped playing in Cata) and found I had a ton of old stuff I could sell (some of it is now unavailable in the current game). In total I had about 6 months sub worth of stuff on my account just sitting there. I'm still in the process of selling it all off (takes a while because I'm on a low-pop server) but it'll move eventually.
---
And realistically, you can probably find someone with WoW tokens on Retail who'd be willing to trade them for gold in Classic too.
---
I'm the opposite, mouse hand in constant agony.  
---
It's a high price we pay to play our favorite game
---
I don’t really know yet! I based this on some YouTube videos but I’ve never played so I don’t know what they are really like.
---
I'm full of shit for saying that a paladin that is known for only using DPS items, in a guild that is known for having their warriors swing Nightfall, wasn't using Nightfall? That's not how burden of proof works bub.
---
The above + the fact that he maxizized his own DPS and didn't in any way change his rotation/spells used to increase the Nightfall uptime should make it obvious enough that he wasn't swinging Nightfall, and that's for the logs where he wasn't using Corrupted Ashbringer and where the "Drain Life" proc didn't show up in his damage.
---
I could probably find the vods of the run from someone in &lt;SALAD BAKERS&gt; and then find specific timestamps that show what weapon Esfand was using, but I can't be assed to find someone that recorded that specific naxx run. I'm not going to spent 20+ minutes of my life for an internet argument. Use logic.
---
P.S. You can find the logs pictured in the OP in less than 30s if you aren't braindead, and I'd like to think that you aren't.
---
No I did
---
again, you are cherry picking, overall, there is far more customisation in vanilla than tbc.
---
the stagnation you mentioned as being in vanilla is still present in tbc it just extends to more classes who didn't have it before.
---
as a resto shaman in tbc you are never going to ignore earth shield, therefore you are left with the same amount of filler talents to "waste" and thus don't matter at all either.
---
as a rogue/mage? you go from having like 10+ different talent combinations to less than 3.
---
and you sacrifice all the customizability/excitement that there is in favour of "balance".
---
at the end of the day the only real balance that matters in vanilla is PvP, none of the PvE content is hard enough that even the most wheelchair PvE classes cannot complete with a little effort.
---
&gt;I'm full of shit for saying that a paladin that is known for only using DPS items, in a guild that is known for having their warriors swing Nightfall, wasn't using Nightfall? That's not how burden of proof works bub.
---
You don't know how burden of proof works lol. You made the claim, you provide the evidence.
---
Basically any not meta spec. Examples for raiding (some might be options in pvp, idk, I don't really do that) oomkin, arcane mages, ret pally, and ele shaman.
---
The everquest unspoken rule
---
Gonna end up being called "Worlds of Warcraft"
---
So... "any spec that isn't viable"?
---
here is a thread from not too long ago

---
If the copies are opened and used, sure.  If sealed then I believe they're always unique so they should still technically work.  In the end I'm just guessing.
---
I knew I liked y’all. For the horde! If you want to really impress him look up what’s called “POMpyro” in short it’s something you can do as a mage where you use certain abilities at once and it kills almost any enemy player instantly. Sure it’s not actually very good for playing seriously but boy is it funny.
---
Sorry. I don’t get to keep up with this stuff and finding mixed results on google. What’s the deal with cone of cold
---
I’m going to go tailoring and enchanting then drop enchanting for either Herb or skinning after I make the first two wands
---
Thank you for this, was playing a vanilla server and its so fkn weird having a &amp; d turn your camera and not move you.
---
Make no mistake with druids, getting your tier gear is easy, but you will have an extraordinarily hard time getting rings/trinket/neck or other off pieces. The other healers will be all over that shit, esp paladins since their early tier sets are a joke for healing. You will be sitting there with 5/8 and have to wait for months for your prio on anything not named Cenarion. Same thing in BWL.
---
If you’re flagging yourself for pvp in westfall you deserved to be killed. Glad horde players have people that think before they post.
---
Heh, there is some benefit but on PServers I never found a shammy in my group that necessary (as a priest).  
---
We can agree to discuss until we see how classic raids really go ;D
---
There were no raid wide buffs in Vanilla.
---
19 is shit tier for people trying to roleplay as goblins irl
---
29 isn't bad
---
39 isn't bad but doesn't seem as balanced
---
49 is epic tier twinks with almost fully developed classes.
---
&gt; ill be accepting any class and or spec while i enjoy memory lane
---
I really liked this explanation of how meme specs worked in Vanilla:
---
&gt; “...it's funny when people keep saying that you can join a casual guild that will bring players with unviable specs. Yes, you technically can, and you might even get carried through most/all of MC and Onyxia. But once you get stuck on a boss like Vael for a few weeks the "try-hard" clique of the guild will start pointing out the DPS below the tanks. Which inevitably leads to losing those tryhards or to losing those players with unviable specs (either respecing or not inviting them). Casual guilds will already have a harder time clearing content, why would they purposely make it even harder by bringing dead weight specs?”
---
Oh interesting, hadn't even thought of picking up Omen on a Resto build. Nice catch!
---
Aka, they're fucked.
---
Melee leeway alone fucks them pretty hard, i don't know how they can say it existed in its current form in vanilla, there's multiple mage pvp videos that shows exactly how far melee were hitting them from in motion.
---
Why not set a once a month LAN party with the old man I bet he’d love to have an excuse to do nothing and say it’s father son bonding time.
---
&gt;Yah, that's kind of a fucked up comment.

&gt;How about DM farming that to completely avoid any player or environmental sources of danger in the world?
---
very, very few people did this -- to the point where it was irrelevant.
---
&gt; How about world buff stacking to completely avoid any player or environmental sources of danger in the world?
---
see above. even Death and Taxes are on record *not* doing this (episode 94 Countdown to Classic).
---
&gt; This WPVP fantasy is just that... A fantasy. It's never been largely prevalent and never will be.
---
................. ok
---
&gt;idk what that means. Never even played FF.
---
FF13 is 1 straight line from beginning to end. like BC dungeons.
---
&gt;Badges is a great system to helps people catch up. Vanilla WoW did this as well with Dire Maul and the 20 man raids.
---
in dire maul you still got pieces of loot instead of saving up to buy it from some goofy vendor safe inside the capital city.
---
In my groups I have trust. I know my deeps will hit the targets in order of marking while I rotate all targets. The problem for a lot of tanks at 60, besides dealing with the time crunch of raiding, is the fatigue of dealing with new people, especially when you get people who think they are speedrunning the dungeon or, God forbid, I only have X minutes until work, can we speed this up? Now if it is for a timed Baron run, or later on, troll bear mounts, cool, lets crush this fucker.
---
If I see you in Trade and I have ran with you and know you are legit and I have time you will get a /w from me, even if I need nothing from the run, because I like to tank. But if I don't know you, I will just watch your lfg, need tank scroll on by while I do something else.
---
**TL;DR** don't be a jackass and you won't have problems forming groups.
---
Nothing worse than a 60 who never played his class
---
I think there's room for better balance while keeping with this same philosophy. Perhaps there could be a more optimal way to maximize DPS for the underperforming specs while sacrificing utility in a more impactful way.
---
I have a career and a kid.  I'll be lucky if I can raid once a month if at all.
---
Replace with redridge silly
---
Incredibly clever meme
---
Hey, it’s one way of doing it
---
I disagree that warriors being able to top dps is a good thing, no hybrid class should dominate the meters.
---
I want bc,  I want the option to *copy* your character to a bc realm (and fresh realms you cant copy characters to) for the bc launch.    I want  bc to launch 8 months after naxx. 
---
After 6 months of naxx I want some features from the prepatch but not all of them.
---
I want arena (unranked for fun)   and I want the new honor system to drop. (This is 6 months after naxx so r14 weapons arent so amazing anymore).
---
This would let people who want to keep playing old classic servers grind up the pvp set and play arenas for fun.   
---
I also want fresh realms that restart the cycle all over again.  But I dont want them to launch until 6 months after naxx aswell. 
---
I want phase 1 and 2 to last 3 months. Then the remaining phases to last 4 months.
---
I dont want any new content after naxx but I do feel like the 2.0 honor system really would open up alot of options for people.
---
I have a general question. I read a lot about druids being unable to push crushing blows off the table due to unavailability of worthwhile leather with defense. However, I also read that many warriors will tank in dps gear just to keep up with the threat required of the raid. Doesn't that mean that warriors (wearing said gear) will have similar crushing blow problems? If both are facing crushing blows, is the druid's probable higher armor enough to offset, or does the potential block/Parry ability of the warrior do more?
---
I understand druids are lacking in a second taunt and defensive CDs, but otherwise it appears to me that they have to be pretty similar otherwise.
---
I haven't raided vanilla and I don't have any tanking experience with either class. It just sounds highly hypocritical to criticize the druid for something that warriors will do intentionally. Can anyone shed some light here? Is my understanding comparing apples to oranges? I also don't have a specific phase/fight/gear level in mind, so I imagine it can change based on what's available.
---
But this simply isn't true. What you really mean is: Every spec is able to be *carried.* Which is different.
---
Like a comment down below pointed out:
---
&gt; If you're downing Nef and waiting for AQ to open, sure an enhancement shaman is going to be viable, but you could probably kill Nef with 39 players too.
---
So I personally would never define *viable* as being the same as *might as well not even be there for the raid to progress.* That's a ridiculous way of defining viable.
---
&gt;Rogues are not broken out of stealth by Blizzard until they take damage.
---
Considering that Blizzard now takes like 2 seconds to start doing damage, it looks like they've made the spell worthless in PvP. 
---
Do they really think nobody remembers playing a Mage in actual vanilla and how spells worked?
---
Grind my main shaman to 60 ganking as many alliance players as possible along the way.  Then probably just bitching endlessly in tradechat about being expected to respec.
---
I'd like to see Burning Crusades classic because that was my favourite time in wow. But I'd only want to see it if Vanilla classic has a healthy enough player base to survive the fracturing that this would cause. It doesn't help anyone to release Burning Crusades classic if the player base in vanilla classic is already small and struggling to get by.
---
Assuming vanilla's population is strong enough to survive the split though, I would definitely make the move over to classic. The way I would like to see it happen is to provide players with the option to freely transfer a character from a classic server onto a burning crusades server if and when they feel ready.
---
Ideally they would allow players to make faction/race swaps on transfer for free as well. I'm sure a number of players out there are making different choices right now for vanilla classic than they would make if burning crusades classic was releasing the same day.
---
Yeah you can probably watch some video guides about "mouse turning" and "keybinding"
---
Better you learn it now rather than have to switch to the right way later on like I had to
---
&gt;  sometimes all it takes is one wipe for them to suddenly turn on you and stop inviting you.
---
not in my experience. For regular groups the only time things fall apart, again in my own epxerience, is loot drama. Wipes happen, just not often.
---
And I like the "work" part of it. Especially when a mob peels off to a healer and that blue bar bae comes running to me so I can pick the mob up. That stuff is the tits
---
Luckily, we always bring plenty of extra O'gar along with us.
---
They can, but it really depends on the guild, most people I know so far aren’t planning on letting Druid do anything but OT. Still, your mileage will vary.
---
As someone who has played a rogue in Vanilla...something comes over you, can't quite explain it, but if I see an enemy out questing, farming or just tooling around and I think I can get it done...it is time for murderhobo rogue fun
---
My desire to optimise my computer for playing WoW piqued my interest in PC hardware and software configuration and became the catalyst for my ability to pursue a lucrative career in IT.
---
I was in Huge pvpness if that rings a bell, rofl.
---
As a Warrior I often forget to see "glancing hit"
---
Again false. Tauren deadzone is bigger than 11 yards. Blizz also confirmed that it is in the beta as it was back in original vanilla.
---
The deadzone is simply bigger as advertised by the tooltip by roughly 3 yards for all races. pretty unfortunate.
---
It’s not getting fixed as it is like it was back then
---
That's a lot of haste
---
Beartanks never get enough credit
---
&gt; Warriors are easy for new players?
---
Back then this was actually true. Spellcasters are inherently more complicated than melee due to the fact that they generally have more spells. For example let's imagine you're playing wow back then and have absolutely no skill with mmos and I give you a Mage. Should you fireball vs. frostbolt vs. arcane missiles? Should you fire blast whenever you can? When do I use flamestrike vs. blizzard? Should I frost nova mobs when they get near me, or save my mana and let the mob hit me? All the talent trees look cool for leveling, which do I pick?
---
Meanwhile with warriors, you have high armor and health which generally makes you take much less damage. One of your talent trees is for tanking so it's much more clear what talent tree to go into. Warrior talents are also more simplistic (5% more crit with axes vs. your shadow bolt crits have a chance to apply a debuff to the target ... yada yada). With a mage, any moment you're not casting spells or wanding you're missing damage. With a warrior you just auto attack and chill until you have enough rage. 
---
Anyways I could continue but essentially the concept of warriors being tough to play didn't come around until people started understanding the game more. Then it was clear that to perform well, warriors had to try a lot harder than other classes.
---
There are 9 slots for transmute alts
---
&gt; very, very few people did this (or could do this)-- to the point where it was irrelevant.
---
&gt; 
---
In Vanilla... But on the pirated servers, everyone does it.   Hell, people make alts just to farm it if their main isn't good at it.
---
&gt; see above. even Death and Taxes are on record not doing this (episode 94 Countdown to Classic).
---
Again, it wasn't done much in Vanilla.
---
I'll be playing 12 hours a day at least...working from home and shirking my responsibilities.
---
You’re correct. 19 was wsg only.
---
My thoughts on this is why hasn't blizzard confirmed it a bug? 
---
Instead what they did was confirm that this is how the old client behaves. Oh. It's how it was on the 1.12 client. Hmmm
---
No Problem!
---
Mages have a much higher skill cap. An average mage will get wrecked by most average players, an amazing mage will beat amazing players of other classes. Mage has high APM, spacial and deadzone awareness. Mistakes are deadly for you.
---
With Warlock the skill cap is lower since you are a bit of a tanking caster, with lack of mobility you are more reactive to what is going on. You are like a caster warrior .... dot up, do some casts, try to fear, some pet management, drain life. You are relying on attacker mistakes and windows of opportunity.
---
No problem I will make an update video when classic actually comes out
---
What's the point of hks if no honorsystem?
---
The Zerg got something special later tho. When Grunty came into the game after Blizzcon 2009 those two would kill each other.
---
I will miss my marine murloc.
---
For names, you can get some inspiration from fantasy characters (LotR, etc) or make a funny cute name stemming from the spells/abilities. For example, mages make portals which transfer themselves and party members to a city, so something like “Travelocity” or “Expedia” can be fun. Or if you’re certain you want to play as a frost mage, you can choose something like “Frostbite”.
---
29 was my favorite bracket back in vanilla, but playing private servers I've grown to love 39 more.
---
Now if Ele shamans worked in 29 I would just do that, but since I plan on Manning one, I'm most likely going to make either a 39 druid or warlock. I still dong know, tbh.
---
Always love level 19 because that's where I started. 
---
But also, you have the least amount of abilities, so it takes more skill to get what you need to done. However, hunters and rogues somewhat dominate this bracket and it can get annoying. 
---
Nonetheless, I'm planning on making a 19 Warlock and 19 Mage Twink. 
---
Also plan on making a 29 Balance druid and 39 Twink (not sure of class but maybe shaman or pally).
---
Can some captain help me? I kinda stumbled into this sub and I am not up to date with a lot of games. Does this mean that the OG version of WoW is getting relaunched or something?
---

Rank 1 for dispell spam. Especially if you have Ice Barrier, you need the debuff shields vs. priests/locks/shams

I've always wondered if [this part](https://youtu.be/VhB-J28AYro?t=659) was just happenstance or was the triforce thing actually a reference. It seems like a stretch
---
Couldn’t agree more...
---
Not sure why I laughed at this
---
I remember trying a warrior alt and dieing over and over between 12 and 16 and giving up to go back to my pally main.
---
Warriors can beat most classes if they're good. It isn't as bad as it sounds.
---
If only beast master / survival hunters, had enough utility to compensate for thier lower dps
---
"Summer 2019" :D :D
---
Mages are better for group PVP. Warlocks are better for 1v1s. Warlocks should beat mages in 1v1s afaik.
---
From a hunter's perspective, mages are a pain from level ~30-40 to 60 and keep being annoying. Warlocks tend to be really easy prey (no mobility, no long-range CC) until 60, at which point they become the one class I won't fight because of how bullshit they are. Dots, all the tankiness in the world, and being able to 100-0 you in fearspam if you get too close.
---
TL;DR
---
Mages are better while leveling. Warlocks are better for 1v1s at 60. Mages are more useful in any sort of group PVP though, and IMO they'd be much more fun that locks.
---
Haha well to be fair Paladins were known back then to be so laid back easy that [a selling point was you could watch pornography while leveling](https://i.imgur.com/oUtUv.jpg)
---
Well in a vanilla class design interview they did quite literally say paladins at their core were designed to be easy to play.
---
I'm going to need proof he wasn't the only one using nightfall before I show you my calculations again.
---
Your composition seems like it would be able kill things a lot faster which might be worth it.
---
As for Hellfire, Holy Nova should be good enough to keep the Warlock almost fully healed as long as the Priest has mana. Also, I though Hurricane became available at lvl 40.
---
You can at least make an excuse that SL warlock *can* make tanking twin emps easier on healers, but that's a fringe case and you don't need to be SL to do that in the first place.
---
I had both of those in beta and got no keyring. Its missing in the classic client flat out.
---
Read the question again:
---
&gt; Will warriors in wow classic be bfore or after indalamar's video
---
And your answer:
---
&gt; Before.
---
Therefore you said WoW Classic will have pre-launch content from the beta in 2002.
---
no fap until 60
---
Thats only PvP. You get put in combat for PvE, the mob runs right at you as soon as you are hit. But on beta the mobs DONT immediately run to you as soon as you cast it like on PServers. They have to be hit by it before they aggro you and put you in combat. The combat flagging is broken in PvP though.
---
What makes you think only newbies are going to ebay accounts? Some Pserver players have been rerolling for 15 years - maybe they've just decided to hire China this time.
---
Holy crap, you got roasted pretty hard here. Have some cold water to apply on that burnt area that is on your whole body
---
[This is OP!](https://youtu.be/TR7FC-h0Fb8)
---
**Warts and All** was cheered when they said it. But Im wondering how much blowback they will get for it now. I've been of the opinion that as soon as "No changes" included bugs from the patch, that people would be livid...
---
The Blizzard, and Arcane Missiles combat behaviour (and maybe a few hunter things) are clear examples of bugs in patch 1.12... And I see exactly no one so far that is happy about them being in classic. #NoChanges backfire? Is what we really wanted 1.12 with all the obviously bugged shit fixed? If so we really should have campaigned differently.
---
That's very true. In reality, I'm not interested in playing a Priest or Warlock anyway but their stamina buffs, summons, and soulstones are just so useful. I'll have to do some theorycrafting and compare the numbers to see which I like better.
---
Do you think that a Paladin tank could hold single target aggro well enough?
---
Did you play on beta? Because every single mage that isn’t retarded aoe farmed just fine. And if you didn’t get an invite them just watch a vod from Venruki or Ziqo. Dramatic ass post lmao “DESTROYEDDD.”
---
The strongest item at release of OSRS was the whip which could hit 40s. With GWD it became AGS which could at the time hit 76 iirc, and now it’s just fucking ludicrous with tbow/scythe.
---
The game has seen enormous power creep, which is OK, but it’s far behind relatively.
---
What class would Sam and Dean be? Pally / Priest cause they fight demons? Or Hunters?
---
&gt; Therefore you said WoW Classic will have pre-launch content from the beta in 2002.
---
Correct, it will.
---
Be aware: There is no 'semi hardcore' in WoW. You are either hardcore or you are casual.
---
You're right, hurricane is 40/50/60 it looks like. At any rate it still sucks and you won't have it for a fair while.  
---
Hellfire requires you to worry about positioning, puts you in a position where you get bashed/cleaved and gives you another thing to heal. If you want to run warlock (which helps a crap load with summoning so it is a good idea), you really just want to spam Rain of Fire. Holy nova is really just a poor spell not worth micromanaging in a situation where you're controlling 5 people. I'd be much more concerned about your tank keeping aggro and alive.  
---
    
---
Also a very big pain with this strat is constantly trying to kill runners. Trust me having stuff running every pull and racing to slow/kill them before they pull another pack while you're on low mana gets very old. The blizzard kiting method would be far better for that.
---
Same dude. Im in the "I just wanna play Classic WoW because retail sucks" camp.
---
Which classes dominated in the 49 bracket? Is it the usual Rogue/hunter? Or were warlocks shadow priests etc viable?
---
if the druid has ret aura and thorns he will probably hold aggro through tics of blizzard if hes swiping and demo shouting, the more mobs you have the more it spreads out healing aggro so healers are less likely to pull aggro the more mobs you pull.
---
Most dps classes can do well in BGs if they are in a raid progression guild no matter what spec they are because they end up out-gearing their opponents much of the time.
---
Part of the reason I’ve never played WoW seriously or up to end game was I always felt so behind everyone else and that there was such a massive grind before I could even get to the end game where everyone else is. I’m looking forward to Classic so much because this is the first time we all have to go through that and I’ll be with the pack instead of behind it.
---
Eeeh, depends entirely on your guild. My old guild would have had a blast and just laughed their assets off.
---
It is a game, and sure it might cause some delays, but it is all fun.
---
I've seen some rets bring utility at least. Like popping their LoH on a tank during a crazy boss fight, popping divine shield to drop agro, or even healing or dispelling themselves so a healer won't have to. 
---
Yes the dps is low, but these complaints are so crazy for 1 player out of 40 that this seems like overkill. 
---
Let people play what they want. If they get invited; so be it. Not your guild, not your problem.
---
Fast premades  queues for alliance with holy pallies  is so nice :)
---
I think it’s a 50/50 between TBC and a divergent new timeline of Classic original content. The one thing I can guarantee they won’t do is let the servers stagnate.
---
I never rolled meme spec but with my experience on private servers, we bring along people in gray armor (I shit you not) because they are another body. Having them there is better than leaving the spot blank.
---
A laid back guild wouldn't spend 200-300g in consumables on each pull though. That was a shitton of money in vanilla.
---
No, it won't. Indalamar's video is a completely different Warrior class than the one launched in 2004. You literally never played the class he's playing.
---
I played ele sham at 49 and when fully geared it was legit insane
---
I don't buy it, i had sub 15 ping back then and didn't notice anything.
---
And since they said they wanted it to feel like it did back then, blindly making everything the same, ignoring the tech advances, is stupidity.
---
&gt;Some of the spec choices made during TBC were bad for the game because they reduced players' reliance on other players.
---
That is where we disagree, I don't think they got to that level until wrath and beyond. The level of reliance on other players was still high in TBC. You weren't able to do anything terribly noteworthy by yourself. 
---
Some other things were changed, such as a lot of elite areas being changed to normal areas, amount of xp required to get to 60 reduced, and partial obsolescence of the old world (the last 2 meaning you're less likely to want to do the hard quests, since there's not as much reason to), all of which probably contribute a lot more to that feeling than specs being a little stronger.
---
My very first char was a cow warrior. I probably played and specced terribly. I quit at 32 or 36 and began to main an ele shaman that never got to 60 until tbc came out ( I started playing about 6 months or more before tbc so I didnt have alot of time to get there especially  as a noob that explored and tried alot of crap... still play ele sham today and recently on a tbc server. I love elemental lol.
---
That being said I'm being tempted to play warrior. The perks seem to out way the struggles to me and I know playing elemental is going to be a rough road, but I plan to play both. I think I can be dedicated enough to get a spot as lolmemespec ele. I think my passion for the class and my urge to play the only content I missed will  get me a spot in a guild that clears stuff. I'm sure we will be far from top guilds but we will be a guild that kills bosses. 
---
Sorry for ranting under your comment.
---
Me.
---
Theorycrafters has shown that a holy priest specced to shadowweave is more effective in raids than full shadow just so you know. But tons of guilds don't care about spec so you'll find a raiding guild anyway as long as you don't want to min/max
---
Turns your room into a microwave so your tin foil hat melts to your dense skull.
---
warrior is the best tank and the best DPS. i will not accept that as good game design. either make classes have clearly defined roles or dont but nerfing the rest because of the hybrid/utlitly tax is just awful design.
---
I remember PuGs like the back in the day. Guilds that only had enough to do ZG and AQ20 hosted them and wiped on MC before getting to Baron. I got into a guild that way by agreeing to switch to Holy, and immediately got into their ZG and AQ20 runs.
---
TIL I got ganked there 14 years ago only because I was dumb enough to flag for PvP
---
Death by a thousand cuts. If they make an exception with Guild banks, people are going to want instant mail to guild members, and so on. Before you know it, you have LFG tool and Heirlooms because they "aren't a big deal" to a handful of people.
---
Also, in 1.12, the snowballs wouldn't knock you off the bridge.
---
Couldn't the guild foot the bill for respeccing for twin emps then???
---
Are you saying the private server video footage is faked?
---
Personally, I don't remember details well enough from 15 years ago to speak to that level of detail.  It's lost to the haze of memory.
---
That's why I'm curious about a modern test with artificially high ping to replicate conditions of vanilla.
---
And I agree on your last point, but you and I are in the minority on that opinion (or at least were in the minority a year ago when it mattered).
---
nobody in the history of wow picked a lock over a mage because of a soulstone.  mages get picked almost every pug because of poly
---
I dunno, I saw a screenshot of a major ret paladin player on youtube and he was at the bottom of the meters *by far*.
---
&gt; Making Cone of Cold/Arcane Explosion kiting essentially impossible due to this mechanic. When it was a common practice in actual vanilla... Good job Blizz...
---
No, it wasn't. Cone of cold was your last ditch to clean up stragglers that walked out of your blizzard, and you usually got chunked half of your HP for your troubles.
---
OPs comparison is not invalid ffs. What the fuck is wrong with people.

---
The difference is super small. In the classic video the foot touches the stones. In the private server video it's \~ 1 footstep away. I'd even argue that it's hard to say if there is even a difference or if OP couldn't have managed to walk 1/10 yard further back to make it match exactly.
---
Of course it will happen. Shaman tanks will happen too.
---
It might even be smart once you are more than a full tier overgeared.
---
The sort of players, in the sort of situations it would be the right choice for, won't need to ask if it's a good idea on reddit.
---
Faction decision shouldn't be based on something like this.
---
Tell that to all the people that call you an elitist if you say that druids/pallies should be healing in a raid.
---
That one wyvern chilling on the top of that tower looks epic.
---
Log in in my character and do whatever I feel like. Repeat.
---
Except in EverQuest anyone can tank group content :p
---
they still fucked up pally balance with seal of blood. blizz cant balance well even when they try to
---
That's because the beta is now dead.

I haven't kept track of the good ones, so I forget the which one was on my mind when making that comment. I did a simple search on YT though and found this one:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t-OsvFBiXE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t-OsvFBiXE)   
---
It's long, but someone in the comments linked timestamps for all the classes. I don't remember the video perfectly (I have watched it,) but MadSeason is a great Classic Youtuber.
---
&gt;Fortunately, this game isn't just about DPS
---
Yes it is. 80% DPS, 15% healing, and 5% tanking.

Here is what to think about when keybinding.
---
1. How often am I spamming this ability? (example: Frostbolt- you want this to be an easy to hit keybind because you will be using it a LOT)
---
2. How quickly do I need to use this ability? (example: pvp trinket/iceblock/blink: these are abilities that reaction time matters a LOT and should likely be simple keybinds and not shift/alt/cntrl modifiers)
---
3. What keys on my keyboard/mouse are the easiest for me to use? (example: I don't have huge range so I don't do numbers past 5 or letters right of T&amp;G)
---
4. Do i need to move while I use this ability? (example: I keybind my mounts to alt+W as you can't move while casting mount. Also, with abilities that you must remain stationary on you can usually make them a little harder to hit, as you won't be preoccupied with moving)
---
Using this list you can map out your keybinds, making ones with higher priority on questions 1-3 the most important/often used abilites. In my opinion KEYBIND EVERYTHING!
---
Some tips: I moved my movement keys to S E F instead of A W D. So my mount keybind is actually Alt+E. This gives you an extra row (mainly the A key) on the left side of your hand. Also, my left hand is now always on the correct keys to start typing in chats.
---
Start small, if you really wan't to get good at keybinding add a new keybind (that you used to click) every day or so.
---
THE BEST WAY TO GET USED TO YOUR KEYBINDS IS TO PLAY THE GAME WITH THEM!: make your new keybinds and go quest for an hour. after a few hours or over the course of a few days the mind-muscle connection will form and the new keybind will just become a non-thought action.
---
Should i make this into it's own thread? do you guys think this is a decent keybinding overview?
---
How does this compare to having a DPS warrior swing Nightfall while a Holy paladin keeps a seal up?
---
I've been playing on a ps. It is right and just to let your dps die because those fucks can't even wait 2 seconds to let you establish threat in 5 mans. Players are still morons, they're just different kinds of morons. Like they can all Heigan dance now but the concept of threat or pulling is foreign to them.
---
Hell yeah brothers, except for the D. because of this, I'm out
---
\*laughs in frost mage*
---
It's good balance for those who are lucky to like a class that is god tier in everything they do, either PvE or PvP, yes. #warriorAll3Specs#mage#rogue#warlock
---
For the rest, not so much.
---
And also braindead elite pservers players that only think about speedrunning and keep influencing other innocent people doesn't help to just take the situation as it is.
---
And I'll quote what I just said again:
---
&gt; Every spec is able to be carried, depending on the rest of the group's composition—but include too many meme-specs and the ability for a raid to progress goes down significantly on certain bosses, like Vael.
---
So even this whole meme is still dependant on how many spots are actually available to be pure mathematical carries.
---
Hmm, I know we were using 3 warlocks by the time Naxx rolled around and that was before the 2.0 patch.  And 3 destro 'locks would eat half that by themselves.  I think it was more than that by then, and that 16 was early in MC because random debuffs like rogue poison or warrior bleed would do things like push Sunder Armor off the mob.  
---
I could be wrong and you could be right, though.
---
60, because I can play with my whole toolkit.
---
Without ice block, ice barrier and cold snap your surviability is very limited. I dont think you can run Bgs with 31 points in arcane and dont feel gimped.
---
I mean the sad thing is people like us are the ones trying to help.  If you dream of being a ret pally in raids that's great and maybe you'll find one that takes you.  But it's going to be pretty sad getting to 60 then realizing the spec you want to play doesn't work for most raids.
---
Data is from like 6 months ago, you can check the logs from the guy above you, every raid hes last on DPS even with his guild funneling gear to him, its not handpicked.
---
Ret dps sucks, just get over it.
---
Legacyplayers (the website these logs are uploaded to) broke. 
---
Nharz was a warrior on the server these logs were recorded but was a hunter on a more recent server of the same “server group/administration”. Now it’s showing him as a hunter in logs from the old server too. 
---
It’s pretty easy to figure out what class the outliers like these are by hovering over their name in the log and checking what their damaging abilities were (hint: a hunter isn’t using Bloodthirst).
---
Part of the appeal of classic WoW is that it will get stale. You can quit it won't be this endless treadmill, and you can come back and maybe get to a higher raid point. Naxx was so ridiculous of a challenge that most casual players will never get their regardless.
---
Well said. Outland it just way too spacey.
---
that was on a private server.
---
In what world does a 40 man raid not have a single paladin healing?
---
You’re not taking into account RNG though. I do agree 4 months is a little much. But 2 weeks is also a little liberal as well. Sometimes shit just doesn’t drop and oversaturated classes are heavily competing for specific items.
---
Yeah, but I would like classic WoW to remain, level up again for TBC one, I don't want classic WoW to upgrade to TBC, keep the level cap at 60 permanently.
---
Earth shock for the win
---
&gt; I don't know what you are talking about. I thought it gave redux and +healing after being crit in TBC, but honestly it has been so long I don't remember exactly what focused will did.
---
You are probably remembering Blessed Recovery and Blessed Resilience. It was just 25% of the damage done by a crit healed over time, plus a 60% chance of 6 seconds of crit immunity.
---
&gt; I got glad in all 3 brackets season 1 as paladin
---
Paladin was OP in season 1, I think everyone agreed on that.
---
&gt; Discs priests went from being one of the best targets to kill in vanilla to basically the worst in TBC.
---
Paladins were worse because they could bubble, and druids who humped a pillar were extremely hard to kill and could heal on the run. Priests were the third most desirable PvP healer the way I remember it, at least in early TBC.
---
But the bottom line is still that TBC balance for all its sins was far, far better than vanilla balance.
---
You talk as if those are not intertwined.
---
It’s more of a “gimp your performance for the entire raid to be slightly better on 1 fight” thing. You don’t *need* to be SL to tank twin emps, but the lower damage taken can be helpful for your healers (if they don’t mind havingg to also heal your pet).
---
Judging by what I’m reading on reddit they somehow did recreate the ignorance of the playerbase 😂😂😂.
---
Negative all i remember was good times and lots of laughs
---
You might not get it, but it's not just an argument, it's a fact. Check statistics, most played races are humans and night elves. Horde side it's undead which are the more humanoid looking of them all, until blood elves come in then it's every 1 in 3 horde is a blood elf.
---
Id like to see TBC and WotLK as I think most people will lose interest in classic over time if not given new content.
---
Im pretty sure all the servers will be transformed into tbc then wotlk servers as I dont think the devs will be bothered to give us the option to stay on vanilla, and also that could also cause population problems.
---
I have :) And only a tryhard guild that goes for world first would do that. Like less than 1% of your.. "serious guilds"..
---
Get over what? Don't project beliefs on me that I never said.
---
I just fucking HATE statistics with no context and obvious inconsistencies. You can't deny that this looks like an attempt at manipulation.
---
Maybe add more 5-Mans maybe make lvl 60 versions of earlier 5-mans. Maybe add a legendary item or two, another armor set, more crafting recipes, extra quests. But do not up the level cap!
---
You seriously can't have fun while losing? I don't envy you.
---
I've been in the same meme guild and will be. We were 9/14 in naxx on Pservers but were pretty much not serious and joking about every raid.
---
All Horde raids :P
---
Thanks you! 
---
Those space goats completely ruin the game for me. 
---
People say it's weird but honestly those sPacE gOaTsLmAo are so god damn out of place than it completely ruins the RPG vibe of the game every time i see one. Couldn't even make it to 70 before i quit.
---
Actually it is not vertical progression at all, you are simply enhancing things you can already craft, therefore they are all replaced by Raid tier loot, you can't add these stats to any other gear, simply the things you yourself craft.
---
And I feel that this would be an alternative to the portion of the community that really has no desire to raid, the quest to unlock this could be a challenge and the gear that comes as a reward would never compete against the mid to top tier raid sets.
---
Think of this system as more of the Tier 0.5 sets its just crafting 0.5.
---
Its a good idea to introduce some extra gear to help make some of the weaker play specs more viable. You could do that by adding a couple of 5-mans and spinkling a few new items here and there.
---
Why the hell is everyone here seems to think that every single "meme spec" player or classic player in general is interested in raiding?  
---
There's going to be tons of people who won't step into most or any raids just because they're not interested in that. Some will, and they should min-max to some extent, sure. but let's not act like whole playerbase will be doing the same.
---
Last stress test is still coming, it will include EU and US.
---
Has anyone heard if that dispel addon is being brought back? The one where we just spam click a keybind and it auto selects targets needing to be dispelled? Cause I can’t survive without that shit in raids.
---
The fucking obsession some of you have with putting down these specs...
---
Everybody knows these specs are shit! Even Esfand is perfectly aware of it. He always says to people: "don't roll a Ret paladin"!
---
Just let people play what they want, and you just don't play with people you don't want to play with. Fucking simple as that.
---
Watch perplexity vs grimz
---
Alright dude, its a conspiracy against paladins.
---
Just go to https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=329643 and check by yourself, lmao.
---
I completely agree. This is one way in which I think WoW misses the mark. They are always tinkering with classes trying to balance them they have to do it for both PvE and PvP. That's a pain. Balance is important to a degree, but it should not be the end-all for each tweak. Having somewhat divergent unequal classes makes things fun. I sort of think WoW should have focused only on PvE, it's by far the best PvE MMO ever, it would have been easy for them.
---
These amaze me more and more every time
---
This is BS and out of context. Esfand heals through half the fights. He’s also not the best Ret pally. I played with a Ret pally on Nostalrius that pushed 500 DPS in ZG.
---
:(
---
How much on aveeage played do you have from 1 to 60 using only dungeon leveling with 5 chars?? Or how much xp per hr?
---
I am a paladin who plays primarily Holy, and I agree with this statement. You try to deceive me, or go 'Master Loot' right before a boss I want gear off of ... and you ain't going to get a heal after you pull as I bubble-hearth out bro.
---
&gt; That's where they made the mistake, and where they fixed it in TBC. 
---
If only they would have STOPPED at this...
---
I agree and I think class design in Vanilla was really far from ideal. It probably peaked in TBC.
---
You can really see the trajectory of their design philosophy. If you look at Warriors/Rogues/Mages going into TBC, they got more ways to increase their own damage. However, if you look at Hunters/Shamans/etc, they got group buffs (Expose Weakness, Totem of Wrath, Unleashed Rage). Classes that have no group utility have to double down on their personal DPS, while classes that provide group utility have to actually provide a net positive raid DPS increase. They didn't quite pull that off in vanilla.
---
While it is bad design when specs aren't useful in any lategame endeavor. However in the case of vanilla, that half that aren't raid viable are mostly PvP specs. I think it's important to have some specs geared more toward PvP instead of PvE. They demand different things, so some specs will necessary be good at one and sub-optimal for another. I'd rather Blizzard dedicate those specs to PvP or PvE and build the game around it, if it meant better class balance and representation for both PvE and PvP.
---
82 players atm, 70% expecting to raid. 50% active or hardcore. Only friends of friends. Classes generally spread even, with surprisingly few rogues. We are probably looking for a lot more to keep a stable raid group.
---
Because the hand holding started in TBC, and you felt part of the story.
---
In Vanilla you were just some random guy, in an open world. YOU WERE THE STORY.
---
I got a wedding to be at. Gonna bring my laptop and play as much as possible in the hotel room outside of the wedding and reception. Gonna try and play on the in flight wifi and if it's blocked I'm going to tunnel out thru a proxy and see if that works
---
So... You're telling that Blizz purposely bullshitting us on PvE leeway? Why would they do that, do they have warrior main in charge as well? In the datamined leeway code of 1.12 client it is still unclear if there are checks for combatants not/being playable characters, anyway all checks are made explicit and I don't think that would be hard to enable such checks on both server and client side.
---
Don't mind you, but we already have several cases of people remembering vanilla different that it actually was. Maybe mob leeway was present, but it is nothing that bad as we imgaine, and AoE farming will still be viable.
---
February 2015, EU Launch: I was 15 years old, my father was a gamer so we got ADSL a few years earlier to play Wc3 and CS online. School ended around 3pm and except for Handball practice I had all the time in the world to play.
---
August 2019: I have a 9y old son, a 1y old bonus daughter. Soon a house to take care of, a job where I get home around 4:20pm. I still exercise but not 2 hour practice with a ball, just gym for 45~ min 3 days a week. My job is dinner, laundry, dishes, trash and grocery shopping. And I can't stay awake to 12am every night and be happy.
---
So I guess I'll instead of play WoW like 50-60 hours a week, I can play around 20 hours a week.
---
It's still quite a lot honestly. Only reason I'm allowed to is because my girlfriend will do the same! Only downside to her is that she managed to talk my friends into playing Alliance instead of Horde :( That traitor..
---
Don’t think warts and all included bugs but hey strawmanning is easier than actually making a good argument and you seem desparate to believe in the ‘nochanges is 
---
finished‘ meme.
---
Anyway I’d much rather have a few spells behave oddly than 1000s of ‘small changes that wouldn’t affect the game I swear’, thanks.
---
My main was a Warrior, the first class I played so I had no frame of reference, it took forever to get to 60. 
---
Then I rolled a druid alt, it literally took me 1/4th the time to get to 60(heals travel form, better damage dealing) of course part of that was mote experience and looking at leveling guides. 
---
I will not be rolling a Warrior again. I absolutely loved tanking and Fury at level 60. It was extremely fun. Yet I don't want to level as a warrior again. If I get a friend to play with who roles a class that can heal I'd consider it, but I am not solo leveling a Warrior again. No way.
---
Oh yeah well true. Screw raid Tankadins.
---
So you loved resilience and class balance around arena, or the diminishing social factor because 25 men raids? Did you also loved badge gear? Or lvl 63 greens replacing T3 gear?
---
Nice! Same here! I think that’s what makes it just that exciting. To finally be able to is a dream come true
---
Perfect time to level fishing
---
Wowhead says the Scarlett warriors are level 6-7 in classic wow.
---
That sounds pretty cool actually, I'm from Brooklyn and will be keeping my eye on this thread.
---
After thinking a bit, this is what I would run (if my wife left me and i could play 3 hours a day and not have to justify 5x subs to her). The main thought process is reducing complexity as much as possible. If you're grinding for hours and trying to control 5 characters solo, the simpler the better.  
---
1 Pally tank - great tanking with just pressing 1 button every 8 seconds. You can't beat that. Auto attack class is a great feature for a multiboxer
---
1 Druid healer - imp thorns is nice for helping an afk tank maintain threat, and the rejuv/regrowth combo is a lot of healing, for 2 second character 'casting' investment  
---
2 Frost Mages - Imp blizzard/permafrost/frostbite - amazing dps/control for very low effort  
---
1 Warlock - Assists mages with RoF during for some extra dps, but mainly is here for summon cycling allowing for very low vendor/training downtime while camping for at dungeons
---
Well the gear you wear doesn't give you that much strength in P1 (and the dps impact is very minimal) and you need the mana to heal raids. So that's an easy choice against picking up strength, since I'd rather cast more heals. In what ways do you think it's not effective though? You only really need illumination to heal MC/BWL.
---
Yes. 25th, all active subs, no level cap, 48 hours.
---
Tanking in Vanilla isn't hard, a lot of times you are single target tanking and other DPS classes are CCing other targets. I loved taking in classic. Druid tanking is actually even easier and totally viable in classic, so if there are not enough Warriors druids will fill the void.
---
Hi, /u/Minimisethe

Finally someone who explains why all the meme specs are memes.
---
More than a few bosses require 2+ tanks. Four horsemen needs a whopping 8 tanks.
---
If your out in the world you should be using frost armor already. That said I have no issues with using as many binds as possible.
---
I'm the one who made that image as far as I remember it was a ZG/MC/Ony log thats why he did so much damage in AQ+ gear.

Show her The International and tell her that her kids could be millionaires!
---
well your story was shit
---
Priest is the "best" if you funnel Innervates to them. Paladin is better otherwise.
---
In Vanilla Efficiency is basically all that matters. There's only a handful of HPS-heavy fights.
---
If you want to PvP as a priest, I hope you plan on playing Horde.
---
&gt; but the "specs became bad later on because of TBC" is bollocks as the english say 
---
EXCEPT you are wrong. Players asked for MORE class "balance" in Wrath...because they GOT IT in TBC. And more class "balance" in Cata...because they got it in TBC and Wrath. And so on...until TODAY.
---
TBC was the start of the downhill of WoW.
---
Yes, specs became BAD because of TBC, like it or not, that is what happened.
---
And his warden's staff
---
IMO it's super fun to lead smaller groups, being the main tank in a 40-man that's a lot of pressure. I think since it will he 1.12 and Druids will be good tanks too finding tanks will be less difficult than finding a healer. Healing is somewhat fun, but it isn't as fun as tanking or DPSing imo.
---
Neither. Paladins strength is their healing, they suck at everything else so you should put a lot more points in holy.
---
Well, if that's true, I'll be happy, if I get my hands on a Sulfuras at least. I have priority on it, but, it needs to drop as well.
---
Everyone knows you start male then reroll around 25, that way you get the height and skip all the early ganks, but don't start to get fat and bald because you swap early.
---
It's just proper max min ing.
---
&gt; this shit is fucked to no end.
---
Lol give it a rest you drama queen.
---
I exclusively played as a clicker from vanilla to cata because I didn't understand keybinds were better. Then I played league.  Then I started on a vanilla server and realized I could map every single ability and just went to town. Wow became this new, much more fun beast to tackle.
---
I haven't played in over a year, but this time around I've got a mouse with 6 keys. I've 67890= bound, giving me the numbers on the keyboard I could never reach. I'm excited to try this out with a mage this time around as well.
---
The hype is real.
---
If you didn't grasp the example with ele and feral I'm afraid you don't understand the mindset to begin with. 
---
There are really two ways of achieving "perfect balance". Either you make every class have such similar DPS that it just doesn't matter which one you bring, or you make every class bring something different to the table (not necessarily DPS). There is no other way of doing it. OP is elaborating on how to make the latter work.
---
Preferably, you'd want a mix of both. However, any long-term player will agree that homogenization is undesirable (largely why I left) and the subscription numbers lightly support that hypothesis. So while you want a mix, you rather lean toward differentiation, which classic may do too heavily, making some specs have too bad DPS with too little to compensate.
---
Just wanna make one thing clear, if the only thing that differentiates classes is their DPS, then you get situations like in retail where Method stacks 15 feral druids because they happen to do the most DPS one patch. So it's a very similar issue in retail.
---
I "tanked" LBRS on a shaman once. Only took 3.5 hours to complete. 3500 hp, and I was such a genius I bought 2 green + defense items off the AH to help, trading out my blue gear with Stam and better stats. I can remember drooling over the epic item "Invulnerable Mail" thinking it'd make Shaman a super awesome tank.
---
He knows! German autocorrect is the devil!
---
And you can reset a dungeon without running out of it. You just need 1 extra account to do it (that i have). That can cut down the downtime a LOT.
---
I like these builds they add more fun to the dungeons :)
---
Surprised this isn’t downvoted into oblivion. People want classic but they don’t want the truth about it.
---
My standard answer in this case would be No
---
If you didn’t do your job then you ain’t reserve shit.  
---
But then again I only ran one run with a reserved item in all off vanilla. 
---
I hate loot drama so no reservations, no need for shards And no bitching and try to keep a positive vibe even if we wipe.
---
I want to add that in TBC Ret Paladins still didn’t see raid spots despite their utility and DPS increasing buffs. Horde Ret Paladins were more accepted because Seal of Blood helped bump them on the meters.
---
That said, nowadays the simulation engines could better quantify he benefits of the Paladin’s buffs. No matter what, player populations are fickle and if a class is consistently at the bottom of a meter they’ll be shit on, regardless of their utility. That’s why you read posts here about only bringing the bare minimum number of Hunters and Druids.
---
Which faction is best for a druid tank?
---
Lol. Rant over?
---
People want the vanilla man. Let it die. Who gives a shit. But that's what people want now. And dont want ass clowns ruining it with stupid changes that nobody needs.
---
&gt; So... You're telling that Blizz purposely bullshitting us on PvE leeway?
---
Yes.
---
The video evidence from real vanilla is clear as day. Mobs did not have a flat range increase when both targets were moving. I spent dozens and dozens of hours Cone of Cold kiting large packs of mobs in vanilla. As long as you stayed 6-7 yards away, you were golden.
---
Classic footage has shown that mobs can melee you from 8+ yards easily. Which makes CoC kiting basically impossible.
---
I don't give a fuck what 2019 Blizzard are claiming. I have 2 years of vanilla memories and a bunch of actual vanilla videos to tell me they're talking shit.
---
Rofl. Post of the day
---
There are going to be so many mages it's stupid. Warrior is the nicest sounding class on paper and in our dreams. When you play it, it's a goddam bitch, and it takes 150-200 hours on average to level.
---
People will say one thing, play the game, realize they want an easier time leveling, and switch.
---
Horde and alliance are actually quite well balanced in a WSG fight with optimal setups etc.
---
I think the two factions play well against each other.
---
&gt; Ever wonder why paladins couldn't tank in Vanilla?
---
How can you be this salty that paladins can't tank? It's a really good class regardless of that and they can still tank dungeons.
---
Theyre trying
---
Uuh, this sounds nice. I did try one totem addon that was just released in last days of classic, but didnt have time to see if it had that kind of functionality. I was planning on doing the same thing with wow cast sequence macros or like razer synapse macros.
---
Wow, handpick some logs out of context, which can't be even found, because you omit, which boss this is and base your opinion off it. Great stuff.
---
Putting logs with 40dps in your "proof" is completely ridiculous. It's obvious he was healing and just kept judgements up in those fights.
---
And those 200-300dps logs, who's to say, this was max dps and not him using Nightfall to help the raid?
---
I mean, he has logs on this site, where he deals 600+ dps, even some around 1500 against Thaddius. But those you omit, you deliberately pick the worst possible logs and present them as "proof".
---
For what it's worth, an AP ret in prebis already does 150dps completely unbuffed and doing nothing but autoattacking with SoC up. Aynbody who actually believes 300dps is the best a ret paladin can do in Naxx gear and fully buffed is hopeless.
---
And people wonder why "meme-specs" are so hated, when people like you spread misinformation like this. Disgusting.
---
Chicago guild plox
---
Healing metrics don’t matter if players don’t run out of mana and nobody dies.
---
And the odds that any of those logs presented were done in that gear are nil.
---
Those logs are healing and keeping judgement up and support raid with nightfall and cleanses. Not max dps.
---
Move with ur mouse, learn to not be reliant on wasd for loving and it Will help a lot on awkward positioning of zxcv. I only use qwe for moving, but during combat i usually use q and e for strafing and both mouse buttons for running.
---
&gt; There's no point in arguing against someone who thinks bad game design is "charming" and "honest" because those terms have no real meaning. 
---
Yet you are writing on a subreddit for a game that is being re-released for that exact reason.
---
PST...he buddy, i have the EU client and got the classic DL nothing to do with the stress test.
---
Also going by the reddit "everyone" has it (bullshit but that is what they keep saying)
---
Yah. Perplexity video shows a situation  which will never happen and is not designed to be put on display. But is designed to be viewed between 2 heros and interact between 2 different connections. So really perplexity video just shows a bunch of nothing important. I mean unless u are gonna be swinging at people running into walls while you strafe around. It's a great video.
---
Sorry to tell you this but they are not making RP-PvP servers in Classic.
---
&gt; Personally, I think playing Enhance in PvE Raid is stupid, but to each their own.
---
Oh, im not playing enchance, we might use improved weapon totems in melee groups, but still ofc main focus is resto and specifically chain raid healing between totemtwisting. Due to having too much healing in early content anyways. And its a HC guild so it isnt about clearing things, its about how fast you clear them.
---
Until the people whose accounts were stolen/want to come back decide to reclaim it. Good job wasting hundreds of hours on gearing.
---
&gt;retail kids
---
have fun trying to relive the days when your life wasn't just insulting people for playing a different game boomer
---
all the retail kids are looking forward to mind numbingly simple content because even lfr in retail is more complex than vanilla dungeons and raids
---
tryhards are serious, if you're not a try hard, you are not serious.
---
wait for a week till everyone pisses off out of the starting zones
---
It was 41 days yesterday, itll be 39 days tomorrow. Don't need a post every day about it
---
If was possible to trick new players into pvp
---
For a druid having a 0/30/21 build is optimal up to AQ40 because you only need 21 points in Restoration to get most of that tree and 30 points in Feral provide you with +20% intellect. After AQ40 you'll have enough crit for Nature's Grace and Moonglow to be worthy of attention so you end up with 24/0/21 + 6 extra talent points. Paladins are kinda the same since they only need 20 points in Holy to get most of that tree.
---
Seems logical
---
&gt;As for what’s next, the final stress test is now coming up on July 25-26 (we’ve changed this date since we first announced it). During that global test, we will roll out our multi-region hardware in preparation for the worldwide release of WoW Classic. In addition to getting many more testers to **play through the initial leveling experiences**, it will be a test of the fixes and tweaks that we’ve made and are making to the game.
---
I agree with you on layering. They need to get rid of it fast or it will fuck up the game imo.
---
why did this get so many downvotes? Who the fuck wants layering?
---
I would pick tailoring on your priest instead of alc. You can have a gathering profession to vendor goods too as you level, will always have bags and the BiS priest pre-raid gear (and beyond i think) is from tailoring but is BoP so has to be made by the user.
---
Which uses the same emulator most probably, without any touches on leeway..
---
Bitch I might be! Tell me why aint You working and waste company time on reddit? I saw Your browser history we got some talking to do.
---
Both have interrupts.
---
I think between 500-600g.
---
Yeah probably. The reason I want him to try it on one of those servers is that that's actually a pretty big assumption to make. Given how much WK has changed the scripts and the code after Nostalrius. It's quite a lot, to be frank, so chances are that they also did something to the leeway.
---
I am sorry, but you are talking about PRIVATE SERVERS, which are clearly as far off Vanilla as TBC was.
---
What world buff stacking? There was no such thing in Vanilla, and it WILL NOT BE IN CLASSIC, because well...SIX FUCKING HOURS CD. If a casual guild is popping Ony head at 5 pm, when they finished their Ony run...Rallying Cry NEXT buff is at 11 p.m.
---
Every single guild that is missing the Ony buff at 5 p.m. and starts raiding at 7 p.m., will have to either wait until 11 p.m. or reschedule. They WILL raid without the Ony buff. Same for ZG buff.
---
The reason of guilds NOT using World buffs in Vanilla wasn't because we didn't fucking know about it...it was because WE COULD NOT USE THEM, because SOME other guild already did it.
---
All you got left is DM buffs and Songflower (I exclude DMF because it was shit anyway and too much of a travel for it in the enemy territory).
---
DM solo farming?????? Dude, who the hell is doing it? 1% out of 1% of the player base? You get MORE GOLD if you run Strat/Scholo in 3 men (T2 geared Warrior, Mage and Priest).
---
Vanilla PvP is crap? Well, if you suck at, yes, it is crap.
---
Badge gear was the stupidest idea ever to be implemented in a MMORPG. DM and 20 man raids were NOT FUCKING BADGE GEAR !
---
BC was orders of magnitude WORSE than Vanilla, as an MMORPG.
---
You can have a guild bank. You just have it on other peoples accounts. They can edit a spreadsheet with how many golds and stuffs is there. It's all done online over the internet
---
Something need doing?
---
Soo...what’s the deal with cone of cold again? You didn’t actually say anything pertaining to the spell
---
In the early days the tip is going to be the level up you get for it. Bring me the cloth and if it's still yellow were gucci, if it's not still yellow I'm not advertising !
---
Yes. It's called a starting zone.
---
Sigh Dzers in friendlies haha. Only Puff or Wobble is worse imho. On the other hand, I learned to perfect shield from that matchup\^\^
---
My 12y old watched one asmongold video and was outraged by his needy style.  Now give me X.  And his followers did. I’m so lucky to play in EU.  
---
Now I’m going to play warrior and my son a paladin.  Instant dungeons, here we come ;)
---
&gt; In Vanilla... But on the pirated servers, everyone does it. Hell, people make alts just to farm it if their main isn't good at it. 
---
No, not everyone does. And again, PRIVATE FUCKING SERVERS are NOT Vanilla. They are so far from Vanilla, you can see Wrath from private servers.
---
This really is not true.
---
Big parts of ZG would be so much more difficult like if you couldnt sheep the 8men troll groups leading up to Mandokir or the axethrowers being sheeped to interrupt their throws, or the fearing wind serpents leading up to Hakkar.
---
ZG is pretty much a big middle finger to warlocks, because you need a plethora of mages for all the sheeps.
---
Majordomo would be very difficult without sheeping all these healers.
---
exactly.  People keep saying the casuals will carry the dead weight specs, but is nonsense.  The casuals can barely carry their own weight.
---
at 1% health or something?
---
please refer to us as zoomers :)
---
I saw merit to the date, but did not count on it. Especially when we were only a few months away from the date with no release date announcement still. So I did not make any arrangements on account of the date.
---
Hmm, yea thst might be the case yea, I just remembered warlocks being important.
---
Did actually take a close look on those logs as to why he is so low?
---
Patchwerk, he doesn't even show up on the dmg chart and that would have been the fight, where you could gauge ret pala dps the best.
---
Grobbulus, 537dps. Far above what was posted here. And likely in full dmg mode. Though, it looks like he missed a few swings.
---
Gluth, a 70sec fight, where he has 8 autoattacks. So, he likely died after ~20sec. Meaning, his real dps would have been roughly triple what's shown on the logs, i.e. 633.
---
Thaddius 1137 dps. Shows, that this was a weaker run for him as his best on Thaddius is nearly 1600 dps.
---
Noth. 13 autoattacks in a 1min fight. Likely died after ~45 sec. So real dps is +33%, which would put him at ~650dps.
---
Heigan. He used Seal of rightousness here and is missing a lot of other abilities. Don't know what happened here, but it's certainly not representative.
---
Loatheb, 2:43min fight, 36 autoattacks, so he died after 2min. Again +40% dps, would put him around 600.
---
Anub'Rekhan. Very short fight, he did 485 dps, which is pretty low, but he also was very unlucky with only 4 SoC procs and 2 of them being dodged. This could have easily been 600dps as well. With MoM you have roughly 17 auto attacks per minute and an expected 7 SoC procs per minute.
---
Faerlina, 650dps, nothing to see here.
---
Maexxna, pretty low at 330dps and I don't really see why. He got a bit unlucky with SoC procs, but even with normal luck there, it wouldn't have been more than 450dps.
---
Razuvious, fairly low at 460dps, but again bad SoC luck. Expected number of procs in 90sec is 10, not 5. Also didn't have Shadow Oil on.
---
Yeah, 5 autoattacks in a 5min fight. He either died immediately or didn't dps. Completely pointless log.
---
4 horsemen. Rotten SoC luck. 7 procs with 37 autoattacks is less than half what you should get and no crit either. With normal SoC Proc rates, he would have beaten the hunters. His number of autoattacks also seems low. 37 is around 2 minutes of hitting, while the rogues sit at 200+ autoattacks, which would be close to 3 minutes with swordspec.
---
Sapphiron. 34 autoattacks in a 4 min fight. Rogues sit at 250. So, he died after 2-2.5min, meaning would have been 400-450dps if he lived. Also very low number of consecration ticks, which costs a lot of dps.
---
Kel'Thuzad, 9 min fight, 59 autoattacks. So around 3.5 minutes worth. Rogues have over 500 autoattacks, which is around 7 minutes worth. so he likely died again and would have dealt 300-350 dps without dying, which would put him close to the lower mages and fury warriors.
---
You can clearly see, that he can do 600-700 dps, but in this particular raid, he either died consistently or suffered from bad SoC luck. And he is AP ret, which is likely worse than spelladin.
---
This is what I plan on doing.
---
I don't understand lack of Sanctity Aura or rather: going Eye for an Eye instead of Sanctity Aura.
---
its always the mage if you want every thing . and range.
---
[youtube.com](https://youtube.com) search private server leeway sorry im not regularly checking reddit nerd
---
If they'd at least have different ressource systems in place to diversify the gameplay.
---
Instead they went ahead and converted nearly every DPS to "Builder - Spender with some sort of combo points".
---
Yes! Cairnes death was so poorly used 2. Voljins was a tad better but not by much.
---
Way to not actually read what ppl write..
---
I didnt say druids can't tank in raids, heck i am probably the biggest advocate for druid tanking and gonna roll one in classic, but i said to OP that the difference with warriors is theyre better suited for raids, which IS true.
---
The fact that you have your focusrite allows you to get a "real" mic as opposed to a USB-mic. I'd probably search around for used microphones. 
---
One of the things you need to consider is where you prefer to place it (on table, boom-arm, or other) , the amount of background noise, etc. So whether you want a cardioid, a dynamic one, a shotgun, etc. 
---
Røde and audio-technica are popular among streamers, and they have similar needs for them :)
---
~800g depending on the server prices.
---
352.40 gold is required for the quests alone
---
Sounds like our kinda guy! Stop by Discord and say Lok'tar ogar if you have time :)
---
Layering.
---
You've lost already.
---
Always carry potions. Seriously. 
---
The highest rank available Health pots (These are handy even when mobs parry once too many, this shit kills you during lvling lol)  and preferably Free action pots / Swiftness for wpvp situations. 
---
I normally pick up Alch / Herb when playing classic warrior just to sustain my own potion guzzling - added benefit is you can create arcanite bars at max lvl for your BiS blacksmithing gear (Lionheart etc)
---
Can we just do 250 cuts
---
Sure.
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=329643
---
Look at the best chart.
---
And if you want to see the Thaddius log, here you go:
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=11418&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=18049
---
It's above average, sure (21 SoC procs with 42 autoattacks. Expected would have been 17-18). but looking at his other dps scores, it's clear an ap ret can do 600 dps on most bosses.
---
They stand in the corner and buff everyone
---
You'll be able to farm these spot clear, short before respawn, as 31/20/0 warrior with zg gear including the 2h sword. I've done these for hours between bgs back in the day.
---
Layering costs them money, it doesn't save anything. They are introducing it so the servers wont be dead in a few months.
---
&gt; the TPS of feral druids is actually REALLY strong, crit maul has insane threat modifier. 
---
On private servers, yes.
---
In Classic, all players lose about 1/3rd of the crit they have on private servers.
---
Druids in Vanilla, as well as in Classic...will be bellow Prot Warriors, in both THREAT and SURVIVABILITY, by a good margin.
---
Fury tanking will not exist outside heavily overgearing a raid.
---
I feel really sorry for people that comes from private servers, or listen to private server players, roll a Druid or Fury Warr for tanking, and being obliterated by raid bosses, than probably rage quit the game.
---
Feral Druid TPS will be BELLOW Prot Warrior in Classic, with MCP and whatever else you want, because the loss of crit hampers their threat in a BIG WAY.
---
Fury TPS will be above, slightly, Prot Warriors, but their survivability will be close to inexistent.
---
We are getting VANILLA on August 26/27th....NOT PRIVATE SERVERS.
---
My man.
---
Why not Elbarto?
---
Way down the line some things could be added to endgame once everyone is lvl 60 on a few characters and fully geared..
---
&gt; Implement rated bg, rated arena,
---
&gt; implement  m+/r+ as it should be :
---
No better gear to be had from higher difficulty (so doing higher lvl keys doesn't just become a meaningless grind to higher ilvl = higher key = higher ilvl to cap...). Dungeons can go harder,  but your gear can't improve. Big cds are limited (much like brezez)  so ppl don't just spend a day in the dungeon using all cds each pull. Doing higher difficulty should be HARD and require perfect use of cc, cds, and consumables. NO TIME LIMIT, strategy and setup should be the name of the game, not zérg rush...
---
Same principle for raids.
---
&gt; Rewards can be titles / mounts.
---
&gt; New content = new lvl 60 dungeons and raids, same difficulty as others, but can require different type of gear (nature resist, frost etc..)
---
&gt; implement small class balance patches 
---
&gt; MAYBE implement seasonal affix to the m+ dungeons / raids to keep things fresh down the line
---
Soul Link is for dueling and 1v1, but its damage is pitiful compared to SM/Ruin, which is more widely used for premades.
---
This is the 1.13 files...
---
Nah screw that, ive had it with those dumb ass posts every day. It makes the wait seem even longer. Just pin a damn counter on top of the page I can conveniently ignore and stop this useless drivel.
---
Such a stupid reply. He feels sorry for the limitations those people are imposing. Good job pointing out that they also have fun! That was a valuable contribution.
---
It's pretty normal to feel sorry for people, even if they're having a good time. Why even bother leaving this comment?
---
omg...i remember watching this and trying to do most of these things
---
yes, addons on the old vanilla only had name &amp; level they could use to differentiate targets with, if they had identical names addons would loose track and only way to keep that would be through adding a guessing mechanic or have it trigger when a key is pressed rather than when a spell is cast. :)
---
The weapons from the last boss are so good they basically almost last you until level 60. It's kinda hilarious.
---
I dont know tbh and its a gamebreaker for me, im gonna have to play the class that was my second choice unfortunatly. 5 second traps when polymorph can last 30seconds is ridicilous.
---
&gt;DPS - (Only 1 or 2   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Hunter 
---
You're declared an entire class is a meme spec due to some shit pirated servers abusing the world buff exploits.
---
Oops so sorry for misclicking 'need'...
---
Do you know if characters played here will carry over to when it releases? Levels, items, etc?
---
Yea I think I will have more focus on potions this time around. I think I played vanilla without using any. Mostly because I did not want to spent gold on it. I want to be an engineer and I will most likely pick up mining. So I will have to spend the gold this time around.
---
It's a lot closer to 41 than 40.
---
This is false. Just check mages: they have it all and they're the ones topping the meters (if they get the ignite). Great control, great farming, great group utility (decurse is only shared with druids, and add ArcIntellect to the mix and even amplify/dampen magic in certain environments) but still great damage. 
---
Let's go for raid utility: Mages have already  been covered. Hunters have their kiting and CC/trapping, TSA, howl if wolf pet for melee, aspect of the wild (nice for AQ). Rogues are clutch in supression room, and their single-target CC and interrupts are handy in some situations. Locks have out of combat utility (summons) but then there's also banish, their curses and health/soulstones. 
---
The only *raid utility* that is not there is the healing duty, let it be straight heals or cleansing debuffs other than curses (which mages can already do).
---
"Geared properly" - in 8/8 T2 and general MC/BWL Bis, the classic deep MM/survival spec outperforms deep Survivability. But deep survivability might edge out around Naxx.
---
Plus, Trueshot Aura is really nice. Other physicals benefit a lot more from the 100 extra AP than the hunter actually does.
---
Are there any big EU streamers like Asmongold?
---
Don't want to join a server and get flamed/hunted by 10k+ spergs because I accidentally killed the streamer during world PVP.
---
I really hate that mentality that most streamers have where they just scream stream sniper when they get ganked multiple times.  
---
And then they report the poor kid because they are mad about it too.
---
It's just part of the basic Hunter rotation.
---
Found your problem.
---
There was a pserver that emulated vanilla on the Wotlk client that was pretty awesome. There's also a Vanilla+ server that was recently announced that aims to extend vanilla after 1.12, so its as if TBC never came out and revamped things, although they did mention somehow balancing talents to make every spec better. They're also adding in Northrend and Outland via patches to the vanilla client, as well as Hyjal and some other places. I obviously can't link it here so just search for "Vanilla+ server" on r/wowservers
---
Im not arguing anything, im stating facts. And a 0-5yard - 1 yard in terms of melee range is ABSOLUTLY noticable when playing, hence why the pserver players immediatly noticed the difference.
---
Makes sense now, i like it
---
Keywords "if you are good" and "micromanage". Most hunters weren't good and had no concept of micromanaging, and even less idea of what macros were and how to utilize them properly.
---
I feel you - back when vanilla first came out I used to skimp out on higher lvl ammo for my hunter because I wanted to save that extra silver lmao. Its fun trying again with a new outlook on things, good luck my man.
---
&gt;So... You're telling that Blizz purposely bullshitting us on PvE leeway? Why would they do that?
---
While I doubt this is the case and I'm just going full tinfoil hat mode for the fun of it:
---
What if blizzard is being so adamant about terrible and dated backend mechanics because they want us to clamor for #somechanges. This would give them more leeway (hehe) to make changes without causing a shitstorm, because the community was asking for it after all.
---
Vanilla was easy when no one knew their class, 3-5 of them were AFK and people didn't even try. A few bosses in AQ40 and Naxx requires you to actually stay awake, but no. Vanilla wasn't hard in any way.
---
Bosses in retail are extremely much harder but a lot of guilds can take them down with time, even if they don't tryhard.
---
You are correct though, a good player with bad gear is viable as long as he's 60. A good player with good gear is viable with any spec or profession and you can meme down almost everything.
---
40 days and 16 hours\*, 14 now, closer to 40 and a half days. I get that rounding down makes it seem closer, but there's too many hours yet, it wouldn't make sense to say 40 days left if it were still 40 days and 23 hours. At least were getting close. Can't wait until we're in the last 30 days already becoming impatient.
---
What's the logic behind wanting Classic to fail? Did Blizzard/Activision suddenly hate making money?
---
So, we have low dps numbers from a paladin in great gear.
---
As proof of his great gear, you link his armory page. On that very same armory page on the right side are boss statistics which show dps numbers which exceed those shown here several times over. Yet, those numbers are ignored, we should only look at the gear.
---
I was elbarto when I played my UD mage back in vanilla. This time its Barto or Bartho. Depends on the class / race. Without the h is more Sharp like the daggers of my rogue. With h is more soft like the weave of my priest.
---
you're assuming there aren't already holy paladins in the raid
---
well said. One criticism though, typically a 40 man raid has something like 10-13 healers, but it doesn't change your point at all.
---
if you're using blizzard to try and break rogues out of stealth you're already doing it wrong.
---
I don't know if you like PVE or PVP. Druid is in the 60 version of PVE. Most of the functions are second-line treatment. DPS is not high. As a tank, there is no warrior. But the performance in PVP is still possible. Purely personal opinion, if there is a mistake, welcome to ask :)
---
This is a rating I have seen on the Internet about various occupations. I can't say it is completely correct, but I can also refer to it.
---
[What career is best for WOW Classic?](https://u4nwyatt.wordpress.com/2019/07/15/what-career-is-best-for-wow-classic/)
---
On wowclassicpopulation.com night elves are a distant second for alliance and 4th overall behind humans, undead and orcs. 
---
I would probably argue that those 3 have the 3 strongest racials overall.
---
It’s not super cheap to gear up the twin emps warlocks (not toooooo bad, but still pricey - we geared two up to max shadow res in order to have a backup) but it’s not really reasonable to gear up all of your locks for that fight.  Hitting resistance cap as a clothie is annoying and involves some nice boe greens.
---
And that is completely fine
---
So i was right, pserver and classic dont have the same leeway and the argument that pserver players should had noticed it after years of playing is false. So i was right and you were wrong huh? Funny how that works sometimes.
---
I do not know. But I know if it doesn't ever get updates I'll finish it.
---
Like most of us aren't doing the same mentally anyway.
---
whoever that stupid streamer is, he has no fucking clue
---
the mob behavior is spot on
---
Aye! It‘s not much but it‘s honest work for my guild pals!
---
Bullseye. This is the big issue. These classes have as much utility as the so-called hybrids, they just lack their healing aspect. And this even works in their favor, since it simplifies their stat allocation and allows them to get ideal itemization easily, unlike the poor druid (just to pick one of them) and the itemization mess they face.
---
Nah you just disagree
---
While i think your quiet right for main tank, i'd love to have a feral druid as off tank. less gear competition is amazing, and you have the druid ready for those couple of boss fights where a druid is the better option
---
Thanks dude! Actually I‘m super excited because it is such an upgrade! In the end my sweet nightelf priest will pay the price ;(
---
You have no clue. Vanilla was the peak of class design, by an enormous margin. Hybrids should be weaker, its a good thing. The day a shaman does even half the dps of a mage, thats when you know the devs fucked it all up and the game is no longer a good rpg.
---
Lots of vendor grays and food/mana pots/health pots, aswell as holy water wich does sick aoe dmg against undeads, used for bwl/naxx but it also speeds up strat/scholo grinding even more.
---
It was a bug in vanilla and was only present for 2 patches out of ALL THE VANILLA patches, you cant claim thats the vanilla hunter.
---
Lawl! Wish I could do this but for me it is a complete new team and the first few days are crucial for everybody. I will take a long christmas break I guess :)
---
Why is that? You're saying the way he tanks is wrong, yet him tanking the wrong way was still a viable strategy in Naxx. That means somebody who is tanking the "right" way will do a better job and have a easier time progressing.
---
No, traps didnt last 5 seconds, they last as long as polymorphs. You can eat and bandage your self just like a mage can. With the Scatter+trap bug you can barely even get distance before the trap breaks
---
How does it not save them money? Don't they now require less overall hardware? Doesn't layering guarantee that they won't have any wasted servers with tiny populations?
---
&gt;even some around 1500 against Thaddius
---
you know thaddius isn't really a good benchmark for dps right?
---
His BEST Patchwerk dps is 579. That's laughable.
---
Why is the urge for some of you to have leeway in the game when its obviously a clunky mechanism now that everyone has decent internet speed? Is this a #nochance type of thing?
---
Resto is terrible at farming. With spelldamage or feral gear it becomes bear(able).
---
They are fun in pvp. You can make plays and annoy the shit out of the enemy faction. Plus you will be the flag carrier in WSG most of the time.
---
I also really like druid healing in raids and dungeons, you will be a true supporter with innervate.
---
Sounds like too much guesses to me.
---
&gt; My point is exactly that "balance" doesn't have to mean all classes do equal DPS. 
---
Most of the ones who do ask for it (myself included) never ask for such ending. We ask for *enough* DPS. We ask to be considered just one more, not the one to blame when shit hits the fan, not the one considered to *steal* others' gear, not the one *being carried by the raid* an all the crap typical minmaxers spit out.
---
&gt;but looking at his other dps scores, it's clear an ap ret can do 600 dps on most bosses.
---
Strangely enough he has 2 out of 14 bosses above 600.  
---
Thaddius isn't really that meaningful because of polarity buff
---
Id join any reserve run if it doesnt affect me.
---
The real cancer are gbid pugs, I never join those, and if I can sabotage them ill do without hesitation
---
&gt; OT would preferably be a Fury Warrior
---
y
---
the pet sacrifices himself warlock can still get it while sapped , unless the rogue stun the void before killing it but its not easy at all .
---
Lets not exaggerate, any ZG group will be absolutely fine with 2-3 mages. preferably 1 of them deep frost to blizzard pull the zombies
---
"Buddy" "lol"
---
&gt;"Just don't ask for a raid spot in a BWL raid. You won't get it."  
---
&gt;I bet less hardcore guilds will clear BWL or AQ40, too. It will take time, but they will clear this raids.  
---
&gt;So, just don't tell people, when and what to ask other people, its everything but not your business.  
---
&gt;If a guild is okay with a unperfect raid setup, than who the fuck cares. Many people are playing wow we can't speak for them. Maybe some guys want to try Boomkins and Ret Paladins between their other dps, sure it will be harder, but maybe they are okay with it?  
---
&gt;I'll play a dwarf healing priest, pretty meta for sure but i just dont like other healers and hate humans or nf... but if i would like to play a ret paladin, i would make my own guild and inv. people who want to raid with me as ret... no one will "force" them or something.   
---
&gt;People went afk MIDFIGHT, back in the days... had to do "outfight resurrection", if you know what it means..  
---
&gt;The Raids  were pretty easy in compare to Mythic+. But someone like you will play frostmage in mc /bwl, later fire mage and perfectly roll ignite :) if you dont die in the first circle on the ground xD
---
But... locks top charts in naxx?
---
Agreed.  Most inexperienced guilds are not going to give their tanks Accuria or DFT only because they’re worried the melee will freak out.  Setting proper expectations is going to prevent so much drama, but a surprisingly few number of guilds will have that type of foresight to present a “tank reserve” list before the guild steps into its first raid.  Been there done that on private servers. The drama was unreal when the first accuria went to a tank.  Lessons learned.
---
Yet there are people who want true vanilla "OSRS" servers, and they are shut down just like we used to be. They have problems as well, and just because it works for them doesn't mean it will work for WoW. WoW doesn't even have a single person from the original team working for WoW at this time.
---
There is no ground on which you can reliably compare these 2 games.
---
put on the dress retfriend
---
I think what Blizzard did wrong after Vanilla is to design classes around raid content. Vanillas's classes are so unique because they were never designed around raiding. We know what it led to when Blizzard decided that raiding is the most important part of the game. The classes got homogenized and the rest of the game had to suffer. I'm glad this design philosophy isn't present in Vanilla.
---
i feel its a bit a slippery slope to just re-release tbc. Then you get people asking for wotlk, then maybe some for cata, where do yo udraw the line?
---
It also would progressively shatter the player base, as people would move to the newer thing, reducing population for those who just want classic.
---
that said, my favorite idea ive seen was from that original dev, who wants them to re-create TBC using the same assets they have, resdesigned around the core design pillars of classic wow.  
---
I'd also like to see them simply timecapsule classic, then release a classic+ with the above design ideals, re-creating the expansions perhaps with horizontal progression, so old content isnt trivialized
---
So there is a difference? Then OP's point is moot.
---
You typed &lt; wrong
---
[31/20 Fury became the meta build on p-servers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_azvBdVgz0) We'll see if the same meta will be reflected in Classic, but all signs currently point to yes.
---
It's mostly because you are a Dwarf, use a gun and have /openfire as part of the macro you use to start autoattacking and sending your pet to a new target.
---
Good luck stealing gear from literally every caster in raids.
---
You'll still be bottom barrel dps until the raid is on farm and you can get the hand me downs.
---
Its not going to get changed because its not something the devs have control over. Layering was obviously a management/budgeting decision and to change it at this point would just be wasteful. If its not gone by 2 or 3 weeks then raise all the hell in the world, until then most of us (while not happy about it) aren't retarded enough to continue bitching about it.
---
I think the problem with repeating previous expansions is that the point at which wow becomes more like current retail is kinda subjective. I personally would like tbc and even wotlk but many people think that flying was bad and lfg worse. 
---
I think, depending on whether classic gains and retains enough players, that this should be an "alternate time" with different expansions which are more like an extension of classic rather than a transition to current retail. 
---
But that's my dream scenario, I doubt it would happen.
---
That wasnt the point of this thread, the point was that pserver supposably have the same leeway as classic and pserver players should have noticed this years ago instead of when classic beta came out, wich is false, since the leeway is CLEARLY not the same distance.
---
that doesn't explain why two fury/prot offtanks is preferable to 1 fury/prot and 1 feral.
---
Arr you talking about rets or boomy? Boomy i agree with but if spellpower ret does dmg comparable to a mage i don't see why they shouldn't get gear.
---
What? Hell no, I'm not trolling. I am just flirtatiously in-character. I used to play on RP servers and immerse a little as always. Sorry if I sound offensive or something. Peace.
---
Tanking 5 mans and tanking raids are completely different. Raid tanks generally lose their skill at 5 mans.
---
Not if the dpsers dont colaborate. They must wait the shaman to build some aggro. The average joe burns all cds as soon as warrior shoots his gun
---
You literally never played vanilla and just joined this stupid banwagon of "nochanges"
---
You're right, I meant to type "Shaman &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Paladin"
---
He's not that bad, he's just not outstanding either.
---
People who can't have fun while losing, have some unspoken issus... or they lose a lot, A LOT.
---
Friend of my went enrage everytime he lost in LoL... the true rage was/is about his jobs, he hates it and counts the days up to friday his whole life... 
---
No wonder he can't lose, he needs the win badly to feel better. This people are playing games only for the wins, to get the one win, they dont have in life.
---
Privat Servers got some things wrong. For example on pservers it is possible to stack world buffs. That wasn't possible in Vanilla and will not be possible on Classic servers. Another example is mob placement. Some skips on pservers just won't work in Classic.
---
If you want to keep your guild small, you can always find a partner guild for the raids. Back in Classic I was in a Tauren guild on a RP-server. We had a cooperation with a Troll guild and they did every raid except Nax.
---
I wasn't interested in raiding but I would occasionally jump in when they were short of a healer. I'm pretty sure they could have done it without me because my gear wasn't optimized. So I guess some raids can be done without a full 40 man raid. But 20 ... I'm not so sure about that.
---
Me is the name of my warlock, so it wasnt you
---
Thanks. I will be a bit more effective and with better knowledge this time:)
---
I saw a druid aoe'ing some water elementals in felwood with dots and hurricane.  Looked fairly effective, and his gear was shit.
---
I can‘t remember that well anymore but I think tbc had the best balance deal from all expansions. Somehow everything was at least a little bit viable. I get your point. A pala with all his buffs shouldn‘t do as much dmg as a fire mage. The problem is: everything a dmg pala brings with his utility a holy pala does also bring to the table.
---
play druid, you will get given all sorts of purple crap
---
Mages give raid buffs that help: int, dampen magic and amplify magic, they can decurse. It's a great dps and small support class at the same time. Food doesn't kill bosses - true.
---
Okay, I'll put it in easier words:
---
Being viable for 90% of content means that when you run into that 10% of content you're not viable for, that's 40 pissed-off players.
---
While Feral can be better in *some* very specific fights, there are other fights they simply can't handle being the OT—whereas a Warrior can take on *all fights no matter what.* 
---
Reliability is as important as viability to a healthy guild/raid.
---
Yeah, his patchwerk best is pretty bad. Don't know why. But keep in mind, that Esfand, while being a very good player, isn't the absolute top.
---
Look at Almondbutter 
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=769505
---
Yeah, 800dps against Patchwerk also isn't close to the top dmg specs, but it's reasonable.
---
That's more representative of the top end a ret paladin can achieve.
---
In terms of talents, Moonglow or Heart of the Wild druid.
---
You would need a lot of gear pieces to swap around (which is common for druids up till WotLK), but will probably be able to never change talents.
---
 A Hunter’s Frost Trap ground effect will break Rogues out of stealth. 
---
 Rogues are not broken out of stealth by Blizzard until they take damage. 
---
???????
---
guess I'll stay retarded then
---
Meme specs and people that don't try. When the raid is close to a boss kill but lacking DPS and 33 of 40 people are using flasks + pots it creates resentment. I'm of the opinion a guild needs a specified set of rules for raiding and that set of rules is enforced.
---
Dont forget druids tho
---
Leeway is not a mechanic that you just go and touch. It is probably a mechanic that hasn't been touched since 1.12 Mangos was created because there hasn't been any need to touch it.
---
&gt;Being viable for 90% of content means that when you run into that 10% of content you're not viable for, that's 40 pissed-off players.
---
You are a viable MT in 90% of content, but a viable offtank in 100% of content.
---
What fight can a druid not offtank?
---
&gt; There is absolutely no way a ret paladin does this little dmg. You can easily do 200 dps completely unbuffed with prebis gear.
---
Sure, in fights with no mechanics where you just get to stand there pressing buttons. In most fights, people do way less DPS than training dummy DPS. The hypothetical DPS numbers that people tend to talk about are only actually possible in a select few fights where you don't have to do a bunch of other shit. If we say ret DPS is 500, there'll be plenty of fights where the actual output is 2-300.
---
Just made arcane leveling a tad more viable
---
You clearly dont know how Thaddius works, lmfao. A full gear Ret doing sub 600 dps. Keep dreaming about the ret dream, man.
---
For **20/0/31**: 
---
I'd rather put the point in Divine Illumination than Repentance, so you'd be sure to have a full free heal cast going off and turning the loss in a win. With the high amount of UD it will also be a lot less useful, on the other hand not many will know wotf breaks it. DI also speeds up leveling a lot because of free healing.
---
1 Point in Consecrate instead of Unyielding Faith is also a nobrainer, rank 1 spam denies rogues opening and keeps people in combat while supporting for example a flagrunner. While leveling it's also great in combination with BoS for big pulls or killing small critters that sometimes spawn when killing a mob.
---
But honestly if you want to level with a 2 hander you shouldn't really go further than 11 points deep in Ret, you can't keep Vengeance up anyway because of your low crit%. I think the following build is a lot better for that and also a lot more fun with reckoning which will win you a lot of 1v2s : https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/505031-0532400303005-52030001 
---
1 point left, you can use it for kings or sanctuary to make your tanks happy in groups or tank yourself if you don't feel like healing or dpsing. Just make sure to pick up imp righteous fury if you plan on tanking as well.
---
For **24/27/0**:
---
This build is a lot better in pve and grouppvp but you won't be killing much solo unless it's a melee that 100% wants the kill.
---
Imp LoH is a bit useless, it's more of a raiding talent for the extra armor it gives, you're again overvalueing Unyielding Faith.
---
Imp concentration aura is also not needed, with 70% it should provide enough protection unless you're raiding. It does give you practice though for future aura switching but honestly you should be doing that anyway while healing/dpsing to support your tank with ret/devo/resist depending on enemies.
---
Taking both Kings and Sanc is also not useful unless you're planning on running with 2 paladins, people prefer wisdom/might.
---
- - -
---
In the end these are just some personal tips and you might feel different about it and that's fine because that's the fun thing about classic, many different builds can work despite there being cookiecutter specs.
---
At 60 the build I thought was strongest in group-pvp and you felt like a true hybrid was the following one:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/055031015011-0532410003-55000001
---
Strong heals, lower cd stuns, better blessings and with SoC you still have the ability to equip a 2-Hander and surprise the enemy with a 2k attack if the stars align.
---
Its good if you make the shaman stfu once and for all
---
The warrior tank probably didn't want to roll against you for the 2h mace in DM tbh.
---
Stack worldbuffs? Like 2 Dragonslayer? Don't know any pserver where this is possible.
---
Id think its much better than people give it credit. Shamans have incredible snap aggro on single target, we were testing some duo levelup with warrior+ shaman and warr couldnt keep aggro, not at all. Rockbiter + earth shock is massive amount of frontloaded threat. Even doing aoe pulls it might be better than warriors up to like L50.
---
Tbh, i might even test this shit out multiboxing with epix geared shammy.
---
ITT: Salty rets
---
I searched private server leeway, now what?
---
The other person said "I hope you plan on playing Horde", which is the same as "Don't play Alliance". Yes, WOTF
---
I do find it funny that the leeway thing has people proclaiming that internet is better than it was 15 years ago, for some people it is, but in large parts of the world it's still shit (BR, asia, aus, parts of america, gemany, RU all having problems)
---
Thats like..1/8th of a man?
---
More people playing warlock on horde side doesn't mean there are more raid slots for warlocks.
---
It does seem much much farther away in the beta video?
---
I don't really care personally.
---
Was 16-17 HS student. Only made it to BWL and AQ20. 30 now, nothing super important going on in my life though, I drive for delivery apps and make enough to get by because I live in OH and rent is cheap so I'll probably play a shit ton and achieve what I couldn't before.
---
Priest's only CC is a fear on a long cooldown, it's significantly stronger when you don't have to deal with Will of the Forsaken.
---
Also, the best priest racials for PvP belong to Undead &amp; Trolls.
---
That's how it worked later on in WoW (and presumably still does) so the mistake is rather easy to make.
---
I had very similar problem recently. Wanted to play paladin, mage and hunter. It ended up like this: TBC server launched and i leveled up hunter to 23. Then i realized i want to play paladin, so i deleted hunter (to use that name) and leveled paladin to 62. Then, i really wanted to play mage so i also leveled up mage up to 70 and started to do rep gainz and heroics. During the heroics, i came to conclusion, i dont enjoy mage as much as i should and i really wish i would be hunter. I leveled another one to 30 just to get burned out and quit. I gave all my 8000g to one lucky guy and quit for good. During this session i have realized, to stay with one class, you must develop a strong connection with it. You must know, what you enjoy most in what situtions - PvP, PvE, dungeons/raids. I was pretty good with mage in PvP, but i found the rotation too booring. Thats where hunter kicked it, since his rotation was fun for me and i actually enjoyed killing mobs, instead of just thinking of it as a duty. Killing NPCs (PvE) is huge part of WoW, so i would personally put this at first place. Secondly, i would look, how much you enjoy PvP in BGs with it and lastly, aesthetics. This worked for me, since i know now, that in vanilla i ll be warrior and in tbc i would be hunter. Good luck to you
---
&gt;90% of fights with a Feral MT? On Progression? 
---
Skarm literally suggests letting the druid tank Vael 1st for the threat.  Why do you think a druid can't offtank vael?
---
Why do you think they can't offtank these fights?
---
And we'd say, "ok, let's remake the group without the Sham"
---
I did play vanilla. I have 2 accounts. 1 was mine and 1 was my girlfriend's.
---
I played well before I remember there was +hit on pre zg gear. There wasnt even +dmg to spell on pretty much every piece of blue gear I can remember. Just stats.
---
The reason I want hunters to keep crying is because i love the salty tears
---
Making that wand will make you lever slower, its a net loss compared to just leveling and getting the quest wand in darkshore
---
They will not.
---
I mained one on Nost and it was a bit meh. It's one of the least interesting healing styles, in my opinion. It's easy to get a raid spot since so few people play druid, but it's a hassle for dungeons since you can't rez properly. You can't bring a paladin/shaman *every* time.
---
Rejuv doesn't stack with other Rejuvs so it's pretty much just the best-geared druid in the raid who uses it, and HoTs were always pretty terrible in vanilla anyway unless you have a set bonus (e.g. 2pc T3) that gives it something special. Most of the ticks just become overhealing.
---
99% of the time, you just spam Healing Touch rank 4, or 3 later on when you have enough +healing. The HPS is probably the lowest of all healers, but it catches up a bit in the second half of vanilla. You bring druids for MotW and to have a couple of battle rezzes, and to lessen the demand for priest/paladin/shaman gear; not really for their healing output.
---
Like other healer specs, resto druid is pretty terrible for farming. If you're staying in that spec at all times, you should make money doing something that doesn't involve grinding mobs, so things like herbalism and mining. You *can* do stuff like Mara princess runs and DM lashers but I suspect these runs won't really be good in Classic without the pserver reset trick.
---
The pros of resto druid is that it's got a unique role in WSG, is easier to get a raid spot and gear with because it's the least played class, and it's the healer that has the most "moves" in 1v1 PvP (if you don't count stuff like ele/resto shaman or holy reckoning paladin which aren't *really* healers). All full healers suck in 1v1 but druids at least have great mobility, tankiness, and can kite people forever. It's a poor healer in BGs, though.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpAvcGcEc0k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpAvcGcEc0k)
---
You just got to stick with it. Even if you choose 2 classes, and just switch for some downtime from your main. I played private servers and realised I really like Priest, whereas before (back in vanilla when I was 12) I was all about hunter, but couldn't stick with it. So when classic comes about I will be maining a priest then going onto Hunter when I need that downtime. Also don't forget that levelling is a journey- stop thinking about end game so much and have an adventure. You have the professions for downtime too, a bit of fishing is good for the soul.
---
I think the key is balance, just try not to burn yourself out by playing too much, have a day off here and there, set yourself goals to complete each day, and don't look at other players and think "oh man I wish I could sneak/heal/tank/polymorph" 
---
Hope this helps.
---
20/25 would be too much. 35 definitely, maybe 30 would be ok.
---
Orc warlocks lategame (BWL-Naxx) are easily the strongest 1v1 race/class combo in the game.
---
Mages are stronger 1v1 early in the game when people have less stamina on gear.
---
Of course the game doesn't revolve around 1v1 but I personally love dueling and world PvP.
---
Lol
---
Think it was 1.10 yeah, that's the only patch note we've seen so far that mentions changing hunter DRs.
---
Alliance is more favorable for casters in general, while horde is melee-oriented. 
---
The most desirable raid spec is hybrid 0/31/20 build, and semi-hardcore and better guilds will use it instead of full shadow.
---
My plan on launch day : installing the game, buying groceries for a week, reading comments about how it's impossible to play due to the fact there's too many people on starting zones.
---
2 days after launch day : playing for 10 days straight.
---
For what is r1 blizzard good for?
---
Part 3 is somewhat true but when that someone is an international corporation who only care about exploiting people for money I don't have any qualms robbing them blind.
---
Being an altoholic in my early wow days years ago gave me some of those fondest nostalgia memories. Jumping between the factions playing all the races and classes more than once cuz i could never decide. The fun though was the fresh experience of the zones, quests and people.
---
I was around 12 years old when i first started playing. Lich King had just released if i remember correctly. I remember in my town where i live there was this store that was going to be open at midnight from 00:00 to 00:30 just to sell some copies at the release date. My english wasn't that good then though so i struggled with the quests.
---
Those were the days.
---
If wow classic was a drug i would very likely OD on it.
---
I took 9 days off, but i will start playing 2 days after official launch
---
nice plan. what a motivation to get to 60 !
---
People AoE-grinded in vanilla. So if it is a faithful representation you can still AoE crocs etc.
---
Wait with honor
---
Wrong. They moved the release date around retail release schedule. Dropping Classic within +-1 week of mythic Eternal Palace would be a disaster.
---
This was even tested with beta closing, Blizzard intentionally brought the hype down in the last weeks and only promoted 8.2.
---
Everything since beta was announced until 27.8. has been and will be a business strategy test by Blizzard.
---
I can understand it but still sucks.
---
Keyword, had. Will be a lot different in 2019.
---
The neckbeards of old are now the minimum expected player. Anything less is laughable in the eyes of a true vanilla player..
---
Thats nice. How does it work?
---
and then they can finally play the game
---
Warlock tanking was hilarious. I had one of the highest NR scores in my guild and sometimes they let me tank Huhuran with searing pain.
---
PSA: Career = Class
---
Show me the patch notes that says Scatter and Trap are supposed to share DR.
---
39 seemed like the sweet spot for rogues if you're interested in hemo stunlocks or dagger burst.

No it wasnt.

I dotn have to recreate something for it to be false.

What? Can you please show me where its stated it was a bug?

---
Overall, mage is the better class. It's just the best class in vanilla and there's no two ways about it. In PvP, mages are excellent in all areas. Strong 1v1, critically important for group PvP, second best flag carriers, great burst, great mobility, great AoE, great mana management, great CC, great control, etc. They aren't *the best* at every single thing, but they're basically excellent at everything.
---
Warlocks are really good in PvP as well. Fear is seriously powerful when it doesn't get countered by some ability, it's pretty much the only type of CC in the game that's useful both to remove someone from a fight and to keep them disabled while killing them. They have great sustain and can be very tanky with Soul Link, even though SL is a bit overrated. DPS can be high and they're alright in group PvP but not as necessary as mages. Pets are very powerful as well and it's kinda hard for most classes to kill a pet.
---
Unfortunately, warlocks have a lot more weaknesses than mages. They're vulnerable to rogues and warriors, they have essentially no mobility whatsoever, and fear is countered by way more things than any other form of CC. Once a melee is sitting on you, it's nearly impossible to get away. Can't remove debuffs except with Felhunter dispel so you just have to sit through the full duration of anything that can't be devoured.
---
And of course soul shards are always an issue in extended PvP sessions. You don't get that many opportunities to make new ones in BGs so you end up having to either not use stuff like Healthstone and Shadowburn or you have to devote a bunch of your time to souldraining dying people when you could have been doing much more useful things instead.

My bad, I thought it was the freezing trap and not the frost one, that's why I was confused about the stealth thing
---
I think people need to let the utility meme go. Nobody brings anyone to a group for their utility, it's an added bonus but you still have to contribute just as much as everyone else to the dps

You can reset dungeons by inviting a friend to group, promoting them to leader, logging out and then having them reset the dungeon while you're offline.
---
It's slightly more involved than on private servers but achieves the same result.
---
The person making up random shit will get a reputation far quicker than a person people know from a decent guild who no one otherwise has problems with.
---
Legen..... Wait for it... Dary.

Better professions. Individual bonuses for having a profession, more useful recipes.

"WRONG!". Missing out on 5% crit when your entire class is built around crit is beyond stupid. Paladins get mana back from their crits, 5% crit is one of the most important talents in the entire tree. The points you are waisting elsewhere doesn't improve your healing one bit
---
I think they got arcane perfect in WotLK. Spamming 50k/missile instant casts was so much fun. Fire mages hated their “spec” was inferior. They’d say anything to make arcane mages sound bad, but in raid, during encounters, you couldn’t beat a properly played arcane mage.
---
Conversely, in PvP, arcane mages were useless.
---
You dont have to, but why dont you?
---
For competitive pvp mages are generally better. A team of frost mages can totally wreck a bg by delaying the other team. I still have nightmares of playing pre-made AB against the best mages on the server playing together on the other side.
---
I agree that the patch notes aren't very clear, only mentioning "Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns.". However, this in combination with the blue-post in the OP saying the interaction is working as intended confirms that it isn't a bug, but an intentional change.
---
Blizzard says its working as intended, youre saying its a bug; youre the one that has to prove it is a bug or it was stated that it is, as you made the claim that it is.
---
Tier 1 isn't far off truefaith, tier 2 replaces it once you have enough pieces. So it does last a good while but it's a heavy investment.
---
Moonkins can proc weapons in form, it is considered a humanoid form. This is also why in classic you're able to interact with mailboxes, use potions, bank/trade in moonkin form but not in bear or cat. Hand of Rag can proc in moonkin form and the spell power does scale the fireball, proc rate is abysmal on both hand of edward the odd and hand of ragnaros, but there are some funny scenarios that can be had with it obviously.
---
Most mobs and bosses in Naxxramas are undead so keep that caveat in mind. It's not fully representative of ret performance in other raids because they can't use exorcism or holy wrath for damage. Even then the DPS isn't really close when you compare to other classes...
---
I was a young try hard hardcore raider in vanilla that litterally planned my real life after my guilds raid shedule lol.
---
I can't wait to just take my time levelling and working on my gear one dungeon or raid at a time.
---
Don't rush to 60. The game is both broad and deep. Take the time to work on primary and secondary professions, engage in pvp, explore the world, and make friends.
---
Yes that is true for Dragonslayer. DM and ZG have no CD afaik. But because of that cooldown (isn't it 6 hours?) top guilds will get their buff in the night/morning and then logout until the raid. And yes, serverwide coordinating will be key for the other guilds. 
---
Nevertheless you won't down Ragnaros even with all those buffs and 25 players in MC equip. You will have 2-3 Tanks and ~ 10-12 healers (yes that´s a lot of heal but you need it because of the gear level). So you will 10-13 DPS. This is below half of the dps you normally have.
---
PvP servers &lt;3. True war, no rules.
---
Ret.  Unless you have live stats i can't believe that a ret pally can do comparable dps to a mage. They just don't have the skillset to put out that much.
---
but hey i could be wrong.
---
My guild cleared all the way up to Geddon with 25 men, and some of those players were terrible.

40 days til area 51?
---
It is gonna be the release of the century to many of us old timers who are tired of modern industry practices like lootboxes etc
---
Many guilds on private servers that also server firsted things (coalition/aq40/Anathema) had moonkins. Without world buffs having a moonkin with 4 locks even prior to AQ40 is worth more (assuming he is playing optimally) by a decent chunk than having a 5th warlock or a mage in the group. It's with world buffs and BWL BiS on the warlocks that said moonkin + his aura is less than adding another warlock. This all changes again in AQ40 with putting a moonkin in the mage ignite group, which again makes him more useful than adding another mage. They are bottom of the barrel in bad hands, and they are just barely viable when performing optimally.

Warriors are going to rape hunters. They can charge through your traps, and if u can scatter/trap, you will alread be hamstringed, and with the DR on trap/scatter, you aint getting far at all before they break out and mortal strike you from 10 yards away that you have wobbled too in the short trap time.

Where does this leave Soul Link? The description in the talent tree says that it: "Lasts as long as the demon is active." Can Soul Link be dispelled from the Warlock, or was it only dispelled from his pet on private servers, meaning that on Classic it won't be dispellable at all?
---
You can't have every single spec be a must have. Important sure, but must have (or so important that it really reduces your chances a lot when you not got one) means, every raid group needs backup for those specs. But you can only ever take one, because there are so many different specs you need to take. Thats just a nightmare for creating a workable lineup (especially if you reduce raid sizes).
---
Thank you for making WoW a hostile Workplace. I don't care since I will be walking around dying 1v1 since I will level Warrior as my first character. And Also, you can't gank what you can't kill. Human right here.
---
I'll go at 60. And be playing holy paladin. Good luck.
---
60 versions of earlier 5-man is more or less zones adapting to your level or heroicish. Lvl shadowfang keep is more a thing of BFA, it doesn't fit the WoW classic narrative
---
Eh, the crit from the aura is only about 100dps for the group, not enough to close the gap.
---
If shadders are similar to a guild bank...why not similar to LFD? You can toggle the graphics btw...you can't toggle a guild bank. Or LFD. "We start with 16 debuffs, so why not a guild bank?". Well, on the same logic someone else could say "We start with 16 debuffs, so why not dual-spec?".
---
You can't draw a line...because the moment you went OVER it, you are open to other QoLs.
---
Apples and oranges.
---
A guild bank will make bag space irrelevant. A guild bank will give access to more than one guy, increasing the chances for ninja looting the bank.
---
As for player interaction, what is more interaction : dealing with the Guild Banker personally, which is a player...or dealing with the guild bank, which is a game feature?
---
Do we have the detailled explanation on how were working world buff during Vanilla ?
---
You got a couple of hours to spend for me trying to get you down? :D
---
I had better internet 20 years ago than I do now. 
---
In the next couple of months it'll be upgraded to be about the same as I had 15 years ago.
---
Wasnt 1.10 March and TBC January?
---
When did it change?
---
And if you are a douchebag min/maxer, you'll kick the warlock after summoning and pick the mage anyways, because the wl has done its job.
---
Stupid, but some people will ruin everything for a minimal gain.
---
Talking about mounts, but I have a vague memory of Mechanostriders. That they could only be used by Gnomes and no-one else? Is this a false memory or is it correct?
---
Are you seriously comparing numbers of paladins in average joe raids, most of whom aren't even primarily ret, to the numbers of speedrunning elite fury warriors? 
---
Those numbers are not comparable. Taking numbers out of context like this is big problem. Do you seriously believe on private servers there are 30 ret paladins mains raiding Naxx to fill this list up with representative numbers? For every single raiding ret paladin, you'll easily find 200 fury warriors. The sample size of ret paladin dps in Naxx period is so small that you have more fury warriors going into naxx fully jacked up trying to do a speedrun than Ret paladins. Many of those top 30 paladins there are primarily healers who just dpsed once or twice for the fun of it. When looking at those paladin numbers only mourtaghs spelladin logs and Zarrok as well as Almondbutter represent the top end of dps. For the warrior logs, every single of those 30 logs represents the top end.
---
Just look at the fight times. The shortest fight on the paladin list is 142 seconds, most are between 200-300 seconds. On the warrior list, the longest fight is 156 seconds with most of them being between 100-130sec. 
---
The overall raid dps of those warrior raids is basically twice as high as that of the paladin raids. Those raids cannot be compared, as one are speedruns and others are normal raids. It's just a simple fact, that you'll get 6-10 fury warriors in each speed run group, while you can be lucky to get 1 ret paladin every 10 normal raids. 
---
If you want numbers, that make sense to compare look at the fury dps numbers on those paladin raids, not raids, which run under a completely different premise. On the Zarrok(750 dps) Raid furies are between 900 and 1100 dps. 600-700dps on the hurin (620dps) raid, 1000-1300 on the almondbutter (802 dps) raid with an outlier at 1550. Theloras (540dps) has furies dealing 650-700dps. Sedric (508 dps) has furies at 600-900dps. Mesias (400dps) has all furies at 650. This quite consistently puts ret 60-80% dps of a fury warrior within their raid.
---
Yes, fury warriors can reach 1500-1800dps. If you give them every buff under the sun and build the raid around maximizing their dps and they are excellent players, so they can get the maximum out of it. But most of them won't. Most of them will be between 800 and 1200, likely even a bit lower than that.
---
You farm DM in any spec at 60.
---
The level cap increase isn't something that made retail worse necessarily, but lfg, lfr,.. did. The problem with increase level cap is the gear and previous content that becomes worthless. While lfg, lfd, decreases your social interaction with the people you play with in one world. It makes sense that one would stand in a big market square shouting " looking for 2 more to help me kill this witch" rather then being open in the world queue up and then get a message that pops up hey we found someone for you..
---
completely besides the point. The CoC issue is not about reach, it's about camera angels and strafing. You can stand right infront of someone but strafing and camera position can still have you miss the person.
---
Btw, CoC is behaving like it does on retail, not classic. They can reference their 1.12. client all they want, i dont buy it. You used to be able to strafe CoC without issue back then, but on the beta it's a nightmare to use.
---
I believe the extra mana regen for humans is about 1 mana every 2 sec at 300 spirit this is not a huge thing but it will alow you to cast a couple more spells in a bossfight
---
You could test classes on a private server. I would say if a class doesn't feel fun after 20 levels it's not the class for you. Sure the gameplay changes at higher levels but you can get an idea still.
---
I have played on a couple of private servers and glad I did. Would probably have went for mage otherwise. Leveled one up to about level 20 and found it boring compared to my favorite classes warlock/druid/warrior and hunter.
---
/r/iamverybadass
---
username checks out
---
Amazing
---
During leveling no-one is main speccing tank or heals, but they'll be tanking and healing your dungeons. What do you propose they roll need on?
---
It would. But the range on nost core and beta are the same. Even if this video doesn't show it perfectly.
---
don't walk backwards, strafe.
---
Polymorph rank 5 lasted 50 seconds which is a massive massive step up from the ten seconds max polymorph you had in burning crusade.
---
I'll book a day off haha
---
What is the impact?
---
It’s definitely a minority, don’t worry about it. Majority of people will play casually maybe between 1-3 hours in the evening after work. Possibly longer on the weekend on average
---
Arcane missiles doesn't put the caster in combat, what on earth! It is a damaging ability, why would it not engage combat? Can we please have the same for aimed shot, that would be great.
---
And poison in classic is not a reagent? You dont need to have them with you all the time? Like 6 stacks or so?
---
You might be able to go enhancement in a raid as well. There was a really cool guide on enhancement support shamans a few weeks ago. The jist of it is playing with nightfall and focusing on totem twisting for the melee group.
---
Post naxx content? yea its called TBC the infinitely superior version of the game.
---
Only gripe is water totem quest kind of sucks cuz it's kind of out of the way, but you've got ghost wolf by then atleast.
---
Since you say it was from a 2011-2013 server I'd be more inclined to believe the server had some things not tuned correctly or the druid tank was not gearing correctly. Both pserver scripting and the druid tank meta have advanced considerably since then. I can't see any major problems with healer mana or tank survivability on recent videos of private server bear tanks on patchwerk.
---
I've been saying it for years now, but you need some kinda fusion between TBC and Vanilla where you take TBC class and encounter design, and mix it with Vanilla's world and non linear dungeon design. In my eyes, it would be the perfect WoW.
---
This whole sub is like that. We've used to have somewhat decent threads every now and then but the past 3 months it's 100% bullshit spam and memes. Actually, now that I think about it, let me unsub...
---
I do not recall. It’s been 10+ years since I saw it. I just remember a Tauren that ran around hacking ppl to pieces. I never saw he died during that ~5 min video.
---
Whats a semi hardcore player? Do you like buy flasks but never use them?
---
I kinda get shooter games since you’re losing the match if you get killed by stream sniping but for an open world, mmorpg it just doesn’t feel as actionable for a suspension/ban for some reason, idk why. Nothing is truly lost, maybe a mob you were killing or maybe a fishing spot but that’s just nothing compared to losing an entire match because someone is essentially screen peeking. I honestly highly doubt it’s a bannable offense, if anything you’ll get a suspension from the streamer’s subs spammin report on you.
---
Leveling with enchanting is pretty fun. Last private server I made a spreadsheet for which mobs had a chance to drop certain enchants( so not worldwide drops but area and mob specific). Then I just grinded those areas as I leveled. If you do so you will have the enchants drop eventually.
---
I don't think the exact patch is known because they never documented the change or fix. It was sometime between 2.0 and 2.4 though.
---
Blizzard says a lot of shit and they make mistakes aswell. Doesn't mean shit.
---
Just play the fucking game. Why it is so hard for you people.
---
Cool, have a nice day.
---
Im excited for all of the t3 high warlords to carry me in vanilla. :)
---
Focus addons are impossible with post 2.0 API.
---
Wow, it really seems you want to bash ret paladins for no reason.
---
I compare average paladins to average warriors. Those warriors in the pala raids are average warriors. Those paladins in the top 10 are average paladins.
---
The best paladins are Mourtagh, Zarrok and Almondbutter. Not a single one of the others are. For warriors every single of those top 30 logs are top tier warriors. So you accuse me of wanting to skew the results towards ret, while you compare top tier warriors to average paladin, who in part are primarily healers, and call that comparing the best warriors to the best paladins. Ridiculous. I'd call that skewing the results towards warriors.
---
I did concede, that top end for paladin is around 1000dps, wheras for warriors it's 1600-1800, so quite a lot higher. But again, what a class can do at the top end is not relevant to 99% of players.
---
When I played on pserver there were no guilds beyond MC that actively took too many hunters. Those were the guilds that barely cleared MC. You might be right, it's not necessary, but people enjoy maximizing raid efficiency. And it's not very motivating to play your best when the raid comp isn't the best either. So it was pretty hard to find a good guild as a hunter. Even semicasual guilds understand that.
---
-It's not shorter.
---
-It looks shorter.
---
Pick one
---
Impossible? Seems farfetched until you put some reasoning behind that..
---
I think it got implemented while the russians had the nost core. There was some discussion about it at the time. But I'm not 100% on this.
---
Their toolkit is amazing for PvP.
---
You can survive and escape almost every situation and provide tremendous support for your team with heals and peels.
---
Very fun in PvP.
---
For 5-man-dungeons I highly recommend getting a second armor-set for tanking and having someone else heal. You'll find groups much easier as a tank and it's a nice change of pace. As a pure resto, you'll feel quite gimped doing it, though. If you like tanking consider a hybrid-spec.
---
Of course you can also heal in 5-mans but without stuff like fade and a regular resurrection-spell it's a bit painful. If the groups are good, it is not a problem though. There's no issue with the healing-output and mana if you should fear such a thing. But rolling on cloth-gear will be very common. Especially while leveling. If you restrict yourself to leather, you'd gimp yourself tremendously.
---
For farming I also recommend specific cat-gear. Overall, having different gear-sets is something you'll have to get used to. An add-on like "Outfitter" is almost mandatory for a druid.
---
Raid healing is probably the most boring aspect for resto-druid or any healer. Except ZG, which is actually quite engaging as a druid as you often CC multiple targets with Hibernate and roots.
---
Edit above :)
---
You usually go for affliction for leveling, you can go into demo, but demons are weak on the beta, thats why pure affliction is probably better. 
---
For PvE the best spec is DS/Ruin, the alternative being SM/Ruin, which is good for PvP too.
---
For PvP its either SM/Ruin or Nightfall/Conflag, Soul Link is only good for duels.
---
I recommend the warlock class discord.
---
https://discord.gg/qNNddUq
---
It is the same distance. It seems shorter because of how the world gets rendered differently. The same thing that made people claim that they ran faster on the classic beta. Is it that difficult?
---
Well, my first hard lesson was that when you are deciding if an armor piece is an upgrade or not, the most important factor is not, in fact, the armor value on the item.
---
I would advise them to use the search function
---
I wonder if activating that 3 day subscription gift blizz gave would enable you to play the stress test
---
If you're min maxing orc is better for both but your skills will be the biggest deciding factor.
---
Blizzard do not have dedicsted hardware for their servers. They rent servers from huge datacenters.
---
If you're out of mana then you're probably shifting too many times and not using the 5 sec rule often enough.
---
You should spend the entire fight in a form then after the fight is over shift out and squeeze all the healing in a small window then shift back to engage the next mob, letting your mana regen in the process.
---
If you're dying it could be due to many things, either you're fighting higher lvl mobs , or pulling more than you can handle. Generally speaking you should be able to handle 2 mobs of your level at the same time so long as you use bear and you can even handle 3 if you pre hot yourself before engaging.
---
Repost
---
How do I put it. You can't cast on custom targets, aside from the ones Blizzard allows. That means that you can use target=party1 for example or target=Viliger to target a specific person. Creating focus addon at most will allow you to put a new frame on UI that will track that target but you can't cast on that target via macros, since there is nothing you can add to target. It's the same reason Decursive stopped being one button decurse addon and instead became a custom frame that allows you to target people under curse and decurse them manually.
---
I'm curious what kind of system you wouldn't reduce to a "builder spender" model. Personally, I feel like resource systems are sufficiently diversified. More diversity wouldn't necessarily make the gameplay more engaging.
---
That's not true. There's also ramp up styles and burst styles. As well as combo points styles and flatline.
---
Nerf from what all hunters have been used to the last 4-5 years, yes :)
---
Both races are great for PvP... I'm more doubtful about the class, though. :o
---
I know it works out with great gear and in a group-setting with healers. But fresh at 60 without coordination I found warrior to be by far the most frustrating of all the classes I PvPed with.
---
Generally speaking orcs are better but for a warrior I would say gnome.
---
Stuns aren't your problem as a warrior. It's those damn roots and slows.
---
That's a lot of damage!
---
What classes are best to PvP with in their respective Tier-Sets?
---
&gt;	In a rarely seen manoeuvre, this poster gets sexism and racism into their very first sentence! Wow! Surely this will be an insightful and mature post.
---
??? i stopped reading after you assumed that a (factual and sourced) description of what was actually said by WoW developers is sexist and racist simply for *mentioning* sex and race.
---
In order
---
Alliance:
---
Not Warlock or Druid.
---
- Reasoning: Locks are bad anyway until naxx and then 3-4th dps. So you suck most of Vanilla and all the undead soft counter you in pvp. As you have paladin for ST and priest healers for aoe druids healers aren't as wanted. Also no one needs feral or bala for anything maybe 1-2. Druids are more wanted on Alliance than Horde (as Resto).
---
Play Warrior, Paladin, Mage, and Priest. 
---
- Reasoning: Warriors for dps, tanks, and pvp. 3-4 (even a 5th) Holy Paladins ina  raid is nice, and best defensive healer in pvp. Mage best range dps. Priest are needed for Aoe healing in raids, and offensive dispels in pvp.
---
----
---
Horde:
---
Not Priest or Druid.
---
- Reasoning:  Druids are the same as above (not needed, lack of benefit from WF make them even less attractive as feral) and the number of Resto shamans you want means you really don't want more than 1 or 2 Resto druids even. Very unwanted on Horde. Priest, while still wanted to for dispels in pve and pvp, are in less demand do to the number of Resto shamans you want. Best pvp healer for horde so benefit here. Its not that they are unwanted, but compared to Alliance they are less wanted in raids.
---
Play Shaman, Warrior, Mage, Rogue.
---
- Reasoning: Shamans, you want 7 in a raid, min of 6.  As such very in demand class. Warrior even better on horde as WF is nice. Mage still the best range dps. Rogue, WF also helps these guys be a bit better.
---
there is no leeway when you backpedal, that is why you cant see it in real vanilla videos
---
But your ”it wus a bug” means a lot then?
---
Bullshit. Healers are just as good gold farmers as anyone else. Enchanting, herb, mining and devilsaur farming can be a good income already in phase 1. 2 man farm DM:E jump runs can depending on the market get you somewhere between 60 and 80 g/hr. You can boost low level groups through strat liv with a tank buddy for the reserve on righteous orbs aswell which is great too.
---
&gt;being usefull in a group, being mobile, control effect, AOE, good in pvp and mostly, being fun.
---
mage ;-)
---
I am so incredibly torn between hunter. I'm gonna do both pvp and pve and both seem fun in both aspects.. help me decide plsss
---
Please provide said footage that clearly contradicts what Blizzard has confirmed to work as intended after checking with an actual 1.12 client.
---
Rp walk up to him and kill him with an auto attack, as a mage.
---
Lots of ways to make gold without ever touching mobs, and all healers except for Paladins (which I can‘t comment on because I‘m completely unfamiliar with them) have an easy time killing things, too.
---
patch 1.10 changed many items in brd, lbrs and in general. The new version of the items will be in classic from the start and they are very much worth getting for a new level 60.
---
2 examples:
---
[https://itemization.info/item/11623](https://itemization.info/item/11623) and [https://itemization.info/item/13178](https://itemization.info/item/13178)
---
Yea, I think it's roughly 8-9% total avoidance increase, which is definitely not insignificant. That's why I added the caveat of dps being higher if not limited by tps.
---
That being said, usually it's the start of the boss fights where you're at the highest risk of pulling threat - after the initial threat is established it's mostly smooth sailing. Good dps already watched the threat meters for the opener when the parry chance was much lower, so realistically it shouldn't change that much except the bad openers happen more frequently. 
---
On horde it will be very important to watch for your tank's opener because the discrepancy between you getting a WF hit while the tank gets double parried is so massive that you will just need to wait for him to establish threat in case of bad rng (obviously I'm talking about bosses post-MC where they stop being tauntable). Another option for horde could be to just drop tranquil air on pull before swapping to WF if your players cannot look at the threat meters. I think alliance will be mostly unaffected by these changes excluding the guilds with the most minmax dps.
---
Well. Thats one of my reserved toon names decided! Thsnks OP. :)
---
If it seems boring at first, stick with it. At least get to 20 and do the first dungeon.
---
To bad the trick requires you to be a full party.
---
You're forgetting that there is no support role in this game, you're either damage or heal. You're wrong about your class choice not being important, classes are good in different niches, otherwise there wouldn't be such a thing as a dungeon or raid meta. Even pure damage specs excel in different situations, some are better in single target, others in 2 or 3 target cleave, others in 3+ target multi dotting. There is no single class or spec that has a monopoly for being "the" damage spec and therefore being entitled to dealing more damage across the board.
---
This is HOT FIRE
---
Thank you. On repeat till 60.
---
If you don't care so much about early raid dps then wlock sounds like the class for you. Excellent in group aswell as 1v1 pvp. Mages are a little bit stronger in pve but worse in solo pvp(imo having played a mage).
---
Fury warrior..
---
both are bad, go mage instead
---
Play a hunter or a mage.
---
&gt;What would those fury warrior numbers look like if all of their windfury hits were attributed to the shaman? 
---
You'd still only bring one shaman for 4 warriors to buff them. Do you think people would suddenly think shamans do good dps and stack enh or something?
---
I could gold farm on my paladin with either AoE in DME or pick herbs pretty easy, had my epic mount in no time although it's a bit cheaper for pala
---
Our "internal &gt;test clientz&lt;" behaves 》the same way《.
---
Is no proof. Some dude further up in the thread already put some weight in his argument with an actual video.
---
Why wouldnt you auction them all would be more profit
---
And with stronger in pve mean more dps. Warlocks bring a lot of utility which still makes them very sought after.
---
For a druid, I like enchanting for the (BoP) armor trinket. [https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811)
---
So i want to play shaman for the OPness it is as resto in raids. but i NEVER want to level one. Mana is always an issue, you have to run from shit all the time. it doesn't kill fast, i hate it.  Ghost wolf is really nice.
---
Go druid man, it's only bad in 5 man because of no ress(only combat ress) but if you're pro you will never wipe anyways ;)
---
 I have played a couple of warlock on private servers but never leveled one up past like level 28 or something. So far from an expert. Will roll an alliance warlock in classic. For raiding and PvP 'm just going to copy cookiecutter builds. For leveling I will do my own thing. 
---
 Seems like at the moment there is a lot of talk about leveling without Voidwalker. Have seen it recommended to go for 3/3 improved imp and later respec to draintanking with a succubus at level 24 when you have 5/5 Fel Concentration. 
---
 I'm not going that route however. Will start with 3/5 improved corruption into 2/2 healthstone 3/5 Demonic Embrace( early on 2/2 healthstone should give more hp than 2 more points in embrace would have), 3/3 Voidwalker. Then back to afflicition for 2/5 suppression, 2/2 drain soul and go from there. 
---
 Will respec to succubus draintanking eventually but probably in like mid 30:s. It's just a pain to get succubus early as an alliance lock on a PvP server. Also I find leveling with Voidwalker very fun even if it's not going to be amazing at holding aggro. Downside to going to leveling route however will be spending gold on voidwalker grimoires. You get all past skill levels if you buy a max rank grimoire so best to buy at 60.
---
If by wpvp you mean levelling Druid sounds good. Not much fun trying to tank people at 69 though once people get geared.
---
Gnome mage maybe ?
---
don't worry about epic mount too much. it's not as important as you might think and there are alot of options to make money for healers. herbalism is solid, you get gold just from running dungeons and you can always team up with a warrior and farm DM:E. Strat living is also quite popular to farm for gold because of the orbs.
---
Not at the start since the amount of skins will be insanely high and nobody will be buying them.
---
That was fixed a few weeks ago. The problem was leeway wasn’t working for aoe spells but it was working for melee. That was fixed so mage aoe should work as long as you are moving before you cast nova to gain the additional range.
---
0 profit as its time consuming and time is money, instead of skin all the way to 40 you could be lvl 41 or 42 by then, the real money come from white  items from mobs, higher lvl mobs drops higher value loot
---
I don't think you'll be able to sell leather for more than vendor price at fresh server start. Majority of players will take Skinning. I assume market will be flooded with leathers.
---
Go look for the mage tricks video, it shows mob melee range quite often when he's moving, then compare it to beta footage of people trying to aoe farm.
---
Both the mage tricks and beta footage shows exactly how it was, and how it is now, for the players themselves.
---
They have the old client that says melee leeway was set to that distance, but whether it's ping or PC performance, or servers being better, something happened to make the range smaller in practice back then.
---
doesnt that make it the exception that proves the rule?
---
Probably rogue hunter or warlock
---
No, just no. Expose weakness is not a great pvp set bonus, and the others from t2 are straight trash in pvp. If the rogue has kingsfall, then its only fair to compare that to hunter having nerubian slavemaker. T3 is way way stronger in pvp than t2. You gain a shitload of damage and stamina. T1 multi dmg set bonus is good, but in no way even close to enough to justify using it over t3. You are way, way off.
---
Ghost Wolf is 40%, it just has a 3 sec long cast time (1 sec with talent), as it's disadvantage for getting it so early.
---
also damn near immunity to dot spells once you get grounding totem, as long as they don't have a direct damage component.
---
And one of the best and most overlooked features....
---
a extremely low level (4+, before you even leave the starter area) ranged interupt with a trivially short cooldown, that also hits pretty hard (if using your level's max rank).
---
Makes killing enemies that can heal or use strong spells pretty much trivial as you can basically shut them down completely. Also gets a strong hostile dispel.
---
Can also remove poisons and diseases (and even gets a totem that does it automatically for you for the same cost as casting the single target version, for vs enemies that spam poison or disease).
---
That too, though enchanting seems kinda expensive to level and maintain.
---
You must be one of the 80% of redditors who haven't played the game in the last decade and only come here to complain, otherwise you would know that damage specs are differing very much in throughput across the varying content types. It is for that reason why guilds stacked shadow priests and warlocks in the last raid, and balance druids in the current raid.
---
Which professions as a pvp priest
---
There will be casual players in classic. There are very few casual players on pservers.
---
Engineering.
---
a max rank non DR'd freezing trap has a 20 second duration, (26 talented) ~15 seconds in pvp with heartbeat resists. The DR halves its tooltip duration, it doesn't take into account heartbeat resists. So a max rank trap that is DR'd by scatter will last 10 seconds, or ~13 seconds if you specced 2/2 clever traps. vs a non DR'd trap that'd last ~15 seconds regardless if you'd be clever traps specced or not. It's not actually the end of the world.
---
No no what I mean is, is the item you loot which has a triangular appearance actually a reference to the triforce? I understand all of the other references but the icon itself looks sort of nothing like a triforce piece, so it feels like a stretch despite it being inside of a quest that's referencing LoZ.
---
On every private server until level 40 the skin you can get is worth less on AH than vendor selling. Early on especially, nobody is going to be buying the skins since the people who will have the most money will be the dudes skinning and speed leveling. Most will take just skinning and rush vending all skins.
---
Feral Druid. Top versatility, can tank or dps 5mans, heal in a pinch, great buffs.
---
The issue is they didn't design encounters which promote diversity. Why bother with having a diverse tool set when stacking 13 fury warriors will down the boss in 40 seconds?
---
Either you never played TBC and Wrath or you forgot everything about it and just parrot what other people say. Either way, stop it.
---
Yeah although having a pet is cool, I think i prefer not having one and just managing my own character
---
Why? Hunter is fun and one of the most distinctive classes in the game. New players are welcome to play hunters.
---
Mage is a reactive class
---
Warrior, warrior, and warrior. 
---
In vanilla druids are the worst end game class with their only real use being Mark of the Wild and flag running.
---
I mean they are also good at running. So 1 buff and running.
---
Druids are the corner stone of stealth runs... but i mean who cares. Fine no one will play with us.. we will play with ourselves.
---
In pvp, leveling .... everything just find any healer and the warrior turns into an death machine. 
---
I do love leveling druids as they are fun, but until TBC i wouldn't touch them.
---
It's just that before resilience raiders had a huge gear advantage over PvP players. They'd like to maintain said advantage instead of fighting on equal terms.
---
Which is funny because almost every class still used raid items in their BiS PvP set even after resilience. It's just a moderate advantage in TBC instead of the free win they had in vanilla.
---
I also think Skinning+LW is good on a druid, because:
---
1. You're a really good grinder with cat/bear+hots.
---
2. You get extra benefit from LW, since you need both dps and healing gear.
---
But at the same time, as you say, Herbalism is also good due to being able to gather while shifted. Still, Alchemy, while an overall great profession, bothers me with druid's mechanic of having to shift out of form in order to use consumables. 
---
Lastly, Enchanting is great cause of the trinket, but also for druid it's a bit easier to maintain, since you're a decent grinder and I think it suits the class thematically. 
---
Maybe going skinning+LW while leveling and later dropping Skinning for Enchanting? Or going straight up Herb+Enchanting?
---
Bro that's my favorite but have to go horde and their races looks like shit as mage
---
While Druids lack snares, they have insane mobility (30% speed in cat, 40% in travel form) so it’s not like things can run away easily from them.
---
Had this happen to me a few months back on ND :/
---
Okay great! Let me know if you're interested. Our Discord is set up and were already in the initial stagees of planning
---
Those things are meaningless without context.
---
This has nothing to do with ret. In general all those graphs don't mean anything since the sample size is so small and there are no equal(ish) sample size between the classes. Nothing about gear. Nothing about the server. I mean cmon. Just further emphasize how all this offspecs hate is out of place and probably very innacurate.
---
Anyway, some offspec players will always be ahead of some other pure spec players in the damage meters, because we all play differently, and are all geared differently, and this won't change in Classic.
---
Unless you are a elite / speedrunning guild, just bother about filling your 40 man raid with no assholes / people you can make friends with. Gonna be tough enough.
---
If you want some nostalgia search youtube for "pat warrior pvp"
---
That sound apropriate. Ragnaros and maybe even Domo could be hard though
---
Thank you for your advices, I think I will go for a mage but still hesitating a bit with the Warlock because of all the ultilities it can bring... :-) I think mage provide a bit more mobility with the blink which will be very important for me in the end
---
gl being stuck in MC while tryharding as hard as possible LMAO
---
Thank a lot for you insight!
---
I’d say it’s still impossible to beat a decent mage even as a gnome warrior.  It’s not like mages have a limited amount of snares.  If you escape artist out of one, you’ll just be snares again immediately.
---
Yes this is what sucks the most in retail to me, it really started in wotlk with every class getting an interrupt and a gap closer. Every spec also received a buff/debuff for raids and the bring the player crap was uttered for th first time.
---
Classes being different is just more fun. I used to hate the rock paper scissors pvp in vanilla to some extent just as much as I hated grinding for things. But now? I miss it. After playing on private servers I quickly realized that the retail alternative is so much worse and is just so so boring. Balance is probably better, but is the game more fun because of it? I say no. Where i used to get frustrated that a warlock was difficult just because he was a warlock I now rather get excited if I do manage to beat him and sorta "oh well it's a warlock, can't do much about it" if I lose.
---
I see what you mean, now you got me wondering too.
---
Don't look up a damn thing before you start! 
---
Log in, discover and learn as you play. Look stuff up as questions come up. Enjoy the experience.
---
OK, but how about #nochangesexceptformeltedicecreamandpeaches? :P
---
Tauren shaman is probably the best option anyway -- you can do some good combos with war stop into a heal or lighting.
---
For the warrior -- I think it doesn't make a big enough difference that you need to worry about it. It's really important to play the character that you want to play -- you spend so much time on it. And undead warrior is not terrible -- you have an extra fear break, and cannibalize is good while you're soloing.
---
For talents, on the warrior side, I'd go for sweeping strikes (i.e. I'd level as arms, unless you want to respec), since that works well when you're fighting multiple monsters. You can't really fight multiple monsters as a solo warrior, but in a duo you could. Windfury is the main synergy on the shaman side, but you'd get it regardless of the spec. I think that people usually say to level shamans as enhancement, so you can regen mana while you're attacking with melee and have less downtime. (as opposed to elemental, where you're casting lightning bolts and using your mana the whole time.) But again, it matters most that you're playing something you want to play. If she really wants to spam lightning bolts then go for it.
---
Not my video.
---
I'm stuck between Orc Warlock and Orc/UD Rogue.
---
I like Warlock because DoTs feel so evil. I started playing when TBC was released, every fight I had with a Warlock, even if I won, I'd just sit and wait for the DoTs to fiNish me. 
---
Not to mention fear, and the multiple uses for pets, making skill ceiling quite high. 
---
PvE wise, it is a ranged dps class so I feel like I could enjoy dungeons and raids more as I can actually see and have a good view of the raid rather than being squished up against a boss.
---
Not to mention soulstones and summoning.
---
Rogue on the other hand, if you have ever played any elder scrolls games then you know that pretty much everyone always ends up becoming a stealthed Archer ... Stealth is a lot of fun, you can pick your fights, sneak pass places, escape fights too. Lock picking. Poisons. I guess my major concern is gearing up and BiS, I may have a lot of competition.
---
I am 99% undead priest. But there is that 1% of me that wants to roll a tauren shaman. Definitely going to heal. Big focus on pvp.
---
Zerking isn't helpful for shadow. 
---
In raids all healers are in a higher demand on alliance (Horde needs to stack Resto shamans). Fear ward is OP. Stoneform is OP. Shadowgaurd is op for pvp, farming, and leveling (not raids).
---
Humans are the worst priest class in the game. +10-15 Spirit Wow. how about all that shit dwarves get? 
---
What about shadowmeld (the ability to drink/eat stealthed on a 10 sec CD, out of combat.)
---
Count me in
---
I believe that the question is unanswerable with current information. We would have to be able to reference data such as xp/h for both approaches while adjusting for variables such as launch day tourists, layering, rng, deaths etc.
---
Level a priest first and then level a shaman in phase 2. :O
---
Yeah i guess is impossible to macro the event where actually just skip where you want to throw the grenade, just wanted to be sure. Did hardcore players use them in PVE back in Vanilla or they are useless as a melee?
---
I will be filling out my full roster of characters and getting them all to level 5 and then assigning them professions.  Dedicated bank/AH mule will be parked near the mail box.
---
Then I will start playing my main and funneling mats to my production alts.  I am in no rush to 60 and plan to take my sweet time with the game this time around.
---
It wouldn't be very useful, one of the benefits of grenades is that they incapacite the target for a few seconds, which allows you to regen energy.
---
Another benefit is to use it as a gap closer or to interrupt spells.
---
You can probably use a [@player] macro to use them on your feet, since it is an item you can probably use grenade first then some ability in a macro.
---
This might work, or might not work, idk I haven't tested it.
---
/use [@player] Iron Grenade
---
/cast Sinister Strike
---
Sure and what's your point?
---
That he dies is a problem of himself and his raid, not of the spec.
---
Why would you even want that? You want to use grenades situationally and not as a part of your PvE rotation. At higher levels iron grenades would lower your dps on singletarget.
---
Anyway.. I don't think its possible either way.
---
This guy never heard of optical illusions.
---
RPGs don't have to be a snooze fest with no boss mechanics. In fact, most RPGs I've played, even old school turn based RPGs, incorporated unique mechanics into boss fights. That's fun and interesting. Tank-and-spank is actually closer to hack-and-slash than RPGs.
---
I mean if you're looking at flat crit to dps value you are correct, but that ~100 dps doesn't really take into account the additional gain from more imp shadow bolt stacks, or ignites. Moonkins completely optimizing dark runes/mana pots actually did fairly decent dps when you add the aura to it. That's in no means saying they are the equivalent to a well played top tier dps class, but an extremely optimized and well played moonkin is going to be more competitive than people give them credit for. Consistently beating hunters in AQ40+ while providing an additional battle rez and juicing up the ignites. 
---
TLDR moonkin is shit but not as shit as you'd think, bad rep because generally only terrible players would play a sub-optimal spec.
---
Well if we've got 6 phases and the are presumably releasing them over a 2 year span that is 24/6 = 4 months per phase. This sounds like a really long time per phase, but it's just speculating and I dont think theyve confirmed anything
---
Sapper charges are useful in pve for melee and they don't have be placed, they exploded from around your body.
---
I mean yeah you'll go oom faster than someone with the extra 5% crit.  Will that matter on the content?  Too many variables to say, but clearly either your mana bar or your HPS will suffer vs someone with higher crit, especially at a time where there's less crit on gear than later on.
---
Mage also brings a lot to the table between food and drink, portals and the most reliable dungeon CCs. If I hadn‘t played Mage in Classic already, I‘d be playing it now.
---
Its Vurtne
---
A hybrid class with utility other than damage does the lowest dps
---
surprisedpikachu.jpg
---
TIL, thanks!
---
this whole post is an absolute dumpster fire, comments and all
---
Nope.  You begin your spirit mana regen 5 seconds after you last spent mana.  Only your HP spirit regen is tied to combat.
---
My point is guilds cleared everything in vanilla without having all this knowledge we did about how certain classes would scale. Frankly 40 man raids weren't as hard as they got later in the game. 
---
Almost every spec is viable in classic for raiding, maybe not optimal, but viable.
---
gnome in the case of warrior.
---
another video to try to stop the zerg rolling warrior, becouse they know the competition for gear is going to be hard, good try, but warrior is already the most chosen class on every Pserver alive, in classic with leeway...... expect even more
---
When was the ! and ? minimap markers added for quests? Only thing I cant remember not being there
---
Gotta carry around a stack of FAPs at all times
---
Sharding is a seperate function to layering and it would surprise me if they don't plan to use it for release. 
---
Sharding is what will make the starting zones manageable. But I want them super busy still, absolutely.
---
implying that alliance can't avoid fears and that fear is a primarily ability of warriors?!
---
So the profits have been covered well already,  so I'll just leave a reminder that despite taking almost no time at all solo leveling, but if you're waiting for a group to loot before you skin it'll cut into chain pulls like nobody's business.
---
This person is provided actual evidence... why don't you dig up a raid log where the ret pally is doing top dps?
---
Hint: you won't find it
---
No, that's the reason why you can't directly target custom frames. Only via clicks.
---
&gt; No they are not. They are the best dps paladins on legacyplayers.
---
They aren't even dps paladins for the most part! Is it so hard to understand, that there only a hadnful (i.e. 4-6) ret paladin mains total over all those private servers who raid Naxx? You can't call a healer, who slaps on dps gear he picked up for a raid or two, call him dps paladin and compare him to warriors, who live the class. The stigma against ret is there on private servers and there is pretty much no oppurtunity for rets to play those top raids.
---
&gt; For spelladins, don't forget Mourtagh isn't really play standard retribution
---
What's that supposed to mean? Spelladin is a retribution build just like standard AP. The point about to pend is, that Mourtagh rperesents to pend for spelladin and Almondbutter represents top end for AP ret. If the top 30 of paladin logs had any reasonable number of entires, the top 30 would be between 700 and 1200 dps, not between 400 and 600 with a few outliers.
---
&gt; so, when you say 600 to 1000-1200 you are comparing 75% of a top end RET paladin damage with 55-66% of a top end warrior damage.
---
You can't equalize that. 
---
* Warriors scale better with more buffs and gear than ret paladins. That's the whole damn reason warriors are better. In prebis molten core raids with no world buffs, the two classes are pretty much equal. So, when world buffs are missing, which will be the case in most average raids, warriors lose more dps than paladins.
---
* Warriors are a more skill-intensive spec than paladins. You need to press more buttons and manage your rage to maximize dps. Paladin is easier as you only need to time your mana usage and judgement right to maximize the dps. Thus, a warrior played by an average player loses more dps than a paladin played by an average player.
---
&gt;You'll be fighting with Druids for gear up to 40, then any mail with int on it is all yours.
---
this is not retail, there is int on every piece of hunter gear.
---
I get that the resolution is different or whatever but I was basing my comment on the character's distance from the road.
---
Don't play ret
---
Thanks - I'll check out the discord!
---
Wanding is used to finish off mobs generally
---
Thanks for the details!
---
Sadly I agree.  They don't even seem to be trying to change some of the legion core things
---
Good idea. 
---
I'm personally doing Orc Warlock (female) for the looks and animations but also the 30% stun resist is very good in PvP when rogue is our big weakness. 
---
Undead Rogue as I believe being feared is our biggest weakness there.
---
You are doing god's work.  Keep it up
---
Dwarf is still quite good for pvp, especially against other priests or in organized pvp.
---
Well, i've done the math before, even giving the scenario generous leeway, such as saying the warlocks had 1000 dps, yet even then when you calculate out the 3% crit added onto their existing crit, it is only barely 100dps or so, depending on how much they had already. 
---
Now, if you are telling me boomies do close to 90% of a naxx geared locks dmg, i'll have to disagree with you.
---
The ins and out of powershifting and the 5SR sound like other good go to's if she's not a chicken fan or it seems to land flat.
---
&gt; It is for that reason why guilds stacked shadow priests and warlocks in the last raid, and balance druids in the current raid. If classes were all the same there wouldn't be a meta, so much so that people complain about not being invited to dungeons or raids because their class/spec is garbage. Make up your fucking minds.
---
Did they stack shadow priests, warlocks, and balance druids because of their superior utility, or because the devs accidentally gave them more DPS than the other specs?
---
The devs trying to make DPS and utility equalized across classes/specs is what turned WoW from an RPG to an action game.  The fact that they can't perfectly balance DPS is all the more reason for them to lean on utility as a way to make sure every raid has a mix of specs.
---
Explains why I can't tell the difference between you and an unfunny joke.
---
AM doesn't put you in combat at all on the beta. Not even when the missiles hit. As seen [here](https://www.twitch.tv/kraunx/clip/ShySpotlessKumquatPraiseIt)
---
So I don't think blizzard is referring to putting you in combat before the missile hit, but more AM not putting you in combat at all. Which doesn't seem to be correct according to the clip I posted.
---
I hope he keeps posting it
---
I'm giving launch a few days to settle down. Hopefully by that weekend, itll be more satisfactory. Of course, I'll be leveling since launch, just not as hardcore as I'm going to be when I take a day off work for a 3 day weekend. I'm going to play world of warcraft for at least 20 hours a day.
---
&gt; DM solo farming?????? Dude, who the hell is doing it? 1% out of 1% of the player base? You get MORE GOLD if you run Strat/Scholo in 3 men (T2 geared Warrior, Mage and Priest).
---
You should google it. DM has a lot of routes that can be solo or duoed for a crapton of gold. DM E lashers for mages and priests, can be done at lvl 55+. This isn't some hardcore "only 1% can do it" shit. Any google search including [your class] and [gold farming] will give you a DM route you can run for more gold/hr than you'd make farming in the open world.
---
I farmed my epic mount on a pserver on a holy priest in about 4 real life days. Just doing DM E lasher runs. Pretty sure the gold/hr on that was nerfed compared to blizzlike on that server, too.
---
Maybe that’s why my old 60 Troll Rogue did surprising well on dmg meters when I actually had no idea what I was doing in raids.
---
I started playing at early TBC launch with 13 years, many years I played almost 100 hours per week (no regrets). 
---
The years passes by along with the expansions, playing less and less on each one, until I quit when WoD came out (started to work). I purchased the other expansions and played some weeks but the time and feelings wasn't the same.
---
Now with 25 (no major responsabilities than work,a career and a girlfriend) can't wait for the launch... 
---
Maybe for the firsts weeks it would be a high amount of hours of playing, just for the hype. After that, think that I would be a casual player and an active user outside the game.
---
Now, I hope to recover the days of glory and joy that WoW gave me, and maybe having some new friends due my poor social life.
---
Best of all... You don't need many hours of playing to reach that.
---
Outside of sheer early progression I don't see any reason why someone else would absolutely need an innervate. Priests and Druids are extremely self sustaining, and assuming you're alliance you'd never innervate a paladin anyways. Better yet have the other resto druid innervate you so you don't have to shift out and get a dps loss, then innervate him later on if they even need it.
---
So he had almost 500 dps when he popped a sapper on aoe packs but that spiralled down quickly when the fight got longer?
---
Come on now...
---
Ok... now show a paladin who puts in the effort like Mog's and his dps logs.
---
You could try /use [@player] Iron Grenade
---
They did it in TBC and it was fine. An easy way to buff hybrid dps is to give them sustain and party buffs, by the way. Which is what they did in TBC.
---
Tell that to the raid leader rhe boomy begged to let him into the raid, that he is keeping his innervate. I mean, i agree that classes should be able to use their own cds to fix their problems such as mana but stigma is a bitch.
---
If you're considering druid, don't just spam swipe, maul is an incredibly strong threat ability. Also, going caster and rooting is part of what it means to play druid, you use all your forms irrespective of if you play feral or resto
---
On a private server I've done 20 man MC with pre-bis geared DPS and tanks and well geared healers, with full world buffs. Its very possible, Ragnaros isn't a problem at all, the main issue is Garr. You need a lot of tanks or a lot of warlocks and with so few dps its quite challenging.
---
You can level it to 265 for the trinket which is much cheaper, then drop it.
---
Spontaneously I would say 39 Warrior for WW or 49 Shaman for Windfury, cause deleting people in below a second is fun. For a while.
---
I'll make sure to be on a different layer! Ha!
---
Boss design was insanely better. Some heroic dungeons bosses were more fun/challenging than vanilla raid bosses. Karazhan boss design was overall extremely good, and it only got better from there.
---
Get off the subreddit and play whatever appeals to you
---
Exorcism really doesn't matter as much as you think. It's 345 mana for on average 900 dmg. In an ideal fight, that's roughly 60-70dps extra.
---
But in most fights this mana also comes out of the mana you use for consecration normally, which is 565 mana for roughly 700 dmg. So say, you do 5 exorcisms (1725 mana, 4500 dmg) instead of 3 consecrations (1695 mana, 2100 dmg) and that leaves you with only 2400 extra dmg over 75sec or ~30-35dps.
---
On top of that, Naxx has nearly no good gear for ret paladins apart from the weapons, while the pure dps classes compeltely explode in dmg potential due to how good the gear.
---
For me, it's more a question of how big should that gap be? I think, for example, a rogue should do 10-20% more dmg than a feral cat druid. That's essentially the price the druid has to pay for all the utility he brings to the party. I've heard some people say that rogues were as high as Double what a druid could do which, assuming that's true, is probably too much.
---
Tanking is another special case to me. I think different tanks should excel at different things. Paldins should have the best magic protectin because they're protected by the gods n stuff. Druids should have the best threat generation because it's a freaking bear screaming in your face. Death Knights should be the overall hardest to kill because they're undead revenants. Warriors should be some happy medium of all these things and should feel the most mobile because they rely solely on their athletic ability.
---

---
All classes specs are "viable". This term tends to be more applicable when it comes to tanks because not being viable leads to the definite death of your raid. (more strict)
---
Speaking of tanks, as someone who is known for pushing the limits of WoW, I can tell you all classes with the exception of Mages can tank raids.
---
Carry a spirit set and you wont have drink much at all. Just keep the 5 s rule in mind. Mages are imo boring in pve but (kinda) fun in PvP. Gold isnt a big deal really. Mages have some brain dead farms but id say going for crafting professions is the best gold vs effort.
---
No cHANgeS
---
everytime they are ready? while in AH? while crafting? while waiting for the party at dungeon entrance? 
---
no fear anymore mate, came here to help and made the math for you
---
cooldown = 1 minunute, if you play 8 hours per day means 480 grenades per session, 3360 per week , 14,400 grenades per month AND 172.800 grenades per year
---
you heard it right mate one hundred thousand seventy-two thousand eight hundred grenades
---
A nerf from 95% of vanilla, all of burning crusade as it was rectified almost immediately, and all private servers.
---
Very few people actually play resto druid in comparison to the other classes, and even fewer actually play it well enough to do good healing and maintain faerie fire. Despite raids only taking 2-3, any even slightly decent resto druid has absolutely no problem finding a raid - its probably one of the top classes for getting into raid and getting gear easily.
---
At the very end of the game, yeah. They also don't "top" charts, they beat mages, they're still behind warriors.
---
Am I the only one here who can see this is a bad idea? People in this subreddit are enabling you instead of giving you good advice
---
Why even raid in that guild in that scenario, plenty of easy going guilds and friends to make that wouldn't give a shit. If a high end guild is even bringing in a moonkin to begin with, it's because they most likely have casters in the office core that care about their own dps more than they care about some innervate. And on the same page any high end guild is going to expect their healers to have consumes and be able to sustain mana (which is extremely easy to do) without an extra innervate on 1 person.
---
I guess? It wasn't routine in real vanilla by any means, the way it seems to be on some pirate servers, but a lot of that is probably the cooldown on boss head buffs. They were certainly aware of the possibility, and obviously did it sometimes when it mattered.
---
The fact is wasn't routine probably has a lot to do with the cooldowns on boss heads and limited supply of black lotus.
---
Half my guild used to auto pilot / AFK drunk as hell in vent through molten core. We definitely brought meme specs to BWL. Not that I’m disagreeing with you necessarily I was just sort of stunned by the “those that go past mc, and those that don’t” comment. Most progressing guilds I know barely had to start trying until after princess huhuran in AQ.
---
Layering is only on phase 1. I hope.
---
There is a Google spreadsheet link on that page that shows every piece of leather gear and it's values for mitigation/avoidance/etc
---
But yes, the one I directly linked is for mitigation, which at that point in your raid progression is likely all you need to worry about.  By the time your raid is decked out enough to where you're really worried about maximizing threat over everything else, I'd assume your raiders are experienced enough to understand why a tank gets a particular ring or trinket over a DPS on the first drop.
---
Since then I've been searching high and low for a game that would give me that feeling like Vanilla WoW. Some kind of did, but never entirely.
---
It's like I've been travelling all over the world for the past 13 years. The conclusion after all that? There's nowhere like home.
---
I'm coming home.
---
Yeah dont be [sorry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwSR1SHYZRI&amp;t=290s)
---
Every time a vanilla video is found not showing leeway working like the beta, everyone finds elaborate ways to discredit it.  Could maybe someone instead find a single clip of it working like it does in the beta?  Just one?
---
Fair enough, though I'd argue those were vanilla itself rather than just warts on vanilla.
---
I'm not disagreeing with your point, but my point still stands that you have to convince ur raid, which is heavily influenced by the stigma of meme specs, so either be rl friends with the higher ups or have good luck i guess.
---
When did anyone ever say ret paladins do top dps?
---
I mean, you can look at "this persons evidence" (i.e. esfands armory link posted by dr4ikus), look on the right side and see that he can very well do much more than the 200 dps the OP is suggesting.
---
Spriests are more welcomed also depending on the number of rogues (cuz shad oil).
---
Dude, ret paladins aren't viable.
---
They have never been viable and will never be viable. 
---
They are not even in the realm of viability for the most casual guilds even. 
---
Ret paladins will not get into pve guilds, even casual ones. Just stop. Trying to rationalize it such as in the post above just reminds me of the guy in Office Space interviewing for his own job. 
---
And it is perfectly okay because not every spec has to be viable. Give it a rest.
---
Resto are good at farming, they can aoe effectively with hurricane, barkskin and bear form. The DM lasher farm is nice easy money that can be done in Tier 1 gear.
---
The exact spots shown in both videos don't match up. That's correct. But the video trying to show that it's the same range also isn't quite at max range for whatever reason. You can go to ratchet on any nost core realm and test it. If your target is a female orc you can reach the road with the back of your foot and still melee the target while strafing.
---
Bad rogues yes, but from my experience seeing rogues duel 1v1 a warrior on the instant 60 pserver, the really skilled rogues somehow manage to beat warriors fairly easily. I was kinda baffled at first too, asking "Wtf how is this possible, he is a warrior, he is supposed to beat you!" But the warrior was like, nah bro, he stunlocks me and its over. Granted, rogue used all his cooldowns to win, but he won everytime because he had a specific rotation he used vs warrior. I think it was a combination of stuns, bleeds, vanish, repeat, blind, repeat, vanish, repeat, blind, kill. It wasnt a fast win, but the rogue did manage to win with still having 25% health in the end. And everytime, he would win.
---
Warrior is SUPPOSED to be the counter class to rogues, master of arms right? Mainly because of overpower being OP vs dodge classes. But at a high skill cap, rogues turn the tables around and it isnt as easy. However, hunters can beat rogues 99% of the time if played right. There is nothing they can do vs a scatter or frost trap unless they got skull of impending doom. Of which the rogue used on me and managed to get a win or two, but i still gave him a run for his money the next few duels after realizing what he was doing so i played slightly differently and managed to get a kite off and he was done for. Keep in mind he was in full blue set, gear from blackrock depths. 
---
Yes,  warriors out dps rogues, but rogues are compensated with stunlocks, silences, and other crowd control utilities for pvp which make them unique. All warriors have is damage, and they just rely on damage to win any battle. Hence why they are good for pve but not pvp. 
---
I think it comes down to the player if we are talking strictly pvp. The easiest class for warriors should be melee, but the only melee classes are hybrid healers or have some sort of range. And the only other pure melee is a rogue, which is the only one they are realistically meant to counter.

Aight, still ahead of mages which OP claimed they aren't. I've always heard locks definitely top them, hence my question mark at first :p what about rogues then?
---
I raided most of Legion (Heroic and a few mythics) on ConsolePort, once you get used to it, it's way easier in my opinion, I could just sit back, relax and play away from the desk. Can't wait for ConsolePort on Classic.
---
Never said they were anywhere close to a naxx geared lock or mage. They don't come 90% close to anything. But we're talking everything being optimal here, in a real case scenario most guilds all have some bad players, an optimized equally geared moonkin can easily beat players with poor cooldown management, or players that don't use full consumeables, or the multitudes of people who haven't played classic since classic, or new players in general. I expect people to be pugging content like ZG/Ony/MC quite frequently, and you'll have bad poorly geared players getting murdered on the charts by an owl lord that knows what he's doing.
---
A properly played moonkin is good enough to beat shit players, people that aren't getting world buffs, and hunters in AQ40+.

I've seen several good resto druids come just behind the top priest in healing meters and HPS just from skilled healing touch use at the right times. One druid in the raid can also spec regrowth and blanket the raid in hots - a very high HPS spec. Paladin is almost certainly the lowest HPS healer.

Maybe watch the video instead of immediately commenting with your dumbass response.

That's how I'd categorize them with Arcane Mage and Deathknight as more unique approaches I'd say, unfortunately they did dumb down the DK runes some time ago.  
---
All in all I see 3 different systems, of which 2 play quite similarly.
---
They did try to spice things up with some special mechanics like orbs which can be generated while fighting that can be picked up to heal / gain back ressources or the shadowpriest insanity approach.
---
Ultimately I believe that adding so many classes after BC is the main culprit of the current gameplay state, coming up with something special seems quite difficult if you have to balance it around every other special case. Now they have 36 specializations in 12 classes which feel so similar to each other. 
---
Keeping the base 8 classes and expanding them down the road would have been better for everyone IMO.
---
It's dangerous to go alone! Take this. https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=1150
---
My shadow priest was actually probably the easiest class I ever leveled in WoW period. You could place swp on 3-4 mobs mindflay them all down and then move on. Sometimes you could even get ganked while doing that and still kill the person who ganked you while you were being chased by the tagged mobs.
---
pservers basically
---
Anyone that played vanilla almost never used blizzard to get rogues out of stealth
---
What classes synergize better while leveling, Mage/Shaman or Mage/Warlock?
---
I want some thoughts on the topic of duo leveling, wpvp, and the occasional dungeon run with a mage (my friend) and me (either a shaman or a warlock) and *what would work better together?* Lots to consider, including uptime, gear overlap, 5-mans, and valuable buffs/debuffs like curse of elements/improved scorch.
---
tyall
---
Yeah, I don't get the logic that keeping bugs is necessary when major changes like layering and loot trading are in the game. This feels more like "if it saves us money, it is a good change, if it doesn't then we look at the reference client" to me.
---
yeah I likely won't be doing much "serious" pvp in BGs although I was a fan of AV.
---
Back in vanilla I was a single nerd in school. Now I'm a single nerd with job. Nothing changed tbh.
---
It's not too difficult to get but one thing that caught me out was needing to make the runed copper rod which also requires a lesser essence. At first I didn't have the coin for the copper rod then the greens i made to get to lvl10 enchanting didn't give me a lesser magic essence so had to grind for some more.
---
The wand really does help but you need to make sure you've got enough money for copper rod which you might not have if you just bought new abilities and then make sure you've got 2 lesser magic essences which requires making a bunch of green cloth/leather gear.
---
If you also want to make the great wand then I think that requires level 70 enchanting? To get to that you'll be wanting lots of strange dust to enchant bracers and stuff and will require lots of greens to disenchant too. For those greens it might actually be easier farming for leather than cloth.
---
But being "only" viable means it's quite a big pain in the ass if you don't have a guild yet and you want to play with better than average players. That's something people should keep in mind imo.
---
Blizzard combat behaviour is not a bug. Arcane missiles is.
---
Balance sucked in both pve and PvP.
---
the font looks like disney
---
&gt;New macro conditions for “reticle” spells: @cursor and @player.
---
Were added in [7.1](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20335228/patch-notes-world-of-warcraft-7-1-return-to-karazhan) so if my understanding that classic is using the modern macro system those will probably work for it.
---
Well if you want to play easy content where your composition doesn't matter, normal is there waiting for you... or classic wow for that matter.
---
Besides, classes still have unique abilities, but not all encounters should be designed around all of them. Overall, guilds still want a large pool of classes going into a raid tier so they can optimize their roster for every encounter.
---
A 10 second buff while you have no idea what you are doing? You probably activated it at 100% HP and didn't line it up with anything else. I'd say the rest of your raid sucked as well.
---
There's a countdown on wow's official page, what more would anyone need?
---
[Ardent Custodian](https://itemization.info/item/868)
---
[Girdle of Golem Strength](https://itemization.info/item/9405)
---
These are the items that I am referring to. There is no one that can honestly recommend these if they have played a raid tank in any effective capacity.
---
In response to comment on Stalwart, there are belts that are extremely better than this one. Almost every guide recommends it for tanking, and it is a bad item. You can gain more benefit from using Brigam or Mastersmith. This guide misrepresents how beneficial +defense is for tanks and disregards almost every other stat.
---
Not so much "pvp while leveling" but mores so taking a break from leveling to go pvp for a while.  As an example, you can always go stir up the pot in STV and around 60 there was always Tarren Mill pvp happening.
---
Oh please! This is wow, of course people know lol. 
---
I’m kinda surprised that after all this time they haven’t squeezed more sc Easter eggs in to wow.
---
It means play the objective! Like, if you're doing the "capture the flag" battleground, you should focus on capturing or defending the flags. 
---
If you're playing the "hold the zones" battleground, you should be doing most of your fighting on the objective zones, etc.
---
Honestly no real clue, assuming battleshout on private servers aren't any good reference. But between battle/demo shouts, ret aura, fire shield, and later on reflection gear/consumes I think it should be ok, especially with salvation on the DPS. I'm conflicted about the warlock because he doesn't get a -threat talent until very late unlike the mages, but having only 3 classes in a 5 comp seems a little too "safe"
---
PvP was mostly shenanigan nonsense anyway. You could play almost anything as long as you were semi competent and grossly outgeared everyone which was rather easy as a raider in the original run of wow. No idea what it’s gonna be like this time though.
---
There's a countdown on wow's official page, why would you want to create/check another website?
---
It’s a stress test not a head start. Everyone starts out at level 1 on release.
---
I dont know who you have been listening to but as someone who has played mage on private servers i have never met another mage who don't have arctic reach, both for pve and pvp it's absolutely needed.
---
This is about the radius of the cone however not the range of the player to the coc.
---
On the beta you will not hit everyone within the animation cone (which you didn't for a long time through vanilla, until they actually fixed it) This is extremely stupid as you have no way of knowing while youre moving and strafing if your coc is actually going to hit. You need to stop up, make sure he is right infront of you (straight ahead) and within range ofcourse for you to hit them 100% of the time.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aySDzdCATc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aySDzdCATc) at 1:54 there is an example of this, only clip i could find rn
---
Another major coc bug is actually the bug he says next in this video, if a rogue vanishes and you coc him out right after the slow debuff does not get applied (even though you do it several seconds after the vanish occured) this is not even spell batching affecting it cus its a common bug on many priv servers too and im not sure why it happens or if it actually was a legit bug back in classic but it's beyond stupid that your spell just doesnt work for no reason.
---
I also compiled this list of gear for AoE tanking if you're interested:
---
AoE tank gear:
---
Electromagnetic Gigaflux Reactivator (Gnomeregan lvl)
---
Naglering
---
Skullflame shield -&gt; Force Reactive Disk
---
Razor Gauntlets
---
Cloak of Flames
---
Mark of the Chosen (Quest)
---
Toxic Revenger (Gnomeregan)
---
Ravager (SM - 2h)
---
I'll even doubly check it out! Cheers!
---
There are only 8 healer spots?
---
I'll be rolling a warrior even if 50% of the population is made out of warriors.
---
Im just the opposite, ive played priest so much (vanilla+expansions) that i thought if i rolled it again i would get bored very fast.
---
So this time im trying something new, to keep it fresh, see raids from another perspective.
---
Would you want it to show just the profession or also the recipe(s) that require it?
---
I liked TBC but I kind of want classic WoW to evolve on its own but with the specific mantra of sticking to the Vanilla philosophies.
---
They can add the classes we already have, balance the talent trees more, allow classes to be more race etc.
---
New content can use old assets but everything developed should adhere to the Vanilla way of thinking. The world should be big, no dungeon teleports, cool and meaningful items, no welfare epics, social interaction being a good thing, things taking time to do and so on and so forth.
---
I really think it would be the best way to make classic WoW a success longterm.
---
Ok. Find me some logs were he does "ok"
---
Go on
---
Priest: T1 &amp; T2 are okayish, lack armor and bit low on sta. T2.5 is excellent, high sta and armor, spelldmg and some hit, can be used as shadow too. T3 is good.  
---
Paladin: T1 &amp; T2 are decent, not exactly what you'd want statwise but beats wearing a dress in pvp. T2.5 is a ret set. T3 is godlike.  
---
Shaman: T1 is mostly a healing set. 5pc T2 is great and so is the T2.5 set. T3 is again a healing set.  
---
Druid: You'll want the 4pc pvp set in WSG, but in other BGs the tier sets work fine for healing. T2.5 is a feral set.  
---
Hunter, rogue, warlock: All tiers are great, useful set bonuses too  
---
Mage: T1 &amp; T2 maybe slightly behind warlocks, otherwise just as good.  
---
Warrior: T1, T2 &amp; T3 are tank sets and useless outside of AV. T2.5 is the only set you can use.
---
There is? Wot havent visited wow's website in a while
---
lol rly? it takes about 3secs to skin a mob, if you have to wait for respawn there is no time lost, and even if, you will get a mount as soon as you get 40, which saves you time in the end
---
and no not everybody knows how to get a mount at 40 without professions
---
I’m sure someone will eventually post back, but in the meantime you might be able to find the answer by checking older comments on wowhead,
---
I don't trust current Blizzard to make new content and not mess everything up.
---
So I'd prefer to move on to TBC and eventually Wrath, while keeping the classic servers going (copy characters, not transfer).
---
Option B would be fresh start classic server(s) if there is enough interest for it.
---
Or do both.
---
All of this is dependant on the success of classic and how many players there will be a few month after Naxx release.
---
Someone in the last 2 weeks posted a few screenshots from the book. Definitively looked worth buying for your purposes.
---
Where am I trying to justify the viability of ret paladins? My point is to stop mispresenting data to make rets look worse than they actually are. That includes the OPs ridiculous screenshots and Antanis attempt at comapring the top 30 logs as equal, when there aren't even close to 30 ret paladins on private servers.
---
It doesn't matter whatsoever whether ret is viable or not. But when people go out of their way to display ret dps as much worse than it actually is, I will speak up. Ret is weak enough as it is, there is zero reason to try to drive this home with wrong data.
---
&gt; Ret paladins will not get into pve guilds, even casual ones. 
---
You'll be surprised. I know of several, even semi-hardcore, guilds, with a ret paladin in their lineup for classic.
---
Hunter has a few keybinds??? I use almost 30 and I'm only level 37! Maybe I'm just going overkill?
---
Mage was suggested here, what do you think of that?
---
I would be mostly leveling with them to be honest, doubt we are going to get into raids seriously.
---
Where'd you get those pictures of me you stalker
---
Agree.  It's boring.
---
It's hard not to overheal against classes with much faster heals.  Remember people are coming from years of raiding and good healer UIs and their reflexes are really good.  Compounding this is the fact that there are fewer mechanics to respond to so as soon as a grid box lights up, a holy paladin spams that free Flash of Light.  Get used to canceling your heals or overhealing a lot.
---
Also, being a dungeon healer *sucks* as a resto druid.  Fights go like this:
---
* Tank pulls a 3+ mob pack and gets decked immediately and requires a big heal in the first 3-4 secs of the fight
---
* Your big heal pulls threat instantly
---
* You have to offtank and heal at the same time
---
Your lack of an out of combat res means there is zero room for error.  It puts the whole group on edge.  Every time I healed a 5 man I thought, "man I wish I had rolled a different healer."
---
I played mage in Vanilla and I'm fine with it.  You had to precisely lead your blizzards to AoE farm and you never used it to get rogues out of stealth(except in very niche circumstances) 
---
The only people upset are pserver players
---
&gt; I see a lot of bis or nearly bis gear, even from those who have poor results.
---
Uhuh. Would you kindly point those out? Not to mention, you can't even see the gear, they wore on the raid. Pretty much everybody in the lower half has a hodgepodge of dps gear from all raid tiers, they picked up somewhere and those that don't have some questionable items and miss 5/5 avengers.
---
&gt; It's not like they have the plague. People would bring dps palas to speed runs if they were viable.
---
What's your point? Of course ret paladins aren't viable for speedruns. So are hunters.
---
&gt; It's different, just look at Mourtagh's damage breakdown, the standard ret applying for a dps raid spot won't build that way.
---
Spelladin is pretty well explored now and pretty much every ret, who is seriously going to raid will consider it.
---
&gt; Except warriors actually do good dps and paladins don't. But yes, if you discount that they are pretty much equal.
---
You've never progress raided mc before, did you? Warriors suck early on. They barely generate rage, because they do so little dmg with white attacks. An unbuffed warrior attacking a boss does less dmg than an unbuffed ret paladin attacking that same boss. With buffs, it becomes equal to slightly ahead for the warrior. You also compeltely immerse yourself in the stigma. Ret paladins problem is not that they always do little dps, it's that they don't scale very well compared to the other classes. A warrior in mc does 250-400 dps. A warrior in Naxx does 800-1200. That's basically tripling their dps. A paladin in mc does 250-350 dps, a paladin in Naxx does 500-700. That's only double.
---
&gt; Sure, and still tops paladins by a mile.
---
&gt; And guess what? The warrior will still be on top.
---
No clue, where you are going with that. I never said a paladin would do more dmg than a warrior. This was about you equalizing an average ret paladin doing 75% of the top end dps and a warrior should do the same. The point is, that an average warrior only does 50-60% of the top end, because they lose more dps in average raids than paladins.
---
The lowest skill floor means hunter is the easiest to fuck up big time if you don’t know what you are doing. Not easy to play ok.
---
New timeline seems like a stretch, imo. It'd cost a lot more to pay people to work on new content when they can just rehash already existing content.
---
Lay it on me baby
---
Palli is perfect mate
---
Those numbers are terrible.  1 pally dps, #1745 overall
---
Dont listen to him. If you want to play mage competitively, it requires many spells, you want to use. Its one of the harder classes
---
I didnt feel Rogue like till the mid 30s. As Cheemytown said its class dependant.
---
I was a mount collector in Wrath, and used to make 25-man pugs for Sarth 3 drakes with the zerg strat, and boy oh boy it was fun topping the damage meters as an arcane mage! Not that it mattered at our gear level, but still.            
---
             
---
Got the drake after about 25 tries, very average, like myself.
---
Then this communication is your fault. You just got finished praising Druids in 5mans, and then you say this:
---
&gt;The only reason you should consider a warrior is if you plan on tanking in raids.
---
The wording of this, combined with what you say right before, implies you need a Warrior to tank in raids, and should stick to 5mans with a Druid.
---
Glad I pegged you wrong, but I was justified in doing so.
---
If you’ll enjoy it - play it.  Don’t pay attention to those polls because it’s a lot easier to say you will play a class in a poll than actually level one to 60.
---
Ah right.... although to be fair I wouldn't call myself a decent MMO playing and I'm not having issues in world PVP, can normally take on 2 guys my level if i get the jump on them. Seems to me like it's fairly easy to do OK with them.
---
When people say they are bad healers it's bullshit, druid healing in raids it's more of a support role than topping the meters, you are there to fill the gaps from the main healers when someone is not healed on time, you support people with your hots and innervate and bring to the raid one of the most important debuffs of the game, faerie fire.
---
Just an fyi, because you mentioned PvE also, that Trolls are the pick for that content on Horde. ~~Gnomes are universal though.~~
---
Not super relevant, but worth a mention.
---
Did you honestly expect the game to stay the same forever? Assuming it's a continued success, eventually people will run out of things to do and start quitting. To get them to sub back you need to push out new shit to do. Always been like this.
---
I really wish staysafe would just take that trash video down already. Everyone watches it and thinks they're gonna get exalted by level 40. Sad really.
---
I got it from this website:
---
https://www.warcrafttavern.com/news/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-level-60-in-wow-classic-an-objective-look/
---
&gt; Even if you play 40 hours per week it will still take you 3 months to reach level 60
---
MCP seems relatively easy to farm though.
---
It's based on how a certain pserver operated recently. I think.
---
With all this data about the population from pservers/beta: how (over)played will Rogues be in terms of their demand?
---
Iirc most of the pvp gear had very little spirit though. I remember even my mage having specific spirit gear for chain pull runs to switch in for Evocation etc to be able to keep up.
---
You cant even scratch me with your toothpicks. My thunderous hooves will crush you like the insect you are. Have fun getting through my 5% additional hp and my enormous defense value. I fart in thine general direction.
---
a double slap to the face for their tanks. Not only can they not hold the threat, they are also not needed in the first place.
---
That takes time, though. Would love being able to see it in-game.
---
I'm going to make a alliance hunter on a PVE server. I really want to be to be a dwarf but nightelf has better racials (and highest base agi in alliance). Please convince me to make a dwarf.
---
&gt; you will always wishing you were playing something else.
---
Amen.  That's exactly how I always felt.  You can't do anything better than someone else can.  Sucks the enjoyment out of the game.
---
They are heavily populated until like 40ish when people start expecting you to heal more often.
---
Rogue is 30+ once you get cheap shot and kidney it feels starts to feel good. Warrior as stated is like 30 is when you first start to feel like a warrior, 40 is when you will have the best feel for it. But i would say in general 30 is when most of the classes have most of their abilities. You will get a few more talent based abilities at 35/40 but for the most part 30 is a good judge if you will like it or not.
---
Ok, just go with the other plethora of options..........
---
I was 15 in 2004 in high school living at my parents. I sucked hard at wow was pretty much there to be a free kill. 
---
Now I’m 29 traveled the world and I’m coming back to live at home and no life it to finally be a winner for classic. Super excited For the horde!
---
Just saying that in pvp it is something to think about. In duel getting a fear -&gt; bandage + charge is a big advantage vs rogue and mage. As a gnome alliance they will simply wotf. 
---
Alliance do have less fear removing abilities.
---
Gold bids
---
I would not want to do it even if I had a group ready to go all the time. For a couple of reason. First one, you get no reputation. I plan to get stormwind exalted on a gnome and get a horse( will require cloth turn in as well but the quest rep will be big). Secondly it doesn't sound very much like an MMO experience being inside instances the whole way up to 60. I want to experience the world. It's fun questing around, team up with various people along the way, experiencing some world PvP. Basically just be a part of the world, even stuff like having to hide because of some ganking group or whatnot while frustrating at the time is still something that adds to the whole thing. Doing solely instance grinding also would probably burn me out I think.
---
They aren't terrible, they are completely adequate to beat the content.
---
Also the #1 pally dps is buggy. https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=769505 has better nubmers across the board, no idea why it shows Esfand as #1.
---
Soemtimes I feel, you people expect every fury warrior to rock 1500dps. Oh boy, you'll be in for a rude awakening.
---
Most efficient at overhealing you mean.  It's too slow.  You get heal sniped all the time and mana is not as much of an issue as it was when people didn't understand downranking.
---
Ill put that toothpick under Your tail you big walking cow.
---
Right ok haha, well I'm horde anyway so pally is out. Ty for the tip thou
---
Shadow priest
---
That's just not true, the most hardcore are going for week one or two MC clear
---
Granted those are the most insane but...
---
It can be done
---
You forgot the spk dude.
---
Ikr I hope all these dads will be rolling alliance :X
---
Yeah ok, that's a hyper simplistic way to "categorize" the specs. Fact is: retail specs are all more diverse than vanilla specs. That's a fact. You can argue against it as much as you want, but it's still a fact.
---
* Always logout in an Inn.  
---
   * This gets you rested experience which allows you to gain experience faster until it runs out. 
---
* Look into what class you want to play, then races that can play that class.
---
   * This method doesn't force you into the Alliance or Horde scenario but allows you to choose based on what class you want to be.
---
* You can ignore people using /ignore &lt;player&gt;
---
* The game gets much better the higher your level
---
* The game supports mods that add to the experience and make some things super convenient.
---
   * Prior examples would include:
---
      * Atlas/Atlasloot: Showed you the map of dungeons and allowed you to see what dropped form what boss.
---
      * QuestHelper: Showed you where to go for various quests. 
---
      * Gatherer: Shows you gathering nodes based on prior looted locations. Useful for mining/gathering
---
      * Auctioneer: Helped make the auction system a lot easier.
---
So you are saying that´s another thing private servers got wrong? The ride never ends.
---
Enjoy and keep in mind that your reputation can open a lot of doors and opportunities in classic.
---
Thanks, what do trolls get that make them with pick? Is it the attack speed buff? (cant remember the name)
---
Only if they were bad players. I certainly used it a lot. Pre-casting it right when you expected a vanish could really trip up a lot of rogues.
---
This is a pooor tinfoil. A better tinfoil would be they don't actually have a 1.12 reference client and they're making shit up as they go.
---
"I'll be standing in front of Stormwind for an hour while I watch a video and react to it. Please come by and give me gold." Asmongold in a nutshell.
---
Ask yourself this: if you are party leader looking to fill a 5th slot and you see someone in chat say "wowclassicplayer101 is ninjalooter pls dnt group w/ dem" and that person whispers you saying "I couldn't get aggro because he kept pulling mobs, so when I complained he kicked me from the group", which person would you think was more reasonable?
---
With shift you double your buttons.  Unbind S for PvP and use it as another ability.  That's 26 abilities and macros.  More than enough for all classes, especially since you don't need Arena macros.
---
I make my own groups so that when that warlock doesn't fall in line I can boot him. Likely he was watching his dps meters and not threat meters.
---
Dungeons are a team game. I have little patience for dps who don't cooperate.
---
Im serious, just play. Just. Play. Have fun. Dont try to go in with a competitive mindset like you need to do everything correctly, its a 15 year old game.
---
What are you talking about? Do you remember how easy dungeons were? Why rob people the chance to really experience them without ruining it with needless handholding?
---
It's what people asked for with #nochanges, nothing blind about it. If people advocated too hard, stby.
---
Moonkin has the highest DPS if you add battle-ressing a DPSer :)
---
There are a lot of arguments for and against each, but the playstyle is really different and as a result they play and feel very different in practice. You should try both on a pserver for a little bit and see which appeals more. 
---
If you want a comparison for an end game tanks perspective (who mt’s both) check out skarmtank’s man vs bear series of vids.

Give him a like and follow if you appreciate his channel. He’s a great resource imo. Not associated with him at all, just FYI.
---
You will feel a lot more comfortable and confident on a Druid while leveling than a warrior in both pve and pvp. You can pick your battles and set the pace in a way that warriors just can’t. You’ll also be able to farm easier. But there is more to the game than wpvp and farming and Druid is not a better class for everyone,
---
The average american spends over 20 hours a week watching TV. People who say they have 2h a week to play wow are either in the extreme of the bell curve, or they're just bad at time management.
---
The video was fun to watch, but really those are just unorganized BGs. When I led BGs as a warrior or had warriors, I would never be alone. At minimum I would have a paladin or other healer. 
---
The reason for this, well is this video. 
---
The warriors are the worst class to deal with. Again, this is coming from someone that only played BGs for the grind of ranks. I never cared about solo play in any form.
---
Thank you so much for your lengthy response! I appreciate that you took the time to explain. :)
---
I get where you're coming from and I think if Classic+ potential content became community voted, things could be pretty fun. The only thing I really want out of C+ content is draenei, anyway. ;P
---
&gt; So if you do care about class variety enough, you just need to play at a high enough level. It's that simple.
---
Usually an RPG has the classes feel different for all players, rather than just those playing at 'high enough level'.  That's a big part of why my original comment said that homogenization made Modern WoW into more of an action game than an RPG.
---
And I don't mean that as an offense.  It's one of the best action games that people can play.  But it's far from the D&amp;D-inspired RPG that it once was.  And as a fan of D&amp;D-like video games, that's a big loss.
---
&gt;  Pretty much everybody in the lower half has a hodgepodge of dps gear from all raid tiers
---
Most of them have 5/5 t2.5, MoM or Corrupted, good jewelry. And they still produce shit dps.
---
&gt; Spelladin is pretty well explored now and pretty much every ret, who is seriously going to raid will consider it.
---
Yet even those serious about raiding as ret aren't doing so. Except for 1. ONE.
---
&gt; They barely generate rage, because they do so little dmg with white attacks.
---
You have no idea what you are talking about, and bosses on private servers have much more armor than they should.
---
&gt; A warrior in mc does 250-400 dps.
---
You are about 40% short on the dps a Warrior can do in MC.
---
&gt; because they lose more dps in average raids than paladins.
---
You can't defend your point claiming people will suck at playing their classes. Warrior fury dps in classic isn't hard to play by any stretch of immagination.
---
I’m with you. I find it ridiculous that people think any bit of preparation means you’re not playing a game. Watch a YouTube video and beat games. Play to win, just like in life.
---
Played Vanilla back in the day with a Holy Paladin. Hated it, but knew I was in too deep to change. Want to avoid that this time around. Will have less playtime now (who doesn't), so want something that's more casual friendly. Love Tanking, Don't mind raid healing, Don't love being an unwanted class. Narrowed it down to three:
---
Druid - Would tank through dungeons, and heal through raids. They don't look very cool, but are easy to level, and seem to fit my needs
---
Warrior - Would take forever for me to level. I don't like how they world PVP. But! The payoff would be the ability to dps in raids and tank dungeons
---
Warlock - Kid me chose Paladin over Warlock. Always thought they looked cool, like juggling mobs while leveling. Worried about wasting time waiting for groups for dungeons and raids.
---
Any thoughts?
---
Second this. The development diary is packed full of secrets, screenshots, studio photos, stories and anecdotes about how wow game to be. Fantastic read
---
Least gear dependent? What? Druids have free less bag space than even warlocks if they want to do anything other than 1 task, and to do it well they need multiples sets of excellent gear.
---
sad but true (I'm going to roll a hunter...)
---
I remember going Shattered Halls heroic immediately after reaching level 70. We wiped for 3 hours and didn't even get to the first boss. It was glorious. We did Mechanar the next day, only wiped a few times, that was actually kind of a letdown by comparison.
---
How does that work? Why would you pay for loot in a group?
---
Was pretty set on Warlock, but then I was watching some Druid stuff and started getting the itch.  I really like the idea of being able to tank or heal dungeons while leveling, and I like the impact of being able to make big plays in group play by switching to bear to taunt a loose mob off the healers or battle rezzing the tank, or whatever.  I read the locks mostly spam shadow bolt in raid because of the dot limit on bosses, so that sounded kind of crappy.  But then I watched some Warlock pvp and I was like ugh I still want to play Lock.  What to do?
---
Its actually been a very exciting  psychology experiment.   
---
I did the private server test weeks ago with a friend and coulda posted the comparisons at any moment. But i went out to test if anybody who disagree would actually test it for themself. On 1 hand, you got information from a "godly" source, who tells you this is how it is. On the other hand, you got a scenario where you can actually do the test yourself in a matter of minutes.   I got into atleast 6-7 discussions in this timeframe, and all of them refused to do the test. I even offered 0.1 Btc to one guy, but he still refused to replicate the test. So yeah, people really dont want to admit their are wrong lol.
---
You should look into the Arcane Missiles bug before you center your complaints around it. You can't cast a full arcane missiles and walk away without entering combat, it simply doesn't put you in combat **until the first missile hits the target**. Unlike other spells like Frostbolt, which puts you in combat as soon as the projectile leaves your character.
---
Somebody didn’t watch the video
---
Can't. Dwarf would be the easy choice if you planned on PvP. But if you're set on PvE then NE is the winner. Unless you don't care about the agi and then dwarf is the way to go
---
That instance also feels like a real adventure, as for some reason groups do not always go for the final boss (or break up before that), there are quite a few quests and bosses to kill, and just generally takes some time to complete, whereas other endgame instances are just smaller. Looking forward to it!
---

This was my first exposure to WoW.  Watching that whole section on the pet whelps and Timmy's white kitten is my first WoW memory.  Not going to lie I'm really enjoying the huge amount of errors and that vintage G4 cringe.
---
Oh man didn't even consider using it with mouse wheel as well. Currently use that for Pet attack and retreat... Going to swap it with melee and ranged auto then use shift for the pet! Thank you!
---
np, i could have worded it better, have a good one m8
---
&gt;They chose to do it to save money.
---
What? They did it because Vanilla launch didn't have millions of players day one. #NoChange is impossible when external factors Blizzard can't control changes. If you really want #NoChange, wait 3 months after release before you start and play on the lowest population server.
---
It’s more about things like pet management and auto shot weaving kiting pulling... If you don’t have those concepts down especially for pvp you won’t be doing ok you will be garbage. 
---
Hunter got quite a few things to have down in order to start being acceptable. To excel is again a very different story
---
Leeway, trap and scatter on dr.. plethora of other bugs.
---
Why am I rolling a hunter again?
---
Don't prepare, but be ready to listen. And don't be afraid to ask. Yes, it's guaranteed someone will troll you, but others will help you.
---
Here's my plan...    
---
Horde.    
---
Main: Tauren feral-resto druid(for dungeon spamming and flag running)    
---
Alts: Tauren resto shaman(for pve and pvp healing), Tauren fury prot warrior(for more pve tanking), Orc sub rogue(for melee pvp) and finally an Undead frost mage(for pvp and aoe farming)        
---
I might change my mind about the race and/or spec of some alts that are obviously questionable choices on my part which is very typical of my playstyle. But yeah, I plan on being super friendly and helpful to my guild and the rest of the time unwinding in pvp. I am going to play a lot. I was planning on having a life irl but now I am planning on no-lifing hardcore in-game. It's going to be great =) I'm looking forward to meeting new people, it's hard to find people that have similar interests and actually want to meet new people irl but in classic it's just how you play the game. I was listening to Asmongold say that it was actually easier to teach someone about threat than it was to find a new tank before you could just press a button to get a new one. I love that about classic. We all love that about classic. We don't like interacting with other people but we like killing dragons and looting treasure so it's a necessary evil that actually turns into something valuable. Being able to articulate yourself in the moment to a stranger is my biggest problem irl and that's exactly what I'm going to practice come August 27th. I'm so excited!
---
I think I get the idea, thank you!
---
Thanks! That is an awesome answer! :)
---
I'm currently mostly torn between Priest and Mage with a slight consideration to Druid.
---
My biggest fear about playing Priest is that healing might get outscaled by DPS and become less and less useful in PvP as gear progresses.
---
Not at the same time, hence the flexibility via talents and gear being fun, which was his point.
---
I'm probably doing the same thing. And honestly the big guides for druid tanking stress that you shouldn't be main tanking progression bosses. I don't think most people with extensive druid knowledge are claiming you should be your guild's MT throughout progression.
---
\&gt;  It just doesn't feel like an immersive MMO world anymore. And that's a core problem that came with all the "convenience" features. 
---
Yes. I might add that the convoluted classic instances felt a lot more real than the later "corridor with monsters in it" design approach of later instances. Yes, you could get lost easily in BRD and in Sunken Temple. But then those felt like real places. In BRD, I was never sure if I'd really seen all of the bosses. That left an air of mystery about the place.  
---
Later, Blizzard decided that all content must be fully exploited by everyone - but that's not what makes a game good because it takes away the feeling that there is always more to explore.
---
Here's an example?
---
40 |  The Lost Supplies
---
---|---
---
38 | 25 Rep
---
46 | 20 Rep
---
49 |  5 Rep
---
51 | 3 Rep
---

---
I mean, while I generally agree with your point, I disagree that Ret will ever be ahead of anyone on the charts. A mage pressing frostbolt repeatedly and nothing else, less geared than a Ret pally, will do more dps than the best Rer pally on the server.
---
And if you still wanna roll Ret despite that, that's cool, but everyone should be aware that this is exactly what they're getting into.
---
There were some great deals yesterday on pre-built low-mid specs for laptops and desktops. If you have a budget in mind you can check Slickdeals "Hot Deals" forum*. 
---
*I'm required to tell you that you should build if it's a desktop. Still, some good deals regardless.
---
&gt;Alliance do have less fear removing abilities.
---
Do they really? A priest can prefear ward everyone on the whole damn team if you doing BGs'. 
---
Paladins can bubble out just like shamasn can use tremor (except you can't kill the bubble..), and who the fuck actually plays undead other than mages?
---
That would be one of those niche scenarios.  No good mage relied on blizzard for getting rogues out of stealth.  If they didn't anticipate the timing it came down to guessing the rogues movement and moving the right way with AE to get them out.
---
\&gt;  That expansion gutted this game's difficulty curve.   
---
Well, Wotlk Naxx was terrible, I agree. But Sartharion 3D (prior to Ulduar) was very hard and Ulduar is arguably one of the best instances ever. The hardmodes really held up well and where a lot more atmospheric than the later "normal&gt;heroic&gt;mythic" switches.
---
Classes undoubtedly feel different at any level of difficulty, it's just at high levels of difficulty where class choice matters competitively. But yes, most players don't play WoW for the roleplaying aspect, so it shouldn't be too anyone's surprise that the game isn't designed around that.
---
You is the mage
---
You're* :)
---
So close...so very very close.
---
That's just not remotely though though lol. At 40h a week, you'd be 60 within a month and a half if you're also training professions up.
---
I think I’m as confused about your goals as you are. You are planning to level multiple professions so you can get a bis trinket for a spec you don’t plan to main. So, clearly you’re interested in optimization yet you reject to follow through fully optimizing your toon for RP reasons? That just doesn’t make sense. Say your Druid uses the spirit of elude to infuse her creations with earth magic, thereby creating, for example, a dragonling in the image of ysera from clay, not nuts and bolts (dragonling trinket). 
---
If you aren’t going to be spending the majority of your time in bear form don’t bother with the trinket, There’s simply no need for it.
---
I get where you're coming from but good luck recruiting or gearing that many fury warriors.
---
Not they way speedleveling has been optimized these days. The record back in retail was 4 days 20 hours. It will probably be way less now, but let's say a hardcore leveler uses 5 days and 12 hours. That's 132 hours. Playing 40 hours a week, that is a little over 3 weeks.
---
The real hardcore people will take time off after launch, and probably play 16 hours a day.
---
The skinning of beasts is 60g. The vendor greys are much more. 1-40 questing ends up 60g less than just grinding, or 120g less than vendoring skins + grinding.
---
Mage can have few keybinds or they can have many. There's so much good stuff that you want to have keybound and have rank1 versions of. 
---
Hunter you can work fine with the about 20.
---
&gt;On top of that, Naxx has nearly no good gear for ret paladins apart from the weapons, while the pure dps classes completely explode in dmg potential due to how good the gear. This results in the gap being the biggest in Naxx, despite getting access to exorcism for many bosses.
---
Eh, isn't the grand crusader stuff BiS (leggings, belt &amp; legs)?
---
hunt for pawg
---
Yep. Worth a look. Happy tanking, my dude

It is not good game design to spend time creating talent trees and class concepts that don't work within the confines of the content you create for your players to experience.
---
A game designer would never set out to create a talent tree that they wouldn't expect people to use for it's intended purpose. That would be a deliberate waste of their time and the games resources.
---
And yet that was what a number of trees in Vanilla are. 
---
They're misses, not good design. Misses happen, its reality. But there is no need to romanticize them.
---
I'm just astonished we're fully accepting of TRADEABLE LOOT, layering and patchwork spell batching yet we autistically screech no changes to a guild bank.
---
The tradeable loot and layering systems are foundational changes to gameplay and classic, yet we can't have a guild bank.
---
Theres no slippery slope argument, Blizzard already pushed us down the slide.
---
well im out of school but have a full time job... that it still single so no worries about time commitments
---
Ah thank you.
---
Fix the bugs. Fix leeway and batching. It’s all dumb
---
&gt; No good mage relied on blizzard
---
What? It was a useful tool with unique functionality that nothing else in your toolkit could replace. Of course it was situational, most things are. But to not use it was simply to gimp yourself.
---
and easy to get in to dungeon groups just keep some healing gear in the bank :D
---
If geared the same, They will do the same damage. Each racial will barely make a difference if at all
---
I am really really hoping that ele/resto for shaman thing is true. I want to level up as enhance to get those filthy wf builds out of my head and swap to resto/ele around 50ish to start healing almost full time. 
---
I just want to be able to take care of myself when i'm gathering, and also put up a good fight and purge every buff ever.
---
2004-2006:  Single, living with parents, zero expenses.  I had endless time and resources.  I raided endlessly (any night the guild wanted to raid, I was there), and bought enough gold to allow me to do anything I wanted in-game.
---
2019:  Married, own a house, piss away all our money on vacations and eating out with friends.  I'll have much less time to play and won't be able to buy gold (at least not often) to finance my in-game lifestyle.  I plan to still raid, but I'll be limited to 1-2 nights per week.
---
Not noticeable. Just play what feels best based on Looks or Abilities.
---
Holding banana in way, popping rogues
---
Super hottie
---
Yes indeed this will be by far the most important information on classic! I’m also guessing some time early August they will give us server names so everyone can discuss and pick.
---
Every time I argue that on retail classes and specs play way more differently than on vanilla, people never seem to want to go down to the specifics. It's because you're wrong, and you know it.
---
&gt;Want to disprove it? Point out to me two retail specs that play more similarly than two vanilla specs. You won't be able to.
---
As a followup. Do you see any value in shadowmeld on a PVE server as a hunter? I'll be playing on a PVE roleplay server. So I'm torn between nelf and dwarf.
---
Level as elemental wearing a fast dagger with flametongue and a shield. Stack int/stam/str in that order. Fastest way.
---
No doubt about it, it's a very unique experience that new players should definitely get to experience at some point. 
---
Just don't want newcomers to be turned off by it, I'm hoping vanilla brings back just popping in trade chat and people you never know coming to your aid. That is very fun.
---
A line from "that's the world of warcraft that you play" that stuck with me is the druid
---
"you'll never be a rogue, always healing and crying about your class".
---
So by that logic, can we shamans get back our lost 50% ap bonus on WF, or maybe even our ability to chain WF procs into each other?
---
Hunters seem to have been spoiled with private servers getting "1.12" talent trees, but also progressive itemization which makes them stronger against caster lack of SP and early game version OP as Hell Pet stats.
---
If a good hunter can deal with leeway on low latency, then they have no need to be concerned. Its the bad ones that seem super vocal about this.
---
Wait..How does Arcane Missile not put the caster in combat? the moment you target a mob you are in combat.
---
Maybe this isnt the game for you.
---
I think it's about 3 dps difference.
---
8 agi = 16 ap = 1.14 dps increased, add in multi and aimshot and it's about 2, add crit and I'd say it's about 3.
---
Sure ya did. Nihlium, risen, death and taxes, fury, deus vox... none of them used ret or boomkins
---
Shaman will be so overplayed tho.
---
*Phil Swift intensifies*
---
Are you watching the same videos I am?
---
Is that how its suppose to be? that would be insane.
---
And i gave the best answer.. until now:
---
If you want that nonexisting addon, you can make it.
---
During the first few levels in their starting zones? Who cares, you'll leave them soon anyway, the speed of which depending mostly on how you select what quest to do when and on luck regarding spawns.
---
Later in the game? The difference is so minuscule that you will have a hard time *measuring* it, let alone *feel* it.
---
What *will* affect the effectiveness of your hunter, though, is how much fun you have playing it. If you like the char, chances are you play it more, get invested and become better at it. Play the race you like and enjoy, the rest will follow.
---
Professions for enh shaman pve? I cant decide, I'd like to feel rewarded for the amount of hours you have to put in professions.
---
The guy hates dungeons where you can get lost. Doesn't sound very RPG to me.
---
Throw shaman off tanks in there too.
---
Thank you for these words of wisdom! I'm 99% sure a dwarf it is. Zug-zug!
---
Shaman is nice to level, but it will be extremely populated( as popular as warrior) so be prepared for that
---
Sure, I agree with you on that point. BRD is one of my favourite dungeons of all time solely because of the layout. Still doesn't change the fact that I like RPGs, I like maze-like dungeons, and I also like fun and challenging boss design. Tank and spank is boring.
---
Bamboozled
---
This bluepost confirms that it was like that in vanilla and that's how it'll be in classic.
---
oh, you are absolutely right about the flametongue totem. They changed the buff of it in a later expansion to give spellpower, I thought it was similar in vanilla.
---
But it doesn't change my overall opinion on the matter.  :)
---
Power creep is unavoidable imo. It's also almost a necessity if you want the player to feel like they're progressing or at least working towards becoming stronger. What I liked about OSRS was that you still had to work through all the content in order to actually be strong enough to do the additional, more rewarding content. But I also only played an ironman, which essentially forces you to do exactly that. 
---
But wow is pretty inherently different from runescape, gameplay-wise. If they add higher-tier content to classic, it needs to be at least moderately to highly challenging when done in full Naxx gear, and the rewards can't be insanely better than Naxx gear. Ideally there are guilds still running all / almost all of the raids even late into the game. Like how people will still be running MC during phase 6 for bindings, so newer/less-progressed players are able to hop in and pug with them.
---
I remember having a 19 Pally on Bloodhoof that I used exclusively as a FR escort. Spamming BoF on the carrier and smashing Smite's Mighty Hammer on anyone running up on them
---
Thats not tinder.. Thats storyfire
---
happened to me in WOTLK  we didn't meet in game but we met and both played and started playing together.
---
Just waiting for papa Elon to get Starlink up and running and give 1gb/s to all of us plebs.
---
Isolated you can argue it's a good thing, however it hits the different classes unevenly. A hunter can for an example make a talent build that is pretty good for PvP, PvE and gold farming. Not optimal but close to it. A warrior tank on the other hand would be good for one dimension of PvE, useless in pvp and basically useless in farming gold/mats. If he want to experience anything else than tanking he would basically have to spend 100 gold a week at best to have fun in more than one way. This makes people shy away from tanking, making tanks harder to find than it already is thus decreasing the total number of groups being formed.
---
Nice system if you are hunter/mage/warlock/rogue, worse for everyone else.
---
Also huge amounts of experience.  A lot of the people who claim you can't get to 60 via questing don't even know about this one even though it's almost an entire level's worth by itself.  Tons of "talk to guy, get 5k exp" quests.
---
Ulda has a back door though so the devs maybe intended for people to run it as two different instances similar to how people don't do BRD full clears.
---
Shadow bolt has a 3 second cast time so it has a spell damage coefficient of 0.86. That is baked into the spell itself so reducing the cast time to 2.5 seconds with Bane, or getting instant casts via Nightfall, does not affect the benefit of spell damage at all.
---
Base stats do not at all matter...
---
I liked herb/alchemy on my shaman back in the old days. Seems like I remember it being a pretty good fit.
---
Who is the tank?
---
It might sound horrendous only casting shadow bolt for 3-9 hours a week - but if you are enjoying playing with the people in the raid, it almost doesn’t matter. The rest of the time you play you are out in the world or in dungeons where there isn’t a limit to how many dots u may throw at stuff!
---
It's the itemization. It's easier for druids to tank up early on before the tiered raid sets start pushing warriors ahead. The armor scaling works wonders and they do solid damage to gain threat.
---
I guess i am too bitter to play the game becaue of lore... Well, it's an interesting glimpse in to another perspective, where people have fun, good for them.
---
Oh god...that is...disgusting.
---
Yeah, the difference isn’t really worth even talking about at any level.  I’d go with what is more aesthetically pleasing/you enjoy lore wise/blah blah blah. You get what we’re saying
---
Why is that?
---
Interesting story and I'm not surprised.
---
Same as my username. Just gotta google it. I don't wanna break any rules this subreddit may have and link it direct.

You fail to realize OnLive was the first to do this except they went under and scrapped the ideas y because it wasn't as popular back then.

Showcase of a mage CoC kiting and getting hit from 10+ yards.
---
This happens when the mage is strafing (IsWalking = false). Earlier in the same video you can see the mage backpedaling (IsWalking=true) and is not getting hit.
---
This was already answered in a post you made like 5 mins ago.
---
Lol at you being downvoted in this thread. I completely agree with you. Reserving is a symptom of the me-first, screw everyone else cancer that infected wow.
---
"If you don't like it don't join/make your own group" and "if x is for another class why do you care?" completely miss the point. It goes against the spirit of the game.
---
I tested and confirmed rep decay in the Beta two months ago in this thread:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bshono/comment/eopcgc6
---
Originally in the Beta, there was no rep decay, but after they introduced the WSG patch, rep decay was definitely implemented.
---
In the Beta, I only reached 3,715/21,000 exalted with Darnassus by level 40, despite completing nearly every single Darnassus quest as well as most Alliance quests that gave spillover Darnassus rep. After Desolace and Feralas quests, you’d have to supplement with Morrowgrain/Un’Goro Soil turn-ins at level 47 and/or Runecloth turn-ins at level 50 to finally achieve exalted.
---
You can read through my entire quest completionist route here: https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm
---
Undead isn't even that good, warlock kind of counters mage and one 5 sec antifear won't help unless there're lucky crits.
---
Don't research anything.  Open the game and start.  Wish I could do that again
---
That about sums it up.
---
I know we're talking about classic, but on the topic of getting rogues out of stealth with blizzard... allow me to present this pvp video I made ten years ago in WOTLK.
---
https://youtu.be/ImW4T51Nkpw?t=124
---
You guys accepting your North Jersey brothers??
---
Shaman IMO is better in PvP - both classes can burst people really well (shadow and elemental)...but a priest you REALLY need peels or you will get trained and don't really have any ability to kite compared to a shaman that absolutely has tools for that with frost shock, bind totem, wolf, etc. Priest is better at leveling BY FAR just because you can stack spirit w/ spirit tap and wand just about non-stop and 40+ with shadow form is insane. But that's really your big advantage is leveling.
---
Minor. Shadow meld + aimshot does sound nice thought. Or stoneform for rouges.
---
Traaaash
---
Then why did OnLive fail to succeed. It was the same thing stadia is doing minus mobile.
---
The advantage of subbing is you can play on a server that you know won't get shut down. Most of the private servers running vanilla are going to shut down as soon as classic releases
---
I read this too quick and thought you said it was your LEAST favorite spell in the game, was like WTF is better than chain lightning?!?
---
For pvp mostly to get rogues out of stealth without losing a ton of mana. Sometimes to aoe slow mobs.
---
Stick to shaman, you can roll a druid later if the itch is still there.  Troll is fine, the tauren herbalism bonus is nice but I've never seen anyone go tauren just for that.
---
I came to say this.
---
No, it makes sense to reward players that are working harder than others.  This isn't a welfare system.  Players should get rewarded for going above and beyond, not coming to the raid and doing shit DPS without having gear enchanted or trying to get pre-raid BiS.
---
I just noticed something about the pvp set. For the epic set, the set bonuses are reversed, so the +23 spelldmg are 2-piece on the lbue set and 4 piece on the epic set.
---
If we compare the 4 items you wear in raw stats you gain 15 str, 32 int and lose 17 spelldmg. Looking at raw dmg, that's nearly equal, only real advantage of the epic set is the extra mana.
---
What is your main focus in the game? PvE or PvP?
---
Would you like to deal damage, heal other people or tank a boss?
---
Do you have a preferred race?
---
Are you going to raid (40 man dungeons, usually done with raid groups 2 to 3 times a week for ~ 3 to 4 hours)?
---
..zug zug is an orc thing. You do know, dwarfs are Alliance, right?
---
Classic is a game to enjoy it. Take your time and don't get seduced by retail and its arcade mode. Feel what a truly mmorpg Classic is.
---
I leveled a few warriors to 60 by ONLY running dungeons, and from the conversations Ive had with people I reckon that my playtime wasnt totally horrible. With good people and setup it can be really smooth, with a good feel and active gameplay. The full melee groups with a shaman healer really takes the cake, best fun imo.
---
They always did terrible threat on my pserver.   The thing I liked about them was how mindless they made the grind.  I watch a lot of tv while grinding to pass the time
---
It feels hollow even fresh starting, the ability to craft heirlooms is stupid tbh, i started a priest for the theck of it, got to level 5 in about 10mins or so and never once did I feel I was in danger or ran out of mana or anything, it was literally just a blitz to finish content ASAP, I'm not down for that I want lore heavy, hard and engaging combat and to feel in danger in zones I visit, classic has all of that and more
---
Warlock. Level plenty fast like Druid, and you don't have to buy a mount at 40. You can summon, HS, farm with the same spec as well as PvP as SM/Ruin and it is super fun.
---
I get what you’re saying, but some classes just do more dps than others, such as mages out dps warlock given the same pre raid BIS items.
---
For 5mans, it's all about which quests are available, and if they can be shared or not. There's plenty of google docs with that information, or you can find them when checking for dungeon quests on wowhead or any other vanilla database.
---
For some dungeons, like Gnomeregan or BRD, the design is a lot less linear, so knowing the fastest way to the bosses helps. There are maps, but they can be confusing with multi-level layouts. Watching a video on how to navigate Gnomer seems like a waste of time to me. Ideally you'll have someone in the group who knows roughly where to go, or you'll need to figure out a way to have fun getting lost over and over again.
---
You managed to get to further than me. I unlockes my dailies in nazjatar and did the opening stuff to mechagon, but didnt even go far enough for the jet pack. I played the stress test and since then retail has been dead to me. Its all lost. Bring on classic.
---
I've been debating on purchasing a laptop for awhile now.  I'm also in a masters program online so it'd help when I'm away on weekends and also to play WoW.  I just don't want to drop the 500-1000 for one.
---
It's my cousin's wedding, so I can probably go the day or two without WoW, but I already told my gf I'm barely drinking and coming right home to play the next day lol.
---
Or maybe he likes being the way he is ?
---
What do you want to do as a Shadow Priest? In PVE they are mediocre DPS at best and usually only 1 is allowed per raid. If you are playing more casually and in a more casual guild, you would probably still get a spot. In PVP they are great in 1v1s and alright in WPVP and BGs. Premade BGs I don't know much about but I've heard they are not taken much. You will be asked to heal quite a bit and can effectively while leveling, apparently up to the 50s dungeons.  
---
TBC is when Spriests really became monsters.
---
I directly understood his question, i presented him with the best alternative there is because what he wants doesn’t exist. And all i get is sour pusses.. it’s not normal to piss on the *only* person actualy trying to be helpful.
---
I think TBC ret pallys were under utilized. Yes their dps wasn't as good as a pure, but getting 3-4 pally buffs for a lot of raids wasn't always possible. Hence bringing just one ret pally was a  option (maybe not optimal). +3% crit was nice as well.
---
If you plan a decent route, water totem will fit right in to your route. I won't give specifics but I'll try to give some guidance.
---
Note: doing it this way means you don't get water totems till 29/30 (you will start the quest chain at 20!)
---
Grab it when you train lvl 20, when you are doing southern barrens quests. turn in the first part.
---
Do the ashenvale part when you quest there (after STM)
---
Do the hillsbrad part when you enter hillsbrad for the first time
---
You'll return to complete southern barrens and get the last part of the chain to kill the elemental behind sepulcher, make the pitstop to sepculcher when you're travelling to hillsbrad to finish the zone (this will be lvl 29/30)
---
Hope that helps!
---
A sneaky orc rogue must have typed that while I was polishing my gun and oiling my beard.
---
I'd say druid or warrior of these based on your guidelines and desire to tank.  Druid would be the easiest to get groups for with the flexibility to tank or heal so is casual friendly from that regard but if you were already a healer and hated it.... maybe you'd be better off just going warrior so you don't risk that being something you have to do?
---
PvE server still has bgs, and duels. But shadowmeld is not very useful if you dont do any PvP.
---
Keep yer feet on the ground!
---
god damn... im getting old
---
Ah for raids I can understand, I thought it was for 5 man content.
---
Reading the post it occurs to me that the problem is raiding itself. All other areas of the game - dungeons, questing, pvp - are areas in which utility has a lot of utility, where most specs are useful and it's difficult to quantify what best even means. But raiding mostly comes down to pure numbers - how much damage you do, take, heal.    
---
You compared it to D&amp;D, but D&amp;D doesn't have raids - merely doing high dps is not enough to make a character good. Raids are the end game of WoW, and that means a spec is in a large part defined by how useful it is in a raid. I'm not claiming to have a solution, but thinking about it a lot of the rot in WoW is directly related to the fact that its end game is raiding.
---
You get the mock triforce at the end of the whole quest chains from the big fire elemental.
---
I still plan to do world pvp when it happens and battlegrounds. Thank you for the advice!
---
I will look that one up. Thanks for tip!
---
You mean pulling 1 murloc scout who yells for his 150 m8s. Perfection!!!
---
For the most part beyond the most basic items pretty much every profession will use nearly every item for one recipe or another.
---
But it wouldn’t tell you how useful it is, e.g. it’s pretty pointless to mark a copper bar as used by enchanting because you need it to create a rod or mark a minor agility potion as needed for leather working because one pattern uses it.
---
Now I want to play a Hunter, a troll of course.
---
Professions leveling as Rogue?
---
Also professions when I reach 60?
---
Going to be world pvping
---
Exactly this. I also remember coc not being nearly as reliable as it is in pserver.
---
With your friends going Warrior and Rogue, Shaman hands down is going to be fucking amazing! Seriously consider going 30/0/21 and raid healing with that spec to save respec costs. Mana tide is not worth the points IMO. Get herbs and alchemy and hand out a few mana pots to any whiners so they STFU. Raids need healers anyway and you are going to be a huge buff to melee groups and your buddies are going to shit giant eggrolls when they see those windfury procs going off too.
---
This video was such a nice breath of fresh-early-2000's air. 
---
I was young again for a few minutes.
---
Play Mage. When you run a dungeon, Blizzard non-elites. Otherwise, do whatever you want, and have fun.
---
Private Servers bad.
---
With your logic you may as well not play any games at all.
---
Your going to be disappointed. Don't get me wrong I love vanilla. I really would like to know what you think will be so much different?
---
Almost every part of a spider (legs, webbing,  meat, fangs, ect) is used in some sort of crafting or cooking recipe.
---
lol okay troll
---
Mage rogue priest and warlock is pretty common as undead. There isn't only mage as undead...
---
I do see situation where a fear can save a warrior. From kiting to defensive stance you can pin point a fear without bleed tick and turn the side.
---
But heck if you prefer going gnome for mobility go for it, i've played alliance warrior and often i see the fear shout ability useless as i'm facing undead X.
---
Spider silks are used for a ton of tailoring blues.
---
Shaman can be fun for its burst, but I wouldn't call them an excellent world PvP class. I strongly recommend druid. A skilled druid has everything you need in world PvP: stealth; tankiness; heals; CC; and virtual immunity to roots, slows, and poly with their trinket covering every other CC. They are also much less gear reliant than Shaman as feral's do not depend on weapons, nor do they rely on having epic trinkets for a burst macro.  
---
Can you do shaman? Of course. I think druid is the king of world PvP though.
---
" The Berserking Troll racial ability is behaving as expected and matches the reference client. "  
---
Whats he referring to?
---
Thanks for that, seems awesome
---
20-30, even if they don't have their full kit, if you have a strong feeling about one it probably won't change after that.
---
Scatter plus trap is still 10 seconds with the DR. If you spec clever traps it will be 13 seconds. That’s plenty of time, all this talk about DR ruining hunters is overblown.
---
&gt;There is no consumable that can give you 30% stun resist.
---
You wouldn't drink those either because you have consumables that give you 100% stun resist for 30 seconds... it just so happens to be the consumable the one you're replying to is talking about.
---
I've leveled two warlocks. My thoughts on leveling are as follows:
---
First five talents into making corruption an instant cast. You're rotation is CoA, Corruption, Immolate, wand, drain soul. After that, two points in imp drain soul always using R1 to finish and having necrosis to delete the extra shards. 
---
By around 20% health you will have taken aggro from your VW which is why improved voidwalker is a great next option to go for. 
---
Next is siphon life. Great talent for sustaining. You also have the option to pick up Fel dom which can save your life in a tricky situation. I tend to favor more affliction after imp VW until Siphon life and CoE, then back to demon to beef up the demons a bit. I also like to respec mid 40s to shake things up with conflag. Its not efficient but its fun. 
---
Aside from these talents, take whatever feels most fun. 
---
Raiding. Is. Boring. SM Ruin. 
---
PvP:
---
 If you're able to snag the off pieces like mantle of the blackwing cabal, nef cap, mage blade, etc. Full destro pvp is a great option and provides lots of fun burst but is very crit heavy and you're a class cannon.
---
If you have only the pvp set or raiding tier set, soul link is super strong. Soul link has two options, drain tank(20/31/0) or more shadowbolt heavy(5/31/15). Neither option allows for grabbing the Ruin talent. Both options have surprisingly different playstyles which is a lot of fun.
---
Play Dwarf. Only ever Dwarf. If you think hey it would be cool to level a druid or a shaman. Just think can i play as a Dwarf. No you cant. Play as a Dwarf
---
I definately recall certain private servers having more leeway than others... This is basically pointless (or manipulative) if you picked the private server with the most leeway, I remember one of them feeling too offputting to play on.
---
I know. I was mostly joking, 9 mins isn't even that long imo.
---
yeah i went mage in vanilla and quit 2 weeks later cuz frostbolt was such a great dps rotation.
---
An option that is somewhere between "idk" and "google it, you lazy bum."
---
I could suggest they just uninstall WoW and punch their monitor, which is technically *an option*, but that doesn't mean it's a good or helpful one. Nobody likes a pedant, 'ey?
---
There are no good guns to use when raiding so the specialization unfortunately never matters.
---
I wish it did. It would make the choice easy.
---
Try a private server. Get some hands on experience on classes you're interested in so you can hit the ground running on August 27th. Private servers are not going to be 100% in terms of scripting but just so you can have an idea.
---
I don't see why you'd bother? However, I think a really well played and geared team of 25 could probably clear AQ40. Don't think you'd get past 4HM, Sapph or KT though.
---
This sub will always say orc. Most cases it is true. Shaman I don’t believe so. Shaman lacks hard cc. Warstomp gives you that. Free cast on an ele shaman can turn a fight. If you go resto you can easily get a big heal off. Plus it’s on a rather short cd. Shaman PvP trinket also gets rid of stuns. So I just don’t see how orc is better for shamans
---
It really won't (in my humble opinion). It falls in the same territory as Warrior where it is a bit sluggish to level. Combine that with the fact that it cannot be Undead (obviously) and that takes another chunk out. I really only think it will be more popular than Druids.
---
You cropped this picture.
---
Right under it says: "Receive any loot"
---
And then the little bugger *also* uses a potion. 
---
You get him down to 20% health again, he runs, you run, he returns with his buddy who *backstabs* you for 30% health.
---
My guild said three.  We never did.
---
Blizzard optimizes their current game so well I can play with decent settings on my potato laptop.
---
What about Goblin Rocket Helm?
---
Ikr, along with LaP they make stun resistance look pretty bad.   
---
At least a Mage can sheep you 3 times to waste 22 seconds and Ice Block for another 10 to completely nullify the duration of your FaP so Escape Artist still has its use during the fight.
---
I remember this as well.  Full circle?  Probably not, maybe with lag, but I do remember enemies getting through 25-50% of my AoE's effect before seeing them take damage or get debuffed.
---
Can be said for a lot of white items.
---
Bank them all and you never know when you can cash in basilisk eyes for 1 gold a pop.
---
Ignore any wierdos who think this game should be played 100 hours a week and have a PHD in it
---
What is the earliest form of the game that will work on the live servers nowadays? I'm guessing it's probably MoP or WoD. I wonder what would actually happen if you installed those &amp; tried to connect - would it just give an error message, or would it try to install BNet and BfA?
---
Farm as much as SpellPower Gear and go Shockadin. You wont have enough Crit to Crush the Enemy as Ret but will have Enough DPS and Healing to go 1Vs1 against every melee.
---

---
You're gonna have a bad time.
---
There's usually no gear 1-10 (aside from weapons for melee / hunters) that REALLY make a difference. That white bracer with 3 extra armor ain't doing much.
---
Its not easy to level true. But you can check any private server data, polls or beta server data. Shaman is on top 3 for horde. It is extremely popular.
---
End game you are fine unless you want to be in a "hardcore" raiding guild. Some people might ask you to heal but everyone will enjoy your totem buffs.
---
Nobody is gank immune, and a rogue out in the open is a sitting duck. Sure you have some CDs to escape but no class really buys you immunity......except druids are on another level comparatively speaking. If you get 3v1'd, or attacked by someone 10 levels higher than you, or have a mob or two on you with low health, you're just gonna corpse run it most of the time.  Roll what you enjoy and don't overthink the ganking aspect. It happens.
---
Are you OK with healing at 60?
---
Beta is done and so it’s to give some final thoughts on what was a critical window of time for WoW Classic’s development process.

The show extensively covers the winners and losers of the beta, which includes a twist that would make M. Night Shymalan cringe!
---
After that the show goes on to break down the sneakily huge blue post regarding crit suppression with the theorycrafters, vanilla dungeon designer John Staat’s is back for part two of his epic recap of the making of Karazhan, and then we hear all about what’s happening with Countdown To Classic guild options.
---
Highlights Below:
---
* Calling Countdown #1 – Winners &amp; Losers of Beta w/ Ayle &amp; Nano – 3:50

Cheers!
---
\- Josh
---
&gt;Everybody knows these specs are shit!
---
Well, no. Because there are posts all the time saying 'Guys hybrid dps specs are actually good! You can play them in raids!'
---
Which means people will play those, level to 60, find out they can't raid very well, then quit the game.
---
Thank you. Now I have something to listen to today!
---
Encounter design too. I agree with the above points about needing non-linear dungeons and content, but honestly I loved the ingenuity of TBC's encounters.
---
I'm rolling a druid - make sure you understand you won't be a maintank in raids, and you won't outheal priests in raids, and you won't have a res.
---
Still, it's a really fun class, a lot more dynamic than warr I'd think.
---
Well, I did around 250 dps unbuffed in my tests with prebis gear. So, 350 upper end dps seems reasonable to me. You already do 150 dps just sitting there and autoattacking. 
---
With spelladin and MCP I did 350 dps with full elixirs, spelladin will get nerfs in classic, but that same value with buffs is realistic.
---
&gt; Sure, but do you really want to play with those people?
---
you don't know beforehand whether a person sucks or not. And depending on the server you may not have the option to get other people. A sucky player in classic is often better than no player. There are few bosses where a single idiot can wipe the raid.
---
&gt; Also, if I have a random ret and a random fury I'll take the random fury 100% of the time.
---
When will you have that choice? Very few pople will play ret in raids. Those that do, are already accounted for. When you decide whether to take a ret into a raid, you won't pick a random, but somebody you at least somewhat know. I expect to 1 ret in every 25 semi hardcore+ guilds. In casuals, it'll probably go up to 1 every 5 or 6 guilds.
---
I don't think people who, oblivous to all, level a paladin and want to raid as ret will even exist. The spec is far too stigmatized. Even if they start classic with no knowledge, they'll be confronted with ret stigma before reaching max level and either read up about it, accept their place as a healer or quit the character/game. IF they read up about it, they'll accept to heal, quit or put in the work to become a good ret.
---
When it comes to pre raid dungeons, whether you pick a fury or a paladin doesn't matter, they deal similar dps. In scholo and strat UD, you'd even rather take the ret as they'll outdamage pre-raid warriors there.
---
And when you run dungeons in raid gear, it also doesn't really matter, as you can play the dungeon with 3 or 4 people as well, if you wanted to.
---
For 40 man raiding - it's likely not going to happen or if it does, rarely. Family + work constraints will see to that. So that would likely just leave 10 man raids + BGs and world pvp
---
I picked the first and best. Retro wow because they use Nostalrius core and because you start in Orgrimmar and have FP to ratchet, making it really easy to do the test.   
---
Anyway, alot of people disagree, all with their own reason, yet im still to see any tests done by themself. Im eagerly waiting for your test. The more information and testing we have on this subject, the better.
---
A few of my friends are feeling the same way. They lost their hype rip
---
Fury tanks can do really goos dps, more than enchance shamans so yes technically at the same time. 
---
Regardless of spec and speaking of the class as a whole, warriors can do both extremely well and shaman can do neither. 
---
I don't really see what the option is here, the option to do both specs poorly? Doesn't seem fun.. and he didn't say anything about gear just talents.
---
I don't remember when I started playing, but it was before Naxx was added. But I wasn't even 60 yet whan BC came out, because I was just having so much fun PvP-ing. I played in Alterac for ages, even though I shouldn't have, just because everything was so new and fun for me. Then, when BC was released, I spent hours watching my brother play in outlands, because my character wasn't high enough yet. But I never once regrettet taking my time and enjoying the game.
---
Berserking gives 43% haste, not 30%, when activated at the lowest threshold of 40% health remaining.
---
It's a bug, but they are keeping it vanilla, so troll gonna be super strong if you can abuse health level before using it.
---
Let's all take in that this comparison and all those sassy comments are based on an "I believe."
---
Also, more leeway is clearly worse than less. Adding another two yards or so. could move easily move it from "kinda shitty" but acceptable to "shitty" and unacceptable.
---
Other than being a contrarian, I see no reason to be on Blizz's side for this.
---
He’s got excellent knowledge of the class and I find his videos excellent.
---
The pasing is very different.
---
Your first item that you will keep forever is from a level 43 quest (Carrot on a Stick).
---
Gear from dungeons like ST will accompany you through most of the game (Diamond Flask for warriors from ST warrior quest).
---
Lots of stuff is a lot more meaningful and you can cruise past it.
---
Dont do all quests in your starting zone + barrens? You are now level 17 and the next quests in Stonetalon are level 21. Off you go grind, do WC or Silverpine Forest. You were forced out of your comfort zone to go explore the zone in which there was a very real chance of dying to mobs or enemy players.
---
You can still die once in a bluemoon in retail, but in the time your opponents need to mop up your friend, you already corpse walked 10seconds and are back in action. Where is the fun in meaningless wPvP?  
---
I can go and on and on.
---
Mage, for sure. Warlock almost fits your description but is definitely not mobile. Still fun though.
---
One layer is one server. One server with three layers is the same as three separate servers. Except you need to implement the layering technology which costs money. One server with three layers is more complex and expensive than three separate servers. They so it because they don't want a bunch of empty servers.
---
You don’t need a heal or tank spec while leveling.
---
Stick with the classes damage spec for leveling.  Re-doing talents gets expensive the more you do it.
---
Paladian level as Ret, and are expected to be Holy healers for raids. 
---
Level Shadow as a priest, re-spec later if you raid heal.
---
Warriors can level as arms or fury.  Then switch to protection at level 60 to tank.
---
All the healing and tanking builds suck to level with, and are not required for low level dungeons.
---
A shadow priest can heal a low level dungeon.  Shadow priest can not heal at the endgame.
---
but how do you zoom out when you create a new character?
---
&gt; It's quite a bit more than just click/watch netflix, most classes ( even the hardest ones by vanilla standards) would only need 1 button per global.
---
Oh no I was referring to "auto-wand" aka "shoot" which is the hardcore levelling technique at some level breakpoints.
---
Just wanted to give you a heads up that triangle trapping is *much* harder/unreliable in classic. The poor little imp can barely stand to take two/three hits before going down.
---
Ok
---
Everyone is choosing Horde? That would be completely counter to all the previous data about WoW so i'd like to see what you base it on.
---
And that's what we call 'Standgebläse' in Germany. 😂
---
Well most people who actually try to be the best at WoW Classic do it because time is money friend :). When you can finish all raid content in 2-3hours (MC + BWL, which will be the raid environment for months) then you have more time to:
---
- Make Gold (and SAVE gold by using less consumables from not wiping)
---
- PVP
---
- Work on professions
---
- Level alts
---
- Play other games than WoW
---
You shouldn't worry about imbalance. There is a lot of people who don't want to play "ugly horde" but the "beautiful human/elf" instead.
---
But as an alliance rogue you'll have some surprise against Orc.
---
Yeah, definitely gonna miss being one of the MT in raids. As for healing - I'll be feral, so my healing will suck.
---
id have to agree with most here.  If you're watching all these streamers that sit at their computer 12 hours a day talking about rushing to 60 you'll completely ruin your classic experience.  So much of what I remember from those days are before getting to 60.  Leaving the starting zone for the first time.  Getting to a major city for the first time.  Then  getting your first blue.  Level 19-29-39-49 battle grounds. T-Mill world pvp,  STV world pvp, etc etc etc. The raiding, it could be argued,  is the least fun part of classic.  But then again getting the best gear in the game is its own brand of fun.
---
Pretty much every single class has a workable (not optimal) spec that works in all facets of the game.
---
Druids run 0/30/21 (or 1/29/21) HotW/NS and can feral dps, heal, and FC just fine with it.
---
Priests can play 21/30/0 as raid healer and PvP healer, while also being a strong 1v1 spec.
---
Paladin can heal just fine as Holy Reckoning or Shockadin (lol)
---
Shaman runs 30/0/21 for heals and ele PvP, or just deep Resto as PvP healer.
---
These are not optimal specs for all facets of the game but that's the downside of playing a hybrid spec that can do everything. Even the classes you mentioned don't have 1 size fits all specs.
---
Hey thanks for the reply. Druids are definitely high up on my list with the only main point being that I don't particularly like their races. However, I do definitely remember being grinded down to death by druids in vanilla. Their toolkit is pretty perfect for world pvp.
---
Thats not what he said at all. Reliance =/ not using something... Reading comprehension my dude.
---
There was no Keyring until TBC
---
Easy to do well with ranged classes in group play. Wouldn't worry too much about keybinds, we are talking 200 hours just to hit 60. Make sure you have about 15 binds easy to hit and you can learn any class well enough by 60.
---
Interesting! Do you get threat reduction or mana regen on - you know what, got a link to the whole build? Much easier.
---
I have no idea of how their internal process has been for layering. The subject may have been relevant a long time before anything was announced to the public, and the only way to know this would probably be to know one of the people involved. 
---
In “The WoW Diary: A Journal of Computer Game Development” by John Shaats (level designer for Vanilla), he states that the amount of misconceptions in the public as to why certain decisions were made are almost always completely wrong. He recognizes that the assumptions made by the public are often well founded and clever, BUT due to the lack of information available they are rarely accurate. 
---
I myself work as a developer at a fairly large IT-company, and have several years of experience with development of large and complex systems. And let me say, it is not easy, there are few “pet projects”, and in order to succeed all things need to be meticulously planned, estimated and executed. I therefore believe that we should not underestimate the time, money and resources put in to getting layering to work as well as possible. 
---
In regards to the cost, I do not know what people are being payed, but development is not cheap. On top of this, they could have just stuck with sharding and it would have been almost free, instead they chose to invest all that money, for the sole purpose of improving our experience.
---
I definitely think they have made an amazing job at mitigating an insolvable problem.
---
I'm a hunter, if the tank can't hold aggro off of me I'll have my pet do it.
---
AFAIK you'll need to return to Razor Hill for your pet quest chain plus you won't be able to gain any hunter skills without making a return journey to orc territory. You'll either be levelling inefficiently as you only have 2 attacks or you'll be spending half your /played time commuting from one continent to the other.
---
No black lotus and zerking doesn’t affect gather rate in classic
---
You realize why that is, though? The rage system is what causes that. Before gearing up warriors dps is dogshit. They sort of knew that the rage mechanic was gonna make warriors go bananas once geared but they were okay with it because it gave the game texture and made classes more flavorful overall.
---
If everyone chooses horde it will be good for you. More world pvp = win as a rogue.

The higher base agility makes zero difference in end game raiding. Your ability to master the dps rotation will be infinitely more important for your dps. The nelf vs dwarf for pve is literally the same.  The argument comes down to who is better for PvP. Which imo is dwarf.

I'm loving this conversation topic. Honestly I've changed my mind like 5 times reading responses to this question. That being said I really like the idea of challenging, time consuming tasks for higher tiered gear. IRC there's a couple BIS feral druid items that are gated behind similar tasks and those hold up basically until the end of vanilla content. I still really fondly remember the warlock epic mount questline as well. My vote would be adding more of these... especially ones that make you go travel to unexplored areas to get specific items. I love class quests that require groups to kill obscure elites because it adds a sense of class camaraderie getting a group together to farm the mats.
---
This whole video is worth watching, but I linked it to the part that may be most useful for this question. I hope.
---
https://youtu.be/szkScab2iOQ?t=1907
---
They also didn’t design around raids. But yeah, that’s why they don’t have dps meters built into the game
---
You wont do that :O
---
Gnome
---
Hey !
---
Back in Classic i went back to Darnassus and did low level quests at 60 to buy a tiger.
---
I did not got ANY reputation
---
Dwarves are the best hunters anyway.
---
so you cant provide any evidence to support your claim?  you have only shown evidence of ret pallies being non viable
---
thank you for proving my point
---
Something like that was released with the AQ  patch, so hopefuly it won't be in at launch. 
---
If it is in at launch, it will make herbalists' life easier for bag space, and also it will affect the market for Un'goro soil, those things that grow from it, Purple Lotus, etc.
---
I'm a classic player I have plenty of fire resist gear :)
---
its come first nature, its not even that big of a deal anymore even too, since you get to just go right back in. Im sure its annoying for some people but thats the game now
---
do it.
---
Honestly, kinda.
---
Ironforge is the best city in Vanilla.
---
Something often forgotten in vanilla is that you played a class, not a spec. That's why you can tri-spec and do whatever hybrid you wackiness you desire. And every class was viable in every part of the game.
---
From what I found back during vanilla/tbc/wotlk is that the horde players are more vocal and more proud to be horde. I played horde exclusively until mists. Alliance will almost always be the faction with more people except for probably 1 or 2 horde dominated servers. Even then though the ratios would be more like 60-40. Lots of players just want to play humans
---
Thanks man, exactly what I was looking for.
---
I was 10 in 2004! It was a very impressionable age, so it wasn't hard to make a deep connection to arguably the best fantasy mmo ever. My comfort material was Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Pirates of the Caribbean. The 2000's fantasy hype train was sinfully fun for a child's Summer breaks. However, it was a tough landscape for a squeaky voice in 2005. I'm very excited to play the game at a more intelligent and mature angle. Having less available time doesn't scare me as I'm certain 3 hours for 10 yr old me is likely equal to 1 hour 24 yr old me. So all in all I'm just glad I get a shot at this again with a frontal lobe.
---
Dude I just jumped aboard your podcast like 2 weeks ago.
---
Awesome work man.
---
Because despite what is parroted around, they are still really good
---
&gt; Mythic+ Dungeons.
---
i was excited for this before i realize the up the difficulty with each patch, I thought the poiint was to get as high as you could, but they made 10s likes twice as hard or something each season
---
1-2 naaah. When you're finally playing 1 month will go by FAST. Heck most ppl wont even be max level within the first two months. Have you played at all on 'eladhtroN'&lt;-- read backwards. I would not like a rushed experience, 4 months is enough time for most hardcore guilds to gear up their core to the teeth and for the old gear not to become devaluated too quickly. 1-2 months is what we had on private servers and it was imo way too fast. You'll have plenty to do even 4 month phase plan. If anything, id like if the pvp phase was released a little bit earlier, but wpvp is my favourite form of pvp so im not too bothered about that.
---
It’s only VERY bad if you think that raiding balance is all that matters, or even the most important.
---
*in raids
---
Shaman 1-20 is an absolute breeze with rock biter and a staff.
---
Ranged spells so you aren't entirely dependent on weapon upgrades, excellent survivability with aoe / ranged snares and heals. Good time to kill as well.  
---
Ghost wolf and astral call make getting around extremely easy prior to 40.
---
I always enjoy hearing the "professional gamer POV"...
---
So basically if Garrosh was not Garrosh but somebody actually......competent.
---
&gt; Sure you did
---
So claiming a fury warrior doing 600 dps in blues is believable, but relaying the results of my personal tests is not. Why would I lie?
---
&gt; Exactly. So, given that an awesome paladin will perform just the same as a keyboard turning fury warrior I'll take the fury warrior anyway.
---
a keyboard turning fury warrior will perform worse than a good ret paladin.
---
&gt; The reasoning behind casuals being more capable of carrying shitty classes always baffles me. You know what happens when you carry someone? Sooner or later the carrying people will leave for greener pastures.
---
Because casual guilds don't mind as much about minmaxing. Yeah, they'll have a lot of people going in and out, because more hardcore players will leave, but that'S the nature of casual guilds, which also means it's easier for even not so great ret to find a spot there.
---
&gt; I won't take either tbh
---
Then you are pretty silly. A paladin is an excellent asset in any 5 man dungeon, no matter the spec. Ret in particular can not only fill a good dps role, but also provides a lot of support with aura, blessing and jusgement and can support with heals when necessary.
---
Right when you finally get stormstrike??  No way.  At least have fun with that before you have to respec at 55-60.
---
I can't replay to your post without quoting something lol... anyway my only issue with horizontal content at post-naxx level is that it will barely be seen by the majority of classic players. I'd like to see them flesh out a bit more of the world pre-naxx as well.
---
Game mechanics aren't necessarily the only driving force that creates the vanilla experience.
---
Fixing some small visual bugs wont make a big difference but fixing many small bugs might.
---
Retail players going to classic kind of reminds me of what happened when they nerfed the hell out of healers in cata.  When cata first launched, everyone kept thinking all the healers sucked because they made healing much more mana intensive.  In classic, will probably be the same thing for tanks.  "Everyone is attacking different targets, why can't the tank hold aggro?!"
---
Ah yes, hmm forgot faps do that too.
---
This makes me sad, because I wasn't. Classic will still be a huge step up from retail, but the simple fact of the game not being new changes things a lot. I would *love* to play and be naive, but I feel like that puts me at a huge disadvantage against all the people who have leveled 5 million times and just want to ding 60 (which I certainly don't blame them for). 
---
Oh well, I'm going to have fun regardless, which is ultimately all that matters.
---
The devs intend it to work like in 1.12. Working as intended means it's working like it did in 1.12.
---
Yeah except you're the one who started the comparison, but ok. 
---
Again, you don't have a leg to stand on. Recognising that you were mistaken and changing your opinion about a subject afterwards is not a character flaw, it's the opposite. Learn from your mistakes, let your opinions evolve.
---
I agree with you, it would be quick. I kinda thought they wanted quick though. I almost think it should be tiered. Phase 2 after like 2 mo but the last phase could be like 6mo after the one before it.
---
Well, you made an excellent argument. I was wrong all along.
---
Roll a dward, but level in NE starting zone. 
---
Then you will be a dwarf with an owl, which is rare by itself up to you get the owl pets at lvl 40something.
---
And you will become exalted with Nelves much faster so you can have the saber mount.
---
Which is also pretty rare for a dwarf (if you level in dwarf zone, it will take a bucketload of expensive rep. quests to get exalted with nelves)
---
Its literally the fastest way to level at launch.
---
The catch is that you need 5 people online the entire time
---
If you think 600-900 dps is not viable, you have no idea how classic works.
---
I've told you several times 500 dps is enough to beat all content in the game, therefore 500 dps viable. But in your twisted brain viable somehow means 1500 dps or what?
---
There are plenty of ways to overcome bosses with less dps and more utility. Kiting/CCing adds, multiple bosses that require special class tools, stuff like Buru or Twin Emps with different mechanics, etc.
---
The reason why DPS stacking is meta is because it's the fastest way to complete the raid. But vanilla was designed as a casual game in 2014, where Raids were only entered by the most dedicated 3% and the majority of the playerbase was too busy frolicking in STV at level 40 to care about warriors doing insane dps.
---
Hiya i'm a vanilla warrior with 2500+ Hours of experience. You probably won't have a fun time in duels but you'll have a blast in small world pvp if you can get a healer with you. Even if you're a new player Warrior &amp; Pally can 2v4 with only a bit of gear.
---
Should be “Classic’s” not “Classics”
---
Just saying.
---
pretty sure I'm playing warlock now.
---
Can people provide pros/cons for the class?
---
Pros
---
free mount
---
No respecing between pvp and pve
---
dungeon farm capability
---
They haven't released an official list that I'm aware of.
---
You directly didn’t. You started talking about loot tiers, quite literally not the answer to his question and when it got pointed out you got pissy. You were in no way shape or form answering his question.
---
Mate it’s not worth my time arguing with you, you don’t seem the type to see sense
---
Yes! But printing the punctuation is annoying x
---
Agreed. But rogue is such a fun class. Sneaking to quests easily. Waving through trash when pats respawn in a dung. They are just awesome
---
Raiding MC was so painful as a resto druid that I rerolled after a few months of doing it. Only your most geared druid should keep rejuv and regrowth on the MT, which leaves you to just spam healing touch. Innervate goes to the priests, and b rez once every 30 minutes. Snooze
---
The game would be unplayable for weeks at launch, and empty after two months. It's the lesser of two evils, by a large margin.
---
On the contrary, it could make it more exciting. My first character was a rogue and I was terrified when I saw red text to indicate enemy faction land. I stayed in stealth and kept a large distance as I explored since I had a fear that if I were spotted I was going to be hunted and killed relentlessly. We all know why that is highly unlikely now, but at the time it made for some stressful and fun forbidden exploration.
---
I remember when doing the instance culling of stratholme I think, my character got turned into a white male.  I asked the instance "why am I a white male and what privelge do I in azeroth as a white male"  Someone responded "the privelege to get killed by horde".
---
Ah, those are definitely supposed to be, thats odd
---
Well, the queues were super quick for Horde, at least. I can only imagine how long of a queue it was for Alliance. World PvP wasn't exactly pleasant either. World Raids were a bit uhhhh one-sided usually. Just sheer leveling, the horde side did feel somewhat empty too. Overall, don't recommend :P
---
Is that double D from Ed Edd and eddy?
---
All classes can have a workable spec yes, but the point is that it differs highly from class to class what you sacrifice when making that one fit all spec. 
---
If you are a warrior you can't be raid tanking and do the rest of the content without either A, respeccing, or B, being a complete meme in PvP, and incredible slow farmer. So either you have to sacrifice tanking raids, which is an immense sacrifice compared to some DPSers just being slightly less optimal in PvP.
---
&gt;Even the classes you mentioned don't have 1 size fits all specs.
---
"A hunter can for an example make a talent build that is pretty good for PvP, PvE and gold farming. **Not optimal but close to it.**" Hunter don't have 1 size fits all specs, but I didn't claim that. A 20/31/0 build with Scatter Shot is pretty close to being optimal for PvE while having slightly less defensives compared to a full PvP build. You make a negligible sacrifice for PvE, and a small sacrifice for PvP to be able to do both pretty well. It's not 1 size fits all, but pretty close.
---
A paladin/priest can heal PvP and PvE, but will lack the dmg for grinding mobs efficiently. They can group up to combat this, but that in itself is another concession they have to make, which a hunter/warlock/mage don't have to. 
---
I overall agree with you that barriers for respeccing is a net positive in a vanilla setting. I do not advocate at all for introducing the no-cost respec system of retail into classic. However, the 50 gold one way respec is so high that it stifles options and creativity. Just halving it would make the burden a lot lighter for many classes, while the frugal can still save a lot of gold in the long run by sticking to one talent build at a time.
---
So the longer the fight goes for the better for the warrior? Aren’t fight generally longer with a warrior anyway because of the natural tankyness?
---
What? You should absolutely level as fury. I never said you should dual wield though.
---
[You know what? Just take the Onyxia Raid Wipe Remix by Mr. Voltreon.](https://youtu.be/DtWfhkC4A_A)
---
High skill cap/floor in PvP, especially with pet management. Up to you whether you see this as a con or not.
---
Makes friends, take engineering or alchemy
---
A few potatoes linked together via USB-C should do it.
---
Or y'know, drop all aggro at a moment's notice on a 30 second CD. C'mon fellow hunter, let's seize the opportunity to make all the Locks and Mages jealous
---
What?
---
Hence the class was purposely made to make you lose all your friends.
---
I would assume it was after blizz made the dungeons easy again.
---
Where can I get one? Would go well on the back of my Challenger for a double entendre
---
Would be really cool if someone made a damage meter that did try to take into account things like the 3% buffs / innervate damage added for feral druids. Idk what the logistics of implementing would be but that would be interesting.
---
Not far, because you will lack the gear to make it far enough.  Early MC probably would be fine, but it will take a while to get geared to a level to even do BWL.  Razorgore is a reality check.
---
FFFFFUUUUUUUCKKK! WHO THE FUCK? THATS A 50 DKP MINUS!
---
Pre-cast pyro before the first sunder will be the new confirmed meta
---
Right, but first that was still a different meta far away from 1.12. And classic is a recreation of 1.12 where Blizzard says it is an intentional mechanic, so still not a bug.
---
That's a perspective I haven't seen before. I agree, ofc.
---
&gt; I’m not trying to say it is a good game, but I really dislike the mindless circle jerk of this sub. I’m willing to bet that if you went into the game with a not so toxic mind set right off the bat
---
i did not go into it with a "toxic mindset". I figured it was implied but when i said i went hard at doing the objectives, i figured that would imply i was having fun, i wouldnt spend time doing something i didnt enjoy. I stopped once it became obvious what was going on.
---
So 100 days are 274 years ?
---
CPU=Dual or quad core from last 8 years or so  
---
GPU=1 or more gig of Vram  
---
RAM=4 ok, 8+ is good  
---
HDD=Yes   
---
Honestly, the game is not hard to run,you may want some "decent" specs if you wanna run at 4k max settings in raids, but my wifes computer with a 2.8ghz dual core AMD, 4 gigs of ram and a 550ti ran the beta just fine
---
Best flag carrier, too. Solid node defense in AB. Hardest class to kill in PvP. One of the best 1v1 world PvP classes (though maybe not with LOTP spec - but with HOTW+NS or 29/11/11 they are). Match up favorably vs the 3 most common classes: mage, warrior, rogue
---
The same for me. I was playing a Resto Shaman back then, and if I wasn't with my guild, I couldn't expect to clear Heroic Grim Batol pre-nerf.
---
Worse was when you got people who rode the dragons and didn't nuke the mobs. It was *very* punishing if even one person screwed that up and I lost several runs to it.
---
Very nice, would /inspect in Orgrimmar.
---
A warriors rage is fuelled off of receiving damage and giving damage. The more of both, the more fuel the warrior has to rag on boyos
---
Generally the fight would be longer because of armour/talents etc but the heals really amp that up for the warrior enabling them tenfold
---
Cata and TBC heroics where really the peak of fun gameplay for me, together with sunwell.
---
They will be popular no doubt but what I found interesting is that at least based off the poll done [here](https://i.redd.it/smdyb81dz9531.jpg), it's not that much of a bigger percentage compared to the other classes. Mages, Priests, and Rogues all got less but similar percentages for horde data. Shaman is also 2nd to last overall which is obviously due to being limited to 1 faction but still, I don't think there is going to be so many Shamans that it should be considered as a factor whether or not to play one.
---
Go fury till 40 then switch to arms and your friend can go holy to concentration then ret. Really no need to go holy he will heal just fine. Sorry to burst your bubble though but you won't be able to pull big mobs and aoe them down while moving to other big Mob pulls. Your Pali will run out of Mana after probably 1 maybe 2 pulls depending on how large and you won't be able to kill them fast enough. Mob density also isn't amazing in most areas so you'll likely lose some mobs while moving to the next pack. Plus there will be tons of competition for mobs.
---
I was able to run the demo smoothly with a gtx 560 and about similarly bad cpu
---
You are showing the exact "retail mindset" I was talking about, i.e. "raiding is everything". If you look at raiding only, sure everything looks unbalanced. But every class has their own advantage in every part of the game. Even leveling is important to consider because the average Classic player will spend months getting to 60.
---
my perfect system would be if over the expac you have way smaller power jumps, and the mythic
---
+ keeps going up. This would allow people to push and get to some crazy numbers for fun.
---
True enough, I just think Classic will see a lot more "casual" interest as the entry barrier is much less "complex" than a private server. Obviously just my opinion but I really think with the negative spin people put on DPS shaman, you won't see as many of them.
---
It is a mistake to think that balance has to mean homogenization.
---
The difference for PvE is so minor you should honestly play what you want. The only time I'd ever say min-max matters to a racial factor is priest as dwarf priest has an amazing utility skill, but even then unless you're pushing world first it simply does NOT matter one bit. Also in PvP you'll have stoneform is is arguably better than all other NE bonuses.
---
We geared up a few level 29 twinks and played them at a quasi-LAN -party a whole night (and a few times afterwards). I had a holy pala and it was amazing. Flash of light crits would heal half of our flag carriers life and my crit chance was insane. One of my fondest vanilla memories!
---
Just picked up on this and I'm absolutely in love with it. I wish I had known all this time leading up to where we are now. (We're so close!)  
---
Is there any plan to continue/evolve the podcast after Classic release? Or will all your time go to grinding for consumables and raid progression? :)
---
That makes sense, thanks a lot for this.
---
Leveling with heirlooms makes the game feel more like diablo. Your new goal is to kill as many mobs as possible all at once. It turned into pulling 10-15 mobs at once and easily killing them. The game became how to apply dot rotations on them while slightly kiting. I didn't mind it as it became fun if I approached it that way but still doesn't compare to the classic experience and of course in situations where you can't pull that many mobs it's boring af.
---
Honestly, I am not 100% sure on hunters' gear dependency. But since their damage relies on attack power and weapon damage I assume that they are. On the other hand their damage scales really badly in the end-game, thus suggesting that their skills don't scale much with gear. So yeah, not sure  :/
---
We will be running a large subreddit-wide (and extending out to other communities where we can find them) massive survey in the next few weeks.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xIw7HPEpe5fUSV0mIVzgkdtGxHxqYc4mcVtn26ThS68/edit?usp=sharing
---
That's the link the the previous survey we ran, but that was well before the beta.
---
&gt; especially ones that wasted mana trying to knock me out of stealth with blizzard.
---
Lol, you ever heard of downranking bud?
---
I wouldn’t worry. Everything is pretty easy to play on classic. A lot of us played this “successfully” as children. Just pick something interesting, don’t look anything up and have fun. 
---
Plenty of us wish we could go in blind one more time.
---
I remember that I had binds on "12345\`qerfvcxz" plus the same with shift plus F1234 plus shift+F1234 for a total of 36 binds.
---
I also remember it was not enough for me and my shammy.
---
But I played more in TBC than in Vanilla so its possible I remember this state from TBC.
---
If you start with a druid and regeret it, you'll have a way to feed the more gear dependant warrior:)
---
I don't think you will though:)
---
ABC's to play WoW:
---
* Always be murdering.
---
* Buy bags when possible.
---
* Chat in /1 at least once per level
---
I agree, it was fun having dungeons be hard again after the face roll that was wotlk.  But people were too used to face rolling so it was wipe city.  Same concept for retail players jumping into wow.  If you think it's ok to not pay attention to pats and not use any cc with a low level tank, they going to disband.

It’s not clear to me if you’re being obtuse or you don’t actually understand these mechanics, so I’m going give you the benefit of the doubt.
---
Leeway and batching were brilliant fixes to network problems that existed 15 years ago. They were designed by the dev team to make the client feel, and this is the kicker, as if they were playing closer to technology that we had to today. People either miss or ignore this point. They were attempting to make the game behave like games behave today. They just couldn’t with given technology so they used these bandaid solutions. Does that make sense?
---
Between him and skarm, I decided to roll druid. You aren't the best healer nor the best tank or dps but you can pull off all 3 roles.
---
&gt; And every class was viable in every part of the game. 
---
/s ?
---
6 days is massive in the context of the average player. You're looking at the first 150 - 200 hours of your playtime while leveling to 60, which will occur over the course of several months for most. What everyone forgets is that vanilla is designed for the casual, not for the mythic raiding experience.
---
In PvP you have to talk about all part of PvP. Battlegrounds will not even exist for 3-4 months at launch so you'll be doing 1vX world PvP, if at all.
---
blizzard was NEVER reliable in getting rogues out of stealth.  NEVER.
---
I played a rogue from Vanilla all the way through wotlk.  As well as a mage alt during that time.  I distinctly remember very rarely ever getting pulled out of stealth from blizzard, even though on my screen it would look like I should have been hit by it.
---
That's not to say it should be that way moving forward for the best game possible....but it sure as hell how it used to work back then.
---
&gt; I'm hearing that in Classic the dungeon exp is much better--maybe **3-5X better**
---
Where did you hear that?
---
jesus... like what do you expect us to do?
---
You want to tank but the one tanking class you listed you dont want to play....
---
Depends on how severely they layer the starting zones etc. If you can get to 20 without having to fight for EVERY mob tag then you might be. If they don't layer that heavily and every mob is a competition then be ready for the long haul
---
aka main content
---
If you use anything other than Thottbot for loot planning, then you're doing Vanilla wrong...
---
Why do you say better for Horde?
---
3-5? hell no
---
But yes efficient dungeon clearing is actually pretty viable for slower classes like healers and melee.
---
mä elän vieläkin
---
If you care about min/maxing go gnome mage, the +int racial actually makes a difference. 
---
I'm a dwarf guy myself, but either one is fine. Dwarf has stoneform which is dope though. 
---
It comes down to whether you see yourself as more of a solo player or a group content player. Hunters are better solo, but mages are more desirable in groups.
---
Not at all, mages are mid tier at best and rogues are good, but depends highly on cooldowns. Both lose handily to shadow priest no matter how many cooldowns they have. Both have losing matchups against hunters and warlocks. Mage has a ton of trouble against shamans and druids. Rogue against warrior is very volatile. Balance/Resto and balance-heavy tri specs are very powerful in WPvP.
---
You are coming at it from a minmax raid-focused point of view but there is far more to the game than that. The vast majority of players will not see the 6 days played to 60 figure; more like double of that.
---
If you want to tank, your only choice is druid between those two classes.
---
Tanks are so overrated until you get to the actually fine tuned content
---
I can't weigh out the Druid visuals and game play vs Shaman. 
---
I don't know if I can make myself play Warrior; most of my time will be spent leveling and when I am geared enough I plan to help guildies toons through 5-mans to help level and gear them.
---
but would the aoe be okay with a tank gathering mobs together for you?
---
Same story, resubbed for beta and for getting a feel of the classes before Classic. I tried every class. Everything feels so different versus Classic and there is almost no variety between the classes except range/melee. 
---
Leveling is so boring because mobs dies almost instantly even without heirlooms. An Upgrade felt useless. No resource spending at all, rien, nada, nothing. No community / interaction due LFR and sharding. No thrill. I’m glad that I stopped after TBC. 
---
No retail for me, that’s for sure
---
Lul
---
I guess we have different definitions for viable. At least in PvE mine would be "Able to do Naxx".
---
The logic seems a little circular.
---
Yeah that's fair, I love diablo but if I wanted to play like that, then I'd just play diablo haha, it's a shame what wow has become but it's good that we have it coming back as it was, I'd even love to see tbc/wotlk content too tbh
---
;)
---
OP asked about resto druids. Resto druids have the lowest healing out of the 4 healing classes, and they don't have a standard ress.
---
My god
---
How is it different from typing? 
---
And voice technology is extremely complicated. Anyone capable of writing that kind of addon is a genius.
---
how messed up are crime servers that it is worth mentioning something like healers not being able to force their healed target into their fight
---
Enjoy the social aspect and the journey to 60. It is not a race. If you try power leveling to 60 then you will get burnt out.
---
hordescum /spit
---
I can see new players who have never seen a computer before taking 14 minutes if they do professions along the way.
---
I have no clue how I have to read that spreadsheet.
---
What does  2 out of 3 stars mean at 'average' and 'top level'? It's not really explained in the link.
---
Tfw you're playing Blizzard WoW classic and find yourself missing private servers. Damn this project could have been fucking amazing. The artificial delay, layering, and not fixing bugs dumps on the whole experience
---
I'd expect the rank to die to be honest at some points while leveling, If it was me I'd go frost just incase
---
Did you do any tests with mage AoE farming?  A lot of people will probably say "well this is how it is for pvp, but pve leeway is still broken."
---
Awesome work btw, thanks for your video.
---
Go play private servers instead of live then

Math people with their logic... smh

Mmm just curious, world PVP in a PVE server? I suposse if other faction pj flags itself as PVP it would be possible but... will PVE Server players do it? I mean... it doesn't seem probable to me. Maybe i'm wrong or i'm missing something? 0.o
---
You mean if I run strait into a wall in PvP with some chasing me....I'm gonna like....die?
---
Because that’s what we want and asked for. You hopped on the train too late.
---
Raiding is such a small part of the game. People meme that frost mage is one button, yet my level 40 beta mage has more keybinds I actually use than my retail mage. Raiding is something you only do for a few hours of the week the rest of the time you’ll be using that diverse kit.
---
What about #nochange or the fact that the opposite can not and should not understand you.
---
Full survival with a nightfall spamming wingclip
---
agreed, although you can't heal/tank you are a great solo leveler and always appreciated in groups.
---
Go on. The leveling part of vanilla is brilliant.  
---
Op was mainly complaining about end-game content. I don't see how he could not be disappointed. ST is level 45-50. There's no PVP phase 1. Dungeons are designed toward level 50-55. wPVP in 15 years I never saw more than the crossroad being attacked.  
---
End-game will be MC that's it. I just don't get those post like classic is going to be the second coming of the Christ.
---
Oh duh you’re right, my bad.
---
Looks like warrior is my go to for Tank for PVE and DPS off-tank for PVP. Can they be used for DPS in PVE? Also how do druids do in PVE/PVP, is it like jack of all trades but not a master? I remember feral druid being really good in PVP but that was after burning crusades.
---
no changes crowd been around since day 1. You got here a month ago. Thankfully you have no voice.
---
thanks!
---
I would love new content post-Nax, but my one concern is how to avoid the funneling effect. Prior to Naxx players would have BiS spread across pretty much all available content; but with new content comes the expectation of better rewards. If Blizzard only releases one zone and one raid at a time, we hit the current problem where only the new patch is relevant and everything else is forgotten. This makes the world feel smaller and more cramped. 
---
I think they’d have to release waves of content with multiple zones (integrated into the main continents like you said) with multiple raids (to keep people busy longer) and maybe the ilvl of the new loot isn’t much higher than Naxx stuff
---
I know. I lean towards tanking (heavily) but not 100% sold on it. Part of the appeal of tanking is lower group formation time.
---
Good bot
---
totally doable if thats what you want to do
---
personally if I had a pocket tank id go healer but nothing wrong with going fire mage, course at 60 you have to go back to frost anyway lol
---
Nice list. Unfortunate that most are so high level, though.
---
I know what it is and why they implemented it. They also mean to keep true to 1.12 which is what everyone has been asking for with no changes. Hence they're still there and working as intended. Does that make sense?
---
yw
---
Gathering is easy while levelling.
---
Blizzard applies a 75% slow for 5 seconds (I think with permafrost).
---
Fire can use Flamestrike (applies a dot on the area where it is cast, so not great to spam it) and Blast Wave (applies a daze for 6 seconds, 45 sec cd).
---
If a tank is able to survive the mobs and hold aggro, then it might work... But I don't think it would work well.
---
Frost is much more suitable to AoE.
---
I mained a NE druid in vanilla and TBC and did a lot of 5mans and raiding. Always like to encourage people to play druid since they're under represented.
---
Regarding your point on 5mans, it depends on what role you're filling. Imo, druids can reliably fill any role in 5mans but you would do well with carrying respective gear sets. their cons in 5mans are lack of cc, no aoe, and no res (other than rebirth/battle res). in end game raiding, if you're lucky you can be an OT, but more likely you'll be resto. 
---
druids are also a great leveling/solo class. tons of utility. I rarely saw downtime because I'm switching forms constantly. you get cheetah at level 30 which is great because that's around the time you're getting to stv and cheetah combined with cat helps a ton knowing the kind of experience you get in stv.
---
good luck!
---
It is definitely the same case in WoW that tanks, and healers, carry the most weight and responsibility in PvE. The only unique responsibility to DPS is managing threat and not pulling aggro.
---
Most classes only have 1, sometimes 2, viable specs that are considered truly *optimal* for pushing end-game content, with some discrepancies over a few talent points here and there. Here are some examples, which are purely from the perspective of PvE:
---
Warrior - Probably the only class in Classic that is arguably one of the best in 2 separate rolls. Best tank as Protection, and one of the top DPS as fury.
---
Paladin/Shaman/Druid/Priest - Pretty much any class with a healing spec is only *optimal* as a healer.
---
Rogue/Hunter/Mage - Any class that only has only DPS specs, really only has 1 truly optimal build for doing their max DPS in raids, with some small variations.
---
That said, if raiding isn’t your bag and you’re not super competitive, play what sounds fun. Hope this helps, happy adventuring!
---
Not OP, but they're straight from Blizzard: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/7870
---
I’d argue they’re the worst dueling (and definitely world PvP 1v1) class in the entire game.  They only have one gap closer on a long cool down which leaves them open to being kited by every other class in the game.  
---
Your best dueling matchup would probably be against a rogue since they’re the only other pure melee class in the game, and have to be in melee range to deal any real damage.  But they have so many ways to control a fight, or reset after you’ve burned key cooldowns that I’d still say they have the edge as well.
---
I'd wager we will see less than 20 total servers but I don't have any hard evidence to back that up
---
It's most likely a double tap macro that only casts Cold Snap when Ice Block is on cooldown.
---
Warrior is one of the worst AOE tanks especially at low level. A mage will pull agro in no time. 
---
Mage has three non cool down AOE spells. Flamestrike (initial damage plus DOT on the ground) Blizzard, Arcane explosion. As you can see fire doesn't have a spammable AOE, only Frost does.
---
What you could do is Warrior goes piercing howl talent and mage can flame strike into blizzard kite the mobs.
---
As a single target your warrior will not be able to hold agro either, he is there is distract and delay the mob while you nuke
---
Yeah that's the thing - it does seem like such a pedantic point to draw the line. I would argue loot trading and layering is way more game breaking than a very restricted guild bank.
---
Warriors
---
ya, which is why i thought go fire while i can then hop back to frost for awhile when it's forced.
---
Heh Skarm is what made me want to roll Warrior. I really want to try that Fury Tanking when im geared - looks fun.
---
Someone's in for a surprise in classic :)
---
Looks like a solid plan. What multiboxing software are you using?
---
&gt; most of my time will be spent leveling
---
Nah it wont, you'll just have to do it once, and then you'll be 60 forever
---
There's barely no end-game content? Dungeons are designed for under level 60. Min-maxing is useless for MC and with patch 1.12 itemization it can be cleared with 20 man. We are talking 3 hours a week max of raiding.  
---
What do you think your going to do level 60, seriously.
---
The Goblin Rocket Helm is bind-on-equip. Any engineer can use it, so you just have your Goblin friend or alt make it.
---
I was thinking I could still spam blizzard as a fire mage since i'm not as worried about the slow. Or is that just too mana intense/low dps without proper frost spec?
---
It's not possible.  
---
Voice chat works in groups and groups only, you'd have to dynamically form and disband parties/raids as players near each other, and the API doesn't allow you to do that. Also, even if it were possible, you'd hear everyone at the same volume regardless of how far they are and there'd be a limit of 40 people at once.
---
A guild bank won't make inventory space irrelevant though will it? If it's limited to having only 1 tab, and costs a tonne of money to unlock - IE 5k or something silly?
---
I did this on my vanilla Rogue.  Took herbalism and mining.  The I  did enchanting and engineering.
---
I thinks wise to go gathering professions early on, makes some easy money, get that mount, then at 60 switch to whatever you want for endgame
---
There are CC methods other than sheep. Icetrap, Sap, Root (to some extend), Fear (if you have room for it). Although i admit Icetrap and Sap are one time CCs.
---
Not to mention if you chose shaman, the best (only?) way you'd help your 5-man group is by healing, and you don't want to do it.
---
Looks like you took the "durids aren't needed" circlejerk advice to heart.
---
You'll have no problem finding raids as a resto druid
---
Go pray to the light, lapdog.
---
I remember when I was hyped. Fuck the stuff they are doing to the game has all but killed it for me. Classic was gonna be THE game for me, all my plans were revolving around it. Now I don't know what I'm going to do.
---
&gt; .81666666667 of an hour
---
is not microseconds. It's 49 minutes.
---
&gt; r/anime and r/pcmasterrace guy found out about classic last week, starts firing out brain dead opinions on reddit. 
---
cool.
---
This is great, just don’t stick anything related to the alliance or horde. You might get ran off the road.
---
I didnt do any test for aoe farming, but we did actually do a spell leeway test. Both characters standing still, cone of cold did not hit, both characters in a jump, and the cone of cold did hit. So Spell leeway is implemented aswell. But thats all we did, no range comparison or anything else. This was only a pvp test, so actually idk about pve.
---
so gathering is hard????
---
You forgot fishing in your list of mostly meaningless/wrong things
---
I wouldn't tout priests as the top tier healer.
---
They are the most versatile sure, but Paladins are better earlier and later priests only get better because of more raid damage to be honest so they aren't really "better".
---
I would find hpala boring personally but they are incredibly strong.
---
Many thanks
---
Fire does more dmg than blizzard.  Arcane Explosion does more damage than blizzard.  Fire Just does too much dmg and the tank won't be able to hold aggro in my opinion.
---
I stopped playing pserver too. Levelled two classes to 60 and I know everything I wanted to know before Classic. Anything I want to do at this point is pointless with Classic so close.
---
Gathering is simple.  Competition for limited resource is the issue.
---
&gt; You hopped on the train too late.
---
I was on since the beginning just hoped it won't be braindead reproduction.
---
Well, i think you should pick your professions from the start and level them, discarding a leveled profesión in classic hurts a lot, if you want engineering you have to start with it, one of the Best things it can provide you is an early helm, believe me is really Hard to get one before lv 30-40
---
Change movement keys to E-S-D-F and use S and F as strafe instead of turn.
---
Resto druid is all about proactive healing and timing on boss events (strong abilities). It's not a great reactive healer.
---
Tailoring can be done while leveling cause you use the cloth from the humanoids you kill. Engineering does not seem a good idea tough. You'll end wasting all your money on mats
---
Notice me josh senpai
---
This is the right answer to a daft question. Well, more a stupid place to ask than a daft question in and of itself.
---
I remember having a really hard time AoE grinding in vanilla, but it was definitely possible.  I just don't remember it being as easy as the private server videos make it seem.
---
Download the current game demo, play around a bit and see how it runs. It should be pretty much the same as how classic will run.
---
Russia
---
Ah the classic comb through post history to find something to latch on to when you have nothing to say.
---
I like that one, really high iq. Adds literally fuck all to discussion just like Canada adds to the world.
---
I'll be duo-leveling with a friend and he's going mining/engineering so we don't want to step on each other. Otherwise I'd do the same and drop mining for tailoring when I hit 60.
---
Careful of that rectangle of less tan in your face.
---
no doubt, do you man. I just don't get it, but I am 100% a quest text reader.
---
Great explanation, thanks. I didn’t know it only worked within group
---
Got a link?
---
It's not hard, but it can be time consuming
---
I just don't enjoy healing. I do love the class fantasy.
---
Yeah.... no. If you are a noob and just want to explore the world, level and enjoy the content, roll on a PVE server.
---
For every amazing/nail-biting/exhilarating PvP experience you have (and those ARE fun) there will be 9 times you'll be corpse camped/ganked. It's just too easy for high level players to "have fun" at your expense.
---
I really don't think warrior can hold aggro while you aoe and even if he can he might die against a group of mobs.
---
With no slow as fire you can't kite them.
---
Damage and mana would probably be a little bit worse since you mainly need to use spells you are not specced into (100% frost crit damage bonus, 6% frost damage, 20% blizzard radius, 15% mana cost and up to 10% crit chance is what you miss out on for blizzard)
---
It’s 3k population per layer, which is continent based. Considering 75% of the races share a continent for the starting zones, you’re looking at 300 people in Mulgore, 700 people in Tirisfal, 700 people in Darn, and 1300 people in Durator. 
---
Once you hit level 12, the barrens will literally have a couple thousand players. 
---
What’s even worse is when they collapse the layers and a server still has an active playerbase and you have 5000 player in swamp of sorrows. 
---
To put it bluntly, most people will be dungeon leveling, as everything else will be snails pace
---
Currently I'm between Hunter and Mage, for both PvP and PvE, but mostly PvP.
---
I mained a mage my whole life, I'm good at it, I like it, but I'm kinda tired of it, I love the idea of portals and stuff...
---
On the other hand, I love the RPG elements that Hunter has, looks fun and flashy at PvP, but it's DPS is middle of the pack and I like being at the TOP of the charts.
---
_I don't care about leeway since it's been always that way and could care less about currently hunter bugs_
---
I agree with the poster above, being able to have your war get away from mobs that are chilled would definitely come in handy in keeping him alive
---
Considering amount of people and the knowledge thwy have now - yes, might be harder then expected
---
I... Don't... Know...
---
This is mainly why I think that eye-humping meters is the mark of a poor RL. Meters give you an idea of output, but not necessarily the whole picture.
---
I'll just pick for you. Hunter. My flair has nothing to do with this choice ;)
---
DIE INSECT
---
I can see it now.
---
And truly the only class besides druid that is straight up mechanically insentivized to gank. Rogues are the best class for world pvp because you have a higher chance of escaping pvp incursions you dont have time for, and increased efficiency at killing enemy faction players "on sight" whihc is what pvp realms are all about.  
---
We do need to have an alt though, when things get too hot in tarren mill and you dont have a 60 to hop over to, you better have something else to do, haha.
---
A sound plan
---
I don't think I will be able to do much by myself when I have limited time to play.
---
Classic has lower requirements. If it can run retail, even on low settings, then will be fine for Classic
---
They already stated in multiple interviews a layer will hit vanilla server capacity and then create a new layer
---
Thanks for the info. I've been misled!
---
lol okay now i know you are a troll
---
Hold out brother. It's only 40 days left till you can quit your job and play Classic to skip all the traffic.
---
When I can get on for a few hours at a time and can group it would probably be okay but I think most of my time will be in 45min (or less) increments
---
[Please read this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c23tlc/i_spent_600_buying_old_pc_parts_to_benchmark_the/) that I made to help answer this question.
---
What the hell are you guys talking about? Mark Kern has specifically said that bosses have thematic armor and resistance values and not normalized at all. The 3k armor is a base armor value if the boss doesn't have any special armor values. Assuming that every boss will be a mage, a paladin, a warrior or whatever is completely made up.
---
They do pservers too. At least the one I played on
---
&gt; Often people will argue that hybrid classes could provide that utility as a healer and be more beneficial to the raid over-all. However, the inverse is also true: there are only 8 healer spots. If the raid needs an extra Tremor Totem, the DPS of an Elemental Shaman is more valuable than a 9th healer. 
---
said no raidleader, ever
---
you're right, but the people don't have your mindset. they rather take 12 healers and take longer to down bosses than giving in to meme specs
---
&gt;whos having problem’s with grammer
---
I think I know you’re trolling but omfg triggereddddddd
---
Lots of people do go double gathering, it helps to have mods if you plan to do that since you can only track one at a time. Skinning/Gathering, or Enchanting/Gathering is also fine.  
---
Engineering is fairly easy to powerlevel at 60, the hardest part will be the roughly 5 stacks of Mithril. You could always level Mining/Enchanting, or Mining/Tailoring.
---
Not sure if upvote cause druid or downvote cause filthy horde
---
Yeah that was exactly my problem - if I wanted a different game I would play that different game. I struggle with the idea of what should come after. The problem, imo, with releasing a tbc is that the only people interested would be the ones who were playing Classic and if too many leave, there's simply no way to justify keeping the Classic servers alive for the handful of hardcore guilds still running the content. Imagine if they redid Outlands as new 40-60 leveling zones and released the end-game content as level 60 content that goes along side Classic raids instead of a new tier of material. That would be the most interesting to me.
---
Just started listening a few weeks ago and can’t get enough of the podcast. Thanks for involving the community on all these interesting calls!
---
It wasn't for me (mining) and I did it during the stress test.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLxcMxsZZxxcRxq
---
Mana regen for sure.  You would go this tree early (if threat is not a problem), and once you had higher end gear pull 3 points from Gift of Nature and put them in the threat reduction (if threat ends up being sensitive).
---
It's basically a healing touch spam build.  
---
HT with moonglow costs close to priest's greater heal but with a bigger heal due to 100% healing contribution from gear and a higher base heal.
---
Gathering in private servers was bugged.  Some servers had dynamic respawns on nodes, some servers had 25 nodes in one cave.  This just won't happen in classic.  I remember it took me quite a while to get through mithril in a populated server "Burning Blade" on my warrior.  Was quite shocked I could lvl mining from 1-300 in about 3-5 hours on a private server.  So "Gathering is easy while leveling" is going to be a something people say if they  had no vanilla experience but had private server experience.
---
Thanks - this is exactly what my goal is )
---
I played shaman in vanilla and enjoyed it, sort of.  Raid healing was ok, though I resented it back then.  I like healers more the older I get.  The thing I did not like about playing redto shaman in pvp is that a warrior with a Paladin behind him wrecks your world.  Your cannot get away and are not that tanky.
---
50% increase on Classic by my estimation
---
Finally! I've been needing something new to listen to while I'm at work. Interested in the Winners and Losers piece.
---
Also classes use up their CD's to kite/stop you, but if you're still alive because of your pocket healrt and have rage can wipe them up once they are out of tricks.
---
!remindme august 27
---
So the Beserkering Buff is coded as if it said "Reduces cast time by 10-30%" as 1.43^-1 = 0.7
---
So you might actually say that the tooltip is wrongly worded, not that it is bugged. Whichever explanation you prefer.
---
I personally take no issue to this. If it is the vanilla way, it should stay that way.
---
I'll wait until they announce Servers before I commit to a Guild.
---
This is wrong. If you're not casting spells, why are you wasting talents on elemental when you can get Thundering Strikes, Improved Lightning Shield, Flurry, Elemental Weapons, Weapon Mastery, and Stormstrike from enhance?
---
Currently 79 active members.
---
I wouldn't waste the gold. Especially with a duo healer, I'd just stick to arms the whole way. You'll do fine damage and be able to tank instances.
---

In terms of class design for raiders
---
none of what you are saying matters
---
I was playing around on pservers about 6 months ago. I played a rogue 1-40 without interacting with other players, trying to get a sense of classic WoW as a single-player game (kinda like OSRS Ironman). I went skinning and herblore, vendoring all the leather. I didn’t buy out every learnable skill, nor did I buy anything from the AH, nor was I able to complete any dungeon quests.  I hit lvl 40 with 92g.
---
So, 5 paladins one goes ret.  2 druids 1 goes boomkin, 5 priests, 1 goes shadow.  That's three basically dead slots (though the shadow priest brings at least some value for your warlocks).  That has a notable impact on raid effectiveness because you either have to recruit more healers and run with effectively 1 less dps player, or you just run with 3 less healers.  
---
Druids and feral aren't a good example because it's a huge value to the raid to have an offtank that doesn't compete for gear with the main tank.  By comparison, ret paladins, enhancement/ele shamans, and Oomkin bring virtually no value to the raid.
---
And it doesn't matter if the other 9 Rets that applied didn't get in.  The paladins you have will be resentful that one of them gets preference on otherwise offspec loot as well as the ability to farm without respecting every raid.
---
For guilds that are casual and just decided to try out raiding, sure, it could happen.  But generally class spreads are similar in those guilds as general population, and it isn't the dps slots that are hard to fill, it's the healer slots.  And if you're looking for healers for a raid or healing is your sticking point, everyone is going to be pissed that there's a ret paladin doing less dps than the tank while the healers struggle to keep everyone alive.
---
What class/prof combination has the best potential for early goldmaking. I’d quite like to not be poor
---
I rolled Mage originally and did not even hear about aoe grinding or similar. I’ve thought Hunter might work due to speed of levelling and potential to farm. Maybe herbalist/skinner. 
---
Thoughts?
---
Thanks, this gives me a lot more to think about! The way you put it looks like shaman doesn't really have anything going for him other than PvP survivability? Which is not something I'll be considering. I never really cared about PvP until they added achievements in the game (yeah). I'd much rather run Uldaman for the 100th time than join an Arathi Basin fight for example.  
---
What does make shaman more difficult to manage? Is it just the totem twisting and mana issues? How required is totem twisting anyway? Because if I can just drop Windfury and not worry about it for 2 mins then the extra totem buttons aren't a big deal for me. Also, is there no reward for the more difficult to manage class?
---
It "reduces castetime and time between attacks" by 10-30% rather than "increasing speed" by 10-30%.
---
One could argue that the tooltip is just poorly worded.
---
I am not arguing anythign you are saying but I think you can take a better example then tremor totem.  
---
\&gt; If the raid needs an extra Tremor Totem, the DPS of an Elemental Shaman is more valuable than a 9th healer.   
---
Why would the raid need another tremor totem? Its pulses is about the same as a fear duration making the totem miss a lot of fears. As far as i know Tremor totem was close to useless in raids.
---
Yeah I know. Come Classic launch, new people are gonna come here and complain about the classes not being good.
---
For example people playing retail class Shaman and then coming here and complain why they don’t get to top dps meters in a raid.
---
I bet it’s gonna be like that. But I hope everyone will prove me wrong.
---
I hope we can copy over vanilla character to the following expansions TBC and LK , but able to keep the copied characters on their respective original realms as well as the new ones simultaneously.
---
That will be an automatic perk of playing classic.
---
Go bubble hearth away like you're good at.
---
Roots/NG is pretty solid, feral charge, bash too. It's no mage but it's not a paladin either
---
You won’t AOE grind well until you get Cone of Cold at 26.
---
Alternative wow timeline continued by alternative tbc🎉🤗
---
Druid vs shaman
---
You want to tank and don't want to heal? Shamans can't tank outside of extremely poorly when overgeared low level stuff. Druids are great 5 man tanks the entire time.
---
This isn't much of a debate.
---
Vanilla launched when I was 20 and in college. I had all the time in the world.
---
I’ll be 35 when classic launches, I won’t have the loads of free time that I did as a young adult, but I’ll still be able to make my way to 60 and do end game PVE.
---
Thanks! That wouldn't be nearly as many spells as I thought.
---
Yes, but you won't be helping anyone much in 5-mans by being enhance or elemental
---
Is "rushing" even possible? Hahaha
---
Don’t google anything unless you are completely stuck. Don’t rush. Ignore elitists. Play your game your way. 
---
I am jealous you get to lose yourself in Azeroth for the first time.
---
That's always been the case.
---
Hey just by curiousity sake where are u from
---
Leveling in wow is ont rocket sicence. Sure, it's a bit harder as a warrior than as a hunter, sure.
---
But it's not impossible nor does it require immense ammounts of skill. WoW is an easy game.
---
I hope that the community is as cool as it was when vanilla first came out.
---
got it right in the title, but the sticker is missing a '
---
I'm pretty sure an apostrophe would cost more money. Gotta save the dough for in-game gold.
---
Love joining you whenever I can! Thanks for having me on and look forward to the next time!
---
well they will come, bitch and then leave 
---
those are the tourists not the core players
---
Feels like there’s more keybinds but it’s a fine class and sounds like you have some mastery there

“!” And “?” On the mini map would be nice lol. That’s what everyone said about osrs but then the need for convenience became more important after everyone got their big hit of nostalgia

Hunters will be really good early on, then drop off. Mage will probably be slightly less good early on, then pull WAY ahead. I would say mage for sure, but you've played the hell outta the mage, so trying a hunter may be the way to go.
---
Your biggest concern should be that you chose the wrong faction and lost all dignity!
---
Ah that brings back memories, thank you
---
* Dude farming as Druid Resto is easy
---
* Step 1, have 23 points in Balance
---
* Step 2, fly to the other continent
---
* Step 3, have professions maxed out
---
* Step 4, farm this once spot in Felwood, assuming no one is doing the quests there or another Resto Druid
---
* Step 5, did I mention you need to have full water from mage available? 
---
Meanwhile a Hunter could just log on, go to Tyrs Hand and farm the Scarlett Mobs straight after 60
---
that won't work because it has windows 10 in S mode, which means you can only install apps from the microsoft store.
---
The leveling is entirely different but not generally better. Retail you can level with a friend while classic if your friend goes to the bathroom your behind in chain quest. 2 level difference and you can't level together anymore.  Leveling alone for 3-4 months is not the best thing.   
---
There's no hardcore content. I have pugged naxx many times. The hard thing to do is finding 40 player. That's pretty much it. Mythic raiding is a challenge.  
---
What you are describing is RP servers.  
---
Why you think I leveled 5 warriors, why you think I'm leveling fishing and cooking. Wow classic is just an incredibly long grind aka Runescape.
---
Ah that makes more sense, in my head the macro is casting ice block and cold snap with one button press.
---
Druid for sure from your description. But both classes are primarily healers at 60.
---
well you dont need mining you can always buy the mats you need
---
or you can get engineering leveled then drop mining
---
The flying was gated behind rep, not the raid release. 
---
And why are you surprised that the gear in the raid was "better" than the gear you could farm alone in the world? 
---
If anything the problem is that some of the world gear actually is better than raid gear, which is very strange. 
---
But yeah, a lot of the problems you talk about I think everyone feels. Most "traditional" mmo-players who still play BfA are probably like me and do it for the raids and dungeons, and we do it despite a lot of the other crap. Then there are a whole bunch of BfA players who are playing the game for entirely different reasons, they mostly run around collecting mounts/pets/transmog/achievements/whatever. Which is a completely different game from classic WoW for example.
---
Ele/Resto is viable through all phases, you don’t need to hope. Mana tide totem is not good enough to justify going deep Resto. You will be in a melee group anyways, unless the raid leader is going to bounce you between groups to give the priests mana tide totem the only person that benefits is you. Might as well just pot/runes and be able to farm and blow people up in pvp and heal as good as deep Resto.
---
Hmmh, I'd rather go with lv51 elite zones. Fully epix players could solo that content meanwhile lv50 players could do that in party. Quest rewards could be bop without level restrictions to maximize the availability and appeal of the content. Everyone wins!
---
And besides that, broadband overtook dialup in the US back in 2005. People with a solid connection were the majority on NA servers for half of vanilla.
---
Is that worth it in the long run? Or would lvling tailoring from the start be the best choice?
---
If you plug a motherboard into a potato it should run classic. Where you have a $400 budget, try to aim for 8g ram, integrated graphics, and win 10. That’ll get the job done but you’ll want to run it on low settings.
---
It's been proven that this was an unintended "bug" in 1.12 and only got fixed in the next expansion, unfortunatelly... before 1.12 it didn't share a DR.
---
Ninja loot accusations are everywhere. Proof is always needed, otherwise it just falls on deaf ears. Trade chat spam doesn't work - this is what the forums/discord servers are for. Post the proof, or GTFO.
---
What part of the word addon do YOU not understand?
---
And yet if you can't gear them, it doesn't really matter. It's smarter to raid MC/ony/BWL with a healthy distribution of classes so everyone gears up.
---
Unless you're a server first competing guild and have the freedom to scalp geared players from other guilds, it's smarter for your raid to have a more even distribution.
---
It's also strange how those buffs you listed only require one of those classes anyway, much of it rather useless in a raid environment or padded with. The exact argument you make for not taking the "less viable" classes.
---
Ultimately it doesn't matter what you think. Class composition *will* be a secondary/tertiary consideration for most guilds that aren't at cutting edge progression. 
---
Most people will just be looking to have fun and the primary problem will be attendance and group organization, not how many warriors/mages you can stack.
---
They're not the fastest levelers, in fact probably one of the slower ones. Definitely slower than warlock, Hunter, druid, and mage. Kinda mana inefficient.
---
It's alright, just try it out. Keep in mind their damage is pretty good while leveling but drops off a cliff at 60, so don't get the idea that you are Keanu shaman that unlocked the secret to shaman dps. We all thought that.
---
I saw a car with a horde emblem on it yesterday. Was kinda surprised.
---
I purchased the month of wow time using my gold with the intention of checking out the new patch but I actually never did any of the content. Instead of use my remaining gold to buy a wow token and then logged on occasionally to grind for materials to purchase more wow tokens. So basically I only played just so I can fund future months of classic. Hell it'll be even better if everybody stops playing retail and the price of wow tokens go down
---
on youtube Nobbel87 does alot of lore videos and MadSeasoShow has a video about the history of the game and has been chronicling some of the early patches
---
Gamed literally every day for 5 years in college for 6-9 hours/day. Now working 8-5 @ a corporate level &amp; only able to play ~2-3hrs/day given no GF aggro. Still scratches the itch but idk if I can raid like I used to. 
---
I am naturally drawn to leadership roles so I  thinking about starting a leveling / CASUAL (disgusting...I know) Guild &lt;Day Laborers&gt; for those that have a day job but want peeps to raid/level/dungeon with that are understanding of their obligations.
---
you can but there is plenty of money in Mooncloth hoarding. I can't remember any good early recipes to craft though
---
No, Robes of the Archmage are BiS until P3, so if you want those you need tailoring at launch
---
5 % crit is questionably better than 5 parry. And Tactical Mastery is leaps and bounds better than unbridled wrath.
---
Back on pc so I could freshen up my mind with the 1.12 talent calc as well. 
---
This is your fastest leveling spec maxing elemental talents first:
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/4520015000301-050523001500315](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/4520015000301-050523001500315) 
---
You want to cast Lightning Shields and rank 1 shocks hoping for clearcasting after which you can freely cast a max rank shock, also getting the increased crit damage from elemental. Crits will give you 9% melee crit and you have a big stoneclaw soak for multipulls or tougher mobs. Keep flametongue up on the fast dagger. Searing totem for longer fights. Avoid agility btw.
---
You’re in the classic WoW subreddit. Not the compare Classic WoW to some game no one cares about subreddit. That’s my personal take — couldn’t give less of a shit about retail. Haven’t played it in a decade and have no plans to. It’s a completely different game in a new era. Not for me.
---
The fact that you think any DPS other than Arcane Mage even cares about mana kind of shows that you don't know how the game works right now. You're also way oversimplifying, and if we want to play that game. Then vanilla is just rogues/feral druids energy + combo points, warriors/bears builder + spender, everything else mana users. This is actually more accurate than what you've said about retail, and clearly has less differentiation.
---
Also, I read another comment of yours saying it's not "fair" to compare classic to retail because they've been putting a lot of effort into making the specs more differentiated. Well, which is it? Is retail all the same paradigm or is it differentiated? Why can you say retail is worse because it's not differentiated but classic is just great the way it is?
---
It's okay if you like classic more but don't come in here and spout a bunch of nonsense where you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Definetly herb/skin. Bank alt with enchant.
---
Early as in lvl 30-50? Aoe Farm is great as a mage but later on other classes can farm dire maul. Locks can juggle 3-4 targets too.
---
I enjoy leveling professions up as I level. It will steal some of your time but it breaks up the monotony sometimes. I say this but might not bother at the beginning of launch. Probably for my second toon because my first one I'll want to rush to 60
---
 New content has worked out really nicely for OSRS
---
Thrall gave the warchief position to Garrosh who didn’t want it, said he had no idea how to do anything but war, and then fucked off to be green jesus, then cheated to kill Garrosh after losing his weapon in his duel.
---
My guess for a given faction. Mage &gt; Warrior &gt; Paladin &gt; Shaman &gt; Lock &gt; Rogue &gt; Priest &gt; Hunter &gt; Druid

Rouge is a cosmetic product for women

While others have pointed out that you need to be near your AT2020, you have leeway on how near you need to be.
---
My brother's AT2020 boom setup, it's about 1.5 to 2 feet from his face normally, about 3 to 3.5 feet when he leans back.
---
My Blue Yeti desktop setup is similar, about 1 to 1.5 feet normally, about 2 to 2.5 feet when I lean back (my chair purposely doesn't recline).
---
Both cases, you can hear our voices crystal clear. A little louder sometimes, a little quieter sometimes, but still crystal clear.
---
You can see this on youtube channels when they show off their setup - their mic is normally 1 to 2 feet away, to get it out of the camera.
---
Read Quest text. Check your map. Use Google if you can't figure it out.
---
Leveling is only engaging in todays WoW, when you do it as an advanced Skype conference. You cant die while leveling and it is really, really easy.
---
If I want truly hardcore content in the sense of skilled gaming I play Overwatch, PUBG or Fortnite.
---
Hardcore can be used in various contexts. Do you need a year of moderate gaming to obtain the Winterspring mount? It can be seen as hardcore if you count time investment and dedication into your hardcore perspective.
---
Is today's raiding hardcore? Yes, from a skill based factor. But personally I never liked playing WoW for the skill above a certain threshold. 
---
That's why I jumped ship when gear did not give an edge anymore in WoD. Templates literally broke the camels back for me.
---
What I'm describing is private PvP servers. I did PvP on Kel'Thuzad german server back in the day.
---
But I got my taste for mass PvP on recent pservers like Nost, LH, ND etc. 
---
Stuff like this:

---
This really has nothing to do with RP servers and more with people enjoying world PvP using their PvE and PvP gear to the full extent.
---
There's *always* someone that does the math!
---
I never said it was wrong
---
In classic i ran out of mana multiple times and couldn't kill more than one mob
---
In retail I never ran out of mana and was pulling multiple mobs with no risk to myself
---
Should put "Classics front" on the hood.
---
It happens when you run forward and strafe at the same time. It angles the cone a lot more to the left/right than what inexperienced players would think.
---
Der NealZ? #frostwolf im irc. Hier ist Keule
---
I agree with you. I just dont like how everyone is using "is xx spec viable". Anything can be viable but everything will absolutely not be optimal. People see a post like OPs and are getting all worked up thinking they wont be able to find a guild to raid with because of what spec they want to play. If the post was "List of optimal specs for high end competitive raiding" or something it would make more sense. However like I said about the dead horse this information is already everywhere. You could throw a rock and hit a post, guide, video, or podcast that talks about it.
---
It also depends on your goals. If you want to be in a hardcore raiding guild that is downing bosses the first week or two a raid is available obviously you're going to have to use an optimal class with one of the cookie cutter specs.
---
However there are a couple exceptions, like the feral dps out there that farm tons of manual crowd pummelers, consumables, and BiS gear and are putting out some amazing numbers.
---
A $400 dollar laptop is not going to be great. At that budget you would be better of fixing or replacing your old desktop.
---
Okay thanks! And just have an alt save all the cloth I get for later?
---
You’re a barrel of laughs mate
---
I have no idea, what the usual raid lineup is going to be. For my guild at the moment we are a little short on paladins but have plenty of priests, all of them seem to want to heal. With druids (have a bunch of those) it is about 50/50, heal/feral, but from what I've seen in chat, the furry kind seems to understand that depending on requirement for tanks they are going to heal/decurse in some fights - not sure what spec they are going to be, apparently there are a few options for hybrid specs for druids (hotw/ns for example).
---
This is a casual guild btw., we don't have any aspiration to blow through the content as fast as possible, but to have fun. So far, it looks pretty good, we will see how it ends up at release or a while later when we might get started with raiding.
---
So from my experience so far, these so called meme specs are the exception of the rule, most players actually want to play the generally accepted spec.
---
Encounter design isn’t given enough credit for how different specs were valued. Itemization is culpable, too.
---
There's a misconception about ele/resto. Sure is a relatively balanced in the same way that a prep rogue can dps or an ms warrior can tank. Truth is, you don't want to be in a guild that allows for pvp spec's during progression. Those guilds wipe more and get stuck on fights for weeks. Only once the raid is on farm status should people be off specs. Mana tide totem is essentially a second mana potion for you and your party. Yes, most shamans will be with melee but that you're still gimping yourself.
---
But then it doesn't work like a gold drain lol, you are contradicting yourself.
---
I respect your opinion, I think most universally put priests in "S" tier with pallies right being in an "A" tier. I personally am going to level a druid and will likely heal, and because I'm a good player I'll be successful. That's my main takeaway, but figured id let the OP know what was universally regarded as best. My final point is that in order to be a holy paladin you'd have to be an alliance, which automatically moves it to F tier. XD
---
Rated bgs would be nice tho. Love them a lot more than arenas.
---
What's more important to you, playing with your SO or playing the optimal class?
---
I never got kicked out of a random group. Just do top dps.
---
&gt;This is a very different dynamic from classic where you get an epic and it can last a very long time, some the entire game
---
Yeah, but the "weeks of work" you put in before raid release would be equivalent to doing quests in classic. Obviously raid drops are going to be better. 
---
But yeah, they reset gear levels every new raid/season. Which sucks if you are a new player starting just before a new release (especially if you are not aware of the reset). It's a lot of fun as a long time player though. Since you get a whole new "gearing up" phase, which would otherwise not happen, you would just get the occasional upgrade from the new raid and have very little else to do in the game. Now instead I get to run dungeons again for gear, and even do some world content and stuff like that and actually get something out of it. 
---
Modern WoW has a very "seasonal" design. Every content release you get to work on gearing up your character again and beating the new bosses, then towards the end of a patch you don't do much more than raid log or maybe push keys, because you have basically "finished" all the content.
---
you are making huge assumptions here, Im saying the guild leader was obsessed with being top 5 on a server that only had 5 guilds, i couldnt care less what we placed, he sucked all the fun out of it for many other players too actually.
---
If he had big ambitions of being in a hardcore mythic raiding guild he was on the wrong server.
---
Hunters are the best solo dungeon farmers but warlocks are a close second.
---
These are all arguments as to why 50G respec will suck as a gold drain because it's way too fucking expensive.
---
GoRemy. A legend. What a different time. I think that even all these years later, the songwriting here is some of the best of any WoW music video.
---
its a band aid to the fact that they have huge amounts of powercreep. The end of legion was a joke, BFA is on the same course
---
What
---
&gt; Maybe you should look into it.
---
&gt; AM only puts the target in combat. And if you put a NPC target in combat, it will also put you in combat, which is why it looks like AM triggers combat at first damage tick on NPCs. Techically it's the NPC that puts you in combat and not AM, just like an NPC would put you in combat if you run too close.
---
&gt; AM does not put you in combat, first missile or not. It didn't even work this way in earlier iterations of the game. It's clearly a bug that was introduced some time after this patch.
---
&gt; So fixing this would'nt even be #changes any more than using 1.12 AV is #changes. It would just be using the non broken version of AM from an earlier patch.
---
Thank you. I agree with everything here. Fixing it back to its non-broken version just makes perfect sense to me. I hate that we literally are being given imperfections just because they were there at some point.
---
I didn't say that or anything like that, but people are already reacting to procs even in vanilla (omen of clarity).
---
yeah save the cloth and send it you your bank alt
---
there are some nice items you can make at 60 with tailoring
---
Aka content that 5% of the playerbase interacted with regularly in Vanilla. It was end game content, and few experienced it. It was certainly not the main content, nor did the designers view it as such. Rightfully so.
---
I can’t wait to spaz out
---
I know. What a shame. Comedy allows us to laugh ourselves; to laugh at our own humanity. To see our flaws, even if exaggerated, and chuckle in the face of them. "It's funny because it makes you uncomfortable." That's comedy!
---
Anyway, I grew up loving his videos. His McDonalds rap is one of my favorites as well.
---
He is somewhat right - maybe hyperbole. In retail WoW the fast acquisition and replacing ofngear invalidates the need to put any love or effort into your character. Gearing is in a lot odnways just rolling 3 slot machines and hoping they all come up bells. The biggest problem with retail is that your work is quickly invalidated by RNG or catch up mechanics. It makes the game feel hollow.
---
Classic does not exactly have this problem. The gearing and professions generally rewards hard work. His point is that it MC is too easy (or T2 and even T3 content) that will have the same impact as the gearing in retail. Why grind out hours of pre-raid BiS when you can face roll the raid for gear as soon as you hit 60 and have some decent gear? Why bother leveling certain crafting professions for gear that will be replaced with 2 hours of work a week?
---
There's a lot of posts on here about how we will have to grind consumables for hours before raid and such, and while some of that is true it is hyperbole at best. I cleared all T2 content in Vanilla in organized pugs with only knowing about half of that stuff existed and was generally top of my role. I had little to no idea what I was doing at the time and found the content appropriately challenging. Now I am armed with about 10+ more years of mythic raiding experience on significantly more difficult content...
---
I think the concern that the end game will be too easy is a valid and very large one. If it is far too easy it will invalidate a huge portion of the game - much of which seems to be celebrated here - in a similar albeit different way than retail already does.
---
Ya... I hope blizzard can fix all these hunter issues. Hunter discord is a pretty depressing place atm.
---
IMO PvP servers for sure if you're really into that "living in a world" immersion feel. But if you're super casual save yourself the time and roll PvE.
---
Classic will be delayed 2 more months mark my words
---
Warrior is the class that most accurately meets your wants list. The leveling process isn’t exactly fast. You’ll have plenty of time to learn the class tanking dungeons all the way up. There are some good guides to tanking to help fill in the gaps.
---
You won’t be maintanking a 40 man on your first day out. Don’t worry, go with your gut.
---
Hay, but if you look pasture point and pony up to the idea of a long trot to a single mob, the only people spurred enough to cry foal will be everybody, so... I just hope the servers are... stable.
---
horse.
---
Totally with you. Ruins the whole game. Might not even play anymore.. good job killing all my hype Blizzard.
---
Pretty sure my race faction and server swaps alone far exceed that estimate
---
You can play on the retro server and jump right into 60 with any class and full gear.
---
dont speak such rot!
---
This I can respect
---
If you played DK in Eso and want something similar play warrior. If you played Templar and want something similar play paladin.
---
With your post you sound like a warrior. Good burst and excellent tanks.
---
It was me.. filthy horde scum
---
Groundbreaking stuff.
---
It's not a different dynamic.  What gear from MC are you getting that you're still using through Naxx?  
---
BoD came out in January.  There was a raid after BoD that dropped better gear, and now we're in the next raid.  This is the equivalent of right before the Naxx drop, you start raiding MC, then go into Naxx and are upset that you're replacing T1.
---
You've earned yourself a subscriber. I saw the titles of your other videos and I can't wait to watch all of them as well :)
---
Rolling a holy Paladin to heal my world pvp gank squad (warrior, warlock, hunter, holy Paladin, disc priest coming to a DM entrance near you).
---
That is not the fastest at all lol. Your entire build relies on a 10% proc so you can cast a max level shock for free. The amount of mana you're wasting on rank 1 spells that deal no damage just to get that proc probably costs more than the mana you're saving from a "free" cast. You're better off just casting max level shocks in enhance, if you run out of mana, you still have melee to fall back on with all your talents being focused on melee dps.
---
Mal’Ganis Horde was interesting. BG queues were brutal but I believe they were always instant for Alliance.
---
Yeah I kind didn't understand the jetpack rage lol... Its literally a item you find in the floor..
---
People like to bash retail with other experiences in mind, not the ACTUAL retail.
---
The game itself is not that bad, it's just different. For me its STILL the best MMORPG out there.. Even compared to FFXIV (which is being praised right now, but I feel its a Single Player game with MMO aspects)
---
Of course Classic its a better game, but Retail have qualities.
---
On mobile and accidentally deleted my comment.. to summarize, I made fun of you for mocking someone that knows something you don't. I also included a YouTube link: https://youtube.com/watch?v=xrJ56pzDExc
---
I’m pretty sure soul link can’t be purged in 1.12
---
And if it can Recasting costs less mana than purge.
---
80% of posters are flaming a-holes. If 80% are going horde that may be a little incentive to go blue.
---
Sap is not reliable, nor able to be reapplied, and requires exact timing to not completely nuke the rogue applying it (brings you out of stealth and can't be applied in combat). It can be used, but it's a non trivial task to coordinate. Roots is limited to melee mobs in outdoor zones, and is still subject to spell hit/resists (druids are resto in vanilla).
---
I will always upvote this. I remember watching this live back in the day. Used to come home from work and catch all the G4 stuff. Man i can't wait for classic.
---
Trolls have battle health regen and beserk to help build rage and agro. IMO they are a bit better for tanking than orc. Also I’d only go engineering if you plan on pvping a lot. Takes a lot of money investment and as a tank you’ll be strapped for money as is
---
For all we know they moved the mythic whatever thing to fill the content gap hole that classics intended release left
---
 Melee hunter gonna b a big thing. So surv bb
---
Yeah a macro that casts Ice Block and then Cold Snap is impossible in one press.
---
Hunter 1 to 10 is not the worst they don't even get the worst /played 1 to 10 and on top of that warlock are not even the fastest 1 to 10 time (shaman are)  your picking a class based on where you will spend the first 2 hours of your played time rather then the next 5 days makes zero sense.
---
Engineering BOP's are very nice later on. The shield that does aoe damage especially. Why not roll both? Start mining Engineerign and swap to enchanting from mining later when you have an alt for mining possibly. 
---
Orc warrior is good for dps, but Troll is good for tanking.
---
I'd say Orc is the clear winner on a pvp server or for a pure dps, but troll is a better pve tank. 
---
Orc isn't as clearly amazing as Human is for Alliance, but it is really good.
---
the amount of rage you get off critting is better than the amount of rage you get off slightly faster parry hasted autos, and better than the trickle of rage from anger management. Tactical mastery doesn't become relevant until you get zerker stance anyway and by then you're just about ready to swap to arms anyway for MS at that point. 
---
until then, Enrage is wayyyyyy better than imp overpower and the impale tree, since impale and deep wounds really dont do that much till you have good gear and crit a lot, as opposed to enrage which will always be boosting all your hits, crit or otherwise
---
Enchanting/Tailoring
---
Honestly orc is better for pvp due to stun being more prevalent.
---
Also in.
---
Shaman was the only class I leveled to 60 back in the day, and I'm rolling it again because I had fun with it. I leveled as enhancement, which was fine, but for me the real fun started when I respec'd to elemental after level 40. Zapping stuff with chain lightning feels goooood. I'm switching it up this time and leveling ele/enh hybrid until I eventually respec ele/resto.

Thank you! You are the hero we need
---
Good to know xD
---
When you compare it to the 10 years we already waited it does not seem so bad.
---
&gt; Rockbiter is excellent up to Windfury, and still quite good afterwards, but getting Windfury procs is just so satisfying.
---
And dagger + flametongue with a shield is the real deal.
---
That's basically my complaint. WoW is a pretty great *game* but at the expense of the roleplaying world immersion.
---
Never tell me the numbers kid
---
Mage is the golden child of Vanilla.
---
I'm in the same boat but for PVE. I played mage from BC through Wrath as a hardcore raider and while I could do it again I kind of want to do something new. Hunter is what I played cata onwards, so I was thinking hunter, but all the bugs are giving me a bit of pause.
---
Also mages are just so amazing!... Ugh it's hard.
---
I am able to play private servers on my old ish MacBook Pro 13 inch with onboard graphics at 30 FPS minimum
---
The main thing to note about this though, some of the time, mages don’t really need tanks
---
Whilst this is obviously pserver clips, the essence of what I’m trying to say is in here.

yaeh thank god he doesnt have a voice so the mini map shows dots instead of question marks and theres no text wrapping when you track a quest! Yessssssss

I want the engineering for world pvp as I lvl up tho. I plan on going a pvp server

You'll often have a class with a normal rez in 5 mans anyway.

I'm leveling a druid primarily with a priest buddy who plans to do shadow and heal when we cant find a healer, so even if I am healing, and he's dpsing we still have teh rez's
---
2005: In high school, girlfriend, and part time job but most of my buddies played WoW and we gamed all the time. Played through Cata and quit right before Pandaria.
---
2019: Married, wife, full time job and unfortunately it doesn't look like any of the old friends are going to jump back in :( (or not yet anyway). I will be able to game maybe a few hours during the week and a few hours on the weekend. Looking forward to taking my time to 60.
---
Hoping that I can at least convince 1 or 2 of the friends to come back. You don't quit WoW you just take breaks.
---
Hammer of wrath now! Bubble hearth activated!
---
Kings honor, Friend!
---
You bind it to sonething else. Like alt mousewheel up/down. Seriously mousewheel is one of the best keybinds. For me personally its my favorite, i try to bind them to thibgs that make sense to me. Mousewheel up is always blink/sprint or other movement abilites, in retail i play DK and deathgrip is mousewheel down (this one not only makes sense but is really satisfying to me)
---
Drop the tailoring and get mining
---
At 60 drop mining for herbing
---
To be honest if you want the lowest group formation time you would have to be a druid since they can do all roles poorly, except tanking they do that excellently.  Watch Skarmtank on youtube or the recent interview kargoz had with skarm.  He really made me want to roll a druid alt to tank instead of warriors.
---
Classic's back, back again. 
---
Classic's back, inv a friend.
---
She married and became a singer. She was pretty decent too. Not sure what she is up to these days, but man that girl was 16 year old me's dream girl.
---
Orc. What are warlocks weak too? Rogues and Warriors. And both of those like to use stuns and orc will let you resist 25% of said stuns helping you out immensely in countless pvp fights. (Also 5% pet damage helps in pvp if you use Succubus)
---
you can enjoy summer 
---
its scheduled to release at the very end of summer
---
&gt; also damn near immunity to dot spells once you get grounding totem, as long as they don't have a direct damage component.
---
The what now?
---
Classic's\*
---
Panic?
---
I have a question regarding Paladin (I don't want to play one, just wondering)?
---
Paladin's if I'm not mistaken, their biggest issue come raiding was gaining enough threat. I was reading in another post that TF generates a ton of threat if a prot pally somehow got thunderfury, would that make up for the lack of threat they can generate or no?
---
I’ve been playing BFA on a 7 year old laptop (think it’s got 4gb ram) no idea CPU wise but it runs the game at a nice 40-60 FPS on a low/med graphic setting. I’d imagine if it works fine on current it’ll be fine for classic?
---
Im thinking about a work around, on mobile right now, will see if what im thinking would work when i get home.
---
No Ragrets
---
That, in a nut shell, is how I felt when BC came out......and ruined me for just about every game out there.......soon as I hit the "never ending grind for slightly better upgrades" I quit and play something else till the next DLC/expansion comes out cause it makes all your hard work meaningless
---
A while after my first guild broke up I rolled a level 1 character on a friend from that guild's new server in TBC. He summoned me to Shatrath so I could set my hearth there, and I decided to corpse-run to Serpentshrine Cavern. There I saw some people dueling, and I was a ghost. I then ressed and punched the losers last hitpoint off. I remember logging back in to check how much honor? (was honor still in then?) I got for killing a 70 at level 1 and it might have been 17?
---
&gt; the biggest spikes in upgrades should be early on in endgame progression
---
That is still the case. Progression just resets every raid now, instead of every expansion.
---
Paladin.
---
I was only talking about leveling time 1-10.
---
it should of never reset
---
Damn! I was hoping to use the 2 free days they gave us to test it out :(
---
That's a sweet story. I've always said that a mage should be able to tank Onyxia since it's mostly fire damage. Just put on some fire resist gear and some defense gear, and then pop improved fire ward and just magic missile away.
---
Trolls look like crap, roll Orc or Tauren
---
Nothing is certain but it seems like druids will out TPS a warrior and warriors are by far the most tankiest of all three of them, a paladin only really shines on some 6+ mobs compared to warriors or druids but since aoe tanking is not really needed compared to having maximum threat or maximum survivability paladins are really really really bad raid tanks
---
Translation: We've reached the conclusion that our infrastructure isn't ready for millions of logins on opening day, and we're in "oh shit" mode.
---
Not me i have a 144 HZ screen atm buy i suggest you go buy that new monitor and relive classic graphics on your new screen :)
---
I did in fact buy a razer trinity for the 7 mouse buttons on the side.
---
I am a clicker gamer so will have to get used to these 7 buttons.
---
lol i dont like it thats why im not playing? like what...
---
also in classic ilvl did not matter as much as it does now.
---
Retail you always take the higher ilvl item. Classic things like blackhands breadth and lionheart helm are bis the entire game
---
Why do people seem to think there's no money in crafting leveling gear in vanilla?   A fresh server is going to have a demand for lower level crafted stuff.  I think some people are going to be disappointed with the lack of income in double gathering professions when there's no max level people buying mats in bulk to go 1-300 in their crafting.
---
This is not a first person shooter game, you can type and click spells while doing your leveling or farming. 
---
As to friends you already have discord and group/raid voice comms. The proximity voice would make the game toxic, racist experience since there is no "voice logs" .
---
been there done that.  maybe you can try gathering in the next stress test too if you still feeling like, "fite me I'm rite."
---
Tremor can be killed, hell you can be feared within the pulse window and run out of range.  It also wont clear a death coil, giving a warlock time to kill them totem then reset fear, and if you are enh you are probably never getting back in melee range.  Then felpup can both eat your shock debuffs and CS your nature tree.  That fight is so one-sided and you dont even need to be SL to win it.  Not that any warlock goes SL while lvling.
---
I've done 30 man cthun in naxx gear so fair point.
---
Or any class for that matter...
---
Mankrik's wife is located aproximately due south of Crossroads, about halfway to Camp Tauraho (sp?), next to little huts a bit west of the main road.
---
There, now you can spend your chat time in the barrens coming up with new chuck norris jokes.
---
...I wonder how reliable this would be for honor farming?
---
&gt; Keep in mind their damage is pretty good while leveling but drops off a cliff at 60, so don't get the idea that you are Keanu shaman that unlocked the secret to shaman dps. We all thought that.
---
This is basically every meme spec discussion on this sub boiled down to a couple sentences. Nobody is saying you cant or shouldnt do it, we just want you to know the truth before you delude yourself for 6 days /played.
---
Sure, it's a mini-raid, but first boss drops 420 mythic gear, second drops 425.  BoD mythic was 415 base ilvl.
---
Regardless, you're still complaining about replacing gear in a higher tier raid - which is what should happen.  I don't think BLUES being better than Naxx epics is a better model.  
---
Keep in mind a major difference here is that in Classic, when you get your BiS....you're done.  There will be no upgrading, no new gear, no plans for ever expanding Classic.  If you want to do an UBRS/BRD run and get Blackhands Breadth and HoJ on week 2 and have trinket slots compete for the rest of the games existence, then I guess you're good to go.
---
Go Warlock as alot of people seem to be rolling priests and alliance warlocks are rare compared to horde warlocks
---
Still though, the point is that you were definitely the rational one and most people will trust you over people who spam slander. It still is shitty cause one or two people will just ignore your message but overall if you can explain yourself without just fighting back people will usually side with you on forming groups.
---
As a p server veteran I can't wait for this. So much fucking about on there man.
---
That is what you said, but maybe you just didn't know that what you said has very specific meaning in game design terms. For example, The trinkets are not a deck based system, they simply have a number of different power levels at which they activate randomly and that's represented by a deck but it's not a deck based system. Outlaw rogues in retail have a system where they "roll dice" to determine what buffs they actually get but that's not a dice based system any more than any random system is.
---
A deck based system would be where you have a deck of abilities but only certain ones are available at a time, and those that are available are random. Typically you'd cycle through "hands" of available abilities. A deck builder just means you'd have some measure of control over the "Cards" and therefore the probabilities. A dice system as an entire class mechanic would just mean that the things you can do for some period of time are random.
---
I'm interested to hear it if you've got any specific ideas. I've heard a lot of neat ideas over the years, and most of those have ended up being implemented in some fashion into one of the specs in retail WoW. There are specs that depend on procs, specs that rely on cooldown cycles and burst windows, or burn and replenish phases. Even the most builder/spender specs I can think of have an aspect of buff or dot management. At their core they are mostly builder/spenders but the details of the implementation make them more unique.
---
I'm so stressed I feel like I'm going to break into a thousand different shards. This phase is difficult trying to stay strong
---
its not the never ending grind, its the rapid pace and complete and total reset of gear. I like having upgrades to pursue, but not on the level of retail
---
I used to pvp in the 19 bracket which was very developed. Hunters and rogues dominated that bracket. There used to be a horde guild &lt;Pokemon&gt; that we queued against all the time and they were the best around. 49 is also a very popular bracket because you hit the end of talent trees, you have mounts, and you get your armor upgrades.
---
I read somewhere that if a paladin judges light on the boss, then all healing generated from that judgement to the raid is fed to the paladin as threat, which sent their TPS through the roof. However there seemed to be some discussion as to if that was actually the case.
---
I did some duo leveling with a mage friend as a warrior while leveling 40+
---
I helped on AOE pulls but I was useless once the pull started- so many mobs that if I took aggro I just got CRUSHED.  So I only helped with utilitiy, basically just gathering more mobs (plate armor + shield and mount makes it easy) and bringing them together with what the mage gathered.  Peircing howl can be cool but it's overwritten by stronger slows like blizzard or cone of cold, so it's not super useful.  Otherwise I would take care of runners or be a bodyguard for hte mage if he had an accidental add later on in the pull when he was weaker and low on cooldowns/mana. 
---
It was not efficient but fun to just play with a friend. 
---
We would also solo elites easily by ping-ponging aggro back and forth as necessary and kiting.  We could burn them down too if they are immune to CC or kiting with like retaliation/recklessness.  
---
Single target I guess could work but you'd occasionally have to stop for mana/hp breaks.  Though the mage conjures food ofc so you can still constantly pull and just 1 of you occasionally take a break to get back to full.   Warrior can taunt/mocking blow and the mage is free to spam mostly. 
---
Whatever you spec will be fine, but if you're going for best possible 'duo spec' I'd say just go frost and learn to do AOE pulls with the warrior as your sidekick.
---
This isn't true, I ran a dwarf priest to Teldrassil to level to specifically test this. You can accept the quest from the Dolanaar Priest trainer, but she sends you back to Ironforge to finish the quest.
---
I mean do you have any stress I can use to relieve my stress from the stress test?
---
Is that actually a thing, or are people just memeing? I've never been in a raid that wiped on MC trash, not even in the shittiet PUG.
---
you forgot the "wait for it"
---
I'd like to think blizzard has some experience in this department.... I'd like to think that...
---
I'm planning to main a Warlock and have been doing my due diligence. Turns out I'll be able to have a totem stomp macro on just about all my spells. That makes me worried for all the Shaman on PvP servers.
---
Mages are boring as shit to me though :/ Might have a look at rogues.
---
The optimist in me says they've just woken up to the fact that millions of people are going to want to play this stress test and the official launch and now they're scrambling to add extra capacity.
---
The pessimist in me says they've just woken up to the fact that there are hundreds of bugs that need fixing and now they're scrambling to get it all done.
---
I don't think Blizzard had pushed back the release date once offically announced one single time in the company's entire history.
---
They won't start now
---
Not sure about exact mechanics, but being a lower level effects honor.  I know from my twinking days that no matter how much I played there was no way to get past a certain rank.
---
...I would have been fine staying private pounder forever.
---
Not so much in vanilla they didn't. The people that did this died quickly and often, and were added to the list of people to avoid.
---
im not complaining about replacing gear in a higher tier raid... I clearly specified in my post how i replaced mythic raiding gear with the catchup gear. and then all of that didnt matter once i started heroic eternal palace. (i didnt use names because nobody cares)
---
I also do not mind at all when and how upgrades come through, thats part of the fun of the game. makes things much more rewarding
---
You are better off putting the 11 points from destro in affliction IMO. Your leveling strategy should be to almost constantly pull multiple mobs and dots all of them, benefitting from Nightfall procs and kiting mobs as you move around areas. 
---
Putting those 11 points into Imp CoA, Nightfall, Amplify Curse, and Grim Reach. That should leave you with some extra points to put into the affliction tree with something like Imp Drain Life/Soul, or Suppression.
---
well the thing is it would be classic is back, abbreviating classic and is to classic's, not having a ' means you are trying to make it plural
---
That is a great one, I second it. Also there is DefTalk, Good Morning Azeroth. The audio version is put out by Defcamp and Melderon TV. The video version can be found on YouTube on Dunedain's channel or Kargoz's channel.
---
Look up quests on wowhead or whatever classic alternative there will be when you need help.  We all did it back in the day.  Its not a guide, but it can help you figure some things out.
---
TBC
---
Sounds to me like he wanted to succeed at the point he was at in the game.
---
What an asshole, right?
---
Interesting how your distaste for this one player is an indictment for all of retail.  Because we all know Classic raids are sunshine and rainbows without drama or any conflicting personalities.
---
Which class should a COMPLETELY new person play? I'm lost because very thread that I read makes me wanna play all classes, but I know that Classic is very time demanding and re-rolling isn't an option. 
---
I want to be able to play PvP and PvE. Keep in mind that I don't know about raids, BGs and anything. Just played a little bit of retail to get the taste, did some quests etc. Going to play solo but I hope to make in-game friends. From what I've played in retail, my options are Paladin, Hunter, Mage, Druid, Warlock.
---
Wait what? Have they actually confirmed they are allowing totem stomp macros?
---
I think you fundamentally don't understand what I am saying. I'm not saying the spell rotation was better in Vanilla. I am saying there are no consequences to any of your actions. No Mana management, no real need for CC. Just gather up all the mobs and spam your rotation. No need to maintain CC like sheep and other mechanics that broke up the monotony. 
---
A LFR group wiping to trash is not the same as a solid guild group willing to trash.
---
When your capital is a raid you're always rebuilding.
---
Warlocks are literally the strongest class in the game regardless of faction so you'll be fine lol
---
Feel free to link it m8 according to the rules as far as i know, especially if people are asking you for it. Really appreciate the info you posted!

The name is ctr.
---
Bit of a metaphorical spit in the face for EU players. Hey no stress test for you first week, and second week first postponed and second fuck you.
---
I went pvp as a new player.  Best thing I ever did.
---
I literally haven’t seen another player on uther since sharding:0
---
Feral Druid.
---
It’s a lot of work, you’ll need BiS gear and it’s a lot of effort/practice to be on the top tier completive level for both pve and pvp. But you can get the job done.
---
Also, Druids have more specs available in the hybrid area. There is a 0/30/21 spec that’s great for pvp and is functional in raids. 
---
You’ll be the flag carrier but it’s a fun job
---
Bear tanking is fun and very functional in 5 mans and early raids. It’s also better to be on the alliance side since Kings and Sanc go a long way for Druid tanking.
---
Personally the way I view it is this.
---
Druids are better if you’re playing by yourself or more casually.
---
They have more options, they can really do everything to a degree, they are easy to level and they are always needed. (Not in high numbers but if you build a reputation on your server as a decent Druid, you’ll definitely find spots). They also don’t feel as stale over long periods of time. 
---
Paladins are better if you have a designated group or are playing to be top tier.
---
You’ll be more shoehorned into support roles but they are undoubtedly great at what they do.
---
Go warrior.  Start as fury at 60 and when you feel confident, then offtank when you get some gear
---
Hurricane Barry killed my vacation, so now i have an additional week allocated for Classic!
---
I’d say it’s about as much fun as leveling a priest. So, leveling speed is fine but solo play is pretty much rinse and repeat mob to mob with ele. Enhance goes from boring to random when you get wf, but can be more interesting. Never speed resto while leveling but sham healing is fun I’m 5 mans...you have tons of utility. It’s a class that really shines in group play, but will be fine but flat for solo.
---
&gt; Interesting how your distaste for this one player is an indictment for all of retail. 
---
lol another assumption, i was just recounting my experience, there are many dead servers and people who think all that matters is to progress as fast as possible, its like the guy who never made it into college football but brags about how he was the best varsity player in highschool.
---
Your abilities can also have macros in front of them so the pet will auto target totems first whioe using your abilities.  Very common in tbc arena until they changed the totem names.  Warlocks used to eat shaman (especially resto) up.  Felhunter especially.
---
basically if you give him enough of a head start to hold aggro, then he will just die.
---
youd be better off not AOEing and just STing the enemies down together with him as fury and you as whatever.
---
For Paladins, very reliable once every hour.
---
For tanking you can't really play paladin that well, they build great aoe threat but they lack taunt so 5 man dungeons can become problematic.
---
As dps you can't rly play ret pala, sry they are just too bad, I'm all for everyone playing what they want, but ret is just too bad :(
---
Feral dps is acceptable though (considered mg the buff they bring to the group) 
---
As far as healing goes I personally plan to value druids in feral dps spec higher, allthough theres not going to be any point bringing more feral dps druids than the number of phys dmg groups.
---
Warlocks on alliance have an organized pvp advantage, but warlocks on horde have a wpvp 1v1 advantage.  If you are going to play with your SO that's already a big advantage regardless of factions.
---
&gt;No one cares about \[Retail WoW\] in this subreddit
---
There are 150k people on this sub; you don't speak for all of us.  And don't blame me, I didn't create the post :P   Why'd you even click on it, anyway?? &lt;3
---
Hard work?  Dude pawned the job off on a warrior who told him it was a bad idea.  Left him with zero support from the rest of the Horde.  Pretty much set him up for failure.  The modern Horde is literally Thrall's baby and he walked out on it before it hit puberty.
---
You all have phones, don't you?
---
I don't think I'm misunderstanding you. In heavy content there's definitely classes that need to manage mana. You definitely don't pull "all the mobs" in Mythic+ because that's an extremely easy way to wipe.
---
Mechagon is a 5-man dungeon, not an LFR, and you do need to maintain 1-2 CC abilities on mobs in order to effectively clear trash.
---
If the thing I want is reserved I ain't going.
---
&gt;Retail you always take the higher ilvl item. Classic things like blackhands breadth and lionheart helm are bis the entire game
---
Why is that better though? I like upgrading my character. 
---
I hate how titanforging and stuff makes it so there's no real "BiS" you can work towards. But I at least prefer being able to upgrade my gear in new raids, instead of sitting on the same old item for an exntire expansion.
---
Don't forget to play a Paladin or a shaman if your a n00b who is looking for a well balanced class!
---
CRT
---
Agreed if you’re solo. If you can pair with a healer then warrior is fantastic in any PvP
---
good.
---
Yeah I'm fine with ML until the ML abuses it. Then they get the same treatment as any other ninja.
---
No. Armour class is a one-way restriction for a reason. If you weren't supposed to be wearing the tier below they wouldn't let you. Tons of BiS is lower than the "designated" tier.
---
True paladin is pretty easy cause all they can do is stand there, heal, and bubble lmao
---
Don't be surprised if it's a September release date.
---
42 for warlocks as death cool changes everything
---
Summer is 21st June-20th September. Doesn't matter where you live on the northern hemisphere, this is the definition of summer. 
---
Not that I ike the release date but hey, we are being pedantic here.
---
In the end, they're still a healer class, and they're also the healer in the highest demand, so you won't have any problems finding groups at all
---
May the winds guide you
---
“Technical limitations” is also the reason there is a debuff limit. Where is the line drawn between which technical limitations should be removed and which should stay as per Vanilla?
---
Druids are also super good a dueling for what its worth.
---
A server with 10k+ players, it's easy to find some wpvp. Not the same with a server 1.5k players.  
---
What you are describing for the content is grinding. I agree with you that there's unlimited solo grinding in wow vanilla.
---
If the item improves your main spec id say its fair game and my morals wont suffer.
---
Resto shamans pre-bis is mostly cloth ^^
---
They should have a good idea on Aug 13th what to expect and it was kind of ingenious to allow character names to be made on that day. Most people will have thier names blocked and resubbed giving blizzard a two week notice of the intent to play.
---
calm down there satan
---
So September release then?
---
Layering!
---
&gt;Buddy, you nailed it. BFA is a fantastic game you can play along other people. But its really more of a single player thing. The story is great, the quests are cool, and the game is stunning to look at.   
---
&gt;but, fuck, I dont know that Ive typed 10 words in /1 chat in the last 5 years, and certainly haven't /tell any one who I didn't think had a cool transmog.
---
W... what
---
So they are 7/8. Not bad.
---
Hunter without TS is dead weight.
---
aaaand I found the name of my troll alt.
---
Play alliance. My theory is you will make more friends in game anyway
---
I totally over did it and upgraded from a single 28" monitor to a pair of 32" curved monitors and loaded up some sweet classic wow wallpapers. I'm real stoked.
---
They have explained multiple times, the leway is correct.  The reason it seems absurd has to do with technology differenced between 2006 and now.  It was that huge to help with people with awful ping.  I remember playing on like 200ms+back then.  Now its 40.
---
That's how I feel about it before a dungeon and then when the drops come I feel bad if I take it.  Like I'm robbing the other player of an upgrade.  I guess that's wow though lol
---
I believe he has said the podcast will continue even after launch (with the same name, even)
---
Bugs are pretty much irrelevant for a stress test though. I'd say most likely they just had some unexpected hardware delays.
---
My thinking was 5/5 cruelty. 5/5 improved demo shout to help with bigger pulls and dungeons. 5/5 improved battleshout which will double dip buffing both of us and seen as I will be taking most of the hits, the uptime on 5/5 enrage would be great. 
---
All of the advice so far points to starting as arms lol! Definately an eye opener ^
---
Most will resub and block thier names on Aug 13rth giving them an idea of how many people plan on logging in that day also gives them 2 weeks to increase servers if necessary
---
I find virtually everything outside of the playability of the specs uninteresting.
---
Blizzard knows where their money is coming from. That's who WoW is made for.
---
It's a global stress test, bud.
---
Check out the source code! It’s wonderfully simple and will be a great baby step into the world of addon programming.
---
warrior is better as an alt you can feed with upgraded green weapons, band aids, and potions.
---
Definitely mage out of those.  The strengths and proper tactics of the class are easy to learn.  You blast enemies from range then frost nova them when they get close.  You sheep extra enemies you or your group aren’t currently attacking.  You make your own food and water.  There’s no bs with pets or short duration buffs or annoying class quests, and you are strong in basically all aspects of the game.
---
It is just hard to mess up compared to warlock and hunter, whose crowd control and utility are harder to use.  There aren’t that many key bonds or special tactics compared to something like Druid, which requires a lot of experience to play well.
---
Mages are also very desired in 5 man groups while leveling.  A group without one will always take one.
---
I'm pretty sure haste also increases mind flay damage ticks.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but if that is the case then shadow troll priest with shadowguard and hex of weakness is straight up OP.
---
Also the best for PvE. Theyre the best horde priest race for anyone who doesn't want to look like an old decaying lettuce.
---
&gt; Which class should a COMPLETELY new person play
---
Dps. You have by far the least responsibility and it is helpful to run a while as a DPS to understand tanking and healing before trying to fill those roles.
---
I would recommend a caster class that's easy to learn and hard to master so you can have a sense of progression with skill without making it unbearable at first. Mage or Hunter is my first thought.
---
Pretty much this.
---
I remember trying to level mining but finding myself either delaying actually leveling by running in circles waiting for spawn or going to next zone and not being the gathering level needed for it
---
Take some of these with a grain of salt, I have more experience with some classes than others.  In most cases it's going to be the 30s.
---
* **Druid** \- It's somewhere in the 30s.  Cat Form is going to eventually be your primary form for most solo content, but since it starts at level 20, you've got all the complexity of a level 4 Rogue at level 20.  It takes until the mid-30s before you have enough abilities to really come into your own.  This is when you have Travel Form and you have Ferocious Bite.
---
* **Hunter** \- Level 10, 12, or 14.  Once you get all of the basics to control your pet, you have the majority of the class.  There are a few things that will elevate you later (like AotC and Feign Death), but you've got 90% of the gameplay once you get a pet.
---
* **Mage** \- For single target, level 4 when you get Frostbolt.  For AoE grinding, around level 20 when you get Blizzard.  
---
* **Paladin -** Level 4.  You get Seal of Command at 20, but as far as playstyle goes, that just changes the way you want to gear.  It doesn't change the way you play that much.  Maybe also whatever level you get a high enough rank to bubble hearth.
---
* **Priest** \- I pretty much play holy priests and so I say level 1.
---
* **Rogue** \- When you get cheap shot and kidney shot and can actually stun enemies, plus have Vanish.  Should have all of these in the 30s.
---
* **Shaman -** When you get Windfury and have all of your totems, which will be in the 30s.
---
* **Warlock -** Level 10 when you get the VW.  Most of the leveling options (Hunterlock, Drain Hunt, Fear DoT) are available to you now.  If you go affliction, then it will be in the 30s when you can actually drain tank, have siphon life, and are starting to get shadow damage gear.

* **Warrior** \- As soon as you can run RFC or Deadmines, depending on faction.

&gt;  While we’re still on track to launch WoW Classic on August 27, we need a bit more time before this final pre-launch worldwide test.
---
That's fine and dandy in theory but they have never communicated a single thing that indicates that what you said will be their approach.
---
I am leaning towards playing a resto druid.  how shitty is it going to be to farm gold?  If i keep a set of feral gear (but dont respec) is it decent enough to farm gold/mats?
---
My biggest takeaway from this is how much I do not miss watching TV. This monstrosity had like 4 advertisement breaks in 30 minutes!
---
Thank you sir!
---
Hunter, most noob friendly
---
Can you play the stress test if you haven’t had a beta invite yet?
---
I doubt it unfortunately given todays news.
---
Do not insult murloc's.
---
Mglrmglmglmgl
---
Class? Professions? AH approach? Spec? Questing or grinding? Playtime? Farming? Anything to actually contribute to the discussion? 
---
You’ll notice I didn’t ask what levels you were hoping to pursue first, although you do have some solid basic math skills.
---
The add-on could work like thus, it could read your coordinates and then when you press the voice key anyone within a reasonable range of those cordinates hears it and depending how close it will be louder or quieter.
---
you are not special. you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake.
---
Winter 2017
---
If it's an upgrade for my MS I'm needing on it regardless of the armor class.
---
When it comes to off-spec I'll only need if no one else needs it for their MS.
---
For the record, there were already addons in beta that fixed those UI issues. 
---
Blizzard is taking a preservationist approach to Classic, not an "HD remaster" approach. They've said that from the beginning. You don't have to like it, but you should respect that a lot of thought has gone into how to do Classic, including explicitly reimplenting bugs to make it more accurate. They're not just doing it slapdash. It's thoughtful and intentional, even if it seems dumb.
---
I know I know, just my irrational brain taking over.
---
It Is Your Birthday
---
Don't die
---
You're confusing vanilla with every version of the game after vanilla. 
---
In vanilla there were no pvp-specific stats so some of the best items for pve came from PvP, while some of the best gear for PvP came from raids. 
---
Both activities start out with mostly the same gear and professions, with the exception of movement speed items being more important to PvP.
---
This is for all those people that have a free three days that was waiting for this that expires right after this was suppose to happen?
---
Don't say this
---
So here is how I think it works.
---
Like any spell with travel time, combat doens't actually initiate until the spell lands.
---
But since arcane missiles is a channeled spell with also travel time, private servers (MangOS) would immediately put the mage caster into combat prior to the arcane missiles landing and causing damage.
---
In Classic, Blizzard has confirmed that the proper spell mechanic is that you are not put into combat until the first "wave" of arcane missiles land on the target during channeling.
---
1 / 0.7 = 1.43. To have 30% less cast time, aka 70% casttime, you need 42.8% haste
---
Feral is way better for 5 man tanking.
---
Ret will generally be a bit better DPS, Cats are a very rare pickup for 5 mans though, since as Feral, you can tank anyways (and some people will assume youre just a dunce that doesnt know how to tank) and your DPS is quite bad. I kind of avoid playing with both, while I think Ret is more acceptable because you can at least PvP with it reasonably, most Ret Paladins in the last few years on pservers have been real morons trying to get things like Mask of the Unforgiven and TS shoulders.
---
Paladin heals better in terms of raid numbers in preraid gear, but in a 5 man, Druid is easier to heal as.
---
Raiding:
---
Given your lack of commitment to raiding, neither would be a tanking choice for raids. Even in a casual guild, you want dedicated tanks. A very dedicated feral has a chance of OT in raids, Paladin has a chance only if your guild like REALLY meme specs.
---
Both are equally "capable" in PvP. Druid plays more as a cat and mouse style healer, where youre getting your opponents to chase you around and if they give up or fall behind you throw some heals, while Paladins can stand there like a post, tank the hits and heal, generally speaking. Paladins will generally heal themselves and slowly try to grind down their opponents when solo, while a Druid will generally just delay for objectives or run away.
---
I know, I agree with your other posts I was just venting (my bad). Hopefully TBC does come because yes then the tides turn.
---
Even without heirlooms, the leveling experience is a complete face-roll. Go find a mob in the world and let it beat on you, without attacking back. You'll see what I mean.
---
Next week, was supposed to be on 25th or so.
---
&gt; What are you talking about? I'm EU and was part of the first stress test which was global

i remember rogues used to do this in front of orgrimmar. ppl just laughed instead of chasing him
---
It's like talking to a wall lol.
---
So not so much while ur leveling?  Like a ret pally healing a dungeon should allow the cloth wearers priority.
---
Oooooooh
---
Why would any department of activision-blizzard delay a game?  They could get full retail value and add in fixes and corrections six months down the road.  Even call the fixes a phase 1.5 patch, to fix launch issues and remove layering.
---
&gt; they have no way to gauge how many players are going to not only log in on launch week
---
I suspect that the 'claim your char name early if you're subbed on Aug 13th' is going to be a metric for them, they'll gauge how many resubbed. It won't count people who are unaware or don't care enough so they'll have to have some idea what % of people are hyped enough to do this, but at the same time if you're looking for an indicator of the number who will stick around post launch then the people who signed up early to claim names is a good metric?
---
You are unique, just like the 7.5bn other people :p
---
It feels weird, even when I've asked 10 times if it's okay with the group for me to need on this item and they said it's fine.
---
However, in those few cases that nobody really needs it and it's free for the taking, it can feel like an amazing upgrade, simply because "it's not technically for *you*, but you *can have it* anyway".
---
Just makes it a little bit more special, I guess. As a fury woyer, I'll be contesting a lot of daggers and leather gear with Agi, but of course I'll first let the classes with priority take them.
---
I just asked this above but I'm curious of your thoughts as well.
---
" So not so much while ur leveling? Like a ret pally healing a dungeon should allow the cloth wearers priority. "
---
Priest. Paladin is so over used. The power of priests is incredible. Also with paladin you can only heal. Prot and ret are near unplayable meme specs
---
Not a great choice, having a Burning Crusade race as the main picture.
---
shaman was my first level 60 class. the ghost wolf form is something you really appreciate. i also loved the different elemental damage effects on your weapons. totems may get a bit annoying for questing. i think at level 40 you get windfury which elevates the gameplay further. probably the most fun thing in the game.
---
Yeah I think it will be mad numbers. More than retail numbers, at least initially. Long ter.? We'll see.
---
I would strongly recommend you wait at least 1 week before your days off to no-life it at launch. Launch day and the days following are going to be a disaster.
---
Orc is better. Undead looks cooler. You cant go wrong here really
---
There will be a lot of "visitors". Sure many people from retail will login and play, most probably wont stay. 
---
Many will quit before 20, more before 40. It will still be a healthy population remaining though. The biggest challenge will be handling that first month of people and then keeping servers populated after the initial wave. If you played classic you remember all the dead servers that got merged. However this is where layering comes in.
---
I mean, if I see you at Moonglade I'm not gonna kill you, but on STVietnam is fair game
---
You get a copy paste as well for not reading: 
---
did you read what I said? Or the article you linked me?
---
&gt;Though pricing and an exact release date haven't been confirmed by Blizzard, online video game store GameStop.com indicated a Jan. 23 ship date and a $39.99 price for the expansion.
---
There was no official released date pushed back. They didnt have one when they announced it was "delayed"
---
Ele shams will destroy in early phase at 60, no need to worry about that. I think they fall off more late game if you don't have top tier gear. I've played an ele shaman on private servers over the last 6 months and mostly world pvpd. Ghost wolf is really nice for getting around quickly and catching those that run. The only caveat is they don't have a spammable cc for 1vx situations, but this can be remedied by getting sleeping dust and nets from mobs in westfall. You will destroy mages which feels great as they are so overhyped, but curse of tongues will be the bane of your existence lol.
---
Well at least I'm not the only one who feels weird about it.  Seems like the majority of people who responded feel the same way.  Just seems tough to keep your off-healing set up-to-date.  Might be a \*little\* different for a fury warrior though, but like I said, once I'm in the dungeon and the item drops I start to get empathetic.
---
It's going to be very interesting to see the economy take shape. Here are a few factors that will determine that position:
---
1) Vendor price floors either on inputs or outputs could exceed equilibrium market prices with an immature monetary base.
---
2) Time value of money (i.e. vendor, AH, stockpile for later phase tradeoffs) and transaction costs of the AH.
---
3) Some of this assumes players are rational agents optimizing toward mount, which may or may not be the case; how many people will be willing to blow their meager savings on a non-weapon item that gets replaced in a few levels?
---
4) Skill plateaus in crafting &amp; gathering create a trade-off (farm more at low or no xp/hr vs. keep leveling as fast as possible which increases your gold/hr from grinding higher level mobs dramatically - it feels more than linearly but I've never seen an analysis)
---
...and many more. 
---
I need to reach out to a guy I was in graduate school with who did his dissertation on digital economies because this is his wet dream.
---
Is this going to be a huge disadvantage for shamans?
---
I have a 32" Asus 4k but I will be buying a second monitor so I can lookup quests / watch videos while questing. Two screens is a must.
---
Wall jumping
---
Feral charging up the GY to avoid melee
---
Running around the fences
---
Using FAP and travel form to rush throug mid
---
Stealth to go ninja the flag
---
Druid is strong FC
---
basically, but because of how they are itemized you can still get other items and play around with things. For example lionsheart helm has no stamina, so you would still be tempted to get some other helms along the way.
---
current blizz doesnt allow for that, only once in a while with trinkets does that happen.
---
TBC blows. It was the beginning of the end for WoW
---
RemindMe! 41 days
---
Neat. I don’t think I’ll have time to raid so having the option to do things like tank 50-58 dungeons as shaman sounds like a fun enough  endgame with PvP.
---
When is the last time a mage or a rogue won a level 60 tournament. It has always been warlock dominated, to the point where they had to ban the entire SL talent. Warriors are bad at nearly every solo aspect of the game, whether they be leveling, farming, or WPvP. Keeping such a narrow-minded view will only impact your enjoyment of the game.

Auctioneer is an amazing add on for selling and buying on the AH too, it’s supported for most exp packs for pservers so I imagine it should have a classic version out too, highly recommend it even asides what you want it for
---
Am I the only one that's happy about this news?  Sure the stress test is delayed, but they confirmed that they're still on track for the Aug. 27th release!  This is the real news people.
---
Exactly. These people begging for TBC and WoTLK need to shut their face and realize that those expansions were the end of WoW

I'm hoping they are in an "oh shit" mode if it means they are reconsidering layering. Otherwise it's a bit worrisome.

Yeah I was going to sub close to the 18th anyways so maybe this can work out for my plans lol.
---
I feel for those who already subbed though, F.
---
That could change by tomorrow. On track and actually being ready are wildly different states
---
The cherry picking the devs do is pretty lame.  They wanted the game based on the 1.12.1 patch.  But they get to choose what bugs they want to fix and what systems they want to bring in from prior patches.  For example, they don't want to use the mount system in 1.12.1.  But they want to use the talents and fixes people got in this patch to clear content that was never meant to be ran with the new talents.  They want to bring in frost trap and scatter shot that used to have different diminishing returns in early patches, that due to a bug got put on the same DR timers, until an arena patch next expansion.
---
dam son.
---
nice!
---
I was thinking rogue was the way to go but being a ghost would work as well, haha!
---
People dueling outside are usually waiting for BG queues. 
---
Plus Horde members pretty much *always* flag themselves if an alliance member shows up near Org.
---
&gt; m+ rewards gear that gets better with level and the levels keep the same difficulty.
---
So just change the labelling I guess? That would obviously work just fine. 
---
&gt;items cant have steep increases either tho, 5 item levels is huge in terms of classic. its unmanageable and unfun. Id rather look at items and theory craft a little. Huge differences dont allow for that
---
Yeah, I would probably prefer that too. 5 ilvls is roughly the difference between raid tiers in classic, which worked fine, although a lot of items were really badly designed, unfortunately. 
---
&gt;not the typical blizzard hard reset... you know how vanilla is... like that
---
So make dungeons irrelevant after the initial pre-raid gearing. And add new catch-up mechanics each patch but keep gear from older raids closer to newer gear. 
---
It would make the game a lot less interesting for me at least. But I guess if you join mid-way through an expansion it would be an improvement.
---
&gt; Most people 
---
No matter how hyped we all are, I'd bet only 10-25% of people will resub early just to reserve names. I know about 60 people who say they are coming back, and so far only 5 have confirmed that they are reserving names. I already re-subbed for the first stress test and I probably won't even bother to reserve names.
---
Was just leveling a Shaman in BETA,
---
I don't want to say what's been so far commented on so far, but haven't seen something very interesting I came across in speed level guides by Joanna and Kargoz. 
---
For classes with mana, math from speedruns (Kargoz mentions on Twitch - can't find the video) show that prioritizing the SPIRIT stat causes you to level the quickest as you're able to use shocks/open fights with lightning bolt, totems, etc. while regenerating enough mana during battles to keep you up and running without needing to drink as often.
---
This allows you to complete that last 10/10 kill for quests without stopping and get you back to town to turn quests in without spending time drinking. Especially in Vanilla, stats don't make as much of an impact on leveling efficiency than spirit does.
---
Of course, you'll want to have the right gear for healing and dps for dungeons as you go, but if you like constant action keep spirit in mind!
---
Link to mention of having spirit gear/macros to equip and get back into fight quicker: [https://classicwow.live/guides/42/1-60-shaman-leveling-guide-by-kargoz](https://classicwow.live/guides/42/1-60-shaman-leveling-guide-by-kargoz)
---
... do you feel entitled to play *their* test on *your* schedule ?
---
They do, which is why they implemented systems to avoid crashing/major queues during big launches since Legion. But for classic wow, they had to undo those things :) 
---
They’re not in panic mode but they do have adjustments to do based on the massive interest and the results of the first few stress tests.
---
Because the only thing that matters for healers is keeping people alive. 
---
Meters are irrelevant in fights where there's enough mana and people have no threat of dying.
---
It's like claiming X class is the better healer because they can snipe heals the best in LFR raids
---
&gt; 110 
---
optimist
---
Lol did you watch any of the beta tournaments that just happened?
---
when there's fewer people it makes more sense to help eachother and foster relationships.  just because you get 60 doesn't mean there's other 60's for you to play with.
---
when there's too many people it makes more sense to climb all over eachother in a mad dash to the top, because there's gonna be people everywhere you turn you don't have to care about individuals, just play with whoever's around at the time.
---
Could you even hit a level 70 at level 1? No?.. Okay.
---
I still like classic, and have played quite a lot on private servers (two characters to 60 at least). But I really don't like how few upgrades there are for some classes throughout the raids. Helm and shoulders for fury warriors is a good example. Even the BiS fury shoulders in the entire game have weird stats.
---
Ah gotcha
---
Nah they will just play with people that don't give a shit, are okay to take 4-5 of these specs in raid, and still do fine because the content can be done with 35 people and probably less. So they are fine.
---
Back in vanilla I remember a lot of groups with Druid healers taking a Retadin along for rez.
---
So what you are saying is that the game only requires you to think when you play it at the hardest level of difficulty. This just goes to show you that the majority of the game is just keyboard mashing.
---
Even my 55 year old brother-in-law is hyped.  They bringing back the real nerds.
---
There seems to be a lot of people assuming what his true in some very top heavy pservers (and extrapolating from retail too for that matter), is going to be the case here. I suspect some previously "worthless" items will be valuable and some valuable items will be cheap AF early.  But the only thing I know for sure is we will all likely be surprised by the economy.
---
You spelled druid wrong :)
---
So, I've been following this game very closely, and you're mistaken. The stress test dates as first announced by Blizzard are :
---
&gt;Stress Test 1: Wed May 22–Thurs May 23
---
&gt;Stress Test 2: Wed Jun 19– Thurs Jun 20
---
&gt;Stress Test 3: Date To-Be-Determined
---
The first stress test in May was global, and it had a subsequent unplanned stress test the same month. The second planned stress test was not global, which was a month ago, which is why all of your "sources" are from a month ago. And the last planned stress test will presumably also be global. Also there was no stress test open to all subs as far as I'm aware, you can prove me wrong by actually linking a bluepost or official sources confirming your claim.
---
So another layering thread ?
---
If it is an upgrade to my main spec I do not feel bad, but I will let others take it for their main spec before I snag it for my off spec.
---
Imagine pulling less damage then a tank.
---
So your issue isn't with item level dictating the best gear, it's that in retail there's no distinction between items other than better stats. Where as in classic you could have unique things like a helm with no stam but a lot of str that you'd have to compensate for in other places.
---
Can't
---
There were technical restraints that allowed only 8 debuffs on monsters for many months of classic.  They loosened the restraints on that.  Why not allow servers to run at full throttle, instead of using spell batching to make it feel like we are running on potato chip servers with 50kpbs connections.
---
Yea but you can tv and laundry/cook/masturbate. You can only wow and masturbate.
---
fury at 60 with a bunch of crafted gear otherwise its a drag
---
Back in the days? Yes. Definitely.
---
That's why I downvoted. SL build for leveling seems unnecessary and bad. If I see an SL warlock in a dungeon group, I already know this guy makes bad choices.
---
"See guys!  It's totally viable!"
---
\- every wannabe boomkin
---
Have you ever heard the story of "Winter 2017" my son?
---
I'm not interested in playing anything beyond vanilla. Once Naxxramas hits live, leave it there.
---
Warriors are clearly the best class in Classic, they are the only class with 3 elite talent trees....many of us Hunters are re-rolling Warrior for a reason, time to abuse the meta and dominate.
---
Yeah that's vanilla :) there will be a lot of frustration from mages and warlocks that don't understand.
---
&gt; God fucking damn those imps again...
---
*PTSD Kicks in*
---
LOL that would be hilarious, please let that happen. The salt would flood the canals of Stormwind.
---
I haven't listened yet. Biggest winners imo are ooga gang and payo.
---
Fuck yeah there fun to lvl with, lots of options....espcially on PvP servers....orc shammy can easily turn the tables on an attempted gank and enhancement does stupid, one shot, burst dmg once you hit 40
---
 I will be rolling alliance (on a PVE server) and my main will be a dwarf shadow priest. I am struggling with choosing my alt. End game I do not see myself raiding except the occasional PUG or perhaps joining a casual guild. I will however be doing loads of battlegrounds as I do enjoy that.
---
I prefer a ranged class but played hunter in Vanilla so looking for something new. That leads me to either mage or lock. I have tested both on the retro private server. My thoughts are that the frost mage is a lot more straightforward to play but the lock was a lot more tankier with SL. I would not say I did very well with either, though was often up against super geared fairly hard core PVP players.
---
So which would you recommend? I would, ultimately, like to play a fun, bursty class in BGs. Maybe after getting better gear, so possibly a fire mage or destro lock??? Can I pull either of those off with just PVP gear and occasional off pieces from casual raiding?
---
Of course not it's a shit game. I'm talking about current WoW.
---
Yes. Even a single mage can benefit twice with shatter by casting Frostbolt and CoC.
---
I think the empty stars are supposed to be half stars, so 2.5 stars. That said this was useless for me.
---
Whatever you do get Skinning ASAP (level 5-10). Skin EVERYTHING, vendor it all. Don't bother putting anything on the AH, but if you skin every single beast 1-59, and vendor every single skin, you'll EASILY pay for all your spells, and if you're smart with your money, you'll easily have over 100g by lvl 40 just from Skinning alone. Drop it at 60, but it's going to be hands-down the best leveling profession come launch, without even a close second. Keep in mind, you'll be killing a virtual fuck-ton of beasts 1-59, and skins vendor for a LOT. A stack of Light Leather vendors for 3 silver, which @ lvl 8-15 is a crap ton of silver, esp when you multiply that stack by 10 or more. A stack of Heavy Leather vendors for 30 silver! Which at lvl 30 is a LOT of silver, esp when you multiply it by 10! And you'll be getting a lot more than 10 stacks ea as you quest/level to 60.
---
If you dont have a favorite, the answer is always mage. They are super wanted and they are basically gods among men. The excel at all levels of PvE and PvP content.
---
I'm pretty sure you did. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
---
If you want farming as a priest.  There's Ooze Spriest youtube that has a decent shadow priest mauradon farming video.  The title is a bit click baity with 50-150g an hour (even though in the video he said it was 40-60g), but you can still get something like 30-50g an hour in a very relaxed farm.
---
But the bigger thing, more so if you're planning to be a holy priest, is attach yourself to the hip of a warrior and just run dungeons for gear.  The two of you will create instant group formations, easy to get all the gear you need, you can even work with the warrior to get priority loot choices for you over casters.

Along time ago. In a dreary little town in great britian. There was a company. This companies name was Jagex. Jagex created the ultimate time machine. A peice of software ran on a PC capable of advancing time by hours at a time in what felt like mere minutes.
---
 This little company decided they could bring this wonderful technology to smart phones.  They made a big deal out of this and the fans went wild. It's what they had always wanted after all; the ability to skip time while at work, or on the bus, or at school.
---
 Jagex was so excited they announced this revolutionary technology in the winter of 2016 and said it would be coming no later than winter of 2017! Time went by, all of the fans of Jagex used this time machine to skip time to winter 2017, but when they emerged from the basements of their mothers, alas, no time machine for mobile. Something had went wrong. But what? Jagex was quiete for some time, before admitting they needed a "little" more time.
---
People waited patiently at first, only sitting in their time machines for a week or 2 at a time before re-emerging to check on the status of the mobile time machine. Spring came and went, and with that, hibernation for these fans had begun, summer time. The fans hibernated all summer long, only exiting the comfort of the basement for the occasional fast food, quickly returning before any permanent damage from the sun could arise.
---
Finally! An announcement from jagex! Old school RuneScape for Mobile would be coming to mobile in September! A mere FUCKING YEAR AFTER IT WAS PROMISED! WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK JOGGLEFLEX ??? WTF TOOK SO GOD DAMN LONG?????? 
---
and that's the story of how it took jagex an absurd amount of time for old school RuneScape to be brought to mobile after they announced the release date for winter 2017.

By the weekend, the question was coming up so often that people were purposefully giving wrong directions thinking it was funny. I would usually /w the person asking about 30 minutes later just to see if they eventually found her. The list got too big to keep up with.

Didn't base the ease of leveling a hunter vs warlock on what happens 1 to 10. Just said the hunter is the worst class 1-10 by far, and I level a warrior to 20 just before I tried the hunter. Voidwalker can tank 3 mobs your level for a fair bit of time before dying, then you can sac it for a shield, and if you're specced far enough insta summon another VW. Have you ever played a Warlock?
---
No, hunter 1-10 is terrible if you're playing solo. After level 5 you can only do about 40-50% of a mobs health before they get in melee range, then you're just an extremely gimped warrior. After getting a pet the hunter is probably the quickest and easiest class to kill things single target. However, After playing both, Warlock is better at killing multiple mobs at once, and sh!t... After level 20, mage is the best at it.
---
Another reason I wouldn't choose hunter is because a ton of people will be playing them and there's a bias against hunters of people who think they're bad players. Plus less raid spots, they fall off late end-game, and having to buy ammo and feed your pet is annoying--moreso than managing soul shards.
---
Could be. My friends all got the 3 free days.
---
Is that really the case? I got a warlock to level 35ish before making a change.
---
no i was just giving an example to get my point across.
---
Retail wow higher ilvl = upgrade
---
classic wow number of factors decides if its an upgrade
---
also power creep is far more manageable if you keep the ilvl increases between tiers small
---
Cone of cold always had a weird animation to it where it looked like people were trying to 'style' with it but thats just how it was, as if someone was trying to 360 no scope or something but thats just how it looked.
---
Paladin has innate 50% reduction in threat from healing.  Likely to try and prevent paladins from tanking or holding threat from healing alone.
---
I don't get posts like this, what do you want a thesis?
---
Grab the flag, activate travel form, if anyone roots you then shift elf and back to travel form
---
Try and stay alive
---
Error 37?
---
Not having soul link on a pvp server sounds like a bad time. No soul link makes you an immobile glass canon, but without the canon part.
---
I think(occasionally..not often) that the d/l of Classic and new/renew of member accounts will give them some pretty good numbers too.
---
Warlocks on ally side have to deal with wotf but at least they also get pally support.  Paladin ha s more synergy with warlock than mage imo.
---
&gt; Do you always roll even if it's an off-spec? 
---
If you as a dps roll on heal/tank gear they need it's not gonna end well.
---
&gt; So make dungeons irrelevant after the initial pre-raid gearing. And add new catch-up mechanics each patch but keep gear from older raids closer to newer gear.
---
&gt; It would make the game a lot less interesting for me at least. But I guess if you join mid-way through an expansion it would be an improvement.
---
what? no.... i think im done responding for today
---
I now (as of 2 days ago) have tried 3 different mice. The standard 2 button, Logitech G600, and now the steelseries rival 500. 
---
The 2 button mouse just wasn't enough for me and the logitech's buttons were too close together and difficult to learn. 
---
For me, by far, I prefer the rival 500. It's large and fits my hand. The button positions MAKE SENSE and it just works really well. I'm happy with it and feel it'll improve some parts of my game play.
---
Is it necessary? NO but It's fun and I do think it helps.
---
Think you're right, and it makes beserking better than anyone probably figured it was back then.
---
I imagine at launch, those who run RFC 14-17 will be ahead of those questing in barrens.
---
It all depends on how layering is implemented at launch.
---
Two Words.
---
Travel.
---
Form.
---
Interesting thanks for the input!
---
Pally gonna be drinking A LOT!
---
Have fun!
---
Wow. That seems ridiculously strong if you can get mages to coordinate FB + CoC after one of them Frost Novas.
---
wut
---
Its sad that blizz's philosophy is now "play the patch" instead of play the expansion or game.
---
Random question - are level 60 prot paladins able to solo mass pull low level instances? (think Deadmines, Scarlet Monastery etc)
---
Sounds like a fun way to make some gold if possible.
---
Even if you're duoing all the way to 60, on a PvE server, and there's no chance or danger of you ever getting aggro/taking damage, it's still 100000% better to level as frost over fire. ESPECIALLY if you plan on AOE'ing.
---
God forbid someone group up in a MMO to do stuff. All you have to do is grab a warrior, who needs a healer to farm. They you become a super god who can just mow everything down without stopping.
---
Also, you can make just as much money by fishing, cooking, mining, herbing, selling profession based services... and the best way to make money.. playing the AH.
---
When? Obviously stuff in development was given a target quarter (Summer of 2012, as an example). The language here is a lot different than those pushes. If you look at the Diablo 3 release being pushed back, they did not have a specific date pegged as the release, they had given a range, and the way they talked about it leading up to it was "We're hopeful to still get it done this year, but we'll see", rather than a "We're still on track for 8/27".
---
If you get to this point, a little over a month prior to your hard release date, and you have to push the game back, there's something seriously wrong.
---
Release date is fine.
---
Now just think about one guy controlling 5 frost mages on his own, all synced perfectly to cast it at exactly the same moment.
---
Certainly not arguing with you, but how? The friends I am referring to havent filled out a survey, havent bought anything, have given no indication that they will be part of the rush whatsoever. I understand confirmation bias and I understand sample size, but genuinely: How can Blizzard know what they don't know? These guys are all people I'm close with and I'm bringing them with me for release and there is literally 21 of us that will be jumping in.
---
What metrics that they have available that we don't do you think will give them this information?  I'm not saying they don't, I'm just curious what it is you think they have?  Everything available to them seems to me that it would be speculative at best.
---
Which rules? EU accounts weren't flagged, presumably because of ongoing maintenance at the time. What's preventing you from making an US account? Even if there were some stipulations saying EU citizens can't make an US account to play with their US friends on their servers, there's no way it would ever be enforced unless every EU player used the loophole.
---
It's not really damage you need, it's sustain with no downtime. Imp won't pull threat off of you, so it's slow getting beat by enemies early.
---
Druids would be hard for new players but can literally do everything.
---
Pally would be OK, but don't expect to ever tank anything.
---
Shaman would be easiest for a new player, but don't expect to ever tank anything.
---
Whatever content they implement im fine with it as long as vanilla stays frozen in time after naxx like it was, just like diablo 2 still is frozen in time.
---
Yeah but newborn is the best part so far.
---
Everybody needs to apologize to me for my release thread saying there was no way this game was coming out on 8/27.
---
Agreed. This community is extremely toxic. People think the blizzard forum is bad
---
Flag goes in mouth. Run.
---
Okay good luck fam. Have you played a lock semi recently or is this just memory for you.
---
Would it work on retail? 
---
I haven't played WoW for almost 2 years so might be mis-remembering how macros work.
---
Haha, yeah I read, I just didnt realize the pedantic "officially" changed the sentiment, I was just pointing out that I remember they had a news worthy delay. Here's to hoping 8-27 sticks!
---
And another huntard was born. ;)
---
90% of any WoW community is toxic.  Not limited to classic.
---
I'd love any feedback on how I can better serve this community as well :)
---
I leveled enhancement. Mana can be an issue, but it's really fun. Whirlwind Axe will make you feel like a god. Seriously, you'll do double everyone else's dps in a Mara group.
---
I've been kicked 3 times since I've been back running groups with my wife because of game crashes. I even timed the last one which was just about 45 seconds and I'll be on the load screen and she says they were kicking me. Worst part is somehow each time I ended up with the deserter debuff and we couldn't queue again. Even if I didn't get the debuff she would have to leave them and we would still have to halt our dungeon runs because of the impatience of the  current retail community.
---
&gt; Which rules?
---
The rules clearly specified that the tests were for Oceanic and US players.
---
Yep, I'm with you on that. Tons will drop off, but I think the initial rush is going to be crazy.
---
I leveled a ret pally to 60 and found out I had to heal.  Quit that pally.  Didn't look back till legion.  That was soooooo shitty to find out you picked wrong and had to start over.
---
sounds like you didn't get time off little lad
---
I shall make them a ham sandwich when I make myself a ham sandwich. This way we are both fed.
---
I love Countdown to Classic, though I do get a little miffed by the loaded questions he asks sometimes.
---
*"Hey, mate, so tell me what do you think about the melee leeway mechanic? Do you think it's totally broken and that Blizzard is wrong and it gives Tauren Warriors a huge advantage in PVP...."

"...or something else?"

&gt; My friend is just going straight up holy. 
---
&gt;Is there a better way to build our talents? 
---
You've already answered your own question. There is literally no benefit, and a ton of detriment, to your friend leveling as holy.
---
Yeah it a strong racial for sure. But the other Troll racials are really weak, so I don't think it will become a balance issue.
---
I advice to all completely new players to choose Alliance on PvP servers!   
---
Yes, I'm tricky Horde rogue, if you ask.
---
The reason I asked the question is because I'm planning to multibox 5 characters to 60 with 3 of them being Frost Mages.
---
Ahhhh, okok. :)
---
WE  
---
ARE   
---
DOOOOOOOOOOMED
---
Funny you say that, the reason I re-rolled was because I got absolutely smoked by a couple rogues.
---
I think they’d release it unfinished before upsetting everyone that has been asking for release date since early spring
---
Yep Warriors are the best class in Vanilla for this reason.
---
i'd be furious had they delayed the launch date... i prepared everything around this date, including getting 2 weeks off which seamed impossible to accomplish.
---
1: I will be playing a Tauren
---
2: lvl 30-40 ww axe quest calls for a herb that I will farm and sell
---
Human &gt; Orc &gt; Gnome
---
If you are the type of person that is good with RNG then being a melee Shaman during leveling with a good 2h will be an incredibly satisfying experience everytime you come across an Alliance player.
---
Basically:
---
Stealth up to flag if necessary, in flagroom and area you have to bear or catform(sprint) depending on the situation, constantly switch in and out if you get rooted/slowed. Remember to use hots and maybe even the cure poison buff.  When you are outside (generally you want to go ramp)  you cougar and run from things. In and out of form for CC. Get hots on yourself if needed, innervate and such. 
---
Sometimes you want to go into bear form if you are about to get stunned a lot, also very useful if there's healers nearby to keep you up. Bear charge to get away is very nice. 
---
To improve further: You need to learn all the jumps. There's a ton of them. Watch some stormx I'd recommend and he'll show the jumps, then practice in a game where you don't really need to do anything(usually if you are losing). Learn to use enginering and other useful pvp items.
---
Not a ton to do about that, they stalk you and wait until you're low on resources. At 42 you begin to have some interaction w them.
---
Alright man thanks! That does make a lot of sense. Do you have anymore tips? I plan on rolling a gnome mage solo. And then a holy priest duo with my dad. Would that change anything if I can also have other professions on my priest?
---
&gt;Arenas was the beggining of individualism. 
---
Quite the opposite, arenas were the first instance of PVP where you actually had to connect regularly with other players, making it the least individualistic form of PVP introduced in the game at the time.
---
There are valid criticisms of arena gameplay. For instance, much like battlegrounds and regular instanced dungeons and raids they take you out of the persistent game world. There are games like EQ where instances aren't used, you might want to check that out.
---
&gt;The format of a single person can trive alone in WoW is what delved into retail failure
---
The only pvp situation a single player can thrive alone would be in open world pvp and battlegrounds. As for PvE I didn't play the later expansions, but I have the impression that some solo daily quest displaced regular group content?
---
I recently bought a laptop, primarily for Classic. My budget was £400 ($500) and my priorities were portability, aesthetics, and build quality. I went with a second hand Dell XPS 13 (i5, 8GB, 250GB SSD, 1080p) in excellent condition. I had originally been looking for something with a dedicated graphics card but the size, weight and price tend to shoot up for those models, and for Classic it's probably overkill. I've tried out the 1.12 client and it runs great on integrated graphics alone (Intel HD 620). It's also super easy to remote into my gaming rig at home, so having a non-gaming laptop works just fine for me.
---
Hope this helps with your decision making process :)
---
Judging from this post you didn't actually play vanilla if you think this even approaches the level of toxicity seen back then.  Someone downvoting your bad posts isn't toxicity,  nor is someone telling you your idea is bad.
---
If you want to tank at endgame as a Druid then enchanting for you is a no-brainer. A BiS forever trinket called Smoking Heart of the Mountain is BoP and requires Enchanting 265 to make. You also get ~60 points free from just disenchanting as you level so it's pretty nice to have.
---
1. Feral and Prot aren't even in the same league. To the degree that it's almost insulting to lump them in together. Feral is raid viable, prot is not. 
---
2. Cat has a higher dps ceiling than retribution but requires a lot of time and energy to make work.
---
3. Paladins are the stronger healer in 99.9% of situations.
---
Thanks, was a joke ... Obligatory r/whoosh ?
---
Thank you to the guilds that responded, but We are looking for PvE only. Neither of us enjoys PvP servers. I will wait till next week and post it up more clearly.
---
yeah....modern wow streamlined all the archtypes. 
---
what is your point?
---
The thing is, if there was an MMOs with the same fundamental systems as classic most people would still feel that there was something "special" about classic. They'll say it is this or that trivial balance detail, the graphics, the talent system, etc but at the end of the day, it's really down to the Warcraft world and the rpg experience in it. That is what separates wow from other random MMOs that might still have the same systems. The **feeling** of vanilla is just u paralleled. 
---
(Disclaimer I haven't played all MMOs lol)
---
A video of someone multiboxing 5 frost mages in strat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaolIYYAI5M
---
Kinda boring to only get 1 class though and no healing or tanking ability.
---
I will multibox and first team will be mixed casters (druid/priest/mage/2 warlock).
---
2nd team I want to make 5 shamans because I think that would be so strong for world pvp (able to kill everyone in melee range instantly, able to do 3-5k damage with instant shocks or instant chain lightning, 5 grounding totems that only breaks on direct damage spells).
---
Will be hard to get pvp rank after phase 3 starts though since follow doesn't work in bgs.
---
If you have been googling to check out warrior leveling guides you will no doubt have seen the suggestion to go fury 2h for leveling. However all those tips are coming from private server leveling. On private server you could use sit to to trigger enrage which doesn't work in classic. Without sit working I guess 2h fury still have some things going for it but it's not going to be nearly as good as on private. I would go arms without hesitation. Arms work great for leveling and having tactical mastery very quickly which makes for a more fun gaming experience I think. It's just smoother gameplay.
---
 I would go for this build for starters.  Level 27 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdhb](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdhb)
---
$11 to you good sir, amazing write up, analogies and representation of the OSRS virgin.
---
&gt; How it works for the end-user is irrelevant 
---
The most retarded statement ever, if you want to re-create a game to play and feel like it was 15 years ago, you need to take into consideration the user experience
---
Gonna make a tauren druid and hopefully find a few other tauren that are rolling characters so I can group with them. 1-10 as a druid is not great lol. For professions, i'll grab skinning and herbs until 60 or so, then grabbing enchanting for heart of the mountain. At that point i'll either keep enchanting or drop it for alchemy. 
---
No alts since i'm not taking time off so i'll be in the second wave to 60 anyhow.
---
Ideal situation, your team screens for you and you don't have to even think. When you run out of base you get on your epic mount, ride down through your graveyard, go up the hill into their base (not tunnel) and enter through the middle door. Drop down onto the flag, maybe drinking a free action potion (or alliance just casting it on you), right click the flag, go out tunnel picking up boots if they're up or possibly sprinting. If at any point you were snared shift out. If you're actually going to get hit go bear. Don't waste too much mana. Get out of the tunnel, some of your team should be there to cover you. Go travel form. Go up through tunnel. Cap. Repeat. Maybe your team has a second flag runner as well.
---
Talking from personal experience: Level your professions while you level your character. You'll be behind the leveling curve by a small margin, but you'll bank in lots of money from crafting stuff (like the Blunderbuss for the Ashenvale quest in case you are Horde) or that one component I don't remember for Chasing A-Me in Un'goro. Also once I am 60 I immediately lose all motivation to grind professions, so I want that out of the way already.

It could just mean that they either release a buggy game thats not ready for launch or delay the date at a later point.
---
🍆💦
---
You've largely ignored my point.
---
&gt;There are quite a few bosses post-MC ferals cannot tank, particularly on progression
---
I'm saying this as a Feral who has progression and farm tanked as a guild and raid leader all content from pre-MC -&gt; C'thun with a bit of Naxx, albeit on a private server.
---
For progression, Ferals are garbage. You are vulnerable to being combo'd out, you have no defensive cooldown utility, and threat is far less relevant. Just because you *can* situationally tank something, doesn't mean you should. I guarantee that 90% of all Ferals in classic will not have the knowledge or dedication to make it work. Feral requires guild main tank level effort to put the spec at the point where using one instead of a Warrior is strictly advantageous for a raid. Yes, in situations where:
---
* Incoming tank damage is of no concern
---
* Threat is extremely important, and
---
* You are in no danger of being combo'd
---
Ferals are the far better tank. Farm content BWL and MC is the perfect example of this - you can MCP almost every fight when your raid is overgeared and be in no danger of dying. Particularly effective on Vael. Progression on Broodlord though? An MS + crit will one shot you. If that happens before threat is established by OT's, then watch the raid get blast waves and 5 melee get clobbered to death. Warriors can prepare for that with a wall or LS, Feral cannot.
---
You are also incorrect about Patchwerk. Patchwerk's main attacks *can* both crit and crush, however Hateful Strike cannot.
---
Schwenty.
---
Just take Skinning @ lvl 5. The money you'll get vendoring leather will pay for a cheap white wand until you get ur Gravestone Scepter at lvl 23 (which is BiS until like lvl 50 lol) There's also a decent wand that drops from WC, which you can get around lvl 16-18. Until BFD ofc.
---
&gt; and the best way to make money.. playing the AH
---
Nah, never. But I get you, finding a farming buddy shouldn't be too hard.
---
I only played BFA during launch and forgot about it. But I picked it up again for 8.2 and I will say its become incredibly addictive again. The new raid is also amazing looking.
---
It is about 1 mana every 2 seconds while casting and about 8 extra damage and healing if talented
---
Take your time questing and exploring. Don’t rush to 60, it will come. There are so many different zones with unique themes and beautiful scenery. Join a RP server.
---
I didn't know you needed to resub to reserve your name, I definetly won'y pay 6e to get a name, I'll just throw an easy accent to type on a random letter lol
---
Your best bet, look up some laptops in your price range and then do some youtube searches for that CPU + onboard graphics combination with either Legion or BFA gameplay.
---
Classic has less poly count, but still running on the modern architecture, so it's going to be something in between true vanilla 1.12 client and BFA.  
---
If you can though, getting a decent Ryzen APU setup would be ideal but would cost you upwards of $600.
---
so just feign death trap lol, then it's not on DR. Scatter trap is only used for ranged IMO.
---
I would venture out and say 90 percent of the gaming community is toxic. I play dota 2 and the community has some real assholes
---
BFA was released in alpha stage. I think Classic is way more polished. Hope it’s released on time but at least the devs know players care about quality over quantity.
---
I tried searching for my old beloved Warlock. Turns out, someone else have my character name now :(. I never deleted my toon, that name is mine, god damnit!
---
People ask the same pointless questions over and over "Would it not be great if Blizzard implements the feature xxx from TBC/WotLK" and complain about the community downvoting and being toxic :)
---
Boring and Weak.
---
Worst healers in the game, and the most simple/boring. You literally have different ranks of Healing Touch. That's it. You'll virtually never use HoTs @ 60, and in 5-10 mans people will pass you up for a class that can resurrect.
---
I don’t care what other people do.  But if it were me, I’d choose not to broadcast my illiteracy to every car behind me.
---
You can only be furious at yourself for doing something so stupid as scheduling off 2 weeks of work for a fucking video game.
---
Intimidation + Scatter shot build was popular on pservers and will be even more popular on Classic.
---
Don't worry, anonymity is being taken away little by little by every tech corporation. Soon we shall all be revealed 24/7. You won't even get to pick your character names anymore. You'll just be Chad#8008 or Bryden#9001. 
---
If that causes you concern about the future let me put your mind at ease. Once they release everyone's historical xbox live recordings and chat logs civilization will end so you won't have to suffer for very long.
---
I feel like the ret bashing is unnecessary but as far as someone wanting to play ret its a pretty easy decision. Ret is not a good spec, thats not an opinion. It literally under performs compared to classes everywhere.
---
BUT
---
Are you a casual player who thinks Paladins are cool and have no intent on raiding?  / Are you a player who has a group of friends to raid with and the whole point is to have fun? If yes, then just play Ret, who cares.
---
But if you're a dude who wants to get into hardcore or even semi-hardcore raiding and you have no friends to get you a foothold in a guild then no dont play ret lmao.
---
It's the internet...so yeah.
---
I actually think classic will be better since its an older audience.
---
Yep.  I’ll be turning world channels off and just chatting with guild mates.
---
No it wasn't. There's a strafe bug in the beta where you don't strafe, you actually face to the side.
---
&gt; chomping at the bit
---
champing*
---
But can I put myself at war with the guards in Ratchet
---
yes
---
check latest patch notes from end of beta
---
Well the "official" part is quite important to my statement and I wouldn't consider it pedantic -- they wait until they have a date they KNOW they can make, even if there are internal delays! That is why it is official.
---
I do believe we will be good to do on 8-27
---
That sentence you quoted actually means they’re still planning to release it on August 27.  I don’t know how you’re reading it wrong...
---
Because they had released just one piece of it and that crowd is content hungry. The rest of the game still had content and were happy to play through it. You should check out some of the developer talks from back in the day and some of the developers that stream now. Both Kevin Jordan and Mark Kern talk about this. They explicitly state that raid content was experienced by 5% of the playerbase and the team expected that to be the case, so they spent a lot of time making other experiences highly polished.
---
 151k toxic jerks. Okay, if thats a small minority... say &lt;10% ?... then we're looking at 1.5 million playerbase. I'm good with that.
---
 Blizzard would never do that, they will release broken game, but they wont push release date away.
---
Raptor+Wing Clip eats up a global in situations where you just want to Raptor, but alright.
---
Volley allows you to catch rogues when Flare is on CD and gives you an AoE option for PvE.
---
It works somewhat fine, but you're still missing lots of really good stuff like Scare Beast against druids and Distracting Shot for mob juggling shenanigans. And if you're serious about PvP, consumables and gadgets can easily take up more than 5 keybinds.
---
If you don't have enough druids.
---
Really simple
---
I see this as good news!  Blizzard has had a terrible track record of releasing things on a deadline instead of when they’re ready, especially with retail WoW.  It seems that they are doing much better with this recently, and this transparency is nice.
---
I don't know the context, but I'll always upvote the GOAT Star Trek film.
---
I get that reference.
---
RIP Swearengen
---
It was fairly common in vanilla to have healers using items below thier armor class. I can see how it would feel rolling on coth gear as a paladin/shaman/druid. My counterpoint would be healers are much more a premium in classic. The ret is doing the group a favor by healing... if they always pass upgrades they will not be an effective healer as they get higher in dungeons. Your lvl 40 ret healer rolling in lvl 10-15 healing greens wont do as well. Also, it will save lot of time at higher levels if they want to switch to healer near end game, they already have a set built instead of grinding out all of the best gear before they respec.
---
I'm not trying to being demeaning or belittling, I'm just explaining why I think a personal experience can't possibly provide some reality that contradicts the amount of online data a company like Blizzard would have access to. They know how many people are googling Classic WoW, how many people are watching guides, watching YouTube channels, how many posts there are on the forums, on MMO champion. So much data to extrapolate from and years of experience to compare to other launches. I think it's actually a bit absurd to think otherwise so perhaps that's why it seems like Im being rude - I just can't understand how we can think that we know better.
---
I'm rolling a Priest, and duo'ing with my Mage friend.
---
I'm going Skinning+Mining, and he wants to do Tailoring+Enchanting, but I'm trying my best to convince him to go Skinning+Tailoring instead.
---
For you? I recommend Tailoring+Skinning. You can make and sell bags, which at server launch is HUGE. Tailoring is actually really, really good @ 60 too, so you don't even have to drop it.
---
Maybe things will change once the game release and more people complain, but yeah I guess I just gotta get used to how it's going to be. The game just don't feel as smooth right now
---
Warrior
---
Your examples from Vanilla look fine. Unlike what was shown in the video you provided earlier. [I mean just compare the arc required to hit the targets](https://imgur.com/a/SLdCv0q). It's a massive difference.
---
That's a subjective opinion, though, not a fact.
---
The problem is you can't throw mountains of insanely expensive hardware and resources at the problem when logins will peter off after a month or two. I work at various banks and they can't even afford unnecessary hardware.
---
Warlock is gimped against horde
---
Shaman/grounding / wotlk in bgs is a counter horde locks don’t face.
---
That sentence is corporate speak, straight out of the mouth of an Activision lawyer.
---
Hunter is easy to play, but hard to master because of the dead zone. A good mage can easily exploit the dead zone with frost nova and they have some of the best control abilities in game at the time. There’s going to be tons of shitty hunters—there always are—so if you’re good you’ll stand out.
---
Can't say enough good about the discord, lots of helpful stuff.
---
Yeah I was keeping that for the stress test...
---
&gt; They just don't want the key grind going up into the sky with +25 keys until the end of expansion.
---
idk that seems cooler to me. In a world where the powercreep isnt huge it be cool play the game like this where your constantly striving for higher m+
---
Theres no way thats true.. how could i make up 90% of a community? Your statistics are way off.
---
Vendoring leather as you is 10000% the best way to make gold while leveling. All the leather you farm will be virtually worthless on the AH, but 3s per stack @ lvl 6-9 is freaking HUGE. 30s per stack @ lvl 30 is HUGE. It all really adds up. Get skinning on each and every toon, and for your first toon probably tailoring is best, second toon you can take mining if you want. 
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
If you think age brings maturity, you're very young and don't watch the news.
---
I don't know about you, but having to re-gear and essentially making previous raid progression pointless was kind of a buzz kill. I actually liked TBC, but again you go through the same thing when a new expansion comes out. It becomes a treadmill that eventually you get off of with little satisfaction.
---
I like the level capped at 60 because you can eventually get to a satisfying point. Maybe it's downing rag, maybe it's getting through Naxx or BWL. Then you can always come back and whatever you did not do is waiting for you. Much like other games.
---
I understand any MMO is going to want to do what WoW did with expansions. Yet, there is something comforting about the game staying the same and knowing that they won't make everything you did obsolete.  If I was told Classic WoW would be getting expansions I would not buy it.
---
If I were told new lvl 60 content and UI/graphical improvements would be coming I would welcome it, but that is just me.
---
That is not the statement. The OP vaguely states that dungeon XP is 3-5x better than private server dungeon run XP.
---
Of course anyone will do better XP running a dungeon than sitting in line to kill a zebra in the barrens !
---
Well one is Jagex a notoriously awful at everything company and the other is Blizzard who to my knowledge has never missed a release date.
---
Cant, theres a big delay between FD and trap and half the time it doesnt even drop combat.
---
&gt;an easy accent to type
---
There's no such thing lol. If I see someone with a funky accent, I try to Google it so I can copy/paste it into WoW. :\
---
I remember a few releases where I couldn't login for a few days. Then again I am in South Africa, and Blizz don't give a toss about us down south.
---
You think I don't but I do
---
at least in vanilla you could hold people accountable, there were only so many people on a server if somebody was toxic everybody knew.  too bad that won't work in layered realms classic.
---
Hopefully this has to do with changes to the implementation of their layering tech.
---
I choose to look at it optimistically. Without any evidence admittedly, I hope that the delay is to fix problems with layering. Maybe altering it to work better. I think they are just as concerned about problems with it as we are. And normally instead of just pushing forward anyway because that's "the plan", hopefully they are changing direction with it somehow.
---
I know, that's probably not why. But I can hope. I choose optimism.
---
You can just send "W" or "Up arrow" to everyone to make them move all at once, but I think they will get out of sync sort of.
---
It might work ok to do in AV but would be bothersome. Would mainly just have to run to one location then stay there and kill anyone that gets near it.
---
Only if you're Tauren though, right?
---
no u
---
Redoubt-shield spec.  Anticipation.  Improved conc Aura.
---
I'm gonna dare to be optimistic and hope that they're debating the layering situation and want to sort that out before stress testing.
---
you are the one who brought up macros? who the fuck is setting up their in game macros on a stress test seriously? when leveling is going to take several weeks for your average player. addons take literally 2 seconds to install if you use the twitch mod app which absorbed curse client. some addons havent even been created for the classic game yet. so what exactly are you setting up that you NEED at level one that us entitled americans are going to have before you? and what is to say the macros will carry over from the stress test server to the launch servers? some macros and addons did not carry over from each stress test. some interface settings were even reset for characters even during a server reset DURING the stress test.
---
Release days for most online games these days are a shit show across the globe.
---
Idk what to feel. I’m already pissed about the “Launching SUMMER 2019”.... not fall. The hype for me is gone. It’s been years we’ve been waiting for this. All of EA Blizzards horrible decisions in retail. I’m becoming more and more jaded towards classic. Dunno if I’m even gonna bother to play.
---
Soul link warlock is god mode. The end.
---
Legion launch was pretty good, the BFA one was definitely scuffed as fuck, for most servers unless you had an IPv6 connection you literally couldn't log in.
---
0/30/21 or 1/29/21 druid can tank dungeons, off-tank a fair bit of raid content, spot heal, run flags, etc.
---
8/11/32 can heal anything, also run flags, off tank fairly well in a pinch by swapping gear, and everyone will like you.
---
14/32/5 is full pve feral (slight choice between focusing bear or cat), no nature's swiftness, but you'll still be pretty well off in PvP and you grant leader of the pack.
---
You cant call it a leveling build if it gets its extra dmg at 50+.
---
A Leveling build would be a build you spec all kinds of odd stuff thats strong early to make the overall leveling time faster.
---
The first damage increase in that build is @ lvl 25 as earliest and thats still a very low increase if the intent is going to SL @ 40, wich essentially is a waste while levling of 14 talentpoints.
---
If you put 1 point in corruption @ lvl 10 you would get a damage increase from your first talentpoint.
---
You can play any build all the way to 60, but this build would make 1-50 alot more time consuming than the other talent trees.
---
If a spell doesn’t do direct damage, the grounding totem will absorb it (“immune” will flash above it) and not disappear.  So counterspell, polymorph, dots will all be eaten by a single grounding totem.
---
You taurens love the mountain rocks more than the trees. You're not infidels, but you are definitely heretics
---
You all have new jokes, don’t you?
---
This has to be a joke.
---
Does it matter if they do it themselves or if it's out-sourced ? Either way if there was an unexpected issue it would've caused a delay.
---
Lets put it this way. Early on, you'll be sitting on 12s easy while everyone else is sitting on 3-4s. And 25s+ while everyone else is sitting on 7-8. Just from vendoring leather. You'll be killing sooooo many beasts, ESPECIALLY in the gnome/dwarf starting zones. Dun Morogh is a skinner's wet dream. Just make sure you literally skin EVERY thing you come by. Good xp, and good money.
---
The thing people need to understand is that it's going live 8/27 and any bugs still around at that point are going to on track to be patched later.
---
Maybe there will be queues or something because layering didn't work out or demand was higher than they thought, or maybe they last second add more servers, or maybe something happens no one expects and they have to come up with an emergency response or just ride it out and they give everyone a couple free days on their sub. But no matter how much goes wrong (or doesn't), Classic is coming out August 27.
---
Addons don't take two seconds to install and set up, neither do macros.
---
I did mention macros but I didn't mention any specific singular one. Which means it's pretty fucking weird that you decided you would, as if that counters anything I said.
---
PVP gear should be better in PVP, and pve gear should be worse in PVP. I don't care how long you grinded against a scripted encounter. I care how long you fought other players. 
---
TBC Wpvp was amazing.  Hellfire. Zang. Hala. All these zones had some of the best Wpvp ever in the game.
---
&gt;Frequency alone doesn't make chomping at the bit correct, but most style guides and dictionaries I checked also refrain from going so far as to state that it is incorrect. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a grammar nazi who typically cares about things like this and you're right, 'chomping' is essentially just as accepted as 'champing,' but the latter is still the "correct" term.
---
Nope, its @ 20.
---
Is there really that much BiS gear though? I know Hand of Justice and Ironfoe is in great demand, but looking at loot tables of UBRS or so, almost every item is someones BiS, which isn't really the case in BRD, where only a select few, often rare items are extraordinarily good compared to the rest.
---
&gt; - Arena doesnt give the best gear, instead it gives cosmetics like mounts, titles, tabards etc.
---
That's completely fine as long as all PvE gear is banned from arena play.
---
Vanilla Druids really do suck ass, at least in pvp.
---
In PVE they arent even good either.
---
Judging from ANY forum, EVERYWHERE is toxic.
---
I've never had a grandpa :(
---
No, you don't delay a stress test because you think the testing will be too effective and your servers will get stressed to their limit. Why would you even think they would do that? Even if they couldn't support everyone online they still have queueing functionality. If they didn't want to use that they could easily use some cloud services vendor for the stress test. All that aside, it's built on their retail architecture which already supports millions of concurrent logins. There is nothing to test there except for specific classic systems.
---
They clearly have some specific thing they want to implement to have it tested during the stress test and it's not done yet. Probably something layering related as that's the biggest thing that will get tested during the stress test.
---
Define "unfinished".
---
You are totally missing the point.
---
&gt;Druids in Vanilla, as well as in Classic...will be bellow Prot Warriors, in both THREAT and SURVIVABILITY, by a good margin
---
You could literally halve the amount of threat generated by Druids on private servers and they would still marginally outperform a Warrior in threat gear.
---
Good try though.

Was your mouse made in the last 10 years? It's probably fine. 
---
Only an extremely old mouse with delay or ghosting problems would mean you had to upgrade for WoW.
---
You would never use Blizzard on top of yourself to try and get someone out of stealth. I think that goes without saying...
---
Thats terrible advice, transmog is properly one of the slowest sellers on ah. Materials is quick gold, farm volatile life/air/earth/water/fire.
---
Didn't get one, asked a friend. Didn't get one either
---
I heard that it's going to be missing all kinds of shit, like entire continents and pandas.
---
No they didn't. I haven't played Retail in forever and got nothing.
---
what apparently is eluding you, is that i have told you several times now these have reset. i did not have my macros and addons between each test. because yes i set up a macro to pull up the thunderfury link so i could link it in chat. guess what, wasnt there on the last stress test. so they wont be there when the game launches so i have 0 advantage. but keep skipping that point by all means. i cant setup addons either because guess what? they arent made yet. there are maybe a handful of addons that are made for the classic client so far. do you need help finding mandriks wife? i can tell you where she is without atlas / questhelper or tomtom whichever you are planning to use.
---
Warrior can be great for pvp.  but only if BIS geared. otherwise you're a bump in the road.   go rogue if you want to wreck face w/o being best in slot.  See youtube for ming's world class balance.
---
To add on to this, my bro was never really into keyboard hotkeys and was always a clicker. Getting a razer naga helped make a lot more of his action bars clickable too. Personally, I use a bit of both the keyboard and the mouse.
---
When we quit WoW I ended up using the Naga for work. You can save a "profile" (keybinds and shortcuts) to a program so for example I have a basic desktop mode with the numbers bound to copy, cut, paste and in Adobe Illustrator I add more keybinds to switch between the tools I most frequently use (also have ctrl+s bound to one click).
---
Mythic raiders are pussies tbh. Bfa.
---
Thanks!
---
I actually think the official forums are much much worse
---
I would love to see official age demographics from Blizzard about the Classic Player base.
---
I'm 27, i would wager a vast majority are 25-33, it would just be so interesting to see, maybe I'm wrong maybe it'll capture the younger demographic.
---
I raided very little in vanilla and My memories of making dungeon groups are that warriors were pretty much unwanted as dps as they had the worst utility of all classes. This might change a bit with more druid and pala tanks but this was definetly a fact in vanilla.
---
I've never played on a PVE server before. My leveling partner will go on a PVE server and I'm making a character there with her. I've read that supposedly players raid cities and villages on PVE server. Is it possible that I have been deceived?:o
---
They don't have reset. You can copy them. You're actually insane.
---
When blizzard say its working as intended they mean its working like it works on their reference client, problem is, their reference client has that bug too =/
---
....ugh
---
can't imagine why else you're rooting for people to be upset over something they look forward to.
---
Can confirm, vanilla vet with a 4 week old baby... why did They have to release Classic the year we choose to get pregnant 😂
---
leveling is a big part of the game, dont try to rush it through
---
Love you, babe!!!
---
Ele did good dps for 30sec, then oom and melee. Meme spec.
---
well yeah, bfa
---
Thanks for the updates!
---
Was nerfing WF a bug? nope it wasnt, i dont see your logic.
---
I was never hardcore "no changes", but as we get more details, I'm actually kind of glad such a precise recreation will exist. That said, I also want them to fork the project and have "classic+" servers for actually playing on long term.
---
Could you imagine the outrage if they delayed the release?
---
I’m pretty sure to saying is the inverse... Typically if you think everyone else the problem, you’re probably the problem.
---
Saving this for 8/27.
---
Ive already rehomed both of my cats. No time to feed/water and change the litter box. Plus the rehoming fee pays for 2 months.
---
Don't blizzard use AWS? If they do and they're not tight-fisted with there money, It'll be like nothing, Like BfA's and Legions releases was, where they used AWS. 
---
It's agile, it will balloon with demand and dimish as demand lowers too, they spin up in seconds, it's an incredible tech.
---
There's a very big gap between "class homogenization" and "the rogue can go afk and out dps you with white damage."
---
What you say is good on paper but it's just not executed well in vanilla. The utility isn't strong enough to justify being completely pointless in terms of throughput. It's a deeply broken game.
---
I'm going into classic completely green and will most likely roll Alliance because it seems they are more willing to help new players. My question is how are the horde in that regard? 
---
And about Pvp, specifically world Pvp, if 2 people are of similar skill, and lets's say both playing specs that don't necessarily counter each other, will horde more often win this match up simply because of their racials?
---
I think you focus more on the "OutLoud" than the "Th1nk."
---
I like how you twist the numbers in your favor lol. DR reduces cc duration by 50%, somehow you twist the numbers to make it look like none DR trap is 15sec and DR trap is 13sec, hillarious
---
Depends on your commitment to the farm. On Silver Hand the recent PVP Last Fresh Launch prior to the Classic release, there were multiple locks at 60 with epic mounts already running around not even a month into the game. Look up farming strats for Warlocks, some play the AH some farm Mara, on that server there was also DM on launch so i know mages go there as well. But a comparison of 2 classes farming is pretty hard. Mainly due to the nature of Mages have more safety in kiting whereas locks can handle lower lvl mobs with Voidwalker tanking. Mara blues or even Ring runs could yield 100g/hr. So 10 hours for an epic mount aint too shabby. sorry for the late reply
---
DING DING DING
---
Working as intended means it works like their reference client, wich ALSO has that bug..
---
Is it really that much of a big deal? I mean yeah it could be easier as a hunter like you suggest. But saying there is a "sheer lack of farming ability" is just hyperbolic.
---
This is particularly great advice for me personally, thankyou!
---
I know it's not one of your self-imposed options, but I would consider rogue, specifically sword rogue.  If you aren't mechanically gifted, then I think rogue's gameplay is much easier than mage's.  It's tough to answer because you say you're "COMPLETELY" new yet you've played some retail.  No matter what you do, nothing wrong with playing a class for an hour or so and trying something else.
---
To your first question, there is no "nicer side" it's a case by case basis. 
---
To your second question, racials do not play a big roll, alliance racials are good situationally and so are horde.
---
On private servers there were a lot of low lvl shamans/warriors. Most dont make it past lvl 25 or so.
---
Blizzard probably does, but Activision definitely does. CoD: WWII was completely unplayable on release for 5 hours. Absolutely nobody could get in due to the influx of logins.  
---
Black Ops 4 saw the highest numbers of pre-release and day 1 sales of all time for Call of Duty, and the servers had absolutely no problems on 12:01 AM release date.
---
So Soul Link will not be removable by enemies in PvP via dispel/purge? Or can it be dispelled from the player? Not at all seems ideal.
---
Reddit is a circlejerk community. Instead of coming here for a discussion, you get an echo chamber.
---
&gt;DAE think bfa bad and classic good!?!??? ***+165***
---
&gt;Thoughts on this hybrid dps/healing spec for this class? ***-17, "you're bad", "go back to modern wow" "stop trolling" "reported for shitposting" etc***
---
FYI druids are for masochists in classic wow. Be careful what you're getting yourself into if you roll druid.
---
Okay cya on August 27th
---
No its not, if you cant see one of the character stepping on the stones and the other is not, i dont know what to tell you tbh
---
Disc priest can heal in pve and pvp, your pve heals won't be as good as holy, but every raid brings 1 disc priest for the improved power word shield.
---
Not at the start, because no one will have raid gear. But eventually yes, it was a thing.
---
they do reset. they were not there when i hit /macro for the 2nd stress test. they were deleted. yes you can copy and paste the script lines if you want and save them in a word document, or you know, google them since they have been there for 15 years now
---
Oh hey look this thread again.
---
I would run dungeons for the loot.
---
This video raises several questions:
---
- how does he fake to jump downturn? He turns mid air to land where he started, e.g. 3:06
---
Is it some slow fall potion?
---
- what possibilities are there to change appearance? If I remember correctly some noggerfogger elixir and some deviant fish meal?
---
- what do you think how is this guy specced?
---
Thx
---
0% chance this is the case. I'm a systems engineer and i mostly work on new infrastructure deployments, etc. It's the 21st damn century. They have, not only, elastic resource pools, and servers to fuckin boot, but I would be surprised if they weren't leveraging virtual servers/"cloud" servers as an "oh shit" backup
---
It's not 2006 any more. They don't have a closet full of Dell Blades, dude. 
---
Translation: "Everyone on this subreddit acts like a know-it-all, about things they painfully obviously don't know-it-all about."
---
It may sound strange but I swear it's better for the game at large. It mandates player interaction and makes every given player and class much more valuable. It's not usually a problem if the server isn't underpopulated. Also if you get a good group, they usually like to run places multiple times (especially the multiple scarlet monastery instances) so you'll often not even need to find multiple groups for something you need to run multiple times.
---
As far as I know, you only need to activate it at that health % and it applies the strength of the buff for the duration.  So if you use it, spam 1 second lesser healing waves back to full, the remainder of the berserker buff is still at full strength.
---
Its not a dynamic buff that constantly checks your health% along its duration.
---
&gt;racials do not play a big roll  
---
Come back and say that again after an orc full resists your Hammer of Justice.
---
You can raid as ret, 8/8 tier 1 and Nightfall and you're Gucci.
---
Something I struggled with in vanilla was earning gold. For classic, I'd like to change that. What professions are the biggest money makers? My first thought was herbalism+alchemy, but I didn't use any professions other than mining and enchanting in vanilla so I don't know if that's the best choice. I'm going to be playing a mage.
---
I do not think you understod me.  
---
If my pet knows Claw rank 1 and I use this pet ONLY all game long will he learn new ranks of Claw as he levels up / will they become avalible in a pet training tab or i have to stable it, tame a pet with Claw rank 2, 3, 4 etc to learn higher rank for my stabled (and all others to come) pet?
---
I never played shaman but started leveling one on a private server and it's for sure going to be the 2nd character i level up. 
---
All these things have been said but the thigns I love leveling a shaman is 
---
1. Ghost wolf at 20 is great. After leveling a warlock this speed increase for 20 levels before your mount is SO nice. 
---
2. You can do spell damage, physical damage, and take damage all equally well and without swapping stances or forms or anything. It's just you all the time and you can do all the stuff. It's so much fun starting off a mob with some spells then letting them wail on you for little damage while you wail on them for actual damage. I've gone full mana efficiency spec in order to reduce downtime and it might not be the fastest but I'm loving it. 
---
3. Astral Recall is amazing, I never go "i should hearth, oh i gotta wait". No waiting. It rules. 
---
4. Totems are kinda weird at first but once you're used to them they're really fun. Trying to place them in spots where you can pull mobs to them and use for multiple pulls adds a puzzle aspect to killing mobs. If you're bad at it it's not a big deal, but if you're good at it it's a lot of fun and satisfying to lay down some totems and just claim a section of land and keep pulling mobs to your spot like you own these 30 square yards. 
---
Honestly haven't done many dungeons yet, but as far as just questing solo I think Shaman is the 2nd most fun class I've leveled (warlock being first). 
---
4.
---
No, its obviously a shot at the pserver players who are supposably to blind or doomsayers that they didnt notice the same leeway on the pserver and only complained in classic beta.
---
!remindme on 8/27/2019
---
To the point about racials, no. Differences in classes, specs, and skill, even if small, would matter a lot sooner than racials would. There's plenty of alliance warlocks wrecking undead on world pvp videos. Aftershock, one of my favorite classic mages, is a human. Pretty much gaining nothing from racials. Yet she dominates.
---
Mr. Samsung, I don't feel so good.
---
I think this is fine.
---
Probably not at launch since there wont be high levels. Also, the XP modifier for having someone 5+ levels is severe. You would mostly be benefiting from the quests you have to do and receiving dungeon loot.
---
Some classes and talent specs will entirely preclude people from efficiently running lowbies through anything past SM.
---
Except you don't know what will and will not work that worked 15 years ago if you don't have the fucking client.
---
Ok, thats what I was looking for. Thanks.
---
I played PvE Dalaran in vanilla, but I've been playing a PVP server in preparation for classic to try it out, and I can say I don't care for it at all.  I've just made it to STV and only experienced balanced fights so far (no 60 ganking), started by the other person, and I've usually won.  All but 1 "loss" was with us both dying.  To me it's just an annoying obstacle keeping me from advancing with the quests and the story.  It's definitely not going to be everyone's cup of tea.  
---
But to each their own.  I have 0 interest in the world PVP bloodbaths.  I never got into the animosity between horde and alliance and always leaned toward pacifism anyway.  As a paladin, my fight was always predominantly with the scourge.
---
Yes it is black and white when he is like   
---
"lol dumb pserver players didnt notice leeway untill classic beta even tho they played with it for 4-5years"
---
He's salty because the shitty Warlock build that he posted a couple hours ago got downvoted. 
---
His account is also ten days old as well, which is a red flag for trolling. Don't pay any attention to this bullshit.
---
To be fair, I don't think I ever played a priest in vanilla.  Would need to test it. I honestly don't know.
---
I like your post. I play retail, but obviously enjoy some things about it (and hate some things about it, too). It's like they're two different games with a lot of similarities. 
---
If I had more energy I'd try to come up with more strengths of retail because I do feel there are more than just #aesthetics and rotation, but nothing's coming to mind right now.
---
Yes orcs resist stuns 25% of the time, drawfs can clear poisons, gnomes can escape snares, tauren can melee range stun, undead can break a fear. 
---
These are all known potentials though, it's not like you can't factor these possibilities into your decision making.
---
i mean, they aren't all the same lol
---
He was saying people on the news are toxic, not telling you to turn on fox news or cnn.

apology for poor English

when were you when john lenin dies?  
---
I was sat at home eating smegma butter when pjotr ring  
---
“john is kill”  
---
“no”
---
The entire video is about healing and cleansing the flag carrier...
---
Casual guild?
---
Be friends first and raiders second, if you get a good group of friends you will be able to clear some content
---
&gt;For every amazing/nail-biting/exhilarating PvP experience you have (and those ARE fun) there will be 9 times you'll be corpse camped/ganked.
---
Tis better to have PvP'd and lost than to have never PvP'd at all.
---
That is kind of good.
---
It does.  Now 60 somethings shaking their canes at "at kids these days" is an entirely different issue than a 12 yr old who rages in tradechat.  Im looking forward to the average age in this game being like 30.  Sure we can still be dicks, but playing mmos with a higher average age and playing one with a lot of highschool and middleschool kids is absolutely worlds apart in maturity level.
---
I got asked lots of times by random strangers in capital cities if I could run them through some loser level dungeon. Mostly if I had the time I did, back then people didn’t ask for gold either when they did this.
---
I made quite a few friends along the way by doing so.
---
I’m in US, and I got those.
---
Hah, you're not wrong. I did it myself, and I guess I just want to hype it. I'm not familiar with priest pve vs pvp, and I don't know enough about warriors to comment on those angles.
---
For sure everyone has their own tastes, I personally really got a lot out of the heightened worry with horde nearby when starting as alliance. Could never get too low etc.
---
Just a bit of a thrill!
---
But PvP some people totally hate and then there's everything in between so each to their own.

Toxicity is more noticeable than anything else you might experience in game and on the forums.  However on forums you can’t really get away from the toxicity you see unless you literally don’t read the forums. In game you will definitely see some toxicity in general/trade chat, yells, and on occasion in your guild/party/whispers. However in a game like Classic WoW, players will be less likely to be toxic in game since the repercussions are worse than in other games or renditions of WoW. Things like blacklists and bans mean a little more. Furthermore, with your ability to ignore players or specific channels you can limit your in game  exposure to toxicity even more. 
---
I think you will meet more positive, friendly players while playing Classic WoW than you’ll meet toxic players. It may feel more toxic than not, but that’s just how negative emotions work and you need to work hard to combat that feeling.
---
Thanks for the burn, lol :P
---
"insanely expensive" lmao
---
The fact that you said prot War is best tank and very good in WPvP in wrath shows you know literally nothing about that expansion.
---
I would be very surprised if blizzard doesn't already have certain names assigned to certain streamers accounts before the name grabbing opens up to the masses
---
For a mage, go mining/engi while leveling, drop mining for tailoring once you have your 60 mount (and thus don't need mining mats/income)
---
Patchwerk.
---
As for being healed in other fights, well you may be able to arrange something with your healers, but much more unlikely yeah.
---
That might be exactly why it was pushed back.
---
RuneScape compared to Classic Wow... What's the correlation?
---
I thought about something like that. The one downside is having to hit wand after a stun or something which would mute it instead of play. I just think it would be awesome to just have my wand play the song :P
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Guys... do babies give dishonorable kills? Just wondering is all.
---
Herb alch is excellent for mage
---
Just don't be like that couple that actually neglected their baby until it died
---
Also people need to remember that the things theyre testing wont make it into the live game until months after launch.
---
Seriously. I'm meh about retail but playing it anyway (good to pass time tbh), and most of the post was just REEEEEE.
---
Then again...if you notice some of the op's responses to other people, they have like zero reading comprehension skill, so...I'd take it all with a grain of salt anyway.
---
Warriors can't get away with dual PvP/PvE spec, but priests can raid as disc (1 disc priest per raid) for the improved shields.
---
What?  That is such a non-sequitor.  I guess you think classes don't play a big role either since you can anticipate what they'll do?
---
Ahem, shamans are off tanks too, especially on caster mobs.  Between earth shock and grounding totem they get shut down and bursted.  It’s almost like the mob didn’t exist.
---
Theoretically, but we're not talking about some provider rolling out hardware specifically for WoW Classic. This is Blizzard emailing AWS or MS Azure or whoever and saying "we'll need X cores and Y terabytes, could balloon up to 3x" or something like that and the person on the other end just says "sure" because they are enormous.
---
No kidding. Has he looked at any political discussions? We're practically sitting around in top hats drinking tea, by comparison.
---
&gt; No, you don't delay a stress test because you think the testing will be too effective and your servers will get stressed to their limit.
---
That's such a good point. I didn't even think of it. Another great example of this subreddit just talking out of their ass lol
---
Worst part was she told them I was getting back on. I think people just see the greyed out name and just automatically kick. Nobody even talks in groups anymore as soon as you're done people just leave without so much as a "gg". Classic can't come soon enough. I know there will be people like that at first but I hope they wash out quick.
---
is it on the GCD?
---
I think the best way would be to decrease the ilevel from Naxx and aq with 20% and bwl with 10% and keep the mobs numbers as they are. This way you would Keep content relevant for longer, lessen the gear gap in PvP and if you want you could add another raid tier.
---
I will drama queen the fuck out if it doesn't release on August 27th I can promise you that.
---
You don't get concussive shot until level 8. How are you kiting these mobs?
---
I think the whole reason the stress test is delayed is because they're not underestimating it
---
It can't.  The best thing you can do is kill their pet and spam purge on them to dispel the 15 minute instant summon buff.  Then cry under your desk when they use their soulstone with dots and drain life to ace your ankh.
---
So how old are you?
---
World of Warcraft has a documentary called "Looking for group" that they posted on their YouTube like 4 years ago that covers the creation of the game and the current expansion, which I think was Warlords of draenor.
---
So are you offtanking in 5-mans?
---
*An average /r/classicwow denizen who definitely doesn't play a rogue or a fury warrior:* WoW is first and foremost an RPG. Retail has forgotten about this and turned it into an action game. There's an obsession with DPS which has ruined the uniqueness of the classes. Vanilla's comical imbalance is actually really quite genius. Other specs bring valuable utility that compensate for their lack of throughput. It is also imperative and clever game design that rogues be oppressively overpowered in battlegrounds. 
---
*Also said average /r/classicwow denizen who in no way plays a rogue or warrior:* Nice meme spec you fucking cuck, you won't be getting any groups and no guild will take you. Your utility doesn't make up for doing less damage than the tank, retard. Literally no reason to not play one of four dps specs. 
---
Basically I wish more people were willing to admit they just like Vanilla and didn't need to pretend it was actually genius class balance. 
---
The game worked well as an RPG in the original release. After being exposed to years of scrutiny and min/maxing, it's just obviously deeply broken. 
---
Standing around unable to do anything useful until you have to use your one button that is actually integral to defeating the boss is just horseshit game design, end of.
---
There's a trick around this. Have the low level pull (with threat), high level drops group, kills everything, rejoins group before the 30 second kick timer runs out.
---
"extra layered"! that's a new one.
---
you can copy your wow data folders that contain your macros and addons
---
Lmao ok chief seeya on launch
---
Play a Warrior unless your a die hard Druid fan....Warriors easily the best class in the game.
---
Me and my friends mostly did it for our twink characters later on
---
Racials are a tiny % of what a class is. You're just looking for arguments at this point.
---
&gt; (on bnet, reddit seems not too bad surprisingly)
---
Except for this entire thread full of "LOL THEIR SERVERS ARE TOO WEAK" idiots talking out of their asses haha.
---
We'll need to see around 500k people subscribing for 12 months to see a 1% increase in revenue.  If Classic WoW attracts a million or two, we're going to see the stock go up for sure.
---
The misinformation in the title of this post alone really goes well with the general butt hurt that seems to be going along with this blue post. The fact that everyone feels like blizzard is obligated to give this stress test is just stupidity. The blue post says the game is on track for the release date. Would you rather the outstanding bugs get fixed or would you rather a 2 day fix for your addiction...
---
&gt;"insanely expensive" lmao
---
those hip thrusts don't do any damage, you're too fluffy.
---
That’s true, I def remember old school, it got convoluted when they merged all the servers and you couldn’t get people to run with/pvp with regularly.
---
I remember playing as horse and there were alliance guys in my server that I could recognize every time I PVP’d and I would try to kill them. That went away after vanilla and the social aspect got worse after that
---
We're in a thread saying it's bad. That means it's bad. 
---
Like, if this were a news article reporting that the flu has killed twice as many people this year as last year, you're welcome to leave a comment "sure the flu can be bad, but I think it'll be better this year," but...the fact remains.
---
For both Horde and Alliance, which classes are the best at solo clearing dungeons intended for levels 25-45. My classic plans heavily involve creating Twinks in the 20-29 and 30-39 bracket and I plan on having two accounts (1 for my lvl 60 and 1 for the twinks) so that I can run myself through dungeons for BOP twink gear. 
---
Basically wondering which class at level 60 will have the easiest time clearing those dungeons quickly and efficiently. Obviously all classes can do it, but which class would be the best.
---
One thing I miss is the lore episodes. Hopefully you do some more of those eventually.
---
Cuz blizzard if full of gooch smoochers
---
Comparing Jagex to ATVI in 2019 lol
---
It will definitely be a thing again. When me or my guildies were bored, we'd go to westfall and offer free deadmines runs in general chat. Always got lots of happy takers.
---
I know that very few people did raiding. That's because its huge time commitment along with requiring coordination and whatnot. Not that casual friendly at all while leveling is mostly mindless.  
---
It did serve as a destination for people to strive for. That's why you'll hear people say its good that 1% of the playerbase saw Naxx.  
---
&gt;they added Mauradon, Dire Maul, the honor system, battlegrounds, tons of quests, tons of items post-launch. I’m not sure the majority of post-launch content was raid content, lmao  
---
All those you listed are maybe equivalent to 1 raid. Especially pvp part. Little to no work needed for battlegrounds. Just slap the terrain and code in the resource, while with raids you have to design all the bosses and their looks, abilities in addition to terrain.
---
Convincing.
---
I don't give a shit if Blizzard hands someone a full set of mythic gear, you won't be able to time a +15.  The community measures progression with io score now, and repeatedly proving oneself under timed conditions.  Embarrassing that you haven't figured that out yet.
---
I always like how it looked, but it felt the least like an actual city of all the city's in WoW. So less immersive to me.
---
then we can google, and check twitch streamers. while a lot of those guys do very little testing of stuff like this and just do it to build their stream, there are plenty of useful people that have been extensively testing these things along with other stuff to find bugs. and the really good ones are posting this info for people like you, me and everyone else that does not get to test the game for several months. if anyone is getting an unfair advantage, it is all of the twitch streamers that are getting beta access for several months over almost everyone else including people that have played this game since day one.
---
TIL! Thanks!
---
Generally speaking that's what I remember. 
---
Holy was just better at healing, disc was more of a support + shield role with some smite spam for dps.
---
Holy shit the comments there are absolute cancer
---
You work at a financial research company and you know squat about budget. LMAO!!
---
Incorrect. We can't verify anything on Google. We can't also verify addon dependent ones.
---
Just admit you're wrong. Also speak in proper paragraphs.
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
I cant imagine they manage bare metal servers themselves anymore. No reason the login service in particular couldn't autoscale indefinitely. I imagine the delay is for another reason
---
Just also remember their younger years are when the foundations of a bond are made. There is time for games and hobbies, but it is a balance like anything else, and first attention is on the child(ren).
---
Going to play a dwarf female paladin. Will try out all 3 roles while leveling but probably settle as a healer at 60. Nothing bad about that. But I still have that nagging itch to try out druid...
---
As someone who is gonna guild lead, no. If everyone went engineering, who the heck is gonna make pots, flasks, arcanite bars, and enchant stuff? I'll be the enchanter, i'd much rather be a boon to everyone around me than fart some sapper charges out
---
2012 says hi.
---
7 years ago
---
I have done it for people.
---
I was back in the Barrens doing some harvesting and some guy was LFG for WC without any luck so I shot him a message asking him if he wanted me to run him through.  He had the quests, so I told him to set it to ML and I went through killing everything and he left the dungeon with bags full of blues/greens and the quests done.
---
Sure, if you want to see it that way. Not everyone who has aspergers is an asshole, but when they are, it's a qualitatively different kind of asshole. And since we're talking about people being assholes, I'm referring to the ones who are specifically assholes, and that qualitative difference.  If you want to assume that I'm denigrating all people with aspergers in order to throw out the baby with the bathwater, you go right ahead. I'll assume you would have found some other excuse to anyway, 'cause that's the move of an asshole.
---
That is a specific part of Auctioneer called Informant, you don't need to run the entire suite for that info to be displayed in the tooltip.
---
I took retail for a spin for the first time since a two month comeback in Cata to try Rated BGs.  Figured why not since I had already paid for a month to check out the stress test and also learned that I could liquidate my old 900k gold stash to get a few months of Classic for free.
---
I lasted three hours.  Complete garbage.
---
Yes if there is already a healer.  Let’s say there’s a tough 4 pull.  One-two get CC’d, tank handles 1-2, and a shaman (or rogue) mugs the 4th caster mob.  It works great and takes pressure off the tank and healer.
---
Bear form for spurts of heavy damage travel form out doors cat form indoors hot yourself inbetween combats hot yourself if youre coming up to a combat hug the sides of the map shapeshift out of cc use charge to gain ground try to drop cc on enemy flag carrier if you run by each other. Know when to turtle and when to keep moving stay by your healers. Try to know when the speed buffs are available in the hallways and bring potions.
---
What's the difference to how people thought it was?
---
I find it rather toxic. Most posts are voted to zero for no apparent reason.
---
People buy Cata mats? Why?
---
Shamans polls actually decline by quite a bit when you survey PvE servers, because  a lot of people are rolling shaman for PvP or damage. Resto shamans will always be the most in demand for end game horde guilds.
---
My baby was born in April... if only I timed it better...
---
True.. Ironforge is my personal favorite
---
I always just select the highest value reward and vendor it.  
---
Playing Mage, Priest? That mail worth 13c is more valuable than the cloth that gives +2 armor and worth only 5c.
---
TIA
---
I mean it’s debatable, but either way, the reason they added it later is so that they could ship the game without having finished all of the raid content. Not because they saw it as the primary focus of the game.
---
I agree that it’s good that few raiders saw raid content. It made people excited and gave the game an air of mystery. Plus raiders love to be the only ones to have achieved something.
---
alchemy is solid, everyone needs potions.  Enchanting is a big money*sink* if you dont have a guild feeding you and helping you get rare patterns.
---
Its the internet in 2019. It never had a chance to not be.
---
let them delay the release if there are still bugs and inconsistences, I'm quite ok with that
---
Paladins are a ton of fun if you're group is trash and you're not the designated healer. Pulling off clutch heals, stuns, bubbles, etc. 
---
DPS wise you're not doing much, but it's a great support/utility class.
---
I have to give some background before I can truthfully answer your question.  
---
I played in a guild that was not quite casual, but not quite hardcore.  We raided 2-3 nights a week for 3-4 hours.  We weren't racing for any server firsts, and the culture of the guild was very "Friends and Family" in its vibe.   
---
In my experience back when the game was originally released, yes the damage was low.  I never felt like I was so laughably low as to be mocked, but I was never top 10 DPS in the raids.  I was more middle of the pack, but you have to understand that in a 40 person raid, there were a LOT of people who played mostly AFK.  I remember beating some rogues and hunters, and I kind of wonder if I was there mostly to measure who was slacking lol.  Like "Your DPS is lower than our paladin, pick it up."   If you get to raid as Ret, even though your DPS will be lower, you will NOT feel useless.  It's fun to throw backup heals or other support things.  There were times I felt like I completely saved the raid with a quick off-heal (not sure if it was reality, but it felt that way!)  
---
All that being said, there is a new "Spelladin" build out there if you have the time and willingness to put forth a lot more effort farming consumables that looks like it can have very good DPS. I'm not sure I do, but it could also be an option.   It's limited in its options for weapons though, which kind of ruins the fantasy for me.
---
I meant this strictly for leveling PvE where you would always sit in battle stance just changing weapons, not stances.
---
Yes, it was a band aid fix essentially rather than addressing the scaling issues.
---
Google knows...ask it
---
How is this real news? No one genuinely expected Blizz to miss this launch date.
---
Guess I never considered down voting toxic, people just down vote stuff that gets posted a lot
---
I like the segments with Kevin and John too, but they're often unknowledgable about the questions being asked.  That goes for Jordan especially.  He was the thematic class designer and not the actual mechanics guy.  Like in the druid podcast, Taladril knew so much more than him in terms of actual abilities and rotational mechanics.  That's almost a given that a person that specializes in druids over the last decade knows more about the mechanics than the designer, but Kevin says things like, "we really liked the big druid AoE," and when pressed for details it turns out that AoE never even made it into the game.  
---
It's similar with John.  He was the level designer for the dungeons.  That means he pretty much did nothing buy laying out the inside of dungeons and was pretty far removed from the actual encounters, items, and quests that were added after he worked on it.  A LOT of the questions he gets asked pertain to the encounters, items, and quests rather than the general layout and applied textures.
---
I'm reading John's book now and it's just pretty crazy how they came together and made this game we all love so much, when a lot of the people worked on small segments and didn't ever really see the full picture.  From what I'm getting though, they really did just wing the entire thing and got lucky that their employees were so dedicated to their roles that it just happened to create a good product.
---
Things like Molten Core and Scholomance were total accidents and wound up being major areas in the endgame.  A lot of the stuff seems to just be, "happy little accidents."
---
That's a whole lot of words to justify being an asshole.
---
I used this macro on my mage for arcane int.  You could probably modify it for Power word fort.  This was used on a p server and may not work with the new client.
---
/run a="Arcane Intellect" b={1,4,18,32,47} c="target" d="(Rank " e=CastSpellByName if (UnitLevel(c) \~= nil and UnitIsFriend("player",c)) then for i=5,1,-1 do if (UnitLevel(c) &gt;= b\[i\]) then e(a..d..i..")") return end end else e(a,1) end
---
Oh boy, you sure you want to insult my real life status?  Judging by your post history, you do this a lot while touting your own shitty job.  
---
While you're working till you're 65, I'm already semi-retired at 30 with enough money in the bank to live comfortably off interest.  Self-made.  So nope, never worked for corporate america, and never will.
---
So hey, yeah, nothing in life is guaranteed, and that includes your precious WoW classic release date.
---
I can understand when there are dozens of threads made on the topic but when its just a conversation within a post talking about "BC class balancing in Vanilla would be cool" its kinda fucked. People in this sub chimp out over any discussion about BC / WOTLK features.
---
Looking at molderan's 540 tests of weapon speeds, there isn't much of a significant difference using the weapon buffs at level 60. At level 40 in beta the rock biter buff was always on top of every other weapon buff for each different weapon speeds.  I think flametongue will only be the best when it is newly trained and you are fighting high armor mobs.  Usually, you will be better off with rock biter, or rolling the dice on windfury.  
---
Windfury kind of is anti synergistic with flurry, because the windfury procs eat up charges of flurry.  Yes, the final windfury proc could be a crit just as likely as the first swing in the chain.  That and I also don't like the talents below flurry in the enhancement tree.  I am leaning towards an elemental furry shaman, that then goes for resto's 3% hit, 40 minute ankh, and +10 yard totems.  The amenities they provide feel a lot more impactful than 5% crit to melee.  The trade off is getting NS over 5pts of flurry for picking resto over enhancement for the level 30- 60 journey.
---
These are exactly my thoughts. I don't want to cause wipes or make major mistakes
---
I agree with crafting the most. I think eng takes up too much of the profession pie in vanilla, others could be brought to more equal level that makes choosing profs more of a character defining aspect.
---
Not even pure stat gear, but fun items could be worked into other profs. Tailors with spell reflect or invis capes, more unique patches for lw, enchanters getting trinkets with weird effects like making people fall asleep.
---
That is completely not why raids bring disc priests.  Who told you that garbage?
---
&gt; Retail have some great new features. 
---
i dont like most of the new features nor do i like the philosophy behind the current gameplay. What are you trying to do exactly? Cuz you are just getting on my nerves. Okay cool classic "isnt as good as retail" thanks for the tip!
---
Oh, is that what I said?
---
Trader
---
Vanilla launch.
---
I had my first son 3 months before vanilla released back in 2004. We are in the hospital now popping the new one out. Can confirm they don't need us dad's much. Is it bad I only took 2 days off for the kid being born and the whole week off for WoW classic?
---
Late November is all I can find.
---
try to find a used one for your budget.
---
I do not think the word means what he thinks it means.
---
Tbh people have tried so many crazy cool mage builds it's kinda hard to come up with something "unique", but of those specs people have come out with well they sure are cool.
---
How does prot AOE work at level 40?
---
Maybe 1 less raiding night a week. Not as strict about meta talent builds but also dont take meme specs, sub optimal consumables maybe.
---
Don't you have to die to have repair bills? I haven't died once yet. /s but no /s
---
In vanilla jack of all trades is the opposite of what you want
---
Also a systems engineer - the amount of people that aren't in IT but think they know how IT engineers work is astounding. People like u/Speedmetal666 talking about "aging hardware" - wut?
---
Like a dozen a week.  Retail = bad, Classic = good, upvotes to the left plz
---
holy fuck that only took a couple of seconds with a google search. i thought you guys had better internet infrastructure than we did. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sIBNxQd6xw priest macros. druid macros https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoKPv_cYCCk warlock macros. all of these have some generic targetting macros as well. pet targetting. you could have watched any of the twitch streams during the beta as well, they talked about them during some of the streams. some made clips as they were going. not asmon or any of those guys, but some of the pvp ones did macros and addons. you can look at the twitch mod app and see what addons are available and do searches of anyone that may have been using those. people also make comments on what is and isnt working.
---
With how common world buff usage has become on private servers. Removing them from raids would open up a significant amount of stats progression before it becomes silly.
---
I'm at least for more 60 content than just redoing the expansions and making the same mistakes again.
---
Also, maybe I'm wrong but...I didn't think gear swapping was even possible while in combat?
---
People who use accents in their wow names are the scum of the earth.
---
*You're misinformation!*
---
Sad :(
---
On launch? With everyone logging it at the same second? Blizz authentication is gonna crash like always. I doubt a 10th were invited to beta
---
Druids are somewhat second class citizens. 
---
As a healer they don't have a normal resurrect, just the combat res with a long cooldown. They also don't usually raid heal as well as priests, can remove poisons and curses but not dispel magic or diseases, are not as efficient as paladins, and don't have spamable aoe healing like shamans. In five mans, even if you brought a druid healer you would probably want a shaman/paladin/priest in the group for any sort of wipe recovery.
---
They're usually below average caster dps as boomkin, though I'm not really an expert on my chicken friends.
---
Feral druids, at least in vanilla, 99% of them were just awful cat dps. That said, there exists "a build" for them that people are probably going to try in classic, for information on that look up a druid named Shedo. The thing about this is that even if it does work, you're working twice as hard as most of the other melee dps.
---
Druid tanks did exist in classic, but they were rare. I was one. I actually started as an 8/11/32 healing druid in the swiftshifting days, and in the 1.8 patch switched to 0/30/21 or 11/35/5 depending on if I was in my pvp focused time or my pve focused one. I had the full getup including smoking heart, guise of the devourer, malfurion's blessed bulwark, etc. Also a player by the name of Skarm has really popularized it of late coming from the private server community. You'll almost always be a second class tank compared to a fully geared warrior, and some people interpret that as being uplayable. Also a full resto (8/11/32) druid who carries a tank set can fill the few niche situations a feral druid is good at (Jin'do) acceptably well and the guild doesn't lose a full-class healer.
---
One side advantages of a guild having a feral druid is that they don't compete with warriors for much gear, and they're really good in pre-raid equipment. At least for the tanking part. On the other hand a cat-focused druid is competing for a lot of  the same items that all the other dps want, other than weapons.
---
This guy fucks
---
wow forums back in the day weren't any better.
---
There was a lot of drama about this when people first discovered it. They actually talked with a vanilla dev who confirmed it was blizzlike, so maybe we'll see it in classic as well. I sure hope not because it's lame as fuck and clearly a "bug"
---
Literally played a hunter to level 15 two weeks ago. You can not kite until you get concussive shot, and even then, you will not kill it before it gets within melee range unless you crit. If you make a vid and show me I will believe you.
---
Giving us that 2004 blizz experience
---
Dude in middle right is like "Sorry dude, I don't know where the alchemist is" :)
---
You cannot dispel sl in 1.12
---
Fury warriors at the hardcore level generally have the highest DPS in raids.
---
Weapons are fine, but yeah for the rest.
---
How would you prevent duping?
---
As you said, a select few BiS, and a lot of decent gear. So you can actualy gear most class in full brd and be a solid fresh lvl 60.
---
Up the top of my head a select other few that are pre-BiS or close : the ogre magi ring and belt from arena, the epic mail chest from arena, naglering, both healing and spell power trinket, agi boots from moira, healing mace from chest, the leather pants for feral off general... i could just go on and on with good loots !!!
---
You can swap weapons, but not gear.
---
It would be cool if they balanced each town like a mini dungeon, or even just single group quest. Maybe places like tarren mill could be like a level 30 place, the town leader drops some loot table of blues, or from the quest. All the way up top with epic gear for city raids.
---
I think I have about three months worth of game time which isn't too bad considering how much work I put in. If I had bothered to go to the new areas it might have been more lucrative. Otherwise I just put on a movie or an audiobook and do 10 runs of vortex pinnacle for volatile air and hypnotic dust. Pretty simple straightforward low IQ farming LOL
---
I mean...they are, though.
---
But yeah, they're still going to make the release date.
---
Also in IT cockface. Don't tag me in your ignorance.
---
So, they were not prepared?
---
You're right. I'm an asshole because I don't think a neurological disorder should be an insult.
---
Most PvE builds will be raid specs, so Frost/Arcane when there is Fire resist, Fire/Arcane when possible.
---
PvP has more flexibility but the 31/11/0 variants are the most popular for the burst hilarity.
---
In vanilla I was a scrub that never got to raid. When I hit 60 I ran [0/25/31](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/-505200102302-20350033132201051) which is a bit different I guess. It felt thematic using both fire and frost spells. Scorch/Fireball for single target, Blizzard/Flamestrike for AoE. Spec gives the defensive CDs and Blizzard slow for utility. Decent all around 60 build for AV, dungeons, farming, open world PvE. Not suited for progression raiding, WSG, AB, small scale open world PvP.

God I would love them to go that route. Unfortunately there has been no indication that they are even considering it at the moment. And the product was advertised as a pure Vanilla server. I think the thing that might hold back that kind of large scale development is the fact that the sub is shared with retail WoW... if it was a separate sub for WoW classic they would basically be obligated to make improvements and release some free additional content, but at the moment they can just say the 15 dollars a month is just going toward retail development and classic is just a perk. We'll see though.
---
Yeh these two games and developers are not comparable in that respect
---
Sharding is vastly easier to scale as layering. Probably some complications on the backend.
---
This plays well with my conspiracy theory that blizzard has more bugs,  discovered from the beta, than they have time to realistically fix before release date. 
---
Once their docket was full, further testing was no longer needed, so they ended the beta well in advance of the original timeline,  which would have included this last stress test. 
---
However, they had already announced the stress test, so they couldn't just cancel it alongside the end of beta. They had to defer it several days so the correlation was less clear. 
---
Indefinitely postponing the stress test just confirms, in my conspiracy, that they have more work to do than they thought, and another stress test can only add more to a pile they cannot complete by August anyways. 
---
Note this conspiracy theory is not that they will miss August, but rather that to meet the August deadline they cannot afford to increase their list of bugs in need of fixing further. Future bugs will be found in live, and patched for fixes.
---
People don't forget.
---
&gt;  Like in the druid podcast, Taladril knew so much more than him in terms of actual abilities and rotational mechanics. 
---
I'm actually on the other side of this argument. Kevin Jordan worked on WOW nearly 20 years ago. He hasn't been on the team in a decade. It seems silly to me to ask him *"When a druid has a 1% miss chance on Innervate, but uses the Gnomregan Pummler, why is it that...?"* 
---
It comes off, to me, like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYrRqMHQY7o . I've worked with some smart, smart, smart developers who could remember every line of code they ever wrote over a decade - but they are few and far apart. Most people do the job and leave the details in the past.
---
I would love for someone, maybe Taladril, to just ask him to brainstorm a new class idea for Classic, like a Hunter tank or Priest Tank. Keep him in his non-technical element and let his creative genius shine.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, by the way. I have John's book too and the journey is fascinating. You'd think all of these decisions weren't done "on the fly," but the game is pretty much improv through and through.
---
Fuck go back further. Diabo 2 and Starcraft were buggy unpolished garbage on launch.
---
Just go 20 into holy and heal, it sucks but it is what it is
---
I'm suggesting that you can get on the stress test, make macros, and copy the folder
---
Amazing!
---
I can do without the screaming, my wife hates that I want my daughter to grow up lol
---
Hits too close to home.
---
Why human? weapon skill cannot be compared isnt it?
---
&gt;I like to play Tanks but are they are one of the hardest and most important roles in ESO, if the tank isn't skilled he will die and everyone else will instantly die (you can play with meh dps but need good tank); is this the same for wow classic?
---
Not really. You don't have many tools in your kit as a tank to increase your damage mitigation in Classic. You have a few abilities with extremely long cooldowns that can save your ass, but they're "oh shit!" buttons. You might pre-plan when you use them with your raid team on specific encounters, but usually they're used when something else went wrong.
---
Most of your role as a tank is to hold threat, or to force the mobs to focus their attacks on you. That's the most challenging part in wow Classic for tanks. Whether you live or die is mostly going to be decided by your healers and your gear. 
---
&gt;I also like bruisers with good CC and Burst.
---
Warriors suit that playstyle, kinda. They don't have much CC. There isn't many "bruiser" type classes in wow that I can think of. Maybe enhancement shamans as well, but their burst is very RNG dependant. Both of these have very little CC, though. 
---
TL;DR: You should probably play a warrior. Depending on your build, you can be a tank or a bruiser with that class.
---
You still have to always communicate those coordinates between players and I don't know if voice receive volume is per player or even accessible with the addon api. All in all it's simply not possible because of grouping being required.  
---
If it was a 3rd party voice chat application, you'd need to violate the terms of service to send data to it in real time. There's no way to communicate to applications outside the game from within the game in real time legally.
---
I'd always AoE powerlevel in Stockades and SM.  Other instances aren't as dense if my memory is correct.
---
I'm surprised you say no big changes to crafting, to me that area needs the most touching out of everything jn vanilla. It's kind of accepted that most profs are kind of useless to a point and everyone gets eng outside of the few raid leads who get rare patterns for resist gear and stuff.
---
Id like to see them have more bop gear, quests, fun effects, and consumables to make profs feel more like a character choice than just obvious min maxing.
---
No.
---
Great thanks!
---
Just a heads up to OP, that laptop does not have a dedicated graphics card. The R3 3200U is an APU. It would still run Classic just fine, though.
---
Maybe its just my daughter (1 month) but pretty much everything she cries about is fixable; Hungry, too cold, too hot, dirty diaper. Its the teeth coming in that im worried about.
---
That's just a lie. They did balance around raids, at least they tried. The devs admitted that.
---
Legs are practically Alliance-only, so Horde can vendor those.
---
I would suggest that you literally don't get to keep anything except your levels/talents/professions and gear that is soulbound to you. The gear wouldn't matter that much since we all know it becomes pretty much obsolete anyway the second you start getting gear at least in BC not as much in Wrath. As for gold, maybe put a cap on how much will be copied or make it so it's a direct transfer of a certain amount and there's no duplicate gold to begin with. There would be some things to work around but I think they could work around it so the implications of duping wouldn't be significant if even present at all.
---
Fuck me I happened to have that day off and was so excited
---
The WoW community has always, always, always been this way outside the game, posting on forums. Always. This behavior typically is not reflected in-game.
---
Good, I was a bit worried for a sec.
---
Honestly being the dad in the hospital made me feel so unimportant lol. They treat you like just some guy whos there to watch.
---
The main thing is crafting should never be appropriate to take place of raid gear. I’m all for adding new recipes and such, but they need to stay at current crafting power levels. Pre-Raid BIS would be fine I suppose too.
---
I absolutely agree there should be a lot of fun new effects and things that alter character choices though
---
I came up with this for a well rounded PvP build. 
---

---
Its a little silly, but I think it could be quite fun in battlegrounds.
---
It's there since the Classic release date announcement  [https://worldofwarcraft.com](https://worldofwarcraft.com/)
---
How populated is the night elf race supposed to be anyways? didn't many of them get killed by colonizing orcs?
---
That would make sense, I will go and check those then. Much appreciated
---
one of the biggest myths about vanilla and  I still don't know who started to spread it
---
You are implying that blizzard approached the game like: hey only 5% of our customers are raiding. Let's ignore that and continue to focus on it from here on until the end of time.
---
You know what? Let's talk in our interviews about how many people raided and how many times they killed stuff and got killed. Let's make jokes about kicking bad players out of our raids because they suck.
---
Yes obviously that sounds like a company that only has 5 % of its users raiding lol
---
Aside from the silithus rework,'oh noes elemental invasions' and some of the first seasonal events there was literally no other PvE update in vanilla. Nor was there much of a reason to interact with the world if you weren't raiding. You would eventually cap on your blue gear and the handful of crafted BoEs and that's it without raids
---
I was a systems engineer before you were born son. Clearly you have a hard time reading, and because of that I assume you're shit t your help desk job. 
---
\&gt; FYI, Cloud is **more expensive** than buying hardware. I'd be shocked if Blizzard doesn't extensively utilize cloud technology, but I'd be more shocked if Blizzard doesn't have hardware from 20 years ago still running for internals.
---
If you could could comprehend what you would understand that I have already said that. But keep repeating the obvious. 
---
 Cockface!!
---
Mine is the hunter
---
I have tried and had little luck in a concise list.
---
I played there, was a rogue Kyliemanogue.
---
Please reveal what server your guilds are rolling on. I wouldn't mind playing with you folks.
---
Thats the kind of spirit i want to hear! :)
---
They don’t want people using their 3 free days on stress test
---
Look, it's okay to not know how this works but here's a simple analogy you don't need any field knowledge to understand.  
---
I'm making a dish following a recipe, you love it. I stop making it, you want it back. After 15 years I make the same dish following the same recipe but you feel like it's off. It does NOT matter if you feel it's off because I followed the exact same recipe.  
---
Cmon bro, have some respect, roll Orc or even Human if you have to.
---
Fuck gnomes.
---
Promise made, promise broken. The blizzard defence squadron is even more pathetic
---
All content Cataclysm onwards was designed to displace the need of a group
---
A lot of it is reposts, topics that have been rehashed 8 million times and could easily have been searched for, questions that you'd get your answer to faster by simply googling, or proposing changes that belong in r/classicwowplus.
---
Downvoting isn't "toxic".
---
Which classes have full raiding specs which are also decent for PVP?
---
They missed their original Warcraft 3 release date from 2001, releasing it in 2002. The book "The WoW Diary" talks about the effect missing this deadline had on the development of future products, including WoW.
---
Masturbation. Heavy breathing. Don't give a fuck if a eat my own semen!
---
At one point they will
---
Yeah no one is surprised to hear that you're old, dude. Your "knowledge" belies your age.
---
I don't think anyone has actually made a list of that so you have to put in a bit of work yourself i'm afraid.
---
a) Find a profession guide for vanilla
---
b) find out what level you need to craft all the gnomish stuff you want(vanilla wowhead or https://classicdb.ch is a great resource here) 
---
c) Take all the mats the guide says you need to get to that level and add the mats needed for the items.
---
Done.
---
We're using a website for general information and applications through google forms, roster info, loot rules, raid progress, etc. All that stuff can be done through Discord I guess, but I felt like building a website. :) 
---
Will probably use CEPGP addon to track loot. Still looking for a smooth solution to in-game events and attendance + invites (hoping for an addon there as well). I'd prefer to have most stuff as addons to make it easier for our officers to handle each task. Let me know if you have any leads on addons like that!
---
Tell me about it... My daughter was born on the 1st of April. Not kidding
---
If you enjoy a lot of different games, "Core" is a great one. It was originally a podcast about Heroes of the Storm, but transitioned into a show about gaming in general, news related to, and what games they're playing and looking forward to. The organic interactions between the hosts are the real selling point. Very natural conversion and easy to listen to.
---
Not to mention what a stretch it would be to assume everybody in this sub is automatically toxic.
---
That analogy isn't accurate to the situation, i'm not just basing this off of feelings, but videos of how the game played at the time in question.
---
Cant disagree, because BGs have objectives, not simply kill opposition
---
Yeah, downside of being older now. Can't dedicate huge swaths of time to raiding.
---
Gonna roll a warlock and now I need to decide what professions I want. I'm currently thinking of doing Herbalism + Tailoring. I can level Tailoring as I level my toon and make bags for myself and to AH and get my epic robe. Drop that for Alchemy and use my saved herbs from 1-60 to level it. I've also considered skinning since vendoring stacks is decent income but I won't need money for my lvl 40 mount which is why I may not choose it.
---
I'm pretty sure one button decursive and healbot were broken by 1.12. The addons still existed but they were just aides, they didn't play the game for you. Totem stomp macro was in for the entirety of vanilla right? So seems entirely in line with the standard Classic ethos - 1.12 mechanics with gated content.
---
Well not for the first kill, but because they don't get locked, they just keep doing kills until they have like 20 people not locked left and do a final clear with the left. So yes everyone gets to roll on loot,
---
Thats the norm, PuG leaders make these runs to grab the cash
---
perfect time to do all nighters two for husbands. take the responsibility to let your wifey sleep the night while you handle baby in between pulls, playing a tank/healer may be counter indicated though as its not a role you can just stop
---
&gt; And if you are a douchebag and a min/maxer, you'll kick the warlock after summoning and pick the mage anyways, because the wl has done its job.
---
&gt; Stupid, but some people will ruin everything for a minimal gain.
---
&gt; edit: clarification
---
in which case kicking someone is a mercy.
---
I'm not even a native English speaker and I've learnt way back in 4th grade how to properly use apostrophes. I'm not kidding, this was taught to me in second semester of 4th grade elementary school when I was 10. But that was 25 years ago, when school was serious!
---
I think you're missing the point here. What he's saying is druids, pallys, shamans, are all subpar classes, they're not good and will never be viable at end game content, but that's ok because it's all about playing the game the way you want to, even if you will be permanently gimped.
---
What is the opportunity cost for a judgement debuff slot? Or is this a given for Alliance raiding?
---
Classic just like Vanilla needs to be imperfect and incomplete, and most of the time people just want to discuss how to make Classic perfect, that's what makes it so pointless.
---
People are looking for the answer to the question no one asked.
---
Stone form OP
---
Yes and people have given plenty videos to prove a lot of the "not a bug" things that Blizzard listed are wrong, and ultimate they aknowledge that they are wrong and the topic dies, and so will leeway, because it works exactly as it did in 1.12, whether you feel like it or not, whether videos from ambiguous patches show it behaving differently or not.
---
Yeah the people on here are ridiculous. There’s over 151,000 people on here and I wouldn’t be surprised if it had the least upvotes per capita of any sub on Reddit.
---
Sure. But then you're in a guild that does nothing but clear MC and wipe in BWL and that's not fun.
---
Opening the servers for name reservation prior to release.
---
Yeah I guess I should've put a point in SA, you're right. I really like E4E because it helps you in pvp against spellcasters.
---
That’s what I used Amazon Prime day for. Got a similar monitor but LG
---
Mages are glass cannons, but that will teach you smart gameplay by the time you hit 60. Warlocks are more tanky, but they don't have any real escape tools. Hunters are the most resilient and you could level one without watching the screen. I think that this is a big reason that hunters are stereotyped as bad players more often than other classes. They don't have to overcome a lot of challenges while levelling.
---
&gt; Prot can tank but not as well as other tanks.
---
Prots are great in 5-mans because they hold AOE threat rather easily, problem is outside of trash, they lack a real taunt, and decent single target TPS (need to be hit to generate threat).
---
With that said, it's not a big problem, they can still make it work.
---
A lot of Ret is auto attacking and waiting.
---
Paladin IS strong with healing, arguably strongest potential healing class, super mana efficient, very effective buffs.
---
&gt; This sub is full of elitist tough talk nonsense.
---
I wonder how many of those people are worth a quarter of a shit at the game?
---
I'm actually going to take a step back and guess that the EU servers aren't ready for testing yet, especially after the recent language-server change.
---
Purging Mage shields, Priest Shields, Warlocks Shields, and Blessing of protection will literally never get old.
---
Funny how all caster classes and paladins (of course) all have shields.
---
Shamans were intended to be able to tank everything up to \~level 50 dungeons according to Kevin Jordan.
---
if you are geared enough, you can tank all 5 man content in the game as a shaman.  They actually have some of the best initial threat and you need some decent DPS to back up the fight since they dont have the best sustained threat and no taunt.  It's very fun if you are skilled and geared.
---
Because what?
---
Yeah, it’s a great class no doubt. It’s just the leveling part which imo is painfully dull.
---
Did not top pve fury warriors fight in leather because it ment more deeps?
---
I used my dog's old puppy rubber bone on my cousin and it worked great. It is made for chewing after all.
---
Vanilla was more about making friends.  I see a lot of skilled people being too volatile for guilds to stay together for very long.
---
Ok, that's it... we need time travel.
---
Anyone know a way that doesn't involve huge bodies of mass ?
---
Rock biter is consistency, and provides the most reliable damage with 2h when leveling.
---
ok? So you should pick a class that's easy to level because you might quit the game before you even hit 60?
---
What kind of logic is that? When you start a new game, you just assume you won't finish it?
---
You make a pittance before ~35lvl when you get thick leather. At which point you can vendor a stack for like 60s. Farming npc's that drop lots of greys is much better imo. Greys will most often sell for more than that stack of light leather(etc) anyway.
---
So much potential for post naxx content. It doesn't have to be entirely new tiers of content initially either. There's many gear gaps that brand new 5-10 man dungeons could fill such as Resistance Gear + Main Stat &amp; Stam eg, (+20 Nature Resist, +18 Stam, + 20 Agility or Strength). Future content could be as simple as a new zone with Harder dungeon()s that might require arcane resistance gear since we never used arcane resistance seriously at all in Vanilla. Potentially filling the drops in these new content instances with gear that we don't see much of yet won't power spike us significantly like reflect damage armor or even reflect damage on-use trinkets "Increase the amount of reflect damage you do by 50% for 15 seconds."  Stuff like that. I can come up with this off the top of my head so there's a lot of potential when it comes to non power spiking gear &amp; challenging content for it to belong. It's REALLY important that "challenging" doesn't deviate from vanilla core pillars &amp; philosophies
---
Mage portals would save some money.
---
Thats the point, you limit the people who can roll on loot. 4 pieces of loot for 5 people vs 4 pieces of loot for 20 people. RNG will still play a role but you have a higher chance of getting the item you want doing it this way
---
WOW i really wish i did not click on that
---
Warrior is the weakest dueling class in the game.
---
There's no source on any cooldown for ZG or Nef, and the only source for ony is 6 hours.
---
But "secret ret" can be pretty decent in pvp, yeah you miss out on 3% hit and imp HoJ etc. but you hit like a hammer and are a great support. Your role is basically to find an Arms warrior and support him to make kills happen, it works wonders with your toolkit. I'm not sure how much superior your Holy build would be without Vengeance, 15% increased dmg/holy is big for both pvp and pve.
---
But but.. it was my birthday present to myself :( I was gonna sit and do stress test all day. Dammit &gt;:(
---
Not a vanilla druid player, but here are thoughts for you.
---
Definitely right about the negatives in regards to PVE (raid, dungeons) 
---
more often than not, you’ll be a raid healer.
---
Not common to be a tank in raids, but it’s more common in 5man dungeons
---
Not worth it to be a feral spec, because you’ll get berated by trolls. It’s kinda like DPS Ret Paladin (nightfall bot) and Boomkin (innervate bot) 
---
If you wanna be successful at it you need to be a NEET (sarcasm) to pull it off because these niche specs need all the consumables, gold, and certain items to be dps viable. 
---
Which in essence, requires you to have a very free schedule, and be financially stable in order to balance farming extra just to compete with other dps. Whereas other classes might not need to farm as much as a niche build player might. 
---
But you’ll always hear the bright sides of World PVP as a druid. That’s about all I can think of.
---
Hi there. Yes, that's correct. I'm looking to hook up the laptop to an ultrawide while I'm at home. And yes, the laptop I'm looking at has both an HDMI and a (mini) DisplayPort. 
---
I got to see a high refresh rate monitor for the first time the other week. You really CAN tell the difference. It was AMAZING! If I had the money, I'd pick up that 34" 120Hz Alienware ultrawide. Alas, I do not. :P
---
Shaman tanking is a meme, even in 5-mans. It's very difficult to pull off without a ton of investment.
---
Both are primarily healers, trying to dps as a druid or shaman gets you laughed at pretty hard.
---
Shaman leveling isn't the most fun, but druid leveling is a blast.
---
I would also imagine this will be easier with friends and not randos for better communication.
---
Trying to decide between Priest and Shaman. I’ll need to be pretty casual, so for the most part would prefer to keep the same spec for both PvP and the occasional 5 man / MC PUG. 
---
To switch things around from every other posts, I’d like your input on their NEGATIVES. I.e:
---
1) Is Shadow Priest as mana hungry as people make it out to be?
---
2) Do you reckon I could heal 60 dungeons as Shadow / is PvPing as Holy fun in Classic? 
---
3) Is 31/0/20 for Shammies a thing straight away, or do I almost have to be in T2 to pull it out?
---
4) Which one is less boring to level, considering they both involve a fair bit of auto attacking / wanding?
---
In PvP scenarios - group PvP where they can get dispels, heals, and are able to cleave multiple targets. That’s when warriors are the stuff of nightmares.
---
They are definitely fragile but have so many slows and escape options that mitigate that.  And for much of the same reasons, you can survive pulling multiple mobs with (poly, blink, nova, frost bolt slows, etc...)
---
Played druid in vanilla, one of the best classes to level.  You get to conserve mana for heals because you will be dealing damage with rage or energy.  The class quests are fun, and aquatic form and travel form are great for leveling and even at 60.  If you want to tank/heal/dps you can go for a 0/30/21 build.  In a raid you will usually be healer spec, but can also spec feral and off tank.  In pvp druids are great at being the flag carrier in WSG.
---
I've considered this, you're right that Ret becomes much more viable once 2.5 is available and it's hard to get your hands on good 2h when all the warriors gotta eat first.
---
missing the point bud but yessssss
---
Oh probably, they did all sorts of changes over the years.
---
I mean that was literally the majority of the playerbase. Most people were just happy to play the game and get the occasional item upgrade. A lot of people then (and today) won't have time for a serious raiding schedule and are fine with that. 
---
Not everyone lives to raid. If someone wants to get serious about raiding because they want major upgrades, then they'll get serious about their gear and specs.
---
i don't think you ever wana be leveling in berserker though?
---
I sang my newborn songs of wow, league of legends, and tenacious D and snoop dog. He loves them now at age 1 1/2. Ill soon need to replace some choice words in thise songs tho.
---
&gt; They actually talked with a vanilla dev who confirmed it was blizzlike 
---
Sure they did.....  You guys believe that shit?
---
Warlock is definitely more casual than priest. Priests need multiple sets of gear depending on the role they fill, and if you plan to raid at all, your absence will be felt more by the raid group.
---
Portals last for 1 minute and you cannot make portals while in combat so I'm afraid that isn't possible.
---
*sigh*
---
Be the change you want to see...
---
Play a paladin, or priest.
---
Side note, are you guys able to play? I was able to download Classic Wow but when I go on it says '' no servers available ''
---
I understand that the full release is out August 27th, but aren't there test servers we can play?
---
Let’s wait til he’s older guys...
---
Would be pretty awesome. I dont think anyone can predict what numbers will be ~6 months from now. Hopefully high!
---
A twitter conversation was linked about it. Gimme a bit and I'll try dig it up
---
8.2 showed me they've learned nothing from the past year. It's the fault of whatever jokers they've got working on retail nowadays, but mostly it's the fault of the player's they're pandering to.
---
Truth does deserve an upvote, so have one ;)
---
As many have already stated $400 for a laptop MIGHT get you to a playable framerate. But I doubt it.
---
If $400 is truly your absolute max budget. I would build a small PC instead, you will still not be maxing graphics, but you'll get a much better experience overall.
---
I would need to spend more time finding the exact parts I would personally buy, but I whipped this PC up in about 5 minutes on PC part picker: https://pcpartpicker.com/list/sZfNRJ
---
AMD - Ryzen 5 2400G. Which is an APU, so it's also the graphics card(about the same power as a 750 Ti, which plays even current wow just fine)
---
Asus B450 Micro ATX motherboard
---
8GB DDR4 3200 RAM
---
1TB HDD
---
240 GB SSD
---
500W EVGA PSU
---
Decent Thermaltake case
---
Total: $353 after rebates.
---
If given more time I would look for a better and larger SSD, maybe 500GB if possible. A slightly better storage HDD. I would do more research to see if there is a well known kit for the motherboard and CPU. Or upgrade to the AMD 3400G, it's the smae GPU inside the VEGA 11, but it's a newer Zen 3rd gen CPU, this would allow the system to last a bit longer, and when more money becomes available the 3400G would pair with a dedicated GPU better than the slightly older and slower 2400G
---
We'll have to see, if the 5 points in Holy crit are needed to help your guild progress then yeah you'll have to take them. But I'm skeptical and I doubt they are, even on progression fights. We'll just have to see, because there's plenty of private servers paladins who have healed with just 20 points through BWL.
---
Same here. I'm already mentally preparing for it.
---
Only the ones not cut out to play shamans in the first place.
---
Think of the water totem quest as a "great filter".  If you can't handle going to ashenvale, hillsbrad, and souther barrens (areas you should already be going in anyway around mid-20's) with the best class mobility for that level range, then you got bigger problems.
---
I wasn't going to click on it. Then I read your comment and I just had to. 😢
---
Apparently, they wreck wars?!
---
Was watching a warrior duels vid from exectus gaming on yt...he was pretty much steamrolling anything that wasn’t a mage and breaking even on shams, but he got to this melee hunter and before the due, even started he said something like “these guys always wreck” “or can’t beat them” or similar. He then proceeded to have his rump handed to him as he predicted. 
---
I’ll see if I can find it,
---
I really doubt that, classic won't be private server levels of crowded and dungeon xp is pretty bad
---
I'm fairly certain I read somewhere that Blizzard was heavily considering doing post-Naxx, sidegrade content.
---
Make like a rogue and go out for a pack of cigarettes. Come back after clearing naxx. The baby will be like 3 tops.
---
beta is over i think
---
My kind of guild.
---
Time is money. 
---
For a hunter, the conversion rate is 1.3 silver per second.
---
Okay thanks!
---
I would've just held that group hostage until they came for the Warlock. Show what takes them longer. Just dropping the group screwed up the Warlock and hurt ur rep.
---
At the same time in Wrath Rogues could also sprint through volley &amp; flare to sap :p 
---
And yeah, if you get a read on the rogue and can predict a vanish(or combat drop for stealth) or you get a read on his pathing you could drop bliz but it wasn't something you relied on for the match up.  I agree that doing so was/is a huge advantage for you.
---
I didn't play mage in wrath so I can't comment on mage then.  That and most of my mage PvP was in Vanilla(and AoE farming kinda died at the start of TBC with the AoE damage cap).
---
Exactly it imo. Anything to try milk a few more subs.
---
Ah well, guess I'll be setting up my UI on release instead.
---
Well the racial you want for pvp in Orc is already built in (hardiness) so you don’t have an opportunity to misplay it, while Tauren’s warstomp is a bit more dynamic and reactionary. It’s up to you imo, pve isn’t going to be much different but would you rather resist stuns or give a stun and eek out a heal or whatever.
---
It will be interesting to watch ATVI stock, when 6+ millions people come back for Classic.
---
\*Creates a toxic post bashing the 'toxic' subreddit for what must end up being a toxic game\*
---
Sorry for the rough time you're having but this post topic has been rehashed to death around here, and never with concrete examples. +/- Karma isn't what the subreddit is about and doesn't deserve its own post.
---
The numbers between the two will never be divulged.  Our World of Warcraft IP has x amount of MAUs and y concurrent growth after the release of these products.  
---
They will never say, Classic is double BFA numbers, we fucked up guys.
---
If you are getting a 60hz monitor then that laptop *should* be able to run it well.
---
For deals I highly recommend /r/buildapcsales/ 
---
(sort by new is the best bet, good ones usually get snatched up quickly)
---
I like how you're speaking for every single healer.  No hubris at all, here.
---
Best experience you can have is firing a critical Chain Lightning straight into a crowd in AV and getting 3 kills then and there.
---
Oooh I can't wait for the inevitable hillsbrad wars to crop up when I hit level 32.
---
I stopped reading after you brought up the stupid wing clip hunter arguement.
---
The more shamans the better.
---
Orc warrior might not be the end-all-be-all for min-maxing. Skarmtank was talking about this with Kargoz on a recent stream. He's actually going with Tauren for the larger hitbox and 5% more health.
---
More hordes = more targets.
---
After playing some private servers and a bit of beta it's definitely between hunter and shaman. I feel like I can't go wrong with either because I have really enjoyed both of them, so it's not a bad decision to have. I just think I could do with a bit of a push from someone more knowledgeable in the right direction for which of the two is better for someone on the more casual side.
---
For hunters I love the kiting aspect and being able to just go out in the world and look for pets and kite elites into towns and stuff. I enjoy the control they have in PvP and the fact they will apparently be on the easier side of things to gear up. Levelling quickly is a bonus, farming efficiently sounds great and soloing things like Maraudon for gold seems nifty. With the hunter I am just concerned about the limited raid spots and if I am going to be shit geared if I can't play a ton it might be hard for me to get into groups. In PvP it seems like a good player can utterly abuse the dead zone and it's frustrating sometimes.
---
With the shaman I love the theme and the nostalgia I'll have for it given it's what I levelled originally. Being able to heal while levelling sounds like it'll get me into groups easily. They seem amazing in PvP as elemental and really fun, though a fair bit easier/simple than hunter. What worries me about shaman is that there will be a mass of them in a raid group and I'm worried that it'll take me an age to ever get some good gear, how do they compare to most classes in ability to gear up considering my aim is to just get what I can from PvE so that I go ele in PvP, I know I'll be healing don't worry.
---
Any input would be appreciated, I'm very indecisive lol. Any stuff I should be considering between the two that might swing me one way to actually make a decision?
---
Definitely is up there for me.  Absolutely loved the dialogue between characters.
---
it became 16 in like wrath i think
---
The "if it bothers you don't play it" argument is a silly one from both sides of the fence. It is particularly ironic given that the nature of the OP. These threads inevitably turn into a circle jerk about classic so thise of us who may have a more centered, non-hype view- get downvoted into oblivion.
---
The reason why the general difficulty of the content could matter a great deal is because what makes Vanilla WoW so great is that constant feeling of progression In many ways as you level. This encourages you to interact with those around you to accomplish goals that would otherwise be impossible alone. That progression leads to various levels of social interaction through its interaction with the system itself. The small goals you set for your character are meaningful while you level up to level 60 and remain meaningful passed that point as well when looked at in a vacuum.
---
Once you hit 60 the focus shifts more towards the end game. If the end game is too easy it invalidates a lot of what was before it. Folks will generally take the path of least resistance when it comes to MMOs and if the end game is too easy a large chunk of the player base will simply skip or stop interacting with many of the systems that are described in the initial post... because they will realize they won't need to in order to reach their larger character goals and objectives. This is what happens in retail WoW on the daily.
---
I'm not saying this will happen for sure, but it should be a valid concern on everyone's radar. The same concept happens on retail WoW already but is caused by a multitude of factors. People generally don't interact with the game's social systems beyond organized raiding groups because they don't need to. If enough people feel this way the game could fail. I am hoping that doesn't happen because Vanilla and BC were my favourite times in the game and I too am missing that magic.
---
I often feel reading through this sub that we could use some more realistic discussion as well as perspective on Classic instead of constantly dismissing criticism or view points that may differ slightly from the "classic best game ever made" mold.
---
Idk, if I play a game it's to beat it, usually. 3h/day is more than enough to clear all the way up to naxx btw, you don't need to be a NEET, either.
---
Let me just make sure I understand that you think warriors are NOT the worst 1v1 dueling class?
---
Hey, whatever works! (and is not harmful)
---
If i tell you the truth i've never played in a PVE server, just because i think PVP is natural and realistic between ennemy factions.
---
I suposse that you can raid cities to kill the bosses, and i think you can kill an enemy faction player, but only if that player has activated PVP for himself. I don't really know. Mybe some PVE players could confimr this point please?
---
Like... every single one?
---
u/SoupaSoka has a comprehensive post on the subject:
---
[I spent &gt;$600 buying old PC parts to benchmark the Classic beta and approximate minimum system specs. Results and recommendations inside!](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c23tlc/i_spent_600_buying_old_pc_parts_to_benchmark_the/)
---
tldr;  *if you’re willing to play at 1080P low settings, you’re very likely to have a great gaming experience in Classic as long as your desktop PC was built in the last 10 years and has a dedicated graphics card*
---
tldr for laptops; *Even my laptop from 2015 without a dedicated graphics card maintained above 60FPS average at 1080P low settings, and averaged 80 FPS at 720P low settings*
---
Beta was invite only, and it's closed anyway. Stress test for july has been postponed indefinitely/canceled.
---
Pally vs priest: what sort of gameplay do you like? Ranged squishy, or tankier melee with single target?
---
There's a stress test coming "soon" (potentially not at all, capped at 15). To be announced eventually.
---
If you want to play a private server and see what the class feels like at 60, there are a few instant 60 servers. (Feel free to pm me and I can send you the names)
---
Classic is going to boost ATVI price by 15 points, at least.
---
Buy now.
---
Could reach as high as 70 before end year, because, one thing nobody expects, is Blizzard announcing sub numbers again, and those numbers will be amazing for the stock owners.
---
FROSTSHOCK!
---
Your hyperbole undermines your post severely. Whatever you specifically mean by meme spec, they can obviously bring things like rebirth, consuming gear no one competes on, flexibility with roles, etc. Nevertheless I never said anything about classic in my post.
---
All of that, by the way, is only talking about raiding. My post also relates to pvp and leveling, which I will be personally more invested in, and which you conveniently ignore.
---
38, get some caster gear and stack nature SP.
---
Spam lightning bolt until the taurens come home.  Its almost night and day how fast you can kill mobs as elemental right around 40 compared to enhance.
---
I think we get to claim names mid august.  Priests are fine to level, you get to choose several different specs.  For horde, Undead is popular for shadowpriests, but so is Troll.  Tailor/Enchanting are common professions for a priest.
---
Undisputedly? I'll dispute.
---
Mages have higher, more consistent raid damage.
---
Mages are generally better in team fights (granted, they are disadvantaged in a 1v1 vs. a warlock).
---
Mage CC is useful in more situations than warlock CC.
---
Mages goof on the classes that give warlocks real problems.
---
*Disclaimer: I'm totally playing warlock in classic.*
---
A sub gets you both retail access and classic access. They get their 🦀$15 btw🦀 no matter what you play. Same as osrs. 
---
The difference being you won’t know how many ppl are playing retail or classic.
---
You're still confusing interests though. The average player didn't want to raid back in 2005 and won't want to raid today. It's why LFR is so wildly popular among the casual playerbase. 
---
&gt; 3h/day is more than enough to clear all the way up to naxx btw
---
That's a lot of time for some people, and it's not a lot for others. I remember my days of living, eating, breathing, and shitting WoW or Dota. On my days off I'd wake up and play nonstop only taking care of house chores when I needed to. I'd play from the moment I got home from work until I went to bed.
---
Now? I get up at 6:30 AM, drive 30 minutes to hit the gym for 60-90 minutes before work (instead of after work), work from 9-6, drive home for 45 minutes in traffic and make dinner with my girlfriend and spend some time with her before she goes to bed. Some days we'll go upstairs and play games for a few hours, other times we just make dinner, pour some wine, and sit on the patio with a fire going (or jump in the hot tub).
---
I'm going to take time off to play WoW when it's released again, but there's little chance that I'll be coming home and absorbing myself into it again like I used to. Until Borderlands 3 is released and she spends most of her time on that.
---
Plant it... **PLANT IT!**
---
On a roll too, whoops
---
Yes Survival hunter can ravage Warriors even in melle 1 on 1, and rogues get absoloutley stomped too...people under estimate how much damage a Survival hunter can do in melle especially with BM talents to supplement. Check out Corrosity's channel on youtube you can see him tearing up elite warriors like Monkeynews using nothing but melle LOL https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O4FA16PU44
---
Once you go gnome, there's no goin' home.
---
smart
---
I mean, bfa wasn't buggy, it's fucking awful, but not buggy
---
That's a good point. One thing is for certain Blizzard shouldn't listen to much of the drivel players claim they want. I think that's what Turned WoW worse over time.
---
Wherever you want to draw it.
---
Debuff limits (or lack thereof) change raid and class balance in pve. I could entertain arguments to change it, because it would help some classes that need it, but you open a can of worms. Easier to leave it as is.
---
Leeway and batching were janky technical crutches that make the actual gameplay feel bad. When you a press a button and the thing doesn’t happen, you feel bad. When someone runs directly over a hunter trap, everyone feels bad. It’s just unnecessary and the only argument for it is nostalgia. Which is a totally fine argument! It’s just weird to see people try to defend it on other grounds or pretend that the originals devs, if they had access to current tech, wouldn’t jump at the chance to fix leeway/batching.
---
Lol its 40 man in vanilla, oops. Been a while fam :)
---
Warlock... free mount XD
---
What good loot system would you recommend. I only ask because these type of discussions are bringing back tons of memories of all the drama and it actually getting me even more excited for classic. So I love to reminisce over all the hilarity of back then. 
---
But like we had DKP and it still resulted in shit like all the paladins passing on their entire set for 2 months trying to hoard for lokamir I’ll romathis. And then we’d have shit like loot council where some warrior would Gquit with a small armories worth of loot because he wanted jinrokh first and deserved it but believes the gmaster conspired with the officers to give it to their favorite. And who could forget the awe and wonder of the main tank leaving to join the equally progresses guild because their gmaster said he would have first dibs on hand of rag.
---
Retail is Diablo. You get loot to get better loot from the same enemies with no progression. Once in a while your loot becomes shit so you can get loot again without devs actually adding new content. 
---
They been transforming the game since WoD to have more hack-n-slash gameplay for all classes and to introduce Diablo systems. Now it's on. The only thing left from Warcraft is lore, and even then, old characters are gone long time.
---
Imo the whole concept of playing the auction house and all that is lame and should be avoided as much as possible. 
---
But you can do remote control of your PC with a smartphone to log in and do auction house stuff. Just google a bit and you'll find out how to set it up.
---
It is finished LMAO, since like forever. WAY before beta anyway.
---
Bugs are NOT an issue.
---
What is...is LAYERING, because it's a NEW feature, that wasn't properly tested for LAUNCH conditions...you know, when MILLIONS will flock the servers.
---
A stress test is NOTHING for layering purposes. They wanted this stress test to be massive, across all regions, and open to EVERYONE.
---
Something is not working AS INTENDED, and this is layering. Nothing else justifies a delay.
---
My money are hard on the layering cooldown not working properly, because, let's face it : it's one thing in beta, when maybe couple guys are changing layers every 5-10 minutes....but it's another thing when DOZENS will do every second, during first days of Classic launch.
---
I wouldn't mind the companion app with guild chat, auction house, bank access, things like that would be cool and I don't think it would take away from vanilla experience.
---
Back to panda private servers with you !
---
BUTTT man dps is a dime a dozen. I know free mount thats sweet
---
sell me on warlock and how I won't be just competing with all the other dps? and yeah man warlocks were goddamn OP and facerolled me I hated them and I bet my first alt is lock and Orc Lock Orclock no way thatlll be taken!
---
This is giving me doubt and anxiety lol
---
Well tbh most guilds split up and 20man runs anyway :)
---
There is only two options of buying things in war craft now.  An active subscription and the current expansion down payment.  There is no more previous expansions, only whatever is on live that you need to buy to play.  An active sub will get you access to all prior content in wow, and wow classic come aug 27.
---
Can you convince me to go skinning + tailoring instead? What’s wrong with enchanting + tailoring? Rolling lock will be proper casual no raiding likely.
---
I have a son on the way, due 9/3. His sleep schedule is going to determine my leveling schedule lol
---
For all its problems, this isn't one. The gear that you collected prior to the raid releasing was meant to catch you up so that you were prepared for the new raid, not make it so that you don't need anything for the new raid.
---
I can't imagine pally tanking being much fun without either cons or imp righteous fury, and I can't see levelling a pally being much fun without SoC/Conviction. So yeah I don't know what people normally do (beside you know, not tanking as a pally in vanilla).
---
You have to use something called "triangle trapping".
---
1. Initiate threat with a CoA or Corruption. 
---
2. Send the imp to attack while you run to the side.
---
3. Ideally, the imp will pull aggro as the mob gets close to you, forcing it to run over to the imp.
---
4. Wand to pull threat off the imp before it takes much damage.
---
Doing this, you can bounce the mobs around and take very little damage to you or your imp, while spending very little mana.
---
Are you horde or alliance?
---
&gt; You have nothing.
---
Except everything I said being correct and everything you said being wrong. Yup.
---
&gt; Quite frankly I feel the same about you.
---
Well that's a shame. I really wanted to be friends with a South African IT helpdesk tech.
---
There's a 27% hit penalty to dual wielding. Like 70-80% of your damage comes from white hits, if you're missing 27% of the time with each weapon instead of 8% with one 2h you're going to lose a bunch of DPS.
---
*Maybe* if most of your damage came from abilities it could work to force overpower procs in this way but it's not. Just a huge DPS loss overall.
---
Priest is the much better choice
---
Ally
---
Show me the patch note saying that scatter and trap should share DR, you seem to know exactly how long it was in the game etc.
---
I don't know, surely that's how it worked though, right?  
---
I don't mean to be hostile, but this sort of cheating pisses me off.   And if by some off chance it works, you know the pirated server scumbags will defend it and say NOchanges.
---
I think you sold yourself. But if you want something other than a dps roll go pally they have a free mount too and you can heal or tank
---
but it was... finding a zg or mc group was impossible when aq20 hit live.
---
Then you won't be disappointed to know there is no Zeppelin to Thubderbluff.
---
Man I think wow is a poor esport even when they tried to balance pvp. I really don't want to see them try touch vanilla in that way, half the fun of pvp is the lax unbalanced feel of it, don't shoehorn esports.
---
That wasn't even a joke
---
Both Consecration and improved righteous fury is pretty important unless you want the dps and healer to tank
---
I would personally go tailoring while leveling because at 250 you can start making mooncloth which has a 4-day CD. It takes 12 mooncloth to make ONE 18-slot bag. And if you're not interested in actually making anything with them you can sell mooncloth for about 30g (each) on the AH.
---
As for why you want tailoring as a mage: keep in mind that the bloodvine-set doesn't come out until in phase 4. In phase 1 you'll want to make the [Robe of the Archmage](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14152) which is better than the alternative [Robe of Volatile Power](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19145) that drops in MC. T1 for mages is mostly garbage in PvE. 
---
Engineering is actually rather "cheap" and something I recommend doing at 60 just through buying mats from the AH.
---
You won't have much use for Eng while you're lvling. Not as a mage anyways.
---
Ppl tend to be toxic UNTIL they need something, and in Classic they will need something and have to ask for help to get it.  
---
When you can solo everything up until max lvl due to heirlooms and what not you dont give a fuk about other ppl.  
---
Back in vanilla it was the gold sellers, the farm bots, the ninjas and the griefers that was hated and not the regular Joe on his journey to lvl 60. Sure there was a fair share of assholes but much less than now.  
---
The forums was toxic back then too, if you tried to ask something on elitistjerks without having your spelling on point or not searched for it a million times they ripped you a new a-hole in seconds.  
---
The trolls are everywhere just learn not feed them and you'll be fine even in classic.
---
All good, just like most of us hitting late 20's and 30+. Druid will allow you to see a lot of the game in less time due to the versatility.
---
Wow really? That sucks. I mean doesn’t effect me but in retail that was really handy when I played some horde toons
---
Same here.  I'm set to become lead of a high profile program after two guys retire in a year.  I just want to shit post on reddit half the day, come in when I want, and still blow past peers with minimal effort.  
---
On the flip side, I do want to start making 6 figures before I get married.
---
&gt; The average player didn't want to raid back in 2005 and won't want to raid today. It's why LFR is so wildly popular among the casual playerbase.
---
I think that's a misconception. A LOT of people raided back then. With all the info out there nowadays instead of being hardstuck doing MC/Ony/ZG, the casuals will be able to progress into AQ and even naxx if they're willing.
---
3h/day is about the average btw. Nothing particularly crazy when people in the US still spend more than that watching TV. Again, on average.
---
On paper it sounds good. A lot of low levels and the lack of gear = good place of business. But, are YOU actually willing to buy, spend gold to buy, say level 15 gear? What im trying to do is save gold and level up so I don’t need to spend money for gear early. The gold is better spent on skills amongst other amenities like supplies, at least for lower levels, and let the quests and dungeons naturally gear me up with trusted guildies who won’t ninja loot. This is my projection for early-mid game.
---
The stigma they're still facing in the community is nigh unbearable.
---
Yep, Tuesdays and Thursdays you had to have mana tide for progress nights.  Weekend raids you could be pvp spec, because it was usually a speed clear and kind of practice on whatever bosses were not downed during the week.  Additionally, many people ran pre made BGs on weekends, so you may be in pvp spec up until reset day.
---
Yeah if I have to chose I am going with SoC &gt; consecration, I was just wondering if it was remotely possible so I could get dungeon groups faster plus pally tanking looks fun :)
---
They can change. My first son was average. He's 6 now, and he doesn't listen for shit, and does usual annoying 6 year old stuff, but it's not so bad. My second was the best baby I've ever seen. Never cried, extremely calm, awesome. As soon as he hit one, he started to get to be much. He learned to walk, and he'd go around the house and just fuck things up. Ok, not bad. 
---
As he got older, the worse he got and is getting. Extreme temper at only 2 years old, almost impossible to punish because he will *LOSE* his shit, and impossible to reason with. He's definitely got some severe anger issues so I give him a lot of slack, but it's extremely draining. So yeah, theres still time my friend lol
---
One could argue that it feels bad that you are not allowed to use one of your class spells on a boss because of the debuff limit
---
hard pass on 2v2 and 3v3 pvp.
---
You're THAT upset over what was going to be literally less than 3 days of very limited gameplay?
---
THAT'S what killed the hype for classic for you?
---
If that's what killed the hype for you, I really doubt you ever had any real interest in classic to begin with.
---
Being that the us is the only country that matters (and where blizzard is hq) it should be held after most Americans call it a night.
---
It's not dishonorable if you do it before it comes out apparently.
---
This gets asked alot, but mage or warlock? I cannot decide. I played a mage until end of wrath before quitting for good. Since then I had have a lot of experience on private servers testing other classes.
---
I love that mages are basically good for all content, but am a little weary given over population. That being said, Warlock sounds very appealing. Are there any downsides?
---
Shadow priest is "s tier" for pvp and is "a tier" for holy/disc. Druid lags behind other than flag carrier. Higher skill cap as a druid, so you could wow people by exceeding expectations.
---
I don't really understand how the last 4 man group is expected to kill onyxia from 100-0% as everyone else is locked out.  Particularly in Phase 1.  
---
Once people start getting Vael/Drakes loot, and finish getting shit from rag, I could see it working.  But phase 1 how does a 4 man group in blues and maybe MC epics (people talking about doing this week 1) get ony down from 100-0%?
---
doesn't it incur a global cooldown when you switch weapons? Or was that not until later in the game
---
I'm decided on tauren druid. All I need to decide now is: male or female? What are the pros and cons of each? 
---
All I know so far is that male taurens can't fit through some gaps that females can.
---
Dont focus on efficiency and min maxing while leveling, dont rush to max level, enjoy the leveling experience :) pick up proffessions and level them up etc
---
You can swap whatever is in your main hand and offhand slots during combat. That means weapons, shields, offhand items like can be swapped out.
---
Paladin tanking while leveling is doable, but you're gonna have a rough time. If you really want to tank, consider rolling a warrior or a druid. If you really want to play paladin, maybe try healing dungeons instead of tanking them.
---
out of curiosity are you a pvper / dueler?
---
Level 60 in 15 days? Madman
---
As a warrior tanking dungeons while leveling, always loved a shaman in my group, druids too.
---
&gt;Want to heal and pvp.
---
Elemental Shaman.
---
They barely come out with episodes though.  Countdown to Classic is a lot better in that regard.
---
Semi computer noob here. Any idea where the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 10-series falls in comparison to the best out there (maybe the NVIDIA 2080 or whatever)
---
Can't create a portal in combat.
---
Bruh this whole post is about comparing the two what are you smoking?
---
One can only hope that this is the case.
---
You stop at a certain point where you aren't feeling safe about killing onyxia with the players you have left. Something like 15-20 people left :)
---
BFA. The game is still in Beta
---
I think WoW+ is a fantastic idea but I really hope we get tbc/wotlk at some point too. I miss blood elves so much!
---
Dead on arrival confirmed 
---
I think I really want a mix of everything but I'll probably spend more time in a battleground than anywhere else.
---
Warlocks are pretty rare Alliance side.
---
I thought it was 40 people go in.  No one is locked out.  40 People engage the boss.  No one is locked out.  Onyxia goes in the air.  No one is locked out.  Onyxia lands.  No one is locked out.  Onyxia gets low to 12% hp.  all except 10 people leave group and stand infront of her for a breath attack die and release.  Only 10 people in raid group and inside Onyxia's layer continue to do 2k-5k damage each.  10 people get locked out.  30 people zone in grab their corpse, and zone back out.  30 people go for second attempt.  20 people go for third attempt.  Best 10 geared players could call it here or try for a fourth attempt that would be super long, maybe pull in some alts with the ony key.
---
They can spin new realms in 10 minutes buddy.
---
It's 2019 for fuck sake. Cloud. Servers with orders of magnitude capacity compared to 2004-2005. A multi-billion company.
---
It's not like they are 3 days before release and go like : "Fuck, somebody pick up the company truck and go buy some servers".
---
At lvl 30 you basicly have your action bars fill with skills, but you really dont need to bind every single totem especially in PVE
---
This is actually consistent with this video from Vanilla(although I'm fairly certain this is from a patch earlier than 1.12):
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VFN6Z-TaKQ
---
Despite the 2k5 quality the chill is applied at roughly the same point in the cast bar.  On the first blizzard it's hard to tell since he's targeting something he wanded that's farther way but you can see when things turn blue.  Later blizzards you just need to look at when the chill falls off and then reapplies.  Actually...when he stops and pulls back to avoid the pat @ 2:30 or after he jumps back down around 2:50 would probably be the easiest to compare
---
I also love how it shows the old glitch of mobs snapping to your position and moving to where they actually are @ 2:06
---
It was in AQ gear against other AQ geared players. I had a BRE. I think that perhaps this gear level favors warrior a bit? I kill most casters in a few hits if I get on them but I still have quite high HP pool.
---
Im not a god, but I just learned how to react to my opponent and find that moment I can burst.... dueled alot of mages. Another person posted similar to what I am saying. I think the average warr ppl duel is just god awful and gives us bad name.
---
You have access to retail but not the expansions. Try playing retail WoW without any expansions, see how long that lasts.
---
When I had my first, I was prepared for a lot of effort and baby tending. What happened instead is I resubbed to WoW cause all he did was sleep in a blanketed laundry basket beside me. But yeah once they get moving it’s a lot more difficult. 
---
Now he is 9 and I make him help me farm herbs
---
Yes, no.
---
Yeah once you got to 60 and had friends leveling alts it was pretty common to run them through low lvl dungeons for quests/gear.

No, he is claiming those players who didnt notice leeway on pservers are now complaining about leeway on classic, you said you didnt notice leeway at all so he is not talking about you.
---
I bet there is one called “nacho libre” ;)
---
How doesn’t want cheap labor and 0 safety concerns?
---
WotLK is when the game went down hill, as that is when welfare epics and LFG finder was made.
---
Because many of the tailoring recipes in that level range require it, if I remember correctly. There’s a Spider Silk wall around level 150 or so and it is a pain to get past.

Tram was IF to SW

Boats were:
---
Booty Bay, Stranglethorn Vale ↔ Ratchet, The Barrens
---
Menethil Harbor, Wetlands ↔ Theramore Isle, Dustwallow Marsh
---
Menethil Harbor ↔ Auberdine, Darkshore

The rest was flight paths.

Undead priest looking to make a wand asap
---
Never played horde. So a few questions about the process
---
What would be the most optimal route. 
---
Do I farm the lvl 7-8 scarlet west of undercity dudes for cloth drops?
---
Do i level to 5 in deathknell and then start farming cloth? 
---
 Ill most likely have atleast 1 undead with me leveling.
---
I'm still torn between Shaman, Warlock or Warrior.  Horde, Orc, PvP server are all locked in though.  As much as I love Shaman and want to play it (I love the totem mechanic), not knowing if there will be new content to change up the meta in any way means that I'd much rather play an optimal tank or dps role rather than try to heal and/or memespec through progression.  I'm edging towards warrior mainly because it'd be a newer experience and it seems as if both roles will always be in high demand for group content.  
---
I am wondering what the game will look like in a year from now in terms of number of people raiding / playing.  I have a feeling this will be a smaller community with less barriers to entry for raiding than when vanilla was around, but we'll see.
---
That is why I ended my statement asking someone to correct me if I was wrong. I wasn't sure how Blizzard does their servers and how easy it is to spin up a new server to add in additional realms or not. I guess the main problem they would have would be creating too many servers since people are very against merging realms and dead servers are wasted cost.

I'd be amazed if Classic is priced in. If you listen to the calls, there is almost no mention (let alone expectations) around it. 
---
I haven't seen any sell-side research on it though so maybe some of the analysts have Classic in their models. Not sure many of them have that amount of time to delve so far into Activision's catalogue of products though.
---
No zombie apocalypse movie ever had the numbers that the NECKBEARD invasion will have at the launch of Classic.
---
I stick by my numbers since the November 2017 announcement : 6+ millions will log at Classic launch, and I do not exclude up to 8 millions.
---
My LOWEST expectation is 5 million at launch.
---
Thanks
---
I didn’t think DM would be in the game until P2?
---
So this is for level 50 twink only?
---
It's pretty irrelevant if it counts your corpse because you just take the ress sick and wait 15 mins and do the same thing - voila no corpse getting locked.
---
They WILL know once the news will break all over gaming media : "A 15 year old game is breaking all expectations, annihilating the current version of the game in numbers".
---
They won’t postpone the launch. That blizzard is dead and died when they merged with Activision.
---
Before that blizzard pushing things back was pretty common.
---
No you are not "fine" endgame if you don't heal, you will not raid if you are not Resto that's how Vanilla is, your dps as Enhance is horrible as you cannot even use Stormstrike due to the debuff limits. In addition elemental has the worst mana efficiency in the entire game and is considered to be the most selfish spec to play in Raids as well as you bring nothing a restoration shaman can't in fact you bring less.
---
Can I just use another character of my own for that?
---
So for example. I start a group on my main, invite my buddy, promote them to lead, I log off, I log onto my alt. Friend invites alt and promotes to leader, friend leaves, I log back into main. Now I can log off once I am done in an instance, log into my alt who is lead, reset, and then log back into my main?
---
They dont do 100 to 0 they do only the last few percents, you didnt lock unless you "saw" the kill.
---
Yeah but Jagex doesn't check into your account hack/scams/whatever unless you tweet them. Blizzard is much more serious.
---
The real point we are making is that other classes, given similar gear level, skill, hard work that you put into your class - should fuck you up in a 1v1 duel.  Not that warrior players are bad - it’s just the innate disadvantage and lack of tools. 
---
That being said - some unlucky rng for the other guy with a BRE and AQ gear means insta death lol
---
Related: Does anyone have a Gnome engineering guide for vanilla? Gnomes start with +15 engineering and allows you to skip though recipes.
---
$100 bet, you take any class I will play hunter 1 to 10 race then since they are so slow?
---
Alex was right.
---
Was anyone dying because of his pulls? If not it doesn't matter that you don't have aggro, and leaving the group over it is petty. Of course lying in general chat is out of line, but I would be more annoyed by someone leaving a group like that than being slandered in general chat.
---
The real point we are making is that other classes, given similar gear level, skill, hard work that you put into your class - should fuck you up in a 1v1 duel.  Not that warrior players are bad - it’s just the innate disadvantage and lack of tools.   Keep in mind - engineering is available to mages etc too lol. 
---
It just takes significantly more work and perfection to properly pilot a warrior to victory in a 1v1 duel than just about any other class - hence why it is considered weakest. Not that great warriors can’t win - it’s just vastly more difficult.
---
Guild Officer: great news, we just had a brazilian player join the guild
---
Raid Leader: well we only have room for 50-60 players on the raid team
---
Enchanting is just super difficult and expensive to level up. Especially on a first toon on a fresh launch. Save it for an alt, or at least until lvl 60. Besides, +3 spirit and +40 mana isn't exactly going to help you on your way to 60.
---
Skinning, meanwhile, is a gold generating machine in Vanilla. Rolling a lock and don't have to buy mount training? Even better. Youll have 110g at lvl 41 with your mount while everyone else will have 10g @ lvl 41, or just walking.
---
definitely the weirdest shit I've seen today
---
They’re currently in debates on if they should improve the infrastructure or supply a true original experience.
---
The actual Remote Auction House that used to cost $3 per month and then was made free in 2012 was retired last year. You can use remote desktop though it technically is against the EULA.
---
I was thinking Orc and Troll to have the flexibility to go Fury sometimes, but Tauren being a BIG mofo with big weapons may be fun.
---
Mostly it just makes it so much easier to fear, at least vs hunters. Getting deathcoiled was pretty much a death sentence, because it meant an easy fear and being covered in dots. 
---
Without deathcoil I can scatter to interrupt 1 fear, fd another, and be beating on the lock the whole time and getting distance between autoshots. He'll still probably kill me, but at least I stand a chance. Spent a ton on a shadow reflector for this reason.
---
But why stop the free money generator (because it’s just a slightly altered game from 15 years ago) at vanilla? Wrath was their highest grossing expansion yet, so I can almost guarantee it will at least expand into Wrath before a potential freeze.
---
Hen house private server is excellent for deciding on the playstyle you prefer.
---
Don’t forget the feralas boat to feather moon!
---
I dont think it was unlucky RNG. 
---
I dont think I vastly out skilled my opponents.
---
I think that perhaps in low level pvp warrs get rekt in duels. But at mid and high skill its alot more even.
---
Pretty sure the youtube clip I saw this in was from the Beta, but it could have been pserver. Didn't seem fuzzy enough for actual vanilla footage.
---
You could definitely tank in ret spec, but it might not be a fun experience.
---
True
---
Buy a stationary bike you can hop on for a minute or two in between flight paths.
---
I played a ton of legion and did all the challenging mage tower challenges on 4+ characters, and I really, really enjoyed Mythic+. However, the main thing that ruins it all for me is the hollowness, as you pointed out, but also the attitude of the players. Many people will insta-leave or berate the group after 1 wipe in a dungeon, they expect ultra fast pulls and "big dick dps". 
---
Retail players just treat the game, as well as other players, as a mine cart to carry them along through the content, and just get them free purples. And if anyone lacks at all they leave/hearth even when their own skill is very questionable (i.e. people not kicking obvious spells, not even once). I hate it so much. 
---
Classic can't come fast enough...
---
This is true, I just don't want to share my gear!
---
Woooooooooooow, really? When did this start? Remember when if you wanted to play Cata you needed wotlk, tbc, and vanilla?
---
I'm loving the rage from people who think Blizz postponed it just so the 3-day free sub will expire, like it's some grand conspiracy. It's a stress test, not a beta, chill the fuck out.
---
Someone is making a twink :P
---
Yes you can do some big solo pulls. but remember in vanilla leveling is not exponential. So you couldn't pull all of the cathedral room just by yourself and not expect to die in 3 seconds. Even as a prot spec you will need a healer to do huge pulls of level 35+ dungeons. Butyou could probably pull like half of deadmines at a time
---
No, they do not have at least until August 13th name reserve.
---
What they have, WE ALL HAVE : private server numbers, and even that is not really accurate.
---
Blizzard works with estimations, but those estimations MUST be on HARD NUMBERS, at least partially.
---
They do not have those numbers.
---
There is NO WAY to know how many people will play Classic, that are NOT playing WoW, and NEVER played private servers.
---
My personal (again, personal) estimate is that only 1 out 10 players that will play Classic are playing/played private servers.
---
Out of my old guild in Vanilla, which had well over 100 members...only 3 guys played on a private server. Ofc, this is not a metric, but clearly MOST people never played private servers, for obvious reasons.
---
But private servers had around 1 million players, at the peak. Does this means that are 9 million more players that will play Classic? Nope. But I am sure as hell that there are TENS OF MILLIONS of former WoW players that quit in Vanilla, TBC and Wrath, and a good chuck of them will come back for Classic.
---
How big of a chunk? I have no idea...and neither does Blizzard.
---
I am estimating 6+ millions to come back. Blizzard might estimate 2 million. Doesn't matter, both estimation are  speculations based on numbers that are partially correct.
---
The EASY way is to say this : "Classic will have between 100k and 20 million players at launch".
---
But this is like saying "Fuck me, I have no idea", because it's the same.
---
Either way, Blizzard is WRONG, because they UNDERESTIMATE the Classic numbers.
---
Good post. Very tempting to no life it, but we need to have balance.
---
What would they have to gain from doing that? Sounds like an unfounded conspiracy theory.
---
Who shit in your mouth
---
Welfare epics started in Vanilla with ZG and in TBC with the Isle of Quel'Danas and badge gear.
---
I love you too!
---
A release window is different than a release date
---
90% set on warrior for tanking.
---
Saved me a copy + paste, thanks.
---
So I have decided a name and race for each class, spanning Horde and Alliance. I know I'll be leveling my rogue with my GF when she has time to play, but I'll have much more time leveling by myself. Right now I am leaning hard to Tauren Druid, Orc Shaman, or Dwarf Paladin as my "main" toon. I like being on the tankier side of things, and have always loved the battle priest playstyle in RPGs. 
---
I like leveling and making alts, so I plan on eventually playing everyone a little bit, but I want to get atleast one to 60 before going hamm on alts. I never hit 60 when playing during vanilla, so that'll feel extra nice. Might just roll a die to figure out which one to "main" because they all have pros and cons to me and I can't quite decide.
---
The introduction of arena caused them to balance classes around those pvp formats, which led to class homogenization and that's a bad thing.
---
Pick flag, turn into cheeta, run like hell.
---
The real ball punch is the Paladin SFK class quest at 20. Similar distance, just more things that murder you.
---
OSRS would have never have this success (in the long term) if they didn't improve and add content to the game. Not sure this is going to happen with vanilla.
---
They might open new server in like 2 years for TBC
---
God damn I forgot about the shadow reflector. That shit was so annoying. You're totally right that the death coil is just an insane setup into fear as well.
---
More of an issue for Paladins is their mitigation. They have basically exactly the same stats as warrior (same health/armor in the same gear) but they have no way to have over 100% avoidance like warriors do with shield block up. Also their talents are strange for raid tanking as a few of them only proc when you get crit, which you generally dont want a raid boss to do to you. Also on bosses where taunting is required, they have no taunt. Also, until BC they have no great way to get mana during longer fights.
---
So do 12 year olds
---
&gt; 60 I ran 0/25/31
---
You did what now?
---
"Not what wow was about" ok buddy. Was that in the manual or something?
---
if you want to tank go druid
---
If you want to be one of the most useful classes in a 5man group go shaman for totems
---
Also Turtle Scales.
---
Technically this is against the EULA, but Blizzard doesn't have a real way of knowing nor have I ever heard of anyone getting suspended/banned.
---
I’m a returning player for classic. Haven’t played since wrath. Purely anecdotal but I have about 5 irl friends who are going to be subbing back for classic. How long everyone stays is another matter but I think it’s going to be big
---
Overall the biggest consideration should be how long an item will be used for. I’d be willing to guess that the majority of items that a healer and caster want will be replaced by the healer much quicker.
---
8 week old at home, idk what you mean I have an alarm clock that goes off every 4 hours then goes back to bed after i feed him, go to bed my pumpkin daddy has a priest to level up
---
Hello all, long post ahead. Please, if you have time, I’d really love help. I am getting frustrated because I just cannot decide.
---
I have posted in the what should I play Wednesday thread a couple times this summer. I’ve gotten some responses that were good and thoughtful, but I’m not any closer to deciding on my main class for vanilla. I think the reason is because I’ve written down EVERY part of my considerations, and haven’t really focused on the main reasons this is a dilemma for me. So, this time, I will try to be more concise about my main dilemma, and see if it’s easier for people to make a good recommendation. 
---
Background: I’m a mythic raider in modern wow, planning on quitting entirely for classic. I used to main purely pvp before they ruined world pvp, and switched to being a pve main - pvp was always my favorite part of wow. I want to play a MAGE or a WARLOCK. I will be playing HORDE, by far my favorite faction. Since pvp is alive and well in classic, I want that to be the biggest thing I do. I do not, however, want to really grind the ranks in bg’s. I have a full time job and don’t have the time to spam premades enough to get to a high rank, so while I want to play pvp a lot, I will not be aiming to hit high warlord or anything like that. I’m into world pvp (both solo AND group) and BGs as I feel like it. To get the gear without grinding my ranks, I need to raid too. That’s also fine because I do want to see the content and I’m willing to put in the work for pre-bis and get in a good casual or semi hardcore raid guild just to clear and get gear. YES, I know that it costs gold to switch specs between raid and pvp. I’m willing to grind the gold, please do not consider this a factor in my decision. Luckily, both lock and mage have specs that are good in both raid and PvP. 
---
So here’s the dilemma. I don’t care what I raid as, since both classes get raid spots easily and they’re both fairly boring in raid. Mage has a slight edge for raiding for me because it doesn’t make soul shards and it has passive spell hit and threat reduction. But, pve at endgame isn’t my dilemma. The reasons I want to play warlock are that I think it would be more fun and easier to level, gets cooler looking tier (and locks DO wear their tier sets in PvP early on since they’re so tanky), I slightly prefer its theming to mage (not by much, not enough that it’ll be a huge deal), and I enjoy the prospect of becoming a monster in PvP with gear. I’m worried about lock because I had a full time job and I know locks are gear dependent as fuck, and I am also worried about how they perform in PvP early on. I want pvp to be my most fun part of the game, so I am worried about potentially waiting until BWL or ZG to truly come online in pvp. A nice bonus for lock is it’s more unique than mage, too. I would enjoy a mage because of its quality of life, gold farming potential, mobility with blink and control with CC, and I think it’s super fun to play in PvP. Mage is my most played class for pvp in early wow, I’m good at it already. My biggest issues with mage is that I think it’ll be so common and overplayed, and also leveling isn’t as fun as lock. Additionally, I don’t find mage gear cool looking (not a great reason to not play one) and I feel like warlock will eventually become so strong in later patches that I could regret not playing one when I see soul link warlocks with gear and good skill 3v1ing fools in the world. 
---
So basically, do I want later vanilla OPness in PvP with fun leveling and cool flavor, and being unique, or do I want consistent great and FUN PvP play all of vanilla with great quality of life and good utility/cc as well as gold farm, at the expense of being a common class with less fun leveling?
---
Thanks for reading. I look forward to replies.
---
That changed in late Cata, I think. I remember being pissed about it.
---
No
---
Read Overpower Tooltip. You missing a hit is not same as enemy dodging a hit. Jesus christ
---
He’s gonna play holy pally at 60 but just tank dungeons here and there for us
---
They want them as customers.
---
What sucks is that once you know how the mechanics of the game work, the first 10 levels can be super easy for some classes.  For the hunter, time your autoshots and you can kite while shooting and even at level 1 you can easily kill mobs before they reach you.  Concussive Shot at level 8 makes this super easy.
---
Some were bust most were spot on. Blizzard is fucking this up pretty badly. I really don't want to play the game with the 400ms delay all the time and that crazy melee leeway. I'm gonna play it for sure but it's gonna feel so bad and I'm going to have a negative attitude about it every time I log in. It just really sucks.
---
Same, haven't gotten anything
---
That outcome is phenomenally unlikely. 
---
Think about the warlock's position. He doesn't know I am deeply annoyed with the other 3 people, or even that I noticed that they were not with us. He doesn't know that I am committed to his side, and he might think "oh, I am delaying 4 people, and I really want to run deadmines." 
---
I think it is INCREDIBLY likely that the first person to cave is the warlock, and then I lose my primary advantage: that I have a reasonable justification for the course of action I want to take: getting out of that group and leaving those 3 people behind. 
---
Furtermore, my experience tanking has been excellent. Simple reality is, if you are just a warrior of the correct level, people whisper you to run dungeons. If you are good, people routinely say as much and ask to add you. "reputation" is not a scarce resource that you have to hoard, and furthermore, people running a good dungeon with an excellent tank, who then hear "that guy died and dropped group without even getting to the instance", are going to put WAY more weight on their own experience.
---
Beyond that, I WANT those 3 guys to blacklist me. Often, as a tank, what happens is that someone whispers the group leader "invite playername", and then the leader invites you. You don't know who is in the group until you accept. I don't want to be in a group with those guys again, so it's much better if our agreement not to group with each other is mutual. 
---
End of the day, I feel that my action was COMPLETELY correct, from a strategic point of view. 
---
By quitting quickly, I strengthen the warlock's position in the group, by making it clear that I was angry with the OTHER people, not the warlock. 
---
I also make it appear that they were the people delaying the dungeon unacceptably, when the actual facts of the situation were that they were at the dungeon entrance, TECHNICALLY waiting for their tank and one of their dps to get there.  
---
And beyond that, I just invest the minimal time possible, which is also important to me.
---
Just gotta use some common sense. If I'm a ret pally healing a 5 man while levelling I'm not going to instantly roll on anything with int and screw over the mage/warlock. Honestly healing is very easy in vanilla, having the best gear very rarely actually makes a difference. You can get by mostly just with taking the int quest rewards (when there is no good ret quest reward).  
---
If no one else needs it or it's just a minor upgrade for the mage/warlock than sure i'd roll. No way I'd take a nice +dmg/healing or crit or hit item off them though (or spirit gear off a levelling shadowpriest).
---
Believe this came with either WoD or Legion
---
I would at least get some hunter cc to get a feel for what the class can do. Hell, when you add in scare beast your cc is godlike depending on what moves you are fighting. Just having a pet tank doesn't get that feel for you. And if you are pvping. I'd recommend 30+. If you are in your 30s and hating hunter pvp the class probably isn't for you.
---
The companion app does not have auction or bank access.
---
We will see.
---
Caffeine! That’s my plan for playing and having an 8 week old, I’m trying to stop caffeine totally until WoW release so that it really effects me and I can do 4 hours of sleep and get a good 3-4 hours in a day
---
This is literally the opposite of indefinitely
---
Old-school RuneScape before changes was very bare... There was barely any end game content and it was rather empty. Wow has years of content to be slowly unlocked. I agree with you, I just don't think we'll see changes until the initial cycle is complete. The unused zones would do great if they made them sideways upgrades, allowing more niche roles.
---
Agreed man.  PvP puts the war in Warcraft.  Getting ganked is pretty much a natural part of WoW and really not that big of a deal once you get out of STV.
---
I'd be super cool with it.
---
Don't overthink it - if you like the class play it. There are so many unknowns. My experience is that most of the people try a class and before they reach 60 decide to roll something else. Also you are reading a few opinions on the internet which don't represent the majority of players. I believe there will be many people playing even the meme specs because they find it fun for some reason.
---
Maybe if you didn't post dumb topics that are themselves toxic you'd have better luck.
---
I highly recommend Holy Paladin if you want to heal in PvP. The R10 gear does very well even against endgame caster burst. You have the strongest heals in the game and can dispel Viper Sting. Only downside is you can't farm as Holy so be prepared to roll a Mage/Hunter alt for gold.
---
One more boat from Auberdine to Darnasus.
---
Also the zeplins.
---
I believe snapshotting works with Berserking.
---
Warrior is the only class that'll be played more than Shaman Horde side lol
---
Even if full heirloom gear it isn't quite that easy once you get to higher levels. If you play a priest, 1-5 you'll one-shot everything with a single SW:Pain, but the proportion of mob HP it does steadily drops once you get beyond that. Depending on class/spec you can easily pull 3-6 mobs at a time, but 1-5 doesn't give a good picture of what the leveling experience is like. The difficulty can actually be pretty spike-y as you level faster than you upgrade your non-heirloom gear.
---
If that is the case then Warriors in pvp are not the best class for you, same as rogues and mages they require quick reaction times to excel.
---
Mage is stronger in premades and perhaps slightly less gear dependent.  I would probably choose warlock for world pvp, but both are strong.  One big benefit of the warlock is that the raiding spec sm/ruin is actually decent in pvp while a mage raiding spec skips all the key pvp talents.  It sounds like warlock would be a new experience for you so i would suggest that.  Warlock also had so much flavor in vanilla it was pretty awesome (bonus you can roll orc warlock which is pretty op with the stun resist).
---
Ive played Druid as main for so long, original vanilla and retail. So part of me likes that but I've always felt like I wanted to play something else, I guess its grass is greener syndrome. However every time I do try another class I feel something missing... I miss stealth, I miss heals, I miss instant root breaks and so on. 
---
Anyone know this feel?
---
They can't have the stress test in the same time with the name reserve.
---
It is either BEFORE or AFTER that.
---
The stress test will be one week BEFORE August 13th, or one week BEFORE Classic launch on August 26/27th.
---
We need more shards!!!
---
That moment when you’ve been questing in this weird dark enchanted forest for a few hours and you turn the corner and see that big wall outside Darnassus for the first time was such a great moment.
---
Lmao
---
Yeah, I knew what you were getting at.  WotLK made gearing up MUCH easier and especially so with the introduction of ToC in patch 3.2.  That raid and dungeon was purely a loot pinata.  It also started the theme of "play the patch, not the expansion."
---
10/10 is much more demanding than Vanilla's max settings. Max settings in Vanilla is probably around 4-5 in Classic; there is even a "Classic" preset option in Classic that will get you close to Vanilla visual settings, and I believe that goes to 4/10 plus some other sliders are adjusted.
---
As long as they keep servers that are Classic content only I’m really hoping they do more content post nax.
---
I made a post a while back about [unfinished/cut content](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8c0t4b/cutunfinished_content/) and a lot of this stuff as far as I know is still unfinished. They could also do “pre cata” versions of the content that has since released since classic so we could experience those things as they would’ve existed in Classic based on the lore.
---
I think the PvP system needs an overhaul too. Make it so that it’s not a time sink, but make it so that it’s also not available to everyone and their cousin either. I was thinking something [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwowplus/comments/c5cjqj/pvp_overhaul/) but I’m not committed 100% because I know the suggestions in that post are still rough around the edges.
---
One thing I think we as a community should try to do is try and convince blizzard to make a “constitution” of sorts that defines what classic vanilla “philosophy” is so no new content can be added that may go against the things that made vanilla great.
---
Even without competition, the distance between nodes and how slow you skill up will actually slow down your lvling as you stay behind in zones to keep up with gathering.
---
I'm trying to find this. Is that because of section C.v "Cloud Computing"? If you use something like RDP then there's no third-party server involved, just Blizzard (the first party) and two machines owned by you (the second party). I don't think C.viii is relevant because you aren't interacting at all with "the communication protocols used by Blizzard," nor is C.ix because you aren't creating a connection to "the Platform" except in the normal way through the PC you always use. You're only sending image and mouse and keyboard data back and forth.
---
Or is this under a really broad reading of C.ii.4?
---
This is the answer
---
3hrs a day of pvp can get rank 10 easy
---
Yeah I know holy is bis for Paladins, but there's more to the game than raiding, pvp interests me more anyway. Why not do some tanking on the side to mix things up :)
---
Assign one to each side of a coin, and then flip the coin.  If you find you were disappointed by what side you landed on, just go with the other.
---
I know right? Why on earth would you plan holidays around the release of a game by a company that's famous for 'Soon(tm)' ie It's ready when it's bloody ready?
---
That I can get behind, but even with pushback, you don't need to go super deep into healing trees for that. I would say even DPS spec can get them pretty easy (even if it not a "pure" dps spec, more hybrid)
---
For pushback talents:
---
Druid - Tier 2
---
Paladin - Tier 2
---
Shaman - Tier 3
---
Priest - Tier 1
---
Going further down a DPS tree would significantly help your survival chances, and picking up a handful of hybrid talents from healing tree, to prevent pushback will help.
---
ROFL! Thats what I was thinking. Why would abt sane person want to breed?
---
Am a poor wow player here. Trust me, you will be happier being a casual making 6 figures.
---
Tried it. That doesn’t work on me, lol - thanks though
---
It *is* a third party server. Ownership doesn't matter.
---
When to group up: Just wait until you all meet up in Darkshore at ~13
---
Class selection: Mage + Paladin is going to open up some great AoE potential, but with a 4 man group, you should be fine with either Mage or Warlock.
---
Leveling speed: A group of 4 is going to get more experience from grinding than single or duo, *as long as you are killing the same number of mobs per minute*. i.e., if you normally kill 1 mob per minute solo, your group needs to kill 4 mobs per minute. Gathering quests will take longer, because you'll all need to compete for drops, but this is going to occur anyway due to the fresh server crowding. A big advantage of your proposed group, is you could do any dungeon whenever you want (finding one more dps is easy), and you will never have to find people to help with elite quests.
---
Nothing wrong with that, pallys are actually good five man tanks, just not great raid tanks lol
---
Imagine the tears? Why are people like you so obsessed about people who don't like classic wow crying? Just let them have their shitty game and we can have ours.
---
From memory Onyxia drops an item which can be redeemed by 3 classes for the T2 helm. If there are no hunters it will be looted by the other 2 classes who can use it.
---
I'd be pissed to have died and released and the loot I want is dropping, even if I don't get locked.
---
Just play a druid or shaman. As long as you have innervate/WF up, no one will pay attention to you.
---
My biggest reservation with the warlock is purely that people talk about early vanilla pvp as warlock with such doom and gloom. Like it’s just horrible until at least past the MC patch. Do you know how valid it is? I want to feel strong and useful right from the start.
---
+5 axe skill doesn't give 3% crit and 3% hit with axes in raids....
---
Unless you can find a specific source for that, the 3% crit penalty is global, and you don't get 3% hit for just 5 axe skill.
---
Do not be the idiot who takes off work for this launch
---
It's not until you max Impale and 2h weapon specialization that overpower truly hits like a truck.
---
And around that level you would be getting the WW axe, which pretty much shits all over any combination of 2Hers at the time anyway in raw DPS even without fishing for extra Dodges.
---
HorrifiedRabbit is correct 100, if another class gets an opener on a Warrior in the open world it is a free kill unless you outgear/outskill and out level them. It gets to the point where you literally feel bad for attacking a Warrior in the open world because they are so easy to kill especially if they are already in combat they can't even hit you as a ranged class. (it's easy to out range them as a hunter or mage)
---
Get life insurance, fake death, ???, profit.
---
I recently leveled 1-70 on a tbc server, and 1-60 is mostly the same for shamans compared to vanilla except for getting dual wield which is a lot faster than the typical dagger + shield.
---
You get a lot of tools for escaping death and dealing with multi-mob pulls. Ghost Wolf is a very nice perk as well.
---
You can either opt to kill things faster and spend more time drinking or kill things slower and drink a lot less. It's a pretty safe class to level and because you'll be doing flametongue dagger + shield, the dps is predictable and reliable so you'll know if you have enough health/mana to finish a mob or if you need to run/kite.
---
The water totem quest at 20 is brutal but definitely worth it IMO. A combination of healing sprint totem + stoneskin let's you facetank multiple mobs and mana spring totem is absolutely amazing if you can find a good spot to drop all your totems and pull mobs to it to get the most out of the duration. The poison / disease cleansing totems can be extremely useful too as some mobs continuously reapply diseases with long durations that reduce your stats by a large chunk and poisons that do quite a lot of damage over the full duration.
---
To me, the typical flametongue + shield method is pretty slow and boring. It's reliable but you just sit there and auto while you face tank most of the time. With that said, most melee specs/classes do something similar anyway. I personally used two-hands and staves a lot when I found a good drop / quest reward but it's definitely not the optimal way.
---
If you mostly enjoy leveling over endgame then it's a good contrast to other classes because you get spells, totems, melee augments, and even heals. If you're not worried about the most efficient or optimal way to level then I think it's a lot of fun, especially when you get stormstrike.
---
In dungeons you'll be expected to heal most of the time as your dps is fairly lacking until later levels and mana is a huge problem. It's also possible to tank lower level dungeons but I wouldn't recommend that, you have good singletarget threat but you'll have problems keeping adds off the healers and the dps that just go ham and ignore marks / cc.
---
&gt; When will people get this? Blizzard didn't balance vanilla entirely around raiding. It was only later that raiding became the "main content" of WoW. 
---
Blizzard made raiding the main focus of vanilla after hitting lvl 60. it makes sense to assume the game would be somewhat balanced around the only activity they bothered to develop.
---
Same. I hadn't played since MoP and decided to level a monk to 120, without heirlooms. It wasn't bad; it was easy enough that generally I was pulling 2-4 mobs at a time, but it wasn't so easy that combat felt totally trivial. I enjoyed it for the most part. Though I recommend anyone who does this to avoid Outland for 60-80; those zones really show their age.
---
Unfortunately you can't opt-out of heirlooms when it comes to playing with other players. Literally everyone's in heirloom gear, and if you're not it's genuinely like you're a lone normal player in a sea of twinks. Heirlooms are one reason among many why low-level WoW is a mess and it's best just to blast through it ASAP.
---
Oh ok thanks for all the information definently gives me a lot to think about
---
I hear Ret paladins are perfect for the alt tab porn session, so perfect for looking after the kid too
---
So in othed words, you're a *helicopter parent*
---
thought the consensus on tank was troll&gt;=orc &gt;tauren
---
Well if you're a ret pally and you're not healing, of course you aren't going to roll. Taking items for an off spec you're not using in a dungeon is pretty much straight up ninja'ing.  
---
I guess you can make an argument for rolling on anything +int as a healer but I just don't see the need. If I'm healing SM Cathedral on a ret pally it makes practically no difference if I'm in ilvl 30 or ilvl40 gear. It won't make the run any faster or smoother or easier really. So I'm not going to take the neck with +7 stats on it just because it's an *upgrade* for me, when it'll be a massive upgrade for the mage/warlock that will constantly use it.
---
How did they get an ancient city on top of a 4-year old tree?
---
so #nochanges extends to exploits now? That's pretty lame.
---
10 is doable for a semi-casual, 13 is absolutely impossible.
---
Roll a mage in Classic and see how quickly you run out of mana killing those Level 1 pigs or wolves or whatever.
---
Yeah, even if Classic ends up failing and proving Blizzard correct in the long run, there are so many people hyped up for it that the first month or two will have the servers full to the brim. Layering is *definitely* going to be required just to be able to play the game.
---
Yeah, this...especially since Shadowpriests are the second worst dps spec in the game. Shadoweaving priests allow you to buff the Warlocks the exact same as Shadowpriests and also can heal to 85-90% healing efficiency.
---
Desk calendar , cork pin board for all your notes , Azeroth map , ashtray , trash bin , drinks + snacks + prepared foods , notepad for player names , notepad for reminders , notepad for goals , pens , red green and yellow highlighters , wall decorations , tarot cards , optimal desk location in accordance to bathroom space , weed or other , uhhhh comfy clothes , keep all sunlight from your room and only use artificial light , cover clocks , blanket and pillow near by , toaster and mini fridge , fruit , energy drinks or supplements  , couch for you dog girlfriend wife or family to visit , tinfoil hat , fresh oxygen pumped into room , symbol or poster of your faction , symbol or poster of opposite faction , throwing darts , napkins , a towel , foot massager , cellphone and charger , blank paper for doodling , Bluetooth speaker , uhhhhh yeah that all I got for now
---
Yes, but any other time you are being a subpar DPS.
---
Again, if the point is to help people, you either go resto shaman (and interrupt/grounding totem enemy casts) or you go warrior to tank.
---
Yea but I will not be best in anything. I have settled for that a looong time ago. I think I was in my teens when I found out that I would never try to be best. I just want to be mediocre and have fun. But it’s good to know what is theoretical best. And then try to use the right skills in a mediocre way lol. 
---
Let’s see how that holds up for leveling on a pvp server hehe. I know pvp BG’s will be fun with a warrior as I played that for all vanilla
---
Based on the name I'm guessing Horde? I'm gonna be looking for an Ally guild for a 29 hunter.
---
Priest by a big margin over both druid &amp; warlock.
---
Priest over druid because you only need 2 sets of gear, a dps set &amp; a healing set as a priest vs a druid who has to carry a tank set, a cat set, a healing set &amp; a PvP set (the way PvP works for a druid requires specialized gear). It's a lot of gear as a druid vs only 2 sets as a priest.
---
Priest over warlock because it's easier to gear up as a priest, as groups just love healers. So you'll get both a decent healing set and a decent dps set before any warlock, just by getting invited to groups 5 times more often.
---
Absolutely. I have to go feral though. I was always the token guild/faction/server "feral player". I can't "not" do it.
---
When I started again in Legion I was really disappointed that feral and guardian were split out from each other. I leveled guardian thinking I would tank, but I found the tanking really zerg and aoe filled and it wasn't my thing. So I went feral then and "mastered" the spec as it was at the moment pulling top numbers relative to my ilvl. But they were kinda weak at the beginning of Legion, very dependent on specific legendaries, and while I personally have no problem playing blood talons/savage roar/etc some people hate that build. I persevered, and as legion went on they got buffed quite a bit I was having a decent time. I did hate the negative attitudes so many people had about feral, but it was the same as ever to me (I don't think I've ever been playing them when they were in vogue).
---
Well when BFA came out feral wasn't terrible, but it once again dropped back down near the bottom of the pack. I finished all the rep grinds and quests on my druid, but then leveled my warlock to raid. And boy was warlock incredibly strong, way easier to play, and scaled like crazy. I was quickly better than all the other locks in my guild and we were stomping things. But I also burned out almost immediately. As soon as that raid went off cutting edge, I left the game to spend my time elsewhere.
---
And recently (because of the classic stress test) I came back to BFA, and I just naturally picked up my druid... not the lock. And it's so obvious why. Nothing feels as fluid to me. I've spent so many literal months of playtime on my druids that it's just second nature.  I move and use shapeshifts and all the spells so fluidly regardless of version of the game. It's all muscle memory and instinct at this point. Sure, I can play the meta classes/specs pretty well, but they'll always feel like I'm putting on a mask or something. And finally, we get to go back to feral being a single homogenous spec and not two separate ones. Finally we get to go back to still being a halfway decent healer even when specced feral. Finally we get to go back to having our full kit and not getting locked out of it depending on spec.
---
Rogue, Warlock, Mage are the 3 classes I’ve rotated between for as long as I’ve played. Have always been an alt whore and indecisive on even retail. This tier I’m raiding as a rogue but lowkey if I go back to retail during or after classic, I’m done raiding as melee, I’m going full time lock or mage on retail.
---
I don't think Blizzard *wants* Classic to fail (Why would they not want to make money?) but I do think they're expecting it to. They've always had a policy of "vanilla WoW was fun in 2005 but it doesn't hold up to modern game standards" and the entire project feels like malicious compliance to prove it to us and get insane sub counts for a month or two at a very low development cost. Of course, whether they're right or not remains to be seen but I really get the feeling that they're not expecting a massive success and just want to pad their retail WoW sub counts a bit.
---
I think the only thing that changes is that the amount of damage you deal in very short windows of uptime on your opponents is eventually enough to kill them if everything crits. 
---
I still think they are the weakest class in 1v1 all else being equal. I’ve seen AQ geared warriors get kited by fresh 60 hunters lol
---
This is my dream as well. They have a unique opportunity to time travel back to the beginning and learn from future mistakes. I would love an alternate timeline where events play out differently.
---
They may still kill there target. Druids run, they might kill but a lot of the time they run.
---
You'll have healers around. If your goal is solo wpvp, play a hunter or rogue (druid is pretty good with this also.)
---
Due, I just have to upvote your comment :D.
---
Lmao that’s the truth
---
Because you're trying to talk about Druids and I'm talking about Skarm.
---
Feral Druids can't tank all raid bosses "fine".  Warriors can. A good warrior will always be better than a Druid. A druid will simply be better than a bad Warrior (which there are a lot of).
---
Warriors take less damage than Druids, Tips Out recently said in his video that all information from private servers is basically irrelevant.
---
Thats fucking fucked up
---
Hi Dad!
---
That baby's gonna be pissed, just like me when I keep forgetting to update my hearth from Northshire abbey, even though I'm well into Westfall content.
---
Baby: Damn! I forgot to change my hearth. Fuck it, I'm logging off. I'll walk back there tomorrow.
---
BINGO !
---
Priest no contest
---
yeah. I thought the warrior was as fun as the druid (in a different way, obviously). The other classes I think have their moments, but I didn't find them as consistently fun to play.
---
Maybe play two characters, a druid and something else?
---
It would be stupid not to develop on top of classic, after all the legendary staff from naxx teleports you to someplace they were planning to add to classic... so they should just dig those things up and add them.
---
Okay well hunters were the worst matchup for me by far. Could never figure that one out fully but the whole taunt the pet to break out of the trap did help. But like I could consistently beat mages, even if I didnt get BRE procs or lucky crit strings. Between Frost Reflector, Grenade, Trinket, intercept I could consistently find a window to hit/kill
---
I am not familiar with the current one, just throwing ideas.
---
How will it impact Classic throughout its life?
---
You're letting a new player choose a class for weeks or months only to find out he can't play that class/spec in endgame anymore and is stuck and has to reroll?
---
Imagine that poor guy going for paladin because he thinks he can go tank / dps and everyone tells him "no way, memespecs not allowed"
---
Some people can only read words without actually understand what those words mean,
---
all i got from your post was that "Feral is not viable because it cannot always tank every boss".
---
this is complete bs.
---
crush is only 150%, the same as a crit it is no more dangerous.
---
you are more or less armor capped with stoneshield potion at all times even in shit tier gear, most even hard hitting bosses will barely hit you harder than 3.5-4k.
---
this idea that they are not viable because they are never 100% best on every fight is fucking absurd, they make for excellent off-tanks(especially on alliance) and are nowhere near as wheelchair as prot pal/ret/moonkins.
---
Agreed
---
I mean, it SHOULDN'T hold up by today's standards, but the cost of MMO's put them to only existing in the AAA sphear for a long time, and due to the high costs and need for low risk, the genre hasn't really progressed since. I hope classic wow does amazing not cause i want classic wow, but because i want the game finally in 2022 that we should have got in 2012.
---
That sounds familiar.. but yup, damn right with the more active part! Goddamn no time anymore.
---
Most people who want to dps at end game think just showing as the right class will make them top the damage meters. So dpsing as a druid and not being at the bottom is pretty easy.
---
I am so fucking frustrated with my decision right now.
---
I will be playing semi-hard core at around 20-25 hours a week, and want to make sure while I’m able to no-life the game that I’m spending my time wisely.
---
I’m stuck between three choices right now
---
&gt; Undead Warlock, Tailoring/Enchant 
---
&gt; Undead Rogue, Skinning/Leather Working
---
&gt; Undead Mage, Herb/Alch 
---
I love all three classes, and plan on using whichever one I pick for raiding and some casual side-PvP.  
---
Any suggestions about what you think would result in an easier hearing experience, maybe? It’s the only dividing line I can think of.
---
The folks that are locked out can't help in the next encounter though (for that week). You'd have to be careful to not leave people with too gimped of a group to do it for the final run.
---
I think you need ~3 months and weekly standing of ~300-500 to get rank 10.
---
Similar time and weekly standing of maybe ~5-10 to get rank 13.
---
Not sure about exact numbers but I think it is something like that.
---
Min/maxed my fertility, so I have six weeks of paternity leave starting Saturday August 31st. Get on my level (literally) other dads! It's fine, L2F(uck in an optimal manner)
---
Yea whenever a mage was looking for me (rogue) they’d start jumping around using AE.
---
R10 is doable as a casual without premades, but if you take engineering there's not much difference to rank 8 since you'll be wearing the goblin rocket helm a lot of the time and breaking your 6 set bonus. If you can get a decent set of shoulders you might as well stop ranking at r8.
---
Who said I can't play wow when my baby is sleeping?  Also, by the time my baby is 5 years old they'll be the perfect farming bot for my account.  By the time I get home from work I'll have a full bank of herbs.
---
Most will require a bit more attention than that though. Or you can get unlucky and get one with colic, like I did (yay).
---
Was 15 I guess. Played 24/7 skipped school frequently to play .. 31 soon and I am married with a 2.5 y/o and a month old. I dont game until they are both asleep so will be hard to get quality time in without getting zero sleep .
---
I have 3 old keyboards saved for raging.
---
But I bet they will be fine.
---
Blizzard NEVER missed a hard launch date.
---
They missed ESTIMATED launch days, but never hard deadlines.
---
So how exactly is a private server bug relevant to anything at all?
---
It sort of depends on what you consider an exploit. People say wall jumping is a part of vanilla and cheered when they confirmed it worked in AV and WSG.
---
Say you found a way to wall jump and bug on top of something in arena on live? You're going to be punished for that. It's considered an exploit on retail, but sort of a great area in classic.
---
I actually didn’t know we could get dreadmist from launch... that’s pretty tempting.
---
Classic servers remain Classic forever, Classic+ servers open up on the side though with new content (dungeons, races, etc.) that stayed capped at 60. TBC is an inevitability
---
If the guild is good enough to do this than more power to them imo.
---
If the top comment is describing this bug appropriately reseting a raid multiple times a week seems like a pretty clear exploit.
---
Words marked.
---
Also, downvoted.
---
Or people that want to be a swole dwarf hunter.
---
Play night elf so you can shadowmeld take care of it and then come back.
---
Oh no how horrible to have to reroll and enjoy the leveling experience again.
---
I am thinking about maining a feral tank druid.   What faction would be best and why?
---
Figure it out? First time on youtube?
---
Every kid is different my man. My son had colic and cried about 18 hours a day. He basically had 3 hour cycles of crying for 60 minutes, feeding and fussing for 30 minutes, and then crying for 45 minutes. Then he would sleep for 45 minutes - rinse and repeat. Was awful... he grew out of that by about 5 months thankfully.
---
From 5 months until 13 months he was great. Seriously golden age for us. Then he learned to walk and shit got real. Started throwing things everywhere and breaking everything. We had to put up gates around our house to prevent him from touching anything. He broke our TV (wall mounted) with the TV remote by throwing it at it. He can only have soft toys because everything is a throwing object to him after more than a minute.
---
Now he is 2 and listens about 10% of the time. He is in the 98th percentile and is way too big for his behaviour. He is a one man wrecking crew and pretty much destroys everything he touches. He's pretty damn goofy and funny though. 
---
But I still wouldn't change him for the world. He's my boy and I'm a proud papa. I know a lot of these threads talk about no-life'ing the game and I get that, but I wouldn't miss this time for him for all the gold in Azeroth.
---
It was an ESTIMATED release date.
---
Please understand the difference.
---
I'm not sure it was ever considered a bug.  I believe as they updated and made changes to the servers over time they were able to make abilities(not just blizzard) more "responsive" later in the games life.
---
I've said this in other posts but functionality like this affects how the game feels and plays.  Personally I'm one of the old school Vanilla players looking for that old feel again so I'm kinda against making such a change...at least pre-launch.  I understand why people want to change but...just let us old soldiers experience it again :(
---
Also more as joke but I just want to point out that soon after 1.12 they capped AoE damage...so be careful about asking for changes, You might get monkey paw'd   :p
---
Classic will run on a new client, so you need to be able to run a client similar to current wow
---
And a fallacy.
---
if you bet me 15$ that Ill still be playing by next month Ill take you up on that offer ;)
---
Night elves were introduced to the Warcraft franchise by an orc warrior (Grom) talking about their unmatched savagery. They were introduced as a wood-living secluded race that murders you the second you step foot into their forest or touch a tree the wrong way.
---
That's what we were told has been their society for 10.000 years. 4 years in the Alliance and...
---
Ishnu Alah weary traveler, how may I help? Peace be with you.
---
The first quest you encounter after leaving the starting zone as a Night Elf is a satyr ordering you to kill animals of the forest to perform dark magic. The 'Council of the Forest' of course knows about it and thus tasks you... cast a frog-hex onto the satyr.
---
Speaking about the fact that Teldrassil is 4 years old - half of the quests in the zone talk about how the furbolgs and spiders and what not have for MANY YEARS lived peacefully in the boughs of the tree but have slowly turned mad... in a Night Elves life time, Teldrassil is a twig planted yesterday.
---
It just all feels pretty weird.
---
What is reading comprehension?
---
Sorry TheForbiddenSun but that's just straight up wrong. There's no question that pure enhancement is the fastest in terms of raw levelling and DPME (Damage Per Manage Efficiency) than any of the alternatives. Level 40ish elemental does become viable, but still doesn't beat Enhancement.  
---
The only time to spec ele for BIS speeds is 10-20, then respec enhance.
---
It'll only happen if they add meaningful content to classic. And I don't mean adding a server for BC, if you're going to do it go all the way.
---
Congratulations!
---
Yea dude, once they hit 5 like mine, you are in it until they are asleep. And if you try to play while they're like watching something or whatever, be prepared to answer every little question about the game. Parenting is really amazing though, exhausting but rewarding and honestly easier than I thought it was gonna be(at least so far), anyways best of luck dude, hope your kid is healthy and you hit 60 before AQ.
---
For me, I liked the newborn time as well. Now he's 3 and I'm loving it. The only period that I really resented, was when he was old enough to crawl, but not crawl by himself. And when he was old enough to walk, but not walk by himself. My kid has always been hyper active and he just wouldn't ever be still.
---
If it's popular I would bet a lot of the younger crowd will play even if it's just to be a part of the cool crowd for a bit.
---
I couldn't care less about what exact name I get and don't understand why people are so interested in it (but nothing wrong with that of course) my friends and I will definitely not bother to reserve a name and I am someone from this community here. Just to give you another perspective. I don't think that many people care to claim their names tbh
---
I’m 25 and I couldn’t imagine being that responsible 3 years ago
---
I am still not sure what  to play. Perhaps you guys can help me out. I played Hunter and Shaman in vanilla and mained to Paladin in tbc. I  also leveled druid, dk, priest and warlock to max level util i quit half way through cata. But my main was always my Paladin because i loved the diversity of being able to tank and do dps (Never really was into  healing). 
---
Definitively not going to play: Shaman, Paladin (because of Horde and i think Pally is trash in  vanilla because it only can heal and is useless for tanking and dpsing), druid
---
Probably not: Mage, Warlock
---
Undecided between: Warrior, Rogue, Hunter, Priest
---
First i thougt okay i think warrior will fit best because of the  diversity. But i‘m going to play really casually this time around and  warrior will be very gear dependent (and gear equals Time) also it will  be trash in wpvp without heals and i probably wont have them as i play  with a friend who is going mage. 
---
As for the priest i really like the diversity. But i feel like being forced to heal all the time and not being able to collect decent shadow gear. Is there any "healing spec" that also can do decent damage in pvp?
---
Looking at the hunter i really like the ability to solo Farm and be less gear dependend. But on the other hand i am not sure about leeway, traps and the bad pve damage. Also only dps role
---
Rouge is really strong in wpvp and but not so in bgs as you rely on your cooldowns. Also highly populated and not so much needed and wanted in Dungeons and group play. (+ respecs needed when switching between pvp and pve content)
---
My Main goals come Classic are wpvp, bgs, and doing stuff in the  world as well as 5 man dungeons. Perhaps some causal raiding but not  sure about that. I will only be able to play arround about 10 hours per  week (After nolifeing the release week) but still want to be competitve  as far as possible in bgs and wpvp without the best gear. I also want to be useful in groups as my time is limited and i don´t want to spend my 2 hours of daily gametime in lfg. Leveling speed and difficulty are not an issue for me as i enjoy leveling and am quite expirienced with that. 
---
What class should i play? Also sry for all the mistakes as i am not a native speaker
---
Idk why you put "toon" in quotes, but it is a very common and normal way to refer to a character in WoW. It originated from the word "cartoon", and has been around since Vanilla. Maybe it isn't used as often anymore and so newer people don't recognize it.
---
&gt; Night elves were introduced to the Warcraft franchise by an orc warrior (Grom) talking about their unmatched savagery. 
---
The same as horde propaganda about baby raptors getting corrupted by vicious alliance, vicious alliance purposefully making Taurajo civilians flee into quilboar teritorry, and the stuff with alliance commander that ordered this?
---
For me atleast, 8.1 had me stick around for almost a week, 8.2 is shaping up to me much better as I've still got tons to do almost one month in.
---
Honestly thinking about what I wanted to say it's stuff you've all heard before.
---
That said, if I were to magically decide your class *for my own benefit* (despite the fact that we're probably not gonna be on the same realm) I'd say Warlock. If a Lock is able to take full advantage of his out-of-combat kit, I'd rather have him on speed dial than a mage.
---
Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
---
Get an owl, you will not be disappointed (yes making the trip as Horde is worth it). Also Druid and Hunters are incredible leveling partners and level fast as hell solo as well. The best leveling partner as a Hunter that I found was Frost mages imo.
---
They *delayed the* ***stress test*** *indefiniately?!?!*
---
Well now I \*know\* you're right! It's just so clear!
---
WARCRAFT IS BACK
---
Only active subs? I reclaimed my old account but haven't out any game time in it since then but am also broke. I would love to log on my old character are you telling me I can maybe do that?
---
I am pretty sure you could clear all raids with all the dps in the raids playing a meme specc. Which, by definition would make all of them viable. It would not be optimal though.
---
Schfourteen-teen
---
Maybe put WoW or something to? Classic could mean a lot off stuff, they might not understand the font.
---
The pride though you feel when you calm them down singing a song and some gentle rocking, theres nothing like it.
---
I would activate my account on the 13th for a name reservation except that I have no desire to play retail so I just don't feel like wasting half a months sub just for names. I imagine a lot of others feel the same.
---
Weird i dont remember having any issues in BFA launch. Last launch I remember that i remember had issues was WoD because a bugged quest to start garrisons.
---
Really good post. I was considering running 1h+shield after I get thrash blade but I think you made good points for Retribution instead. I didn't know about SotC bug which is crazy, so I'll never be using that. I 100% agree with everything else you said, especially consecration. Boggles my mind how many paladins think it's "the rogue killer", even though good rogues can still incap you between pulses lmao. I also checked the seal twisting comment you linked and that throws so many guides out of the window, I always thought you can seal twist because judgement is off the GCD so you don't lose dps.
---
Thanks again dude, I'll probably roll this build all the way to 60 to do some slight BG pvp (follow an Arms warrior around) and pve (get prebis holy gear and rock MC).

Hamstring kiting if done 100 percent perfectly will result in lower dps than fighting toe to toe with a mob in the same gear.
---
This is why Jagex will never be Blizzard.
---
Blizzard didn't give a date when Classic was announced because billion dollar companies know that it's better to under-promise and over-deliver than over-promise and under-deliver. Now that they have given us a date, it's 100% going to come out on the 27th.

Since weapons can swap whenever you can technically macro all your abilities to swap to 2h and then swap back to auto with dual wield.

I think you misunderstood OP. He/she is talking about 32" *ultrawide* at 1440p (3440x1440), not a regular 32" 16:9 monitor. They're measured diagonally so the higher number doesn't mean it has a taller panel, just that the screen area is larger.
---
The pixel density is pretty much identical between the two, fractionally higher on the 32 inch panel compared to the 27" 16:9 panel, but effectively the same. Both have 1440 vertical pixels and are almost identical heights. Just think of a 32" Ultrawide as a stretched out 27" monitor with additional horizontal pixels to match the extra width.
---
1. Is Elemental then worse off, better off, or just the same as casters in general with low gear? (don't worry about a detailed explanation, this is the spec I'm more or less going to play, just curious)
---
2. Assuming two things: A) I don't like mages and B) I won't do anything above 5-mans on this alt ; would Rogues be better for pickpocketing/mining in that dungeon/etc. with low gear than hunters, or do hunters have alternative farming options for baby tier gear?

Its not useless but two heals cast at the wrong rank or  0.2 s after another healer are going to have a larger impact then this.  
---
Thjat verses actual additional abilities such as fearward (saying you only need 2-3 is a joke, NEED verses can USE are two different things) Fear ward melee dps and they get to do more damage. It last 10 m so you can start passing them out on your way to fearing bosses. Think big not small.  
---
If you NEVER want to pvp humans are fine (if you hate the look of Dwarves.) But even if you think about some pvp both Dwarf and NE offer far more that 10-15 spirit and 4 damage (its 25% of spirit so 15*0.25 =3.75 spell/healing power; mind you this is before the coefficient and typically will be 0-3 extra healing or damage).

They're better off as raid heals for that sweet, sweet chain heal. Work fine in any 5 man group though

Thats pretty cool, I had a level 1 twink in goldshire that used to have 1000 hp but now all of the enchants have been nerfed. I have mageweave bandages and ramsey's black label that used to give a stam bonus. Just logged on to him a week ago.. haha

Assuming you are in a hurry to level in which case dont do tradeskills at all

Both are good for PvP, but if you plan to DPS in raids at any point, go Orc or you will regret it. 5 Weapon skill is absolutely nuts, and Blood Fury is like a free trinket.

Yes they do.  Wand is a big deal on casters, but I would not spend more then a few minutes on it, especially if you have someone else you can kind of rely on.  Getting ahead of the zerg and out of the starter area is my #1 day 1 concern.  
---
Optimal route is gonna change a lot based on how congested the server is.  No matter what 1-5 is going to be a shitshow.  I have tried a couple of starter zones on private server launches and UD is one of the worst.  In particular the quest for undead to get 12 scarlet armbands is probably impossible.  When I did it I was able to do that first set of gnoll based quests, but was constantly fighting for spawns.  Brill seemed too loaded so I left for razor hill around 7, but lower durator was maybe worse then brill.  I just grinded harpies from 7 to 10, and at least there didn't have to wait for spawns, by the time I got to cross roads I was ahead of the wave of people who waited for quests NPCs to repop.
---
Mage and Warlock have pretty good robes from Tailoring, but that's pretty much it.
---
Aff while leveling is more about sustain than control.  That and multi target damage.
---
thats the opposite of what ive heard talking to top vanilla pvpers, they say that elemental shamans in pvp are the strongest early game due to their insane burst potential and frost shock spamming since everyone they fight is gonna have minimal HP due to gear.
---
I don’t agree, 
---
What’s the point in adding new content if we don’t advance new levels? How do we deal with having 10 raids? You can only add so much stats to gear before you just flat out get to the point where XYZ content is useless because you can craft ABC and it’s all lvl 60 gear with ABC being 100x more powerful. 
---
How would we add new spells and attacks? Or skill tree options? 
---
Plus adding new stories and quests without gaining exp just feels wasted on the player.
---
And if we split the community between classic and TBC how is that going to work? It’s going to dilute the population, do new players who want to go to TBC just get a fresh lvl 60? 
---
Also if the devs were to go about and make new content, they will need a buffer, content is not made over night, it takes years for them to plan, draw, code, test, voice, animate, all that Jazz.

Real hardware is cheaper *by far* if you have the facilities, electrical system capacity, people and processes to manage licenses, system admins, patch acceptance processes, etc, etc, etc. The cost of having your own hardware isn't in the hardware, it's in managing and maintaining it.

The HE/BE were supposed to make up around 200k before Arthas happened. With 90% ending up killed and of that remaining 10% 8 became the BE. Though the HE were supposed to be a small part of the elves that refused to accept the enforced rule to live without the use of arcane magic.

Wc3 lore wise they hold the entire north of Kalimdor and live side by side with various other creatures. Similar to Warhammer woodelves they hunt intruders as tribal/religious(elune) savages - minus the xenovore aspect. Their armies got hit the least by the demons marching on the world tree. They've lost their world tree bound immortality. But that's all there is in terms of weakening an army that stood against the legion - twice - and has soldiers with more than 10.000 years of experience.
---
So the orcs didn't get much done until metzen started the go team green rampage in cataclysm. Initially the orc clans moving to Kalimdor where the leftovers of the survivors of the 2nd war - the part that didn't die in the labor camps. They had less than a generation between that time and the start of WoW's timeline. So not much time to breed a new army.
---
Yet come Cataclysm - all of a sudden the orcs could push the NE back instead of getting slaughtered for their attempts to lumber. (the inspiration for Warsong and Ashenvale's original design around the boarders to the barrens)
---
To put some perspective into the NE vs Orc comparison. Orcs were stronger when the demon blood fueled them with rage and strength. They only have that as minor leftovers now, but without the demons controlling them to fight on with no remorse or fear. Meanwhile you have 10.000 year old seasoned veterans that fought real demons and not just demonic empowered mortals. Not to mention the Demi-Gods that fight with the NE to protect their forests.
---
I'd even dare to say that crafting and rep grinding was the true endgame for non-guilded players.  That an alts.
---
Private servers...I mean, just stop with this shit.
---
Also, this is NOT a bug, but an exploit.
---
Can you do it Classic? The way how raid lockouts work, yes, you can.
---
Will people do it? ABSOLUTELY NOT.
---
And I will give you the reasons : 
---
First, if they do it, Blizzard will fix it. 
---
Secondly, you cannot ask people to drop the raid "this time", and next time is their turn. 
---
Third, Ony World Buff is on a 6 hr CD. Farming the heads in Classic is irrelevant. It isn't on pservers. you can wipe 6 times, and use 6 heads, no biggie (main reason, among other, why Druids and Fury tank meta works).
---
Fourth, this exploit is well known (or at least known already), and the risk of getting banned by Blizzard is SKY HIGH.
---
You can't just fucking come with pservers examples...because those examples are IRRELEVANT for a multitude of reasons.
---
Classic will be a BLIZZARD game, with EVERYTHING that derives from that : 30 DAYS or longer bans INCLUDED.
---
HEY GUYS JUST FOUND MY MAGE FROM CLASSIC WOW BACK WHEN I TOTALLY PLAYED TAKE A [LOOK](https://classicguides.app/content/images/size/w2000/2018/07/mage.jpg)
---
I'm not saying you die once per level, I'm saying being heal spec prevents you from dying. I think it would be very optimistic to say once per level. It's quite possible being heal spec causes you to die more each level, because you have such trouble killing things.
---
It was fun and gave you something else to do / grind for.
---
Have you watched any streams of dungeons in the beta? DPS can tank mobs just fine. They  can take 10+ hits
---
Couldn't this just be fixed by not allowing the raid to release until the encounter finishes like in retail?
---
I'm 100% convinced classic will surpass BFA wow. Win/win for Blizz of course.
---
Which third party owns/controls/operates your home PC or remote PC? As far as I can see I'm the only party involved.
---
&gt;drink in safety (very usefull in bg and world pvp)
---
You can actually use this while fighting people. Fear run away get out of combat sm/drink/eat theyll run up fight again. and you can do it on your next fear as well. Now if later and they have a tricket thats different . You can MC them away from you and do this at times also.
---
You're absolutely right, and OP was indeed referring to a 16:9 monitor. My bad, I feel like a huge idiot 😂
---
Oopsy
---
They didn’t balance classes around raids. They balanced around group content. You’ll notice that all specs are quite viable in group content. 5% of the playerbase raised in Vanilla (an unbelievable number, I know). Why would they damage the experience of 95% to benefit a subset of the 5%? Seems like a bad choice to me. Their goal for raid class balancing was to make each class desirable, not each spec. Which class is completely undesirable? This is also why they designed class sets and items towards the most played specs. They wanted to make sure each class was still getting invited. Going into TBC, the focus shifted towards raiding more, and the directive became to get all specs desirable, or at least have each class be able to fill the role it wanted. Seems like the succeeded there, though I know less about BC raiding.
---
Since BC, the game has shifted ever more focus onto raiding and end game content. This is why our current paradigm is to view classes as imbalanced or even broken if they don’t perform equally in raids.
---
All of the reasons I was planning on it :), thank you for your answer Hox. I was a bit worried it'd be slower.
---
Also, in general would just having a mage instead of a warlock increase our speed? IE:Portals, and mana food? Or is it not that much of a difference?
---
That definitely isn't pretty much it
---
Shouldn’t have any issues playing the AH remotely through a program such as teamviewer  if that’s all you’re looking to do.
---
No greys before level 20 except for weapons vendor for over 3 silver. Most armor is 1s and change. 
---
Beasts will make up the largest amount of naturally encountered (through questing) mobs. If you want to go out of your way to farm humanoids for grey drops, you can make some money sure, but you'll be slowly yourself down by doing so (outside of a few solid farming spots).
---
oh noes 6-12 months till AQ gets released and some people will get T2 faster
---
It's not like MC won't be cleared within the first week and roflstomped every ID
---
If you are rogue or hunter farming devilsaur leather and making the set, or just selling the leather, is super profitable
---
What other professions have end-game BoP gear?
---
From the info you've provided - I would say hunter would suit you best. You will love the quality of life that being a hunter involves. They are fantastic at Wpvp/BG's and have a very niche playstyle. If you believe you can manage your pet in dungeons hunter could definitely be the choice for you. They do good damage and only really fall off in later expansions (still a good hunter will beat a bad rogue etc). Considering your play time I would definitely say hunter - the only issue is if there is the elitist attitude at 60 that only mage/warrior/rogue should dps.
---
You mean mage and priest.  The warlock robes were barely better than the blue recipe.
---
Tailoring was important for warlock for the bloodvine cloth set from ZG.
---
I’m going to look for one that says “low pop” and login to that..
---
Arenas aren't the problem it's balancing around arenas. That was something that tbc got the ball rolling on but didn't happen all at once.
---
no hybrids deal to much damage and have to small mana pool to use their other abilities in tbc imo
---
Your ISP streaming the game outside your home is the third party.
---
It just means one less person in your guild needs it, and you are closer to getting one yourself.
---
Good, no denifinite timeline gives them a chance to work out the bugs even further. I really feel (hope) they are doing this right!
---
I vaguely remember a thing called "cascading" in vanilla. Basically it was guilds saving multiple alts to different raid locks so that they could run the raid several times in 1 week. I remember a lot of guilds getting a ban for it too. Though it could just be my 15 year old brain not understanding it completely at the time.
---
Agreed. Loved oldschool RS as the regular version was filled to the brim with what seemed to be like filler content. Releasing NEW level 60 content to WOW classic would be a great idea.
---
Think of the bags $_$
---
swingtimer reset on weapon swap
---
enforced 1,5 sec gcd on weapon swap as well
---
doubt that it will be all that viable
---
Well I haven't exactly starting working out yet :/
---
Crafting was never required, and not necessary. But you'd be foolish not to do something. At least herbalism and skinning to make gold.
---
Seems pretty odd to base your build around an item with a 20 min cd.
---
Yes, as someone who's more concerned about getting a well established toon ASAP (60, 2 professions near 300, epic mount, pre-BIS etc), than just getting to 60 ASAP, I think it will be much faster overall to level professions as I level my toon.
---
Going back to compete with all the still-leveling casuals sounds like hell, even with a 60 mount (which will be very tough to afford without leveled profs).
---
Engineering would give you the good bullets/arrows and you can make them yourself.
---
You are misinterpreting the post. Read it all, again.  You get 1 hit from the special condition of having 10 or less weapon skill diff to boss, but you still get  the hit you normally get from weap skill as well.
---
we may never know
---
There's million ways to fix it really the concern is that it's technically blizzlike so some might want to keep it. I really hope it doesn't stay though.
---
R10 is super easy. R13 is near impossible for the average player.
---
Razorgore would be doable, but vael would be impossible without already having good gear.
---
Lmfao, I've had this game.  People like you are sad.
---
I’ve pretty much decided I would like to play the most support/utility focused NON-healer that is also hopefully the most satisfying mechanically to group PvE, PvP, and solo level/farm. I’ve always enjoying a healer, but have never liked dealing with multiple sets of gear, respeccing a lot, not being very competent solo, etc. What I really like is providing support, which thankfully in Classic, means a lot more than just HPS.
---
Right now Warlock feels like the best middle ground. They offer so much utility and can really be a DPS backbone, have interesting spec variety, and PvP is incredibly involved with managing pets, getting Nightfall burst procs and stuff. Feels quite fun. Nothing really beats the gratification of a huge mage AoE solo farm, but otherwise, mechanically, I don’t think mage floats my boat as much as warlock.
---
Rogue is also very mechanically fun, but offers hardly anything to anyone besides myself and my performance. Hunter is in the same boat. Incredibly self-sufficient but doesn’t offer THAT much to a group and I also generally dislike the PvP style. Warrior is still on the table in a way since being an exceptional tank is arguably the best support you can provide, but again, they suffer a lot in a solo context, and the respeccing / gear management can all be extremely taxing.
---
Anyone else feel this way about “support”? For me, at this point it’s looking like I’ll have a Warlock main, with a Warrior tank alt and a Priest/Paladin healer alt.
---
&gt; I am pretty sure you could clear all raids with all the dps in the raids playing a meme specc.
---
Doubtful. On progression, with everyone undergeared you'd hit some serious roadblocks, like Vael in BWL for example. I'd really like to hear how Vael would go without Frost/Fire Mages, Fury/Arms Warriors, Warlocks, Rogues, or Hunters.
---
We're talking about DPS being all Boomkins, Ele/Enh Shamans, Arcane Mages, more than one Shadow Priest, possibly a few Smite priests, Rets and Feral Druids.
---
Why no Rogues or Hunters? Rogues don't really have a meme-spec (unless you count full PvP-Sub as a meme-spec, I guess.) 
---
Hunters don't have meme-specs (although Survival underperforms until Naxx-gear.) That's because Hunters aren't brought for their DPS to begin with. They're strictly kiters/Tranq-bots.
---
Bringing *only* a mish-mash of undergeared meme-specs as the DPS contingent is absolutely not viable because at a certain point they're going to hit roadblocks through which they cannot mathematically proceed. 
---
If you replaced most of them with Frost Mages, Fury Warriors, and Warlocks/Rogues then yeah, that Smite Priest and that Ele Shaman could get carried, but that's not what most people mean when they say something is *viable.*
---
Using inner focus to cast one spell is worse than not using inner focus to cast all your spells
---
Perfection
---
1. We have no idea.
---
2. Not sure what you mean since there is no way to actually tell faction bias, so you are picking PvE, PvP, or RP-PvE. No, the names will not be what causes faction imbalance.
---
3. Guild leader is picking.
---
Not looking forward to having a child after reading this
---
I don't know what to tell you other then their burst scales faster then players HP pool does across the board in vanilla.  There is a reason they buffed HP per stam and introduced resilence in TBC.  Late vanilla pvp is very burst heavy compared to early vanilla pvp.  
---
Also shamans generally lack mana efficiency compared to say a mage or paladin, so early gear where they have lower spell power they tend to spend a lot of mana to get a kill, or perhaps their early gear is missing some int on some pieces.  This makes it quite difficult for a shaman to play fully as a hybrid, off-healing, purging, etc, is expensive and they tend to struggle to have enough gas in the tank at the end of a group fight.
---
Even better...yeet b4 u skeet
---
Skinning is okayish but yeah basically.  Though for 99% of people I would say hurrying is pointless.
---
Welcome to retail wow past patch 3.2/3
---
Hopefully classic is a huge success and they either start modeling modern wow after it or redo the progress of expansions in classic with all the "hallow" additions cut out.
---
Oh what a fail. I got the am confused with blizzard.
---
only if you take your shield off, equip an offhand, and get parry gibbed.
---
I sure hope it is a development on top of classic rather than just re-hashing the expansions.  TBC was great because it felt like a lot of vanilla’s flaws were polished, but it was also a progression reset and it made all the previous content irrelevant and it was the first step towards where retail is today.
---
I don’t want to finally have an empty nest, settle down and boot up classic only for it to be at BfA.  (Retirement is still a little far off for this goal...)
---
What a strange thought!
---
Hahaha that would be funny as hell.
---
So if we got a server called Goldshire.... you think it wouldn’t end up alliance sided? You think at launch enough horde players would pick that?
---
Negative. R1 FB and imp coc is all you need.
---
Maybe you could gain a different kind of exp. Same world new events and stories, new grinds, "secret boss" dungeons you have to work for to get to. Events and storylines: have the horde take over ironforge and vice versa. Terrible idea? Maybe... terribly brilliant :^}
---
Also, vanilla only lasted a bit over two years. I think most people won't really want to play it much longer than that. Someone will disagree here but I only said most, not all. I think there will be enough players for a couple classic servers for years and years.
---
I mean, you can get the recipe for truefaith out of a dungeon and... just wow.
---
Realistically the decision to backport your game is pretty foolish. They might have underestimated just how many issues would arise. For example, the fact that the game was using legion weapon special attack normalization instead of the proper vanilla ones, and the fact that it took so long into the beta to recognize it, is really worrying. There could be so many other errors going on with the combat formulas under the hood that us as players never get to see and therefore wouldn't be able to recognize.
---
Surely they wont miss the launch. Alot of us are taking vacations to be tourists.

Think they are talking about truefaith.

You can't say that without knowing how many pvp active people there will be on his server.

Walking backwards avoids leeway though doesn't it?

Because you won't get someone to sit in a 26 second trap because of heart beat resists. This isn't retail where it's just DR and that's all you have to worry about. Every server tick you have a chance to come out of those long lasting cc.  
---
What he's saying is on average a non dr'd trap will last 15 seconds even though the actual duration says 26 seconds. And that a dr'd trap will last 13. Because of heart beat resists you can't have someone sit in that 26 second trap.

What class is easiest to master in PvP? Paladin
---
What class is hardest to master in PvP? This is a very difficult and subjective question, but probably druid or shaman I think.

What class is easiest to master in PvE? Mage

What class is hardest to master in PvE? Also a bit subjective, but for truly mastering I'd vote warrior that plays both DPS and tank, or druid for similar reasons.

This is what you get when you cant smack some sense into your kid.

They're far too expensive to make them worth it compared to Robes of the Exalted.
---
Slow 2h weapons rockbiter is actually much better and on 1 handers WF is typically &gt; FT.
---
Thje reason for this is 2-h WF overkills too much Rockbiter is very consistent and scales very well with slow weapons.
---
As Overkill damage with faster weapon is less of an issue this typically pushes WF above the rest for 1-h (FT is still good, but more mobs have higher fire resist than significant armor as well.)
---
I would be way more hyped if they didn't even do Vanilla and started with BC lol ngl
---
Ya dude it wasn't canceled it was "delayed". Don't get me wrong it could get canceled, and that would be funny.
---
They said the next one is, I'm asking for a day around the week before launch for the rest of the world to be able to download the client early and setup addons so we are not all screwed behind the Beta testers having a huge unfair advantage. 
---
They are doing name lockins on August 13th so somewhere right around there would be good. Just so we can all be on the same playing field.
---
That first MC clear.  Watching that hammer fly down and smash into the ground...

Whoo.  Better than a newborn thats for fuckin sure 😂

This post is the opposite to what it should have said. WoW is a GAME, look after your family in every instance as an absolutely priority and bond with your newborn in the most important bonding period you'll ever have.
---
By your numbers at $20/subscription that's 40M or 0.064% of 2018 revenues from subscriptions. If classic brings in 500k new subs would be less than 2% increase in (recurring) revenues bc subs are less than $20 on avg.
---
The majority of PreBiS Druid Resto gear drops in BRD.
---
They literally say they'll have a more definite date later. Lacking a clear expression of timeframe is the very definition of 'indefinite'; we have been given no time frame for when/if the test will be rescheduled.      
---
         
---
However, I think you can make a case that a stress test *after* release is nonsensical, and the reason for the cancellation being the need for more time to work rules out an earlier date. Therefore there is a definite time interval between the original stress test date and the release of the game that it must occur within. I wouldn't argue with that.          
---
          
---
Outside of my conspiracy theory, it wouldn't surprise me at all for them to cancel the last stress test completely within the next week or two. After all, how much iteration and prep can they do if the stress test is pushed until early August and they have fewer than two/three weeks to make modifications for release?
---
That would be quite hard to do considering you'd have to use completely different addons and macros.
---
That is unlikely.
---
Babies are gross.
---
Not the same client at all. Private server client is the old 1.12 client. Classic runs on the current BFA Client and I doubt the addons operate the same on the different client.

If the option to migrate to TBC is optional, I'm all for it.

It's got a long CD but it's a situational item you don't just use whenever it's off CD, especially in wPVP or AV.
---
no offense man but real "traders" don't post their ideas on reddit and you specifically don't have a Bloomberg terminal. I know plenty of real traders that only use a terminal to move size (until they got Aladdin), not for the "research". I get it, you use the one at work, I did too. I suggest Marketsmith, it's not Bloomberg but if you are into technical and scanners it's well worth the cost.
---
Then you have no mana.
---
Chain heal is great too and very satisfying.
---
Well then there is still the next stress test for you.. not its not canceled just a later date now.
---
Like this 15 minutes wont matter a lot i can tell you. Just one idiot pulling mobs ontop of your aoe or some shit and you get the same timeloss either way.
---
And ohh boy are the retailers stupid
---
His math is very wrong lol
---
Them doing early downloads of the game is very common, almost every launch in the last 5 years they do early downloads to take the load off the servers on launch day. No reason not to squeeze a last minute stress test / addon day in there as well.
---
Did you have much luck dueling shadow priests and warlocks?
---
&gt;Your anecdotal un-verifiable report of experiences that run counter to every other person who actually plays feral and records the experience of actually tanking said bosses that are "impossible" to tank? pass.
---
Oh I'm sorry, you have better sources? Please, show them to me. I'd love to hear all these verifiable reports from many people who play Feral claiming that Feral is a fantastic viable main tank for progression, which is a direct counter to my supposedly worthless anecdotal experience. Why don't you begin with that, and then we can address the brick wall of foolish stubbornness that is the rest of your comments. Well.. except for this part:
---
&gt;the only difference between crit and crushing blow is the fact that one can be taken off the combat table with defense-&gt;attack skill differential, crushing blows cannot be removed without CTC cap.

Please have a read.
---
So why was the first stress test literally impossible to play with only a small number of select individuals invited?
---
Why was BFA impossible to play for much of the first 2 days?
---
I mean I obviously think to much and personally ide like to join an even populated pvp server so ide sway more towards a server name that is the location of key pvp and neither horde or alliance sided , maybe something like “Arathi Highlands” 
---
Or maybe the name of a lore specific like a dreadlord xD
---
people on reddit are huge losers just looking for a stronger fix for their internet addictions
---
I can show you my B-unit :)
---
5+ axes, not any weapon. Important to note.
---
That being said there are some pretty sweet endgame axes.
---
Not too bad, it will only take 12hrs to make them all (minus the interruptions from throwing one every minute). Brb, off to find an anvil...
---
People are getting banned from Blizzard games because of things they say in social media.
---
100% right, it's a dungeon crawler with a little extra flare and stuff to do, like Diablo+.  That's not the WoW I grew up on and doubtful it's the WoW many of us here grew up on.
---
Your comment is
---
This can also be done to get multiple chances at garr or baron bindings
---
Priest or possibly druid should be just as fine. depends on what you prefer
---
Reflection gives you 15% mana regen while casting. What does it have to do with being in a form? Typically you don't take it any build except for raid healing.
---
Do you know about frontloading your mana?
---
find a 3 sided dice :P
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
My druids share more kinship with Tauren druids than other alliance. If I see an alliance ganking or corpse camping a horde druid I see to it that they stop.
---
I'm agreeing that they'd release a buggy game before they'd miss a release schedule, because they just did it with BFA?
---
Thankfully I know exactly the race, class and spec that I will have as my main: Human Protection Warrior.
---
What I am unsure of, is which professions to use as I level. In Vanilla, I was an herbalist and alchemist (Due to being a raider and flasks being a necessity not only for myself, but to curry favor with healers I would bribe them as well.). For this go around, I was thinking of leveling as a skinner/miner until level 40, selling all gathered mats, buy a level 40 mount and switch back to herbalism/alchemy since I can move around faster. I plan on going back to starting zones until the herb/alc are at the current level and finishing my way to 60 that way.
---
Now, I leveled in Vanilla as protection and never once switched to arms/fury even for PVP S's &amp; G's. I don't recall the leveling grind being that bad, but can someone who remembers this a bit more vividly (a protection warrior who raids tends to drink heavily) remind me if I am subjecting myself to torture? I just love tanking even at lower levels. Can't get enough of it.
---
Pro tip: When your baby is 3-12 months old, you can put that baby in a sling on your chest, facing out. The bright colors and action on your screen will hypnotize that baby. My brother was born in 05 and I used to do this when I had to take care of him. 
---
14 years down the road and he will have the chance to enjoy WoW again, but as a player.
---
i've already taken time off so that would be a real kick in the nuts
---
Casual
---
I take it all mana regen is disabled while casting?
---
Blizzard became lazy when WoW blew up.  They didn't release another game until 2010 when before then, they released a game nearly every 2 years.
---
ONY IS WOTLK
---
Osrs has a slump after launch until they finally got the GE back because well OSRS without GE is a lot less fun.
---
No you did not predict its downfall. Like I said, wow is still going strongly today. You are one of those that been saying wow will die since it’s first expansion.  First, does take a seer to ‘predict’ that every game will reduce its popularity over time, so don’t pay yourself on the back so quickly. However, 15 years since its release, it’s still going strongly, so downfall is hugely overstated. Granted with those ridiculous numbers as before,  but mmo has lasted 15 years and still stayed this relevant?
---
Castspellbyname doesn’t work does it?
---
I played retail wow for the past year, as Guardian (Bear) Druid.  I will def play Feral (Tank) druid in Classic.  I *could* play warrior, but my heart is with the druid.   Here are my thoughts-concerns.
---
**Weaknesses of Retail Experience:**
---
* The retail community is not super-hyped to be there.  People play, but they typically don't love what they are doing.
---
* The "LFR" feel.  I join a mythic+ dungeon and never see those folks again.  I have a couple friends I run with, but based on time-zones, PuGs are more common.  \[A mythic+ dungeon is where the dungeon run is made more difficult based on the last rank you completed, and it's timed.  You are more likely (personally) to get a piece of loot if you finish on-time).
---
* I hope that the community excitement makes up for my class being a bit...basic (see below).
---
**Strengths of Retail:**
---
&gt;In classic, it will be "Brown bear."  I do genuinely get the "I am just a random, humble adventurer" appeal, but it's nice to have a nice-looking lore-bear.  *What if Tier 0.5, Tier1, Tier 2, Tier 2.5, and Tier 3 all looked the same for warriors?*  That could get pretty boring.  I enjoy bear-diversity.  In Retail I change my bear every few dungeons for a different feel.
---
Yeah, definitely...  Different looks for druid forms should've been in the game from the start, if you ask me... Why do warriors paladina get to wear this cool spiky high-fantasy plate set, when druid bears just look like a regular bear? Hell, Dire bear form BEARLY looks different from regular bear... 
---
&gt;My rotation:  Even though bear is seen as the most boring rotation in retail, I still have three good defensives, about 4 different damaging abilities, a near-100% uptime-able armor boost, which makes me feel strong.  Said buff only lasts 8 seconds, and you can stack charges depending on rage, so it's sort of fun to manage, and if I am rolling 3 stacks of ironfur I feel Godlike for a few seconds.
---
Well, yeah... Retail's classes are designed to have satisfying rotations... That's why we have much less skills/spells available, but the ones we have are way more interconnected and satisfying in tandem within each spec. I love my frost mage spell loop in retail, and can't say i'm excited to spamming just frostbolt with the odd blizzard for aoe fights in raids. I'm definitely not coming for the gameplay xD. In classic, they designed abilites that made sense for the class first and foremost, with thoughts of balance and synergy om the backburner, which is why we have some weird abilities in there that don't really see much use. In retail, they designed a satisfying combat-loop first and foremost.
---
 &gt;Mythic+ Dungeons.  I don't have time to raid, sadly, but by pushing myself and playing at a high level, I can attain almost-mythic-raid tier gear.  This is not "free entitled loot," I have had to study these instances and watch streams to get where I'm at.   Is it stressful when a new "season"/raid tier opens, to have to re-gear?  Sure, but even in classic, won't we always be in some process of seeking new gear?
---
If anything, I like the fact that there are many ways to attain high level gear. Why should raiding be the only way to achieve end-game quality stuff? I love raiding, but I think having more ways to play that require some work pit in and actually have a worthwhile reward should be encouraged.
---
Bis weapons
---
Pallies are great 5 man tanks.
---
I don't know much about retail. Why is it for 1 min every 30?
---
Skull of impending doom. It's a low level offhand item that gives you a sprint in exchange for a dot that gives you damage. It's good for flag carry or breaking CC. There are a handful of pvp trinkets, weapons, and consumables that are 100% required. The game revolves around having a bag full of trinkets to swap around. There's a million youtube videos on where to get them.
---
If you're going to go full Prot PvE-farming build then you're should commit to pulling 5+ mobs, in which case *Consecration* actually becomes a priority. Actually, any source of reactive AoE damage becomes a priority because you will be getting hit—*a lot.*
---
[11/33/7](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0zZVGxI0zEoVb) This is pretty much the optimal AoE-Farming/Tanking build. For maximum synergy, you should always be using Blessing of Sanctuary—so skip Blessing of Kings because you can't have more than one Blessing on you. You don't need Imp. HoJ either.
---
Finally, attach shield spikes to your shield, since that will be a huge source of passive AoE damage.
---
For the memes, there's a way of making a single-target Tanking build—[0/32/19](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sZVGxI0zyoVf0xMb)—but it adds talents that don't really synergize—such as Conviction—and you have to sacrifice Divine Strength and Intellect, which is huge because Strength increases your amount of shield mitigation. A weird spec, to be sure.
---
You aren't going to have much spirit to make any use of it. There's way better talents for PvP and PvE.
---
Mages (and Paladins I guess) are excellent dungeon farmers as well.
---
Gearing should be pretty similar on all 3 of them. You should get engineering if you aren't married to those profession choices, its great for pve and pvp. All 3 of those choices are good in pvp and pve. I think you should choose the one you think you will have the most fun on man, can't make these kind of decisions for other people.
---
I will give you some fun/cool/useful things about each class though.
---
Mage: Portals/food/water/slowfall/blink
---
Warlock: Enslave demon/infernal/doomguard/soulstone/summoning

Just feels like posting this link and ascribing 'indefinite' to their intentions is insincere reaction baiting. Like you said, there is a period in which this test *will* happen-- They have no stated intention of delaying launch.
---
Assuming we will get server names/name reservation 2 weeks prior to launch, there is still a 2 week period in which this stress test can happen-- With the delay, I wouldn't be at all surprised for them to say "Stress test server going up, reserve your character names, all characters will be reset to 1 for game launch".
---
I do, however, think this stress test will be the most important one. I've been guessing since the second, which included *anyone* with an active sub, that this third one would be *unrestricted*, allowing anyone to hop on for the 2-3 day period. I don't think they will cancel it, because it is absolutely the most important test, giving the best gauge of how many people are interested in Classic, and a good estimate of day 1 server load.
---
I think it boils down to one simple question: 
---
Win mirror matchups? Undead
---
Increase your chances vs Warrior/Rogue? Orc.
---
Aesthetically I think Orc Male &amp; NE Female both have great animations.
---
That's the Goblin racial. They summon a bank NPC for 1 minute and it has a 30 minute cooldown.
---
I mean yeah it could definitely, I dunno how viable that is, onyxia is a really easy place to abuse this, but I'm sure it could be done other places
---
Kodo looks like a quadbike from behind.
---
 &gt;busted my ass to upgrade the catchup gear 
---
so, maxed Benthic in like 2 weeks?
---
feel like making an awkward/awesome meme
---
What do you mean by listing underperforming raid specs?
---
I had to check several posts to be sure, so honor my memory, but it's a lot of hentai of people or things or tentacles in vaginas, possibly specifically pregnant women's vaginas.
---
You're welcome.
---
Your faction ornament seems to turned to 'Horde' for: Scoliosis and Halitosis ridden faction. It needs to be turned to 'Alliance' for: Mostly height challenged faction.
---
Hope to find many to pocket heal. Thanks for reply
---
The low level still has to tag the mobs.
---
1. Better off for burst damage, worse off for running out of mana
---
Counterpoint: Death Coil
---
A 30/0/21 ele-resto shaman build is decent solo, PvP and healing for 5/10/20 mans, but nobody will want you in a 40 man. The spec below is a PvP elemental tree and a PvE resto tree, as a pure PvPer would take Healing Focus &amp; Tidal Mastery over Tidal Focus &amp; Restorative Totems, as a PvP prioritizes dps over mana regen, while PvE is the opposite.
---
You wouldn't raid with this spec as a raid wants your totems for other party members, and the spec just doesn't have the right totems.
---

---
In a caster group, they need Mana Tide, which essentially means 31 in resto. Below is a PvP version of it that's good enough for non-tank raid healing.
---

---
In a melee group, they need Improved Weapon Totem, which essentially means 22 in enhancement + 21 in resto (for Nature's Swiftness). In a tank group, they'd want a shaman with both Improved Weapon Totem &amp; Healing Way, which means 22 in enhancement + 24 in resto. The version below is for both melee &amp; tank healing.

&gt; Have the low level pull (with threat)
---
I was 15, I had a permission slip so I could always leave school grounds at lunch time all school year, remember the day it game out I went down to dixons  in my local town and picked up a copy, was almost to excited to pay attention  in school.
---
Runescape was actually worse. They completely ruined tens of thousands of player accounts that each took thousands of hours to create.
---
I personally had :
---
Near max summoning tank- 2k+ hours
---
Maxed 1 def pure- 2k+ hours
---
Maxed Zerker: 2.5k+ hours
---
Maxed Main: Wasn't ruined, but the game sucked.
---
Several other pures, but those were my crown jewels. I first started playing runescape late 2001 and played until EOC dropped. At the time I was actively playing both WoW and runescape. When they released EoC, Runescape became a shit version of WoW rather than just being Runescape, so I just played WoW.
---
&gt;Secondly, you cannot ask people to drop the raid "this time", and next time is their turn.
---
Sigh... You don't understand how the exploit works... You don't just clear Onyx 1 time. You clear it multiple times. Read some of the other comments explaining it in detail.
---
&gt;Third, Ony World Buff is on a 6 hr CD. Farming the heads in Classic is irrelevant. It isn't on pservers. You can wipe 6 times, use 6 Ony heads for buff, no biggie.
---
Sigh... It's not about the head. It's about the items. A guild using this exploit once, doubles their Onyxia drops for the week. A guild using this exploits two times, triples their Onyxia drops for the week. And repeat, until you clear Onyxia for the last time with the people still not saved, probably with 25 people or so.
---
It's a huge exploit to double, triple, quadruple your weekly Onyxia item drops.
---
Are you forgetting that pretty much everything added since vanilla was highly requested by players? 
---
Everyone wanted flying, people were so hyped about LFG and then LFR etc etc. Wow is such a more complex game than OSRS, there's o way that system would work.
---
Exploiting to increase Onyxia loot by 400% or more is not any shade of grey. It's pitch black.
---
I feel you. I'm playing with 2 friends that are dead set on playing something new and I'm over here just dreaming of my orc rogue and restoring him to his glory, ganking warlocks at 30% hp and calling it a one shot. Also theres a bit of me that genuinely thinks I'm gonna be garbage at anything else. But at the end of the day, I'll be rolling spriest,  new class new experiences. Also about 90% of the fun for me is gonna be world pvp with my friends and honestly if they all wanna roll new stuff, I'm down. I keep telling myself this isnt vanilla, this is classic. I'm gonna play a different game in a whole new way. Whatever you go with, have fun with it. Best of luck on your new journey!
---
No, and it also isn't relevant to my comment. 
---
Allow me to revise the statement. From my experiences in Vanilla, I do not remember DPS being able to tank elite mobs without blowing defensive
---
If you had good spirit you could powershift a bit more. The mana Regen you get isn't exactly spectacular tho. I think you would lose way too many other stats to make that worth it.
---
It eliminates the need to select a target by clicking. So if you’re in a 5 man dung- simply putting your mouse icon over the person who needs a heal, and pushing the spell, is enough..
---
Might not seem like much but probably saves you 1 second each time you heal, makes it easier to change targets in a pinch etc
---
Agree with you there. Was tanking a dungeon the other night and the healer fell off a bridge and died. They were running back and one of the dps initiated a kick which me and another DPS declined. He says what you're friends with this afk? He was so impatient he didn't even realize our healer died and was running back.
---
What I don’t think people understand is that after 2 years of being lvl 60 people do not want to sit around for another 2 years at level 60. And that 2 years is not enough time to get content rolling. It takes months and lots of people to produce simple things, the team that is working on classic already has their hands full getting it to work properly, and they will not be done bug fixing till around the time naxx drops. They don’t have the full WoW team to make new content on demand, if anything there will be a much longer delay in new content unless they can pull huge chunks of the normal team off of retail. A single quest can take weeks by itself. I would be shocked if naxx drops and they announce brand new content coming shortly after. 
---
And gaining other types of exp, what does that mean? Because there is already such a thing, reputation.
---
I actually preferd it without the GE but that was over 10 years ago and I never played OSRS before the implementation so it could just be stubborn nostalgia. It definitely helped my typing ability. *selling raw lobsters 250g ea* a bunch of times per minute lol.
---
It makes it so you don't have to change targets.  You can keep wanding things while you mouseover your group members, raid frames, people in the world, all while keeping whatever target you had.
---
Pretty much all the end game content wasn't tested though.
---
Ya. Ok. Now we're arguint about it being black or dark grey? I said that I think it qualifies as an exploit.
---
I think you read the part where I was saying it wasnt reseting the instance, and thought I was arguing to keep it in the game.
---
They were... *ahem* Not Prepared.
---
I thought I was in the loop. I also have no idea.
---
I didn’t train all of the abilities. For instance I got rank1 Kick but no higher rank. Same with gouge. Only got instant poison.
---
Could you explain how to read that? I’d love to be able to search the database for item effects that do scale with spellpower. Alternatively, if you know of a list somewhere that’s even better!
---
Some of us would prefer BC. With post SWP content.
---
Normally you get 100% of mana regen, if you cast a spell your regen goes to 0% for 5 seconds. Whether you're in form or in combat makes no difference. Technically casting bear form or cat form is a spell, so if you shift to cat form you will have no mana regen for 5 seconds, and than it will return to 100% regen after that.   
---
What the talent does is make your mana regen go to 15% instead of 0%. So you cast cat form and now you will get 15% mana regen for 5 seconds, and then it will return to 100% mana regen.  
---
The talent is not very good. If your normal mana regen rate as a feral druid is 40 mana every 5 seconds, then that means if you cast cat form -&gt; fight you would get (40 * 0.15) extra mana for that fight, which would be a grand total of 6 mana.  
---
The talent becomes better the longer you spend casting things and the more spirit you have - hence why a raid healer would get it. There's really no reason to take it in any pvp or feral focused talent build.
---
You can heal as shadow until MC, it's quite easy to shadow heal in 5mans.
---
Yeah and Hunters spamming Wing Clip are the best Nightfall users, but good luck convincing anyone to do it.
---
You're a good parent
---
“The #nochanges stance doesn’t want one change to lead to twelve...”
---
You should restate the entire argument from the top because it doesn’t read like that at all in this thread. It’s why he said ‘this is the slippery slope fallacy’ - because the logic they enlisted is.
---
Wow glad I resubed to be part of this one!
---
That's a private server macro. Classic uses the same 8.0 API as Retail.
---
Perfect, thanks.
---
How do you expect the game to last 5 years without a single new spell/attack? Remember when (I think it was) Legion dropped and they had removed a number of spells/attacks? A lot of people said that it was making their ability bars and spell book feel empty. That’s the same thing when you play the same class for 5 years with no new abilities added. Every game adds new things over the years.
---
I really don't get the hate. In vanilla once you had an epic mount you could go virtually anywhere in total safety anyway. The only reason to care if other people are skipping content on a flying mount is if your enjoyment of WoW was mostly dependent on being able to gank passers-by.
---
Nah. Once you own a piece of loot, you can do whatever you want with it.
---
Your 15 year old memories aren't  as accurate as you think they are.
---
I think i did maybe 2 hrs a day on LB and it was enough for R10
---
You couldn't even wait a whole week to post this again?
---
Ahhh that explains it then. I couldn't work out how we raided Ony all of Vanilla yet only ever had one rogue T2 helm in the guild.
---
&gt; Classic runs on the current BFA Client
---
Does this mean you need 50-60 GB of hard disk space to be able to play Classic?
---
I had a very different experience, the midwives and doctors spent a lot of time talking to me. Both before and after.
---
Though my boy went straight to the neonatal ICU, and my Mrs's fell asleep after they'd finished her stitches. So I was making a lot of serious decisions alone a lot faster than I expected.
---
So each point of weapon skill reduces your chance to miss. That is how you get hit from weapon skill. Then there is also the 1% added from that special condition outlined in the post.   
---
Here is some hit table confirmation results based on testing on the beta.  
---
 [https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/issues/5)
---
I love that you stated it at the end there. Good stuff lol
---
I haven't subbed yet.  I had the money to do so, but for a couple hours each month?  That's just not something I cared about.  Do it around the same time I'm going to be paying to secure my names and the first days of launch?  That's Drake meme level move.
---
I have 2 mains and 4 alts across both factions and i dont even feel like playing anymore...
---
I understood completely. JerkPlayer is free to do what he wants with Vis'kag, but he must also accept the consequences of being kicked from the guild.
---
Blizzard can’t afford to lose people left right like a private server can. The cost to run a private server is fractions of what it costs blizzard. So when classic winds down to 10k players blizzard will be shutting down parts left and right, while a private server will be happy as hell to have 10k players.
---
 The 3 day gift sub that ends July 29 have nothing to do with this. They are just not ready to test a 15y old game for the third time.
---
They don't need to add abilities to vanilla wow.  We had enough abilities.
---
If they want to make it fresh, they could add more Talent trees and go down a path similar to RIFT: Planes of Telara or Guild Wars 2.  A horizontal progression that gives player classes more variety without increasing their power.
---
Even at higher levels, fury tanking is absolutely viable, and the increase in leveling speed makes fury the best all-rounder spec for speed and versatility pre-60. You can play whatever is most fun to you, however!
---
Gathering professions to 40 are absolutely great (or even to 60 and 60 mount). However, if you plan to MT or OT raid content as a prot warrior at 60, you will need engineering. Getting by without it (especially as an off tank, ESPECIALLY as an off tank dedicated to AoE tanking) is going to be really difficult.
---
That being said, if you are actually coordinated with your guild (which you will be as a tank), they will have people of every profession all working together, and you will be a cog in a machine rather than a survivalist herbalist/alchemist.
---
Basically, play what you like until you can't anymore, then ask your guild how best to help out.
---
&gt;the ability to destroy earlier expac content
---
This has literally always been the case. Shit you can walk into Molten Core with fresh 60's and it's quite doable. When people were doing naxx you could clear BWL and MC in like 2-3hrs. It was a complete joke.
---
I actually do appreciate this comment. That’s true - I do want to make friends and socialize a lot. Maybe lock is a good pick purely because everyone wants summons and stones. Frankly, maybe I MYSELF want summons and stones because sitting around waiting on people to get to dungeon or raid all day and dying due to no lock rocks. I’ll have to consider this. This is one factor I hadn’t thought about yet: what is going to be higher quality of life and better for friends and guild mates.

Thanks!!!
---
I reckon that's a Peter Lee painting. No particular reason why.
---
I was viewing this through the lens of new guild members/PUGs that are there to fill the raid. I would hope that these concerns wouldn't exist for consistent guild members, but your point is till valid.
---
When I was a baby, Warcraft had just come out and it took a while to get from place to place in game... My dad would sit me on his lap and we'd watch the gryphon fly together. Still one of my favorite stories to hear :)
---
The idea is ok but there's no possible feral build where you would bother with powershifting and be able to spend 13 points in resto. OOC (11pt bal) and LotP are core talents so yeah... none left over.
---
Druids are the only viable hybrids save one welfare spriest and possibly a welfare Enh shaman or two needed for totems.
---
Ferals can go Hotw spec for 5-mans, pvp, grinding its very good 1/29/21. Its bad for raids, but you cannot have everything.
---
As someone who chose to resub because I could dabble in 8.2 and get to experience the stress test, feels bad.  
---
Especially because the first date delay brought it right up to the point where I can play one of the two stress tests days.  
---
And now..rip.
---
Will I be accepted into raids and wanted as a Discipline Priest?
---
Class fantasy, man. I played lock during my hardcore phase during MoP/WoD (before they massacred my boy) and before the Demon Hunters took it, we were the ones who sacrificed everything! (I mean, not really, during MoP and WoD we were just high APM parse jockeys but whatever) 
---
If you're willing to put in the work, you're more useful -- but you don't get the benefits of your own class as much as Mage (in my opinion).
---
Good luck!

I would hope that even the nochanges people could differentiate between bliizzlike and vanillalike.  Just because this is possible with the base code, doesnt mean that is represents a version of the game that everyone wants to recreate, as no one in 2004-06 knew about this bug, and if they did almost for sure it would have been changed by the devs at the time.
---
Why do you care what a PUG does with the loot once they've won it? Just give it to them.
---
And if a new guild member tries to sell the loot, just write the loot off and kick them.
---
This is satire right?
---
Goblin rocket helmet is a great choice for cc while you kill 1 thing off or want time to heal.  But good engineering items are a one off, because of harsh cooldowns.  I had all the handy engineering items back in vanilla, and most of the time they were just best in PvP because you could surprise people with them.  Another thing that's nice is the stealth seeing goggles that actually can help you see rogues in time before they strike.  Especially if you are a stacking it with Hunter Track Hidden.  I think you'll need a bag full of engineering items and you'll want to slot them all on a vertical bar off to the side so that you always have access to what you want to do with them on the fly.  Otherwise you won't always have time to make the decisions to use them at the right time because some require you to have them equipped.  Obviously you might not care about this as a rogue, but items like gnomish cloaking device allow other classes to conveniently get to places solo.  It is one of my favorite items in WoW.
---
&gt; Then JerkPlayer tries to sell Vis'kag to Yakelam for gold because items can be traded for 2h.
---
/gkick JerkPlayer. Problem solved.
---
'Valestraz' got my blood boiling
---
Wotolk-WoD, lock was my favorite class. God damn I wish we could go back to demo where you become the demon and affliction where it isn’t about little bitch unstable affliction spam stacking (destro doesn’t feel bad imo, it’s somewhat retained its soul).
---
If you wanna raid Warrior. 
---
If you are playing just to play, shaman or druid.
---
While babies wont remember - they will be highly influenced by those early years.
---
I don't care at all. It sounds like the OP does, though.
---
Ya I already have my vacation set... I hope it doesn't get pushed back. But if it did I'd think it'd be for a good reason
---
Mage is sooooo much more newbie friendly IMO.
---
1. Conjured food and water is super super useful
---
2. Can pull from far away, which means less chance of getting adds (rogues get a lot of value from a stealth opener)
---
3. Polymorph &gt; Sap
---
4. Portals
---
Mage is only "difficult" (aka to get 100% value out of) in pvp.  Leveling and group pve content is great with mage.
---
Possibly. 
---
There is merit to the idea in general, but I cannot think of a specific rogue example.
---
Here's a [youtube video I found]
---
(https://youtu.be/-6hPZessUIY?t=192) that is an example of a farm that MAY be possible with good gear and skills. The guy claims that this farm is not possible with a rogue (as he states that the only class that wants the blackstone ring that can solo it is hunter), but there is at least [one video of a guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oqns6ILw-6g) soloing princess as rogue and claiming that you could do it in pre-BIS. 
---
Honestly, I would look at the priest run very carefully and decide for yourself if you think you could do it with a rogue. I know little about rogues.
---
Theres a new blue post about crit aura buffs getting reduced by a flat 3% if you are not within 10 pts of weapon skill. I'm not kidding!
---
Don't use shit like Addons which tell you where to go if you want an authentic experience like the people who played at Vanilla launch.
---
&gt; it's allowed on ND but very few do it
---
It's surprisingly difficult to do it right. Guilds can practice if they're that serious about it, but it's not something you just pull off without carefully organizing the whole guild around it. It's doable but it's harder than the Onyxia fight itself. Gotta make sure everyone dies except the exact people you want to lock in, and none of those can die. Meanwhile everybody has to completely stop DPS at a very specific point so that Onyxia is nearly dead and can be finished off by a hard wind, which means anyone who doesn't stop DPS probably ruins the entire thing.
---
I reckon it'll be in Classic and a small minority of guilds will make it work, but most will just do Onyxia the normal way. For those who can do it properly, it's a pretty serious advantage, but it's nowhere near as broken as the fact that having the patch 1.11 PvP gear available as soon as the honor system comes online means that people who can spend 12h/day for months ranking up will have gear that's comparable to AQ40 loot by the time BWL opens. Compared to that, getting a few extra Onyxia kills per week is relatively benign.
---
not yet, I'm working on more right now, takes much longer than you would think. much, much longer. I can convert a specific macro if you need tho.
---
It's actually linked to weapon skill? Wow that is insane. Not too big of a deal for a tank though since they will never be in zerk stance.
---
You can grab edgemasters handguards and get +7 axe/sword/dagger on a Tauren.
---
those are not resources, those are combo points
