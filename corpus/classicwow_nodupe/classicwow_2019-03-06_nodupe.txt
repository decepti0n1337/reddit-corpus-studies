Whenever i hopped on my druid back in 2006, i ended up dancing with 10 other druids in cat form in stormwind. That's my extensive experience with druids.

I'm not sure what those are but you sound like you might enjoy Star Ship Troopers which was a oretty solid movie. Just watch it again for the first time in like 15 years

Exactly why I am going orc shaman and duo-leveling. Fuck opportunistic rogues

Confirmed right [here](https://youtu.be/izCBaGfGJCg?t=2398) by Mark Kern, team lead on vanilla. 
---
Hunter, easiest and fun leveling. Aspects are 'passive effects', can get chance on hit effects with Improved Aspect of the Hawk, Improved Wing Clip, can farm [Dragon's Call](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10847#comments) for even more (fishing for procs w/ Wing Clip too, can use Frost Oil to get even fancier). Lots of cool tricks with pet management, can meme around with Eyes of the Beast. Go Night Elf for even more messing around with Shadowmeld.

Owner here. It really doesn‚Äôt load that slow. I go to the site prob 50 times a day and it **maybe** takes 2-3 seconds to load on the database page. For a free website that has grown faster than we can keep up I would say it‚Äôs pretty solid. If we had more donations we could definitely improve the site.

I'm sure it's very far off BfA's numbers. Just because the vocal minority has been calling BfA a dumpster fire doesn't mean the WoW community follows suit. It's too bad there are no wow numbers but if you think Wow and Runescape are on the same page playerbase wise then I have a bridge to sell you...
---
Never. I didn't know ISPs would even care about that.

Owner here. I have no idea who this person is and just saw this post. I agree with the existing reply. And also, I have nothing to gain from self promoting the website, there is no ad revenue. If anything more people cost me more $ üòÅ
---
idk why but whenever I see the name "tipsout," I always think "dicksout." Am I gay?
---
FFXI only had one level cap increase that actually invalidated old content and that happened over a decade into its lifespan. 
---

---
Expansions never invalidated older content as it was really more of a parallel progression system. There was some tiering to their version of raids but they did not invalidate old content. 
---
We had a "no profanity" rule on our main Ventrilo channel and it did a lot to keep everyone actual like normal persons.
---
Your comparing concurrent players at one time with monthly subs.
---
Wow probably is bigger, but I doubt as big as you think. 
---
I.e. If players average 24 hours a week, 100k average concurrent would actually be something closer to 700k unique players a week... though I dont have runescape figures at hand so cant do  realistic example, but maths.
---
Eityerway the classic team needs to learn alot from osrs at how to revive an old game!
---
I should try that sometime. When someone presents facts I pretend that I'm too cool to give a fuck about the facts even though I follow a Classic WoW subreddit so I obviously do care.
---
200 IQ response, fuckface.
---
In all fairness Hearthstone is likely not a consideration in Blizzard‚Äôs bottom line. 
---
Their devs literally made a ‚Äúwhat would it take you guys to come back‚Äù tweet, after month after month of concurrency declines. 
---
idk how it was at Nost, but here its 20% for spell damage and 29% for holy spell damage.

I might be wrong but I think there were multiple bradygames versions. I remember having a bigger bradygames one that had more in it, and then a smaller one that fome as a bonus when i bought a cheap battlechest edition of the game.
---
Are you able to get an SSL cert and enable HTTPS?
---
4k &gt; 3k in every sense. 
---
Nothing worse than spamming world chat for a healer for 1 hour.
---
It's completely Blizzlike - If you started in 1.12. In that regard, Classic would be even more authentic if it had all content right from the start. 
---
The issue is that 1.12 is just one version of Vanilla. We had over 10 more, each chock full of all kinds of changes plus new content. We won't be getting those now and we won't get changes to accommodate that fact either. 
---
And those are your only options. Either you deal with whatever issues arise from the lack of previous patches or you open the can of worms that is retuning and changes. We all know what people here chose. 
---
Thats not spell power build btw...
---
Actually Thunderfury proc not scaling with spell power... 
---
Spellpower paladins are using Manual Crowd Pummeler and shitloads of other onhit items.
---
In theory, spellpower paladin should do more dmg, but that will be 100% unrealistic on practice build.
---
The build(buff list) in that vid is pretty common and realistic for hardcore guilds.
---
Thrice-regurgitated info, sometimes wrong and ill-informed, unnecessarily spread so thin it could reach across the Atlantic. 
---
The mental gymnastics you Blizzard cuckolds go through are seriously astounding.
---
Why can't you just admit that the company just wants to cut corners and save money while we pay $15/month for a 15 year old game?
---
Don't you think $180/year warrants a presentation of the game at least SLIGHTLY ABOVE that of private servers?
---
We're talking about pushing to 5-6 git repos for patches instead of 4? Is it really that unfair of an expectation?
---
Yes das rite pipiman
---
because world chat is a cheap replica of LookingForGroup, which apparently didn't work on the first private server, so players created a new one and got used to it. Patch 1.12 HAD the LookingForGroup channel.
---
Watch your mouth tauren are one of the best races in game. Tauren and orcs are top dogs.
---
If you want to be casual and play a class that doesn't need crazy good gear. Your best option first off is to write off any "hybrid" unless you want to do their main thing such as heal. As far as what class to play. The two most rewarding classes for someone who is never going to break free from casual play. Are mage and rogue.
---
Firstly I will go over mage which I view to be the "golden child" of classic wow. Their quality of life is off the charts.
---
Pros.
---
- They are T1 viable at every level of play. No matter what you are attempting to do be it pvp while you level. Raid at 60, farm gold, ect ect... there is nothing this class isn't a T1 competitor for.
---
- They make their own water saves a metric dick ton of gold
---
-They can make ports meaning you will never need to wait for a Zep and can place hearth not in a major city. This is mega huge for saving time. Not to be under sold.
---
-They are cheap as hell to play. For the same price a warrior spends on his pants you can pre-bis the freaking class.
---
-Money if you have a rich friend it's always a mage
---
-They are super good for casual play. Allowing for a flawless transfer into a hardcore style of play if your priorities change.
---
Cons
---
Honestly I don't think a mage has any. They are such spoiled little brats that the biggest con's are that people might ask you for your free shit. Such as water/food or portals. Yes thats right. The biggest complaint mages have is that they can share some of their silk slipper golden boy shit with other people.
---
Rogue
---
Pro's
---
-T1 Viable at every level of game play except farming High Warlord. Which you don't need to pvp.
---
- Is an affordable Melee dps (rarer then you think) 
---
-Primary stat is agility meaning you get crit from even the most basic gear. Crit is normally the stat that causes classes to "need" to raid.
---
- Is most likely the best class in the game for being able to kill someone bigger then you. Bigger is more geared in this case.
---
-Actual living god of world pvp.
---
Con's
---
-Second slowest leveler in the game behind paladins.
---
- highly populated by other players.
---
-low dungeon demand. If you wanna do a dungeon. expect to be the one organizing it.
---
Overall I would recommend mage. It's the master class of classic wow. It honestly has no downside. It's in demand for everything always and does not need gear to be good.
---
Here is a good example of evolving tech which could help u understand https://youtu.be/hCsEHYwjqVE
---
And mining, both sell well on the AH
---
&gt;Idk I guess if you can‚Äôt play a video game without emotional attachment I‚Äôm not sure you should play.
---
...does that suffice?
---
Once again thank you so much for taking the time to write all of this. Honestly mage wasn‚Äôt even a class I was thinking because a friend of mine would probably main it, but now you‚Äôre making me consider trying to convince him to play something different!
---
As for hybrid, I don‚Äôt mind healing in PvP and PvE as it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done since BC to Legion. Maybe I‚Äôll convince him to play rogue. One advantage of being a healer is it‚Äôs easier to get groups when you‚Äôre limited on time.

150-200 working fine for me. Usually in at 160-170
---
It‚Äôs not full circle if you still have the old game this time around. I feel as if the first three are the most necessary, but if they keep going after that, it‚Äôs fine with me. 
---
Rogue on a pvp server here, nothing beats stealthing and ganking.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If I change my mind it'll be mage on a PvE server, love me some portals.
---
I‚Äôd like to agree, and am personally quite excited for Classic. But. I‚Äôm not sure I *can* agree.
---
Of the people that I still know that played Vanilla (or FFXI for that mafter) 0 want to play classic. 
---
I know I‚Äôm excited to play it, and know what I want to level and in what order.  It despite that I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll have time to hit 60 in less than 4-5 months. 
---
As is, a convo with an enthusiastic co-worker doesn‚Äôt correlate directly to a guaranteed 12+ month subscriber. Maybe he‚Äôll play. Or maybe he doesn‚Äôt have time, despite wishing he did, so won‚Äôt. 
---
So I think the hype level at Blizzard is likely in line with an expectation that there will be a big initial influx of players. Followed by an indeterminate drop off. 
---
this should help you out: https://www.ssl.com/how-to/get-ssl-on-website/
---
If you plan on going Resto or Ele. Tauren is way better even against rogues. That AoE stun is life. Not even sure what orcs can do with their 30% stun resist.  Don't get me wrong it's a great ability but, being able to cast a spell is way stronger for a hybrid. Rogues is easy money for a good tauren shammy while leveling. Unless they are CB spec but no one survives a CB spec rogue not even groups of two lol. The shaman would be dead long before the warrior ever came unsapped.
---
As somebody who‚Äôs made *many* level 70/80 guilds throughput Cata, MoP, and even WoD, it‚Äôs not the same. 
---
5-man heroics? Just 2 man them and pretty much one shot mobs. Karazhan? Literally 3 manned it. And as far as removed content goes, technically ZA got removed in Cata. 
---
I guess you're right. Blizzard just couldn't help themselves. They have this deep desire to make things easier for casuals and they always have. Trivializing MC and BWL is just an extension of their addiction to cater to casuals.  
---
I personally don't remember the name, the main names I remember from Kolat (I joined in early BC) Icheb(hunter), Juswana (Priest), Misg ( Pally) Sheezallthat (priest), Omiekayne(sp? rogue guild leader), his wife the mage, Saintsnake(hunter). My alt twink was named Potatochip. I was Pasiden a hunter if my OP did not say. 
---
hey man, nowadays the existence of butthurt cynics are signs that you are doing something right. 
---
Great writeup, I agree if you go hybrid you should be open to heal, otherwise pick a dps class.
---
&gt; The gear is the same and Ele Shamans while good at pvp are just not raid viable.
---
I might be completely crazy, but I am pretty sure if you stacked a raid group with a proper amount of healers, a proper amount of off tanks but the rest elemental shamans, you can still clear all of the content or atleast up to naxxramas, even if it will be much slower and be a lot harder. I mean how bad can their dps really be if their buffed to the maxx like a raid would be? as far as i know you need about 9500 dps total for patchwerk, split by 23 dmg dealers that is 413 dps required out of each of those shamans, factoring out the 5 tanks and 12 healers we brought. As far as i know patchwerk is an excellent gear check for naxxramas and most if not all content mc-aq40 would be doable with 23 elemental shamans as your only source of damage.
---
Making them atleast viable if you take as little as one. They are not optimal for shit but they sure are viable especially in smaller numbers and especially as true hybrids, filling up healing spots that otherwise would have gone unfilled.
---
Because BC will be much much easier to develop, even compared to Classic it‚Äôs a walk in the park to recreate, and it will retain more subs.
---
You mentioned the importance of progressive itemization so IMO your argument is fair and I would agree that prog itemization is far more important than Dire Maul.
---
If we're paying $180/year for a 15-year-old game I would like the game to be presented at least slightly better than that of private servers.
---
I don't think that splitting the patches from 4 to 6 total would be an unfair expectation.
---
I have good memories from a fresh Nost 2.0 server where Dire Maul wasn't out yet and I was forced to farm pre-Dire Maul BiS items first. It was frustrating but afterwards I realized that this added a unique 1.5 months of max-level experience.
---
It won't kill the game but it would be nice. It's nice when the DM dungeons open and there's world pvp and tons of groups forming. It's one more world event. It's nice doing MC without DM:N tribute buffs to further trivialize the content. It's not necessary but it's nice.
---
I don't see a reason to remove these intricacies from vanilla WoW forever. Once they're gone they're gone.
---
I totally would go that but I may roll a tauren druid, and troll priest. In any case I'd probably never roll orc, so I might as well do it as a shaman, it's mostly for the aesthetic
---
Throwing a full health NPC into the dirt with a Windfury proc will never get old.
---
Totems are cool to play with and really useful once you get some of the more unique ones.
---
Rockbiter + shield + Earth Shock spam can be cool to tank with if your party needs it against a rare or some dungeon content you overpower (or if you and four other people just want to be masochists).
---
you arent flagged for pvp in 1-10 zones of your own faction/even if they came from a pvp zone the time spent flying to and possibly doing things in orgrimmar would unflag you
---
Sharding splits player bases. Merging combines. That‚Äôs the difference.
---
I don't think they want to do dynamic respawn, so im pretty sure u don't even watn huge pop servers yourself when that doesn't exist.
---
Their is no way they will make "dynamic respawn and non" type of servers. Pretty sure they will go with 3kl to 4k pop servers (online)
---
This is actually a huge worry of mine. Choosing a server is going to be one massive gamble right off the bat. I hope we get a poll posted on this sub so we can sortve coordinate servers when they release the list.
---
True but having diremaul delayed is 100% ALWAYS the better option so I would prefer blizzard to take the better version than the worse, even if it is not a big deal and doesn't really change raiding much. 
---
U litterly ruin quests etc with dynamic respawn, their is no way blizzard will ever want to imploment that, we all are "no changes" but we want private server changes now suddently? 
---
&gt; TBC did so incredibly much to improve all the specs that I can't go back to vanilla druids.
---
Yup I also mained Druid and they became so much fun during TBC but Vanilla was a very hard lesson, I was new and did very little research before choosing my my main and tanked all the way to 60 just to get berated on how I'm now a healer, fuck all that noise.
---
The people who complain are the ones who actually play the game instead of acting like know-it-all's on reddit.
---
Been thinking of doing the same. Almost to the tee as I have found my profound love of Shaman. Sounds a bit dramatic but I have so much fun playing Elemental or healing my group as Resto, and eventually being a Nightfall Bot doesn't sound that awful. 
---
However I haven't experienced the 60 farm with Shaman and was thinking a Mage might be a better first toon to grind like you're saying to 60 and save as much gold as possible. However I began to think if it was worth it spending the amount of time on leveling another character just to fuel the main in this case my Shaman.
---
I'll be spending some time soon farming cough cough lvl 56 cough, but will see what I can do just as a Shaman. It would be nice to be able to have Engineering as well as another crafting profession if not mining and have the farmer toon trained in Mining and Herbs.
---
Just some of my thoughts figured I'd share and see what your plans are in terms of alternative classes and their benefits also what you love about Shaman.
---
adding to the point that if there are no other zones you want to go to or it would just take you forever to go to safety, you could just level an alt. i'm thinking i'll have a few collecting rested exp and hop on them when i want a change of pace or it seems like i'm in for a bunch of camping. and on a side note, playing on undocumented servers with a giant pop i've honestly not been camped that much, so you'll probably be ok if they go with smaller pop caps
---
Whatever won't have a queue.
---
True I agree ZG being out is probably more important but I think the question is more that DM release is the first stage and is therefore more urgent 
---
Just pull a Warlords of Draenor, but keep the storyline simple. Evil liches summoning armies of the undead, meanie dragons hiding behind an army of minions atop a dark spire, blackrock orcs... all that shit.
---
WoW wasn't always about mustache twirling supervillains and legions of heroes.
---
Star Citizen. The uh... Massive crowed funded space based MMO. Entirely transparent development progress.
---
Squadron 42 is the side game coming out around 2020 that leads into the persistent universe.
---
Privately owned (slightly less now), $200 million in crowd funding, 500 devs acrossed 4 time zones. And they just got an $40 million influx for advertising and showcasing from an independent investor for a 10% stake.
---
It's.... Huge. Do yourself a favor and start checking it out. I think it's past the point where the haters are calling it a scam. It's in alpha now but already it's goddamn glorious. But we won't get a persistent universe for a few more years.
---
Be the change you want to see in the world.
---
PvP adds a layer of additional immersion that a PvE server can never replicate.
---
You feel safer in Durotar as Horde, you know and feel the jungles of STV to be dangerous, you feel safer in Stonetalon near Horde territory and less safe in Searing Gorge in the middle of the Eastern Kingdoms,
---
fellow allies in your faction come to your aid, you gain a caution, a fear, even a little hate for the opposite faction - this is *war.*
---
And again, when the friendly Dwarf Hunter walks by you without attacking, when the Gnome Warrior doesn't kill you when you're low life - they create small moments of kinship.
---
In PvE there is never anything unexpected. The mobs act out AI, the mobs spawn in set places, no surprises. In a PvP server, you literally never know what's around the corner in the open world.
---
The only option for me is RP-PvP, because when I'm a Troll warrior, I want to act like a Troll Warrior too, mon.
---
I'm also totally going to watch starship troopers again because I've been playing Rimworld :P
---
Did Frostfire Tier 3 really have spirit in some armors?
---
On wowhead, there is no spirit but on wowiki, the gear shows that there is spirit. Which one is accurate?
---
well, what i'm saying is that there are always 100k+ people just online in osrs, that means multiple times that number are the total subscriber numbers, and it's pretty obvious with the trends currently for bfa and what has been shown if you look a bit that bfa has less than 4m subscribers left, some saying less than 2.5m.
---
Oof
---
One of us doesn't know what anger management does, and I'm not sure who.  
---
Execute is always used to finish off a mob, unless it would be a massive overkill (50+ rage scenario where a mob is like 2% hp).  I can go through mobs much faster and have guaranteed rage generation with the improved charge.
---
New experience. Each xpac I mained the same toon but leveled atleast one alt. The only 3 I never accomplished was rogue, warlock and paladin. I dislike the stealth playstyle so I'm going paladin! Ret even, I'm a dps guy
---
It won't kill the game but it would be nice. It's nice when the DM dungeons open and there's world pvp and tons of groups forming. It's one more world launch event. It's nice doing MC without DM:N tribute buffs to further trivialize the content. It's not necessary but it's nice.
---
We're the ones paying $180/year. I don't get why we should give up on issues that would improve the game which take very little extra effort.
---
I mean there are great arguments for 1.5 AV and that would take slightly more effort to implement than breaking a few DM instance portals.
---
Yes it really has spirit on some pieces. Vanilla itemization baby!
---
Agree. It's just a stupid argument to say "but but EU had a bad experience we should all have one".
---
Like china didn't get wow before patch 1.5 so we should start with that!!  
---
" One advantage of being a healer is it‚Äôs easier to get groups when you‚Äôre limited on time." 
---
This is not true. Classic wow has one class that is generally willing to tank. The choke on a tank is so strong that it makes the wait on a healer as irrelevant as a dps. If you get a tank you have a group full stop.
---
I would also not go for a hybrid in classic if time is a consideration. Between having to farm two sets of gear. Maintain two sets of enchants and farming all the gold that requires. You lose a crap ton of time. You may drown in it all to be honest. It's not just about what you are willing to do. Its also about how you want to allocate the precious time you have. 
---
As far as convincing your friend to play a different class. I wouldn't worry about it too much. It might make getting gear a little slower but nothing wrong with 2 casters in a dungeon. Double mage is highly stackable. If he likes pvp though. You might be able to entice him into being a rogue because they are god mode at world pvp. 
---
Shadowmeld is great in pvp for surprising flag carriers in WSG, provoking failed capture attempts in Basin, and escaping corpse camps in world pvp, among other conveniences like eat+meld.
---
Completely true. It had pretty much zero impact on retail, but it has a huge impact on prviate servers and I would argue that private servers in this category is a lot closer to classic. Both starts with players knowing a ton, rushing to 60 and raiding, both starts with 1.12 patching and hopefully some sort of progressive itemization.
---
Blizzard should (and most likely already have) look at private servers and how they handle issues that recreating vanilla brings. 
---
JAB reading reddit: Cancel classic? You think we won't but we will.
---
Yeah being a healer in AV is a pretty cushy experience. Feel bad for melee players in those massive teamfights, having to rush into the meatgrinder and get killed in five seconds. Always try to toss the poor things a few heals to make them last ten seconds instead, lol.
---
DM being released on launch will have little to no impact on server first races.
---
DM being released on launch will marginally help lower tier guilds who struggle with mechanics (and yes this still happens).
---
If you are really that hardcore... make a guild yourself and restrict players from utilizing DM items until you've cleared MC and Rag.  I'm sure you can find 100 like minded people.
---
This isnt an issue.
---
Well that's a good point actually, the way they worded it made it sound like things are open ended and not at all finalized.
---
I'm sure they wouldn't release too much content at once. As an example you can spend weeks or months farming pre-raid BiS if you have real life responsibilities to attend to.
---
It was months and months after DM release before the world first Ragnaros kill.
---
You tell us if you think that had any impact on that kill.
---
I think that's what he was trying to say actually?
---
It's one of 5 talking points from blizzcon. Not much else to talk about.
---
Stick to the fucking raid schedule. Don't just raid on some random weekday because there are a lot of people are on and the MT felt like it, randomly leaving out core raiders that scheduled and signed up for it.
---
Yes, I'm pissed. &gt;:(
---
The general consensus is Arms if you play on a PvP realm and 2H Fury if you play on any variation of PvE realms.
---
I agree, 2 thing I refuse to deal with, guild websites and guild applications. I dont give a shit how far progressed a guild is I'm not filing form GA-1099(b) in duplicate to establish The Client is of the opinion that the Contractor has the necessary qualifications and experience in enter into agreement 1.

---
Potatochip definitely rings a bell. Do you remember acquiring a Shadowfang for your twink but only paying for it years later?
---
So you mean sometimes it can NOT have spirit on the same piece of armor?
---
Same I actually love TBC but the final patch is WOTLK lite. I think the second half of TBC and WOTLK are what started the massive decline in wow. WOTLK in particular is an absolutely awful expansion. I have no idea how it gets lumped in with TBC and Classic as good expansions. It was pure unmitigated trash to me.
---
fake vanilla player detected
---
Interesting to hear your perspective, that wasn't my experience at all since I never made it to max level. I started playing right before the Rise of the Zilart which was the first expansion with all the basic jobs and a lvl 70 cap. From what I saw they expanded it many many times all the way up to 95 or 99.
---
I never even made it to max level and saw any horizontal content in the original that I played prior to any of that, because I spent the entire time leveling up and playing hardcore no life all night in Japanese EXP parties. I had a BLM in the 50s and had to farm each of my elemental staves and ancient magic by using invisible spells to mine ore in Ifrits cauldron. I thought that was an awesome system with ancient magic and magic breaks and skill chains with translation macros for the timing and everything like that, but it was too hardcore for me. It was impossible to do anything because the content coming out had people playing at max level and getting groups was hard. Even as a highly desired class with all the right gear +1 on everything ancient magic weapon swap macros and announcements on the cast timers it would still take a few hours to find a good party. And then heaven forbid someone had to go.
---
So maybe in your experience there was technically only 1 expansion as you said that technically invalidated content via vertical expansion rather than horizontal, but for me I saw the population of low level zones drop as the new expansion content came out and an already tough situation got even harder. I played on the server Kujata. I feel like with how long it takes to work on alts they could have spent a lot more time between content releases as you could play for years and still not have done it all.
---
Or, maybe, it was indeed a reasonable time frame I just hate the idea of mandatory expansions at all haha. I like the idea of character permanence and everything staying populated and relevant. I think MMOs should be like a board game that you can play over and over again with the experience changing by who you play with. I dont need a carrot on a stick of constant new classes and new level cap increases.
---
Did you go 2H at first and then switch to Sword and Board later?
---
i'm so happy a service like this exists. well done to the creator - you're really doing a great job!
---
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHSHIT YES! I remember you 100% now. Yes I am sorry for paying you in WotLK for Shadowfang :(. Very happy to connect w/ you :) 
---
Blackout procs vs rogue in their opener..... so juicy.
---
It would be them rejecting the notion that their game needs to be "balanced", which is what has spurred the homogenization of classes and specs. Vanilla is the only moment in this game's life, when endgame was not the focal point. Pandering to turbo autismos who have spreadsheets of "pre raid BiS" documents on their desktop and play the game as if it were a job, was the catalyst for why the game deteriorated.
---
Most of the biggest problems this game has today, is due to this obsessive focus on end game raiding. For as goofy as transmog is, and the selfie thing, these things fundamentally do not alter gameplay in any way. But the 4 difficulty settings, the WQs, the weekly chests from PvP and M+, and how irrelevant and dull leveling is, have killed the game.
---
A open world fantasy game got turned into a instanced heavy 'job', where you log in and do everything needed to maximize your character. What a waste.
---
ah shit you're right, i am bobo the fool/my bad
---
All the problems in your life have been solved? I wish I was you.
---
Also, if you need a game that badly to be happy, the doctor probably wasn't wrong.
---
Healthcare, childcare, universal repair income, and free DKP.
---
I'd love RP PvP. But, my fear is that such servers would be under popped or imbalanced.
---
Starting off with RP Pve. Then, eventually, if an RP PvP server is thriving I'll switch to that. Seeeeems like a logical approach. 
---
You are thinking of the Dungeon Companion, also done by BradyGames. These have lists of items and weapons, very detailed 
---
They made 3, the one with a Qiraj on the cover is for Classic, Illidan on cover is TBC and Yogg Saron on cover is WotLK. I think they stopped making them at that point. Almost like BradyGames realized the game began to suck at that point.
---
Yes, I remember this! Didn't last too long before it got reverted, but it was pretty crazy when it was going on.
---
There was also going in as a shaman, with the mail gloves that did nature damage on hit. Wasn't as good as fire rogue but it was still wild. 
---
On nost ret paladins would rock a faster sword, ideally the one off rag that gave a stacking armor Penn self buff, while just swinging with seal of the crusader. So that might be what it was, sotc. 
---
Wasn't the Super Adventure Club the one that molests kids around the world?
---
I would definitely join a guild that's called Super Adventure Club. :D
---
It was from the south park episode yeah, a bunch of us angsts teens made the guild on Blackrock back in the day and we‚Äôve remained playing together since. 
---
Lower back pain would've been a shitty racial tbh.
---
yea elemental shaman has about the skillcap of a pom pyro mage, maybe a little more
---
its still a very strong specc though
---
a melee shaman needs to master absolute chaos and total randomness in every single battle, you basicaly need to adapt to a whole new situation in combat after every hit
---
no other class is this unpredictable
---
also, get in and hope for luck only works like 20% on mages and nobody else. most of the time you run around with 1h+shield, switching weapons when you get a nice clothie in front of you, adapt with all your tools and engineering
---
also you mana is more limited due to melee gear
---
i ended vanilla with 180 dayes played on my shaman and played all specs to no end.
---
in melee spec, not only did i use every rank 1 shock, i even used rank 1 purge in several situations to not waste too much mana
---
in the end the melee shamans skill cap in pvp is miles above the elementals or healers
---
the melee shamans matchup is worse vs warriors but better in every other situation if you bring some serious skill. you also need to get used to weapon swapping just like warriors do stance dancing
---
get a good shield and dont use leather or cloth
---
i literally world of warcraft as a 10 year old. my mother bought it, i stuck it in the computer, and installed it. that was difficult at that age. i would have had 0 clue how to edit a realmlist. 
---
don't be pretentious - not everyone is computer literate, but everyone used to be able to play wow.
---
Enhancement isn't so bad at the start. The problem is that it starts to fall behind fairly early and never picks back up again.
---
Elemental just doesn't have issues with falling off. It stays powerful all the way from when you obtain dungeon gear until Naxxramas.
---
Enhancement's peak is somewhere between MC and BWL.
---
So is this link the correct Tier 3 stats?
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item-set=526/frostfire-regalia
---
Or this
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Frostfire_Regalia
---
2 warlocks! 
---
You don't have to worry about taking eachothers gear because you don't need any.
---
2 voids for tanking.
---
2 fears.
---
2 sets of dots will kill mobs without having to use any more spells on them so you can just dot and run through everywhere.
---
You will have absolutely no problem with any PvP. 
---
My favorite way to go. Way more fun in groups and pvp, and it mixes up soloing. Imp Ambush pretty much starts every target at 50% hp.
---
It‚Äôs cool man lol, we were young and dumb. Super stoked to someone I recognized on vanillafriends. Gonna play Classic? Know what you‚Äôre gonna main first?
---
&gt; A pretty big contention in the community is having Dire Maul in content bucket 1 because, in addition to 16 debuff slots and 1.12 itemization, Dire Maul gear will completely trivialize an already trivial raid.
---
I think that's untrue. MC was not trivial in pre-raid gear, even with the DM drops. DM came out quite early in Vanilla's patch cycle, certainly before the majority of players who ran MC made their way in to that instance.
---
MC's difficulty wasn't a pre-raid gearing challenge beyond your raid's main tank, and even then your warrior could do it in the right blues. MC was more a raid co-ordination challenge. MC and Onyxia were designed to teach your raid things you would need in more difficult encounters. I am talking about things like DPS co-ordination (Lucifron and Majordomo), target allocation (garr), positioning (Onyxia, magmadar) and deadly debuffs (baron geddon). The only real gear check was on the fire resistance needed to kill Ragnaros himself. Everything prior to ragnaros himself is more about raid management and group co-ordination than gear. 
---
Yes the debuff slot limit change will make MC and especially Onyxia's phase 2 easier, but again, these encounters were more about a raid learning co-ordination than anything else. 
---
I feel like it was SoC because I was just straight up one shotting mobs and horde all through leveling too.
---
Dude you know me, I have been playing hunter since Vanilla so I might just go straight back..my next decision is warlock tbh. I think I just love pet classes. 
---
I'am personally more a fan of BM Hunter as a farming toon, because they literally need no gear and kill stuff easy &amp; fast. Mages are great but limited to AoE grinding and are more gear dependand generally, so they are less flexible, but it is completely viable to level up a Mage purely for farming.
---
Leveling 2 toons at roughly the same time on a fresh server has multiple benefits over leveling up one and a second one on a much later date.
---
1. You get more rested bonus XP because you are alternating your characters regularly. So you'll spend less /played time overall than someone who spreads out their alt and their main character.
---
2. If your farming character is ahead of your main (I'am planning on ~10 levels), it can funnel crafting resources into the main as you described above. This makes a crafting prof not only more enjoyable but actually effective because you craft in large chunks and actually get to have benefits from leveling your prof pre-60.
---
3. You'll get to react better to circumstances. You can switch back and forth depending on the PvP situation, contested farming spots, people wanting to clear dungeons etc.
---
4. You'll spend less gold and gain more if you level at a slower pace. Being on top of the leveling curve is fun but expensive, especially in terms of opportunity cost. You just have to vendor much more to get your mount etc. Because the economy isn't built up yet and prices are low.
---
5. You can funnel good BoE greens into your main char because else you would just disenchant/vendor them. You can also maybe keep some blues instead of auctioning them. This again, speeds up your overall progression and makes it more enjoyable.
---
I think this is overall just a better strategy. Nothing for people who don't want to spend a good chunk of their time in the first couple of weeks/months. But I think it is just way better than speedleveling a single character in almost every regard.
---
#nochanges
---
Nice. I've been looking at Warrior myself, I guess some things just don't change. Maybe Shaman or Warlock as well. I don't know, it changes every day. Can't wait for it to come out though.
---
&gt; One of us doesn't know what anger management does, and I'm not sure who.
---
You
---
Uhm... I don't mean to burst your bubble, but all the trends that led to retail already started in or even before Vanilla. 
---
Start off by comparing Vanilla to all the other MMOs of its time and you'll see it was hugely more accessible and convenient. Casualization was a design choice right from the start and was kept all throughout Vanilla. 
---
Meeting Stones were a prototype for the later LFD systems, including the later added ability to summon. Cross Realm BGs were the start of cross realm technology, from LFD over merged realms/CRZ to sharding. Battlemasters were brought into the cities for more convenience, flight paths were connected and probably more I forget. 
---
Dungeons were also nerfed to become more accessible, whether it be nerfing/removing mobs, reducing the required party size or nerfing mechanics. The same can be said about AV. 
---
Class Balance and itemization kept being updated. Blessing of Kings, Hurricane, Innervate and probably more I forget were turned from final talents to innate abilities. Hammer of Wrath, Paladins Execute pendant, was added in 1.7. Homogenization was alive and well. 
---
TL;DR: Retail "is" the continuation of Vanilla. 
---
Honestly though, moonkin has serious Mana problems. The GPS is actually pretty good, and they scale very well with gear, but you cannot keep dpsing long enough to be a serious contribution on certain fights. Short fights, sure, or fights that have phases that give you time to regen a bit, but even with consumables you're looking at 2 to 3 minutes tops a full DPS, and once you're out of consumes to pop and Potions are in cool down, can't do shit
---
They expanded the cap from 75 to 99. Over the course of one expansion. 
---
You really are misremembering a lot. 
---
Oh really? Because every database seems to support my claim. Anger management didn‚Äôt passively gain rage until TBC. 
---
That might be it. The one I bought on ebay was the battle chest edition. 
---
While I don't want to complain about an awesome free service like yours like that guy, I did want to say I encountered issues with the site. I'm on a fiber connection and upon submitting my information I got the spinning loading icon for a long time but didn't want to do anything because I didn't want to pollute the database with a double entry. So I left the tab going for like half an hour. Eventually I closed it. I entered one more character for a different server that did go through after a few minutes. Later that night I checked back and the one that took a few minutes did go through, but the half an hour one didn't, so I felt comfortable resubmitting that one. It went through that time.
---
Looking at my server again today I see a double entry from somebody else. I only really mention this because if there are issues with the site like I experienced, most people wouldn't be doing their due diligence to make sure they don't create a double entry.
---
Lok'Tar Ogar! Victory or death!
---
Playable
---
Your last paragraph really articulates my own issues with retail.  
---
More than anything else, the thing I‚Äôm most looking forward to in Classic is the return to a community where you start recognizing other players in the world. You develop PvP rivals, and meet friendly players because the game depends so much on player interaction. 
---
Nicely done! You have a great eye for design. :)
---
Honestly people don't really realize that functions like group finder and fast flying mounts were demanded and praised by the community at the time. If the devs had refused to implement these things despite the community demanding them, WoW may not have gotten as popular as it did. 
---
I‚Äôm trying to decide between Tauren or Orc shaman and I‚Äôm leaning orc. 
---
Why would a 2 second stun be more advantageous than a 30% chance to resist a 5 second stun?
---
Cool story.
---
I actually played Warrior during vanilla and Anger Management have always had its hidden rage gain
---
If private servers are any indication, the cross faction spies will just be on the server discord this time around. 
---
The interesting thing to me is that vanilla was even pretty decent for those super min/max people. BWL was a bit bugged but fun and guilds started getting pretty hardcore. AQ40 had a serious race for firsts. Naxx was (in my opinion) amazing. I raided hardcore progression in vanilla and TBC but there was always the appeal that there was more to the game. Plenty of people doing as much PvP as possible, crafters who wanted to get everything they could, people rolling alt characters whenever we weren't raiding, everything. 
---
TBC started deciding that everyone needed to do the same content and get the same gear though. Having other content and other goals for the game besides raids was part of what kept people playing outside of raid time, and that's what kept a lot of players invested.
---
Curious about all 3 shaman specs. I mained alliance in vanilla and was young at the time. I remember 2h windfury being kind of nutty and that's about it. Was really interested in trying our horde resto shaman. Any good?
---
This is awesome
---
Oh I'm sure I'm misremembering a lot, but I'm only speaking to what I remember. I was young and playing on a ps2 with the big clunky 200$ adapter on the back haha
---
If the depopulation only had to do with people hitting max like you said, and nothing to do with new content, why does the same not hold true for WoW servers? When people hit max every zone and level range is still very populated. The only time the populations drop in my experience is when new servers open up and the whole population drops as players migrate off and pop dips to the hundreds. I feel like if ffxi had stayed classic as well then people would level more sub jobs and the world would stay more populated, much like weve seen in wow now that we have had multiple private server life cycles to reference.
---
 Aren't there private servers for ffxi as well? I remember joining a discord for one but didn't get it working before I moved on to wow privates with the wife who was familiar with wow so I dont know how well those are doing these days. Also perhaps my realm was just shitty too, I never saw any metrics for which servers were populated or not, I mostly just remember the memes of dragoons being hated and never getting groups lol and the players with JP ONRY in their lfg messages being the best exp parties haha
---
It can only be used on one target at a time.
---
These are great, well done!
---
can you test smite dps with all 6 of the pally buffs up? smite priest using r1 smite for super speed casts just using the pally dmg buff, building full crit and such?
---
What about you? What are you going to roll?
---
With how many people keep calling it dm I doubt they even played then. It will be fine ether way. No one is playing this for epic t1 loot, they are playing for the old content. Getting through mc quickly (it was very easy mechanically compared to even modern normals) sets the stage for the harder more team oriented content, that had a very small population of the old player base see.
---
Thanks for the feedback. When did this happen? If it happened a couple of days ago when Wowhead posted the site, it was getting hugged pretty bad and definitely was slow. I appreciate your patience and not spamming submissions. I would say 99% of the double submissions are people submitting their name and instantly going to the next page and the database has not synced yet and they go back and make another submission. Thats why I added the "please wait 3 minutes part". 
---
Addiction is a hell of a drug.
---
Switched at 18 and started tanking 
---
Double class duos sound fun, but idk how I feel about locks tbh..
---
You need to go to classic.wowhead.com to get the vanilla wow versions of items. Both of those are wrong.
---
Here's the [correct version](https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=526/frostfire-regalia)
---
Gotcha, yeah I'm leaning Elemental for sure.
---
Hm. Well my experience is just from be whispering and talking to the ret paladins who were doing great on realm players, which was the sorta warcraft logs functionally for nost and other servers 
---
Very good points, you're making my decision tough! (which is a good thing, I want to thoroughly think about all this while Classic is still pending)
---
Would you say Warlock gears are better than Mages since the Mage have the useless spirit stats in their set?
---
take 5 seconds to google and post this next time https://imgur.com/gallery/cM1RHQh
---
Horde only ever called it DM on the servers I played. The whole VC/DM debate is an Alliance struggle.
---
Sounds good! I'm so excited to play Shaman!
---
Yeah. If you were playing it as a kid you absolutely didn‚Äôt play before Zilart. That was bundled with the US release. 
---
no
---
This is sad because I like Orc so much better for Shaman :(
---
Not sure why you are disagreeing with me, that's exactly what I said and I agree with you lol. 10 year olds could play when the game was live, and they will be able to again when classic drops, that's exactly my point.
---
I think you are mistaking me for the guy I was arguing with.
---
Alright, I'll bite as I'm free tomorrow and I'm really itching to play
---
Dishonorable kills are removed. 
---
Tokens are never introduced and the amount of epics per boss are kept at vanilla level with no reduce in raid size.
---
Debuff slots are dubbled.
---
Death knights, Demon hunters, regular warglaives, throwing weapons and tauren melee totems are now real and usefull things.
---
This is up to wrath of the lich king. Pandas still only exists in legends, dragons are still mystical as fuck and after killing Kel'Thuzad the next raid is TBC raids
---
**Outland and northrend** is opened, Flying never happened so they look quite different the blood elfs and drenei are a neutral faction. While there is a bigger access for lower level character in both the new world and the new continent it is mainly blue-epic geared 60 zones or you need a group if you are a fresh level 60.
---
Questlines often start and tie you back to the eastern kingdoms and kalimdor, adding content for both 60's and whatever level the zones where originally designed for. The older instances gets new content, and items gets rebalances to give a better "stair" of items, even if it keeps it wonderfull quirkiness like having pre raid bis drop in 50 dungeon. The new items from dungeons are comparable to the old ones but still only slightly touch mc and opens up for more speccs prot paladins now have gear that is attainable for their level of content. T1 gets a small buff to offset DM gear and added resistances (frost for t1 gear and arcane for t2) and give the item changes a better feel aswell as buffing offsets a bit more then the T1 in mc. When you finally clear magtheridons lair, gruuls lair, SSC and karazhan you get gear that is a bit better then the naxx gear, making the gear buffs slowly crawl.
---
I never could belive Naggrand and whatever that swamp zone was called, why did the orc have to leave if their world was in fact 2/5 flourished with living stuff with a third zone that had weird energy space dudes that could grow shit in strange domes? Yeah sure the world is breaking up but the more I think about Outland the more unrealistic it seems compared to what I was told and saw in warcraft 1-3 aswell as the movie. The same thing goes for Northrend, it was far livelier then i ever could have imagined, it felt like they slammed in so much content they could fit but weirdly still had to cut important cornerstones like azhul nerub (Yeah i know, I'm complaining about getting too much content, I really enjoyed the leveling process in tbc and wrath even with many of their faults). 
---
**Caverns of time** opens up but has at best rebalances of the same instances that they originally released with, cutting most but keeping some, Caverns of time gives the option of trying MC if they had not been stopped (while keeping MC as it is) in the future. Adding some small changes, buffs, new abilities, bigger corehounds, another boss, garr is now 200 smaller ones as he was punished for some shit he pulled that we get to hear when we accept the quest in the caverns of time.  This is one way of how blizzard now adds a heroic mode. The second would be for example Dire Maul where you complete a long questline that now opens up another level of the dungeon. A third an actual button that starts the alarm in BRD making the enemies prepare for your assault. Why they drop better loot? They dont, they drop the same, except for now they had time to call some of the other elites from the dungeon that we never had a change to see making new items available for whoever is good enough to clear an entrenched BRD, throwing assassins if you stand around too much, adding traps that would have been active if they knew an attack was coming. 
---
Spaceships and Na'ru never happened, Sunwell is heavily reworked as M'urus race does not exist. Outland is a bigger hellfire penisula with a lot of shadowmoon valley added in it aswell as blades edges mountain being a thing
---
**Player and guild housing** is added, while many exists in the world it is a limited resource that is not forever. Some has a fixed gold amount that goes up for little every week/month. Some is rewarded to R14 or higher, some can be won by challenging the winning pvp guild in arena like events. Everyone can set their heartstone there if someone "owns", here is where the guild bank is located aswell as a few basic vendors some of which can be purchesed or questlined to be aquired in your guild house. They are spread around in the world making use of many unused buildings and adding some new ones (Goldshire seems like a really small town)
---
Effort is now put to erase alot of the copy phaste designs that exists, making it a more generic world. Some emphazis is put realism making npcs not stand around in the exact same spot, they now go to bed and atleast eat somtime (no toilet no :( ) and in the end actual supply lines are added for your faction and all its holdings, making it possible to close or open up some newly added bases or hamper the alliance from amount of guards and their buffs (armor, hp and dmg to their guards) for a set amount of time, making it possible to weaken capitals and npc response in world pvp.
---
Servers are set as fixed amount of horde and alliance players, setting a que for horde players if they go over 50% of max population while letting alliance players in, a great deal of effort is put into making it a balanced game where 60/40 is accepted but 70/30 is dealt with.
---
**Balances** are item based but some class stuff tbc-wrath like tree form added, most are not, they are kept on the downlow as most hybrids such as enhancement shamans, elemental shamans, boomkins, retri, prot paladins, getting mostly better from items that are added but still lagging behind the pure dps classes. For example paladins never receive a taunt but protection paladins get a detreath spell with a heavy cooldown they can throw on one person, having elemental shamans being about 70% of a regular dps with stormstrike added as enhancement shamans now buff the melee group properlym atleast better then a resto shaman making them less of a drag to the raid aswell as buffing boomkins with stormstrike. With the new items and small class changes hunters now do better then hybrids but still just a bit worse then the other dps classes, they do this by getting a bigger stable for pets and a bigger variation in pets (lupos not restored with shadow dmg but if you bring a 60 turtle you want the hunter in the tank group, if you brought a wolf or a cat you want the hunter in the range physical dps group)
---
Resiliance does not exists but 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 arena do and you can stand and spectace some matches going on in the actual world where the arena is. It gives very little reward wise besides perhaps a titel for champion that can be lost. 
---
Resiliance does not exists but 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 arena do and you can stand and spectace some matches going on in the actual world where the arena is and if you want to battle against the opposite faction in the arena you go to Gadgetzan in Tanaris, some matches are also displayed here. It gives very little reward wise besides perhaps a titel for champion that can be lost. It is possible in some events to play worldwide in a championship that gives nothing ingame wise and no balance is given towards it as its up to the players to find the most broken shit they can find and win that way. They compete with their character and what they can find and achive with what they have. 
---
Yeah I'm hearing a lot about the ele/resto spec. It sounds extremely fun to me
---
Noted. Thank you so much!
---
It hasn't worked for me yet unfortunately. I don't even know if my old friends plan on playing again. I hope they do. Even if they don't I plan on making a ton of new friends.
---
Pretty sure it was Saturday.
---
Interesting and I do appreciate this as I was looking up in on Shadowpriest for that very reason to see if I could make it viable for raids and such. However I fear as though you might be wasting your time here with these videos. I suspect we'll have a raidbots equivalent for classic toons as well. Just a matter of time.
---
His ubrs key video was alright
---
Awesome! Sounds fun! I'm very excited to learn a whole new class and play style for sure. I think I'm going to enjoy ele sham a lot
---
When classic gets a bit closer we'll probably start recruiting! We've been a bunch of dudes who've gamed together since Vanilla and are always down to add to our ranks. 
---
No raid guild will ever devote three debuff slots to a shadow priest, so they will do far less DPS than shown in this video. You simply won't be able to use Shadow Weaving, SW:P and Mind Flay. And that's before taking Vampiric Embrace into account.
---
Unfortunately, just about all classes will do better DPS than a shadow priest when allowed to freely unload on a target without any movement or synergy concerns. I think only enhancement shaman would place lower, and elemental shaman in the first half of vanilla where a lot of raid content is resistant/immune to nature damage. Other than that, spriest is the very worst DPS spec in the game, even if you don't take their mana issues into account.
---
550/750/800 (pre-raid, BWL, Naxx) are unimpressive numbers against a target dummy. When you then take into account the spriest's crippling mana issues and the borderline impossibility of obtaining BiS caster DPS gear as a priest, we're looking at a test that does little to flatter the spec.
---
I feel like this video is trying to say "shadow priests are actually fine!" and does so on a dubious foundation of funserver setups and a disregard of the biggest hindrance for spriests: the fact that your full rotation requires three debuff slots, which is out of the question in any actual raid scenario.
---
Yeah I agree with this 100%. Shadow is great for end game, it's what I am playing. Great for PvP and its raid damage is fine, middle of road to top if played correctly. The trick is mana management and lvl 1 mind flays if you feel your mana is getting low, lol.
---
When you say "tanking" do you mean you tanked for group questing? Or did you do solo questing / leveling with this spec?
---
80% of the time replacing shitters in the middle of raid is not possible.
---
DM contains both the Paladin and the Warlock epic mount quest chains. DM was out in EU and other regions, and the vast majority guilds did not even beat Rag before they were running DM even in the NA region.
---
They're probably referring to Bucket 2, which is a complete disaster.
---
BWL and ZG, *and* BGs and PvP rewards at the same time?
---
That's a complete clusterfuck. The smart money would be betting on Bucket 2 being broken up.
---
Hm, I suppose you‚Äôre right. I had forgotten how much simpler even something like Alterac Valley became over the course of vanilla. That‚Äôs a perspective shift. 
---
For sure sign me up!
---
Nice! I look forward to this
---
People have a very narrow view about "DM loot is better than MC loot."
---
Speaking strictly for Casters, the irony is that DM loot (and crafted gear) is better for glass cannon raid dps, but the MC raid rewards are better for PvP and open world/farming, because they actually have stats like stam and int.
---
People laser focus on spell power and +crit, and yes those items are better from DM and tailoring.
---
But if you don't want to get 1 shot in the open world, or you want to AoE farm, or you want to run dungeons without drinking after every other pull, *you want MC gear.*
---
Source: Class and loot officer for cloth dps in a Naxx progressed guild on pserver.

I think that would have been cool except I like the old models and graphics better. That's just me though.
---
I read that as awkward to victory. 
---
What's odd too is that there's a video from YT from 2006 that show the pet does NOT get dismissed until the cast completes...so what's true here?

Reading through your post was a trip! Particularly, that was the most detailed idea for player housing I‚Äôve seen and it sounds awesome. Thanks for writing that up
---
This is a given because the video game market in general is broader than it was 15 years ago. But I think that‚Äôs all an aside to the fact that WoW vanilla was an excellently designed game, simple enough for all sorts of people to enjoy and deep enough to keep people hooked to it. Human nature hasn‚Äôt changed in the past 15 years. What people loved about WoW then they‚Äôll love about it now

Yup I played on Kujata and played on the ps2 release. The only separation of region was playtimes really and like you said you'd get the shitty English groups during NA prime time that net lose exp and the good JP groups were overnights for na and using the translator built in game.
---
That makes sense about things dying off with wrath, I never played wrath but that's exactly the point I'm making that new content makes old stuff population die off. Especially when Its on a different continent like they did with wow expabsions. There is no issue with leveling content falling off in vanilla as long as things stay classic, people just roll new alts and there is always world pvp running with a populated world. It even gets more interesting actually when the max level players start coming out and it makes the world more dangerous since that lvl 30 you gank might go get all his friends to come out. Flying mounts also helped kill  world pvp too :(
---
I remember playing ffxi right when their first pvp system came out too, and rdm was the new job that became fotm for whatever their pvp system game was called
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Happened a lot with Ragnaros. I went OOM even with my own Innervate + Dark Rune + Major Mana Pot 
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that imply it did have an impact though? People were not able to down Rag until after they had DM gear.
---
There are a couple really nice talents in the resto tree for leveling. One is the +hit talent (melee and spell I think) and the other is the talent that prevents you from being interrupted when casting heals. 
---
People wouldn‚Äôt keep rolling alts in WoW if leveling in WoW was anywhere near as difficult as leveling in FFXI. Again, you rarely pushed past 30 in XI in pugs. In WoW you still do pug comment at max level. 
---
I was one of the ones who praised it, but realizing the effect it had on the community took time.  I no longer believe that game designers should always build their game around the most popular community opinions. 
---
I think resilience made pvp definitely longer in terms of the fights would last longer and you couldnt get one shot so easliy. But the thing is that that made it tedious and boring after a while. At least imo
---
That was my observation as well. Geared Disc priests were literally unkillable. Even 1v3
---
Eh, I just want a little mindless grind. I really am not in the mood for adrenaline and PVP tends to be adrenaline inducing for me. That's why I'm going PVE. It's not that I think I'll be ganked all day; I just don't even want to have to worry about it. The PVE aspect of classic is challenging enough. 
---
Yes. I play 1h shield in solo and dungeons 
---
Maybe we had different experiences on different servers or something because I only ever plugged and pugged into the early 50s.
---
Also I looked up the release dates of the ps2 release and the zilart expansion and it exactly fits what I said earlier. They were about a year apart lol. Cheers mate
---
Picky does not mean only wants to see the best of the best. WoW was never top of the line graphics but they are way easier on the eyes than many games.
---
Zilart was bundled with the US release. Check the Wikipedia page. It was only available on a JP PS2 before then. 
---
Cheers mate. 
---
100% agreed. WoW's immersion really started to go downhill once the game felt more like a story, and less like a world. 
---
With 16 debuff slots shadow weaving is a valuable raid buff for warlocks.
---
Mind flay only replaces trash debuffs like deep wounds and fireball so it can be used freely and gets outprioritized by anything important. There will always be trash debuff slots because they need to be available for weapon proc effects. Mostly importantly thunderfury's but also nightfall's.
---
Shadow word pain might be allowed sometimes but probably warlocks corruption gets higher priority.
---
Absolutely. And it basically boils down to what is fun for you and what is fun for others. For me the tbc pvp system did bring the seperation of pvp and pve which was great. But it also introduced us to resilience. And i can't say how often i was in a skirmish in a bg that just didn't end bc everyone was stacked up with resilience and the healers wouldn't die. That is at least imo not my definition of fun pvp gameplay. 
---
Not if your a tauren. 
---
I really REALLY hope this happens to me. Congrats!
---
My favorite of all of these is always Molten Core. Original devs were freaking beasts to get it done in so little time. Mahalo!
---
Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying. The world first Ragnaros kill happened with tons of DM gear in the raid.
---
Lashes seems slightly less effective as mage and priest atleast
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIGyflRlxN8
---
You can also dot grind with a healer like a real beast once you get some spelldmg but I hardly see that being more effective then farming lashers.
---
The leveling content was also invalidated by the expat, exactly like you described above with your wrath references lol.. gnight
---
Well, it could offtank quite some bosses, and smaller content. If overgeared, it could maintank.  
---
DPS was always mediocre with a lot of effort (Powershifting) and you'll fall behind pretty much every other dps aside from hunters, shamans, pally, spriest and oomkin. All of which, beside hunters, aren't really a thing.  
---
But considering how mindnumbingly boring some pve rotations are on some other classes, something engaging, despite being worse with more effort, might still be worth it to keep sanity.
---
Is this what the "great social aspect of classic" looks like?
---
Leveling content was invalidated by the fact that the leveling process was brutal and that the rewards for the content weren‚Äôt worth doing. 
---
It‚Äôs kind of sad how convinced you are that your perspective wasn‚Äôt that of a child. E.g. limited and easily confused. As, clearly, it is. 
---
30 yr old vanilla player, returning for classic. I‚Äôm in a similar boat... if you wind up deciding to go horde on an NA pvp server, hit me up here on reddit and we can tear up Azeroth sometime (going to roll a Druid).
---
Honestly. I think Blizzard is potentially flexible about a lot of things. Just based on their recent Blue update, they clearly are listening to feedback and made some changes, based on the demo feedback, already.
---
People get super doom and gloom about it, and I clearly understand why, but he Classic team really seems to have the right intentions. Plus the project is low level enough to not catch interference from Activision, so we don‚Äôt have to worry about Kotick fucking things up. 
---
DM north as a hunter will always be the best farming location
---
I feel like stuff like lasher farming or solo tribute will be nerfed in classic. Blizz might let it slide but they 100% know about how widespread it is on pservers. They also probably would have nerfed it if it was as widely known/used in vanilla and definitely would nerf similar stuff in retail.
---
Priest. Healers are always in demand. You will easily get groups, and you get access to great gear.
---
&gt;All of this while typing that message
---
nobody types while raiding. you were either a TeamSpeak guild or a Ventrilo guild. 
---
Not sure why you are trying to attack me personally, this discussion and your opinion on ffxi has nothing to do with your value as a person haha. I readily admit I was a child when playing and have terrible memory of it. I only remember the things that were important to me and the things I knew from my perspective while playing a job up to the 50s on 2 characters a few different subjobs the 30s. 
---
And to respond to what you said.. I think what you admitted about preventing pugs and making it hard to find parties is the very definition of invalidating content lol. What is your definition?
---
Lolol you should rewatch that episode! It‚Äôll bring back memories, they have it boot leg on dailymotion 
---
Rag shouldn't take that long, although I suppose at that point in progression you probably dont' have very good gear. 
---
&gt; Mind flay only replaces trash debuffs like deep wounds and fireball so it can be used freely and gets outprioritized by anything important. There will always be trash debuff slots because they need to be available for weapon proc effects. Mostly importantly thunderfury's but also nightfall's.
---
Debuffs have a built-in priority system, and to make room for Mind Flay, you have to give up more important debuff slots. Channeled spells automatically have a priority of &gt;0 so they don't just stop mid-channel the moment someone procs deep wounds or something, so Mind Flay gets in the way of stuff in the same debuff "bracket" like Thunderfury and Nightfall. That's the issue. In order to let a shadow priest use Mind Flay, you give up a slot for a more valuable debuff. True trash debuffs can be used freely, which is why warriors can spec into deep wounds etc. Mind Flay isn't 0 priority, it's 1, otherwise it wouldn't be usable at all because it would just stop channeling every time anyone applies any debuff.
---
&gt; I think what you admitted about preventing pugs and making it hard to find parties is the very definition of invalidating content lol.
---
No. People did not pug leveling content past 40 or so because the content was hard. 
---
So they joined linkshells and made friends with consistently good players. Then played with them. 
---
That‚Äôs how MMOs traditionally worked. Until WoW. 
---
That has literally nothing to do with content being invalid. It just means that you stopped being able to find groups because you didn‚Äôt understand the social aspect of the game, as a child.
---
Such an odd line of logic dude. 
---
No content in the game was designed around Fear Ward. Stop being a bunch of posers
---
This is really my thing. I don't participate in world PvP on PvP servers, and I don't want to go ganking in Redridge when I hit 60. There's not much incentive for me to play on a PvP server. I like PvP, but only in BG's where it's organized. Apart from that, I really enjoy pulling up some movie/show/anime on my 2nd monitor to watch while I grind. Being on PvE allows me to focus less on the game in contested zones. 
---
Yeah, this literally happened for me about 24 hours ago. Give it time! All you can do is put your name out there. Do you have any of their old emails? That's one thing that really helped us.
---
It's not a line of logic I was literally quoting you word for word to build on your point and ask your opinion lol
---
Actually I think playing private servers makes you less intune with what works and doesn‚Äôt work on Classic. All the private servers got it wrong
---
I don't understand your comment about the 50% que for horde players. Why cap horde at 50% and let in alliance? That would  lead to an imbalance. You have to cap off either faction once it passed 50%. And 70/30 is pretty much intolerable. At that point, rvr PVP will be very one-sided.
---
Yeah I always saw BGs as kind of lame actually. Hillsbrad PvP was sooooo much fun before they added BGs, and it more or less died off after they were added.
---
I always thought if they implemented some sort of DAoC style open world PvP it would have been so much better.
---
I would play vanilla, TBC , and WOTLK servers.   After that it's a shit show.  I quit when the fluffy pandas got released and never looked back.
---
I called VC DM and I called DM DMN or DME or DMW
---
You have never quoted me word for word, prior to this post. 
---
Best if we don‚Äôt continue. You really have no factual arguments to make and it seems like I‚Äôll just continue to upset you by proving that. 
---
Wrath was great. After that it went downhill. But everyone has a different experience.
---
Go read my post, I edited it to show you exactly where I quotes you word for word on what I consider invalidating content before I asked for your opinion what what "invalidating content" would mean in your eyes. You ignored that part though because you are so personally emotionally involved in this "argument" lol
---
I just read it. 
---
You started your post with ‚ÄúI quoted you word for word‚Äù
---
You hadn‚Äôt done that when you made the post. 
---
Are you off your meds or something?
---
SJWs are going to say that site is racist
---
I always put my first 5 points in to fury for the crit then down arms.
---
Thunderfury is a high priority debuff so mind flay shouldn't compete with it. I'm having trouble finding a source that shows where mind flay is in the priority system but afaik its the same level of priority as DoTs so at worst it will knock off one of the allowed corruptions when thunderfury proc is up.
---
But he's too cool for that.
---
You provided absolutely no justification for 1.5 being the "correct" version of AV what so ever.
---
&gt; the only people who complain are the people who play private servers religiously 
---
So, the people who are complaining are the ones who actually stand to benefit the most from DM at launch? They sound quite virtuous. 
---
I think an important point no one is making is that DM introduces not only a lot of comparable or BiS gear, along with long buffs and librams, etc. to help faceroll content, but also that DM is much easier to run than MC. You only need 5 (10? can't remember) people to run DM, it drops lots of gear for various classes AND can be completed in a much shorter time than MC, all while NOT requiring 40 people in the party (which is much harder than a DM run) OR having a weekly lockout. So farming all this gear quickly and easily is a much lower bar to clear to put MC on farm than it would be otherwise. And without BWL or anything else to progress into until the next set of instances, isn't DM being available at launch make everyone get to the "end" of MC too easily? 
---
The fact that no one knew what they were doing back then, as opposed to now where every answer a google search away makes everything that much easier as well.
---
TL;DR - I think that DM on launch will trivialize MC, because it can be repeatedly run for tons of profit, where MC can't because it needs 40 ppl, and has a lockout. If no one brought point this up cause I'm wrong, what am i missing here?
---
I don't think we're even 100% sure that lasher farming is possible in vanilla. Not because of a potential Blizzard nerf, but there's been speculation over the years that private servers have the spawn points of the enemies wrong in the instance, and that if they're in the right place, it's a lot harder to grab all the packs you need.  
---
Remains to be seen.  
---
We used to do zero sum DKP, with a slight Loot Council aspect. Each item was worth a fixed amount, when won the cost deducted from the winner, and the value spread out among everyone else. Loot went to the person with the highest total, so whenever someone won they would usually drop down to the bottom of the list. 
---
We added one extra phantom raider to the calculation to represent the guild, so the guild would collect a small amount of DKP per raid and occasionally we would spend on behalf of the guild to help outfit a main tank or healer or whoever would most contribute to future success.
---
It worked out pretty well, was less cutthroat than regular DKP, and the loot council aspect was minimal and very transparent. 
---
We were also a very casual guild, so it worked fine for us. 
---
Loot Council is probably way better for a hardcore top guild, where people are dying to be a member so they'll shut up and take what they get.
---
Both factions are capped at 50% total logged in players. So if the cap is at 3000 there can at most be 1,500 hordes logged in.
---
If there is 1400 hordes but 800 allliances online horde can still login 100 more players, and alliance 700. 
---
Blizzard takes action at once if it gets as bad as 70/30, if its 60/40 they dont see it as red alert but try to gradualy shift more players into whatever faction is low. As hordes cant login more then 50% of total logged in population  a 60/40 might resolve itself over a "short" amount of time but will still be open for action incase it does not.
---
Hope that clears it up
---
I love the extra foliage and the new water looks good. I find the new shadows and alighting a bit weird in some zones, so I may do the graphics up and keep the original vanilla lighting. 
---
You didn't veil your terrible outlook on life at all.
---
Those abused the /sit mechanic which was not possible in 1.12
---
I haven't ever thought about it in this way before this is a wonderful idea. I'm a serious Altoholic so it has always been hard for me to commit to a class but I believe I have settled in Shaman. But this congruent leveling so to speak is a phenomenal idea due to what you have stated.
---
I absolutely had quoted you - in an attempt to get you to share an opinion on what you consider invalidating content if not for it getting harder to find parties and harder to pug over time.
---
Here was my initial question where I used your own words:
---
"And to respond to what you said.. I think what you admitted about preventing pugs and making it hard to find parties is the very definition of invalidating content lol. What is your definition?"
---
And the source for that was your quote, where you said:
---
"That didn‚Äôt even invalidate it, *as much as it prevented pugs*, which I‚Äôve said several times. So yes, for you, as a person that only pugged, it was hard to find parties. *That doesn‚Äôt make the content invalid, it just means you had a hard time finding parties*."
---
To me, the game being created in such a way that over time as new content comes out and people are disincentivized from leveling new alts is the very definition of invalidating content. I feel like if no new things were coming out that people would be able to continue playing and enjoy the experience over again because there was fun in the leveling process despite how grindy and painful it may be. I found that very fun and would not mind doing it over and over again. I leveled several characters up to mid level and it got less and less popular each time as the game grew older and more things started to come out like the weird pvp system that was limited to certain zones.
---
 So to me continuing to create max level side-progression "horizontal" content is bad for a game. I feel like it should be like a board game that you can replay over and over, much like how we all hope classic wow will be. If they do end up doing horizontal content I hope that its on a separate server so you can either opt-in to it or choose not to.
---
Fully agree with you. If someone is truly a purist then they shouldn‚Äôt be using addons either. I never used a single addon in the entire time I played wow. I won‚Äôt be using any for classic either, but if I want improved graphics/models/textures that only I see and has no effect on other players, some people freak out over that - even though some of those people will be using addons that can potentially give them an advantage over me. 
---
Yes I would play it. Yes I would repurchase it. 
---
\#nochanges is a fucking meme, how can you still say that when the server starts off on 1.12.1, and probably with 1.12.1 itemization. If they add release progression thats already another change, sharding is another change, battle net is another  change etc etc.
---
I just want an experience thats as good as possible, and the private servers tha thave been doing this shit for years on vanilla servers might just actually have some experience on what works best.
---
smooth
---
&gt;and it will retain more subs.
---
Yeah, when 80% of the pop goes horde I am sure TBC will be popular.
---
I expect my guild to replace me in the raid roster after I miss 1 raid, even though I've showed up for the previous 20 raids, because my class ran late and the person who replaced me happens to have a feminine voice but somehow always manages to change the subject when questioned.
---
You can get something like 400 spell power in dungeon blues along with Hand of Edward the Odd (weapon with 0 spellpower) and "of Nature's Wrath" greens to fill in the gaps. You will actually lose spellpower from that setup if you managed to get the High Warlord set.
---
Just make sure to wear mail "Nature's Wrath" pieces and get a good shield so that you can still take a beating from melee. Your survival against Warlocks is pretty weak with that setup, but you're not really beating them as an Ele Shaman anyway. The Shaman toolkit destroys Mages even without a ton of stamina so they're not really an issue.
---
Stay far away from the people here on classic. Once you think you are far enough down the server list go about 3 more for safe measure.
---
You're right, I should know better than to feed the trolls
---
There‚Äôs a lot of guilds recruiting in here already. Some will inevitably end up on the same server. I‚Äôm sure some potential gms are in touch with one another. 
---
If you nazi hard enough, they just stop coming.  The EJ boards didn't have problems back in the day because they came down like a ton of bricks on low-effort posts.  Blizzard does the same thing on the forums, except they hammer down on any impolite posts.  Personally, I like the former a lot better, but I stay the fuck away from the Blizzard forums because I know I'll get banned every other week for not being polite to idiots.  So either way, it works to get rid of the kind of posts you don't want.
---
Depends on how I was playing at the time. If I were raiding/hardcore PvPing then probably. Otherwise probably not. I really liked TBC (raiding when I did it) but I found myself not really captivated by anything outside of raiding (and I would have been in for arenas if I had the time to do both).
---
I feel like hybrids like shaman are good for alt whores because they're so dynamic. You can do decent spell casting dps, melee dps, and healing, sometimes in the same fight.  It's like choosing Neapolitan ice cream because you can't decide between strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla. 
---
Oh I see what you mean now üòÄ
---
I'd give it a try but would probably never be serious about it as FLYING ruined the game
---
yes but I hope it would take a lot longer than a year or two
---
And yet...
---
&gt;  I've been thinking of events that people can do at any level or experience outside of raiding for fun.
---
The restriction to be available to all levels is a neat one.  Hide-and-seek in a main city could be a neat idea!  If you have a Rogue, hide in some nook somewhere stealthed and the first player to find you and open a trade window could win whatever the prize is.
---
Firetree represent!
---
&gt; So what's the best way to level using quests and dungeons, and not using a guide
---
Really, just do all the quests you find.  As long as you don't go crazy on the grinding, or run dungeons dozens and dozens of times, you aren't going to drastically out-level any chains.
---
Hi redditors, just a heads up: 
---
If you're currently trying the Classic WoW Guilds invite link via browser, there's a current issue where a Nitro window is popping up instead of the Discord's invite information. 
---
We have Discord staff looking into this. Check back soon!
---
Yes, but I would hope that they may take this as an opportunity to readdress some things.  As hard as I err on the side of #nochanges when it comes to Classic, I would hope they might take it's success to reexamine some of the aspects of TBC that ultimately led to the watering down of the game.  Flying and the beginnings of class homogenization come immediately to mind.
---
I never played BC (only xpac I missed due to a long work trip) and would love to play it.
---
That said I would *hate* for Classic servers to forcefully transition to BC.
---
If they opened brand new servers (requiring you to level fresh) or allowed some kind of character transfer / copy allowing those that want to stay in Vanilla to stay in Vanilla I would be happy.
---
They said they want as close to vanilla as possible. sharding is made so NEW players can get a better experience IN THE start only, 1.12.1 is a set point they want since they didn't have DATA before 1.12.1 so they couldn't accurately make the patches without the data so they decided not too. Itemization is a guess (yes so far we think they don't, but it sounds like they consider it still after a lot of people mentioning they should) Battlenet is a must for oboius reasons. 
---
They are trying to create a vanilla expierence that will be as close to vanilla as possible, your being naive if u think they will make diffrent type of servers for diffrent kind of players in this faction.
---
If they need to please "you" the private server crowd that want 10k servers, dynamic respawn, reduced gold to reset talents.
---
Then they might aswell also add servers for "retail" players that have "dual specs, crossrealm sharding, dungeon finder etc"
---
You need to realize what yours asking. They can't please everyone, what u are asking is just as "bad" as what retail players will be asking.
---
 (I know i take it to the extreme, just trying to prove a point)
---
Stuff like mailbox changes is because u have addon for it anyway and its just quality fix. Stuff like tradeable dungeon items is a fix because of less gm's. 
---
So yeah i get it, i played on "10k pop" private servers too, i actually enjoy it, but we can't exspect them to please everyone. 
---
Also their is no way they will ever go for this on "all servers" u legit cant do all quests because of it, like some escort if to many people is in the zone. Also some mobs are so eaisly farmable for more gold/h (devilsaur example)
---
This is my opnion atleast. I get why you want it though
---
Chime tbc????
---
I vouch for this. Female orc movements were surprisingly fluid, very fun to play.
---
No.
---
I did not enjoy the Outlands questing.
---
I think Flying ruined the game.
---
I don't like that Horde and Alliance shared the same main city.
---
I hated that all of my Tier gear, that I spent countless hours raiding to get, was instantly obsoleted by level 61 quest greens.
---
I ran the dungeons way too many times and I never want to do any of them again (I even hated doing them more recently as Timewalking dungeons in Legion)
---
I wish  my old friends would register for it lol
---
Thanks for the mention of vanilla-questing. I've been very busy with internship and uni stuff but am in the process of converting the whole thing to be React based which will make it around twice as fast. Class quests will be nuked from the standard route, but I'll add a new section where people can view the standalone quests and do them when they want to. I was kind of hoping that we would be getting some clarification what quests are going to be in at launch, but it's looking more and more like it's never going to happen.
---
Not to mention Dire Maul is the greatest source of gold in the entire game for a lot of classes. Which means a head start on screwing the economy.  
---
They said they're still working on tuning the graphics though, so I think it can only get better from here.  
---
Incorrect on all fronts.
---
I think it is an unfair expectation. We're not paying $180/year for a 15-year-old game. We're paying $180/year for a current-year game that comes with access to a 15-year-old game. Given that they have said they are starting with a base of 1.12, I wouldn't get your hopes up that we get any patches that mimic the changes we experienced in the original run. You're desires are based on your experience on a private server. You shouldn't put those desires on Classic. Classic isn't here to be your private server experience. 
---
I'm a wife and I'm way looking forward to revisiting Vanilla with my Hubs. :)
---
I miss southshore PvP
---
You can get something like 400 spell power in dungeon blues along with Hand of Edward the Odd (weapon with 0 spellpower) and "of Nature's Wrath" greens to fill in the gaps. You will actually lose a LOT of spellpower from that setup if you managed to get the High Warlord set. Even Naxx &amp; AQ40 pieces are a downgrade to Nature's Wrath greens in terms of spellpower. You can't find an epic headpiece with +40 spellpower in Vanilla - cloth, leather, or mail - but I got a green one for 2 gold on a practice server. And it was mail.
---
"Nature's Wrath" pieces won't have any stamina, so it's importat to wear mail only and get a good shield so that you can still take a beating from melee. Your survival against Warlocks is pretty weak with that setup, but you're not really beating them as an Ele Shaman anyway. The Shaman toolkit destroys Mages even without a ton of stamina on your gear so they're not really an issue.
---
Just wanted to chime in here so you don't feel like you're in an echo chamber.  I played on Alleria back in the day but I was Alliance.  I remember ToM and Toca as well.  I had a RL friend in the ally guild Surreal as they were competing with Risen at that time in BWL.  I was a filthy casual mostly, though.  It's just nice seeing someone else from the server.
---
Yeah, and first they said that didn't have any of their vanilla code either (remember that?). All competent tech firms always catalogs and saves every update, so unless were incompetent back then (which I doubt they were as they were established) then they should have the code/earlier versions than 1.12.1. But they don't want to go that route, so its another change to the game. Starting 1.12.1 is NOT "vanilla" like at all, and if they also start with 1.12.1 (buffed itemization and come-back loot) then it wil significantly impact the meta game.
---
So why not just have both?
---
The hipsters can play on their low pop servers with few raiding guilds and a lot of downtime, and for us who played on private servers and really enjoyed the huge pop servers can play that as well.
---
&gt;Also their is no way they will ever go for this on "all servers" u legit cant do all quests because of it, like some escort if to many people is in the zone. Also some mobs are so eaisly farmable for more gold/h (devilsaur example)
---
Yeah, buts world of WARcraft, not minecraft. So people actually having to contest shit seems perfectly fine to me. And Alliance usually have superioty in eastern kingdom, and horde for kalimdor so it somewhat balances out between factions.
---
Private servers have been simulating vanilla for like a decade with varying success/quality. But its pretty clear to me, and everyone who has been a part of that scene that high pop PvP servers are overwhelmingly prefered as the superior version of the game, even when they add more servers (PvP server 2 or a PvE server) people still prefer the higher pop one because the game is just more alive then.
---
Weird, I thought it was fine. And people who has been playing the game on private server for a decade also overwhelmingly prefer the higher pop realms as they make for a better experience overall (once the initial rush to 60 has settled down).
---
Vanilla imo is the only version of WoW that actually works with a high pop due to the large continents, not 10k people clustered together in outlands.
---
The honor system killed world pvp.
---
Beforehand  people engaged in World PvP because it was fun, or because there was conflict over resources (herbs, mobs, metal etc). There was no reward for killing another player, there was no incentive to do it, only player will.
---
Afterwards it became about farming honor and getting as many kills as you can, roaming around in a full group death squad and squashing any honor yielding player no matter if it was sporting or not. Didn't matter if you already killed the same guy 10 times and you were no longer getting honor from him, because your group was not going to slow down for something silly like reading the name of the players you're facerolling.
---
Only the people that actually say it think it's a real insult. For the rest of us it's just stupid. It's like being called a doodyhead or something. You sound like a little kid saying it.
---
Because it removed content and made AV shorter and more streamlined.  I thought that was very clear personally.
---
Imagine that subreddit as a guild. Just a bunch of mid 30 dads that come online once a week just to complain about how other people enjoying the game diffrently and in guildchat every conversation will start with "I dont remember it like that"
---
I would be up for arena again, and I may even try and raid in BC, but I would rather they expand the classic game as a means to keep it fresh.
---
They should prob have this for those who adopted BC as their ideal WoW time though.  Although I prefer vanilla, some noticeable improvements happened in BC, especially regarding quest structuring.  No 40 mans killed raiding for me though, I would give it a chance a second time around.
---
Resto Shamans are great. Second best Horde healer.
---
Agreed, now thats a post! Lots of good ideas
---
How can I farm rep with Hogger‚Äôs Rebellion? 
---
The original undead look cool AF
---
Oh God... I remember doing this all the time at school when asking people how old they were hahaha
---
Wait to people not duel anymore? Everyone spent so much time hanging out outside the gates of SW just dueling each other.
---
BC was better than vanilla in every way that matters to me.
---
No, outlands killed previous content
---
Give me a solid classic. We'll talk about further ideas. 
---
No I don't want to increase the normality of alliance and horde neutrality, I don't want it to be easier to trek across the world. I want 40 man raids, deeper dungeons than tbc. I'd be more for creative options and updates and changes that increase the sandbox elements, add long term depth, expand world PvP and world exploration, and so on. This is what I wanted after vanilla I got the opposite so stopped playing 
---
Some of the silliest times I had back in the 04-06 range came from in game antics - one that will always make me laugh was a specific Rogue in my guild, no matter what she tried (moving on her own or even /follow on somebody else) managed to fall off the ledges in LBRS.
---
I'm convinced to this day that her character was perma-drunk as she would constantly pipe up with her quiet self, "Um...guys.........I died again."
---
I know that this isn't the definition of silly to most, but that was always a huge guild highlight for us.
---
Well of course the people playing on private servers would prefer a massive cap. Everybody who disliked it would have quit. 
---
If you're going 4-5k, the world needs to be tuned appropriately. Respawn times in 60-zones need to be greatly reduced, material spawns need to be increased. Otherwise 90% of your time is going to be spent clustered in a group waiting for shit to spawn. Private servers solve this with dynamic respawns and just reducing material spawn timers. 
---
BC dungeons didn't feel real to me due to the hallway construction and shit design.  And don't get me started on that fucking awful black morass dungeon.  I did like Kara though.
---
Yes after a couple years only if i can copy my character of the classic server to a separate BC server that way i can play my character on both.
---
I would play bc with no flying obviously they would have to provide some portals to the instances and raids that we wont be able to acess.
---
I don't want to see TBC. I still hate those stupid hallway dungeons they made for BC and that lame city we all shared.
---
What I would like to see is parts of BC brought in as raid zones with new raids, and no flying mounts.  
---
&gt; and the vast majority guilds did not even beat Rag before they were running DM even in the NA region.
---
No one beat Rag before DM was out. Rag didn't die for another month and a half after DM launched.
---
Yeah, but they have both. Some people like 2-4k, but most people play high pop regardless of the launch issues.
---
I think Nostalrius had 2 alternate realms (one PvE and PvP) and people still chose to play on the server with 16k concurrent players because it just had an awesome community feel to it.
---
Well how much do you care about racials, and what are your plans upon reaching endgame? Pvp? Raid? Both?
---
I really loved chatting with my hunter buddies in our class channel during raids. Each class really felt distinct and important.
---
Absolutely. I like Classic, but I'm mainly supporting it in the hope that if it succeeds, they will make BC.
---
I love this 
---
New wallpaper 
---
omgfuck yes.  Most enjoyable time for me was BC
---
Pretty much this.  But hey, I'll take what I can get.  1.12 still has around 100x more world PvP than retail even with the dishonor and honor system.
---
Absolutely. Loved BC and Wrath almost as much as classic. 
---
The reason people were not able to down Rag was because MC was a ridiculous unkillable bug fest for 6 months and many guilds just gave up trying until there were patches. 
---
Our tanks had their own channel, we used to get drunk during raids because Drunkness is directly proportional to threat. 
---
The nost alternate PvP server peaked at barely 2k during asian prime time. It barely broke 1k during NA peak. Same deal with the current largest private server (their alternate server is at 600 right now.) People play on the high pop one because the other is a ghost town. 
---
I‚Äôm gonna just say no. I remember day one, and the awe factor of the new zones. I remember yearning for flying mounts. Grinding for Netherdrakes. 
---
I also had no idea at the time that each level, each thing I ached for, was simultaneously destroying my bond with the game and everyone I knew within it. 
---
Far out bro! Me and my brother are dual leveling: shadow priest and warlock. We're so excited to actually play this game and know wtf we're doing. Let's make a guild!
---
As a priest main I love healing 40man raids, always something to heal. 
---
This is too easy, the answer is more sub time.
---
100% I miss Kara 
---
No. Fuck flying mount.
---
Honestly, I've never seen one.  I'm not sure I've ever even seen a vanilla hunter PvP video where the hunter was any good.  I used to train hunters on how to PvP better, but my advice was mostly used macros for FD, now other classes abilities, and learn to kite effectively.  Everything else was just practice and experimentation. 
---
Did you play vanilla? How old were you in 2004?
---
Yes.
---
I would play each expansion as "current content" again, if it were properly supported and the rewards made sense.
---
TBC without flying is an absurd concept. 
---
RIP Harambe
---
I still remember the first time a shaman one shot my mage at 56 in WPL.  I think it was a double windfury proc or double crit because I went from trying to frost nova him to dead in about a second.
---
I don't have any solid plans in place for duo leveling, but I am really looking forward to leveling a Druid this time around, and I would really like to have either a Paladin or Mage along with me.
---
When I originally played retail vanilla, I leveled a Rogue first and my buddy that got me into the game leveled a Paladin along side me. I've got a hankering for some free buffs and/or mana biscuits!
---
link for those on mobile: vanillafriends.com
---
We had one priest in our guild that no matter what could not walk on the chain in BRM. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. into the lava. Had to be summoned into instances. I think it was a ping issue. 
---
You keep saying what you as an individual want, but there's tons of individuals who would want BC, the game was real popular then too.
---
I say that as someone who would rather expand the classic game from my own personal preference, but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be BC for those who loved that the way we love vanilla WoW.
---
Other people are downvoting you and calling you absurd but I've agreed with this forever.
---
TBC was the perfect expansion... if you remove flying. Add a couple elevators or huge staircases (thats would be sick for world pvp actually, massive staircases) whatever you need to make the environments work.
---
World PvP and the danger of faction based combat in the real world completely died when people got to "opt out" by just holding spacebar. Before people had flying mounts it was incredible.. but once people could afford them there was no more danger left in the world. No more getting camped. No more starting a fight and having their guild come out in droves to support them and the emergent gameplay of a big 10v10 impromptu skirmish out in the world that ends in one side logging off.
---
Ill stand alongside you comrade, while all the carebears downvote the truth haha
---
Yeah... It's been a while since I was there, but aren't there some areas of Netherstorm, Blade's Edge, etc that are inaccessible without flying? I get that with flying came some issues, but that's a bit awkward.
---
Are those space goat corpses I see?
---
Amen. well, it ruined world pvp at the very least.
---
LOL! That sounds like Sticky (my rogue friend). I'm sure it was something to do with a ping issue as well, but it was almost like clockwork - as soon as we got to certain areas it was basically a bio break for the rest of us while she got back to us, summoned if we were lucky to have a lock with us.
---
If any one here is even remotely into game design, I'd highly recommend John Staats new book, the WoW diary, plenty of screenshots and stories from back in the day during development. 
---
What do you mean when you say "cheesing the lockout"? Sorry if I sound like a noob, curious though!
---
I would but I wouldn't want a wrath server or any further as much as I love DKs it was the LFG that made wow decline into what it is today. 
---
ELUNE BE PRAISED!
---
I check this site every so often to see if my friend AchaeaKoralin (in case he's out there somewhere, I check via his actual character names though.) puts himself on there. We never played together, but we did talk via AIM while playing WoW for years. Hopefully he adds his characters on VanillaFriends, or he finds me through mine, I've thought about him often over the years and hope he's okay. 
---
The logistics behind this thinking are flawed.  
---
Classic's goal is to revive dead subscribers and lure them back.  Classic vs Retail at this point doesnt hurt them because its potentially bringing back pre existing customers.
---
But creating a "shadow copy" or whatever of your character would start segregating the "classic community" into Vanilla or TBC servers and additionally would also create a dearth of problems regarding a lack of things like server economy basically (ie no low level materials, recipes, etc). On the flip side it would also create a small problem with anyone wanting to roll the new races as the leveling process would be borked. Not to mention the economy could also go the other way and get glutted with people stockpiling their transfers with materials.
---
Tldr: Progressing the "existing" vanilla servers to TBC is the only balanced way to move everyone forward without creating more issues.  There's a slight argument to be had for creating TBC servers with NO transfers at all which would be the only semi balanced alternative but would still create the overarching problem of splitting the playerbase.
---
Do pirates usually whine this much?
---
Haha, why though? I get people staying away from streamers, but all redditers?
---
Agreed this is the only way it would work IMO. Character copy.
---
Please Blizzard never again FORCE us to participate in a new expansion. Being able to leave our characters on a "stasis server" as esfand calls it would be ideal. You could always go back and have your character for as long as you want. You could even whip out your character to play again a year or five down the line when a new group of friends rolls new characters, etc.
---
Maybe a year or two after Naxx lol 
---
Go female troll, it's close enough to night elf.  Elves evolved from trolls anyway.
---
There was a bug in vanilla where you could spam sit and sometimes the talent working, like 1/5 times. It was just a funny way to build reck stacks for pvp not an actual levelling technique. It never existed like it does on PS now where you just sit and activate it whenever you want. It did work in pvp until it was fixed in TBC, but again nothing to do with levelling.
---
I‚Äôd love to see TBC. But to be honest I would rather see them raise the level cap in Vanilla and create a new expansion where everything remains in Azeroth. They won‚Äôt do it because if Vanilla is a hit, odds are that TBC will be too. 
---
So if they make TBC, I‚Äôd be pumped. However I think it would be way more interesting to see them go with a different storyline from the original expansions. There is so many possibilities which I think people would love. 
---
First off there would be no need for flying. I think flying takes away a huge part of the game and makes the world feel less populated when many people simply fly up high and auto-fly toward their destination. 
---
I‚Äôd expect them to redo zones from Cata (maybe not Vashj‚Äôir and Deepholm) and also implement the raids and dungeons from TBC which occur on Azeroth (CoT, ZA, Kara, Sunwell). They could still make Draenei and Blood Elves work too. 
---
If Classic does well (I‚Äôll be doing my part to ensure that it does) I will not be upset if they just remake TBC. I just feel like they would be missing an opportunity to create something ‚Äúnew‚Äù, using the good parts of previous content. I‚Äôm no game designer, so I have no idea what the processes are to do that but just as a fan of the game, up until MoP, I would welcome seeing a change up. 
---
Plus they could justify by saying Chromie fucked with time and the story we think we know isn‚Äôt going to happen quite the same way as it did the first time. 
---
My roommate and I are doing a Shaman/Warlock combo. Should be interesting,  Best part is we‚Äôre doing it because these are the classes that we actually want to play and not something we think will have easy spots. I have a feeling there is going to be more warlock competition than last time.
---
"they teased me and called it the Atari Map", Jeff Kaplan lol
---
My girlfriend and I are planning on duo leveling for fun! I've already decided on paladin and she's debating between warrior or hunter. We know it's not the best comp but we just want to be able to play together and take the experience slow after such a long wait.
---
Except, they also lack parry/block. So they *need* that health pool since they have less ways to mitigate damage.
---
Yes. 
---
I get why vanilla has to come first but I've always prefered tbc.
---
Onyxia's raid lockout only triggers when she dies. So you could die and/or hearth as she is about to go down, leave raid, and voila, no raid lock out. So you could do the raid with 40 people, 35 hearth out. Do it again with 35, 30 hearth out. Repeat until the remainder (+alts) can't do the fight. Wait five days, repeat. 
---
It wasn't exactly advertised by guilds that were doing it, but killing Onyxia 3-5 times per raid lockout was quite doable. More, if you had alts and/or better gear. Since you want 40 Onyxia Scale Cloaks and that is 40 scales, you go from needing ~70 days to get full cloaks to more like 15-20 days. 
---
This is something I think actually SHOULD be changed for Classic. Make the lockout based on the agro table, anyone who was on the agro table at any point during the fight gets the lockout if she dies. I think splitting your raid and killing her twice with 20 people each time is fine (or however low you can go), but cascading her is not. 
---
I gotta say Kara will always be one of my all time favorites.
---
It's gonna take a while so you'll probably still need to throw a few heals. Even lvl 20 elites have thousands of hp and thorns only does 50dmg or something a tick fully ranked/talented. It would be far faster to barkskin + hurricane them or bear swipe them.
---
Unpopular opinion here: I played TBC and liked it at the time, but realize almost everything they did set WoW on the course to stop being an MMO. I think most of the design decisions for TBC was poor.
---
They killed original capitals by grouping alliance and horde into one capital. You can fly over conflicts. No more conflicts means no MMO. I'd rather have content layered into the original continents or no expansion at all. If you want TBC for class balance, that is fine, but the World dies as soon as each expansion adds a new island or a new area.
---
This is exactly what I think every time someone says tbc classic.
---
Everyone saying ‚ÄúShadow priest is one of the top pvp specs in the game‚Äù / ‚Äúyou will melt faces‚Äù is a meme right? It‚Äôs pretty garbage for any actual group pvp / premade pvp and nowhere near one of the top pvp specs in the game. The only niche it‚Äôs good in is specifically 1v1 given you‚Äôre at close to full mana at the time the fight starts, ie- a duel. I think a lot of people are in for a rude shock at 60 if they‚Äôre just going by uninformed opinions of spriests beings absolute gods in pvp and banking on that. 
---
I mean, sure you are right with most of your points, but it‚Äôs just not feasable. First, they would have to fully recreate the TBC servers like they are doing with classic. Then, they would have to fully redesign the continent with the lack of flying now in mind; and they would probably forget lots of things. Then, they would have to offer support for this game, so it would be the 3rd MMO they are running. 
---
If you could go back in time to when TBC was developed and not design it around flying, yeah, that would be awesome. IMO, a great compromise would be still having flying sometimes, a la vehicles in WotLK, but not having it all the time. But it‚Äôs just not realistic to think blizzard would ever completely redesign TBC.
---
Yes, mostly casually, raided a tiny bit, got rank 6 or something in PvP, saw Ragnaros. And around thirty.
---
(In before "you can't have an opinion unless you pretend to be a Rank 14 Gladiator Naxx-farming god who has won WoW".)
---
Ironman, btw.
---
I‚Äôm considering dual boxing either warrior/pally or warr/sham. I can‚Äôt do dungeons really with a group because I have to afk so I figure if I can 2 man some dungeons myself at my own pace that would be cool.
---
Lol I don‚Äôt play Ironman but yes well done for your meme
---
I'd have to say I agree with them.
---
I played vanilla and was 15 when it released in EU.
---
Raids and dungeons were, IMO, better and instanced/non-solo pvp far better. 
---
All (?) specs were viable.
---
That said, vanilla had superior aspects as well.
---
I will be maining a Drawf priest but st the same time me and my son will be duo leveling two hunters together when we are both on at the same time. Likely the first week will mostly be both of us working on getting the hunters to max so we both have some farming potential and money to feed the maines.
---
One of my favorite memories from retail vanilla time was the near hour long duel I witnessed outside of Ironforge between two Holy Paladins.
---
It sounds like it would be stupid, but by the 15 minute mark there was damn near a fight club style circle surrounding the two and there was makeshift betting taking place.
---
I really want that type of community interaction again - I know that there will be a lot of differences between "Vanilla" and Classic, but one of my biggest hopes is that the community aspect is brought back full force.
---
Two heals with absurd cast times, one of which has a 21s HoT component, an AoE that has to be channeled and yields copious amounts of threat. and one HoT
---
The priest has far more tools at their disposal and the Paladin can off-tank without losing access to his healing
---
If you want itemization that makes any fucking sense, classic is probably not the game you want to play.
---
If you're going to PVP you might want Undead Mage for the WOTF. If raiding, Troll for Berserk.
---
Correlation does not mean causation.
---
For example: Since 1900, the taller presidential candidate has won 20 of 28 elections. That does not mean the Democrats best chance to beat Trump is to nominate Shaq.
---
Diremaul changes the BiS list a fair amount, but anyone who thinks DM loot will destroy the "difficulty" of MC is missing the giant fucking 1.12 talents elephant in the room.
---
I put difficulty in quotes, because for MC (at least when it was the top raid available) the hardest part was herding 40 cats through the entire instance to make sure the raid lasted 2-3 hours instead of 4-6.
---
Who says EU had a bad experience?
---
I only knew wow with DM. 
---
The problem is in your head. 
---
Phase 2 is something that needs to get looked at. 
---
Dude nice
---
A "dearth" means the opposite of what you think it does.
---
There's no way to do TBC without pissing people off.  But there's also no way the bulk of Classic players will play forever without new content, and no way Blizzard can extend Classic without all sorts of massive problems, and no way they could produce an xpac's worth of quality content as cheaply as they could update BC.
---
So eventually they're probably going to release Classic TBC and just live with the crying about "splitting the community". In the end if you have to force people to be part of your "community" then they never really wanted to be part of it. The people who want vanilla forever can stay and the people who want TBC can move on.
---
So, it sounds like DM is integral to an authentic Rag experience?
---
About 50% of the population never wanted world PvP in the first place.
---
Maybe the problem isn't when DM is released, but the fact that it's a fountain of liquid gold?
---
Shadow is great in group PvP. A good shadow priest will know when to drop shadowform to drop a heal, dispel important buffs/debuffs, drop big fears in a group of enemies, silence healers and mind control people. This along with the fact that they have ridiculous burst. They do have mana issues that is for sure, but that's why consumables are important.
---
You can‚Äôt force people to enjoy world PvP
---
I was actually looking for someone to run this duo with!
---
I would do a tank/heals combo, that way you'll always have good players in those roles when you do dungeons. But there are other combos that are really fun too.
---
Sham + rogue/warrior (windfury/totem synergy)
---
Priest + warlock (shadow synergy)
---
Mage + rogue (PvP power)
---
Paladin + warrior (more pvp power)
---
Rogue + druid (stealth antics)
---
But really, any 2 classes together can be fun. 
---
A lot of people say orc warriors are the best for PvP and best looking but I think tauren warriors look boss geared up. Warstomp can work in your favor a lot as a warrior especially after a charge. Rogues hated warstomp as much as the resist stun of orcs
---
A group of people who turn up to a raid and aren‚Äôt interested in discord drama
---
Eh I guess you're right. Steam rolling through MC without a single challenge or issue in the world will help me gear up some alts.  
---
Yeah I feel like a lot of people aren't very aware of skill differences. Few hours after this video was posted, someone made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/axc16h/mage_useless_in_wpvp/). Reminds me of when I was a noob and as soon as I got fucked over by another class, i'd just start an alt of that class. Only to abandon it as soon as I saw a player outperforming me or looking cooler on a different class.  
---
Not making me sit around trying to beat 200 people to tag mobs sounds like an improvement to me.
---
Thats true, but IMO the entire game was built around it with the 2 factions hostile to each other and even playing on a PvE server isnt real world of WARcraft to me. Some of the early drafts of the game when it was in development actually had no pvp at all (whaaat), but it was a major design element that they decided to go with in the end and I think that is part of why it was so successful. I feel like WoW would not have been as popular on a cultural level as it was if they had gone with the original design of no combat with other players at all since it wouldnt really be the same game for everyone else. (Source John Staats and Mark Kern on the ClassicCast podcast)
---
I'm in the same boat, can't decide which to main though...
---
Or maybe they don't want to ship a game where 4 of the 8 classes are simply unfinished?
---
Which is what 1.1 was.
---
To me classic wow includes Burning Crusade. Wish it was included in the classic wow package 
---
Definitely not realistic, youre right. Just a pipe dream :( Hopefully one day we will get another MMO from blizzard with the same design philosophies that will be as successful as wow was. The Titan whatever game that turned into Overwatch sounded promising, but after seeing that flop I doubt we will ever see another game like that if we are speaking purely realistically and not just fantasy talk :(
---
Yes
---
TIL using the scroll wheel on your mouse is difficult.
---
These are awesome dude. Really like the Scarlet Crusade one.
---
People will steam roll it with or without dm.
---
Mc isn't challanging anymore. DM doesn't make it less or more challanging. 
---
DM is only a small part of the argument
---
Eminence \[NA\] \[H\] [PST] is now recruiting for our hardcore Horde Classic Raiding guild! Here at Eminence we are all about preparation and organization to meet our classic wow goals! If you‚Äôre like us the hype levels are in overdrive and you‚Äôre busying yourself daily with everything possible to make sure you‚Äôre ready for classic already‚Ä¶ so why not lock down a raid spot in a great community and progression-oriented guild too?
---
A little bit about Eminence? The guild is run by a smaller group Friends who have grown up gaming together along with a couple friends we‚Äôve made along the way. All of us have high level experience across multiple games in addition to WoW, holding top percentile ranks in LoL, Overwatch, Halo, PoE, and others.
---
Eminence‚Äôs Officer core is extensively experienced in ALL of classic Vanilla Warcraft, both leading and clearing ALL content from release up to Naxx, as well as high US ranked clears of many tiers of retail WoW between WotLK and Legion. Currently members are still regularly active on pservers. Our discord is always active with people playing misc games and getting to know each other better while we build up our roster for launch!
---
Eminence will be using a EPGP loot system that rewards all raiders fairly for their effort towards the team‚Äôs success. More info on exactly how our loot system works can be found on our Website Forums or you can contact Redrick through discord.
---
We are currently recruiting people who are looking to join a Hardcore Raiding Guild/Community and want to get on board early with us during our building phase going into classic! We are a guild who WILL be #1 on the realm we settle on once classic releases. We will be rolling on a PVP realm on the Horde side while aiming for a medium population server. We are looking for dedicated and prepared individuals or groups of people who share the same mindset towards WoW that we do.
---
What exactly are we talking about? Eminence is looking for focused, dedicated, and motivated individuals that have high raiding aspirations for classic and the knowledge and experience to join us on the path to achieving them. We take raiding seriously, including everything from consumables, pre-raid BiS, to min/maxing profs/builds/raid compositions, and everything in between.
---
Overall we are looking for people with DEDICATION and PASSION for classic wow and mastery of their class(es). Chances are if you‚Äôre in here reading and made it this far while on the hunt for your classic guild this early, you‚Äôre the type of person we‚Äôre looking for. A lack of high level experience isn‚Äôt a deal-breaker but it‚Äôs definitely an asset when applying. We are mainly looking for people with Hardcore Retail wow experience and/or people with Private Server Raiding Experience.
---
The goal is to build a tight-knit and reliable team of like-minded, committed individuals who want to put maximum effort forth clearing content on the cutting edge and establishing ourselves as a premiere raiding guild. If you are interested in applying or would like to learn more about us please visiteminenceclassic.enjin com
---
We are looking for dedicated Tanks especially, all people of skill should apply (through website or through us on discord). We are 30+ members strong!
---
Raid days and times (subject to minor changes)
---
Tuesday - 6:00-9:30pm PST
---
Wednesday- 6:00-9:30 PST
---
Sunday - 6:00-9:30 PST (cleanup day/ Onyxia if not weekly resets)
---
For more information you can add me or one of my recruitment officers on discord, we would love to chat!

I can recommend Druid as the grind character. I did this in vanilla with Skinning and Herbalism and that paid for my epic mount on my main, all my enchants etc. And I didn't even get it to 60 during vanilla.
---
Farming skins and herbs in cat form. As soon as you're low on HP you just turn and heal, add some hots and keep going. VERY effective.q
---
Yes. TBC is better than vanilla in nearly every way.
---
Lol you're really stretching by suggesting I said anything about full on patch progression. 
---
Yeah druid is awesome :) ty for the tip
---
As if you don't wpvp on an pve server.
---
We were regularly fighting in tarrens mill and duskwood before bg. 
---
Yes just because I‚Äôll actually be able to play my main class and my favorite spec, the spec I play is absolutely unviable in classic and honestly disappoints me. I only tank and my least favorite tank spec is prot warrior. That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt wait for anything after classic servers.
---
I'll most likely level like a pleb. I want to read those quest requests, enjoy the lore, group for dungeons and overall have a good adventure time !
---
This was ever a question? Thought they were releasing progression servers starting with classic. Never imagined they would leave them in classic forever.
---
Please PM me when you start recruiting for classic. :)
---
I was thinking priest warlock for a while but I'm thinking there are going to be a ton of them.  Might just go priest mage, or even priest prot pally.  I can't decide honestly.  
---
\*IF\* they were to release TBC, it would only be after Classic was confirmed to be a massive success (and even then, they may simply never choose to do this). I have to assume The Burning Classic would only be released years after Classic is completely done with content releases.

Because we're talking about the scale of years, I think the hype surrounding Classic could be similar to the hype surrounding a TBC rerelease; the time for a massive build-up is probably necessary. As such, if they opened fresh servers for TBC, I believe it would do well enough that it would be worth it to join in for me. TBC seems to me like an extended end-game for Vanilla WoW, as in "Hey all level 60s, go here and experience an entire expansion worth of content."  
---
I missed out on all end-game content in Classic, and all of TBC. I would love for an opportunity to experience that content one day.
---
TBC was just Vanilla, but better in almost every way. So... yes.
---
The best part of BC was class design. It hit a perfect blend. Every spec at least delivered what the tree promised. The "Hybrid Tax" was still there, but reduced to a very reasonable level.
---
Raid and Dungeon design was fantastic too. Not Hyjal or Black Morass though. Awesome important lore points, stand around and wait boring dungeons. 
---
But it also represented the first steps down a lot of roads that eroded so much of what I loved about the game.
---
The game itself was brilliant. The way it was being run was an issue.
---
Yeah, because want to play with a high pop, right?
---
They want every single fucking zone to be populated, and that just doesn't happen on 3k servers.
---
I want option to play TBC, badly. It's the best expansion, one that really incremented WoW to its peak. True, changes made in TBC disturbed some people - but, you would get that with new content for Classic as well. 
---
I will not be using pto for being in my house. I'll just have to stay up for 48 hours on weekends and jump 10 levels like a boss. 
---
All hail, Sylvanas Windrunner in her true form. 
---
I'm playing classic 90% in part just to support it so they WILL continue and release BC.
---
"as long as they don't change it at all from how I don't remember it's wasn't from all the times I never played it then it sounds great" 
---
Seriously. The conversation probably went like this.
---
Coworker: What you reading?
---
Him: a book about the development of wow, they are releasing the base game again in summer
---
Coworker: cool, I used to okay FF, let me know if it's any good.
---
With 40GB of RAM I‚Äôm ready!
---
I have some concerns about blizzlike pop and what that means when it comes to finding groups for dungeons.
---
&gt; that way you'll always have good players in those roles when you do dungeons
---
What if op and his roommate are bad players?
---
Almost all. Demonology warlocks sucked outside of leveling, arcane mages weren't so great, which rogue spec was good varied patch to patch and balance druids were pretty eh. I would put it like this - in tbc, every class had a viable spec of every role available to them at end game.     
---
    
---
Unlike vanilla where if you could heal, that was all you could do.
---
Probably but I'd much prefer new Classic content before anything else.
---
I know for a fact there were mages in vanilla doing it.  But there was some sort of a stealth Nerf that made it harder or near impossible to pull off and other camps became more profitable over time.  Now that I think of it, lockout timers was the first Nerf to try to curb solo farming instances, so gold farmers started blindly inviting people to groups to reset timers.  It was hella fucking annoying and obviously with all the nerfs it was not what blizzard intended.  
---
Anywho, I honestly don't care.  Plenty of farming opportunities, and I can't waste time farming grey drops when there are 100000000 factions to grind.  People are going to wish they had some of those hours back imo
---
I wouldn‚Äôt, I‚Äôd stay on the vanilla servers. TBC was fine, but to me it didn‚Äôt have the same feel as vanilla did.
---
Yes this is one of the things I am most interested in. I have several videos of me farming both DMs are a mage on private servers but there are some considerations in classic.
---
It is already 100% confirmed that they are using a modern client with battlenet integration and physics and such, and back-porting it down to be useable on a vanilla build. Not the other way around. So basically in order for the farming to work, blizzard would have to go out of their way to allow it. Since things like the dogs weird pathing in DM N and not just hitting you from below that small ledge will likely not be in the game even if everything else is identical to pservers, just because it involves the physics of how mobs interact with the terrain and how they can attack etc.
---
Hopefully they leave it in, but it will undoubtedly be slightly different. Those of us that have farmed thousands of times in there will likely have to re-learn everything at least a little, since we currently have everything down to pixel perfect by-the-second pathing timing and all that stuff.
---
What class homogenisation are you talking about? And TBC without flying can't work, it was designed to have some parts only accessible with flying mounts. Flying only lasting two minutes and having a ten minute cooldown would work though.
---
Easy solution - flying is still available, but lasts two minutes with a ten minute cooldown. Bam you can still access everything but it doesn't obviate ground travel.
---
Other way around. Whatever happens, level cap should stay 60.
---
I always imagined Kel'thuzad with a slick mustache, though...
---
You definitely wanna go panda mage.
---
Or you can have your cake and eat it too by progressing the current server to TBC and allowing people to transfer off into permanent Vanilla servers.
---
The character selection screen looks so much cooler having a model of each race represented simultaneously.  It reminds me of the D2 character selection screen which is badass.
---
Flying, continent that is worse than EK and Kalimdor, arena, insanely linear dungeons, blood elves, draenei. TBC is the reason why WoW became as bad as it is.
---
Flying, continent that is worse than EK and Kalimdor, arena, insanely linear dungeons, blood elves, draenei, daily quests, etc. TBC is the reason why WoW became as bad as it is.
---
you are free to remain on private servers if that is what you enjoy.  
---
nostalrius, especially in the open world, did not feel or play like retail 2004-2006 wow.  
---
I want that back, not nostalrius.
---
Thank you for compiling all resources in 1 place.
---
YES 3 years after classic, release TBC on different servers 
---
yepp
---
For me the big problem is that people can choose not to world pvp and just flying mount away from a fight that they picked once they get outnumbered... so the danger of world pvp goes away. I think your idea about the 2 min thing is good but i think they would also need a system where you cannot mount on your flying mount if there is another hostile player within X yards or something like that. Not sure how to balance it but that's the bad part of it for me.
---
In vanilla, if you pick a fight and some enemy 60s roll out you could have a whole guild ganking you before you know it. In TBC you can be long gone before the friends even show up. Hell even if there are 15 ppl camping you you can just rez behind a tree and mount up before you even load on their screen :( I wonder what the best way to fix that would be
---
I twinked my druid in bc, played the whole content as rogue but always adored the druid.
---
My choice was clearly influenced by that. 
---
As a rogue the only thing I ever saw in raids, were asses. Looking forward to ass free 40 raids. 
---
If its grouped in the same sub like classic maybe, but Id stop there if they continued to make the later expansions
---
On private servers it was.   And on classic it will be.  It makes a difference.
---
Yes if they dont stop classic server, And instead open new servers where you are allowed to copy your vanilla characters and proceed into tbc.
---
Several private servers are doing it exactly this way.
---
&gt; Almost like BradyGames realized
---
that they couldn't compete with thottbot/wowhead.
---
They should re-purpose assets from the expansions with vanilla design philosphy. 40 man raids all the way.
---
Wasnt there quite a lot of fire resist gear in dm? Dont you think it would be fun and challenging for guilds to be able to have attempts rag without that equipment?
---
This post inspired me.
---
Just added myself there and saw someone from a guild I used to be in for a brief bit.  Was on US Whisperwind-Alliance.
---
&gt; Dire Maul gear will completely trivialize an already trivial raid
---
its sure did for the 0.1% of the population that cleared MC at this point.   
---
it does not matter in the very least if a raid is cleared 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month or 1 year after release.
---
vanilla is and will be trivial. if you are looking for a challenging raid environment, look elsewhere.
---
Resillience f cked up the deal
---
As excited as I am for classic, BC is amazing. Heroics, Arenas, Hybrid classes could do things other than heal, the sweet armor sets, and of course Blood Elves. I don't care what people say, I love them. 
---
I would play it tomorrow. I miss tanking on my paladin. 
---
Thinking of doing Warrior/Rogue, might be awful to level but who knows.
---
Im not the guy you're replying to (lol @dearth)but think a good compromise would be some sort of stasis server that could hold all the people who just want to play a certain expansion forever. When pops dwindle down they could even all merge into one realm and maintain a workable population. Even if it's a shitty ghost town with no economy at least it exists in perpetuity for anyone who wants their character as a trophy or keepsake of their time in zeroth. They could even have 1 stasis server per expansion. I would never play anything past tbc myself but that might be cool for others who like the other expansions Jr anyone new that wants to go replay them all again even if they have to mainly level solo.
---
This would be perfect IMO
---
First and second one could use a bit of tweaking but the rest are amazing. And that's coming from an alliance player.
---
I'd go to wotlk even but they should keep the same xp and loot chances of vanilla/classic
---
No it's not. Stage 2 is however something that needs to be addressed.
---
Its a huge problem. 
---
Exactly. I would take the better specs. That's about it. 
---
No. There are days where I don't want to be online and would feel guilty about it.
---
No. I wanted to like BC but from the moment I accepted quests in Honor Hold and went out questing in HP, I was underwhelmed.  BC had a few cool aspects but it's not enough for me to want to put any real time into like I do Vanilla.  Vanilla was always super chill.  I never really got that from BC.
---
No, it added arenas and flying, two of the worst features ever added.
---
It also added gear catch up, and killed hybrid builds.
---
Are you sure those items are elemental and not tribal?
---
Could you post them? 
---
You couldn't summon with meeting stones until TBC. Vanilla designers famously overtuned their raids, apparently Cthun was technically impossible to kill without the nerf, so I would argue that the instance nerfs could just be the same thing, they didn't ever mean for things to be that difficult so they adjusted things. Balancing and itemization could be the same deal, they just didn't test things fully before making them live and knew they'd fix things that were off balance over time. I just say a really old Paladin PvP video from when their undead only attacks worked in PvP, consecration did a lot more damage, and the immunity bubbles didn't have that 2 minute cooldown debuff... And holy shit were they ever overpowered! The person who made the video was definitely skilled, but still, it was just insane how many people he could beat alone!
---
Totally agree about battlemasters being a clear step towards convenience though, that's always annoyed me.
---
Yes. My favorite part of WoW is fun and challenging 5 man dungeons. TBC was my favorite for this. I might be slightly biased tho, cause I mained a warlock when it was live.
---
Just give it a hefty cast time. Ten seconds sounds fine.
---
Why heal when you can do more dps that pure dps class that way ? (Well if it work in classic at least)
---
Agreed. Many have floated an Outland that is capped at 60 with sidegrade items, which is an interesting idea, but it would still split the playerbase between another continent.
---
No, BC was the first time I quit WoW.
---
Are you kidding?  I'd play that shit *now*.  
---
Spot on.
---
Part of me wants to duo but I dont want to pay for a second account and none of my old crew want to touch classic
---
More anti-gnome propaganda please, those bastards deserve to pay 
---
The biggest appeal of classic wow is to me that the server has finite content. So I can take as much time as I want, if I see Naxx in 2-3 years I'm fine with that. I am not forced to rush through the content before the next xpac is making everything useless.
---
I would love to see WOTLK much more than BC to be honest, but as other said: Only if they were totally separate servers with new characters or copies from classic. 
---
What is this link for? A pserver?
---
Copy should have repercussions though, so you can't facilitate trading gold for example between TBC and Classic 
---
Alex that u?
---
You think we dual monitors back in 2004, noob?
---
Damage-wise, Cleave is just a cheaper, earlier to access mortal strike with no cooldown...
---
So at level 20 I get a slow two handed weapon and gather rage by white hitting single targets to death and then with 100 rage cleave spam two targets to death and start over.
---
So spec fury and upgrade cleave is my advice.
---
So, you want to cherrypick which bits of patch progression to include, and which to not? And compose some mongrel, Frankenstein version of the game? And then shout from the rooftops about how your particular is The One True Correct Mix and Match of Various Vanilla Patches?
---
Yes please!
---
I started late vanilla, at the time I hit 60, TBC was out for 2 weeks.
---
So TBC is my vanilla. I liked the raids en arena. I remember disc priest was really good.
---
Good old times. 
---
Picture 1,2,3 and 6 should be "check classic wow reddit".
---
No. I have quite a few complaints about BC. The addition of Arena &amp; Resilience. The fact they added flying mounts. And probably my biggest issue, it made Black Rock Mountain completely irrelevant. No more Blackrock Depths, Upper/Lower Spire, Molten Core or Blackwing Lair. All of that time &amp; effort that went into the area/dungeons just made completely obsolete. 
---
BC has some things that I like, I enjoyed Karazhan, but I really just want that max level 60, no Flying, old world WoW.
---
&gt;Blizzard can make a honor PvP system that rewards kills of the other faction without BG's.
---
That sound like a good idea until the ranker just start to farm every flight point and quest hub all the day. If there is faction imbalance, it's even worse, you will get raids of rankers patrolling questing area killing every level 48+ leveller they see.
---
It could be good for a few week because the first few rank doesn't require you to farm honor all day but after a while it could become a nightmare and kill most servers.
---
Also its not like there is no world pvp even when battleground are up. It still happen all the time. 
---
&gt; Thats true, but IMO the entire game was built around it with the 2 factions hostile to each other
---
False.
---
The game was built as a PvE game, with PvP tacked on at the last minute, as an afterthought. The game didn't even ship with a working honor system.
---
The abuse of the sit macro sure makes it less op but even without this it's viable. Especially against rogues. 
---
A specc I'm testing the next week's is this shockadin build (with blues and a few mc epics)
---
https://youtu.be/zkF8Xz_hnoc
---
I hate to break it to you but it doesn‚Äôt make sense from a business perspective to not have the expansion progression. People will reach the end of vanilla content and at that point they face losing subscribers or releasing more content. I know it‚Äôs not what a lot of people want but it is more realistic than leaving servers up and maintaining them for an eventual death.
---
Also horde never 1v1 in the open. I always see Alliance try to 1v1 and horde run but horde always 2+v1 
---
I wish someone did kind of the same site for PS players. I met many nice people on Nost.
---
Naw. Classic is an exciting proposition mostly BECAUSE we can turn back the clock on a lot of detrimental game changes that have accrued over the years. Letting the expansions happen means the same changes we'd like to get away from eventually coming back.
---
Nice.
---
I wish I could. I miss my BE pally and tanking as a paladin.
---
Lore carries WoTLK.  Raids carry BC.  Both are garbage for different and multiple reasons.  Despite that, there is good memories in both.
---
I would not say it was "a lot" of FR gear. 
---
There were a couple of pieces scattered in the wings for head, shoulders, neck, belt. But they weren't enough, you still had to get crafted gear like the Dark Iron / core leather sets.
---
Is there a definitive answer on whether the Hunter talent Humanoid Slaying work in PvP? Thanks
---
I think it can be good on alliance priests less aoe healing and only 1 priest in raid needs to have divine spirit, and well placed lightwell can be very usefull for example on Cthun, Sartura, 4H. basicly any fight where u dont dps nonstop.
---
I really don‚Äôt think that makes sense. It‚Äôs still a server with a limited time before it is obsolete and costs more than it makes. I know this is what people say they want right now but no one will play the same content forever. Their subs tank at the end of expacs and they have very little reason to expect this would be anything different. I doubt they will put in the effort to create less and less servers when they know it has a limited lifespan. It makes more sense to just reboot the expac progression
---
No
---
&gt;or allowed some kind of character transfer / copy 
---
This is the approach that pservers have had to releasing TBC, and **every single one has died the moment TBC was released,** despite there being the ability to copy characters.
---
The release of TBC has killed Vanilla in every single instance it has ever happened. The playerbase is foaming at the mouth to kill retail Vanilla a second time.
---
This is no surprise since the majority of people on this sub are BC or Wrath babies, or otherwise haven't played Vanilla at all.
---
Absolutely.
---
&gt;50% of WoW's player base did not have conflicts, because they played on PvE servers.
---
But for whatever reason, PvP players just dismiss their experience out of hand.
---
My idea is to make two kind of servers:
---
* stasis - that stay the same expansion forever
---
* progressive - that move to the next expansion when the time comes
---
Additionally offer transfer between both types that are on the same expansion.
---
No - this is a path you don't want to go down. The splitting of the player base would be awful. Blizzard have already confirmed rolling release schedules for content in classic which means there is a good chance they will do fresh servers periodically, this will periodically drain running servers of active players. If you add the additional drain of TBC servers then the player base will become heavily fractured. 
---
As a dad that likes to play I want to be on a classic server that is active for the next 4/5 years. I am dreading the 'fresh' drama and it will be the luck of the draw as to if I pick a server that has a good long life or not. Streamers and no-lifers that play at 8+hours a day (yes you are an addict go get some help) will burn through the content and will want fresh servers within 2 years which I think will be a disaster for the community.

I love WoW but as to vanilla there are a few things that are putting me off. The first thing is the long cooldowns of certain abilities. Im okay with 3-5 min cd's but 30-60 min cd. Some might argue that those abilities with long cooldowns are turning the tables in your favor during a fight but thats the point, one shouldt wait 30 minutes just so he has a chance of winning a battle. The second thing is mount casting time and I havent seen anybody mentioning that. 3 second cast time for a mount its just too much, imagine all the seconds you waste just waiting to mount up for a day, a month, year. My opinion is that vanilla will be much more playable if cooldowns and mount casting times are reduced just like in WotLK. What do you guys think? 
---
Dire Mail isn‚Äôt a problem. Itemization isn‚Äôt a problem.  
---
People thinking BIS just fly off the loot tables directly to you have an incorrect perception of Classic.  Will there be people who spend 8-10 hours farming Dire Maul 5 times on a Saturday? Sure, but not many. Will they get their gear? Eventually, unless they give up because of loot table density. 
---
We were deep into Naxx when TBC hit and there were probably less than 5 people in the entire guild that were raid farmed BIS. As a co-Mage leader, it still took me about 11 months just to farm out Molten Core for everything I wanted.  
---
More people will quit playing altogether because of gear rarity than there will be people who are even half BIS in any meaningful timeframe.
---
Lets see how classic works out (it is not the exact same as vanilla - sharding, graphics engine etc are all going to be different from the real vanilla and who knows what more) before even talking about Xpacs for classic.
---
Till level 60 you could in theorie heal dungeons without any tallents. Aslong as you keep intelect gear in your bag for a bigger mana pool.
---
As others have already said, there's no need to respec to Restoration for healing dungeons and it's a huge waste of time and a pain in the ass to level as a healing spec.
---
No healer in vanilla WoW is leveling in their healing spec. That Priest who just healed a level 40 dungeon for you? It's a Shadow Priest.
---
That Paladin who healed a low level dungeon for you? It's a Retribution Paladin.
---
In vanilla WoW you can heal any dungeons up to level 60 in any spec as long as you have a proper gear set for healing. At low level that means +intellect gear.
---
The only thing you have to do to be able to heal dungeons is collect intellect gear through quest rewards and mob drops and put it on whenever you're planning to heal a dungeon, that's all. There's no need for you to respec at all and you shouldn't level as Restoration because it's way too slow and cumbersome to make it worth the effort, especially when you don't need to be Restoration to heal any dungeons before the level cap.
---
1.12 talents and itemization will be a non-event because it‚Äôs dependent on getting gear for it to matter‚Äîwhich takes many many months.  
---
The only reason 1.12 felt OP during Classic was because we were farming BWL for almost a year already when 1.12 hit and already a lot of the gear.
---
Millions of people have never experienced a version of vanilla which didn't include Dire Maul. North America were the only ones that had this experience and even then MC wasn't cleared until after Dire Maul was out because people didn't rush to 60 back then, it took people months!
---
The number of lvl60 characters in the EU prior to 3/7 was insanely low though.
---
If 1.12 talents make MC 50% easier then the Dire Maul gear makes it like 10% easier. People are getting upset over the wrong thing!
---
The amount of people that say "Yes" is scary, a BC release would split the classic community big time and effectively has a big chance to kill both player populations by splitting communities, guilds etc.
---
I do hope we see some updates to classic though, both balance patches and new stuff in the world (after some time).
---
No, warlock raiding was so boring in TBC.
---
not falling for that one again
---
No I want to stay in vanilla forever 
---
There were 4, all by Brady games, which I still have. 
---
On my EU server on the alliance side nobody ever called it VC, we didn't even know dire maul existed when we did deadmines so deadmines became DM and dire maul became DME, DMW and DMN since nobody never did all three wings in one sitting anyway.
---
Nothing wrong with regurgitating info, more mediums means more access for more people. If he is only sometimes wrong presumably that means mostly right.
---
It is certainly spread a lot, though I find mostly thats fine. If not I just skip bits. I like his opinions and mostly agree with them, I was very doubtful about the right click reporting for example until his video, though disagree with the proposed solution for sharding
---
I love the pic. And usually when this happens it's an accident or the pet.
---
Beat me to it. Naxx 6 months are way to short as the original was
---
TBC seems to be the time when you truely got into the game. its understandable that you prefer that over classic then.  
---
keep in mind, vanilla is a lot better for casual play then TBC.
---
Quicker than in going to play classic, and I've been playing classis for the last 6 years nearly non stop.
---
They'd be insane not to do Vanilla-TBC-WOTLK 'trilogy' servers that last 4ish years.
---
It will impact the private server experience but it won't impact the 2005 experience we remember so the question is which experience they cater to.
---
I find it kind of amazing that these people level on PvP servers all the way to the cap and just never figure out how to handle these situations.
---
Smoke up grind won‚Äôt take long 
---
This is why I gank with more than one rogue, if you're already going for unfair fights you may as well stack the odds.
---
The copy would be one way and one time. You obviously couldn't have a 61+ character copied to Classic servers. Making a one time copy is also a given. 
---
I'm assuming the scenario to you is this: A player decides they want to copy their character to TBC and knows someone who doesn't want to transfer. They mutually decide to transfer but give the unwanted character's money/items to the other player's wanted character. The person who continues playing Classic gets the other player's Classic money, and the TBC player gets another toon-ful of gear as well.
---
But worrying about this is silly. It's like if someone was qutting and before they quit they decided to give all their gold to another player. One player has two player's worth of gold (that's all legitimate) and this is perfectly okay with Blizzard. And then if that player who quit wanted to come back they will have to grind those funds again. This parallels the idea that if the player who didn't transfer wanted to play TBC after making this transaction they would no longer have funds on the TBC server. Same thing if the player who initially transferred to TBC wanted to play Classic again.
---
Bit then, if people would rather play TBC than vanilla, who cares? I'd play TBC and WotLK sporadically very happily despite flaws they have. Most of the content is great.
---
It's not like blizzard would just update the vanilla servers to do it. Some brand new ones and some clones/transfers.
---
I made an album will all three spec paterns:  [https://imgur.com/a/Mj5PN1e](https://imgur.com/a/Mj5PN1e) 
---
@OP Leather working is not really lucrative except for the epics, so you shouldn't be looking at the blue patterns . The epics from elemental are mostly for tank feral druids (2 of them being fire res gear) which is not something you'll see a lot so it's not that usefull unless you are youself going to play feral tank.
---
Tribal has a belt and a cloak that are best in slot for all healers for a really long time.
---
I don't know much about dragonscale but i'm pretty sure the dragonscale set is BIS pre-raid for hunters and the other epics don't look bad either.
---
So you can see why almost no one goes elemental, except if you're a feral druid there's no point taking it while the 2 other specs are really great, even if you don't need the paterns you can still make money selling them.
---
Is Blizzard trying to recreate the private server experience though? I'm not entirely convinced that they are.
---
I suppose it depends how well they handle the vanilla servers. 
---
Also would I be playing on my vanilla server character onewards? Or would I have to start fresh on a new server? Maybe even export my level 60 character over to the new server.
---
you could also fly over mobs. conflict does not necessarily mean PvP.
---
lets say you want to reach a crate or another object of interest in vanilla then you have to fight your way to it.  
---
in TBC you landed on top, killed 1-2 mobs at best and were done.  
---
there a pretty big difference imo.
---
More people play regularly on private servers than play concurrently on any steam game outside top 10
---
It came out before people had hit lvl60, that's essentially the same as releasing them together.
---
&gt; And people who has been playing the game on private server for a decade also overwhelmingly prefer the higher pop realms as they make for a better experience overall
---
100% disagree. I've played on undocumented servers for years from vanilla up to WotLK and I despise the 10k super servers.
---
I also know streamers and plenty of other regular players I've made friends with who hate the mega populated servers.
---
For me 4-5k cap is the maximum I would be willing to deal with, any more than that and the game starts to get annoying to play without making massive changes into spawn systems and even then it usually doesn't solve the problem.
---
&gt;Did you play vanilla? How old were you in 2004?
---
Wow the arrogance, he is allowed an opinion. As someone who raided vanilla hardcore back in the day and got 3 bosses down in Naxx before the guild imploded and had cleared all but C'thun in AQ40, I loved TBC. The class design was fab, a lot of the raids were brilliant and some (not all) of the dungeons were good. I raided all vanilla as a holy priest and loved being able to go shadow in raid. Some of the zones were awesome for the time and although noone really understood the negative impact of flying, getting to fly for the first time was truly epic. As a mid thirty year old are my opinions valid enough for you. 
---
No. Flying mounts arena and resilience ruined any world PvP and took value out of bgs.
---
There's only a few 70-only spots that are genuinely impossible to access without flying mounts. You could very easily get around that by just making a path up the cliff or even just placing a quest-unlocked teleporter/flight path (like for example Tempest Keep).
---
Yep I guarantee the WoW category on twitch will be bigger than any other game for at least a week. First couple days double the others.
---
in 2014 there were over 100,000,000 WoW accounts created. Probably 150 mil by now. A lot of those people will try out Classic because their favorite streamer
---
I had kinda hoped that if WoW ever officially "ended" they'd do a sort of seasonal thing with all the expansions over the coarse of a few years. Sort of like how Diablo 3 does it, you have 6 months to do as much as you can before the next expansion rolls and your character rolls with it. Then you have the option to move that character to the live server if you want at the end.
---
The content within each stage could definitely be time gated. They do that in retail WoW too, 8.1 came with a new raid but you couldn't access it for a very long time.
---
TBC/WotLK without flying except areas designed entirely around it would be a fun experiment. Put in more taxis etc, static bombing run loops for the few quests that need it.
---
What's wrong with arena or the added races?
---
you only do twice as much as the estimated required DPS for patchwerk.
---
its not ENOUGH
---
The items will be in their final 1.12 state so this is not true.
---
&gt;I think Flying ruined the game.
---
But you did not know that at the time.
---
We had an amazing experience. Dire Maul being out didn't reduce the epicness of Molten Core, in fact I think it made the overall experience better to have more dungeons to dive in to between raid nights.
---
I think more about new fresh classic servers every 2 years, and merging the old ones.
---
I'd prefer it to classic tbh. As much as I love vanilla, to me BC was just an improvement in every way.
---
But yeah as others said I don't want them to make it a forceful transition, just a character copy option would be perfect.
---
&gt; Yeah, because want to play with a high pop, right?
---
No, people simply choose the lesser of the two evils. No one wants to play on a server with 1k players where you can't find a group, but many of those players (like myself) don't want to play on a server with 10k concurrent players either.
---
It just comes down to choosing the lesser evil of the two, and usually the high pop server is the better option because at level 60 you can somewhat play the game via dungeons and raiding and things of that nature, but the ripple effects to for example farming in the open world are cancerous.
---
Just because people choose the high pop server doesn't mean it's perfect and flawless, people just pick those servers because they have no other options. In the end it's still better than being on a server with 500-1000 online where you have to spend 5 hours looking for a group but that doesn't mean a lot of players wouldn't pick a lesser populated one.
---
I'm currently playing TBC where the population is usually between 2-5k and when it peaks at 5k stuff like outdoor farming starts to become super annoying to the point where I try to farm things like herbs during night time when only 2k people are online, because it's much more enjoyable when everything isn't farmed to shit and even at that many players you still have competition.
---
fire resist pot, fight over. Vanilla Pvp was wonderful because it was so unbalanced, but every class could be made competitive through the use of consumables.
---
as long as the bosses die eventually and we don't spend 6h raiding I don't give a single damn what you or anyone else is doing.
---
human female mage if alliance
---
ud male mage if horde
---
meta has shitty cast animations
---
Absolutely not, BC ruined the story and lore of the game. It also made the best map an MMO has to offer Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor irrelevant. They could of added new locations that were previously off limits or even new quests to keep high levels going back but instead EK/Kali were completely abandoned for a much less interesting Outland. Hybrid tax was also removed making pure dps classes less appealing. I'm hoping if classic is successful, blizzard branches classic in it's own brand new direction that stays true the original vision of WoW.
---
The first "playthrough" took people a very long time too, I think 15 days /played is being generous, I remember it taking me 19. 
---
If you leveled in 15 days and had a lot of free time outside of work/school being able to play for 4 hours every single day on average it would still take you 3 months to reach lvl60.
---
Ding ding ding, we have a winner!
---
If I could just play vanilla forever, I'd just do that. If given no choice, I'd play BC, as it was good enough. If similarly given no choice for WotLK, I'd unsubscribe immediately.
---
Personally I hope that, if they go with a Classic TBC, they redesign it to fit vanilla design philosophies (no flying mounts for starters, but there's lots more in which TBC diverged). Just delivering a carbon copy of TBC makes everyone want a carbon copy of WotLK to follow, and I don't think we want to go down the road of doing so with every expansion. If anything I consider Classic a chance to fix what went wrong in the design philosophies.
---
how is arena bad?
---
 A very good friend and I both played Vanilla, but didnt knew each other back then. We are totally hyped to play it together this time.
---
He will be a rogue like in Vanilla and I will be a priest like in Vanilla. In the meantime another friend I didnt knew back then, joined our hype train and he wants to revive his warrior again.
---
We dont plan to rush it to fast, because both are freshmade fathers. We know, it is harder to coordinate, but we plan to keep our levels near enough and worst case: have alternate solo characters. But always group play &gt; speed.
---
I am totally looking forward to enable a warrior and a rogue to be my never stopping killing tools.
---
Ahh and going Dungeons with these godless, lazy Martials. :-D  
---
God I am hyped again...
---
the difference from human to gnome warlock is 5% int which is, at BWL lvl, arround 0.2% crit. manapool hardly matters.  
---
95% lol
---
Regularly versus concurrently. I think I spotted the false equivalence. 
---
I so want to roll human warlock, but I can't give up mage.  
---
if only to try the synergy of Perception and Paranoia.  
---
no amount of +stealth will save rogues from this.
---
Make it three years instead. And no purchase, include it in the subscription, like Classic.
---
My prediction is that it'll happen. Eventually all expansions will be released as servers. Even generally not liked ones have their fans. And I'm sure that later expansions will require progressively less and less work from Blizzard (because they'll have better backups :). It's a no brainer for them, really. Relatively little investment, huge payoff. A lot of people will basically never unsubscribe because they can play their favorite expansion(s).
---
(Also, if Blizzard is not completely incompetent, they'll be separate servers. No forced transitions.)
---
Ambitious! 
---
Nope. Couldn't even stomach BFA to hit level cap in it. Haven't really enjoyed retail since before Firelands came out
---
But retail is awful 
---
Just play Witcher if you want a single player rpg
---
No. I want 60 to be the level cap forever.
---
Simple answer: Yes. Love me some BC.
---
Boring answer: Depends on primarily 2 things: (1) how this would divide the community and (2) how we would agree to stop snowballing through expansions as "Classic". 
---
I‚Äôve always found alliance to be the 2v1ers and unfairly attack horde when they have a huge advantage 
---
Fem troll frw
---
Yeah just did it with mage warrior on private server.
---
Probably druid rogue or druid hunter in classic.
---
nothing of this scales with SP.  
---
not trying to crush your dreams, I only want to prevent you from wasting your time.
---
One spell? Buddy you should be spamming decurse in between frostbolts.
---
bUt pVp pLaYeRs r mEaN!!!1!!!11!!
---
I still find enjoyment when playing Mythic + with my friends, and BGs.
---
I don't think I could stomach WoW if I had no friends in it.
---
ROFL thanks :-D 
---
Yeah rolling female human warrior and I don't care what the meta is.
---
Kara in Classic and we get the best possible scenario. 
---
Flying in tbc wasn't as bad as other expansions because the majority of players never got epic flying because it was too expensive. Since the standard flying was only 60% so most players just used land mounts.
---
I'd argue that the final nail in the coffin for wPvP was making base flying 150%. That's when all the land mounts disappeared.
---
This is not a business-oriented project though, but a passion-oriented project. Else they'd at least have mentioned it during the financial investor mumbo jumbo. 
---
Looking for a squad to play with.
---
EU / PvP / Alliance
---
Played back in the day, stopped a few weeks into cata, dipped in and out of vanilla past few years. 90% rolling druid at this point. From UK, 27, something between social and decent progress, I work full time and some weekends so can't no life it as much as I'd like to, let's go. 
---
Some one hit me up, I'm bored of seeing NA PvP guilds now. 
---
Wouldn't simply adding new content be cool? Make draenei and belves playable after awhile! Maybe have zones like Hyjal or the Twilight Highlands that are visible on map become implemented into the game! I agree with what you've said about new continents so I would be wary of adding Northrend or Outland, but there's so much more to Azeroth than other continents!  
---
See 2007 Runescape for examples :)
---
Right but once it is out don‚Äôt you think investors are going to want to know what the long term plan is?
---
YES
---
for me personally tbc was the best addon and i would even prefer it to vanilla 
---
Classic is casual friendly, it just has a weird habit of turning people hardcore.
---
I've never been a huge fan of space goats fantasy. I'll stay on Classic, and really hope servers won't be "upgraded" to TBC. And certainly not after 2 years, 3 years is a strict minimum, or content will feel like "YOU HAVE TO RUSH IT BEFORE IT'S GONE" like we have on pservs, or BfA with its timers / Raid Progress.
---
I'll probably wait for WotLK to give it a shot, or Cataclysm because of nostalgia -catakid lol- (even if it has a 1% chance to drop).
---
A big issue is TBC set the precedence for dailies etc sort of deciding what a player should do each day etc.
---
Yeah, but I'm not going to rush through the classic content in only 1 year.
---
Make it at least three. 
---
No.. As much as i loved TBC raiding back then i finished all of them. The rest of the xpac was terrible, Resilience and arena. The flying which makes the world to small, same with portals to places. The catchup epics, and splitting all dungeons up so much instead of combining them like BRD etc. 
---
I literally sourced my comment lol you can go say false to john staats if you want, not me. Go listen to that podcast episode with him and mark Kern and also the one he did solo. There were absolutely 2 camps of people with different opinions on what was the right decisison, pvp or not, but there was a long desperate appeal email written from some of them to their lead who agreed with them and chose to go with pvp in the end and that's part of what made the game so successful IMO
---
Not only was it confirmed by Mark Kern but it was also confirmed by Kevin Jordan (a former vanilla WoW dev) that the population cap was 100% a game design decision based on how many players they thought would be appropriate to fill the world based on the size of it and that it wasn't a technical limitation.
---
Yes, but having that 5% increased mana pool for a lock means that is 1 or 2 lifetaps you don't have to do. That's 1 or 2 GCDs you can save to instead cast more shadow bolts. The mana and spell crit/dmg isn't the idea its preventing downtime and increasing dps.
---
3k is the sweet spot for me. Once the server settles a bit I want there to actually be peaceful spots to level where you aren't swarmed or forced to share with other players.  It's also the right number for plenty of high level guilds.
---
I'd want cross-realm battlegrounds put in eventually to compensate for the BG queues, just like they were in original vanilla, but I think the timeline on them can be moved up a little bit. 
---
Sure I can jive with that. Anyone playing long term like that has their own farming methods and you could even strip them of all mats in the banks and bags too to just start with only your character and any other bop gear you have.
---
No. But I plan on playing other games like cyberpunk 2077. So hype. 
---
I would not be surprised if they eventually buffed hybrids, I know the thought of tampering with the sacred 1.12 talents will ruffle some people, but if you don't think they're going to eventually make some changes you're just being naive. Hell I wouldn't be surprised if they nerfed Mage DM:E farming, and hunter tribute farming.
---
&gt;Some brand new ones and some clones/transfers.
---
This is exactly what pservers have done and it has killed the Vanilla servers in every single case.
---
Why do you think retail will produce a different result?
---
I'll just quit playing at that point. I want a full-circle experience, not a neverending WoW oroborous.
---
At the end of Q4 though, technically this year, but might as well be 2020.
---
Horde got pallys, alliance got shamans. I kinda liked that each side had their own side specific classes.
---
Definitely want cross-realm battlegrounds, but I don't think they need to come out right away. I think in the first 6 months or so of the server lifespan everyone leveling, gearing, and world pvping it's better to keep them out for a bit.
---
Definitely would like to see them before the live timeline though. 
---
Yes, i would play it. BC had some interesting class design that would be good to revisit.
---
TBC was the puncture wound that killed WoW.
---
Giving both factions the same classes killed any sense of uniqueness and faction dynamic.
---
Resilience gear ruined PvP and the expansion in general killed off world PvP. 
---
Flying mounts lead to less exploration and turned the game into more of a drop in - drop out lobby. 
---
The only things I really enjoyed from TBC can be added as content to Classic without the need to raise the level cap. 
---
TBC was designed in an age when the idea was that if players didn't have to grind again they'd lose interest in the game. WoW is an online casino with a very fancy store front (your dungeons are your slot machines and you win loot every now and then) and that's what really keeps people coming back. Just add Kara and CoT to Vanilla and it will be good for years and years. 
---
You didnt get flying until 70, the whole levelling experience was on land. I think they could find solutions to getting to the necessary inaccessible parts
---
Why do you think it matters if people would rather play TBC? Guess what, if 90% went to TBC and stopped playing vanilla, that's A-OK! That means they'd rather play TBC which they now are. This is a good thing!
---
They are happier, the community on vanilla is better off, everyone wins. Having a "fake" large community isn't nearly as appealing than a dedicated smaller one.
---
Around 25-30 in hillsbrad you can pretty much 1shot clothies with a dagger rogue. Highly recommend grinding to R3 this way to get the 10% discount.
---
Well said!
---
Excited for Cyberpunk myself. 
---
I‚Äôve basically quit other then checking the BMAH and doing fun runs with my guild every few weeks or so. I REALLY hate BFA the whole expansion feels almost like a Legion patch and nothing more.
---
Hopefully. This would be of great interest to fellow Australians and associated locals I'm sure.
---
night elf warrior is the way to go (or dwarf xd)
---
&gt; I don't care, the pop cap was a technical limitation
---
No it wasn't. So far Mark Kern and Kevin Jordan (2 people high up in the vanilla WoW design team) have confirmed that the population cap in vanilla wasn't a technical limitation but 100% game design based.
---
They thought that the server cap was the amount of people they thought was appropriate to fill the world at any given point without making it feel too empty but not too overly populated either.
---
Both of them have talked about this in the ClassiCast podcast, so if you want a source you can watch both of those interviews and they both very clearly confirm that it was a design decision and not a technical limitation.
---
I hope its nerfed
---
Expect a lot more dps
---
I've tried the various pops. I've also played on private servers for years (quit playing retail WoW at the end of WotLK, so a decade ago now). 
---
I hate the 10k super servers, I also have plenty of friends I've made on private servers who share my view.
---
I also know a couple of private server streamers who have done hardcore raiding up to Naxxramas who also think that the population on mega servers is a problem.
---
I would think all of these people qualify as "veterans" so if I was you I wouldn't be making generalizations. I can personally deal with a cap of 5k maximum and even that can sometimes get a bit too annoying to deal with.
---
Obviously you can't just make a 5k cap and leave it there, you also have to make changes to the spawn systems and what not to even make it tolerable in the first place. And even then often times it has downsides.
---
Your source actually invalidates your claim that the game was built around pvp.  Your source explicitly states that it was added on later, after appeals were made.
---
What are you talking about? Dire maul is almost completely irrelevant with 1.12 itemization.
---
For example, here's warlock prebis with items in 1.12 state bucket 1:
---
- Head - UBRS
---
- Neck - Strat live
---
- Shoulder - Scholo
---
- Back - Strat live / BRD
---
- Chest - Scholo (tailoring pattern)
---
- Wrist - Green with +21 sp
---
- Hands - tailoring boe
---
- Waist - BRD
---
- Legs - LBRS
---
- Feet - Strat UD
---
- Fingers - Scholo, BRD quest
---
- Trinket - UBRS quest, UBRS drop.
---
- Wand - Strat, scholo
---
- Weapon - DM (OH NO CANCEL DIRE MAUL)
---
I'm not gonna check every class but I'm 100% sure that with all items being in 1.12 state no class has their prebis mostly come from dire maul if at all.
---
The game isn't even out and people are already foaming at the mouth to kill Classic. No different than the retail zombies eager to see Vanilla WoW stay dead.
---
I'd rather have them really incorporate future raids into classic, keeping max lvl at 60 and adding just a bunch of stuff to the game like how they were planning dragon isle, kara, and outland in the first place
---
I suspect by Day 4 I'll be in my early 50s.
---
Aww man. Congrats!!
---
Honestly, retail isn't a game I would pay a sub for.
---
That said, (Crap I'm turning into Ion)
---
Retail will have new stuff that comes which is essentially going to be 'free' so, what I figure I'll end up doing is this:
---
* Play Classic.
---
* Retail releases new stuff, - keep playing Classic.
---
* Retails time gate is over, - play through anything in retail that mildly interested me (Cutscenes etc...) ONCE, and don't even bother if it doesn't appeal to me (I can see this being common). 
---
* That'll only take a day/evening so - return to Classic for months.
---
That's basically my theory. One day every few months I MIGHT run some of the new content if it perks my interest.
---
I mean, everyone always says it's good that Classic is included in the retail sub. But for me, I'm paying a sub for Classic, Retail is just this free thing that comes with it.
---
Right soo... you have no reason other than.. ? .. I don't know? You're champing at a non existent bit to rag on people who aren't here about something that doesn't matter one iota, and your only reason is that you think it is because people actually, actively want to kill Vanilla? Are you ok?
---
Are you able to actually answer any of the questions posed? For *you* why does it affect *you* if people who would rather play TBC played TBC and not vanilla? Or are you just going to keep on the retarded circular logic that only one version of classic can exist? Just how insecure are you?
---
Nice, lucky both of you :D
---
How often did you have to reach a crate or an object of interest after you level capped in Vanilla?
---
Simply copy the whole server. You can't abuse it. You can always go back to playing classic or join in on TBC later. 
---
So game based on 2 opposing factions that are fighting each other is not enough evidence for it being a pvp based game? Just because pvp systems were added later on doesn't mean they weren't planning it/was afterthought. You were able to pvp day 1 you just didn't have any real incentives besides its just lore that the factions are fighting.
---
Funny. My very first character ever was a rogue. I still have him. Thanks
---
Did hunters use more melee attacks back then? Can't remember üòÄ Of does that sword proc off of ranged attacks aswell?
---
Druids can farm DME but as said in the thread it might be changed in classic
---
https://youtu.be/rttXIFcLv2o
---
its only smart to allow transfer to a BC server or make a fresh server etc after a couple years of wow classic. 
---
In the Vanilla timeline, the two factions are hardly doing shit to each other.
---
If anything, the game is full of cross-faction groups, that work together to defeat common enemies. The Argent Dawn, the Cenarion Circle, the AQ War Effort, etc.
---
The faction war only becomes an actual thing in WoTLK. And even there, it's more along the lines of minor skirmishes.
---
Man I would be set for life with that. Kara was my favorite raid hands down.
---
Now wait a second there, buster
---
i hate 40 mans personally
---
too many voices on discord, too much competition for gear and lets face it, theres only 20-25 people doing all the work and the rest are stragglers, hangers on and just leeches.
---
10/25 man is the perfect sizing imo
---
Or warlock no pet, melee only
---
It feels like they removed a ton of chance on hit effects in the current version?
---
I did large amounts of adventuring. I would often go chest hunting. Some of my best finds (blues/epics) were from random world chests.
---
I guess it's between rogue, hunter, warlock and shaman. I'll look into their abilities/talent trees later on
---
While I agree they made a good choice moving to 25/20, 40 is still pretty fun. 
---
I actually talked about that with someone else yesterday. Essentially, if I could decide what Blizzard should do I'd have them implement TBC, but at level 60. Each zone would release on a new patch and not be for leveling, but a new quest hub for rep, new items, the story, etc. Basically like Silithus, a new end-game zone. Shattrath should also not have things like AH, thus keeping the capitals of Azeroth relevant. Dungeons and raids would also be included in the patches and of course we get the TBC class designs. No flying mounts. It's basically the idea that people have often come up with about after vanilla they should make new content in the style of vanilla - but instead of all new I'd like Outland because honestly there is amazing lore and potential.
---
Of course this would never happen and it is a massive redesign of the whole xpac, but to me that would be the final dream.
---
Probably not during BfA.
---
I'll always be open to a new expansion but BfA doesn't appeal to me. I want the social aspect of classic WoW.
---
I would stay on vanilla as long as I could.  I thought BC came out way too soon at the time as my guild had just started naxx progression when the release date for BC was announced, which basically killed all motivation in the guild.
---
While the gear is already very good, what really makes Dire Maul OP is the buffs. They should probably delay it for about a month-six weeks, just to make first MC &amp; Onyxia clears a bit more interesting. 
---
For the people using the argument:"it was out on EU launch" We are pretty far removed from "EU launch" as is. Replicating that launch would also mean: disconnects being frequent, talents being progressive for the sake of being progressive &amp; a whole other sack of trash that nobody would ask for. Reason you dont want DM-T out on launch is to make initial raid clear just a bit more difficult. 
---
Probably concurrently too across all private servers
---
Yep - We're doing Warlock / Priest :) Then I'll have a Druid on the side for levelling solo
---
copy - you have no money on new server. default 60 greens.
---
ONLY the character copies over
---
You could say the same about any game really. If you think of any big name console title, it's actually pretty rare for people to finish them. They just want to be casual and there is nothing actually wrong with that.
---
IMO the worst outcome would be a cadre of "private server elite" lording it over the "filthy retail casuals" because that's the kind of BS that actually turned me off retail.
---
Yeah, gonna "citation needed" on that.
---
hello kitty orc costume , show off to your friends only 19.99
---
it is activision after all:)
---
I did. I thought it was a great idea at first, then after a few days the world seemed much easier, the enemy faction was no longer a threat, I seemed to be detached from the world and it was no longer immersive. Flying mounts really did make me feel disconnected from the world I was playing in. I liked a lot of things about BC, but overall I didn't enjoy the game as much.
---
Well, it's fun how people like different things. But I'd say druids in vanilla were really a victim of poor implementation of a good idea, partly due to non-druid mechanics like HoT overwriting reducing them to Healing Touch bots.
---
As for removing the hybrid tax, I honestly don't think they did that in TBC - they just rebalanced it. In vanilla druids were vastly inferior at everything but healing (and even that they were not the best at). You ask why play rogue or warrior or mage in TBC? They *were* stronger for their role than druids. The reason druids were viable in TBC (in PvP at least) were because of the hybrid abilities. Hybrid tax means you are worse at a single role, but makes up for it with additional toolkit. A mage were undeniably better at being a pure dps caster, but a boomkin could off-heal or go bear form to sustain itself. 
---
There absolutely were hybrid tax, but in vanilla hybrid tax meant "you are simply worse", in TBC it meant "you are worse at a single role, but makes up for it with off-roles". In my opinion, the later is how a hybrid tax *should* be.
---
But hey, awesome you like vanilla druids - for nostalgia I wish I could enjoy them.
---
Me and a couple of friends still do ‚ÄúGz ding 28‚Äù or whatever the birthday may be. Gonna be *epic* to finally say **DING 60 BOIS!!** in 30ish years. 
---
I'd rather they just added the TBC mechanics and Azeroth based TBC content to Classic.
---
If I'm going to alternate with anything else Warcraft related, it'll be Warcraft 3: Reforged.
---
I was balance in vanilla, but didn't play hardcore back then, just enjoying the game. I had fun, but now I'm older and play a bit more serious. Still gonna be casual in Classic, but druid is too much for me, so Hunter it is!
---
You could make the encounters scale with the larger raid sizes as well. Making Kara a masterclass 25 man would be so epic. 
---
Just keep all bosses but with each encounter there is a flood of undead swarming into the tower (near the boss) which keeps half of the raid engaged in protecting the parties that are fighting the boss. Kind of like Onyxia but with constant and more interesting whelps. 
---
We just scaled Kara to Classic*. 
---
*Some slight additional complete changes might be required
---
I know, right?
---
I really don‚Äôt understand why so many people on this sub want BC which is the first step stone that killed WoW : KA/ EK and gears become irrelevant, Flying (world PvP died), arena, linear dungeons, daily quests, dungeon finder etc. 
---
BC is everything that goes against WoW Classic ¬´¬†no changes¬†¬ª. 
---
I agree some horizontal updates could give a fresh air after a few years, but why Yes to BC?!
---
Try hard and think why dead Vanilla servers might be an issue for a fan of Vanilla WoW.
---
Only classic has been announced. No other expansions. 
---
I really don‚Äôt understand why so many people want BC which is the first step stone that killed WoW : KA/ EK and gears become irrelevant, Flying (world PvP died), arena, linear dungeons, daily quests, dungeon finder etc.

---
Could you do a Feral druid theoretical max dps?
---
Would be highly appreciated!
---
We need at least 4-5 years of Classic before we can even think about transitioning to a new expansion
---
That‚Äôs how you end up at the bottom of the dps list. 
---
Pom pyro happen only once every 3 min and isnt even a garanteed one shot depending on what class you want to use it on.
---
Too many voices on discord means you don‚Äôt have a solid enough raid leader. Discord during raid should be mainly reserved for shot calling and cheering! 
---
Thanks for the reply, very informative. To your experience, how does disc priest play when taking a more outlasting approach? Like how resto druids don't do much damage but are still excellent outlasters. Mostly for solo- and group world pvp (:
---
I think if you are worried about a 3 second cast time
---
for mounting you¬¥r in for a ride. 
---
classic in general is way more timeconsuming than retail.
---
Whats next? drop health of mobs so you can farm faster...
---
sure its quiet during the boss fights / pulls etc but downtime / trash clearing etc its still too many voices carrying on
---
just too many cooks in the kitchen 
---
Yes make BC and Wrath servers 2 years apart from classic release with a transfer mechanism that would preserve the classic server 
---
I 'like' BC but not anywhere near as much as vanilla. So I hope not tbh.
---
They should have already asked this. Just because it's a "passion project" does not mean it's free to develop and maintain.
---
Yea I'm thinking disc/holy is the way to go, especially for early lvl 60. What's PI disc healer like in 1v1? Merci
---
Tbc had decent wpvp though
---
&gt; TBC seems to be the time when you truely got into the game. its understandable that you prefer that over classic then.
---
It's also understandable if BC was objectively better in all the ways that matter to me. The PvE content was far better, there was far more to do, the most objectionable time sinks were toned down, it was just a better game.
---
The few trivial whines that get repeated here are all so petty as to be almost meaningless, unless you really enjoy griefing people as they travel.
---
&gt; keep in mind, vanilla is a lot better for casual play then TBC.
---
Bollocks it is. Everything worthwhile in vanilla was still there in TBC, and TBC actually had worthwhile things for casuals to do at 70.
---
The only part of the original design choices that WoW has been true to has been the new races.  Somehow, WoW has continued to print racials that are interesting and new, and while they have iterated on the balance, the racials always make your race feel a little different than other races in most content- sometimes all content.  
---
Other than that, it would look wildly different.  We would not have seen gear scaling like we see on live, and we likely would live in a world of more continuous gear.  Expansions would likely not boost your level by as much, and I still have no idea what hero classes were going to be, but they sounded cool.  
---
I would also have liked to see the number of specs expand horizontally, rather than each spec becoming so much deeper each time, but I don't know if they really intended that ever- it was just how it looked to me at the time.
---
Here‚Äôs what a Nostalrius developer has to say about this. He isn‚Äôt worried about loot trading or sharding, but DM on release does worry him:
---
I do have some design concerns. The main one I have is itemization, in terms of what items will be available at what time and what their stats are at certain points in the game. If 1.10 dungeon items (such as Diana's Pearl or the turban from Drakkisath) are available at the outset, power levels of players will go up by a lot. MC/BWL are pretty easy as it is and making it easier is a concern for me.
---
This I 100% agree with.
---
It would have to be this way, character copy would be too open to abuse.
---
I'll throw in a recommendation of &lt;Guide&gt;. Founded by a few Fellow Danes I joined as member a Little while ago, and we are looking for more warriors for our growing community. MC first reset is the dream, and we are currently practicing Group leveling strategies 1 to 20 on our test server, where we will also practice raids etc.
---
If you are looking for the true hardcore endgame experience, I can wholly recommend it. [https://discord.gg/vRAWtu](https://discord.gg/vRAWtu)
---
&gt; don‚Äôt you think investors are going to want to know what the long term plan is?  
---
No, because you don't need one.  Classic WoW, once running, will have an absolutely negligible cost, and anyone looking at it will find that there's at least some subscriptions that only exist because of it.  As such, it will be clear that maintaining such a server indefinitely will be just fine.  
---
That's not to say they won't eventually look past vanilla in some fashion, but that there won't be any need to answer to investors when it comes to something as simple as maintaining a vanilla server that is part of a paid subscription.
---
No, you try hard and actually explain why you give a shit if people who would rather play TBC.. played TBC.
---
Why are you so bent out of shape over the idea? Are you *so* insecure that you think the only way to have people to play vanilla with is to strong arm them into it? Christ man, there are fucking millions of people who want classic, server population is not going to be an issue, ever.
---
But if people would rather play TBC, fucking let them, you won't win any prize trying to Stockholm people in staying on vanilla. Come on, give me one damned reason why you need to obsess and attack over the idea that people are trying to **kill** vanilla? Come on, just one reason..
---
Incontinence pads so you don't waste valuable wow time going to the toilet.
---
It's effectively free to maintain, certainly compared to any MMO under active development.  Develop, no, but remember this isn't some f2p project- there will be subscriptions that *only exist to play vanilla*, and that will be obvious.  
---
I agree with this, perhaps progress to future expansions and have people vote for what content they want ( like EQ), maybe even scaled encounters as someone suggested. People dislike chores ( dailies) dislike replacing the entire world of Azeroth with an island each expansion and limit people to one capital, not to mention make all old content irrelevant. If these issues are addressed, progressive servers would be a hit IMO.
---
Started playing in BC, blood elfs are fav race, definately would play tf out of bc, but i am concerned about wpvp and stuff.
---
Best possible variant - BC servers alongside Classic servers. Ability to copy/transfer characters from one to another would be nice i think, so players or even guilds could experience the full path.
---
No 
---
i am going human rogue. while this is very good for pve, i am concentrating on pvp. and in pvp human is pretty much the worst class for rogue.
---
&gt; Resilience gear ruined PvP 
---
How?
---
Certainly.  In my opinion, TBC is superior because it basically fixed nearly everything broken in Classic.  Also, I never got around to getting the full Alliance experience of anything after Classic, so that'd be a big thing for me.
---
The only egregiously bad thing to me about TBC is how flying mounts were handled.  They should have been much, much more restricted in how they could be used, but oh well.  That doesn't kill TBC for me.
---
&gt;No, you try hard and actually explain why you give a shit if people who would rather play TBC.. played TBC.
---
Because it will fracture the playerbase and kill the left-behind Vanilla servers, just like it has every single time it has even been done, even with optional copies.
---
How many more times do you need me to repeat this to understand?
---
I think it's too early to talk about or make a plan.  Once the game has been made, and vanilla finally exists again, then I think people will have a better sense of what comes next, if anything.  If there's some huge portion of a now-huge vanilla playerbase demanding BC, well, that remake project is ultimately no different than this one.  If instead it's a small core of vanilla players with the occasional player stopping by to play for a small amount of time, then probably no one will be clamoring for BC.  
---
Overall, it doesn't matter as long as there's still vanilla servers.
---
Forget it dude he's been drowning in his pserver world. Many people in his case lack logic.
---
&gt; Flying (world PvP died before TBC was over)
---
About 50% of us PvE players don't give a goblin fart if world PvP dies. And there were meaningful world PvP objectives to fight over if you wanted. "World PvP died" is code for "griefing people who were travelling and camping their corpse died". No loss IMHO, but YMMV and if that's a big part of the game for you I see why flying mounts ruined it.
---
&gt; continent that is worse than EK and Kalimdor
---
I thought it did the job it intended to do. I thought it was interestingly alien, varied, and made good use of the third dimension.
---
&gt; insanely linear dungeons
---
Okay, this I just do not get. As in, I am totally fucking baffled.
---
In vanilla you got lost in non-linear dungeons that looked the same in every direction because they had four textures to work with, and fought bosses with no mechanics. In TBC you didn't get lost and every single boss had some kind of interesting mechanic that changed how you had to fight them.
---
You were given a massive upgrade in actually interesting gameplay, and you are whining that it's all spoiled because you can't get lost any more. I just cannot understand someone who plays a MMORPG and has those priorities.
---
&gt; blood elves, draenei,
---
Thumbs up to both of them. And horde paladins and alliance shamans. Blizzard never, ever got faction balance right and they never would have. They did the right thing by just giving both factions both classes - although I still think it's bullshit they didn't let you play tauren paladins and dwarf shamans because they wanted to force you to buy the xpac.
---
&gt; daily quests
---
They were a great way to encourage people to group up and run dungeons, which let latecomers do their dungeon quests and attunements and things. Plus they spaced out attunement and rep grinds so that no-lifers couldn't do them all in a week. Thumbs up again from me.
---
Retail has some pretty cool lookin zones and raids
---
THAT SAID
---
I will ofc never play retail because it sucks and classic is the shit
---
I consider being able to fly in outland an adventure of its own (and so is the same for probably many others here). Are we wrong?
---
It made PvP skill-based and made the best PvP gear a reward for PvP skill.
---
Which was bad for people who couldn't lrn2play and couldn't faceroll people with raid gear and couldn't get all the best gear by no-lifing and premade-dodging any more.
---
Advancing on classic would make more more sense then just repeating the same mistakes and fragmenting the community.
---
Vanilla servers will not stay dead. There are a lot of passionate people. 
---
Even now you have unofficial vanilla and tbc servers. Played both, no server is dead. We have no reason to think that this will not reoccur. Therefore we have no reason to be afraid of servers dying. Calm down.
---
Yes yes yes.
---
I‚Äôd play the shit out of that. 
---
I see you can repeat very well what every other elitist / pserver assholes are screaming all day. Good boy.
---
&gt;Forget it dude he's been drowning in his pserver world.
---
i don't ge tit. whats wrong with having played pservers? i'm thinking of trying because i love vanilla. how is playing vanilla a "lack logic"?
---
im new to the scene but as far as i understand pservers fans was the reason the new vanilla wow was considered in the first place.
---
Well perhaps when you can actually muster the ability to answer what I'm asking?
---
Why are you so little in faith that vanilla will absolutely DIE of DEATH, until it is DEAD, if people who would prefer to play TBC. Holy fuck dude, fucking try reading and then answering the questions instead of proving what an insecure little baby you are by repeating something that is irrelevant to what has been asked.
---
Shouting something louder doesn't make you more correct. It makes you look like a retard.
---
If people drop Vanilla for TBC, and stay there, then they would rather play TBC yes? And the people who stay on vanilla? They would rather play vanilla, yes? Is this a fractured community or is it simply two entirely different ones that you are desperate to force into *your* preferred version because? I don't know? This is what you fail to answer.
---
Why. do. you. care?
---
I've been playing in EU from day 1. TBC is my prefered expac by far. I am mental?
---
&gt; Thats true, but IMO the entire game was built around it with the 2 factions hostile to each other and even playing on a PvE server isnt real world of WARcraft to me.
---
(Shrug) So what? About half the population chose to play on Normal servers. You can opine that half the people who ever played the game weren't really playing the game but it's an absurd attempt at gatekeeping. By any sane definition Normal WoW servers are just as much WoW as PvP servers. I mean, they're even called "Normal". They're the norm, PvP is the exception.
---
&gt; Some of the early drafts of the game when it was in development actually had no pvp at all (whaaat), but it was a major design element that they decided to go with in the end and I think that is part of why it was so successful.
---
I think you're half right.
---
Half the reason it was successful was you could play on a PvP server if you wanted. The other half was that you could plan on a Normal server if you wanted and not deal with gankers. Both made it popular.
---
If they share the same launcher (and they will) it's going to be a little bit complicated figuring out how mods will work between the two games. Probably safe to assume that most mods won't be compatible between retail and Classic. Hopefully they implement a way to automatically switch between mods. 
---
I'll check retail out. It will be fun to putz around and listen to Joe Rogan talk about bigfoot with his stoned buddy while I farm for old mounts and enjoy stomping on content that used to be hard. 
---
I would but only if I could copy my character over. I want to be able to have one main who grows, who I can invest in. So I wouldn't want to start from lvl 1 on a new TBC server.
---
However I also want to be able to continue in Vanilla, so wouldn't *transfer* a character permanently.
---
Yes, TBC would be great.  I much preferred the TBC raids, and the class/spec balance.
---
I still think all vanilla servers should be moved to TBC, and new vanilla servers created which players can transfer their character to if they want.  This is only if wow classic is a huge success and could support servers for each.  
---
I think the same should be done for WotLK, but they don't need to release expansions after that imo.
---
At the latest pserver which is being progressed (with optional copies to TBC),
---
the *moment* TBC was announced, not even released, the server's population crashed drastically, entire guilds died and merged, and the general consensus is that the server "died," even though there is of course some percentage of the population which are holding out.
---
What will happen when TBC actually drops? The same thing that has happened to every other pserver and retail server that has progressed to an expansion.
---
The remaining server dies.
---
But why? When TBC released, there were lots of 60s with gold etc. And losing items would mean losing sentimental items (say Blizz eventually progress through all the expacs, and you end up wanting items you got in Vanilla for transmog. Or you simply want to be able to switch to your favourite gear set for hanging around town. Or for RP purposes)
---
And NO gold at 60 as you enter Outland makes no sense, because people starting at level 1 on the TBC server will have amassed gold and resources by the time they hit Outland. It's set up for that (e.g. immediately buying profession upgrades, expensive new skills etc.)
---
I'd rather have a season system, where a realm would be started up, players play through the entirety of vanilla, characters are moved to a "forever-server" and then the season resets from the start.  
---
That way, if you want to keep playing your t3 kingslayer rogue you can, but you could play a character for the new season as well.  
---
  
---
Though 2 years might be too long for a "season". Should probably call them ages instead. First age, second age and so on.  
---
What‚Äôs a gym
---
I liked the thought initially but it would make the server somewhat obsolete, more of a self contained time capsule once you do that copy.
---
You wouldn't be able to level on the old expansion rules and progress to TBC later.  You're just stuck in the now dead-end classic only world and would have to create a new character under TBC rules.
---
You had to be either a PvP player or a PvE player. 
---
Before you were just a player.
---
So if you wanted to do one thing and one thing only this was great but the only outcome was Blizzard creating another retention tool forcing players to grind both PVP and PVE regardless of if you were going for high pvp ranks or not. 
---
PvP itemisation in Vanilla simply meant greater stamina pools so you were never really at an advantage or disadvantage simply from having a certain type of gear. 
---
In Vanilla you could raid in PVP reward gear with some extra hit items just fine but after resilience was introduced that stat took up stats that would be overall beneficial in both PvE and PvP.
---
This is a great way for a developer to make sure that you will spend time playing their game, as that's what they all fight for, and in WoW playtime literally equals money.
---
I want to do dungeons to get better gear so I can raid. But I also like PvP so I have to do BGs and Arena to get better gear so I can PvP as the gear from dungeons won't cut it. And these itemisation paths only lead further away with time. 
---
In short: you had to grind for two sets of gear if you wanted to play the game instead of one, making the game take up x2 of your time. 
---
TLDR seems to hit the nail. They will make a calculation: How many classic-only people who have quit Classic will return for TBC and how many classic only people will quit Classic in a hissy fit when the classic server progresses. If that number is much smaller (which I think it will be), they \*will\* progress into TBC. And possibly into WotLK even after that, although that will be years in the future and nobody can look that far.
---
&gt; as far as i understand pservers fans was the reason the new vanilla wow was considered in the first place. 
---
It has nothing to do with the fact that a lot of them are extreme still, wanting to impose others their ways to play and meta, or shitting on others if they don't do so (see some of the "meme spec" threads on this sub). I mean many pservers players are sane. It's just sometimes it seems to give them too much of a sense of legitimacy when talking about Classic, whereas tons of people who have stopped playing around WotLK and have not played in private servers are at least as legitimate to talk about Classic as well.
---
About the "logic" part I said, just watch the guy's post. It makes no sense, it is just an emotional thing. He's not actually answering the other guy whom he is talking with. "Kill Classic..", "but..but pservers have done that and it failed!". WHO FUCKING CARES? Classic won't be any private server.
---
Arguably half Classic player base will be willing to play TBC and even WotLK for some. Who are we to stop them? Just go play on a private server if you won't be happy. It has only been a discussion (!) about giving people the choice by copying their character. It's either that or the same people will simply quit Classic eventually.
---
See? This is a post that has arguments and makes somewhat sense,
---
nothing I stated suggest that you can not genuinely prefer TBC.
---
How do I deal with the mana?
---
Thanks for the reply brother!
---
Isn't it sort of selfish to say, you can't play TBC because it would fracture the version I prefers community! So you have to play something you don't enjoy as much or nothing at all! Getting rid of us TBC players could be a good thing for vanilla purists, most of us want class balance changes and getting rid of us would put much less pressure on blizzard to change vanilla.
---
Don't get me wrong I loved vanilla, it was great in a lot of ways. To me personally though TBC was like adding chocolate syrup and sprinkles to it, and even though I don't like sprinkles much (flying mounts) the chocolate syrup makes up for it (class balance, arenas). At the end of the day you can get either flavor you prefer! 
---
And honestly yeah the player base is gonna split either that or they will just quit out of boredom which is the nature of having a stagnant game, but its going to be so big compared to Pservers that it won't matter that much, you will still be able to find plenty of groups and raids in vanilla, they may end up needing to do some server mergers down the line regardless of what they do, but there will be diehard people playing vanilla for years to come.
---
There was very little skill in tbc arena.  My stunherald proc‚Äôing was literally my teams win condition when I pushed glad.  Specs were all insanely imbalanced and broken. 
---
No, Classic forever
---
It procs off of melee, its useless for PvE but very useful and fun in PvP where the reality is you'll be meleeing somewhat often. https://youtu.be/j4gsk4MNn0k?t=232 is a good clip of it in action, though I would recommend watching the entire video if you're interested in playing hunter.
---
Probably for a short time. Then go for vanilla private servers.
---
Yes, and J.Allen Brack was also 100% right when he said people don't want to spend 2 hours spamming trade chat to find a group for a dungeon.
---
Not that guy but I have some feelings on it
---
Wow combat and classes were never designed or intended for balanced 1v1/2v2/3v3 etc
---
People whining about arena balance have probably been the single biggest negative force on wow balancing for over a decade; I take arena to be directly responsible for the loss of class uniqueness and limitation of tools by class.
---
Once you know what abilities to use in what situation vs what class and you have your macros and gear, there‚Äôs not a lot of difference in skill or play style that actually goes into arena. People can disagree but it‚Äôs pretty true. There shouldn‚Äôt be a large difference between how 2 top retardins play, and precision isn‚Äôt valued so much as loading up the right abilities on your GCD. WoW‚Äôs not some twitchy, muscle memory game like CSGO. It‚Äôs an MMORPG. BGs make sense in an MMO; you get to bring every class and they have a unique use. Small scale deathmatches, not so much. Just my 2c. I
---
I appreciate that PvPers want an even playing field in which to train pure combat, but making it the primary form of PvP over BGs put things down a weird path. I also hate resilience; bursty combat is more exciting to me, as is being able to use raid gear in PvP and PvP gear in raids. I always felt gearing in vanilla had the implicit motivation of becoming a PvP god, instead of just gearing for the sake of higher dps in pve so you can get groups for the next tier so you can further increase dps etc.
---
Hey guys! I‚Äôm looking for some insight because I am stuck between a few options.
---
Right now I am mainly stuck between Holy Paladin, Resto Druid, Shadow Priest, and a possible hunter.
---
I‚Äôm Alliance and have always loved healing, but in BFA I like Shadow Priest, but Resto Druid has always been my main.
---
I‚Äôm casual player, play for several hours a day usually, and pride myself on my pvp healing, and would like to do the raids eventually, but that‚Äôs not really a priority for me.
---
So here‚Äôs my questions, for PVP and PVE what are the pros and cons of playing Holy Paladin vs Resto Druid; and equally as important, how are their rotations.
---
If I was to play Shadow Priest what is that rotation like; and what is end game like for Hunter?
---
My friend that I‚Äôll play a lot with will 
---
proabably be a Tank Warrior if that allows anyone to add insight.
---
I know this is a lot, but if someone could give me some insight I‚Äôd really appreciate it! This commitment in Classic to a character is so much bigger than retail, so I want to know what I‚Äôm getting into!
---
One last note: I don‚Äôt really care about being ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù, and don‚Äôt care to play what is easiest; as I‚Äôve seen threads where people are told just to play Holy Paladin because they are good and simple.
---
Thanks to any responders!
---
&gt; There was very little skill in tbc arena. 
---
Then how could I be stuck at 1050 as a shadow priest with a frost mage partner? Checkmate dude. The only explanation is that (a) it's skill-based and (b) I suck.
---
(And also I was playing from a very isolated part of Australia in the days before Oceanic servers, so my ping was horrific, but I did suck.)
---
2y is too early
---
Yes, I would play both Classic and TBC. Vanilla was perfect because the game was community driven, no X-realming here and there and a lot of world PvP / server events was arranged.
---
TBC was the best exapansion for the gameplay, all classes talent trees were useful in some way and no one was really that OP. The raiding was amazing and arena was a great addition.
---
I would play both!
---
Personally TBC has been the best version of the game by far. Yes, I do like the clunkyness of vanilla and yes i totally like that things didn't have that many effects and whatnot. But TBC actually brought class diversity which is the single biggest thing that I like about it. The content was also pretty damn hard and there was SO MUCH to do. With the Black Temple and Sunwell we've had some of the most memorable Raids in existence.
---
So yeah, I'd even prefer TBC over classic. But I'll enjoy classic nonetheless. 
---
As far as the HOW is concerned, it can only be an optional thing. I'd go as far as to say that they should possibly release an evolution server about a year down the line. This server would AIM to transition into TBC after another 18 months or so. That way people would have enough time to re-level a new character that they'd like to play in tbc.
---
I don't think allowing character copy is a good thing. Mostly because guilds on the classic realm couldn't be sure about which people would suddenly be "gone".
---
My general advice on any budget gaming rig is to build last year's best set up.  It'll be 75% cheaper and will be fine for this generation of games and most of the next. Wow isn't a particularly demanding game client wise either. Any half decent gpu will work. Only real must have is an SSD drive. 
---
That‚Äôs not checkmate at all, you played a shit comp.  tbc was literally dependent on what comp you played, items you had, and rng. 
---
Yes!!  Classic and bc is all you need in this life and all the lives to come 
---
&gt;Just because people choose the high pop server doesn't mean it's perfect and flawless, people just pick those servers because they have no other options.
---
Except they do have other options, there is usually lower pop realms on private servers as well (nost had 1 or 2) and people still wanted to play on the higher pop one.
---
&gt;Just because people choose the high pop server doesn't mean it's perfect and flawless
---
Its not perfect, but its a lot more enjoyable for a lot of people, and the world feels much more alive.
---
&gt;I'm currently playing TBC
---
Yes, I agree. But thats a TBC related issue (small continent, flying, portals etc.) Outland, Northrend or any other expansion continent is not well suited for a huge population. It only works in vanilla due to the vast areas people can spread out in. It does affect vanilla somewhat as well, but its 10x worse in TBC due to 90% of the game being on tiny outland.
---
&gt;I even know some private server streamers who don't like the overpopulated servers either
---
Yeah, because they stream on high pop PvP servers, ofc they are going to get ganked. But thats their choice as streamers.
---
&gt;This isn't just my opinion either, a lot of people who I've met on these servers also share my view on the population topic
---
So just have both. Huge server for people who likes the clustered epic feeling of 10,000 people competing over resources, and having raid-pvp in the open world. And a few hipster PvE server with a 1-2k cap for the retail experience, and spamming trade chat for 5 hours. And having the option of joining 2 raiding guilds per server.
---
&gt; This is not a business-oriented project though, but a passion-oriented project 
---
I am sorry, but you must be innocent.
---
People like you, that think that Classic WoW is a passion project and not a business project are either very young (young enough not to understand how the world works) or really, really uninformed.
---
Classic WoW is, 100%, a BUSINESS venture.
---
They didn't mentioned it in ANY shape of form simply because it would lead to consequences that they canot control. Imagine the uproar from current WoW community. They would perceive Classic (they already do, even if nobody said it) as a direct threat to their pinata single player loot, if ActiBlizz would have said that Classic is going to be their second MMO.
---
Imagine the uproar from Classic community, perceiving that Classic is going to last only for like 2 years, than go to TBC or Classic-like new content.
---
Imagine the investors. They will know that while a company can run 2 MMOs, in theory, if they are very different, it cannot run 2 MMOs that are under the same title. One of the MMOs will DIE, and the investors cannot know which one will, HOW, and how LONG it will take until it dies. Or maybe both games will feed on each other, instead of complementing each other, leading to financial loses.
---
What ActiBlizz did was logical. They know that Classic will bring in a lot of money (MAIN REASON why Classic WoW is a thing) , but they do not know if it will be bigger than retail, or smaller. Regardless of the success or not of Classic WoW, ActiBlizz is in control. They can say "it was a passion project", if Classic is not successful, or they can say "we always knew that Classic had the potential to be a great game", if Classic is successful.
---
To assume that a company that make $7 billion / year in revenues, fires 200 people in January, and another 800 in February, milks their player base with microtransactions, because their former flag-ship game is a disaster in term of subs, is releasing a 15 years old game because of passion...you are too innocent of a person.
---
&gt; herbalist
---
like people in endgame content?  
---
imagine "object of interest" is an instance portal or a location for a world buff, like the felwood plants.  
---
&gt; You had to be either a PvP player or a PvE player. 
---
If you had very limited time to invest into the game, I guess you had to prioritize one of them yeah.
---
But you fail to bring up any positive impacts it had? I'd argue that PvP was made a lot more fair and balanced with the introduction of resilience. It actually gave the game a competitive PvP scene. 
---
To get BiS gear for some classes you didn't HAVE to PvE and raid for it. You could actually get mostly BiS gear just from PvPing, which is what most PvP-only players want.
---
I guess there just isn't a "one-size-fits-all" for such a big game.
---
&gt;Their is no way they will make "dynamic respawn and non"
---
I know, they are doing sharding instead.
---
That happened to the original vanilla, due to "what's the point to play now until tbc" i think. With static vanilla this won't happen, if we are to believe unofficial vanilla and tbc servers which coexist and have big populations.
---
So, if we have perma classic, nothing will die if we suddenly will get a separate perma tbc. 
---
Maybe I didn't understand you correctly at first, and you mean the situation of MASSIVE AS F population on classic, due to alternatives not being there. I can see where this is coming from, but i must bring to your attention that there are alternatives at the very start of classic this time. You have the main course game, you have all the unofficial servers for all the expansions. Which brings us to the point that classic servers will be mostly populated by dedicated people after the nostalgia trip eventually dies and classic content goes stale due to no updates. I don't think there will ever be such a long lasting surge of players in Classic like it was back in Vanilla until the announce of TBC, which killed the population, as you claim.
---
doesnt matter, most dm stuff is still better than mc loot.
---
I thought Trolls were Elves at one point
---
Okay?        
---
What does this have to do with classic?
---
Ok, cool. Wouldn‚Äôt have thought of that. Cheers. 
---
I will play and support Classic in hope of getting TBC servers later because it's a superior version of the game in my eyes than vanilla, especially regarding end-game, much much better class balance and raid content. 
---
No beta ,no private serveur for me.
---
I want to make the final experience as fresh as possible.
---
The cap is sort of irrelevant to me, I want to have an ACTIVE player base of 3kish at 60, whatever cap they need to install or whatever sharding they need to do in order to make sure they have healthy populations at 60 so that we can avoid server transfers as much as possible.
---
Opened it to be like "for fu..." Then read this work of absolute truth
---
No. But I play on ps.
---
Elwynn has enough quests to get you to lvl 12 or something, you sure you don't mean Westfall and Loch Modan? Along with Redridge Mountains you can't go behind too far with the quests. 
---
i dont get it, how would they benefit from it?
---
What I loved about Vanilla was the organic world it created. And I guess that's what I felt was lost with that harder line between the two game modes. 
---
Personally I thinking it could have been balanced in better way leading to PvP being more fair and competitive by just balancing classes and tweaking itemisation and rewards. A new stat was probably the easiest and fastest workaround though. 
---
Read the title
---
And why is that bad, exactly?
---
And feel like a god while you commit genocide in WC or RFC with a bunch of lowbies following you in their wake.
---
And see your helpfulness rewarded when you notice you have a good rep with many players ;)
---
In the lore, everything was trolls.  If it came from Azeroth then it was once a troll.  The well of eternity mutated the local Zandalari trolls into elves if I recall correctly.  
---
Here's some good lore stuff.

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/10858675927
---
I‚Äôm a beta in real life so probably
---
yeah, i get that Blizzard is the 'big bad' but what is the relation to classic?             
---
Seems more like r/wow material.
---
As fresh as a 15 year old game can be
---
Ok, try to back that with some references.
---
Because more content is good and really short AV matches are bad?
---
World PvP was already dead in vanilla when Battlegrounds came out, and people in general got tired of the mindless zerging that Hillsbrad etc. were. Only ganking and fights outside raids were world PvP (and those happened in TBC too).
---
Daily quests were a lot nicer way to collect gold than exploiting Dire Maul.
---
The experience of TBC includes EK and Kalimdor still, wouldn't expect an expansion to double the content.
---
Yeah for sure, just kill flying mounts and dailies :)
---
15 years after vanilla people are still playing it on shitty knock off servers. Will the population die down for awhile after the hype ends? Yes. But there will always be an interest in vanilla.
---
Some of us enjoyed a longer style battleground with more objectives and options. 
---
The way of getting gear through badges and ratings is much better than just grinding honour though. Any joker who has no life can complete the rank 14 grind, but getting the high rating gear from arenas and later rated BGs is much better imo. Also the gear keeps updating, the blue and even epic gear sets from vanilla PvP were quite outdated by the time of AQ, even BWL in some respects. 
---
I'm not 100% sure what resilience does so I don't know if it's good or not. My problem with vanilla PvP though is that by the time people are running about in AQ and Naxx gear they have gained so much offensive power without gaining any defensive power at all. A PvP geared warrior during MC/BWL will have almost the same HP and Armour, resistances etc as a Naxx geared warrior, only the Naxx geared warrior will hit way harder, probably one-shotting people. I guess that's fine if those two meet in a duel. Obviously the Naxx geared player should have the advantage. But if both players are wearing AQ/Naxx gear then it just becomes a race for the one-shot. A mage will pom pyro anyone into the ground, a rogue won't even have to stunlock anymore, just a sinister strike and finishing move is enough, warlocks will seduce, trinket, soulfire people for 5k, 6k even 7k when people are still running around with about 4k health unbuffed. 
---
I prefer the long and drawn out fights where you get to do more before killing/dieing. 
---
Sure you can put it like that aswell, but its more aimed at people who just dismiss the nochanges crowd.
---
I cannot speak for earlier patches but in 1.12 fear ward as a 10 min duration, 30 seconds cooldown and there's no limit on how many targets you can put it on.
---
I'm \*exactly\* the same as you, except for the fact I'll be rolling Horde. Curious to hear the answers!
---
I would 100% purchase burning crusade again.  
---
I was on the race to get my netherdrake and I never got it because Wrath came, then Cata.
---
Burning Crusade was my Vanilla and I want to go back. I wanted full tier 6 warlock gear. I wanted to kill Kil'jaeden... but no, wrath happened and then the rest. Now I'm slowly leveling up my warlock only to get a small fix. But I can't wait to go back into classic.
---
There's also the (arrogant) pvp-players of course who insist that you can never have a complete experience if you play pve. *Both sides* have their annoying players.
---
In the end it's pretty simple:
---
PvE: You can PvP whenever you want, but only world PvP when *others*  want it. Side effect: You can't PvP when people annoy you or compete for resources.
---
PvP: You can PvP whenever you want. Side effect: You will be forced into PvP when you do not want it.
---
Most rogues are terrible. Truth. That being said when you do finally find the one who knows what's up they will make your life a nightmare :( so pick your battles wisely.
---
And finally the portal from Atiesh becomes useful.
---
If I can ... I don't think the beta or whatever will be widely available at all. They don't want players to play the beta and get the "experience" then to not play the release.
---
But yes, I would love to play the beta and help make classic release the best it can possibly get. There is going to be lots of bugs to find, and I would like to dedicate some game time into finding and writing them down. Also I've played on pservers for so long I couldn't give a fuck about "waiting for the real thing", I just wanna play wow lol
---
AV in its 1.12 state can still last hours.
---
The average player can‚Äôt play for 12-48 hours in a weekend hoping to actually finish an AV.
---
Having games run so long that it feels like you make absolutely no difference in the long run leads to people being disinterested in that battleground.
---
But you still haven‚Äôt explained why shorter AV matches are bad.
---
lol I love the [Stefan Raab Icon](https://i.imgur.com/EhA46cN.png), haven't seen that in a very long time, pure nostalgia! 
---
Holy paladin - Never run out of mana, most mana efficient healer in the game, best buffs in the game, plate, best healer cooldowns in the game, slow leveling, many healer specs viable (only need 21 pts into holy really) Extremely desired in every raid, dungeon,pvp everything, 1.5 sec flash of light spam is ideal, blessings are insane in pvp.
---
Resto druid - Slowest heals in the game (3.0 talented vs 2.5 for everyone else, means people constantly snipe your heals, hots are good but also very mana hungry, lots of time precasting then canceling, don't need many for raids (however since nobody likes playing them you can usually find a spot), PvP your claim to fame is flag carrying, for actual healing every other healer is preferred, no regular res spell for 5 mans
---
Rotations suck for both, paladin you spam flash of light, druid you start casting HT then cancel it if the tank is at full health let it fly if they are hurt, other than that you throw some hots around on the raid
---
Spriest - is a heavily coveted spot in a raid group, you generally only have 1 or one hybrid spec to apply shadowweaving, because of debuff slots you mostly just end up spamming mind flay with MB occasionally, Good in Pug PVP, but extremely mana hungry, you will drink alot.
---
Hunter - Dps falls off late game, (although still higher than hybrids for the most part), one of the more complex vanilla rotations, you need to avoid clipping autoshots with your aimed shot/instant shots, strong inclusion in pvp but not a 1v1 god or anything. 
---
This is my take. I'm gonna go for RP PvE. I played RP PvP for a long time, but the numbers of times some ?? level opponent unmounted, killed me in 1 or 2 shots and mounted up again so I have to do a several minute long corpserun \*vastly\* exceeded the number of times I had an exciting cat &amp; mouse or 'fair' PvP experience.
---
TL;DR I made a post of the forums and I wasn't allowed to dictate the design of the game therefore I cannot ever trust Blizzard.
---
Ok.
---
That isn‚Äôt justification for that variant being the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù one though.
---
Holy Pala Vs resto druid is better.
---
The items actually made a lot more sense than you realize you'd know this if you actually played on a vanilla server with modern class knowledge.
---
The dungeons and raid in Netherstorm required flying and a few other areas but the leveling was on foot. Bladesedge Mountains was just such a horribly planned zone that it became almost a requirement to have flying in there.
---
It's a good 90% of the reason to support Classic now, so they would be encouraged to continue on. There was almost nothing that was worse in TBC.
---
* Higher skill PvP that wasn't about grinding or ganking. 
---
* More varied ways to make gold besides exploiting Dire Maul. 
---
* Professions were finally useful in longer term. 
---
* Quests were a lot more expansive and better tied to the story. 
---
* Much less grinding required for doing content. 
---
* More 5-man progression with heroics, and smaller raids were delightful to organise in comparison to 40 man raids.
---
No, I‚Äôd like more 40man content.
---
Possibly. 
---
I foresee myself starting to lose interest in Classic PvP once AQ/Naxx gear becomes common, so that'll free up some time I might use to visit retail. 
---
Until then, I'd rather spend my time in Classic. 
---
I would play it if we get one, just to try a few class/race combos before I make my final decision.
---
lul, arguing with 1.10 catch up gear... yikes
---
There is a lot of people that dont believe in blizzards capability to deliver a good and unchanged experience. The people new to WoW or uninformed of its timeline and changes might be wondering why is there so much distrust in the community. This post aims to adress those people.
---
It's 1.12 so irrelevant reply
---
Go engineer, use macro's, viper sting the cloths but don't kill em when out of mana. Rest cc and damage. There is more to it obviously. I use to watch triple D (3D daniak) but that was TBC and WoTLK
---
&gt; There's no way to do TBC without pissing people off
---
Agree.
---
&gt; But there's also no way the bulk of Classic players will play forever without new content 
---
&gt; and no way Blizzard can extend Classic without all sorts of massive problems 
---
I disagree, simply because you don't know the future.
---
&gt; and no way they could produce an xpac's worth of quality content as cheaply as they could update BC 
---
&gt; So eventually they're probably going to release Classic TBC and just live with the crying about "splitting the community" 
---
I don't know if you realize it, but what you are saying is incomplete, even if is right. Yes, the community will split and will "cry" about it.
---
HOWEVER, you also said that there is no way that the bulk of Classic players will play forever without new content. Well, that bulk is also the bulk that is going to be pissed off if TBC comes after Classic. Those players (and are A LOT of them) will NOT going to play TBC (this is the split in the community), and will also QUIT Classic soon after TBC is released, simply because without new content, they will not keep playing. Yes, maybe 10-20k of them will reroll, like they do on private servers, but the vast majority of them won't, and will stop playing.
---
ActiBlizz doesn't have many options with Classic. They either release TBC and risk losing over 50% of the Classic player base, or they release brand new Classic-like content, and risk the same loss OR gain even more subscribers, if they do it the OSRS way.
---
If you assume that Classic is this passion project, museum-like WoW, we will NEVER SEE TBC. EVER. But if Classic is a business, money-making project (which IT IS), the chances that we will see TBC entirely depends on how successful Classic is.
---
Unlike most people on this sub, I believe that the more successful Classic is, the LOWER the chances for TBC. And the reasoning behind this is simple : one one side, more than half of the Classic players reject TBC because of various reasons (smaller raids, flying mounts, resilience, daily quests, etc.), and on the other side, it will be crystal clear that Classic caters to a player base that likes a very SPECIFIC game philosophy, a game philosophy that is NOT present in TBC.
---
The only way for TBC is if Classic fails to deliver (financially), because it is the only reason for ActiBlizz to release new content that is BOTH cheap to release and good enough to keep the very small Classic player base (if Classic, as I said, fails) keep playing and PLAYING.
---
In other words, the financial loss, if Classic fails, will be minimal if TBC is released.
---
But if Classic is successful, the chances for new content are huge. Why? Because NEW content always, ALWAYS, bring more players and keep the old players playing and PAYING. 
---
Now, if that new content is going to be accepted by the community (using an OSRS-like voting system ; different than OSRS , but still relevant for WoW) , it is a win-win for both ActiBlizz AND players.
---
I think that the number of players who have a *main* as hunter will be significantly lower than the total number of hunters. Many classes will have a hunter for farming. Or mage perhaps.
---
Thank you!
---
Play vanilla for nostalgia and world pvp. Play any other expansions for better balance and pvp fights on equal terms. World pvp died cus its way shittier than arenas and bgs, i know you hate to hear it but its true, you actually think people wouldnt love arena if it was in vanilla?. Few people actively world pvpd in vanilla, But even casuals do arena and bgs tbc and onward.
---
most world pvp was in shared zones, stv etc. And that world pvp never went away
---
The hybrids got their specs fixed so instead of having one good spec and the others being PvP specs, all their specs could be used in raids. Especially shadowpriests were buffed through the roof. Personally I like when hybrids were hybrids. Yeah you might not do so well on the meters, but you can do many things that my warlock/mage/priest definitely can't. Remember pulling all of SM as a paladin? Ninjacapping towers as a druid? Just having the flexibility of popping bear form and taunt the boss if the tank died. You'll survive for long enough that someone can battle ress the tank and buff him up. 
---
They can say that retail was all just a dream and make Classic the real timeline.
---
Raptor is nauseating.
---
No ill burn myself out and not want to level again 
---
Hunter will probably be 4 or 5 because of the extra number of 'farm hunters'. 
---
No, plus to be effective Retail would require the latest expansion as well while for Classic you just need to be subbed. Not wasting time and money on that...
---
I think they should wait 5 years to release tbc classic but have it on a seperate server and duplicate your characters onto it. 
---
though I'd say that there should be only one opportunity to transfer to the TBC servers - after you transfer from one Classic realm, you cannot transfer anything from it again. Whether you transferred only one character, or all. Because people would abuse and send all gold and mats to the one character they're transferring.
---
You can take the time until classic comes out to amass enough of a fortune to pay for years of your future sub if you really want to lol
---
My goal is to have enough gold to pay for 2 years of sub for 40 accounts for multiboxing but I have no life
---
That t1 chest piece in the updated buffed version gives 20 spell damage and 1% crit. 1% crit is worth anywhere from 8-15 SP depending on how much crit is on your gear, putting the damage budget of the chest piece at ~28-35 damage. Your best in slot chest piece pre-raid for a caster pre-ZG is robe of winter night.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=14136
---
This item gives flat 40 damage and doesn't change at all throughout vanilla. There are a few other Alternatives that are slightly better but it's not uncommon to see literally every mage and warlock you'll meet wearing these robes in MC.
---
I've never played BC, not even on a private server so I would like to try it out. 
---
Yes, I agree that the r14 grind is not better than the gladiator grind, but honestly I‚Äôm not a huge fan of either system. However I don‚Äôt think most people ever go for rank 14, nor should they. Going for rank 10 though? Grinding that is a lot more laid back than needing to tryhard and cheese every arena fight with the FOTM team composition.
---
My main overarching goal and dream with classic is to be able to just 1 or 2 shot people as a warrior. Resilience is no fun because you can no longer crit anyone or do big damage. My feeling is that being able to do that should be the reward for spending months gearing up. I don‚Äôt want to fight a geared paladin for 15 minutes like I had happen in TBC or Wrath. I want high damage and high consequences; it‚Äôs actually better for balance if everything is a bit OP compared to player HP pools - see Dora 2 (where everything is basically OP) to LoL (where everything eventually gets neutered). It doesn‚Äôt simplify things, it just changes the strategy. 
---
I don‚Äôt think WoW is a good ‚Äúfighting game‚Äù. The PvP doesn‚Äôt stand on its own. If I want real skill based, person-on-person combat, I‚Äôll go play DBFZ or street fighter, you get me? WoW should leverage its unique selling points for its PvP. It needs the context of gearing up and putting work in to become powerful for it to maximise fun. Not to mention large scale engagements and class variety. WoW can‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt compete with fighting games, but it can compete with ‚Äúwar‚Äù games in which you are a smaller cog in a larger battle. I don‚Äôt think arena should have ever tried to be an ‚Äúesport‚Äù, it demonstrates a clear flaw in blizzard‚Äôs approach imo.
---
Definately and absolutely will not. Why would I play a game I dont want to play, in order to play the game I indeed do want to play, for free? The reason I'm looking for ward to vanilla is because I dont like retail WoW. There is no way I'm gonna force myself into playing it. 
---
i would if i could export my character but retain it on classic
---
These days WoW is runnable on pretty much anything, especially the older expansions. Also keep in mind that the free trial is for the current, latest expansion. It is vastly different game to what it used to be in its beginnings, which this sub is aimed at. If you want to experience the classic wow, you will have to play on private server as the current WoW offers a very different experience. Classic used to be more grindy, long, unforgiving and more immersive. The current WoW is aimed more at the casual player and quick rewards.
---
Get a better mic or no one will ever watch your videos.
---
Wrong. Less than 15% of the Vanilal realms were PvE in 2005-2006. Get your facts straight.
---
Flying in TBC was at lvl 68.
---
Well... then unaltered (pun intended) version :)
---
female troll is basically male night elf with tits and horns
---
Same. Really liked the idea of flying mounts, until I no longer had as much immersion with the world and it no longer seemed as dangerous.
---
The difficulty is not the issue. We are wow fans. We want to play this game for the next ten years and enjoy it. We don't want to farm 1.12 items and sit on them for the whole expansion. We wanna farm out the shitty items, then when thy add newer better items we wanna go farm those too. It's about adding content to the game that will give players things to do. We don't want to rush in get our bis and raidlog. By launching with only 1.12 items you're effectively telling the playerbase that this is a distraction. A side project meant to keep people quiet between retail patches. This is not what we want. We want a fully fledged game that can stand on its own and keep us occupied indefinitely. And that's why it needs progressive itemization and simulated "updates"
---
Nice 
---
Farm gold in retail to play classic, and no problem with money on top of that?
---
What is going on here?
---
I'd rather farm gold in a game I enjoy to help gear myself up in that game. I won't raid so there are a few boe epics I'll need to save up for.
---
Yup, some of the best. Towards the end when everyone had flying mounts it was some of the worst :( 
---
No such thing as getting camped when you can just rez behind a tree and fly away :(
---
Short answer : creates a multitude of small cliques within guilds, cliques that don't even talk with other guild mates, living in their own bubble.
---
TBC was a the expansion that killed most part of the MASSIVE, from MMORPG. 25 men raids vs 40 (smaller guilds), easy daily quests (that didn't required grouping), flying mounts (again, more reasons not to group up to be safer in the open world), resilience (no reason whatsoever for a PvPer to raid to gear up for PvP).
---
I am sorry, but there is no way in hell I would ever replay TBC or any other expansion.
---
literally all healer gear.
---
And at the top of the gear prio list.
---
Background: 
---
* Vanilla: Rogue (HC Raiding up to Naxx); Druid only alt I could get into the 50's. PvE focused, some PvP for fun.
---
Current:
---
Messing around on some current alternative WoW experiences. Leveled a warlock to 40. Realised I'm truly a melee guy but liked the utility of the warlock. I like a class with some mobility abilities. Wouldn't mind being a healer at 60 but would like the class to have some fun in PvP/farming potential as well.
---
Once Classic hits I know I will spend too much time on the game but I will be in no way able to commit myself to multiple raiding nights per week. So the main adventure will be the leveling again, dungeons and perhaps a casual raiding guild. Will level with some friends but probably a lot of solo play as well.
---
So currently on the shortlist there is:
---
* Warrior: Leveling one now to fact check the 'omg such a b\*tch to level class'. Planning to try it to ¬±30 to try out tanking as well. High utility class, high tankyness but truly low mobility abilities. Will easily find groups while leveling. Afraid the class will be super stacked. Also not the ideal class for solo leveling. (Not rolling one to be spamming 'dps warrior lfg'.)
---
* Paladin: No experience. Everyone states they are super boring to level and are only viable as healers lategame. Super high utility class. Will easily find groups while leveling. Pretty sure this class will not be in the higher tiers in terms of population. Good solo levelers it seems.
---
On the fence:
---
* Shaman: Everything seems sweet except for the totems, RNG &amp; massive amount of keybinds. + not an option if my mates push through for alliance.
---
* Hunter: Not a melee class but also not a caster class. Seems fun to play but I hate to invite them into my dungeon group playing as another class. The best solo class.
---
* Priest: If I were to play a caster it'll probably be a priest. Dull to level (wand masters) I think.
---
Out of the question:
---
* Warlock: Fun to level but not my cup of tea to main.
---
* Mage: Seems like a blast (pun intended) but just a pure caster class. Finding groups will be fine but there will be a lot of mages I think.
---
* Rogue: Enjoyed the ride. Probably still my #1 fantasy class but besides DPS'ing they have 0 utility. And I am no longer 16.
---
* Druid: Was fun to level but hated the fact that they didn't have an OOC rez. Least fun healer to play I think.
---
How do you play the more classic WOW? I want the immersion and am happy to grind at it for the experience! 
---
sure, of course, I agree there is a need and want for the server to continue functioning as it was, vanilla... but what i'm saying is some people would also like "progression".
---
So in the case we're discussing it removes that option without offering a solution to it.
---
wait... blood elfs in Alliance?
---
Sure. I want to figure out my keybinds and settings, and see how terribly inaccurate Classic is to Vanilla and judge if it's worth playing over the already available 1.12 client servers.
---
‚Äúrealise you read all the posts 3 times already, and most of those are the same ‚ÄòWHAT HAPPEN AFTER‚Äô or ‚ÄòCHANGES PLS‚Äô you‚Äôve been reading for months‚Äù
---
&gt;WTB lvl 55 mage food
---
6 stacks easy, and a good mage will be content with ~50s. An extremely easy way to make gold as a mage and if you know you're going to play a lot in a single session, it's well worth buying the conjured food.
---
Or better yet, have a friend make it for you for free.
---
Welp, I've been playing AV nearly every day for the past few weeks and I can tell you with certainty that everyone rushes to the boss and ends as quickly as possible.  No one fights each other, no one defends (if they're not stupid), and the games last about 15 minutes and I assure you that if you AFK in the cave or chose to try helping, it doesn't make a difference.
---
It's fairly normal to see less than 5 HKs for an entire AV match.  But, if you'd rather use AV as a free tool to get reputation gear like everyelse else, I guess we should just leave it this way.
---
If AV is to last longer than 15 minutes then Blizzard has to force it against the will of the players.  If it's possible to rush and end immediately avoiding any conflict, then everyone will.  Blizzard removed or crippled all of the obstacles.
---
You have a very romantic view of AV, thinking it can last longer because players just want to have fun and PvP hehe.  It's factually a race to the finish to make the next queue pop as quickly as possible and always will be.
---
Add no lvl cap, remove LFD, LFR, remove daily quests, remove resilience, remove arena, redesign the gear so the power creep will be minimal, redesign the raids for 40 men...and I might play that version of TBC.
---
Or better, have ActiBlizz ask (vote) the Classic player base, 2 years after release, what do they want : TBC or no-cap, new Classic-like content.
---
You would be stunned at the results.
---
Agreed, on the debuffs and secondly on the methods. I love the format of the video but the content seems off.
---
Earning like 20 a month or whatever it is is a terrible deal for any job, so fucking no.
---
I would pay to not have to play retail.
---
It takes less than an hour of work to make $15, and that's enough for a month of play.
---
Why go through the drudgery of playing retail for however long just to get $15 worth of sub time?
---
It peaked at 12k, never had 16k. 
---
If that's the "real" version of then why dont they allow transfers from pve to pvp, but do from pvp to pve? Food for thought :)
---
I agree about the 2nd point but that was my point as well haha. Of course half the population plays on normal servers, not arguing that at all. But that doesn't mean that's what world of WARcraft is about. Half the population of overwatch or league or any other popular game only plays quick play or ARAMs and not ranked matches but that doesn't mean the spirit of the game and game balance and everything else isnt designed around the more engaging more competitive more exciting version that's the spirit of the title. It would be a very short lived game if you could only ever play half of the game without the full experience. That letter John describes on the podcast explains this a lot better than I can. I'll try to find a timestamp sometime later if I remember this thread when I'm at a pc tomorrow 
---
Stop saying dumb things.
---
Less than 15% played on PvP servers in Vanilla.
---
Cool vid but I'm not going to PvP üòÄ tbh PvP is way to fast action for me. I'm always dead before I can do anything üòÇ
---
to me it reminds me of the Lineage 2 character selection a bit
---
Upvoted for SSD drive, they're the shit and well worth having on any gaming pc period.
---
What are you gonna do with spell damage gear? You‚Äôre just decursing anyway. 
---
If you literally don't do any action at all against targets, you will not receive credit for killing them.  This goes for letting only reactive damage like Thorns or only pet damage kill things.
---
Yes yes and yes. 
---
I will play till TLK with the hope they don‚Äôt implement dungeon finder. 
---
Basically no.
---
You are missing the point which was to show how different MC items will be from what people expect. This particular item happened to be the first google result when searching for items in 1.2 state. 
---
Even still http://classicdb.ch/?item=19145 is better than robe of winter night, so it wasn't even an exception of "dm loot being better than mc" :((
---
So the point is to release the entire game again, expansion after expansion?
---
People are already foaming at the mouth to have flying mount TBC and LFG WotLK and kill Vanilla a second time.
---
The community has killed WoW once already. Neither the "community" nor Activision Blizzard can be trusted.
---
We just have to hope that the Classic dev team are genuine fans of **Vanilla WoW** and that they do their best to recreate and maintain it.
---
idk, the "picture of screen" looks much more... Classic.

Oh I think I understand what you're saying. What incentive is there to roll vanilla when the majority of population is already on tbc? Well technically the onetime transfer from 60-70 doesn't need a time limit. The transfer would most likely be an automated process anyway so I could see them leaving it active. So say you roll vanilla two years late to the party you level through pre-tbc Azeroth do your raids at 60 whatever you can manage and then you join back with everyone on the newer expansion. Could you choose to skip vanilla and just level 1-60 on a newer expansion? Certainly but I think keeping the option available is important. Maybe 5-10 years after all this dies down it'd be fun to do another marathon through expansions. Atleast that's what I'd like.
---
Robe of volatile power got added in patch 1.5 right before BWL :)
---
Obviously people have different incomes in different parts of the world but I think it's safe to assume that for most players it's a negative outcome. I can't see  farming subscription + expansion cost be ever worth the time I could spend on something I would enjoy or simply work for the money irl.
---
To people like you every patch in vanilla would have been "beginning of the end". Conveniently not knowing that the game was changing a whole lot before your precious 1.12.
---
Battlegrounds and sheer boredom of the Hillsbrad zerg killed World PvP ages ago in vanilla already. TBC didn't have any automated dungeon finder. Most of Kalimdor / Eastern Kingdoms content is irrelevant in vanilla as well for level 60s, at least Heroics ensure that you have a reason to revisit content.
---
I think those that played the entirety of vanilla are not that attached to 1.12 situation specifically. It was different before, and could have been better after. Especially if all the circumstances didn't lead them into postponing many good changes into TBC.
---
I wanna play a paladin. But meh no speed boosts, no utility to catch those runnesr, no... but the role, the class fantasy, the sets... but no, srsly, no... but
---
Go listen to the podcast and the reading of the letter. It details why it was important to add, that's the whole point lol
---
Was Malfurion Stormrage a part of the Alliance? Wasn't he more like neutral?
---
Background:  Played original at launch (Druid up to lvl 26, Rogue to mid thirties), found out I was going to be a father and had to get life moving and quit the game.  Fast forward, my son is 13 and we will be playing WoW classic together.  We will be co-leveling together through the content, taking our time, enjoying dungeon runs and pvp at the top end of level ranges.  Do not see us having massive amounts of time to commit and no plans to be involved in any end game content.  We are trying to decide what faction to choose, does either one lend itself towards a more fleshed out leveling experience?
---
We are also trying to decide on our duo, we are debating between Warrior/Priest, Warlock/Druid, Warlock/Priest.
---
Warrior/Priest - The idea of being the foundation of any dungeon group is the main appeal here, less downtime and less reliance on others for our success in dungeon content. 
---
Warlock/Druid - I feel this could be a very potent duo for world content and could be a force in casual PVP, BG's and leveling PvP.  I worry about finding dungeon groups as easily, I remember being dropped for priests constantly in dungeons while leveling as a feral druid (think with warlock I might level as balance/resto) 
---
Warlock/Priest - Similar to above but with easier to find dungeon groups with the priest.  However sharing gear would be anti-fun.
---
Open to other potent combo's as well.  No hunter, no rogue.  No interest in Paladin or Mage from either of us.  
---
Any suggestions on crafting?  Which crafting is most useful during the leveling process with little though of end game?
---
When talking t1 pieces, yea, well kinda-sorta. When talking non-set pieces not really. There are healing pieces in MC that will last you to naxx.
---
Black DS set is mostly a good filler for either hunters or warriors (fury, ofc) but the actual BiS focuses on hit which this sets lacks aside the 2-set bonus. Just compare it with the devilsaur set: 2%crit 2%hit (as set bonus as well...) and the pants piece is actually ahead aside the FR dragonscale brings. This goes on with windreavers (scholo boot drop, 1%hit, 20 agi), the infamous truestrike shoulders (2% more along some attack power)... They're just good until you get something better.
---
On the other side, yes, tribal is basically both these items and depending on server (accessibility to the mobs, being or not a mafia like some pservers) devilsaur. Early on even warbear might see something for some wannabe bears, a similar thing for the corehound boots for their FR if they get to raid. 
---
Elemental also gets a nice pre-raid on living shoulders (leather +heal piece) and living leggings make a decent starter depending on how items are managed (ghoul skin and padre's are better yet the first is quite a rare piece)
---
We don't even Know if there'll be a beta
---
&gt;Vanilla designers famously overtuned their raids, apparently Cthun was technically impossible to kill without the nerf
---
I'm 99% positive Cthun was bugged. I'm not sure on the details but I believe it was a problem to do with adds spawning incorrectly that were untargetable and freely killing the raid 
---
Rank will be out with phase 2 so u probably won't be 25
---
Yup. That's part of what they talk about on the podcast. This is why even "normal" pve servers still have a ton of pve. They are just a care bear option for softer folk who dont want the danger so they can corner that market too. That's part of why it was so successful, having the appeal to both.
---
Another fun thing to think about is how you are allowed to server transfer from pvp to pve, but NOT the other way around lol
---
Largest pserv right now hovers around 6k concurrent. The next 2 largest I‚Äôm aware of bring that number up to about 9-10k on a good day. Let‚Äôs imagine there‚Äôs twice that many concurrent players on other servers I‚Äôm not aware of (I don‚Äôt think there are but whatever)
---
So 20k
---
10th most played game on steam at time I write this comment, ‚ÄúThe Invisible Guardian‚Äù has 29k players, off-peak hours (82k peak today)
---
I went for rank 10 on Nost and almost made it. I'd do that again for sure. 
---
My point isn't that you shouldn't be able to one-shot weaker players, it's that you shouldn't be able to one-shot equally geared players. If a warrior meets a warlock and both are Naxx geared then it's just a race for whoever gets the opener. Oh you charge me and mortal strike me? Guess I'm dead before I get a single spell off. Oh I got a fear/seduce off on you? Guess you'll eat my 6k soulfire and die without even hitting me. That's my problem with the gearing in Vanilla. 
---
But as I said in my previous post, I don't even know if resilience fixes it hehe.
---
I mean I would save some bucks if it was easy/fun to get that gold in retail. But it probably won't be so I think I am paying.
---
How can you even think that 
---
What's your point? The game will be in 1.12 state. Did the item drop with the game in its 1.12 state? Then it will drop in classic wow.
---
If you disagree that the game will be in 1.12 state then that's entirely different argument which I am not interested in since the devs already said the game will be in 1.12 state so I'm not sure how that can be fruitful.
---
YouTube did recommend me this video üòÇ 
---
https://youtu.be/VIuDz3ElSx8
---
In a heart beat probably my favourite version of wow
---
fortunately they only use saps on me
---
No. There is an entire list of reasons why I would never replay TBC.
---
And all those reasons were given in the comments.
---
As a Druid, I kind miss having to drink like 6 times, just to get entire raid buffed
---
Just add all the BC Content to Classic, like it was supposed to be.
---
haha and fapping during manabreaks? If so, I think I've played with you.
---
C'mon guys, this be classic. It can only be Rexxar!
---
If it really isn't a big deal I'd go with EU. If you have friends to play with go NA, or if you prefer to be with your own kind (North Americans) since Europeans speak a shit ton of languages and rarely it can get confusing if your group has someone who doesn't speak English.
---
&gt;Its because for some of us, its all about the end game. 
---
You have to consider that the inaccessibility of the end game is a big part of why it's so intriguing to many players. I've dabbled with some instant 60 servers, and raiding isn't nearly as fun when when there's no character investment. "The grind" is an essential part of the whole classic experience, including the end game. 
---
RPPVP. The ganking won‚Äôt be so bad and you won‚Äôt be left in a situation where you regret your decisions after cap because you can‚Äôt engage in wpvp etc.
---
Not bying this. Sure let the servers sit there for months and years, but who is goikg to play it? Only a very few special snowflakes. 
---
Vanilla has a life cycle of ~2 years, after which time people start over on a fresh. 
---
They can easily do both IMO. Once they have a stable patch 1.12 after the first time around they can merge all servers into a single realm and take a hands off approach where their only cost is bandwidth. This is assuming the community is listened to and there is no loot trading causing a need for GMs to have to intervene with loot. They need a strict no moderation policy to cut costs and aggressively merge all the realms into a single one if they drop too low in pop like you describe. Even the shittiest of private servers always have a few hundred pop on them, I suspect blizzard official realms would have a ton more. Especially if they can latch onto the  LA fitness business model lol where they have people who are subbed to keep access to their character without actually playing and taking up bandwidth and dynamic server resources. That's actually the sweet spot money wise for hosting when you have dynamically expanding VHDs and ram on virtual servers which they do now
---
1.12 balance but not progression... the honour system and BGs will not launch with classic
---
What‚Äôs your point?
---
You seem to overestimate the competency of players. About half the AVs I‚Äôve played this week have been over an hour long, and a handful of games have been over 3 hours because 75% of the team refuses to push. Or just want to farm hks instead of completing objectives.
---
I even had one game where both teams stopped pushing and just defended, so almost no pvp was happening in the entire battleground because neither side was willing to leave their base with meaningful numbers.
---
i meant the healer gear in dm wont be replaced by mc stuff. (besides cauterizing)
---
I would, but I'd rather play it when Classic is out for a several years. Like atleast 3.
---
But I hope Blizzard is not going to be lazy and just goes the other way and instead of releasing all the old expansions, just release updates for Classic.
---
No because it's probably the most ineffective spent time ever. I can work in my Job for 30 min and have more than the monthly cost.
---
I think we need a beta not to test if thinks works but to see if they implemented the right data. Item stats, movementspeed of mobs, summoning a new demon instandly removes the old one at the start of your cast, hit dodge and parry chances.
---
I heared you do fine as healer (5mans and raids) as 20-0-31. You need 2 sets of gear. 
---
Can someone confirm?
---
Druids are freaking monsters from like 20-40.
---
I would quit if I was forced into bc
---
Nope.  New server has the same issue of not having new players on the bottom, still fractures player base.  
---
Classic will exist.  Unless it's massively popular, there won't be a TBC Classic / Classic-like new content. It doesn't make sense.
---
I think character copying would hurt the progression/leveling experience on launch. Maybe time gate that for a few months on launch would be best
---
I think I have narrowed my ideas down to priest, paladin or rogue.
---
Priest and paladin seem like in-demand classes because they are healers. Can anyone tell me how competetive rogues are in PvE? Can I get a spot? 
---
I guess they are pretty fun for PvP and WPvP.
---
Ok so let's just launch with naxx out at launch and all the items then because that was the 1.12 state right?
---
The game will be in 1.12 state, meaning bosses drop items that they dropped in 1.12 and the items will have stats they had in 1.12. If you disagree with that, then that's your imagination (because the devs said it will be 1.12) and I don't argue with that. 
---
Just looking at first 3 slots and you are wrong even for prebis let alone molten core:
---
- Chest - tailoring/strat ud
---
- Back - leatherworking/strat live
---
- Feet - UBRS
---
I'm going to register Anime Club on day 1
---
Needs to be two separate clients. It's important that these games are preserved as they were at this point.
---
I'd play if the servers were naturally migrating there, but I'd rather not/much rather classic went forward with an OSRS philosophy/'classic' manifesto.   
---
To me, TBC was the start of the chain of events that led to the current state of the game (for better or worse). Arena was sick though.
---
Warlocks and Priests kinda suffer the same way.  At least if your net backfires you've got freedom.  Lol
---
As others say, 3k is pretty ideal. You can get what you need done once you have over about 1500 online. I‚Äôm ok with 4k too but once you get to 6k or over the world gets impractically crowded. WPVP and mats/rates being camped in particular are a huge issue at that population.
---
They're dismissed just like I would dismiss someone asking for a square circle, what they're asking for isn't only unreasonable, it's impossible.
---
I forgot I even pre-ordered that. Any word on a release date?
---
Dire maul release isnt really an issue. 
---
Having ZG release at the same time as BWL is a big issue though.
---
TBC was the best expansion ever. I remember the release night of the dark portal how millions of people waited in front it, how we rush the other side. The red orcs who hit like a dungeon mob, freakin huge fel reaver, hard dungeon bosses and of course the best part of all TBC Karazhan. I think Karazhan was the most well-thought raid ever, I cannot compare it with any other including Blackwing or Naxx.
---
When they announced TBC, I was hopeful for a Vanilla-like expansion. How delusional I was.
---
My biggest shock was my FIRST 5 men dungeon I did in TBC. I expected a Vanilla-like experience, lots of wipes, trying to figure out what bosses do, how trash react, etc. etc.
---
It was a totally random group.
---
What happened was abysmal. We wiped 2 times only. Didn't give a fuck about how to pull trash, or being careful not to pull 2 groups. Outside minimal CC, everything was AoE.
---
We finished the run in less than 30 minutes.
---
I was like " what the FUCK is this shit?". I came prepared with lots of consumables, and with the mindset that it will take 1 hour, at least, before finishing. And expected lots and lots of wipes, especially because it was a random group.
---
People that never experienced Vanilla (or did it in a very limited way) and started in TBC clearly have NO IDEA why TBC wasn't even half as good as Vanilla was.
---
Antarctica, so hopefully lawsuits from Nostalrius won't arrive.
---
Add Northrend and Outland, but with the levels of their zones spread out so it can be visited throughout leveling (and capped at 60).
---
Dude that's great to hear. I think you've built an amazing tool to be honest - it's so minimal and simple to use! Good to hear you're still working on it.
---
As for what quests will be 'in' at launch, have you been on a private server or made your own repacked server? That way you can see what quests were in the 1.12 client surely?
---
Probably closer to 99.99% tbh. 24 days (in real life time) to 60 would have been VERY fast back then. I mean, assuming a reasonable 8 days /played that means 8 hours/day every day.
---
Wouldn't "forcing to play TBC" after one or two years mean that the cycle starts just all over again?
---
I thought the plan was to release Classic again. And only Classic.
---
Perhaps they will release in one or two years after classic-re-release new servers with TBC, still having the classic-only servers. 
---
I played from MC through MOP. 40 man just sucks! 20/25 man was perfect. 
---
Half the people are just afk/watching youtube, and you dont get as close a connection to people. 
---
TBC was literally an entire new world, aviation mechanics and overhauls on various systems. In no way was it the same as Vanilla.
---
Many things in tbc were great! I agree, ssc was beautiful. Can't wait to smash wow classic and tbc when they release that after :D
---
so tru
---
i'm sorry, but i cant understand you, or what you're trying to say :D
---
You're ignoring the fact that they weren't using patch 1.12 itemization and talents lol
---
You forgot to mention sharding.
---
We will have to see what price tokens will be classic. Will it be worth to spend time farming gold for subscription and then matts for raids / dungeons. Im sure classic will have its audience and the fact the the content will be released in parts will keep us busy for a few years. In a few years they will see if its still worth it. Most of us will eather stay in bfa or go classic only. 
---
Soon‚Ñ¢ 
---
No because they essentially said "It will be 1.12 but with these exceptions" and those exceptions included naxx not being open until later. 
---
Note that I'm not arguing about what is right or wrong, but it is what it is.
---
A place people go to do mental gymnastics.
---
Chicago would actually be quite decent, assuming that you live in the US but not Alaska. I'm saying that after years of connecting to Sweden from Iceland.
---
I wish they made a server in Iceland, though. Icelanders are generally always more into "classic" things. I'd say that Icelanders alone are capable of filling up entire realm - if the server cap was 10k, about 3% of entire nation would need to play at the same time, to create a queue. I'm almost sure that queues would appear on day one.
---
And, if that location served Ireland, Faroe Islands and Greenland too...
---
Man, this hits too close to home.
---
I would bet they will force you to buy every expansion to play classic. 
---
Actually releasing the game with 1.12 itemization, 1.12 talents and Dire Maul will bring it pretty damn close to private servers.
---
Always go ret
---
Warlock you can pvp on any spec but SL for PvE is really bad, your dps gets so low is bad
---
Why 'race'?
---
You made my morning.  Lol
---
But, you're not wrong.  There's already a list of things that are changes, and still growing, from wall jumping to the mail system to sharding.  People need to curb expectations.
---
So you think we shouldn't see any of MCs mechanics, and everything should just be blitz'd in a tank and spank from the first raid? Never seeing a Son of Flame on Rag? Sounds like authentic vanilla if I've ever heard it.
---
I sent you a personal message :)
---
dunno, just wanted to highlight that they are not playable, sadly  
---
and i think they should get way more spotlight as a race
---
&gt; I'm wasting my time that could be useful spend on wow tokens to get game time
---
Or you could just find a better way of making 50 cents a day in real life. 
---
Hide and seek is one of the ideas (but not using stealth). You have to turn off all names etc. So you cant cheat. You can change how you look so if you wanted you could dress more like an NPC and stand somewhere I'm hopes you won't be recognised. It can be very fun when you're hiding and the seeker runs right past you!
---
Absolutely. BC was the pinnacle for me. I am hoping if classic is a success they do release some BC servers.
---
Problem is you don't get to pick the state your toon is in when they get copied. But nevertheless it is a good solution to waylay potential abuse because it essentially parallels what happened when TBC dropped in the first place.
---
TBC and WOTLK are actually the things i am excited about with the rerelease of Vanilla. Vanilla itself was ok but not that good. The good stuff happened in those 2 xpacs. So all my hope goes towards progressive servers. Bascially vanilla will be ok, tbc and wotlk will be amazing!
---
play ret, min-max like a motherfucker and put the dps'ers who are slacking to shame, help guildies, bring extra consmuables, don't take "no" for an answer. Same with enhancement shammy.
---
but srsly if people wanna be all hardcore and shit they would only bring warlocks and mages for dps, + some hunters for tranq shot, warrior tanks and priest+pally/shammy healers. Everyone else basically "underperforms" on most content compared to these classes.
---
There won't be tokens on classic as far as I know so this won't be possible. I am not in work right now for health reasons so I am not able to spend RL money on codes etc. to give out. Also from the sounds of it many people in the guild are buying a butt load of tokens on retail to get a load of sub time for classic already.
---
&gt;They won‚Äôt do it because if Vanilla is a hit, odds are that TBC will be too.
---
This assumption is DEAD wrong. It is actually the OPPOSITE.
---
If Classic is a hit, it will be ONLY because ActiBlizz delivers a product that is as close to #nochanges as possible. Which means that the people who will play Classic are AGAINST features that were NOT in Vanilla, and a good part of them are in TBC: flying mounts, mix of races and classes, lack of WPvP, smaller raid size, linear dungeons, resilience gear, neutral city, daily quests, old zones are dead, gear power creep, community split (smaller guilds, arena and PvP junkies), etc.
---
If Classic will be a hit, expect NEW, Vanilla-like content.
---
Not TBC.
---
I though this post was about that idiot tips out and im TrIgGeReD!
---
&gt;warlocks may have threat issues with Ruin crits 
---
Probably if your tank plays by 2005 meta and you only score crits in a row then yes.
---
&gt;If warlocks' dps suck in lower raid tiers
---
&gt;I imagine it's more likely in lower tiers that SL would be accepted
---
What kind of logic is this even, "If I suck then instead of trying to improve I will suck more and it will be okay".
---
Not at all. I'd say that the 1.12 is the biggest culprit in making MC trivial, not the items. We had to hold back our damage A LOT back then because of how threat worked in the earlier patches.
---
In 1.12 the entire raid does a lot more damage baseline which in turn leads to mana not being much of an issue for the healers.
---
Since authentic patch progression isn't on the table I actually think they should adjust the earlier raids a bit to account for the nerf that comes from talents and to a lesser extent items.
---
Add a certain percent of health to the bosses until it gets to the point where healer mana is more of an issue, you don't need to do more than that. It's technically a change but it's a change to fix a problem caused by another change so I think it's not as bad as changing the realm caps for example which serves no purpose at all.
---
So, you like to tank, as long as it EASIER for you.
---
Because that was Paladin and Bear tanking in TBC. EASY. Required far less skill than tanking as a Prot Warrior.
---
Ok pls link to the chest from DM that is better than the chest from strat/tailoring/mc assuming priest?
---
What can I do if 2 of my Servers are missing? EU-Zirkel des Cenarius (GER) and EU-Die Nachtwache (GER)?
---
Changes made in TBC started the downhill of WoW.
---
Not disturbed "some" people.
---
it solves your problem. make it some kind of quest.
---
"Mage, we are leaving home to go on this new adventure. we must leave at once. there is no time to get your belongings!"
---
to address your point about gear. Maybe leave gear alone. We have like 3 years to think about how this would work though
---
And worst in more than it was better.
---
Do you have a preferred farming method?
---
It's fine, I mean you can hold your own  against most classes, especially early on when dps classes don't do much damage. But priests always specialize in group PvP. For example, in 1v1 a geared rogue with all his cooldowns will most likely kill you, but in a 10vs10 setting (wsg) a rogue is very weak but you are very strong. 
---
You seem to complain more about the appearance of things that the actual things. Transmogs and even having "epics" in LFR. Epics were never a status symbol. Maybe in 2004 when we were clueless. Who cares about purple vs blue pixels? Some blues are better than some epics anyway. 
---
Has anyone ever really used their appearance and their full purple gear as a status symbol? Because I always thought my raid performance was the status symbol. 
---
Why are people even wasting time on this topic? Obviously the answer is yes, but first of all Classic has to come out and make us all happy. And it needs a solid playerbase or Blizzard won't even think about putting resources into TBC.
---
As a Warrior that really sucks because if you level fast (like I always do) you never have Mages that are high enough to make food that you actually need. To make the level35 food the Mage needs to be 40+ etc so you always have to fucking pay a shit ton of money to vendors.
---
ye, also, cant inspect talents in classic
---
Yes and no.
---
Yes, because I would want to point out everything that might be wrong, and no, because it would be just to fresh of a memory before live release of Classic.
---
Main reason I stopped playing private servers last month.
---
Don't want to be burned out.
---
Well that's the lucky thing about the truth, it doesn't require us to believe it for it to still be true haha. I suppose all we can do is wait and see!
---
These are the smallest problems I would worry about. How they timegate the content will be decided in the Beta with community feedback. Its really not much effort to move a Dungeon back a stage.
---
I'm playing WoW classic for the 40 man raids only
---
The thing that sucks about it is that it disappears when you log off.
---
It will be killed at patch 1
---
If this does indeed become a thing, I'm staying far away from that server. The amount of elitism here is unbearable
---
Can't say I'd agree with removing arenas, I didn't find them that fun but I would absolutely not ever make them the be all end all of PVP rewards and balance, that was just stupid and unfun.
---
P.S they aren't

lvl 30 warrior Tier S with WW axe
---
This nailed it. Wow in space was awful.
---
Here is the [first season of Totalbiscuit's Blue Plz](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BzN90CC_xhvDUlZTdnlGcjBiV0k) on WoW Radio. It's interesting to hear thoughts and opinions on vanilla-era content as it happened. Season 1 started during patch 1.4 and finished right around the release of Burning Crusade.
---
6 stacks of food is a couple of gold, and that's only 45 food/water.
---
If you know you'll use it all in a single session it's well worth ~50s. Some nice mages will accept 10s.
---
It's a huge downside but still worth it in many cases.
---
Because races are social constructs?
---
Dueling was great, it was my favourite part of pvp in vanilla. Mainly because I dueled against people I either knew, or knew something about. Sure, Horde had a few players who were well known on the Alliance side (I specifically remember a rank 14 tauren warrior). But with dueling I could challenge my friends. I was still in school those days, so a duel between me and a classmate who I'd see all week meant a lot. Winning that gave you the bragging rights for a long time. Or dueling players from a "rival guild". We were the second best guild on the server, so beating players from the number 1 guild was always satisfying.
---
We have 100 threads about adding additional content to classic.
---
And they are the people we should trust to do that. 
---
I love the 40 man feel. 39 other derps running around trying to kill shit. I am just happy my ps guild is going to classic so I'll for sure have a good guild.
---
lets say so :D :D
---
Yes. BC was actually my favorite period of WoW. 
---
it depends on your group if you can make them trust you will do good as a ret and if they will take the drama on themselves if ret gets some warrior/hunt/rogue stuff and people will get mad about it. You can do well as a ret with good gear and consumes but there always going to be some1 saying that he'll leave the guild if ret get's [x] item. 
---
You can tell Kara was originally designed for Vanilla. 
---
Nope. I only knew them in wow. WoW was my first real mmo. 
---
TBC &gt; Vanilla &gt; WOTLK &gt; Trash
---
TBC was very much still an MMO. I have to completely disagree with this take. Wrath is when they really started watering it down but even Wrath was fun. 
---
is*
---
No. I don't remember too much, i wouldn't be helpful to check for mistakes.
---
I trust the community to test it and give Activision useful feedback. 
---
Demo already showed I'm not needed. I don't remember any of that shit people complaint about. 
---
In my opinion World of Warcraft should have always been trilogy expansions. Vanilla &gt; TBC &gt; WOTLK then done with story line. Between each trilogy there should have been an expansion like Legion that showcased the lore behind each of the classes. 
---
I would definitely play Classic through WOTLK. 
---
BC wins over Vanilla for me only very slightly. BC had better balancing, arena, and was generally just more polished. In hindsight it started the slippery slope, although quite gradual. 
---
I liked TBC, Outland and all that, cool new races. How about they make new content in vanilla and/or tbc? New dungeons, raids, events etc? A new and more Hardcore experience than retail?
---
I have a job I'm fucking 30
---
In a heartbeat. Burning Crusade was my favourite expansion. It did everything right. 
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Absolutely not. 
---
Source? When I tried to track down numbers myself a while ago I couldn't find any, but there were about the same number of PvP servers and PvE servers. Genuinely interested.
---
Other than level scaling Outland remains how it was when it was released pretty much.   I think classic is appealing to people because Kalimdor and the eastern kingdoms got completely overhauled when cataclysm dropped.   
---
Ok but this is classic sub?
---
Ok, well I base my statement on empirical evidence from how people behave on private servers. One gets shut down and everybody lose every progress made, what happens? New characters on the next server, everyone is up in arms. Two years later, that server is completely dead, the majority players are on fresh. Yeah, except for a few hundred snowflakes.
---
Not to mention all the dungeons were redone as well. 
---
Ali Baba for sure
---
If they do that I simply won't play Classic. We already have the sub fee, I don't need them to milk me 60$ on top of that every year for an almost 15 year old game..
---
That isn't homogenisation. Prot paladins kept their ability to pull all of SM, druids could still ninja cap towers etc. They kept their unique stuff while being given the ability to raid as something other than a healer, that was a massive improvement.
---
I think I‚Äôll still be leveling to 60...so no.
---
I agree, BC was the best expansion. Vanilla has a lot of problems in itemization and balance that BC fixed, BC had better raids, more fun dungeons with challenging heroic modes, better farming (arcane tomes were faster then dailies,  dalies did not exsist untill very late and were not efficient until blood elf island) cool looking zones, and flying took so long to get that by the time you got it it felt earned, and flying unlocked new areas to farm and explore. I loved everything about bc except arena but not that big of deal in BC itself. 
---
4k. Lower and you won't find rank or healers and you waste an evening lfg in trade.
---
Ofc I'd play it because people wil play there. Do I prefer it, no.
---
Too much changed to the worse with flying, shared city, shit questing 25 man raids, etc etc. Good stuuf came along like arena and hybridclasses got way better. I want classic then revamped tBC or OSRS route.
---
New timeline would be cool. I see a lot of people talking about BC as the next logical step. 
---
Just scrap it all and start over. 
---
&gt; If that's the "real" version of WoW, then why dont they allow transfers from pve to pvp, but do allow them from pvp to pve? Food for thought haha :)
---
Because normal mode is not hard mode? As food for thought goes that's not really even a crumb.
---
&gt; Half the population of overwatch or league or any other popular game only plays quick play or ARAMs and not ranked matches but that doesn't mean the spirit of the game and game balance and everything else isnt designed around the more engaging more competitive more exciting version that's the spirit of the title. 
---
Ha ha ha. Hee hee. Oh dear. You just said WoW was balanced around world PvP. Oh man.
---
&gt; That letter John describes on the podcast explains this a lot better than I can. 
---
Read the interviews, backed the kickstarter, have the book. PvP was never a core part of the vanilla WoW plan, it was fought for and tacked on and balanced on the fly without great success. Not that it really matters - lots of things the designers intended never happened, and lots of things they never intended happened. What they tried to do is really neither here nor there.
---
By comparison to previous games like Everquest and Ultima Online WoW was the carebear MMORPG that you could play without getting ganked. That was the innovation that made it different, if anything was. There were plenty of MMORPGs where you could get ganked, WoW separated itself by making it optional.
---
Nah you wont be doing Any DMG at all
---
Even without the hidden passive, being able to hold your rage out of combat is more useful than +3 rage on Charge

I've never argued against that, that will definitely happen. 100%. I've offered technical solutions to a known problem that would solve the issues for the part of the playerbase that does care about those things. There is a very different and very diverse demographic that will play classic than what we see on pservers due to the illegality and barriers to entry. All we can do now is wait and see. They discuss this same thing a lot on classiccast if you're interested, cool discussions for sure 
---
And "urmagurd phasing and lootshare" ad infinitum, ad nauseam.
---
Not if it were made by blizzard. 
---
I'd be more interested in them expanding the classic world and staying in Azeroth. There's so much they could do still instead of being weak and abandoning Azeroth like they did in the past. 
---
Whaaat I thought cooking was a no brainer for Warriors.. I always farmed a bit for meat or whatever in the zone I was and made my own food lol. Fishing also helps a lot as there are many fish related recipes and there is literally no competition when it comes to fishing (except the STV event).
---
Not that soon, that‚Äôs way too fast. Maybe in like 5+ years.
---
Good luck leveling that up and getting the recipies while leveling...
---
If you can tank and keep a guild / raid together -- you can easily survive marriage.  :)  
---
Congratz on the little dudu.  :)
---
All of those combos are tier one duel leveling combos. 
---
Warrior/priest you don't share gear, you both have to farm mounts so you won't be waiting for each other, you will dominate pvp. You also are the Lee components to a group. 
---
Warlock/druid you can play a more moonkin style and double dot, keep the warlock always going, you get travel form early but the warlock gets a free mount.
---
Warlock/priest synergies super well especially later. You will never need to rest because you can go on forever. Double dots and a lot of heals. Only downside is you share gear types and the warlock gets a free mount but you can probably just pool or buy the priests outright at 40. 
---
There is a lot more too it but all those combos will be easy. 
---
&gt; I disagree, simply because you don't know the future.
---
Well, "no way" is pretty strong. But consensus is that the game mechanics start to break down pretty badly in Naxx gear, PvP becomes wildly unbalanced rocket tag and lots of people quit playing it, and so few people are in Naxx gear that post-Naxx content would only be accessible to a tiny minority of players. WoW 1.0 just wasn't designed to cope with Tier 3, let alone anything beyond it.
---
&gt; HOWEVER, you also said that there is no way that the bulk of Classic players will play forever without new content. Well, that bulk is also the bulk that is going to be pissed off if TBC comes after Classic. Those players (and are A LOT of them) will NOT going to play TBC (this is the split in the community), and will also QUIT Classic soon after TBC is released, simply because without new content, they will not keep playing. Yes, maybe 10-20k of them will reroll, like they do on private servers, but the vast majority of them won't, and will stop playing.
---
I don't see it. If they really like Classic Vanilla they just keep playing Classic Vanilla. Why do they quit just because some people who aren't them are playing Classic TBC now? Pirate vanilla servers haven't vanished in a puff of smoke because pirate TBC servers exist.
---
&gt; Unlike most people on this sub, I believe that the more successful Classic is, the LOWER the chances for TBC. And the reasoning behind this is simple : one one side, more than half of the Classic players reject TBC because of various reasons (smaller raids, flying mounts, resilience, daily quests, etc.)
---
I think you're assuming that the Classic player base will be exactly like the pirate vanilla player base. I think that's a wildly unsafe assumption.
---
I think the pirate crowd will be greatly outnumbered by past and present retail players, including lots of people who enjoyed vanilla/TBC/WotLK and aren't militant reactionaries when it comes to TBC.
---
I think I‚Äôm gearing towards paladin since I‚Äôd be able to do a little bit of everything, but I definitely enjoy being a Mage more than anything. 
---
 ‚Ä¢I think one of the more under appreciated moments of playing Vanilla(Classic) is/Will be helping the community around you grow. I am very excited to take hours out of my leveling grind or whatever may be to help some fellow adventurers do a dungeon because they need a tank or just simply can‚Äôt find a healer. Thus, the Paladin definitely seems to be the most time-efficient class excluding multiple trips to the bank for gear swaps &amp; talent spec. 
---
 ‚Ä¢I‚Äôm definitely planning on playing Classic a lot different this time around. I don‚Äôt like the sound of an RP Server, but I do intent to take my sweet ole time going through all quests and areas and just soaking it all up as I progress. Instead of my previous play-through(s), I would instantly try to become max level as quickly as possible so I could spend countless more hours trying to gear for raids and work on professions. 
---
I think a more relaxed, non-forced, play-through will be the way to go this time around. 
---
I truly can‚Äôt wait for this game to launch, I‚Äôve never been this excited to game in years.. I‚Äôll probably avoid this subreddit and drama regarding Classic at all costs on release, god knows there will be lots of ‚ÄúInput‚Äù!

I would purchase a TBC Classic in a heartbeat. Would love if they could have rereleased collectors editions. I didn't actually get into the game until TBC, remembering the oh shit moments when I would hear the fel reaver made HFP memorable, something that Howling Fjord just couldn't recapture with the Giants roaming around.

I will play any beta I can get my hands on,  it's not like I'll spoil any major story by playing it.

Hurr Durr this is classic sub how dare you mention TBC
---
Guys, does anyone have any experience or maybe some guide for multiboxing with only two characters, but different classes?
---
I would
---
??? Fishing alone can push cooking pretty high and there are many recipe rewards from quests. Especially on the Alliance side.
---
If you really got bored, you could farm gold/play the AH on retail to pay for tokens and fund your classic sub. 
---
I never got to do a 40 man raid. I am so stoked man.
---
Same thing with westfall and loch
---
If you stick to one race‚Äôs zone and don‚Äôt travel between the two there are points where you need to grind almost a full level it‚Äôs pretty brutal. Travelling means never have to worry about that
---
Definitely agree. And the lack of exp lost on death making it way less punishing overall was a huge factor on top of that.  I feel like they struck a perfect medium and that's why we are all here talking about this nearly 2 decades later haha
---
You missed my point when you laughed about balance though, I never claimed wow was balanced at all much less around world pvp haha. That's part of the charm is how it's a real rpg game that isnt balanced at all. I was talking about overwatch and league to make a comparison to counter your point about 50% of the population not wanting pvp and using a moba and an fps as examples of community buy-in versus design philiosphy.
---
That's another thing that John and mark talk about on the podcast as well, drawing on his fps experience and other devs former pvp experience from other games, even how they would make naysayers play some other mmo and pvp games to see what it was about.
---
If you fish, you can give up with leveling fast straight up lol! 
---
I still have 50k or so on my retail account I stopped using 5 years ago, I'll probably use that until it's gone. But $15/month is not a lot compared to the time I would spend on a game I'm not interested in playing.
---
But the 68-70 content was built with flying in mind, so it worked fine.
---
Mortal Kombat!!
---
I want the OSRS approach where they just add new content 
---
Haven't played since Argus release, so no, I won't. Having all the relevant content locked behind expansion purchase surely doesn't help.
---
I won't be in a hurry lol.
---
Those would be people who have kept in contact with people from back then and probably plan on playing together again. My old guild has a Facebook page, there are def more than the 40 for raiding on it. 
---
The trick is now if we can get our gm to play again with a business and four kids. And do I have time to play again with a business and two kids? And has the tank who was an asshole at the time grown the fuck up LMFAO 
---
Rage dumping IRL.
---
Exactly.
---
Plus, every expo condenses the world into a small island and introduces flying which just ruins wpvp.
---
In my opinion, nothing matches straight vanilla, and they shouldn‚Äôt even bother with expos.
---
When I last played (early bfa) tokens were 200k+ iirc
---
And there are players who want to race through months of content to experience that one week of work faster. 
---
Hi I know this is old af
---
How is 24 27 in PvP without bash or FC or furor
---
Different situations, I think.
---
Pirate vanilla servers exist in a milieu where pirate TBC servers already exist. The people who want pirate vanilla are playing pirate vanilla, the people who want pirate TBC are playing pirate TBC, and if you try to make the people who want pirate vanilla play pirate TBC then of course they leave. They go to some other server that will give them pirate vanilla.
---
Classic vanilla will have those hardcore vanilla grognards who want nothing but vanilla, but it will also have hundreds of thousands of past and present retail players, including lots of people who want TBC eventually. I think Naxx raiding will probably ease off when TBC is announced, just as it did in retail, but just like in retail I think most people will be exited for the fun new thing.
---
Yes, this. I did this on my paladin throughout MC and ZG and AQ20 and my healing throughput was fine.  
---
However, I'd say 21-0-30 is better than 20-0-31 (though it won't be a \*huge\* difference) - and yeah you'll need two sets (some pieces will overlap). I was 21-0-30 pretty much all throughout vanilla and I loved it. I could smack faces but also go straight into a full healing role in PvP if I wanted. Really fit the class fantasy. 
---
You don't have a build problem, you have an attitude problem.
---
&gt; Min/maxer world first speedrun guilds will laugh at me applying as SL but I'd rather be part of a semi-hardcore/decent
---
So basically, you: 
---
&gt; want to ~~raid in~~ get carried in high end PvE guilds
---
&gt; want to ~~do~~ tryhard BGs and PvP competitively
---
&gt; don't want to respec 
---
&gt; don't want your DPS to suffer in raids
---
Yeah, those guilds aren't the only ones laughing, it's hilarious. Especially on the Alliance side where shit like BoK means you won't have to stop as often. 
---
&gt; I imagine I could spam shadowbolts without ever stopping (which could help the dps difference).
---
Yeah, except when they're done stopping they're bandaged and full mana and you're OOM spamming an extra 2-3 SBs to catchup with them. Then you still have to stop and now they're ages ahead of you. 
---
&gt; who cares about 5% dps difference on an already lowish dps char
---
Who cares about giving gear to the guy who's too cheap/lazy to respec and is never going to hit harder than a Hunter's pet? 
---
If you want to find a guild then Discord is very good:
---
Classic guilds - https://discord.gg/USXMQNT
---
r/classicwow - https://discord.gg/nVcCUD7
---
I've never had to grind in Elwynn though: o With all the eastern quests, the farm quests etc.  But Westfall is a grind if you don't go to another zone between lvl 13-16 ish
---
It could be like they do in retail. Technically a raid is tied to a specific patch, but it can take months to actually come out. On the top of my head I remember 7.2 being released sometime mid spring, but the raid opened mid summer-ish. 
---
While everyone is giving you the standard elemental over enhancement for PvP advice, this heavily depends on your level.  
---
If you're going to be in lower level BGs (anything below 40 or so) enhancement is the way to go. 
---
Elemental isn't really that great lower levels, and if you're going to have a shaman alt and mage main, you could really make a beast of an enhancement shaman with twink gear that would be a ton of fun in lower level BGs.  Just make sure you're high enough to get wind fury.  I believe level 39 would be ideal for this. 
---
Same that's pretty awesome. I don't think it's as fast as it used to be but I'm sure it's cost effective for them to run it that way. I really love infra as code and if my company can get a solid setup like that running it would be huge. 
---
Yes 
---
Two man dungeons. Lolwut?
---
When classic launches there will be guilds left right and center advertising fir people to join their guild.
---
I'll probably login and drain all my my retail gold immediately I think i have somewhere in million and a half mark on all my characters. 
---
But beyond that I won't be playing it.
---
Thanks! 
---
What woud be better if you want to heal (pvp and pve) and do good damage in pvp?
---
26-25-0 or 21-0-30 or sonething else? And I use 1h + shield or 2h?  
---
Can u link the build?
---
Unless you raid as a cat hahaha
---
&gt; I think most people will be exited for the fun new thing.
---
No doubt. The perpetual shiny new thing has been the slow death of WoW all the while still making profits for the shareholders.
---
There is no way the retail Classic playerbase will be more dedicated than the pserver playerbase. Pserver players are the ones who have gone out of their way and through many inconveniences to play Vanilla WoW.
---
Classic WoW will be populated in a vast vast majority by retail players, then a smaller majority BC and Wrath babies, and a small minority of actual Vanilla players and fans.
---
Your link opens the episode 93 :)
---
In 2.0 Blizzard made a lot of changes to the underlying functions that add-on's call on to interact with the game itself. So many of the pserver add-on's the community is accustomed to will need to be re-written, or modern add-on's will be needed to work with Classic, if possible.
---
This might be a concern when Classic is released, especially if there is little or no Beta period, as has been speculated.
---
Thanks for the heads up, I'll check them out
---
Assuming a fairly competitive guild, competition for melee dps is some of the toughest, if you aren't willing to put in effort guilds will find somebody who will, and there won't be any shortage of them to pick from. If you do preform well you are a top tier dps throughout the games life.
---
Getting pre bis is very tough as a rogue because you have competition from warriors who will often just not invite rogues to reduce loot competition. Your cc is also much less reliable than other primo dps 5 man dps classes. Once you manage to get a steady raid slot its much less of an issue.
---
Pug and world pvp rogues are fantastic, but they aren't very popular in premades, with most groups only running 1
---
Nope.
---
Horizontal progression. That's the only way I'm fine with it. No level increase keep it at 60. Keeps all content viable. 
---
there is no such piece, what are you talking about?
---
If they have one I‚Äôd like to test it yes. That is the point of a beta after all.
---
Looking forward to listening to this on the way to work today. The Sunken Temple lore should be really interesting too! Thanks Josh!
---
&gt; This is not a business-oriented project though
---
Lol, you have no idea how a publicly traded company works. 
---
Spec SM / Ruin. 
---
I would absolutely be open to the re-introduction of expansions! At least, up to WoTLK. Honestly, I feel as if the "classic" feeling of WoW lasted up until that expansion. It was Cataclysm that completely changed so much about it.
---
That being said, I believe it should be handled by opening realms for specific expansions. For example, one for vanilla, one for BC, and one for WoTLK. Adding to this, you should be able to freely move forward in expansions with your character, essentially switching between the expansion-realms. For instance, say you cap at 60 on the vanilla realm, and you've completed all of the raid content and are satisfied with your experience. You can then transfer to the BC realm, and progress through that expansion content. However, you may also simply start at lvl 1 on WoTLK, if that is what you prefer.
---
As far as fragmenting the community is concerned, While I'm sure the former two realms would contain decent numbers, I personally believe the highest player count would naturally flow towards WoTLK due to the stream of expansion related content. This would give the opportunity to not only experience the legacy content again up until the game was transformed, but it will give new players who never experienced the early game the opportunity to play through the world events real time. From pre-launch events to those that took place during expansions, it would be a great way for new and old players to relive the original content and feeling of WoW.
---
I'd love to hear some thoughts on this! Me and my S.O talk about this often, and I'd love to hear what others think.
---
Filthy hardcores. At that time I will be reaching 60.
---
We are way past the "changes pls" posts. Now we got "Okay, so I love vanilla and I'm a #nochanger, but... \*insert change\*"
---
Not sure I get the distrust. Pretty much everything they do is telegraphed through beta/ptr/patch notes. Despite some bumps in the road the game continues to be successful/enjoyable.
---
It's typically a vocal minority that has an issue with any major changes to the game. The analytics probably tell a different story.
---
I second this. I have farmed some serious gold by just picking herbs and making potions with them. Even buying herbs off the AH and crafting pots can earn you a lot of money. Choose a herb that sells well and isn't overly farmed by others. For me my best money making tactic was picking Fadeleaf and selling it to Rogues. Farming it was fast in Swamp of Sorrows, and they sold well (Not for as much as the likes of Dreamfoil etc., but still well and reliably), and also crafting Greather Fire Protection Pots and selling them while guilds were running Onyxia and MC.
---
IMO leveling a whole new character just to farm gold quicker seems a bit stupid. You're going to have to farm for a long time to get back the extra time spent on leveling them.
---
Consumes
---
TBC was the golden age for me. My only complaint is the addition of resilience rating. It was the first time that excellent gear was achievable in 5/10 man's but it was rendered suboptimal in PvP.

Absolutely not. BC emptied out the population of Azeroth mainland and flying mounts killed world pvp. No thank you.

---
sl is real bad for pve, you could probably get away with it through mc maybe bwl, but by the time aq comes out you better bring your A game or get left behind
---
Fuck yeah please, as long as vanilla then moves to be a static server.
---
Every person I debate with eventually talks about retuning raids, which I have advocated for from the start. In the end its a single project that could solve many problems.  
---
My fear is Blizzards reluctance to mess with data
---
Yup, following those guys as well. Ok sure dude I personally have no problem with non-force TBC.
---
No, because retail is casual garbage.
---
You fucking liar. Raid leaders will have us spamming buffs, no healing allowed. Don't believe this man.

I listened to the music guy for super long until I realized the link was wrong lol.

Sure, I can't remember exactly, but I think it was something like:[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxxuoxoZZx0etbcq](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sxxuoxoZZx0etbcq) there are things you can play with, but the key talents are fairly obvious)  
---
I'd say 21-0-30 is the best hybrid build - you gain a \~2.5k heal for 0 mana every 2 minutes and only give up a CC (Repentance) so your damage is unaffected. At the end of my time on Vanilla I joined a PvP guild which had multiple GM's on my server (Skullcrusher-EU) called Syntax Terror. I remember often just purely healing in BGs in teamfights, then happily 1v1'ing in skirmishes.   
---
Aura's I'd switch mainly between devo/conc/sanctity depending on the situation (occasionally I'd use a specific resistance once - say shadow resist vs a warlock). Seals you pretty much use seal of command. Blessings basically wisdom or might. Judgements - the one that makes them take more damage or the one that returns mana on hit usually.  
---
Gear - My gear was a mix, and we're going back as far as 2005/6 here so my memory is hazy, but I remember having a few pieces of Lawbringer (Tier 1) (Shoulders and boots?), a few ZG set pieces (chest and neck I know for sure - I think also the belt) and a few bits of the blue PvP set, all of which were really well itemised for ret. I had 4.4k hp and 4k mana unbuffed and around 22% crit or something.  I also had the unstoppable force and don julio's hand from AV. I'll try find the screenshot but I remember 1v1'ing a warrior with asscandy/AQ40 gear in WSG once without having to heal because I got a series of lucky crits and SoC procs. Ret damage was \*not\* bad in a PvP situation (it's only 'bad' in sustained PvE fights).
---
REEEEEEE NO CHANGES
---
It's pretty easy to level up cooking while leveling. There is plenty of recipes along way to get to 300 easy
---
Blizzard forum posts are so ridiculously bad that I don't know how anyone could think Blizzard should listen to them MORE. 
---
I feel like I‚Äôd enjoy Paladin the most, as it has everything I look for; but better.
---
Priest - great heals, but mana hungry. 
---
Warlock - great lore, difficult to play.
---
Shaman - like Priests, but many keybinds.
---
Druid - class fantasy favourite, but mana hungry.
---
Hunter - favourite class, resonate the most with, but difficult.
---
Mage - would love to play, but no heals.
---
Paladin - everything except for the fact I prefer the Horde... 
---
Please, help :(.
---
That‚Äôs still a long time with just wpvp. Lets imagine July 16th launch.
---
Look at the slide from blizzcon that lays out the ‚Äúcurrent thinking‚Äù on stage progression. 
---
Stage 1: MC, Ony, DM, Kazzak, Azuregos (March 2005)
---
Stage 2: BWL, BG and Honour rewards, ZG (July 2005) 
---
Stage: 3, AQ, Silithus, Green Dragons etc (Jan 2006)
---
4 months from March-July
---
6 months July-Jan!
---
If that‚Äôs any indication of the kind of timespans they plan to spread out releases of major content around, then we won‚Äôt see the inside of a BG until November.
---
Even being generous and saying they‚Äôll release it after 90 day leaves it til October. There will be some people with several level 60s by that point. Levelling and early 60 on your first toon on a server tends to the most memorable time on a character imo. 
---
People will PvP 
---
and they will do tarren mill v south shore 
---
For *at least* the whole of summer 2019
---
I understand it. However, holy with reckoning also seems good, like 26-25-0. 
---
What do you think of that?
---
I had forgotten about wow classic until youtube started autoplaying wow vanilla videos and now i hunger again...sigh.
---
Zero interest in tbc
---
encourage the other plebs to decurse so they can get loot too

Not at all. I will actually pay my entire groups subscription so nobody will feel the need to farm gold on retail to pay for classic
---
That would be good too, and reckoning is super fun - but it's a bit gimmicky. It's great when you're defending a point in AB or something and a rogue jumps you and you stun and one shot him (stun always first so they can't dodge/parry your reckbomb), but otherwise I'd say overall it's not as good as the build I linked. 
---
And I used a 2hander most of the time. I'd occasionally swap to a 1hand/shield in PvP, and I'd swap a fair few pieces out in PvE (and use a 1hand/shield).
---
Horde side is even pretty good now. Some patch mid-vanilla they added a bunch of recipes onto various &lt;Trade Goods&gt; type vendors. Most every zone hub has a recipe for items dropped by the local mobs.
---
so you sit and farm because you are afraid to waste your time to buy tokens to waste more time? nothings wrong here. pls keep on walking
---
Would kill more sub's than it would create
---
I would prefer if they went back and evaluated areas they meant to open but never did.  Maybe expand on Azeroth rather than creating a portal to somewhere else.
---
Ok that fight probably takes 1 minute in 1.12. In that time it gets you 120 mana. So you could say it's same as 9 int (135 mana). Therefore you would take a robe that is essentially +22 int +12 sta over:
---
- [+11 spi, +5 int, +68 healing](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13346)
---
- [+14 sta, +4.8 int, +73 healing](https://classicdb.ch/?item=14154)
---
- [+20 sta, +17 spi, +27 int, +22 healing](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16815)
---
okay..
---
Yeah exactly. See how it got deleted?
---
Tanking dungeons are easy.  The issue is PVP isn‚Äôt as fun and tanking in raids take a lot more skill.
---
BC's main selling point is tough dungeons and raids.  You can get that currently on retail.  I would prefer they keep the 'Classic WoW' brand focused on design values that were lost since Vanilla like server community and open world adventure.
---
Ok thanks! Will go 21-030 then. 
---
One more question, is the lack of the 10% int talent and the lack of benediction going to hurt in pvp/pve?
---
Since you don't mention the actual DPS classes you'd bring to a proper min max raid DPSwise (read: Warriors and Rogues) i'm going to go ahead and dismiss the rest of the post as well as uninformed.
---
Any game is time consuming. But i dont think you understand my point. You cant possibly say that what i suggested for the mount casting time is the same as wanting mobs with less hp. I dont mind wasting time in the game as long as its some type of progression, that being said waiting for the mount to cast up is not a progression. In fact for short distances its better to run than to mount. 
---
As others have said, level as prot/holy. Start off by going into holy until you get consecration (divine int., imp SoR, cons), then go full prot. Level up with a one-hand + shield, and AoE farm. It's so much more fun than Ret (which I *hate* leveling as), and you can be an amazing 5-man tank. PLaying computer games is about having fun, so why not level as something that is more fun although slightly slower?
---
People have different tastes.  If you only read this sub youd think retail has no subscribers and hasnt existed for 10 years.  If you read only /r/wow youd think classic supporters are fringe loonies and the project is a waste of time.  People let their emotions cloud their judgement on these things.
---
Sounds like alliance for you bud
---
It's a problem with no perfect solution. Authentic patch progression is out of the question for a number of reasons, them not having backups prior to 1.8 for example.
---
1.12 talents and class balance is a big nerf to the earlier encounters but at the same time those encounters existed in that state during 1.12 so it's an authentic snapshot of that period of time.
---
Altering the encounters will make them feel more like they did when they were current content but it means changing the 1.12 patch which will cause a massive "REEEE" primarily from the private server community.
---
So the question is, do they want to replicate the experience or do they want to replicate the patch? It doesn't matter which they choose, people will be upset either way.
---
Sure you don't need spell damage for decursing, but I'm giving more loot to someone who will work towards the success of the raid over padding meters. 
---
I‚Äôve only ever been Horde, so we‚Äôll see. 
---
amazin
---
50k gold back then is like having 5million gold now
---
I will play it to help out honestly, I don't like playing beta versions that will reset after the beta duration. But if they need as many as possible to stresstest and bug test then of course.
---
hmm, sounds like \[insert a set of random Russian curses\]
---
Depends what happens with lupos, before BWL he did shadow damage, then got patched out.
---
Otherwise cat or wolf like others said.
---
I always level my my shaman as resto, makes it so you really never die in 1v1 even level ganks to be honest. Just flameshock use a fast dagger drop searing totem and use flametongue. 
---
Hi, /u/Koog330
---
Most likely you will need an active wow sub for beta. I refuse to pay to do other peoples work.
---
Elwynn is much better than Dun Morough if you follow a guide and make sure you get every quest in the zone including the farm ones
---
However dun Morough players will almost certainly need to hit elwynn or resort to grind troggs for 3/4 of a level 
---
Hitting both and using hearth to return home I‚Äôve found was the most optimal solution
---
Actually, since Legion they have actually made changes that arent even in the patch notes and are only brought up after people make alot of noise about it being changed.
---
If it's prenerf lupos he will be camped alot. Broken tooth will be camped regardless for a long time for PvP hunters. 
---
Get an owl for leveling, best by far, can keep aggro on multiple mobs, decent damage and survivability, good focus dumps, only bad thing is you only see owls in nelf starting zone, after that it's level 47 in felwood, so get one early and keep it. If I was rolling horde hunter I'd spent an hour or so going out of my way death running into telderassil just to get one at level 10.
---
why would you need a tie for WOW classic? Are you a streamer?
---
NOOOOOOOOO! Please!
---
Wrong dwarf, Goblin and mekkatorque pictures but still nice 
---
Deep disc builds are usually built around power infusion, which gives casters a huge dps increase. I'm not much of a pvper, but I would say if you're looking at disc/holy builds for pvp, it should be looked at through the lens of group pvp, where you will be healing, dispelling, providing support to your team in general.
---
If you truly want to melt faces in pvp, 1v1 or in a group - I would reiterate that shadow is the way to go. Few classes can stand toe to toe with a good shadow priest!
---
i dont want to sound like an ass or sth, but if you want WotLK cooldowns go play WotLK PS. Thats not Vanilla.
---
Adjusting Class cooldowns is too big of a change imo.
---
it's almost as if having to put in the extra effort makes it feel like you're contributing something to the group
---
By level 50 there is 0 excuse as a melle class not to have FREE food in hand all the time from cooking/fishing.
---
It isn't what I want but yes I would not turn down the option of playing TBC at some later point.
---
I love Vanilla, but I love TBC more.
---
It tightens up every class and spec, makes them all(?) at least viable, gets rid of some of the more janky itemization and the raid content is amazing.
---
It loses a little bit of that 'Vanilla Magic' but you get such a better mechanical game. 
---
Not really true, fishing isn't bad if it's done a little bit at a time during the leveling process.
---
Druid leveling: almost zero downtime as feral. Hot up then fight in cat/bear, by the time you need a heal your mana will have regenerated while morphed. 
---
I also remember being really disappointed with instances in TBC. In Vanilla they used to require tactics, time and planning. In TBC, you could run through an instance in no time at all, AoE'ing everything. The instances were dumbed down and felt like a platform game rather than MMO content.
---
No TBC... where does it stop?  You will have people wanting every expansion released again then.
---
What I personally would want (albeit it‚Äôs a pipe dream.... but hmmmm so was classic wow) is something passed KT that:
---
1. Is new to everyone
---
2. Does not increase level cap(I memember Classicast #22 talking about a pre-wow mmorpg that didn‚Äôt increase level cap for 10 years)
---
I could spend all day talking why increasing level cap every single expansion is a bad idea.  Who knows what is it at now 150? And everyone does 5 million damage? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
At the end of the day, Blizzard will do what makes the most sense business wise and if they can make a fan or two happy, great...but making people happy is not why they are in business (although making people happy gets them money... but that is for another post)
---
Yeah "I'm sorry youtube block me to upload a longer video, so I will upload two 10:01 video" &lt;-- real video..
---
I really prefer the non-video format for a lot of reason so I love that he stick to it.
---
Yes, fishing trainers also has a few usually.
---
Can you share some of these comments you are talking about?
---
Horde: Roasted Boar Meat till level 50 -&gt; Strider Stew to level 100 (sold in XR), Thunder Lizard Tails (also sold in XR) up to 140ish?
---
EZPZ.
---
S A C
---
Most DM stuff is better than the pre-raid stuff that was already better than MC gear
---
The music episode was really good!
---
I don‚Äôt think I would. I‚Äôd rather play retail than relive previous expansions. 
---
With Vanilla, it feels completely different. It was the original game. Leveling in expansions is s forced mechanic, but in Vanilla you were creating a character. Also, like most, I wasn‚Äôt able to complete the story during Vanilla, so I love the idea of going into Classic with the intention of killing KT.
---
Changes that weren't on ptr?
---
Bizarre thing to write, but it‚Äôs the internet.
---
Jebaited
---
Played Paladin in vanilla, this is quite accurate. Was able to do some Ret playing in PvP though, so that was nice.
---
Hi, /u/ithilras
---
Doesn¬¥t cleave replace your weaponswing? That is some huge opportunity cost there. 
---
Everyone should play as they want, if someone gets offended of how others are gonna play the game they are an r-tard.
---
And btw: Skills&gt;Speccs. Spread the word.
---
Stop telling me who I can and can't complain about 
---
/s
---
That's right. At the end of the day Blizzard have to make the changes that are best from their point of view. Whatever they're doing, whether we agree with it or not, is right enough that the game still exists and is having more content created for it.
---
Don't they own their own data centers? It wouldn't be as simple as opening one realm in a random country, since they don't rent their servers afaik.
---
Last I played that was less than half a token.
---
Same. I was disappointed with the expansion once already. I don't want it again.
---
Who exactly wants flying mounts and LFG? I have seen no one.
---
&gt;it's almost as if having to put in the extra effort makes it feel like you're contributing something to the group
---
it's not that feeling. It was the feeling of "oh Gods, it's going to be expensive". Because I used to drink once every few fights, and now I drank 6 times before even starting a single fight.
---
That was my first day on AV.
---
By community you mean your NA echochamber? Because the rest of the world is fine as is. 
---
Of course not, backing up claims is only for n00bs
---
And poll booths to vote on content
---
My first alt is going to be a ret pally. You bet your ass I'm never touching holy.
---
my friend just grind engineering very fast and once you have the bombs world pvp is awesome. Level 25ish-40 is so fun chucking bombs at people trying to run and then smashing their face in once you get close. then 40+ you have repentance 
---
I loved BC and Wrath. Catch-up mechanics and LFG in Wrath are two major strikes against it, but Naxx, ICC, Trial and Ulduar are possibly my four favorite raids of all time, and my favorite iterations of Druids, Frost Mages and Warriors were all during that time period. In theory, I fully support official servers for both expansions. However, in reality, I think it all boils down to the success of Classic and the available population. Dividing the the oldschool crowd into halves or thirds could end up spreading everyone around too much and hurting the experience of all iterations. I'm a greedy bastard, don't get me wrong, but playing it cautious and keeping everyone in the same spot is likely the best way to go.
---
there is nothing better they can do, than to open a datacenter in Iceland, and make it the main one.
---
They'll save so much on electricity and cooling...
---
I‚Äôm not saying they can‚Äôt do it I‚Äôm saying they most likely won‚Äôt because it‚Äôs a server with a guaranteed death. At the end of the day they are a business and they will decide longevity over the short term.
---
Probably not. IDK maybe. The best part about the was the arenas, karazhan, and gruuls lair. So at least for the first little bit.
---
I like Monstrous and regular Plaguebats in EPL. The greys and whites they drop sell for shitloads for some reason.
---
There will still be new bugs they will have to patch and have to pay developers to solve that. I know you want it but I‚Äôm just saying I wouldn‚Äôt get your hopes up. It would be great if they did but it probably won‚Äôt happen 
---
Really as long as you can get illumination you'll be good for pumping out flash of lights, and the holy / ret is also great for pvp as you are very versatile. I think most hardcore guilds expect their paladins to be deep holy and then have one paladin spec into blessing of sanc but the majority of guilds arent guna be nerds like that 
---
I feel like that flood of undead can be problematic however. I feel like while the intention would be to keep 15 players busy with the undead while the 10 left fight the boss, there would quickly be "slowing tactics" with hunters using frost traps, mages using frost nova, and in general 25 people just nuking down the boss quickly enough that the horde doesn't have to be attended to.
---
Introducing some mechanics similar to what Blizz has done recently (movement based, using items etc etc) would rather make for a much more interesting fight compared to an undead horde mechanic or just a stat increase.
---
Preacher just wanted to preach. Probably got set inspired by one person's comment. But we have heard the message! 
---
"Don't tell people how they are supposed to play."
---
Should be easy, since basically nobody does it. Lord's gonna love us. 
---
100000% yes. My favorite expansion by far.
---
Oh yes, didn't think of it the other way. I never play gnome or dwarf :D
---
Well, you're obviously not a "true" fan of the game unless you play that way.         
---
So, force yourself to do things you actually dislike, because that's what "true" fans would do, and you're not enjoying the game correctly if you don't.
---
Yes, but I would prefer post 60 classic content. Effectively, WoW2.
---
That being said, if tthey did BC, I think they should keep the level cap at 60 instead of raising it. That way, people could do Vanilla or BC content as they choose. If implemented well, this could solve the problem presented with each expansion of the game getting bigger and the world getting smaller. 
---
how do they play a game that hasn't come out yet?
---
If you ask around within your guild you might be able to trade someone classic gold for BFA gold to pay for your accounts, under the table ofc
---
if you want to minmax realy hardcore:
---
the best race for a melee shaman is orc, stunresist is best for every melee and bloodfury can be used after your oom and used up instaheal. it doesnt matter that bloodfury doesnt scale with your gear, because you wont have tons of ap anyway. any the axe skill isnt useless too. there is a nice 60dps 1h shaman axe in aq qestdrop and your pvp 2h bis is cthun axe. nax doenst have realy have a whole lot of interesting stuff for you
---
for ele shaman its tauren. the nova totem, stomp, chainlightning, shock combo is just too strong vs melee to be skipped. your bis is end of dreams. shouldnt be to hard to get. there is also a nice 3 pc ele set in nax too from trashdrops
---
and for healshaman its undefined, but healshaman is useless in pvp anyway. for pve its troll but doenst matter a whole lot
---
for that reason i will play 2 shamans from the get go this time around
---
Yeah delaying it a month or two will literally have no impact on me so honestly if people don't want it when they rush to 60 then so be it.  It will be that long before I hit DM running levels anyways
---
i hated tbc...
---
from a Medieval Age with dragons (fantasy),
---
to a scifi world with flying islands and strange creatures (Consortium etc).
---
And then the flying Mounts...no more real world pvp.
---
I really don't know what people like so much about tbc, i would prefer wotlk over it, even so it had some boring leveling areas.
---
I mean if you want DM release delayed by how long?  Do you honestly think it will have a significant impact on alts given it would only be delayed shortly?  
---
Suddenly it¬¥s not anymore about authentic but good or bad right? DM at launch is the authentic vanilla experience for the majority. 
---
Leveling with the first wave in tbc had some amazing wpvp that's for sure. Also the rep/farm spots were lit af for pvp like the elemental plateau or later at the isle. Fun times, not the best, but good none the less.
---
There's a very good ideology and even built-in system in wow to combat that. 
---
/ignore
---
There. You can enjoy the game however you want now. I recommend using it in irl or at least on reddit too.
---
The dream!
---
What? This is entirely a business-oriented project. Do you not remember "You think you do, but you don't"?
---
I'm not convinced that infra as code lowers cost. You've transferred that role to the Developers or Systems people who now have to code as well. Those kind of skills definitely increase salary cap. 
---
I think that the idea behind a lower cost is that you can cut out positions that are deemed "archaic" (think traditional systems) and bring in DevOps or train some Developers to perform the Ops role with code tools. Not many developers know how to tune a system like a systems guy, just like a systems guy often doesn't know how to rework code for efficiencies. But along this same thought, most developers now can not tune code for better efficiencies. The plus to this is that now you can balloon memory on a system and utilize SSDs to run code that would have cobbled mechanical drives. The downside, what happens when even SSDs and memory can't run poorly written code? Scaling up and out only helps so much.
---
Agreed with this. 
---
Make 60 permanent level cap, and adapt end game content from future expansions around 60.  Don't power creep items.  Lets be real, better gear just means end game stuff is easier.  Keep the challenge.  Make the rewards cosmetic gear and other shit. 
---
I'd be cool with BC and then maybe a few years after that WoTlk. But i would be against Cata due to the fact i hate how much the world changes.
---
Now if they wanted to say take classic wow expansions as an alt timeline and release new expansions( that doesn't fuck with the base world) i'd be for that.
---
There is nothing passion-oriented about Activision-Blizzard. At all.   
---
They passionately let go of a bunch of staff recently so their Executives could orient themselves bigger bonuses after the most tragic year Blizzard has had for a *long* time.  
---
Do not let the PR spin fool you. The only reason this project has seen a green-light is because a bunch of accountants did some speculative addition and came up with a large line of zeroes.   
---
If Classic somehow fails the person who is ultimately responsible for it will be fired. If it does well that person will probably get let go anyway in the next round of 'corporate restructuring'.  
---
Never forget that this is the Blizzard that announced Diablo Immortal, a fucking mobile game, to a crowd of PC-oriented fans at their own fucking convention.
---
"DoNt YoU gUyS hAvE pHoNeS?"
---
As others have pointed out elsewhere in this thread, people have been playing vanilla private servers for over a decade. There will be people playing classic, it isn't gonna just die in two years.
---
Doing a separate server for BC (if they do BC at all) makes infinitely more sense for everyone involved rather than forcing people to not longer have classic again.
---
Oh, so the TBC expansion which so many disingenuine "fans" of Vanilla are foaming at the mouth to have won't have flying mounts?
---
I'm just saying game forums are always top tier autistic, if it bothers you so badly, then just stay off em and play classic however you see fit when its out. In game is 100% different from forums because only a tiny fraction of the playerbase is involved outside of the game so you can kinda figure if those people are involved beyond just playing the game theyre probably gonna be the elitists...bored ones.
---
It sounds like I shouldn't even bother, then.
---
Blizzard is trying to create an authentic experience, so that would lead to no Dire Maul at Launch. That's how it was in Vanilla.
---
True, but at least they are ranged and have snare effects (well, Affliction locks and Shadow priests, at least).
---
Honestly, all I really want from TBC are the new talents and skills. No level cap increase, no Outland, no flying mounts. I want to play the TBC arcane mage, balance Druid, or elemental shaman as I level in Azeroth. I know you can do that with vanilla talents, but those specs aren‚Äôt great for levelling in Vanilla. Imagine deeper skill trees with only 51 talents. It would make for some interesting specs and some hard decisions. 
---
That being said, this will never happen. 
---
I'd probably play to see what it's like, level a bunch a classes to 10 or so. I wouldn't invest too much time though.
---
I think your basic premise is flawed. People have been playing vanilla private servers for over a decade, what makes you think that classic would die in two years?
---
If anything their best solution is to set up a diablo-esque "seasonal" system. Have permanent servers and then a few seasonal servers that reset every so often. Then have seasonal character transfer over to permanent realms when it resets.
---
Shame you aren't EU :'(
---
I get that makes sense from a player aspect but they won‚Äôt do something that the majority of players will stop playing. They are looking increase their player base not decrease it.
---
Decided on Rogue. Not yet sold on faction.
---
Dwarf or Orc. I like Dwarf for their treasure finding, stoneform, they look cool in stealth, they're awesome conceptually. Not the biggest fan of their finisher animations.
---
Orcs have cool racials for damage or stun resist. I prefer their finisher animations. Not as cool in stealth.
---
How is the Horde vs Alliance experience and how does it affect things in your eyes? 
---
Better version of the screenshots:
---
https://kotaku.com/very-early-screenshots-of-world-of-warcraft-1711350152
---
It's like the video game version of 'The Winds of Winter'.
---
It's going to get worse with many months of MC only. 
---
But you're talking about repeating their mistakes. They'll lose players by taking away classic arbitrarily again. There are a lot of people who explicitly just want the classic experience. They'll lose those people if they force it to BC.
---
I think you're just completely underestimating how many people enjoy doing classic over and over again. TBH a seasonal system is probably the best solution for keeping classic subs alive. Allow the min/max speed runners to compete for fastest clears and allow the rest to play on permanent servers.
---
Yes I would, one of my first characters was a belf paladin called Topaz, and I would love to recreate him.
---
Wasn't Legion the expansion when they delayed flying until halfway through the expansion? I wasn't even playing retail, and I noticed a lot of complaining/persistent whining from the entitled kids who suddenly had to run or use ground mounts in the game.
---
100% agree on the OSRS route, if people get TBC I want my favourite as well, Cataclysm. People may get but hurt but the OSRS route is the only way it will succeed in my opinion 
---
You didn‚Äôt do any quests at all to 60? What was your class/spec? I guess it‚Äôs possible but highly improbable someone makes it that far without realizing it or asking questions. I‚Äôm gonna need a lot more info to believe this happened.
---
do all of them! you have time :D
---
The damage difference is massive due to how you gear, and here's why. Ruin itself isn't an unsurmountable dps loss. Crit and damage are somewhat interchangeable, so if you went SL you could just prioritize damage higher than critical, sac succu for the same 15% and come out ok. 
---
HOWEVER, Imp Shadow Bolt is a massive component of warlock dps. It's also a debuff that is shared among the warlocks. That means you really want to stack crit as much as possible for Imp Shadow Bolt uptime. Otherwise you're just leaching procs off the other warlocks, which is a dick move. 
---
The good news is that SM/Ruin is still a great spec in both pvp and pvp. Most guilds will want at least one such lock for the Imp buff on the tanks, and the perk of SM is you get both your +10% shadow damage and your pet.
---
Oh how i dont miss those
---
Like he said, engineering is a game changer for pallies. I'm not a huge fan of the "go engineering or go home" mentality that seems to pervade this forum, but in the case of paladins, the class just has so many holes in it that engineering fixes that you'd need a really good reason to not go engineering.
---
What about Prot though? 
---
Hit me up on discord and we can chat to see if we match up well.  Check us out in this thread:  Epoch of Thought.    [https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT](https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT)  
---
That is called CYA so they can get off the stage without being harassed. I don't doubt Blizzard will completely obsolete MC (as it was in some countries other than the US) by putting DM in the first batch of content. 
---
Blizzard has been making features of WoW obsolete since the beginning.
---
Once again, I feel thankful &amp; lucky that I was able to experience the early stages of vanilla on pserver (you know which one)  in 2015. This is one of the reasons they were as popular as they were &amp; developed a large following in the pserver community.
---
Hey there, we are specifically looking for shamans.  Check us out in this thread, Epoch of Thought, or better yet message me on discord and we can see if you'd be a good fit for us.    [https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT](https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT) 
---
Im not expecting one, but if there is, ill probably hop on long enough for the WEEEEE IM PLAYING CLASSIC feeling, also to kill a couple things just to see how much smoother it feels than private servers. The servers wont be up long enough to really get much done anyway because it would mainly be for stress testing and a glorified trial...although there likely wont be a public one, it'll be done as usual in waves of randoms.
---
Yes, this is not uncommon. The thing is, in raiding you don't really need Holy Shock (Holy 31 point spell). The most important thing is getting down to Illumination and you can max out that with 20 points into Holy. You will, however, not be a full ret spec. This is because in vanilla most talent trees in the lower tiers have dual roles, essentially so you can main one spec and move a little into another. Look at Holy, tier 1 Divine Strength and tier 2 Improved Seal of Righteousness as well as the tier 3 spell Consecration - all DPS talents. 
---
Now, the lucky part is, since Spiritual Focus (tier 2) is not really that needed you can get both Divine Intellect and Divine Strength in tier 1 Holy, making paladins one of the best for these kind of hybrid specs.
---
Lastly, I'd advice you to try 21/0/30. Repentance is strong mostly because it allows you to chase (has a 20 yard range), but the problem is you have no snare (for example a warrior who charge would follow up with Hamstring). So most people will just snare you and run away right away. Hammer of Justice is already a 10 yard range, so doesn't need Repentance much. It can also be used to make room for healing, but if you spam heal you run out of mana, which is where the Holy 21 spell Divine Favor comes into play - one Holy Light crit is a lot of healing for just one spell. I personally think such a strong healing spell is much more useful than Repentance in a real fight. Also, Divine Favor is actually useful in PvE.
---
Yes! TBC was my faovorite expansion, I'dlove TBC servers alongside Vanilla ones
---
My oven is on high when i roast the quail
---
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale, exhale
---
Feel the effects I want to get high
---
So high
---
Lol, if you seriously think priv servers are anything like any version of the game when it was live I have serious doubts you've ever played the live version. 
---
Yeah I agree. 
---
Some friends are trying to recruit me to instant servers, in this case with Wotlk. Ive tried but my interest dies after a day with instant levelcap, just grinding heroics to buy gear and all raids already unlocked. 
---
Thanks, but no thanks.

&lt;Brimstone&gt; &lt;US&gt; &lt;PvP&gt; is recruiting dedicated players for the coming release of Classic WoW. -    We are a group of players who have been playing World of Warcraft together for 10+ years. The other GM and I have been raiding since Vanilla. We are looking to use our experience to drive our guild to the top.  -    We are dedicated to being at the top of raiding competition in Classic WoW. While we are looking more for dedicated hardcore players, we are recruiting casuals as well to fill our community! We will always be running and gearing our lower level players in hopes to bring them into the fold at level 60 -    Raid times will be decided closer to the launch of classic WoW -    We will be using a DKP system to distribute loot.  -    We only ask that the player remains dedicated to the class they have chosen and willing to dedicate their time becoming a top tier raider!  Check out our new site to sign up! There you can contact me via the site or follow the discord link to join our active community! We look forward to meeting you!

I think you ARE high. Or, you had a stroke.
---
You've got to factor in Asian prime time. Asian time peaks are generally 2x-3x the NA peaks.

Sooooooo hiiiiiiigggghhh

SL is bad in real pvp as well prior to nax patch where rogues and warriors get out of hand.
---
I am talking both organized and pugs pvp. For world pvp sure why not, you get to attrition out a ganker or 2 but you wont stop em getting away once they realize you are SL.
---
You will be ignored/cc in BGs and your damage will be really low. 
---
You could make a case for a stables/farm defendant but a hunter would do a better job honestly.
---
You could also become a fear meme lord in middle defense in warsong gulch and focus on being pain in the ass for enemy healers but honestly you end up being a waste of a spot.
---
So yeah, outside of high stakes duelz against geared rogues or warriors SL is just bad overall in my opinion.
---
And it also gets dull pretty quick.
---
After naxx patch ils another story where melees get so much out of hand that you are almost required to go SL To not get one shotted.
---
At that point you will have enough spell power To stay relevant and still kill stuff besides T3 paladins.
---
Yup the elemental plateau was one of the best times for sure. That part was honestly kind of cool with flying since it felt exclusive and you only got to farm it once you could fly.
---
And I would gank people as a rogue, then when they did the BS where they just fly away... oh well at least I get the farming spot now.
---
Kinda sucks though because it was only good for me since I wanted to farm it too haha - I wish it would have started bigger fights and turned into a 2nd tarren mill/southshore kind of battle!
---
I was so disappointed at 60. I wanted to play like Uther from WC3. At least I kinda got that feeling from 5mans.
---
&gt; And then the flying Mounts...no more real world pvp.
---
Wrong! Nothing more fun than an aerial attack out of nowhere.
---
I agree with this one the most.
---
Two server groups, One static "classic forever" and one "progression enabled".
---
Not sure about transfers between server groups though, but that is a different debate really.
---
I think this is the only way to ensure maximum subscribers, by giving both player groups what they want, not really sure what the downside it. Consumer choice drives business.
---
I would have characters rolled up on both server groups anyway.
---
I liked to farm mats.  Essences, cloth, arcane crystals, pearls, any humanoid camp that drops runecloth.  I never played a ps so I am trying to take this from memory.  If you play the level 60 game you‚Äôll get some decent drops.  Rep camps for cenarius, argent dawn, and the winterspring furbies will probably be where I start.  Get your recipes, faction, and gold all at the same time.  Hope for solid BoE drops and wait for the economy to have enough cash in it to really profit.  
---
Make sure you find a good guild and a group of friends so you can be a pay it forward type.  Get a good rep with players and you‚Äôll never have to buy spurs or enchants or mage ports, etc.
---
Going for Reckoning is much better defensively, because you don't lose out on all the Protection talents which are a gamechanger in PvP, namely the +6s duration on BoF, the improved Concentration Aura, lower HoJ and BoP CDs, BoK etc.
---
The Retribution tree gives very little in comparison other than raw damage.
---
That said since going 26/25/0 is already very defensive it's hard to justify it over going 31/20/0.
---
No. Simple as that. 
---
Honestly? I wish they did classic as a three-tier server. One for BC, one Vanilla, and one WOTLK. 
---
I played through all of vanilla, but honestly BC was such a dramatic step up from vanilla in basically every way that vanilla feels bare bones in comparison. I really wanted 'old wow' in terms of wow at its peak in BC-WOTLK, not the very earliest version of WoW. 
---
I can't wait. With 40 man no one will notice I'm just AFK and basically just there to get gear.
---
Sincerely, a PvP player.
---
This guys an absolute mong don't worry. He thinks because some people would rather TBC (or any other xpac) that they *must* hate vanilla and want nothing more than to destroy it. Like they compulsive need it to die. He's really weird.
---
Kargoz has a video about the best combos for duo-leveling, so that might be something you're interested in.
---
That cleavage though. No wonder I was so hooked on this game back when I was a horny teen.
---
I agree with all those points, except I think that there is a substantial amount of people who would be willing to keep paying their WoW sub even if they arent actually playing. Or they would come back more often to take another peek. I know I myself am part of that group and I've heard it argued for a lot by esfand and the folks he has on his podcast so I know its not just a niche thing that only I would be interested in. Gaming used to have a lot more permanence than it does these days. The cycles you are describing are much more in line with Diablo ladder seasons than they are with other RPG games where you can have a save file forever. Like right now for instance I could go back and look at my old final fantasy or zelda saved games. I feel like thats one of the key RPG elements that has been taken away and made modern WoW feel more like an Action game than and RPG. Along with the other stuff like homogenization in the name of balance etc etc of course
---
TBC introduced flying mounts, however I don't think that anyone that longs for TBC does it because of the flying mounts.
---
Why so mad bro?
---
I disagree, when I played in BC the community was still growing and it was awesome, and Outland was amazing and mysterious. The vanilla is best crowd seem to think any changes are blasphemy, but TBC, was just a better game. I'll be playing classic because while not as great as bc, it beats any other alternative, and the main hope is that I get to play bc again. Dungeons, heroics, Kara, ssc, tk, bt. Best content they've made. And none of this bullshit about copying your characters to a bc server, no, to me, wow is about progression and the social craze of a new xpac is awesome. 
---
Absolutely. I know people on this sub might disagree, but vanilla WoW felt incredibly restraining and tedious to me. BC was the perfect mix of more refined class design and less tedious mechanics, while still retaining the old school difficulties of old school WoW. Also Outlands questing was SUCH a massive step up from vanilla questing. 
---
That might be, I have not seen this tho. And I was playing retail and I absolutely loved that they kinda acknowledged that flying mounts was a bad idea. No flying mounts = Bigger world.
---
Walk round and find it on the floor. Ez.
---
\&gt;SM every wing had something for everyone
---
*\*Cries in hunter\**
---
What about portals? The rune costs like 20s but I got called a cheap ass for giving a 50s tip... seems like easy profit to me.  
---
Vanilla was the closest WoW ever got to a sandbox MMO. Plus I never liked the fact that every expansion, the good and bad, relegated Kalimdor and EK to "old content" status. I've done the rest already, I just want to go home without the looming threat of the new hotness and it's treadmills. 
---
I'm not opposed to TBC servers, so long as we get to keep the Classic ones. 
---
It would be hypocritical to say that TBC/WotLK are games not work making (wall of no, anyone?).
---
My only interest would be to clear Kara, that was a fun raid (what I got to see of it anyway). Cozy.
---
Well you can always log back in on your classic version character and complete what you missed.
---
Maybe your guild didnt quite kill KT in the end, but wants to be in the TBC race. So all energy is put into TBC, but you come back to Naxx every two weeks to try to get it done or smth like that.
---
It also gives you the most proper representation of starting out in TBC as a vanilla player.
---
Also, there are often a ton of quests for each dungeon. Most people only gather some of them, but then there might be a few hidden in random zones or some random house in IF.
---
Several quests might require more than one run, so it feels less as a "waste", since you quests to do. Sure it's not as efficient as pure questing, but it allows for a middle ground between running dungeons randomly and min/maxing xp.
---
Discovering food buffs was one the biggest steps in learning the game.  I immediately put leveling on hold to get my fishing/cooking up to snuff.
---
I was a Druid who had a mage best buddy. I would farm cloth for him, and he would give me food, water and portals all the time for free. Gahhhh I miss those days. 
---
Thank you, quite informative!
---
Umm okay I guess..? To me all tanning specs are easy warrior is just straight boring. It‚Äôs basically two buttons. Only hard thing about warriors is leveling up because they face roll meters with no skill and if you look at tanking they are easy also. Once you know your specs rotation then every single class is easy bro.
---
I am already concerned about getting burnt out (played vanilla under heavy time restrictions) so; no.
---
\&gt;4 letters in "Train"
---
\&gt;The math checks out.
---
No, I quit during BC the first time around.  Didn't care for the zones and it felt like starting over from scratch.  I', not really a fan of Draenei either.
---
Pservers
---
Hello, I'm thinking about rolling a hunter or a mage, i'm leaning more towards the hunter but I'm not sure how good a hunter is in pvp compared to other classes. Is it as good as a mage? If anyone could help me out here. thanks.
---
Sure.
---
Just make it clear beforehand. Most guilds won't have a flat 40 members (IANAGL, YMMV).
---
You either find the right guild, or you find others like you and make the guild.
---
I had a great guild like this in TBC. It was run by a husband/wife couple for the sole expressed purpose of NOT being hardcore but still raiding. There were no rules on attendance numbers, the only rule was that you communicated on the forums when you'd be available and when not. We had tons of members but very little turn over. People would take a month off for exams, summer vacation, take care of a baby, or just because. Often people who were able to raid more regularly to give a spot to those who were able to raid that week but who we knew for real life reasons weren't able to be there on a regular basis. Obviously we weren't breaking any speed records, however the guild made slow but steady progress and had very little drama.
---
If we could pull this off in TBC with all its crazy ass attunements and more involved raid mechanics, I'm pretty sure it'd be doable in vanilla.
---
If you want to see phasing (not sharding) in action by accident to see how frustrating and confusing it is, see [this video.](https://youtu.be/lPBqj8pYyx0) If you want to see someone blatantly abusing this, see [this one](https://youtu.be/RuYd7wKZBA0).
---
Not even a hard decision.  I'm a holy Knight not a Cleric.
---
If no fish, why live?
---
Full Ret all the way, heathens be chatting shit but you gonna kneel
---
At least pugs will take you, dedicated semi hc guilds will think twice. The semi hc and hc guilds usually have dates set up before hand, so if you can dedicate like 3h twice a week ie sundays and thursdays 19pm-21pm for no work you should be fine. If you run 12h shifts that are night/day cycle by weeks and you cant affect that you are screwd.
---
On the other hand, then it might be better to look for a new job.. ;)
---
What are the biggest Asian vanilla wow pservers?
---
Fishing, Cooking and Alchemy = Win
---
Your explanation reads like a high school paper, written by someone who believes taking business and politics electives makes them worthy of their condescending tone.
---
Your opinion is solid, but lay off the age remarks, it reeks of chest thumping.
---
Yarr...this chair is high says I!
---
The two factions *were actually different* in a way that was meaningful. Having exclusive classes was awesome and I don't know why more people don't realize this.
---
The same ones as NA. They just peak early 3-4am. 
---
But it didn't make sense if you had only x amount of time and wanted to do both, right? 
---
Good point about Outland and Northrend. I really expected Northrend to be a winter wasteland. A mix between Dragonblight and Stormy Peaks. If it was just those zones + Colderra(sp?) and IIC with an underworld of Azhul Nerub, I think it would be much more fitting. 
---
Well, google which zones you have available for any particular level. Often you will have something like 3 zones within level range. Now, the thing is most zones can't be completed in their early levels (for example Duskwood is 20-30, but even at 25 you can't do all quests).
---
So I'd suggest you simply know which zones you have available and just go quest in all of them. When you run out of quests in one zone move on to the next one, then later come back to the first to look for more quests. With dungeons I'd suggest google where you can get dungeon quests, as half of them are in really random zones, like some that are way below the level of the dungeon or in a random house in IF. This grants quite a lot of extra xp if you wanna do dungeons, and you can often pick up the quests when trying to find a group.
---
Lastly, do know that you will have to grind a bit. The "speed leveling" way is to grind everything you see on your way. While you don't need to take it to the extreme, try when for example running from one end of the zone to the other and look around. Kill some mobs on the way. Also, if you have the knowledge (or like to google), some zones have mobs that drop items that sell for quite a bit. For example, hyenas in Desolace or Jaguars in Swamps of Sorrows both drop grey items that sell for quite a bit. You can earn several gold just by killing them on your way back and forth. I'd also suggest to try and enjoy some grinding. Personally I find it quite fun to grind as long as it's not too long. So when you feel like no-braining or watching something on Netflix or whatever, just go kill some mobs - it adds up.
---
I wish I could go back Outland, visiting the Oshu'gun mountain and farm my mote of shadows once again.. My longest, well spent farm  I ever made. #Shadowweavetailor
---
I usually tip 1g in cities. Usually people that will answer your request for a port in a city are either so poor that 1g is enough for them, or they're so rich they just want to help and don't care about the gold.
---
In dungeons mages seem to just make portals out of courtesy, never have seen one ask for a tip.
---
Culture probably will vary depending on server, not sure. Pservers have abnormally knowledgeable players so retail Classic might be very different in unexpected ways.
---
I have enough gold to play the AH maybe 20min a day and _possibly_ make enough for a token. If I have to leave Thunder Bluff, its not worth it. 
---
I think many people might not actually be able to fully judge what they prefer because most pservers that goes noticeably higher than blizz-like server cap use dynamic respawns. Not to be rude to people that might prefer it, but I just don't think a lot of people actually *tried* 5k with blizz-like respawn.
---
Not to mention the random drops from fishing in floating debris.
---
How would you feel if you were on a WotLK server and it was being progressed to Cataclysm?
---
Releasing TBC and WotLK is just kicking the can down the road and killing the servers it leaves in its wake.
---
It's been years waiting for an official release of Vanilla, we're at the cusp, and people are already crying at fever pitch for expansions. The fucking thing hasn't even released yet.
---
Losing Vanilla a second time won't be a fun experience.
---
No but if you think rag won‚Äôt be killed week 1-2 you are crazy.  It wasn‚Äôt killed back in the day because it was new and people didn‚Äôt know what they were doing.   If you think nowadays people won‚Äôt hit max level much faster, know all their BIS and correct talents. You are crazy.   I‚Äôm on the side advocating for pushing the DM release further back.   To say it‚Äôs fine to come out right away because over a decade ago no one killed rag before it came out Is just being ignorant.
---
Not the best examples but [here](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=20066) and [here](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?spell=26023).
---
I feel like Repentance was severely overlooked, at least in PvP.  Use it as a ranged interrupt.  Allows you to get the bonus damage when you Judge your Seal of Command.  Pretty useless outside of ZG in a raids but I loved the ability.
---
He's saying his leveling speed outpaces his ability to effectively level cooking. I.e. the economic trade-off of buying vendor food is preferable to dedicating his time to leveling cooking, shopping for recipes or grinding in locations where recipes are likely to drop.
---
Good point! I love your optimism :D.
---
Though, I‚Äôd love to have that **one** account I do everything on, you know what I mean? That‚Äôd be amazing. I just don‚Äôt know what to main... :(
---
I usually let incredible idiots like you slide, but I'm going to add you to the "I told you so" pile. It never gets old.
---
People are so ignorant and/or stupid that they don't realize release Classic will be incredibly more inaccurate to Vanilla than any blizzlike pserver is.

---
You have to have a REALLY low salary if farming gold is more efficient way of earning money for you.
---
Hmm, I think I get your point. With around 20% crit, I assumed that the dps difference between a DS/Ruin lock and an SL lock (with sacced succubus) is around 5-10% dps (which I personally wouldnt consider gamebreaking).
---
However, the raid dps suffers more because I am missing 3% crit due to 2/5 devestation, thus I am contributing less to keeping improved shadowbolt stacks on the boss. Plus I am 'stealing' imp shadowbolt stacks with my lower dmg shadow bolts.
---
I never raided in vanilla. Is it common that the imp shadowbolt stacks fall of the boss? (Due to warlocks/sps consuming it but not reapplying because of no crits)
---
I want to be a Smite Priest. I need to convince one of my friends to roll a Ret pally so we can holy smash.
---
And then maybe a Shockadin.
---
Otherwise, I never got that Hunter to max level back in the day.
---
&gt; I'm wasting my time that could be useful spend on wow tokens to get game time.
---
That‚Äôs the dumbest thing I have heard.
---
Why do you think you will lose it? There is obviously a large group of people who wants Vanilla Classic servers. So I see no reason to fear that these might disappear. 
---
If they introduce TBC servers, I'm pretty sure they will give an option for people to migrate their characters to said servers while still keeping up a good portion of Vanilla servers so people can play both.
---
Female Dwarf looked good in early development.  Female Orc still the bad ass.
---
This really is something I'm worried about with Classic. I totally get the #nochanges, but at the same time Vanilla is just full of things that Blizzard surely wanted to change, but didn't get around to and probably worse, things that people were too dumb to do back then, but the majority knows about now.
---
Gamers are not only better today, but also got waaaay more information available on the internet. Sure we want an authentic vanilla experience, but what if something like the economy is total and utterly destroyed due to exploits or methods that people didn't know back then? That will ruin both the farming part of the game as well as people who like using AH. Wouldn't a tiny change to something actually be closer to no change? 
---
With Vanilla they hit a secret formula that just works.
---
Devs and players can debate forever what that formula is.
---
All I know is, vanilla got it right. Change as little as humanly possible. Give us our fucking game and we‚Äôll pay 
---
People have tried up to around 5k with blizz-like spawn. Nostalrius and the current largest active private server kept blizz-like spawn up until around the 4k to 5k mark, after which the community demanded dynamic spawns. Neither of them had dynamic spawns at the beginning.
---
However what you're saying is also true, we really only have one type of server to judge from: massive pop private server with dynamic spawns. We don't have anything to compare that to. 
---
It's not that I distrust Blizzard - I distrust you. And everyone else on this sub.
---
50% of the things you've mentioned are things that I actually like and would improve Classic for me. But it would obviously break it for you. On the other side there are things that would break Classic for me, that you maybe would like.
---
The problem is not Blizzard, the problem is that even we could not agree on how to improve Classic. That's why I want no changes.
---
The literal moment TBC servers are announced, Vanilla servers will start crashing. People will stop progressing Naxx, guilds will disband in mass, etc. Exactly what happened in retail and exactly what happened with every pserver that has ever progressed (even with optional character copying where you can keep the char on both servers).
---
People still play, but it‚Äôs no where near the numbers it used to in its heyday.  
---
myep if it wasnt for expansions we would have definitely seen more tweaks done to vanilla
---
it was already happening 
---
I can relate to this too much.
---
No, and I say that as someone who played the crap out of both. TBC is the reason pservers started up in the first place. It's not a game that would work well on a legacy server, as it is geared to casual play and catch up mechanics. The replayability you would get on TBC vs. vanilla is just a fraction... Like less than 10%. By opening TBC, Blizzard would be committing to doing all the expansions over again, which I suspect they don't want to do. Vanilla is great as a stasis server because replayability is endless with alts, and there is so much to do it would take over a decade of hardcore play to "beat" the game.
---
I didn't do *no* quests, but the ones I did were far and few. Generally if someone had a piece of gear or pointed one out for me, I'd do it, but that's about it. I remember wanting to craft Phantom Blade and someone suggesting I wait and do the quest in Mara? for a 1h blue sword. That's one quest I did.
---
I played a rogue and was largely daggers until combat later on. My spec was 1/1/1, 2/2/2, until I learned this didn't work and someone pushed me to play combat.
---
I can't tell you everything I grinded.. but 1-6 I just grinded the zombies/skeles on the deathknell road. After that it was bats and hounds north of UC. Then I got to Orgrimmar and found the thunderlizards and grinded those forever. I would skin them and sell their hides to a vendor, and would buy the white vendor armor.
---
Some other places I remember grinding: yeti cave in Hillsbrad, those thistle lurker things in SW corner of Tanaris, Naga on the shore in Azshara, elves(?) just north of the shore in Azshara, lots of random things in Barrens like more thunderlizards, the pig guys, tons of crocodiles in shimmering flats (skinned and sold leather for mount).
---
I did *tons* of BGs, which I would turn marks in for XP. I did a ridiculous amount of dungeons too, running RFD/SM for ages.
---
I can't remember who it was but I was telling someone quests were a waste of time and to just grind, and they informed me that quests were in fact the way to go.
---
I know it seems unlikely but yeah I would spend hours and hours grinding in between chain running dungeons and doing BGs. Took me forever to get to 60.
---
I played pservers for years before the announcement and only after that I learned about all that gold farming techniques.
---
It would not have been much of a problem if people were not screaming about that on every corner. 
---
We won't know what is what for sure until we are in Azeroth playing it live.
---
So everyone needs to stop guessing about stuff.
---
   
---
I am probably one of the few players that already bought the tokens for Classic. Being a Vanilla vet, and playing all the expansions, focusing on making gold since WOTLK, I already bought enough tokens to max my bnet balance, with 10 tokens (max possible) in the bags of my retail main banker.
---
But, even if this wasn't the case, I would NOT play retail to make gold to buy tokens.
---
$15 is not a big deal. One hour of work for me.
---
For a 15 year old game with a subscription fee id say they.have impressive numbers.
---
I could see Northrend and Outland being designed for groups, with enemies more comparable to what you would find in dungeons than what you would find in regular areas.
---
Shattrath and Dalaran could still be cities as long as they don't make other cities obsolete. That mostly means not having portals to every other major city within them.
---
Although personally I would prefer if Dalaran stayed in Lordaeron.
---
I had a Ret pally vanilla and did fine healing in raids with a 21/0/30 build(only up to twins in AQ40).  For some reason I was better at mana management than other healers(higher crit= more free heals maybe?).  You need to keep two sets of armor for dps and heals though.  Just be prepared to not get good dps plate until after your guild has a raid on farm.
---
Yeah, I don't think there is even a "maybe". Blizzard openly admitted a ton of things were never completely finished in vanilla.
---
Sweet, this helps a lot, thank you. Do you have any other suggestions for grinding vendor trash that pays well?
---
AM I THE ONLY ONE!!!???
---
Threw them already. Not going to minmax.
---
Yup! Ill be levelling as SPriest with a plan to go holy at end game. My levelling buddy is rolling a Warrior, should be a good combo for PvE, PvP and world PvP.
---
Mage as an alt for those AoE farms.
---
No. 
---
True is, there really isn't much difference in leveling speed between the three trees unless you spam LB as elemental and are okay drinking all day. With a 1H with FT and a shield, or a slow 2H the difference is negligible. Most talents scale much better with gear and stats you just won't have while leveling such as elemental fury and flurry. 
---
3% hit for both melee and spells is great to have while leveling. It increases efficiency by a notable amount. I start by going into enhance to get improved Ghost wolf 2/2 At level 20. Then into resto getting imp HW. Make sure to have 2H spec in enhance by 28 for Corpsemaker. Then continue into resto for totemic focus, natures guidance and totemic mastery. You'll look like this at 36: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxVbzZx0ez
---
From there, continue deeper into enhance for flurry. Flurry is better once you get more crit% and with a slow weapon, sometimes you don't crit. You can also go Healing focus. I wouldn't ever go past NS for any reason before level 60. You just don't get much return.
---
You'd think so, but the private servers have given me the opposite impression.
---
the number of obviously white men using racial slurs to try to seem "edgy" in guild discords was abundant enough to make it my new prio.
---
They've done that for like the last 4 expansions.
---
Are you really comparing pservers to Blizzards servers? Come on. Atleast apply some logic if you are to spread negativity.
---
If Blizzard first puts in an enormous job to recreate WoW vanilla, they aren't just gonna shut down these servers the moment they see a drop in it player count. That makes absolutely no sense.
---
The design decisions that they've taken for player expediency - to reduce travel and queue times - like flying, like cross-realm battlegroups, like group finder, LFR, and CRZ, have all eroded the sense of community and of inhabiting a shared world. 
---
That said, the major design decisions that they've taken in their expac model: new zones, new level caps with new skills and talents, big jumps in mob &amp; gear power, catch-up mechanisms, reducing levelling time, new races, new classes, have been necessary to keep the game alive for fifteen years. Without those things I'm sure WoW would've withered to nothing by now.
---
I also think class balance matters, but class homogeneity is unwelcome. Vanilla was too imbalanced but is something they were better at in mid-WoW expansions (say BC -&gt; MoP), and by WoD they seemed to have moved fully to a homogenous anyone-can-do-anything model.  
---
There is something I've been thinking about lately. All of this makes me think about capcom a few years back. I am an RE fanboi. It is my favorite franchise of all time by far. Most ppl know its progression from item management and puzzle based survival horror to full on Micheal Bay style action shooter.
---
The community spent years telling capcom they were messing up. I followed it closely. I gave every game a chance and felt more disappointed with each installment after RE4. It mirrored this situation to a t. Started with small changes each game, snowballing until it was nearly unrecognizable from the perfection it was in the first game.
---
Through all this, capcom constantly replied with, basically, "its ok guys we are putting things in for you and the others who like more action dont worry blah blah blah."  It seemed hopeless. But then one day, something beautiful happened. They actually started listening. They made the same promises as usual, but actually followed through on them.
---
Ive always presumed the cause was monetary. RE6 hqd probably the biggest budget, the biggest and most misleading ad campaign and swiftly ended up in the 5 dollar bin at gamestop within a month. But whatever the reason, they actually turned it around. RE revelations 2 was the best game we'd seen in years, RE7 was even better. A true game changer. Now, the remake of the most beloved installment has released to rave reviews and is being called their best remake yet.
---
It was a one in a billion occurrence that may never happen again. It could end with the next game, who knows. But the moral of this story is that things can possibly turn around, but only if the fanbase speaks with their wallets. This whole dream situation happened because the hardcore fanbase stopped buying. The rail shooters, the weird linear mess of an rpg like idk what, and finally the 6th major title release all bombed horribly.
---
That is what it took. That is what it will take for blizzard. Its unlikely, sure. But not impossible. Classic may be the turning point if they do things right. Probably not. But one day, when the last big chunk of dedicated players finally throw in the hat, they might wake up. I just wanted to get this off my chest because ive been thinking about it a lot lately.
---
Yeah, this is one of the things (staging content and then trickling it out) that I feel like the new technology (server/client etc) is going to make better/easier for them.  They've put a lot of work into de-syncing patch cycles and game content drops in the last few years.
---
I disagree. I find that you make an even better connection when raiding with the same 40 people over and over again. Becomes a big family of sort :)
---
I like the idea of Outland and Northrend essentially being open world dungeon content.  But that might be too niche to successful.
---
Well, aside from those two there is elemental farming. Basically you farm elements to get Essence of Fire or other elemental types. For this you might want to google a bit, several guides on the topic. The thing is, depending on the current content different Essences might sell for more. This also means some Essence is worth holding on to in the bank until a certain patch.
---
It‚Äôs the same game in name only, be honest. There‚Äôs a reason they don‚Äôt share subscription numbers anymore. Some guesses are 1/10 of peak. The only thing that keeps the modern game afloat is people are gullible enough to spend money on the cash shop.
---
I have your perfect answer.  This is what you need to do.  Spec SL for PVP only.  Then raid in PUGs.
---
But honestly...SL doesn't get good until you are wearing some T3 anyway, so until then it's meh.
---
Ele/Enhance shamans with both a weapon damage proc (say Axe of the Deep woods or Hand of Rag), Darkmoon card Maelstrom and Heart of Wyrmthalak. 
---
Either with storm strike or elemental fury(they all count as spells which get the critical damage bonus), these weapon and trinket procs add a pretty huge chunk of damage. Fun stuff to mess around with. 
---
Flametounge / frost brand, weapon ele proc, and the dual trinkets... so many elemental attacks. Weeeee
---
The most unique item I can think of that people don't really know of or ever seem to talk about are these. [Black Grasp of the Destroyer](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22194).  I can only think of a select few items in the game that can be considered having a game changing mechanic, but these could allow a ele melee or enhance shaman to actually put out consistent dps via the constant mana leech. Also useful for hunters too.
---
I always had trouble with the size of my quest log. I would do great until maybe level 20 something when more than one zone opens up for me. I'd have quests that want me to take this item here or there, quests that turn from green to red quickly, and i'd always be 20/20. I'd have to abandon some, saying I would pick them back up later only to forget where to pick it back up. Eventually I would find myself with an all brown/red quest log with nowhere to obtain quality quests. For this reason I find myself in dungeons and grind spots probably more than most players. The good part is I make bank and always have better gear to fend of pvpers. 
---
Firy blaze is actyally reeeeeeeeeally bad in dungeons because it will break sheep etc ;(
---
One "item" that not many people think of is invisibility potion. Its very nice to have on a pvp server if you ever get camped and need to get away.
---
But talking about tanks. One AMAZING potion is lvl 33 Oil of Immolation. 50 fire damage every 3sec for 15sec. Its veeeeery nice for a tank to have. I donno if its a private server thing but on Nost it didnt have any cooldown so it was always available on aoe pulls.
---
I think seasonal is the best option if we consider only Vanilla. If implementing future expansions I would prefer static servers with option of lateral character copy.
---
It wasn't though? It was very specifically only at level 70. Straight from the manual: ["Upon reaching level 70, players can obtain a flying mount."](http://us.media.blizzard.com/manuals/wow/wow-bc-manual-enUS.pdf#page=19). Also see the requirements on the old [flying mounts info page](https://web.archive.org/web/20071211015057/https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/mounts/flying.html). The only class that got flying at level 68 was Druids, and only after patch 2.1.
---
Never said it was
---
Hey Hoofootwow, I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
Oh I'm so ready for this episode. I was a true DnT fanboy back in the day. I was so stupid as a kid I rerolled a dwarf warrior on Korgath after seeing their Sapphiron teaser, half-convinced I was going to get recruited to the guild and tank for them in Naxx. Obviously, y'know, I was gonna need the extra frost resist. I'm still slightly salty about them losing WF KT. 
---
Love this post maine &lt;3
---
So you didn‚Äôt see the massive amount of xp you got from the quests? You didn‚Äôt notice your xp bar move? I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre lying as much as I am baffled how you made it that far without realizing it. It had to have taken forever to get to 60 like that.
---
Why not just start new TBC servers with paid character transfers to the new TBC server? All this ‚Äúcopying‚Äù is just people trying to get a service blizzard has offered since classic for free. 
---
Besides in BRD Oil of Immolation us superior to get AoE Threat as a warrior. Good comment
---
Totally forgot about the gloves - yep These are quite awesome.
---
How about mixing in Ironfoe or Hand of justice in the shaman?
---
Warrior/shaman is a great combo too. Tank/healer for dungeons and great buff synergy, particularly when the shaman gets windfury totem.
---
There is this one handed sword, it is a quest reward from a guy hidden away in Silithus..
---
I'm not. It always seems like priests are rare. This poll seems much more likely than the largest.
---
If you are fast leveling I'm quite sure cooking and fishing are out of the question. I know I never bother leveling th. 
---
Oils in General are strong as fuck, but yeah the immolation oil is awesome. I actually still used it in TBC as its a flat 16.67 DPS per target.
---
My brother was a mage and his guild leader(also a mage) showed him it and as a paladin I hated him for being able to farm it. This was during vanilla retail.
---
I've always thought the best solution would be to have a one-way character copy from vanilla to TBC, and then maintain the two characters as "linked". The TBC character is a *future* version of the vanilla character.
---
So if you make gold in vanilla, you can one-way transfer it to TBC. That gold can only be spent once: in vanilla or TBC but not both. This also solves the "give gold to an alt and copy again" issue.
---
But if you get a piece of gear in vanilla, you should be able to use it in both expansions. So items can be *copied* from vanilla-&gt;TBC, but if so the vanilla item becomes soulbound, its sell value becomes zero, and it cannot be consumed (e.g. food). By copying it to TBC you're promising that that item will remain intact through the rest of vanilla.
---
Fuck, so sorry, just realised - all fixed now!
---
My bad! So sorry about that, fixed now.
---
Thanks for letting me know, sorry about that, have edited the link and should be working now.
---
Then you get retail players voting en-masse to make the game more similar to retail. 
---
&gt; Will you play retail
---
Ha ha no, no won't.
---
Hey _BreakingGood_, I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
All about that homemade cherry pie!
---
I was the same for LFG. At first I was like "holy shit this is amazing, no more waiting forever." Then a month or so later I realized "This sucks, I never talk to anybody in my group anymore." 
---
Below level 50, 50s is fine. 50+ it should be the standard 1g tip.
---
Check out the classic forums. It‚Äôs been a while but posts do happen.
---
Thrall ftw
---
I played heavily up through Lich King and lightly after that. There are things I like in both Lich and BC. However, I think Classic is where I want to say for a few key reasons. 
---
The first is I no longer wish to be part of the grinding/gearing rat race that comes with new expansions. I want to settle into a setting and community for a more long haul setup. 
---
Second, both BC and Lich significantly shrink the world. Everyone gravitates toward those new land masses and the old world suffers for it. Classic's content is much more spread. The world simply feels more alive to me. 
---
Preach. I keep telling people let‚Äôs play this game first. Who cares about 2- infinity years from now. Let‚Äôs play vanilla first.
---
Yeah a good alternative would be to remove 60% flying mounts entirely. Keep epic flying at 5k gold and potentially lock it behind some raid progression. 
---
There's a low level Horde quest that rewards Really Sticky Glue, an item that roots the target for 30 seconds or something like that. Used that stuff all the time in PVP at level 60. Also from a low level Horde quest is Slumber Sand that puts the target to sleep. 
---
It's a 2 sec stun with half second cast. It's a nice extra tool but not game changing in any way.
---
&gt;Are you really comparing pservers to Blizzards servers? Come on. Atleast apply some logic if you are to spread negativity.
---
I dont see this as negativity. I see it as a real fear that it will go just as it did last time. He is making a good point about servers dying as we do in fact have a sample size of 1 when it comes to TBC releasing. There where players that kept on playing vanilla but classic world of warcraft did in fact die when TBC was announced and if not then, when it was released. And I'm pretty sure /u/EverydayFunHotS meant them crashing as **in your server is dead**, and now they have to merge servers and disrupt communities to get some severs kick started, as many and more have left for TBC. 
---
I dont see why they would piggy back the tbc expansion on the vanilla servers, i dont support any kind of character copies. Even having 2 kinds of servers in the absolute beginning, 1 where you are open to expansions and 1 where you are not is splitting the **vanilla** community and if they want TBC so badly they can start a movement to get it, completely disconnected from the vanilla servers.
---
Nobody knows about your raid performance in Iron forge. They see your t3 shoulders though. 
---
What the hell is wrong with you americans, it's **maccheroni** wtf is macaroni?
---
I have some questions regarding Enhancement Shaman in PvP, since that is one of the options I'm considering right now should our group of people go for Horde.
---
- In practice, is it possible at all to kite Warriors or Rogues? Enh shaman has been my main char on live since BC, and the thing that continually kept the class fun for me was having a lot of mobility and control with the combination of ghost wolf, frost shock and earthbind totem against melees and the low cd interrupt+grounding totem against casters (as well as a bunch of other stuff). Does that strategy work okayish enough in Classic without instant ghost wolf or am I practically locked in a melee fight to the death once a Warrior or Rogue is on top of me since I can't escape their hamstring or crippling poison/stuns?
---
- How bad are the mana problems and how is it affected by different playstyles? I assume spamming high level shocks is a sure way to go oom, but how much does spamming totems impact my mana (for example placing some air totem, then grounding, then another air totem again), how often can I heal before going oom etc?
---
I really like playing an offensive support kind of role with purging the right targets, placing the correct totems and picking the fights that I can win, but I'm quite scared that I will be completely defenseless against Rogues/Warriors and have to go for an Elemental/Resto build to have fun in PvP, in which case I might consider going for a different class altogether.
---
? ? ? That‚Äôs natural? Dno why u would complain about a natural progress that happens in every mmorpg? New content = new better gear, that‚Äôs just how it is
---
I was definitely oblivious. I think I did notice the xp from the dungeon quests, and eventually did them whenever someone shared, but it never dawned on me that regular quests were just mini version of this. My mind just never made the connection since I was so used to grinding in Runescape, and quests like "cooks assistant" being completely useless in runescape.
---
It did take forever. I actually stopped playing at around level 45 for a while before coming back. My /played was around 20 days I think when I finally hit 60.
---
I had a blast in Vanilla but now that I'm aware of how its supposed to go, I realize I'm going into leveling 'blind' and it's going to be very inefficient. I'll probably try to loosely follow a guide because of this.
---
The WoW community has all aged pretty substantially. We all work, have school, kids, other responsibilities. There will be a LOT more in terms of casual raiding guilds this time around, you've just got to find one. 
---
What about Gauntlets of Divinity from Scarlet Commander Mograine?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=7724
---
Not to say specs are very important though. I'd like to see a paladin heal without 5/5 Divine Int, 3/3 Healing Light, 5/5 Illumination and 5/5 Holy Power.
---
Thanks mate!  Hopefully more will start finding the site to sign up and maybe some old guilds can re-kindle.
---
I have had no problem with this, just level my cooking at the same time!  It is fun to discover new recipes from NPCs
---
The appeal of flying wore off quickly and it has not aged well. It trivializes content, it significant shrinks the game and it made the devs jobs harder to do. They have actually stated on several occasions, that if they had it to do over - they would not. 
---
good bot
---
Well, there *are* a few useful items, but nowhere near as much as for other classes. SM is amazing for most classes, only a few worthwhile things for hunters.
---
orrr .. or maybe.. u might learn a thing - its not a Community perception that "some" speccs dont work. u can be the best pala ever and learn me allllllll about how to play it - but i tell u, no pala og druid tank will ever take naxx 40 - no matter what the Community thinks - no taunt = no tanking bro. sorry
---
It might lose it's "hype" momentarily, but that is not at all the same thing as Classic WoW disappearing. Which is what we are discussing here. You can not compare the retail vanilla to tbc transition with what is gonna happen today, because of the hype involved in a totally new xpansion.
---
The points to splitting the community I can absolutely agree to, but then again not what was discussed here. And I do believe that at some point in the future the community for the first Classic servers will drop off either way, people are not gonna clear Naxx over and over again on fully T3 geared characters forever. People get bored, even of vanilla.
---
Hey Spectralwhale, I hope you have a wonderful day.
---
Shadow Resist Gear + Aura ... Watch them waste their Mana on Manaburn, Fear or Curses.
---
When I heard about Vanilla wow coming out.
---
I ventured in starting my own online business (help others start own business w/ social media marketing)..so I can work from home LOL
---
also started to browse to "reddit work online" to find jobs remotely and doesn't have any specific schedule to work
---
Almost to the level where I can quit my 9-5 grind 
---
I got until summer! 
---
There's a cooking quest (alliance) or recipe (horde) in every zone based off the meat your quest mobs are providing. 
---
Personally, no. TBC was the beginning of the end, and while I think it did some things right (class balance, tiered gear for each spec) the bad outweighs the good by a long shot. Flying mounts, 25 man raids, the retcons, dailies (wrecked the economy) and heroics were just, nah, they weren't for me. 
---
Let alone, I don't think the demand is there for it. Correct me if I'm wrong, but undocumented TBC servers have never been anywhere near as popular as vanilla ones have been, and the demand just isn't there for them. I think that, if blizzard decides to peruse expanding on Classic in one way or another their money would be much better spent developing new content for classic. 
---
That last situation you described hits close to home. In one of my previous jobs we had that happen. The MS SQL DB was only 16GB and fit entirely in memory, but the queue length and disk time was high often and resulted in issues on the application side of things for the end user. It sucked and we were pretty confident it was a Dev issue.
---
I completely agree you have to optimize both sides of the house if you truly want to see any real benefit. 
---
The benefits for us would be doing more with less. Yes, you have to pay one or two systems guys 6 figures, but it's better than paying a team of 5 to do the work that the 1 or 2 can because of the ability to quickly scale up and down, or make configuration changes across to your environment. 
---
So I think the money savings, for my company and team, would be in time not necessarily in resources.
---
I also agree with you that in most situations infra as code in the cloud is something that is not cost effective. For most, it's something that will be very expensive or in most scenarios will be a marginal savings for the company in the end.
---
Most of the infra as code platforms I've seen are not super involved on the coding side. Most systems guys know how to script and DSC, ansible or puppet are just a couple of steps beyond that. 
---
On the other hand, if you want to do custom stuff with the cloud infra platforms, like scaling up and down servers based on the current number of logged in users, that's where you would need to have that skill set.
---
Fun convo by the way. I really enjoy talking about this stuff :). 
---
I had this exact issue for years raiding hardcore Vanilla through WotLK. I was upfront about it and it wasn't a massive issue for the most part. We always had a roster that could handle it. 40 man it was never and issue, but I was a resto shaman so they basically bent over backward to accommodate me until things got difficult and they needed more raiding nights from progression (Ulduar Hard Modes). 
---
It was after midnight when I was writing my post and my brain couldn't remember the word I was looking for.  I thought it was dearth.  I edited my post this morning but this is the first chance I had to reply.  The word I was initially looking for was plethora but for the life of me my brain couldn't remember it at 12:45 in the morning.
---
I played arms with some of these guys during MoP in a little 10 man group before being struck by some RL stuff and never logged on again.
---
Jeydax if you can hear me, it's Wutnaught and I miss ya'll.
---
Mage is not a counterpart but you can make food/water and trade to your friend (and he can trade your lock when you relog) and you can farm a lot of gold ;)
---
Frostbolt  frostbolt  frostbolt  frostbolt frostbolt.
---
Yea try beating that you ultra skilled boomkin. Goodluck
---
And then a hunter kites him back to the base and kills it in within 5 minutes.
---
We'll let you off with a warning this time, but this won't fly on the North American servers.
---
Yeah, I'm looking at you, Canadians!
---
If by counterpart you mean opposite playstyle, pick warrior or pally.
---
Runecloth, gold, good amount of BoE greens/blues/occasional epic, and a few good herb spawns in there as well. 
---
Hunter. Easy to level and fast. Best class for farming. 
---
&gt; Why would I play a game I dont want to play, in order to play the game I indeed do want to play, for free?
---
Exactly.  That's called a "job," and I already have one of those so that I can pay for Classic.
---
Resilience ruined it for me, I liked the idea of pve raid gear being viable in pvp
---
Getting 40 people online all at once "with a mixture of classes" and not a single person DC from the internet. Trying to get 40 people into voice coms and getting all of them ready. Yea half the raid is taken up preparing to do it even before you step on foot into it LOL.
---
Crusader enchant recipe? Black lotus?
---
AV was so great. Fond memories of spamming chat telling people to collect and turn their shit in, then attempting to organize the NPC pushes with players.   
---
I remember doing the goblin tree cutter mech quest, and running around smacking people with it.
---
&gt; It would be great if they did but it probably won‚Äôt happen   
---
What won't happen?  Classic WoW?  That the servers will exist indefinitely?  All that is confirmed of course.  
---
&gt; There will still be new bugs they will have to patch and have to pay developers to solve that  
---
Not really, most of the bug fixes will just be the porting of code oven from retail.  Sure, someone will spend a few hours here and there, but they are *just running a fucking server*, not developing a second MMO.  
---
Anyway, I don't know what your talk about having "hopes up" is about.
---
I Think the biggest issue with it was the fact that it was a final ret talent. Pallies needed aoe or a ranged spell that can hit anyone, some basic damage tool that was lacking from their kit.
---
Instead we got a really underwhelming CC? Sure, saving that one point and putting 11 points in holy gets you consecration...... but that is a really sideways way to get AoE (from the healing tree, no less).
---
Every pserv I‚Äôve played on has had EU time be the primetime, including the current big ones. Those were the numbers I was using - 6.5kish and 2.2kish peak for the top 2 servers. I‚Äôve played them at all kinds of unhealthy hours. NA times are pretty dead but GMT evenings are packed, as EU+NA afternooners are both playing
---
So yeah, assuming there aren‚Äôt huge servers I haven‚Äôt heard of, there‚Äôs no way concurrent pserv players are hitting 40k any day of this week, absolutely no way.
---
Arena was starcraft:  Essentially solved.  Each comp had a series of "moves" and reactions which were basically known from the start.  Victory depended on your skill at executing those moves, and your gear.  It wasn't skilless, in fact it requires a lot of skill, but there is no situation where a comp which was good in the current meta lost to a similar team with marginally worse gear, assuming players with a bare level of competency.
---
Battlegrounds were more AOE2.  Most games were pretty straightforward, but there was a lot more chaos and a team with worse gear was not doomed to die miserably from the start.  Occasional brilliant plays and the ability to capitalize on your opponents mistakes meant that upsets were possible even if both sides played with competence.  On the other hand, balancing this sort of melee is tough if not impossible (actually I would say it's not a desirable goal) and Blizzard at this time was beginning to seriously hate unbalanced things.
---
Part of this is due to scale:  arena is too small and the variables are too few.  Part is also due to Blizzards changing game design philosophy.  They emphasized that each class has an answer to each situation instead of allowing classes to excel in fringe situations.  Hunters get disengange, rogues get shadowstep, classes trade cooldowns and we're back to the beginning (to oversimplify a lot).
---
I can agree that a tank specc without a taunt is not very viable, but you are totally missing my point.
---
Apart from that, you are completly wrong. This is a community perception, a feral druid tank absolutely can play a part of clearing Naxxm, not as a MT, but they are still have their place. Even for high end guilds.
---
And that isn't even what I'm adressing. I'm adressing the average player, and most of you don't even have the skill to max out the potential of your character. So skills are more important than speccs, and the community have a huge part in how we treat the: Shadow priests, ret pallys, feral tanks etc.
---
I have played both vanilla back in the day, and I have invested alot of time in playing on pservers. So I'm not taking this out of thin air.
---
No, i didn't really find BC all that interesting other than just how challenging PVE was. 
---
Yes, actually. That was an issue this last patch.
---
Another warlock?  
---
Is your friend going to be on enough? Maybe level your alt with them and your lock solo on your own time. 
---
While the boomkin gives the mage 5% crit. Yeah, not useful at all.
---
oooh a gyme
---
I want to play beta so that i can report any potential bugs.
---
I want vanilla to be the best it can be.
---
That said I will probably not get into any beta.
---
Haha, yeah I wasn't making the case that people shouldn't invest their talent points :P
---
Nope if i am farming gold it will be in classic i will pay the monthly sub.
---
But the real question: did you actually play Vanilla, and not just Blizzlike Pservers? 
---
&gt;It might lose it's "hype" momentarily,
---
So we have no way of knowing but you can still predict that it will just lose the "hype" momentarily, but we cant compare it to the few examples we have, because 1 or 2 elements are clearly different? I dont see this logic, we have examples and surely should use them. I agree the hype wont be the same but it is in fact a risk the hype is enough to kill most servers.
---
&gt;You can not compare the retail vanilla to tbc transition with what is gonna happen today, because of the hype involved in a totally new xpansion.
---
The hype is real on private servers, and I've seen enough calls for tbc release to know that there is clearly a hype in this community aswell and i have a hard time seeing it not being a hype once again. 
---
&gt;The literal moment TBC servers are announced, Vanilla servers will start crashing. People will stop progressing Naxx, guilds will disband in mass, etc. 
---
You responded to this, with "they wont shut down servers because of player count", when he in fact was worried people will copy their characters and never really return. They then quit wow as their old server is dead and find something more usefull to do with their time **killing the vanilla servers** because we had to release an expansion which might have been the best expansion wow ever got, but still largely inferior to vanilla wow and as far as i know this is not "lets recreate the expansion list" but **"lets recreate vanilla wow"**.
---
Those that want TBC can get their own movement with 200k of their own signatures, that has **nothing to do with vanilla servers**,  
---
Just as I'm expecting the ones who want new vanilla content go get their own signatures and start a movement.
---
Yes i will if i have a chance
---
YES. In fact I'm planning on it. Everyone I knew irl, and in game, told me I was crazy for saying Blizz would do Classic. Even my private server guildmates and friends said "don't count on it". I held out hope. I would say "I know it is coming, it will happen". 
---
It happened.
---
So I will say it here and now, Classic TBC is coming. IT WILL HAPPEN!
---
It's not. 
---
This is your personal opinion though. Ppl can be fan of both Vanilla and TBC, nothing disingenuine about that. Every player has their own favorite period of the game, of maybe even multiple. Theres nothing weird about ppl thinking about or liking "TBC" now Classic is becoming a reality while at the same time liking Classic. 
---
It's not free if you have to spend time to farm them.
---
Agree here 100% That is the way to do it. That way you get both F R E S H people, and also people who want to stay forever. 
---
Even if that stasis server ends up being low pop it would still pay for itself. Hell right now on Lightbringer there are still a few hundred people playing and running naxx (even if they are mostly chinese lol) but that is still plenty of numbers to make it worthwhile to have it hosted on live. Especially when you consider that realm would get a new influx of "lifers" every time a new fresh seasonal server hit its end of life and the people who wanted to stay migrated off onto the same stasis server. 
---
Then you could do things like stop playing the game for a year, then when you finally have time to finish, come back and do naxx. 
---
I think the people who dont understand why some people want this are the same type of people who can currently just no-life a character back up to 60 in a few weeks and have no attachment to it since they have so much time. Most WoW players were actually casual and its very common to have things come up in life that make you put a hold on gaming for a while. These type of servers would cater to that crowd. (This crowd also has disposable income, and a dream.. PLUS they dont even play that often so really its like an LA fitness gym membership model lmao. Get them paying $15 a month while not actually using the equipment. Win/win)
---
Yes, I enjoyed TBC slightly more than vanilla and loved the introduction of arenas and Karazhan in particular. I'm absolutely fine if this never happens though, Classic is a hell of a consolation prize. The servers should be separate than Classic if it happens, and we should have the option to copy our characters from Classic if we so desire.
---
I'd probably switch back and forth, primarily playing on TBC servers I'd imagine. I'm just happy we're getting anything, to be honest. It's going to be amazing to play the game I loved again instead of this bastardized version it's become. 
---
I'm curious, what were the ninja changes?
---
Sounds like a good time, thanks for the respons
---
Retail never crashed, sure some guilds stopped progressing hardcore and took a break here and there, a few disbanded, new guilds were formed in prep for tbc also though. However on all the realms i've played back then the game was still very much growing and the TBC release announcement didn't stop the growth, i feel it ever became more busy. 
---
Pservers might be another thing though, i've only ever played vanilla pservers and never one that also progressed to TBC, so can't   comment on that. 
---
Eh, google bellular, man. Nobody is gonna bother lying to you, though. Defend all you want despite, though i suppose, lol.
---
well...
---
Engineering
---
&gt;Play private server
---
Good luck with that, pissed off (russian) haxor has been dumping on tights rope the last two days.  And all the others suck, looking at you bronos III.
---
I miss being a proper Spriest
---
Here, I'll walk you through it. Go to youtube, search wow undocumented changes, watch as many as you'd like.
---
A bit true, but I do feel that people who PvP at a high level should be able to get gear thats superiour or atleast equal to end tier PvE gear
---
Do it
---
"Casual" 
---
"7 hours a day"
---
U wot m8.
---
I almost threw up a little at the thought of CoEx being considered a snare. I don't know if over the years people found an actual use for it but back in vanilla it was a wasted talent point.
---
Yeah, pally in wc3 has a heal, an armor aura, bubble, and red. Don't give me that bs.
---
Pally raid healing is boring as hell.
---
Go Ret
---
We will grind to 60 as fast as possible so we both have a lot of free time but I want to create an alt just to play here and there.
---
Shamans are difficult. Enha is not just about procs. You have so many variations. I love playing against rogues, you can kite them so easily, shield + 1H, fire shock, earthbound totem and searing totem. Purge is your bestfriend against casters,especially against frost mages and shadow priests. Their shields are absolutely useless against you. Shamans are surely one of the most fun classes to pvp. If you learn how to play it ofc. 
---
Good players tend to play good specs because being ineffective isn't fun. It's mostly bad players who insist on playing balance or ret. 
---
Interesting, what changes would you like to see in the game/what of the changes did you like?
---
I didn't predict anything, I said it MIGHT lose it's hype. I'm agreeing to your prediciton. But I'm saying that I think Blizzard will still continue to provide Vanilla Classic WoW for future players, even if that happens. That was my case.
---
I thought you were talking about the transition of vanilla to tbc back in the day.
---
I responded to a comment claiming that Vanilla Classic WoW will disappear if TBC is announced.
---
Yeah, I have not one stated anywhere that I'm for TBC servers, and I don't think Blizzard have any plans for this at the moment. Lets just see what happens to Classic WoW and take it from there, I see no reason to fear this at all. If people want TBC in 2-3 years from Classic release, I don't really see any harm in this either and I don't think that will lead to the downfall of Vanilla Classic WoW.
---
I Also work 2 shifts. Same boat. My guild is gonna raid sundays only. That way everyone can join.
---
Heal with a COOLDOWN and a big 2h mace. 
---
***Disclaimer: Straw that broke the camel's back rant incoming***
---
You got me in the 2nd half.  Could mostly/kinda agree with most of what you said up until you used it as a platform to spin yet another whine-session about Diablo Immortal.
---
There's an article out there called "Diablo Fans act like disrepectful edgeloreds at Blizzcon 2018 Q&amp;A".  And it perfectly sums up my feelings about the gaming community as a whole.  The behavior of that particular person @ Blizzcon was atrocious.  Yes, the people AT Blizzcon are usually die-hard fans.  Yes, it was probably not the best decision to announce Diablo Immortal but they did it regardless.  And then the ensuing social media responses with the fucking idiotic, incel, edgelord alternating caps response of "dont you guys have phones" is like the icing on the cake of proving that **The customer is always** **~~right~~** **a petulant manchild.**
---
I HAVE A PC.  I HAVE A PHONE TOO.  I PLAYED THE DIABLO FRANCHISE.  I PLAY GAMES ON BOTH PC AND PHONE AND I'M NOT IN THE LEAST BIT DISTRAUGHT OVER DIABLO IMMORTAL.  IN FACT I'M KINDA LOOKING FORWARD TO A DECENT QUALITY MOBILE GAME. IS YOUR MIND BLOWN YET?
---
What are the odds that someone who plays PC AND MOBILE games is here talking to you now?  God, I must be a fucking unicorn or something that is exceedingly rare.  AMA!
---
HOLY SHIT.  Taco Bell just released the new Chicken Biscuit Taco.   BUT I DON'T LIKE THAT.  I'm GOING TO GO TO SOCIAL MEDIA AND BITCH ABOUT IT!  ....OR....
---
I can go on with my life since a company releasing a product I don't like doesn't hurt me in the slightest.  I mean...that is unless Taco Bell is sending Liam Neeson to my house to hold a gun to my head.  Then I'll buy it...reluctantly I suppose.
---
\*Ding Dong\*  
---
Hold on.  There's someone at the door...
---
# Holy Shit! It's Liam Nee...
---
Took me almost a month,  I actually had to hit 60 twice on my first character.  Dinged while grinding mobs in EPL and skullcrusher completely shit the bed a few minutes later resulting in a 2 hour roll back. 
---
In college, took a little less than 9 days played (which at that time probably meant about 3 or 4 weeks.  Never played an MMO before, but had played all of blizzard's other games plus a metric shitton of counterstrike.
---
Another warlock.
---
I will literally never touch it, even if it's included with my sub. 
---
Having a boomkin in a group of 4 fire mages will increase their dps alot. Do you even vanilla?
---
When people talk about specs, it's obviously from an "everything else being equal" standpoint. Sure, a retard with combat swords is not going to stand a chance against an excellent subtlety rogue, but if you have two rogues of equal skill, the combat rogue will come out on top when it comes to the DPS meters.
---
This is also why people like Esfand can get away with being retribution: He knows his shit and is super dedicated to perform 100%. But if he was as good at playing combat rogue as he is playing ret paladin, I think most people would say that they would prefer it if he was rogue on a progression kill.
---
That kind of depends though for US its authentic to have Dire Maul after launch, for EU is reasonably authentice to have it at launch (EU got Dire Maul 3 weeks after launch). For me personally both options are fine though. 
---
Here's the thing.  What it takes to have good skill, is also often a factor of people who have the best spec.  It's the drive to succeed and to improve.
---
What's the point in spending all those hours honing your craft, if your spec is going to hold you back 20% from your potential?
---
I agree that a good player in a bad spec is better than the opposite, but what about a good player in a good spec? 
---
Are you including non-vanilla servers or not? I am, maybe that is the discrepancy we're having.  
---
Not as much as fire mage number 5
---
Druid is not mana hungry unless your playing an oomkin... you should level feral (no mana) and raid resto which is actually pretty mans efficient once you learn to downrank.
---
Hunter is not that hard install an auto shot timer if your bad at it. 
---
professions aren't class specific, so ret pallies still have the same problem against other engineers.
---
If you‚Äôre leveling really fast, you probably won‚Äôt be able to have cooking or fishing leveled (especially in the first few weeks when nothing will be on the AH). First Aid, however, should be your fallback. That, and find mobs that drop food and kill those.
---
That I can agree to, but that doesn't make it absolute. And that takes nothing away from initial statement: Skills&gt;Speccs.
---
Esfand is not a bad player, and he is gonna play a ret pally afaik.
---
The very first thing I said ‚ÄúAssuming we‚Äôre discussing vanilla private servers‚Äù
---
Ironfoe's proc  rate isn't that high, and a shaman can use any other weapon or windfury to better effect.
---
Hand of justice is better if the shaman is focusing on physical damage like a normal enhance 2h shaman would be rather than on elemental damage.
---
If the buffs were raid buffs we would bring one. But 5 mages is just better.
---
As a 12 year long elemental shaman main I rather saw it diffrently. But I had to roll mage to be relevant aswell.
---
no taunt:(
---
High school , 30-45 days
---
That depends on their base crit.
---
warlocks really do have their dps capped by their threat tho, at least on horde side
---
That explains it, I was going off of the OP's original claim which was just "private servers in general." 
---
I‚Äôm right there with ya, I‚Äôm probably going to start with a class type I never did in vanilla which was healing.... so priest it is!
---
He can do that because he dumps 40 hours a week into running a guild. If he were a regular member it wouldn't really fly. 
---
* Warrior / Priest
---
* Priest / Warrior
---
* Rogue / Druid
---
* Druid / Rogue
---
* Paladin / Paladin (or a pair of Paladin / Tank)
---
* Shaman / Shaman (or a pair of Shaman / Warrior)
---
* Mage / Mage
---
My friend and I duo a lot.
---
I'd say 2-3 years.  And I think it would be the most popular of the 3 expansions (Vanilla, TBC, Wrath).
---
Seems you need to try out Lock haha
---
Yeah, that's kinda my point. I've always gotten validation/admiration from my gameplay, rarely my gear. But then again I only started raiding in WotLK and more seriously in Cata and from what I hear, there's not much you can do to be a good player in raids in vanilla.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_creation_of_US_realms
---
You are the one who needs to get their facts straight.
---
Tally up the realms that opened on release + launched before TBC.
---
You will find that exactly 200 realms launched by the release of TBC. Exactly 100 of them happened to be PvE + RPPvE, and exactly 100 happened to be PvP + RPPvP.
---
But, of course, leave it to Reddit to upvote someone who makes a wildly incorrect statement, without doing any research.
---
No, just the original trilogy, or what some people call the "golden age of WoW". Essentially the game before it died, before Arthas and the main story of Warcraft since Warcraft 1 ended. Vanilla, TBC, WotLK.
---
Just to add some data:
---
I recently leveld a nightelf hunter and got to 20 in around 8,5h on Lightsbringer - Server was totally empty. I also took skinning but no gathering prof. With better route (esp from lvl 17-20) you could get a bit faster. I guess 7.5h could be possible.
---
ehhhhh, I really don't know of any melee class that levels faster than you could level cooking. Especially if you take 20 minutes before level 20 to catch up. You get a recipe or two in every single quest hub and it uses the meat of creatures you'll kill there anyway. The only classes that level faster than you could do cooking would be the 3 casters and hunters. Even then, it's usually worth taking the time to level cooking unless you're racing Joana for world first 60.
---
I'm glad we agree
---
&gt;The downfall of Classic WoW will be that the great majority gets bored after 5 years of the same content.
---
I think so too
---
We have as much confirmed, they will keep servers up and running, I dont suspect they wont keep that promise. 
---
But I'll reiterate that I'm pretty sure he meant vanilla servers will die out, as in not having nearly enough players and community mostly destroyed, but servers still being up, not that they where going to be shut down beceause of low demand.
---
Seems like a solid dude 
---
the uptime naturally increases patch by patch but i'd say in the early MC progression with 5-6 locks their about keeping it up just and just.
---
I really want to play BC again as well a few years after Classic has come out. Copy the server over and keep Classic as is and Id play another few years of BC.
---
This
---
Literally every healer does. Shaman in particular replaces almost every single slot
---
Don't forget more viable specs as well!  (not counting hybrid specs)
---
Nearly every class increased their viable specs, exception being warrior which already had 3 fully viable specs in vanilla.
---
Wait, wasnt Death and Taxes a US guild?
---
WoW came out first for US and months later in EU, and yet Nihilum got world firsts haha
---
US lesser IQ = confirmed
---
Well you‚Äôre gonna have a blast learning all the lore in each zone.
---
Why though
---
It adds to the magic as you keep playing to not waste the free conjured good.
---
it solves class specific problems for the paladin though like getting kited into oblivion
---
And people still hurr durr about how private servers run actual 1.12 and so Blizzard should be able to do it too. 
---
Man, so many pserver idiots gonna get banned and then act all self-righteous about it.  I can't wait.
---
Burning Crusade is my favorite expansion, I would certainly play it. I‚Äôm hoping that Blizzard eventually has it available but I doubt it. 
---
How I hope it works:
---
Classic comes out (obv)
---
tBC comes out and it‚Äôs optional to copy or transfer (more likely although I prefer copy) your character from classic to tBC. Classic remains unchanged. 
---
Possibly other expansions released as well with the same execution mentioned for tBC. 
---
But I think this is more of a ‚Äúholy shit we‚Äôve screwed up this game so much and don‚Äôt many many subscribers left‚Äù type marketing scheme, I doubt WoW classic will last any more than 3-5 years.
---
Personally I think that this is how the expansions should have been released in the past.
---
Honestly, after playing private servers for years I can wholeheartedly say that world PvP is a toxic shit mess. It's incredibly unbalanced, it's really only there to satisfy skill-less griefers. 
---
I used to spam SM because Thottbot indicated that some particular person had a .003% chance to drop Staff of Jordan as opposed to every other mob in the world's .001% chance. 
---
Thing about vanilla WoW, is NOTHING gave huge chunks of exp like retail WoW currently does. You can do a 10 minute long quest and notice your exp bar inch just a tiny bit forward when turning it in.
---
Realistically, just pure grinding is the fastest way to level, but you will burn yourself out so hard doing this unless you're the type of person to be into that. Quest break up the monotony, they help earn little bits of money on top of killing mobs for more loot/exp anyway, and some questlines offer really good gear to help with leveling.
---
Vanilla WoW was...it's unshined form. Quest didn't go seamlessly like the theme park experience it is now. You could finish a quest that's totally your level, but the next quest would be like 6 levels higher than you for some damn reason. You'd go to redridge at 15-18, do some quest there until they started getting in the 23-25 range while you're only sitting at 19-21, so you'd either find a higher level group to tag with, or go back and do quest that were higher in westfall, or the lower end quest in duskwood, maybe even run deadmines. Hell, maybe you even wanted to grind.
---
I wouldn't say there's an absolute best way to level. Just do the quest in the zones as you find them and are comfortably able to do them, move on when quest get too high. Dungeons did get you exp, but you honestly were mostly running those for gear to help your leveling experience, the exp was just some icing on the cake as solo grinding could get you more, though back in vanilla days quest for dungeons were VERY lucrative. The main quest for deadmines generally got you a reward that would last you into your early to mid 30s if you were a leather wearer or mail.
---
If Classic ends up being successful enough to warrant them looking at re-releasing other xpac's, I don't know that I see them forcefully making people transition from classic to BC. I would think they just release new servers for BC. 
---
Whether they would then allow character copies is another topic, but people played on the Classic servers to play Classic, not BC. 
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I work all 3 shifts and have my first child on the way...
---
While I love being a nurse I just wanna play vanilla :-( 
---
So true! I remember running through whirlwinding like a mofo as the group tried to keep up while looting. You definitely get a lot of praise!
---
What are we supposed to discuss?
---
God what a guy...
---
Nice UI btw what do you use?
---
Great. If you wan to play on a pirate server, there's plenty of good ones you can be playing on right now. You don't even need to wait till summer.
---
And that is a skill. Point proven.
---
at what patch were those gloves added?
---
Man, I played warrior in vanilla, but I do /not/ remember seeing that many warriors back then. I'm doubtful of how many people will actually stick with it when they see what leveling one back then is really like.
---
I'm gonna do it all over again,but I feel like a nice chunk of these people going for it will get the experience of missing their heroic strike twice in a row, be swarmed by 3-4 murlocs and realize they have no escape or sustain, and wonder if they wanna barrel through it.
---
Wouldn't us copying our characters to a TBC server screw the classic server? essentially you would have a classic server with nothing but a bunch of level 60s running around and all the zones empty since most would be on bc? ( not empty but no one leveling up)
---
Man. Surprised you got actual discussion. I posted more or less the same question the other day and all I got was a bunch of asshats raging that this question gets posted too much.  
---
Awesome, I have added this to the list. TB &lt;/3
---
no i did :)
---
more so if we copy our characters to a BC server again it would be like  all the lvl 60+ transfer over but the older zones are empty?
---
8.1:
---
Greater BOK/BOW animation was changed. Tooltip text was updated. Boralus portal faces you in a different direction. Certain spell effects made to be more visible.
---
Is this really what people are upset over?
---
8.1.5:
---
Character limit of 50 per realm? Portals being removed?
---
Really? Help me because I'm not going down the rabbit hole to find a needle in the haystack. Where is the TrustBreaker??
---
Uhh... this isn‚Äôt moonguard goldshire...
---
\+1 man was very cool to look at those old models.
---
I honestly feel the game had to grow beyond Vanilla.  However, the peak is something that is maybe 60% TBC, 30% Vanilla, and 10% WotLK.  The problem is that they stopped growing and fixing real issues very early in the expansions, and so later expansions were just innovation for the sake of innovation, or making up problems so they have something to fix.
---
The thing about TBC is that it really doesn't take away from Vanilla in the way other expansions do.
---
* There was no change to XP requirements to level
---
* Very few changes to the actual content of Azeroth
---
* The rating system affected a handful of items while you level, but the new item rules only kicked in in Outlands.  (The biggest of these is that Stamina became more plentiful on gear)
---
* You could port from Shattrath to cities on Azeroth, but couldn't port around Azeroth
---
* Most of the class changes didn't kick in until higher levels.  Most new abilities were grabbed at 62, and a lot of the new talents didn't kick in until the mid-40s.  There were certainly changes that were felt, but not as sweeping as in Cataclysm or MoP.
---
* Class identity was preserved, or even enhanced.  Now you had 3 tank classes with different roles and niches.  You had 5 healing builds that all played different.  Subpar specs got buffs that made them competitive without really changing who they are.
---
The two biggest changes for me (which are both positive IMO) is the PvP revamp and the addition of daily quests.  Honestly, I feel these were bigger changes than things like flying mounts and heroic dungeons.  Because if TBC is released, I plan to have an actual gold farming strategy, and I plan to PvP.  Flying mounts and heroic dungeons I will have as well, but don't see that it will have an effect on my goals and how I pursue the game.
---
This is the mentality I would want going forward.  Where improvements are made without losing what was.  Where changes are made because it's better for the game, and not because it's easier for the players.  Something like another Ulduar would be great!  To fall into the rut that we got in starting with ToC/ToGC would be horrible.  To remove class identity and player input in their build would be horrible.  To add a glyph system would be great (what I was expecting in WotLK was what eventually ended up in Diablo 3).  To make all items morph to your spec would be horrible.
---
No worries :) Both were good listens :)
---
Googled it, went to wow.gamepedia, was thoroughly disappointed with lots of minor changes that are mostly superficial.
---
RET FOR LIFE!
---
ü§® That never stopped huntards needing everything!
---
Fun, easy ride to level 60?  Hunter.
---
Lots of chance on hit and passive effects?  Pick your faction, then go Enhancement Shaman or Retribution Paladin.
---
i can't gank lowbies in goldshire
---
It's 3% crit in vanilla and doesn't come close to making up for their low DPS and mana issues.
---
Probably not, I still remember much of Classic even though it was so long ago. I would like to just re discover anything I might have forgotten anyway.
---
And none of that will make a difference when there's hundreds of people around you tagging kills and such. If anything something like a Druid with Moonfire might even do better due to mob tagging. :p Surprised Hunter isn't faster though, saying that 1-10 is a pain which is half the levels of this info.
---
I remember Alterac summons to grow bigger each kill they did
---
And they weren't staying mid, they were advancing slowly to the ennemy base
---
Maybe i'm wrong...
---
I was in 10th grade and grounded for poor grades (yay high school!).  Could only play 2 hours on weekdays but near unlimited time on weekends.  It took me just over a month, but our server (Dalaran-US) was offline for a few days in the beginning.  My /played was just under 8 days when I dinged 60 on my human pally.
---
We may do Lock / Priest.  Maybe Lock / Paladin for cheap mounts.
---
&gt;With Vanilla they hit a secret formula that just works.
---
Just curious, what would you personally think that "formula" or even part of it was. 
---
Good call!
---
hopefully no russians or chinese on the eu servers. cancels out 99 percent of the cancer
---
pfui, its clean af
---
I just played a race and class I don't care about on a private server. Keeping my true desire for classic but having fun ATM.
---
Might be, english is not my first language so Im totally open to the fact that I might have misunderstood something.
---
I thought he meant that Blizzard would stop to provide servers for Classic WoW.
---
or US isn't a bunch of sweaty neck beards and have jobs to go to. 
---
Like 28 days on a holy priest. I was 16 in 2005.
---
19 days played in a very short time. High school. Back then it was eat, sleep and WoW. 
---
Those were the days.. 
---
No way. Not that i'm against betas I've just already commited my life to this game again so every month i have free now is crucial before it takes over completely..
---
I'm in a similar situation to you. Hospital employee, work rotating days, and on top of that won't be willing to raid in the evenings/weekends in order to spend time with the non-gaming S/O. So the bulk of my play time is 1-2 days a week on weekdays 7am-4pm.
---
Most advice I've seen on this subreddit seems to be "play pugs, form a guild, hope for likeminded people, be an alternate in a raiding guild," which may work out for some, especially if they play in the evenings at peak times. This doesn't really work for me, however, because the evening is full of distractions and I won't be using voice comms when the S/O is home. I've put a lot of thought into it, and my plan at the moment is to sacrifice the luxury of good ping and play on a EU server. This would put my play time at the server's peak times, and allow me to join a raiding guild who's raid nights are not on weekends. I expect to be waitlisted a bit due to my inability to make it to set raid days every week, but I believe there will be a LOT of guild rosters in need of alternates/pug fills, so when I have a day to play and it's not my guild's raid night, I'll also be able to be a free-agent in other guild's pug-fills or run BG pre-mades.
---
In an ideal world, I'd find a guild on a US server who raid during daytime business hours, but it seems our (and especially my) situation is pretty exceedingly rare, and I've pretty much given up on that dream. If anyone reading is interested in joining up with the brits, though, feel free to PM me! Maybe we could get a small group of "ex-pats" together on the same EU server!
---
A shit fire mage will far outdps a good enhancement shaman.
---
I don't understand people's obsession with meme specs.
---
Fine in 5 mans and, although it maybe not be for any level of skill, it worked for me in ZG as well. And I'm sure some crazy hardcore tryharder have successfully made a paladin tank in AQ and Naxx for the fun.
---
&gt;When people talk about specs, it's obviously from an "everything else being equal" standpoint.
---
Adding to that: This is the standpoint people will assume when judging an unknown person, because, unless they have a reputation, there's no knowing how good they are. 
---
In fact, as we can see in this very thread, many people will assume that off-specs will be less likely to perform exceptionally, as they take your spec choice as a signal for your willingness to perform. 
---
In the end, it's simply a balancing issue and that won't go away by appealing to the community. Some people won't care, but many will do and that's just natural. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60GseT2aGQg
---
Yeah but that isn't what anyone is talking about. He can play a bad spec because he personally brings value in other ways. It isn't because ret is actually playable. 
---
People play Alliance ;)
---
I would 100000% like to play a limited beta, one to test the starting zones!
---
Yeah, that's right I mixed the numbers up. Thanks =)
---
I have seen boomkin perform pretty well in BWL atleast. Being up there with plenty other dps.
---
However, if you read my post that is not my point. My point is that there is no great need to pay attention to things like this unless you are striving to be on of the best guilds on your server.
---
Lets say it takes the average player 10days+ over the course of a month to get 60. The first timers/newcomers, *much* more. 
---
I could be inside DM before the end of the first week, while most of the server is in their 30's. Could farm my full pre-BiS and enough gold to influence the economy. I stand to benefit greatly, but still think it's a terrible idea. 
---
I love the fact that they're giving us classic but why would vanilla fans be more important that BC fans? 
---
Just give us classic and classic BC at the same time, nobody is asking Blizz to progress to BC and leave vanilla. People are asking for both versions at the same time.
---
Well that's my gut laugh of the day secured. Thank you!
---

Kungen was talking about the NAXX world first competition on his stream before , according to his side of the story the man himself single handedly out played Death and Taxes by alt whisper mind game and some world buff cucking.
---
AQ content patch, 1.09
---
True that. This is a pretty active server, so there were always people around but not in the "OMG NEW LAUNCH" massive crush you get on launch days. 
---
I played a BC server pretty recently and it felt like an extended version of Classic. The game was still grindy and the classes were still unique. Attunements to raids were absolutely awful, but assuming Blizzard BC would start on patch 2.4.3 then those attunements wouldn't be in the game anyway.
---
Downsides? You need to specialize to function properly. You could heal MC as an Elemental Shaman in greens and blues just fine, but you're not healing Karazhan as a fresh 70 unless you actually spec for it. In addition, it also felt just like retail in one aspect: it's all about the endgame. Leveling from 1-70 on a BC server is a chore, not a reward like it is in Classic. The changes to Classic zones + dungeons that happened during BC (patch 2.3 I think) significantly diminish the ability to experience Classic content.
---
In my opinion, BC would only really appeal to people who already have a 60 on the Classic server and want to progress to the next stage. For that reason, I think I would prefer to see additional level 60 content in Classic - released after Naxx - rather than future expansions. Level 60 Karazhan would be a great starting point. Easily my favorite raid in the game.
---
What is there to interpret? Am I lost?
---
Horde vs. Alliance is extremely dependent upon the overall server society and faction balance. There are great people on both sides... and there are assholes on both sides.
---
That said, for the Horde!
---
Isn't what anyone is talking about? Last I checked it was I that made this post. If you have not encountered what I am refering to, that is great, but it still exists.
---
Yeah, and that is exactly what I am arguing for. The skill aspect of this game, as in what you bring to the table as a player counts aswell. And people shouldn't just ban certain speccs before actually checking what the player brings to the table.
---
Wasn't there something you needed for Anatehema/Benediction? 
---
First off, I respect your ability to concentrate that well while dumping.  
---
I'm one of those people who wants to give Blizzard the "benefit of the doubt."  I stopped playing shortly after Cata, because I saw enough and didn't like directionally where things were headed.  What I forget, is there's another group that stuck with it, because they wanted to believe things would get better, but have been beaten at every turn.  
---
While I'd label that group "masochistic," they've been thru more and I think have proven why some do not want to give Blizzard that benefit of the doubt.  After reading your post, I think I get that now.  
---
Maybe, once Classic launches, they'll prove you wrong.  Maybe they'll prove you right.  Time will tell.  But I see your position more clearly now than I did before - thanks.
---
Well that depends on his leveling route, doesn't it?
---
Say if someone has their own leveling route where they spend levels 30-40 and 45-50 grinding humanoids and demons then they might not have any meat, but instead have lots of cloth to sustain first aid.
---
This is all very dependent on context and without the OP getting specific we're left guessing as to why OP feels like they can't efficiently level cooking.
---
Suffice it to say that I do think leveling cooking is possible, but I'm not the OP and I don't know his leveling route do I.
---
if there is a beta and i can play it. i would test all the things and write bugreports!
---
Absolutely. You need to roster more than 40 people to raid in Vanilla, so people will be in and out. Just don‚Äôt go in with the expectation that you‚Äôll be able to raid every time you‚Äôre free.
---
Esfand is probably the most narrow exception you could possibly mention. If that's what you're trying to build your point around consider me unimpressed. 
---
And yet here they are, doing exactly that.
---
Not clicking the video 
---
Farm retail for hours on end per token or work half an hour of overtime? Hmmmmmm.
---
Work is probably more enjoyable than retail right now anyway.
---
But what if you don't give a shit about progression raiding? What if there's more to WoW than that?
---
If you're pugging it's like this. A full guild run will be social. 
---
He called you the N word but there‚Äôs no way he could tell your race. 
---
Eye of Shadow is usually farmed in southern blasted lands iirc.
---
Ret's simply wont get invited to most parties. Most Pserver people were more polite than retail. 
---
that's such a dumb answer. The only way u could argue with the current sharding is that they should do "Early game dynamic respawn instead" he is talking about DYNAMIC RESPAWN in the whole server. Sharding is limited to starting zones only. It's 2 completely diffrent things :p
---
Well now I'm curious. What was the original link?
---
You can trust the community if you make yourself a part of it and engage with it though.
---
If anything you care about is under threat then put yourself infront of it.
---
100% yes. Down the line I'd like to experience a classic TBC server and a classic WotLK server. As much as I am excited for the classic vanilla experience, WoW for me is all about the progression. Once we reach the end of vanilla content, I'd like to be excited for WoW's next chapter again.
---
I'm not building my point around Esfand, he was an example I brought to the table.
---
I have seen guilds clear Naxx with boomkins in the raid, there are plenty of examples. The resistance against this was even bigger than I imagined.
---
I made a post a week or 2 ago regarding paladin leveling. Based on what I had heard people were saying 8 hours was a very good time to shoot for. 
---
Turned out 8 hours is insainly fast and it took my paladin ~16 hours of my first go. I leveled 2 more paladins. I got my time down to 11 hours to 20. I'm pretty happy with that. 
---
There isn‚Äôt one. Good luck!
---
Not it isn't. It's horribly false. The underlying argument is Blizzard implemented all of these changes against the wishes of the players. The vast majority of players wanted the vast majority of the outlined changes. The whole premise makes no sense.
---
&gt;Now, after all of these things (not even everything) that people have screamed and pleaded not be implemented/changed and still were, I hope you can see why people are so distrustfull of Blizzard.
---
This quote is indicative of how terrible the OP is. He's pretending that no one wanted the conveniences and other changes Blizzard implemented. **They did**.
---
Maybe listening to the players wasn't actually the right decision all along.
---
Can't hear ya over the sound of this gigantic pile of sparkly trophies rattling around in our trunks m8 LUL.
---
Boar Meat &gt; Westfall Stew &gt; Wolf steaks?
---
Now do 20-60 for all classes. That‚Äôs the real data everyone wants. 
---
True enough, if we had perfect players. Even with the most simple rotation there will be plenty of players that wont maximise their dps by for example positioning and gear, making it fully possible that the boomkin with 3% crit for 4 mages can outshine a 5th fire mage.
---
In a perfect world no, in world of warcraft with real people playing perhaps yes, it all depends on the players.
---
I would have taken an active boomkin before a 5th fire mage if that druid has things such as close to perfect attendance compared to the 5th fire mage or brings comsumables to all raids compared to the 5th mage. The boomkin can also respecc healer and fill a healing spot, something that the 5th fire mage never can. Filling a healing spot is often enough needed as not everyone can have perfect attendance and the reruitment side for a guild is far from perfect, meaning there is plenty of examples for many guilds where a **role** was missing was missing.
---
It all depends on the players and the situation, and i think that it is what /u/Spectralwhale is arguing.
---
Quest mob? No.
---
Group up with 4 other brave adventurers and go slay some level 5-6 mobs until you get ahead of the curve and questing is possible to some extended!
---
I haven't played enough on them to really comment, but in this case I was specifically referencing the use of explicit racial slurs.  That kind of stuff will get someone reported in a hurry, and it'll culminate in a very justified ban.
---
At most I'll play the AH on retail to get some money.
---
But actually playing retail? No way.
---
I also have 6 tokens already saved up to use when classic launches :)
---
&gt; 1-10 is a pain which is half the levels of this info.
---
Eh, you can get to 10 in 2 hours pretty easily. Another 10, if you are slow, to 20 is much more than half.
---
I think most people that play private servers have been playing long enough to know the difference in what rules each server has. 
---
Fun tests, love seeing this stuff here.
---
My last Paladin 1-20 times on K3: 11:32 - Currently re-working my route for a bit more speed. Dunno if sub 10 is doable tho.

Oh no. If I wanted that I rather play Rogue, too much work, for not enough BAM.
---
^^^^
---
I think you missunderstand what i say, tbh i actually love private server high pop servers. The problem is that we can't devide the population. U/me might like high pop servers, but do u really wanna devide the game? It's not the only private server change their is btw, stuff like less gold for reseting talent etc is there too.
---
So should we make servers for private people? Servers for people that want real vanilla back, like u call it "hipsters" people who want a more retail like world of warcraft? 
---
If u say "they shouldn't make retail world of warcraft for classic like" then why should they listen to private guys more then retail guys? The people that ask for a way more retail like "classic wow" is way higher then people like you that want a more "private like classic wow" 
---
The problem is that people want diffrent things and we can't get all of it with all the things we like. Then they need to please to many diffrent crowds and this is why they say they try go for it as close to "classic" as possible.
---
Hope it makes sense, just wanna explain why it is very unlikely they will do what u ask.

Wait so you are trying to work online specifically to play WoW Classic more? Bold move Cotton
---
I care a lot about most of that stuff but I've hopped aboard the hype train it's a balance of both.
---
The combination of achieving not easy goals (attunements, gear, farming), community is a huge one, raid difficulty with coordinating 40 people.  Having most end game content centralized in BRM early on leading to rivalries in guild vs guild pvp with similar raid times.  Having Barren's raided and orgrimmar 60's come to mop up the Alliance scum.  
---
The weirdest thing about meme specs in PvE...they're not even good in pvp. Boomkin pve is very different than boomkin pvp and is trash. Shadow pve is an utterly miserable spec that has to give up on amazing pvp talents like silence. Better to playing a spec like frost mage or sm/ruin lock who has great carryover if you really hate respelling that much.
---
I don't want people to be mislead into believing they're going to have no problem playing a bad spec just because they're "skilled" enough. The reality is vanilla is much more about time and effort than it is skill. 
---
There are ways to get spots with bad specs but the people who can do that already know that and it's still going to breed resentment amongst members who realize you're making the group worse because you insist on casting lightning bolt instead of fireball. 
---
Make your own guild and you can do whatever you want. Join someone else's and you better be ready to provide a lot of other value in exchange for your differently colored spell. 
---
Hello!  I've played WoW since Vanilla and can't wait to get back.  I've played all expansions, HC raided in most, but like others I've become bored with the current release and all the repetition.  With classic on the way, I'm ready to fill my bags with ammo and hit it.
---
So, I'm looking for a guild.  Actually, my wife and I are.  I raid, she's a casual and my leveling partner.
---
Intended Region - NA
---
Intended Server - Normal or PVP
---
Intended Faction - Horde or Alliance, have played both sides.  Main will be Hunter.
---
Intended Raid/Play Times - I'm west coast based, so Pacific Time servers would be best.  Would look at any other server where raid times are after 7PM PST.
---
Priority - Raiding and Questing.  
---
Pertinent Rules - Laid back people.  More adult oriented.  Good guild culture.
---
Contact - Here or Jair#11921
---
I haven't played since last year, but PM me and I'll send you my main armory link.
---
It's gonna be a Classic summer!
---
That's what the PvP progression system is for. Doesn't mean resilience needs to exist.
---
There‚Äôs one thing that is scary me about vanilla wow. It‚Äôs that Barrens quest where you need like 5 Zebra pelts or something and it takes 5 hours to get 5!! Lmao

I have not listened in a while Josh, but if the more laid back (toned down?) presentation is intentional I like it.
---
this +1
---
Thank you! You seem to be the only one that is getting my point.
---
The only thing I might consider worse was the addition of flying that resulted in less world PvP.
---
Why does Bronos Tree suck?
---
Don't forget that raptor meat one (I forget the name of it) you can also make some pretty good cash from that by making it and selling it to a vendor. 
---
Don't tell people the way you fool!
---
I love paladin as a class, i don't really mind that i have only 1 viable pve spec. but i cannot get over the fact that i have to wear a dress most of the time
---
Yeah that makes sense, but with the option to just play the content of each expansions instead of forcing people to migrate to the next one.
---
Looking back at my character's guild history I created my character around september '05 and hit 60 in july '06. So a good 9-10 months. I remember doing a lot of trivial and stupid stuff, like exploring and trying to reach places that were out of reach. And helping friends through Deadmines when I was almost lvl 50. 
---
My played time was probably close to 30 days, playing almost every single day.
---
It was, you eventually pushed with the summons all the way to the enemy base
---
You wont need that mana for heals if you spent it on murder
---
You are very lucky, because it is 2019.  You can literally search "Wow Vanilla how to tank {enter boss name here}"
---
You will be able to review what you need to do as a tank for each boss fight instead of not knowing and worrying about being bad.
---
Also, feel free to say to groups "Hey guys this is my first tank so don't yell at me if I mess up".  Usually that will spur them to help you out.
---
Was this a better spot than southern winterspring?
---
and usually having to find a new tank for a group means end of group lol.
---
I love vanilla and I'm probably going to play about 5k hours over the next year and a half.
---
But I also liked TBC. It did have major flaws though. Would I love to see a rereleased TBC without the flying mounts? Yes, but it's unlikely that'll ever happen.
---
The OSRS model seems tempting, but Blizzard basically said they don't want to develop two separate MMOs.
---
So here we are, arguing about the future before we've even had the chance to start playing.
---
Meh, a large selling point for him is the druid can respec to heal. If he does that he doesn't have a problem getting a spot in the first place. 
---
It honestly just sounds like you worded this poorly for what you're trying to say. When people talk about skill with video games it doesn't usually extend to punctuality and guild management. 
---
With 40 man raids you can carry dead weight meme specs for sure but people should also realize who are the first to get cut. 
---
Just curious, what would you personally think that "formula" was? 
---
I think that the following are at least part of what made vanilla great...
---
* Long leveling process
---
 * the amount of time it took from level 1 to 60 was long, even with the bare minimum of 8 days played (which most people did not do when vanilla was live from my experience), that's quite a long time when you have limited play time. It allowed you to immerse yourself in the world, to have real adventures along the way. Not to say that adventures didn't happen in TBC or later expansions (although, I only played Vanilla, TBC and a little of Wrath), but from someone that played Vanilla, TBC and a little bit of Wrath I can say that 1, leveling wasn't anywhere near as long in TBC or Wrath and 2. the journey to the level cap in both those expansions didn't leave much room for adventures like vanilla did and if you did have them, they weren't as memorable as vanilla's were. 
---
* Unbeaten content
---
 * [The world feels bigger with unbeaten content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Falm0H7VEiQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m12s), and just skimming [the list](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8t6p7i/the_real_list_of_119_useu_guilds_that_cleared/) of guilds that cleared Naxx 40 vs the list of people that [cleared sunwell](https://www.wowprogress.com/boss/Kil%27jaeden) (assuming the list is correct), it would appear to me that there was less unbeaten content in TBC vs Vanilla. Sure, the reasons for that are infinitely more complex than just that, I know, but when I saw someone walking around in Naxx (or even AQ40 gear, and I was in an AQ40 guild) gear, it dropped my jaw in Vanilla, when I saw someone walking around in late tiered gear in TBC, it didn't have the same impact on me. That could just be me, I know, but something I felt needed a mention. 
---
* Vanilla forced more socialization than later expansions 
---
 * just my experience, the introduction of meeting stones and the people leaving/new people coming into the game as time went on (TBC did have a higher player count than Vanilla, and Wrath even more so) meant that things were less personable in TBC and beyond than they were in Vanilla. Add on that leveling wasn't anywhere near as time consuming (already mentioned, though) as Vanilla was, which mean you had less of a chance of running into people while leveling (and having "adventures with them) and you're just grinding to get to the end game so you can start playing it. 
---
Those are my big 3 reasons why Vanilla was so good, but there are othere factors 2. The fact that you didn't have to have an expensive PC to play, high speed internet was becoming more available to more people and it didn't have the same competition as it does today, all of those factors played into its success as well IMO. 
---
Ret is gonna get invited to groups for sure. He is gonna heal though :&gt;
---
I want to play ret. I want to swing a big sword and also be able to heal myself and my teammates. But NoOo ret is bad dps so I‚Äôll join the ranks of countless warriors and/or mages that will flood the classic servers. 
---
Honestly it‚Äôs kind of ironic that the same people who try to justify how Vanilla is better than Retail because of class homogenization are the ones who think everyone should play only ‚Äúviable raid specs‚Äù. 
---
I would argue that how much time and effort you put into a thing is based on skill, but yeah that might have gotten lost in translation. However, those things are things I include when I say "skill".
---
I'm trying to voice that people need to calm down a bit, and consider that the resentment that they feel is a bit silly and doesn't really matter that much.
---
I'm most likely rolling a holy priest or a mage, so I'm not in the category of those I defend. I just feel that the pendulum has swung too far, and the position the community has on speccs is a bit silly. 
---
You know Baldurs Gate? This was an attempt to revive the genre and it was a success. They got 4 million on Kickstarter from fans.
---
You can't be any more DND old school RPG than that.
---
Pillars of Eternity 2, even got over 4 million on Kickstarter.
---
It was a new record for crowed-funding a video game, which was shortly after broken by Star Citizen, which might never get released at this point.
---
If you can SAVE your whole company, with an old school Baldurs Gate type of game, I think that is absolutely impressive.
---
I don't underestimate WoWs cultural impact that it once had. I will be the last person who cries, if it revives the MMORPG genre. 
---
But I deeply believe, after Projects like Pillars of Eternity and Path of Exile. That the next and best MMORPG will be made by people who are old school DEVs, who were there at the beginning, who are passionate gamers and the gaming community funding this project with kickstarter.
---
Oh yeah no big deal, that's only roughly a thousand hours.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
(Specifically: "How much is it going to cost to play?")
---
I know no one, including myself, that has been complaining about Wow up until a few months into WotLK. Plus I think your way of describing things is false.
---
More people called for the changes that we (Classic players) hate than people that complained about it. Blizzard didn't do this because they felt like it. It may not be a good move in the long run, of course, or so I believe, but it does not change the fact that Blizzard targeted all those changes you are talking about towards what people motly asked on the forums, and what was the trend in MMO in general.
---
"But dude, the number of subs began to go down at one point somewhere during WotLK".
---
Yes. But has it only to do with the fact that the game got worse? No one will ever know. It could be because other reasons. Demographics. Other games becoming popular (Mobas), etc. Not everyone is a hardcore diehard player to the point of playing something for years and even longer, just because the game is good. It may be hard to imagine but that's a possibility (and although I hate everything post WotLK, I know I partly have that mentality as well).
---
We are a vocal minority here on this sub. It would be very pretentious and self-centrist to think otherwise. We have to deal with the fact that the majority of players called for what wow is today. And some of them might regret it as well. And we did well so far since Classic is coming back.
---
Lastly, let's stop to try our best to trash Blizzard and shut down every potential new player's hope about Classic. Let's give it a chance until release. The more we will be playing, the better. Simple as that.
---
No raid, no gear, no fun. 
---
Woosh
---
Roast Raptor - sold in Grom Gol, STV. Between that and Turtle Soup, you don't need to buy food until you need the cheese for the Artisan Cooking quest.
---
Yeah. With literally every example cited, the majority of players were ok with said changes.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I personally preferred hard heroics in Cata. As a prot pally they were awesome. Until they gave WoG a cooldown I could aoe tank packs that other tanks needed CC for. You had to know boss mechanics cold, or you‚Äôd wipe. They were fun and challenging. But I completely understood why they nerfed them. Most people had bad experiences in them with pugs. As a tank I could teach people what to do, and then lead the run to success. But I understand that not everyone that tanks, puts the effort in to learn the trash and boss mechanics, and those runs would go very poorly. 
---
I have an example for almost everything on that list, where I agree that I didn‚Äôt want many of those changes. But as someone that was playing through all of these periods it‚Äôs silly to pretend that the overall playerbase was against this stuff. Outside of *maybe* the WoD but even that was written in a comically dramatic manner. 
---
Sharding.
---
Being the best group pvp healer in the game isn't enough?
---
i know what erp and goldshire is and it is exhausting that i have to explain to you that your joke wasn't really that interesting or funny
---
Id prefer them give the classic team the option of expanding upon classic without raising the level cap. So add Kara to classic along with hyjal. Maybe explore more of the things that got canned because of BC making sure they stay classic-esque.
---
I dunno, I played throughout Vanilla without raiding beyond MC, Ony, and ZG/AQ20 PuGs. Had a pretty good time.
---
I always wanted Lordaeron to be open when playing instead of just having Undercity. 
---
Crusader recipe dropped in WPL iirc
---
Ty. Holy shit, I didn't even know that the "Living" patterns are made by Elemental Leatherworking.
---
Hm. That is odd.
---
Even WoD people wanted player housing. They'd been asking for it since Vanilla. Now no one liked how it was implemented, I'll grant you that, but the idea of Garrisons was actually highly anticipated going into the expansion.
---
Meh? He understood what I meant, and you didn't. That says more about you than me.
---
The more you write, you seem more and more like the epitome of the elitist attitude I was trying to address.
---
If I would find raiding guild in classic, then nope, I will continue to raid in classic. Otherwise I don't think that there will be interesting things left for me in classic by this time, so I'll definitely try TBC.
---
I heard that some people will mob tag lvl 6-9 mobs outside the starter zone, but that requires you to know enough people to do that effectively. But as of now (if nothing has changed that we don't know of) we will have temporary sharding in the starter zones, so it will obviously still take 4+ hours to reach level 6 but it won't take days.
---
Took me 19 days played to reach lvl 60 on my Paladin.
---
Shouldn't they be a bit bitter though if they put in the time to level a class that excels at what they want to do, specs appropriately, farms consumables for hours, and people show up who don't even have enough respect for the group to spec appropriately? 
---
I think spec fantasy has gone too far with retail and when people look at vanilla they don't realize you're a class and not a spec. Have respect for the group and do what's best for the group. Or find a casual group who doesn't care. 
---
Ya know, it's one thing to say "I don't like his videos"
---
It's another thing to just label a subjective piece of media or a content creators subjective media as objectively 'bad' and then provide no details or reasoning as to why you came to that conclusion.
---
It honestly just makes you look childish and jealous.
---
I plan on 'saving' the Fiery Blaze enchant (skipping the quest) on my Druid until TBC (assuming TBC even gets released) because in TBC Fiery Blaze actually worked with claw attacks and it didn't in vanilla.
---
There's no use in getting the Fiery Blaze enchant on a classic Druid anyway since there's no way to use the enchant except hitting stuff while in caster form.
---
The reason why you save the Fiery Blaze enchant is because unlike Swipe, Fiery Blaze is not capped by unit count and there are some trash packs in TBC where you need the extra AoE threat.
---
GO SM/Ruin and pvp with that. 
---
Calling BS on most of the other comment's times, I think you people are underestimating the time you spent. Maybe it's just the hardcore nature of this subreddit but the times listed here are very short. To hit 60 in 30 days, lets say 10 days /played, you'd have to play 8 hours a day every day for a month. 10 days /played is a quick leveling experience for people leveling their first character, so most people would be quite a bit slower than that. I remember hitting 60 in vanilla with 15 days /played and I was on the faster side of my large guild. Most people were around 18-20 days /played.
---
This is just incorrect. Considering you have 30% the ENTIRE FIGHT and stomp is on CD, orc is by far the superior race. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love Tauren too, but orc is the master race of vanilla wow. 
---
Alliance vs horde experience (as someone else mentioned) is going to depend a lot on the server and what kind of content you‚Äôre aiming to do.
---
Aside from the social aspect of each faction, alliance tends to be a bit ‚Äúeasier‚Äù to raid as - primarily due to paladin buff which reduces threat (allowing dps to push higher numbers, the reducing th√© kill times on bosses/reducing mana needed etc.) and how fear ward will negate entire aspects of certain fights (ex: nefarian fears). Horde tends to be a bit more rng reliant (windfury procs, etc.) That‚Äôs not to say alliance is significantly easier to raid as, but it may affect your decision :)
---
Have you considered if one person in an entire thread throws you a bone with caveats built in your point might actually be total fucking garbage? 
---
This is what sharding is supposed to fix.
---
The whole point of the classic wow project is to recreate legacy world of warcraft. Thus, recreating 'classic wow' involves progression. The Frankenstein version of vanilla wow people are suggesting never existed. To have it exist in perpetuity would not be faithful to the 'classic' experience, the product they are intending to sell. 
---
How long 'classic' lasted is up for debate, but you better believe that blizzard will think it longer than many here.
---
As it turns out, its a really good way to keep any melee in check.  Especially rogues. 
---
Paladins that get their BoF eaten by a felhunter and slapped with a CoEx might as well just suicide as he gets eaten away by dots.
---
I'm thinking of hedging my bets on a TBC release.
---
Go pally, heal until TBC...C.  Then finally enter my final form... protadin.
---
I disagree, when expansions are announced, there is a brief surge in the playerbase. (this is anecdotal experience, I am happy to be proven otherwise). People want to level a new potential main, farm gold for XYZ, take a break from progression. Announcing TBC would probably breathe fresh air into a possible stagnating server.
---
Agreed. The implementation wasn‚Äôt perfect but people wanted it and it was really fun for a few months. 
---
A friend and I are leveling priest/warrior combo.  Likely to do dungeon quests along the way, luckily we just need to pick up any 3 others for DPS.
---
&gt; should you sue a 2h or 1h as enhancement? 
---
You can use both and whatever is the best you have at the time. Staves are often great early on. In dungeons and for pvp and most quests you will use a 2h but if you have a good 1h it will work great with 1h+shield and you can grind with totems.
---
Not worth my time now, won't be worth my time in the future. As the Goblins say, "time is money, friend."
---
Ive been set on shaman for a while, however feeling deep temptations for feral druid &amp; warlock.   
---
Shaman is awesome for utility and heals, also super needed in raids as resto for totems. Was gonna duo-level him with my warrior buddy. Also signed up on guild as R shaman already.
---
But for my solo I am considering priest, warlock or feral druid.   
---
Only might play feral druid if my guild will let me OT and DPS on some fights when not needed for tank, this would take place of resto shaman.  
---
As for priest v warlock, I've always mained priest throughout WoW career and it feels like I am cheating by maining any other class. This or warlock would be my solo character and mostly be for fun. I could get my healing fun out of a shaman and enjoy DPS as a warlock while my buddy is busy.   
---
Tldr: IDK basically shaman as main with my buddy as duo-level. Need a good class for my solo play, druid, priest (usual main), or warlock.
---
Shouldn't they be bitter? If you want a bad experience, than sure. If not, of course not.
---
I am one of those who puts in hours on hours in this game often helping out the guild, and bringing the extra to the raid. I have never been bitter because someone is playing for example a boomkin instead of a mage. Aslong as we kill the bosses, that is all that matters. Slackers that play the right "specc" and because of this alone think they are great is way worse.
---
Hate to say it but one of you should roll tank or healer. Chances are when you go to group for things they will only take one dps. If one of you rolls either tank or healer, you can form your own groups or get invited together for others.
---
Made the mistake of trio leveling with triple dps. Don‚Äôt do it. Lol 
---
&gt;The vast majority of players wanted the vast majority of the outlined changes.
---
How do you figure? The issue is that the players who are fine with how things are just keep playing the game in silence, while a bunch of idiots keep whining on the forums to make everything easier, more streamlined, more accessible over and over. And what do Blizzard do? They keep listening to the vocal minority.
---
Heck yeah! Get stoked. The endless wandering. Finding a sick BOE world drop. Shit talking with strangers in the barrens. I can't wait!
---
When he is the only one that UNDERSTANDS what I'm trying to get across here, instead of just getting insta triggered, that is certainly not the case.
---
I've mained a paladin healer since Cataclysm. In Classic, how do healers complete quests and stuff when not raiding? Having to respec all the time seems very annoying. I played a warlock in vanilla so never really had this problem.
---
Awesome, that is good info I wasnt aware of. I have heard the name Star Citizen before but I havent played it.
---
I agree about the old school passionate people being the ones to make the next big thing - hopefully they will be funded in such a way that allows them the creative license to do what they need to do rather than what is purely profitable.
---
How is Pillars of Eternity doing now? Do they have a healthy population or is it still in development?
---
All of this discussion actually reminds me of one of the MMOs I played, with the promise of being hte wow-killer... WildStar. Several original wow developers were in on the project, but the parent company failed hard by letting bugs go unfixed for too long and other death blow choices like that. The combat system was pretty cool though and I loved arenas until the bugs got out of hand and the game became meaningless without a nuke + start over option which they wouldnt do.
---
Did you ever play Wildstar? Are you worried something similar may happen to the projects you mentioned or do they seem to be doing well and handled by the right people?
---
that firey blaze quest has like.....the worst drop rate ever
---
&gt;But I completely understood why they nerfed them. Most people had bad experiences in them with pugs.
---
I think this is the issue though. Everything in the game seem to be tuned so you can pug it with randoms so every socially inept moron can do anything in the game.
---
If you dont want to socialize and make friends in an MMO to attain your goals, maybe an MMO is not for you. This is something players dont really seem to grasp, and you can see it repeatedly with the dumb fucking "I pay for the game, I have a right to see the content" argument.
---
The premise here is that people were actively begging Blizzard not to make the outlined changes. That is flatly false. People absolutely asked for changes.
---
I can't presume to know what the silent gamer wanted, and nor can you.
---
&gt; Downsides? You need to specialize to function properly.
---
I feel a big part of this was from the lengthening of the talent trees. They're 10 talents deeper but you're only given 10 new talents to work with. All of these 10 talents are probably going to go into your primary tree and none of them are going in your secondary tree. With TBC a Mage that is primarily Fire and secondarily Arcane will get better at Fire but not at Arcane.
---
So in Vanilla the difference between a specialized healer and an off-healer can be only 11 talent points. In TBC it's nearly double at 21 and in WotLK it's nearly triple at 31. Of course you need to specialize when the specializations are so far ahead!
---
I'm betting that the whole voice com issues are going to be a thing of the past. Now that we have discord to use instead of working with Vent or Teamspeak, each guild can have a dedicated discord server with premade voice channels for whatever groups you need. A few clicks and then your gtg!
---
I always see people complain about it ... the 2 times I did the quest, I got them with the first mob (elite).
---
Same with the bag quest in wetlands ... although most people dont know, that the red ones have way better drop chance than the black ones.
---
I can't speak for the others, but I ended up in my server's top guild solely because I leveled so fast.  It allowed me to be part of the realm first Onyxia and Ragnaros kills when I otherwise would have had no idea what those things were.  But WoW wasn't my first MMO, as I had already played Lineage 1, AC1, and AC2 for years prior to WoW.  So my leveling experience was a TON of grinding since that was what I was accustomed to from the other games and being grounded meant I would build up decent rested XP on weekdays before playing 16 hour stretches every Saturday and Sunday.   Maybe because I wasn't so lost in the world I leveled faster than most, I don't know.
---
I already know that my main will be a Warrior, where I'm undecided is on my first alt.  Between Hunter/Mage/Lock for ease of leveling and farming capabilities.  I don't really have any big PvE or PvP ambitions on those 3 classes, they would be mainly just for the fun of leveling and farming gold at 60.
---
The pvp on the Isle was some of my favorite times in TBC
---
yeah ive done the slime quest in wetlands enough to know its bad but not that bad
---
i must have spent 4-5 hours on the firey blaze quest before giving up
---
basing this on private servers though so who knows how fucked up their spawn rates are/were
---
Any chance you can post the screenshots you all were talking about if you have them? I'm only about 35 minutes into the episode, but it's great so far!
---
You can use the enchantment on other peoples items via trade window or put them on BoE items as it doesnt bind it to you. Can either sell it or use it for alts aswell.
---
As for TBC ... I dont think its worth it tbh. The effect is really low in tbc and for the part about tanking more then 3 mobs ... thats what pallys are for in tbc
---
Hahahaha I like that :)
---
"Over in the [Classic Update thread 22](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-update/113138/100), this caused us to do some investigation:
---
&gt;I believe it is still incorrect to say that warlock pets despawned immediately upon a new summon beginning to be cast. The Debuff ‚ÄúSummoning Disorientation‚Äù is supposed to take effect on the existing demon for the duration of the summon cast. If the cast is interrupted or stopped. The original demon is supposed to become unstunned and available for continued use. There are no patch notes showing this was ever added or changed, documented or undocumented. Kaivax please check and see if the debuff ‚ÄúSummoning Disorientation‚Äù existed in the old codes. If so, then that is the reason for the discrepancy between what players remember, and what the old code says. The missing piece if you will.
---
I can tell you ‚Äì it was fairly straightforward to find the answer to this one.
---
Summoning Disorientation is spell ID 32752, and that alone tells us almost exactly when the spell was first built. New spells are added sequentially.
---
This spell was built for version 2.0.1 of World of Warcraft. Also, we can look at our original version 1.12 and see if it it was there. It was not to be found in 1.12.
---
I‚Äôve noticed that my memories of the game sometimes don‚Äôt line up with reality, and it‚Äôs quite valuable for us to have the original data and code from that time period to reference.
---
Thank you for pointing us in the right direction."
---
For those who don't want to click the link. 
---
It's more
---
If Acti Blizz does good, the spark of old fans will be here.
---
If Acti Blizz does the usual, it's going to be a salt fest.
---
I will enjoy both but I'd rather also have a good game as well so I'm leaning towards the first option.
---
Bad specs do attract bad players (period) 
---
Good players are well aware that they would be much more useful if they play something else.
---
You are whether very naive or have no idea how far behind these specs are, and how much effort is required for them to at least try to catch up. 
---
Exceptions do exist, but these are exceptions and you are trying to make a rule out of them.  If you manage to find a ret paladin who minmaxes all consumables, comes flasked every time, uses engineering DPS items - then it's good for you, there probably will be a 2 or 3 people on the server with serious commitment (And they will be known within the community), but 95% of them will be outDPSed by the tanks.
---
Is your brain too smol to handle the idea of something hypothetical happening in 2 years?
---
druid moonfire spam... tab / moonfire / tab / moonfire :)
---
This reminds me of the first time I got my friend to play WoW in vanilla. He made a troll mage and once he learned he could conjure food he started freaking out. He would send everyone we knew stacks and stacks of conjured food through mail, it was the funniest thing ever.
---
That Classic isnt like vanilla, pservers were better blah blah blah
---
I agree. But the majority of the playerbase wanted dungeon content to be trivial. They didn‚Äôt even want to have to organize guild groups for it. 
---
This is one of the downsides of the subscription spike that happened during WotLK. Wrath content was stupid easy. Minus a few hardmodes some sections of the ICC dungeons. Players that joined during Wrath expected Cata heroics to be stupidly simple as well. 
---
The point isn‚Äôt if that was a good or bad decision. My point is that the OP is pretending the majority of people didn‚Äôt want that. He‚Äôs also pretending that a majority of the people that philosophically opposed that decision, thought blizzard made a bad call by nerfing them. Which, based on forum feedback, and every player I knew then, just isn‚Äôt the case. 
---
I think they will be fine for Classic, the thing you need to worry about is respawn times when it's going to be crowded.
---
I farmed in Winterspring. Always seemed like the best place for that.
---
Well we don‚Äôt really know the proc rate of ironfoe. Proc rates aren‚Äôt accurate on private servers. We have to wait and see.
---
Glorious.
---
So the warlock and priest took you less time than others. 
---
Did you buy wands on AH?
---
Let's not pretend that "person who shows up better than person who doesn't" is some super deep point you're making. Everyone gets it. Everyone agrees, even. But people are still going to shoot for people who show up and meaningfully contribute. 
---
I also find it funny that you're back tracking at the point you're making and pretending people don't understand you. You were attempting to justify a moonkin with game play reasons, such as the aura, and now you're clinging to things outside the game. 
---
Once again, that isn't what people think of when you mention skill. It's implied you're talking about you know, playing the game better. People need to realize that you aren't going to out skill a one button rotation. It isn't going to happen. 
---
So yes, if you can find ways outside of playing to provide value you will probably be able to find a spot. If that was really a point worthy of this entire fucking thread then he we are and praise the Lord we have it now. 
---
I don't really care about arguing about this anymore. We've pretty much been in agreement most of the time yet you're being a weirdo and getting hostile. 
---
You can get to 10 in 2 hours on private servers that don't have the same XP gains and mob spawning as Classic servers.
---
No one will reach level 10 in 2 hours of play. Especially at launch. 
---
Well, there's a few things you can do still because you can always optimize, as usual. Especially on cats like feral. But it's true that most of it will come from preparation and time investment. If you want skilled game play you have to orient yourself to the pvp side of things. 
---
What you could do is start a character of one race and run across the world to another starting zone. I'm thinking like running an undead character all the way to Mulgore or something. Basically just level using delivery quests and exploration exp while killing as many mobs as possible along the way. It might not be the most efficient in terms of EXP/hr, but you'll have a fun run across the world and gather a ton of flight paths that will come in handy later.
---
If you were really feeling it, you could also make the run as long as possible. Like run from undercity all the way to booty bay, take the boat to ratchet, run to org, and then to mulgore.
---
I'd give up something before I played a game I didn't enjoy, just to be able to play the game I do. If you're barely making it with a paycheck, find a side hustle like tutoring a youngin', or helping out some older folks with gardening or picking up groceries, anything like that. Or cut something out, like Netflix/Spotify sub. Or Google cheap dinners and make something like grilled cheese+tomato soup twice a week. It's not insurmountable, you can do it!
---
Rekt.
---
Might be that way, might not, the phases aren't finalized so who knows.
---
&gt;I can't presume to know what the silent gamer wanted, and nor can you.
---
Anyone with a brain can understand that players that are happy and content with the game wont go to the forum to ask for the kind of changes changes that has ruined the game over the years.
---
I like to think of us as a ‚Äúsubreddit in waiting‚Äù.
---
We will eventually be like every other game subreddit but our game hasn‚Äôt come out yet.
---
One unique thing about us is our game has already come out, just not officially. It‚Äôs the same thing as OSRS, so I guess it‚Äôs not as unique as I like to believe.
---
true, i forgot about dps warriors. 
---
Still doesn't change the fact that you're excluding a lot of specs/classes in an IDEAL raid setup. If you min-max as ret pally or enhancement you can do decent DPS, you'll never top the meters but you'll be decent. I'm just sick of people saying you can't play ret or enhancement because their dps is trash compared to equivalent skilled/geared warrior dps or warlock. 
---
My guild did MC on a Pserver about a year ago where we were only 25 ppl (guild was starting to die off), everyone was mostly geared with MC gear and a few pieces from the first 2 bosses of BWL. We got through with only a small amount of hassle. In a 40 man setup you can easily get away with 5 - 7 "off-meta" or unusual specs, even if everyone is "only" pre-BiS geared. But i guess you're not gonna read and just dismiss everything i say because of 1 error.
---
Play whatever you want! Just don‚Äôt be mad when you‚Äôre denied from groups/raids. 
---
Hunter was very strong in pvp, has a very complex rotation though
---
This feels great that they're not budging on something like this. Justice! Thank you Kaivax.
---
Depends what you want?  Are you looking for a different role? A different gear type (i.e. leather instead of cloth).  melee vs ranged?  someone who has complimenting tradeskills -- because that can really be anyway class..
---
Idk man playing a tbc server right now:
---
* Higher pvp skill? Yeah because abusing OP comps in arena is skill
---
* More varied ways to make money? From what I see it's A) Farm primals, B) Exploit professions. Vanilla has a ton of variation on how to farm gold. 
---
* Specific professions for specific classes became mandatory. Playing a caster? Tailoring. Play a melee? Blacksmithing, etc.  Having to go tailoring for a small period of time in vanilla as a caster, and engineering being overpowered is a small thing compared to the abuse that is tbc professions.
---
* TBC quests were focused on one story instead of a world like vanilla is.
---
* Less grinding? Sitting here needing over 10k gold to get my prebis btw so I can raid.
---
* Heroics are great and all but the reputation and badge grinds I don't like. I pref loot being random like vanilla instead of something you know when you get like "oh in 4 days i get my CE exalted ring from doing daily heroics".  40man raids were epic and there was more than 1 player of each spec compared to tbc where you have literally 1 of each dps class/spec and then a fuckton of hunter's and warlocks. That's not fun and it's even worse balanced than vanilla IMO. 
---
With friends, mostly.
---
If providing actual information is dunking can he dunk on us with some info people actually give a shit about? People being wrong about pets has been harped on plenty at this point. 
---
Considering it was added at the start of tbc it's also hard to fault people for being a few months off on 15 year old memories. 
---
Viable but you only bring 1 of your spec unless if you are a hunter or warlock though. I pref vanilla where you bring multiple of every viable class. 
---
A friend suggested Warlock, though I'd never played one in retail. So I tried and she's amazing as I level through! The question is, I believe in Classic you have to hunt for soul shards, them not being renewable? Would I be able to enjoy PVE and get them, or would I need the help of a raiding group?
---
Because you sit and kill the non elites dragons like an idiot for 1-2% chance to get the Heart. The big elite dragons have 30% drop rate on the quest item.
---
I agree but I still want TBC over anything else.
---
People just dont look up quests on any database before doing then. The Heart has 30% drop chance from the elite dragons and just 1-2% from the small non elites.
---
This whole demon summoning thing is making me wonder how many more things that differ from private servers will be found when Classic is out, and how many more people will claim Blizzard are in the wrong.
---
I just took it down because it was bad.
---
Lots of salt. I hope any CMs and devs who browse here understand that salty people will be left while we're busy playing the game.
---
Hopefully accurate information wont keep getting downvoted repeatedly by people whose main argument is "I remember from 13 years ago"
---
Mostly agree, however rogues will cry about warriors needing leather pieces but thats how it is, thats vanilla wow's itemization fault not the players IMO.
---
&gt; but there always going to be some1 saying that he'll leave the guild if ret get's [x] item
---
Is that really the kind of person you want in your raid? :S 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI4i1b0N3dk&amp;feature=share
---
This video just got posted, so you will have to swallow your own statement here. Here is one specc that is deemed "unworthy" by the community that by no means is that far behind as you are claiming.
---
However, that was not my point. My point was that that a player that sucks isn't great just because he has the "right" specc. And a player that is good doesn't automaticly become bad just because he has the "wrong" specc.
---
I just took the video down because it was bad I guess. 
---
Log in before everyone else, get out of the starting zone as soon as possible, kill any mob you see, you've just gotta be fast and efficient, once you start to pull ahead of everyone there's no stopping you really, those first few minutes are really important, forget keybinds or settings, just kill shit and move, don't sit around waiting for quests unless you can kill things while u wait
---
I expect a \_lot\_ of nitpicking about all kinds of values and mechanics being accurate or not. 
---
Other than that, a lot of:"I told you so" posts. Regardless of whether a purported issue will be an issue or not, one side will tell the other how wrong they were, I'm sure of it. 
---
Not sure what else. Probably a bit more focus on practical things like guides. Maybe a sticky with BiS sets/leveling guides etc? We'll see. 
---
Sharding is gonna make it nice and smooth :)
---
Level 10-60 WSG: Druids.
---
You're missing the point. Of course its going to be slower when classic servers launch. 
---
The guy said 1-10 is half of the leveling proccess in getting to 20. I'm pointing out that yes, mathmatically, 10 is half of 20, but obviously 1-10 is only a fraction of the time it takes in a full 1-20 gaming session. 
---
Also the specific sentence I was addressing: 
---
&gt; Surprised Hunter isn't faster though, saying that 1-10 is a pain which is half the levels of this info.
---
He's referring to the hunter time that was completed ON A PRIVATE SERVER and saying hes surprised it wasn't faster. Your comment on how long it's going to take on launch is irreverent to that context. 
---
Of course
---
TBH if he pulls it off then its a pretty sweet deal. 
---
I love how you post this trying to paint that guy negatively because he's a ret paladin while offering absolutely no context surrounding this.
---
How do we know you were not just a monumental douchebag all run?
---
Sharding sucks. 
---
Loot trading sucks.
---
Right click reports‚Äô automated responses suck.
---
It will be usual. Because these things do suck.
---
Has sharding been confirmed?
---
Looking for a guild to get organized before classic that meets my following requirements, would love to chat on discord preferably so leave links below to discord if you have any suggestions.
---
NA - pvp server
---
Semi-hardcore (20-30 hours weekly)
---
Need a PST evening raiding guild (7.30+pm pst) on any of the following days. Saturday, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.
---
Ideally prefer Monday+Thursday. Willing to play a variety of classes or specs to fulfill rosters. I have many years experience on vanilla wow with rogue, hunter, Druid, lock, paladin.
---
Assuming I can book Holliday‚Äôs off work I‚Äôll be attempting 1-60 in the first week.
---
Thanks all look forward to hearing suggestions/chatting.
---
It's fun watching private server hero's getting dunked on. Why do they think they know better than Blizzard when Blizz is literally using the original 1.12 data and code? 
---
It being added in BC also fits in with how most people say Vanilla private servers are actually based on a BC base.
---
Yes absolutely.
---
Damn, does it take much customization to make it look like that?
---
That‚Äôs why they will have sharding...
---
You won‚Äôt see many people cuz of sharding.
---
Will be sharding so you get all mobs for yerself
---
To you maybe. You speak for yourself only.
---
Ah right. That makes sense. 
---
Likely, but guilds will have people dedicated to wand making immediately.  My guild has 2 enchanters working with 2 leatherworkers for early DEing and wand making.  Myself and most of the others will be funneling unwanted greens to them, my priest needs that wand!
---
&gt;Ret's simply wont get invited to most parties.
---
That's a mistake to be honest. The hybrid classes if played by semi competent players are way better for 5man dungeons than pure DPS. Utility and extra buffs are a lot more valuable than straight up DPS. Having a retpala for freedom, bop, blessings, wipe protection and a 6 second stun while also having the ability to assist with healing is infinitely better for the group than inviting some warrior that can only deal DPS.
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs very important to not get emotionally invested in the argument.  Present facts as best as you possibly can and be ready to be proven wrong.  It‚Äôs not a failing to misremember or be wrong, but it is a failing to continue touting misinformation after being proven wrong.
---
They‚Äôre really pushing it with this demon thing. I guess it‚Äôs the only thing they have going for Classic so why not make the most of it. 
---
Look, you can do whatever you need to in order to fit the narrative in your head. But the reality is not only were most of the changes the classic community decries asked for by the community, many were also warmly received at the time of introduction. LFG is a great example. People asked for it, and it was warmly received. It was only down the line when people saw the long term impact of it that they decided it had been a bad idea all along.
---
Once again, the entire premise that everyone was actively asking Blizzard not to make changes and Blizzard did it anyway against player wishes is **false**. Just stop with that narrative, it's flatly incorrect. We just now recognize they weren't the best choices in hindsight and that's perfectly okay.
---
uhhh yea I know what hybrid tax means. Hybrid tax only truly existed in vanilla which means you suffered in roles because of your versatility. In TBC this was scrapped, with ret paladins and enhance shamans dps being absolutely insane in pve and pvp. I played a paladin and ret paladin was just busted, why would I play warr or rogue when I can play a class that does better melee dps along with healing/blessings and invuln. Druids, I mainly felt, were very poorly designed/balanced in PvP. Their was a reason why Druids were number 1 in arenas with all 3 specs. In vanilla you REALLY had to utilize every single little thing a druid had to offer in pvp. In TBC druids did great damage backed by the versatility which made them insanely strong.
---
Which reminds me another thing I hated about TBC were the unkillable healers. I played a priest in vanilla and one person knowing how to play could take me down, 2 people were only a matter of time before I went down, if I didn't get help. Mainly Resto druids but also Disc priest were unkillable in TBC. Which was incredibly poor balance and design imo.
---
Hopefully a mess instead of sharded. Because if they use sharding for the launch who says they won't use sharding in Silithus for the AQ event?
---
oh you meant as in farming money in dm, i see, that makes sense.
---
Beats me. Its just a Hunter that are salty about being kicked out of a group, most likely after behaving like a monumental asshole all run. Since he refuse to post any context, we cant really know.
---
Shockadin for life!

16 days on my human lock. I was 23.
---
No, but given the last year of Blizzard turning into Activision, I need to see classic before I make a judgement of adding expansions. 
---
&gt; it's also hard to fault people for being a few months off on 15 year old memories
---
I think it's more directed to those saying that pservers are a more accurate representation of vanilla than Classic (yes those people exist unfortunately).
---
Very very long. I leveled a Druid and put talent points randomly in all 3 specs. I remember I had the most points in balance but leveled in cat form. I probably hit 60 after 6 months and god knows how many days played because I played a lot back then. 
---
Seems like you could already be having fun with retail
---
you sure about that? the pserver i play on is on that patch and they are not ingame yet, and that server is usually very correct on progressive itemization.
---
yep I could 1shot full tier 3 Paladins with 1handed Reck bombs lol
---
Considering how garbage and unblizzlike current 1.12 servers are, it's unlikely classic will be worse than that. 
---
&gt; If providing actual information is dunking can he dunk on us with some info people actually give a shit about?
---
Clearly people do give a shit about it, since they keep talking about it on the forums prompting his response.
---
Your post is just senselessly negative. They'll give us more information when they're ready to. Getting pissy every time the make a post that isn't the information you personally want to hear isn't going to change that, just provide you with anguish.
---
Everyone agrees? Everyone understands? From what I can tell it clearly doesn't seem that way.
---
Am I back tracking? Where? I said that the boomkin aura can be useful, I didn't say they were just as good as mages. That was my statement about that, what you read into that is your won fault.
---
Fair point, I could have made that clearer. Not one single class have a one button rotation, not even the frost mage. When and how you choose to use your cds is highly relevant for your dps output.
---
Fair enough, there is no point in continuing this. I was trying to address something that I think is a negative thing within this community. From what I have seen you write I haven't seen anything that remotely resembles agreement, but it's good to hear eitherway. And last, sorry if I came across hostile. Have a good day =)
---
I don't play private servers and I've been against all of those features since BC came out. Stupid mongrel.
---
If you're talking about "current popular vanilla server which just got to aq" then i can also tell you there is a lot of fuckery going on there with its item/content progression.
---
 Just looking for a bud or two to level in classic with. If you are a guild recruiting I'm also up for joining that. I will be leveling a priest.
---
* NA
---
* PvP
---
* Horde
---
* Weekends for sure and afterwork hours, 5pm-10-12pm PST
---
* Social experience, raiding.
---
* PM me, or add me on bnet, antisocial#11514
---
There was this trinket I had on my warrior which would heal you when you blocked an attack. For its level, it was pretty garbage. However, it was useful for pulling entire low level instances and healing yourself back to full when needed. 
---
I remember using it to farm cloth and boe items for my tailor/enchanter alt. 
---
Yeah, me too! Hence the consternation here.
---
This is only because you asked, I'm not advocating for these changes.
---
They should not have added tokens to raids with... was it AQ? But after they did, the WotLK badge system was only consequent. No tokens at all should have been added ever, but if you add them to raids, please add them everywhere.
---
I have no problem with flying in Cataclysm, the old world was dead at that point anyway. I think WoW should have full flying from the start or completely remove flying. This "work for it and you might be able to fly later" doesn't work for me. I don't want flying in Classic! But if you give me flying I want to be able to fly everywhere, always from that point on. Be consistent!
---
Heroics in Cataclysm were
---
a) to hard for LFD. If you make hard heroics (yes please!) don't add LFD for that. Force us to build groups manually. And don't allow cross server groups.
---
b) unrewarding and had boring loot. I still remember half the loot I was after in vanilla but can't name a single item of a Cataclysm heroic.
---
Transmogging is, in my opinion, the single best feature WoW introduced and I would love to have it in Classic. You still have to get the items to be able to use their skin. No one who hasn't cleared Naxx can wear the full T3 transmog, but you no longer have to only wear some pieces of a set, mixed in with something pink or whatever.
---
I haven't played BfA but the GCD thing sounds fine to me. I don't want WoW to be about mashing buttons as fast as possible. Back in the day you had to throttle your dps to always have energy to interrupt or something like that. Todays focus on always be casting is bad (but enforced by tight enrage timers). There was the 5 second rule which healers used.
---
I think we should not have guild banks in Classic, which this sub favors. Guild banks lead to people creating bank guilds which I hate with a passion. The "wrong way" to play a game should never be more rewarding.
---
The game should not have any kind of "teleporting you to content". BG should not have the teleport you to them. It's wrong with dungeons, and it's wrong with BGs. This was added in vanilla and will be in Classic, I would still prefer to not have it.
---
I would love if resto druids would get an OOC resurrection. This will be the reason why I won't play a resto druid again. I love dungeons but having to abort one because we can't ress someone and there's already respawn is no fun.
---
Naxx gear is way to powerful. There can't be anything after Naxx but a full reset. Yes, TBC resetting everything was a mistake but it was the only option after Naxx. I would love if they rework raid loot and cap it somewhere at the level of BWL. Additionally, in my opinion, raid loot should not be more powerful in dungeons then dungeon loot. Raid loot should just have stats that help with raiding. Like fire and shadow resist on MC gear, which helped in BWL. I think it's a bad concept if you constantly obsolete content because you grow to powerful.
---
People are asking for new raid here, new raid there. In vanilla, raids were only an activity for a small group of players. I don't want them to add anything more raid related. The game should be about the world. If you add more things, make it everything but raids.
---
As I said, this is how I would design Classic. That's my perfect version. And a huge part on this sub would hate it. Therefore it's probably good that I'm not in charge. :) But I would hate the changes of the "raiders first" community equally.
---
It's a secret art
---
On the one hand I can't wait. On the other hand I don't know if I can make the same sacrifices that let me raid 13 years ago when I was a high school kid.
---
But damn I miss it. The exhiliration of defeating a boss for the first time, the rush when you got a new purple. Trash that wasn't just there to be annoying but was actually a defining part of the raid.
---
Not really honestly. TBC had a lot of things I didn't like.
---
The big world of Azeroth becomes largely irrelevant, Outland is a lot smaller, and only host the high lvl players, flying messes with world pvp.
---
And I've always hated the blood elf style and naruu's. Everything is slot brighter and I love vanilla's (mostly) darker style.
---
I totally understand that most people love it, but it really isn't for me.
---
"BUT PSERVERS ARE SUPER ACCURATE.Autism"
---
you know, as someone who always played an extremely aggressive rogue, I never considered that I might be straight up murdering a kids dad in front of him. 
---
50% of the players have never been PvE players. 
---
World PvP wasn't just ganking or Hillsbrad and it never died on my server or anyone elses. Even at the very end, massive world PvP occurred outside of the dark portal as everyone waited for BC to drop. World PvP died in BC in less than a year.
---
Probably can't get to 10 easily, but I remember a thread on here a while ago about people going over mailman quests to level 5. Just through exploring XP and "take this and talk to this guy in the next town" quests, people were apparently able to hit level 5 in the human, NE, and orc starting zones. I think they said it took them around an hour and a half, so about the same as normal leveling and probably a lot faster once you take competition into account (heavily dependent on sharding/dynamic spawns).
---
But if you can get to level 5, you can probably find a few mobs out in the corner of a zone where you can grind your way out.
---
&gt;This whole demon summoning thing is making me wonder how many more things that differ from private servers will be found when Classic is out
---
I've not gotten into debates w/ private server players from some time now because of the downvotes, but I'll see some things on here that make me roll my eyes so hard and say to myself, "you people are in for a rude awakening." 
---
I am interested to see how the bis lists and things of that nature hold up, I think they'll be a useful guild but, not gospel. 
---
I very much like this reply. ‚ÄúSubreddit in waiting‚Äù because that‚Äôs it, we are waiting. Wow reddit will be retail most likely, and this will turn into classic is what I see, and partially hope for.
---
The obvious answer that everyone seems to forget is exploration experience, you can easily get to level 5(and skip the starter zone, get ahead of the curve) in just over an hour. 
---
&gt;no way he could tell your race.
---
They're clearly a night elf. 
---
I‚Äôm curious to know when this was added to demon summoning, because I do remember it existing early on, but if not in Vanilla, *when?*
---
I'll admit it was my favorite thing about the expansion and the only reason I resubbed for like 2 months to play it.
---
Crusader enchant drops from the archmages there, that‚Äôs probably what they were farming. 
---
Not to my knowledge, but I don't see any alternative to dealing with the launch day chaos.
---
No one supports the existing PvP system so that's a shit point. Arena was boring because it dropped PvP down from 20+ people to (5v5 was dead) 6 maximum. In an MMO, large scale is always superior.
---
Yup, they do. 
---
The ONLY thing in Classic that requires skill is pvp, and everyone here immediately talks about Raiding. lol
---
very much yes. I loved blood elves beyond all other classes and starting zones. Cannot get enough. Would love a TBC expac
---
We've known how pets are supposed to work for months. Excuse me for wanting something new rather than condescending replies to idiots on the forums for the 6th time. 
---
Yeah, I'm curious how much, if any of the meta will change. I'm hopeful just so there's more of an equal footing among those who have played private servers for years vs those who haven't played Classic since 2007.
---
I used to farm gold there on my rogue. Can't think of anything spesific you could farm there. 
---
2.0.1, it says in the post linked.
---
Classic doesn't exist yet so that isn't even off the table. We'll have to see what happens. 
---
Not going to lie, the guy in OP's image seems like an edgy racist kid from the US.
---
Anyone who played or knew someone who played a warlock during Vanilla remembers how this worked. It's engraved in our brains, haha.
---
No reason for me to go into detail about why his videos are bad, it's already known. Jealous of what? I've never made any videos or have any desire to.
---
I agree with the new island addition. It would be cool if they could add the draeni/blood elves into the azeroth continent in vanilla to where it wouldn't add another map, but would still add new areas and races
---
As long as i can have both, i want to play classic forever, just like i still play diablo 2.
---
Winterspring was a little easier solo, but the Dreadlords &amp; Doom Guards in southern Blasted Lands also drop Grimoire of Doom for Warlocks. 
---
Go to the thread that's designed for this discussion. Literally on the top of the sub.   
---
Before this gets removed
---
This is at least the third time they mention it now, and even made a dedicated thread just for it. It was interesting the first time, now I'm kinda wondering why they can't spend all that time compiling something new to tell us instead. We'll take virtually anything at this point.
---
You're looking for WowModelViewer. You should be able to find the older version for the original animations.
---
Disney-fied models, wot? I think you need to look at how cartoonish the game was before the model updates...
---
Great. Appreciate the response. Any info on ele? 
---
This a hundred times. It's like they found something incorrect and feel the need to tell us over and over. Give me literally anything else, please. 
---
U have time, enjoy yourself and make a completly  new class/race then take the nostalgis trip later IMO
---
This is freaking superb if you ask me, this proves that they are going for as authentic as possible when not even the lock pet despawning question goes unhindered lol. Another reason for us to put more trust into the classic team.
---
I thought I've seen people post about a web based one recently, but I could try that out, does it work on mac?
---
\&gt; Hybrid tax only truly existed in vanilla which means you suffered in roles because of your versatility.
---
But the thing you seem to not get is there are two ways to make a hybrid tax. One is the vanilla one, which sucked. The whole idea about a hybrid tax is that they are worse at a single isolated role, but the important part is that *they make up for it* with extra toolkit from other roles. Vanilla did *not* do that last part. Oh, so balance druids can off heal and off tank or join the melee dps? None of it matters, it was not *useful*. On paper it works, but in reality they didn't actually get anything in return for the hybrid tax. The only place where their hybrid skills got any use is in duels or wPvP. For all other content they were simply worse.
---
\&gt;  In TBC this was scrapped, with ret paladins and enhance shamans dps being absolutely insane in pve and pvp.
---
You literally mentioned two of the aboslutely most useless PvP spec of all of TBC. Now you just make up facts yourself to prove your point.
---
\&gt; why would I play warr or rogue 
---
And here you mention two of the top PvP classes in TBC. I really think you either didn't play competitive PvP in TBC or can't remember much about it. And in case you think I'm just making all of this up to counter your points, go look at the internet. This is the general opinion on the matter.
---
\&gt; Their was a reason why Druids were number 1 in arenas with all 3 specs
---
They were not. Resto druids were probably the strongest class overall in arena, but that was due to Cyclone, too high mobility from Travel Form and the nature of HoT. For a long time Blizzard have struggled with the problems of resto druids because in PvE they need a strong enough healing output to be viable, but for PvP that means they can heal like other healers, but with more instants and more importantly, premature of the damage income. This is a big deal because even if the enemy CC you, HoTs keep your team alive. 
---
I do agree that druids were a tad too strong with feral due to cyclone + healing. Balance were not OP at all and only viable as restokin with a rogue. And that was exactly because it was a hybrid. A restokin didn't do nearly enough damage to justify being picked in arena, but the off-healing made it viable. Aka, hybrid tax, but also hybrid versatility.
---
\&gt; I played a priest in vanilla and one person knowing how to play could take me down
---
One person should *not* be able to take down a healer. Then what is the point of a PvP healer? If just *one* dps can kill him.
---
You're missing the point.
---
It's not the fact they made a mobile Diablo game. 
---
It's the fact they rumoured a Diablo title, which has its roots firmly in the PC crowd, showed up to Blizzcon of all places and debuted a half-baked mobile game which (as far as I can recall) isn't even being made by Blizzard.
---
They announced this to a room full of hard-core Diablo fans who had all paid money to be there. If they had announced anything to do with a PC title it would have helped, but all the hype of the past few years ending up being a mobile game and the devs actually had the gall to act surprised by the reaction.
---
If they had announced anything for the Diablo players that prefer playing Diablo on a PC (read 90% of them) then perhaps it wouldn't have been an unmitigated disaster.
---
Consumers being pissed off because a company is so hilariously out of touch isn't the consumer's fault.
---
'Don't you guys have phones?' is another incredibly out of touch statement right up there with "You think you do, but you don't".
---
The alternating caps are reserved only for the dumbest statements uttered and both of those qualify.
---
My feelings exactly! I think the loot trading can be an issue, but I am nowhere near as pessimistic as some people I've read. I believe that it can help in some cases, and if it proves to be something that causes issues that we unanimously agree on, that Blizzard will change it.
---
And for people that think Blizzard won't, recently in BFA they had a loot issue in reverse, where Azerite armor wasn't tradeable. People complained and they changed it. No reason why they can't the the opposite in classic if we all agree its terrible
---
I just really want them to announce a date so i can plan around it accordingly.
---
You don't have to go Full Holy to recognize that Illumination is absolutely bonkers, no matter your spec.
---
&gt;but i tell u, no pala og **druid tank** will ever take naxx 40 - no matter what the Community thinks
---
This is just flat out wrong. Bear Druids can tank all of Naxxramas just fine. 
---
Im pretty sure op is a dick aswell.
---
Heal was instant and had a cooldown. The rest of the time, your durable hero was swinging that massive hammer into enemy faces. 
---
Holy at 60 plays more like a wc3 priest with heal on autocast.
---
I mained a Holy Paladin in Vanilia. Progressed all the way too Naxx. I‚Äôm going to go for a Hunter this time since it‚Äôs something else and i just love how they where played back then.
---
Ya, the 10k+ population private players, with dynamic spawning, characters allowed on both sides and numerous "guessed" game mechanics, sure like to talk about the complete authenticity of their servers. And yet they claim "Bliz-like". lol
---
I played vanilla for 3 years, but the idiots spouting of their authenticity is getting rather annoying.
---
Silithis or BRM. 
---
STV was fun if you wanted to help stop or prevent ganking. 
---
Only really required for a handful of fights... But Very required for those fights, so yeah the point stands.
---
Good luck finding a guild that will take you and no you will get one shot doing something stupid like that. 
---
Absolutely, I prefer it over Vanilla.
---
I assume if you time it right you wont be melee'd by the boss when using a potion.  during the classic demo (since macros will be different), I was able to make a quick potion drinking one that worked no problem.
---
As for trinkets, etc.  If it triggers the GCD then no, you wont be able to swap right back and may get melee hit or otherwise by a boss.  Since it will put the GCD on your shapeshift back.  Anything that is off the GCD should be fine though. 
---
Let's not forget, having that dps hybrid as a sweeper when needed on certain fights (poisons, curses, bonus heals, cleanses) will make your raid composition more dynamic. On a certain private server, we even allow a ret paladin in our ranks for progression because:
---
1. He's a good player and has many gear sets to compensate, based on the fight
---
2. He's shown commitment and has stayed around since the near-beginning
---
For the above reasons, I'd rather take this guy over the flaky dps anyday so-as we have dependable folks showing up.
---
I'm strongly considering maining warlock over mage for this reason. SL/SL calls to me
---
except that they don't, because BoF.
---
It‚Äôs [Stormshroud Shoulders](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15058) (Bear Tank BiS) and [Living Shoulders](https://classicdb.ch/?item=15061) (Resto BiS) that are the items in question that can only be made through Elemental.
---
well us will stay out of eu since they have dedicated servers so i dont care.
---
And...your point is?
---
Here let me give you a good example of how your line of thinking doesn't seem to coalesce with reality.
---
&gt;Vanilla- Priests are generally holy.  Maybe 1 priest is a "pet" shadow spec for end-game geared locks to boost their dps in AQ/Naxx.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;TBC - Shadow priest is a viable PvE spec and is now used to boost both shadow damage BUT to also refill caster mana through mana manipulation talents/skills given to them. 
---
Also, raid volume composition percentages changed. The raid size in TBC was 25 man.  (with kara being entry-level 10 man)  Raid size in vanilla was largely 40 man, with 20 man catch up raids in between each tier.
---
1 Player in TBC = 4% of a raid. (10% in kara)
---
1 Player in Vanilla = 2.5% of a raid (5% in ZG or AQ20)
---
Specs, and just in general the people in raids had to be more skills because they contributed to the "total cause" of the raid more on an individual level.  Even if a raid was "only bringing 1 of your spec" as you put it, your spec was a greater contribution to the whole in TBC.  And the ability to say "*We can actually BRING a shadow priest and a few holy priests*" in TBC is worth far more then the ability to say "*Well, we can bring 4 hunters, but 2 of them are really only here for Tranq shot"* in vanilla.
---
I mained a rogue in vanilla and dont plan on doing it again. Was a pain to get groups as a casual player and can imagine it will only be worse the secone time around. 
---
Gonna go Warlock this time
---
&gt; The big elite dragons have 30% drop rate on the quest item.
---
30%?  back that up otherwise its just you pulling shit out of your ass.
---
According to both ClassicDB and Classic Wowhead the plans drop from a boss in AQ20 so that sounds right. Although I don't know where those websites get their data from.
---
It took me a long ass time to hit 60 on my main toon. I got the game on release and I remember being pretty fresh at level 60 when WSG came out. I believe that came out around June/July 2015.
---
I then rerolled a rogue shortly after hitting 60 on my 1st main, and leveled that to 60 in about a month. (Those awesome high school summers with 0 responsibilities outside of gaming)
---
Well, if you can be 100% sure that blowing up to 2 GCDs outside of Dire Bear form in melee with a Boss won't kill you, do it I guess?
---
Chances are that you will die instantly. I don't suggest it.
---
&gt; pfui
---
So not a Ret Pal in Natural Habitat, but just a typical pserver player regardless of class.
---
I was a Hunter that tried this. Your sides fault if they let me IMO, lol.
---
&gt; 2.0.1
---
This is the "pre-BC" patch which came in Vanilla, right before BC.
---
Same spot for me between pally and warrior. Can't decide between the two as I am worried that as a casual player I will just get wrecked at 60 without good gear as a warrior. 
---
Well I know this won‚Äôt go down well as a warrior but I‚Äôll be rolling need on high spirit gear because it‚Äôs most optimal for levelling as warrior. 
---
Can you please details others facts that private servers are using with BC data ? Is quests xp reward accurate for example ?   
---
Because if they use BC, doesn't it mean that leveling will be longer than private server ? 
---
If i remember well Blizzard always nerf previous extension required xp... so maybe they did it there too ?
---
We're supposed to rag on the Pal for being Ret, and for the apparent childish behavior the screenshot portrays. Don't think about how the SS does not show any context for the conflict, and how it's possible OP purposely goaded the Pal into quitting the group. OP is, after all, a NE Hunter and so cannot be trusted.
---
I hope Kara gets put in classic
---
I mained a Feral druid in Vanilla. 
---
Never again. 
---
I'm a bit torn between remaking that character as a Rogue this time to become the better cat, or go Horde with a Troll Priest or Mage. 
---
Yeah I agree with you. Our other set up was to be Warrior/Shaman for those sweet wind fury Procs.  But it started to not look appealing when my friend realized how popular warriors are and how gear dependent they are in the end game.
---
Warlocks and mages are like B-tier DPS for almost all of Vanilla. Hunters should out-dps them until AQ, warriors should be miles above them.
---
A lot of stuff will be found. There is so much guesswork in pservers that is taking on face value today, a lot of it will be wrong.
---
There are interviews and dev logs from pserver developers, who indicate that they just did not have any information about things like armour values, and had to hope that some information in strategy guides is still correct. Boss scripts were reverse engineered from 360p YouTube videos.
---
The server I played on claimed to be "blizz-like 1.12.1", but quest texts and experience/reputation awards are definitely from 2.0.1 or later ‚Äì easy to see since the latter were higher than what Thottbot indicates, and the former included localisations (like "Wegekreuz" instead of Crossroads in the German version) that weren't introduced until the TBC prepatch. Server devs still claimed everything including that was blizz-like 1.12.1. They were wrong, but many players will take that claim at face value.
---
I tried to stay in one of the early days AVs, I didn't make it to the end after almost 24h.
---
It's sad how modern MMOs are so shit that people call Raiding "PvE" and throw this limited use of the term around in old school mmorpgs.
---
It is the pre-patch for TBC, not the pre-TBC patch. Important difference. 2.0 is not considered to be part of vanilla (hence why it starts with a 2 instead of a 1).
---
Honestly as someone who played warlocks in private servers, I actually prefer the private server version of warlock pet resummoning.
---
Having your pet instantly despawn even if you miss click another summoning spell sounds like a nightmare to work around.
---
Wait, *who* is pusing it? The community asking about it or the CM responding?
---
I agree, although, I think having real life examples and pin pointing exactly how it sucks and how it sucked, will make Blizzard reverse them.
---
Especially the loot trading. I feel like they will launch with it, we will complain and point real signs of abuse and they will take it out. At least in dungeons.
---
Depending on your spec it might even be beneficial to Drain Soul on most monsters you kill. There is a talent that increases mana regen for a period of time after you kill a monster with Drain Soul. As far as soul shards are concerned any monster/player worth experience will give one (as long as you kill with drain soul) so they are pretty easy to farm.
---
The issue is having the bag space (they don't stack) and enough saved up for a raid... each summon takes 1 shard, health stones, etc, it adds up very quickly.
---
You should care about starter zone sharding, when you realize people are still dissapearing in westfall, this is blizzard after all.
---
You should care about when DM release, so other content doesn't become kindergarten-level easy.
---
You should care about loot trading, when I join your group with my friends and have them all roll need on the item you need, even though they dont need it just so it can increase my chance of winning it because they will just trade it to me.
---
Bnet friends is inevitable and doesnt really matter, so you are fine here.
---
You should care about what happens after Naxx. You want to be forced into TBC and lose classic, once again?
---
You should care about spell batching, because it was a major part of core vanilla mechanics, especially in PVP. If you don't know this, I dont know what else to tell you, other than I believe you never played vanilla.
---
You should care about world chat. When everyone has no need to visit different zones to chat, and simply sit at an innkeeper using world chat you will see a nice dead world like retail today.
---
You should care about server populations. The world was built for 2-4k players. Not 10k. More population actually means less community, like retail is today, because you will never see the same face twice.
---
*laughs in paladin* 
---
How would we know though? Without a time-machine, all we can say is that they differ.
---
Sure. we can investigate screen-shots and videos, but those are often undated. There have been a lot of screen-shots and videos posted with the intention to prove the warlock pet summoning thing, but it was almost impossible to see that they were from 2.0.1. Finding artefacts *exactly* from 1.12.1 will be rare.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room](https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#RRzV0zJ89cczcVz9m87MoUf87cVFV87VVzU808oLs808VzS808VzO808VzH87V) ?
---
Yeah Druid so is extremely slow from 1-20, but once you get cat form, the damage increase is absolutely nuts‚Äîit's gotta be somewhere in the range 200-300% more.
---
Yeah but if you're a Feral tank doing heroics you're not a Paladin tank are ya?
---
You will learn patience, that's for sure. Trying to grind for exp or money as a healer is pretty... uh... time consuming. I always had a dps alt to farm on considering respec costs alone would negate almost any profit.
---
so 2 and a half months after
---
Probably that one is from TBC - drops from Kargath Bladefist, https://db.excalibur.ws/?item=27529
---
If you can copy your Vanilla gold to TBC then there is a huge exploit wherein everyone in the guild gives you their gold before you transfer... then, on Vanilla, you give it all back (since the gold was copied, not transferred). This process is repeated for every guild member transfer.
---
Now, everyone has 40x more gold on the TBC server than they had on Vanilla.
---
&gt; you gonna kneel
---
Lots of time to do /kneel between your white hits :)
---
This is a prime example how people will find anything to bitch about even if the devs do a great job and do their honest best to bring us the best Classic WoW they can bring.
---
It also shows how easy it is to trick our 14 year old memories. The 2.0.1 behaviour just makes more sense than the vanilla one, so we can easily incorporate that.
---
I imagine that would be quite easy to detect
---
Thank you for recognizing my abilities!
---
I am hoping to be proven wrong, but the fact they havent said they are removing loot trading yet worries me greatly.
---
I don't think I could play a rogue as anything except undead for will of the forsaken. I found it infinitely useful in PvP situations to have a fear/poly break, that and cc+cannibalize.
---
Watch this be what they meant by ‚Äúmore coming soon‚Äù
---
Most People are retards, stop giving them attention. 
---
A lot of people swore that it was never that way. Some even produced screen-shots and videos. Those were from the TBC prepatch though.
---
True, like half the point of even raiding imo is to get phat loot so you can go in a bg and just wreak havoc
---
It'll likely turn into mostly an LFG thread thing and after a few months it'll be like r/wow with 80% of the posts being artwork.
---
That's because there's a relatively stable population of PS players that play in synch and finish everything they want to do in 2 years.
---
Classic servers are going to have a constant influx of new players trying it out.
---
I don't know what history that guy remembers but TBC had a bigger player base than classic. Lose 50% of players??? If classic does well there is no reason to think that TBC wouldn't do even better.
---
I really hope that you are joking by referring to this custom server post not even showing his full UI during the fight and boss debuffs.
---
I would like to know how he scores 1600 non-crit mind blasts in pre-bis gear, like really and how much it represents reality. A friend of mine played a spriest on a very famous and already dead pserver and rarely ever got crits like that in BWL-tier gear.
---
Let's do some napkin maths: 
---
517(average Mind blast damage) * 1.1 (warlock curse) * 1.15 (Shadow Weaving Stacks) * 1.15(shadowform) = 753 damage
---
1600-753 = 847 damage has to come through SPD, considering 42% coefficient it implies that this guy has to have **2016** SPD to be doing 1600 non crit Mind blasts in pre-bis gear or am I missing anything?
---
Yes, but brains of teenies are still under construction, so ...
---
EPL towers. On my server those actually worked for instigating WPVP. It was almost like a battleground around those things.
---
Dire Maul exterior. People tend to stream into DM one at a time as they arrive, and the brutes hit hard. It's easy to fear people into the elites so they take durability loss, then run into DME if you get into trouble. But the best is when you have a couple of mages with you and you catch a raid standing outside the DMN portal waiting to cycle in for tribute buffs. Most of those people are alt-tabbed or AFK  and stacked together in a small space, so 2-3 mages can wipe a raid's worth of people there. Even sweeter if you make some of them lose tribute buffs.
---
Last I'll mention is the Cuevo's Gold flag at the southern tip of Tanaris. You kill someone there and they have to run the full length of Tanaris to get bak to their corpse, and then you can kill them again. Viscious!
---
Ah, thank you. It has been a long day for me so I will put the blame on me being tired haha.
---
It‚Äôs on a newer everything compared to the old wow, there will be stuff they need to fix... thinking there won‚Äôt be is a little ignorant to be honest. They have not confirmed indefinite vanilla servers because there likely won‚Äôt be. Again as a business model to have something that is only for the short term doesn‚Äôt make sense. Investors will want growing revenue not a pet project. Also what expansion had the largest subscription numbers? It wasn‚Äôt classic it was wotlk which they will want to get back to. I understand you guys want it but releasing just classic with no expac progression will piss investors off and at the end of the day that‚Äôs what calls the shots. Not something most people will love until there is no more new content. Yes you will have a handful of people that will continue to play but they are looking for growth not stagnation.
---
I've always loved the Druid. Still my main to this day. Can always change spec and play a different way while still keeping the same character. With that being said, I'll either be a druid or hunter. At least one will be my alt.
---
I still have the [Cold-Forged Blade](https://www.wowhead.com/item=19110/cold-forged-blade) from the Horde Ice Lord on my old Main. Early on these Bosses dropped Items and you could loot them (if you were fast enough). I hope that makes it to Vanilla. 
---
What specific patch numbers you're talking about?
---
2.0.1 came at the very end of Vanilla, which was the pre-TBC patch, which was the TBC content patch, which is all not considered Vanilla.
---
I would love to play through the unnerfed Blood Elf starter zones and maybe play through level 60, but BC's leveling zones were awful. Basically, I'm torn.
---
I agree to a extent, but I think i am correct in this as you can just see how BfA started off. Insane amount of feedback that just went ignored or simply was told "though luck".
---
To give credit where credit is due, they added some vendors.
---
But then they also said that they are not going to put in a PvP vendor because they think it would be to hard to find said PvP vendor. (This is actually the reason btw)
---
That's fine and all but this is starting to feel like a scapegoat.
---
A super minority cared or even remarked on this.
---
Talk about sharding, loot trading, spell batching, and other fundamental differences that we *know* about. 
---
&gt; So eventually they're probably going to release Classic TBC
---
That's highly speculative. Creating a Classic TBC is going to take a year of development time and that costs money, which means Blizzard has to be confident that the *additional* revenue generated by a Classic TBC server will justify the expense.
---
You can't mail conjured items though.
---
I'm glad Blizzard has the original 1.12 code and supplant all of these private server reported "bugs."
---
The only buff that is at all obscure is the long-duration 87 FR buff you can get by having a priest mind control the orc casters in LBRS.
---
&gt;I think most of the design decisions for TBC was poor.
---
A few were REALLY poor, most were great if not perfect. 
---
&gt;They killed original capitals by grouping alliance and horde into one capital.
---
Not the first or last time the horde and alliance came together to fight something bigger than themselves. Not to mention Shat didn't have an AH and a couple other things if I remember correctly. 
---
&gt; You can fly over conflicts. No more conflicts means no MMO.
---
Even Blizzard came out and said if they could go back and remove flying they would. You are absolutely right that it kind of killed the world feel to the game. Although honestly, it kind of fit the layout of BC given the amount of areas that you just weren't allowed to go to until you got flying. Something like Azeroth that they made before flying was even thought up, yes flying feels especially cheap. 
---
&gt;I'd rather have content layered into the original continents or no expansion at all.
---
They tried this with Cata, I really don't think it went over all that well. 
---
&gt;the World dies as soon as each expansion adds a new island or a new area.
---
This is pretty much true of all content after a while. Like once a decent number of players hit 60, a lot of areas effectively "die", that is just the nature of the game. I think the main killer of the world was the LFD/LFR feature, which we haven't been without in a very long time. TBC had content out in Tanaris, Deadwind Pass, and probably a couple more places throughout Azeroth I am forgetting. 
---
TBC was probably the best point in WoW for a lot of people. Looking back at a game that was 12 years ago with 20/20 hindsight and criticizing it while posting in a sub with #nochange as their motto is kind of laughable. Vanilla was a pain in the ass and had a lot of things they would have changed for the better if they had the ability to, but the players cry that it wouldn't be true to their pain from when they were younger. Making the claim that Vanilla was the only good version of the game is just an outrage. Vanilla was exactly that, vanilla. 
---
Happens to all of us :)
---
Didn't TBC introduce flying mounts? Wasn't that a major contributor in the death of the social scene in WoW, second only to LFG/LFR?
---
&gt;Is quests xp reward accurate for example
---
The nost core was using TBC quest values for the longest time until it was fixed semi recently (last year I think) by another provider using their code. People are still fighting on dungeon/raid difficulties for different servers....
---
If they had TBC values that would mean leveling in vanilla content would be easier.
---
If I could trust Blizz I'd want them to slightly change most of the item stats just to mix up the BIS meta a bit, I think part of the 'vanilla experience' is the mystery of it all. That being said, I don't trust Blizz, so I hope pservers got enough wrong to still throw people for a loop lol.
---
The point is it wasn't as if they could only make one post, either new info or shut down that topic again. The two are totally unrelated. By letting yourself get angry because they aren't ready to give you more information yet the only thing you're doing is making yourself miserable.
---
Definitely. For Vanilla Shaman, everything after Nature's Swiftness in the Resto tree is basically trash. Mana Tide included. In BC, all of those trash talents get buffed and are actually worth taking + the 10 new talents you mentioned that are also really good. The only hybrid spec that can still play a hybrid role is Feral Druid because their talents have a tanking and a damage component.
---
Not everything is 100% perfectly balanced in Vanilla. But the overall game is better because of it.
---
Hi, /u/ak74907
---
&gt; There will still be new bugs they will have to patch and have to pay developers to solve that. 
---
These are things they won't need developers for:
---
1 - designing new raids
---
2 - writing new quests
---
3 - fixing class imbalances
---
All of those things are far more expensive that fixing bugs, which is an effort that diminishes over time.
---
My main was shaman in vanilla, Will probably roll another. Warlock is tempting though
---
Go on the forum and start trying to shit on blizzard then...They aren't pushing anything to us, they're just replying to users trying to poopoo blizzards efforts.
---
I'm already planning on maining a resto shaman, but I'd like a fun DPS alt for farming, running BGs, and some casual raiding.
---
I think I've narrowed it down to hunter and rogue (warlock was also in the running but I like affliction so the debuff limit is a problem). I already know that rogues aren't supposed to be very good in BGs but I prefer melee so I'm leaning towards that.
---
If I could get the opinions of anyone whose played either end-game that'd be great. Also have a few specific questions (mind that I'm rolling on a PvE server)...
---
1) I know hunters have decently complex rotations, but is leveling one easy to the point of being boring? Is their rotation still interesting in raids or is it neutered because of TS?
---
2) I'm not crazy about the idea of managing pets. Do you find you get used to it quickly or is it a pain?
---
3) Is the rogue DPS rotation really simple? What would it typically include?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
What's really going to be funny is if the pserver players decide that they prefer a pserver implementation over true #nochanges and decide not to pay Blizzard for Classic. A lot of people might find out that the #nochanges experience they envision and desire is actually shot through with a ton of tiny changes they don't want to lose.
---
You act like people were questing a ton at max level instead of grinding dailies... Flying to do dailies is fine, leveling is a completely different story. Also of all the expansions to criticize flying existing, BC isn't it. It served as a gating mechanism for being an established level 70. I'm not defending flying in Azeroth or the delayed flying shit they do now, but BC was designed with flying in mind. Every expansion after that they should have removed flying from the game and left it in BC. 
---
I remember walking to my friends house once and looking up at the leaves in the trees blowing and thinking ‚Äúdamn those are some good graphics‚Äù before remembering I was outside 
---
Agreed that‚Äôs one sticking point for me I‚Äôm gonna be so torn dedicating hours to fishing and cooking but in the end it‚Äôs totally worth the effort.  I want to win the stv fishing tourney again.  
---
Kinda happy, kinda sucks for finding out about classic just recently. Too late to really start preparing on a private Server, too early to start on blizzards Servers
---
tiny bit, its mostly straight out the box with stuff moved around
---
They keep updating this stuff because private server babies keep filing bug reports and insisting they are right. They are getting the point across that this is their game and your fake servers were wrong.
---
I recently learned I'm a beta too! Apparently it has a lot to do with who you vote for. Who woulda thought
---
It drops in both but the non-elites you can farm for it WPL are usually being farmed by someone else.
---
&gt; the the majority of people on this sub are BC or Wrath babies
---
dude, there are no BC babies. I don't think you understand the origin of that term. BC had some design changes that turned out to be mistakes, but it was very much a hardcore raiding expansion.
---
it really do be like that sometimes
---
Alternatively you could wait a few days and start then lol....
---
Btw I have never played classic so have no idea :-), thought in objecting the opposite view.
---
I was just thinking that I wish I had gotten around to having kids by now. Daddy needs farming minions while he's at work!
---
Not much will change. Four years ago when the hardcore blizzlike movement was really picking up steam with the Nostalrius and Kronos servers there were quite a few inaccuracies, but over time almost everything important has been meticulously researched and corrected. An immense amount of effort has gone into this and it's honestly insulting to the efforts of dozens of private server devs and thousands of dedicated testers that spent countless hours trawling old youtube and warcraftmovies footage (gold standard) or timestamped forum posts/comments for evidence to insist that private servers are significantly different from the real 1.12.1 vanilla experience.
---
I've played the same Paladin from Vanilla through BFA.
---
She'll continue to be my main in Classic.
---
Tyrs Hand for 1v1. BRM or any Emerald Dragon for group.
---
Fair enough, but I'm not really impressed. If they would address something more relevant from [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ubyr6/wow_classic_demo_feedback_bugs_and_legion/?st=jsxiot3p&amp;sh=a3a15946) (minus the obvious points) I'm sure that could change for me and many others. Not even yes or no, just acknowledging the issue like they did with sharding.  For example, Vanilla WoW movement mechanics would add a lot more authenticity to the game than a non despawning warlock pet. But I guess we all fear to know why they are nitpicking and dodging the big important questions.
---
Very nice, I‚Äôll have to look into it in the future. Thanks!
---
I don‚Äôt vote because I‚Äôm not a member of the electoral college and my votes don‚Äôt matter
---
I am pretty sure they didn't disappear when you started summoning but simply would not summon if you previously had one up already....aka kill the pet during the summoning, before the spell ends.
---
you totally missed my question
---
Actually you're just wrong here, the servers are right, these gloves weren't added until 1.10
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.10.0
---
2.0.1 was not Vanilla. It contained ALL of the TBC content in it. The first publicly playable version for TBC was 2.0.3, but everything 2.x is TBC.
---
I think you have misunderstood the post tbh.
---
You have to read it from the POV of the people who actually were against the changes.
---
He‚Äôs not saying everyone complained about these things, he‚Äôs bot even saying most players did.
---
What he‚Äôs saying is that some did and despite what they said Blizzard did their thing anyway, which from those players POV ruined the game. And that‚Äôs why these players don‚Äôt trust Blizzard.
---
The vast majority might have been for these changes, who knows (I certainly don‚Äôt at least) but this post doesnt even argue one way or the other regarding this point.
---
So you are suggesting that this person made this video and cheated?It's not like other pservers are the best source of information either.
---
You are still not addressing what I actually made a post about tho. Go make this statement on his post.
---
Yeah I see this all the time. "Oh you think this is cartoony now? Look at how it used to be"
---
And its just wrong, there is a entirely new art style that is meant to be similar on a surface level. A good example is the old stitches model and the new stitches model. 
---
WoWs old models was trying to create a realistic model using really old graphics. Now its play dough.
---
Thank you! This is exactly what I meant! I don‚Äôt know how I couldnt find it on the wowhead site... oh well. Thanks a bunch!
---
I answered your question. No you don't get to risk wiping the raid every pull to pop out of tank form for cool downs lmfao. 
---
Realistic model? Son, Ragnaros looked like he was built from legos. A lot of models did. It wasn't remotely realistic.

---
&gt;I will play and support Classic in hope of getting TBC servers later because it's a superior version of the game in my eyes than vanilla
---
I am 100% behind this as my reason for playing as well. I am excited to play Vanilla again and will love it. But I am really here and even picking my class to take it to TBC eventually. TBC was just the real nostalgia trip for me, as I only casually played Vanilla, but played the shit out of TBC. Both games are great but TBC was just superior in my view. 
---
They are all obscure to me. I don't remember what was in vanilla and what was added later.
---
Took me a few months because I leveled so much through pvp and dungeons.  Late into the 20‚Äôs levels I switched to this from primarily questing and I was hooked on pvp.  I was exalted with the Warsong outriders before I hit 60.
---
I was in my very early 20‚Äôs and just moved out of my parents to my own apartment.
---
Hunters can solo just about any mob in the open world if it's kiteable, whereas mages have a much harder time soloing elites but in exchange can aoe farm (which is kind of unique to mages).  Locks I am less experienced with but at 60 between lifetap, pets, and drains you can farm endlessly.
---
Not with Dire Maul out at release, no. Crown of the Ogre King is way easier to get, or Dreamweave Circlet. And none of those hats compare to the Turban for pre-raid BiS.
---
No one should waste money getting that hat.
---
Remember the runes in MC?
---
Yeah, because calling someone a n\*\*\*\*\* doesn't immediately reveal exactly what kind of person he is...
---
I am with you!
---
I am here to enjoy the game I loved once again, not nit pick it for everything it isn't.  
---
I hope to find many others as excited as myself to play with when the game hits, we're gonna party like it's 2004 :)
---
If you can only go from Vanilla to TBC I don't see how you could abuse gold tranfers. If you had a few thousand gold in vanilla you were pretty darn rich. But by level 70 you had several thousand. And daily quests made about 50g. By the end of TBC I had more than 30k. Vanilla gold is worth far more than TBC gold. Inflation was insane. 
---
Not going to sit and spend time finding proof of a droprate at some random quest. Just look it up yourself if you care.
---
haha, jesus man, I dont think I will fuck off, im ok here.
---
Context is... ret pally got ratty with the group from the start when he wasnt aware there was an escort quest to do and 4 of us needed it, he didnt want to waste his time, carried on acting like the racist little twit he clearly is, i called him out on his bollocks, he kicked me, 15 mins later kicked every one else before ras, this like 6 months ago, i found the ss clearing out my photos folder. 
---
He reminds me of you a little, you normally jump right out your socks to tell people to fuck off on the internet?
---
Obviously will have to be a fair few levels higher. Will do some testing this week to see if you can do it while main mobs/quests are still green. If you can't do that then there's probably not much point.
---
He is wasting 2 of the 16 rebuff slots on mind flay and shadow word pain. If those slots were used by debuffs such as crystal yield the overall raid dps would be higher in 40 mans. At this point it is better to go a healing spec with shadow weaving.
---
I mained a boomkin. I knew my spec, played it well, and had a blast. You just need to find the right guild/raid group/whatever that supports what you want to play. If you play your spec well, you can help defeat any mob/dungeon/raid. I did. 
---
One memory has stood out for me all of these years later. I was a boomkin in a group and the healer went oom. Mage grabbed an add and got the healer and MT killed. The other DPS soon followed. I brezzed the tank, healed him until he died. I kited the boss and eventually killed him. As a boomkin, in Vanilla. One of my proudest moments. 
---
WoW's a game. Play what you want. Have fun.
---
My main was priest and I'm pretty sure I go with it again in classic as I loved every aspect of it. Vanilla priest feels way better than retail priest to me.
---
&gt;Last I'll mention is the Cuevo's Gold flag at the southern tip of Tanaris. You kill someone there and they have to run the full length of Tanaris to get bak to their corpse, and then you can kill them again. Viscious!
---
Did you play an undead or gnomish rogue?
---
Yep. I don't have much to contribute to a beta besides network traffic. I played retail Vanilla, but unless there's some obscenely obvious bug (like my hunter can walk on lava unharmed), I just don't recall most of the details (like "Steady Shot should be [Ranged Attack Power * 0.1], not [RAP * 0.12]!")
---
"2.0.1 was not Vanilla" is misleading.  It came during Vanilla, before TBC was released, but it's not really Vanilla.  What point were you trying to make?
---
thats the question, do you really need 2 gcds to do all this?
---
on this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUc70zMFAKI) powershifting looks pretty quick, you almost cant see the shifting
---
so does using a pot or a  healthstone trigger the gcd?
---
If that's true then it seriously undermines the legitimacy of the "loss of trust". Did they expect that Blizzard would follow their minority opinion? What kind of entitlement does it take that your trust is broken because Blizzard didn't do exactly what you individually wanted?
---
I read it the only way it could logically be a reasonable point. 
---
Ah its you again, hi!
---
Imagine disagreeing with basic facts and demanding that everyone else find proof for you. You can easily look it up on a database site.
---
That‚Äôs the one! Not sure why I was thinking it was a vanilla trinket. 
---
Dude, that is seriously because pvp'ers would whine about OMG THEY LEVELED WITHOUT PVP THAT'S UNFAIR.
---
You know? One minute they are calling pve players casual unskilled carebears, and then the next minute they are terrified about them being able to transfer to pvp servers without restriction.
---
read my question AGAIN
---
[Here's my guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w_n2be6WJYnGxQUioBGd7JGYY7FtlU0ThwGcO8Mh69M/edit?usp=sharing) for humans and gnome / dwarves (so far) for level 1-10 doing pretty much exactly what you're asking. (Still a work in progress, i have some kill quests penciled in, but they're flagged as optional) - Last few tests have gotten to level 10 in about 3.5 hours or less.
---
- Only -1- kill / collect quest (about 1.25 hours in) since it opens up a massive exploration quest chain
---
- 4 elite kill quests (like Hogger) since they'll be easy to group for when loads of people are around
---
- almost all the rest are "talk to this guy" / "go here" quests.

People from private servers aren't aware how much of what they are used to is cherry-picked from 2.0.1.  I will smile if the no-change advocates start screeching because changes they liked from private servers are reverted.
---
I see this as less "dunking on" someone and more answering a question.
---
Someone asked the devs to check for them, and they did.
---
I will never forgot how one project gave dryads wrenches instead of spears. I dont know if it comes from the stock mango or if it was a mistake by these devs. Hilarious nonetheless.
---
I've read your question and the answer is no you don't risk wiping the raid to pop a fucking consumable, are you simple minded? 
---
You certainly can, just don't count on there always being a slot for you. Ret in raids is a utility class. 
---
I can't speak to raiding as a hunter, but while leveling one is easy, it's also  \*fun as hell\*, mostly because of how much they wreck everything. If you're looking for more of a challenge during leveling, I'd suggest another class.
---
Managing a pet is enjoyable after you get used to it. It creates some similar inventory issues that you'd experience with a Warlock's soulshards due to having to keep food/ammo in your bags, but I had always wound up feeling really connected to my hunter pets in a way that I never did post-classic when they were just...there.
---
I smell.... ret pallys....
---
I‚Äôm sure a lot of people would. I hit up a tbc fresh private server and just hit the outlands after playing a few years on vanilla servers. I must say, it did feel pretty cool to see the outlands again after all these years after finally grinding my way to lvl 58 at x1. I actually ended up quitting wow in tbc less than a year after it‚Äôs release and never got into all the new game mechanics that tbc brought like resilience, skills and gear so I feel very lost and having fun figuring out my way. 
---
I did have a deja vu moment during a quest where I remembered a time I was doing this quest over 10 years ago. Made me a bit weird inside. 
---
&gt;I hated that all of my Tier gear, that I spent countless hours raiding to get, was instantly obsoleted by level 61 quest greens.
---
Isn't this the case of any progression in the game at all? Like you could make the same complaint about Naxx being released. Oh man all my BWL and AQ gear just isn't top tier anymore? Aww man I need to play more of the game? Dang. This criticism honestly boils down to TBC isn't Vanilla so I hated it. 
---
&gt;I ran the dungeons way too many times and I never want to do any of them again
---
You haven't done them in 12 years and you still never want to do them ever again? I bet you are about to do Vanilla end game dungeons as much as you ever did a BC one. 
---
Also just because you didn't personally enjoy TBC doesn't mean a lot of people aren't only playing Classic in the hopes it goes to TBC. 
---
Arena was bad because it created the concept of comps which forced Blizzard's hand to start aggressively rebalancing class abilities so that every class could be part of a viable comp.
---
Arenas were a huge component in the eventual class homogenization of wow.
---
Just went to episode 93 instead of 94, nothing outrageous.
---
As a enh shaman with frost shock lvl 26 or something i went to duskwood raven hill cemetary with some low level friends to gank mid 20s. Best memory i till got from wow.
---
It can put out pretty consistent damage with moonfire, insect swarm, and entangling root. You end up doing a lot of kiting with cheetah form. One of the biggest strengths is that you just have so much mana. And if no one is in real danger you can just drop big starfires on people. It scales really well with gear compared to more feral based specs because spell power affects healing and damage. It might not be the beat flag carrying spec, but it does really well in wpvp and just general BG fights.
---
Maining mage once more. I loved it through TBC and I want to experience it in Classic for more than a few weeks I got to before. And a Warrior alt, because you can never be enough of a braveheart.
---
I too would prefer some common sense changes that were implemented in 2.0.1.  It will be fun to see the community come around to changes when they realize how much of private server 1.12 data is actually cherry-picked 2.0.1 data.
---
Yep I‚Äôve focused on being a bit more laid back with the show the past 10 eps :)
---
BC dungeons were a little more streamlined, but I can only think of a couple that I would say were just designed to be dungeons and not real places. 
---
I'll only list buffs/debuffs that boost stats, mana/health return, damage output, or reduce damage input
---
|Class|Buff|Debuff|
---
|:-|:-|:-|

|Warrior|Battle Shout (Group only)(+ AP)|Sunder Armor (reduces armor)|

I'm sure i've missed a few things, or gotten a few wrong, so feel free to jump in and correct me!
---
Also, very limited time spent playing a vanilla Shaman, so unsure of whats utilized in a raid environment other than Windfury totem.
---
Having played the game through the entirety of vanilla, none of this matters to me really.
---
Do I want sharding? no!  Will I let sharding in newbie zones at launch kill my good time?  Hell no!
---
Am I gonna let loot trading in 5 mans effect my game play?  fuck no!  I am glad they have it to resolve legitimate issues for the entire community, of which there will be many.
---
I've already beaten this game several times over, it's not hard and it never was, I am just over joyed I get the opportunity to enjoy it all over again.  It's been over a decade since I have played it, can't wait to see it all over again.
---
If turban is out on release c ya classic. Turban is like wayyyy at the end of progression and shouldn‚Äôt be out at launch. 
---
&gt;How do you think the discussion will change?
---
I think people talking about how things are in the game vs how we remember them will be topics that'll crop up the most. It's been 14+ years since some of us have played the game, and I for one can barely remember what I had for lunch yesterday, so I'm interested to see if things are the way I remember. 
---
PSever vs Classic will probably be another discussion, since those threads will probably get deleted/removed by the CM's quick, this'll be one of the "safer" places to have these discussions, but seeing how it's technically a violation of rule 4 it could go either way. 
---
Other than that, not really sure, I think that my focus may shift from this sub to the official blizzard forums but place will still be my most visited sub, like now. 
---
I think we will play HL3, before we play Star Citizen at this point.
---
Pillars of Eternity is a SP game and I think has a decent amount of fans. I hopefully find the time to play the Sequel eventually, since it has to do with Pirates, which sounds a lot of fun.
---
I never played Wildstar, but yeah Projects for MMORPGs fail all the time, most of the time, they are bug ridden or too specialized to attract a broad audience. I kind of gave up on MMORPGs for SP games like Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Witcher Series and so on.
---
I'm not sure if they have problems funding these games or what the real issue is, that Classic is still such a game that no one could ever match, not even Blizzard themselves ever had quite the success like they had in the early days.
---
Who knows. Maybe a company like CD-Project Red could do it. They seem to kind of understand what gamers want. I just feel the gaming industry is in a horrible state right now, that I wouldn't expect a quality MMORPG any time soon.
---
I think if anyone would do it, it's a passion project, which gets crowed funded. Just what I'm feeling right now.
---
If he really showed commitment to the guilds success then he would respec holy though..
---
I am not quite sure how it will work with the classic client though, its running on legoin or bfa architecture then reverse engineered to 1.12.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=15752
---
These are a problem, which I had originally planed on getting. But that screws up my plans now. Ah well.
---
Not sure why everyone is being so hindsight 20/20 on flying. Literally no one thought at the time it was ruining the game. You still had to fly to every single raid/dungeon, and you had to PvP if you wanted to use the summoning stone. Not to mention dailies were not done on your flying mount, and the island Sunwell was on had no flying. While it detracted from some content, it also opened up a lot of content that you could only participate in once you gained flying. 
---
Yeah me too
---
Wtf it took me like 7 months on a warrior my first main 
---
But it wasn't a part of classic...?
---
There is just hoping that an unfortunate guy, just randomly picks up Elemental LW. lmao
---
Hunters rely a lot on kiting against melee classes.  It can be hard if you haven't mastered it, but can feel absolutely OP once you have.  Hunters DEVOUR rogues in vanilla, it's not balanced at all (and I say that as someone who played hunter throughout vanilla).
---
I found in vanilla that against similarly geared/skilled warlocks and shadow priests, hunters were slightly outmatched.  Once they get dots on you and a fear off, your health will only go down for the rest of the fight, while they can heal themselves.  
---
Mages offer a lot of raw damage and control, but I have a hard time comparing the two.  I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure mages performed adequately against just about every class.
---
I personally found hunters to be really strong in alterac valley - you can stand in the middle of the zerg pack and outrange everyone, and rack up the hk's as you gun people down.
---
Yeah I really really wish Blizzard would have a clear conversation about itemization, because Turban is the poster child for how utterly fucked up item progression is with MC as the only raid and 1.10 dungeon itemization.
---
Paladins, you mean bubble hearth bitches?
---
#forthehorde
---
Not even giving Prot a button smfh
---
I'm not gonna argue against that, I posted it as a response to /u/Alice_commotion statement that 95% of these speccs will be outdpsed by tanks.
---
There is an extreme black/white attitude regarding this issue, that is what I am trying to address.
---
People forget what a toxic waste dump of complaining the Blizzard forums were back then, it was nothing but screaming about how the game was trash.
---
Every change made from vanilla to BC was something the community rallied for, after some months of classic being out I suspect we will have people seeing these flaws all over again.
---
I don't think we can call that thing obscure any more, everybody knows about it and its use is pretty much standard for Vael when just getting started in BWL. Frankly they should just remove the buff. It's not cute or clever and it replaces guild coordination and progression over weeks with a 10 minute buff time between attempts. The LBRS buff is terrible for the game.
---
Phew! Good thing we all just play warlocks!
---
Sigh.....
---
2.0.1 was done in VANILLA, But is not Vanilla. Its the quasi vanilla/BC period. This is how blizzard has handled literally every expansion since the first. For 2-3 weeks the game is running on the new version, without the content of it. For Vanilla's case, these few weeks were when honor changed to a currency, and lots of people Myself included were able to farm honor and get High Warlord gear without having the title. New talents were a thing in these 2-3 weeks. 
---
This pre-patch of 2.x also had the Dark Portal event, where Demons flowed out of it, if you were there back in the day you could get a tabard that makes you flex and have a "holy Nova" like effect come off you. There was a small quest chain if i recall as well that led to the tabard. PvP servers had huge battles over controlling the portal. It was awesome. 
---
These things happened "In Vanilla" In that BC was not possible to access yes, aka if you went through the portal, nothing happened. So while patch 2.x wasn't vanilla per se, there was overlap. And every expansion has had this brief overlap. 
---
You realize getting camped is only fun for 50% of the participants right? You are still denying that person access to whatever they were wanting to do by sticking around. 
---
I play a PvE server because I don't like being forced to log off because someone else is bored. That just isn't the fun part of the game for me. Even camping people was only fun the first couple times. I found it fun when people around your level would try and compete for quests, but as soon as the level 60's showed up I was ready to go back to actually playing the game again. 
---
I am not saying they are not there some where, but from 8p - 12p PST, I have yet to run into any in my conversations. I would say I have talked to ~100 or so ppl and I usually start by asking where they are from. 
---
My point was I dont think its "entirely" European.
---
Item stats shouldn‚Äôt be off much. The fights themselves at endgame... well that‚Äôs another story.
---
I played on Shattered Hand in vanilla on the Horde side. The server was unfortunately very Alliance heavy and they dominated the server for world PvP and bosses.
---
But even playing on the opposite faction there was still a sense of server pride to have top guilds on your server. That's why it's so important to have a server be a WORLD where you can learn names and make friends/enemies.
---
It was a high pop server that was fun to play on. There were problems with lag and queues during peak hours. They implemented free server transfers to help with the population and it killed the server. A lot of people left for the new one and it was never the same.
---
Private server fanboys on suicide watch
---
So the first thing I completely disagree with is transmogging, I hate transmogging with a **passion**. If I see someone looking menacingly/powerfull I want to know that they are what they portray, I don't want them to look powerfull and wear garbage.
---
It ruins immersion completely and while I get the "they have to earn it to mog it" argument, I still disagree with it as it nullifies the gear you are wearing. You should see someone and know at first sight, otherwise you are allways going to have to guess and its just cumbersome and boring. If you see someone coming at you in BiS in a BG you should know instantly that this will be hard. Not have to wait and see if you get destroyed in a single blow.
---
Flying breaks the world and immersion, WPvP is ruined and makes the world feel so much smaller and promotes the complete faster ideology and I agree that they should completely remove it, flight paths are good as they keep the big world feeling but also allow you to get glimpses of the world creating mystery.
---
Token gear I agree should never have been added and that if they are so adamant to keep it in the game they should also have it apply to everything.
---
Heroics weren't too hard for LFD imo. IMO if it had never been nerfed and been made the new standard, the people who complained would have simply stayed with normal dungeons. And also it would have promoted manual grouping. And there would never have been a need for a "mythic" difficulty.
---
Teleporting to dungeons,BG's etc. I agree shouldnt be a thing. You should have to run to entrances and enter, as it actually makes the world more alive.
---
GCD imo should not be a thing, a better solution would be to have some class specs be slower so that people who dont want super fast gameplay, play those classes.
---
I would actually hope that we get more content in Classic, but I dont understand why they only want to add raids. Add some amazing dungeons with lore, add quest zones like Quel'thalas, add battlegrounds and more importantly, add new things. World events like a jumping puzzle, a maze run, a death run, cinematics that are unlocked through new quests maybe some cool mini murder story in Stormwind that are difficult and require you to get things from the world like a shovel to dig something up. 
---
Side note, I would like to see more content added to Classic after the fact but I would also like to see TBC and WotLK being available as static products that progress but then stay there forever with maybe some fresh realms from time to time. Heck, I would even **love** a 4.1 Cataclysm realm as I genuinelly loved early Cataclysm, the only bad thing was flying and removal of content among other things.
---
Im all for no change an all, but at the same time i wish they would just give pallies a taunt. Hell, even a engineering-only trinket with a 1 min cooldown taunt would be enough for me.
---
Hell yes, but I'd like at least 2 years before classic servers start offering that as an option.  We don't want another situation where Naxx is out for such a short period before BC that &lt;1% of players get to see it.
---
I remember actually remember summoning this dude. When did people stop doing this? I started wotlk
---
Basically everything had a cd in wc3... And aside from gimmicky "bubble up and kill peasants" strats, competitive paladins chosen later for healing primarily, since you could get better damage out of any other hero

It's an expansion, not WoW 2. ???
---
I'm actually not going any further with your comment. You just actually hate anything that isn't Vanilla because it isn't Vanilla. 
---
I loved vanilla once. I can love it again even if pservers were different. 
---
It doesnt. It just reveals that he got mightily upset about something. That's my main gripe about this current dumb af culture where we have to be politically correct all the time. People just take advantage of this to bait others into saying something politically incorrect while avoiding all the "bad" words themselves, and then they go crying to authorities because someone used the wrong word.
---
As long as the OP refuse to provide context, I will not make any judgements about what kind of person anyone in the screenshot is like.
---
I feel like Warrior/Priest would open up so many more avenues for you guys to experience the full expanse of leveling together.
---
My wife and I are currently leveling a Warrior/Warlock together on a private server, and the melee-caster synergy is so, so nice. The only thing that we sometimes miss are CC or heals which would allow us to crush some tougher quests, and swapping the Warlock for a Priest would solve most of that issue.
---
For crafting, having an Alchemist is fantastic while leveling up as both of you, no matter your class composition, will benefit from everything the Alchemist makes. The other could be anything, but I've found that Engineer bombs added some extra DPS that helped us handle some otherwise crazy pulls. If you go the Warlock/Priest route, Alchemy/Tailoring would probably work really well, too, and prevent you guys from fighting for drops as much.
---
**The quickest of shifts can still kill you if you cant predict all boss attacks**
---
So you get a melee swing timer for the boss, the second he hits you you shift out, press healthstone and shift back. A macro will make it a bit quicker but not by much since shifting out does not consume the global cooldown. This is not adviced at all with bosses that have spells or abilities that have a internal cooldown but not a set usage, meaning it is random inbetween casts, making it insanely stupid to do this aslong as there is healers alive and you cant predict **all** of the boss attacks.
---
So on for example Garr this is possible, but should still not be needed. I have healthstone+healing potion binded to shift+¬ß(right next to 1) and shift 1 for bearform.
---
As far as i know there are no macros that do this
---
I can go either way on this one. The way vanilla worked was it increased the risk of swapping your pets as you were vulnerable during that time period. This meant rather than just reach for the optimal pet when you saw an opponent, you had to weigh the pet matchup vs the risk of recasting. The vanilla way also adds value to some of the Demonology talents like Fel Domination and Master Summoner since those help to mitigate the risk of swapping pets. Without risk there those talents are nearly as useful. While I could see going either way on pet summoning, I don't think that the 2.0.1 way is "common sense" as /u/ambiwar suggests.
---
When it comes to the amount of talents that go into the main spec and the amount of talents that go into the off spec I wonder what the optimal ratio is to get the most variety. Like, if the ratio is 1:0 then there's literally no difference between Prot/Arms and Prot/Fury because you're not putting talents into Arms *or* Fury. At the other extreme, if the ratio is 1:1 then the only difference between Prot/Arms and Arms/Prot is the talents you choose along the way. It's not as bad as the former extreme for that reason. A tank can choose the more defensive talents in both trees and a dps can choose the more offensive ones.
---
The optimal ratio would be when Arms/Prot is *as* different from Prot/Arms as Prot/Fury is. That's the point where the 6 specs are the most distinct. When that happens is tricky though.
---
I have no input on your decision but I want to say I genuinely appreciate the approach you are taking to it.  If everyone adopts that mindset, classic is going to be amazing.
---
It's almost like words are spelled differently in different countries/languages, what a concept.
---
I am not saying it was the right way to handle it, or the wrong way, but resilience was a solution for players who wanted to PvP but not raid, who were by and large being victimized by players who raided.
---
By having resilience PvP players could never fall behind a PvE player in PvP specifically (and vise versa)  
---
thx
---
He has 2 consumables in the macro. Both proc the GCD.
---
Powershifting is not on the GCD, but you gain no benefit from it while tanking in Bear unless you are completely rage starved, which you shouldn't be while tanking. It's used for cat dps.
---
You do realize you are pretty much saying, "because I didn't like it, it wasn't good." right? Arenas were insanely fun, and the reason a lot of people played WoW as long as they did. Again, you sound like a person who complains about everything that isn't Vanilla solely because it isn't Vanilla. 
---
I think it's because a lot of people who played Vanilla at the time keep getting told by current private server players (some of whom did not even play vanilla!) what things are/were like. Honestly half the stuff I see spouted as 'fact' has just been extrapolated from niche private server communities and wasn't a thing in vanilla.
---
Honestly that would be great. These are seriously quality posts giving us some insight into the efforts to recreate the game and process being used by Blizzard. It's an interesting experience for people who played Vanilla, later patches, and private servers to see what they may have jumbled together in their head.
---
Thank you for posting this, ignore the people complaining.
---
We're talking about Blizzard; Activision-Blizzard. They just let 800 people go, many of which would have been more than capable of beta testing a game. If all 800 of them made the California minimum wage, you'd have:
---
    $11.00/hr * 40hr/week * 52wks * 800 people = $18,304,000 
---
**AT LEAST** $18m in new money available for beta testing and you think *I'm* about to *volunteer*? ayy lmao
---
If this was a friend in his basement drumming up an indy game solo or with a small team, this would be a different story.

I'm going to assume you are trolling as you didn't even bother to look up the new model showing how uninformed you are about this topic.
---
Ragnaros looking like he was built from legos? He is a molten elemental giant, made way back in the day. And the 4.2 model of Ragnaros in Firelands actually looked good. But for example the new human model shows what I mean, the new undead model shows what I mean.
---
Please if you are not trolling, look things up and inform yourself before attempting to belittle someones argument. Son.
---
Have u ever played any of expansions after wrath?
---
They're pretty much already screeching about how they don't want 2.5k person servers and an official world chat, while simultaneously tossing a "NO CHANGES" at anybody other change they disagree with. 
---
I don't have the most valuable input but I might caution against him playing a warrior.  Depends on the personality type of course, but warriors can be frustrating to level at times and sometimes take a lot of crap from other players (for example, in dungeons if a wipe happens).  It's a little bit higher pressure, and sometimes younger players might not handle that sort of pressure as well.
---
This has merit sure, but the fact is that even if you as a PvPer fell behind. You had a path to take to get the gear, relatively fast. 
---
Cataclysm PvP was imo very good
---
almost about gear/stats is going to change because most of it was equally true on actual retail vanilla lol. at the same time, not everyone that played on a private server is delusional and thinks they're 100% accurate. this private server/anti-private server circlejerk is so annoying
---
Same here, holy paladin main and rogue alt, gonna try something different this time around. Hunter is my choice, pet system and ranged weapons baby, whole new game!
---
Not surprised by this. Beta tested a BC server that had mount prices all messed up. I reported it and was told they were right. That they couldn‚Äôt adjust the mount cost, so it had to be right cause that would be straight from the client.
---
Then I just linked them the 2.4.3 patch notes from blizzards website (back when blizzard had all the old patch noted there). Only after multiple reports and links of the patch notes did it get changed.
---
This was also an ‚Äúamazing dev‚Äù with ‚Äúthe best scripts‚Äù. Not surprised that there is still stuff of with vanilla versions. I will say the Nost core is a lot better now than prior to going open source.
---
I unfortunately stuck with until BfA where I unsubbed after 2-3months.
---
Only if it doesn't damage the classic server. It would need to be entirely independent of my 60 toon on classic.
---
bro he called him the n word and youre defending him. jesus lol.
---
When they give us new information, people get pissy and spin of whirlpools of pointless rage. I mean look at the damn thread the OP linked. If this community didn't have such a massive amalgamation of toxic manchildren then maybe they would be more open to talk with us. 
---
Classic player: Release classic, it's what people want!  
---
Also classic player: Don't re-release tbc or wotlk, I don't like them and want to keep other players in my game.
---
the Arena! haha, good times.
---
I just wish pserver players weren't so invested in the notion that pservers are a perfect recreation of vanilla and that they're innovating on some kind of changing meta in order to validate their accomplishments. Private servers are full games in their own right with own set of rules, it'd be dumb to try and play like Vanilla, it's smart to take private servers for what they are and optimize around that. Just because private servers are inaccurate does not invalidate the impressive accomplishments of there hardcore private server guilds.
---
&gt; They have not confirmed indefinite vanilla servers because there likely won‚Äôt be.  
---
Yea they did.  
---
&gt; there will be stuff they need to fix...  
---
You're saying that emulating a fixed and unchanging goal is a never ending process?  Horseshit.  I'm sure it will ship with some edge cases, because of exactly as you say, they are using a newer client to try to emulate older stuff, and they'll miss stuff.  
---
But this isn't an ever moving goal, the goal is the goal.  They'll be mostly at that goal when they turn on the servers, and after a little bit of work, they'll be at that goal.  Then they don't need to change a damned thing, and it will cost them, instead of a low amount, almost nothing.  
---
&gt; but releasing just classic with no expac progression will piss investors off  
---
No, it won't.  It's just free income for no effort.  I would want any company I am invested in to maintain their low effort income streams while putting expensive developers on creating NEW income streams.  And that's the lowest level I would care about it as an investor.  
---
&gt; but they are looking for growth not stagnation  
---
No, they aren't.  
---
Running a vanilla server is so cheap that people do it all the time, today, for almost nothing.  Blizzard will pay barely even that much once they have an acceptable client.  
---
Again, they may one day launch BC servers, or LK servers, or something else based on the core "multiple simultaneous patch support" client that they've chosen to build for classic WoW.  But to assume that some nebulous "investor" class will identify classic WoW as needing to pace through a bunch of expansions at high cost and *despite developer stated intent and community expectation*, is fucking nuts-O.
---
In my opinion that's the best way to start.  
---
Having to experience being a bit of a noob makes it feel that much better to catch up to the curve.
---
I'm gonna go in blind on a completely new class and play it my way.
---
If you hate part of a game it's definitely time to stop playing it dude.
---
oh, I totally forgot about an epic PvP adventure within Thousand needles mind controlling horde off the huge cliffs.
---
I imagine the under construction signs from vanilla hyjal lol
---
Server population + international 24/7 high pop servers is going to be a MASSIVE culture shock to the private server players. I can see many going back to the Nost-alikes for that reason alone.
---
Blizzard listening to feedback? I thought that was an old urban legend.
---
So true. Hybrids always get solid invites, double so if people know you're a decent player. But being 100% honest, while we'd totes be okay with them doing their dps thing, we can't find a healer... think you could heal instead? I know you have a healing set, I remember you getting that one healing item when no one else needed it. Also, you should go ahead and respec, to be safe. 
---
Few variants:
---
1. You want to play TBC, i don't. I still transfer a char, give you my gold, you give me gold on Vanilla in return.
---
2. Put gold on char 1 on vanilla server, transfer to TBC, send gold to char 2 on vanilla server, transfer to TBC and go on. 
---
I agree that Vanilla gold had more value, but especially at the start gold was very important in TBC. Consumables got a lot more important, the 5k for Epic flying was also very important and took a lot of ppl a long time to get. 
---
&gt;The 'new Vanilla' wont be like the older one. You cannot live in that feeling again, and it will never be the same. You could learn this from your lives, if smth was truly special and good, you cannot do that again, and you wont feel the EXACT same way.
---
Having done some testing on a private server, it's just the same sort of awesome gaming crack that it used to be.  This isn't nostalgia for me, this me wanting to play a game I enjoy.
---
You can probably get off 1 pot before going back into bear if you time atks properly on bosses with slow attacks yes.
---
Be very careful though.
---
I have no doubt we all have fuzzy memories of specifics from Vanilla. 
---
&gt;He has 2 consumables in the macro. Both proc the GCD. 
---
thank you, that was helpful
---
Definitely. 
---
Hoping there will be a possibilty to copy the character over to a separate tbc real. Though, after tbc im out. Wotlk started the trip downhill.
---
That‚Äôs one of the other things i miss the most, Spriest were definitely my favorite class/spec back then.
---
Well the risk of recasting is already built in most scenarios simply because of the fact that re-summoning a pet takes 10 seconds.
---
I'm simply stating that having your pet disappear instantly even because of simple missclick seems awful to play around, imagine being an SM/Ruin Lock in a tank group and you have an imp out for the stamina buff, you missclick one your summoning spells by mistake and your imp disappears. 
---
Ok but just don't present retail features as options? Your comment doesn't make any sense. They vote on options. Give options for new classic content. Retail players are irrelevant. 
---
Blue is great for reporting this finding and communicating clearly with the community, no complaints with that at all.
---
Overall I am a little concerned that this will be used as some strawman argument intended to discredit the input of those who played on private servers.
---
I played a lock 1-60 on a huge private server and I had no problems at all with the assertion that pets despawn when summoning a new one. I even remember it that way in vanilla. So I don't think it's helpful to cherry pick a few comments and pretend they are prevalent among all vanilla Nost-type players.
---
Remember that private servers have been the ONLY WAY to play vanilla for the past 12 years. The devs of these servers had to conduct science experiments just to approximate how vanilla existed, in the same way that Classic team is doing experiments to verify that data. All of this was done out of necessity because Blizzard NEVER HELPED until now.
---
[Not as great as it seems, IMO.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/alu1bz/dumb_thursday_math_rushing_out_of_starting_zone/)
---
Yup! For sure, that's the whole point. Making the opposite faction log off is a win too but ideally they call their friends a a war starts over contested territory.
---
Thank you for publishing this.  
---
That‚Äôs what a lot of people think. It‚Äôs frustrating to hear them say they read the forums then not even mention what we talk about.
---
As a hunter yes always have stacks in the bank
---
What is it you do exactly? I don't understand your profession specific slang.
---
The majority of the player base can go fuck themselves.  The majority of the player base are socially inept morons.  You know what the most played game in the world is?  Candy Crush, or some variant thereof.  Do you honestly believe that the developers should take the advice of Candy Crush players for how WoW should be?  Because that is what they did.
---
But your still talking about having a system that the majority of people will leave once the complete the content. Then they will need a plan
---
It belonged there though, imo
---
Yeah but people arguing against that aren't actually "no changes" they're just morons. We need to stop bunching the actual "no changes" message in with the "just like Pserver" people. 
---
Being against things like sharding, loot trading, and right click report i.e things not in Vanilla is what no changes is really about. Wanting 5k server caps and tbc XP rates is definitely "changes".
---
It seems you believe Classic is still based largely around nostalgia. 
---
Hundreds of thousands of players have played on vanilla servers. They know what they are getting and why they play it.
---
Hardly anyone is expecting to relive the past. They just want to play a better version of Wow again. It's all really very simple.
---
Or he could just be easily tilted and lose his shit straight away over very little, kinda like you, telling me to fuck off, assuming i'm "most likely behaving like a monumental asshole" x)
---
This has clearly gotten to you in some way, don't hurt your self too much.
---
Yeah heavy competition in the melee department. Healer/caster is always welcomed. Guess it depends what you want to get out of classic
---
As you can see many for many players it is a nostalgia  
---
But many players are going to return now, so they can enjoy the game they enjoyed, just like you.  
---
Different people, different feelings
---
Where did they say they will have permanent vanilla servers. Send me a link that directly shows where blizzard said this.
---
The dream of most private server players was a "progress through expansion" server that would go through TBC and/or WotLK. While it never actually happened, the idea was extremely popular and the main server that was boasting this experience was very hyped.
---
How about you link me to things you are trying to discuss, *son*. 
---
And, yes, many of the old boss models looked silly/stupid. Far from intimidating, or cool.
---
And I see nothing obtusely wrong with the new human/undead models. Maybe you could, you know, kindly point out your issue with them besides citing "Disney". 
---
Also 0 investors aim for stagnation and 0 companies aim for negative to stagnation growth. How does that make any sense to you
---
Agreed. I think loot trading WILL be abused, by some players. But as a whole I think loot trading will be fine, and used in non toxic ways.
---
Thank you, yeah I guessed it would be like that. Thought that maybe a macro could do the shifting so fast that you cant be hit in between. But if consumables or trinkets trigger the gcd it will not work anyway i guess.
---
lol I can't tell if that's sarcasm or not. 
---
Yeah, this is one of the only things I hate about playing a warlock.  Instant cast dots with a time delay that let's other people tag the mob while my damage does the work.
---
Launch is going to be interesting...my current plan is to create each of my alts and then do flight point runs to get exploration xp to level 3 or 4, then go back and push through the starting areas with a bit of an edge.
---
Sharding means you'll "only" be competing against 50/100 players in a zone instead of 1,000
---
Oh that makes sense, thanks for explaining it to me! 
---
Working hitches in the patch duh 
---
After doing some testing on a private server, I'm back to the same two classes I enjoyed in Vanilla: Warrior Tank/PvP Hunter.  The play style just suits me more than the other classes.
---
Hunter to 10 is one of the easiest. Practiced it many times. 
---
Hunter is a skill class. You immediately know who hasn't learned to play a hunter by watching how they play in noob zones. Any time to 20 will be highly skewed if done by someone who doesn't know how to efficiently level 1-10.
---
Yep i just wanted to highlight that nothing can feel the exact same way, those thousand of people who will return to Vanilla got older, I just wanna say it reaaaaaally carefully that they wont enjoy it like they did back then.  
---
I wanna state that i actually liked Vanilla, I'll also return, but i know it wont feel the exact same way
---
I get that, but the person asking the question in this case literally asked the Devs to check to see if it was correct or not. They didn't spout it off as fact.
---
Which is why Blizzard changed that for The Burning Crusdade.
---
Just so happens it wasn't in classic wow.
---
&gt;Isn't this the case of any progression in the game at all?
---
Obsolescence of old gear is to be expected in an expansion, but it could have been handled way better. It was literally the first 61 quest green I got that I had to start replacing my old gear, breaking set bonuses that I spent so much time to get. It would have been nice if it took until the first dungeon blues, or ANY blue, before needing to replace tier gear. Replacing stuff in the first 15 minutes of the expansion felt terrible.
---
&gt; the same complaint about Naxx being released. Oh man all my BWL and AQ gear just isn't top tier anymore?
---
The difference is that Naxx gear took effort to get. TBC was throwing level 61 greens at me that shamed my old gear. It didn't feel like "There is better gear out there, go get it", and instead felt more like "Your Naxx gear is shit, here's some crap from the good will pile, put some mismatched shit on and make yourself useful"
---
&gt;You haven't done them in 12 years and you still never want to do them ever again?
---
I mentioned that I did go through them more recently in Legion when they were brought back as scaled Timewalking dungeons. But yes even in that form I despised doing them again. Doing them in a real TBC setting would be even worse.
---
&gt; I bet you are about to do Vanilla end game dungeons as much as you ever did a BC one.
---
I did the Vanilla dungeons WAY more than the TBC dungeons. I leveled up more characters during Vanilla and started on fresh servers multiple times before TBC came out. Yes, I am looking forward to doing the Vanilla dungeons again. I never got sick of them like I did with TBC dungeons. The big difference is that **I enjoyed Vanilla Dungeons** and **I did not enjoy TBC Dungeons**.
---
&gt;Also just because you didn't personally enjoy TBC doesn't mean a lot of people aren't only playing Classic in the hopes it goes to TBC.
---
I didn't say anything about that, I'm not sure who you are arguing with on that one.
---
Nah, I order a milkshake when I go to McDonald‚Äôs not a fucking latte shakerato. Unless you have a proper translation (you can‚Äôt really translate maccheroni can you? same goes with spaghetti, which thank god you amazingly managed to get right) you shouldn‚Äôt misspell and call it a different spell (lol wut?). it‚Äôs just a word forged by people‚Äôs ignorance that was born from what people thought they were hearing.

---
Fastest method of killing I have found from 10-20 is to hybrid play bear and take on 2 mobs at once. Moonfire each, hot if you think it's required, enter bear and melee down. You want the layered damage and thorns doing damage asap.
---
How could a private server be more accurate than blizzard that literally have the original data. There's literally no argument here. 
---
Pserver trying to find out bosses armor value: hmm let's look at some 240p kill videos, shity screeenshots and guesswork wowhead/thottbot comments.
---
Blizzard's way: hmm let's just take a look at the source code or boot up our retail vanilla server and look.
---
Of course. That thing.
---
Sorry I wanted to completely retype that comment... no companies or investors ever aim for stagnation or negative growth. Every business  aims for growth. It makes no sense to say they will just say it‚Äôs low cost. They will want to turn low cost high profit into low cost higher profit. Every company works that way and if you believe otherwise your being naive
---
Not my cup of tea. 
---
Agreed.  I‚Äôm perfectly fine to stay in Vanilla and level all the classes and gear them up. If it takes 10 years, I‚Äôm fine doing just that. 
---
I would insta quit. No custom "fun server" stuff. #nochanges
---
Mandela effect, look into it
---
I would not purchase a re-released TBC. I do not have the affection for it that others do. I plan on playing Classic until I no longer play WoW at all. It's my 'put out to pasture' game, my comfy game world home that I knew, explored, loved and enjoyed. Other expansions are great, but I feel no need to go back to them. They feel modular; tacked on, stand alone, directed progression and story in the way an expansion must be to be relevant. They are nice when current, but I don't need them long term.
---
He's half right. Half the community didn't want most of the changes he mentioned, half did. Well, now that they're making classic the half that didn't want the changes has somewhere to go.
---
There are so many specs/builds/BiS from private servers that would have been laughable if brought up on the old EJ forums (who theorycrafted the hell out of everything). It'll be great when the real version of the items/effects is re-released and they find out half the stuff they thought was BiS was just broken code they'd been exploiting for years.
---
Shaman on Horde: I recently leveled 1 to over 20 as a test.
---
Shaman is EXTREMELY easy to level to 20 and is rather fast. They start to slow down around 25-40 if you haven't kept your gear up. 40+ starts to take off but is about middle of the pack for leveling speed.
---
My claim: "I played TBC and liked it at the time, but realize almost everything they did set WoW on the course to stop being an MMO. I think most of the design decisions for TBC was poor."
---
Your response: "A few were REALLY poor, most were great if not perfect."
---
Please name design decisions that were MMO improvements (not RPG improvements.) Name decisions that improved community interaction. I'd like this long list of perfect design decisions that I am misremembering. I make this distinction because an MMORPG without community is just a shitty online RPG. So please, share with me the *long list of design changes* that *improved community.*
---
"Like once a decent number of players hit 60, a lot of areas effectively "die", that is just the nature of the game."
---
Actually no. There were important materials in vanilla that brought you to contested territory on a grounded mount. You went by lvl 30's and 40's and arrived by flight path in specific high traffic locations. There were key fishing spots, herbs, ore, etc. You'd bump into a low level and offer to help them with a tough elite quest from time to time just cause. They'd remember you forever for it.
---
"but the players cry that it wouldn't be true to their pain from when they were younger."
---
Nah, just telling you my preference. There were zero hyperbolic statements that I have made so you must be strawmanning my comments based on someone else's words. However, your generalizations about a group of people's views seem very hyperbolic, misinformed, and sensationalist. It is like you go and find the craziest statements ever written and assume everyone thinks that way.
---
Regardless on whether you agree X was good, wow has been riddled with complainers since its inception. Yes they were the minority, and tons of players strongly approved the changes. But the thing about minority/majority is context it's in. Retail captures a certain group of players, with their preferences, and classic captures a different group of players with their preferences. It's possible that for [players who will play classic], OP's post is more representative than, say, my preferences.
---
Tl;dr even though I give Blizz a lot of leeway, I don't know the classic-playerbase-to-come, and I can't realistically say what will or won't be their preferences. Much less whether their desires (like flying/lfg) will result in a system they are more likely to enjoy playing.
---
Recently in BFA they had a loot issue in reverse, where Azerite armor wasn't tradeable. People complained and they changed it, so we could trade Azerite Armor. No reason why they can't do the opposite in classic if we all agree its terrible.
---
The thing that really sucks is that it never seems to fill me up. It's all empty calories. 
---
Maybe it's because I'm undead...
---
I hope they intend to be faithful to design and not make stealth changes and just claim "you remember it wrong"
---
This gives a lot of leeway to them being able to nip certain things in the bud (DM farming for example) and just say it was always like that.
---
https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=4612
---
Yes, it's private server data so it doesn't mean that was the case in retail vanilla
---
Well, depending on when Dire Maul is released, you definitely skip the Living Leggings for Padre‚Äôs Trousers: https://classicdb.ch/?item=18386
---
I remember both versions, the disorientation and when the pet just immediatly de-spwaned but cant remember wich expansion they are, thankfully blizzard know exactly.  
---
I remember when it used to de-spawn immediatly and you accidently press a summon pet button you were like -\_-
---
It doesn't really explain a "lack of trust". I also don't buy it was a 50/50 split at the time. People really underestimate how popular many of the changes were as they incrementally came. It was only looking back that many of them were determined to be bad for the game.
---
I'll be rolling a mage and will be giving out free food and drinks to everyone that asks
---
I'd be very interested, if only to set up keybindings and macros.  Maybe even get a head start on add-ons.
---
Been spending hours leveling various classes on pservers and I still can't decide. Right now I'm between druid and warrior. I really love tanking and healing dungeons, although I can't decide which one I like more. Leaning towards tanking atm. If I went druid, I would be perfectly happy healing raids; if warrior, I'd be fine ending up as DPS if necessary. Leveling as a druid is much more fluid, much more (solo) WPvP potential; but warrior is so damn fun in group play of all kinds, and they're just badass.
---
Couple specific questions:
---
I just ran WC as bear tank and it was fun, but I didn't have nearly as many buttons to push than as warrior, and felt like I had a little less control. Is this still true later on? Any general comments on warrior vs druid tanking? (mostly thinking dungeons not raids)
---
I keep reading people saying druids have no "out-of-combat" res, and therefore they're not as good at healing dungeons as other classes. Although I swear to god a druid just rezzed me after a fight was over. Am I misunderstanding the term?
---
I did stop playing it. Of the various times that I played, quit, and went back to WoW, my stint during TBC was the shortest. My break from WoW after TBC was also the longest because I was so put off from the game after that.
---
It will turn into any game's sub-reddit.
---
Group A) Enjoying the game, posts fun times meme content.
---
Group B) Unhappy with something in the game and whining and bitching.
---
You're assuming people are rational.
---
Assuming there is a Beta, and that I get in Yes. I would play just enough to confirm a few things about the math of the game lines up with my end game plans. If it doesn't I will swap classes. 
---
I will then practice leveling to 15, maybe 20. 
---
Honestly it's one of the main reasons I'm excited for classic. Lower pop and finally  not having 24/7 contested mobs
---
Problem there is that blizzard would have to plan for it from the get go, and by having two types they let us all know they plan for it which will piss some people off from the first minute. On top of that Why would I want to join a "Progressive" server when I have no idea how far they plan on going? They won't tell us from the start how may of these they plan, so if I like TBC I don't want to risk joining a server that will progress to WoTLK or even worse progress eventually all the way to WoD or Legion etc. 
---
I love classic, I like TBC more. They are going to be better off copying the servers at the time of the expansion hitting. Whole server copied, no more copies ever again so when TBC hits you can go to the version of your server that is TBC and all your characters and stuff will be there at whatever level they are with whatever they have. It will be just like when the expansion hit originally except it does not kill the vanilla server and your characters and stuff will still be there under that ruleset forever. In this way they can make new expansion servers as far as they want to go, while not allowing any dupe nonsense.
---
To the top with you.
---
I do every day. They don‚Äôt care.
---
Hi, /u/captainkaba
---
I'll start: I believe, all these minmaxing threads, guides for BiS and leveling optimizations which are a large part of the discussion here are part of the poison that killed vanilla wow.
---
Pserver babies? I never played a warlock on pservers. I did from wotlk to pandaria though. That‚Äôs why I thought that‚Äôs how it works. It‚Äôs not just pserver players you like to shit on.
---
The subs don't die off because people are hitting the end of content (Most don't get there) but because it is pointless to play when there is an expansion (Forced) coming down the road in a couple months. Why get new gear or try to push content when it will all be erased in a short time? A server that is forever vanilla (Or TBC, or Lich king etc.) will have the people who want to play that expac and while some will run out of content and quit eventually, the older expansions have more staying power for casual players who will take FOREVER to get to the end of content, if they ever do.
---
Diluting the world by introducing another continent was a mistake.
---
Arena was good for antisocial gamers for sure.
---
&gt;Retribution

[Well there's your problem!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xhgvouRprw)
---
To newbs:
---
1. This talk about raiding and wanting to have a good raid spec is pretty cringy. None of that happens until level 60. The current record by Joana, master of speedleveling classic wow, is 116 hours. If you're new, expect to take at least twice that long (Joana says that the avg /played at 60 is something like 800 hours if I remember correctly). Just getting to 60 is hardcore in my view, nevermind raiding. The actual game, at least for the first several hundred hours or so, is leveling, not raiding. So prioritize the leveling experience first.
---
2. My advice is to play every race/class combo that excites you until level 20ish. You'll know it once you feel it, and that'll naturally become your favorite.
---
3. On a personal note though: After leveling frost Mage, shadow Priest, and ret Paladin in classic wow, and thinking they were all awesome and fun... and then trying affliction Warlock... oh. Oh my. Life Drain, Life Tap, Healthstone, Soulstone... it feels like cheating.
---
Sadly no. The meta strategy is bum rush the enemy points with minimal if any defense to get a fast win or fast lose, which is preferable to a slow win for honor/rep purposes.
---
If he did add additional debuffs like 100% crit Sbolt uptime and 100% Nightfall, you can move closer to values you can see, but that's straight away artificial inflation of numbers and misleading of players.
---
I already did address your question, good players of "wrong" specs do exist, but that's a tiniest proportion of their population you can not take in account. And you can instantly see a good player by his buff/gear choices. 
---
Yeah 12 h games and/or not getting in an AV for 2h min wait time... I miss those days...
---
Considering we'll likely get 1.12 AV, I expect them to last an hour at the most. 
---
Most NPCs are gone in that version, which means there's a lot less resistance to just rushing past each other. If things take longer, it's likely because a few groups take the towers/bunkers back and people wipe on the endboss. 
---
Yep, just rolled a new char on &lt;most populated pserver&gt; to mess around again, and realized again how much I hate playing on these servers. It's not a few people hanging around all the quests spots....it's 3 groups of 4 all waiting around to hit mobs the second they spawn! It's miserable.
---
Rush wand!
---
Like I said it's not hard, just a pain in the arse. Stutter step kiting with auto shot is simple, pulling extra and having no room to do so (e.g. Caves) is annoying. 
---
Echo Isles voodoo trolls are a great example of where before getting a pet is horrible. You actually can't kill them before they either heal back to full, they catch you, or you go OOM. You obviously are meant to go Razor Hill and North before you do echo Isles so it's not a huge problem after that. Can't quite remember the level you get to, if you get a pet, before you get back to Echo Isles though. 
---
I only recently started playing on a pserver and noticed a phenomenon I don't remember from my Vanilla wow days. 
---
With most people having their hearthstone set to Kargath, there is ALWAYS at least one mage sitting outside selling ports / food water for 1g. 
---
There is one guy that seems to always be there and I've given him so much gold for ports at this point that he will port me for free. 
---
He has to do a brisk business. In less than 5 min I seen him port 5 or more people. 
---
They dont, never did as far as i can remember. You'll get hit by the global when you enter bearform, not when you exist it or use a consumable. My point being that even if its macroed the macroes I've used on instructor rezuvious for dps was not quick (or whatever) enough as his mana burn instant killed me in the middle of a shift, even with a macro. Now I dont know anything about macros and simply copy+phaste those that i can find, also private servers might be different from how it was and how it will be, I have no clue.
---
Seems out of line with the idea that they want to have vanilla available for as long as the game exists. You make more money having vanilla servers available forever, while having TBC come in later to catch that group (I have friends who would not come back for vanilla but probably would for TBC) and then maybe even WoTLK. It splits the community some, but overall giving players more options means more players who would want to sign up and pay blizz for access.
---
What kinda stuff do you mean? 
---
I would disagreed. The only way to make it work would be a character transfer, not a copy, identical to transfers today between servers, except one way.
---
I get that people want to be proud of their in-game accomplishments, I guess I just disagree on the source of pride. Two of my best moments in my 13-14 year long wow career was getting a rank 1 dps parse on a boss and beating someone playing the same class as me but almost one entire tier ahead in gear.
---
I legit don't give a fuck about what I look like. People who play with me know that I'm a good player, that's enough. I don't need some irrelevant low level in IF to be drooling over my gear to feel validated. 
---
I also think the people that do will be disappointed when they realise that the game is so easy that anyone who actually tries will just look exactly the same as everyone else anyway. 
---
Buddy of mine is a mechanic out in the patch. He was the one that introduced me to WoW.
---
He one time saw a Timberwolf bigger than most NBA players. Had to shoot sparks from an angle grinder to scare it off.
---
They are not "adding new graphics". They are painstakingly recreating the original one, down to correcting single lampposts. There will be an option to use (or not) the updated water, shadows and a larger ground clutter. These are not "new graphics", they are just engine options.
---
The energy regeneration will be how it was. The demo was wrong.
---
I don't know what "crit" is alluding to but based on the previous two things, I assume you are wrong on that too.
---
They are aiming to recreate the game as faithfully as they can. There will be changes but those are not the kind you are thinking about. Although they *might* change a little how the game is played, like loot sharing, it's not a given that the change will be driven mainly by the game or mainly by the players, and there might be other player driven changes too. This doesn't change however that the game will be (hopefully) a very faithful recreation.
---
For all intents and purposes it will be Vanilla.
---
Of course those who have played originally cannot have their experiences back. This is just universal truth. You can't go back in time, etc. Nothing to do with the game, which will be still the same exceptionally good one. Just like all the other very good games you can enjoy it for what it is. First time, second time or a hundredth time.
---
&gt;design changes that improved community
---
Class balance being a massive one. Allowing Horde and Alliance to have Shaman and paladin. A smaller raiding unit and therefore a tighter knit group. 10 man raiding which allowed more people to experience it. Arena which pretty much created the entire PvP scene for WoW. Badges gave people a reason to keep revisting old dungeons and raids, helping newer people or less geared people find groups. 
---
You didn't list any on why it was worse, so I'm going to stop there. 
---
"actually no, let me cherry pick some specific examples that also applied to TBC but in a different way"
---
You ran into people all the time in TBC. TBC was a pretty small continent, you absolutely had to engage in the community to do a lot of things. Just because it wasn't on the ground and the level disparity wasn't as big, doesn't mean it wasn't there. 
---
Again you just say I am wrong because I am wrong. You literally disregarded half my post to pick out all the things you disagreed with with no context as to why you disagree with them. 
---
For every thing you can list from TBC being a flaw and how the game was ruined, I could list a massive flaw in Vanilla that was downright retarded that gets a pass because #nochange. Like Vanilla you can't even play half the specs available, but replacing gear ruined the entire WoW franchise for you? The fact that they share capital cities ruined WoW for you but an 8 debuff limit should be put in because it made WoW more authentic to the original? 
---
Of course I am going to pull comments from the entire sub and general #nochanges crowd in comparisons to TBC. You literally didn't give any examples as to why TBC ruined everything but demand that I give you them. Also you say TBC ruined everything after a decade of bad decisions from Blizzard. TBC was the highlight of WoW's history for most people. It's not anyones fault that Blizzard doubled down on the worst parts of it. 
---
So, what, you run to a different spirit healer, relog, and you can Rez sickness at the new spirit healer?
---
Oh wow haven't heard this before.
---
I should have known this post were going to be garbage, anything with the title "my thoughts on X" tends to be.
---
It made an entire PvP community... 
---
Yes, absolutely.
---
The NPCs were also nerfed by then as well. I hope that the "based one 1.12" thing has some exceptions, AV being one of them. AV existed as a day-long grindfest for much of Vanilla, and it feels like the more Vanilla version that people would be looking for. 
---
We'll have some time to speculate/discuss on it, as BGs won't be out with the launch of Classic. 
---
I'm pretty sure leveling in STV was about the most peaceful experience I ever had in WoW.  But all you pserver folks keep insisting *"no no it's a bloodbath, it's awful!"*  I think y'all are crazy.

**DnD style, Argent Dawn-themed Roleplay**

* **Region:** EU
---
* **Server Type:** RP
---
* **Faction:** Alliance
---
* **Play Times:** Varied.
---
* **Priorities:** Leveling &gt; Roleplay &gt; Dungeons

---
#  Introduction; In-Universe
---
The Vanguard, commonly known as the ‚ÄòArgent Spear‚Äô was originally  created in order to allow the Dawn to strike at foes in the farthest  corners of the plaguelands of Lordaeron.
---
Over the years as they gradually discovered the agents of both the  Burning Legion and the Scourge have spread to the civilized regions of  the world, the Dawn started deploying them as an expeditionary force.
---
Nowadays they are known to operate all across Azeroth. Anywhere evil rears its ugly head, they will be there to meet it.
---
# Introduction; Out of Character
---
The Argent Vanguard aims to be the premier roleplaying destination  for all your Argent Dawn themed roleplaying needs on Classic WoW.
---
We will offer:
---
* Weekly events &amp; multi-part campaigns.
---
* A commendation system for tracking player achievements.
---
* A defined path of progression, with multiple platoons &amp; roles to fill.
---
* Our own, home-brew RPG system for events.
---
* Discord server.
---
Our Roleplay will be grounded in canonical lore, with our events  taking place during the Vanilla timeline. This does not mean however  that concepts expanded upon and introduced in later expansions can‚Äôt be  introduced into our stories, within reason.
---
We wish to emphasize persistence through our Roleplay, so we will  often spend long periods of time away from major Roleplaying hubs, even  outside of guilds events.
---
We also wish to manage &amp; maintain a PvE &amp; PvP wing of the guild to fully exploit the content offered by the game.
---
With the Vanguard there will be no downtime, always having something to do.
---
I wonder how long you guys can repost this insignificant factoid for upvotes, we're setting records with karma-farming and reposting.
---
Arena players are notorious as being the most embarrassing community in the history of the game.
---
like it or not, these are my thoughts, dunno why u upset about a post

you wasted your own time if you read it when u clearly knew its gonna be 'garbage'

I was the only person in my friends group, that actually liked fishing in Wow (I was listening to audiobooks). I fed my pet with fish, leveled cooking with fish, sold fish and the food to my friends, even sold whole "level your cooking up" - sets with enough fish and all the recipes so they could level up cooking in one sitting and bought my first horse from that money. I also had enough cloth for first aid and other material from fishing, even a rare blue ring.
---
When I logged in, people started to write: "Does it suddenly smell like fish?" instead of writing "hello".

---
&gt;Higher skill PvP that wasn't about grinding or ganking.
---
I have move Resilience = I win. Much skill, so PvP, wow.
---
&gt; Professions were finally useful in longer term. 
---
Hm? Professions were degraded in TBC.
---
&gt; Quests were a lot more expansive and better tied to the story. 
---
First step to the 'story-driven' player centrist MMO. No phasing yet but getting there.
---
&gt; Much less grinding required for doing content. 
---
I mean. How is it a good thing?
---
&gt; More 5-man progression with heroics, and smaller raids were delightful to organise in comparison to 40 man raids. 
---
Heroics aka reuse of the same content. Smaller raids were not as fun. 
---
But it seems to me that you simply want a simpler, less grinder game. 
---
There was a guy on the official forums saying that Blizzard is wrong about the warlock summoning fiasco, he was shut down by a CM.  
---
Because of that, I can guarantee you your exact scenario is coming.  
---
I'm pretty sure everyone realizes that.
---
I played a Rogue almost exclusively from the last couple months of Vanilla all the way through the first month of Cata.  At the *very* end of Wrath, I got my Warrior to 80 and geared up quickly in welfare epics and was able to jump straight into ICC.  I fell in love with Warrior tanking and plan on rolling a Warrior for Classic!
---
Name one raiding build that is popular on private servers and explain why it doesn't actually work in vanilla.
---
Because WC3 was where Blizzard was going with the lore, and the story was in Outland? Like I would agree that they should have made Outland just part of the Expansion and not the entire expansion, but to question why they made it at all seems kind of silly doesn't it? There was a little bit of Azeroth used in TBC at least. Kara, Sunwell, ZA, CoT, etc. They definitely could have done more to tie in the already established world. Although in Cata they did use Azeroth and people hated it more than any other expansion. So I say again, faulting WoW because it isn't Vanilla just doesn't fly as criticism. 
---
I think the worry is putting hundreds of hours into something and then being forced to play something different to get in to raids. For example, feral DPS. 
---
I‚Äôm still debating on playing rogue or mage. I‚Äôll be doing around 50/50 pve pvp so I want a class that does good in both. For rogue, I like melee more, the aesthetic, and some of it‚Äôs utility. But for mage, they have overall good quality of life. I played warrior in retail, but I don‚Äôt like the leveling, need for top gear, etc. Ill be prob alliance so what race is good for rogue, mage?  
---
Part of the reason they took so long was because it was new and people had not devised solid strategies yet. Lots of people went in and did their own thing, exploring and doing the quests, contributing little to their sides effort at winning. Even once an optimum strat was found it took a long time for it to become common enough knowledge that enough players in a given AV would participate in that strategy for it to work.
---
I don't know what the AV strat looks like now, but toward the end of Vanilla it was reduced down to "both sides ignore each other and whichever one kills the enemy npc first wins". It was a far cry from the 3 day massive battles.
---
I mostly did this in TBC, not Vanilla, but I don't see why it wouldn't still work...
---
Pretty scummy of me, but as an Undead Rogue, I'd stealth into the Mage tower in Stormwind.  Guards didn't spawn in the portal room at the top, and frequently I could burst people down to death before their loading screens even wore off.  After killing a handful there'd almost always be a group of 4-5 folks who came in to try and get me, but I'd just dance back and forth through the portal until I could drop combat and go hide for a few, before resuming my ganks of unsuspecting teleporters and keeping all the mage trainers dead.
---
I began with a paladin in vanilla, as it was my favorite class from AD&amp;D, but only made it to low 40‚Äôs before I switched to a warrior. Really enjoyed tanking with that, and he became a main. I didn‚Äôt play much in BC, just a little in the leveling zones, never hit 70 while it was cap. Spent more time in Wrath, and went back to my paladin with the class changes, and tanked with him a ton.
---
So now I‚Äôll play my ‚Äòold main‚Äô of warrior again, but since it‚Äôs been more than 10 years and a main ago, it is something I‚Äôm looking forward to.
---
Precisely
---
It was vanilla, I had Herods Shoulder, full scarlet mail....
---
My gnome warrior was an alt in vanilla but became my main in Wrath. She'll be my main in Classic.  
---
Most of the people coming to play will be people who played vanilla, or are current wow fans who are curious. The number of players who never played classic and don't play wow at all will be tiny.
---
Paladins can rez so I'd say paladin. 
---
BNEC
---
I know for a fact the stun on pet crap wasn't added until much later in the games cycle. I played warlock a ton in vanilla and my pet depopped when I summoned a new one.
---
While leveling it's Shimmering flats and Ashenvale. 
---
So, here's the thing. Its been over a decade that we've had quick AV matches, right? By this point, even if you only played WoW about 10% of the time its been out, you've had over a year to do tons of AV the way it's done now. So...... have you had your fill yet? Have you killed Drek'thar enough times by zerging? Are you not the least bit interested in doing all of the shit that AV has that we've been ignoring since \~2006?
---
I've won and lost hundreds of matches in AV and maybe...... 1 or 2 of those we're the old AV that stretched on for days. I think it's long overdue that we get to do old school AV again.
---
I do still think it's a good thing people are checking these things, it's likely for things to slip past blizzard as well. The blizzcon demo had things wrong with it that got reported and that is getting fixed as well. 
---
Fair point, you definitely had to commit if you want Repentance.  I don't remember my exact build but it was somewhere in the 16/0/35 area, and I remember Repentance coming in handy a ton of times.  Might be a bit of rose tint but it was far from useless.
---
Only a couple faction NPC's could handle them once they got enough kills, such as the faction's leader, galv/belinda, and the undead guy at Iceblood tower.
---
Well, as a matter of fact, he does when we need him to.
---
He started as one of our Holy Paladins and as we progressed, we transitioned him to a hybrid role so that we don't need the extra healing, he can simply DPS with nightfall + hunter nightfalling or what not which is a massive boost to caster dps for uptime.  If we needed more cleansers or some upcoming situational healing, he'd be the right guy for the job.
---
We're committed to him as much as he's committed to us, it goes both ways to allow flexibility.
---
I‚Äôd say Late summer. Worst case scenario, you miss the opening days but have a vacation to play without all the opening crowds
---
The thing about items is it was easy to see what stats were because of the waybackmachine and allakazam you can easily see the stats of items based on their date untouched directly mined from the original game.   
---
Mechanics under the hood were a ton of guess work. Things like scripting for encounters and hidden values like boss armor were just done with some real sketchy things like old raid videos in 144p  and for boss armor a screen shot of maxeana form vanilla with beast lore used.  
---
So no you won't see item changes because they had concrete information for those.  
---
[https://web.archive.org/web/\*/http://wow.allakhazam.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://wow.allakhazam.com/)  
---
You can browse for your self and look up any item changes you want. It's a little clunky to browse because the search feature isn't going to work but you can find the items by category ( IE you want to Chromatic sword you click the categories instead of typing in its name).  
---
Things like pathing just had to be created by scratch by them by whatever "felt right". So stuff like that is bound to change.
---
BC ruined the WC3 lore by arbitrarily making old characters into villains, retconning Draenei and creating the Broken, etc. Cataclysm was hated because it destroyed the existing world and replaced it with something worse. The original expansion was planned to be a pirate one, shame it never happened.
---
This guy said it perfectly. 
---
&gt; They keep updating this stuff because private server babies keep filing bug reports and insisting they are right.
---
That was one week, more than 4 months ago, and there wasn't even a way to file bug reports then nor is there now.
---
Druids can rez too! (sort of xD albeit, much worse) 
---
Rabble, rabble, rabble!
---
Yeah i'm not the hunter and I still agree with you. I remember people who would bitch in chat about stuff like that and all I could think was "but wait..... isn't it OUR job to stop him? Why are we complaining?!" Then we'd go find that hunter and........ promptly ask him to leave. 
---
Furion, that's a nice touch. Lol
---
The way you have your skills logically paired together is the exact same as my bar.  It was cool to see that.
---
Boom. Mic drop. *thumbs up*
---
Ironforge side of the tram. Lots of traffic, and sapping people right before the train left was always fun.
---
Yeah, I don't know what he did. He has a post here, if you ask the same questions there maybe he can clearify.
---
No, you are not addressing what the intial post is about. Let me put it straight, most players are casuals even tho they think they are very good and super pro. And for these casuals min-maxing isn't that important. It doesn't matter if your specc is good, if you can't utilize it.
---
What I'm not saying:
---
-That all specs are eqaul.
---
-That everyone is gonna be good with "bad speccs".
---
-What to do if you want to do the best dps in the game.
---
Which old character did they make into villains? I don't know enough about Draenei, but weren't the broken already a thing? 
---
My point with Cata is that you are damned if you do and damned if you don't. Adding to the world means changing it and people absolutely hated it. Preserving it and making a new continent like Outland or Northrend and people cry that the old world is dead. 
---
Yeah you're rational, and I'd expect the community would be better to play with if they were more rational. I'm not saying you're incorrect, I'm saying you're fighting an uphill battle - irrational people are rarely phased by rational arguments. You do you though
---
Sure. I'm just saying that once they address it and go "nah we checked the reference client and we have it correct" people shouldn't still be arguing it further.
---
Theoretically speaking of course right?
---
Still waiting until we get a set date... and even then I don't think I would take time off until say a week or two after.
---
the first week is going to be a shit show. 
---
No idea.
---
I'd ballpark anywhere from 15-20 days played time.
---
Druids being able to see their mana without using an addon.
---
Nah there's nothing wrong with making use/the best of it..... it was just disappointing because many of the other end talents were key/fundamental and awesome. Repentance added more utility to a dps class that needed more damage..... not utility.
---
I don't think any guild would let a SL warlock DPS for them unless you're good friends with the gm/officers and have the content on farm already. Not even semi-hardcore/decent guilds.
---
Modular is a very good description of them. They don't make the world bigger, they make it smaller. As they force everyone into the same area. The old world then suffers for it. 
---
If you want to tackle Classic WoW with a sense of danger and difficulty. I'd honestly suggest tanking as a priest, its heaps of fun and integrates offensive and defensive spells. You can manage to get quite far in raiding. I grabbed it up a year ago and its a blast to play. If you want to learn more about it, I am available to talk on the priest classic discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/exJacWb
---
This is a hybrid in essence and comes down to individuals understanding the strengths of their class. Will you save the day 50/100 times? Probably not, but there are opportunities to do so.
---
Some of the "hybrid" though is that you've accepted that you'll never be top DPS (and honestly you shouldn't be in 99% of situations, maybe only elemental vulnerability drakes in BWL). However, you'll be able to float between different roles based on the encounter to decrease the stress on other people in your raid.
---
If that allows you to play boomkin for 60% of the rest of the time you raid, I'd say it's worth it.
---
I definitely agree with that. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxLLscMdxVxfoLo
---
For Druid. If you want to be able to heal more then tank, this is the build. Some benefits: Insect Swarm is useful as heals to help out the tank, also if Doing PvP it helps as part of a great opener (Pounce &gt; Rake  Rip &gt; Caster form &gt; MoonFire &gt; Insect Swarm &gt; Into bear or cat depending on enemy. This often times brings even geared players to half HP. Improved rejuv isn't super useful, as Healing touch rank 4 is your go to spell 90% of the time. While Druids were great HoT healers later on, Hots aren;t super mana effience in vanilla, and are rarely used, the 3 points are better into insect swarm and lower mana of healing touch.
---
If you plan on tanking more, I'd drop 11 points from Resto and move them into Balance to get Omen of Clarity. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLV0oZxLLscMdxVx or https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLV0oZxLLscMdtVL
---
As for Paladin I am not as sure of the exact spec. But here would be my guess at a tank/healing build for 5 and 10 mans: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVIu0xZVhtI0zvo
---
Why some things? I don't think you can get defensive capped as a paladin without losing too much int, and other stats. so I find armor to be better. Also getting crit isn't as big a deal for a paladin since you gain reckoning stacks. Spiritual focus is important to not lose too much push back, but so is Improved Seal of Righteousness, so I put 3 in both. Since paladins block a lot, getting 3/3 Sheild Spec is important
---
I would for sure. Would also play WotLK if it continued after that. But a lot of people won't want that so it's better to just open up a new server for other expansions they want to go back to.
---
If you are playing solo, and not in a group that will help you rush wand, then don't bother trying to rush wand, just buy one on AH.
---
In order to rush wand you need to either get very lucky with green drops or farm a lot of linen to tailor greens. It is going to be difficult to farm sufficient linen with all of the mob competition, and you will probably find yourself falling farther behind than if you just bought one on AH.
---
Where's the imgur album link that's mentioned in the podcast? Want to see Nineteen27's pics 
---
My main was a druid back before the talent reworkes, where innervate and hurricane where both 31 pt talents... i was a specc'd as a balance druid (because of Diablo 2... such false expectations) but played in mostly bear form. It was a disaster.
---
This time around, I'm playing as a Ele Shaman as my main, and leveling up a rogue to farm/pickpocket/transmute with.
---
So kinda like a druid... except not at all.
---
Is it against the rules to dual box a mage / warrior just to supply food? I know it would take some time to level but it could be worth it
---
Yes, if anything just to take the edge off of waiting and attack alliance mindlessly in the inevitable town raids.
---
Theres a trinket that drops from a rare naga spawn in arathi highlands. Near Faldir's Cove. 
---
Stun enemy on use. Good for classes that dont have stun. Like shamies.
---
If you're gonna go 31/20 Druid build then 5 points into furor not MOTW.
---
&gt; Graphics, energyreg, crit, etc..
---
I'm following you on the graphics. But please fill me in on energy and crit changes that you think are happening?  
---
Gonna be playing a shaman tank. On Nost me and my guild made it to AQ and I am looking to recreate that accomplishment come Classic.
---
Personally I‚Äôd rather skip it and jump into a grind version vanilla like wrath 
---
I am playing something new (didn't play most of vanilla so my tbc main was hunter) I will be playing shaman and a priest. Shaman because i am pretty sure that's what i would have played (or pally) back when it came out. So I will main an Enhancement shaman and deal with the consequences the way i would have back then. Try to make friends who don't mind bringing me along.
---
The priest because i have read fun stuff about them and farming. Also i love running dungeons and can just heal my way through them over and over to level and gear alts (i have an alt addiction)
---
this guy is definitely good.  [youtube.com/watch?v=6w5yiRM\_aFg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w5yiRM_aFg)not a guide but you can learn some stuff watching him.
---
I don‚Äôt think it is supposed to ever move from vanilla
---
They are working on rogue energy regeneration, and smth about critchance
---
brilliant!
---
where the fuck you got an idea that ppl assume they gonna feel the exact same way? 
---
you arguing with something basically most ppl (pretty much noone) think or assume will happen.
---
Ppl just want to play the game they like (and in its original form cos thats what they like), it isn't more complicated or sophisticated than that really. 
---
If you like to play a basketball you liked to play it 5 years ago, now and probably 5 years from now, cos youenjoy playing basketball. it has nothing to do with feeling the same you felt first time playing the basketball, and you aren't trying to relive it wanting to play it now, lets say, next week.
---
You just like to play basketball, and with its original rules you that used to and enjoy, so you could do 2 steps with a ball not 3. it has nothing to do with anything, rather than wanting to play the game that you enjoy. 
---
what you saying is as ridiculous as if a person came to you and said, listen bro "if you play a basketball now, you wont feel the EXACT same way as 5 years ago. i repeat NEVER feel the EXACT same way like back then playing basketball. these are my thoughts about this,.. That is something that everyone has to admit".
---
Ppl would look at you like you are crazy person. And sorry to say, but this shit is just ridiculous.
---
I still love the garrison, can't understand the hate yet...
---
When the glitch worked, yes. However they patched it on recent private servers so that it no longer works :(
---
Froggy fresh
---
I even remember when I came back for TBC (as a warlock main in vanilla) geeking out over how the pet didn't get dismissed it just got stunned.
---
Yep, I remember. So many shards wasted.
---
Took me five or six months. Rerolled many times around 20/30 to something else before finally sticking with rogue.
---
So, i kind of got to impatient. and desided to try and lvl up ( not to 60 ) a priest, and trying to see how the first few zones are. not taking advantage of any high lvl players to plan my rout for when the new servers hit. ( i found out that human priests dont start with staffs, so walking to Darnassus will take around 40 min to get it at lvl 10 is a must )
---
fingers crossed!
---
Yeah, it got pretty weird there.
---
May 14 or June 25. Can't decide!
---
What happens to the character left behind? Would that originak server then become a stasis server? If so, is your suggestion then that if someone wanted to keep their character on vanilla in perpetuity while also playing tbc that they would have to reroll new on the tbc server? When they discussed this on classiccast the counterpoint they brought up was that this would cause extreme imbalances in faction pop with 80/20 horde leaning as has been seen so far with tbc servers that start fresh. Whereas the continuity of character from vanilla encourages a more even spread.
---
The games now are sub 15 minute bum rushes to the end, usually less than 5 HKs a match most of the time, and anyone that defends is met with animosity because both teams lose if a group defends.  It's the equivalent of holding the final flag in WSG instead of capping it so you can camp the graveyard.
---
The issue isn't player trying to win quickly, that should be the point.  The issue is after the removal of obstacles and crippling of NPCs, players are enabled instead of hindered.
---
This has been my experience on it anyway.
---
We have no idea.
---
Playing horde with my irl friend group. The only other friend going undead in our group is a warlock, and I a warrior. So that's my duo partner, I'm down for the healthstones and tank pet. 
---
We also have a frost mage, priest and hunter. 
---
Agreed. Sometimes knowing your role to accomplish the goals are good enough.
---
why do people want this?  
---
wont this cause that people will literally "finish" the game after like 2 years?   
---
We don‚Äôt know yet. My hopes are that they release new servers after a couple years to feature new expansion, but leave and consolidate Vanilla servers. Then you can pay to transfer characters from vanilla to TBC and onward. You will then always have the option to keep or play characters on Vanilla
---
That is a list of consumables. As the title states, I am not looking for consumables.
---
Some people will.  I have complete confidence that at least a few people have a plan to get ahead of the launch craziness that will actually work.  It has happened every expansion, and classic launch will be no different.
---
Thank you! Even if it does miss stuff it gives me something to go off of. Thank you so much!
---
I have some questions for you:
---
1. Is this your (new) guild or PUG first MC run? I only ask this because how can you possibly full Tier 1 but it being your first MC raid?
---
1.1 Do you mean full Dungeon 1 set - Wildheart Raiment?
---
2. How did you like playing druid in this era of WoW? I'm thinking of rolling a druid come Classic, but haven't really ever played one.
---
Either way, I truly love the trip down nostalgia lane! I'd love to see more screenshots if you have them?
---
Back in November 2004, I happened to get myself suspended from highschool that week. I had my cell phone out in the hallway (checkin the time on the way to the bathroom) when a teacher saw me, wanted to take my phone, and told me I'd get it back at the end of the year. I told him very plainly, "that isn't even mine, that's my dads phone, he pays the bill, and there is no way you are taking that for the next 6 months.". I flat out refused to hand it over. Sure enough, they took the phone and my dad had to come in to get it. 
---
He was way more mad at them than me, mainly because they really acted like I'd get the phone back at the end of the year. As in..... they didn't intend for my father to come in and retrieve it. 
---
This happened on Monday, November 22nd, 2004. They gave me two days out of school suspension, and those two days were November 23rd and 24th. I went to EB Games the next day, bought the game with the (outdated) strategy guide and here I am 15 years later reading about how you intend to take time off of work for Classic.
---
Its a magical thing.
---
this makes me sad.
---
i get that vanilla was nostalgic for us... but i want this to be another big ass 15 years journey... not be "finished" after 2 years...
---
Unlikely. Best case for you is them opening BC servers separately.
---
Both of those are very good comps especially pally hunter dealing with PvP.
---
Loot trading is a big deal tho if they add it to Classic, honestly a huge turn off atleast for me
---
he must meen dungeon set, his head has a bird on it. i guess. But i also thought the same thing :P how can it be hist first mc raid if h is full t1? :P
---
Dungeon Set 1 yes! I have found an old DVD which has loads of old screenshots on this one brought back the memories.
---
Pally + smite priest is actually a lot of holy damage
---
Was it TBC where you rezzed SL locks pets? I remember, as a Priest, that SL locks would sac their pets and If I rezzed them quickly enough you could get them rezzed before they despawned. Never played much lock in vanilla so I don't know much but I do like the Blues kicking ass and telling people how it ACTUALLY was.
---
I work shift work, well I used too. I work in a secure forensic mental hospital. Me and the missus recently had a baby boy so I got work to set shifts on Friday, Saturday and Sunday to meet child care needs as my other half has gone back to uni 9-5 Monday to Friday. (I was extreamly lucky to get them shifts as they are thw most sort after shifts, because more pay) It looks like I'll be very limited to maybe 2 weekdays a week and I'm quite worried about that when it comes to raiding. But fingers crossed I'll come across the right guild with the right days and times for me.
---
Theres so many different things the forums are going to be filled with XX is wrong etc. It will be glorious.
---
I think it'd be cool to have both. Since they are rolling out the game in stages (to simulate the timed released of content prior to 1.12), they could potentially roll-out a pre-nerfed AV in Stage 2 for a few months, then the final nerfed version in the final stage with Naxx.
---
Of course, if they can't quickly reproduce the pre-nerf AV data from what's left in 1.12, then that would never happen.
---
You should care, if you want the best experience possible. I'd rather wait for a completed product.
---
Hey Guys,
---
really want to see a community feeling to this question. It seems many people want the classic servers to remain classic forever.
---
Many want them to progress through the known expansions as it was back in the days.
---
Let me know please :)
---
There was a bug that allowed you to sac the succubus, keep the buff, and have the imp out at the same time. That‚Äôs why they changed it to what it became 
---
If you want to heal go druid. If you to tank dungeons go druid.
---
Well, considering that a Ret paladin is a great easy middle-of-the-road to keep Nightfall procs up with minimal changes to the rest of the raid, I'd take that.
---
No hunter or warrior wants to spam hamstring/wing clip for an entire encounter.
---
Yup and a half dozen of raid instances later of experience.  If you weed out the bad raiders/weak links.  2.5 months is nothing when each previous content is on farm status waiting for a fresh raid
---
Seems excessive to spend 10 straight levels grinding. Cooking is far more useful during leveling for the buffs and no CD on healing. If you want first aid and need to grind it, then that should be the one you do at max level.
---
I‚Äôve literally never encountered an issue while leveling both. If you actually quest, you will kill both types of mobs and be able to level both. It‚Äôs vanilla, sometimes you have to grind. Not that excessively though, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre purposely trying to pigeon hold yourself. First aid doesn‚Äôt take that much cloth, cooking doesn‚Äôt take that much meat. Maybe try a new leveling path, if only for diversity. I go through different routes all the time and still manage cooking on every toon and first aid when I‚Äôm not a tailor or someone with heals.
---
It will be nice to see correct melee DPS numbers once the bosses have the correct Armor and resistance values.
---
I‚Äôll put that up soon, he‚Äôs posted a couple of screenshots here and there in the show‚Äôs discord and here on Reddit but I‚Äôll find out if there‚Äôs an album link
---
Ive played on servers where the underpopulated faction's top guilds enjoyed that aspect. It escapes me now but I recall a few tight knight PvE guilds that would always drop what they were doing to go help each other with world pvp stuff. As a faction we were small, but these guilds were willing to help their members and would flock together to kill off their indifferent enemies.
---
Usually if you queue up for a bg when you login a mage will make a table at the start of it.  It's not 100% but there is a good chance you will have a non asshole mage in the group.
---
I always heard the dungeon sets referred to as tier 0.
---
As someone who recently started playing on a PServer and is loving every minute of it... I hope it turns out these servers got a TON of things wrong. Classic will simply be better if min/maxing and BiS lists are reset, and if an element of discovery and trial and error is injected back into the game. I'm legitimately hoping that we're all in for at least a few surprises, and that some classes/builds/item combinations will be able to shake up the established meta. 
---
Probably the 3000th poll on this. People want tbc no matter how often u poll...
---
Probably 3-4 months... i was a senior in high school.
---
&gt; play ret, min-max like a motherfucker and put the dps'ers who are slacking to shame
---
Play a proper DPS spec, don't even try hard and put try harding rets to shame
---
People think EJ never existed and P server players came up with everything. You and I know it was guilds like EJ, DnT, etc that made almost ALL of the current boss strats.
---
Was I supposed to say something about how everyone playing Vanilla was a noob that never played video games before and were all keyboard turning, mouse clicking retards?
---
But, if shit fire mage dies to fire under them and shaman doesn't, shaman will do more damage.
---
Player Skills &gt; Player Spec
---
Obviously best case scenario is to have a skilled player playing in a superior spec, but unfortunately you're usually stuck with one or the other and if it's between filling a spot or not, may as well.
---
There's alot of players that feel like if the server isn't massive that it's dead. They don't want to wait long periods for bg's to pop or to form groups for the dungeons or not be able to do a quest because no one else is around to help them kill the elite. While it kind of sucks waiting at times it makes getting those events done alot more special. When something is rare it matters. If you can't instantly form a UBRS group it matters more and makes you want to make friends so you can do those things faster.  
---
But being able to instantly do all those things isn't vanilla at all. Vanilla was special because some guy helping you kill an elite going out of his way forged friendships when you finally got it killed after waiting for long periods of time. Pvp wasn't 24/7 non stop at every spot besides TM/SS pre bg's. Running into the opposite faction in the world was more special and remembered the names of people that killed you and wanted revenge. You didn't just see the opposite faction every 3 feet even in STV.  
---
I enjoyed my time on private servers, but what most of those people consider a dead server or unplayable was how vanilla actually was.
---
Kind of is, they released a while back already 
---
no mages make you pay.. they're standing there doing nothing no one gives A F.
---
Some super chill mages on nost would STACK the trade windows multiple times until you said stop please I can't take anymore biscuits!!  
---
The questions leave out the alternative many people want classic to remain classic but allow character copys to a BC server when they are ready to move on after a couple of years. That way they can play on both servers.
---
Did they ask them how they did so well when everyone playing Vanilla was supposed to be keyboard turning, mouse clicking retards?
---
You really dont need a guide
---
make the right combination of traps, pet and shoots while running.
---
practice yourself make duels and go bg's. Skill Bm if you new to game. dont walk bachwards use wing clip and raptor strike on melee.
---
use aspect to detect rogues. 
---
let the enemy run kite them. always make arcane shoots while moving.
---
deploy freezing trap before the fight begins 
---
turn off growl from pet to save focus.
---
collect as much as possible agi to get more damage, crit and dodge,
---
enchant your equip and use
---
Ice Threaded Arrow
---
It should fork.  At some time in the future allow all characters to select a quest in classic, log off and log back in in Burning Crusade; with the character remaining in both worlds.
---
Damn, that's great
---
I never see anyone taking the time to do that
---
Typically questing is the most effective in the 1-20 and 50-60 bracket, while grinding is most effective in the 30-50 bracket which is why I mentioned someone might follow grinding routes in that level range.
---
You left out an option. 3. Only if progression is not forced and I could stay on a frozen Classic realm forever if I wanted
---
Most raids in vanilla didn't really require anywhere near 100% efficiency for everyone that was in there. No private server experience to speak of but back in vanilla when my guild was progressing in Naxx and finishing Aq40 we pretty regularly ran MC/Bwl/Ony/ZG/Aq20 for offpieces, alt gearing etc and filled up half those raids with pugs who could be rocking green or even low level gear. Even in progression we had a Ret pally, I was a druid off tank usually, we had one boomkin that I used my innervate on frequently in a show of class solidarity even though he ran low on mana constantly.  
---
There weren't any real strict requirements on spec even in progression generally, most people wanted to do well and would generally spec in a way that contributes to the raid, but we had every flavor of each class mostly. The only things that 100% don't work are classes like fire mage in MC, or other cases where a spec could not in any way contribute to the raid. Otherwise we were always pretty loose with requirements.  
---
That said I don't think I'll go druid in classic. As much as I loved the class I was spending assloads of gold on respecs at the time between a pvp spec, a healing spec, and a tank/feral spec.
---
Manipulative. I want TBC not cata/WoD
---
I say take it slow, breathe it in. We had retail to do everything, right? Classic is our chance to eat the grass in elwynn forest, peein the snow of dun morogh, to take the candle, to enjoy the game like we once did, instead of trying to get to max level and rush every thing.
---
Honestly with the 1-button hero that mages become, I'd find myself losing focus almost constantly and get myself killed. I think these are the folks we yell at during raid because they were most likely watching Netflix on the other screen and died to the poison on the ground for the 10th time.
---
Hehe :)
---
I don't know, as teenager I played a lot of warcraft 2 and CnC. My base was constanly growing, building by building..
---
sry OT
---
I got to decide until the end of the month but I am not much better off... I will probably bet on July (if the easter egg is anything to go by). If it releases earlier, cool, I can skip sharding, if not, welp I am fucked xD.
---
&gt;Well the risk of recasting is already built in most scenarios simply because of the fact that re-summoning a pet takes 10 seconds.
---
Yeah but on pservers if you get interrupted during those 10 seconds you still have your pet.  In vanilla if you got interrupted you had no pet.  It makes a huge difference.
---
&gt;it‚Äôs just a word forged by people‚Äôs ignorance that was born from what people thought they were hearing
---
You're not wrong, but by the time people learn the correct spelling and pronunciation it's too late. Acceptance of "incorrect" spellings allows a culture to adhere to a single rule on how words are spoken and written. Easily conveying meaning will always trump accuracy of spelling, welcome to human language. I can't imagine how something like this would make you upset.
---
I would go for late summer - from last week of july if it's a month. But why can't you get a boss that doesn't need a super long notice?
---
Furion, my favorite hero in DotA.   
---
Upvote cuz of name.
---
tank=druid
---
heals=pala
---
Stahp. Classic is not even out.
---
Yeah no shit. That one was obvious, even now i member how it changed back in the day.
---
&gt;But the thing you seem to not get is there are two ways to make a hybrid tax. One is the vanilla one, which sucked. The whole idea about a hybrid tax is that they are worse at a single isolated role, but the important part is that they make up for it with extra toolkit from other roles. Vanilla did not do that last part.
---
If you thought hybrid tax in vanilla sucked then you didn't play your class properly. Druid could absolutely be great OT, they could also feral dps if using pots and playing to the fullest potential. Go youtube it, their are videos out for this.
---
&gt;You literally mentioned two of the aboslutely most useless PvP spec of all of TBC. Now you just make up facts yourself to prove your point.
---
This is where I'm honestly questioning if you've played TBC because ret paladins were absolutely strong having mained one in TBC. Very much viable in arenas. Also ret was used in the sunwell raid.
---
&gt; And here you mention two of the top PvP classes in TBC. 
---
Let me elaborate, I've never said warrs or rogues were bad, not once go look at my previous post. I said that when hybrids can pull out good damage why would I play a pure dps class. This is more of a personal thing.
---
&gt;They were not.
---
Lol, they absolutely were the best and most sought after class in arenas. Don't lie, ferals and like you said restokin. All 3 specs had uses in arenas.
---
&gt;One person should not be able to take down a healer. Then what is the point of a PvP healer? If just one dps can kill him.
---
That the dps the healer is healing should protect/coordinate to take down the DPS attacking the healer.
---
That's the thing the hybrid "tax" you like is a homogenization of classes where hybrid can do comparable dps to pure dps classes. This gameplay philosophy is what led to BFA. I much prefer vanilla where hybrids had to utilize all their tools to be potent.
---
Also, how TF did rogue take him longer than..... everyone else? What kind of reverse reality is this?
---
Should have clarified, this is what I meant: It‚Äôs going to be tough to get the linen on alliance, but horde has easy access early via RFC. Linen is the way, no point in relying on greens. Should be doable via linen on horde or alliance though. 
---
On Alliance, it‚Äôs a bit of a catch 22 though. Won‚Äôt be able to afford wand from AH straight up, unless lucky/playing a ton. At that point you may as well group with people and farm humanoids for the cloth to speed you going forward. 
---
Either way wand is a must for casters early. Lesser Magic Wand is super OP
---
Unless I‚Äôm off in my reasoning, which is possible. Feedback welcome. 
---
I used to have that order too but then PvP set in and now I just have a binding system that translates across specs and classes.
---
Basically CC on this binding(s), Racials on these, utility on these, cds on these etc. Muscle memory gets so much easier
---
I don't think Blizzard has a plan for that yet. They will most likely gauge how popular (and profitable) Classic is, and then decide if it is worth the dev hours to convert TBC content to the modern client like how they are doing with Vanilla.
---
Should we maybe just play Classic for a few years and see how well it actually does? If it is a huge success it is just a question of how many years it will take Blizzard to release TBC and then we can tell them to add additional TBC servers where we can copy our classic characters. End of this discussion.
---
Ok
---
No hopefully it stays classic i am not opposed to a separate BC server but classic must stay classic.
---
And I still remember, how I was a level 6ish human warlock, went to that mine in Elwynn for that quest with gold dust and candles, and right next to the entrance, I accidentally clicked "summon imp", and lost the fight because demon despawned...
---
Did you end up listening to the real one too? 
---
Or anyone else reading this -- 
---
what wold be a good timestamp to start at to get the most meat of this podcast in about 45 minutes-ish? I want to listen on my commute home but dont have the full 2 hours+
---
I want to set the record straight that I wasn't trying to be an asshole in my tone of questioning, just curious is all.
---
As I mentioned, I'd love to see more screenshots if you'd be willing to share! My old PC that I had during this time is long gone and I never bothered to save any screenshots from it. 
---
Some people don't want to pretend to be able to peak over the event horizon and into a man's soul because he called someone a mean word over the internet. A.K.A. your average reddit poster.
---
You have people here saying "what more do you need to know about this person?" How hypocritical can you get, you know he got so angry he used what he thought was such a bad word that it matched his feelings. When do we call for the doxxing and firing of this guy? It isn't hyperbolic of me to ask when people are already condemning him.
---
The ironic thing is like many topics the left-leaning side of politics handles, they pass the power over to the right wing. There are boxes that don't open without the leftwing's pressure?
---
 Examples:
---
X race can't be racist against whites because they lack institutional power and privilege, what box does that open? White nationalism and identity politics to the degree that even a democratic presidential nominee is mentioning white birthrate and opioid crisis.
---
This disproportionate response just fuels that type of retreat towards the far-right. The leftwingg elected Donald Trump and can't learn from their mistakes.
---
To bring this all on-topic, I propose for wow that whenever someone starts calling you names, mute them and talk later if it isn't a stranger you care about reconciling.
---
What % of the population will raid, let alone get to 60? It just sounds funny.  I also hear "Oh I'll create an alt for this, an alt for that..." like geez. Are y'all really so prepared to dump a thousand hours into one game...
---
Classic is not about nostalgia, after five minutes at least. If you love warrior, play warrior. What can happen is you getting flashbacks to all the things you have already done on warrior, and long for all the things you didn't do on them other classes. 
---
That's what happened to me when I tried priest on a ps. It was great and all, but turned out that nothing was tryly new, it felt like repetition rather than challenge, so I am rolling a mage instead. What I suggest is you test other classes and see how they feel. Don't count on nostalgia to save you when you burn out at lvl45 on that warrior, that much is certain...
---
I care about 2 things of those:
---
1. when DM releases
---
2. what happens after naxx
---
lol at the thought of someone straight up quitting bc Karazhan, an instance clearly meant for vanilla, being put in the game eventually (talking like 2 years down the road, not at launch).
---
I don't think you read his questions.
---
I crash my orc into a bridge, I DON'T CARE! I love it!
---
I don't have the reference but they've said they want it to be a museum piece project. So unless they change their mind the only option for progression would be sperate servers. I could see them doing tbc with paid transfers from classic if there's money in it. 
---
A while back there was a [similar poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/avd9l9/what_would_you_like_to_be_done_with_the_game_some/) which had the additional option, "More content added in the spirit of vanilla."
---
&gt;  no companies or investors ever aim for stagnation or negative growth  
---
Of course.  But that's *a company wide direction*.  Sometimes you grow something by adding to an existing product, such as retail WoW releasing another expansion.  Sometimes you grow something by adding *a new product*.  There's absolutely no reason to expect that there will be investor presence for "stuff glued to your WoW account must be put mandatorily through a mill of expansions for no reason".  You would have to believe that such an action would gain far more actual subscribers than it would lose.  You would have to believe that such a thing would be worthy of constant developing, running a second MMO (which they've already stated they don't want to do).  
---
A company growing has nothing to do with launching BC on classic servers, man.  There's literally no relation.  
---
&gt; They will want to turn low cost high profit into low cost higher profit.  
---
Of course, so they might say, "what other services can we add that will increase customer retention", where a "customer" is just a dude with a subscription.  Maybe you add an entirely unrelated puzzle game!  
---
Companies and investors work at a level much higher than all this shit.  
---
nuhu, I wann do both! one has to be better than the other for both.
---
Chimly is a legend. Perhaps not as big as the other people we have heard about, but *certainly* good with what he does, and good at explaining himself.

Even if it were possible it still wouldn't be accepted. I'm not sure how much more clear I can be that it's a bad idea.

Was this on Dragonblight EU by any chance?
---
Druid then because it is a good tank, and a decent healer. Paladins are good healers, but bad tanks.
---
Never the ***entire*** duration. Do you realize how much silk and mageweave you would have if you just grinded 30-40 on humanoids? Waaaaaay more than you would need. Like even if you wanted to grind that whole way, tossing in two cooking quests and grinding those beasts for the meat for a couple of levels would produce the same results and speed. Even faster speed actually, because no CD on your healing from the food you're making.
---
Also melee classes like rogue and warrior are shit at grinding and you're better off doing as many quests as possible. It's like you're being contrary just for the sake of it.
---
No, I want to play vanilla not TBC pre patch.
---
This is why I think a more objective view on how game features shape the game should be taken. We know a loooot because of retail, and we can use what we've learned in classic.
---
Dungeon finder = more dungeons but less social player interaction. This is exascerbated by easy dungeons, by dungeons being the fastest leveling, and by heirlooms trivializing the entire concept of gear. We all know this and its pretty unanimous on the board and in-game. 
---
So, instead of framing the conversation with "listen to players..... or don't" I think we should look at each feature (start with the big ones and take things a bit less seriously as we get to the smaller ones like multiple mail items in one post) and ask, "how does this feature affect the game? does it address a problem? does it create problems? can we address the same issue/idea with a different system that doesn't create the problem that the first system did?"
---
Having that conversation over and over again, whether it be between blizzard employees, the community, or any combination, would help a lot more than simple rules.
---
This is the real answer.
---
I started in TBC - what's the big deal about Dire Maul?  Why don't people want it at launch?
---
Ret is equally boring though?
---
Tables? We don‚Äôt have that here
---
Yeah true but I think I would spend most time tanking dungeons if I‚Äôd get a warrior to 60!
---
No. Strictly Vanilla for me. I am not interested in TBC at all. Additions like flying mounts and arenas ruined the game.
---
"Revisiting" my old main, UD rogue. I know it'll be hard to get into groups but luckily my SO is playing a Priest so I hope playing with her will allow me to get into groups better. 
---
We'll see though. 
---
Lesser Magic Wand is good, but it is a level 5 item and unless you're in an organized group dedicated to super rushing wand, you won't be making one until around level 10. (and you for sure won't be able to afford buying one off AH at level 5)
---
The real treat is Greater Magic Wand which is level 13, that stays OP until the 20s.
---
You can accuse the Palain player with no context, but if someone does the same to you we get a stupid comment like your last.
---
You couldn't deflect any harder if we gave you a tennis racket.
---
RAW stats are easy to look up. Proc rates and special effects are all guesswork.
---
here would be no character left behind; original server would become a stasis server. 
---
Yes if someone wantes to play two different characters on 2 different realms, in 2 different expacs, then yes they would have to roll 2 characters. Whether both are originally in classic and one transfers to tbc, or one is created fresh on tbc, 2 chars if you want to play 2 chars.
---
As for the horde/alliance inbalance, yes the tbc servers would be a "fresh" start, with the option to transfer you lvl classic 60 char over on. 
---
If they reallly want horde, they can reroll if they choose, but will enough of the (alliance) community do that to create an imbalance rather than transfer their lvl 60 classic chars? If so, no matter what, you will see an imbalance no matter the options. 
---
Sorry if answers are disjointed - writing this between meetings at work!
---
It isn't my website and also not sure why I got downvoted when their site isn't secured yet takes personal information.
---
I for one do not want to grind out that damn onyx flying drake again.
---
Pserver babies need to fuck off tbh. 95% of them didn't even play retail vanilla.
---
Any excuse to tell pserver players how insignificant their experiences are. 
---
GMW is the one I‚Äôm remembering, thanks! Above poster should shoot for that
---
Swamp of Sorrows 
---
wait what? I only know of the dev panel where they basically said "here's an idea of how we're going to do it, but nothing is final". Is there a bluepost with more or something?
---
&gt;Tyrs Hand
---
Surprisingly Tyr's Hand nor anywhere around Hearthglen were big PvP spots, which I liked because those were my primary farming locations. 
---
Hunter 6-10 is one of the easiest? Bullshit. Try going into a cave as a melee hunter that can't kite a few shots. "Easy" would be a mage or warlock. It's more a pain in the ass than a difficulty. Stutter stepping so you can get another shot or 2 off but you will be in melee and taking a bunch of damage. Good luck doing this with a shitty 1H that does like 3 DPS on a mob with 200HP.
---
That is true however that won't effect much  proc's aren't all that common or have a huge impact besides things on the level of say ironfoe.
---
Out of the 1000‚Äôs of AV runs i did we raised Ivus once.... no regrets..üòä
---
It was!
---
Same, levelled a rogue to 60 on a private server and then classic was announced and then, i thought might as well just wait.
---
Yes, thank you!
---
Yeah well I keep my screenshots on a mix-tape! When you play it out loud and let Amazon Alexa listen to it she commissions a custom print shop (through Amazon) to generate, print, and sell you the screenshot. It shows up by drone 20 minutes later.
---
If it sounds like too much fun or would help you a lot, it‚Äôs probably against some ToS
---
"New" AV is terrible imo. Both teams run right past each other (and everything else) just to race to see who can kill the boss first. The first time I saw both sides just running past each other mounted up made me really sad lol.
---
LFR was dragonsoul, not mop.
---
I can't right now.  I'll check again later.

You can find it faster than me right now, though, as this thread has some direct quotes:

I had the same idea! [https://codepen.io/Jeremiah088/full/ZVdYjb](https://codepen.io/Jeremiah088/full/ZVdYjb) 
---
It will be fucking FULL of people raging about something obscure that they don't remember correctly because they have spammed Private servers for years and blame Classic team for it been wrong when they themselves are wrong 
---
Ok. See you at launch. They fucking told us already there won't be item phases, only dungeon/raid gating.
---
Nice, awesome to hear that these things happen
---
You see a man get closelined on the sidewalk and then called a terrible name before getting kicked in the head.  Then you shortly find out that man just snached a womans purse.
---
Context means everything.  OP could have been calling him names all run and ninjad loot unwarranted.  Just because a screenshot was cherry picked doesn't mean anything.
---
First, thanks for a non-rage reply.
---
The most notable "there is no way this build happened in vanilla" thing that comes to mind is some of the feral druid stuff where you abuse several low level effect items with power shifting to suddenly become a top dps. I give that private server thing a 50/50 shot of actually functioning once the real item effects are implemented in classic. There was a reason the community was surprised/excited that feral was actually viable after the BC updates.
---
Since I‚Äôll be playing alliance rogue, I‚Äôm deciding between dwarf or human. I plan on playing both PVE and PVP equally. Which race is better?
---
Awesome! I remember ErazeR being one of the top guilds on our server. I was just a nobody who didn't even reach level 60 until pretty late in vanilla. Sixsixsix, the druid. Good to see you guys started raiding in dungeon sets, god the game had so many mysteries then!
---
Nope. I don't want to spoil the experience for launch day. 
---
Plus I just can't stand the idea of playing a character that will be deleted. 
---
I'd play it casually. No point getting burned out before launch.
---
&gt;I think it'd be cool to have both.
---
Same, I would love to have multiple options for people, but it won't happen. 
---
I used to play a shadow priest in vanilla, but the thing is, I didn't now how bad it was. I didn't know about optimal debuff slot usage and so on. Eventually I did respec to holy though. I later allowed other shadow priests in the raid (was part of our little guild leadership) and that was utter fail. I cringe to this day, because so much potential was wasted in this process. Today, I am not afraid to pick the best class/spec for the job. Just do it the right way, the easy way, and shine.
---
From the Warlock tank post (something like 26K effective health) I read the other day, this should absolutely still be in too.
---
master of the elements is trash, pretty much useless. hard casting fireball is actually useful.
---
if you backlining in bgs for damage you actually want to cast fireballs, since it'd do more damage, with all the fire talents and crit talent and range talent. in general fireball with fire talents +10% crit) do way more damage than frostbolts spam. you cast it out of sheeps in some situations, when there is no time for pyro. rank1 fireball. etc. generally speaking its fairly useful talent.
---
frostbolt you only cast for slows utility, or with combo into novas. 
---
especially without taking frostbite, it doesnt make sense to go on frostbolts, excluding frieballs. vurtne exludes frostbite, cos he doesn't cast forstbolts for anything rather than utility or combos. he isnt using it as main damage. its scorch and fireball. elemmage is more of firish build with frost utility than anything. you seem to be wanting to do something else.
---
arctic reach is fairly useless aswell.
---
My bad, was on the can.
---
Should progress up to the end of WotLK. Vanilla for 2 years &gt; TBC 2 Years &gt; Wrath 2 Years. Reset after that and do it again. Call them "Seasons" or whatever you want. Make it players choice to stay on the version they want during the season. Can play Vanilla for 6 years if you want. Have non seasonal servers for those who don't want to reset after wrath. Boom.
---
They probably stood in fire etc :p
---
Ok got it now - https://imgur.com/a/Wa5kYVX
---
Do the math. Boomking = 20% less damage. 3% cri = 2% more damage at best. That is 8% damage from your four party members. That equals a net loss of damage of 12%....
---
How much armor do you think bosses should have exactly? Debuff optimisation is really shreds through boss armor in vanilla.
---
How many procs do you think players are running with in vanilla gear?
---
And only if they would merge the remaining servers, otherwise there would be ghost servers.
---
Those aren‚Äôt the only options. It can progress while keeping classic. Character transfers all the way
---
I don't see the big deal about when DM releases. The vast majority of players were not 60 when it was relased in retail in the US. In Europe, it was relased shortly after the launch of WoW
---
If you've got 25 people doing all the work then the fights aren't hard enough (or some people are too geared). Plus, with a sense of community you can see who isn't pulling their weight and try to engage them into taking it more seriously. There's always a way to make it work when we aren't all faceless characters in an ocean of players.
---
Yeah I don't think i could actually be bothered to, i have way to much fun just leveling and chatting with other people on vanilla anyway. Did my first RFC run as a lvl15 warrior last night and man... I had more fun in that half an hour than i have had in wow in the last 3 years, no joke
---
So true. I'm so sick of nochanges begging for things that aren't even vanilla and acting like actual vanilla players were just not good.
---
I think if you include Viper Sting then you should include Mana Drain.
---
Also hunter mark should be included.
---
&gt; If you've got 25 people doing all the work then the fights aren't hard enough 
---
you do realize vanilla raiding....for the most part is not hard?
---
i mean mc is faceroll....BWL not much better...you pretty much need to go to T3 to find a challenge. 
---
No matter how you look at it, the raid encounters need to be made harder. On Nostalrius, we were a pre-raid bis guild who managed to kill Ragnaros before sons, and this should speak for itself. This shouldn't happen for any guild, no matter what, with DM blues or without. 
---
Truth is, DM is only part of the equation, the other part being the 1.12 talents.
---
Really? That changes things... I heard especially shapeshifting just drains your mana. How is healing as a druid in pvp?
---
Mana is easier for a healer than a dps I would say. Make sure you utilize the different ranks of spells (assuming your going healer for instances). If someone needs to be healed for 300 HP, don't use a rank that heals for 500. Use a rank below that, or more if needed to adjust to the necessary HP.
---
[Staff of the Purifier](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=5613) \- you get it from a quest chain in Ashenvale, it dispels 1 poison and 1 disease.
---
I've seen two versions of it on pservers, one with charges and one without - if we get the no charges version in classic it'll be pretty OP. 
---
Addons ruined the TRUE vanilla experience. 
---
Awesome choice mate! What made you specifically choose Priest over the other healers?
---
You took a very popular 14 year old spec and put a lot of thought in just to make it less effective
---
Why would that make you smile? Very sad if you ask me. 
---
Thank you for the quick fill in man! How are holy priests in PvP?
---
&gt;Never the entire duration.
---
Yeah and I never said "do zero quests and grind exactly zero beasts".
---
I just said that someone might have an efficient grinding route based on humanoids and demons. You're taking this VERY literally for some reason and it's weird.
---
That's a really god point. Since I want to focus on gearing towards a tank druid while leveling to 60 while also being able to do some damage to level fast enough, do you think losing the stamina/intellect for bear form is worth the balance talents?
---
I decided on this for now! but i only got hotw and LotP after i've rushed down the balance tree : [https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/druid-talents/?tal=01400530100000005050021323202151050000000000000](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/druid-talents/?tal=01400530100000005050021323202151050000000000000)
---
Also btw what's your UI? i really like the clarity of the bars and the font you use. I appreciate the help
---
But it wasn't. It's not classic, it's not vanilla. A "small" change like that would have huge ripples across the entire game. It would change the feel of the game and how it's played. Seriously, no changes.
---
Yeah.... no. Lots of people paid zero attention to how long leveling took. Sooo many people took over a year to hit 60 and didn't mind it one bit. I played on Cenarion Circle, which was heavily populated, and there was always a good spread of player levels. I didn't hit 60 until right around the release of Naxx, and I didn't even know what endgame was, really. I thought the game was over at 60.
---
You're right to be suspect of peoples play-times. It's like looking back on walking to school and trying to impress people with how quickly you got there when you didn't even time yourself back then. You just lived your life.
---
pretty sure prot paladins can farm lashers as well, although not as quickly obviously
---
I bet i could, but i havnt and wont so its all good, i gave you context, my word isnt good enough compared to obvious racism? this is getting funny now.
---
It was ages ago, i took that ss and i had the backing of 3 other people in the group, the pally was spamming /1 buying boosts for the next week, no one wanted anything to do with him, joy.
---
They should allow free server transfers from any Vanilla server onto a Burning Crusade server when they come out in 2 years. Burning crusade servers stay Burning Crusade for 1-2 years, and then WotLK servers come and the process continues.
---
Idiot retail players on suicide watch. Go back to LFR bud, nobody is saying private servers are 100% accurate and we‚Äôre glad a blue is coming out to set the record straight.
---
yeah, i seem to have a pretty good idea of how the game was in vanilla, i played since launch, and it is actually harder than i thought to differentiate between 14 years ago and 12 years ago, there was so many QoL changes in TBC that i thought was in vanilla. its gonna be a whole new can of worms comming back to me when i play classic again. cant wait!
---
Yeah I've been saying that even before this thread, but I approached the topic all wrong by placing focus on DM as a piece of the pie. I thought about remaking another topic with all three aspects in focus but I'm too lazy.  
---
And .5 
---
Hopefully this subreddit dies, it‚Äôs been invaded by retail players and private server haters for a while now. 
---
Practice your reading comprehension:
---
Sentence 1. "IF turban is out on release..." here he implies that Turban may (or may not) be out.
---
Sentence 2. ".... and shouldn't be out at launch." here he implies that even if it IS it SHOULDN'T be, as in, it would be a mistake to have it available at release.
---
You can't prove him wrong by "seeing him at launch" because he isn't talking about Dire Maul gear being there, he's talking about the mistake of releasing Dire Maul day 1.
---
Good call man, I‚Äôm gonna check that out! Thanks! :D
---
Agree with all except:
---
&gt;You should care about starter zone sharding, when you realize people are still dissapearing in westfall, this is blizzard after all.
---
I'm ok with this for first week only if it will prevent what happened on actual vanilla release.
---
&gt;You should care about what happens after Naxx. You want to be forced into TBC and lose classic, once again?
---
Depends on their plan. If they make some servers progressive and others vanilla only this could be ok. Too early to worry.
---
&gt;You should care about server populations. The world was built for 2-4k players. Not 10k. More population actually means less community, like retail is today, because you will never see the same face twice.
---
I disagree that population (in this case) matters for community. I only have PServers to point to for my argument but as long as there is no sharding we will likely see familiar faces even with giant populations. The issue with retail is we are sharding, not total population. 10k people on a server will still have a strong community although it would be very crowded. Nost had 5K I believe, and that felt just fine. 10k is probably too much but not because of community, because of overall crowding.
---
What concerns me about setting a lower limit (like 2k) is that there is going to be a huge influx of first time players who will realize that retail is more up their ally. So we need to either set a high limit at first or need quick server mergers after the hype dies down.
---
I am definitely remaking my Nelf Warrior and my Human Rogue. I‚Äôd like to try a mage too, but not sure what class. Could maybe be a horde alt. :)
---
A buddy of mine back then was a priest and he always had a billion people asking to group with him, he never had to wait 5 mins to form a group for whatever he wanted to run.... so in short, jealousy 
---
Gonna do a 50/50 with a paladin and hunter. I hope I get time enough to do it. And I dont know what class to main between them. 
---
Just quit now to be safe.
---
No worries, same here! Interesting topic to discuss and I'm glad im not the one who has to decide and take the responsibility for it haha.
---
Thanks for sharing your opinions. I would not be very upset if things happened the way you describe. While I personally like the idea of having basically 3-4 "clones" of my character in different frozen-in-time points like a lvl 60 version in vanilla with all the bells and whistles, then a 70, then maybe even an 80 (I never played WOTLK so perhaps not. I have heard bad things.. lol) I wouldnt mind if we had to choose either or. The reason I would like to keep a copy would be for the memento/keepsake/possibility of playing again much later down the road if I wanted to stop or halt progress for a while and pick back up later on. I really dislike how all of your naxx loot becomes invalidated by greens and blues while leveling :( Blizzard's solution to this was eventually transmog... and I definitely dont want that either haha. Interesting topic for sure.
---
That link is an abomination!
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19110
---
Fixed it for you. 
---
&gt;my word isnt good enough compared to obvious racism?
---
After reading most of your comments on this thread that's going to be a no from me dawg.
---
Not sure how you expected a post like this to be recieved.  "Ret is bad because racist."
---
Difficulty was subjective, as this entire topic is about player cohesion. Some groups find just..... working together at that scale to be a challenge. You don't sound cool by acting like raiding was super easy when it gave hundreds of guilds a hard time getting through the raids.
---
Each raid (at release) was tuned to 40 players having a certain rough gearset so that proper execution was the only way to get through. Coordinating was hard for a looooot of players.
---
World Drops. It's a farm!
---
It'll be like every WoW forum, full of complaints lol.
---
I work in prudhoe and sometimes have to wait for security to run off polar bears. 
---
But what would we do without GEARSCOREEE???
---
I'd prefer it. One of my biggest concerns with classic is getting bored/burned out between content drops. I'm gonna take what I'm given though.
---
Tons of content creation posts, bug reports, questions, world firsts and the inevitable ‚Äòplease make my class viable‚Äô posts.
---
If someone only had 45 minutes to listen to this, which would be the best 45 minutes? Or rather, which is your favorite section -- Is there a particularly juicy block of stories somewhere in the middle? 
---
Or does it jump right into it at the start?
---
I'll listen to the full thing eventually but I have a commute soon and im eager to hear his stories haha
---
Thanks in advance to anyone who has already listened and has tips
---
Gotta be the Horde blimps. Listening to my Priest friends cackle maniacally over Vent while they hurled cows off the edge is still my favorite Vanilla WoW memory - and all I did was stand guard!
---
With that said, I'll be going Horde this time around so I'm sure I'll get the karma I deserve...
---
Thank you for the advice! I think you are right about hotw for ulitility and since i want to be as adaptable as possible while leveling, i think the stat boost from hotw and LOTP is worth more then rushing done balance for damage boost + and Omen of clarity
---
Interesting, we seem to agree on more points then I thought. :-)
---
I think the problem with TBC and WotLK ist that these addons don't have the staying power of vanilla. Neglecting the power creep of AQ/Naxx items - which most people didn't have during vanilla - the vanilla content stayed relevant for the full duration. I did run, and enjoy, all end game dungeons for the whole two years. Sometimes for fun, sometimes for the rare chance at a mount or Briarwood Reed. The game did have this "sandbox lure" of always something to do, but nothing that must be done.
---
This changed with TBC.
---
 - There was the daily heroic you had to do. Exactly one per day. Until you bought everything from the vendor, then you didn't run them again on this char.
---
 - Raids were made easier or even no longer required to progress to the next one.
---
 - Heroic drops and items were made obsolete by the next batch of badge items.
---
 - Grinds, like the Netherdrake, were completed and you never visited them again.
---
TBC already was drop fed content and if they will ever release a TBC server it will have a hard timer on it.
---
Vanilla was fun driven.
---
TBC/WotLK was reward driven.
---
Rofl always wondered what that trinket was, thanks for the tip lol
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=1404
---
Thats extremly strong for warrior or rogue!
---
If you happen to get debuffed with a disease that removes health regenaration or lowers stats and goes for 30min ... 
---
Did you know the questing routes before hand? If you went in blind it would be a lot faster for the second, third, etc, class assuming same starting area. You should add the order and starting area.
---
Server population caps.
---
Whether or not there will be cross realm battlegrounds.
---
Defend racism all you want, dawg.
---
Post wasnt ret is bad because racsists, it was "i cant wait for classic drama".
---
Plenty of people jumping on human pallys, relax, its a joke... untill some one loses it completely.
---
Works on an oil drilling rig most likely. Roughneck is the industry term for the entry-level position.
---
Meaning when something breaks they get to do the heavy lifting.
---
Interesting. The free points from Elemental Precision are really where I've been thinking about effectiveness - and they were being wasted there (I assume he put them there thinking with added resistances on people's gear he would be getting less partial resists.) So your less effective comment makes more sense as it applies to Imp. Fireball, as that's the only other change. My post was an open invitation to discussion so please do elaborate! Is hardcasting fireball what you were disagreeing with?
---
I‚Äôm currently trying to decide between Mage and Warlock, but if I go mage I will be happy to share my food for donations. 
---
because its gear is better than most other dungeon pieces of gear
---
&gt;Server population caps.
---
we didn't know that back then either
---
I'm sure some people will reach a point where they feel the journey is complete, if you're in that bucket that's fine.  Others want the game to remain unchanged.
---
There's a lot of benefit to not changing it.  I boot up Diablo 2 sometimes not to read the patch notes (well duhh lol), but because I know exactly what to expect and I know I already love the game.
---
On the flip side, DotA 2 was my jam for many years.  After so many changes I think it has completely lost what it originally had that made me enjoy it.  If it was left alone I'd still play.
---
BETUH
---
I'm interested
---
Let's just focus on getting Vanilla correct first, alright?
---
Wa yu talmbout boi
---
Rolled a shammy as my main and I plan on doing that again, along with playing a mage. Figured I would level him when I get bored healing on my shammy and get it to 60 as well. 
---
I agree that most players won't notice a difference, but that is because they are not seeking out the perfect private server optimized build that takes advantage of items that were not commonly used in vanilla. These builds will seek out the occasional low level item with some sort of effect that IF the private server guessed correctly on how it behaves creates large dps gains. 
---
My comment was to suggest that there are plenty of spots where these optimized interactions might not match the real original data, thus breaking the presumed optimization. 
---
Please do this more often
---
Removed per rule 1 and 7. 
---
Really struggling between priest and paladin..
---
Love the sturdiness of paladins in pvp but priests have so many great abilities like offensive dispel, mind control, pws, and more offensive options with mind blast, pws, psychic scream
---
In pve i see paladins often topping the healing meters over priests which I always like to do. However, I'd like to be able to wear my tier sets and I've heard paladins can't do that since most BIS is cloth/leather.
---
For alliance vs horde, will one faction in particular want priests more strongly? 
---
Talk about somethin thats free. Toss them buffs, as a priest I buff everyone i run by. I love seeing someone drop to 60% life when i hit em with a stam buff.
---
Even if we aren't given an official answer it should be possible to gather census data and determine the cap.
---
Removed per rule 7. This is a very commonly asked questions. 
---
Verily, I shall.
---
Actually yes, I want the Blue Dragon trinket for my Resto Druid.  I used Twisting Nether for world PvP all the way through TBC.
---
They're all niche but are all very good imo.
---
The problem is the majority of players dont voice they're opinions they simply unsub. 
---
I had very similar - with the exception of shadowmeld instead of tranquility, tranqulity was somewhere on the bar above.
---
And there was no innervate on my bar - I don'T remember what was instead of it, insect swarm?
---
because i love seeing people who have different opinions than me be upset *ha ha haaaaaaaaaaaaah* ^im not a psychopath
---
LOL.  Old models weren't "realistic", they were just low enough poly you had to fill in the blanks with your imagination.
---
LOL that entire screen filled with the mainbar... brings memories
---
I think it will likely be in the game since it is a UI component of the modern client. I don't have a problem with it because there were already addons during Vanilla that let gave you an in-game calendar that allowed you share events with other players.
---
how do you check your characters guild history?
---
I spoke to one of the original devs on stream for a classic and he said the original population caps were around 2,500 to 3000 and that was a design choice
---
Good the more details they nail down the better.
---
Yes I should have known better than to read this parroted waste.
---
I can still have an opinion on your "thoughts" and that opinion is that they are worthless.
---
Prepare to be disappointed. Besides, who is to say classic doesn't get a lot of things wrong? Having the data is one thing, but blizz devs are using a different client and backend, they'll make a lot of mistake.
---
Something new
---
I was a hunter. Will be a Druid on the opposite Faction 
---
I think this just goes to show how much work/information they still have to share and get ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù on.
---
Still sad that they keep saying they want our feedback but are not really giving direction or communication on what/where they want it.
---
All in all they said soon not ‚Äúsoon tm‚Äù yet there is sooo much info needed I still will be surprised to see a release before the end of September.
---
Just thoughts of course still trying to remain positive.
---
*Ay! Any-ya'll dumb fucks play computer games? I'ma start playing WOW agin this summer! Now hurry up with the goddamn drill string and get yer fuckin' roustabout thumbs outta yer ass!*
---
"I don't trust Blizzard to make the game exactly the way *I* want it, because everyone else is wrong and *my* demands are the only ones that matter!"
---
I'm with you, man.
---
DM release is irrelevant to me. I don't intend to no-life to 60 ASAP and rush to clear 15 year old content. I'll take my time and enjoy the grind. Maybe I'll PuG MC when I get to 60.
---
I don't care about itemization making MC easier for the same reason.
---
I don't care about spell batching because I literally don't even know what is and I've been playing since 2004.
---
It's great that people are giving feedback on the minutia to try and make it as authentic an experience as possible, but the minutia isn't gonna stress me out. Nor, I think, will is stress out a lot of people. It's the GOGOGO rush to 60 and clear content ASAP crowd that care the most.
---
Probably will have to do that, yeah.
---
I mained a warlock back in vanilla. I tried warrior tanking some time later in the game's life and loved it so this time I'm going to hopefully MT a lot of stuff! 
---
Been waiting two years haha Honestly as long as the questing, dungeons and PvP feels the same I'll be playing it with friends fairly casually. 
---
As long as the core is there the game will generally feel the same and really that's all we can hope for.
---
better than MC or BWL tho?
---
I would like to know what version of Alterac valley will be used. I hope there will still be those summonable giants etc.
---
6 months of Naxx is to short?
---
I didnt say they **were** realistic i said they were attempting to portray realistic with very old graphics.
---
Well there was always an official world chat /5 you just had to opt into it at login
---
Full stack of greater mana potions at level 60, oof. 
---
Roughnecks are usually Senior Roustabouts.
---
Both should say Ret. 
---
I‚Äôm not talking about what random people are saying I‚Äôm looking for something from blizzard
---
Probably how every gaming subreddit ends up: Streamer worshipping.
---
Started March 9th 2005 and hit 60 at the end of June. So almost 4 months lol 
---
Dual boxing is not against the Blizzard TOS.  They don't care, if you're willing to pay $15 a month for each account you can open as many accounts as you want.  
---
There will be a lot of "hardcore" players dual boxing to level to 60, and then they can move characters over with character transfer from the shop.  (If the shop is available)
---
So search it up.  The "random people" didn't just make it up.  
---
When I have real internet later I'll see if I can find it.  Until then, YOU can find it.
---
And that is not a big deal, unless you are in the top tier guilds. Very few people perform optimal.
---
The caster neck for token turn in is prebis for mages( i think warlock get smth else).
---
The beast card is amazing on druid and priest.
---
Rest is kinda meh.
---
Unfortunately you are still looking at this as they won‚Äôt ever see room for more profit out of this... it‚Äôs a public company. If they see it do well they will want to explore expanding upon that. That is how company growth works
---
Took me about 30 days played as a NE warrior, first main. Rolled a troll hunter on Shattered Hand and got to 60 in like 18 days or something like that.  
---
You diddnt pay for Overwatch beta aswell and it was a open one. So millions played it for free.
---
You presented a salty human paladin because you're witch hunting and ret sucks because they're racist.  I understand your post.
---
Well, ofc the whole nostalgia theme, comparisons from the past to today, comparisons between pserver and classic, a ton of memes.  
---
And once everything cools down a bit, I'm pretty sure a lot of complaints will arise. Balance isn't a huge thing in classic, and depending on the community, it'll be rough for a lot of specs. It's funny because even small buffs here and there would go a long way.  
---
Off the top of my hat, curse of elements should include nature damage for our elemental shamans and wrath spamming oomkins.  
---
On the topic off Oom, slight adjustments for the mana costs of hybrids would be great.  
---
Those 2 alone would help a lot.  
---
Also, even those 2 things would change, especially in later content stages, it wouldn't be enough, as their support doesn't outweigh their lack of dps, so it might need some further adjustments.  
---
Taunt for paladin would be cool, but quite a huge change, as well as some sort of caster support from elemental shamans, which are inferior to restoration shamans in every way, as they don't provide anything (spell power totem anyone ?)  
---
With those, I think most stuff would be allright.   
---
STOP CONFLATING "COMPANY GROWTH" WITH "PRODUCT CHANGES"!!!!  
---
There's zero correlation.  Companies need to invest dollars to create revenue streams.  That doesn't mean they need to ruin classic WoW because you somehow think that will make them more money.  They can invest that money in making, oh, I dunno, more fucking mobile games.  All classic WoW needs to do is be a net positive to them, which it obviously will be with 0 development costs after launch.
---
Or a rumor with nothing to back it up? Or since your the one saying it‚Äôs so readily available YOU can defend your point and bring proof of this. Everything I have seen has not had any information on that whatsoever. Please defend the information your bringing since my point is that it is not out there it doesn‚Äôt make sense to have me attempt to find information that I don‚Äôt believe exists. Since you have clearly seen blizzard state this defend that statement
---
Bag.
---
That's it.
---
Regarding #2, I'd love for them to separate servers by language more than just English, French &amp; German for EU servers. Despite being designated English, the realm i played through Vanilla, TBC &amp; WotLK was a constant battle between the Danish, and the Italians in trade chat.
---
There is when the only other direction is a lose in subscriptions... that would equal a negative correlation
---
Current boss strats? There are multiple says to do each boss and the game is 14 years old. It isnt like people would still be progressing on Magmadar without them.
---
A lot of pserver players don't feel that way. In other threads, there is a lot of shitting on Blizzard for shipping a game that will *gasp* diverge from the frankenpatches pservers were running.
---
This is where I was really glad I picked up First Aid and Cooking early on in despite my friends telling me I was just wasting time when I could be doing more quests.
---
They didn't find it so funny when I kept slaying my way though though all the mobs in the quest zone before they could catch up.
---
Hunter is a lot of fun in both PvE and PvP, love the class.
---
Yeah the fact that Blizzard literally STOPPED RELEASING THE NUMBERS after it went downhill for the 4th xpac in a row is all we need to know lol.
---
To be fair, I disagree with the pserver crowd on a lot of things but I genuinely remember STV being a bloodbath in vanilla.
---
I played on a high pop pvp server and it was pretty much impossible to do the nesingwary quests, and if you somehow managed to finish them you had to find a way to turn it in with several horde all gathered around the camp.
---
It definitely varied by server back then but just like Barrens chat, I always thought the STV experience was pretty universal.
---
This already looks like you had barely 20 FPS. 
---
GLORIOUS.
---
 Befriend a mage...  very early on. Like starting zone early.
---
Call lists for green dragons. I could hear guildies with their phones in their pockets telling their bosses they were suddenly ill. Then pick up the phone laugh and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be home in 15 minutes.‚Äù That was the good old days.
---
This man gets it. All issues will fade once that cinematic plays and we click 'Enter World'.
---
Not to say these aren't issues, I'm just saying he's right. The high will be next-level.
---
Got 8/8 Arcanist in one run. Every piece dropped and no other mage there needed it. Took me from mostly Magister's to T1 for minimal DKP.  
---
After we got out of MC, the mage class leader, one other mage, and I went and queued up for AV and proceeded to wreck some horde scum. That was a good night.
---
I agree.  I meant that to come across as a sarcastic joke, poking fun at all of us for "misremembering" things, but it didn't really land.
---
They won't come to that conclusion.  There will always be people who want to play classic, and they've already promised there will be classic servers as long as there are WoW servers.
---
Once ret, never change spec
---
I played mage in vanilla, once I discovered dungeons though I quickly realized they were my favorite part of the game, and ended up rolling a priest and having a lot more fun healing than DPS. As nice as mage quality of life is, I find other classes more fun in group content
---
&gt; YOU can defend your point  
---
I FUCKING CANNOT GOOGLE SHIT PROPERLY RIGHT NOW AND I TOLD YOU THAT  
---
I fucking remember it being said, the thread is evidence of people discussing it, if you need the source right the fuck now you can google it your goddamned self and edit your earlier post with it, otherwise shut your entitled face and I'll find the goddamned quote myself later.
---
I mean some are solid changes like mob movement. In vanilla and PS, you can exploit it and backstab units without being behind them. Everyone does it in PS servers as druids/rogues for powerleveling but its a blatant abuse.
---
why cant you use comms when your s/o is home? 
---
Honestly, it is those who havent played private servers that are too emotional about the fact they think private server players have the perfect recreation of vanilla. People who actually played on private servers know this isn‚Äôt the case.
---
Still, those who missed out on those replicas feel the need to lash out so they don‚Äôt feel sad about not having enjoyed the same experience.
---
Classic WoW is coming and both sides will enjoy themselves. I dont care if classic isnt 100% match to the private server experience. It doesnt bother me sorry to dissappoint, but for some reason it hothers you that players have enjoyed private servers for years. That is just a weird.
---
Did they state no to those specifically?
---
Those were introduced in Wrath, and should probably not even exist. Stupidly overpowered gear
---
The three important points are long leveling, players having strengths and weaknesses, and a big world to explore (Which is not the same thing as unbeaten content).
---
The reason that fifty million people player Vanilla was not because they were excited to eventually farm Naxx for weeks on end. It was because there was a big, seamless, magical world to explore.
---
Yeah that makes more sense lol, my bad.
---
A druid must always be coupled with a priest or paladin in a group so you have a reliable rez. Feral druids also just aren't very good healers in harder max-level dungeons like UD Strat. They don't have the talent to reduce healing agro so on big packs either they die or the tank dies.
---
Bottom line, if you insist on tanking and healing with one spec you will always need an off-healer or an off-tank in group to make up for your deficiencies.
---
Yes, druids have less options as tanks compared to warriors. The ressurection druids have has a 30 min cd. It can be used in and out of combat.
---
I guess I'd like BC even more, unless they fix the balance issues in Classic, which they probably won't because #NoChange seemingly thinks that lack of balance and diversity in class / spec choices is an integral part of the vanilla experience, despite everyone and their mom complained back in the day about it, but classic purists kinda forgot about that I guess.  
---
Or they were affected by that in the past, former shaman and paladin players, now rolling mages, rogues and warriors, seeking revenge for their former torment, watching others struggle in classic for deep satisfaction ?
---
https://gfycat.com/bitesizedinfantiledingo
---
So it would be a definitive no then? Even in current, I just view it as a booster QOL item/items.
---
They‚Äôre immune to polymorph not mind control.
---
I didnt know about TCG as a kid and likely didn't have access anyway. Now as an adult, if blizz re released wow collector cards for vanilla with sweet artworks, id 100% buy the wholeeeee lot.
---
Please update me with your results
---
Watch the blizzcon panels. The fact you're asking the question shows you haven't done your research on what Classic will be. It completely goes without saying there will be no heirlooms, no transmog, no lfg raids, no free respecs etc.
---
Hey that was my server, too. :) PvE right ?
---
Heirlooms helped break the game.
---
It will definitely not be in Classic Vanilla or Classic TBC
---
Tbf Gearscore mostly became a thing because of the way they began designing gear, the reason it's not used on Vanilla servers is pretty clear, you can't measure an item's quality by its Ilvl or rarity.
---
If you like the dark aspect of warlock, maybe you would like the dark aspect of rogue.
---
Im not even a big no changer but i hate heirlooms.
---
&gt;The majority of the player base are socially inept morons.
---
No the vast vast majority of people don't know what they actually want nor do they understand what they think is cool will do to the game. 
---
The only time you need to be social in pre LFD-LFR wow is if you're on a low pop server, otherwise its very easy to see pretty well all the content without doing much more than saying whats up. 
---
Private servers really brought this point home for me. There's a mix between mechanics designed to get players to meet up and player count. The majority of PUG and groups I joined almost no one talked or joked other than to make sure people knew how to do the activity. 
---
Just because Classic WoW will have some differences from private servers doesn't mean people who come from private servers will be mega pissed.  I don't see that as a natural logical connection.  A person who loves Vanilla WoW enough to play on a private server should just be super pumped about WoW classic, differences and all.  There will be a few trolls who would complain no matter what, but I think "you people" is a gross overestimation of the unhappy ones.
---
They really weren't, though.  The entire Warcraft series has always been very cartooney.
---
[This dude's forearms are a bigger diameter than his head.](http://i.imgur.com/NINla.jpg)  Even Hafthor Bjornsson, the huge Icelandic weightlifter who played The Mountain in GoT and has set world records for lifting, has forearms significantly smaller than his head.
---
The human women in WoW have ridiculously long legs; their hips are 2/3 of the way up while actual women's hips are about midway between the top of their head and the bottom of their feet.
---
Both sexes' faces sit too high on their heads.  Normal people's eyes generally sit roughly halfway up their head, but in WoW, they are higher, with their nose in the middle.
---
I personally like the Warlock with the digimon reference name. Soooo 2005.
---
This issue literally only exists for about 6 hours on brand new servers. Yes a wand is nice but you can still level completely fine without one for a day, and after the first day there will always be plenty to buy on the ah for 20-30s. It's a complete non issue for anyone but server first rushers (of which all will be hunters anyway).
---
lol never that bad, we just got super drunk all the time. Once made our whole guild play by the tank rules in Karazhan. 
---
1. Down a boss, down your drink.
---
2. Lose threat to a dps, down your drink.
---
3. Raid wipes, down your drink.
---
4. Healers die, down your drink.
---
5. Lose threat to another tank, down your drink and take a dare from the tank that beat you.
---
We ended up replacing quite a few raid members, for one of them his GF came on ventrilo to tell us "He's facedown in the bathroom and cannot continue". Good times, good times.
---
1)  yeah, Bear form just doesn't have the number of options that Warriors do. There are more down the line, though, and once you have better gear survivability increases. They can still be a viable tank and, but it will be a bit harder.
---
2) Druids have a 30min cooldown in combat rez. They do not have the standard out of combat only rez that has no cooldown like Shamans and Priests have.
---
Is there a way to get tickets using Tailoring?
---
The blue dragonncard isbsuper good for healers
---
Darkmoon card maelstrom on shamans is super nice to have
---
Mekee, assuming dmf is available in stage 1, the amulet of the darkmoon is really damn strong.
---
The orb of the darkmoon likewise is also really good too for those looking for spellpower. Both amulets cost 1200 dmf tickets so will require some grinding but are 100%  acheivabke solo with enough commitment.
---
Heirloom gear was added to help players skip outdated and abandoned content so they could jump into the current expansion's content quickly.
---
Vanilla WoW is just as much about the journey to 60 as it is the content at 60. Adding heirloom gear would dilute the experience.
---
I feel the same. I just want to play the game. I just hope its an early summer release date.
---
I think you have to consider classic in a more stand alone way.  I mean when the game first came out there was little/no 'end game' like there is now, leveling was the game.  Enjoy that rather than try to burn through it.
---
Thank you all! Since it‚Äôs a no, I can look forward to learning how to play each class with time, instead of powerleveling/rushed. Current I didn‚Äôt like much, but my friend had me try a private server of classic to get me into it, and that I really enjoyed.
---
Not that I am aware of but honestly either way you should really just use the cheapest and get a guildie to craft if needed, which is typically thorium widgets. 
---
Thank you (: I will!
---
Almost all heirloom gear is re-created raid gear from classic.
---
In short NO. 
---
AV is my favorite battleground and favorite place to mess around in the game.  I hope Blizzard takes the time to reconstruct AV the way it was originally.  
---
Blue items that scale with level AND grant a sizable xp boost? No. 
---
If they were white text items that gave an xp boost (that didnt apply to quests and didnt stack with rested) sure.
---
Should? Or "can"? Cuz it "should" be free, as the mage loses nothing expect the 10sec to cast it. 'tis all about community. 
---
You can't.
---
Huge salt mine.  It'll be hilarious, people will be bitching about literally everything, no matter how inconsequential.
---
I could, but I'd like not to. We live in a small apt and tend to do things together more often than we do our own things separately. While I do sometimes grind out a level or something during netflix, I don't like to be tuned entirely into what I'm doing on WoW during that time and will have the volume off. If the wife finally gives in and tries to make gaming a hobby she enjoys, then sure, but it's not likely to happen and so she will come first when we're at home together!
---
That makes sense, thank you for the reply and explanation!
---
System requirements. Yeah i know they should be the same like in BfA. But can't be 100% sure.
---
Fatality. 
---
I don't have enough time to level up two but I'll be doing it anyways, L 60 in 6 months you'll see heheh
---
fair enough I was just curious, i hope you find some thing in game that works for you! There will be hardcore people in the population, but i think most people are going to be in the same boat as you with a family and responsibilities now. 
---
I believe you. !Remind me 6 months
---
Sounds about right. Mark Kern said the upper limit was 4k but that they normally started queuing players before then.
---
A boomkin in vanilla?  
---
Wait that¬¥s illegal!
---
Who cares about time! Which class did you have the most fun with?!
---
Why did you roll on the most populated one then?  Each pserver platform has multiple servers, just pick the older (and thus less populated) one.  /boggle
---
&gt;create a realistic model using **really old graphics**.
---
If filling things in with imagination works to help make a model more realistic then how do you think that wasn't the intended purpose..
---
Okay, thank you! I‚Äôm glad to hear it personally. I didn‚Äôt like blowing from 1-120 in a few hours.
---
Regarding #21 I believe that JAB (among others) said that once they support Classic WoW they do it fully, just like they support any other game that they run.
---
Which is why Starcraft Brood War recently got a HD remake and Diablo II still has active ladders.
---
Full tier 1? Or tier .5 is what it looks like.
---
Basically all this comment tells me is you have very little shaman experience. I didn't say Orcs were worse the Tauren as a race. They are just worse for shamans. The spell you get off effects also have consequences. 
---
Elemental shamans are extremely gear dependant. In pvp they rely on extreme burst to win match ups. That 1 spell war stomp gets you can be a game breaking heal. Or a life stopping lighting strike. The controlled timing of when you use it. Makes it 1000% better then an unpredictable stun resist. A stun resist you don't really need to beat a rogue. Stune resist for shamans is a win more racial. War stomp is a game breaking racial for ele shamans theyvarent even in the same ball park. 
---
Looking for EU guild. Started WoW with classic closed beta and stopped playing before Wotlk. Cleared all content but not looking for a hardcore guild as I am working. Looking forward to hearing from you!
---
Where do you get that idea about pserver people?  That sounds like a huge generalization and is not consistent with any of my experiences.  You don't think a few trolls represent the entire pserver population do you?
---
So it's just the 30min CD that makes druids less optimal healers in dungeons then? Just for the case when some subset of the group dies and then does it again &lt;30 mins later?
---
Yeah, it sure ain't the case. 
---
I shot a lion. That lion ran at me, took a right turn, ran around, and found his way to me eventually. 
---
Ah, a worthy opponent has made himself known. May the best man (men?) secure the kill ;)
---
Looks like I'm going Tauren! I don't care about PvE as much, and I want to play Elemental, so Tauren it is!
---
Dont you only need to get to 53? so that evasion/deterrance puts you at 103% instead of 113?
---
No RP servers.
---
That is correct. T1 is MC and T0 is the blue dungeon set. OP got it wrong but we forgive him.
---
I haven't really considered twinking at all, but I may have to. Now that I think about it, it sounds pretty fun. I remember twinking a rogue back in the day in the 10-19 bracket like everyone else did at some point and it was pretty entertaining
---
Well, regardless of the engine, it's old models and textures.
---
But, 40man raids use more resources than 30man. And, non-sharded Silithus with AQ event ongoing...
---
well, I'd say that, even though the official minimal requirements may be lower, the real ones to run smoothly may be even higher than BfA.
---
but afaik, the real ones have never been officially announced
---
Hey I love [Shedothedruid](https://m.twitch.tv/shedothedruid/profile) too, but it‚Äôs devastating when he has to leave the raid when he accidentally dies once and loses all his world buffs, etc. 
---
&gt; why Starcraft Brood War recently got a HD remake and Diablo II still has active ladders
---
Warcraft 3 just got a HD update and is getting remaster too.
---
Doesn't mean that it has the same amount of support, as WOW or Overwatch.
---
First of all even with Manual Crowd Pummeler ferals are not top dps, second it does actually work even in retail vanilla hence why they are [comments](http://web.archive.org/web/20070523080845/http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=9449) from actual druids saying how awesome this weapon for ferals. 
---
Just because you didn't know about it doesn't mean it didn't exist.
---
If they add a cash shop then I am out.
---
Really? he has to leave the raid when he dies and looses all buffs?
---
I am itching to play so bad i bought a new MMO mouse for it. Just waiting the day now. 
---
McDonalds Paladin
---
And remove gnomes
---
Lmao just play a classic server Atlantiss Netherwing has 5k ppl, PLEASE roll alliance though the faction imbalance is sizable 
---
&gt; We ended up replacing quite a few raid members, for one of them his GF came on ventrilo to tell us "He's facedown in the bathroom and cannot continue". 
---
wiat, so you were replacing, and teaching new members the drinking rules?
---
Damn, now I want to drunk-heal and drunk-tank some dungeons and raids. Funny thing I've noticed, I perform better in Dark Souls after 1 or 2 beers, than completely sober.
---
Never. That would mean there would be nothing to stomp
---
it's a game lol
---
&gt; Despite being designated English, the realm i played through Vanilla, TBC &amp; WotLK was a constant battle between the Danish, and the Italians in trade chat.
---
Good for you, mine was Dutch.
---
By the way, can I know which realm was that? Danish does sound good.
---
For a warrior you are right it's not. For a shaman. That 2 second window is life. It's game breaking for this class specifically. You can get off a 2k+  heal. This is essential for beating high geared melee. For casters it let's you womp womp out that chain lighting. At high gear play again it's essential for winning the burst war.
---
Unless you plan on main speccing enhancement. Tauren is by far the best call. It's not even a debate. Orc ele/resto shammy are just gimped. 
---
Read my reply to the other guy.
---
You are in for some rough times.... Together with goblin helmet and skull, this is the most broken pvp item and people are well aware of that. My guess is that the naga will be camped 24/7 until the end of the days.
---
Not sure tbh. I haven't played a holy priest personally, but I know a fair bit about them because my friend was one. We never did pvp though.
---
added to the post
---
BTW, I think AV has always had summonable things, and still has them, just they aren't that important once Blizzard introduced reinforcements.
---
üíÄüíÄüíÄ
---
no, but makes it easier to down MC and BWL.
---
Maelstrom card on rogues and feral druids is very strong. As a rogue with 8/8 T2, MSA, fiery weapon / unholy weapon enchants and this trinket, you will have a proc party that bursts hard in pvp.
---
Yea i'd love my riding turtle &lt;3
---
&gt; Still sad that they keep saying they want our feedback but are not really giving direction or communication on what/where they want it.
---
&gt; 
---
... or any beta.
---
I have tried and tried to decide on playing something different, but  everytime I say I will play a priest, or maybe an Elemental Shaman for  PvPsplosions, a day later I go back to my plan of just rolling another  warrior. I loved vanilla tanking (and TBC). I have come to the  realisation that I will just be a warrior.
---
Though this time around I don't think I'll level sword and board from  1-60... or maybe I will, just for a while, to recreate a little more of  my vanilla experience.
---
This is all true. That being said I'm on the side that prefers 4-5k with dynamic spawns. I'm also not in #nochanges though. 
---
I specifically remember that channeled spells have a priority above 0, which was implemented in the patch that brought the debuff priority system and covered all channeled spells. I played a warlock in vanilla retail and I remember the day when we could finally use Drain Soul during raids to get shards back, before which it had been just about impossible because the channel would get knocked off immediately by the constant shuffling of deep wounds and fireball dots. So while I'm not 100% sure which exact priority level Mind Flay has, it's something above 0 and therefore will conflict with useful debuffs. Raids will typically use stuff like Annihilator to boost raid DPS. If you have to make room for a shadow priest's rotation, you need to give up debuffs that contribute far more DPS than the priest does, which is why modern guilds don't do it. In fact, guilds that care about performance and competitive progression don't run a shadow priest at all, they just get one of the healing priests to spec into Shadow Embrace and keep it up with some rank 1 spell.
---
We had to keep replacing members, they kept passing out/getting to drunk to even play. Tanks were fine, we played these games every week. We had enough players online to keep the rotation going, and the word had already spread as to why we kept needing new people. &gt;:)
---
Furion was also the original name for Malfurion Stormrage. At least, that's what he was called in WC3, which I imagine is why the name is in DotA.
---
Loses nothing? Isn't there a relatively expensive material cost for the mage?
---
Only level 47 I made it to, was in Middle school. Cant remember my /played but it had to of been over 10 days played. I had the character for at least 1 year irl.
---
I would literally just wPvP over anything else, and chase that next purple item.
---
100 % this. I honestly feel that this has the absolute lowest chance of happening out of all the main ‚ÄúWorries‚Äù out there about changes. 
---
I honestly expect history to repeat itself and casuals who shouldn't be playing the MMORPG genre to whine endlessly about MMO and RPG features until they're nerfed/gutted/removed.
---
Deep down in your heart you know what you like most. Follow your feelings and you will not make the wrong choice!
---
Dragonblight PVE server, me and about 8 of my school mates used to play and just spent every minute talking about it in break times.
---
At level 49 it HotW accounted for about 300 HP. You will be fine.
---
Make a guild called &lt;Pug Lords&gt; filled with people who can't dedicate themselves to a solid schedule but are still around to fill in from time to time. This guild would be the dedicated pug guild that all other guilds seek players from first to fill out the rest of their roster.
---
 The players from this guild may be seen as "randoms" initially, but their belonging to an organization makes them slightly less random.
---
Ive been wondering what the two best classes would be for this as well together. Especially one to go with mage.
---
Aside the obvious "qol" features, you know what would make me immediately lose all interest in classic?
---
&gt;patch 2.01, all classic servers will be progressing to TBC content
---
Not to ask a dumb question, but it looks like you have your spells bound to 1,2,3,4 etc. 
---
Are those not keybinds?
---
Blizzard is just going to rerelease all the wow expansions in the regular time line. They're set for like another 12 years with zero effort.
---
Everyone always talks about leveling using cat form, but I use bear form.  Perhaps it is like the tortoise and the hare fable.  Slow and steady.  The durability of bear form keeps you alive long enough for your mana to regen, so when you shift out you can HoT up and pull mobs immediately. 
---
Maelstrom on Ret paladin is amazing! scales with spellpower
---
Druid can heal themselves!....... and get stuck with only healing at level 60 ! yay!
---
Tier 0*. Still cool that you have those old screenshots!
---
Doing the Hunter quest for the Lhok/Rhok'Delar forsure.
---
I was in a kind of noob guild and we were relatively undergeared. No one in my guild was able to complete the quest themselves, they were actually paying a hunter from one of the premium raiding guilds to do the quest for them.
---
I told them I was going to do it myself, this was met with doubt by my other guild members.
---
I was able to complete it all myself, i felt like such a badass. I barely beat the Silithus boss, I actually ran past a random druid questing and whispered him for MotW buff. I ended up survivng that fight with like 1 or 2 % HP... just enough that the MotW buff actually saved me.
---
My guild couldn't believe it. From then on out I would do the quest for the Hunters in my guild who couldn't complete it. Free of charge of course :)
---
&gt; It's not even a debate.
---
Lol why do people say this so matter of factly as if their _opinion_ is the final word on the subject? Is it just a generational thing? You don't know how to have an opinion without telling the rest of the world that they're wrong?
---
True, but I'm going to safely assume it's between 2-5% which is quite low.
---
Some pservers had it as absolutely absurd procs rates like 10-20%.
---
I try to go the opposite of my pal gear wise.
---
So were not competing for drops what so ever.
---
ie: If I go plate, partner goes clothey etc.
---
LONG LIVE THE CLASSIC SERVERS
---
(NO)
---
I spend $15 on my social media marketing ads everyday for my online business. lol bye wow retail
---
i am SO HYPED. its gonna be so nostalgic and i am super excited to get back into it \^\_\^
---
&gt; Do you believe there will be hunters accessable option for huma within wow classic?  
---
What other changes have they made that leads you to even think they'd consider this?  
---
Runetotem, EU.
---
I would be happy with BC servers in the future...but i also feel like Im kinda alone when I say I hope they implement "exclusive" classic content that doesnt feel like its changing the game too much. Take Old School Runescape for example. They vote on all new things to be put into the game and it has exclusive things that are added that are not in Runescape 3, but its only things that are added if the people want it. And it adds some more longevity to the game but also keeping it fresh. I personally hope they try something like the and the community allows it. 
---
I'm not normally for change. But I accept this. 
---
I mean.. they can just keep playing on their pservers then.
---
No then it would not be classic.
---
Surprised to see a Hunter ahead of a Druid.
---
But well, I've always thought Druid to be the best class for leveling. And, judging at my liking of slow-paced leveling, I guess that's it.
---
BTW, why did it take so much to level a rogue? As far as I remember, rogue was a speedleveling class, with no manabreaks and really short food breaks. Have you kept dying?
---
Class balance is an RPG element. You can do class balance in a single player RPG. 
---
Arena by its very existence led to every class having all of the same kits because now on a micro level the game is balanced around 3's. It also doesn't help build community, but rather takes people out of the world and puts them in instances.
---
Vanilla had 10 mans and 20 mans. Vanilla also had badges. ZG was the original instance with a badge system. You are listing Vanilla design ideas and passing them off as TBC ones...
---
Dude, I don't think you even know what vanilla had. I'm not going to bother reading anything else you have to say. You aren't informed and your arguments are incoherent and all over the place. I made a simple claim on community and your counterarguments are features with absolutely no rationale in their benefits on community. I don't see any value in exchanging ideas as your mind is made up irrespective of easily verifiable facts if you used google. Take care. 
---
^^^^^Item ^^^^^Trade 
---
i would LOVE redoing BC. its one of my fav expansions and i am still wary of fel reavers lol. 
---
I won't list things they already confirmed aren't being added, that being said:  
---
Full server sharding  
---
Cash shop  
---
Tokens  
---
If they made it so humans could only be black humans I probably wouldn‚Äôt play
---
God, getting a sick epic BoE is like taking Cialis and watching porn. Maximum boner achieved
---
I will probably wait until the sharding is turned off before I play.
---
If loot trading goes live I will probably avoid the game.
---
I am skeptical of the graphics options.  I'm curious if either Classic or Modern give an advantage in PvP (i.e. easier to see through the surface of the water, easier to see through ground clutter).  I may choose the more advantagous option, or I may not play depending on how that works out.
---
Yeah! I watch him all the time! He basically transitions to healing a bit but doesn‚Äôt usually finish the raid, at least the few times he‚Äôs died that‚Äôs how it goes. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt happen often, but chat has a whole meme meta about it that‚Äôs hilarious. 
---
Sucks, but that‚Äôs the high risk of playing what is essentially still a meme spec. 
---
Thank god for manual crowd pummelers, though! There needed to be more items like that in Vanilla that could be exploited to make hybrids work. 
---
^^^^Right ^^^^Click ^^^^Ban
---
They wont and if they did i would be done with blizzard.
---
You should do a little research instead of your bullshit theory crafting. You ask ANY pvper, I repeat ANY pvper they will tell you orc is best. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are war sham lock etc. Look at any video. Ask any private server ranker. Fucking moron
---
On this Reddit I have never seen someone be this incorrect, I will make sure to notate any opinion you have to deem invalid. Idiot 
---
Be careful with the healing beast. I rolled on a private server to see if I like healing since I've never done it in any serious way. I reached 60, farmed full pre-raid BiS, and did 2-3 MC runs but in the end, I couldn't force myself to keep doing something I hate.  
---
I'll just leave the story at that and hope it helps.  
---
**Go Warrior**.

*If you agree with me, good.  If you argue with me, go Paladin.*

**&lt;Pride&gt; - Alliance \[NA - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild**
---
**General Introduction:**  Welcome to Pride, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times and days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available raid times. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together.
---
Contact me through PM on discord at A13X#3733
---
\&gt; Every raid should have 50% druid and 50% \~\~other class\~\~ buffers for true equality, the future is feral !   
---
FTFY
---
&gt;hot if you think it's required
---
Mark my words, hot even if you don't think it's required. You'll understand when you see......
---
&gt;Starting Tauren rather sucks right out of the door however. You don't even have enough mana to kill a lvl 1 mob with Wrath lol. 
---
lol what? Tauren have less mana than night elves?
---
The item "Goblin Smasher" would have been a good start for this.  
---
Goblin Smasher is the only item in Classic that has a race specific qualifier on it. Only Tauren can use it. I feel like this was the beginning of race specific items and that this weapon was going to be the first of the totem stumps. It's a low level mace quest reward from Mulgore.  
---
&gt; I use bear form.
---
what I use depends on the situation. If I have just one mob to kill, then run a lot to the next one, I use cat. If I have a lot of mobs to kill next to each other, I use bear.
---
I mean sure you can press 1-4 easily but back then I was a scrub clicker so I had nothing bound apart from the default.
---
That spot is one of the best places for mage to make gold selling portals for horde, as most high end raiding guilds have their HS set in kargath during the early stages of the game ( MC/BWL) , and kargath is so far away from any capital city that it's an ideal location to sell portals.
---
Paladin also has Blessing of Salvation to lower threat and Sanctity Aura (not that that one is all that useful unless you brought a bunch of Retadins and Smite Priests)
---
Lmao that's hilarious.  
---
So a raid with only druid and paladin ?
---
^^^So ^^^the ^^^unseen ^^^things ^^^are ^^^ok
---
Could just make it a character transfer instead of a copy. Optional, and you could level a char specifically for the new expansion in advance.
---
Well, of course not. Those games use very different business models from WoW.
---
Diablo 2, Warcraft 3 and Starcraft were sold as finished products with additional planned content some time after its release date. This type of games normally get varying degrees of support, but usually they receive extra work done to them for the primary sales period.
---
WoW and Overwatch are services and receive a lot more support by the developer. Service titles often have much longer lifespans and receive continuous updates compared to finished products. It's extremely rare for a company to take care of finished products for as long as Blizzard do.
---
if Classic turns out to be more profitable than current WoW then mark my words, it will draw the attention of the shareholders and then it won't matter if JAB said that they don't want to maintain and develop two separate MMOs. If Classic becomes more profitable than current WoW shareholders will attempt to capitalize on its success and begin to push the company in the more profitable direction.
---
If you ask me what I think they'll do at that point I believe that shareholders will ask Blizzard to re-release older expacs because the profit margin is a lot higher compared to building an entire development team and developing Classic in complete parallel to modern WoW.
---
Replace those button tags with ‚ÄúReal Life‚Äù and ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù - summarizes my internal struggle and the inevitable conclusion quite well.
---
That's probably what they will do.
---
Preach !
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be PvP not PvE. I want to clash in the middle and this time have a machine that can handle it. 
---
Well, better play a "boring" spec instead of one that doesn't get to raid at all.
---
Posts like these man. I understand there are people who have no idea what Classic is about, but jesus christ. Sit back and observe for two seconds before you start saying braindead shit like this.  
---
Softhearts will downvote me into oblivion for this post.  
---
You'd be surprised at some of the stuff you remember. I know I was when I played on Nostalrius. Also, it feels good to come home. I damn near cried when I loaded in for the 1st time in Nostalrius. I probably will this time since I know I wont lose my stuff like I didn't before. A permanent home...wont need to go searching in this MMO wasteland anymore. I'll always have my cozy fire somewhere in Dun Murogh to come back to
---
wait, so did you teach new members to drink? Or you accepted only drinkers? :√ê
---
Or, the raid culture was that if you don¬¥t drink, you're out?
---
HAHA in fact, I'm a bit tankish IRL when it comes to alcohol tollerance. AND I'm thinking of starting my own guild... maybe I'll make a drunk dwarf viking scarab lord gui.... hmm, no, I'll be a druid. Hmm, but night elf only druid does sound good. With some occassional "immigrants", like it happens in fantasy.
---
this is what happens when people spend to much time on private servers. the vanilla core that is out now was only made after TBC launched. EVERY SINGLE VALUE in the entire vanilla wow was datamined and sniffed during TBC which is why we get things like this in vanilla wow private servers. 
---
I honestly hate DMF. I always thought it was super lame. Even more lame that yet another overpowered world buff is tied to the event.  
---
Hmm, guess that all he care about is trying to top meters then ? I mean its not like they can't clear the raid even if he does less dps.
---
Badges among many of the features he claimed were from TBC were introduced in vanilla. So were 10 mans.
---
Boom. Mic drop.
---
Ahh.
---
So I guess I don‚Äôt get the clicker thing? Like me playing a mage is going to press 1 for frost bolt 99% of the time in PvE raiding. Is there a better way to do that? 
---
I move with wasd and the press 1. Or hold both mouse buttons to move. 
---
Usually I‚Äôd bind other things like frost nova or ice block (my ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù spell) to middle mouse. 
---
I never saw much need for anything else? As there‚Äôs always time to click on things like evocation when you need it. 
---
Am I doing it wrong for a mage?
---
and that's what I'm talking about. Will Blizzard just go Classic through naxx, and then turn it into something similar to Diablo 2?
---
&gt; if Classic turns out to be more profitable than current WoW then mark my words, it will draw the attention of the shareholders and then it won't matter if JAB said that they don't want to maintain and develop two separate MMOs. If Classic becomes more profitable than current WoW shareholders will attempt to capitalize on its success and begin to push the company in the more profitable direction.
---
I hope they don't try to do that by moving cash shop to Classic...
---
Be a Dorf NElf Orc Troll or Moocow or don't play a hunter.
---
Yes,  Boots with minor speed enchants.  Duel wield weapons with +15 Agi.  Daggers with +30 Spellpower.   Treat those enchanted items as your heirlooms. +30 Spellpower to a one hander will be BiS until you hit 60. 
---
I will smile because we will finally want the same thing.
---
Gnomish deathray
---
Agreed!
---
Why would they? They are not in tune with nature enough like dwarves, taurens, trolls, orcs and nightelves. A human hunter would been a ranger, having no access to pets, not making much sense, but this discussion does not either so what do i know.
---
My personal anecdote:  
---
I rolled a paladin on day 1 with real-life friends. We made it to 50-something.
---
I hated paladin gameplay so much that I a re-rolled a priest.
---
Shouldn't the requirements be a lot lower then BFA its not like they are updating the graphics.
---
I was Resto/balance looking at it spells as I had natures swiftness. Boomie was illegal! 
---
Wow Classic will never be vanilla.
---
Dare to Esfand.
---
Yeah I guess I should specify that. They have the content on farm, or at least they did when he streamed last. 
---
He often tops the meters with full buffs, but as soon as he dies its to the bottom! It‚Äôs just not fun for him. 
---
The subreddit will get significantly bigger and the same topics will be recycled with a larger community. Then a month later it‚Äôll shrink again and we can go back to discussing what class (our alts) will be.
---
TBC killed WoW, I would never play that shit ever.
---
Props to this guy, played through warcraft 3 alot and loved the character/lore. Furion was my homage to him. 
---
Is it a free choice, guild forcing him or something they both prefer?
---
It's a pserver thing, when I first placed pserver for the first time, I had a vague memory of mages selling portals slightly more than reagent cost , like 25-30s tops but I was in for a shock to discover that mages sold portals for 1g on average , even a few stacks of high lvl mage water were sold for 1g in the early stages.
---
At first I was insulted how people could sell something for 1g when it cost them nothing to craft but I guess it was part of the pserver culture and I got used to it eventually.
---
I still don't know whether that culture developed due to having a significantly  larger population than vanilla or whether it was due to the amount of chinese people on the server.
---
I know that sounds a bit racist but I personally have nothing against chinese people, it's just that i've seen a large majority of them in pservers behave differently than the majority of western players, I don't wanna say they have no shame or honor but the closest thing I can think of is the word 'petty' , because they rarely ever help anyone but themselves or their group even if it costs them nothing, they would often not have the courtesy of letting you pick the herb right next to the mob you were fighting, even if they saw you specifically dismount trying to herb it but instead snatch it for themselves, I dunno if chinese culture is greed based but ive met very few chinese people who did not behave this way.
---
&gt;t would make me immediately lose all interest in classic?
---
And in how many games could humans only be white?
---
Human for the +Swords and Perception is underrated for Rogues in premades. WSG you're guarding the flag room from Druids and they love to kitty stealth in.
---
[TBC pre-patch had some good things in it.](https://imgur.com/r/wow/8nrZRgE)
---
No, I understand. I had a hard time with current so I didn‚Äôt really care much for it. The private server was so much more fun to me, but I know next to nothing about how classic actually was, other than what I‚Äôve experienced on that server. They do have heirlooms on it though, which is why I asked. The story/experience of it is what I want to enjoy but had no idea about it. Like I said in a reply, anything I tried to pull up on it was just forum posts from a couple years ago and I didn‚Äôt see the blizzard panel.
---
Sometimes there is no good reason to be found in lore.
---
Night Elves cannot be mages despite being genetically intertwined with arcane magic.
---
Orcs can be warlocks despite their entire history being a giant lesson on why not to mess with fel magic.
---
Haha, I couldnt resist and played on a private Server too. It does feel really good after all this time. Your muscles even know where all your keybinds were, its insane. I wish you a good ride in advance
---
or nevermind, Druids can still drink, beer is a natural beverage, isn't it? At least more natural than the Fire Resistance Potions you drink every Ragnaros pull...
---
Vanilla gold is almost nothing compared to BC value.  
---
Perhaps the argument is that Blizzard should be like parents, they know better than the player base on some things.  They see the big picture and give in on some things but hold strong on the important things.  I dunno really though.
---
I had a 3-piece night of prophecy on my greens n garbage priest. That feel when you go from terrible pieces to epics... mmmm
---
I feel bad now. I'M THE SOFTHEART.
---
&gt; This whole demon summoning thing is making me wonder how many more things that differ from private servers will be found when Classic is out, and how many more people will claim Blizzard are in the wrong.
---
I remember when demons did not respawn after you left a flight taxi. You had to shred a soulstone every time you traveled via them.
---
Though that was patched out on 1.8 or something like that.
---
Never played a warrior, or any other health-dependent class.
---
Yet, I know what it is, I know what its icon looks like, and I remember that you can but it from any innkeeper.
---
This change i can really live with, even if the buff was intentional or not, its a scam that the raid needs fire resistance as the buff covers those guilds that dont have enough dps making the whole fire resistance thing completely redundant besides on the main and off tank.
---
Not enough 
---
If it helps, I was a progression raider from 2005-2007 and again from 2009-2011 while working 12 hour shifts in a military communications centre.  Shift work would rotate from 2 x 12h days &gt; 24h off &gt; 3 x 12h nights &gt; 4 days off &gt; 3 x 12h days &gt; 24h off &gt; 2 x 12h nights etc etc etc..
---
Obviously everyone's shifts vary but there should always be guilds that accommodate your lifestyle, assuming the population of classic gets pretty high. 
---
DONT FEEL BAD :( I UNDERSTAND AND SHOULD‚ÄôVE LOOKED MORE BEFORE ASKING. 
---
I didn't ask for anything.  I played the game only.  I had no idea what was going to be in the next expansion, I just took the new stuff in stride.
---
&gt;First MC raid
---
&gt;Full tier 1
---
??
---
Well it's the same with every one, can't top the meter without world buff if everyone else is using world buffs.
---
Listen to Countdown to Classic episode 85. There is an hour or so interview with Drakova about ret paladin PvP.
---
Would answer your question better then anyone here could.
---
Well, yeah, I was gonna add that. The only reason Shedo gets so close to the top is cuz no one else on his stream / guild bothers to go as hard as he does for all the possible buffs in the game. 
---
That's an infastructure change, not a change to the actual content.  
---
The closest change to actual content they've discussed is sharding and that's not even a content change as far as story and details are concerned.   
---
&gt; In North America, the word "macaroni" is often used synonymously with elbow-shaped macaroni, as it is the variety most often used in macaroni and cheese recipes. In Italy, the noun maccheroni refers to straight, tubular, square-ended pasta corta ("short-length pasta"). Maccheroni may also refer to long pasta dishes such as maccheroni alla chitarra and frittata di maccheroni, which are prepared with long pasta like spaghetti.
---
Intellectual redditor DESTROYS pserver elitists 
---
I always liked the Plaguelands for some nice throwdown.
---
rogue can't equip staff tho. Still would be strong for a warrior.
---
&gt; I will probably wait until the sharding is turned off before I play.
---
Won't you have the same experience either way?
---
If you play at launch with sharding then you'll be in starter zones with a small amount of people.
---
If you wait for them to turn sharding off then there will be less people starting new characters you will be in the starter zones with a small amount of people.
---
Totally a free choice. They don‚Äôt kick him out. I‚Äôll try to be more specific in the future so I don‚Äôt misrepresent his situation. 
---
It‚Äôs just not fun for him to farm BWL if he‚Äôs at the bottom of the dps meter. 
---
But he absolutely could still finish the raid with his guild if he wanted to. 
---
Weren't orcs the *first* warlocks though in lore?
---
Yeah but there's going to be sharding in the starting zones.
---
No.  I will not experience players disappearing and reappearing.  I will not experience mineral and herb nodes that are just out of reach and in a different shard.
---
It is a completely different experience.  That is why we don't want it.
---
*Woah!* It's your **5th Cakeday** Kyuubi_McCloud! ^(hug)
---
In Warcraft the RTS human didn't use range weapons, elves and dwarves did.   Though personally I still think male NEs should not be hunters to stay true to the lore.  The other one really odd lore issue with WOW is the lack of dwarven mages in Vanilla.
---
You're right about the orc and warlock thing, it doesn't make any sense.  One thing I really, really wanted to see was Oger mages and warlocks on the horde.   I get why blood elves were included in TBC, horde need cute looking race, but hot damn I would have killed for some Ogers.
---
My first toon to max level was a night elf Druid also! 
---
&gt; Heroics in early Cata were **amazing** they were easy enough to complete 3 after work, the reason people complained were due to the sudden change from WotLK. 
---
Don't you dare! Doing the same 8 dungeons everyday,for tokens, wasn't that amazing!
---
&gt; Servers are further worsened and you cant even do 10v10 without lag. 
---
come on, they're reserving the resources for Classic!
---
Humans being hunters is in the Lore.
---
Molten Core was tier 1, tier 0 was dungeons like stratholm/scholomance and stuff.
---
hey then you might know how black people feel with 95% of games lol 
---
True true
---
Thank you both!
---
Read my reply to you.
---
lol everyone that joined the raid knew the rules coming in, if you joined you had to drink. Im sure a few probably cheated but we had Kara on farm so it wasn't like a huge deal to get into the raid, was just for fun and Kara had the most bosses to get people druuunnnkkk. Good times :D
---
*Hi human!* It's your **7th Cakeday** Then_I_Woke_Up! ^(hug)
---
You could RP as Clayton Bigsby
---
I am super excited for 8.1.5 and the new races and storylines. I am still having a lot of fun with the game and I get that a lot of people aren't feeling the same way. 
---
That being said, I am with you on the notes for classic. They say something that won't even really effect the way or class I play but it keeps me excited. I can't wait to see how it comes out. Ill be taking a few vacation days to get a jump on leveling. I also just upgraded my pc at work (it was awful) so i will be able to play at work when it is slow. I am so ready. 
---
r/The_Donald is that-a-way...
---
I personally don't understand being against right-click report.
---
Wasn't their statement regarding a cash shop at blizzcon something like: "There won't be one at launch."
---
Sounds like there is a good chance there will be one at some point down the line. Like with any triple a title nowadays. Get people to invest before you ask them for cash. 
---
Also some paid services were part of 1.12 already. At least those will return for sure.
---
Yes, quite a bit, but not as hardcore as on live servers.
---
Anyway, I'm surprised that Classic still doesn't have it. That's a lot of feedback to collect.
---
But why would you want to wield a totem when you could be double fisting Mug o' Hurt?
---
Gnome is pretty good too but if your set on human or dward and don't mind being slightly below human dps (if they are playing properly) I would go dwarf for overall gameplay. 
---
Ah, I see your multilingual.
---
It's *always* been that way. There are two crowds of people shouting, 'no changes!' but they mean entirely different things.
---
Except your forgetting that some gear at 60 tier is actually bid for some classes at 70 , so there's that 
---
Well, class fantasy can be quite broad. A Night Elf hunter is unlike the grizzly barbaric Orcs, so it would make sense for them to use swords.
---
I hope they put this much care into something even more subtle like spell batching, when it has a much much greater impact on gameplay than a simple pet mechanic. 
---
I was in a fairly accomplished raiding guild and for some reason they fully accepted me as an arm's warrior. We'd been clearing BWL for several weeks and everytime I prayed for ashkandi to drop, but it never did. One night, I think we were probably like 10-15 weeks in, I was seeing myself up for disappointment again. We get to nef and phase 1 goes off without a hitch. Then priest class call goes out, no buggy, not my issue. My friend who was a rogue decided to put in the priest chat asking them all to heal me non stop and so obviously I died. We were about 30% into the fight so I wasn't overly impressed because it was pretty boring just watching. Turns out the sacrifice worked because that night I became an ashkandi warrior, gquit for giggles and then went straight into some battlegrounds. PvP was never the same again. Still feels like my biggest achievement to date and a moment that I'm pretty sure I'll never forget. 
---
I'm kind of jealous that I'll never get that feeling again. I'll be lucky to even be able to step into a raid for classic having a life and all, so I'm rolling hunter next time around and I'm sure I'll be on the receiving end of an ashkandi or two and know how I made other people feel.
---
&gt; So the first thing I completely disagree with is transmogging, I hate transmogging with a passion. If I see someone looking menacingly/powerfull I want to know that they are what they portray, I don't want them to look powerfull and wear garbage.
---
I swear nearly every single time I see some kid raging out about transmog it turns out they don't even understand how it works.
---
Here's the deal: Any look you can get by mogging is a look you could get by putting on gear you actually earned. Full stop. It is no different to pulling the gear out of the bank and putting it on.
---
&gt; It ruins immersion completely and while I get the "they have to earn it to mog it" argument, I still disagree with it as it nullifies the gear you are wearing. You should see someone and know at first sight, otherwise you are allways going to have to guess and its just cumbersome and boring.
---
I think it's a fair complaint that it's bad for PvP to not be able to see what people are wearing... except that deviate delight and noggenfogger have existed since vanilla so it was never, ever possible to reliably tell what people were wearing if they didn't want you to.
---
Be consistent - either be equally butthurt about noggenfogger and mogging, or accept both as something that has always been part of the game.
---
&gt; Flying breaks the world and immersion
---
"It was totally immersive to be able to pull a kodo out of my butt and ride away, but being able to pull a dragon out of my butt and fly away in a world full of flying dragons *breaks the world!!!*".
---
&gt; WPvP is ruined 
---
You mean ganking travellers and corpse camping them is ruined. There have absolutely always been contested grinding spots, daily quest spots and world PvP objectives where you could get a fight against max level opponents if you sincerely wanted world PvP. If you couldn't find the other faction you weren't trying.
---
But that would mean going up against equal-level opponents who might call for reinforcements... which is what these "flying ruined muh world PvP" people always *pretend* they really want. Hmm.
---
Because their experience was wrong. WoW Vanilla was and always will be heavily designed with World PvP in mind.
---
In Pvp a resto druid is a great flag carrier, your damage is shit but you don't die easily. Natures swiftness is an OP oh shit button and natures grasp helps counter pesky Melee. on a pvp server is very hard to successfully gank a druid. Shapeshifting does drain your mana especially if you don't have the talent but you don't non stop shapeshift unless your trying to be big dick kitty dps 
---
I remember frost mages used to AoE farm BRD 
---
How is nobody saying the stranglethorn arena. You could slaughter 40 lvl 19s and 29s every few hours. It was a graveyard. 
---
Haha yeah, I'm in a semi-hardcore guild and we don't demand unwavering fealty or commitment, but it certainly puts you on the shortlist if you are positively contributing to the guild effort. 
---
He ended up asking if it was fine to go Retribution (probably 21/0/30) for our farmed raids (AQ/BWL) after we started AQ40, so those particular ones we are more than happy to have him DPS so that even veterans can enjoy coming to the easier raids while we bring in the newbies.
---
Honestly, he has enough of the important talents from the Holy tree to be pretty efficient with enough gear if we need him to toss some heals out on specific fights.
---
Theres a bunch of stuff in Lore that isnt in the game, what is your point?
---
love your podcast bud, keep up to great work. I have some catching up to do!
---
Thank you for all the answers brother! Really, really appreciate it :)
---
But it still won't entirely fix it.
---
Sharding is there so instead of 500 people in Northshire Abbey, there's ten shards of fifty.
---
There's still 50 people in Northshire Abbey trying to kill 8 kobolds.
---
Hey soulscream, i think you are not posting in the correct game forum. Try to find some maybe looking for " karazhan chess event reddit" we encourage you to do so! Good luck and hope you find your game mate! 
---
Thanks for listening! Hope you enjoy the rest of the ride :)
---
My first MC raid I actually ended up with 2 pieces of tier 2 on my mage. :)
---
Not sure why you are freaking out but get back to me when you find it.
---
I have a plan to make 4 gnomes and 2 dwarves. Totally excited and I wish they would tell us a release date so I could put in for some time off üòú
---
I play private servers a lot tanks are pretty quick like 10 mins
---
It says several :) :P
---
You're very right, thanks for the catch! I'll have an up-to-date (and more accurate) video on the subject uploaded pretty soon here too.
---
And that amount of people will continue to shrink... which is a?
---
I think technically they were not the very first since Gul'dan was given the power by Kil'jaedin, and Kil got the hang of fel magic while fighting demons that were using it.
---
But that is kind of irrelevant. It was the fel magic that led to the corruption of Kil'jaeden and led to the corruption and enslavement of the Orcs. Playing around with fel magic has not been kind to the orcs, and I think they shpuld have banned its use outright after the corruption was broken.
---
Cross-realm BG's were part of what ruined the game for me. I hope not. I miss the rivalries 
---
&gt; No one supports the existing PvP system so that's a shit point. 
---
Last time this topic came up this sub was infested with people who were adamant that they wanted the existing vanilla PvP system, no ifs or buts, and IIRC some even claimed they wouldn't play Classic if they changed the honour system.
---
I think those people are totally nucking futs, but I can't say they don't exist.
---
&gt; Arena was boring (on top of many other factors) because it dropped PvP down from 20+ people (5v5 was dead) to 6 maximum.
---
My memory was that you still had to do battlegrounds if you wanted all the best gear.
---
And a 10v10 brawl almost never happened in WSG or AB anyway, people spread out over the map and had smaller skirmishes that were very rarely bigger than 5v5. If the other team formed a 10-toon zerg the best play was almost always to just avoid them and get the objectives they weren't defending.
---
Oh in that case I must be mistaken. Apparently I really liked TBC and just didn't realize it. Thank you for showing me the error in my ways.
---
Furion is wearing the Wildheart helmet, which is not tier 1. That would be the Cenarion set
---
This is going to be tough for most to answer because it was very player specific.
---
For example, I was a priest with a prot warrior friend who was usually on at the same time I was. I was also in an active guild. So for me? Almost instantly. For most people it was almost instant because you would get a solid friends list and rarely had to pug.
---
From what I remember prior to guilding up was that DPS were always abundant but the tank would often not want a certain class rolling against him. As a priest I was always waiting on a tank and tanks were always waiting on healers.
---
Something to remember. No matter what your class, if you made friends who were on at the same time, you didn't have to wait to pug.
---
I believe he's calling the class set T1

I wish the same to you, friend! Yeah it will be interesting to see how the dynamic is different.
---
What the fuck man...
---
Yeah that's a change Im absolutely for, the gold spam back then was fucking insane and it helped curb it alot when they introduced that. 
---
&gt; 800x600
---
I, too, raided with a Pentium 4. 3 FPS NBD.
---
That makes no sense. Leveling is were all the fun is. 
---
Maybe for the reason that you are retorting my statements on leveling cooking with your statements? It is NEVER faster on a melee class, with no healing, to skip cooking. Every hub after 10 has a cooking quest that gives you an at-level equivalent recipe. There is NO efficient grinding route for 30-40 and 45-50 that completely avoids these hubs on melee classes. You're being very abstract and hypothetical for some reason and it's weird.
---
Stop spreading hypothetical misinformation. Warriors and rogues do not just go grind mobs for 10 levels and if they do, there is no logical reason to.
---
This made me smile
---
All I‚Äôll say is that there‚Äôs a very good reason warrior is the most popular class on 1.12 servers.
---
By time EU got a world first, several raids had been out. Too guilds cleared the raids and farmed them for months before a new one came out.  Not to mention that EU got the C‚ÄôThun hot fix that made him kill able prior to NA. 
---
I'm gonna freeze myself like the brave Eric Cartman

Pallys are loved for buffs and long lasting mana pools

Dam I wish I was still this hyped. Been waiting for years for them to make these servers. Been checking every day since late 2017 when it was announced and it just feels like its been so god dam long. Hype is fading for me :( I don't have faith Activision isn't going to ruin the game I grew up playing
---
I respect your opinion, but no.
---
&gt; This is going to be tough for most to answer because it was very player specific.  
---
I'm hoping to get a lot of answers to see a middle ground.  
---
&gt; No matter what your class, if you made friends who were on at the same time, you didn't have to wait to pug.  
---
I know it seems odd, but I'm not trying to formulate strategies to reduce PuG grouping times for myself since I will already have a group. I just want to see what the times are for a PuG. I'm just trying to get some insight to how this game is when you don't have friends to play with.  
---
But the gameplay philosophy and style was the same, but upgraded with some new toys. It wasn't until WotLK that the combat and class design was altered significantly. TBC *feels* like Vanilla, even if it's on a different planet and has lots of new stuff as well.
---
Whether or not it was *better* is just personal preference. I like Flying, I like badge gear, I like the slightly faster combat. It still feels like Vanilla for the most part, though.
---
Not quite true. There was a guy called the Pacifist who leveled to 60 without killing a single mob. Quite the madman. He only took quests that didn't force you to kill anything. 
---
Not only that. They have actually running vanilla server in their quarters as a reference
---
&gt;Theres a bunch of stuff in Lore that isnt in the game, what is your point?
---
Semantic?
---
Humans are Hunters. 
---
I hope not.
---
&gt; World PvP wasn't just ganking or corpse camping, that's a shit argument and objectively wrong. 
---
Let's examine this. You are whining that flying mounts spoiled world PvP. Is this a shit argument and objectively wrong? Yes it is.
---
Did flying mounts spoil PvP outside of raids? No, most raid portals could not be entered without needing to dismount and run in. 
---
Did flying mounts spoil PvP in contested zones? No, you can't do the thing in the contested zone while flying. 
---
Did flying mounts spoil PvP while levelling? No, you didn't have a flying mount while levelling.
---
Did flying mounts spoil PvP in grinding spots, daily quest spots or world PvP objectives? No, no and no.
---
What did it spoil? It spoiled one particular kind of PvP, ganking people who were travelling from point A to point B, and corpse camping them. That's it. That's all it spoiled.
---
Oh you guys are talking about diagnosing the entire screenshot and looking at every piece of a players gear and judging them as a tier 0 raid.. not the raid instance which is tier 1... ya I do not look at pictures that hard.
---
&gt; Final content release schedule, including dates  
---
Ion said that the next content buckets would be released when the community is ready for it. I doubt they'll give us dates for this.  
---
Plan on doing this for a leveling guild I'll be making. Also +55 healing, and maybe some ZG enchants if it's not too crazy expensive. Will be interesting to see how many get stolen.
---
Hot dam that's some luck. We had MC on farm for months and I still only got 4/8 Might set on my warrior :(
---
This makes me so happy they really are sticking to that authentic ideal. 
---
&gt; There is no way the retail Classic playerbase will be more dedicated than the pserver playerbase. Pserver players are the ones who have gone out of their way and through many inconveniences to play Vanilla WoW.
---
Agreed. Although "dedicated" is the wrong word. Pirate server players are aa self-selected group. All the people who didn't want to play vanilla forever have left already, so all that is left are the small remaining group of people who want to play vanilla forever.

&gt; Classic WoW will be populated in a vast vast majority by retail players, then a smaller majority BC and Wrath babies, and a small minority of actual Vanilla players and fans.
---
That's cute, you think you're special.
---
If I were playing hunter then I would be sad if they got rid of 2H for hunters. When I played hunter during Vanilla PvP there were few things as satisfying as some rogue getting in your face, thinking that he has you dead to rights, and then you whip out your Arcanite Reaper and get a fat Mongoose Bite crit making him regret his decision.

Boomkin didn't exist yet at the point of OPs screenshot. It was added in patch 1.8, a few months later, in the druid class overhaul
---
No way to tell.

You can pry my orc warlock from my cold dead hands!

I work swing shift and don't get off until 10pm PST. Been looking for months for a guild and still no luck even with a set schedule :(
---
Hey everyone,
---
Ive been working for the last couple weeks on this 60 Hunter PvE Field Manual.¬†
---
It‚Äôs basically my best attempt at a thorough, stylized, Hunter Class knowledge dump. I hope some of you might find useful in your preparation for Classic this Summer.
---
Like many of you I‚Äôm still undecided as to what class I will main.
---
My brain says Warlock but my heart says Hunter :)
---
This is hopefully the first of 9 end game PvE Class Guides. Was thinking of stylizing them around class fantasy so for Rogues it would be the SI:7 Dossier or for Warlocks it would be the PvE Grimoire/Necronomicon or something haha. If you guys have any cool ideas I would sincerely appreciate any feedback or guidance for future projects.

Before we even consider more things after classic, let us see how classic goes first... I still have serious doubts about classic.  First Ion's stance on Sharding really worries me.  Second the servers classic will run on are the same servers that run retail which are horrible!  3rd.. Blizzard has lied to it's customers a lot the last couple years; only time will tell.
---
I agree so hard. I've actually been thinking about it a bit (because I originally played on Arthas which was super heavy alliance, so while I was on horde there was no queue, but alliance waited 30 minutes to an hour so I have to admit I was on the good side) and if we accept that cross realm BGs were a part of vanilla, maybe they could do something like way smaller groups. If it's like 2 realms that balance population to make the queues reasonable then you don't lose as much of the rivalries and you're still playing vs your server about half the time, but you also can avoid the 1 hour queues.
---
Patch 1.12 is what they will release.  Patch 1.12 is the patch where cross realm battlegrounds was implemented. 
---
Why even offer the option to copy/transfer a character over?  Fresh server means fresh everyone has to level fresh.
---
Arena arena arena
---
PvP was added as an afterthought, which should be obvious from the lack of polish PvP mechanics received. 
---
I don't remember exact times, but I can rank the classes I played in Vanilla in order of how easy it was to get in random groups. Most of the time it was not too bad on any classes with the exception of Rogue. There were some nights where, as a rogue, I was trying to get into dungeon groups for 2 hours. Most of the time groups were looking for tank, heal, or ranged dps.
---
 1. Warrior Tank
---
 2. Priest Heal
---
 3. Mage DPS
---
 4. Shaman Heal
---
 5. Shaman DPS
---
 6. Hunter DPS
---
 7. Rogue DPS
---
I‚Äôm reading you can‚Äôt slap on the ZG enchants on items because it will make them soul bound. And you can‚Äôt apply them via trade.  Makes sense because they were all class specific.
---
I can't find the post but at some point I read the version of AV thats coming out isnt the all day one but the one where both teams just pushed to the end.  Which means a lot less npc's is my understanding.
---
You breaking down semantics with a pessimistic view. We don‚Äôt know, true, but they DO know that a cash shop is something that is not wanted by the Classic audience.
---
I made it to 47 on pally. Couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. Too boring for me. Loving my warrior now, up to level 54! Tanking can be kind of stressful in dungeons tbh and requires some decent skill. Very fun though once you get the hang of it. 
---
I feel like this is going to be the tip of the iceberg.  There's going to be other things that are going to be different from what people experience on pservers or just straight up remember and I'm worried there'll be blood in the water, despite the fact that Blizzard has access to the actual game state from that point in time.
---
Nessingwarys for lyfe
---
I‚Äôm actually surprised it wasn‚Äôt blocked by Blizz. Still have the char/name?
---
What are the last words supposed to mean?
---
We will never be 100% sure until release but its likely you wont be able to play vanilla wow on your first generation 64 bit processor.  My guess is it'll be slightly lower than current wow.
---
That would be a fair compromise. If its just two servers it's not as big of a deal. I was in the same situation as yourself, my server was mostly alliance so we had no queue times on Horde side. I could see it being frustrating being on the other side though.
---
Bro I looked at one guy, Furion. His portrait does not have Tier 1 gear. It took all of four seconds to notice, lol
---
Pallys can do just fine tanking 5 man dungeons, however will never tank a raid. 
---
I agree, I enjoy Orc Warlock, I just don't think it makes much sense from a lore point of view.
---
The only thing I would play instead, if it were an option, is a Troll Warlock. It would make sense too, Trolls have a history of being drawn to and irreversibly changed by magical sources. That is how we got Night Elves after all.
---
&gt; Cash shop, WOW token and character services
---
We do know about this. Theyve spoken about it publically. Its not gonna be in Classic. Yes you can get playtime through tokens on BFA but not in classic and no cashshop or char services. Server transfer services MIGHT come later just like it did back then but thats about it.

I feel like druid will be pretty popular in classic. They can literally do everything, and people like to challenge themselves with a class that has a stigma. If you get the gear u can do any roll on a druid.
---
STV for ganking. Barrens for rading crossroads in between BGs. Blackrock Mountain for epic world PvP. 
---
Shimmering flats is dangerous, man. Nowhere to hide. Once you make the decision to engage, you better be prepared to fight and possibly be camped for the next hour. 
---
As always, excellent work, Kargoz. Its amazing how much work went into this!

Maybe it's the old elitist in me (I won't every be able to play like I did in vanilla and TBC) but in vanilla WoW beating something was an accomplishment that mattered in the rest of the game. I had the first Sulfuras on Arthas Horde side (like fucking 7 of them on Alliance) and literally by the time we got back to town to craft the epic to combine with the Eye the news had spread, people were gathering, and there was a gathering of people in Orgrimmar to watch me equip it (I was hoping for some kind of cool effect on the combine, but nope, it was kind of silly). With high end gear you'd get people inspecting you and commenting on it. It was interesting and different.
---
In TBC they started the path of throwing awesome stuff at everyone. I understand the need to have content for everyone and not to just make raiders gods of the servers, but when I was clearing raids in TBC and gearing up it was just a thing for our guild chat and for outside forums. It didn't have an effect on the world in the same way.
---
You mean it was a rpg? I was out when I hit 70. Most actual rpg fans wanted more immersion, more worldly events, PvP that can shape the world and a general challenge like most rpgs, more things players can do to interact with the world.
---
I don't even know what half of that means because vanilla is the last time I played fully. I'm not into dungeon crawling easy mode games that are pay2win catering to carebare whiners who quit when they realize the time sink is real
---
Anywhere between instant and several hours, really. 
---
Spontaneously reacting to LFM shouts could get you a group near instantly, with LFM shouts typically searching for Healers/Tanks and those DPS that don't roll on the loot of the guy making the group. 
---
Assembling a group yourself would take a while, though having a pocket healer/tank ready could speed up the process immensely. 
---
It varied a lot with the dungeons and prep, tho. Getting a group to do LBRS to the end was like pulling teeth, UBRS with key filled in a flash. Regular dungeon times also got longer as the server matured and less and less people needed them. 
---
If I had to assign a number, I'd say half/three quarters of an hour for DPS and about half that for tanks/healers. 
---
When bc released, blood elves couldn't be warriors. Blizz official response was that they weren't saying BE warriors weren't in the world, just that they couldn't be PCs. Same thing here. Humans won't be hunters in classic.
---
Reagents aren't free...

I remember I didn‚Äôt have any key binds, pretty sure I point clicked (definitely did 1-40) and had no macros. No one judged me though lol

&gt; I missed due to a long work trip

Where'd you go, outer space? Mars? lol

I could be mis-remembering cool 1v1s there, you may be right.
