I mean what do you want, a WoW hit squad that shows up at his house and eliminates him?
---

---
I understand your concern, but the community policed itself quite well back in the day. The community composition will be different this go around, but hopefully the trolls will get sick of Classic and go bother someone else.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
---
---
Your ignore list has a VERY limited reach also, luckily is it just long enough.
---
Old graphics look like shit nothing will change my mind, but oh well. Cant wait for classic.
---
&gt;I know, but do you know what 
---
Oh so for some reason you are fine with changes? Why is that? Because they happened *during* vanilla? Even tho quite a few changes were absolutely anti vanilla, you still want them (like CRBGs)?  
---
You want vanilla as a same 15 year old mess.  
---
I want classic as a an idea to live on and improve, like it mostly did during its patch cycles (which funnily enough everyone praise and bash that old patches were shit, funny how that goes eh)    
---
&gt;No Vanilla server (1x blizzlike) have ever used custom feature, talents or adjusted numbers from classes and specs to make some dps specs more or less viable. They ALL try to be authentic with the game play. Sure some use different respec costs, dynamic respawns etc etc, but no one have used different talents or numbers for ret palas  
---
Yea, because that would actually require some work and not just copy pasting shit from wiki or old data they gathered.  
---
&gt;I can tolerate "improvements" like dynamic respawn, word chat, different respec cost, 1.12.1 client and talents and stuff like that within reason but what I will never tolerate is balance changes to gameplay from outside Vanilla  
---
Oh so you are okay with stuff you (secretly) want but are not okay with some other stuff. That's not a very good argument to have mate.  
---
&gt;Blizzard will make some changes to Classic, that is 100% sure, but they will NOT "improve" specs, they said so very clearly, and if they did, I would not play Classic  
---
Not at start for sure. Sometime down the line I can see them do that, after everythings been done to death and even you are bored.  
---
I'll make sure of that.  
---
Its just a bad pic. 
---
Lmao @ all the people saying the right one looks better.
---
The right one IS the classic demo, OP switched the logos and you guys got bamboozled big time.
---
"I kind of dont like how a graphics "upgrade" entails that you just make things brighter and cleaner looking, old one has alot more personality imo." lool
---
Another example is of this is ISB. In 1.12 the application of ISB could resist(miss). In the pre TBC patch they made it always apply becaus it was a "bug".
---
You sound like the typical PvP Chad with that "scripted battle" argument that never actually raided at the highest level and talks out of his butt honestly.
---
If you think there isn't a single challenge in raids then you're probably 300 IQ, good for you. I found plenty of encounters challenging over the years, from raids as old as AQ and culminating with HM Lich King, C'thun, TFH, Kael'thas, Kil'jaeden, Yogg 0 watchers... Plenty of difficult and exciting encounters to me. But hey I'm probably not as smart as you are. 
---
&gt; I'm just writing facts...
---
Yet the thing you are constantly using to justify yourself explicitly states on the forums and not in general. If naming and shaming was harassment across the whole game then why do they explicitly state on the forums and not just straight up say naming and shaming is harassment? ...That is because they have two different set of rules.
---
Your video proved nothing.  
---
Its not vanilla. It will never be like it was back then. They stated so themselves by starting with the latest patch.  
---
lmfao if thats true thats good 
---
Makes sense. Wow aimed to steal players from the then mmo giant Everquest in which most melee classes auto attacked and occasiapnnly pressed one button for Kick, Backstab, monk attack etc etc. Paladin is a good familiar gameplay class for Everquests players 
---
I loved Tirisfal, easily my favorite starting zone for horde. Unfortunately, that is not an option for me.
---
Telling people they are delusional when they are isn't toxic. Letting them believe in fairy tales and lies, where they continue their "toxic" behavior is.
---
1) Paladins aren't going to get changed.
---
2) Paladins are supposed to be a easy class per the leads in a interview with media in 2005.
---
IMO all posts asking for changes that the WOW leads have specifically said won't happen shouldn't be allowed on this forum or the poorly moderated official WoW Clasic forum (there should be a sticky explaining this) where we see this crap every few days. It's not a conversation. It's not a discussion. It's a waste of time and leads to toxicity that shouldn't exist. 
---
Want to lead DPS on a paladin in a raid? Play modern WoW or wait for a WOTLK Classic server that will be a complete joke with 50 percent Ret Paladins like private servers. Stop trying to ruin something you don't even understand with Vanilla though.
---
We now have content creators with large followings asking for this crap btw when they obviously never even played vanilla since they think initial raids had 16 debuffs.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ldZjHiTAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ldZjHiTAA)
---
**Why should we stand back and let the same people who ruined modern WoW ruin Classic?** 
---
I had to google the command to disable the FXGlow when I played it. I fucking hate that effects. 
---
Yeah, maybe if you play Ret. But as Holy with all your Blessings and Judgements its definitely not as easy as a Hunter or Mage.
---
Yes, as everyone knows, gear is one of those things that is easily obtained and replaced while leveling in vanilla wow.
---
Love trisfal, considering making the small hike to the zeppelin with my troll mage/orc shaman.
---
Melee were also faceroll in Ultima Online. You legit just did autoswings. WoW was the first game where melee had some HARD classes (not in pve, cus everything was faceroll in raiding until maybe Cata outside feral druid). Designers had a "wizard" fetish with the harder specs/classes there for a long time. 
---
In WoW people were actually surprised when warriors turned out to be hard to play and when rogues had combo systems etc. A LOT of people rerolled when they hit those murlocs. What did they reroll to? Paladins and enhance shamans and BM hunters. Classes Blizzard put there for people that would struggle.
---
Now those players want to take intentional class design that helped THEM in the past and change their class. Sorry, just play a different class if you want a bigger challenge. It's not hard. Don't ruin Classic for other people.
---
Every expansion post-Wrath has been an exercise in making it simpler for the devs to balance the game, which is why they remove talents, remove stats, and give lots of classes overlapping abilities that used to be unique
---
&gt;Oh so for some reason you are fine with changes? Why is that?
---
Because they don't mess with balance changes from outside Vanilla...
---
&gt; Yea, because that would actually require some work and not just copy pasting shit from wiki or old data they gathered. 
---
Yeah it would require work to make changes to class balance. And they don't want to make changes to class balance because they want to be as close as possible to authentic class balance...
---
&gt; Oh so you are okay with stuff you (secretly) want but are not okay with some other stuff. That's not a very good argument to have mate. 
---
Do you understand the meaning of the word TOLERATE? I can TOLERATE 15g respec cost. I don't like it. I'm not "ok" with it, but I can TOLERATE it. I can't TOLERATE balance changes from outside Vanilla though.
---
&gt; Not at start for sure. Sometime down the line I can see them do that, after everythings been done to death and even you are bored. 
---
I started to play Vanilla in 2015 and have played almost daily ever since. I have 8 lvl 60 right now and have started fresh many times. I am super hyped for Classic and is not even close to be bored. In fact, I have never even raided BWL/ZG/AQ/Naxx yet. I hope they will release TBC Classic in the future. If they do that I can play Vanilla/TBC and maybe even WOTLK until I die...
---
And just to be clear. I don't mind if Blizzard make custom servers for people like you as long as they make authentic servers first.
---
Regarding the video you linked, my video was in regards to those claims. Kevin states that this was a blunder and should not have been stated as it did not accurately represent his design intentions in not so many words. A "blunder". The guy mispoke. Regardless of what the design was intended to be though, we have paladins in their final form, WHICH are actually fairly complex to play at a high level while remaining competitive. 
---
Being that the game was balanced around PvE, you cant deny that mages are actually the EASIEST raid class by a fairly large margin... So their design philosophy around making a paladin the beginner class (which wasnt their intention and was a blunder by Rob) is undermined by the fact that the mage is CLEARLY easier.
---
Vanilla is not balanced. It finds balance in imbalance... You have a chip on your shoulder because people claim that the rogue is overpowered. In some circumstances they are... And in that way, they are balanced. But what is the point of attacking the difficulty of classes like paladin? At the core, vanilla is a very casual, very easy game that was designed for a VERY broad playerbase. All classes are easy to play, most are challenging to master.
---
Good idea! I may just do that. The barrens may not be all that bad though. It's been so long I can't remember. 
---
For real! Even the 1-5 camp wears me out, razormanes for days
---
You are an idiot. I have nothing more to say to you...
---
So I cleared all of pre bc except the second half of naxx.  It isn't that it's really harder, it's just that it was the first time for a lot of players. Like in EQ for example, same sort of thing... It's mostly tank and spank and typically two or three classes will have specific roles in the fight. 
---
  
---
Thing is about the non viable raid specs is that you CAN raid with most of them... But why would a rogue want to pass on leather gear to a druid doing 45% of his damage?  What winds up happening is, one useless item drops, like shammy tier set once, and one highly sought item drops... Let's say this is a progression kill... Why would you as a guild leader, want to gimp the items usefulness by giving it to a second rate player/spec? Conversely, why would you want to raid in meme form when you're probably not going to actually get anything out of it? 
---
I should say, I was in a FEW high end guilds during that time. Only one guild let meme specs happen, and typically it was only in raids that were A. On farm, and B. It was a core raiders alt or alt spec and most players in the group needed nothing or very little. In which case they are the drop priority.
---
Side note, right around the change of healing stat/damage stat,  in TBC I as a paladin joined a guild that was progressing through gruul and swagtheridon... Their form of drop management was called wishlist, which basically means you pick 25 items which you can edit monthly, and your #1 was highest priority and descending from there... Well, I slapped the spellblade #1 snatched it from those bitch mage/locks and had a pretty sweet ass shickadin.  - needless to say, people liked me.
---
&gt;That is because they have two different set of rules.
---
Actually they have the same rules for all games and forums now...
---
Is it viable to go to another zone from 1-10?  Can you do all the level 1 quests and such - and for warlocks in particular, can you do Forsaken's voidwalker quest if you're an orc?
---
So address point for point the content creators. You're toxic. You're trying to go after guppies all the while complaining about sharks. You're not going to change anyone's opinion with these posts. It's easy to call someone who's misinformed delusional and it probably boosts your ego or something. If you really want to persuade people, not attacking their person is a good start. Thats all I've seen you do. I agree with your points, but I would never choose to associate with an argument on your side, you're just too toxic.
---
I think the point of what they are trying to convey in that slide is that the paladin was easy to play, hard to master. I think it’s a fair concept and to say it is either easy or hard is totally subjective to how you are playing and what you are doing. 
---
He mispoke but never clarified it at the time, neither did any of the other devs and they also made a slide that said it?
---
HAHAHAHA. Good one man. Got to love revisionist history all to try to make a content creator and his audience feel good about himself. 
---
Also lol at mage being "easier" when Kaplan flat out said that "pvp is where you can show what you got" and they are among the highest skill cap. No one has it hard raiding. All classes use like 1/10th their spellbook. Raiding was never meant to be a wannabe esport in vanilla. It was somewhere to chill with friends get gear and slowly progress through gear accumulation. Try hards broke that with consumables, which was planned for. It's why they made  bosses drop only 2 pieces of gear.
---
The purpose of having classic is to live again the same nostalgy with all its good amd bad things. Like a marriage one would say.
---
That's the #nochanges main motive imo. We want it as it was and live with it. 
---
The problem you run into is trainers, an orc warlock in tirisfal would be fine. But a shaman wouldn't have any trainers around, and their totem quests are zone specific. Unsure on whether an orc warlock can do the undercity version of the voidwalker quest or if they would need to zepelin back to org.
---
Imagine having not met Kevin and not knowing him... and having not watched the entire video, where Kevin criticizes other misconceptions the Classic Cast have about vanilla but yet still thinking you are socially aware enough to assess his mindset... Imagine being on a public forum where you are notoriously downvoted by your peers for poor behavior, terrible ideas and a lack of social awareness, yet you imply that you can understand this random strangers mindset... NOW THAT would be fucking delusional.
---
&gt; **You are basically saying him and all the original leads of Warcraft lied to players and media in 2005.** 
---
No. Infact Kevin said it was a blunder. He mispoke. This is how things work... There are a TON of moving parts and this guy is responsible for presenting a wide body of information that he has not worked on. During design, each wing of development have their own goals for the end product and those designs are monitored and tailored by the lead devs... Sometimes, when you arent the guy in charge of something and you need to present on it, you say something that isnt entirely accurate due to some sort of misunderstand. I know, its WILD idea, but if you ever worked at a large organization and had anything to do with PR, you would understand that this is pretty common.
---
There was a way to back door the horde base too which used a frozen waterfall I think, to the side if the horde base. Ice blood is closer to Galv
---
#nochanges
---
No idea what's a going on in this thread 
---
What movie is this from?
---
Wew lad, 15 years of improvement right there
---
29 nelf hunter, shadowmelt and protect bases in ab. Its awesome
---
well at the end of the day classes shouldnt change to include anything from tbc or after. but im confident blizzard are not going to do custom balancing
---
&gt;He mispoke but never clarified it at the time
---
Right. We already went over that. It was a mistake. Clarified by Kevin in the video I linked. One of Rob's "classic blunders", apparently they were rather common...
---
&gt; lol at mage being "easier" 
---
Mage is easier in PVE. A lot easier. The game was balanced and designed around PvP first and foremost and mage was easier... I dont think thats a stretch is it?
---
&gt; The only hard raiding class in Vanilla is the main tank due to theorycrafting 
---
I'd disagree with that. I find gear swapping / trinket swapping / using engi on a hunt at a high level can actually be far more complex than tanking. Ive done both and hunter has much less room for error if you are perfecting your DPS. At its base, hunt is super simple, but when you start adding more and more to your rotation with trinkets and engi while weaving that auto shot, you have an incredibly small allowance for error. But here we go again... The game is simple. Lets be real... Lol. So why bother arguing over what class is difficult and which is easy? They are all simple by modern standards.
---
 
---
I remember many 49 think mages stomping level 60s in duels.
---
Shadowmeld*
---
Unpopular opinion because min/maxing is frowned upon... But I would not let 2-3 hours of my play experience out of the hundreds of hours you play, determine which race I selected. Furthermore, you could always run to another zone. While this is less efficient, you will probably THANK yourself later...
---
That being said, UD makes a better PVE lock for pure stats. Orc is FAR (and I mean fucking FAR) superior race for lock in pvp.
---
That means another 5 months for us Canadians 
---
Well written!
---
Ret paladins outclass nobody you fucking retard. They do worth dps than even a feral in bear form.
---
Yo, for reals, this guy has been manic, posting borderline shit all day. 
---
At what point does it cross over the line into reportable content. 
---
My brother and I had a few twinks in the 19-29 brackets. 
---
29 rogue, 29 hunter, 29 paladin and 19 priest and Druid 
---
Rogue was fun to murder people.... but the hunter could murder an entire team. 
---
But of all the twinks, the priest was the most broken. At 19 you could get the bfd quest wand and hit like a canon. I can’t wait to relive that experience.
---
Pfffft... 2 week resets are fucking laaame. Ill spend the first 5 days leveling, smash thru MC on the 6-7th day and be bored for the last 7 days. 1 week resets would be preferred for us Pserver boys. 
---
Gank lowbies
---
Sounds like you need a hug. I enjoy playing the class, is that so hard to understand?
---
OH okay I thought you meant mages destroyed locks I got confused 
---
I was indifferent. It was just a key ring... Who cares? Had no more impact than achievements do in the modern game. Its just a tab that I dont bother clicking.
---
[removed]
---
and how many hours did you spend raiding?
---
&gt;Your ignore list has a VERY limited reach also, luckily is it just long enough
---
I have no idea what this is supposed to mean?
---
1v1 me on rust bitch
---
There was a ton of content that was being developed for vanilla wow.  Karazhan and Mt Hyjal were raids that were being built for Vanilla, and I read an article once that there was actually a lot more content on the roadmap.   Inherently the problem is gear scaling.  If you are going to offer a more difficult raid zone with gear checks you have to give out better and better gear that scales up.  So there is a design problem in that at one point there would be essentially gods in world or zoned pvp and anyone else not above a T3 gearing would be so overwhelmed it would begin to affect the experience.  I personally would like to see Mt Hyjal and Karazhan as a 40 man raid in vanilla with relevant gear upgrades.  Then who knows what.  Maybe they could finally release World of Starcraft with the same design principles as vanilla wow and really go crazy.  
---
It would be weird to do that as a one off just for BL though. Implies more fundamental changes to how node spawning works.
---
I liked many of the maps of the expansions such as Karazhan and Hellfire Peninsula and Northrend.
---
I just hated the added level cap with a passion since it effectively invalidates all end game content up to that point. 
---
When I saw the Burning Crusade announcement I realized that all my progress was going to be reset every few years, which still annoys me to this day, even though I haven't touched the game since Cataclysm.
---
So, if I had my way, they would slowly add BC and WOTLK content repurposed as lvl 60 end game dungeons or alternate leveling zones. But realistically, I don't expect a lot of people to agree with me on that, so it's a pipe dream. Most likely they'll play it safe and freeze it after Naxxramas, and possibly do another reset on a new realm if people are still interested.
---
If they were to progress into the original Burning Crusade after Naxxramas, then all of this would have been in vain.
---
I'll be taking my orc straight to Tirisfal, then burn through the Durotar quests.
---
&gt;By that logic, Drek is more difficult than Onyxia
---
No because they exist in a completely different context.
---
My first experience in wow was the valley of trials, so im very biased to it.
---
I fondly remember my 49 druid and shockadin
---
I feel like it's relatively easy to master, as well. That's not to say that it isn't a powerful class. It brings a lot of utility and survivability to all types of game play, and you can still min/max to perform to the very peak. But it is easier than most other classes to perform *well*.
---
39 mage and 49 rogue were endless fun
---
I think it's the freedom of play too. Alliance typically roll to win, horde roll for the kills. Atleast that was my obj as horde. Field of Strife battles ftw. Forget winning
---
having had the pleasure of playing paladin and priest healers, both in pvp and pve: oh hell no.
---
I have *literally* healed through heroics (TBC) with a holy paladin by putting down my mouse and keyboard on the floor and only using my toes. they're the easiest healing class out of the bunch, with extremely efficient heals and their blessings making life even easier for their teammates too - just drop a few salvations and let the fuckers go wild.
---
pvp is also almost... quaint. you can't really get interrupted, you're packed in sardine tin, and if things go really tits up, you still have your bubble.
---
compare and contrast this to a priest, who has about fifty different heals and a fuckload of other utility spells, and while they're wrecking balls in pvp, they're also made out of wet paper and are the prime kills targets.
---
...so sorry, but no. holy paladins are actually the easiest healing spec.
---
They look pretty much the same, just one has the screen brightness jacked up.
---
wouldn't be enough  supply of AH bijous/coins
---
Buy every single potion in the Auction House and resell at 500% of the price until the alchemists catch on and start listing their potions at my price.
---
You my friend is why WoW is such an amazing game
---
What's sad is that you care that it might be a lie and are enough of a dick to accuse the person without knowing for sure.
---
The old raids were hard, but not nearly as hard as today's mythics. Naxx will get cleared much faster than it did in retail, with a MUCH larger percentage of clears. The real difficulty in Vanilla was the number of raiders, and just plain bad players. I've played since vanilla and here and there on pservers and it's not that hard. The raiding and pvp scene in Vanilla is super casual.
---
So an analogy. You buy an original Ford Model T from 1912. Would the car become better if you painted it with modern paint or would that kinda ruin the feeling of having an original Model T?
---
Of course, but it will be easier than retail for sure. 
---
It's not about QoL imo, classic and BC are RPG games with resouces being hard to come by, the world being dangerous and players gaining power slowly as they level, having niche and very class specific spells that immerses the player. Also the lack of RDF and actual servers makes your reputation matter and with it a community forms. RDF is not the same as these other QOL changes at all, they helps the community form without barriers. 
---
Give me guildbank, give me calender, give me a reworked PvP ladder that is 2019 worthy (the gameplay/ meta is still the same). Give me the QOL that dont impact gameplay, because it is the gameplay that makes  classic different to BFA. Current Wow retail is not an RPG. It's and action/collection game. 
---
Idk about all these nerds up at the top but I WILL BE ROLEPLAYING AS AN ASSISTANT TO CHEF GORDON TRAMSAY IN FERALAS 
---
Nope, still there. In fact, they gave every class a spell interrupt 
---
19 nelf hunter. I was a menace on Nostalrius, will do the same here. I really hope jumping in between the fence is still a thing. Maybe make a priest afterwards.
---
My god I hope the gurubashi arena chest spawns at launch so when everybody is busy grinding I will park my level 1 there.
---
Thank you! 😁
---
From talking to people on pservers, the population pressure made their economies wonky af compared to actual vanilla, along with getting some other things incorrect. Even if the amounts of consumables in this thread are correct, and I believe they are if you want to be in a guild that is actually trying, the amounts of gold being mentioned are far higher then a vanilla-like server would be. A low pop server in vanilla with ~2-3 raid guilds would have Flask values in gold at roughly a quarter of some of the values quoted in this thread. Meaning vendor forming for a couple of hours a week would be sufficient to pay outright for all your consumes. 
---
Also not to put to fine a point on it but really good guilds use the position of the guild to make money and that income is always far in excess of what consumables cost. At the end of vanilla our guild had over 100k gold banked and millions of gold in consumables/mats. We provided all consumables and had a weekly repair stipend for all raiders and we literally could not find ways to spend more, so the bank just kept growing.
---
Why do you even need area loot? Looting a bunch of dead mobs is pretty satisfying on it's own. I've never thought "Oh, I wish I didn't have all this invaluable treasure lying around that I have to **pick up** with my **hands**."
---
Another bug that has never been fixed afaik was the Druid T3 perk to give your regrowth targets more health. Not too important as very few ppl will have this, but it has ever been an unfixed bug.
---
Okay, lol that helps
---
But you now know no damaging arcane or fire abilities. Thankfully, I don't think anything has permanent resists to specific magic types anymore. 
---
Frost mage non-frost spells in retail: conjure refreshment, counterspell, invisibility, polymorph, teleport/portal, remove curse, blink, slow fall, spell steal, time warp, 
---
Although a frost mage will find all of those in the frost section of his spell book
---
Im serious. Its a bad pic. I dont know why people here are acting like the old models are near as good as new ones.
---
&gt;@ all the people saying the right one looks better
---
no ones saying this. majority can tell that the left is better
---
slap a Classic label on the original and mob mentality will praise it
---
Resist me once, okay that happens.   
---
Resist me twice, omg such bad luck  
---
Resist me thrice, what the fuck omg i'm dead
---
Arcane and fire do have one non-arcane/fire damaging spell: frost nova, which does 80 damage on my 112 mage
---
Thats a great idea! Loot trading only when given by a Lootmaster. But even then it could be problematic on loot systems. On the other hand it makes it a lot easier, if you had to talk to a GM otherwise.
---
Sometimes we shouldn't let it as it was and don't change a running system. It mostly worked fine how it had been in classic.
---
ya, nah
---
slap a classic label on vanilla and it gets upboats
---
thats all it really boils down to, ppl want the new to be better
---
I think you legit have mental issues.I'm worried for you
---
Agreed
---
Anyone else never get the scholo key and instead just killed themselves at the gate to get in?
---
according to the upboats, the left (vanilla) looks better 
---
I'm pretty sure vw quest is race specific but the ones after that are shared.
---
I want more content. I hope the time machine wielding gnome from the classic announcement is actually a Caverns of Time agent and they actually somehow work the timeline into the wider WOW lore. Like, we’re in an alternate timeline.... the Keepers of Time augment things to not follow the previous path and it opens the storyline to new horizons. say there’s a cut scene of a goblin Keeper of Time agent standing on Azuremyst isle with an engineered MANPADS and launches a rocket at the Exodar before it lands... I’m sure blizzard would actually do that, but you get the idea, keep the world as it is and create new conflicts within the already established content. 
---
The mater of which race makes a better warlock isn't just simply orc or bust.. IMO undead is what you want.  I never had any issues dueling 1v1 against any class except for other warlocks.  Having wotf makes you the most unstoppable god monster on the world if you are heavily geared.  Orc is better if you are running shadlow link and aren't geared to the teeth, but undead is superior at higher gear levels when you can easily get away with using the succubus.
---
&gt; MC: 1 hour
---
I find that extremely hard to believe even with the most well equipped group.
---
I guess most people 'passed' the test then and aren't "blind haters"? :p
---
So let me get this straight. The entire dev team in a media conference with slides, where they said ease of the class was intentional lied to the media, the gamers and the public for 14 years all to hide that Ret was actually a hard spec made for geniuses.
---
The video about Scientology on South Park was more believable. 
---
One thing is for sure. Kevin is a liar. I just choose to not also label all the other devs liars to. Only Classicast viewers would believe that. Then again they don't even know some of these "Vanilla god's \*cough\* Blizzard influencers didn't clear a raid until WOTLK.
---
I remember this from back in the day. Good luck on your search.
---
Prepare to be downvoted. Delusional people don't like the truth. Oh and they will say you are mentally disturbed as well. The projection here is real.
---
 Rogue melts people early because of how strong Fiery Weapon and Crusader are. He also has all his basic tools (well, Stealth as well as his basic combo and some CC) at level 19. I struggle to think of any better class.
---
holy. fucking. shit. I'm so dumb, why have I never done that before.
---
Ret Paladin tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. "Blizzard leads all lied in 2005 and kept lying for 14 years and even made slides to lie and lied to media, their fans and gamers all to hide that Ret Paladin was actually a class designed for geniuses".
---
LOL at this clown calling Kevin a liar, but also the entire WoW dev team, marketing team, media team, all because he believes some sunshine blown up Esfand's arse.
---
Initial BOE gear || epic mount &gt; stockpile consumables for current raid &gt; begin slowly working on consumables and resist gear for upcoming content &gt; begin building gold surplus as much as possible.

I wouldn't say it is super easy to micromanage Blessings, such as timing BoF/BoP etc well be it in PvE or PvP. Performing adequately is easy as a Paladin, yes, but there was plenty of room to be great regardless, just like any other class.
---
Had a lot of fun on  a 29 fire mage and 19 druid.
---
Very nice. Kinda reminds me of Terraria.
---
And that's why it's important to stop these people from trying to ruin that.
---
Initial thoughts after hearing the music:
---
wat
---
Thoughts after hearing "I'M GOING TO RAPE YOU":
---
I just wish they let judgement of the crusader stack, one from each paladin who judged it so the daage a ret could do would be amplified by how many you had in a raid. Oh well...
---
Can you explain to me what that is?  
---
HAHAHA. People that try to get a class changed that Blizzard said they won't change, while also holding to a conspiracy theory that all the Blizzard leads lied about paladin class design don't have mental issues, but I do?
---
Have fun with Alliance losing every PUG BG outside AV again. Just like in real vanilla. Ret Paladins running around blessing of freedom on themselves, never cleansing, never offhealing, never bubbling healers or casters. 
---
It's gonna be hilarious. Make sure to blame the racials again.
---
&gt;  The entire dev team in a media conference with slides, where they said ease of the class was intentional lied to the media 
---
No. Do you have a learning disability? lol... Let me give you an example to help you understand... A video game is designed by MANY people, HUNDREDS of people... There is the direct team, then an exterior team composed of a lot of contractors. A game like WoW takes A LOT of people to develop and design. Producer, publisher, development team, designers, artists, programmers, sound techs, ETC ETC ETC... You are the guy tasked with creating media release right? Now to be clear, your job is to give them information WHILE also avoiding giving them very specific items that need to be kept under wraps... So what do you do? You go to each branch and talk to people right? You start to collect information. BUT understand that each of these individual branches have their OWN design goals. Thats right, they arent operating as one giant collective, instead they have their own goals and deadlines and their own creative liberties... 
---
In fact John Statts goes into great length speaking off all the creative liberties he had when it came to level design. But Statts also missed the mark on a TON of information! Was he intentionally lying? NO! He is a subject matter expert in HIS field AND even within his field, he was ONLY concerned with projects that HE was responsible for. So why does this matter? Because Rob is taking all of this information, from all of these sources and filtering it down... He missed the mark. Somewhere a long the line there was a misunderstanding. No one intentionally lied. Why would they? What would be the incentive to lie... We have the final product. Mages are the easiest class in PVE. By a fairly wide margin I might add... But its okay, the final product turned out great! Its why were all here right. Stop being so creepy and dramatic... Who cares what classes were difficult and which ones werent? Vanilla is easy period, but its still worth playing. Now quit being such a social weirdo and just talk to us about our shared passion; Classic.
---
I need to ask people in here because my knowledge of twinking is complete garbage.  
---
What bracket is the best bracket to make a twink ret paladin?  
---
I rarely hear of twink paladins, but I want to make one. What bracket should I use?  
---
Confirmed either mental problems, or a decent bot. Not sure which. 
---
It do
---
Huh? Youre the one implying someone lied... I mentioned that there was clearly a misunderstanding before the media release. What incentive would anyone have to lie? We have the final design... We can SEE that mages are the easiest class... By a fairly wide margin. 
---
You are all getting so mad and mass downvoting actual Blizzard panels from 2005 to escape reality. While accusing other people of mental problems. Keep on projecting. Remember to blame those racials when you lose all those PUG BG's with other ret heroes who cast blessing of freedom on themselves. Always have to blame something.

No but you do.
---
When a lot of players didn’t even have 16 slot bags, this made an insane difference to a lot of people. I remember when this came in and I wasn’t even doing 5 man dungeons anymore but I was still pumped. 
---
This basically gave all of your bags a few extra slots and played into the game world fantasy and made you feel cool. There is literally no downside to it.
---
Thats a lazy response.
---
hmmm... To each their own. I guess I was a bit more experience with MMO's at the time. The subtle stuff like this was just filler for me. Was far more concerned with the actual game. I didn't say there was a downside by the way, just that I was indifferent. The keyring has its place but its not a pivotal part of what made Vanilla great either... For me at least.
---
Ele Shaman 49 twink, back when Six Demon Bag also scaled with Spell power.
---
Shit was so cash.
---
Good post. Its so damn true.
---
All of the things you listed really just contribute to the community of the game. Which is the best community in any game I've ever played.
---
Let's get it on (And please no shared-loot it will fuck the game up big time!!!)!
---
Try as you may, people are going to choose their classes based on minor criteria. It's inevitable. I've tried.  
---
Some people with raid dreams will avoid a class because of a slow leveling experience, even though the % of time you spend leveling goes down as you continue to play and remains a constant static amount of time spent post-60.  
---
All the leads in a presentation to the fans and media saying one thing iin concert in 2005 isn't "lazy". Not accepting that is simply delusion/mental illness which is why you are all projecting that on to me, while calling for class changes to a 2004 game so that you can be OP or something, thinking you will be relevant? Who knows. Anyone can lead dps. Make a fury warrior. Doesn't make it OP in PVP. It's just a stupid number in content we already have done and most are only doing to get gear to PvP with where we actually use more than a couple abilities.
---
IMO I wouldn't give a #%F# if they handed us the gear. I just care about trying to make it good for the people who actually care about PVE and keep some of the challenge that was there.
---
I don't give a F#@% about raiding. The only hard core raiding I ever did was to 1) get pvp gear in old WoW. 2) sell carries for tokens/gold 3) I usually did that in Arena instead. 
---
Just because I was good at arena doesn't mean I think arena should be in WoW. Get it yet? You are selfish, ignorant pricks, and I just want the game to resemble the beautiful game that was released.
---
Yes I know that's the BC launcher
---
Afford Living Action Potions and Flasks in world PVP just to flex
---
&gt; Not accepting that is simply delusion/mental illness 
---
Your episode today, has the stench of a manic episode. So i'd be careful trying to diagnose others creep. Haha.
---
&gt; why you are all projecting that on to me 
---
Because you are the issue. If 1 person disagrees with you, that would be one thing. But look at the stats. Whats more likely? WE all have mental issues and are delusional, or that you may be a bit off?
---
The post seems to trail off and get a bit weird... Its hard to follow. 
---
&gt; You are selfish, ignorant pricks, and I just want the game to resemble the beautiful game that was released. 
---
Are we? I want you to really read that statement and then do some introspective thinking. Let yourself be vulnerable and really take some time to assess who the prick is... I think you may surprise yourself.
---
Already been answered as no. The current bnet client will be used. 
---
You will meld shadows as a hunter in pvp.
---
Yea. Fair points... Just seems so crazy to me with the immense amount of time this game requires... I can see an argument for choosing based on aesthetics, but the visuals of the starting zone? Yikes... That seems REALLY short-sighted.
---
You get out of them in not a lot of time (2-3 hours) so I don't factor it in much. I consider the races themselves more than the zones.
---
I personally like Durotar. I really enjoyed the Warcraft 3 mission where you play as Rexxar and build Orgrimmar. It was cool being able to fight the same thunder lizards and harpy's. Made me feel like a young orc soldier gearing up to help the horde. Tirisfal is still really good for atmosphere.

&gt; welfare rank 14 gear
---
bro i think after a certain point it stops being ''welfare'' if it's something you literally can't obtain if you have a job or are a student without destroying your social life and/or account sharing
---
also since when are you the expert who gets to decide which features implemented in vanilla are ''vanilla enough''
---
Not true at all. Naming someone who is a thief isn’t doing anything other than stating a fact. They endangered their own gaming experience when they made the CHOICE to endanger the gaming experience of their group by being trash.
---
Nothing saying the bnet client couldn't be _themed_ like the old WoW launcher though. I mean, I doubt it. But it would be cool.
---
welp, I'm stealing that

How freaking epic would that be

Doing MC in a little more than an hour is pretty reasonable for a guild with BWL on farm that doesn't take long to distribute loot.
---
Thanks for the laughs man.
---

---
So you arent wrong... But you are misinformed... Concerning racial picks from a pure min/max perspective Undead is better for PVE and Orc is better for PVP. 
---
&gt; isn't just simply orc or bust 
---
Agreed. But there is an OPTIMAL choice. Though, ALL choices are viable...
---
&gt; Having wotf makes you the most unstoppable god monster on the world if you are heavily geared. 
---
Quite the opposite. Horde will be about 40-45% UD. They were in retail and they are on private. Due to this, warlocks and priests on alliance side are at a significant disadvantage as they are racially countered by almost half of their opponents. Due to this, prevalent PvPers on the alliance side are less inclined to choose warlocks or priests. This inherently devalues WoTF as their are LESS warlocks and priests.
---
So. As an undead you will counter FAR less of your opponents than as an Orc with hardiness...
---
WoTF will counter Warrior fear on a long CD, Priest AoE fear and Warlock fear. But you will face less warlocks and priests in pvp than any other class on alliance side in high level pvp.
---
Some of things hardiness counters include, cheap shot, kidney, charge, intercept, intimidation (hunter), concuss stun, hammer of justice (paladin), mage stun, blackout shadow priest, bear stun (druid), warstomp, grenade, tidal charm...
---
Another thing to consider is your pvp trinket. In vanilla they are all different. You already HAVE an answer to fear, you DONT have an answer to stuns. And there are more stuns... WAY more stuns. And the classes that have fears are less populated on your opposing faction... Lets look at your trinket as a lock...
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=18858](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18858)
---
 Use: [Dispels all Charm, Fear and Polymorph effects.](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=23273) (cooldown 5 min) 
---
 As a Warlock, you already have methods of dispelling fears and charms  via your Felhunter, Spellstone, PVP Trinket (above). You get literally nothing to defend  yourself from Stuns. 
---
Many high level PvPers will actually run Engi / Blacksmith for Glimmering Mithril Insignia which is very arguably BETTER than WoTF for many reasons - namely the 30 second immunity to fear.
---
 [https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=10418](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=10418)
---
All of this considered, Hardiness is simply better than WoTF. This doesnt even factor in the fact that its 25%... Or the fact that it has no internal cooldown... Or the fact that the classes designed to counter you USE stuns, not fears... Or the fact that you dont need to use a global to use hardiness, its just an incredibly strong passive... I mean, Orc is simply superior for pvp from an objective and informed standpoint.
---
I am NOT suggesting everyone should go Orc. BUT, it would be ignorant to say that a player should choose anything else for PvP IF they intend to min/max.
---
Good luck Ben. Most of the people from that era don’t play anymore cuzz reasons. 
---
Ok, so nobody believes you because you blurred the other names and have no real proof. And you risk getting reddit banned from whatever sub for naming and shaming if against their rules.
---
&gt; In the end, it will be fun to smash these kids in STV, so all the power to them I guess.  
---
I'm pretty excited for this feature. People who haven't played vanilla since it was current game vs people who have been playing vanilla for the past 4 years non-stop.  
---
I hope someone releases a "noob killer" montage video of them killing the worst players they come across. Keyboard turners. People who are stopped dead in their tracks because they don't know how to respond to what's happening.  
---
"Longneck Bois" 😂
---
Haha... Yea. Or all the creative builds we will see while people are still bright eyed and bushy tailed... Before they are unable to play their characters for a week or two and are forced to conform to the meta or be eternal world pvp victims... I guess a lot of these turds will probably roll PVE too though.
---
That video just pissed me off. If any of it is true, his excuse for not giving paladins a taunt is "we wanted something more complex, but we didn't know what we wanted to do, so we didn't give them a taunt like warriors had because we would have had to take it away and people would be angry"
---
Are you *fucking serious*? If that's true, that's the most short-sighted bullshit fucking excuse for "we didn't do our research and we didn't play the class enough, and we ignored community feedback"
---
No sweat =)
---
No
---
at least my humans and orcs didn't look so stupid when they ran before that dumb update
---
there's a reason for that... ret pallies don't get their fun stuff until higher levels, and even then, it's not all that fun.
---
Repentance, Cleanse, and Hammer of Wrath are ALL post 40 abilities, and if you want to be any good as a ret, you should be using all of them.
---
so... 49, maybe? though that's not much of a twink.
---
Just long enough to keep you from playing with them, but 4-5k times too short to stop them from getting groups. Figure 2500 cap on server, there will be 3-4 times that number total players overall and none of them care that someone ninja'd you. And the few who do care, probably don't believe you anyway.
---
Great story. Good read. 10/10

They still look better. The old models, especially the face look awful. For example the new dwarf model is soooo much better.

for a second i thought this was Space Cop
---
39 or 49 anything,
---
19 bracket is 60% or more of your team being rogues/hunters + whatever else trickles in.
---
29 bracket same thing except you might see some warlocks mages and druids more often.
---
39 &amp; 49 pretty much anything goes since all the classes have most of their toolkit available.
---
So with that being said I prefer 39-49 brackets for the variety
---
Some DPS specs have 3 sets of azerite gear now. For raid ST, raid MT, and M+.
---
He was saying drain life is not strong because if you're not using voidwalker, then you'll be receiving casting time knockback/interrupts as a result of taking damage.
---
At the end of the day, a game like ffvii and WoW differ so vastly in business practice that they can't be compared parallel in terms of how they're sold and maintained. There's definitely merit to say let's keep classic wow classic. But we can't just say with such conviction and expect Blizzard to maintain a stagnant game for 10 years regardless of monetary gains or losses. As long as it's profitable, we will see it, and then some. As soon as it declines, something has to, and will change. What will / should that look like? 
---
I didn't read the lines like that. Regardless of what pet is used, drain life is always strong for reasons already stated. No spec would rather use food than drain life 
---
Having played a holy paladin at 49 and seen how classes in the bracket play out compared to the 39 bracket I agree with Dinsdale, if you're going to twink a ret paladin do it at level 49. However before rolling ret paladin I would ask why you are rolling ret paladin to make sure its a good fit. Ret paladins are not good DPS, but can still be an ok addition to a team if geared and played as support DPS, still would be much better off as holy though. Good mix of str/int/stam, throwing out cleanses and blessings to their team mates while they auto attack.
---
Isn't that essentially letting someone pay to win?
---
19 - Dwarf Warrior - Stoneform + high armor shield. Makes rogues and hunters hit like sissy girls + immune to poison.
---
I mostly like the "last forever" aspect of paladins mainly because I lack that in my sex life.  
---
I want to twink a paladin because I don't want to focus super hard one a paladin at level 60. The competition at 60 is more "fair" which means I'll fall behind super easily as an alt. The reason a lot of people twink is because it's not necessarily fair how powerful you are. Same reason I want to.  
---
I agree with you I have desktop currently but I barely use it...
---
Wow classic should be very playable on any modern mid range laptop.
---
I like to have couple of monitors at my work desktop tho.
---
200g in consumes wasted per wipe
---
I think one problem with Paladins is how low their ceiling is. It's hard for a really damn good paladin to stand out vs. a great one. But a great rogue or a great mage can definitely show how much better they are than an average one.
---
This is not true lol. Dark age of Camelot might not have been super popular but had more difficult melee than wow. was a big MMO at the time. Also WoW was not hard at the time, it was seen as easy and forgiving compared to other MMOs
---
I use my laptop with my 3 24" monitors no issues there.
---
Ahhhhh I forgot about the old launcher! The feels. 
---
In some ways it kinda makes sense from 2 different design perspectives. #1, well, having a wizard with lots of buttons to press makes sense and having a big lunk with an axe only a couple makes sense. But then #2 maybe the ideas on how to make melee classes and gameplay more engaging just weren't there. They didn't know how to make it more fun or interesting.
---
The devs have also said that they want to give us the best possible experience of everything in vanilla from everything that was in 2004-2006 WoW.
---
2 hour bg queues on servers that have massive imbalances does not constitute a good experience. If you actually bothered to read my post you'd see that I suggest, to protect that community experience/feeling, that they have small battlegroups. That the queue systemonly starts searching beyond your server one server at a time and only after an allotted amount of time. The example I gave was 10 minutes.
---
This won't effect 95% of servers, all it will do is make things better for players on those 5% of servers that have a huge imbalance between the factions.
---
And higher repair bill on plate.
---
Yeah they're obviously different game. Just using it as an example. There will be decline for sure, but there will still be a lot of people hanging onto the game. It could be a solution of them having 20 servers at launch, but going down to 5 or something. Classic is pretty dang old at this point and there are still servers with heavy population. I think there will be plenty of people willing to sub for Classic over the next 10+ years, but like you said, we'll have to wait and see what happens.
---
uh yeah. If the instance just opened, how would there be enough coins and stuff floating around?
---
Dont ever not play what you want because of 1 zone. Especially the 1-10 zone you only spend a few hours in anyway
---
I miss the sound the play button would make
---
This tbh. First off I think a beta is important to feeling out what is and isn’t important to fix. But second, I think there are some bugs that almost came to be “features” as opposed to bugs. I’m almost sure they realize this and I think that they’ll be fixing most of them, but if something was integral to the vanilla authenticity I suspect it’ll be sticking around. 
---
Seems like something that could be modded if somebody gave enough of a shit 
---
They already said that classic WoW is a museum piece, which pretty much means that they won't touch the game post-Naxx. So you're most likely good.
---
I have also thought about joining a group that does hardcore runs when classic WoW is "done", just to have something to do for a few months if you're bored. You can't buy anything from AH, you can't trade people, etc etc. It would be interesting in actual vanilla WoW and not these retail project 60 events.
---
Isn't that appliable to all the classes (and blizz games in general)?
---
Oof.
---
You can get a decent graphical boost if you turn up the graphics. This likely compares the "Classic mode" with authentic vanilla.
---
literally played when this exact photo was the launcher lol i remember it 
---
I think it's necessary on Blizzards end. They don't have the GM staff to handle loot issues anymore so I don't think there's much we can do a out it. 
---
I didn't end up running scholo for the first time until a bit after the BC launch and at the time, nobody I grouped with even knew how tf to get the key. We thought corpse jumping was just how you did it. 
---
I mean at this point we might as well bust out the CRT monitors... 
---
&gt; Either you're happy with changes or you want 1.0 as it was at launch. 
---
Yes I would LOVE to start at the first vanilla patch and have a true authentic historical progression with the client, talents and content be updated. Unfortunately that will never be possible because the authentic data pre-patch 1.12.1 is forever lost... So I will accept Classic Vanilla 1.12.1 client and talents and Blizzard are free to use any content from within Vanilla patches. As long as they don't use any features from outside Vanilla I will be a satisfied customer.
---
Bot confirmed
---
I don't really understand what people have against loot sharing. Assuming they implement the exact system that exists in retail WoW right now (I don't see why they would develop a different system) that means that only BoP loot that you roll GREED on can be traded with members of your group. NEED loot is still instantly bound and permanently untradable. 
---
Seriously its such a small change and if Blizzard says it seriously reduces GM tickets to have greeded loot be tradabale for an hour, then whatever. 
---
Succubus for faster solo kills early or vw if OK micro managing and chain pulling can be more stable and controlled but still imp/suc both viable, once dark pact keep imp in shift + get imp pet Mana + drain life/syphon life = 0 down time capabilities.
---
Iv lvled 3 locs using drain tanking grinding majority of the time, iv spent 1000s of gold on respecs, checked dmg meters, times grinding, downtime/resources used and drain tanking always the most efficient.
---
I'd advise stacking alot stam and +shadow, keeping first aid max, soul shard bag, good wand and ideally I keep tailoring up for likes of robe of power and later robe of void.
---
But it will require a more tentative play style and risk then boring slow blueberry (later DS VW or VW sac/chain pull for dots can be viable)
---
Don't be a weak hunter be a Warlock! 
---
Outside of Suppression Room, why indeed, but the reality is that just killing bosses isn't the only thing. You then need to loot and equip the gear to make the next raid tier efficient, as well. If you run 25 Fury Warriors, it'll take over *two years* to gear them all on average. Whereas if you run a healthier balance of classes, you can gear an entire raid out in ~3 months. So sure, a fully equipped raid of 25 Fury Warriors might be optimal in a vacuum, the balanced raid will be done gearing in less than a quarter of the time.
---
The content will be clearable regardless, so honestly running a raid composition that makes the most efficient statistical use of loot is optimal. A friend and I are working on a simulator for this, to figure out what is actually the optimal raid composition based on how many raids it takes to gear everyone. Spoiler: it still doesn't involve meme specs, but also involves more Warlocks then what is considered strictly optimal (i.e., more than 2) and doesn't completely cut out Rogues either! 
---
Dude, blizz could re-balance every class, drop naxx craft gear and all world buffs day 1 and vanilla would still thrive.
---
Why?
---
Because you are talking about the less then 1% that this will impact. The very same people who are bashing away at pservers and will continue to do so after classic comes out due to these changes.
---
If anything it will help classics longevity since the 99% the are casuals are the ones that will keep classic afloat, not the 0,1% of pserver asshats that want to dictate everyone elses fun that dont give a shit about a raid race that ended 13 years ago. 
---
Ooph.
---
Could you imagine another 15 years from now? “Wow classic has become too different from the original wow classic! We demand WoW Classic: Classic!”
---
This.
---
It bafels me that so few points out these obvious bullshit things the pserver crowd loves so fondly. It is a rush emulator If anything and are enjoyed by the 0,1% who still thinks people give a shit if they win a dead raid race on a dead pserver that can't even release naxx because of the shitty "freash" meme.
---
Pservers ain't a vanilla experience, it's min/max emulator 
---
Hunter was my main in Vanilla, will probably be my "main" in Classic (mostly because I want to get all the pet abilities out of the way).  
---
I will definitely agree that hunterlock feels weaker than hunter:
---
* Weaker "auto-attack"
---
* Weaker Pet, in terms of DPS and TPS
---
* Weaker heal
---
* More mana intensive high-damage rotation (that will likely pull aggro)
---
It's definitely nice to use from 10-24 (until you get Fel Concentration) but after that I feel Drain Tank is the way to go.  And even then I'm building towards it because of Imp Life Tap and instant Corruption.
---
My problem is not that the raid is more difficult with memes because I like a challenge. My problem is the entitlement of these players who don´t want to give up something in order to fit in a raid team. Someone specs for maximum pvp and solo farming efficiency and then expect others to carry them in the raid, that´s a problem. 
---
Red=dead
---
left one looks better
---
You state that name and shame has a VERY limited reach.  But how big does the reach need to be?  Only big enough to affect you and the people you care about.  You and your guildies put the person on ignore and never deal with them again.  As a public service, you also inform the server and they can take or leave your advice as they see fit.
---
I was basically saying that shame and blame does work, because you only get burned by the same guy once.  Your guildies are protected and the server gets a heads up.
---
But what about their lvl. Same if that’s red too?
---
No, the logic holds if you're using that list as a reference.  You cant seriously think that drek is really 2.5 times more difficult than van.   If drek is harder than Van, it's by 2 or 4%.  Not 250%.  
---
This launcher was so much better and more atmospheric. 
---
If it’s an enemy I kills it 
---
I’d say that is their mantra for many of their titles. In classic though, I wouldn’t say that every class is easy to play. It’s all subjective. I was just putting in my two cents on what the development team was trying to convey from the slide. 
---
I usually leave most alone, unless it’s a cow. All cows must die. Any place, any level, any time
---
They Will be the 0,1% that will constant shit talk in trade chat and think the game is built solely for them. And it can be if they all started to pay 99,9 times more of the monthly fee to keep classic afloat.
---
Would honestly be nice if this sub right out banned these toxic asshats since they can go to the pserver reddit and be in their little echo chamber and think that people give a shit about a 13 year old dead raid race. 
---
That's a TBC meme. Accurate though
---
&gt;as Holy with all your Blessings and Judgements
---
If you're talking about raid:
---
Two paladins in raid will judge light or wisdom
---
Keep Buffs up
---
Bop the mages when you're assigned
---
Bop anyone else if they pull aggro
---
HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO DELUSIONAL- JUST BECAUSE ITS EASY DOESN'T MEAN YOU CANT ENJOY IT
---
It's an old meme, but I feel it's fairly timeless. :P
---
Well, I didn't choose my characters future on just the first 2-5 hours of gameplay or even aesthetics. It was more venting than anything, and curiosity about the extent that others base their character choices on those and similar factors. 
---
i leveld in vanila 
---
voidwalker is safebet as everyone said BUT i used sucubus for extra damage dont remember why i used it over void walker i think it was just better at dealing damage and was quicker to go from mob to mob but i cannot remember it was in 2005 :(

He's also acting like they weren't spending all there time fixing much more important stuff. My guess is at the time they didnt think it wise to fix because the shaman tank spec didnt pan out either. The alliance already had huge legs up on the horde in pve. I am basically saying they didn't fix this for the same reason they didn't fix AV for the horde. They had bigger fish to fry at the time. Then giving more to a faction for something they were already dominant in. Imagine if they fixed tremor totem for shamans lol. It would have been cruel lol. 
---
Because it is most likely, given the way Ion was talking about it, going to be all loot regardless of need or greed is going to be trad-able. This isn't a new system it was the one they had in  Wrath. Greed only isn't going to really reduce loot tickets.
---
Definitely 'feels' more WoW for sure.
---
Once it popped up, those borders were screaming World of Warcraft.
---
Dude that would be amazing, but since they have already stated that they want it to be integrated into the modern social bnet system i highly doubt it
---
I'm willing to imagine there will be a 3rd party launcher with the old theme that points to the WoW.exe. Would be fun and nostalgic.
---
1) Don't PVP
---
It seems to me that they tried to base the paladin in vanilla on the paladin heroes in Warcraft 3 (they had Holy Light, Divine Shield, Devotion Aura and Resurrection, basically zero offensive ability outside of using Holy Light on undeads), and people wanted the paladin to be more like Diablo 2. And I can kinda see where they're coming from a faction perspective too, where the shaman is meant to be the more offensive counterpart (with more ranged damage spells) of the paladin which is more defensive (with more tank abilities), the brutality of the Horde vs the stoicness of the Alliance. But at the same time, it would have been nice to have shamans be more raid viable as dps and paladins be more raid viable as tank or offtanks to properly represent that. But I guess they didn't want factions to have more tank/dps choices than the other either.
---
Ultimately, it really seems like raids were what shifted the perspectives of the classes over time, because dungeons sure as heck didn't have those problems.
---
I plan on waiting until they give any details on how they plan on implementing it before bringing out pitchforks.
---
Nothing better to try for a new highest crit on 
---
The middle ground is use consumables when you're right on the edge for an encounter and use it to push you over.
---
&gt; There are 3 rooms with different mechanics in each that are additive. so the mechanics in room 1 are also in room 2. Then room 2 adds in more mechanics. Room 3 has both room 1 and 2s mechanics while adding even more. There are winds that push you into fire that will kill you. Fire on the ground spawning often that will likely kill you if alone, if you are stacked on others you will be hit by their fire as well. There are adds, that have to be silenced and killed quickly. There is raid wide damage that hits the whole raid when people go from one room to another. Lasers that go across the room that you have to avoid, else you'll die. Then finally in room 3 there even more lasers from the sky, timed with the side lasers we have to avoid. Oh I also forgot the boss has a front AoE the tank has to move out of and position out of the raid.
---
Isn't all of that just "stay out of the fire"?
---
&gt; I remember legit 2 shotting every single mob in strat live with a lighting bolt + a shock or a chain + a shock
---
Huh.
---
swap the logos and it'd get downvoted because ppl dont want to be hopeful
---
Restricting Loot Trading to raids would solve a lot of the issues.
---
Crazy how he does this on a ptr on GM island and not ingame.
---
It's almost as if he can't fight people with the same gear and / or people don't give people who aren't famous this kind of gear on a ret paladin.
---
take away the "its brand new" and most realize vanilla is &gt;
---
me kill humies and stunties.
---
Forgot to mention you're playing on a private server, don't want people to get the idea that this is directly transferable to Classic.
---
most people would prefer vanilla over classic but we only get one option
---
You just have to find a guild who's on the same page as you.  If you only have 4 hours per week to raid you can find a casual guild who does 2 short raids or one long raid per week.. or a guild that is willing to take ringers on various nights of the week and bring you along.  Plenty of people will be trying to make casual guilds like this work.  The progress will be slow, but bosses will get killed and loot will be had, you just have to find the right people to work with.
---
I don't really see how that's relevant. I didn't particularly like walking in perpetual fog because the draw distance was so small back then either. Didn't really have much to compare it to in terms of textures and lighting so didn't really think of that back then, but damn, dude, why wouldn't you want to see Vanilla with today's technology improvements. It'd be awesome.
---
But waz about dem knaife earz?
---
vanilla wins the pepsi challenge over classic
---
parts of classic will be a downgrade but ppl wont want to admit it
---
I like that answer sir.
---
Don't mess with them unless attacked or griefed first. Then I'll corpse camp the shit out of them.
---
If a friend or guildy calls for aid, I'll travel across the world to fight for them. 
---
LOYALTY!
---
There was no running and hiding, you couldnt escape it.
---
You can use the succubus if you are in a safe area.  You should use voidwalker if you're at risk of:
---
* Pulling a group of mobs
---
* Aggroing a patrol
---
* Getting ganked
---
blueberry offers a lot in terms of functional utility while leveling and just generally not having to run back from the graveyard as much.  The mini game with the vw is finding a balance between aggro, your mana, your hp, and the vw mana as your skill levels change as you level.
---
Simple. Now it ruins random groups. Just look for groups without competition 
---
Vanilla Players: Vanilla was so much better, because people cared about their reputation. People were a lot nicer to each other and didn't do jerk things because they wouldn't get invited to groups.
---
Also Vanilla Players: If we let people circumvent GMs to trade loot, people will constantly be ninja looting and I'll never get any loot because people are all untrustworthy assholes and nothing will stop them anymore.

Level 8 paladin looks like a lot of fun imo.
---
lol he was also the class dev all the way up to wotlk and that seems to be where a lot of peoples favourite classes are. honestly i think he did a good job but thats just me. he had to come up with all the ideas of how the specs would play and apprently at the time there was nothing like wow abilities
---
Hey Ben/OP,
---
I was there when it happened on my server on Dethecus. It was absolute pandemonium and corpses were everywhere. Many bank alts were lost that day...
---
I threw a couple HoT's on myself and bolted into a corner of Orgrimmar until I was sure most of the carnage was over. Walked back to the auction house and it looked like a ghost town. Pretty funny all things considered.
---
I see why not
---
To be fair, I actually do really think it was important for gear to have the player crafter's name on it. Not only did it improve the immersion of the server, but it also made me a shit load of money when I was the only horde player on my server that had the pattern for the Hide of the Wild. I made a lot of money from "referrals" and it was one of the reasons why I actually had an easier time in vanilla than some of my guildies raiding because I always had cash for consumables.
---
I exclusively twink 39+, as the moveset is too small to really entertain me otherwise. I used to have a 39 Rogue and 49 Disc Priest twink. The Priest was my favourite, people just don't really expect a twink healer and get all excited, it's great.
---
If a low level player starts world pvp, he can finish it on his own. If he loses, he shouldn't have started it and hopefully he'll learn from his mistake for next time.
---
Survival of the fittest. Wow Darwinism.
---
You should roll a twink healer. Not only do you last forever, but you'll make other people last forever too.
---
Make a bunch of arcane bombs. People are never expecting to get hit with them, and they are brutal in group pvp. I made 18 of them last time I was on a private server for av weekend one time. They are hilarious 
---
wiped the horde in van's throne room by lobbing an arcane bomb on their bunched up casters one time. They are also hysterical to use in 1 vs 1. Attacked a lock and reflected his death coil. Then he tried to fear me and I scattered, then feigned death the next attempt, then arcane bombed him. He had to have been really pissed, lmfao
---
If it’s a low level, you kill them and move on. If it’s equal footing you wait until they finish their mob, you show yourself and wait until they are 100%. 1 rematch if it was a close one then move on. If they acknowledge you and keep farming then too bad, kill them and move on.
---
Camping is no fun
---
vanilla wins the pepsi challenge 
---
Can confirm. It took me too long to discover talent points while leveling.
---
It he's drain tanking he doesn't care about ripping agro off his void.
---
it's being hosted on [battle.net](https://battle.net) so no.
---
I always gank warlocks and hunters. I'm going to play a hunter.
---
I do most of the same as OP, but except I'll still gank during a mob pull. I generally don't gank at all at the spot I'm farming/questing though, i.e. I don't shit where I eat. Unless they're about to kill a dude I need that wont respawn for a while and I have no other business in the area.
---
Just further proof that muh #nochanges ppl are mentally challenged.
---
This is why I don't tell people I'm ganking.
---
"Getting corpse camped by 4 people for no reason"
---
"Ok, I'll help... wait. You were ganking them, you deserved it"
---
Always two there are; no more, no less. A hunter and a pet.
---
First i doubt that there are any... 
---
probably workstation laptop which: 
---
A: costs arm and leg and is probably overkill for anyone ... take a look at surface design studio...
---
B: it ins't very portable
---
First i want to address fanboys and "gamers" in here. Laptops are just fine. For multiple reasons. 
---
Number1 being that most of the new games that require 1080ti to be played are actually shit... they serve to promote and sell GPUs and CPUs to the "gamer" community more often then not ... i would say even almost always... basically just eye candy with not substance. 
---
If new game comes out and it doesn't focus on having 1080ti as minimum requirement then it has potential to actually be good because it didn't get money from nvidia amd intel and isn't presured from big publishers to sell etc.
---
Most of those games will play fine on 10 year old hardware.
---
Now... laptops are fine. I would suggest that you go with 14 or 15" ultrabook laptop because those are pretty good compromise in terms that they aren't really gonna throttle and they are still very portable. 
---
When you are at home you can just hook it up to the 24 or 27 or bigger monitor and enjoy it fully. 
---
On the go if you are keeping it in your lap, you dont really want to keep "gaming" 17" laptop in your lap... it is nether comfortable nor very good nor it will actually be capable of gaming for prolonged period of time... 
---
now before fanboys that think they need 1080ti and vega64 with i9 CPU or ryzen7 come out of the wood work and say that no game can be played on ultrabook... i will just stop you there... yes d3 probably cant be played on the ultrabook and enjoyed just fine... but last i checked d2 Lord of destruction is still going strong with good moding community... starcraft brood war is more relevant then starcraftII and wowclassic is going to be way more relevant then piece of shit retail wow.  
---
There is plethora of "old" games that are still going strong and are both in many ways superior to the new games and work just fine on any modern hardware. 
---
I am working on 2013 latitude bussins laptop with i5 and no GPU, it plays LOD just fine and i think it will probably be decent for wow classic as well. When i am at home i hook it up one of my 24" monitors... everything works just fine. I use it for programing and some light data analysis tools. 
---
Anyway... i would suggest that you go with 14" or 15" laptops... or if you really have to go with 17" laptops (they will have better cooling etc). I would personally go with thinkpad... probably T series... you can get very nice used T series thinkpads... E series is very affordable as well. If you want to go with dell go with latitude ... again bussines line but will play older games including wow classic just fine. 
---
Sometimes if it is a low level I fuck with them and move on. Come here and let me see how long I can cc one person with fd/trap + rocket helm + fd/trap
---
You do if you are drain tanking effectively.  A lot of the times you'll drain tank one mob while you have the vw and your dots kill another.  Corruption and coa alone can take aggro at some skill rank combinations especially if you are playing it fast and loose with your vw's mana.  
---
I'm not a huge fan of drain tanking because even with improved lift tap and drain life talents you will still slowly wear your health and mana pools down to unsafe levels.  It's far better, imo, to get improved drain soul and use that to keep your hp and mana high.  This is of course my experience playing on a pvp server where you don't want to let your resources dip too low and become easy prey.
---
I WISH 
---
Well I already make my girl last forever so I'm not too worried about that.  
---
My rule is that if it’s a gnome I kill it. Other ally races just depends on my mood or if they’re being dicks.
---
Does the #NoChanges movement want to play on Kirkland Monitors too? 
---
Wasn't this launcher also a later addition to the game? 
---
well... the slash command isnt a private server thing. It existed in vanilla too and it logged you out of the game. It was a mirror command to /logout or /quit and it came from older mmorpgs.
---
Its the functionality when paired with resetting an instance thats under question. But the slash command was in from day 1.
---
Don't interrupt 1v1s.
---
Right looks terrible. 
---
I cant remember if it was available day 1. But I remember I never used it. Just used the WoW.exe instead.
---
&gt;paladin level slow meme
---
Mass pull green undead as prot/holy with a shield spike. Heal 5 man's on the way up to stay stacked on gear. Beat hunters in your guild to 60. 
---
That's how I remember playing as well. Each patch had its own downloader based on bittorent. 
---
Unless you play on a pve server... Then it just saves you 3-4 seconds. 
---
i remember this from back in the day. Guild mates would warn you on ventrilo about logging in because most of us would log out in major cities. I witnessed hunters running through stv and eventually moving onto SW. I played alliance. We had friends on horde side we'd do guild events with them and this is one thing they did one time. MANNNNN i miss that.
---
I'm not people in this sub actually have Checked what we know about classic... They just complain. 
---
If greed-only doesn't reduce tickets then it really confuses me why that is the system they use in WoW today. And even more confusing, why would they go back to Wrath's system when they previously decided to switch off of that system on to their current system.
---
My guild's favorite weapon for mass wpvp. Everybody carries a few of these and other on pvp raiding days and if we get a big engage we mass toss these out at the backline. Instant game over.
---
I'm not sure those you tubers carry that much wait... I say that as someone who likes there content but they are not magor players. 
---
make lowbies fight to the death for my scraps
---
Used to use this add on that would randomize questions and throw it into whatever chat you wanted.  Would rock it in gchat and we'd all participate and give each other gold for answering the questions correctly.  eventually we started taking it into trade chat and mailing gold to random people that would join in on the fun and answer correctly. I forget the add on but im sure someone here will englighten us. 
---
If I see a mage aoe farming, I drag additional mobs onto him.
---
If it's grey, do a driveby to continue the cycle of hate.
---
If it's a hunter, kill the pet first.
---
If it's a twinked warrior, or has whirlwind whatever before level ~37, kill it. If its undergeared let it live because leveling a warrior is more degrading and more suffering than being ganked.
---
If they are on an escort quest, always kill them.
---
If it's a female night elf hunter, or male undead mage, consider if camping until they log off if it won't get in the way of my day.
---
As I know someone who plays and Undead mage, this comment is chilling.
---
It wasn’t there on launch.  They added it later.
---
Launcher was very late vanilla iirc 
---
Longest playing, most dedicated guild member. Period. By that time, Rag is on farm and should be easy af for a dedicated guild anyways, why give it to anyone but the #1 tryharder? They kinda earn it via hours logged.
---
I used to rock herbalism and tailoring on my lock. Made a good amount of gold and was able to craft bloodvine gear which can take you up and into naxx. Since being in a guild theres a lot of people that take different professions which is benefitial for everyone. We'd all pool mats together make consumables for each other as long as we all provide materials we could all always be buffed for raids and go for long those long haul raid nights. Gold was usually saved for respeccing. Just find a good guild and gold to me was never really an issue, and of course having self sustaining professions helped that. 
---
Also it looks like the left has full-screen glow on and the right does not. 
---
The person who will make it.
---
Ignore as much world PVP as possible and rush to 60 ASAP.  
---
After 60, ignore as much World PVP as possible and work towards my goals.  
---
After goals, World PVP on main. Create alt to harass lowbies in one zone exclusively (probably Stonetalon) because I want to hurt the Horde's progress as much as I can. I'm also going to be replicating Verycoolguy's level 8 twink paladin because that looks like a blast.  
---
Make no mistake, the retarded rose-tinted circlejerk definitely exists, it's just a subset of the majority that actually just want a good game without the rest of this fluffy BS to relive their teenage years.
---
Whichever melee PvPer is the biggest suckup to the GM.
---
Wall jumping exploits in bgs should be patched. Ita pretry obvious that nobody should be able to get certain places to camp with a flag, or run into the back door of an enemy base without killing a single npc.
---
I was really sad to see the old launcher go, the sound the play button made and how much more appropriate it was to actually launch WoW of.
---
Now all we get is a silent, unpersonal, generic and blue "PLAY"... Totally not like blizzard could you know, let you use a custom theme or make a WoW theme :) Oh right, they think so little of the players they dont have a PvP vendor because they wont find it, LOL.
---
Side note, Micro transactions in a sub cost game with 12 MILLION players, thats like billions earned EVERY year from one game. But hey we need some more for our garbage current 2019 servers :)
---
There are a fair number of items that drop in raids that are not good for PvE but are very good for PvP. Smart guilds will have a system for dealing with that. Hand of Rag should fit into that system since other then just wearing it to be pretty, that is all it is good for. Though I won't even discount the wearing it to be pretty aspect, if the guild allows for that as a reason in whatever system they come up with. 
---
they can update saying they've fixed 1,000 bugs but if nothing else is new. Why do anything more?
---
For horde, the shaman with 300 blacksmithing. For alliance, the warrior with 300 blacksmithing.
---
I noticed this immediately when I entered the demo. There were ugly as fuck shadows in the character selection screen. The old are far superior, as we can see on the image to the left. Colours changes a lot with those over the to shadows. Also, weather effects are extremely important for immersion for me. Feels so good to just stand in Elwynn while a heavy rain goes n.
---
Imagine the crazy consumable cost you'd have if you had ranked bgs in vanilla.
---
But now that youve confirmed that his post might be the correct way of thinking, he will get upvotes.
---
Retri pals or those pesty shamans
---
[deleted]
---
Retri pals or those pesty shamans. Could also go to a warrior, but that'd be second priority imo, since they gain less comparatively. Also, it should be someone that is able to collect about 10k gold
---
Drain Life isn't really good for leveling and should be replaced with wanding if you have an up to date rare wand. Supporting math follows:
---
Level 37 Rare Wand: [39.4 DPS](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13064)
---
Level 38 Drain Life: [41 DPS.](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=7651) Also 41 HPS returned and 4% chance per second of allowing an instant cast shadow bolt. Lasts for 5 seconds and costs a total of 185 mana, but even with 70% pushback resist chance talent the warlock is on average going to be only getting 4 seconds of benefit before they need to cast again if they are actually tanking hits from 1 enemy during it.
---
So using drain life the warlock has gained minimal DPS, and is getting roughly enough health back to cover the cost of casting the spell through life tap. But we still haven't factored in the loss of mana regen from casting. For a warlock that mainly stacks stam and spirit at this level every cast of drain life compared to wanding actually costs around 100 extra mana from lost mana regeneration. Even a warlock with minimal spirit will lose 50 mana. Adding that to the mana cost is enough to make using drain life inefficient even if the warlock has a decent amount of +shadow damage while leveling.
---
classic doesnt have full-screen glow
---
Didn't they say "beginning" of summer 2019?
---
they think winning is fun, does that count?
---
If they brought back the launcher they would put an ad for call of duty 4 on it.
---
...jesus christ how this game and company have fallen.  So sad.
---
Yea typically weapon skill is so good that it is at least as good as pieces from the next higher tier.
---
That’s exactly the point. Most people wouldn’t want it but it’s possible. Just because people don’t want it doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be available lol
---
&gt;against loot share
---
&gt;for sharding
---
Based retard
---
Makes for a good relaxing Druid or hunter alt, though. 
---
No changes means few changes 
---
Druids can definitely tank raids. They're perfect for Jin'do in ZG.
---
The whole point of seal fate is that you generate so many combo points that you can use eviscerates for bonus damage. I'm playing it right now on a private server. In fact, if you use the 4 piece duskmantle set bonus, you have so many combo points that your rotation is 5 point slice and dice plus 3-5 point eviscerate (depending on crits and ruthlessness), and you don't even need improved slice and dice (heresy, I know).
---
If you were a healer class and not right in an epicentre or super disease you could outheal it and escape.
---
And there was definitely hiding. A lot of people found new areas of the major cities just due to necessity.
---
Whoever has the money to actually craft the hammer lol, sulfuron ingots are not cheap.
---
Lol mc takes like 30 minutes in prebis with DM and songflower.
---
Sign me up!
---
I think anybody who would raid with it (2h Furies and Ret Pallies if applicable) but I would consider the Warrior/Shaman/Paladin who are most committed to the guild and loyal.
---
Pvp in vanilla is serious. If you don't stop the other faction from leveling or progressing their game, their faction might become dominant on the server and it will ruin everything. Does anyone have more to say about faction dominance? 
---
I have the idea to routinely world PVP, and really hit them where it hurts. I know a lot of people are going to do this, and usually guilds are quick to retaliate. The back and forth struggle is what makes the game more personal for me. Also, faction violence is what makes it so much more convenient to make friends in the game, so they can back you up for a quest, or farming something. Solo players can't really do much but switch toons when they get camped. 
---
Another thing occurred to me about world PVP. Some people have certain behaviors, like feral cats getting real close and hitting the /lick. Toying with their ganks. In addition to this post question, what codes to live by, what are some of the untold stories of creative behavior in pvp?
---
Master Loot only? 
---
M8v
---
That would take 12 hours...
---
Shit, if Blizzard had this skin for the BNET client for $5 they would make some bank lol.
---
And switch our internet connections for dial-up ones.
---
I loved twinking for a bit on Paladin at level 29. There's a BoE mace called Cobalt Crusher with a frost shock proc.
---
It procced quite often back in Vanilla, I would close gaps easily with BoF and HoJ, if the hammer procs with SoC its nice burst plus a slow.
---
If I had engi and enchants I woulda been a monster. I was far from BiS.
---
I just miss not needing the current launcher. I don't need all the social media aspects and advertisements for your other games. I only wanted to play wow. 
---
I mean kinda? Avoiding damaging mechanics I suspose can be boiled down to "don't stand in the fire". However some of these mechanics are take damage on purpose but at planned times so damage reduction buffs are up, healers are ready. Some are killing adds, but also making sure the adds are silenced or stunned. There is positioning of the boss, that the tank and players need to be aware of.
---
This fight is mechanic heavy but not at all that hard compared to some later bosses. I used it as an example of the sheer number of mechanics that a single boss can have. Compared to some vanilla bosses.
---
TLDR. Yes this boss is 70% "don't stand in fire" and 30% other
---
I cannot for the life of me remember the sound of the play button, and no search I do finds it. Does anyone know where I can relive (relisten) this glorious play sound?! 
---
*increase brightness by 5%*
---
SO mUch MorE PeRsonaliTy
---
A warrior geared in naxx level frost resistance gear i going to have a naxx level 2 hander...
---
You assume too much to say anything definitive.. Potentially, they can and will adjust their tech to make the servers hold up. The shards in retail are designed to do less so they only really crash during big city raids like 80 vs. 80 because they're not designed to handle that. Quantity over quality in retail's case.
---
Also, 1.12 values doesn't fix the bulk of what's wrong with pservers.
---
I was at the auction house when people started going crazy over trade chat. I first I assumed a warlock had spawned an infernal or alliance were running around. But pretty soon all the bank alts at the auctioneers died and I started taking ticking damage. I was a lv 60 mage so it didn't kill me right away. I threw on ice barrier and walked towards the bank and it was just decimation. Everyone was either dead or running while dying. When I dropped I stayed at my corpes for a while to figure out what was going on but was more just entertained watching the confusion. I rezed and tried to hang around the perimeter of the city for a while so I could see and hear. I ended up heading away and doing stuff outside the city for the rest of the night. 
---
The next day I found out it was something to do with the debuff from zg but we thought it might have been intentional. I logged back in and org was just piles and piles of skeletons and mostly empty. Some guildies had figured out the trick and hunters were getting the debuff stacked on their pets and trying to think of fun ways to spread it around. By the end of the second day it was mostly just annoying because you couldn't go to the bank or auction houses unless it was a suicide run, and we had raids to get ready for.  Pretty soon after that though blizzard released a hotfix and it was back to normal. 
---
We get that. Do you get what op is trying to say? If not, you could be misunderstanding something. So why sabiitage what he is saying, it is not helpful now that nobody wants sharding/crossfeal/phasing or what have you. 
---
I remember my first time trying to run SFK as a night elf priest with some hunter friends. We We're noobs but the idea of sneaking into horde territory for the instance had real savor to it. 
---
Then we got to the bridge before the instance zone-in, and there was a Tauren warrior, level ?? in full epics, enchantments dripping blood from his mace. It is telling that nearly fifteen years later I still remember how he looked. 
---
He murdered us many times of course, but eventually we made it in. The instance was so much more exciting for the challenge that the world PvP made for us.
---
That is the classic I'm looking forward to.
---
Racials at the end of the day are still quite negligible. Orcs are arguably the best pvp race but even then, each one has their caveat and it's going to be so marginal, even a min maxer is quite fine picking the worst race and still able to play at a top tier consistently. Pure minmax 100%? Orc.
---
I am unsure. Off the top of my head I thought it was "summer 2019" but earlier summer 2019 would be fantastic! 
---
It gives you time to do chores while you beat on an enemy for 30 minutes.
---
But you still need head/shoulder enchants
---
K. Well. If they ignore the post and get ninjaed. I guess they should of listened. 
---
Also making a new reddit name isnt to difficult. I have 4 sitting ready being I change every 6-8 momths
---
You only need exalted for that lol.
---
Pre-patch 1.11 it was so hard to find bank/bag space for all your keys.
---
Interesting because it’s on by default right now as I have to result to a console command on live to turn it off. 
---
Lost me at. “Everything was faceroll” 
---
Yes, if it would affect the distance i could see or amount of stuff i could see same time. It's nicer to drive a car if you are actually able to see stuff.
---
this was my favorite part about duo leveling with a friend, could bully some classes even 6 or 7 levels above you 
---
I don't see the keyring it self being important, sure it saved some bag space, but i feel i actually looked at and cared less for my key's after the keyring was added than before it was added. Having to manage your key's with your inventory was a bigger deal for me than the fire and forget after the keyring was added. 
---
Well, here's what I know...
---
* Drain Life has won me fights that wanding would have lost me
---
* Succubus melee damage is vastly superior to the voidwalker, and things seem to die a lot faster because of that
---
* Drain Life scales with spell damage, wands do not
---
* Drain Life 4 does more DPM than Shadow Bolt 6 (level 36), if you get all 5 ticks in
---
Yeah... apparently if i have short q’s the horde must have long ones.. despite the fact i saw the same people in my bgs. If they had to wait so long why were the same people in my bgs. I don’t play pvp servers. I think their are huge benefits to not being on them. 
---
You need items from ZG to make the head / leg enchants
---
The shoulder enchant you can just buy, but not the others.
---
Shoulder enchants were exalted and could be %100 bought like you are saying. I’m talking about the class specific boss drops needed to enchant your helm and legs.  This requires you to raid multiple ZGs and pray for the boss to drop your class specific item and for you to out-roll the other raid members who are the same class.
---
For example: Shamans need this to drop off one of the bosses: [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19720](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19720) 
---
The full guide to the enchants can be found here:

---
Shouldn't that stuff be guild supplied? I know we supplied the lucky ppl with ingots in case of sulfuras and elementium in case of thunderfury. 
---
One important detail to mention was that the debuff generally isn’t do enough damage to kill level 60s. It was mostly low levels that got decimated in big cities.
---
This is what I say to anyone who asks me why I wouldn't be for personal looting.
---
Beautifully put.
---
So did you start on BDF or did you transfer from Shadowsong during the free transfers? I started on Shadowsong and had to see some friends leave when the transfers were available.
---
Tirisfal is the best zone in the game and no one would ever say Durotar is better. Although Orc/troll is always better for PvE and orc is mostly better for PvP. Starting zones are inconsequential compared to 25% stun resist. You can always do Silverpine but let’s be honest, The Barrens is far better.
---
ENHANCE SHAMAN ONLY :blazangry:
---
39 warlock stacking shadow wrath greens is unstoppable. 
---
Oh my god. Have the engi goggles +nature’s wrath and a bunch of +nature’s wrath greens and you basically global other twinks. Ele shamans so criminally underrated.

PvE server? Advice back in the day was that around level forty (from memory) blueberry tanking started to suck compared to warlock tanking and succubus DPSing. The blueberry just didn't do much damage, and was not that great at holding aggro either.
---
No doubt playing it safe with a blueberry on a PvP server will save you a lot of trips back from the graveyard, but pirate server players sometimes seem to kind of forget PvE servers exist.
---
And Gatorade bottles to piss in!
---
Most people had replaced dial-up with ADSL by the time wow released. So we're good.
---
Well, at least in Sweden.
---
Don't give them any ideas for microtransactions! 
---
My friend's dad is Blizzard and he said outlook murky.
---
On Gnomes are kill on sight. Those anklebiters look great hanging from trees.
---
Yeah vanilla is full of moments like this that are missing in any expansion. Mainly because in vanilla leveling people and 60s kind of hung around in the same zones, either for instances or farming.
---
A serious guild may prioritise their gold towards better investments.
---
Open /roll, raider rank priority. With the disclaimer that whoever gets is both expected to complete it but will also not receive any help from the gbank.
---
That is a good idea.
---
Now, If someone could get a hold of the art assets, I could make one.
---
You can try but I think you will be the one who ends up being camped. 
---
And I like to play with my food. Slowly.
---
I had an ISDN line, and it sucked big time.
---
I didn’t start on BDF either.  I believe it was the PvE realm Hyjal. It was for the better because the Battlground queues were terrible ok the alliance side.  We had to create horde character to tell everyone to join the AV queue.
---
Oh, my condolences. 
---
Elementium are dimes in a dozen and the guild bank will have more pres than they now what to do with. Sulfuron ingots are rarer and dont drop as often. Also, Thunderfury is bis for tanks so there is an incentive for the guild to help.
---
The rag hammer isnt that great and is mostly an eyecatcher. In my opinion whoever wants the hammer should buy his/her own ingots to be eligible for it. Of course if the eye drops before Anyone has bought them it should go to whoever is willing to pay. 
---
Yeah you're right, but if blizzard just goes full 1.12 those wont be in the game. (hope they dont and progressive patches is what we get but yeah keep that in mind).
---
I remember when it happened, I was somewhere between level 23 and 27 on my human paladin. I remember being in Ironforge in between the bank and the auction house. I remember the first "tick" of damage that came from the debuff. I would say it did damage equal to around 2/3 of my health. I looked at my health bar super confused and mentally debated putting on my divine shield and healing, but I didn't see any hostile npcs or players anywhere in sight so I just figured I was fine, and that I would shrug off whatever strange thing had just happened. (This was either my highest level character at the time, or a couple levels away from my highest, and I was young, and a vanilla player who didn't have the strongest grasp of the game.) After my brief scan of that area of ironforge a second tick of the debuff greeted my character with death. As I was running back I looked at my chat log and there wasn't really anything in it, because most people had abandoned the city. When I revived I remember that there were a lot less people in ironforge than usual and people were talking about being killed by the blood. Also there were dead bodies everywhere, with most of the only living players in the city being higher level characters. I stayed in ironforge a bit longer, but then I think I just went back to questing or logged off. I remember hearing more about it later, and exactly how it happened. So yeah, that's my experience with the whole thing.
---
That is a nice compromise, but why?
---
Except they will never catch on and keep undercutting you by 400%, because:
---
* Most people don't check prices before listing
---
* Some players don't understand the concept of a free market and will deliberately forego higher profits to constantly keep the price low, because they think flipping is evil. Dumb moral compass that ensures everyone makes less money.
---
It's funny how a sound I haven't heard in 12 years can suddenly rush back into my head like it was yesterday upon a single mention. 
---
I was there. Dalaran Horde. Most of us in our guild, Doom, left the cities and stayed away. Sometimes we would go see for giggles, but not often. 
---
If they are Undead or if they have stupid names I kill them. I try to avoid killing Tauren.
---
Like in most MMO's I play, I make zero plans to generate money. Because everything I want can be gained without much money needed.
---
I think they might go with the 1.12 too.  I really have low expectations.
---
I'm talking about buying them of course, just giving the ones that dropped out of the guildbank. 
---
i still have hopes and dreams. :D
---
Eye's didn't grow on trees for us, think we only got 2 over the course of Vanilla and we always had enough ingots in the GB to supply them. 
---
If you had more Eyes drop than you had ingots, then sure, let the ppl buy the rest of the ingots. 
---
Yeah. Threw my whole weekends at aq and naxx.
---
On pservers it's very relaxed. I would do like 3 nights of raiding, 2-3 hours each. So around 6-9 hours total?
---
At least to clear Mc, Bwl and zg in the earlier stages, I say minimum of 6 hours is all I need.
---
(Also counting the time you wait for 40 people to show up.)
---
In later stages you will need more time for aq and naxx, but it's also the time where you shouldn't need too much time getting gold anymore for your epic mount.
---
Early stages you will farm more consumables than actually raiding lol
---
0 is required, the more you use the easier it gets though.
---
I have my WoW figure print on my mantle. I still like it. 
---
Nobody knows what classic will be like. No one knows what changes there will be. All these guides are useless at the point in time. People discuss class rankings, gold making strats, boss guides, etc, etc. Don't listen to anyone, we don't know anything until beta is out.
---
Never thought about it, but yes please. 
---
19 paladins are pretty nuts. I used to play that bracket a lot back in the day and with perfect gear  you could hit &gt;2k life and basically be unkillable by less than 3-4 people.
---
Do you not?
---
I like 39 enhancement shamans with PoD. You would pretty much just walk up to someone and proc WF then move on to the next guy.
---
Bought a house last year that the cable company assured me they serviced.  Found out after moving in and going to get internet that my only option was DSL.
---
I'm just really prepared for Classic in every possible sense.
---
Keep dedicated classic servers and slowly expand into classic specific content for those who didn’t like the way the flow ebbed when Activison got involved. 
---
What I mean is if it were up to my I would sell the GB ingots to other guilds or have the raider who receives the eye buy it from the GB. Then use the gold from the ingots to Supply consumables and enchants for the raiders.
---
&gt;BfA in the corner.
---
Boy do I have good news for you.
---
I don't remember it!! Any links?
---
Blizzard themselves (Brack) said: "once we’re committed to doing this at a Blizzard level, which we are, whatever happens is going to happen. If millions of people show up and play for years, that’s awesome. And if just tens of people show up and play for years, we’re fine either way."
---
Yes they can keep it up without any profits. They are a billion dollar company. After the initial development is done, it costs basically nothing for them to keep a few servers around. You can be cynical if you'd like but I think they will.
---
I leveled a Paladin after my Warrior. And while it was dramatically easier to do, I still found playing a Paladin fun during that time as well as at max level. They have plenty of cool things they can do.
---
Left looks better
---
I fucking miss those old launchers, much better and cool than what we have now.
---
Fake needing in groups. Peer presure. Ransom ninjaing. Classic can’t have forced personal loot. I rest my case. 
---
12 million current players? Impossible 
---
Generally it goes to a pvping pally or shammy. It's useless for druids and your top warriors will want better items. 
---
To be fair both look good.
---
I don't have a link, but... PWOOooshhhhjj!!
---
Activision Blizzard cash shop has you covered.
---
It's not that bad. I think first a version with only text (with info about contained soul in tooltip) and no models would be a good step. Usually it's good practice to start small and progressively add features.
---
Creature models should not be too hard to add. I looked it up and some addons already gathered a DB to display creatures from their names/ids. For players I don't know yet.
---
Something that is a problem is that we do not have Classic yet, so testing has to be done on retail, but soul shards are not there. But the logic to keep track of a particular item should be universal and could already be written. I might take a look at this soon, that's interesting.
---
If you have a poor guild and need the money then thats certainly a valid option. We paid for a lot of stuff as a guild in Vanilla for example (resistance) or other good craftables, we gave out enchant mats, paid for respecs when we asked ppl to respec, certain consumables when needed for progress and stuff like that and the guildbank was always stacked in a way that we never had to sell stuff like ingots to fund the guild and i would expect every guild with a decent organisation to be able to organise this if we could do it back in 2004-2006 without any experience in the game :)
---
Yeah, they typically get sold on the AH and go towards funding other things.
---
I was in a 59 PvP guild on my main with no intention of hitting 60 soon, but I was about 200xp from reaching it. We queued up in SW keep and happened to exit the BG at the same moment someone started the Onyxia attunment quest fight. Before I could leave group someone tagged a mob which ended up leveling me to 60. I was furious, not the emotion I envisioned maxing my first character would invoke. 
---
How many other people has that happened to? Probably not many. Is it a key "Feature"? Nope. 
---
But it ended up being a part of my own classic experience that otherwise wouldn't have happened if there was a "convenient" turn XP off feature. 
---
The consequences of such an option might be minuscule, but they would not be zero. 
---
Me, obviously.
---
You won't hit 60 in a week.
---
Hunter weapon...
---
Firstly - we need a fucking beta.
---
Secondly - Classic needs a good game director to make these calls. Some bugs should indeed be fixed. 
---
It's not old design values, it's not balance decisions, it's a bug.
---
I hope so.  It worked just fine.  
---
How did the guild make this money? 
---
I knew this the moment I saw the comparison. Classic looks better, but the original has that undeniable nostalgia factor, personally. 
---
Very unlikely, if not impossible.
---
On pserver guild only "requires BL buffs and tribute buffs, along with fight specific consumables (tanks need more consumes).
---
Naxx goes more slowly but it's still doable (not full cleared yet though).
---
On the one hand, no, you don't need all the consumes and wbuffs.
---
On the other hand, they help an insane amount and make everything significantly easier and faster.
---
so do you think its worthless to take a week off to try and get \*close\* to 60? or just play when I can which is at most 9 hours a day :/ 
---
so do you think its worthless to take a week off to try and get \*close\* to 60? 
---
Mathematically yea you could but I wouldn't call it a realistic goal.   You'd be working harder than if you were at work all week that's for sure.
---
All of yall are wrong.  Classic needs to be fulfilled to it's original plan.  All those empty spaces in the map like Hyjal need to be added content.  So Hyjal and other raids that were originally planned should be added so that people with full naxx gear can raid.
---
Why 
---
No dude. The record is something like 4d /played.
---
In actual vanilla EJ got MC BWL and AQ down to a single 4 hour raid so they could farm it while doing Naxx. Much like any speedrun people have only gotten faster.
---
Top tier troll post 
---
Noise level of the old play button on the launcher:  150db
---
Top speed runners will do it in about 96-108 hours /played with a Hunter, which is the fastest class to level. Warlocks and Druids are nearly as fast. Warriors and Paladins are probably the slowest.
---
So it depends on what class you're playing, how good you are at power leveling, and how many hours you can play per day. 
---
Does #NoChanges mean we can advocate to be 14 years younger? Cause I miss my youth, energy, health and load of free time, and if we're full #NoChanges, then let's #NoChanges. :)
---
99% of people reading this will never step foot in Naxx.
---
That will have me back on a Private Server so quick that there is no measurement of time quick enough to record the transition.
---
Great comments.It really did.
---
its usually the guy that makes it clear from the get go that he wants it.
---
mostly the ingots are the bottleneck and getting those can get awefully expensive. 
---
If you never played vanilla before id say you would be level 30-40 after that week. 
---
But seriously strongly consider a change of mentality towards your level now.... Take your time to level. It's about the journey not the destination. Or you could say, the destination is only what the journey was. 
---
Take your time and don't rush.Enjoy it all the way.  You'll get there. 
---
I personally prefer the journey over the destination ...
---
But if you prefer to rush through and get to max level ASAP, I would say sure, go for it.
---
With meth , sure
---
Vanilla WoW is boring. They have to add expansions! I can't wait to have flying mounts, and play as a Panderan monk class, and a Dark Iron dwarf! Not adding the expansions to Vanilla would be stupid.  
---
No one really wants to play Vanilla. Not for long, anyway.
---
I dont attack greys unless i see them attack someone of my faction. 
---
I leave warriors alone cause they are a free kill for many classes early on. 
---
And i kill any hunter on sight cause they are so op while lvling. If you dont attack them they will most likely attack you and than your dead.
---
That is true. Although one of several reasons so few progressed in Naxx in vanilla was proper consumable use wasnt that common. There are many consumables in vanilla that by themselves makes many bosses trivial.
---
I took 62 days /played to get lvl 60 during retail Vanilla. Come at me bro.
---
You sure sound like a prick though.
---
All the consumables listed aimed towards survival are more or less mandatory in varying degree. The various protection potions, stamina consumables, and FAPs for tanks. Most fights in Naxx are about control and survival. That being said, having high DPS always helps because it makes the fights shorter and a shorter fight means a smaller time span in which things can go wrong.
---
How do you get back to the instance entrance if you can't camp?
---
I wouldnt mind tho if they make a server where they continued Vanilla alongside the museum vanilla server.
---
Wasn't it 100% like it is in pservers in retail Vanilla too?
---
In the sense that you could reset instances with a macro, and /camp to log out and log back in at the entrance...
---
What part of it is pserver specific?
---
Iirc, at the beginning of vanilla hardiness was +25% of your base stun resist (5%) mening it was only giving an extra 1.25%, but they changed it at some point. 
---
I may be misremembering that, but I think that's why UD was so popular. 
---
Will you hit 60? Probably not. The people that do it in 4 or 5 days have obsessively optimized the leveling path and have done it several times. For experienced players who focus on leveling quickly you're looking at 6 to 8 days played. Fresh players or people who like to wonder will be over 12 days. If you count the weekends that cap a work week and put in 12 hour days you'll be around 4 or 5 days played. Probably in the upper 40s level. 
---
If it's worth it is up to you. You'll be ahead of the Zerg and probably in the first wave to hit 60. They'll be lots of good players doing key runs and attunements you will be eligible for. You might even find a raid spot in a guild that formed before launch or at the least you'll be taken seriously as a player. On the flip side, you'll only have bought yourself 2-4 weeks of being unique before the Zerg hits 60 and you're just another face in the crowd. Or you may just burn yourself out. Long term it's always better to find a pace you can play that's sustainable. I know 5 guys on private severs that grinded out the aq gate opening and then just quit. 
---
I'll be taking a vacation because hyyyyype
---
Even when farming DME lashers, the corpse walk isn't that bad... You could simply suicide and walk back into the instance, back out, reset via macro (or button, whatever they have in Classic's UI), then just walk back in and continue farming.
---
So it really wouldn't slow DME farming or any instance farming by much, right? Or am I missing something here.
---
If you queue for a BG, queue pops, and you don't join or AFK, you should get deserter.
---
The absilute easiest, incredibly simple and 100% effective solution to queue dodging.
---
If queue pops in Leage of Legends, DOTA, HotS, OW, you get a penalty. It is a very simple standard that works.
---
Oh yeah, the wake up the neighborhood play button sound.
---
As it was mentioned many times before. TBC servers 2-3 years later after classic with possibility to copy character from vanilla would be great, and is logic solution that would mostly solve population retention problem that is due to limited content. Happy ending for both diehard vanilla and longing tbc players.
---
Yes. NoChanges means bringing back the Launcher that was introduced with TBC :)
---
During Classic there was no real launcher
---
Removed - rule 1
---
I don't remember a large amount but this is what I do remember, from Illidan-US on Horde:
---
I wasn't 60, didn't know too much about raiding, so I had no idea about the debuff. I do know there was something a while earlier with the Barron Geddon bomb, I think a Hunter's pet got it somehow, summoned it in the AH, and blew some people up.
---
I roll into Orgrimmar one day, skeletons EVERYWHERE. Trade chat was pretty hectic. Not long before I got the debuff and died, and continued to rez and die, I remember seeing a ton of ghosts standing around presumably waiting for rez timers. I remember a lot of people near the RFC entrance, presumably hiding out there. I think that's where some people were doing their trading by inviting to group and trading there.
---
Eventually I got the heck out of Orgrimmar, made my way to Grom Gol, where there were still a bunch of people with the disease (zeppelin ride from Orgrimmar, and ZG was obviously fresh so STV was probably not the smartest place to go. I distinctly remember getting "chased out" of Grom Gol by people having their fun trying to infect others. I remember "camping out" in the jungle, this sense of paranoia and everyone trying to keep their distance from everyone else.
---
I don't remember any other zones, and one day I logged in and it was fixed. And I remember sort of wanting it to happen again and being bummed out it was hot fixed, even though it made normal tasks like using the AH almost impossible.
---
Removed - rule 1. The post is most obviously describing private servers.
---
At most nine hours a day?! Don't worry about talking a week off if you still play that much outside of work, you'll still be one of the first to 60 on your server. 
---
In which way does this interfere with rule 1? That's literally a lvl1 warrior cosplay
---
Classic WoW team please make this happen this somehow, even a oldschool battlenet re-skin would be cool!
---
Its the "Log back in at the entrance" part that we are unsure about. We know you can reset instance, but classic changed the logout behaviour so many times we don't know if we will port back to entrance, or to the GY, or be ghetto hearthed or what. hehe
---
What professions do you guys think are cool for a priest? I kinda wanna get alchemy and herbalism, do go with the apothecary vibe, or engineering mining for the utility. However tailoring 'feels' mandatory due to the amazing BoP gear. Is it too big a loss not to get? 
---
You cab switch wowhead to classic client btw. It's a tick box near the top of the page..
---
20 - 30 hours a week I'd guess. Played a rogue.
---
Hell yeah. It seemed like nobody on my server had that damn key. Suicide it is.
---
I don't even understand why you would want to hit 60 in a week, but whatever, it's your choice.
---
Do you mean that you can play for 9 hours while working? So if you take a week off, how much that would be, 16 hours per day? Well in that case it is actually possible to hit 60 in a week.
---
Level 1 Twinks. Then go to the horde starting zones and raise hell.
---
You could hit 60 is you go really hardcore, if not, you won't hit 60 in a week. 
---
&gt; I don’t want Druid’s to be viable Tanks    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; The caveat is that they can be HYBRID and offer a bit of everything.
---
The issue is they can't be hybrid in PvE (not enough power to be relevant enough) aside little niches and PvP... well, neither in most cases due to lack of itemization (lack of, too much stats to focus on, lowest drop prio... ), poor scaling and most of their utility being baseline (so the healing approach still has it). 
---
They only offer healing. And that's due to no other class bringing it.  The *bit of everything* is not strong enough for all non-solo content. 
---
Most of us only ask to be *treated as an equal.* Now it's closer to a third-class citizen unless you're on healing duty.  
---
After researching the image a little, I will give it the benefit of the doubt. It's quite vague, which is why I initially removed it.
---
&gt; so do you think its worthless to take a week off to try and get *close* to 60?
---
Worth it, especially if you enjoy it. But theres a chance the first 20-30 hours will be sort of .... ruined in the case of speed leveling by the sheer crowd. 
---
But if you are fast and persistent that whole week you shouild break free of most of the crowd by 20-30 hours at most and it should get alot faster. But that initial hold up might keep you from hitting 60.
---
Its also massively fatiguing to do this. No matter how much you love the game, its going to wear on you and you will desire some variety, even if its just to name and get your alts a few flight paths and get them to the main city... you will be hungry to do something other than grind after that first 2 days.
---
I've seen it happen before. Keep buying the cheap ones and most people will be on-board in a week or so. Even if you're not checking the prices, you'll notice that your potions are  getting sold faster than usual, and probably assume that the demand has gone up.
---
Everyone with an Auction house monitoring add-on starts getting suggestions to buy and resell the cheap ones. The economy can get completely screwed for a month.
---
It depends on what your aim in classic is. If it is just to be realm-first 60, you can try.
---
I see no other reasons why would someone rush it so fast. I mean, been waiting for years for this game, just to rush through it in a week or few weeks. Sounds boring.
---
&gt; only BoP loot that you roll GREED on can be traded with members of your group. NEED loot is still instantly bound and permanently untradable.
---
If this is true, i don't eve understand what they implement that for. I thought their idea was to let players trade items which they needed by mistake. What's the point of trading greed items, lol?
---
Strangely, I do not remember the launcher at all.
---
Obviously not or that’s what esfand would be doing.
---
I believe it was at Dolanaar. There was also a guy typing to a group of NPCs asking them for directions to Darnassus. :)
---
Wow seeing this launcher, the J!NX message especially, just brought back a rush of memories.  It's hard to tell for me specifically if I miss the game as it was more than I miss the time in my life when I played it.  The hindsight is always rose-tinted but it's hard to not looked back at those times and wish I could press a button and go back.
---
They already said that the collector's edition codes wont work in classic so I doubt Murky would.
---
Hi,
---
Since it is approaching wow classic release, I thought it was time to gather us, Vikings. The idea is to have a place to discuss wow classic and eventually find us a common server we can all play on.
---
Here is the link to **Wow classic Norge**: [https://discord.gg/Cbz7QuB](https://discord.gg/Cbz7QuB)
---
Please follow these simple rules:
---
1. Speak Norwegian
---
2. Keep it WoW classic related
---
3. Keep a good tone in chat
---
I haven't seen him try it yet, or I must have missed that stream?
---
Lol, who said it was on a stream.
---
I got it as an Enh Shaman during Vanilla, because I demonstrated how much I wanted it.  
---
I farmed 50 Arcane crystals winthin 24h (straight) to prove it, and was here to raid every day.
---
You can set up your own private server and test it out really easily. Just google LH repack, it should be the first link. Note these servers will not be 100% accurate though.
---
Also, you would be better off using SoR since it can also proc items, essentially giving you +100% attack speed instead of the 40% SoCru gives you. I'm also fairly confident SoC will still be way better dps-wise.
---
Would you all think the RP scene will be all right in Classic, or will it be less than retail since people seem to primarily be going back to do the content?
---
Not current, just how much they have made easily 
---
Then it is not really possible to say that he has 'obviously' tried that either, since you don't know.
---
Proc's from SoR was something I didn't know before, thanks!! I will try to set that up then, it seems like a good idea to test myself.
---
Yes it is, he has spent years theory crafting Ret paladin. The 1h spell power build has been done to death. 
---
You would never see this kind of encounter with flying mounts. Great story.
---
Do you have a link for where they said that?
---
'needs to'
---
Hard to master?? huh...
---
Hi, /u/Trevmiester
---
OK, but I am referring to something else. But thanks for your thoughts.
---
/u/EsfandTV : what do you think of a proc based retribution DPS spec?
---
Are there any good vids of this?
---
So what's great about a twink disc priest?
---
yes, just like it always was (gold farmers)  
---
I simply meant that you could, in theory, farm gold on retail and then use this method of selling game time to other players in classic to make gold off of the gold you farmed on retail. Damn it's difficult to explain .. :p  
---
The current price for an EU WoW Token is 174,139g.  
---
Let's just say for the sake of this example that the vanilla equivalence of 174,139g is 500g.
---
500g becomes the standard price for a game time transaction on the classic servers.
---
If it's easier to farm 174,139g on retail than it is to farm 500g on classic, then some people could make money on classic by farming gold on their retail characters, building a reputation as a trustworthy game time seller on the classic servers and in that way exchange retail gold for classic gold. The game time buyers don't need investment in the retail servers. They just need to have a level 1 character to run to AH and buy a token with. It's not game breaking, but the influence of WoW Tokens and retail servers are still there.
---
I didn't like gold sellers back in vanilla either, and I believe this creates an additional opportunity to have even more of that behavior in Trade Chat and whatnot.
---
Probs selling carries+gear. It's how my retail guild paid for stuff through legion. 
---
People are likely to downvote you here, but I actually think that there's a significant amount of people that would also like to see post Naxx content in line with what the original plans for the pre-TBC game. 
---
I know that "no changes" is a convenient catch phrase, and I think that it should certainly be the mindset for initial release, but I'd much rather see new content in the vanilla "mindset" of game development and content creation, than to see them just pull up a TBC server.
---
Go herb/tailoring. You can go for engineering instead of tailoring later in the game. Level an alt to 35 for 300 alchemy, or just use a trusted friend/guildie for crafting pots. 
---
If you have a friend with alchemy you guys can share the cost of more expensive recipes etc. 
---
Vague??
---
Petition to have this mod removed. There is absolutely nothing vague about this. Mod of classic wow and can't spot Lvl 1 human warrior outfit. Reeee
---
They didn't say that.  
---
Oh I didn't know you could gift game time :o
---
Perhaps, but I still think it's a reasonable discussion to have.
---
They are what you would call "useful idiots".  
---
Why would blizzard have people actually work on stuff when they can just shit out same old stuff for years to come and don't do any work (past initial part of getting it to work) while bunch of people praise them?  
---
no, considering battle.net is the launcher now.
---
My proudest moment in Vanilla was when I encountered NE druid lvl ?? (guess he was in lvl 52-54 bracket due to his gear) with my orc hunter lvl 41. I had bm build and attacked him on sight, killing him several moments after. He tried to shapeshift and to heal/retreat but he had no chances ;)
---
That sounds super fun.  
---
"Far" is an overstatement. If you can't win a duel without an RNG stun resist, chamces are you can't win one with it either. About half the R13/R14 locks I've ever seen on the Horde side were UD. I've won duels out in the world because I could get one tick of healing off Cannibalize and I've lost duels against other Warlocks even with WotF.
---
Whenever people put so much emphasis on these things I think it distorts the truth. 
---
You can get 60 in a week. You can't do much else but play, but it's doable. Sleep only 6 hours a day and only take breaks for food/bathroom and you'll get there. Assuming you can follow a guide or know what to do.
---
*Is the launcher a gameplay element?*
---
No, unless you believe that poker plays differently depending on the color of the box the cards are kept in.
---
*Does your question therefore make sense?*
---
No. 
---
I'll sign that petition. 
---
They should have the old-school launcher for 1.12.1 pop up when you press play in the [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher!
---
Unfortunately no. But love the idea
---
Is this a joke I'm not getting or are you serious? 
---
I know seems a little... doing too much to me 
---
Not as impressive because mage, but I dueled a 60 warrior in MC gear on my 38 mage and beat him. I had to spam rank 1 frostbolt like mad, but it just goes to show how OP frost can be against warriors.  
---
I think the best way to do this would be to let people design custom launchers, I don’t know what blizzards opinion on this is 
---
&gt; Assuming they implement the exact system  
---
Assuming that, yes, loot trading isn't an issue. HOWEVER, Hazzikostas said the words "Sorry ninja, no more need missclick excuse for you", which IMPLIES that loot trading in Classic will be implemented on NEED, which transforms ALL BoP items won into BoE items for 2 hours.
---
And that is the a HUGE problem.
---
The fact of the matter is : WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LOOT TRADING WILL WORK IN CLASSIC...because there is no official announcement on this.
---
And until such an announcement will come, we should make sure that Blizzard UNDERSTANDS that loot trading on NEED rolls should NEVER be considered.
---
You could probably attempt to rip stuff from old screenshots, I think you might be able to get the original launcher by inserting your old vanilla disk 
---
Well they succeeded, I was certainly bored as a paladin all the way through the content. 
---
Breaking news: by using someone elses sruff you rely on the creator of said stuff.
---
Rest of the points is valid, though. But I never had a lasting problem. Sure, I am no longer using the same plugin from the same developer. But there are still multiple alternatives that are being updated. 
---
And rarely something does not work right. But then the button to disable the addon for that site is just one click away.
---
Which is still better than not having dark mode at all.
---
Yeah I'm kinda nerd triggered right now. What retail nerd brownnosed his way into modding the classic sub lol 
---
The 19 community is really popping right now on BfA my man. Gear isn't pure boa and there's a lot of people playing. 
---
Nothing really competitive right now in terms of premades however, usually wait for the summer for that. 
---
Must be cold
---
Shaman, thematically. Hate to see it went to a druid just because he spent the most time with the guild. 
---
Step 1. Find anyone who is red. (Extra points if a lowbie)
---
Step 2. Corpse camp them while smoking a bowl and watching a podcast.
---
Step 3. ???
---
Step 4. Corpse camp the guy who came to stop the first guy getting corpse camped. 
---
Ok so the main question is do they also have a low skill ceiling? I’m inclined to say no - mastering paladin is not something a lot of people do, especially in pvp
---
I had never heard of that one before. nasty.
---
It's said in a joking manner but I agree with the sentiment.  I would assume classicwow mods are knowledgable about the game. Not recognizing the iconic lvl 1 human warrior outfit is.. strange.
---
I needed like 2 weeks to hit 60. And I tried to be efficient as possible. 
---
I think 1 week is super hardcore, if you don't plan on doing anything else than playing.
---
If I take a week off, I also would want to sleep longer in the morning and do some stuff. 
---
You also would need to have a route planed out for you. Make sure you don't need to cook, so prep food. 
---
1 week is really crazy to hit 60.
---
But 1 week will get you really far ahead of the curve, if that is your goal.
---
I would want 1 week off around lvl 40. I always feel like the middle takes the longest to lvl up. 59 to 60 is like done in an blink of an eye. Lol
---
This is why I play PvP servers.
---
So you want more spawns for black lotus but still say that dhk's killed world pvp?
---
Vanilla honor system specially promotes team play by making you play premades in order to gain r14, and to get into those premades you most often need to show your fellow players that you're worth it.
---
Cap respect cost at 5g also kills world pvp by making people farm less gold aka they can sit more in the cities etc. Also it will have a bad impact on general economy.
---
Yea. I'll have to scour around the web and see if I can find. 
---
Screens hots can be used for layout only though. But the design of buttons and fonts etc can't exactly be copied. 
---
This may be an unpopular opinion but I'm actually fine with upgrades to the graphics assuming that it is a choice, I definitely don't think it is OK to force updated graphics on people who clearly want a classic client/experience but if it is a choice you can toggle on or off then I don't see the harm as it is a personal choice.
---
In my mind it doesn't affect the gameplay of other people other than yourself so it doesn't really matter so much.
---
im sure there's a wow fan thats a graphic designer out there somewhere that would be willing to help you if you actually go through with this.
---
Probably. I will put it up on github and make it open source so people can add to it. 😊
---
that'd be awesome, how do you plan on making it?
---
Yep, everytime we got to imps in MC i just turned camera to the ceiling and hoped i don't DC.
---
Good job there will never be one then
---
You dumbass
---
You know it's really odd I can't find any. I'll throw my old install discs in and see if I can record it for ya.

I was annoyed when they took my keyring away. Particularly because it took so long to get all of the keys, the school one seemed never ending at the time, but I was so happy when I finally got it!
---
Fairly simple, .net core with wpf. Which would allow for it to work on both Unix and windows systems.
---
Awesome stuff, I’d say I could help but I only know java and a wee bit of C#
---
So don’t play a hybrid class then? It’s quite simple. Play the classes that the game is designed to be good at the things that you want your character to be good at. 
---
It’s not like the game owes you something along the lines of making the class fit the way YOU wait it to work. It’s the other way around. 
---
I feel like we should focus on classic until we actually know that we’ll be satisfied with it, before trying to figure out what we want after classic
---
Ya you will rarely reach see people getting to the point of that gear on a ret paladin , atleast the Naxx pieces that is .
---
The video is a mimic video of the kill suit that a player named Drakova made . The guy had a decent amount of knowledge about rets and a good amount of informational videos on his youtube page .  Unfortunately i believe he removed all of his youtube content in preparation for classic &amp; with the idea of starting up a new kind of series. But i do agree on how hard it is getting the req gear , but you can get to a similar point in scaling with just the AQ set + some offpieces that are not hard to get at all .Shadowreckoning just melts thru almost anything once you reach that point

If your coming back. Enjoy your your time to 60. Dont rush it. Its fun
---
It is for people who do t want to sit around for 5 hours trying to finish the 1-6 zone.
---
It doesn’t build community just pisses people off.
---
It might take a while, but I dont think #nochanges will ever last. There will always be the solid core of classic players, but eventually too many people will leave when they dont feel like rurunning stuff for the 100th time. When that happens Blizzard will have to change *something*. Be it balancing, content that was supposed to be in vanilla in the first place, TBC, etc.
---
I mean, at this point it's really easy for blizzard to launch multiple different servers with different expansions. Not sure if it's profitable and they would do it, but it would be easy enough.
---
I hope they get some good devs like Old school RS and add some more content 
---
I certainly don't want any of the expansions. I *might* be open to them developing classic in the future if they stay in Azeroth and just add additional content etc. However each expansion they made also took away from the original quality of the game.
---
This topic has been pretty much chewed to death.
---
If Classic is a commercial success, Classic-TBC is pretty much a certainty at some later point because corporations like making money and for many people TBC was peak WoW. If and when this happens there will almost certainly not be a forced migration because people would lose their shit, and there will almost certainly be optional migration or copying or something.
---
Additional post-Naxx content will almost certainly not happen because it would be so much cheaper and easier to do Classic-TBC than to make up an equivalent amount of new content from scratch, and because the 1.x game mechanics start to break down at the Naxx gear level and would probably break down completely if you shoehorned in Tier 4 gear without changing the fundamental mechanics.
---
There will be entitled whiners in this thread who think that it would be massively unfair to release Classic-TBC because then everyone will stop wanting to play Classic-vanilla with them, and they want everyone to be forced to play Classic-vanilla with them forever. I do not think pleasing those people is very high on Blizzard's list of priorities, and it is almost certainly lower on the list than "making money" so we do not need to worry about those people.
---
i swear ive done 50-60 faster than 40-50 before
---
so if you clear it in 4h and farm 26h a week, or if you clear it in 30h and farm 0h a week, is it then not the same level of effort? with the difference being that for 30h of raiding, you need all the other 39 players to be online at the same 30h a week, wheras you can farm whenever you want to during the 26h for the consumables.
---
so yeah, you don't need the consumables, but it's easier to have a guild with 40+ ppl who can take 1-2 evenings out of their RL than to take 5-6 evenings out of their RL for a fixed time
---
I think the main issue with this is MMO aspect of the game. You need community to keep Classic going, but how many players will stay long after everything is finished? Of course, Classic can keep going for more than 2 years and still be strong, but 5 or 10?
---
When I started playing WoW, I knew nothing about it and joined first private server I found (I am from central Europe, so I lived the pirate life just like everyone else around me). Said server was a ghost town and I just rarely met other players. Seeing 3 70s in Orgrummar was memorable experience for me due to sheer amount of players there.
---
Sure, you can quest in environment like this, even find a guild to do a dungeon or two, but things like AV, raids or large-scale world PvP? You need big community for that and I don´t think that will exist if Blizzard just leaves Classic going on forever in its finished state.

Bbymods first day
---
Hey hey hey, I was on a 100mbit fiber back then through my uni-dorm :)
---
He's even sporting a flat-top. 5/7 perfect score.
---
Do we even know what version of loot trading we will get?
---
One version of it any item that was need rolled couldn’t be traded.
---
Today I would never move into a home that doesn't have support for fiber with 250mbit at the very least.
---
assuming you do something between 5-6 days played which means a good route and knowledge of how to level fast, even 18 hours a day for a week falls short.   can be done if hunter/warlock or aoe mage though
---
What else to do with it. Here money can mean assets as well btw.
---
play normally the first week, with 9 hours a day youll still be ahead of the curve then take holiday on the second week once youre sure the servers are stable.  youll hit 60 and be farming pre bis that 2nd week.  imagine taking that first week holiday and the servers are crashing or whatever, waste of time.
---
I’ll fite u m8!  1v1 Goldshire/Org.  I’ll reck u, I swear on me mum!
---
;)
---
Shamans and Paladins, ez. Whichever one in your guild that wants it enough to grind out the materials/gold needed to make it.
---
It was only unhealthy if you went for the rank. Reason it was unhealthy was because other players were willing to put in that many hours, so you had to compete with them.
---
Only way to fix this is to give the rank to more players, and thus diluting the achievement, and that in my book is a no-no. The tangible achievements in Vanilla was one of the things that made it special.
---
Will you be able to front stab mobs in Classic? 
---
Thanks for the corrections 👌
---
My first hero was a keyboard turning klicker mage. I got rekt by a grey rogue in STV. Didn´t even use an opener just walked by and began to backstab. 
---
Well you will. Everyone else will have accumulated much more honor than you while you were gone, and you then need to catch up, requiring a lot of time.
---
In fact, the decaying mechanism makes sure that people that didn't start PVP from day 1 have a chance to compete, since the people that accumulated a shit ton to get their rank 14 takes a break and their honor decays. If it doesn't decay, then the goal post keeps being pushed further and further away with time.
---
I don’t know which part is supposed to be fun, seems largely pointless
---
As I said, you're probably correct that some of these things won't detract from the core philosophy of the game. There's probably a bit of nostalgia in here as well. I'm all for choice, and if there's a more modern UI that makes more sense, then I'm not 100% against.
---
I won't blindly yell "NO CHANGES!!11", as long as it doesn't mess with the game play, feeling of achievements and community etc.
---
Bring back the launcher + make a stand alone website for Classic with the old website layout, old forums, avatars and screen shot of the day etc.
---
I feel like they're sitting on a gold mine and they don't even realize it.
---
Not if you never rolled Alliance? And calling this "iconic" is just...well it's a thing alright. 
---
Does he have the right type of stick up his butt to simulate the human male walk?

Yes please!

---
Owning this weapon is my end goal for my shaman. I've always wanted it. Any of tips to lock it in? I was planning on doing BS and all that as well since I think it's one of the more interesting professions.
---
I will probably be maining a Pally when Classic launches to heal in raids. I enjoy the slow, but methodical gameplay that the class offers while leveling. It just feels nice to place to me. So you can count on me to be there as one of the few Pallys

Hi, /u/Lomidrev
---
Assets arent really a thing in Wow, as everything you use binds to your character, thus making it worthless to everyone else.
---
Hey, Shout out yo ICO for a sick video. His editing and intro have improved massivly and he deservse alot of praise for these!!!
---
The gold old times where my PC almost caught fire, because of such epic shit 😌
---
Great set of rules. I agree with most of them and it's always great to see someone follow the honorable path. I'm pretty much the same as you in all respects except that I have a little subclause about helping my own faction. I'll do it happily in most situations but I won't interfere with a good 1v1 that I come across especially if it's between two capable pvp specs. Also sometimes I come across a fellow Hordesman acting like a dick and I won't bail them out when the tables turn. 
---
Easy, look into old wow private server repacks. I remember some of them having customisable oldschool launchers.
---
mate are you fucking daft?
---
Kill them all.
---
I'll never kill a lowbie but throwing one a sap once in awhile is fair game.
---
lol strange guys, I'm ruthless. I wait until they are on low life from mobs then finish them. I attack whne they are afk, i attack during fishing or looting. War is war u know. Ain't got time for corpse camping tho, thats boring and pointless imo
---
Agreed, my feeling at the moment is that adding tiers beyond Naxx would take away from the quality of the game. While continuously getting new content / knowing there will be more soon in WoW can be interesting, I know a lot of players are frustrated by the inability to really beat the game.
---
Aah of course! Thanks. I Will do that. 
---
I don't think the stuff you guys remove or don't remove is very fair. I seen some other people's cosplay stuff be posted here and be less relevant to Classic than this, but nothing was done about it.
---
Remember times when game devs used to make a good game and it was just that? No people screaming for "moar content", no paid DLCs, no rushing through content to clear before the next expansion or update. Good times.
---
Rules that i will strive to live by
---
*Classic fans hate him!*
---
Have you played Retribution before on Vanilla?
---
Vaguely non-vague.
---
We want NOCHANGES, ACTIBLIZZ!!!! That includes patching out this glitch! Keep it vanilla!

"If it bleed, I can kill it. If I can kill it, I attacc." - Arnold Swartzemcnugget. 
---
I will camp maybe one or two times (3 too much, I don't want to waste muh time :D), if they have attacc me first.
---
I don't feel like being a carebear as I was in 2005. I think you gotta live by the sword and die by the sword though, if you get ganked afterwards, you gotta take it like a champ and not get salty.
---
None of that "don't attack while fishing or gathering or attacking a mob.". 
---
Lowbies are not off the table. Actually okay depends how low and the situation.
---
Starting zone does not affect my race choice at all. It is only a small paragraph within the pages of my character’s chronicle.
---
The early Forsaken zones are great but I'd lie if I said I didn't book it to Orgrimmar and the Barrens as soon as I hit level 10 or so. The questing is just great over there.
---
ofcourse, we will also demand that the game can only play on decade old hardware and box screens
---
thought this was the warrior from lineage2
---
I played the day vanilla released. I played a TON but it still took like 4 months to ding 60.
---
A few friends leveled really fast, and were some of the server firsts 60’s. They couldn’t do anything in game. There were no groups to be found. 
---
Classic will be a little different because most players know the mechanics and will level a lot faster, but if you go too fast, you may be alone at the top for awhile. 
---
Don't see anyone dissing them.
---
I will expect more from one though. 
---
I played a Holy Paladin and raided with it a bit (UBRS tho lol) on a private server, so I know it's actually quite easy. It seems like one of the easier healers to gear in my opinion. Granted I played it on the 1.12 patch, so Whitesoul Helmet was up on the AH for like 35ish gold if I remember? Couldn't have been less.
---
But yeah I'm surprised I didn't need to buy any elixirs or what not.
---
Or maybe that just reflects the true difficulty of Vanilla raids, when you have a guild that knows what they're doing.
---
Or maybe it doesn't because it was a private server.
---
We shall see.
---
Warrior takes the longest to level, mage is waaaay faster.
---
Both are top tier raiders, but as a tank you ll find a spot easier.
---
I don't initiate on a fellow Druid, otherwise Red=Ded
---
Oh so when you write better graphics you mean view distance? I always thought view distances was server based and not graphics.
---
If youre just going to be playing casually play a mage
---
You'll be 60 faster
---
Having ports will literally save you days in playtime
---
And you can make your own food and farm efficently without having to rely on anyone else

Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.

Removed, rule 3. Don't try and start a witch hunt if you disagree with something a mod does, bring it up by Modmail. 
---
The original post has been re-approved.
---
&gt; But I also see a lot of discussion about how MC40 can be effectively done by 25 efficient raiders. 
---
10 efficient mythic raiders can also effectively do 25 men LFR in retail.
---
MC is EASY RAIDING content, and so is LFR in retail.
---
In both cases, the fact that EFFICIENT raiders can do EASY content is IRRELEVANT.
---
&gt; Say what you want about retail, raiding is objectively more difficult. 
---
Difficulty is a variable concept. Which is more difficult : winning a formula 1 race or winning the marathon? There is no OBJECTIVE answer. It cannot ever be.
---
&gt; but at the end of the day many classes in vanilla go in and press one button. 
---
Not all the time, and not in all circumstances. And even if what you say it's true, that still doesn't mean EASY. Based on your logic, a sniper job is easy, because all he have to do it pull the trigger, right? Ignore everything else, like HOW he got to his shooting position, wind, elevation, terrain, distance, and many other factors. The "press one button guy" in Vanilla raiding had to spend weeks leveling, weeks more gearing up, have a steady raid presence, be a good guild member, farm for consumables, enchant his gear properly, etc.
---
Sure, pressing ONE BUTTON is not difficult...GETTING THERE IS.
---
&gt; In vanilla, people didn’t all show up with flasks, and pots, and BIS gear 
---
WHAT "people"? The 85% of the player base that is casual? Sure, they did NOT. And this is WHY they never make it past MC. In retail, the gear is irrelevant, and any 25 casual players can STILL complete heroic raiding. Vanilla casuals were limited to MC, being unable to complete the OTHER 3 more difficult raids, while in retail, casuals can complete LFR, normal and heroic, being unable to complete ONLY the mythic raid. This FACT alone means that Vanilla raiding was MUCH MORE DIFFICULT for the CASUAL players, which, both in Vanilla and retail, were 80-85% of the player base.
---
&gt; You might argue that there is more time spent farming and getting people together and preparing for raids in classic 
---
Yes, we will ALWAYS argue this, because this is also DIFFICULT TO DO. It doesn't involve skill, but that doesn't mean it is EASY. 
---
In the end, the conclusion IS CRYSTAL CLEAR : The VAST MAJORITY of the Vanilla player base (the casuals) were UNABLE (due to LACK OF : time, organization, logistics, discipline, commitment) to complete BWL, AQ40 and Naxx, while in Retail, the VAST MAJORITY of the player base (the casuals), DESPITE LACKING time, organization, logistics, discipline, commitment, are able to complete ALL RAID TIERS, except one : mythic.
---
This is A FACT, not a supposition. 
---
And this means that, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSES, the Vanilla raiding is MORE DIFFICULT than retail, for the VAST MAJORITY OF THE PLAYERS.
---
Multiple and complex mechanics are IRRELEVANT when ALL CLASSES in retail have the means to COUNTER THEM. It doesn't make the mythic raiding more difficult...it just makes it more complex, but also gives each player the means to counter them. The simplicity of mechanics in Vanilla doesn't mean that the raiding was easier, because most players didn't have any counter to those mechanics, except WALKING.
---
I am not even going to throw in the AGGRO AND THREAT from Vanilla, the mana and rage management, the MISS, the HIT, the RESISTS, the CRITICAL HITS and CRUSHING BLOWS, the RESISTANCE GEAR, etc., things that while DO NOT REQUIRE pressing more buttons, require IN DEPTH knowledge of your class, your limits as a certain class, how and WHEN to use powerful abilities (that were on VERY LONG COOLDOWNS in Vanilla, unlike Retail), positioning, etc. etc.
---
The above things (except positioning) DO NOT EXIST IN RETAIL. Those things required USING YOUR BRAIN STRATEGICALLY back in Vanilla, and today they only require FAST REACTIONS, because using your brain in Retail is no longer required, except WORLD FIRST races.
---
Yes, PRESSING one button is EASIER than pressing multiple buttons. And that is true...FOR RETAIL.
---
For Vanilla, to be the guy that presses one button in a Naxx raiding guild, requires more. A METRIC FUCKTON more.
---
Which makes it more difficult to ACHIEVE.
---
This has been removed as you last posted it just over a week ago.

Because I want to experience the authentic historical recreation of Vanilla.

Ofcourse I understand that I can never actually get the real authentic experience because the data before patch 1.12.1 is lost and we will have a new client etc, but the goal should always be authenticity and graphics is a big part of the Vanilla feeling.
---
&gt; How do you all feel about the museum vs. additional content debate?
---
Museums constantly have new exhibitions though. They don't stay the same, and bar for reference purposes, people don't go back. 
---
There'll be some people who want to play Classic as it is forever, and that's great, but I'll get bored and quit, and I don't really want to. There's only so many times I want to give up my evenings to kill the boss I've already killed from a different angle, my time is precious. 
---
If I wanted to re-run the same content over and over, well, BfA does that pretty well with 4 difficulty modes per raid boss, and infinite difficulties per Dungeon. I explicitly don't like that.
---
Hilarious as fuck. I fled from org to crossroads when I saw the lowbies and people around AH/Mailbox dying.
---
Landed, chatted and got diseased by someone else landing then I did my best to infect as many lowbies as I could at the nearest oasis (WC) one 
---
What mattered imo was the attunement for content, the key+keyring was just the way to materialize it in the game before achievements appeared. 
---
You had to work your way to access content , not simply show up or talk to a couple npcs as it is now in most MMOs sadly.
---
Damn, group content, how could dev dared to propose such things ;)
---
It depends if you want to tank or not. I can see a casual player enjoying both, but it would take a more dedicated player to play as a warrior. You can also level both at the same time to maximize rested bonus if you'd like. The point is to have fun so play whichever is more fun. You may also want to think about getting a friend to join the game and level with. Regardless of class I fpund leveling with a friend to be the most fun way to play WoW.
---
 /clap great moderation here huh
---
THIS.
---
Whomever does the most pvp and wants to grind 200 hours gold ready beforehand l
---
There's a river in Hillsbrad Foothill that stretches itself all the way to Western Plaguelands with turtles walking near the riverbank. My friends and I were moving northwards, questing there to get meat for a quest in Southshore, when we walk into a group of three horde scum grinding said turtles aswell. Keep in mind our group consisted of a rogue, druid and mage. My friend playing a gnome mage scouted ahead and tried to bait them in. They took the bait and my friend, playing the mage, managed to buy us some time to sneak around and open on their backline. Turned into a quick slaughter, but we ran into them multiple times during that day with back and forth battles. Loved the feeling of sneaking around and the fact that horde can't help themselves of attacking gnomes!
---
Good times.
---
So since it was always like that, it's an okay thing to do?
---
So now you want to turn a subreddit ban into a full site ban for avoiding a ban. Smooth. Nobody will believe you, classic is not some mecca of social justice for ninjas. You post "Proof" with no names but the one you are accusing of being a ninja and expect anyone to take you seriously? 
---
It is more likely they will out you as the one doing it, contend that you are a ninja and the whole thing devolves into "he said, she said" like all these ninja accusations and nothing happens. 
---
In vanilla you would see these accusations on a daily basis in chat, generally one or two people spamming about how this other guy is a ninja. The other guy and his buddies say it never happened, and those guys are just salty because he won a roll or because the accuser was kicked for being a jerk. People see the drama, and ignore it because neither of them is credible enough to make a difference. 
---
Then the fun when they go to his guild leader, and accuse him of being a cheater. The guild leader laughs his ass off, tells the whole guild about the whiny idiot bothering him and the whole guild starts trolling them. 
---
People have this idea that ninjas got blacklisted and shunned, but for the most part it was just noise. Those people will get plenty of groups, and often the guy making the accusations is the one shunned because nobody wants to play with a crybaby.
---
You can hit 60 in a week, but you will have to omit dungeons, as they will take a lot of time. 
---
You think server draws the graphics to your screen? 
---
After Naxx I want fresh. When the fresh realms reach Naxx, I want merge and fresh. On the side I want TBC Classic.
---
I'm not interested in a new game. All new games I have played have been worse than Vanilla and TBC so far...
---
Whichever you pick, with a name like yours, you need to go Gnome. 
---
I disagree with the last part- Warrior tanks are often locked in guilds ASAP, and finding a Main Tank or Off Tank role as one is much harder than DPS.
---
On retail, yes.
---
Imagine thinking no changes need making. So many changes do, well over 80% of players that play classic wouldn’t have even played back in TBC days, mostly private server heroes. No changes would be ridiculous, shit like inspect range and macros are mandatory changes. Facts. 
---
That would be an immediate reroll from me. Slain by Kobolds until gear broken.
---
The pussy deleted his comment, haha.
---
Omfg. Thats hilarious
---
&gt;&gt;people just don't really expect a twink healer and get all excited, it's great.
---
&gt;So what's great about a twink disc priest?
---
What. It's just entertaining to me because a twink healer turns other people into monsters. Especially when you get another 49 twink to heal. Even in cross-realm BG's people will frequently whisper you because they love it so much. Honestly it's the most social BG's that I ever had post-cross-realm BG's.
---
When I am talking about view distance I am talking about players and NPC's and that data comes from the server. You have always been able to set a custom view distance in WoW and see and empty word for as far away as your graphics card can handle...
---
I mean they said that but Obsido went quite far with his conclusions there.
---
That comment shows that you havent played Vanilla.
---
You could use macros to increase the view distance beyond the maximum in the menu...
---
Fuck, who the hell is cutting onions here
---
I agree, take the osrs approach and keep adding content like this, and classic can remain with an active community for decades 
---
Strange of you to think that it’ll be hard to get to naxx, there’s so minimal to do in Vanilla, with how much players brains have advanced from 2005 to now, you’ll see so many T3 heated players not many months after Naxx releases. You have no idea at how low the skill ceiling of WoW is, especially vanilla, but you’ll downvote because I’ve stated a fact that goes against your agenda. 
---
A pity, people act elitist around Vanilla. 
---
&gt; o be fair, I actually do really think it was important for gear to have the player crafter's name on it. 
---
Did they remove this? I have gear crafted in BFA for the Waist of time secret and that still has "made by ....." on it. 
---
Yes, this is a relic from patch 1.7 when shadow weaving was introduced, many people glossed over it or still dismissed Shadow Priests as viable, but the few who knew of this stacking debuff would often band up 3-5 shadow priests and wreck mayhem. A group of 5 could spam mindflay which was off GCD also back then, getting over + 800% shadow damage in a matter of seconds. They would go on to down raid bosses in record time before being fixed, the dream dragons, rag, capital city leaders, etc-

Little offtopic question:
---
How does this subreddit feels changes? No changes at all? Small +% tweaks to make specs viable? or QOL changes is ok?
---
/u/babyhoof resign from the classic wow mod team immediately.
---
We deserve mods capable of recognising classic starting sets.
---
That is the point, you don't need to do all that addon / macro crap in modern WoW &amp; any games. They are just normal settings in game menus. I prefer modern way more. Availability of this kind of stuff is important. Having such features behind console commands is just horrible.

Salty? Lol, I forgot what kind of place this is. I call him out in a lie, this is an obvious karma bait. Does the title "I can't wait to (for) to encounter this again..." not imply that this happened a very, very long time ago and not literally days ago? 
---
I literally stated that it's great if he gets some sort of satisfaction out of making up a story and writing it like he's stroking his cock while doing so.
---
Sorry!
---
yea, otherwise you gonna have another farmers/hackers/botters epidemic  
---
So when you talk about improved graphics you mean the exact same thing as original Vanilla graphics but with an different in-game menu with longer adjustment knobs? If that's the case then I'm ok with that. Ui changes that doesn't affect the gaming experience is fine.
---
depends. in case of pvp: with holy, you won't really notice a large difference between an unskilled player and a good one. with ret, well... 
---
take it with a grain of salt, since most of my experience comes from post-2.3 ret, but at that time, a well played ret was like the meanest kindergarten teacher, the one who takes away all the toys the kids have. you can't dot, you can't cc, you can't blind, the fucker can dispel everything. you can't even blink, since they have repentance, and even if you catch them with their pants down, they'll just blow a few cooldowns and be good as new.
---
however! there were significant differences between a well played and an idiotic (which 95% of them were) ret paladin, and that mainly comes down to situational awareness. a moron blew their cooldowns on themselves, while a good player helped their friendly neighborhood dps to deny shatter combos and fear locks and tear clothies to shreds, while occasionally bursting people down. a well played ret worked as a multiplier to the strength of his team, while a mediocre one was busy pointlessly chasing after enemies.
---
in case of pve... yeah, a braindead monkey could play either spec.
---
Okay, I see. Thanks for the explanation! 
---
But he was lying, so what the fuck are you talking about? YOU are the one being sad, buying into some guys fantasy and thinking "y-yes!!! this is what WOW is about!!!!" - YOU are the guy who'll be quitting in 2 weeks because some guy corpsecamps you, teabags your body and spams a "U S UC K" macro or something. 
---
Simple. No new characters can be created on the overpopulated faction/server unless the account already has a level 60 there. 
---
Free transfers both faction and server.
---
Finally, aggressively merging realms that are failing. Not as a last resort once it's already too late like they did on live, do it aggressively then if the realm gets overpopulated, offer transfers off of it. 
---
If they clearly had the chance to kill me while I was tanking two mobs or eating at 10% health, and choose not to, I’ll usually let them be
---
Do you guys have a Spotify or twitch channel I can listen too without having to eat up data watching the video?
---
I'm just gonna leave this one here. [The best reason to play a Paladin](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/k4zzj/the_best_reason_to_play_a_paladin/)
---
Basically yes. Also modern shaders and clutter looks nice without changing the models or textures itself. 
---
when playing a priest, I always disliked getting my hands dirty... let fear/mind control and that group of aggressive mobs nearby do the work for you. I call it "enhanced pulling".
---
I agree that there should always be a static server and reset seasons server that go through no changes. WE can have other servers that do progress or get new classic content but there should always be at least 1 constant vanilla server.
---
It takes a normal player 8-10 days to reach 60. And when I say days, I mean days as in 24h. So 192-240h of game play and there are 168h in one week...
---
I let 1v1 fights finish. Then kill the red guy if he won.
---
My thoughts are, that I'm going to start saving all those 200 discussions about naxx. 
---
And repost them when naxx gets released. It's gonna be glorious. 
---
Limit everyone below 60 to rank 7 or 8. As for the making twinking easier, why does that matter? God forbid there is a little more competition
---
I’ll tell ya what, if you want challenge as a Pally, try being a raid tank. You won’t be MT, but yes, it can be done.
---
Initial reports from the demo are that no, front stabbing will not work on blizzard servers.  
---
I believe the release date is July 16th, according to some guy who has a mother in law with a 6th sense for planning vacations that will ruin his life.  Seems legit.  
---
Is there any information about pricing? If it will be surrrent sub price for regular WoW I'll probably stick to private servers :/
---
The initiation of a fight in my eyes is not when the first attack lands but when the Alliance walk in my direction. If I see them turn and come toward me then it's on. I don't wait for them to target me, you'll just make yourself a target by letting others dictate the terms. 
---
Hunters are KoS. From experience they are incapable of leaving you alone and so they will be killed. 
---
I don't initiate fights if the enemy is fighting a mob or fishing. There is no sport in killing low levels in one hit either. But if someone kills me when I'm low from killing a mob then I'll corpse camp them for the next 30 minutes or so. 
---
Erm, not yet on the Spotify... I'll have a look into that when I'm back home :) what about soundcloud? 
---
Never used sound cloud, only the first two. Currently biting the bullet though and watching on YouTube at work. Great episode so far :)
---
Awww thanks a lot Jon! Sorry about you having to work on a Sunday though! 
---
It’s all good, 8 hours of double pay and vacation starts tomorrow XD
---
Nice one! :D
---
Shouldn't this gear be painted on tho?  Gonna have to ding this a point, 9/10 cosplay. 
---
I'm Pro post-naxx 40 man content, but I'd want classic and the toons created there preserved (i.e. new content would be accessed by the copying of the classic toon to a new server, while preserving the museum piece of classic).  I wouldn't play a classic TBC because the move from 40 mans was the first of many huge changes to the game that ruined the social dynamics of wow (there are other issues with TBC as well, but the move from 40 mans with the addition of another class really screwed up guild rosters and the dynamics that supported and composed raiding).  
---
I won't pretend that it's likely to happen, as pointed out by Dragonadept, because the easier cash grab is just rehashing tbc and wotlk, but I can dream of them not following in the same mistaken footsteps and an alternative evolution of WoW.  
---
Be a supportive player. Obtain an officer role within a guild. Strive to be the best at your chosen or given role. Constantly talk about your dream of owning the weapon. 
---
Mage for a casual player. Best CC, among best dps, brings food/water. 
---
Warrior takes alot more dedication and its harder to find groups unless you are willing to tank 5-mans. However if you want to raid as a tank it takes alot more dedication and its a money sink which rimes bad with warriors as they are probably the worst farmer. 
---
4 strength 4 star leather belt?
---
I don't know why you bring effort into all of this. Never said what requires the most effort or skill or whatever. I just said every consumables in the game is not required, and all the private server folks who claim they are annoy me. Because they aren't.
---
The reason we spent 20 - 30 hours in naxx was because every raid was pretty much a progress raid. The strategies for the bosses were not known and we had to figure them out. Which is why the private server mentality about consumables is laughable. You essentially outgear the content via buffs while knowing all the strategies for the bosses and claim that this buffing is required. I have no problem with people using everything that is in-game to kill a boss, I dislike the world buffs though and wish they were removed from instances. But don't claim it to be required.
---
Will people finally stop being ignorant and realize that holy pallies are far more than just buffbots in raids? We're the original heal sniper, and in most times, are able to out heal priests.
---
Thanks for the share! I really appreciate it, and glad you like the video. I’ve been enjoying your streaming as much as I can out here when bandwidth allows for it. 
---
are the logos swapped? the left one looks more like pserver/vanilla client than the right one 
---
Nice try. 
---
But lets look at reality. Most people who start a game, never finish it. The game that I'm sharing is a GOTY, so the numbers are HIGHLY unusual.
---
My recent game has 156 hours in game time, since I in general make it my Quest to finish games from start to finish and do everything.
---
1 Achievement done by 51,9 %, so only half the people did make it past the tutorial.
---
The endboss Achievement: 26,9%
---
So not only did people not make it through the tutorial, which is equal to the leveling process in WoW Classic.
---
25% just stopped playing somewhere along the way. Which is perfectly normal. Maybe Blizzard releases a new expansion. You die. Maybe you find a more exciting game. (I'm totally pumped for Cyberpunk 2077.) Your whole live can change in a year.
---
So from 100% of the people only 26,9% made it to the End. Which in Classic is Kel'Thuzad.
---
Lets say Naxx will take 1 1/2 years to get released, which is in my opinion already very fast. You have to play on a regular bases for 1 1/2 years. Because it's highly unlikely that you can just jump into Naxx in T1, so you have to invest a lot of time into your character BEFORE the raid is even released. On top of that, you have the drama of 40 people, the summer break, which can make your whole Guild go BOOM.
---
You don't have the patience nor the endurance to wait for the game to be released, but you tell me that everyone here has the patience and the dedication to spend over a year at a game, when most players don't even have that endurance in easy single player games, where you can finish everything in about 2-3 months in your own time?
---
If the difficulty of Naxx is your only issue, than you are fucking delusional, about what it takes in Classic to make it all the way through. Classic is not a sprint to T3, where you can plan anything right now. It's a fucking marathon and only the people with endurance, will make it all the way through.
---
Left
---
What did the mod say?
---
Nah he won’t be alone. First MCs will start clearing after 2 or 3 weeks.
---
Why does the left one have the same lighting issues as my demo client then? My private server log in screen isn't that bright.
---
Tyyy :&gt;
---
We only got one over entire vanilla, and it was the world first to be crafted. We got it in our first kill and it just went to whoever hade the most dkp. A dps warrior, had to wait before he could craft it though because even if we got to borrow other guild ingots there weren't enough of them on the server in total for him to craft it when it dropped.
---
No worries, I am sure you can find the old repacks on either RageZone if that is still alive or ownedcore (known as MMowned back in the day). Good luck!
---
I don't believe this, because he would have just killed you in the span of a single intercept stun
---
Fucking brilliant 
---
Do you want more pixeled wow classic weapons? Which ones? 
---
Respond here and I'll do the most voted for this week.
---
Gonna play horde but all the horde areas suck. Alliance areas are way better imo and way more fun. Favorite is probably the NE path, Teldrassil into Darkshore into Ashenvale. Just love the atmosphere and it awe struck me when I leveled my first char in some wow vanilla beta.
---
let the button mashing begin
---
I was stuck rocking a dial-up connection of like 64k for the first 4 years I played.
---
Because there is no cow level.
---
The idea is that it comes with the current game subscription so you will have access to both games 
---
level 8 paladin twink
---
no class is hard to play as evident by the fact that children played vanilla  
---
paladins are just for braindead and handicapped people probably  
---
All you say is that you love them being your buff bitch  
---
more spawns =/= more spawn locations   
---
not really, as i said, from my experiance 5g is a better gold sink then 50g ergo you need to farm more gold. DHK killed organized wpvp, town/city raids. 
---
so your argument would be that people could clear Naxxramas in 4h even without all the consumes and world buffs, or without a significant portion of the consumes or something? and that the 30h/week naxx of vanilla would not happen again, even without consumes? how much time do you expect to play each week in naxxramas if most of the raid isn't using consumes? or if all aren't using consumes?
---
There is a chance for them to create the best MMO ever if they add more stuff and continue regular patch content cycles like throughout the game's life span.  
---
So yes I would be very much against them just leaving the game for the dead after its been played out.  
---
I want my zergling
---
&gt;no clue how long it took me to get to 60 and back then I had elementary school to go to :) 
---
I would wager €100 that it took you between 3 and 6 months  :D
---
Nope.
---
As a rogue, I always wait until they're engaged in a fight with something else. But otherwise I stick to those codes. 
---
What was it?
---
I only really ask because I'm going to make a healer for a bracket. Just not sure if it's going to be druid or priest. 
---
Transmogs for one, and now that personal loot exists, that's another reason. 
---
I'd talk to a doctor, bud!
---
Probably that it had nothing to do with classic, based off of these comments.
---
If that's the case it's pretty sad. I hope the team forces him to go play classic.
---
I'll bet my left testicle that Activision sticks their nose into classic wow . Somehow someway micro transactions will be introduced . Not at first Tho. First they get you committed and addicted through 1 or 2 years of great game play and then WHAMM! NEW CLASSIC STYLE MOUNT FOR JUST 4.99 USD! HURRY UP BECAUSE SOON THEY WILL HIBERNATE 
---
but who the fuck am I kidding I'll be downloading that shit at 12 am and playing all over again just hoping for a taste of that sweet sentimental molten core rain
---
Exactly, all reasons that going back to Wrath system would be stupid. 
---
&lt;3
---
Well he won't be alone for sure. There are always people willing to clear content as fast as possible and classic is not an exception. 
---
&gt; Transmogs for one, and now that personal loot exists, that's another reason.
---
Let's try it again. What is the reason to add it to Classic?
---
Is that Edward Snowden?
---
Yes.
---
First off, I'm confused, what reason do YOU think they're adding loot trading for? In particular why do you think they're adding back the old wrath system that they already deemed to be bad? 
---
Second, I already outlined the primary reason they're adding it to Classic earlier. Not my fault you didn't read it. 
---
Seems like the Game Culture goes into an revive Classic Games direction anyway... same with MMORPG's 
---
I'm in a camp that says if we get classic wow, and I love it as I hope I will, and get 2 or 3 good years from it, then I'm happy. If what comes next is classic tbc, or new 1.x content, or fresh vanilla servers, or nothing new at all, I'm still happy. I'll unsub when I get bored. I'm only really unhappy if they cock it up in the first place.
---
IIRC, only horde will run arms warriors, and they would want BRE (and hammer spec is inferior). So I guess it could go to any veteran player in the guild that wants it? 
---
Gold in none issue you could farm ore and craft enchanting rods, or sell bars
---
Go full affliction and Dot and wand with VW until dark pact and then have a passive imp for infinite Mana and drain tank for immortality. While it may seem technically possible to start drain tanking at 24 with fel concentration it's really kinda a terrible idea because you'll go oom a lot and won't have the raw damage and survivability of a higher character. Wait until 40 or at least mid to high 30s and you'll have a much better time drain tanking.
---
Errroahhhh
---
"Removed - rule 1"
---
r/roastme material
---
I know its a small thing, but the Classic sub text under the WoW logo really needs to go in my opinion. 
---
#RealWoWLogo
---
Yeah they changed warrior starter gear to have 2h weapon sometime late Wrath.
---
&gt; About half the R13/R14 locks I've ever seen on the Horde side were UD.
---
Incredible that they weren't somehow prevented from mindless grinding by their weaker race. 
---
The keyring was a damn godsend for me. Prot warrior trying to carry your keys, all your extra gear and then trying to pick up ANYTHING was awful. Keyring saved me like a whole damn bag.
---
more spawn locations = less world pvp as I said, less contention for BL because of the added spawn locations.
---
more spawns =/= higher amount of spawns
---
And how is it a better gold sink? 50g x1-2 times a week is still more than 5g even 9 times a week. Having lower respec cost could also eat the viability of hybrid classes / hybrid specs because of the smaller gold cost.
---
DHK's didnt kill organized wpvp, it killed orgazined leveling zone destroying with astranaar as an example. Organized world pvp was still easily possible in BRM / Silithus etc.
---
City raids still happened after DHK's anyways.
---
Still looks better than the current FFXIV launcher
---
I think all scenes will be larger, and the one to benefit the most will be the RP servers. Unfortunately there will be a lot more toxicity I fear, and normal servers may be plagued by stream fanbois. Rp servers will hopefully become just more skewed with people trying to dodge that sort of playstyle
---
Treat people who abuse the system the same way we treat people who ninja - black list them and make it known to the server they are untrustworthy. Simple. 
---
Don't orcs also have a bonus to axe specialization? So less need for hit gear should I go enhance?
---
Honestly, there are better weapons for warriors in BWL. More of pally weapon imo.
---
"Limit everyone below 60 to rank 7 or 8"
---
What if some people want to start ranking up before lvl 60 tho ?
---
You see, just for a change that seem little that you want (xp off), we need to change other thing to make it work (and what if these other things we need to change have other unforeseen consequences ? We continue to change a few more things ?)  This is literally a slippery slope.
---
"As for the making twinking easier, why does that matter?"
---
Part of the challenge of twinking back then was planning ahead to not overlevel, it matter because this is a big change to twinking, it matter because people are looking for this challenge like back in vanilla.
---
If you plan on lvling all the classes to 60 it’s not a bad idea to get a main up and running ASAP. Farming is much easier when your uncontested :P
---
#nochanges. It was in vanilla so it will be in classic
---
Yea they make have been basic when it comes to damage abilities for scripted content, but a good ret paladin has a lot more to be aware of than just kill the target. 
---
Dispels, blessing management, cc, spot heals. Knowing when to focus fire the target and when to take a more support oriented role. 
---
Sure you could just throw on a seal and auto attack, but that’s really only playing a fraction of the class. 
---
This is 100% true. Pally Talents for healing were broken as fuck. Mana efficiency was crazy high and as long as you have enough crit you prob should never run out. With the right gear setup they could FOL spam endlessly.
---
They were added pretty late after release, right? 
---
If they're smart they'll add classic-esque micro transactions into retail and leave classic alone 
---
Druid
---
old skool mechanical keyboards are actually very good, and sought after
---
Hope to see your documentary! Ask Blizz to pit this event in for ZG!
---
I remember alot of people not having mounts at 40 cause they couldn't afford it. 
---
We convinced a friend to start playing a couple months after release. We really tried to drill into him that he needed to be efficient with his good if he wanted a mount at level 40.
---
When he was about level 15, he told all of us that someone in Undercity just opened trade and gave him 52 gold and "some blue armor but it's not even the right type".
---
After we explained  BoP and BoE, he gave me the two BoE items and requested that I handle selling them and split the profit 50/50. It was a good day.
---
Almost everything you read about raiding on this subreddit is written from the perspective of elitists or tryhards. If you find a guild that respects people's work/life balance (90% of guilds) then you'll spend minimal effort/gold on consumables.
---
&gt;A warrior can use a 1.5g free-action pot and absolutely destroy any mage.
---
well, unless the mage also has lips/faps and waits out the fap with iceblocks. Mage should still win. 
---
&gt;A warlock will resist nearly every spell of a mage with some T2 and his felhound out. 
---
felhunter only gives resistance if you are demo specced right? so SL locks. I'd agree that SL lock free wins vs mages, but other specs like SM/ruin i think good mages can win. 
---
Excellent video as always. I'm damn jealous of your editing, need you to teach me some classes :p
---
Let's make one then. I've been looking to join a guild that fits my schedule, but I think I'll have better luck just establishing one.  
---
I played a Horde warrior through most of vanilla on a PvP server and I don't have it in me to tank and be dependent on a healer all of the time, so alliance w/ a class \[TBD\] sounds good to me.
---
We could do either coast or meet somewhere in the middle, but my preference would be to do weekend raids where it would be "afternoon" everywhere when we start.
---
I don't really want to RL, but I will if I have to. There's definitely enough information out now to plan successful runs and progression, and as for managing 40 people including druids that want to dry-hump corpses in MC ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4NbR6ZP4IM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4NbR6ZP4IM))...can't be worse than managing software developers. :)
---
&gt; Classic can keep going for more than 2 years and still be strong, but 5 or 10?
---
This is the important question to me. The first time we get classic is going to be a big boom of people. But what happens after that? If they go the route of fresh servers in 3-4 years, will we see that same boom of players?
---
If this is super successful and they do Progressive servers to cash in on the other expansions people loved over time, Does classic come back every time we reach the Lich King? That would turn into a 6 year cycle assuming that the game doesn't continue though Cata and to live.
---
Ok
---
Level 18??
---
I want to be that druid, don't care if I'm just an innervate/bres bitch.
---
Because no matter what there's always someone salty. Whether it be jealousy or sheer boredom. There will always be negativity, it's human nature.
---
Very few people who played wow in 2004 would have had a 1960s mechanical keyboard. If they did it would have been in their garage out of indifference!
---
The majority of people around that time were still playing on rubber dome keyboards. There were a few cherry keyboards back then but they were extremely uncommon.
---
I don't know which is which. I like the one on the right better. But if I wasn't comparing them side by side it wouldn't matter at all.
---
I mean not gonna lie, kinda want to get a crt for classic wow lol
---
Don't ruin this man's dream! He'll never have enough money for it anyway!

They did not say that at all.

&gt;[This is something interesting but nothing decided or concrete on it...This also could be an exception where we somehow grant them for original CE owners. No idea. Interesting thing to think about though. I’ll mention it though that you guys are asking about the original CE pets for original CE owners.](https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1104312-please-reconsider-your-stance-on-retail-classic-reward-linking/)
---
This isn't going to be an authentic historical recreation and the sooner you come to terms with that the better.
---
This is what peak performance looks like
---
absolutely not. Why fight when you can FLY? 
---
I didn't have keys. I was a Rogue.
---
Where can I apply to be a mod? If someone with basic knowledge of classic can be a mod, so can I! Oh wow, he also deleted his comments...
---
Nothing to do with Corrupted Blood, but I remember an incident on Stormscale EU, where it literally started raining lvl1 characters.
---
Somehow these chars spawned way up in the air. Obviously, they died from the fall damage. So there was skeletons everywhere.
---
Everyone was running around looking up towards the sky confused. Hilarious.
---
A couple of hours later the server got booted. Word spread quickly of a server hack. Unfortunately, I don't remember if someone took credit for it.
---
&gt;Yea, Paladin is kinda easy but it doesn't make me love that motherfucker throwing a BoP on me any less,
---
I was under the impression that only horde players hate paladins
---
lol enjoy the mobile games
---
I swear, Ret palas are the most stubborn people in the world.
---
Yup, I played a warrior in vanilla. You will get A LOT of invites to 5 mans, but not a lot of raid invites unless you're a popularity contest winner in your guild for tanking, DPS is fine if you have the gear...but MT OT is generally set in stone. Everyone always needs mages. Leveling a warrior in vanilla is pure dogshit compared to a mage because you have no escape when things go sideways or pull adds, whereas a mage is like "oh good, more mobs to AoE" and can blink the fuck out and ice block, etc.
---
I'll say this for warrior, if you plan on doing the PvP rank grind thing, then they are invited A LOT for WSG. We ran 4 warriors and a resto shaman in the middle dropping Windfury and it was way more fun than anything I did in vanilla.
---
TLDR: casual mage, play frost, don't respec for anything and make money selling ports, food, and water.
---
We are not sure if it works, there is evidence that different ranks of jotc could stack, so maybe they are not doomed. It could change everything
---
not killing any1 lower level unless they attack first
---
You can have taunt if shamans get a baseline melee attack.
---
Hi, /u/facktality
---
zThe keyring was definately a huge spacesaver, but it was also a machanic that didn't make you care about key's anymore as you always had room for all the key's you needed. While before the keyring you often made choices like putting certains key's in the bank v.s. carrying them all the time. 
---
Go for it. Resto Druids are good, the only problem is that they are like 10% worse than priests overall but that's only a problem for super hardcore minmax guilds. They also tend to get a bad rep because the long cast time of healing touch means their heals will get sniped constantly if there is more healing available than the raid needs. Which is virtually always the case when a guild is farming content and even on many progression bosses there are more healers than are really necessary because the guild needs more for just a few of the bosses in the raid. Priests would have the same problem if they didn't waste mana to fluff the meters by spamming flash heal.
---
Honestly, given that UD seem to make up a larger than 50% part of the horde warlock population, if roughly half of the R13/R14 locks were UD, that speaks to Orc being stronger.
---
Or given that vanilla pvp is more about grind and less about raw power, it really speaks to the type of person rolling either race.
---
I'll tell you what I'd do. Two twinks at the same time.
---
Get Drakova in here. He'll probably talk about focusing on procs in a Holy Reckoning or Ret Reckoning spec.
---
Honestly any serious guild will pass on the Hand of Rag. I have never seen any hardcore guild use it consistently. It's just not very good and doesnt fit into any class - the best use for it is on Paladin and retribution isnt very competitive class. All the warriors want to be fury.
---
*sigh* \- this opinion is one of someone who played nothing but Horde in vanilla and has been playing Alliance on a private server as of a late.
---
Yes, the map is not a mirror image on both sides so they are not equal, there are a few more NPCs in the alliance base, but the bridge is simple a MENTAL BLOCK for Horde players and causes tactical errors over and over and over and over and over for all but premade groups that know how to not make this mistake.
---
The simple answer for horde is to GROUP UP at the Stormpike Graveyard...and I don't mean a group of 5, I mean the entire offense with the exception of stealthers capping towers...and zerg the Alliance Aid Station.
---
That's it. Seriously. That's it. But for YEARS, Horde PuGs couldn't figure this out and it was almost like a deer in headlights for them with the bridge where they would just stand there and get sniped by tower archers and AoE'd to death by mages and hunters.
---
ZERG. THE. AID. STATION. AND. DO. NOT. PULL. NPCs.
---
When horde has lower level players in the alliance base, they seem to just run around and aggro everything which causes wipes, and even the 60s did this. When you take the aid station, you have to stay towards the hill in the back of the flag (West in Dun Baldar).
---
This isn't a lot different than how Alliance has been winning. They cap Frostwolf Graveyard, and then zerg the aid station flag. 
---
I'm not sure why this was such a hard concept for Horde. I see Horde premades following what I just wrote to the letter and winning consistently w/o any stupid turtles.  If you queue as horde and you see everyone turtling, that's how you know you're with a bunch of noobs. Same with getting AoE'd to death on the bridge trickling in one by one instead of forming a huge group and going in together. 
---
It's been 14 years Hordies, EVOLVE! Not that hard.
---
I don't remember ever using a launcher. Pretty sure you can direct .exe.
---
i believe we had 2 over the whole expansion, i believe they both went to healers :P So they were never used in progress. But it was still a nice way to reward ppl for their loyalty to the guild. 
---
I don't recognize this, clearly it's private server shenanigans and not related to classic wow.
---
Nobody runs arms in raids outside of people that are too lazy or forgot to respec from their pvp spec (except rankers). Horde runs Fury 2H. 
---
Sulfuras is a status symbol and not a good weapon. It goes to an officer or whoever is willing to pay for all the mats. 
---
hey its me, ur paladin
---
I got a ring in ere last night 
---
Yeah I don't care about that, I just want all the druid loots that are going to drop because there's only one druid
---
Great stuff! I can't wait till we can relive this dream!
---
Hunters - best race for each faction? 
---
Thank you for the great write-up, I played Horde in vanilla and was considering a paladin for classic.  Quick question - if I want to avoid respec fees, is it possible to keep holy spec and swap to 2H to kill mobs to clean up some old quests or slowly farm, etc? or is it just ridiculous?  Not really gonna have time to farm for constant respec. Figure I'll have to do everything one spec even if not optimal for everything.
---
Reason I asked is I tried this on a resto shaman alt in vanilla and it was horribly slow, I lost a lot of HP, and ran out of mana really fast. 
---
I can bring my work setup with me and feel comfortable
---
I imagine they would follow this route if they choose to continue with post-vanilla content. Keep a vanilla option always available and potentially branch off into other things that the community wants to keep the game fresh for those who don't just want permanent vanilla. 
---
There are a lot of options that don't require crazy amounts of development resources. Adding a new raid or some new talents and items doesn't require anywhere near the effort of creating a new expansion from scratch. 
---
Kill anything and everything (that I am capable of killing) on sight.
---
So they bumped up the gamma? Alright, that's fine with me.
---
Me, that’s who. 
---
There is a lot to consider in regards to timeline, but I think having Classic bundled with the retail sub will keep Classic relatively populated as long as retail doesn't completely die. 
---
Guild Bank and Calendar are UI things that don't affect gameplay directly, but the PVP system kept r14 weapons scarce for all of its flaws. If you don't want it to become a 12 hour a day grind than you need to interact with your community to set the bar.
---
TBC was my favorite expansion, but it was far from perfect. Many of its changes took out a lot of what was already working in vanilla WoW.
---
TBC moved us away from the two best designed continents and killed the old capitals. Shattrath put everyone horde and alliance in the same capital. The sense of rivalry between horde and alliance erodes as paladins and shamans exist in both factions. It added flying so now everyone was zooming from node to node to farm rather than crossing paths. It started to water down the differences between classes giving everybody the similar version of what someone else had. Arena by its existence meant that now all classes needed more similar toolkits on a more microscale more than ever before. Outside of farming, nearly every relevant piece of content end game was inside of an instance. This meant you could fly quickly to your instance and never interact with a soul.
---
TBC made dozens of changes that turned the World of Warcraft to the Instances of Warcraft. I wish they would have built onto the old world more, added new content, never add flying, keep factions more unique, keep classes more unique, etc.
---
are there any MMOs or expansions launching in the summer from other companies? probably same week in typical hostile Blizzard fashion
---
Oh come on now...I didn't think it was quite that good.
---
Blizzard would see dropping from 20 servers down to 5 as a major problem, and that is precisely when we would start to see changes. 
---
I think the point is you could be all that and then respec to something else outside raids. (with high respec costs not something most people would do weekly, but you could when you had a reason to do it)  
---
I'm not really interested in modern WoW, so that's bad news for me :/
---
For levelling and solo PvE yes, otherwise not.
---
1980s IBM style keyboards, not 1960s
---
The current thought is July 16th based on a easter egg with the demo. There have been several threads about it in the last few days if you look.
---
no its not its neutral news. You pay the subscription just like back in the day.
---
I will be rolling Paladin for classic to raid heal. To level, should I be leveling ret? Or is reckoning more powerful? I never tried reckoning... I've heard with the classic patch, it won't be viable? 
---
Ofc. Total brainfart on my part. You are correct.
---
When classic wow is truly dead, open sourceit., Imo
---
I’m gonna have to disagree. If your faction works together it’s very easy to get rank 14. The hard part is getting everyone to understand how it works. Not hard to get 2 rank 14s a week.
---
i dont know about horde because of 2handed fury but for alliance paladin. but that also means paladin shouldnt get bonereaver or ashkandy over others 
---
For a holy pal, what would you consider best for profession's while leveling? I'll be going herbalism and possibly skinning, mining, or any other suggestions?
---
This is purely a fun/pvp weapon so whoever is willing to commit to actually investing in it. Only crazy or super dedicated people would want to sink the cash needed to build it so the list in the guild of who that would be will be short. 
---
The wsg jumps should stay. They are high risk, high reward choices that require a lot of skill to pay off. I agree with the av one though. That is just dumb.
---
but its a prized pvp item and not for pve (at least on ally) i think a ret paladin shouldnt automaticly get it just for using a sub optimal spec in pve 
---
Why do you want to rush it?
---
Right that makes a lot of sense, last year I took a week off for the launch of BfA and i was burnt out by the end of the week with little do to. Of Course classic wont be this way but I may like you said burn myself out on it. 
---
I meant, that is the best race to choose?
---
It could go either way.  If there is a huge burst at end game that shows a clear interest in further development with the philosophy of vanilla.  If not theyll just trim down the amount of servers and run indefinitely. 
---
agreed im all for no changes but after a few years im down for another expansion created in mind for vanilla mindset.. would be way more interesting then tbc 
---
I'm sure you can contribute. It is in c# after all.
---
I have started working on it now. You can find it at https://www.github.com/Snuffsis/ClassicLauncher
---
thanks a bunch, I dont know I felt like if I didnt rush that I would be left behind from the gearing progression, but I assume it will take everyone time to gear. Thanks a bunch
---
There is absolutely no way for me to buy a token then give you game time with it. You simply don’t understand how a token works. It cannot be traded. 
---
Either way, what you’re describing has nothing to do with the token existing. It would happen without it. 
---
If the token didn’t exist, what stops you from taking 500 gold from someone, then paying $15 to give them gametime?
---
Hence your thread being downvote. Hence your inability to rationally explain this. 
---
You’re jumping at shadows without even understanding how the system works. 
---
How was 2H dps for warriors? I honestly dont remember outside of pvp but been thinking of rolling a warrior for classic. 
---
Makes sense, much love friend! 
---
How is it a reasonable discussion when you can’t transfer a token between players. 
---
Good idea; do you know his Reddit /u/ ?
---
Im not sure, I had the thought that I would be left behind if I did not rush to hit 60... but I suppose the gearing process will be slow for everyone at the start? 
---
Thanks a bunch for the feedback! 
---
Well as i've stated in other comments now I apologize, I thought that there would be an insane rush to start gearing for any upcoming raids right when it comes out, realistically this is crazy of me to think and I guess I have nothing to worry about. 
---
That isn't even available to probably 90% of the rural US.  There are entire major metro areas that don't even have fiber available to the home yet.
---
That being said, while my old cable company who assured me multiple times they serviced my address with their 100/25 service, they actually end their line half a mile down the road from me, its fine because my power company is in the process of rolling out fiber to the home (I believe they're offering up to 1000/100 speeds) to their rural customers (Read: A majority of their customer base).  They've already rolled it out to their non rural customers, now its time to roll out for the other 4/5 of their customers.  The company I work for actually had a bid out for the install in my service area, but we lost it to another subcontractor.  Bummer, that would have been cool to install the lines to my own house.
---
&gt; graduation 
---
I think you meant gratification, and I can't agree more with this. Classic can't come fast enough
---
Perfection
---
My next issue is which class to play... i still havent thought about it. I want to be a hunter or a warrior right now... at first I wanted to be what I am in retail a druid tank but I heard bear tanks in classic aren't viable and the only tank is a warrior one.
---
Most likely, I wish my memory wasnt so shit so I could remember things like this, but I have no control over my memory I suppose :) 
---
Thanks for the kind words. 
---
Pretty crazy... thank you 
---
&gt; First off, I'm confused, what reason do YOU think they're adding loot trading for?
---
To reduce costs on game support, cuz some people accidentally clicked need when they didn't actually need, and contacted GM for that.
---
Wow, even flipping the image to make it match, beautiful 
---
How often do you think that actually happened? Seriously. Don't think I've ever personally seen it happen in many years. Lots of other people on this subreddit seem to be skeptical that it happens at any significant rate as well. 
---
Thanks for all of the info! I do want to get into raiding because I never did back in the day. But to be honest even if I grind to level 60 I wouldnt know where to start to get gear, where the best 5man dungeon gear is or anything like that :) 
---
Warrior. I had it and smashed dmg meters (and faces in pvp).
---
I had a zx spectrum, and an amiga 500 in the 80s. They were both rubber domed keyboards. All of the keyboards that came with my PCs from the 90s onward were rubber domed. I'm not sure what your point is.
---
&gt; I had the thought that I would be left behind if I did not rush to hit 60...
---
Lol, no. I can assure you, most of players won't rush anywhere. There is simply no reason to for most of us, because now we don't have to clear content until next expansion etc.
---
Playing vanilla in russia
---
NE and Troll for PVE
---
Orc and NE/dwarf for pvp 
---
I don't know, i also have only once encountered such situation in my lifetime, and it was in a raid. It also seemed as a really strange thing that someone would contact GM over a dungeon loot drop. 
---
But i asked here on reddit a few times, and some people responded that actually used to happen to them.
---
Also i read some comments from Nost dev team on that topic, they mentioned that around 25% of all GM tickets were about trading loot.
---
That all seemed really strange to me, but turns out some people really do these kind of things.
---
Xiao = Dead
---
I know this may not be popular line of thought on this subreddit, but I think there should be progression into TBC and then into WotLK, with possible reset of Classic coming afterwards (but still with option to keep the characters on dedicated servers locked into each expansion).
---
Well, maybe you are right. But imo that may cause you to burn out real quick and drop the game for some time.
---
This meant that SoR effectively *doubled* your chance to proc all the things that SotC was meant to proc only 40% more. This “bug” caused SoR to replace SotC's pretty much across the board.
---
&gt;When was it fixed? 2.1.0:
---
I dont think you understand what the word bug means. This is not a bug. That is exactly how the skill functioned from 1.9 and until TBC. By design or not, who knows. But it's definately not a bug. Blizzard cant just go in and change random abilities because they seem too strong or too weak.
---
If there is a "pack" like there is on private servers, then it could definitely be worth it even though you won't cap. If you are stuck in the pack, you might find the experience frustrating due to fighting over mobs and quest items. It can be bad enough that it is nothing like the original Vanilla experience.
---
That said, unlike monolithic private servers, classic will spread the community out a bit, so the pack could be well sized. If this is the case, I would recommend taking your time with leveling. Do each dungeon, you'll find groups quickly with more people at your level.
---
That would be fun.
---
Honestly they could make a bunch of themes for different games. 
---
&gt;SoR was fixed to not proc more often than SotC because it was clearly not intended to—but this wasn't caught until 2.1.0. Is that a big enough reason not to fix it?
---
Going by this logic we need to give Shamans bloodlust. It was clearly a bug that they did not have it, since it got introduced in TBC.
---
Because you know, changing a class in the next expansions PROVES that they intended for it to behave like that all along right?
---
Ofcourse it doesnt. Changing SoR in TBC only proves they wanted to redesign the class in that expansion. They did the same with multiple classes.
---
I love how you get downvoted when the other guy is 100% legit wrong. This community man. It's hillarious.
---
mage is far better for a casual player.
---
Nothing to apologize for, you are asking for a reason! :)
---
If you’re facing someone like that isn’t it smarter to use fire spells or just run away lol
---
Those videos are hilarious
---
Septober 35st
---
Nah
---
Is there a way to hear this on mobile?
---
Locksmiths unite! 
---
It's not an open beta if it's limited to 5% of active subscribers. That's a very exclusive closed beta. 
---
Because there is a difference between exchanging in-game currency and real money. What am I not explaining rationally?
---
No I didn't know you could gift game time, that doesn't invalidate my argument.
---
I'm prepping for Classic and checking out guides for each instance, bookmarking them for reference later on when the game actually launches. Yours is one of the most complete and easy to follow guides on Youtube for this specific instance. Thanks for taking the time to make it. PS:  I got no idea why people are down-voting this Reddit post (but I have a feeling it might have to do with Alkemical having tainted this thread with his presence lol). Please don't get discouraged man, and make videos for all classic instances. Keep up the great work!
---
Havent seen anything about this. Could you link something that says/claims this?
---
March-April
---
Ditto
---
I am glad you’re finding the guides helpful, and thank you for your kind words. Not sure why it is getting down voted either, but so far the response is good on YouTube. Shadowfang Keep and Blackfathom Deeps for the Horde will be coming soon and shortly after should be my Fishing &amp; Cooking Guide for the Horde as well.
---
&gt; with some time pass I think it will not be enough.
---
Let's talk about it when you clear Naxx, shall we?
---
&gt; with how much players brains have advanced from 2005 to now
---
They didn't. 
---
Addons and guides did incredibly advance over the years, but players did not.
---
You're right, even though it's a fake video game world this topic does get philosophical.
---
Getting ganked can be very inconvenient and frustrating, so I avoid doing it to others. When someone spring-releases immediately after dying you can actually sense their frustration. They're at their wit's end with getting ganked, and I don't want them to feel that way. Maybe they're ragers in general, but I'm not going to strive to be the condition that makes that rage happen.
---
One reaction I have to being ganked is wanting to kill any member of the opposite faction just to feel better. However that person is probably just some random dude minding their own business, and afterwards they may react in the same way. The result would just be a bunch of petty emotional children in a constant war. This just doesn't seem right if we're trying to chill out and play a game.
---
If I get ganked it's my fault for questing solo, not being prepared with the right gear/talents, and knowingly going into certain volatile areas. So I take responsibility. Sometimes in life you have to just take it in the ass.
---
In the end pacifists will always be killed more than kill but as the human being behind the keyboard I can't rationalize being emotionally weak and pretty 24/7.
---
TL;DR of the post
---
"Insight from wow veteran (I played vanilla so it matters):
---
i tried vanilla on pservers and turns out i don't like it so i think we need BfA capped at lvl 60!
---
I already can make the game easier with addons but i think it is not enough so why not install QoL stuff forcefully for everyone!"
---
Seriously, i am triggered by statements like this "QoL addons are widely used". Yeah, SO WHAT? This IS the reason to NOT add them to the game. You already can do whatever you want to your UI, what's your problem, why do you want to ruin classic for others who want it authentic?!
---
&gt;  Though I don’t see too much discussion on the prospect of buffing notoriously weak specs.
---
I on the contrary think i see too much of that lol. People constantly speaking about "balance classes pls!" and such.
---
On topic: nothing will happen, they stated that on blizzcon.
---
It's the same sound as hitting the enter world button on any given character screen. 
---
Just because you can clear most of the content with 20 people and memespecs dont mean you should.
---
That being said, it would depend on how hardcore your guild is. For a guild where all 40 raiders dont really care, and just want to go do MC/BWL and have some fun, you can play whatever spec you want.
---
The issue starts when you move up the chain and the guild becomes better. Suddenly your members are expected to get consumables, world buffs, and to maximize their DPS and gear to push as high DPS as possible for faster clear times. 
---
Now imageine you play a rogue. You know exactly how to gear, and you put in hours getting all the consumables and buffs you need for the raid. Then you show up to the raid with 35 other people doing the same, and realize the remaining 5 players are moonkins and elemental shamans who do 40% less damage than you do no matter how much pots they bring.
---
Why should you keep getting consumables and put in all this effort for the next raid?  You just spent hours and hours getting ready for the raid to shave off a little bit on your clear times, and all your effort just got nullified by the raid bringing a subpar spec. Instead of spending 200g on potions, the raid could just replace the memespecs with more rogues, warriors and mages and you would clear in the same time regardless. This is where the problem lies.
---
I'd say no. High chance you aren't experienced enough if you are asking this question here. Plus you still need to devote 15-20 hours per day. 
---
And also raidwide aoe heals, raidwide defensive cooldowns etc. Compare that to Vanilla raids where your healers almost exclusively had single target heals while having to deal with sometimes heavy raid damage.
---
The two versions of the game are simply both difficult for very different reasons.
---
So everybody around here says paladin was really bad in 1.12 ret and prot wise but you say evebody knows is a strong class? Me don't get it...
---
I am amused you think blizzard cares enough to read this board.
---
Agreed I say Mid July-Late August

**\*\*&lt;Knights Templar&gt; - Alliance |NA – PvE| Semi-Hardcore\*\***
---
**\*\*Introduction**:\*\*  
---
Knights Templar roots were established during World of Warcraft’s launch on the Zul’jin |US - PvE| server.  Our guilds mantra was “The causal guild that raids hardcore” and to a degree we will continue with that mantra during Classic WoW.  We accomplish this by having a very casual guild environment, but a very focused and dedicated raid environment.  Our goal is to progress through all raid tiers at a very strong pace.  
---
**\*\*What we Expect of Members**:\*\*  
---
We are looking for members who share the same mantra that was referenced above.  All members are expected to be respectful and polite when dealing with other members of the community.  It’s important to remember that when you join our guild, you represent us at all times.  For raid members, you will be expected to show up to raids on time and prepared to pull by raid start time. 
---
**\*\*Raid Times:\*\***

NO CHANGES
---
Even retail still has the sound, it plays when you log a character in.
---
I'm going to convince my guild to farm thunderfury for my rogue with financial incentives, once I've obtained my grail I'll spend the rest of my money on excess consumables for PvP. I also plan making some twinks that will eat up a lot of my spare money.  
---
If I had time I'd probably also level a warrior with blacksmithing and engineering and feed it with my main. Though I admit this might be a biting off more than I can chew. 
---
What about [this guy](https://imgur.com/a/CQRJDg1)?
---
I live in Denmark where these connections are commonplace in our larger cities.
---
But yes, I wouldn't move to a place that didn't have support for these speeds. Part of me think that we as a race (us humans) should move into cities, all of us, and give nature some land area back, for the better of the environment.
---
Well if that's the case, then how is it unhealthy if it can be done in a week?
---
I didn't say any of that shit. And you are getting so worked up about this. Damn get some therapy or something.
---
Pretty sure crafting materials don't bind to character. Didn't last time I played back in WotLK. Has this changed in retail, and why are we discussing this? We're talking about Vanilla :)
---
"W-whats wrong with you". Learn to argue you fucking loser
---
Usually paladin or shamans. Warriors are better off going sword spec. 
---
I love Night Elf, having stealth as a hunter is straight too good to pass up.
---
If you don't want to pay with real money you can pay your sub with gold, but you have to grind retail for it (not that's it's hard to do).
---
Ret will be more consistent. Mobs won't be critting you enough to make reckoning worth it.
---
makes sense, thanks a bunch for the clear up! 
---
Its possible to hit lvl 60 in a week if you know what you're doing and are playing around 20 hours per day.
---
Thank you. My more recent videos I feel are of much better quality and it’s making me want to update the older ones now. I use Filmora as my editor. It really makes things easy.
---
its literally impossible you wouldnt land a hit.
---
Won’t see any kinda fun like that in BFA. 
---
dropped your pants?
---
It depends on the class and if you're flasking or not.
---
A warrior who flasks would spend around 200g per raid if there's no wipes. Also depends on the flask prices ofc.
---
The game industry (as a whole, not every company obviously) is very lost right now. The pursuit of maximum revenue has lead to mediocre titles, undeserving of a true triple-A award. At the same time, the market is absolutely cluttered with smaller, equally empty and shitty games (insert ermergerd guys look at this 2D mario-like game I just made with my boyfriend!).
---
It's almost like if you're in the mood for gaming, you gotta go into this junkyard of trash and scour it all to find a decent, good game.
---
At the same time, the "old gems" still glitter with gold and are easy to spot amongst the trash. Thinks like D2, Vanilla, Half Life, HOMM3, Fallout and many others; they are still just as good as they were brand new. So people are again starting to focus on those games and wanting either remakes of them or just new games brought closer to the core of those.
---
Blizzard is too far up it's own ass to create anything new to this gold standard, but they can at least give us what we really want, such as Classic.
---
At least that's how I see it.
---
Hostile economic practices like this are why I love'd the wow economy.    There are no rules and it was a perfect market that had no 3rd party limiting profits. Price Fixing + Gouging is cool, unless it's well maintained and lasts quite some time and you're not in the racket. 
---
You were not able to on the demo and you never were during vanilla. It seems to be a private server bug.
---
Anything can become unhealthy if overdone. If the competition is to get the most honor in a week then just limit the amount of honor people get. This was done and governed by the community in vanilla so people weren’t having to play 24/7. Still requires a good amount of time but it will prevent unhealthy amounts of time to be required. It also requires everyone to be on board.
---
Both are good, but also consider a warlock. They're very comparable to mages (great levelers, great damage, bunch of utility) but they tend to be underrepresented on servers. Whereas mages are great, but they're also very common
---
I don't bugger people unless they bugger me. 
---
I wish. I did the math.
---
With a raid consisting of 1 tank, 3 healers, 1 Warlock and 30 Spriests.
---
If the Spriests were to stack, and stack, and stack Shadow Weaving, and the healers could keep the tank alive for 47 seconds.
---
Onyxia is dead in 1 shadow bolt.
---
Every raid leader knows this. Pallies are #1 tank healers (usually with an Inspiration Priest) but we're just one big dumb HoT on the tanks.
---
The thing is why Paladin (Ret) is that many people forget your a very major hybrid.
---
Your DPS is weaker, so you shouldn't just be dpsing - In a fight requiring cleansing, you should be cleansing thusly saving the healers having to cleanse.
---
You should be upkeeping things like judgement of wisdom etc.
---
You should be using your utility to support your raid, not just expecting to do the same role as a warrior and not using more than like 3 abilities.
---
Many of us will.
---
I don't think WoW Classic will be as enchanting as it used to be, for plenty of folk. If it stays in its state it will be a nice reason for people to stay subscribed a little longer - get bored on retail, switch to Classic for a few weeks back on your character that never loses power, try to rank up in PVP or obtain an elusive item from a set. It is surely my reason for wanting to play it, one character which remains unchanged through time, which I can log on occasionally and feel like top dog. 
---
Cause some of us don't like leveling and enjoy the level 60 content.
---
&gt; It seems like one of the easier healers to gear in my opinion.
---
/target Tank
---
/cast Flash of Light
---
there's more if you want to be good, but if you can just manage that, you're a reliable contributor to the raid.
---
Paladins are a Tank HoT that takes up a raid space.
---
Wow I had to check if I had accidentally logged into an alt and made this post. I has having this exact same dilemma. Orc has that sweet stun resist I want but undead is my most played / favorite.
---
Modern «Blizzard» humour is so bad. Every Quest has an obnoxious reference to something related to pop-culture. Every now and then is fine, but man is it crammed into BfA.
---
I never specced into ret for farming. I had a consecration spec and i managed to get it to work with my main build. Consecration is amazing for farming green mobs.
---
Yeah, this. What's to say you, OP, didn't get an invite but my friend who is no longer playing did? (that happened for BfA beta btw).
---
Oh well, better luck next time. To stress test would be to invite everyone 
---
40 warlocks summoning doomguards means getting 8 doomguards and staying with 32 warlocks. They are not that badass to be worth it.
---
Doomguard/Infernal exist to be unleashed on Goldshire imo.
---
&gt; Part of me think that we as a race (us humans) should move into cities, all of us
---
Given my general aversion to people in general, but specifically large masses of people, the notion of being forced to live in a city is utterly disgusting to me.
---
I can go outside on a clear night and see every constellation in my area of the sky, its absolutely incredible.  I have bears and coyotes and all sorts of interesting wildlife that live on my property, and space for my dogs to roam freely.  You couldn't pay me enough to move into a city.  Cost of living is cheap here, and its infinitely more pleasing to me to live in the woods, relatively isolated than to be anywhere near a city that is going to have at least 1.5-2 times the cost of living, if not more.
---
Honestly the crappy internet doesn't bother me nearly as much as I thought it would.  I actually ended up going about 6 months with no internet before I found the phone company that offered DSL to my house.  Played a lot of Skyrim in those 6 months...
---
he's a trash mod lol
---
I'm fine with #nochanges for a couple years.  But honestly, expansions *were* what made us love WoW for so many years.  Classic was an epic experience because of the MMO aspects, but people wanted more content.  
---
Part of me would like to see the OSRS approach, where players get to vote directly on what changes they want or don't want.  This might be in the form of an infinite-classic (ie: no expacs) but would result in what would essentially be a brand new game, with brand new content.  A parallel universe classic if you will.
---
Personally, I'd like to see expansions up to Wrath.  I think a lot of people gravitate to Wrath being the cutoff, because the lineage of WoW to Wrath was similar in nature to that of WC3(2?) to WC3:TFT.  Speaking in terms of lore, WoW could have ended right there at the frozen throne itself, and we as players probably would have been satisfied emotionally.  After Wrath, WoW officially became it's own thing, instead of a first-person version of an existing lineage.  But then, if you let players lock themselves into their favorite X-pac, you split the playerbase, which could be problematic.  HOWEVER, a solution to this could be to make it very easy to lock and unlock individual characters into exacs on one account.  At least then you can easily play with friends on all 3 servers by switching to alts.  I think this is my ideal outcome but I'm also down for the OSRS approach.
---
I do not personally want to see "museum" wow *exclusively* for more than 2-3 years.  It will die.  People get bored.  There has to be *something* new or different or at least a reset or something to maintain a sub base.
---
Excellently put, but what do you think about the post?
---
Do you happen to have a link for it?
---
You’re discussing an exchange between two people that could occur without the token. You could give me 500 gold in exchange for game time, or for an in game currency for an entirely different game.
---
You’re discussing an exchange that is not supported by Blizzard. 
---
You’ve failed to make a case here as to how this is a problem. You’re jumping at shadows.  
---
It is far better. This comes into play when you are competing against someone of equal skill.
---
Ill quote myself from a post further down that I encourage you to read... Comparing some of the considerations between Hardiness and WoTF
---
" WoTF will counter Warrior fear on a long  CD, Priest AoE fear and Warlock fear. But you will face less warlocks  and priests in pvp than any other class on alliance side in high level  pvp. It should also be mentioned that you do counter deep survival  hunters using Wyvern Sting, but these are so rare they arent worth being  mentioned...
---
Some of things hardiness  counters include, cheap shot (rogue), kidney, charge (warrior),  concussion blow (prot warrior), mace specialization (arms warrior), mace  specialization (combat rogue), intercept, intimidation (hunter),  concuss stun (hunter), hammer of justice (paladin), Impact (fire mage),  blackout (shadow priest), bear stun (druid), pounce, warstomp (tauren -  duels), grenade, tidal charm (typically mandatory, even in pug  premades), unstoppable force (will be used by almost ALL warriors and  rets for a long time in pvp), improved starfire (boomkin)... Many, many  others as well, these are just off the top of my head..."
---
Basically Hardiness allows you to have an advantage against classes designed to counter you... You HAVE an answer to fears through your trinket, spellstone and your felhunter... You can also make a blacksmithing trinket if youre so inclined...
---
As a warlock, you have NO answer to a stun, there are more of them and as a collective they are on shorter CD's than the fears AND they will be used against you MORE often.
---
That's was never in Vanilla, though.
---
depends on my mood
---
Its great that you are curious. I was only concerned because the crux of your choice seemed to be the aesthetics/flow of the starting zone... At least that's what your post seemed to indicate. 
---
Yea that seems plausible.
---
&gt; Racials at the end of the day are still quite negligible. 
---
For you. For those of us who would wince in pain to lose a world pvp fight to someone by 1-2% of our hp due to some racial choice? That kills us... Everyone has their own motivations. My opinion is purley from a competitive pve/pvp min/max perspective with no other considerations.
---
&gt; Iirc, at the beginning of vanilla hardiness was +25% of your base stun  resist (5%) mening it was only giving an extra 1.25%, but they changed  it at some point.  
---
I wouldnt know... Perhaps? I only EVER remember it as a pure 25%, which is certainly how it was at the midpoint/late end of vanilla when I was pushing for rank. Though there were a ton of shifts in racials, especially during the initial portion of vanilla.
---
I tested this a month ago and applied the MOST favorable conditions: (high proc rate, spell damage scaling, buffed, BiS gear, etc..) the most possible is ~836 dps, which is low considering end-game gear is required and tryhard min/maxing. Even if you add 200 dps just to make it pretty, the amount of effort invested should yield better results.
---
HOWEVER, there is a build where Ret gets into an interesting dps average if Crusdader's holy debuff can hypothetically be stacked.
---
Cool, that's what I was hoping. 
---
just soulstone/jumper back the saccs
---
I actually never thought of the mindset of twinking like. Being powerful without having to be competitive. Thanks.
---
&gt; Or given that vanilla pvp is more about grind and less about raw power 
---
I would agree with this sentiment. Any class can reach rank 14 as ANY spec as ANY race. I wasnt intending to cause anguish by highlight the advantages of Orc in PVP. If your motivations are aesthetic, CHOOSE what you want to look at for 100s of hours... If your motivation is winning, choose Orc master race for warlock pvp. The racial itself WONT win you every fight, but it IS an advantage that COULD win you a fight. Advantages add up... Orc... Engineer... Gear... First Aid... Consumes... Various trinkets and use items... Macros... Addons... It all adds up.
---
"intended to be an easy class to play" is their design philosophy around nearly every class in retail wow :^)
---
1-2% is still negligible. The racials are overall neglible, but some can skew some fights very favorably. *Overall* though, this is not the case. Your racial may help you in one instance and do nothing in another 5. The only real racial that has more than a negligent draw, is priests, in which case dwarf and troll stride pretty far ahead and undead are close behind
---
Edit: when I say neglible I mean it like getting plus 10 stam from food is negligible. It may determine a win or loss in a a fight, but how much it upsets you still doesn't change the fact it is a very minor aspect of the fight that is overshadowed vastly by even one second of misplay
---
Succubus has things for PvP too.
---
Yup you've told me I'm jumping at shadows three times now, I get it. I'm saying WoW Tokens could have influence over classic WoW which is true. Ofcourse you can trade 500g for anything, but WoW Tokens on retail can actively affect classic itself if they share the same subscriptions.
---
These don't look the same?? 
---
there is an old dev interview post-wotlk, where they stated that pets seeing stealth was fixed once they updated something in the background involving pet behavior and server software.  And that is was never suppose to work that way. This was brought to their attention and fixed as a whole very fast once it got out that a frost ele could see rogues during an entire arena match and it was only a matter of being relatively close to the mage.
---
We’re way past no changes, lol. 
---
Agreed.
---
Hand of Rag is more than just a DPS piece.
---
An item like that isn’t about who can do a tiny bit more dps than someone else. It’sabout who earned it.
---
Hands down it should go to the most dedicated viable guild member (pun intended)
---
whats with that building?
---
Hi, /u/Mattzballs
---
I heard back in TBC that if a warlock summons an infernal or doom guard in goldshire, they lose rep when it kills npcs
---
&gt;We weren't taking about use of drops
---
Drops happen to be a major bottleneck to any guilds progress. You have to include this in the equation.
---
This but rather than gold I'd do crafted BoE green sets. 
---
To be fair, how about we both get baseline melee attack?
---
Then, we'll talk about Taunts and the ability to make a mana pool last more than 30 seconds.
---
I Mained a warlock in nost and every time I’d do a school run. The group would tell me to open the door by killing my self though life taps/hellfire.
---
You sound like you got some solid Lock experience. Can you describe what drain tanking is and your rotation? I find most of the stuff on google to be confusing
---
I knew a pally on warsong that had thunder fury and t2.5 he used to go and Pvp with reckoning and had shadow oil on his thunderfury. This guy would literally one shot you. Every single time.
---
I don't really pay attention to the rest of that stuff oh, it's just part of the game. I wanted to look good, and I want it to sound good and I want the mechanics to be fair. Besides that I'm for the most part A Lord of the Rings Online person, I just keep a lazy ear to this thread because my significant other is waiting for classic wow to come back. Thanks for having a civil discussion with me, for The Horde.
---
If half of what we knew about vanilla was translated into an actual skill, we'd all be millionaires now.
---
I can see Classic getting the Diablo seasonal treatment once population starts to decline/everything is done. Roll all servers into fewer permanent servers -&gt; start a new classic Season (lasting a year?) letting people all dive back in for another go, perhaps with a few tweaks to test the waters/spice things up.
---
Any raid hitting Nax is going to require its members to use consumables. 
---
So certainly some are required.
---
yeah you will find dungeon groups easy AF but the few MT/OT slots fill up fast then its hard to break into a guild as a warrior tank unless people quit.
---
So what is spell batching?
---
If this is true...  do you have any idea what the implications of this could be? If you were super dedicated, and super insane, you could become hated with your own faction. 
---
1. Make warlock
---
2. Grind to 60, only doing class quests (less rep w/ factions).
---
3. Get epic mount and all spells.
---
4. Set hearth to a neutral town.
---
5. Park a few bank alts in major cities to handle your finances and auctions.
---
6. Summon doom guards over and over again in friendly towns, slowly grinding down to hated.
---
7. ???
---
Yeah but with limited time it sucks to get caught up in an endless gank cycle.  
---
That's a parking garage. I know that building! I used to work in a building close to that when I worked in Chicago 
---
Perfect for me on EC as well
---
Hey man.. gotta love a free death with no repair bill right?
---
While leveling double gather professions such as herb/skinning or mining/skinning would be best. Then drop them and level real professions.
---
I've played wow a bit during vanilla but mostly in BC/WotLK, however only some low level raiding. Nothing very organized. I'd like to start classic when it comes out and I'm doubting to start a druid or a warlock. Back in the day I mostly played warrior and a bit deathknight. 
---
Is it smart starting a druid? Since tanking will probably end up being a task for warriors. Will they end up healing or or dps also possible?
---
Or would warlock be recommended for dps'ing mostly? How does it hold up in raids/dungeons and battlegrounds?
---
DW generally produces higher damage on single targets in a raid environment. 2h cleaving seems to produce on trash packs etc and in 5 mans. Assuming you're talking fury. Arms isn't going to do so well in PVE.
---
[This comment is just...] (https://i.imgur.com/hKSUceD.jpg)  
---
How do you play FF7? On a modern PC? 
---
Or maybe because there's clearly some mental issues at play.
---
lol boa gear, get out.
---
You do get, that the only way you're going to get your perfect immaculate vanilla wow is to acquire old server side software and run your own server. If not you just like the rest of us, will have to live with whatever blizzard chooses. And yes going through an old Model T, redoing the paint with modern sealed paints and replacing that shity inefficient engine with four Hub Motors, would be on my top priority. If you don't get this, you have never ridden in one or had to work on one. And that same analogy, works for the poor programmers at blizzard, who are desperately trying to create a vanilla product that everybody will be happy with, but will still not Run Drive and require that he repairs that the aforementioned Model T requires. Nothing personal just saying.
---
So you plan to hoard Arcanite? 
---
Because any weapon that has a "Chance to deal X amount of damage" on hit scales really well with Reckoning which is basically doing 4 attacks at the same time. Especially when the proc scales with Spellpower on a class that can affort to use heavy spellpower gear.
---
HRGH
---
&gt; If greed-only doesn't reduce tickets then it really confuses me why that is the system they use in WoW today
---
Because they have added a bunch of other safeties to that system. You no longer have an open roll on all equipment. You don't necessity of needing other gear armor types. Also needing on a BoE back then didn't bind it to you. There is also the reason on why they ditched the party loot system altogether in the newer expansions. 
---
&gt; The reality is that people just very rarely have a reason to trade items that they rolled Need on, and that allowing trade of Needed items just presents more opportunities for abuse.
---
True or not. Blizzard wants it to get rid of loot tickets. To quote Ion on the topic... "sorry if you were planning on using the ninja looting excuse of like I totally didn't mean to click it, I guess, I guess I just have to equip it now". Yes I agree with you that loot sharing is going to open up a lot more problems than it will solve but Blizzard just wants it to stop loot tickets. I personally want no loot trading (the only maybe would be master looter mistakes) and blizzard to auto-reply with too bad too sad on all loot tickets. But my posts are from the viewpoint of Blizzard wants and what Blizzard has talk about when talking about loot sharing. For Blizzard to get what they want from the system it either has to be a full open sharing window or no sharing as any half-baked version isn't going to net Blizzard what they want. 
---
Oh, that's interesting! Did you find any other interesting mechanics while you were investigating in this set-up? Did you write down what gearset you eventually had most success with?
---
2 things. Anyone that played/remember vanilla will know instantly that the logos are changed..
---
Second, the lighting and everything in the character screen dont represent the real lighting engine, because they told us in the classic pannel that they dont have the original background for the character selection screen and had to make a side by side comparison trying to replicate it. So yeah... GG OP
---
They effect Classic the same way literally every other currency on the planet does.
---
You’ve failed to make a point. 
---
*laughs in Paladin*
---
Anthem launches Feb 22. Could be a good day to release Alpha/Beta. 
---
I would have thought so, I know it and felhunter were considered the PvP pets back in the day, but everyone here seems certain it's blueberry all day.
---
Fair enough. Though I still think it's going to be expensive for what it is.
---
Thats what I ended up doing. I felt like my wailing caverns video was so poorly made, I remade it. 
---
Have played on RP servers (both EU + NA) since 2004 and RPed across a ton of different platforms.
---
I really don't think the RP scene on Classic WoW will be very big at all. Historically speaking, this sort of great migration from one game to another doesn't ever work out. The RP community is firmly set and very well established already, and it's always been difficult to get people to change - whether from one server to another, one game to another, or simply from one city to another. It never works out.
---
One thing you have to understand is that most RPers don't care which game is better, since many of them don't actually play the game. They're not there to do the content, they're there to RP, and so, for RPers, Classic WoW is a straight-up downgrade.
---
It doesn't matter that the leveling in Classic WoW is more immersive, or that the story is more grounded, or that the game as a whole is more social and rewarding. These things are irrelevant when all you do for 8 hours a day is walk around Stormwind pretending to be a vampire. The only thing that matters when you're that type of player is functionality, and Classic WoW is a downgrade in terms of functionality.
---
For example, you can't target your campfires. You can't use Orb of the Sin'dorei to pretend you're a high elf. You can't speak and understand all languages as a Mage. You can't pretend to be a bard by serenading strangers with the Twelve-String Guitar toy. You can't enlarge your e-peen with Winterspring Firewater (in Vanilla it's an expensive raid consumable).
---
More importantly, you can't create events on the calendar and invite your entire server. You can't add members of the opposite faction to a custom Battle.net conversation so you can understand their emotes (you can't even create Horde and Alliance characters on the same RP-PVP server). You can't use raid markers to indicate the position of imaginary enemies during events (if this was D&amp;D, we would just use minis, but this is WoW so we have to improvise lol).
---
Additionally, there are fewer items to choose from when constructing your RP outfit or when looking for general RP props, and most, if not all, are much harder to obtain. Consider lanterns, torches, bottles (broken and unbroken), wine glasses, food, flowers, bouquets, baskets, tools, vials, mugs, books, bones, hats, goggles, glasses, masks, blindfolds, shirts, bandages, and faction tabards, and whether or not they're available in Classic WoW. Simply put, your wardrobe is smaller. Much, much smaller.
---
There are also considerably fewer non-combat pets to choose from, and you can't personalise their names. That means no familiars, no floating lanterns, no dogs, ravens, demons or elementals. Nothing magical, nothing undead, nothing impressively mechanical. I met a RPer years ago whose character was blind (indicated by a RP addon that allows you to create custom buffs and debuffs, which is another thing absent in Classic WoW), but she was able to see vicariously through the eyes of her familiar, which was a raven. Pretty cool concept. Do you think she would want to transition over to Classic WoW though? I don't think so. Not unless she wanted a chicken or a cockroach as a familiar.
---
Anyway, the point is, Blizzard has made many changes over the years that benefit RPers. They have added features like Battle.net, cross-faction communication, and the Communities system that help us greatly. Just last year they disabled sharding on all RP realms - both EU and NA - to facilitate community-driven server-wide RP events. Finally - after many, many years of being this small, insignificant, overlooked portion of the WoW community - RP is acknowledged as a legitimate style of gameplay beside PvE and PvP, and Blizzard bears RPers in mind when they make changes to the game. It has taken a long time for us to become this mainstream. A return to classic is, at least for RPers, a definite regression to a style of game that was not made RPers in mind.
---
That said, sure, people will RP in Classic WoW. I know I will. But I'm not playing Classic WoW specifically to RP. I'm playing Classic WoW for the content, because it's a good game. I'm playing because it's fun and rewarding. RP is just something secondary I'll do in my spare time because I happen to be a RPer. It's not going to be some RPers paradise as people seem to think.
---
I hope this answers your question. I predict a healthy RP community on at least one server (one per region, that is), but I think most of the RP community will remain where it is. As I said earlier, a complete migration from one game to another has yet to be successful.
---
Releasing stable and proper wow classic blizzard servers is clearly a 1 1/2 - 2 year job. I don't see how releasing multiple servers with different expansions would be easy.
---
The richest/most tryhard/most nolife player in the guild who can equip it. The cost to affording it is the biggest hurdle, and even then it isn't that amazing compared to AQ40 loot.
---
god i hope so...
---
One thing I REALLY hated about the Cata revamp.
---
Quest giver needs 6 cloth
---
Thank you for enlightening us, you are right :)
---
Most druids are expected to heal most of the time. Even if you are feral DPS you will probably be called on to heal at points.   
---
If the goal is just to DPS all the time then Druid is probably not the class you want. 
---
I was never able to play TBC or Classic so I would be down for definitely both cause they both seem fun.
---
Wrote on my phone dumb autocorrect lol
---
Warriors take some gearing before they're any good at raiding, not sure about mages.
---
Now, my understanding is that this mechanic is not in the current system build correct? The build that they will be using for classic? So in all likelihood will be irrelevant? Or did I miss something?
---
Hi, /u/caseofwhoopazz
---
Is it a 3d model or a sketch? Cuz I would 3D print this if there is a model :D
---
Oh sweet Summer child. You think private server paladins will resemble retail paladins. They aren't bopping you. They aren't cleansing you, they aren't freedoming the warriors outside the Holy paladins in a premade. They are going to sit on forums and try to get their class buffed 24/7 and cry about all the other classes including mage.
---
After vanilla they better start adding burning crusade and then wrath.
---
Not bm'ing but it's just funny you say NE/dwarf for alliance pvp hunter... Like... They ain't gonna be gnome or human hunter lol
---
Why are these buff and change ret paladin posts allowed to continue when the Classic leads said no class changes are happening? This brings nothing to the classic discussion. Moderation removes post calling out all the stupid ret paladin posts, yet they keep allowing these posts. Sticky it and remove them. Let them play BFA just like the Classic leads said.

*cries in Warrior*
---
except dwarf warriors thats why they are the best lol
---
Model? No, it's just a drawing - though I'll take that as a compliment :⌃)
---
Rag himself drops a better weapon than sulfuras for warriors and that is bone reavers edge. 
---
It's a joke, resto shamans hit more than elemental ones. 
---
Quite a few people use zbrush for example for such things then render the 2D perspective they want so was worth asking :)
---
Well then several people in Vanilla lied to me. Dirty innervate whores.

This is why you play Horde. To kill them over and over and over. They are the same people that ruined modern WoW and made all classes the same and then they refuse to play it. Anyone that is sane doesn't even play in Alliance pugs because ret paladins singlehandedly ruin the faction.
---
Maybe a sculpt would've helped, as I'd never rendered anything like this before digitally. It was kind of challenging experiment, and the brushstrokes are still messier and more undefined than I'd like them to be.
---
While I believe Seal of the Crusader could be a good option, we need more testing away from private servers and in the launch of the game.
---
I believe an Ret Paladin's in Raids if you are solo, almost certainly a proc set up is best as your job will be upkeeping Judgement of Wisdom - this should be enhanced by increasing your number of hits via Seal of the Crusader.
---
If your a two team ret then you have more options of revolving the Judgement  of Wisdom duty. In exchange you can use Seal/Judge command or righteousness for additional damage and revolve it between the two of you to allow for waves of blasting the boss.
---
By placing the ret's in a group with the Main Tank (Warrior) and a Feral Druid (Tank/Dps Spec, leader of the pack +crit great for Tank and Paladins) you can also have one ret go Retri/Prot Spec for Blessing of Sanctuary (enhanced by one paladin giving Sanc Aura and the other providing a resistance or devotion aura)
---
So yes, I believe your proc spec works best for a Solo Ret in a raid and might work for a two team. Though it needs testing and expect to use your full package and be a support not a pure dps.
---
Why would loot trading exist on greed rolls? Lol the point of greed is that no one needs it and everyone is rolling to just sell it or DE it.    I’m pretty against the loot trading for need rolls but I also don’t think it will be as bad as people are stating.  But then again no one knows yet and it depends on the community more than the system.  If loot trading is taken as seriously as ninja looting was then people will not want to play with those players.   If people just let every roll need and trade their friends without making a big deal about it. Then it will be a problem 
---
You didn't read the guys thread - its a theory crafting post and in no place does he request changes or buffs to Ret paladins but rather asks if people know or if they think a ret paladin focusing on proc attacks would be still in the viable spectrum.
---
I've never written that gold is added to the economy of Classic. I haven't failed to make a point just because you're ignorant enough to not realize what the point is. There's no reason for me to continue discussing with you since you're clearly not capable of having this discussion.
---
Unless Tauren, 2h Mace
---
I have no idea what your point is, but mine was that a keyboard like the one you linked in your original picture was actually quite good if it was a mechanical one. (although, to be honest I can't determine that from the picture) 
---
I should also add anything that is RNG based is a fickle lover and they will someones be great and other times they are gonna leave you out to dry.
---
I personally love RNG in combat but in some cases you need tried certainty to attain victory.
---
Yuek. 
---
The Un’Goro one - 43% for 30min.
---
Just go afk as warrior. 
---
Yea I don’t buy it either...  a 38 mage would have less than 1.5k hp 
---
There’s no lack of comprehension on my part. 
---
You used the word “transfer” in your OP. There is no transfer. 
---
You stated this would somehow impinge on the Classic economy. That is false, as it has the same effect on Classic that literally every other currency on the planet does. 
---
You’ve failed to make a point. Your post is highly downvoted. Might make sense to step back and accept that Tokens in retail will have no effect on Classic. 
---
This is the CLASSIC subreddit, not retail, you virgin. REEEE
---
While you might childishly view this is an heirloom, classic chads will instantly recognize this as the prestigious T.05 set "Of Elements"
---
Seems as though a toxic person is still posting, I can't tell because I have took advantage of the ignore tool.
---
There's always going to be a negative person no matter what. I highly suggest trying out the ignore tool as-well! Good-luck bro thanks for the read.
---
&gt; playing a human in a fantasy game
---
Sun is peaking through and is aligned with the toilet
---
Leave your tailored regurgitated answer aside, take a breather and think a bit about what I just said. 
---
If you can't beat a duel without RNG, you probably can't win one without it. It's simple as that. If your entire duel / game relies on a random 30% chance that something may or may not happen, then:
---
* you're either both insanely good and there's no room for your skill to improve
---
* there's plenty of room for your skill to develop past the point where you actually need that passive 
---
&gt; Some of things hardiness counters include [...] 
---
Yeah but you're not going to be hit all of those abilities at the same time. Also, I would like to correct your otherwise broken shit grammar:
---
&gt; Some of things hardiness **might** counter
---
As in it **might** counter it or it **might not** counter it.   
---
&gt; Basically Hardiness allows you to have an advantage against classes designed to counter you
---
But if you can't beat them without an unreliable RNG proc, you probably can't beat them without it. 
---
&gt; You HAVE an answer to fears through your trinket, spellstone and your felhunter
---
An answer which isn't based off an unreliable RNG proc. 
---
&gt; classes with stuns are FAR more popular for alliance pvp than the classes with fears as a response to the over representation of undeads
---
Because their answer to fear is not based off a random proc. Here, I'll try to explain how silly your line of reasoning goes, because what you're saying is:  
---
* Horde plays a lot of UD, therefore  
---
* Alliance plays classes which do stuns more than fears, which means
---
* Horde should play a lot of Orc to resist stuns, even though
---
* Alliance would switch to playing classes which do more fears than stuns, which leads to
---
* Horde playing more UD 
---
And that's why playing UD sucks, right? It's simply hilarious.  
---
&gt; they are on shorter CD's than the fears
---
I never said WotF was better than Hardiness, stop answering an imaginary argument I never made. I only said that "far" is an overstatement for how good the RNG proc passive is for the general purpose of ranking. 
---
&gt; This is incredibly apparent in higher level pvp WHICH should be acknowledged for people who are min/maxxing because they would ultimately be planning on participating in high level pvp
---
The fact that there there is a very significant amount of R13/R14 Warlocks on the Horde side who play UD invalidates that argument. You can get to R13/R14 without min-maxing your race. What you are saying has more to do with "tryharding" than it does with actually grinding 12-14 hours a day in BGs. 
---
&gt;  Resisting a 5 point kidney shot wins premade WSG's
---
I have never seen or heard anything like that, but if your WSG games depends on a 30% proc chance off a stun, it's probably a shit premade. 
---
Also the fact that you think any dedicated R13/R14 [premades are going to be going against other premades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7yrB4NYc-g) who know what they're doing half the time is also very silly of you to think about. 
---
Also, if Alliance premades can win against Horde premades without any significant passives like Hardiness and/or WotF then so can you. No serious PvP-er is ever going to take a player's race choice over having the skills, gear and consumables needed to win in PvP (go ahead and ask any) so you preaching to others that they HAVE to take Orcs if they want to PvP is just a load of crap. 
---
It's way more important to like your character and grind the fuck out of this game than which race you're playing. 
---
How do I do this on retail mate? 
---
WTF no potions!!!!
---
&gt; although, to be honest I can't determine that from the picture
---
That's entirely my point though. Most keyboards that look like the one in the picture I linked were not the equivalent of a mechanical keyboard. They were mushy rubber domes because that's what was cheap to make.
---
Well its not like giving taunt to pally will really issue with pally tank.
---
I see. If you had to walk back from GY (even if you suicide) that doesn't kill DM farming. If you had to walk back from Camp Mojache... well if that's the case you'd just suicide instead of /camp.
---
So it seems no matter what they do they can't kill DM farming. So it doesn't matter much whether or not they keep /camp.
---
You'd say there is still a place for 2h Fury though? I played a rogue throughout Vanilla and wanted to get away from dw. Was debating between a mage and warrior but the thought of having one of those iconic 2h swords is just very appealing to me. 
---
Well. Unless my faction is about to lose then i say fuck that noise we are winning this.
---
Back? I never plan on leaving. You need to hedge your bets. This is Activision Blizzard we're talking about.
---
Hope for the best, plan for the worst.
---
Lockpicking is so underrated. 
---
Yes!
---
Qualifications for being a mod: brown nosing Activision Blizzard, saying "how high" when being told to jump, at least 7 brain cells.
---
These mods meet and exceed all the qualifications. You really can't criticise them.
---
Notice that having played Vanilla, during or post retail, does not factor into the qualifications at all.
---
no you will not, unless you get really ahead of the pack youre going to be competing with a lot of players.
---
Another thing is that you cant play enough in a week, getting to 60 takes atleast 5 days of play time when the server is new. So unless you're able to play for 16 hours a day, you wont be able to get to 60 in a week.
---
It is not worthless at all, you'll be able to get a head of everyone who has to work, so you won't have to compete for the mobs.
---
that's.. exactly what the issue with prot paladin was. He could out-threat every other class in AoE fights, but single target fights he couldn't keep threat
---
I WISH! That thing was awesome. Bring back the old website, forums, and Screenshot of the Day while you’re at it.
---
Vanilla isnt like BFA, in bfa you get to max lvl in 3 days (if youre slow) and if you dont youll have a hard time to find people for dungs if you dont have a grp. 
---
In Vanilla people will get to 60 everyday, and because there isnt any catchup mechanics you'll always be able to find players to do dungeons with. The only reason why you should rush to 60 is if you wanna be with the best guilds on the server. If you just want to have fun and do pvp, you can easily take your time and enjoy the game.
---
Since it has many gameplay and balancing ramifications, especially in PvP, there is a (small) chance that Activision Blizzard will put in the money/development to reimplement this feature into Classic to make it more authentic to Vanilla.
---
So it is not irrelevant until Activision Blizzard outright states that they won't be putting the time or effort into implementing spell batching or "spell delay," whatever you call it.
---
With vampiric touch and shadow priests with this buff stacking 15001 times, you wouldn't need healers.
---
It's impossible to get to 60 in a week on a new server, the best of the best gets to 60 after 5 days of ingame playing time. So you'll have to play for like 16 hours a day in order to get to 60 in a week. 
---
It doesn't work this way in Vanilla. Once you "dismiss" the infernal and it is no longer your pet, if it kills a civilian NPC, you don't get a DK.
---
The infernal is essentially a hostile mob at that point.
---
you can be a druid tank in vanilla, your main role would be offtank. Warrior tanks is the most defensive, but druid tanks have more hp and will make more threat. 
---
Is there enough playerbase to sustain such a fractured game? They were hesitant enough to make Vanilla for good reason.
---
Every pserver I've played on, including the one I'm playing on now, either greatly suffered or completely died when TBC was launched.
---
People said fear the devilsaurs. I say fear these fuckers. 
---
And that you've gotten to lvl 60 atleast once on a private server in the last 1-2 years
---
New people are born all the time!
---
People play Diablo 2 *to this day,* it's been almost 20 years.
---
Mmhmmhmhmm 👅
---
Not unless you play for 16 hours a day
---
By transfer I mean personal transfer via exchange, If you give someone gold on server A and that player gives you gold on server B you have successfully transfered the value of your currency from server A to server B. If a Wow Token bought on a retail server gives you 30 days game time on both retail and classic servers ofcourse classic players will seek ways to use the token system if it means you’re saving your real money.
---
I don’t know if you’re just trolling or if you actually let reddit votes determine what makes a point valid or not.
---
I’m not sure where I may have upset you, because at this point you’re obviously just trying to belittle this post.
---
And you can go back to stv and start the war between the alliance and the horde
---
People still play Diablo 2 *to this day,* and that game is almost 20 years old.
---
Vanilla WoW will be fine, if they make it.
---
Log on my main and murder the whole party who attacked me until they leave
---
Haha true. 
---
If they are sticking to Vanilla as much as possible why would they make class changes?
---
i rayg evrytiem this happens to me.
---
We're getting 1.12 no chain wind storm procs.
---
Sorry, this was removed as per rule #7 (low-effort meme / the post needs to relate to Classic WoW besides just the post's title).
---
&gt;If you can't beat a duel without RNG, you probably can't win one without it. It's simple as that.
---
I mean... Thats wrong though. You arent accounting for the randomization of EVERYTHING else in vanilla... Resists are a thing... Resists are PART of what makes you win or lose. You arent listening. A rogue resisting your fear by chance or removing it WINS a fight. Similarly, resisting a rogues stun can singlehandedly win or lose a fight. Just because something is passive and isnt actively controlled by the player, doesnt make it less valuable...
---
&gt; I have never seen or heard anything like that, but if your WSG games depends on a 30% proc chance off a stun 
---
Again. They dont. But they also dont depend on engineering... They dont depend on consumes... Every effort you make, increases the chance that you will win. If you are making an effort to stack your own favor to winning, you will take Orc. Resisting a stun, may save me a consume OR another cooldown that affects the greater fight... I have seen a 5 point kidney be resisted in a WSG, which kept the flag carrier alive. It happens... With a 30% resist chance, it happens a shitload.
---
&gt; Also the fact that you think any dedicated R13/R14 [premades are going to be going against other premades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7yrB4NYc-g) who know what they're doing half the time is also very silly of you to think about. 
---
10 man Queues get priority. Unless teams are actively avoiding eachother - they ALWAYS Q against eachother. This was the way it was during my rank 13 grind on retail. The only other chance this wont happen is if there is a massive faction imbalance.
---
&gt; Also, if Alliance premades can win against Horde premades without any  significant passives like Hardiness and/or WotF then so can you. 
---
Making choices that give you slight advantages add up... If you take enough of them, you will win more often. Do you NEED to be a specific spec? No, but their are optimal specs. Do you NEED to take engineering? No... Do you NEED to be a specific race? No... They all add up. And Orc offers a MASSIVE, yes massive, advantage in pvp.
---
&gt; No serious PvP-er is ever going to take a player's race choice over having the skills 
---
Correct. But most serious PvPers will choose Orc anyways, because they want every advantage they can get. You also wont be cast out if you dont have engineering... Ive even premaded with some people who didnt take the time to get first aid... Does that make first aid useless? Every. Advantage. Matters. They all add up.
---
Orc. Is. Better. You can squirm and scream and have a tantrum, but its better. UD is better for PVE. You could argue that too until you choke on your own tears, but its true... UD are simply better for PVE as a warlock.
---
Sorry, this was removed as per Rule #7 (low-effort memes need to relate to Classic WoW more than just the title).
---
Makes sense thanks a bunch
---
I understand the lvling. I play on a private server to get figure out what class I want to play for when classic comes out. Still not sure. But I understand now thanks a bunch 
---
Yeah that's what I was referring to. 
---
&gt;	for many people TBC was peak WoW
---
Myself included. I’m hyped for Classic just because I agree with you that a Classic-&gt;TBC change will occur. 
---
I see thanks a bunch for clearing it up. All the videos I watch say that they aren't viable so I wasn't sure. Although I lvled a druid to 10 on a private server and druid definitely is slower than Hunter imo 
---
I play it through steam
---
Jerked off to this many times. 
---
When ganking, let the mobs finish them off for that sweet durability loss.
---
My boy.
---
Ishnu alah (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)
---
This is why I dwarf.
---
Ishnu alah you mighty traveller, you must be tired ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
If you are playing horde you can go 2hand fury just fine at least up until AQ.
---
I'd never skip on Fireball at 18 and I think Scorch R1 is pretty good as well especially if you're not going to AoE lvl that much. Going fire --&gt; Respec Frost AoE at 21 or so is pretty nice, or arcane for early AE until 21.. 
---
Or that fucking 30 second slow poison from some of the bats in EPL.
---
Well, I said it will occur if Classic is a success. I don't know what counts as enough of a success to merit Classic-TBC or whether Classic will achieve that level of success. But I hope it does.
---
Whoever can actually afford to craft it by themselves. It makes zero reason to spend guild ressources ( yes even ingots) for someone to craft some meme pvp cool weapon. So in advance if people wanna farm then 10k-ish gold required to craft it, they can get it. If there's too many, then you can start thinking about who to give it to, but mostly you are not even gonna have one.
---
Aye I know but it's the first thing that popped into my head when I found the gif 😂
---
no it has no windows and has like fucked up looking texture
---
No gloves on, nor bracers. ONE 1h dagger, on a shaman. But this guys obviously in tier.. or its just a screen shot from after wrath and he's like level 12 in boa shoulders.
---
You should still go for it IMO. If you nolife the first 4-5 days, you will easily escape the zerg within 20 hours, and will be able to pretty much quest effortlessly all the way to 60 even if you take 2-3 weeks for it. 
---
Aight, deal.
---
So paladins get a baseline melee ability, as do shamans (enh having SS + melee makes them actually decent in PvE dps)
---
Then Paladins get taunt and shamans get what?  Shaman tanking was scraped and due to them only getting 1 "holdover" update since release (re-working talent trees slightly, making SS a 31pt talent, nerfing WF, and promising a "rea'" update that wouldn't come until months into TBC)  what do shamans get? A baseline melee ability even its its like a mana inexpensive holy damage heroic  strike and taunt would make them quite good 5 man tanks.  How is horde going to be compensated for alliance now having comparitively huge advantages in pve with a third viable tank option? Do you give shamans something else to make them potent DPS class (since they are already massively bursty in pve/pvp anyway) or what?  
---
Sounds good to me .. thanks now to start a new thread to figure out which class to play. It's a tie between Hunter/druid/warrior
---
&gt; no gloves
---
Not sure if trolling or not? 
---
Gamecube released in 2001, wrath in 2008.
---
This picture came from vanilla.
---
I don't have a lot of memories of the keyring from Vanilla since it was added so late.. Wouldn't exactly call it 
---
&gt;it was still part of Vanilla's full fledged experience
---
not even wearing a dress.
---
Bingo.
---
They were designed to be a zero skill floor, tanky as fuck, healing class.
---
And people act surprised when they are told this...
---
Some mobs, its 30-50% (Salt Flats / Un'Goro)
---
*Laughs in Shaman/Paladin*
---
Aight, so then you need to wait for your racial to CD then.  A vast improvement, but its still getting applied on your ass one way or another.
---
After that it's pretty much DW or bust?
---
Not gonna lie I don't really feel comfortable telling people to skip learning Fireball and Scorch (hence why it's orange), the reason for that is because:   
---
- While fighting frost-resistant mobs you're gonna use Fireball and then Scorch to kill them off
---
- When you get ganked you'll use those spells especially on Rogues where you're gonna be casting Fireball right after sheeping him.
---
- Scorch is surprisingly not that good because using a wand is better because it costs no mana (meaning it doesn't trigger the 5s rule, so you'll be regenerating a bit of mana before the combat ends) and has no pushback.
---
Also, I think I should mention it on the "Leveling Talents" tab, but I actually focus on a single target leveling build, the reason for that is because if you're reading this document odds are you're gonna be playing Classic on day one, and during launch there is absolutely no way that you'll be able to AoE level to 60.     
---
I heard a thousand stories about people telling me that they will be ahead of the pack but in the end I don't think many of us will be, so instead of risking using an AoE spec just to realize later that you can't AoE anything, I think Mages are better off focusing on an optimized single target spec, I actually talk about it on the FAQ section of the "Info" tab. :P
---
Well....
---
...compared to many, *many* other specs and classes -- yes.  They still have a comparatively low skill ceiling and basically non-existent skill floor.
---
Seriously, funny quest names and references are some of my favorite things to come across in the game ❤️
---
That isn't the point of that slide and nowhere in the presentation do they say that. 
---
Alliance players also hate Ret, too -- mostly because the moron ret player is taking away the potential of being a holy paladin. The thing that makes alliance so strong. 
---
Ret is a joke untill you are going reck bombs on unsuspecting players in world PvP or are so insanely geared that is any other class was equally as gear they would just global you.
---
All the long list of alliance advantages associated with paladins come from Holy Paladin support/healers.  Not Rets getting out damaged by a hunter pet.
---
Healers? Where we're going we won't need healers!
---
Because those games were and still are good games.  At some point game designers just started reinventing the wheel instead of actually coming up with something new.
---
Right right, thanks!
---
&gt; If you don't get this, you have never ridden in one or had to work on one.
---
Yeah I kinda have. Thats why I used that ad example. One in my family used to own one. An original that wasn't "improved"...
---
You think that WoW Classic is going to launch without anyone developing a threat addon? Or just using the threat addon people used in Legion?
---
Yes. It was blizzard's attempt to throw some quests in because people were complaining the 50 to 60 grind was unbearable, because there weren't nearly enough quests. It was something like 1.6 they added them in searing gorge. It didn't solve the problem, but it helped.
---
The original succubus model did nothing wrong!
---
That would make sense unless they charge full subscription for a 14y old game...
---
The 50% less Healthregen is even better as a Warrior.
---
I once used that trail case as a bookmark. 
---
A girl in class went into my stuff, pulled out the disk and thought it was porn. 
---
Don't attack anyone. Kill them if they attack me. Or CC and leave if possible to not waste my time. 
---
World pvp heroes are always the worst pvp'ers. Was funny how many pvp tryhards were awful in arena once TBC came out. 
---
i've been using [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9shygt/how_you_felt_when_you_entered_stormwind_first_time/) one someone posted a while ago, it reminds me of the first time i walked in stormwind, 
---
Man, I forgot all about Figure Prints. 
---
&gt;I don’t know if you’re just trolling or if you actually let reddit votes determine what makes a point valid or not.
---
No. But it shows that your peers in this community don’t think your OP is worth discussing. All of the responses to your post have been variations of “this would happen with any other currency.”
---
&gt;classic players will seek ways to use the token system if it means you’re saving your real money.
---
Without the token they’d do it by trading gold for gametime or actual real world currency to convert to game time. The existence of the token has no bearing on that type of transaction. Those transactions can and will occur regardless. 
---
&gt;you have successfully transfered the value of your currency from your character on server A to your character on server B
---
No. You haven’t. 
---
Even if one were to pretend that qualified as a transfer, what keeps a person from transferring their real world wealth into WoW. By buying gold. 
---
&gt;obviously just trying to belittle this post.
---
No. I’m discussing it with you. I’m patiently and painstaking explaining to you how it isn’t a problem. 
---
You clearly didn’t post this to discuss it. 
---
Heroic bosses in the main are more difficult than majority of Vanilla and WOTLK bosses, mythic is just a different level entirely. 
---
Nope, only need level 5 to de everything. 
---
PVP is dumb. More raid bosses please.
---
Nah man, i dont think it implies it happened long ago, just that it already happened and he's looking forward to more of those types of experiences. Also why do people even care about Karma in the first place? Isn't it just a meaningless number?
---
&gt;If you were in a progressive raiding guild then you 100% did have these every raid
---
But we can literally see in videos top vanilla guilds wearing non-BIS gear? The world first Rag kill has rogues without weapon enchants. 
---
The Devilsaur mafia is another thing that I absolutely loved when I heard about it. Apparently a guild did a hostile takeover of all the Devilsaur spawns in Un'Goro to control all of the high-end leather on the server on one of the post-Nostalrius servers (Light's Hope?)
---
In real life messing with laissez-faire capitalism or militias taking over natural resources is terrible but there's something beautiful in this. With a basic Auction House system in-game we got the dark side of economics represented quite well.
---
Yet Frost mages are still extremely viable in 1v1
---
It was fun to have to take the right set of keys along to a particular adventure. Kinda weird though that your key took up the same space as a breastplate. :)
---
We are for sure, I wasn't saying you can't PvP without those spells, it's just that it helps a lot.
---
In patch 1.5, 8 months after release
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.5.0#Quests
---
My last solo playthough on a vanilla like xp server was 120 hours as a paladin. Hopefully I'll get that down to 104 like I expect to with my math and multiple tests.
---
I'll be 30 in the first 24 hour stretch. That'll likely put me **quite** a ways ahead of the pack.
---
&gt;So unless you're able to play for 16 hours a day, you wont be able to get to 60 in a week.
---
If you're taking a week off of work to play wow, you're playing 16 hours a day. 
---
I'll check the post when back on my computer, but I don't see how a mage can't spec for Frost aoe and still be confident in wpvp. It is a minimal investment and kiting+cc is what wins fights anyways for mages
---
Good examples. I lost count how many times the cloak of shadows situation happened to me on various private servers. Really frustrating and can definitely be a game changer. That spell doesn't exist in vanilla, but I'm sure there are other scenarios where spell delay is just as important there (like vanish). It's really sad that most people don't care about it or even think it's stupid. It's authentic after all.

No I'm talking about the leveling, you can't use an AoE leveling build when a server launches, especially when it's the game launch, there will be so much people that you won't be able to AoE anything, I think you're mixing 2 different things together :P

Well the sad truth is that they're charging full subscription for BfA, Classic is free if you're subbed.

I had the orc version  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

No, that is not my argument. Are consumables required for Naxx? For the most part no. That is my argument. I never said anything about clear times or effort and whatnot, you're the one parroting that.
---
And i have no idea how long it would take to clear naxx without consumables, i also have no idea what it is you are arguing for here? The topic was in short: Are consumables required for naxx? And you're talking about cleartimes, effort and i don't know what you mean about the 30h/week naxx of vanilla would not happen again either. Do you mean that if today people went into Naxx with no consumables, they would spend 30 hours a week there or not? No idea, as i said our challenge was that nobody knew how to kill the bosses, nobody knew what they did, there were no videos or guides since everyone kept their killstrats to themselves as long as possible. That's why we spent so much time in there, we cleared whatever we had killed before and then we moved on to what we had not killed before and try to figure that out.
---
And since we managed to kill a bunch of stuff in there withouot consumables and without todays knowledge of the game and raid-comp, i would safely say that people today would clear it even faster than we did. I don't think they will be stuck on patchwerk for a week trying to figure out how hateful strike works.

Improved blizzard is 3 talent points, so "using an aoe leveling build" translates to "spend 3 points on imrpoved blizzard." Going fire for leveling isn't efficient anyways, and only begins to be close towards 40. The only thing I'm not sure on is what you mean. Whether or not you can find a place to AoE is up on the air. If you are alone, on off hours, etc and need to grind between quests, there's 0 reason a frost spec can't aoe. 3 talent points = full AoE spec complete
---
Explain please?
---
ah I see. so your answer was explicitly only to the question of the requirement for consumables? in that case I'd agree with you, there is almost no need for consumables (except maybe some Absorbtion potions). I also understood this question in a broader conext of "will I actually be able to clear naxxramas without consumes", but that was not the OPs question, just my thoughts to it. and in that context, it obviously matters how many raid evenings you need, and if consumables significantly reduce the time needed for clear, it cluld well be that OP won't find a guild with enough ppl who don't wanna use consumes and instear prefer to raid longer, although I also don't know how much of an impact consumables have (I believe it to be the case).
---
but yes I agree, consumables are not a requirement, and that was the OPs question.

Great guide. Lots of great information. The one nit-pick suggestion i have is about using pyro cast time as a means of dropping ignite. And this is really just overthinking min/maxing, but in most cases, for all except the mage that is high on threat, casting a frostbolt + fireball will result in more dps than a pyro. I've done the math in the past and i'm just spitballing now because i don't have the numbers in front of me. But you'll need something like 40 seconds of ignite ticks for that damage to catch up with the frostbolt damage woven in at the start. few fights will allow for that much uninterrupted rolling before the mob or the mage is dead.

looks like regular AC2 female plate mail.

I'm talking about efficiency on a realistic scenario:     
---
1) AoE leveling spec = 3/3 (or at least 2/3) Imp Blizzard and have 0/3 Frostbite, which would have helped you a lot in PvP, not that it is required but it definetly helps you. (+ on single target it helps you to kill your target faster, when you proc Frostbite you can then have a +50% crit chance bonus via Shatter, and 5/5 Ice Shards takes your crit from a x1.5 multiplier to x2)    
---
2) As I said there is absolutely no way that you will be able to AoE grind your way to 60 if you plan on playing at launch because of the amount of players running around, you will have zero spot all for yourself, AoE grinding is by far the best way to level if you can do so in peace, which will not happen when Classic launches.    
---
3) This is the reason why I'm telling people to use the most optimized single target spec, if you decide to use an AoE build just to realize that you can't AoE anything, you are gonna waste your time and money to respec to single target so I'm in firm belief that going straight for the most efficient single target build is the best thing to do to level up on heavily crowded servers. I can't just tell people to use the best AoE build, I would screw over a lot of people.

I mean he could have made it less distracting by flipping the real life image instead. And actually, now that I think about it, warriors in WoW always wield 1h weapons in their right hand.

But hey, I'm just the peanut gallery. :)

-2 points for wielding a shield in the right hand (impossible in WoW). Great idea for a cospay though lol
---
This wud make for some badass rp
---
Yep I agree pretty much. Unless, either way it seems DM farming will be able to adapt pretty easily. Maraudon on the other hand might be effected more. Perhaps BRD as well.
---
Thanks man I really appreciate it!    
---
I'm not sure I fully understood what you meant by "you'll need something like 40 seconds of ignite ticks for that damage to catch up with the frostbolt damage woven in at the start."
---
I have a question about the "Frostbolt + Fireball" thing though, did you take into account the fact that using Pyroblast is gonna make the new Ignite stronger? Or did you just calculated the damage of the raw damage from those spells? What you explained sounds interesting.
---
Lemmings Paintball was the shit!

That I could skin the same mobs over and over for skill ups if there were enough of them in one spot, I think it was 4 or 5. That bug still worked in WotLK when I leveled skinning on alts for the passiv crit bonus from having the profession.

Outside of their stunlock in later patches they can be a bit vulnerable, but a skilled Rogue with Engineering is always dangerous. I don't think they are that impactful in BGs though. 1 at most in a premade.

Isnt that how you become Morbent Fel? Pretty sure that's how.
