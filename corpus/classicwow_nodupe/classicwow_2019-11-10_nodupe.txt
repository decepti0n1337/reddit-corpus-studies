imagine considering that there's more settings u use your class in other than a raid encounter

the class design is not bad because it has been theorycrafted into one button in one specific game mode

Will 40 man be viable? Or was 5 man death squad more prevalent in Vanilla?

Used to get up in the middle of the night and hope my parents didn’t catch me playing wow. Now I get up in the middle of the night and hope my wife doesn’t catch me playing classic.

I don't even believe he's dead, prolly just off on his island.
---
Figured I’d share some recent luck while grinding Blood Elves in Azshara. It’s actually 2x Libram of Verocity and a Warmonger in under 3 hours LOL
---
Problem is it takes 30 seconds to craft 1 mask, so you’ll be  be looking at ~24g/h which is alright if you are afking but otherwise it’s not that great
---
It would make more sense if he celebrated after his roll then lost. But rolling and losing has nothing to do with his name. So you are justified in not understanding the post, because OP is really reaching here.
---
Go alch if you are gonna farm herbs. make free action potions, limited invulnerable pots and swiftness pots. lw doesn’t make money outside the salt shaker cd and devilsaur set which drops in price everyday.
---
If threat is a problem just equip more dps gear. You do have more dps than a prot warr, and that helps your threat. If its just normal ads, losing aggro is usually fine unless you let the healer get aggro.
---
And If it's single target, you have more threat than a prot warr.
---
Fury warriors are also after cadav, for the record. It's the best piece outside of savage glad chain and if youre just trying to gear up for raids its smarter to go after cadav first.

Careful, salty alliance will down vote you because they wish that could be on that level. What server are you on?
---
Now imagine that your class has a reputation of weeping the group,  has no real aoe, and whose CC can't compete with sap or poly, or even shackle.  
---
That's hunter life,  cheers mate,  it can always be worse.  Imagine being a ret pally.

There's two quests. The Pledge of Secrecy and Show Your Work. You need to complete both TPoS and SYW before you make the switch, or you'll be unable to take a new engineering specialization.
---
And my post gets removed for being "low effort"... oof!
---
Same!
---
I really dislike this mentality. I’m casual AF and I really like that there are things in this game that I’ll never have the time to achieve. It makes the more interesting and flavorful to see those rare few people running by with a High Warlord title etc, or a legendary item.
---
Everyone doesn’t need to be able to do every single thing. At least with these titles when you look at someone who has achieved it you can think ”wow this person went hard as fuck, good for them”. When I see someone with Sulfuras or Thunderfury I just think “wow look at this luck sack”.
---
Shadowstep.
---
What class do you play OP?
---
All these splitraids are just to funnel loot to the maincore of players from the guild, if youre hardcore enough and spend the time to set up a second raid, your not going to give away gear to some random guy joining the guild yhat hit 60 a week ago.
---
Ez, never join a group where anything is reserved because reservations are dumb.
---
Not LW.  The crest of gold with that comes with getting recipes early, and even the 3 day cooldown on it nets under 20g these days.

Alchemy has endless customers.  Pots in vanilla sell like drugs IRL.
---
That buff though...
---
I mean... it's manifestly evident that I don't give a shit about karma.
---
I do give a shit about sock-puppeting, though. One of the signs of it is a pattern in the vote totals.
---
That's not why I think you're sock-puppeting, btw.
---
Lots of classes have 0 reason to pug it.  Tanks just get to use their role to extort money from the group.
---
Yes you can easily stealth there but I’m not sure if 1 fire elemental or 2 is guarding it.  
---
You could probably solo 1 but 2 might be a bit hard.
---
YOU stopped reading there. Lol
---
I mean I'm legitimately just me, so its entertaining to me how you got to that conclusion.
---
top meme because so damn true
---
Mankrik is a really good server.
---
How do you get to 2 hours a week? Sure if you only raid MC it will be 2 hours a week at some point. But when BWL comes out I will run 5 hours of BWL and 3 hours of MC + Ony a week most likely. And by the time ZG comes out it will be even more.
---
Sorry for the genocide afterwards :p
---
This is also incorrect. WoW is the casual game, yes. The intent was to make 90% of the game accessible to the masses, and leave that 10% for the hardcore people.
---
Modern WoW philosophy is to make 99.9999999999999999999999999999999% for the masses.
---
&gt;Thanks for proving my point tho. I should just roll a warrior if so many people are so clueless.

Besides annihilator (crazy expensive) bone slicing is about as good as it gets until ony (and your war dps would hate you for taking it)

You can always get a second account.

Corpse running is not a good plan since you would have to run into orange or purple.
---
I don't mind. I was horde on a medium pop server in vanilla that had a 2-2.5 to 1 alliance heavy ratio.
---
But you could still only get games during prime time, and even then the queues could still be 30m because it was only really premades that queued. Which meant that you end up waiting 30m for WSG and be matched against a sweaty full t2 guild.. So all the randoms on your team just leave. 
---
And nobody queued for AV because it favors alliance so much
---
Crossrealm BGs was such a saving grace. Fuck those people that had zero clue what it was like because they happened to luckily pick a better server

Cloak of shadows

&gt; Is it going to be rough leveling holy?

yes, unless you are doing only dungeons

yes easily, you just need to buy some int gear off the AH.
---
I would think druid, that way you can fill a variety of roles as needed.

The rage cost of Heroic Strike is more around 25-30 when you factor in the lost potential rage.

Damn you got that right, I got a huge portion of 1KN done in that hour.

This honestly threw me off a lot about FFXIV. Such long fucking GCD. The other part being that healers are required to DPS.

True. And you have multiple accounts.

I have only ignored people who were just the worst of the worst, which puts my ignore list at 4 people since launch. I can’t imagine ignoring someone over something small like a simple whisper.

That's still not exactly what I'd call burst.  Burst is getting shatter combo'd or cheapshot into a CB evisc combo for all your life.  Burst is a huge windfury proc or EM CL+ES.  Moonkin just do normal caster things with no extraordinary cooldowns.

So I was really really having a hard time with rotgrip to the point that I was losing my sanity and wasting time and money on repairs on top of it. Then I came across this video and it completely changed the farm for me https://youtu.be/E9ti6M9socc. Now I dont do exactly what he does, but his rotgrip and princess strat is easy even with bad gear. I do my run a little differently. So watch the video first then read my explanation. Since I have mining it makes the timing of his route difficult for me so what I do is I kill gizlock and while kiting him toward princess instead of toward rotgrip. Then I kill princess and hop down to rot grip boom done. The only thing that sucks is I have to wait a few minutes for rotgrip so Im trying to tweak my run a little. If you dont have mining though Id say you could just follow exactly what he is doing except when im waiting for rotgrip the second time I like to summon a voidwalker just incase I need to sac and save myself. Also bring bandages and pots. 4 gold on a couple stacks of runecloth is absolutely worth it trust me. Also if rotgrip brings a hydra with him dont worry. The hyrda is always a little behind so youll have a second to kill rotgrip then fear and dot the hyrda. Hope some of this advice is helpful. Like I said though if you dont mining just follow his route. ALSO if you dont  barov peasent caller I highly reccomend you get it. I use my void walker to trigger her AOE, but if he dies the BPC can come in really clutch. The CD on it lines up perfectly so you can use it once a run.
---
You use the rage generated from the whelps to yellow hit Onyxia, that’s the strategy I’ve been using since the server launched.

Just casts the appropriate form depending on whether u swimming or not
---
These are my most important macros I use, most of them you can just replace the spell name with another and it works fine, but the spammable form macro the "noform:1" needs to change to whatever order your forms show. Like if cat form is the 3rd button on shapeshift bar you'd have a "noform:3" instead
---
The mouseover macros just let you use a spell on someone without needing to target them. Basically, if you're mouseover on someone's frame or their in-game char, it'll cast the heal on them without needing to target them. Otherwise, it'll heal your target. Otherwise  yourself. I think that's how it works
---
Im alliance irl. Dont wanna be the same in a game
---
I think I am lucky but I have to say Loot Council. My guild has handled it really well, no tanks are on the council (including GM), all the big items havent had any controversy. Though it may be a bit different from the usual, our officer will sometimes tell a few people or specific classes to roll.
---
Edit: we also have a private wish list with 3 items that can weigh in.
---
Unfortunately, I agree. Seems like he just went to his neighborhood tattoo shop to get a pretty complex tattoo. Nothing against tattoo artists in those shops, but in my experience a lot of them aren’t the best. Gotta go to someone doing freelance work or someone that owns their own

The trouble is, that is all of them... for now... you’ll be back and forward for quite a while haha

Uhh , flamestrike &gt; coc &gt; ae is way more dmg than blizzard..

Blizzard isn't about damage, it's about control. Sorry your favorite YouTuber didn't tell you that one, maybe that's why you're blizzarding 2 mobs at a time in a dungeon :l
---
Yep
---
Maybe you would if you read it again.
---
Then scream about how it’s allowed so everyone can shut up... before whining when the system gets changed to stop you being assholes.
---
What sucks is that the really fun world PvP dies at the same time, not that they ever wanted that anyway.
---
bruh, horde fans are so desperate, they make it part of their personality. 
---
Looks good tho.
---
4G?  More like 4Porn.
---
Bigglesworth is looking pretty good these days
---
I did it with 30 first time and the guy died in like half a second it was hilarious. We were all convinced this was closer to an actual raid boss. 
---
Did it with 10 people the second time and we kept wiping over and over.  The dude fears non-stop and sends a fuck ton of skeletons that will hit your casters over and over.
---
Grabbed about 7 more people and we got him down really easy.
---
So I’d suggest 15 ppl honestly. Or 10 of your most most geared and skilled players in your guild on discord.
---
We're still talking about MC here?
---
Rumor has it they scrapped the Air quest and gave it to the Warriors for their Whirlwind axe quest.
---
Wooosh
---
grob too
---
I can see you are a special needs person but there is a difference between being the only person that can use the item than saying you are the only one allowed to loot it even if someone else can.
---
Well this will be a very unique build then. Cause that sword is raaaare
---
Issue was auroattacks werent unique lol
---
Yeah that's the point though, I literally sneeze on my server and 15 hunters hit 60. 
---
It's not everyone elses fault that there's 4,000,000 of you waiting in the wings while everyone scrounges for the 25-50 tanks on the server who had the wherewithal to crawl to 60.
---
If I did that bullshit, which I *tried* on a warrior, I'd want to get paid too. That experience was agonising, levelling a hunter by contrast is such a breeze I don't look at my screen except to see if I have arrows.
---
I just remember it from back in the day. As a priest I would use SP and downrank the longer cast heals to optimize.
---
IF to Duskwood is even worse. The "direct" flightpath got a lot more expensive when I discovered the FP in Searing Gorge.
---
Yeah, the one in Menethil is the only one that sells the black horse though.
---
Losing a roll on item that drops on 1/20 or 1/30 runs adds up as well.
---
What on earth are you  talking about? Do you not understand how reserving works or something?
---
You reserve an item before starting the run so other people who need the item wont join you. That is the whole point.
---
A group with X item reserved will have just one person who needs the item (the guy that deserved it).
---
thank god this man is in my guild :D
---
I love watching skarm streams. He inspired me to make s druid alt lol
---
?!?!?!?
---
Grob is amazing so glad I rolled on it.
---
Life of a tank
---
Laughs in mage
---
I would say you really can’t go wrong with the mage or priest. Mages to me seem like the most well rounded class in the game with a rootlike that allows you to do so much. So much CC, AoE potential, and big damage.  Not to mention being able to create portals, food, and water for some extra utility and money making potential. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve thrown a fellow mage a gold or two in a random town for some snacks and a portal. That gold will add up quick and people will Always be looking for it. 
---
Priests are amazing as well. You can level as shadow and still be able to heal quite well in dungeons. Also PvP as a shadow priest from what I have seen looks like so much fun and you are a god in duels.
---
Warlock is what I currently play as my alt and it’s what I have always played since wrath. Tons of utility, always in demand for raids, and we scale really well as the phases come out for good damage. Also having a pet adds another layer of utility for you to use in the open world for leveling and soloing. 
---
If you are in a guild that’s looking for a certain type of caster maybe ask them and see what they need. That way you can try a class that interests you and also help flesh out your guilds roster. But don’t let that be the deciding factor, play what you think looks cool and what you like the most or you may just get burned out.
---
It looks like tanking is not for you. 
---
You are the tank you are the leader of the run. 
---
Its not hard to get even the spergiest person to follow your rules.
---
Level a warrior and see if you can make it to 40, let alone 60.
---
I wonder if it’s possible to write an addon that talks between guildies on the boat, that’s the best you could probably get in terms of syncing
---
It's percentile based. How big the server is doesn't matter, it's how often the average player PvPs.
---
I'd go warlock, you can both rock your pets and you won't share gear. 
---
Hunter shouldn't take too much damage while leveling, so go heals if you think you'll enjoy it later on for endgame. You can soulstone res too
---
At that point everyone knowing you is gameplay too. Worthless nobodies don't kill old gods, with or without help. Also as far as I know canonically the bosses were killed by a "group of adventurers" not really some endless army of grunts.
---
Yeah, literally had that exact situation happen to me in a PUG for MC.  Raid Leader basically didn't want to waste much time explaining the fight to 6 or 7 people and we just went in and did our thing.  Boss goes down with only a handful of people alive and actually says "that was a clean fight guys!". lol. 
---
But yeah, I was agreeing with you that it doesnt really matter how good or awake the Raid Leader is in MC because its pretty easy, even for PUGs.
---
No you
---
&gt;It's a little known fact that it's possible to get on top of the arena in Gadgetzan.

No need to convince me, my comment was meant to illustrate just how valuable it is to spend time on things you enjoy.

---
I immediately recognized the name as someone who specifically snipes auctions. That’s when I knew I was fucked, and my stomach dropped.
---
Oh well, hopefully it made that persons weekend.
---
Just because they're 60 doesn't mean they're ready for pvp
---
I can only think of the bracers from DM:N that are easily soloable.
---
I play 21 hours per week and am level 53.
---
Oh nice! Good to know
---
I finally ended up paying a guy 100g to get BT for me after being level 60 for a month or so. He bascially just kept track of the spawn time and I got it within an hour. It's worth it for me because I'm done with everything else and I can farm that gold much quicker than camping a spot for 8 hours+ but I would say while levelling, humar or any pet faster than 1.3 attack speed is perfectly fine. It's the same damage, just applied quicker. Though if you're doing quests, it can't hurt to check his spawns sometimes.
---
No clue if this is true or not. But.
---
"Heartseeker has too many alliance, what servers have a lot of horde that can transfer to Heartseeker to balance it out?"
---
On paper the idea makes sense.
---
I'm definitely not the best tank in the world, but a lot of tanks need to understand you're not going to hold aggro all the time. Especially in big groups or when you have higher leveled and geared groups. You should be able to find groups easily and most people aren't going to kick you out of groups unless you're really bad.
---
This is totally gonna get hotfixed.
---
Eh. Played the same game for 15 years which at 25 is a significant block of my life. I wouldn’t mind adding a dwarf tribute, but never cared much for any of the other alliance races.
---
I would never tank UBRS without one res. Every item a good tank wants from there is &lt;5% drop chance. The belt and shield are common and any tank who's going for SGC/HoJ will already have had them
---
You really don't even need to do reserves, you just find DPS who don't want whatever you're going for. 
---
Maybe you can find some fresh 60 to tank who wants to roll on every item, but good luck finding a tank who only needs HoJ in a group where 5 people want to roll on it.
---
Yes. I sometimes hit moba for 3-4k crits. Very useful as a paladin tank as a means of getting agro back that is lost, or bubbling and 2 shotting people in pvp
---
&gt; I haven't signed up for classic yet but seeing these 'reserved' posts makes me not want to,
---
...Just don't join those groups?
---
We did it to ourselves by PVPing on a PVP server? Hmm
---
Not me. I want TBC.
---
It only works if you make the name on an account that isn’t associated with you. Can’t use your own account to do it
---
Several quests have turn ins in Ru'theran village
---
Sigh. Why you heff to be so spot on?
---
Nothing.
---
The WoW economy is inflationary in nature. While there are 'gold sinks' to mitigate this, over time supply of everything rises. This does include the monetary supply as well, but the effective cost of raw materials in WoW will almost always drop long-term. Hording raw materials is almost never a winning strategy.
---
That being said, the WoW economy does undergo short-term price spikes. If you watch the price of dreamfoil on a weekly basis, you'll notice the price spikes on the weekends. Why? Because of all those raiders who want Major Mana Potions and Greater Fire Protection Potions. However, the following Monday, the price starts dropping again.
---
On a slightly longer cycle, you'll also notice some price fluctuations. Consider Black Lotus. This is more valuable when a new raid is first released and diminishes in value the longer the raid is around. Why? Because players first entering the instance are pushing the curve on content while the same content is simply on farm a month later - they just don't need the Flasks any more.
---
Perhaps the best investment is in materials that have no use right now but will have a very good use once certain content is released. Unfortunately, if you know of such a material, so does everyone else. The lack of information asymmetry means that you can't really 'get an edge on the market' because the known future price fluctuation is already incorporated into the cost.
---
Perhaps the simplest way to grasp this is to recognize that you're never going to beat the people playing the market. The only way to make gold is to exploit the people who don't care about the market - such as those raiders who buy their potions on a Friday night because they don't really care much about the cost.
---
Ah you just want all the information handed to you. Try googling.

There is PVP, then there is just griefing. Camping every Alliance quest hub and instance portal with 40 men deep raids to gank the 2-3 Alliance you'll find is just fucking lame. If you want to consider that "PVP" then you deserve Skeram.

that's not really much to brag about, not being able to down rag pre submerge means total raid dps is quite mediocre.
---
If they are doing AoE group, yes. As long as there is one mage with imp Blizz you are good.

Also, if this is ZF, Blizz is literally not needed. AE spam with CoC and Shatter is far more efficient.
---
There are a lot of people in this thread that are stupid.
---
F
---
The best AoE groups I ran with didn't even run with a tank. 3 mages a priest and myself on warlock. Accidental wipes covered by ss, ridiculous xp/hr rates once we got a rhythm set. All about getting the IB, CS CDs on a rotation and Frost Nova on a rotation during the pull depending on who does the iceblock.
---
Whoever posted this, nice try
---
You forget that most players are bad. The improved blizzard slow is there to make it safer, as the mobs will move so slowly that even the worst of players can AoE with ease.
---
For hardcore guilds, sure it’s not anything to brag about. For a casual, 1/3rd pug raid, it’s stellar
---
Tell that to the dps who complain bout tank aggro when they spam rain of fire and blizzard the moment you charge in
---
I wish, I dont know anything about WoW addons, I took a look myself but I dont know what to change to remove it or turn it into a rep bar :(
---
I assume he typed AH before seeing the second roll, so he celebrated too soon.
---
But your have to play alliance so that’s a total dealbreaker.
---
Those WeakAuras gave me cancer

Randomly lashing out just because a group of people are mentioned. Classic reddit
---
My guild uses ep/gp and I really like that. Basically effort points (ep) works the same as dkp, but then when you get loot you get gear points (gp). And basically the person with the highest ratio will get the loot. And when so when someone gets loot their ratio becomes worse and they won't be getting more loot for a bit.
---
Definitely is a bug. It shouldn’t be applying bonus heal like that.
---
I could probably pickpocket brd at lvl 49 couldn't i?
---
You're fine with that.  Remember your food too.
---
He isn’t lying. Heartseeker is a great server for horde.
---
That’s how I feel about mages
---
On the global scale LOL Buddy anyone making over $15,000 a year is in the top bracket globally.
---
Are you like envious or something? $30 CAD (~$22/hr USD) is not the top 1% even on the global scale.
---
$30/hr CAD is nice but it's still the bottom of the middle class. 
---
Living paycheque to paycheque includes putting money in savings because that's a necessity to get ahead, otherwise you're just spinning your wheels in the mud. If I have nothing left over after my budgeting by the next paycheque then I'm living paycheque to paycheque.
---
You have to take into account where someone's living when you start thinking $X/hr is "alot".
---
$90k/yr in a rural area is a nice living for a family, $90k/yr in Toronto, Vancouver, New York etc is barely affording a one bedroom for yourself AND a vehicle.
---
Just gotta take initiative. Lots of people afraid to start groups will find it kinda sucks at first then you get an eye for what comps are good. Dungeons will start to suck less and less. Just gotta take a little time to learn it.
---
keep slice up, press sinister strike  
---
tada
---
That’s actually pretty cheap for the set. Prices on my server have been going down for the most part with some fluctuation. Starting out, the legs were selling for 120g and the gloves for 80g. Right now, the legs go for 80g and the gloves for around 40g. 
---
For me personally, I’d buy the gear and wait for the epic mount. But that’s a Hunter’s perspective! :)

---
Lol if that’s real and not a huge exaggeration then horde on Skeram deserve a dead server.
---
With a decent group, it's not. If the group is bad/has low DPS 1 mage with Imp Blizz may be necessary to help with kiting.
---
proof this is a bug? I couldnt find any info about people trying to use bonus healing with it.   
---
Would love a confirm on this.
---
Eventually, maybe. But people are definitely going to be more people online next week than last week.
---
What does he say to Alliance druids?
---
Pls buy a bigger monitor
---
The alliance on the server do the same thing to horde lol.
---
Well don't worry, MC is so nerfed in the current version that you'll be able to hit 60 and pug a raid full of morons in leveling greens and still probably kill everything except maybe rag.
---
Cats are 1.3 attack speed by the way. Exceptions are broken tooth at 1.0, the rake at 1.2, and the two white lions (echeyakee and I forget the name but it's a level 60) at 2.0.
---
Your point is still valid and I agree, just wanted to clear that up
---
You can make it either pummel or shield bash based on if you have a shield equipped or not. I can show you my macro tomorrow if you want. 
---
You can also make your macros click a certain action bar slot, so every time you upgrade a weapon or shield, you just drag it to that slot and the macro equips that instead of your previous item.
---
One less blue item in the chest, I think.
---
Pff idiots mages are kings of aoe even in fire spec!And i say that as a lock.Frost nova ,flamestrike ,arcane explosion and blast wave.No need for frost especially in dungeon
---
Not really... Any halfway decent rogue will Just blind/restealth and wait it out.  The biggest thing is to berserker rage out of sap/gouge and free action if you're getting bleed kited.  If they can't stunlock or kite you'll smack down a rogue toe-to-toe.
---
Druid if you are interested in playing every role. Rogue or warrior if you want to dps.
---
Yea and they will  all say they played vanilla but what they really mean I “I played on a private server”. It’s a whole different experience as I played both. You can tell who played on official vanilla server just how they talk or answer questions while also being a complete stuck up cunt to everyone.
---
Grats man.. feels great doesn't it!
---
Tomorrow!
---
I'm open to the idea of Classic+ instead of TBC but man I can't lie and say that TBC isn't a way superior game outside of a couple things.
---
People cleared Molten Core pre 60 with greens. You'll be fine
---
&gt;The reason I put my faith into Classic+ is that as long as they dont make the magnitude of mistakes that TBC does, I will be far happier with the final product.
---
That is a big leap of faith considering Blizzard. I'd rather take TBC over them shitting all over Vanilla/Classic's legacy.
---
To this day I have no idea how they managed to fuck up as Legion to BfA did. Worst expansion to expansion transition ever. Let's replace cool weapons with a boring fucking necklace you cant see. Let's replace cool weapon specific traits with (mostly) generic boring shared traits! Let's throw out basically everything added with legendaries, artifact traits and tier sets, then replace it with NOTHING.
---
Farms mobs with top tier expensive ammo. Lol what a moron
---
&gt;The realms with the largest alliance populations are the non PvP realms, normal realms and RP realms, meaning people who don't PvP as much.
---
I personally question whether there is a major difference in the amount of active BG'ers between PvP and PvE servers. In fact, I wager it may be higher on PvE servers, since they can't get their PvP fix otherwise. Most PvE players just don't care to get ganked or corpse camped at random, rather than not enjoying PvP in general.
---
Horde on Windseeker
---
Can someone explain this to mg like im a 10 year old?
---
That's not how the honor system works, it's based on your entire player pool, so the more people there are, the more people can get higher ranks. The more casuals there are, the easier it is for people who play frequently to get high ranks. On a server like Stalagg where the majority of the staying Alliance are tryhards, the competition for ranks will actually be enormous due to the small amount of spots available. :)
---
Improved blizzard is way more slow than coc and the point is to pull huge and AOE things down and kite them back, maybe being a douchebag is why you're still leveling and I am in full epics.
---
It is what caused the mass exodus before the transfer cutoff. It was getting bad and it didn't take much of an imagination to see how it'd be during P2 release. I feel sorry for any Alliance who stuck it out there.
---
it doesnt give 20hp5, it gives 20 health regen every 5 secs.  
---
im not trying to split hairs, its just something very specific
---
I've always found it weird how you would dedicate so much of your life to a video game (and judging by your post history, a host of other games), yet you don't understand why someone would want a tattoo of something important to them. 
---
&gt;I have enough in my life not to identify so much with a video game
---
Again, your post history clearly disproves this. Video games are a big part of your life, and I can only assume that the reason you don't want to "identify" with video games is because you think people are going to judge you negatively for being a "nerd", which I think is rather sad that an adult would let others have that much power over their lives.
---
The two alliance players are corpse camping the hundreds of horde? Oh man horde on skeram are trash then.
---
[removed]
---
Alright fair enough, still, that's only $500 a month beyond that I'm bled dry between paycheques and that's still a lot of "no's" to eating takeout or going to see any movies/buy any new game.
---
We have one kid that does bimonthly visits to downtown overnight at SickKids so the parking and stay there always throws kinks, the point is Im not drowning but I still struggle to keep the boat steady at $30 cad.
---
It’s the retail fools. It’s sooo dumb! I usually leave groups that act like idiots to new people. As a tank they get quite upset, karma is fun!
---
As someone with Druid privilege, it is my place to tell other Druids to listen to those hurt by discrimination.
---
US West, US East, EU ex Russians (sorry guys, but you know...) as 3 major main group for xbgs, why?  
---
\- solves problem of ques on lower pop realms (ye you could also match some lower pop with highest pop ones etc)  
---
\- solves que times for horde pugs vs potential higher number of alliance premades  
---
\- constant bg pops  
---
\- less dodging/trading in general
---
I've always assumed it's because alliance are the generic "good guy" cliche with humans and the other standard "good guy" races from the fantasy genre
---
so horde is just a bit more interesting.
---
That said I've been alliance this whole time. I wanted to go horde this time around but my friends insisted on alliance again lol.
---
Showing heartseeker love, for the horde!
---
Hyperbole doesn't make your point more valid. No one is reserving 5 items, it's usually one single piece of gear. Just stay away.
---
Big if true.
---
Yeah bro totally, everyone is so dumb!!11
---
Gsync doesn't need to have vsync enabled to work
---
ooo, that'd be nice.
---
I'm aware of the macros selecting actions bars. My issue is I'd need to remember to drop the new items into the slot. xD
---
Once I get Pummel, I'll probably toy around with it some more.
---
What GPU driver you have ? I had similar problem with the latest Nvidia driver using 1080 gtx. Try to download older driver from:  [https://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx) 
---
My problems went away atm using 436.48 myself.
---
You must be bad at counting.

True if big.

^turns a blind eye to class discrimination. Why should others have to take the long way!
---
Literally same thing last night. Fiancé says I’m going to bed you coming? I tell her yeah I’m tired I’m right behind you. 
---
3.5 hours later at 1:30am, falling asleep in my chair fishing after doing 2 hours before that of lasher runs and some PvP with the guild. Thankfully she was asleep still but damn this game just pulls you in

Look up the definition of a hyperbole.

Stagnation is the worst idea I've heard and will 100% not happen.
---
An extremely low effort one at that.

Draenei Shaman the only one able to fake cast vs noobs  
---
Shadowmeld drinking in arena &amp; eye picking  
---
just to point out few of tbc ally stuff, but ye in general ofc H
---
Show blizz and let them decide. I say 20=20 not 600.
---
Well reguardless V sync or or off the game still will not lock to the monitors refresh rate.
---
Why do you put such little emphasis on pvp upgrades when, at this stage at least, they are by all accounts the most important and what most players strive for.  You don't need epics to kill the bosses, but they are very desirable for pvp.
---
Drakestone, Skyshroud leggings, Lord Incendius/DMN bracers. With Stratholme Holy Water and some consumables - Skul for wand (you can scout him out with the eye). Ban'thok sash in SL.
---
Need more?
---
Gnomes are the OP alliance PVP race, Orc or Undead on Horde.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Tell me how I am wrong. Tell me why bear cloth or tiger swords are so popular then.
---
I actually tried new drivers yesterday and they brought on micro stutters so i reverted to the ones from late july 430.86 ill try that 436.48 though
---
Lol. Funny cuz it’s tru
---
maybe they wouldn’t do that if more people played tank
---
This was so annoying while leveling my hunter. Constant spam for zf farm groups, then the occasional non farming group has spots filled beforr you can even message the leader.
---
Thanks, it surely does ^^

I'm going to forget about this by next week's MC, but just did a LBRS. Here's what my damage looks like (no raid drops).
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/KkDAXix](https://imgur.com/a/KkDAXix)
---
Well considering cloth of the bear doesn’t exist, I’m gonna guess you’re wrong about a lot of things in this game.
---
I mean its the tribal leather worker teacher and like 1 quest I think? So yeah it's really pointless
---
Wont work in a full cathedral Boss room pull
---
And other big pulls. 
---
Solo @60 ZF farm its faster yes
---
Some people are cool at least. I caused a wipe on Baron, because it had been forever and I forgot the doors closed when he was engaged. They were just like "shit happens"
---
I just find it so ... interesting that many high-end jobs like banks/consultancy/law firms offer the best services (thereby efficiency) yet systematically burn out their own recruits.
---
Just give me paid transfer blizzard!! I hate thalnos server!
---
Just a heads up, on my disc priest, I tend to mana burn caster npcs and I noticed a huge jump on mana pools around 40.  So it's not that Viper Sting sucks, it's that mana pools grew faster than your ability.
---
Port to moonglade and then free flight to darn. Quick simple and free. Like putting river water in your socks
---
Yeah, probably why I hated it
---
I tried hunter for fun a few days ago and the first mob I killed dropped a red leather bag. I felt like a god
---
with that you need to press the button at least twice and check the spelling
---
first time you press the button/macro it casts NS, second time HT
---
Pretty sure that the pirate transformation from deviate delight does the same thing.
---
/u/Sykotron 's got it correct.
---
I'm waiting for your tiger weapon explanation.
---
its also annoying as shit to tank they disarm and charge and stun then you have the mobs on undead that you need to keep aoe threat on not to mention the pats that roam and randomly knock back and drop aggro.
---
is the main reason tanks ask for orbs is because it the least fun dungeon to tank and you have zero reason for being there.
---
Holy Molly!
---
Pigs are great, nice and tanks and charge is great for a nice aggro surge
---
Literally just bought them for about 110g on Pagle for my DPS set, not too bad.
---
If more horde transfer over from stalagg to heartseeker then it wouldn’t be that bad. It’s already getting fairly decent.
---
as someone that regularly found this list pretty bad i'm pretty sure htey did some updates and it's mostly good atm, just some "optional" choices that could be places in best but that's about it.
---
Meh, I knew a ton of people on p servers who were cool. You just dont notice them as much. Some people are just assholes.
---
I played on both, and I saw a lot of the exact same type of people i see now or remember back in vanilla. People just forget how awful a ton of wow players were back in the day.
---

---
Ok so going to 436.38 has my Gsync locked in again. Though im skeptical as trying the newest driver also did this yesterday but the problem reappeared later. Anyways I appreciate it.
---
They are banking on finding healers who needs the quest or onyxia atunement etc is my guess
---
Hey you remind me of the Hunter I met last night who told me this 1.5speed bow was a huge upgrade because it's dps tooltip said so. People need to take 2minutes out of their day to self inform themselves. It hurts my brain that these are the typical guys you are forced to pug with.
---
But mats from the AH.  The time saved is huge.  You can either give out low level enchants to low players for free or just grab a crap shield, bracer, boots, and gloves and go nuts.
---
"For the Horde!" sounds cool and rebellious imo, while "For the Alliance!" sounds off. I'd prefer if they were different
---
The arguments against loot council are 'but players are toxic and it's unfair, but fail to acknowledge that guilds like that are also the ones who would abuse/collude DKP or even rolling systems.
---
Everything can be abused. There will always be people bullying/buying/colluding.
---
Get yourself a guild where you are friendly and mature with classmates and officers, respect that MC is terrible for gearing, and just enjoy raiding together with loot as a bonus. Then LC is absolutely perfect because it considers what's needed, what's deserved and what's charitable and fair.
---
Dire Maul West is my least favorite.  Every mob has some AoE mechanic, or hits like a truck.  Scholo and Sunken Temple are easy by comparison.
---
You really gonna compare a feral dps rotation in bfa to classic and say it's dumbed down?
---
Yeah I know about guides but they pretty much focuse on leveling enchating during leveling your character.
---
Not saying give, take away perception because it's useless.
---
Yes.
---
I have 441 Frost damage with no hit gear atm, I replaced my only two hit pieces with the Choker of the fire lord and the MIC. But I’m Specced Into EP, with 9% crit.

Tbf, the fact that BGs are cross server took away like the only reason to be on a low pop side of a server.
---
Sounds like a win to me
---
Blizzard can only delay the inbalance - not stop it because players will cause it. Ppl say they want a 50/50 server, but they really dont.
---
Benediction is pretty balanced too
---
Druid plus the stun/herbalism racial is what does it for me. I also cant resist the cow puns whenever I make a Tauren.
---
You sure can!
---
Doesn't Blast Wave still give fire a way to apply AoE slows?
---
I don't really understand the thing about flying ruining the game in tbc. The concept wasn't great, but it didn't destroyed the game by any means.
---
It's funny that you state that because my Resto shaman (deep resto 0/11/39) can't farm for shit, I have about no way to compete for plants with world pvp due to my lack of damage and when there's no mage I have to pay for about 80 water per dungeon + I wear Mail so my repair bill is quite high too.  
---
I'm about 99% sure Prot warriors with a 2h sword can farm more effectively than me.
---
So who's compensating me for playing a useless class outside of a Raid ? Can I and Should I ask for ALL orbs when I create the group ?
---
Honestly I just don't see the difference except that warrior bring nothing except their presence to a group. No buff, nothing.
---
Moonfire spam is quite nasty too against hunters, since you're chipping away in their blind spot. It's an overkill tactic, but it's funny.
---
which pieces are wrong?
---
Once you reach level 30 you will unlock feign death. Make a macro that casts feign death and lays a freezing trap. You will never have to worry about melee again.
---
HEY THATS ME
---
Ours isn't like this, but only because we closed any recruitment of rogues after we had 10 rogues.
---
yeah aoe grouping for SM and ZF definitely did a thing for mage reputation
---
Yeah all I did as a warrior was lead the pack to a suitable location to start AoE and then just get out of the way and taunt loose mobs back into the crowd.
---
Man this would really change everything. People are gonna whine either way but this would be so good for the long term health of the game. Let’s hope blizzard is listening
---
Moral of the story for these comments, start your own group lmao. You get into the dungeon faster anyways, unless u get lucky and see a message in world or lfg.
---
One time I wanted to level my priest and I figured if I got really drunk I would wake up with a leveled up priest. Instead I was just dead in a canyon when I logged on the next day
---
Faction was always an issue in mostly all expansion, its worst in classic because of the class exclusivity.
---
Run Beast Mastery spec. Wing clip, wing clip, and wing clip!Try to keep a freezing trap down at all times while questing (this is helpful for getting jumped or pulling too much). Track humans, this keeps you aware of who is around you (note that druids in animal form and shamans in ghost wolf won’t human track). And throw out a concussive shot, keep that distance and kite!
---
Whoa how do you keep track of having multiple versions of a spell on hand at a time?
---
at least u didnt say "Ding"
---
as i see it if i have no reason to run the content give me one. paying is pretty straight forward however things like you get all the greens feels to a player more natural as they are also there for loot.
---
Does the Tempest Talisman's 1% spell crit applies to heals as well? Because if it does, it'd be great for my holy paladin :)
---
This is false.   
---
Claw is an instant attack that deals static damage. The pets attack speed does not matter.  
---
Bite is an instant attack that deals static damage. It is more focus efficient than claw but has a cool down. The pets attack speed does not matter.
---
Currently leveling a rogue after maining a mage. Im really fucking missing out in these class fantasies with class quests. Will definitely level a lock in P2.
---
Mage, a wand and polymorph skin? Garbage. 
---
Rogue, lockpicking and poisons were cool(tbh quite boring). The ravenholdt manor quest was really nice but having the experience as the reward doesnt cut it for me.
---
Locks? Goddamn im jealous of all the demons, mounts, sacrificial summoning ritual you guys unlock. Adds a lot of flavor to the leveling whereas and the other 2 classes i played i just wanted to get to 60 and get it over with. You get a really nice hat at 30 too.
---
I dont think this is correct at all. Im usually 1 of 2 to 5 alli in a zone, whereas there are literally hordes of horde
---
But you could also lose that roll later and leave with nothing. Or have the shitty shoulders and not have to waste a roll on them next time.
---
Either way, no one is giving any alternatives to PUG groups, only “+1 sucks”.  You can’t use DKP or LC so what are the other options? Curious because I might start using them if they are perfect and everyone comes out feeling happy.
---
Dpsing as a healer got more and more common in WoW as the expansions got on. I would say it's never been required but it's not a foreign concept.
---
HAH! I had no idea why you were there but I enjoyed ganking you guys inbetween your high lvl friend killing me.
---
warrior is like 25% of every server, hunter is often the lowest pop class after druid
---
Levelling my mage up right now and I'm almost level 22. Can't wait to start attempting the AoE grind, while most people are still gearing up their 60s. Should be somewhat peaceful, I hope.
---
This^ Right now, for locks at least, don't know about mages too much. Spell damage is absolutely king. There's simply not enough hit and crit available in the items right now to make up the DPS differential. 
---
As more heavily statted items drop, hit will slowly become the king stat with spellpower then crit following behind.
---
Could you explain the -5/10 system? Never heard of it. Is it the best option for PUGs?
---
I mean if it’s zf you should be soloing it unless you’re incompetent
---
Cats have a similar aggro surge with their first attack out of Prowl.
---
Ah okay my bad
---
Did not know
---
the other difference is that this happened 15 years ago. Back then Blizzard was still Blizzard.
---
I can tell you for sure they did not punch anyone to death. Most of what I saw was a lvl 30-ish Gnome Mage killing people who tagged to kill the lvl 2s who were dying inbetween Thunder Kodos and Raptors.
---
My overall point is you need a group to get the drop, the group can decide what rules it follows. 
---
yes, that's the whole issue.
---
The question is "what is the best way to minimise ninja's?" when no one talks about the loot rules beforehand. The answer is everyone needs.
---
I got a transmute: undeath to water from one :3
---
Thank you!!
---
I don't like the races on ally as much as horde. There's not really another reason. On retail I play both because my favourite ally race draenei was added in bc
---
Agreed, however usually the best predictable price spike on consumables happens before/during raids. I find posting around 5-8PM on Tuesday’s and Thursday’s nets the most profit.
---
But the core problem remains - no matter how players get shuffled around. If one sever is 50/50 balance it just means others will be more unbalanced, because more people want to play PVP servers as horde. This is not a fact that can be wished away by moving players. 
---
Have blizzard made it worse by how they've tried to address it? Probably. Maybe the best solution would have been to do nothing and have players adapt to insane queues or quit. But whether they do faction xfers or free-for-all xfers...a large bunch of players are going to complain and feel absolutely fucked over. Targeted xfers are not a solution because it unfairly traps minority factions players on the 'broken' realm. There is no solution, blizzard cannot fix a gigantic player-made problem.
---
2:1 isn't a healthy server either. That's 67% of the population on one side and still feels shitty when you're on the 33% side.
---
Lol kirtonos is perfect for alliance, we will be able to farm honor quick and and have rlly good q time for bg.
---
thats wierd than more ppl want to play horde because almost every single pserver there was since nost had alliance majority like 65-35 so horde never had bg queues
---
On the bright side you can use its farming potential to subsidize a reroll through potions, stat food, 225 first aid for heavy runecloth, greens/boes, enchants, paid dungeon runs, buying tradeable quest drops, etc
---
Right now I'm leveling a mage alt (warrior main) solely for that purpose
---
That's what I did but I still couldnt purchase the card. I contacted the GM and they resolved the issue
---
The best server!
---
First couple weeks were great, then plateaued and it’s taken about a year to get the amount i take along with how often i take it to a good spot where my numbers were good...slow process...but worth it.
---
How do you counter a pet to the point it's irrelevant?
---
Suck it up and buy the mats. It's not cheap. Also Smoking Heart isnt bis. 
---
 I'd still craft it as the mitigation is nice, but Mark of the Chosen and Mark of Tyranny are statistically better overall, and in phase 3 Drake Fang Talisman is a major item you should be trying to get as it's a great threat piece
---
Also feint is amazing
---
I don't know why that might be (possibly a much higher pve focus on pservers - therefore paladins/fearward/5% int on mages etc), but what limited data we have for classic is that horde dominate pvp server populations. Just moving them around between servers in no way fixes the fact that there are a fuck load more of them collectively.
---
Take your money elsewhere. Blizzard doesn't deserve it.
---
How do you know he conned anyone? That’s an assumption, maybe he’s the MT and has been running MC quickly after release? Maybe his raid rewards him for being a good MT and gave him HoR because he had the gold to fund the build? Being salty because he has better gear than you do is a shitty mentality.
---
It only works if another account takes the name. Can't do it yourself.
---
Anecdotal
---
That’s usually because 1 person is paying the tank, and if u pay in greens the whole run is paying making it cheaper to the person paying
---
They wanted the classic experience..
---
Why do people think a 60/40 split is fine? That means one side has 50% more people on it.
---
Healing BiS is really fluid. It depends on your raid and personal playstyle to a degree.

Here's a solid list of alternatives for every slot
---
What server is that? I’d take you up on that offer. I’m in Fairbanks Horde.
---
Hunters can fd 80% of wipes so they shouldn't have near the repair
---
Class fantasy for demonology is probably at its best ever in current wow, but the class itself has lost some RP flavor over time.
---
You aren’t the sharpest
---
Thanks for sending me that and not just posting a link I’ve already been to :)
---
I couldn't have described.the Skeram Horde any better! Well done.
---
Hunter or Priest doesnt feel much better..
---
Balanced is where one side has 50% more players than the other? Yea, balanced.
---
I only have this FP as alliance because a quest from stonetalon told me to talk to the guy at Thalanar  . That was at level \~30, so pretty pointless :/
---
Yes, 3 Horde for every 2 alliance. Which is still not as bad as the 70/30 and 80/20 servers some are mentioning in this thread
---
Yes +spell crit gear applies to both healing and damaging spells.
---
I read this chain of comments and immediately went to my computer to install the addon

I feel so bad for those pets you tame for the bite/claw ranks lmao. I treat them like fucking garbage.
---
Was that within the first week or so when there'd have been loads of people in the starting zone and more "hands on deck" to deal with launch?
---
We use this too. The problem is 7 warriors put onslaught girdle as #1 so who gets it? Still gotta be a council discussion, or /roll
---
I got booted from a group because I had 2m left on my res sickness when I arrived at the dungeon.
---
Well given that for any pve encounter you can make a strictly optimized set of gear, prebis is a real thing regardless of your feelings
---
Like I said, it’s a /roll for anyone with the current priority.

Just because it was upheld does not mean he was botting.

---
^true. I host  a mc pug every week. I don’t check gear, I invite all specs and we down Rag every time (it does help that I am a well geared tank).
---
But I don’t think MC is nerfed. Player base is just better. In true classic we were all running around in class sets like we were hot shit. Now we know better.
---
Join a guild
---
Was just this past week. Funny thing is I think I only saw like 3 people the entire time.
---
We get it, you bashed retail for karma.
---
Blizzard are cheap ass cost cutters. They can't pay for servers let alone GMs. Bobby Kotick needs a bigger bonus.
---
Pretty sure the way tribute works is there is 3 items in the tribute to start with, every boss you kill takes 1 blue item out of the chest. So of you kill a guard you lose a blue, kill kromcrush lose a second blue, kill the observer and now there no blues in the tribute.
---
And in my experience your best bet is getting friends or guildies to help and just killing kromcrush on a tribute run and losing a blue.
---
r/sweden would love this post
---
Just to get some of low hanging fruit comments:  
---
Why are you posting this?  
---
No one cares  
---
No one cares about these guys
---
Who are these guys  
---
What is twitch  
---
Why should i care
---
I noticed the big skeleton costume made mobs (at least in duskwood) fear you when they hit you decreasing their attack and speed. AND you can breath underwater.
---
Account sharing would be a different suspension message entirely though. So it's not related to that at all.
---
You say tbc is the worst option, why couldn't they do tbc + after tbc ? With like removing the flying mount and other feature that people don't like.
---
 Going from classic to classic +, Blizzard have a shit load of thing to fix, they need to bring back all the class  or build that are not viable to a viable state for both pvp and pve. While TBC is way more balance in all those aspect.

---
Do you play a PvP server?
---
Yes
---
I don't even get how you're meant to play a shaman without an addon to put all of your action bars on the screen. My shaman is only 38 and I've only got like 4 free spots left out of the main action bar + all the extra ones
---
Max rank is E
---
Rank 4 is shift+E
---
Rank 1 is alt+E
---
Easy
---
Yes, yes, yes and yes again!
---
You literally said fuck them on their forum. Are you suprised about the ban? If you are hear trying to convince us you meant forget them. Then you would wrote forget and not F. Can we get an F in the chat for this F'in guy?
---
It can crit for around 3k. Whether it's worth the trinket slot as a mage I can't say but I know as a lock when i get a fear off put my dots and use the death Ray if it crits they are dead.
---
I think 1/2 Martyrdom is better than 1/5 Silent Resolve. Also, Spirit of Redemption is optional, taking 1 point out of Spiritual Guidance. It's buggy though, and I only seem to get about 8 seconds of casts out of it rather than the 10 seconds it advertises.
---
Of course.  
---
  
---
My whole issue is the rank bleeding, where you're flat out punished for missing any time on the game. I'm not above putting in the work, or making it so that your skill is rewarded - but the endurance test is a stupid concept, and it's unsurprising that it was scrapped by the first Xpack.
---
Thats possible? nice
---
That's kinda weird but Tank still lose threat from ony's cleave in P3, and cause it's a percentage he can lose a lot.
---
True, I’m not saying I’m opposed to wpvp. But getting ganked by 60s while leveling as the worst leveling class in the game doesn’t seem all that appealing.
---
I prefer faction semi-balance as opposed to just 1 faction present. It makes the world seem more lively.
---
Are you healing?
---
The difference is the number of tanks vs number of healers. You in theory could ask for compensation to heal, but everyone could find another healer within 2 minutes who will do it for free. With Strat Live for example, I think it’s safe to say no PUG tank will go there for free, so it’s either pay a tank or don’t do the dungeon.
---
The funny thing about this is that I consider myself a pretty stringent min/maxer and there is a 0% chance I would kick your guildy. 
---
Let's say that his inability to find the location increases the odds that he is a horrible DPSer by some small but real amount. I then need to contrast that downside with the downside of kicking him: some amount of time it will take to find a new member for the group, and potential "burned bridges" for future group making. Under almost all conditions, the loss-minimizing choice is to roll the dice with your friend, because the additional time it would take to replace him alone is likely higher than the time cost associated with some marginal increase in wipe probability.
---
Accurate.
---
Shaman. And trolls.
---
Wtf, had no clue this could happen.
---
For someone who plays as much as Jokerd and AOE farms as much as Jokerd. I'd say ya it's worth.
---
And buff. Lots and lots of buffs.
---
Finding tanks for strat live is difficult, I find it hard to believe you couldn't get a group for it unless you have a reputation...
---
What about boat to menethil and boat to darkshore and free flight to rutheran
---
I mean sure, I did it a bit in WoD. But in FFXIV it was actually required to kill the boss pre enrage.

---
So tonight we were discussing the drop rate on Barons bindings for our 2nd and then this happened
---
Nope I do this all the time when I farm Mara on my lock. Just be careful not to go over the 5 resets in an hour or when you log back into your hunter you may find him in IF or wherever your hearth is set.
---
They don't have GMs like they used to anymore, nearly 95% of problems in game can be automated, including things like name reporting, enough people report a name and it flags for name change
---
I see hunters with racist pet names all the time, hell the same guy has been spamming Westfall with the "N" word for like 4 days straight and he hasn't been banned, but if enough people report it he will get in trouble.
---
If flying is and issue they can remove it in tbc + and resilience is not an issue, its just like retail, you want to be good at something invest the time in the thing you like, what i hate about classic is people that focus on raiding can just come into the bg and destroy people because the gear in pve is better then the pvp gear.
---
perfect, very thanks sir
---
Nope they get temp suspensions for account sharing aka  "Unauthorized Account Access ". They were false flags but completely different to your case.
---
No changes.
---
That does make sense since Hunter class quests pretty much stop at level 10 with the pet. Kind of sucks, but I love me hunters.
---
God, I have to be in bed by 8 to be at work for 7 :(
---
I think it depends on your professions. If your a miner DM east is unquestionably the better gold farm spot thanks to the arcane crystals. If your not a miner I think Mara and DM east are about on par gold wise with Mara being much more consistent and DM east being more hit or miss.
---
I never have trouble finding groups on my hunter. But it might be people recognizing me as that drunk guy with a crab and they just wanna party
---
The thing you describe is retail gearing in a nutshell. So I dunno why you say the retail mentality ruins the game while at the same time you're praising that you get some best pvp gear from pve and some of the best pve gear from pve(which is the case in retail). 
---
You seem confused to what you want. Classic is the opposite, you get everything from raids or engineering. Nothing of worth from PvP aside from in Phase 2 where High Warlord/Grand Marshal gear will be better than some BiS from raid.
---
Arena aged badly, because the game was always balance around pve and not pvp.
---
Hmm we also had 2 Ony bags drop last night which I've never heard of before.
---
I'm not excited for PvP ranks without PvP objectives.
---
Asskandy all the way
---
Grobbulus (RP-PVP, West coast) is quite active and has a very balanced population.
---
So sad we have to specify "working person" in this community to imply we have no way to be competitive

There's no button to make her hair match yours, though. Maybe you weren't wrong? 
---
Honestly I made my alt a woman because none of the guy hairstyles are even close to okay. Had to rock that updo, the human female messy bun is 10/10
---
Working yes, but 3-4 hrs a day. Keep in mind you only need rank 8 for a majority of pvp gear, and gear from bwl/ony shits on the blue pvp set for most classes
---
I don't think that's what he's implying.  Rather that there are items one can use that might be 3rd, 4th, 5th from the BIS, and still technically upgrades over quest greens and older blues.
---
I too assume someone is playing retail when told there's no chance they're playing the retail expansion
---
My guild had back to back ony kills with 2 bags. Wierd
---
Finkle is Einhorn.. Einhorn is Finkle!
---
Why would a shaman be the only one rolling on it?  It's just as BiS for warriors in PvP.
---
Ah yeah, I forgot. The speed bonus on quivers is nice though.
---
Anybody else think they are going to drop Warsong or AV early due to the shitshow the servers are going to end up being for w-pvp after a week or so?
---
I think it would be mainly in an attempt to get "give both crowds" what they want, W-PVP and BG stylewise... 
---
Im on Skeram, and we got like a 9-1 Horde to Ally population balance, and the FREE server xfers dont help when they are open to the faction that has less people... Kinda screws over those on the other side and THEIR SIDE they leave behind.
---
ok boomer
---
This is exactly the opposite of what they do. They give you the quickest way to level a profession. Enchanting isn't cheap to level, so if you didn't DE stuff while you leveled you are going to have to buy a bunch of mats.
---
What?  If you are going to PvP then you would take ZERO skills in prot.
---
ooc rage decay is -3 rage/second so the tool tip does read correctly in that you always generate +1 rage/second turning your decay into -2 rage/second ooc.
---
Im criticisng your "PvP" build because you wasted 13 points on stupid crap that won't help you.  The damage output reduction compared to the damage incoming reduction is completely mute in PvP as DEFENSE (where you wasted 5 skill points for +10 defense LOL) does nothing against another player and is a completely worthless talent in PvE also.
---
It's like you've never played a warrior in either PvP or PvE at a high level.  Your build is total rubbish and you don't seem to grasp what the talents you're picking actually do and how it relates to the situation you are speccing for. 
---
Overall, I rate this a: 0/10 would never spec it's total trash.  Sucks at PvP.  Sucks at solo PvE.  Sucks at group PvE.  Sucks at raid PvE.
---
I honestly can't remember a time when the highest available rank of viper sting did more than half the bar at any time during leveling. I basically stopped using it entirely when it was like 1/3rd from the growth you talk of.

---
The alliance are all stuck up asshiles who think they're better than any other humanoid races.
---
The horde at least actively tries to establish peace among races.
---
Read the alliance tooltip when creating a character
---
"Bound together by their shared hatred of all things demonic."
---
Then they have warlocks lol.
---
We do this too on US servers. If anyone responds Florida we get ready for a wild ride!
---
If you don’t enjoy what you’re playing you won’t play it. Pick the rogue!
---
Even then I wont join any group after my "run" today. Reserving shit and playing like shit and causes the whole group to wipe. "YEAH LETS RESERVE A ITEM CAUSE I AM SHIT SO I CAN PAY MY BILLS CAUSE I AM SHIT!"
---
When you reserve something for you and you will act like a tank, atleast try it ffs. Shild+1H doesnt mean the mobs will stick to you!
---
1-2 Orb on average, don't expect preference because you plan to use them. Everyone will need/greed them so it's all luck.
---
If they can do that and make better itemization like tbc and make class viable again and remove flying mount, change pvp system in classic and make pvp gear more relevant in pvp, i am down for that change.
---
Its not just that. None of the successful PvP games are team deathmatch.  The genre moved to battle royales and MobAs.
---
Not if you’re pee shy 😬...
---
You may get temp banned or not. Either may dc during a boss fight to get it changed.
---
Hey man. I got some hot hands when it comes to the dice.
---
Np we forgive you
---
Resto followed by feral for raiding. Druid tanking isn't bad if warrior tanking is 100% optimal bear tanking would be like 87-93% optimal imo, so not terrible bad but the difference is definitely noticable.
---
Free roll, MS &gt; OS. 
---
It's simple and fair, and doesn't make anyone feel like they got their 1 item from Lucifron and not care for the rest of the raid. Either that or Split the +1 loot tables separately for the Elementals, for the Flamelashes, for Domo, and for Rag, but that's more or less the same.
---
aye!
---
awh yeah!
---
If you're ok with using addons, go to the Twitch app and download Gathermate2, and in the search results for it there should be ones that say Gathermate2 data as well. Get the data too. Once you have Gathermate2 installed, select it from interface options and select import. You now have the location of 99% of the herbs in the game displayed on your map.
---
Yeah I know, But I doubt that when I go to a random mage in IF and ask them for lets say 120 water cause my friend also need some water. I doubt that he will give it for free to me. So yeah even water costs some gold in this game!
---
And yes I just had 2 runs without a mage, lucky me I had some water left from the run before.
---
Not gonna lie one of the most infuriatingly petty things in video games is the lack of long hair for male characters

---
You never see anything like what you'd find dudes wearing at a heavy metal concert or like what Chris Hemsworth had in the early marvel movies
---
It's all fucking manbuns, pigtails, fauxhawks, and undercuts nowadays
---
My feeling is that *generally* Horde attracts more intense, I'm-gonna-fuck-things-up personality types. This shares some characteristics with "gang" mentality, thus they work in packs/gangs and enjoy displaying their affiliation.
---
At once per run it takes 20 runs on average. At twice per run it takes 10 runs. In my experience everyone needs or everyone greeds.
---
Yeah sure, when someone says I need the holy water pls can I get the boxes, we let him get it for sure. And if mana pots are in it, they get to the healer in 9/10 cases.
---
But it introduce better itemization, better class balance, more viable spec, better raid. There is bad thing in tbc but there is also good thing in tbc.
---
Where's the stat for that? Not doubting you, I'm just doubting you
---
Always innervate the boomkin. They deserve it cause they get so much hate
---
If you mean in Wrath launch, I thought he was only rolled back and the mobs had exp removed. Or was there something he did in Cata launch too (iirc he did some then too but can’t remember)
---
Good luck mate. I ended up buying my last two. They were only 13-15 or so on my server so it was an easy choice (35 or so now).
---
"Alright. I have exactly 2 minutes and 46 seconds to pee, get a drink, and pet the dog." Now which ones do I really need to do..

How did you level from 50 up? I'm in the exact same situation as you lol, I'm level 50. Did you just grind/quest your way up? I'm new and really hit a wall at level 50, and my level 60 buds just refuse to help me :(

Next week Phase 2 will go live. This will mean that city raids are very unlikely to happen anymore as dishonourable kills can remove a lot of progress. We would like to end Phase 1 with a bang, meaning one final HUGE raid on Orgrimmar, this coming Saturday (9/11) at 20:00. Everyone is invited, let's show the Horde they should fear us (or we break the server, that's cool too). Dear Horde, we know you are reading this; see you at the gates.
---
No kirtonos transfer and the addition of world honor pvp. I think im done paying for this game
---
I like the idea, but your bot lacks context.
---
So you think I should run a dungeon that I need nothing from, so that you can get the gear you want? There is definitely some entitlement here, that's for sure.
---
I went to made a new an alt account the other day and when I subbed I wondered why my price was in Euros. Now when I order pizza the price shows up in pounds sterling (I'm Canadian, we use $) so I looked up in Google why this might be happening. No helpful answer, so I buy the subscription anyway and go to log on, no go I don't have a EU account. I to a huge facepalm, and sub NA and put in a ticket to get my EU money back on account of dumbassery, the lovely people at Blizzard refunded me my euros and now I have an account for my 6 year old, he dinged LVL 3 today.
---
I prefer the horse aesthetic way more. I love the wilds and camps and rag tag survival settlement as compared to big cities and castles.
---
I've done +1 where it reset at Domo so everyone had an option to roll on rag loot no matter what.
---
we are specifically looking for 2-3 more rogues lol
---
Because "fire" is superior in aoe with master of elements 
---
Frost nova -&gt; flamestrike + CoC -&gt; AE

Are lots of glancing blows from weapon skill being too low?
---
Lmao item levels not in vanilla wow
---
Does importing custom art still work? Mine just shows up as a bright green box even when I type the directory correctly
---
Thats a good idea level 12 probably isnt a good representation of the class as a whole
---
Counterpoints?
---
No changes.....
---
Can horde get it or no?
---
Ohh, try being on the de facto Bulgarian server when BGs were added.  
---
Was lots of fun!
---
I can't think of any good rea$ons
---
We do +1 but boe drops don't count to your +1. Don't think this alone is what keeps people in to the end of the raid but I've never had problems with people leaving after winning there item.
---
Priest fear, burn hunter. Mage root/poly, burn hunter. Warlock fear on pet or hunter, burn hunter. Or at least I figure it would be something like that, not big into PvP
---
Ok buddy
---
Lol no we don’t
---
First off GFYS.  Second of all “participating” in raid by being in greens and doing less work before hand (getting bis/ having pots/reagents) is not an excuse for getting free rolls over people who actually put the time and effort in to being geared beforehand as much as possible.  I guess the new generation is all about being handed gear for zero work but I’m not.   I won’t be wasting anymore time farming pots/gold for a raid I don’t get anything out of.
---
I main healed it with like 15-20 in the raid and it was fine.
---
get the ghost one and just walk on water..
---
Lmao. 
---
Imagine wanting priority for server transfers after taking advantage of the 3x1 ratio for so long. 
---
Sorry buddy. You can’t have your cake and eat it too.
---
This^^^ theres plenty of LC guilds out there. Just throw a rock and youll hit six
---
In my guild we have 2, soon 3 running raids.
---
For onyxia we do open rolls, but we keep it tidy, head went to tanks first, then the rest of the physical dps due to bis.
---
For MC we run it like this: 
---
You get to win 2 rolls, and you can have 1 soft reserve outside of that.
---
If you win 2 items, you can only roll for your soft reserve.
---
If two players have the same reaerve they get to roll against each other, nobody else. 
---
BoE does not count towards this. 
---
I think this system is pretty fair.
---
Lock is supposed to pull the whole instance with shielded eye of killrogg
---
Blood elves are the more humanoid looking race, and they quickly became 1/3rd of the horde population.

I would actually love to do that with those kids.
---
Ive literally never had a single guy complain, I rolled on "fury", or "arms" gear, and ive had ppl complain a lot about stuff. Besides, being protection is a crudge, and far worse at tanking dungeons than fury or arms, if geared. Bc guess what, ppl realize you are, infact, not protection, just because you tank a dungeon.
---
I have a hard time understanding that you have been unhappy, yet you stay in the guild?
---
2 pieces of loot is the problem in my guild, especially with there being a revolving door of people coming in and winning gear they didn’t earn imo.  I’m tired of it and I’m doing the least amount from here on... no more helping people get gear or paying for pots like I’ve been doing because what’s the point?
---
Why the fuck would they come to the raid if they can't get gear LOL.  Additionally if you could fill the raid without them why aren't you?
---
Yes, but those resources are not gained through primary professions. I guess I worded it wrong.
---
I agree for flying mount, resilience was a way to prevent pve to stomp the people who was mostly only playing to do pvp. Shaman and paladin was fine for both faction it i don't really understand the issue hear, give the people to choose which side the like the most. For outland sure spliting the population, but classic+ will split more the population too. New level cap i don't really mind. For me 10/25 man raid is better then 40 men which is a fucking shit show to organize. Arena is a nice pvp system, but the fact that you could only get the best gear throught arena was bad.
---
 But tbc bring better itemization, better balance for each spec making more build viable. Better raid, better dungeon, better talent tree
---
Depends on the type of spell, dots and direct heals or instant heals have different coefficient.
---
Whats warchiefs blessing and rally cry of the dragonslayer?
---
It should be a DKP System so you get gear based on time spent in raids not just because you just showed up.
---
Not at first. I think server exclusive battleground says a lot about server identity. I love recognizing players. Cross-server bullshit is a part of retail I loathe.
---
Instead of getting all passive aggressive and complaining to people on reddit how about you just /gquit?   
---
You don't like rolling for loot? Find a guild that doesn't do that. It's not rocket science.
---
I kind of "live under a rock", so even if it were a well known idiom here I might not know it. Judging by the urban dictionary page, you're probably right.
---
Doh, yep wrong Shield move!
---
In my opinion, if a tank is charging for services, they shouldn’t be rolling on gear.  That puts them in the need of the group on top of possibly being undergeared.  Nothing wrong with being undergeared in an instance, but you can’t have a premium for it.  I’ll accept the first orb to tank on a live run (if I’ve been searching a while) but when they try to get greedy I’ll leave.
---
Start your own guild
---
Hell yeah! :D
---
Yeah, if your casters stand on the roof you can avoid skeletons aggroing them. Otherwise you need 15 probably.
---
To celebrate hitting 60 I leveled fishing with an rl friend and every time we fished rum out we drank, you konda make your own fun
---
&gt;Meh, I knew a ton of people on p servers who were cool. You just dont notice them as much. Some people are just assholes
---
I think it's that the assholes are the ones who will make sure you KNOW they played on a private server.
---
Getting it resisted anyway because you're fighting an orc is hilarious.
---
The first film was so good
---
Looks like you looted 3 bags from your mail after looting 1 coffer key and 3 lockboxes..
---
Atlasloot has all the drops for all 6 phases, with a badge over what phase they unlock in.
---
I really hope his name is "Illegal".
---
There are some things the game does to help casual players. Weekly raid resets limit the speed at which hardcore players can gear up, allowing casual players to somewhat keep up. But hardcore players need stuff to work towards too. If the people who play for ten hours a day, seven days a week, get all the rewards immediately, they will get bored and leave. Accepting that some things in the game simply won't be attainable to me is a hard pull to swallow. But in the long run, it doesn't make a huge difference.
---
That is very very true. But that's one instance of an item you might struggle to obtain, there are plenty for mages as well. In the end, as many other comments/posts would say. Just play what you like. Gear will come eventually regardless and it's a better sense of satisfaction on a class you love the feel of :)
---
Whoa. You can solo skul? Do tell. I guess I should look it up on YouTube...
---
Because i dont want to...
---
Thats such a fucking stupid suggestion
---
I didn't even get it at first. Asking where someone's from is just way more common. If they answered 'Ele' I would be racking my brain trying to figure out which country or city that is.
---
In your own home?
---
Please take this for what it is worth. It shows that people are curious and want to play Classic. It does not show that a HUGE amount of money WILL BE made. It is a good sign but not ZOMG.  
---
Activision reports its quarterly numbers and generally report/define all COMPANIES by MAUs (Monthly Active Users). They then highlight specifics per games per game. These number represent options for advertisements as well as sometime represent actual monthly income. EX: Blizzard had 33 Million MAUs (Includes WoW, Diablo, Hearthstone, Overwatch).  
---
The exact words from the quarterly report are the following:  
---
World of Warcraft® Classic drove the biggest quarterly increase to subscription plans in franchise history, in both the West and East.
---
Everyone’s watching 😰
---
What will happen with devilsaur leather in phase 2 with no layering? Will prices rise because of competition or will devilsaur parts be useless with pvp gear being implemented?
---
no sap opener / totem stomp from the rogue, yikes
---
Yes they are. It's just not shown without an addon displaying it.
---
Having them on the screen was never a problem.   
---
Having them all bound is a real problem though. You're easily up to 50+ keybinds.
---
 No server is 9-1 or every has been, they were about 6-4 and then first wave came in making it 7-3, second wave made it close to 8-2. Its just being selfish and being a hypocrite to leave to another realm because you are out numbered. So now we make two severs that are extremely imbalanced vs 2 semi imbalanced servers. Its funny because they introduced more realms for queue times, but you want to leave because of a semi imbalanced realm.
---
I know. I was pointing out that he believed that.
---
If you're being honest then you can fight it. If you're lying though, stop. You wont win. They can prove it so easily. You'll never get them to turn it over if you're lying.
---
But keep going  after them. Don't relent. Ask for them to show you when you used such programs. Demand to talk to a higher up. Ask for a phone number to call. Don't give up.
---
It's fake mon. https://youtu.be/mb_6UOAj_D0
---
Zero Sum DKP with set prices is the best one I've encountered so far.  Seems fair and, with decay, incentives people to bid constantly instead of hoarding.
---
Very well said :D
---
You sound like a salty little bitch trying to make this about your class "being the hardest". We get it, you push buttons in dungeons, so does everyone else.
---
Ahh Boomkin, joining the likes of Ret pally and shadowpreists between the dead rogue and the tanks.
---
1. Play Horde
---
2. Ret pallies do not get to bid on onslaught girdle until the all fury wars get it. Some classes get screwed but that’s a game design issue really.
---
I’m not the only one who isn’t happy but nobody will say anything because they will just quit taking you.  I’m over it and handing out gear to idiots who can’t be bothered to farm their bis will dunk this guild in later raids
---
They are ALL from Sweden, except for the slav that asked
---
Because some people are fuckin weird and they’ll whisper you because they don’t understand economics.
---
That’s a pretty good deal for the group.
---
Item Level DOES exist in vanilla, it's just not visible unless you use an addon to show extra item info.
---
Good bot
---
The genre killed itself when it devolved into rush mechanics.
---
Seems balanced
---
If you’re maintanking it, your lack of gear is hurting the raid.
---
World of Warcraft sucks if you don’t play with friends. Matters not what class or spec you are. With friends this game makes sense. You just need to stop pugging and make some connections. It’s actually not so different from real life which is unsurprising since you’re dealing with real people.
---
People who like to kill others tend to identify with monsters more
---
At lvl 39 Scarlet monetary is still very relevant for you. Especially Armory is a warriors dream place.
---
It's like they learned nothing from HOTS.
---
I generally farm my own herbs as I'm doing quests etc, and just turn them into potions to sell. I've also found buying ghost mushrooms and crafting elixir of shadow powers to be a good money maker, as they're used in the warlock epic mount quest. 
---
If you have the greater fire resistance potion recipe, that has been an amazing money maker for me. &lt; 1g per each elemental fire and dreamfoil and I sell them routinely for &gt; 4g.
---
Arcanite transmutes are also a good passive money maker, usually around 10g per, sometimes more or less depending on how much I pay for the crystal. 
---
Best of luck!
---
I'm on stalagg. Raid nights Ally have brm on lockdown. What's the problem?
---
They're not even close to saturating their servers. It's players athat are congregating that are causing issues, not their plan.
---
You clearly don’t pay attention then, the server is about 75% horde. Atleast. When people have a motive to a be out for blood, the game will be unplayable for one faction
---
We had Dlb Ony Bags 3 weeks ago... our FIRST 2 kills we had DOUBLE DOUBLE Stormrager helms... only 2 shammys in guild :(
---
Not sure if you are arguing at me. 2x is probably not the extent of what they had to do at classic release. Blizzard seriously eat crow in regards to Classic and its appeal. They put foot in mouth in a HUGE way and have yet to praise the playerbase for helping them.  
---
I think Classic is going to be great for Blizzard. At the moment though it is not the tail that wags the dog and that is all I meant by tempering the News of "Highest quarterly increase in history".l
---
Healbot is just one addon, there are hundreds of different ways to organize your raid frames. You can also use clique or mouseover macros if you need the click to heal behaviour.
---
Dude you realize I LITERALLY said my opinion is equally anecdotal? 
---
Also, saying “fuck you horde, you guys did this shit” isn’t really in good faith.
---
I just realised that the naxx out meme will come full circle and naxx will actually be out at some point
---
I had a name that was a really bad word in a different language, it was pointed out by a guildie and I just wrote to blizzard and the gm completely understood and gave me a name change
---
 Yea it’s really making me care less and less.  I’ve bought my priest bis chest pattern and made along with the hide of the wild and I’ve enchanted everything and I haven’t won a piece in 2 months.  People who beat me in rolls don’t even enchant the gear they won.   For instance:  I’ve lost the aura stone hammer off of garr to three priests none of which show up regularly and I think one actually bothered to enchant the damn thing.
---
Wait, how do I solo Omokk for Skyshroud leggings?
---
This.  I already spent my week solo farming eyes, herbing, helping guildies get gear, working on alts etc.  Raid time is time to roll through MC/Ony whilst engaging in BS and memery with the boys.
---
Do you have a video or guide for how to solo Omokk?
---
Blatant cross faction collusion, market manipulation, acting like assholes in general
---
I'm in a loot council gear, all it means is that gear goes wherever it makes the highest impact (hint, this often means the fully prebis player is punished for having the best pre-raid item in each slot)
---
Look at the feathers- when the lines come together, they should come together to a point. The lines are also not "strong" (clearly defined and cleanly separated from other illustration or shading.)
---
If this were a free tattoo, then it would be OK but if I paid any money for this at all I would ask for a refund. It just lacks attention to detail and it looks rushed... Not a good look for something you're gonna carry with you forever
---
Proximity with a mob puts you on their threat table which puts you in combat. This doesn't always happen I think, not sure why. This is a thing in retail, there were many many times when I passed a fight on a flight mount and got stuck in combat.
---
Odd thing is when a mob runs away at low health or from a fear and pulls another linked mob, the threat table seems to transfer to the new mob. So, you're in combat because of proximity, the mob shouts for help and another mob 30y away from you gets pulled, you're on his threat table.
---
And when there's nothing but proximity targets on a mob's table, the one they choose to attack is seemingly random. This is the reason why sometimes, someone pulls a mob, and it goes to you, even though you damaged nothing, debuffed nothing, buffed or healed nothing, just stood there. Something that might draw even more attention is if you're buffing or healing yourself, or getting mana back or anything that increases threat. All it takes is being on the threat table at 0 to be involved in the fight and start building threat from self-heals or mana regen.
---
Note that when mobs are linked like this, as in they get pulled together, proxy pull other mobs, run to them in fear, etc... sometimes the mobs are sort of "super-linked" which means that as long as you fight one of them, you fight all of them. Their reset timers might get desynchronized and one of them might start evading while the other keeps on chasing, but damaging the latter will pull the former out of its evade mode and back into the fight.
---
All of those, except proximity aggro, are behaviors I've never noticed on any private server, don't remember from tbc, and have never seen in retail. I think Blizz recreated them for classic. If not, then maybe it's a case of open world being so much more casual in anything but vanilla that there's no grounds to even notice it or get annoyed by it. And I haven't played vanilla so I wouldn't know how it really worked.
---
No, not arguing, more of calling out skeptiscm by the blizzard board / stockholders that wow might not have made as much cash as they thought it would, when from every which way you looked at it from OUTSIDE that perspective it was gonna be a nock out of the park... and it showed, and showed EXTRA cuz of all the cost cutting they clearly have done.  I LOVE the game just as much as the next, but a few things here and there have prevented me from loving it to its fullest extent is all :(
---
LMAO have you checked the LFG channel lately?
---
WoD was the first expansion where I made bank of an unintended mechanic.
---
Few people knew the timers on each shop in the garrison would still produce on its timer, even if you switched it out for another.  With about 5 minutes work per day you could switch out each shop and take the gains from the previous week.  Made quite a bit of gold off that until they finally patched it out.
---
WoD was trash.  Absolute trash, and it's when I realized Blizzard no longer knew shit about how to design a game.
---
You don't understand how the entire world that was hand crafted to be traversed via the ground, when suddenly that no longer matters and you take off on the Z axis?
---
It trivializes ALL world design and it takes out almost all world PvP, changing how everything is played.
---
Realm transfers don't work.
---
you should try an rpg instead of an mmo
---
Just got a stockade pauldrons drop, an epic tank shoulders, anyone know how much people might be willing to pay for it? (I know prices defer from server to server but just wanted to get a general sense of the price)
---
I love seeing all hordes on Skeram whine that they Alliance are ruining the server by doing the logical thing and gtfo that mess of a server. Guess what mate, you're free to transfer you too.
---
Be part of the solution you too and transfer. But I guess it's not you who should transfer, its all the other horde players that should right?
---
Definitely leave. You belong in a guild with like minded people.
---
Our LC keeps track of all loot and then lets those with less peices or no BTI (big ticket items: weapons, trinks) roll against others in the same boat for most gear. Obvs they prio weapons for specific classes based on guild raiding comp to best clear and up the DPS of the guild as a whole... Everyone seems to like it as far as ive heard.
---
I dont understand all the flak from LC guilds...
---
I had a guildie do that run thinking the first aid book was in Moonglade. Had a good laugh about that one.
---
Remind me!
---
Thanks man i think ill start to try it out I mean the two spots are so close so why not
---
Dang this madman levelled in Holy
---
Dont break the bank though, I got a cheap old used office chair from a garage sale. After cleaning off the caked grime it's incredibly comfortable and only cost 9 bucks. Best chair I've ever owned
---
Err, point is that it doesn't need to be a gaming chair, office chairs can be good too. Get something fabric and not leather, something that hugs your butt but doesn't drown it, and something that has a back to it. At least, that's my opinion
---
But who would bother invading darnassus in the first place?
---
The +SP multiplier is based on a cast time of a spell (or length for hots). However there is a cap to how much the muptiplier can be and at level 20 your spells usually reach it. But you would probably want to double check it for every spell.
---
Hey its ya boi confusedmage here. My question of the day is what is a boomkin
---
DKP is the best system.
---
That trinket is BoE isn't it ? Might be a good idea to buy it if that's really all you need.
---
How do they snipe auctions so readily? Are they just afk at the AH checking prices?
---
Dude pallies are the king of 1v1 if it's anyone even remotely around your level
---
It literally says it procs of xp in the tooltip? Am I missing something?
---
No we don't.
---
US servers are almost completely homogeneous, nearly everyone is American or Canadian and speaks English. There's no need to ask where anybody's "from", so we don't do it.
---
I was very suspicious of loot council but after joining a raid that uses it I saw that it works really well if done right  (and no I didn't get a bunch of items or something)
---
Pretty much forces you to spam cc on the pet while the hunter is free to do his thing.  
---
Yeah, that's easily an aimed shot in your face for half your HP already.  
---
And as a priest, yeah can't really use my fear on the pet unless it also hits the hunter.  
---
Following the logic of "good players can counter it", yeah. just use a fucking bear then and see how that works.
---
Eh I'll probably just keep running strat live with 2 orbs reserved and make 60g a run.
---
Haha weird!!! I just wanted a fp!
---
Quest for BIS healer ring, archivist cape (though kind of pointless now with hide from DM), Truefaith pattern for priests, as well as the fact that healers are never an issue to find unlike tanks
---
That's when you bribe other druids for innervates
---
A druid specced into balance (caster dps). In later expansions that spec got a moonkin form and they used to deal serious burst so caster dps druids get called boomkins.
---
If youre short people... you'll take any of those because a body is better than nothing. I did also say your guild can run all the meta you want.
---
That's kind of a broad assumption though no? Also there's more than one "type" of high pop server. There's the original 4 servers, and then there's the second wave of servers that came out within the first couple days that are also high pop. The only low pop ones are the servers that opened after transfers were allowed.
---
But still, I'm not sure we can give time estimates based on the number of people alone. More people might mean more casual pvpers. You need people active in pvp enough to show up on the rankings, but not too high as to push you down.
---
You can, but locking can be resisted, and the rate for that is based on your level vs your target's level.  And when they resist, you lose stealth and aggro them.  You can vanish, but it has a cooldown and sometimes doesn't work.
---
People mistakenly think leveling with Voidwalker is the only option with Warlock.
---
Once you hit level 35, you can switch to drain tanking, use a succubus and efficiently level without ever stopping to drink.
---
People complain about talents only having the illusion of choice, but you genuinely had more choices than the current game has (where there's just one good build for single-target and AoE per spec).
---
You could level with an Imp, Voidwalker or Succubus only thanks to various talent build options. You weren't locked to your spec identity either, being able to incorporate aspects of two or all three specs was awesome in appealing to actual class fantasy.
---
Wow grow up
---
equally shit
---
1 More mage &gt; buffing 4 other mages 3% crit. Boomkins, Feral druids, Enh shamans, Ele Shamans, Ret Pallies are carried by their raids.
---
It wont be that much different until nef tbh.
---
I'm having trouble believing any game company would let an AI hand out 6 month bans with no human supervision.
---
Junk? Oh well, let the hunter’s have them in that case.
---
Thank you I see this term used many ways so I was unsure what it meant!
---
That's what you get for trying to use fireball as a priest.
---
/cheer
---
Okay is most of that gear worth it if I have green iron for my stuff and a ww axe or is it better to just lvl and go for higher gear? It's hard to get groups when I'm on at 1-7am
---
Another question, I see alot of people talking of imbalance servers and the like, how do I know if I am on such a server?
---
Addons sit there and snipe auctions for ya?
---
Solid stone to auction, and lifeless stone/some salt and other vendor trash. Occasional greens to dust sell or vendor.
---
In 2 or 3 more levels you can switch to whelps and farm flame sacs
---
Blizzard
---
Nobody cares, idiot.
---
I think youre the guy who missed the joke
---
I just finished a MC run where both garr and baron biding dropped... some scrub just got a full TF in his first raid.   Also, i have seen 5 bindings in 3 weeks.. so i call BS on the 3% drop chance.
---
They'll lose happiness when you are offline? What if you want to like, take a holiday for a week or something?
---
Warriors do some of the highest dps in the entire game. If you are specd correctly and not dumb....
---
It's really only used in ZG/AQ20 pugs.
---
Because I think TBC added a lot of things that contributed to the downfall of Vanilla.
---
How I remember vanilla you could chose which to ability to cast first by the order on the action bar. This doesn’t work in classic. 
---
Having tried leveling with claw/growl my pet would keep clawing and not growling which sometimes led to me getting aggro. It would sometimes run up and use claw prior to growling leading to a large delay on threat and me getting aggro. 
---
After swapping to bite/growl I did not have any of those issues and the dps seem to be very similar. 
---
Claw becomes important again due to push backs in pvp at 60
---
Ok boomer
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
It's not very hard to level twice and people want the bops from gnomish. Pretty easy to understand.
---
How much longer will this Boomer thing last jesus
---
Loot Council is the fairest system.
---
Loot council is the most unfair system. 
---
Depends how much the loot council values being "fair". 
---
My guild does 9 man loot council. Each class lead represents their class, and the raid lead represents the raid as a whole (if loot is being decided between a mage and warlock, raid lead helps dictate that). 
---
I am the mage lead, so I'm privy to all the conversations (we also cycle in guild members every week so non LC raiders are always listening). The problem is that no matter how fair you are, people think your logic for being fair is "unfair". People who show up on raid night with no consumables think they deserve just as good of loot as people who spend hours helping guildies and farming consumables for the raid as a whole.
---
Not that guy, but on my server they go for ~1k gold
---
Ok, yaa i can see how it all depends on the "council" at hand dishing out loot.
---
I guess i was a bit naive to think that most would prioitize making the guild sronk-er than one person... but i guess thats my mistake lol
---
I mean it's pretty obvious when loot council is being abused too. If you see someone getting a piece of loot when multiple other people were more deserving of it, and this happens multiple times, the loot council is obviously corrupt.
---
What level can you start it?
---
You don't need to finish the set...
---
LC is only good for super elitist guilds that intend to progress raid at the very top of the server. Like the kind of guilds who have a group of officers that really know their shit and who want the prestige of being the top guild.  
---
For any other guild, LC is simply garbage. Too easily abused, often has useless officers who don't know what they are doing etc. DKP is in my opinion the way to go for any semi-tryhard guild that has a decent core of raiders and who want to get shit done without much drama. You can incentivice whatever you want and people who do more for the raid, get more loot.  You are also pretty free with your rules. Our guild for example caps the amount of DKP you can have at 500, which is roughly what you can earn in 3-4 weeks. 
---
\+1 is some PuG shit and is in general shit. I prefer a free roll system. I once ran +1 and I only rolled on loot after we killed Garr, because it was just way more important to see if the Aurastone hammer drops or not. +1 systems just almost always make you feel like shit.
---
I want to throw into the room: Round Robin
---
In Round Robin you have a list of people who are the next to receive loot. People can either take it or leave it. If for example Aurastone Hammer drops and person 3, 10 and 34 wants it. Person on number 3 gets it and goes back to the last spot.
---
OK BO..  okay yeah it's getting old, just like BOOMERS
---

---
On my server, they don't take ret pal, spriest, balance or feral cat (druid), if the game was balance. They could be accepted in guild raid and other. And thats why 25 people or 10 people is better more chance to have everyone on raid night. Having shortage of people in a 40 man raid sucks because sometimes you will give gear to someone and will never see that piece of gear again which is kind of a waste.
---
See that was at least tasteful, take my upvote damnit
---
-gofish
---
Keep using your cat. Try and get Broken Tooth if you don’t already.
---
Have pet attack and pet return macros. Link Hunter’s Mark and pet attack into one macro for soloing/levelling. 
---
Keep Growl and Bite on auto cast when soloing and levelling. Have Bite and Claw on auto cast when in dungeons. Grab Dash as well and keep it auto permanently. 
---
This is honestly all you need. 
---
Make a manual-cast Growl macro if you want - can infrequently be useful in dungeons if a pull goes south and the healer is getting wailed on.
---
Managing your pet as a Hunter is pretty simple. Just have your ‘pet return’ macro committed to muscle memory - if a mob flees in the direction of another pack you need to call your pet back ASAP whilst you try and shoot the runner down.
---
It’s on YouTube not sure where I saw it
---
Daily 4-5 hours of pure pvp, sure, probably doable.
---
“We were just doing our jobs.”
---
Ignorance or stupidity?
---
"  Its just being selfish and being a hypocrite to leave to another realm because you are out numbered." 
---
You can't be serious? I'm sorry it's so selfish of me to not want to be camped by assholes all day. Herod is a complete shit show and honor isn't out until Tuesday. The boat from Menethil to Theramore already had Horde camping out on it ganking or mind controlling anyone trying to get on the boat. I've had multiple different groups of level 60s, in different zones, follow my low level hunter around ONLY killing my pet in the hopes of making me lose it. These actions aren't PVP, it's just being assholes because they know they have the overwhelming advantage of numbers on the server. Hope they enjoy it when they've made it a ghost town and there isn't enough Alliance on the server to help with opening the gate quickly in phase 5.
---
Roll a hunter alt.
---
Currently playing a paladin and really while it is mainly auto attacking and applying seals it's not that bad - I feel like it's the same for most classes, like when I play my hunter I pretty much just use hunters mark-sting-auto shot or I will run out of mana fast.
---
Because it sounds completely insane. Trusting any kind of automated system with something as severe as a SIX MONTH ban, is beyond ridiculous.
---
Why wear shoe when hoof work.
---
&gt; If they go oom quickly it would make longer fights worse for them, not better. Also, you wont have twice the mana in tier 3. Not even close.
---
Later raid fights past ZG are not particularly long, depends on the fight.
---
&gt; That's not exponential.
---
Yes it is. Crits give faster spell casts which give more crits.
---
&gt; You seem like you dont know what you're talking about.
---
That's the jist I got from you too!
---
On 1-3 minute fights post BWL boomkins are not terrible, not as bad as hunters or spriests or rets or any of that.
---
Glad you ended up with the next thing that dropped.
---
That’s cool to know, I’ve been playing wow since early BC and I never knew that! Wow.. 
---
This makes me think of what other things do we say and do in wow that was influenced by previous games.
---
If your bis list is any good you will have at least 3 options per slot.
---
&gt; Someone is holding the cards and can tinker with the score. 
---
Our guild has clearcut rules for what gives DKP. The DKP list is posted every day after a raid. If someone has problems with their score, they can say it and what they believe went wrong.
---
&gt;  Or, people will jack up the price on upgrades for other people that they don’t really need that much just to ensure they get their drop. 
---
Well that is imo just part of the game and part of the fun.
---
&gt; Or, classes that aren’t terribly reliant on gear from that tier (Feral Tanks, Holy Paladins with current gear) will get swagged out for cheap and outbid people on the next tier with ease. 
---
Our guild has new and old DKP. The current raid tier uses new DKP, whereas all the previous ones use old DKP. Old DKP has twice the cap. For example, if AQ40 is out, BWL, ZG and MC will give you old DKP and you can use it for BWL, MC and ZG. Whereas only DKP earned in AQ40 can be used for AQ40.
---
That's why the the whole guild transfers. Tons of alliance guilds did. Good luck getting t14 with no enemy faction
---
Lol, NO ONE gets Rank 14.. its a myth...

Yeah but people don't run dungeons for a "3rd 4th or 5th best item" when there are suitable other dungeons with the 1st best item.  Why would you be running dungeon X for a 3rd 4th or 5th best item, when you can run dungeon Y with your 1st best item?
---
This leads tanks to not really do live strat because if they are going to do a dungeon, they will do literally any other dungeon that actually has the pre-BiS.
---
So if you are going to get a tank to put aside what they actually need for gear so you can get the gear you want, they might as well get *something* out of the dungeon.
---
Looks to me like there’s 3 bad seats
---
lol
---
A 7 person raid did it yesterday, they wiped but got the kill.
---
Dungeon spam and BRD spellcleave since level 50 baby
---
It should be whatever the guild decides, it’s up to you to make the smart decision and go with it.
---
Every mage plays frost because fire sucks in mc/ony/brd/etc. Not because you can't aoe in lower level dungeons like zf.
---
Eh, I'm in no rush for 60, I just want a mount to get places quicker. Appreciate the insight though.
---
Dude, as a rogue you kind of have to be a little bit more n there. You can’t sheep, you can’t banish, you can’t shackle, you can’t buff. Be positive, help find tanks or just run the group. It’s definitely a thankless class so just try to be the best you can. Distract patrols to help the tank pull, apply crip poison for stupid running mobs, interrupt the fuck out of mobs, make sure lock pick is 300. Be the best you can at your class. If you fundamentally don’t like it, roll another class
---
I’m just saying I’ve never seen a guild doing open rolls in any expansion from BC to mop when I quit.   It’s a bullshit system and will dunk them in BWL when nobody has gear
---
Ok cool are the whelps in badlands too?
---
Thats why im here!
---
fewer fire mages with higher crit = higher avg dps.
---
Hey! I know you!
---
Wait how little DKP do you give out per boss and stuff? We have enough DKP rolling around that the average item has to go for about 130-150 dkp because this is how much the raid earns per item drop.
---
I pvp because it's fun and more challenging than running instances so much that its choreographed like synchronized swimmers.  Rank is meh whatever. I cant possibly play enough to take it seriously so why even worry about it. Not to mention people cheesing honor by organizing cross faction "honor trade raids". I didnt even realize it was a thing until I saw a drama blowout on our servers discord this past week. I'm thinking to myself wow do people need a rank so bad they'll do that?
---
&gt; That's still not exponential.
---
Higher int = more  mana = more spells = more casts = more crits
---
more crits = more haste = more spells = more crits.
---
The first point of crit is not as strong as the 20th. The first 1000 mana does not give as much as the second 1000 mana. It is exponential.
---
Don't worry too much about your armor pieces.  Just ensure you have an up-to-date weapon and you should be fine as a warrior.
---
shhhhhh, we don't need more competition in that area!
---
TSM has a feature that allows you to constantly scan for auctions to snipe.
---
This has been a popular slot for quite some time, it’s nothing new lmao
---
Definitely no
---
Hey buddy, if it worked then as it did today, why was it hotfixed with the Onyxia threat hotfix?
---
It no longer drops aggro.
---
this shitty subreddit struck again!
---
I'm gonna give it a shot, it looks interesting so far. If I dont like it I got good ol classic to fall back on
---
Yeah we also had 2 Ony bags. We also had at least one ony bag on every kill up to now.
---
Bruh I unlearned tailoring 300 by mistake, wanting to unlearn skinning 300. That's stupid.
---
There's someone who has been leveling up via exploits and workarounds without doing those quests to remove that so he gets shit on everytime he goes to a capital
---
Yeah you have no idea what exponential means. Along with your other false claims and moving the goalposts.
---
Noooope.
---
The tank has no reason to be there. I assume you do, even if what you want doesnt drop. This is the difference, so expecting the tank to eat the cost of running the dungeon and run it out of the goodness of his heart is going to leave you waiting for a tank forever.
---
I thought you could, it was only PvE -&gt; PvP that was blocked?
---
It could also be a smart move to put their name out there and get good server rep pugging their 3rd tier roster. You said there is 3 teams, are all 3 open rolled? Cuz I highly doubt their core team is.  
---
I’m not on your server so idk what’s up with your guild but if you don’t agree with it, like everyone else here posted, why stay? You’re **sooo** obsessed with them “fucking up” yet you’re the one actively choosing to stay. You clearly don’t like it so switch guilds, if you’re as devoted as you say you are than surely you’ll be repped to a good guild easily?
---
No, but they do tell you when somethings underpriced, and then you buy it immediatly
---
TSM basically automates everything but the buy button. It constantly scans the AH and gives you a warning and an option to buy when it sees a big irregularity. Basically like fishing.
---
I only ever got rank 9, and that was with taking a week off work and pvping 6 to 8+ hours everyday, after doing at least 4 hours a day for the month leading up to it.
---
I guess depends on the server though. This was also pre cross server bgs.
---
I did it but was tanking the dogs and didn't get credit for the Nathanos kill... I've yet to find another successful group since. The one I was in that succeeded was probably 20 people or so.
---
All of their 3 or 4 teams are open rolls have been.
---
But what if you had two level 60s, surely you would be happier?
---
The difference is that raiding is the only thing in retail. In Classic, raiding is just something you do to get gear. The real game is going out in the world and killing other people with that gear.
---
I just realize the server I am on is "normal" so pvp is by choice looks like gonna reroll on a new server now. RIP 26 hours of my life
---
Absolutely not, too in love with classic.
---
Yep, to the far east. Some north and some south of the bigger dragons.
---
Lvls 42-45 maybe
---
TBH. I don't follow BiS lists. But this is because I look at my character and what I need and see that there are items which are just straight up better.
---
You can also see this because BiS lists are different depending on where you look. I made myself my own list and it is almost the same as the BiS lists. The thing is, many items are just straight up so much better than anything else, it does not come even close.
---
I wish I hadn't made a priest and I wish my friend hadn't made a war. We shoulda sticked to hunt / lock / mage / druid, as in the easy classes that can be done with leveling 3x faster than our shitty classes.
---
not true.  only the last popular pserver had alliance majority because they realized after years of playing palys are op as fuck. nost and elysium were horde majority.  light's hope was only servers alliance majority.
---
what is drain tanking?
---
If you have ravager hold onto it until mara. The ravager is brokenly op.
---
I remember I think it was BC when I could have my voidwalker out tank some warriors. It wasn't ideal but we would use 3 dps 2 healers and let my voidwalker tank everything. Was a beautiful time considering how much easier it is to find healers than tanks and how you can just have two lower level healers since you have that backup.
---
pick Sulfuras.
---
sweet, thanks man
---
Is there a particular reason for that??
---
Haven't seen this exact post in a few days. Guess it was due
---
Faerlina has 15+ Alliance pug MCs a week and even my smallish non-streamer guild is running two/week. The big streamer guilds have 3-5 a week. Not sure those numbers are a great metric.
---
Does anyone think Mature Blue Dragon Sinew will drop in price due to world boss? Debating if I should use it, or sell now and buy cheaper in a couple weeks
---
Do as you please. Retail can be as fun as you want it to be...mostly. the story looks interesting so far
---
Fury PVP is incredible if you get super geared out in later phases.   Look up Hulksmash Fury PVP. But going fury now?  You'd be gimping yourself into oblivion.
---
But it’s 2019 and those of us who played vanilla have the means to own multiple gaming rigs/laptops.  I have logged in from my main pc at my home, my main pc at my vacation condo, and my gaming laptop while traveling.  I have never had an issue - although I believe they could say I was account sharing based on the geolocation of my computers - sometimes I vpn but must times I don’t based on the connection / data routing.
---
I personally think classic and modern are both fun games, classic is “better” in my opinion more rpg elements and all that jazz, but the modern game is really fun too! They’re totally different games after all
---
Imp blizzard is for solo farming actually, what I described above is the best possible way for group aoe farming
---
For anyone re rolling or thinking about re rolling Warlock because “theyre OP” or theres less of them in raids, please be prepared for the total bullshit mechanic of soulshards, and be prepared to summon half of your fucking raid while they sit at Org, then be treated like a walking health pot vending machine.
---
Fishing is sustained by engineering stuff.
---
High pop, balanced faction pop, no streamers.
---
It’s fine. I’m 34 right now and I even specced into resto first to get insect swarm.
---
I normally open with 1-2 starfires, dot and then melee the rest. Rejuv + bandage for heals.
---
Can kill 2-3 before I need to drink.
---
Or I’ll shift into cat to kill another before I drink.
---
I don’t see how it’s any worse than levelling a warrior
---
How can you say no changes when implementing a faction transfer balancing system is a change?
---
All I can think of is them thinking its somehow more logical to spend 15 minutes waiting for someone else over just waiting 2 minutes
---
Will do rolling my character now, see ya round!
---
Yeah I never would just blame the res sick player and kick you.
---
You showed up. 
---
Its 10 minutes. We are going to probably be in here for 2+ hours depending on the dungeon. Might as well take care of everyone's IRL BRB stuff now, instead of throw a fit. 
---
If you cant handle a 10 minute fluctuation in your dungeon run you shouldn't be pugging.
---
Now this is one heck of an answer
---
&gt; I've leveled 3 characters to level 60, and a few to lvl 30-40
---
the hell
---
low 30s. or you could do the actual big brain play and test both yourself to see how combat tempo feels with your specific gear and playstyle.
---
HEH 
---
Well, worry not, BoarisJonson is safe. 
---
I got my last liver, finally, and logged off for the evening.
---
Until they all die?
---
I personally don't see the issue.
---
Always good to start mixing in Dungeons. IIRC, theres not enough quests to get you to level 60.
---
Nah you can be mad, but that’s part of classic. It sucks, but that’s the game, people don’t care about you.
---
I never roll on something that is BiS for someone else and just an upgrade for me. Most people will just need though no matter what. 
---
I once had a hunter need on Blackrock slicer (it has no stats and a mele only effect) after that I don’t expect much from people
---
Yesss...  I wish there were fluffy cats in classic like my chonk!
---
If I know anything about anything asking about how long something will last will just make it all the more prevalent and long lasting, ok Boomer?
---
Doesn’t matter got purples
---
Its not event good. Your pre-raid bis are way better imo.
---
I mean, is it an upgrade for you?
---
If yes, the issue here is the druid rolling on gear they cannot yet equip, not rolling on "rogue" gear.
---
If not, get over yourself, none of the set bonuses affect only rogue spells/abilites and as such, the set and it's bonuses are perfectly viable for a feral druid.
---
Because a full brd run takes 5 hours. People have have time or a need for that.
---
By the way, not just priests can buff enemies. MC Helm does the trick  aswell
---
Yeah basically rolling on class sets is dumb as fuck if you arent that class.
---
Larger upgrade increases overall raid dps and is therefor a better solution for a guild who is still progressing in content.
---
why didnt u guys... roll on it ???
---
I said "I'll just fish for a few minutes." 2 hours later I start my second DM West run with that group
---
someone should tell him about the gospel of shamans
---
Ever heard of master loot?
---
https://f00l.de/wowtranslator.php
---
And any server without queue time will accept you before even checking spec/lvl just because you wrote "dps here"
---
Honestly if a girl cant take me gaming, then I'd be happy she is away.
---
That said, I dont have a girlfriend so there is that.
---
Fishing is sustained by a fishing pole
---
Laughs in dal rend.
---
what the fuck
---
so glad i got mine off a random drop
---
Made 620g so far over those 45 days
---
It was an upgrade, and the druid was a tank.  He won't benefit from the +energy set bonus.
---
Wouldn't it just make sure that an equitable number of horde and Ally are playing at the same time which seems like an honest goal for a pvp server.
---
Not if you wanna fish in Winterspring. Then you gotta have them +100 stuff.
---
On the bright side the plans for lionheart helm are pretty worthless once there are several crafters on the server. Seems a bit silly to bother ninjaing that unless it’s the first one
---
You get "xp" off of lvl 48+ players at 60, same with honor.
---
fuck off we're doing aoe
---
Spam dungeons for bis at 60. Focus on getting there asap you are already behind. Phase 2 gonna start soon and if you are on a pvp server it will be hard to fight back or even survive with no gear
---
IDK what I actually want but I don't think I'd deserve to complain if I was on a 50/50
---
Same.
---
There is a ledge near the bride you can jump on and off to force super long pathing. There are videos for it.
---
I have heard such protestations, everyday for 20 years. Let’s hear no more explanations
---
Save your breath 
---
Save your tears
---
I am. I had red hair when I made my character, but recently dyed it purple.
---
Every time I cast blizzard I imagine it's the tears from lonely rogues. Have fun but... bruh... we're doing aoe
---
Most retail players seem pretty chill.  I played at the start of BFA but couldn’t find a guild that raided on the days I had available, so I quit, but I recently came back to unlock allied races and level up some characters in preparation for shadowlands.  I haven’t came across any issues so far, and I’m severely undergeared for anything  recent.
---
But I will say, I feel like all the toxic players started from the private servers, not retail.  They’re the ones who set the current meta, and of course the hardcore players adopted it, but I think it’s way off base to claim this toxicity came from retail.
---
They can tank actually. With no troubles. You're never alone healing a main tank in a raid. If the shaman drops with good gear, the healers are blind and asleep.
---
Catchya round zoomer.
---
Especially strat live, nothing is bis for tanks. The shoulder aren't terrible, but there's no real incentive for someone to tank it. First orb reserve is really a no brainer if you actually want a tank for the run.
---
You gotta hate what others accomplish I guess. Why can't you be proud that someone managed to do it ?
---
Classic is all about being in a decent guild. Pugging just isn't as applicable in classic as it is in retail.
---
With gear at a pre-bis/bis mixture, the stat weights are closer to:
---
11 Spelldmg &gt;= 1 Crit
---
14 Spelldmg &gt;= 1 Hit
---
Fuckheads
---
I followed [this](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-engineering-guide-1-300/) guide for 1-300 engineering because it had a shopping list so i could pre calculate the cost of everything based on the price the items were going for on the AH.
---
If you're planning to do it properly and go gnomish, get the bop items, then go goblin, you can double the price plus the cost of the mats for all the bop items.
---
If you want one or the other, [these](https://www.wowhead.com/news=294949/choosing-between-gnomish-or-goblin-engineering-in-classic-wow) are your differences in available items. Note the BoP ones as anything BoE you can use in either spec, you just have to buy it off someone who can make it. 
---
If you don't want to level it twice, I suggest going gnomish, that way if you do come into some gold in the future, you can unlearn it and get goblin too, but in my opinion gnomish has better items in the Battle Chicken, Death Ray, and i like the gadgetzan transporter.  
---
As far as must have items that work for both, I don't think i could live without my [Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflector](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18639/ultra-flash-shadow-reflector), [Gyrofreeze Ice Reflector](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18634/gyrofreeze-ice-reflector), or [Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18638/hyper-radiant-flame-reflector) after having them for a couple weeks now.
---
A guild member once asked me to craft some items. A lot of them. So, I started and went AFK. 
---
I crafted the wrong item. Hundreds of times.
---
Never. I just tanked Scholo and Strat (both sides) with my shaman and I was drinking every 3-4 pulls. I was drinking mainly because the healer / caster dps couldn't keep up. IF you understand how to abuse your mana regen and that you equip a regen set like Green Dragonscale in between two pulls, you're good to go. It's intensive on the macro side, but it's a simple game. I just press a button and 3 piece of gear come up and boosts my mana regen while we're moving to the next spot. Then I cast Chain Lightning and equip the gear to tank during the casting time. Easy.   
---
If you're running oom, you're spamming unnecessary spells as a tank, which is a bad behavior. You have so little to do, just keep your mana up and your aggro where it needs.
---
I haven't used it in classic, but back in vanilla atlas or atlasloot addons had this function.
---
The guide is great.
---
I rolled the right class (priest) but on the wrong server and faction. So I rerolled warrior and got it geared then decided I really did want a priest so now I'm sitting on 2 60 priests and my stupid warrior I don't want to play.
---
Bra ive been doin ubrs for dalrends for weeks now i feel ya.
---
6 weeks minimum, dozens of runs and i have yet to see them even drop.
---
Did 9 runs yesterday only, got 3 reed lmao
---
Newb here, does this actually work out fine for tanking? You don't just end up randomly wiping because they're specced and geared as not-a-tank?
---
I kick people who don't believe I'm tanking as a Shaman. I do not need another idiot in my PUG. I'm fine with people being surprised, others whining and making up excuses are a waste of my time. I'm there to collect loot, not ponder on the odds of going through with a Shaman tank.
---
As someone Else said, Rock elementals in the badlands are good, but everyone knows this so they're often overfarmed. 
---
Another option are wailing caverns or shadowfang keep solo runs. If you have skinning, wailing caverns is really good. You farm the Materials for the twink belt and AH those, while vendoring grays and most other loot.
---
Dude you literally have the same story, progression path, and questions as me thanks for asking:
---
For me, it was because it put the healers on edge and they grumbled constantly :( I was impressed it was possible, but I also saw what it took to make it work(healers white knuckle healing). The healers hated it.
---
Could only really use him on trash or offtank targets or bosses that didn't require a taunt.
---
It does not.
---
Every enemy has armor. :)
---
2 days played or so from there. How ever many days that takes you in real life.
---
The raid tanks will get an annihilator sponsored. These are the ones running around in tier gear already. 
---
The ones just wanting to get some tanking weapon in to make dungeon running easier want Bulky Iron Spaulders anyways, because you most likely dont have access to the tier gear yet.
---
Therefore if you really hate doing these 5x3min runs, you are best off to farm Mol'dar for Hedgecutter until Bulky Iron Spaulders drop, then if you got Spaulders and no Hedgecutter you can switch to running strat UD. 
---
Running for Boneslicing until it drops to then start to farm Mol'Dar for your shoulders makes no  sense to me.
---
There’s a website that tells you the best way to get from A To B in WoW. I can’t remember it but someone will post it I’m sure....
---
This is pretty bad advice. You don’t want claw+growl both toggled, because your pet will end up focus starved from spamming claw and will stop growling, resulting in it losing aggro. 
---
Having bite+claw for raids is also pretty useless, since micromanaging bite+claw instead of leaving claw on auto is 1-2 dps increase.
---
Sick false dilemma Reddit bro
---
Just login 2 hours before you get off work from your mobile phone if u can't handle the big queueueueue
---
Arguing on the internet and all.... But seriously, ok boomer is for when someone denies climate change, or doesn't understand college loans and the price of a house in todays economy or is completely out of touch.
---
 Or when a moonkin says or does anything.
---
I am just telling you my experience from vanilla. I wish you luck.
---
Bad advice.  Dungeon as soon as you can run the dungeons with your bis.  Waiting to run them at 60 just means you wasted your time leveling to 60 before starting when you could have been collecting bis and leveling to 60.
---
I mean, its not at all worthless. You finish a super easy quest turn in and pick up the flight path. I have personally used that FP a ton since dire maul came out
---
I just Quitted nearly wow cuz of this quest. I would camped you ever since if you done this to me. 
---
If I would be a priest I would do this all day, just to fk off people
---
Start running Mara at 49 and jump on the BRD train from 52+.
---
Im healing dungeons as ele since classic launch  without any problems.  Just brush it off when runs go bad people look for targets. Why did you even tell them ur ele?
---
Considering there is flight master available to everyone, just south from the lake, I applaud Blizzard for trolling thouse who are lazy to explore.
---
Yawn
---
Which server?
---
Got a big pop?
---
K bye blocked
---
Skinning is pretty Garbage endgame. Definitely drop it
---
Must be pretty expensive if it's worth losing monthly subs over.
---
I actually prefer lines that don’t come to points. 
---
He’s done other work on me where the lines go past the natural point. It was the same concept here. And you can see on other spots, such as the horde symbol in the middle where they don’t have a solid ending. I have a bear he’s done as well where there are no solid end points. All the lines continue to flow before fading off. Just a concept and style I like. A lot of it based off Eddie Stacey’s work from Ink and Dagger in Atlanta.
---
Gross I rerolled tank to not be like you
---
Even better, get all your alts to 60 as well.
---
Well tonight I walked into the Lion's Pride in on Grobbulus (RPPVP) and hear a lot of commotion upstairs. Wouldn't you know it, I walked right into an interracial orgy of some sort. I immediately became uncomfortable, but then said "fuck it.... when in Azeroth, right?"
---
It got weird. Gonna log off for the night.
---
Haven’t played retail since wotlk and that’s not changing
---
yeah you clearly didn't read the post nor know what master loot is.   
---
If master loot is on you can't loot ANYTHING besides greys.
---
Sulfuron, biggest French server
---
4 warriors with a resto sham is the best dungeon comp spell cleave is for the weak
---
Keep commenting more to justify charging people video game gold to run a video game dungeon
---
Fury is the highest dps spec in the game and it's not close until AQ...
---
What’s so hard about faction specific Xfers? I’m not the best at servers and stuff but I don’t see how there would be any limitation that wouldn’t allow this.
---
I need to know hot to say this from horde to alliance and I need it fast before meme lasts
---
So you want to tell me that at level 55 when he should be spamming brd he should go there? When he is an easy target for a level 60 that will get an honorable kill for killing him. He will get farmed over and over everytime he spawn. Going into Blackrock  mountain on a pvp server at phase 2 gonna be bad even for level 60. It going to be a war zone. Level 55 that will enter just gonna die quickly without much of a fight.
---
If you were to ask me a month ago I would've told you to go and get gear whenever you can enter the dungeon but now it is more important to get the levels so he won't be such an easy target.
---
37 isn't evenn halfway
---
Solo: Bite + Growl (auto), Pet on Defense.
---
Dungeon Grouping: Bite + Claw (auto), Pet on passive.
---
Use whatever pet makes you happy. Visit Petopia Classic.
---
Did you read the post?
---
Pussy ass lol
---
take a chill pill man, Jk
---
Mythic dungeon spamming sucks yet you’ll defend classic and it’s pre-bis never ending spam. I haven’t done as many mythic dungeons combined compared to how many ubrs runs I’ve done for MH dal
---
Slow, but doable. The great thing about druids is that if you know what you're doing it's hard to die. Takes a awhile to kill things, but you shouldn't have many graveyard runs. A competent pally/druid duo is damn near invincible.
---
Honestly, Holy with spirit tap while speccd into crit, smite and holy fire crushes. I even would go in as DPS sometimes.
---
Just play it? 
---
Also wow retail is not faceroll...otherwise classic is just as faceroll
---
You are unworthy.
---
Move too... we gonna need more horde to have fun with lol.
---
Triple-pulls all the way, man.
---
Pet to first mob, Sting   
---
Pet to second mob, concussion first, intimidation, Sting second   
---
Pet to third mob, growl back up, Sting, multishot   
---
Pet back to first mob, auto shot with multishot, Sting third mob   
---
Finish first, finish second, finish third.
---
Uses like 25% mana, super efficient and fast.
---
This would be right if raiding was the most important part of the game in Classic. For most people, it isn't. And it's not the most time-consuming for anyone. And lots of people never do it at all.
---
You're totally right that PvE in retail is much more dynamic and requires more attention. But it's the reverse for most other content.
---
Yes spam brd lol who cares if it takes you an hour to get there you don't need to ever leave brd.  Beyond that he's a rogue, also he might be on a server where his faction is dominant.   This is like the dumbest reason I've ever seen to not farm a dungeon
---
Loot Council is best, but it's lots of work for the guild officers. They need to keep track of attendance, be familiar with gear and what's good for who, keep track of how recently everyone's gotten gear, how much everyone contributes to the guild.
---
After each boss in MC, my guild leaders discuss and vote on who to give each piece of loot to while we continue clearing trash to the next boss. It's a tough for them to decide sometimes. I can understand some guilds not wanting to mess with loot council and just run it like a PUG.
---
It depends on how things are structured, it might even make things worse. Short answer is that optimising software is really complicated, and whatever they've done still isn't enough.
---
Does LFG still exist? Then no
---
I don’t understand. Can you explain to me how speed makes it bad? Kind of a noob here
---
"There are Hunters and there are huntards" 
---
-Chris Rock
---
But most are huntards...
---
Weakauras ?
---
It’s funny because all the horde on stalagg cry about having no alliance to kill but they won’t even entertain the thought of transferring to a realm where they are the underdog.
---
Planning to go afk? Jesus that's hardcore
---
Your already expecting horde to move to your 90-10 server cause your too much of a cry baby pussy to stay on a 60-40 one? I hope you either quit soon or your acc gets hacked and you have too
---
More horde if possible, makes the world more balanced
---
Many priests right now
---
Sorry, its just a post I remembered reading somewhere (probably this subreddit tbh). It might have been a plugin for details though, not sure.
---
This is why the game works.
---
Go retail if you want to try everything
---
Hunters are the best casters.
---
I don't tank groups where stuff is reserved, everyone should have a fair chance.
---
Why whine abour this its up to u if u want to play in a shitguild or not
---
Lol.
---
Read again, he was right.
---
It's not that he shouldn't, just that he is poised to have less competition for gear.
---
My spellcleave group was a lovely bunch of lads, had a blast doing 32-42 in one sitting in scarlet monastery
---
woops i meant to say lets spend 4 hours in blackfathom deeps
---
Shit
---
Die once, spawn in the dungeon, I don't see the issue really. No amount of gear is going to save you when a full group is camping the instance entrance and you're alone.
---
I think you over estimate the difficulty introduced by p2.
---
If his faction is dominating then sure nothing really matter the zone gonna be "his". I am taking the fact that being farmed over and over is frustrating and as it seems, since he asked, he is a new player. And for a new player it could be game changing. That he cannot do anything agaisnt high levels that keep killing him and... he might quit. So I think he should just level as fast as possible.
---
And if you were to give an argument that he is rogue he can stealth then being lower level makes you easier to detect. Being same or higher level makes you harder to detect.
---
yes ML is on, Glitch should have rolled it off instead of doing this duel tourney.. hes alrdy ninjaed when he said "oh we're doing a duel tourney" instead of rolling it off since only legendaries are ressed
---
Same the other way...
---
Nothing to add
---
Of you're asking this question the no, it's not worth it...
---
hahahahah 60-40? bye bye :)
---
&gt;They're always incredibly arrogant too, even though they never even played vanilla.
---
As opposed to arrogant """"""veterans""""" that spent 15 years sucking at the game and convincing themselves otherwise instead of actually learning and improving?
---
Bro plz stop talking to me you'll never convince me that pvp is a reason to not farm a dungeon
---
what do you mean?
---
The dungeon is huge, you can do different paths for different loot.
---
Please post art on the wow sub. We don't need that here
---
right so you saying why didn't you guys roll on it was pointless due to the fact that it was already ninja'd.
---
For priests trolls are actually better for pvp especially. Because of the priests racial spells.
---
If that's the case why isn't it consistent along all the feathers in the tat? Dude does shoddy work, that's why
---
I never said that TBC was worse than classic in every aspect. But for me the downsides outweigh the upsides.
---
I’m leveling holy also, but I have a pocket tank.
---
Looks like a normal visit to Gadget on Arugal (which is still layered) probably add 1-2 alliance.
---
The word paladin is not needed in that sentence.
---
I have a ginger gf (Flex) and i can confirm, no soul what so ever.
---
How good is he as a pet?
---
This is absolutely your fault for being dumb enough to stay in a Guild that does open rolls for loot. Open rolls are for pug runs. Think about it... The entire point of being in a guild (to raid) is to ensure loot stays within a core group of players. Inevitably players will leave or quit and this will fuck you. You are relying on rngrsus... Forever. I would rather quit than raid with this system. Do yourself a favor and gquit now. Join a guild with a dkp system so that you are guaranteed some value for your time.
---
It's turbo time!
---
Only 1 guards it.
---
Undercutting by 1c is the socially acceptable method, in my opinion.
---
At 60 rogues have been letting me down. 
---
Cheapshotting when I’m trying to LOS, bladeflurry when I mark a skull to focus (I want to keep aggro on everything when these mobs can do like 800 damage a crit, PLEASE chill out), greedy pickpockets being resisted into accidental pulls (vanish on CD)... 
---
Had a rogue flame me throughout scholo for being a fury warrior tanking. Good one man. I left after we wiped due to him and another dps blaming me after they pulled pats (because they didn’t want to wait for LOS... lol)
---
Just contact a GM. This is the easiest solution. Put in a ticket, describe the problem and boom, name change.
---
what? no he plays second base
---
Lmao
---

does this work in classic??

Gottem

And that issue was directly caused by introducing so few servers before launch. In the very first round of name reveals, there were ONLY TWO pvp servers on the EU realms. Increasing to 4 until less than 24 hours before release when 4 more were announced. In effect, anyone making any attempt at coordinating before launch only had 4 options out of the now 18 different pvp servers in English EU, with another 10 divided among France, Germany and Spanish speaking players.
---
Anyone attempting to coordinate with a large amount of people, had in practice only 4 options to pick from. I know for a fact a sizable community from my country picked Firemaw EU. Hundreds of people attempting to coordinate. There was no way for them to just change server hours before launch.
---
friggin aoe geind grps are cancer af
---
Really? So what should I aim for next?
---
I think that majority of Silithus quests arn't out yet
---
There are more players on horde and therefore more kids by default
---
&gt;What else would it be?
---
Reddit culture of downvote protection, attempting to manipulate the readers. You don't need to qualify your opinions before giving them, you can just...give them. It's not different from a news article having a title that says "X have revealed their latest Y (and it's fantastic)". That's telling the reader how to think.
---
I did this so many times, man the panic when they realize they have to run 5 minute South to get the disguise and run back up to see someone escorting him already, 20 minute wait.
---
Fact that priests are rolling on aurastone shows how as backwards this is.
---
No difference when your skill is super low and every hit gives a skill up. But very significant difference when higher. AI buff doubles my int and levels skill waaaaay faster
---
You'll have to find a weirdo tbh any amount that would be reasonable for you is gonna be less than they could make farming whatever.
---
Interesting
---
rogue bis is a bff healer or tank.
---
Having found out the way the ranking system works, I've lost virtually all interest in trying to get a decent rank.  Oh well.
---
I've been removed from a group like this as well.  Frost, but level 60 with no imp blizzard, in brd, rest of the group was ~52.  Like bro, I can pretty much solo those packs, you don't need imp blizz.
---
Well everyone is so loot starved I roll on everything that I can use or is an upgrade because you have to with an open roll bs rules
---
I dunno about til it drops. Maybe offering gold per run? 
---
Til it drops could be til phase 3, you could have some terrible luck. Maybe a small fee per run and a "bonus" if and win it drops?
---
I'm not sure how long the time is, but my group was disbanded when I  logged onto a third alt for I'm guessing like 5 minutes. I'm wondering if the time to get disbanded is the same as the time it takes for lead to pass.
---
My suspension was upheld multiple times. It took Araxom looking into the issue to get the suspension reversed. 
---
You're wrong and your arrogance makes you look even more foolish.
---
Trust me. Not as a healer.
---
Not in terms of XP no but definitely in terms of time.
---
Meanwhile, here I am on heartseeker alliance. Best of both worlds?
---
Maybe you're doing it wrong
---
Fury is far better sustained threat but awful for pulling back when you lose it in dungeons. 
---
For example, when the DPS is aoeing it’s much better to have shield slam than blood thirst.
---
That being said am I gonna go prot? Hell no, I need my lionheart helm
---
What did I just read?
---
They turned every dps in retail into either a rogue or warrior. Either you build a resource and spend it (rage), or you have a regening resource that you spend (energy).
---
As a seller of the Hand of Justice trinket. I can solo it. I don't accept per item, the RNG is simply too stacked in one direction. It took me 55 runs to get it to drop for myself. My guild master ran arena over 200 times to get his chest.
---
Protip:  
---
Advertise the runs as Arena -&gt; angerforge -&gt; golem lord. Make it clear the trinket is NOT reserve, but the chest is. You will get casters wanting the belt, melee wanting the trinket and you will get healers wanting the trinket off golem lord.
---
I got excited at first seeing the cursor, thought you were a fellow intellectual linux user, but then i slowly realized that's the OSX cursor.
---
Oh no. It's worse now than during the first rush. So many people heard of this and everyones toon is a mage. And layering got removed for the most part. Every single AoE spot is taken. Duskwallow marsh murlocs is really bad. You'd think it would be empty because it's out in the sticks? I had to share it with 2 other mages at 3am midweek.
---
Just lol @ u if you think most kids dont pick horde
---
From a third parties perspective... Dude are you 5?
---
Thats not how that works. If there are 1000 alliance and 2000 horde. If alliance has 500 kids and horde has 500 then alliance still has a greater amount of kids. 50% kids vs 25% kids.
---
Whichever one is the shammy ones.. i care bout lock stuff... lol

Didnt notice, but this is the perfect nod to Ace!

Orc is the best pvp race period.  If your class can go orc it should be orc if you want the best pvp class.

---
You can solo anger? Guessing youre a geared rogue or something?
---
I don't think it's about being prebis
---
It's about being the coolest robe at before epics and in vanilla i always wanted to be full dreadmist also
---
They go fury/prot, certainly deep enough into prot for the extra threat talent. This is very different from an ordinary fury warrior, who genuinely cannot hold aoe threat at all.
---
No. Never.
---
Just curious, which section does this violate?
---
You still sound really shitty &amp; entitled that you want ur problem fixed and everyone should fix it for you and you shouldn't do your part to get it done and instead pouting like a child about your woes when you have a solution available.
---
You can make a lot more than 4 s by grinding for 9 minutes so taking the flight is definitely worth it!
---
Go to Undercity. Located right alongside the mage trainers. They accept you. They respect you. They understand the discrimination.
---
100g without a flask is crazy but 50g is possible if someone is lazy and buys a bunch of elixirs/fire pots/mana pots at 430 on a Tuesday and then wipes 10 times.
---
&gt; Considering there is flight master available to everyone, just south from the lake
---
If you’re alliance scum.
---
Horde has their flight point in the south west corner close to the tunnel entrance
---
He used to spawn in a grove behind Rachet under a tree mixed in with other cats.  Is that where you found him? If so, just park an alt there and randomly log in to check.
---
That honestly sounds so repetitive and boring
---
Hm people on my server still take over a 100g fee, which would make it worth it for a guild (bank) to buy it so their warriors can skip thr crafting free if the pattern is Indeed cheap.
---
Tauren are ride or die, that's so true.
---
Doing spellcleave runs is done most of the time without tanks (depending on the dungeon, so its extra important to keep the stacked and slowed constantly)
---
I’m still level 39
---
2 scenarios
---
1) you have screenshot of the said raid leader specificely saying only leg. items are reserved and that rest is on roll + another screenshot of him ninjaing the items
---
IN THAT CASE: its against ToS and you should report it, instead of posting it on reddit
---
2) you dont have said screenshots and its word against word
---
IN THAT CASE: why should i believe you?
---
Locks being underrated is an overrated statement
---
Come get the voodoo
---
Don't comment then
---
There hits a point between pre-bis and full MC epics where you can stack enough int from your tier that the +healing loss isnt noticed because you can uprank a spell. You can calculate it, but once you hit +healing breakpoints and you're spam healing you can stack more int, or if you have a lot of downtime you can stick on even more +healing. 
---
But main piece wise you want both pieces of t2 with the 5 piece for t1, and then whichever piece of pre-bis you want in the last spot or you can just slap in another piece of t1 because in all honesty it doesnt matter.
---
Yeah I probably got very lucky. Stood up very early so I knew the server was not overpopulated and could run around with no interference. Had a target key which I spammed continuesly, then poof..
---
Did he get any loot though?
---
Why would you do that for humar when you can get broken tooth at 37?
---
Yep. Rogue is the god class for pvp and being orc is the only thing that can save you.
---
That's not how that works. In your case, they have the same **amount** of kids, but alliance has greater **percentage** of kids in the population.
---
In the original game, the sea lion quest was really memorable.  The icon at the bottom of the lake was hard to see - it wasn't in a giant cask with a purple aura around it - and at least one of the halves of the token was on the wrecked ship you can see from the air vent where the half-token is located now - a shipwreck which is in fatigue waters.  Getting the token without drowning wasn't easy.

Booo

Excuse you, I will die long before that from Crohn's disease that I can only afford to treat with marijuana. That makes me at least twice as American because I'm leaving more freedom for others.
---
...frigging hell, is that why I'm having such a pain finding a spot as a healer nowadays? Back in the old days I had people pm'ing me constantly to heal their group.

It doesn’t effect on spells you learn before level 20 as much/as high as it does on higher ranked spells, the coefficient is different between -20 and 20+ spells.

how the fuck does this get upvoted and me downvoted. this subreddit man.

RANK IS DETERMINED BY RANKING POINTS, NOT HONOR. HONOR IS USED TO DETERMINE RANKING POINTS. RANKING POINTS IS A RELATIVE SYSTEM. #1 ON THE SERVER GETS 13K RANKING POINTS, NO MATTER IF HE GOT 1000 HONOR (in some weird fucking world where literally no one else killed more than like 5 players), OR 1 MILLION.
---
Lol, i got a 48h ban for doing this in wsg so easy on the absolutely not
---
I was playing Alliance in late vanilla. I started as Alliance because real life friends were Alli. But I didn't like playing with them much so I started playing an alt solo. Then BC came out and I was leveling and I saw a pretty belf paladin coming off the boat to Booty Bay. I remember how beautiful he was almost like he was a real person. I almost immediately re-rolled belf, then over the years got reallly attached to my Horde brethren. Rolled goblins because goblins are hilarious. Later an orc because damn orc women's revamp looked good. I came to love the architecture and the style. One of these days I might get one of those Horde tattoos. So the belf loveliness brought me Horde side, but the awesomeness is what kept me there and made me feel this kinship.
---
Is there any difference between an item that says "increases damage done by Frost spells" and an item that says "increase damage and healing done by magical spells" in regards to frostbolt?
---
You're so cool dude
---
20-30 more years at the absolute most, since by then most of them will be dead.
---
It does, but it doesn't immediadly pop out of the picture when someone runs past you with it. Except for the crows flying around the player with it.
---
Dude you’re playing this game so much more healthily than me
---
Ye and they cash in all their dkp and get the best items to make mages and locks cry
---
It's a guaranteed drop. Why wouldn't there be an ony bag every kill?
---
Yeah, I dont understand OPs obsession with the word epic in the title. Legendary and Epic is not interchangeable in wow.

Resto is actually great paired with Ele. 30/0/21 is a very powerful spec at 60. You can heal any dungeon, and can pass for raids as well. You get +hit and crit from resto talents as well as better totems. Nature Swiftness gives you an instant cast heal or spell. All of this can be achieved while still getting -1 second cast time to LB/CL
---
Don’t heal if you don’t want to, just know that you’re perfectly capable if you try.
---
Don't be an asshole, I was just answering a question.
---
I got the impression he thought OP was rushing for something so I answered as such.
---
This is what happend
---
No problem, could you explain the switch every 30 seconds? The proc has 10 percent chance to proc on every damageing spellcast, what would switching it every 30 sec do?
---
I won the lottery, so I call BULLSHIT on bad chances on a lottery win!
---
Don’t be a bitch
---
Alright buddy.
---
Whatever zoomie
---
I've tried alliance and it's boring af
---
Imagine needing a tank in the first place lol
---
If you were so good as you apparently think you are it would be super simple to join a guild that has different loot rules. Best assumption based off what your saying is you are mediocre or garbage at your roll if your clinging to notion that you deserve loot more then others. No one is forcing you to stay with a guild you don’t agree with. There’s always a guild Out there that’s lacking good healers so as they say “get gud”.
---
I mean people will have to deal with PvP on any server the moment they chose a PvP server..
---
Why is this downvoted. Buy crystals and any important material when theyre lower than their average price and sell high. It doesnt take alot of time to make gold if you have a bit of an economic mindset. If youre farming the 2k gold i understand it mot being worth to sell obviously :). Half an hour of auctioning can get you really far after a couple of weeks
---
Less than a 0.004% chance of that happening. 
---
Happened [to me a while back](http://i.imgur.com/5URuZ7H.jpg?1).
---
Also, ain’t is not a word.
---
just lol @ u if you think across millions of players there is a significant skew like that  
---
This stuff has been polled across forums since the game came out and it routinely shows an even distribution of ages across the two factions.
---
How the fuck are you taking 16mins to do hydrospawn, what? Or am I misunderstanding. I know mages doing it in like 3 to 4 ish mins with just prebis basically
---
Too bad there are better bracers outside of raids for locks
---
Even though on retail there are ways of straight up talking to the other faction. There's a potion that lets you do it, and void elves can talk in thalassian to blood elves
---
Tanking is hard, but very rewarding. People who don't tank don't understand how difficult it can be.  It's something that keeps a lot of people from being willing to do it. However, I say stick with it.  You are going to fail again, it's going to happen.  Just keep going.  People are always going to want a tank.  
---
Some General tips for tanking. (I'm assuming you are a warrior)
---
Your job is to make sure the healer stays alive.  Then to make sure you stay alive.  Then worry about the dps.  Also know how much punishment different classes can take. I dont worry about hunters or other warriors/dps paladins.  They can easily tank a few hits from any trash mob.  If a dps dies, it's usually their fault for pulling threat.
---
Your second job is to lead the dungeon. 99% of the time, it's tanks job.  Part of that is setting the pace. (make sure the healer has enough mana to heal the next pull).  If you go too fast, the healer will struggle/oom, too slow, and people get bored.  Another part of this is knowing the pulls themselves, how to range pull, corner pull, group up mobs for aoe damage or threat.  If you are new to a dungeon, just ask, and people can help.  Yes, a gun/bow is absolutely essential for tanking! 
---
Marking/Kill Orders. This is usually your third job.  Mark a skull for the first kill target(a quick skull macro is awesome for this!). I recommend a caster. If i have some heavy burst or stun happy dps i wont even pull threat on it. Ill mark it, and let the dps just burst it down, while i get threat on the rest of the pack.  If you need a CC, mark them with other raid symbols.  However, a good dps class will know how and when to CC as necessary.
---
AOE threat.  The general rule is that AOE threat is not a thing in classic.  However, we sorta fake it.  Anything beyond 3 mobs though is always a mess though.  At low levels.  Charge&gt;Thunderclap, then defensive stance and drop both your shouts. Then get some threat on the skull, and sunder the other targets. If a mob gets lower in health, switch to the next priority and start building threat, and Skull it after the first one dies.    Later on you get whirlwind, cleave, sweeping strikes. All make AOE tanking easier...it's still f'n hard though. 
---
Don't give up, keep trying.  At 19 you just flat out don't have all the tools you need to tank yet, so it's honestly much harder at 19, then it will be at 40.
---
I did yes. I don't think it goes that far though?
---
GMs said they went through my restoration page as well.
---
Doing the same dungeon over and over again is more fun than PVP? Thats a HAAAAAARD disagree from me lol
---
&gt;So I consider myself fairly casual. 
---
You won't miss it at all.  Skull is an advanced item that will do more harm than good if you misuse it and needs foresight to even have it equipped when you need it.
---
Honestly, its not a big deal.
---
There are more kids on horde, being evil/douchebag one, and more adults on alliance for that irl rp. True story tho, will probably get downvoted for being realistic.
---
I would recommend no earlier than 22, but the higher level you are the easier it is/bigger pulls you can do. Here's the core build:
---

---
Elemental precision because if they resist a nova you're screwed. Frost warding because you're going to get hit a bunch and you're not going to be using frostbolt anyways. The improved nova is necessary to stay on rotation of nova blizz blizz nova. And of course improved blizz+permafrost to keep the mobs from ever reaching you. Also don't ever get frostbite in this build. Once you've got those talents, you can start. the basic idea is simple, gather em up nice and close to eachother &gt; Frost nova &gt; blizz from max range &gt; blizz from closer range &gt; frost nova and repeat. You want as much int and stam as possible on your gear,spell damage is not useful here.
---
Cheers, thanks for the explanation!
---
You're leaving the decision to quit or not up to the rng of an open roll system?  If you joined another raid guild right now you'd have gear within a month and your gaming experience would be in your hands.  I have no pity for your situation when there is a solution staring you in the face.  You want to be rewarded for your time?  Join a guild that rewards you for your time...
---
It's a "required" talent for threat generation and also to pave the way for Consecration.
---
Check out Icy Veins paladin tanking guide... It explains talent choices and rotation.
---
You're speaking of a different issue - faction imbalance. As alliance my queues are always instant anyway.
---
I really, really hate that there are addons that automatically scan the AH and INSTANTLY buy shit. There is not a person searching this sword every 10 seconds to see if there's a good deal. That shit needs to be removed.
---
Dungs ARE the fastest way to level once P2 hits.  A few corpse runs into brd takes 15-20 mins from tunnel to inst.  Compare that to being camped even once in the open world and being forced to take res sick.   Dungs are safer, have faster xp and drop better gear than trying to level solo open world in P2.    It's not even a contest tbh
---
\+25% armor from heal crits, +18% healing by healing wave and +10% healing across the board makes shaman healers very powerful.
---
Zoomers have short memory spans from all the vaped weed and ADHD meds, give it like a month and they'll move onto some new phrase to say the exact same thing.
---
Both legacy media and outrage media have already covered it so I think the bell curve has already passed its zenith
---
nope I've tried in the past, they respond to the ticket but won't restore the skill if you clicked unlearn yourself
---
Ouch. Sorry man. I wanted open roll too until I realized the implication.
---
That's not true, we're talking about a couple of racials that only need their numbers tweaked so they aren't ridiculous. A free PvP trinket and resisting 1/4 of the stuns thrown at you is nothing to scoff at.
---
OK cute but come back when you can say "Sylvannas did nothing wrong"
---
Holy shit you are a next level of cringe, big yikes.  Learn about reverse engineering and stop embarrassing your self.
---
"iTs ThE oRiGiNaL cLiEnT" Yea no its not :D :D :D :D:

I just came home from 14 days of work, and my cat was just happy to see me.

I masterlooted MC in vanilla for a year and only two bindings dropped.
---
Can skip farming Mara since two of the dm tribute rings are better for both ring slots (not unique) but do Mara for thrash blade quest
---
Youre probably a decent cashier.
---
Does depend a bit what u saying that tho.  Have seen the n word dropped this way too.  Sometime u reap what u sow
---
For the key and boxes it says you receive item and for the backpacks it says you receive loot. Why does it change?
---
If you get reported enough that blizzard start to notice it probably isnt "banter" anymore.
---
If you want cross-faction banter maybe a game where they literally don't speak the same language isn't for you.
---
Who said anything about pickpocketing?
---
PvP trinket for rogues removes fear as well. Orc is the master race for PvP.
---
Thanks for all this valuable information! I will definitely keep going
---
Yeah I said OK BOOMER in outlands the other day and got suspended
---
lol you seem upset
---
I agree with you. As gamers, we truly are the most oppressed race.
---
Bye sad boy 😘
---
What happens in the tavern stays in the tavern?
---
You are gonna wear SM mail for a long time.  The helm is a really good dps helm..and i've seen level 60 warriors wearing it.  WW axe is great, but you should be getting the Bonebiter axe from the SM quest line. You can replace the WW axe with it.   
---
I used Bonebiter until like level 50 when i got the Gaterbite axe.  Then that until 58 when i respec'd protection.
---
You cant be fire in MC tho, so might as well respec now :D
---
A lot of gamers think it's okay shouting racist/homophobic slurs because "that's just what happens when you're really into the game." A famous example of that was Pewdiepie calling some other guy the N-word on stream, and his fans said it's okay because it was a "heated gaming moment".
---
So now people who dare say that being a racist is not okay have come to call racist slurs 'gamer words' as a way to mock people who seem to think that screaming racist things into the mic is just something gamers do.
---
i know this is old but fury pretty much sits in berserker which means no overpower unless you manage to dump your rage leaving just whirlwind that is weapon based for fury which is a very small part of single target dps bloodthirst is based off attack power only

You are a warlock, you get invited to those groups....
---
theres 3 chest spawns, theres a chest in every single run in one of the 3 slots, can be locked or unlocked
---
the 3rd chest spawn is opposite to the door that you blast open with seaforium, in the left corner
---
Then you won't have any free transfers available so this call isn't for you.
---
But if you haven't had queues since forever but you are still layered and Blizz is offering free transfers... then "got no more queues" is not an accurate assessment.
---
How so? I'm just pointing out there are other reasons to be against intentionally breaking ToS than being offended. If you care that much about cross faction banter it's probably a good idea to play a game that doesn't forbid exactly that in it's ToS.
---
You should farm it at 60. For example, I doubt you can solo any of the BRD for Boreal Mantle before 60.
---
Didn't it come out that he didn't say the n word he just said two words that got mixed together. Or was that a different person
---
because no one has been banned for it besides people saying racists slurs lmao

Thank god I made an alliance alt on Incendius so if horde queues are bad for my prot warrior I can just marks hunter it up.

lasher farm is a waste of time, it was only good on pserver
---
No, its because blizzard decided to bring this OP green gear with spell dmg on it. This gear was not available in actual vanilla, back then you would be raiding in your t0.5 with only 23 spell dmg from set bonuses. Now you have green items with like +30 spell dmg.
---
There isn't. It scans for anything that is listed far below market value based on your previous scans.
---
This is how I have 2,400g at level 30. Don't hate the gamers, hate the poor souls listing dark iron ore bars with bidding at 20s.
---
Get epic mount
---
Not really "required" if you're just wanting to tank dungeons. The talent page on Icy is completely unnecessary if you're referring to the 11/31/9 page, you can tank just fine as 20/31 or even 30/21 while being more of a hybrid to heal as well
---
Even better when they add in 25g per run. Makes you *feel* like you put your hard earned cold cash to good use.
---
I’m so confused by this comment.
---
50+ is when you will start getting most of your bis gear. Brd and any dungeon after
---
that must be pretty awful g/hr.

---
All specs are viable... eventually with enough gear lol
---
The biggest reason and nerf to MC is bringing all the spell dmg gear. Back in actual vanilla you didnt have all these shitty "TBC" greens with spell dmg on them...
---
you can use the heroic strike queue bug, basically if you have heroic strike queued and ur mainhand is on cd ur offhand will have same hit% as ur mainhand
---
Mograine
---
These AOE groups are not about trying hard, but about beeing fast and efficient
---
Who won? I need answers!
---
Some things help later on as you level.  Sweeping Strikes at level 30 you should use on every single pull.  Basically Bloodrage&gt;Sweeping strikes on every charge if possible.  At 36 you get the fantastic combo of Sweeping Strikes and Whirlwind, which doe great AOE dps and threat, even with a 1h/shield.
---
When the legion sends its Orcs, they aren't sending their best. They're warmongers, warlocks, and some of them, I assume, are cooks.
---
That’s why I liked WoR Destro. It was both in one with multiple stages. Spend mana on Conflagrations to gain Backdraft, spend Backdrafts on Incinerates to gain embers, spend embers on Chaos Bolts for big damage!
---
Which time? cause the PUBG moment he definitely said it full stop.
---
Ah crap I needed it thinking it was BoE, now I realize I unknowingly was an ass. I mean nobody else needed, but still, it probably sells for some money.
---
[Judge for yourself.](https://youtu.be/J_bMArMJ-f8?t=35) It certainly sounds like it.
---
Head: spell power for pve, hp for pvp
---
Shoulders:  fire resistance/ resist all depending on your argent dawn rep
---
Cloak: for pure raiding fire resistance, but resist all is more useful in general
---
Chest: +4 stats, although mana would be a decent option for pve, and hp a decent option for pvp
---
Bracers: int for pve, stam for pvp
---
Weapon: spell power
---
Gloves: doesn't really matter do whatever
---
Legs: spell power for pve, hp for pvp
---
Feet: minor speed. Although if you want to be fancy you have one pair with minor speed and a second pair with stam and another with riding spurs
---
So memeing is punishable but having the mafia in ungoro is fine? Sounds about right
---
Source?
---
Maybe I’m not understanding this correctly, but why was this posted in this sub?
---
Gone for a warrior myself. 
---
Need someone to dump my cash into
---
You just dont understand the build thats all
---
To be fair, mana is really uninteresting system for a DPS class, in a raid perspective. It pretty much necessitates a system for regaining mana, like lifetap for warlocks (and mana drain though that's not viable) and evocation + mana gems for mages. For other classes it just means that there is a limit to how long you can DPS until you can't anymore... which is major reason why elemental shamans, boomkins and shadow priests are unviable in classic raiding and remained that way until they added a bunch of passive mana regen stuff like making shadow priests group mana batteries in TBC.
---
They did keep the system of using and regaining mana for arcane mages, and some warlock specs kept having to lifetap for a long while.
---
where did you all find these people?
---
Source? It also doesn't explain 10; Blizzard themselves said that layers were in single digit.
---
So every mage is frost huh? The reason doesnt matter
---
Why not? You and I aren't talking about the thread at all
---
Epic mount! The moat important thing you can buy at 60? Start saving all your money if you werent already
---
Go for the race you enjoy most to play. Picking a race because of how much advantage you have in pvp/pve is of course fine, it’s your choice. But imo try hard as hell. Enjoy the game, it’s vanilla bro
---
Whirlwind axe is fine but alternatives are Ravager from SM armory (compareable but better for AoE), then 2 drops from last boss in Uldaman (stoneslayer and something else), then Gatorbite axe from Croc boss in Maraudon.  After that you will be going for Ice Barbed Spear (if AV is released by then) or weapons from BRD if not (there are quite a few).  There are very few 2-handers that are decent via questing so unfortunately you need to do instances or be content with WW axe for a long time.
---
So far only his WoW content. Had a look at a smash video but got distracted - young kids
---
Because having a rotation that requires some degree of thought and can't be done by binding a button to the scroll wheel and twiddling your thumbs provides mental stimulation, perhaps even a degree of challenge... which is fun?
---
Seriously, people like you make me worry about the future of classic post phase 6. Classic has a ton of good features, brain dead rotations is not one of them. It is a fucking travesty that classes with 40+ abilities only use 1 of them while fighting a raid boss. Even people in 2005 who were more familiar with old school, often turn based RPGs when 'action RPG' was not an established term realized this and desired a more engaging playstyle, and I really hope apologists who refuse to see any faults in classic are ignored when it becomes time to expand upon the project.
---
Is there a problem with that?
---
His smash content is solid, I'd recommend you check out his Mario kart video.  It had me in tears
---
There is always a chest even if you kill everything.  Just get food/water/potions though, no gear.
---
Currently lvl 38, grats dude! Can’t wait to hit 60.
---
We know slowspoke.
---
i didnt said F blizzard , i said f them to players that cant pvp and complaining. Some people Death threating blizzard directly and they still spaming the forums with the same account... Insulting etc andn othing happens to them. I used censored word and not even againts blizzard! Im not here to convice you , whats the point of that?
---
Nowhere. They don't exist
---
Lol at the horde whining that the alliance is leaving while refusing to move themselves. Wouldn't want to give up that faction imbalance you hate so much, would you.
---
why are you posting this in the WowCLASSIC subreddit?
---
Definitely the best wow moment I have ever had. I enjoyed it much more than end game tbh.
---
And you'll be current boomer age
---
1 À € 1 1 Ä 2 ‡
---
That take some balls to say that the world pvp is better on pve server.
---
You still have to buy it manually.
---
It's alright, next time try putting forth a sensible reply.
---
Will do
---
Just wanna also add that if any hunter plans on using scatter shot at all, never buy Dwarven Hand Cannon or Heartseeking Crossbow/anything that has a damage proc, because it will proc after the stun and break every time it happens due to like 30 damage from the proc. Carapace Spine Crossbow from undead strat with the 3.3 speed is best for PvP hunters until you get Rhok'delar because of this I've heard. Damage proc ranged weapons are great in PvE though, but I wish Blizz would fix how the damage registers, because I don't think it was meant to interact with scatter shot how it does now. Already submitted a few bug reports after i wasted 20g on a Heartseeking Crossbow before having to vendor it back when i was lvl 52, because it literally procs 20% of the time...so 20% of the time I would get murdered by a rogue or warrior bc i couldnt get the distance I needed, or be unable to close distance on a caster with scatter to trap. This of course is irrelevant if you don't use scatter shot in the MM tree, but thought it would be useful to add so people don't waste money like me. I honestly see this as something being fixed soon, though, because it is definitely not a purposeful mechanic, just an oversight on how weapon procs would affect abilities that break on damage when the roll for the weapon proc happens *after* the actual effect of the ability.
---
Classic leveling is way harder than retail leveling. Have you leveled already?
---
Classic raiding is way easier than retail mythic raiding. And you have about 1.5 years of classic raiding in front of you.
---
Ouch
---
what it do
---
I love engineering but let's face it, most people chose it because some guides said "You HAVE TO be engineer and you also HAVE TO level it twice to have gnome bop and sappers!"
---
Lol. He 100% says it, no way around it.
---
Uberdanger does wow videos in a similar style as barny. 
---
Other than them I dont really know if anyone makes those types of videos.
---
It was. CLC (horde) was working with vampire clan (alliance) and Olympus (unbind + few others).
---
It's tryhard because without it, you stand no chance when you get jumped by an engineer in the open world.
---
Cheers, will check it out.
---
Different person, think it was some league player.
---
You could try, but you'd get resisted and need to rely on Vanish. That or wait 30 seconds to use distract on every mob before a pocket.
---
It would be too slow and tedious to be worth it.
---
Reliable, fast BRD pickpocket farming is usually an end game (or close to it) activity.
---
The Mace from Uldaman is very nice. You need to be lvl 42-43 though. Start questing in the badlands for the prequests. I kept that one till lvl 55.
---
Yikes. These names are getting out of hand. Why do I see people so many shits about "generations" lately?
---
I'll stick with classic
---
But its just a fact that edgy kids are more likely to roll horde together and gank poor defenseless aliance players! Source: me
---
Classic raiding is easier than even normal raiding lol. The only hard part about classic raiding is the fact that there are 40 people that can fuck up instead of 10/20
---
It is a Silicon Valley reference.
---
It's not that anyone thinks they are special. It's that tanks are playing the game for themselves, not to help out some randoms.
---
 If you have two options, a dungeon that drops absolutely nothing for you or a dungeon that has a chance at dropping something you can use, which do you pick? Obviously the one that has something you can use. 
---
But the dungeons that have nothing for tanks still need someone to tank them. How do you find pug tanks to do this for you without paying them? No one is going to tank for you as a charity case.
---
Thank you. I haven’t yet seen that show (believe it or not) and the comment was haunting me. Literally, haunting me.
---
So I'm not using the Twitch app but adding them manually, but I believe it does the same thing. Both Gathermate 2 and Gathermate 2 Data should be present as separate addons in your WoW interface folder and marked as active in your addons list in game. After that the data has to be manually imported inside the game - go to Interface Options &gt; Addons &gt; Gathermate 2 &gt; Import
---
You start using the weapon at time = 0 seconds. It procs at say 10 seconds into a fight. Now that you got your 100 mana, you switch to your regular weapon as the chance on hit is useless. Use regular weapon from t=10 seconds until 40 seconds into the fight, when the internal cooldown has run out. Switch back to the blade, use it until it procs again, repeat.
---
You can make your points without being snarky
---
Because all enemies have armor and resistances.
---
I got a 24 hour mute for doing this in classic. They enforce it
---
No need to downrank further if you don't run out of mana
---
Realm is still layered and had queue last Thursday. However since then it hasn't had a queue. Anyway, if created an ally alt on Heartseeker to play when queue hits on my main realm.
---
Idk, either if group asked for mana tide and he didn't have it, or if he and some party member use the addon "details" they can see each others' talents
---
Funnily enough it was generally always a thing, Im not sure what made it 10x more popular though. I noticed it a lot when classic was coming out, people referring to themselves as boomers for liking an “old” game.
---
There were also the 30 y/o boomer memes preceding that.
---
sweeping strikes into whirlwind, everything dead.
---
Yes you can.
---
&gt;~~Probably~~ all of em are lonely dudes sitting infront of the monitor....
---
At no point did I say  “fuck you horde, you guys did this shit” or anything of the sort.
---
I just pointed out that people dont like to play games that are unfun to them, if you take everything as an attack. Thats on you.
---
One of our holy priests has embarrassed more of our guildie mages than they'd care to admit.
---
It's looks like I'm wearing, nothing at all!
---
Why would you need a tank?
---
i would love to see some rage against this. Could you please link such amazing situation?
---
Well no, they just wont run the dungeon. And anybody can reserve orbs, but rarely will nontanks fill a group if they do.

How much time do you spend doing this on average? Just curious whether time or „skill“ in this is the more important factor.
---
The reason doesn't matter... Winged words from pepegas on /r/classicwow
---
Or, just an idea. Play it solo as intended. It is not that hard. Just downrank nova and renew.
---
Did you think we had forgiven?!?!
---
shaman vs a bot
---
Isn't that the same as the full mage spellcleave tho.
---
So I have my 12 buttons bound to num pad 0-9 and then I think + and -. Buttons 1-7 as well as ctrl 1-7 are all abilities I commonly use, some of those have shift modifiers as well (for example 3 is CoA, ctrl 3 is CoR, shift 3 is rank 1 CoR). 8-11 and ctrl 8-11 is for swapping trinkets and gear. 12 is my deathcoil button lol. I guess you could say I primarily play with my right hand
---
Is there a way to still you the self cast modifier (in my example alt) with a makro?  
---
it appears like using a makro disables that function. My makro looks like this:  
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast [mod:shift] Heilen(Rang 3); Große Heilung  
---
Sorry for the german but you see that the second one is greater healing and the first one is the normal healing.
---
Unlike the sissy boi ally's i dont need a group of 5 to beat up on others... Im my own one man army son.  U have a good time w/ ur foot jammed in ur mouth real nice and hard there, cuz looks like it aint coming out anytime soon
---
Do arena runs with golemlord, and randomly whisper healers starting from lvl 53.  Thats how i got my sgc after 120 runs.  No gold is needed
---
Our first ever ony we had 2 bags drop
---
I've never once had that happen to me no matter how I pull them.  I've had dozens of people report that they only started having the issue when they got 5pc.    
---
Last night I got my 5pc and tried it myself.  I aggro'd the same way I always do and they linked aggro for the first time in my hundreds of runs.  Seems pretty apparent that it's the 5pc :)
---
Once phase 2 officially releases and everyone that did stop comes back for it, we should see queues. The servers that end up with queues we could automatically assume are full and could get a rough estimate of population no? (I'm just spitballing)
---
Either way, the news is awesome. Haven't played since wrath for more than a few days here and there and here I am still having a blast with no second guessing on my subscription.
---
They did what now?
---
Feral tank.  I have about 20 slots taken up by healing/DPS gear.  Still love the class, though.
---
Nothing at all
---
The reason why I don't like getting +1 on both Tier and Offtier is that a large chunk of classes simply don't benefit at all from Tier gear, so you're basically giving some classes twice the amount of things to roll on with no cost.
---
you do princess runs, u run to the last boss and dot her up and kite her in a big circle until she dies. Then you get blue items you can sell to a buyer for the hit ring, or just vendor/d/e them.
---
I’m also curious, I think there’s a way to work it out on this spreadsheet calculator that’s available on the classic rogue discord server but I haven’t figured it out yet
---
Shadow craft 5 set bonus is super strong. Head/chest/bracer/belt/boots then truestrikes and devils and you’re set
---
This man is clearly a lair only people that play wow are already married or have no social life there is no in between.  
---
/s
---
Playing fury, bring my offtank gear to every raid too and I'm lucky to hit 20 free slots haha
---
i have it, in my bank. Never use it
---
Yeah man that’s tough, levelling a pala alt rn and just having a healing set on me is a big ball ache. I suppose it’s the trade off for the flexibility!
---
No.
---
it was just an example. mooncloth bag suffers the same and its essentially BiS as far as bags are concerned. only one person so far has bottomless and he knows it; charging 400 per bag. but it isn’t about the bags. its all items in general. the point is, its a race to the bottom for all things that aren’t raid-bis related items such as freezing ring or arcanite crystals. the general rule is, if it isn’t raid-bis related, you can earn a few coppers just buying the item from AH and selling to vendor. not efficient, but profitable none the less.
---
Yeah obviously, because actual spellcleaving is done without a tank. Getting invited means nobody has a clue what they are doing.
---
Ok
---
That’s the definition of ungoro mafia
---
It's political. It shouldn't be, but it is. It stopped being just a meme right out the gate. People take it very seriously.
---
And im one of em!
---
I'm sorry I confused the minima in the instance with the large map... My mistake
---
Because Blizz honestly doesn't give a shit about what happens on PvP servers. There's so much awful shit that goes on there that Blizzard just can't handle without it being a PR nightmare.
---
I think it depends on where you are. So for example I've seen it strike in the bank to everyone around me but I've also noticed it didn't strike (yet everyone recieved the buff) in Thrall's chamber.
---
So take off my cadaverous and put on shadow set minus the shoulders and devilsaur? What about helm I don’t have the head for the set so I’m stuck at 4 piece do I use eye of rend or use the mask unforgiven
---
MadSeasonShow has some pretty good stories ranging all the way from vanilla to.. well not sure how far his story has been going. I'd give that a watch, nostalgia all around and we can almost all relate.
---
It isnt. I haven't seen one in 2 weeks.
---
Are we getting an update/part 2, or...? 😂
---
This should be higher up. These boxes get dropped by killing mobs. The junk boxes only contain rogue ingredients
---
I guess
---
The horror!
---
I respecced SM/DS for Solo Farming dungeons, works great for Mara/DM:E
---
And is way better than SM/Ruin for regular mob-farming, however, I think It's slightly weaker than SM/Ruin in PvP
---
But It will still work
---
PvP; SL/SMruin/SM-ds
---
My opinion ofcourse, with SMRuin being the most fun in my opinion
---
Yeah, it sucks when that happens, but I tell myself "I guess I'm just paying for more spreadsheet data!" and it makes me feel better. lol
---
LFM GOR’SHAK EXP FARM MAGE ONLY NO WARLOCKS
---
What i am saying is that I (and many other players) don’t care too much about pulling aggro as dps. Yes it makes the life of healer and tank slightly more stressful, but you gain it back in efficiency and time spent in the dungeon. 
---
I tank a lot leveling up and as a tank I use taunt on CD. Taunt is a wonderful ability as it sort of reset threat. 
---
I have never used threat meter in my entire wow career. I did try it once and I felt that it was disturbing. I felt I played a control room game and I hated it. I even raided without it. Yes for hardcore gameplay it’s probably helpful, but I don’t play hardcore anything.
---
Honorable kill for anyone within like 10 lvls of you
---
Dishonorable kill for any grey character you kill
---
Must be server per server how much they enforce, Ive never been suspended for it. Do it regularly with" love you " to stop me getting ganked while leveling
---
About as good as it gets for most Hunters. He's a cat so he gets 10% more average damage (tied for the most damage with Raptors) as well as Claw (great focus dump!) and Prowl and Dash. You can feed it meat and **fish** so it's very cheap to feed.
---
I posted something for like 20s below vendor accidentally and LITERALLY the second I posted it it was bought. You’re telling me that someone happened to be scanning for that item and clicking “buyout” faster than I can even go to my “auctions” tab?
---
After biggest increase sadly will come biggest decrease
---
Assuming my equivalency point calc is correct, 2/2 Devilsaur should be [superior](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/92ZvFS3fGvxrS2sp4kHFky/compare/jbQWrRVBzrLqFv4V6Sa9vm) to Cadaverous/Truestrike.
---
Yeah if you aren’t getting the shadow 5 set use cadaverous chest and truestrikes. Getting your minimum hitcap is super important for your dps in raids and extra hit helps damage still as it reduced the damage lost from glancing blows
---
SM/DS is what? Sorry dont remember what DS stands for
---
What server is that? That seems worryingly dead
---
I just don't understand why it's a big deal when pewds does it when other youtubers seem to get a pass and it's just a word and the context it was used wasn't racist.
---
mind to give the specific rule for that?
---
The supply of devilsaur has increased with the introduction of 1 layer 7 minute spawns, while the demand has decreased. Price has gone down on many servers.
---
Ich hatte das Komma vergessen! Jetzt geht es WUHU!
---
So 4 set shadow with devilsaur set? Over cad?

Shadow mastery and demonic sacrifice
---
I am warming up to the Korean/Chinese method of bidding gold.
---
Item drops, gold is bid, highest bidder takes the item, gold is distributed to every member as a reward/dkp at the end of the raid, with the guild taking a cut I am sure.
---
Provides the guild with raid funds
---
Provides guild members with a tangible reward even if they did not get an item
---
Promotes out of raid play so people log in for more than just raid nights.
---
TFBlade iirc. He said something along the lines of ‘You are an idiot’. With his accent and, some people heard the N word instead of ‘an idiot’
---
Now you can finally play the game
---
With phase 2 imminent is it likely the Gurubashi Arena on PvE servers will be far MORE contested, as the only guaranteed source of honour?    
---
Basically have I missed the boat on getting an Arena Grand Master on a twink? 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
I think it's worth waiting to see if it's a flop before paying for a new expansion, not just regarding the cost for you personally, but also to avoid encouraging bad content from Blizzard. 
---
Wait a month or two after Shadowlands releases, Classic's content isn't that hard but it's pretty long and grindy, so there'll be plenty to do in Classic while people in retail react to the new expansion beyond the common knee-jerks of "NEW CONTENT, THIS IS AWESOME" and the uncritical negative ones too. Don't pay attention to pre release and day one reviews, the real game only settles in several weeks after people have had the chance to experience endgame content.
---
&gt; Kids want to be the "hero" which horde isn't.
---
Assuming your argument is even valid, which it isn't, and Horde are the "bad guys" then absolutely more kids would go for that. Do you not understand why Grand Theft Auto's sales are through the roof?
---
You don't, you only get a dishonorable kill from killing civilians.
---
Got it; thanks.
---
They actually altered the spawn rate of them, though? Devilsaurs specifically? Or is this some kind of thing where they changed mob spawns across the board to cope with layering removal?
---
Wrong shoulders. The white mail shoulders provide way more damage reduction than that 30hp.
---
At this day and age where fight takes less than 1 minute.  Yes they are viable
---
Both sets linked are using 6/8 Shadowcraft as a baseline.
---
schön, dass ich behilflich sein konnte :)
---
So you're kind of asking ally to stay in a situation that sucks for them to solve your problem, while you don't want to move into a situation that sucks for you to solve your problem.
---
Skeram will not suddenly become balanced if Alliance stops moving to Heartseeker. Heartseeker horde-side won't suddenly become able to sustain a large raid population if Alliance stops moving to Heartseeker.
---
Skeram will only become balanced and stop the bleedout of ally if horde move Heartseeker. Heartseeker horde will only be able to raid if Skeram horde move Heartseeker. But we better whine about the alliance instead, it's safer.
---
How would you guys go about farming Skul for the wand?
---
Main entrance, or side entrance?
---
Dude im sorry but not everyone finds leveling the fun part of the game.. If you enjoy it, I envy you because I wish I could. But farming the same mob for 30 min hoping I get a item with a .01% drop rate for a quest isnt very fun or rewarding to me personally. It's just tedious. I wanna hit 60 and grind for gear that im excited about and PVP.
---
Why zg?
---
Oh so 30/21 I remember that spec from back in the day. Thanks.. my first so I can get a few if needed. I think I’ll start with 20/31/0 as phase 2 is around the corner and in 5 mans no one is gonna kick you for having less than optimal dps spec. I love feeling tanky in pvp so this should feel good
---
Yes. TSM is scanning the first page constantly. It'll notify him and he has to click buy, to buy it manually.
---
You can tell that's not true by just reading farther into this thread.
---
Side entrance for sure? If you can target him from the entrance I would spam reset untill you get him then start a group from there. 
---
Or even better buy a wand of shadow wrath off AH, that's better, and save yourself the trouble.
---
I'm in danger
---
it's not. tanks are more in demand. 
---
this isn't opinion but fact
---
If only Google existed and had info for where to go. Honestly if someone can't ask for help or quickly Google something they don't know if be reluctant to trust they will be very good. That being said, you don't need very good players all the time
---
Other way around for the GG portal
---
if youre a playing a popular class you just need a guild and make groups with them.  isnt hard
---
Meanwhile everyone just ignores the guy with the Earthshaker
---
Sadly you have to clear a full pack before you can head to the tunnel and /target him
---
Max rank poison has way more than 40 charges and usually lasts the full 30 minutes, sometimes less.

Hmm that smells like regular.  She needs Premium, dude! PREMIUM! DUUUUUDE!

I was thinking about this the other day when I complimented a rogue on his diaper pants
---
Yeah that’s not allowed
---
Yep! There were none on the auction house and I volunteered to meet the guy in Darnassus since he was farming Marauadon and had his hearth there. I guess he appreciated the gesture
---
Broxigar is the greatest hero. Change my mind.
---
Yeah which is an actual epic, while the hand of rag is legendary
---
this spider terrified me. I'm not keen on spiders irl, but i'm fine with spiders in game, but this super huge and always moving scarlet spider was unnerving
---
yes, I used to be in a farm group for them, they changed the spawn time from around 15 minutes to around 5 minutes, the supply is not worth controlling because it's too high
---
Oh man dude...that's absolutely brutal.
---
Which nameplate addon is this ? Thx
---
I loot those every time I see them on my warrior.  Holy Water is so effin good for threat.  
---
Then I hand out the mana potions/water to the casters
---
Neither is Jay-walking
---
i would definitely check at least once or twice for each time interval.
---
also the guild vs guild skirmishes are very fun :P lots of smacktalk and light teasing going on.
---
i just realized layering will be shut off aswell. so it 100% will be at least a bit harder.

Standard crusader fee is like 5g from anyone who isn’t in guild / a buddy on my server. 10g for such an easy pattern seems wack
---
Retail might look nice but it's still ass.
---
One of my friends had the name Ephixi and wanted a name change. Another friend reported him saying ephixi means  'someone who has sex with horses' in his language. The guy who issued the report got a 2-3 day ban.
---
I’d check out the future enchants that will be released, and invest in those mats? Future crafting patterns for all professions are probably a good place to start looking. 
---
Best flip I’ve heard of so far is someone buying as many golden pearls as he could as everyone was leveling, 1-2g each on average. The pearls are now 40g+ each and he has several hundred. He had some private server experience and knew the price was gonna flop when the masses hit 60.
---
Maybe raw mats or the crafted items for AQ turn ins?
---
Holy fucking shit thats waaaaaaay more than I expected.
---
Seriously. People are pissed at the boomers for destroying the future for those under 30 and their children.
---
One, it is one run, where four orbs drop back to back and I get none of them.   Glad I tanked that one.
---
4/8 Shadowcraft + devilsaur + cadaverous chest + truestrike
---
This is the thing that always got me. "Vanilla had such a vibrant and great community". Really? Did we play the same vanilla? Because the community back then had just as many assholes and shitty people as retail has now, and they had to be shitty to their own servers instead of to a wider audience.

No its spell dmg, theres a healing weap enchant
---
You can do super well in PvP with just dungeon BiS gear, you're tough pressed to get raid gear.
---
Most of it isn't that good for you, and the pieces that are good for you are also good for every other caster in the game
---
its always in Lion's Pride. That inn may look cozy and innocent on the outside ... but those walls have seen some serious shit going on there
---
Do you have good aoe tanking gear ?   
---
And when i say that i mean, items with "thorns" effect on them and sheild spikes. Because that helps and that is how to do it.
---
Hi, /u/confusedgnome

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/duaa42/best_eu_pve_or_pvp_server/).
---
You can try marking one target as skull and request they focus one that one target before aoe starts. 
---
Otherwise, aoe tanking on a warrior is just annoying.
---
They don’t. OP is either omitting info or has run into a bug.
---
Does it? Time to remove my “you’re an evil Korean” macro
---
People are super good at confirmation bias. They start with the assumption that classic = good and retail = bad. Then any negative behaviour from players on retail means that retails = bad, but when negative behaviour is on classic they go "no it's retail players fault!!!"
---
Then there's the "wow someone bought my item and returned it to me because I was underpricing it! Such saintly behaviour is obviously unique to classic!" Lmao give me a break.
---
So damage is the wrong term then, gotcha
---
I grew to hate that spot so much lol. Between same faction mages that would rather fuck up your pulls instead of sharing and opposing faction mages fighting you for turf its such a shit show. 
---
Hands down my least favorite place to aoe farm so far.
---
Ya it's called a pvp server. Google it bro
---
Female human has the best animations tbh. Also, they generally looks good in all armour
---
Wrong. Dexamphetamine increases short term memory span and cognitive processing speed, even in neurotypicals. That's why it's prescribed for ADHD, SLDs and sometimes ASD etc. It's hard enough for people who need them to get and take their meds safely in the US, without this stigmatising nonsense. It's got nothing to do with weed or memes.
---
Idk how good it will be at 60, but at 25 I charge, thunderclap, defensive stance, bloodrage, then tab cleave for aoe. Tab sunder also works.
---
SM/Ruin is a sweet specc, you can Raid, PVP and farm Mara in the same specc.
---
If you outgear dungeons you can swap in somr damage gear to improve your dps and threat generation.
---
I have skullflame shield and negle ring for my dungeon set should I have more?
---
If you sunder all of them. Its not your foult
---
I wouldn't go too deep into shadow until you hit 40, honestly. Disc/Holy isn't bad (with spirit tap, of course) and you can get crazy fast exp once you can start doing Scarlet Monastery.
---
&gt;I'd do a better job ... due to my game knowledge
---
&gt;If you do not get the right items from the right quests, you're down for a turn in hell.
---
So you have to itemize perfectly, you need scholo gear to tank BRS, and you need better knowledge to outperform face=&gt;keyboard warriors? I kind feel like that's covered by:
---
&gt;you can make it work with overgearing and effort.
---
A very nice dwarf priest buffed me with Fear Ward a couple of days ago, so I healed them in return. It made me really happy as a priest. Thanks for sharing!
---
Now it just looks like a mud puddle in the grand canyon. 😉
---
He wants us to see his server has 10 players
---
do you happen to be a gnome? maybe even gnome mage? those are KoS for most of us
---
The enchant is called spell power only the tooltip says damage which is yeah bad tooltip but classics full of that shit.
---
I'm typing quickly not proof reading you. You take an example with 3 sets of yours, one with an accidental e on the end and use that as proof I'm dumb. That's the most pathetic strawman yet.
---
&gt; This is assuming you're adding more and more parameters to your dps equation
---
The fuck are you talking about? This is a *simplified* example.
---
&gt; Your conveniently crafted example
---
So you admit that my example is an example of something being exponential.
---
&gt;  has got nothing to do with what you said earlier.
---
Yes it does, because very few classes get spell haste, and boomkin gets 0.5 off their next cast from crits. So they have haste and thus are more exponentially growing off stats.
---
I'ma block you now since you will never admit you were wrong and are a waste of time.
---
i feel that giving more debuff slots (even 32) and buffing boss hps would already help a bit.
---
Actually I don't even know what happened. First I thought I had lost him beause I took a gryph (which would dissmiss the pet that was already at 0 happiness) but no man, I just hearthstoned back and logged out. Then came back and boom where he at? IDK
---
But all safe I got him AGAIN after some trouble with a troll hunter trying to tame him too.
---
If you’re doing your sunders and everyone is on the same target, you’re fine. If people attack a different target than you are, they’re asking to pull aggro, I don’t multi-dot most of the time as a lock because I’ll just pull aggro from warriors on the non-main targets.
---
101 101 is zug zug.
---
In terms of gold per hour compared to just about every other method of farming gold, it's absolutely minuscule. I do it though because I spend a tremendous amount of time reading and writing as part of my program at school, so I am unable to farm. At least this way I can afford my raid consumables by picking up a few pennies every once in a while between pages
---
I think they closed transfers to it recently.
---
With demonic runes and major mana pots - I can safely say as a moonkin player I go oom on maybe 5% of total end game bosses (MC and Ony).
---
Ok Google.
---
did they really changed this many mechanics in BFA ?
---
larval acid went from a few silver to 3-5g a piece when dm was anounced
---
I play elemental as MS and theres no problem healing any dungeon really. You shouldn't think twice about joining groups as a healer. In this case the lock is probably the flaw in ur group. You will still have a slight mana problem in the longer fights and especially if you need to spam lesser healing wave..
---
If ur going resto, do it at 58 at the earliest.
---
Kind regards Shocky the shaman
---
Idk but I thought about it seriously. I mean, I logged out without dismissing him and when logged back he was missing already.
---
I think you missed the point, people AoE grind to skip the boring part to get to raiding and PvP.
---
Omg. I actually feel you man.
---
Someone else confirm sit crit working?
---
Get a priest with mind vision to help out maybe.
---
Vsco grrrrrrrrl
---
Hoping to see more mage loot for our raiders. Another Eye drop would be nice as well, we had awful Eye luck.
---
As for myself, willing to trade heals for your bag space. GL with your raid hope you get want.
---
Farming it yourself doesn't make it free. If you learn the enchant that means you can't sell it for 200g.
---
That's what happens 100% of the time I lose agro. I wasn't sure if other warriors had that problem aswell or if dps haven't learned to chill out for a sec. I really dont mind losing agro especially if the dps are destroying mobs then fuck yeah more power to them but when a mage or hunter get wrecked every pull it makes me feel like I'm part of the problem. Maybe I'll just have to say at the start of the dungeon to hold off while I get agro. I feel like I shouldn't have to say this if every dungeon they should be doing the same.
---
Maybe you just need 3k upvotes
---
There's some consumables that help too.
---
Bombs, immolation oil, there's a food that makes you shoot fire from your mouth.  There's a shield from plague lands quest that has a chance to increase your chances to block by like 50% for 10 sec, then swap to a shield with a spike when it procs.
---
 
---
Depends on how much money you want to invest in dungeon running.
---
I dw tank dungeons fury specced and put on a shield when needed. Its pretty decent for aoe aggro.Anoter good tip is berserker rage is best tank cd for aggro since you generate alot of rage from it.
---
This quest felt really bad. :(
---
That's why I said "give it a try" nothing is at stake doing it
---
Dont use the prebis, get Devilsaur set, 6 shadowcraft (rogue set), mark of Fordring (quest), Blackhands Breadth (quest), Rune of the guard Captain (quest if horde), Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas (quest if alliance), buy 2 Tarnished elven ring from a hunter that solos DM tribute (price varies per server) for weapons get Trash Blade (quest) and Mirahs song (quest).
---
These are items that you either buy with gold or have minimum competition or are just gotten from quests and with these you will be able to conpete and even outdps most prebis rogues if you buy consumables in raids.
---
I top dps in MC on several fights as a rogue and I still use 6 Shadowcraft (dagger rogue with Perditions Blade and Core hound tooth). We clear MC in under 2 hours now.
---
Bullshit. As a priest, or every other mana class when there's no mage, I have to buy waters. Hell, even if there is a mage in the group, the amount of damn mages that literally give you 20 pieces of fucking water when you ask for it is too damn high, expecting that to last the entire instance. So I have to go to IF and pay mages for 6 stacks anyway. Warriors don't.
---
I also chug major mana potions like it's no one's business when the tank makes an ass-pull, which he Always does. Especially warriors who charge in on the battle mage pack right before the last room in Strath, pulling the left room group as well as the pat on the right. Those mana pots cost 2-3g a pop. And if I don't, people die.
---
Repairs and gold have shit all to do with anything. Playing a main tank in vanilla, I always felt bad for everyone else. Because as the tank, I got baby sat with heals during heavy pulls while everyone else died.
---
It's literally a different action in this universe (asking for gold up front vs promising an unknown green that may/may not drop that the payer may have lost the roll on anyway) and it has different results. Theres no mental gymnastics, they're two different things despite the similarities.
---
Thank you for the quick reply. Good to know!

Did you just say WHITE MAIL?!?!?!?!?!?!?
---
So?
---
My guild is at 5/20 MCs and most guilds I've talked to are at about a 25% drop rate too... Seems way way higher.
---
it'S the other way around
---
What does Broken Tooth rare pet has that makes him so special (except dash 1)?
---
What? Why? Shouldn't 1% hit increase your actual crit chance by 1% of your current crit chance, e.g. your crit chance is 15% then 1%hit would increase your crit chance by 0,15% because that's how many crits you would miss less?
---
Id take less pushback on heals any day, since there are probably tons of situations where youd want to heal yourself or party members while tanking dungeons.
---
The 15% damage increase only helps threat generation single target very slightly (like 3/4 extra holy damage per swing using 2.6 spd wep). If you just use judgment and consecrate its more than enough.
---
Funny I remember locks shitting on everyone in pvp. In Naxx, especially on the Heigan dance the low fps wasn't helping. What boggles my mind nowadays is how do some people still mess up in MC (not due to lack of gear or hardware). As in if they would just read a wowhead guide they wouldn't be so clueless.
---
Does warrior have any ability that can interrupt casting? Either in PvP or PvE situation? If yes, what is it and at what level can I learn it? Right now there's just shield slam, which is quite inconvenient to use since it requires defensive stance and a shield. By the time I've shifted both my stance and my weapons I'd be already hit by two fire balls or whatever.
---
Oh it's without a doubt a fenomenal place to farm on ideal conditions, problem is you will never get ideal conditions for more than 5m on my server.
---
I still farmed there for a while, but it was so annoying at times.
---
It is the hardest. It's just that simple.
---
I accidentally unlearned max level eng and a Gm full restored for me

Where did you get the 1.5?
---
According to petopia it's 1.3, making it significantly better
---
Imaging actually having retail installed.
---
Not really asking ally to do anything.  Skeram already screwed and wont get better.  Its why I made a hunter alt that is getting close to 60 on Incendius for PvP reasons.  My main on skeram is a prot warrior so TBH idc that much if anything having a PvE server is better.  Just telling Horde/explaining the reasoning why Horde guilds wont move.  At best you will have individuals or PvP guilds move that don't care about being able to replace raiders who leave over time.  So yes, ideally you just take half of the Horde on Skeram and all have them transfer to heartseeker (assuming Blizz doesn't stop the transfers halfway stranding half of them and breaking guilds apart) and make 2 relatively balanced but slightly horde dominant servers (similar to what Skeram was originally before transfers).

Shadow helm bracers belt and boots + cadav truestrike and devilsaur. Shadowcraft 6 set isn’t worth losing out on the raw stats of devilsaur or cadaver chest

~~Nice misrepresentation of someone's argument though.~~ Sorry mean *ok boomer*
---
&gt;Honestly if a girl cant take me gaming, then I'd be happy she is away.
---
That's a very broad statement. If you game a few hours a day besides spending some time with the girlfriend. Then yes, she has to be able to take it. 
---
But if you play games all hours if the day and never bat an eye to your girlfriend, you're just an addict and she would deserve better.
---
Its WC, nobody is caring about meta.
---
I feel ya. I am in the same boat until I made sure that I mark every pull and even have macro for marking on mouse key binding.
---
One thing that I learn for classic dungeon, there are mob that does not need to be "tank". Since most of our migration are armour, a lot of the caster mob can just be tank by melee DPS while skull being burn down.

Nice epic mount!

---
You won't top the meter for long, right now SP is almost at its best due to the 10% hit talent, when other classes catch up you'll fall behind. But that's not an issue as you aren't brought to the raid for your dps.
---
For gear: There isn't a lot of stuff you want for PVE dps in MC/Ony. The biggest ones are: Rags neck/Sash of Whispered Secrets/Sapphiron Drape/Toep/ Anathema and maybe some spell power rings. 
---
 Attending raids while passing a lot should shows your guild that you're commited and therefor deserving of rolling on items you really need. (For example I could roll for Anathema when no healing priest had benedection yet, that's all because I never made any fuss about loot and have a 95% attendance on top of being helpful with guildies, even the healing priests want me to roll because I helped them farm their eye of shadow for example)
---
MP5 is alright but it will become more relevant later on. Atm the MP5 gear is a bit weak. Let's be honest: For MC/Ony just get Major mana pots/demonic runes and you'll be fine.
---
When your fellow priest have a good amount of gear, you should start getting T1 pieces if you have any interest in PVP as for now it's the best for it.
---
Wow bosses are down in 10-20 sec :D 10 with rogue 20 without

Hey, if you submit a support ticket it can't hurt right? You might get it back, or find out why it happened and how to avoid it in the future?

It's just being selfish and being a hypocrite playing the majority faction (Horde on most realms). Reroll Alliance and be the change you want to see in the world.

Internment isn't slavery.

The orcs committed countless warcrimes and destroyed whole kingdoms, and you want to cry about them being locked up after? Not enslaved, just locked up?  You know, the Alliance of Lordaeron broke up because Terenas showed mercy and refused to just execute each and every one of you? The Horde owes its whole existence to King Terenas. But well, Horde plying the victim is nothing new. Don't you get tired of that, acting like you're big and tough, but then you turn around and cry about how UNFAIR the humans are being?
---
Retail?

---
Eh. I'm calling bots.
---
ich glaube das war \[mod:shift\]\[mod:alt,target:player\] Heilen; \[mod:alt,target:player\] große Heilung
---
grundsätzlich musst dus jedesmal reinschreiben, da der modifier mit dem ";" endet, aber ich bin mir nicht 100% sicher in welcher art und weise. ( evtl \[alt\] \[shift\] \[player\] oder \[alt,shift,player\] oder so wie ichs oben geschrieben habe.)
---
musst evtl etwas trial and error benutzen. es funktioniert auf jedefall in einer der schreibweisen :D.
---
your rotation is bad. dont ever use thundercrap, unless its a boss. usw ww instead. also use battleshout, when hitting all party members its more threat than demoshout.
---
the spec isn't helping either, if you mitigate too much damage you will be ragestarved.
---
I’ve been called this a by an alli, it made me chuckle :)
---
the whole reason they increased the spawn time during classic is to patch out devilsaur mafia
---
That's what sounds fun for me too. Still not sure if I'll get it or not... But the leveling sounds like a great way to experience what I never did.
---
Better starting areas? Mulgore is alright, the rest sucks. Elwynn, Teldrassil and Dun Morogh are far superior.

I don’t agree with the idea of going 5 points into SoR and then skipping SoC if you are going into the ret tree anyways, that just seems absurd to me. SoC has a higher damage output even with 5 points in SoR. I’m just curious, and I might be missing something here, but, why did would you do that?

Huh, cheers!

Blizz retconned some stuff about the Wrath Gate. Now they're saying Sylvanas knew of the plan to betray Horde and Alliance and just didn't do anything to stop it. Fuck the Forsaken.
---
It's the life version of "I didn't do it" in the simpsons, anytime I read it I just know to avoid speaking to that person as they are probably a fucking moron, the funniest part is that 99% of actual boomers probably have no idea all these kids are running around saying this dumb shit.
---
Lol no
---
Yeah, no. That orc can resist all he wants, he's perpetually slowed and definitely won't mow down "your entire party". That's the Alliance warriors job with Blessing of Freedom.
---
The last biggest quarterly increase was about 2.5 million I think, so assuming the mean in absolute terms, more than 2.5 million people subbed to play WoW:Classic, which doesn't surprise me in the slightest.
---
As an orc you should stick with axes for as long as possible. The extra hit you get from your racial gives you a lot of flexibility for your other gear slots, an advantage only orcs have on the horde faction which lets you wear more mitigation gear and generate better threat.
---
They're all pretty gear dependant but I suppose mage.

Pretty sure somewhere in the 60s to early/mid 80s(depending on source) is gen x. You dont get to replace it with a spiffy name like gen y(millenial). Although I tend to fell mid 70s to mid 80s combined x and y and should really be it's own thing.
---
What I've found is binding them by element: Fire is F, Earth is V, Water is Y, and Air is C. Obviously this can be whatever, but then you bind the different ones to different modifiers, like Tremor is Ctrl V, Stoneskin is Alt V, SoE is Shift V. Stoneclaw I put as the default on my totem timer tray, which almost functions as another action bar; I don't have to use it that often so I can just click it. Earthbind is naked V because it's the most important to have on a key that you can't fat finger. Do this with all the other totems and you'll have it memorized before too long; you'll have some left in the cold but they're mostly garbage like Flametongue totem that would be a waste of a binding anyway.
---
I heard the first guy who ever made it to rank 14 had one hell of a gaming chair. As someone with a mere IKEA office chair, I don't expect to make it past rank 10.
---
Apparently the older folks are calling Gen Z "Doomers" because certain climate activists are scaring them with "doom and gloom talk". Just uninspired.
---
If you're already that beefy, start with threat abilities, once you have established threat on the mobs and the kill target (skull) gets nuked by DPS, do the demo shout and thunderclap. Thundeclap is more of a damage mitigation tool, because its threat is pitiful, demo shout is decent, but won't cut it in a level 60 dungeons to hold threat.
---
My rotation looks as follows:
---
\- charge -&gt; mid charge zerker rage -&gt; defstance -&gt; bloodrage -&gt; shield slam -&gt; revenge -&gt; one sunder on each mob -&gt; thunder clap if necessary (if they do a lot of damage like the ghouls in Strat: UD)
---
A proper major mana pot + demonic rune rotation will see you through longer fights easily. On the outliers you mentioned (nef, twin emps) gear swaps are made to make mana regeneration a priority while retaining as much spell damage as possible. Those two bosses are the exception, not the rule, and adjustments can be made to make them reasonable.
---
Then there's our guild priest, by the name of priesty, lucky son of a bitch, did the impossible he went in there for something else helping some mage, 3. Yes 3. 3 what? 3 savage gladitor chains, surely not in a row right? Well 2 of them dropped in a row and the 3rd on 6th lockout after waiting. Lucky ass bastard not only did he get 3 in 6 tries, but 2 in a row. So I asked him to run me through (I'm one of the tanks) dropped second try. I did have to do about 50-60 runs for hoj tho.
---
I know man. I 100% understand you saying this. I felt the exact same way whenever I read one of these before I always 100% assumed the guy was guilty and didn’t even care for their explanation. Now that I’m on the other side of the fence, all I can say is it’s brutal. 
---
Be careful if you ever go travelling, I really wouldn’t take chances after reading about multiple other people being affected by this

You give an awful lot of credit to some random people on social media. And you seem invested in that topic to an unhealthy degree. Need help?

this sub sucks

It’s most definitely not free. The formula is worth 200-300+ gold dude. 
---
The hours farmed literally suck away your potential income two fold if your luck is awful. 
---
My point is on a high pop realm, you’ll be bleeding income charging twice what everyone else is charging. Our fee floor for crusader is at 5g because anyone doing enchanting for more than DE mats here has crusader and most if not all of the first 60s wave have made their formula cost back and/or more by now. 
---
You can choose to make 50-100g on raid reset day or you can hope you get 20g with a fee so high. 
---
I’m assuming you’re on a low-medium pop though if you’re not hurting for business though, so good for you :)
---
Pop here refers to your faction to be absolutely clear btw
---
Should keep a watch for the barrens chat then, people just want a specific type of dps

Thanks for saying that man, it’s pretty demoralizing reading all the “your lying” comments but then again I used to be that guy so I completely get it.

I’m really shocked at the appeal being upheld. I thought the appeal meant a human looks into your situation. There’s no way a human looked into mine.
---
If they did, they’d see tons of chat logs, they’d see I play with the same few people, they’d see countless mail and stupid shit between my friends and I, there’s just too much regular person stuff to make this mistake. 
---
I *seriously* doubt a human actually looked, so that means they blindly upheld a ban. 
---
How many other people not on reddit get screwed by this that we’ve never heard of?
---
Who doesn't like this？
---
I've seen this twice now
---
You the player were shadowlands the entire time - blizzard
---
It sounds really great! Good job!
---
Back in the day we had IRC. Out of game cross-faction chat is nothing new
---
Oh, that’s dumb. Thanks for explaining!
---
hehe, i tried this quest couple of days ago on my shaman and got killed by three alliance players, but i managed to purge off their disguise before dying. it was to say the least satisfying :)
---
Dude, that was freaking awesome! One of my favs too
---
tbf in wsg it might be really annoying
---
Thanks Gnarwhalz :-)
---
The players involved in the imbalance probably need some form of negative.  As it stands they see very little danger in world pvp and have very little issue finding groups and items.
---
A WoW 2.0 is long overdue. Retail is bloated in every way. Nothing means anything anymore.
---
&gt; Its not event good. Your pre-raid bis are way better imo.
---
It isnt' I know but I want to finish the set, and it's ridiculous.    
---
I'm new in wow but if this is the game I don't think im gonna last long, if it takes this much RNG and time to have 1 drop, what about the RAID gear? I will probably have that in 2 years lol.  Thank you for the messages but if this game is all about spam bosses and rolling dice till it drops... It's just not the type of game for me.
---
Wow this is really awkward but you can use the res out of combat.............
---
They were on the map so I went there, I googled it after.
---
I’d say just charge in, battle shout, swap to defensive and start tab sundering
---
so for the entirety of the fight ? :D
---
What's the easiest way to farm black dragon scales?
---
it's fine thanks anyway
---
Does the 2 piece earthfury bonus (+30 yard range on totems) stack with the increased totem range talent in resto?
---
perfectly viable. Being balance doesn't stop you to use your other forms anyway
---
&gt; You sound like you need a break.
---
I think you're right...
---
Aye.
---
You're right, I've spend a minute using the reddit search function to search for examples, I should call the local mental institution to pick me up.
---
20/31/0 is soooo tanky though vs melees :( 30/0/21 is squishy as fuck vs warrior immune to fear or ud rogues etc but yh low dmg. I am now 20/31 until I get better gear / do raids
---
Exactly! I literally made a warlock just as much for being that extra useful to the group. It just makes me feel good.
---
Have you played retail lately? The game is one big giveaway and as a result you feel like nothing is earned.
---
The problem is that Blizzard fucked up when they announced too few servers at the beginning of the game which has resulted in massive amounts of transfer offers. It is known that the playerbase if given the chance will gravitate towards one-faction servers.
---
How do you solve this now? Faction based realm transfers and faction based queues. Nothing else can solve the problem at this point. However knowing Blizzard they won't do much to solve the problem at this point.
---
Dueled a warlock with my undead rogue, that fker only won one 1 out of 5 because he kept resisting cheap shot, that stun resist is so busted.
---
How people use it in the game world is just spam.
---
It’s the guy from the famous series Fighter of the streets, right?
---
It's probably "viable" in that your damage will be acceptable, but in the time you've farmed those 4+4 you could have picked up the more accessible pre-bis pieces for an equal or better Stat gain in the long run. You also won't have any of your main 8 slots with +hit, and you may struggle to reach hit cap with only neck/rings/trinkets/cloak. Another benefit of running individual pieces over gear set bonuses is that you can upgrade individual pieces once you start to raid without immediately cutting into your set bonuses.
---
Transmutes are from alchemists, not enchanters. This data is from enchanting. I'm not an alchemist, so I have no data to provide you with.  It'd be super cool to see someone (or a group of alchemists) make this kind of sheet though!
---
Rogue is not very gear dependent. Just have a good pair of weapons and a good head on your shoulders.
---
Or you can just use the +25 rod with the +100 lures while you’re lvl 300 fishing...
---
Yes I understand. 
---
There are inefficiencies in phase 2 that a player who has limited play time sessions will repeatedly encounter more often than players who do not have the same play time restrictions. 
---
If you have to find a group and then find the horde every 3-4 hours of play time, you are losing 10 to 60 minutes of farming every 3-4 hours. This impacts OP, and others in the same position as OP, more acutely. 
---
OP's efficiency will increase when bgs are out. He'll be able to get into the game faster despite being required to leave the game more often than other no-life rankers will. 
---
Remember that OP isn't trying to be king of the hill. He wants rank 10. That means he only needs to be in the middle brackets to rank up and achieve his goal which will translate into the top 20ish % weekly. He's not trying to beat everyone.
---
Do one for orgrimmar and I’ll be impressed. Seriously though it’s pretty good and I didn’t know alliance had such culture.
---
You don't. You can eye of kilrogg from the first gate to the square where he can spawn. There's a video of xn from apes doing it on the warlock discord.
---
Hate to break it to you, but swipe isn't enough to hold aggro for pretty much anything.  It felt great at lower levels, but at 60 its more of a rage dump.  Use it once or twice to make sure mobs don't run straight to the healer, but that's about as useful as it gets in terms of threat.
---
Yea I know it's ench but its same branch of professions as a service.
---
I think Skul's is better. It's +14 shadow whereas green wand has a max roll of +11, iirc.
---
Get an addon to watch your dots.
---
Dont wear mp5 gear.  Always go full spellpower
---
Youre not going to be topping meters, but you can hit top 10.
---
Of course you should go for the eye.
---
Dont pass on gear because mc is where spriests shine.  Your parses will go down once bwl comes out, so push for items now.  Gotta prove yourself now or itll be a lot tougher when competing against mages with gear.
---
fake news
---
Really? I have zero problems holding threat in 60 dungeons as bear tank, regrowth myself, jump into a massive group and spam swipe and I NEVER lose threat, swipe is great.
---
Unnecessary imo. It's easy to find people. Plus you could just join a guild. All of that is right at your fingertips without adding anybody.
---
I don't think blizzard cares about the TOS in classic. I've seen some really disturbing names and they've yet to be banned/changed.
---
Do pandaren still make “om nom nom” sounds when they try to communicate with each other?
---
Totally unlike being told we'll go to hell and burn for all eternity doom and gloom talk.
---
Well if anyone hates you it could be that they hired an assassin guild on you. Can you think of anyone? Otherwise just bad luck I guess
---
I'm referring particularly to the "ok Boomer" thing. some of the "Boomer humor" isn't so bad, but this is just overused
---
You can’t get the pvp trinket yet
---
Yeah it is on you, don’t roll a pvp server if this bothers you. It’s how it was back in the day and it is now too.  It sucks when it happens but it’s great to do it back to them too,
---
I'll look forward to your next submission. Have a nice day.
---
Agreed. Like the name btw
---
Most groups and even most mages are clueless to the fact that flamestrike + arcane explosion/blast wave actually has higher dps. Mages that open with 
---
Flamestrike + blizzard will do higher dps anyway. If you're going for a farm run, at least one or two mages should have imp blizz, but it's totally fine if one doesn't.
---
In a pvp fight, 1v1, what’s the level difference that can be for a reasonable chance at winning? Like if you know you’re strong in 1v1s, at what level diff do you choose to run than to fight? 5, 8, skull (but you see from gear he isn’t 30 levels over you..)?
---
People were showcasing it on beta, it very much works if you get the timing down.
---
You can’t hold agro on mulitple mob that are getting dps equally. Just use the sign, byt a skull on a caster and ignore it, the dps will kill it and usually stun him. Take the 5 seconds to generate aggro on the others. Keep an eye on the focus and taunt him if he goes out of stun (taunt is out of gcd). Normally you have enough agro on the others. 
---
You should still be reactive in the taunt when you lose agro/ or the stun. 
---
So on a pack of 4 I usually let the dps focus one while taunting it if necessary. Build good aggro on 2, and the last is light on aggro and readybto be taunt.
---
You should also tell your dps to start by killing non elite mob (you are not tanking them).
---
At the end of the day, you can’t keep aggro on everything and just faceroll dungeon like retail. But you’re the one giving instruction, focus etc ... and people usually listen at least a little bit.
---
If you have a mage going nuts on aoe from the pull, you can only hope to keep 2 elites max, so don’t try more. If someone if being stupid don’t bother and let them tank, only the healer is very important
---
Wow dude u did BRD, amazing
---
You msg them back free Hong Kong
---
Uh, no.
---
Cheap , the mats for legs cost me 100g had a guildie craft them which saved 20g , gloves cost me 58g outright
---
Low effort
---
I remember it was an Irelia player so pretty sure youre spot on.
---
Left hand.
---
Haha, fair enough.
---
Hahahah
---
armorsmith has tank gear that's needed for tanking rag and one good dps helm
---
weaponsmith has gear that pretty much anyone can use, although it might be overpriced depending on arcanite prices
---
You’re joking?
---
Oh man, didn't even consider that!
---
I was kind of surprised when my friend told me he never saw submerge phase on Rag and didn't even know it was a thing until I asked him about it.
---
No, respec time.
---
I think it's funny until they spam the racist shit tbh. Then I report them.
---
Garbage post.
---
Dude have you been living under a rock blizzard doesn’t give a shit about bad press
---
You do know there's rules on this sub yes?
---
Why would I fake that, dude?
---
You are overreacting in my opinion.
---
Yes you should go holy.
---
You need to gear for dps/tps, not pure tank
---
i just became a father so spending time in major cities and buying cheap mats and craftibg pots is pretty lucrative for someone who dont has too much time to farm stuff. im currently at 700g only by reselling stuff i bought for cheap. its chill :)
---
As a mage in pvp context, once you're lvl 60 is there any benefit to the talent elemental precision?
---
I would say he had every right to roll if the item was an upgrade for his class, even if he could not equip it right away.
---
Is this not how the classic game is suppose to play out? Balance is in the hands of the players not the engineers?
---
Overreaction, at that level, you will find something to replace your armour in no time.
---
4 levels at that level isnt very long
---
I’d never thought that the all so beautiful Norrmalm of Stockholm would ever appear on a wow subreddit
---
How is 4 levels away not the foreseeable future? People play the game at different paces, 20 - 24 can be done in an afternoon
---
Benediction seems pretty even.
---
Thanks for the information!
---
Blizzard has been listening to a lot of complaints since before the game was launched. Hopefully this is another time they do that
---
Rogues are far superior at Silithus mining. Distract and vanish makes it so you don't have to fight elite bugs. 
---
You'll need to kill the first boss to get to the Rich nodes in DM: East.
---
nah that works in every dungeon, only a few mobs in ubrs shouldnt be tanked without a shield
---
Looking at it from mobile and it barely shows any with 100k gold. Of course some idiots are gonna fill in fake data. That's gonna happen with any public form.
---
I mean it would make them better in MC sure but BWL+ would still nullify them. There’s so many bosses that are immune to taunt.
---
Kromkrush, well populated and good balance. There is always a good fight at black rock mountain
---
Oh you're absolutely right. I did mean pushback.
---
Blizzard won't risk banning thousands for it.
---
https://discord.gg/QDazqd
---
Why's your meter so big lmao
---
My favorite will always be defending the farm in AB against rogues. 
---
Popping out of cat form to watch them basically give up once the root and faerie fire hit, it gives me a warm tingling feeling.
---
It's not much different in 5 mans either. Sure you may occasionally Sheep on bigger pulls or Nova as a healer takes aggro on an add or Blizzard on an AoE pull but 90% you're still spamming Frostbolt.
---
My opinion it's fine to roll on things you still need to level up for. Because he'll get there eventually. He also played his part in defeating the boss( probably).
---
/u/userleansbot
---
Yeah you can roll on that.  Its still an upgrade.
---
I just thought it was funny.. does everything on Reddit have to be so serious? Why do you care about the relevance? Why does everyone on Reddit feel they have to say something about something that doesn’t make sense to them?
---
For many it's pathetic as that generally correlates with an inability to form social bonds leading to sexual relations in real life.
---
Which is, and has already been bannable on normal same-faction chat.
---
Cross-faction chat literally changes none of this, the ignore and report functions exist for a good reason.
---
Yup, that’s *Azeroth’s Ass*
---
It's not used to shame socially awkward white dudes. It's used to shame racists and homophobes who continue to use slurs and pretend like it's okay because "it's just banter". It's adorable how many excuses people will go to though to defend someone using slurs.
---
I heard iron grenade is not affected by orc stun resist. In that case  I would roll ud rogue. Wotf makes you slaughter priests and locks
---
He’s high enough level to be in the group but not enough to get the spoils?  The fuck kind of kid table shit is that?
---
If he’s in the group and putting in the work and the item is an upgrade he gets to need, plain and simple.
---
Classic+ is as little as releasing TBC with a change that wasn't there originally. Classic+ is as little as rebalancing the talent trees a bit.
---
Literally anything added, changed, or removed from the game that isn't historical is classic+
---
Paladins actually had a really interesting interaction with mana in TBC; it was basically a blue Rage bar since they regained mana from getting hit (in Prot spec, at least). Now tankadins have no resource at all to manage; you just hit buttons as they light up with a (minor) priority system.
---
Got engihead (245) and might wanna roll herbalism and alchemy. Can i use head still when roll to other profession.
---
Dont be a bitch
---
Tbh demon warlock is one my favorite retail specs
---
It’s so good. Helps u get into dungeons without other faction killing you every time if u use bubble too. 
---
And in pvp if any one uses a disabling effect on you you can use this item to break the stun because it causes dmg to yourself like a dot when you use it. 
---
So if u have it on you can’t get sheeped or feard or anything like that. So it’s very useful in advanced pvp.
---
It’s also the only item that makes you flap like a chicken and run really fast ：） 
---
Bad luck my friend but also you probably won’t miss it if you haven’t already been using it.
---
It wasn't intended as derogatory. Just because I'm calling the logic behind your argument dumb doesn't mean I'm calling you dumb. Even though most people don't make the distinction, I think it's an important one to make.
---
That said, "Out of [someone's] pocket" means "out of their own personal funds" so saying that taking items they never had is "coming out of their pockets" is a direct contradiction
---
Like yeah, obviously it's money that they potentially could have won but for each other party member the chance that they would have personally won the item is so small that someone hitting need when they hit greed feels no different than any other reason for not winning it
---
On the flipside, the money in their bag is already theirs and it feels good to see it go up and bad to see it go down.
---
So there's a huge distinction to be made between expecting that everyone actively give you money from their own bags and expecting that everyone passively look away when a green drops.
---
+5
---
thanks!  will try it out
---
Very easy to allow it if a friend gives then an invite.  Come on dude..
---
You're absolutely playing an AoE tank wrong, you should have no problem being able to keep aggro with aoe going ham if you're geared properly and aoe tanking the right way. 
---
1. First of all you need to prioritize getting +Spellpower plate gear. Spellpower increases the threat on almost all your spells like shield slam, thunderclap, battle shout, demo shout etc. If you have no spellpower gear that's a large part of your aggro problem
---
2. Second of all you need to constantly remove your buffs so you can constantly reapply them. The primary debuff you should be removing is battle shout, even better if you can get the rest of your party to constantly remove their battleshout debuffs too.
---
1. Next, interrupt generates a lot of aggro and if you interrupt your own party members it generates aggro on ALL mobs. Wait for one of your spellcasters to be casting a non-important spell and interrupt them. Ideally the highest threat dps like a warlock or AOE'ing mage, not only will it generate aggro on all mobs for you, it will stop your caster from generating any threat for a few seconds! Make sure you are stance dancing to alternate between pummel and shield bash for maximum affect!
---
4. The same as 3, only for melee. Disarming your own melee party members also works the same way as casters! You generate a ton of threat while at the same time reducing the threat of your own party members.
---
1. The lower health a party member is when you taunt or re-gain aggro the more snap aggro your generate. When mobs are on other party members try and let them get as low on health as possible before getting aggro back. In fact if you engage a pack of mobs and have your aoe taunt up it's best to let the entire party take as much damage as possible before using it.
---
I hope this helps you aoe taunt better in the future!
---
An article came out saying "ok boomer" is the n-word of ageism and there are a lot of boomers repeating that sentiment and trying to pretend that it's true. The fact that "ok boomer" destroys their fragile egos means it will carry on for months longer. Honestly, it will at least go on as long as boomers complain that millenials are the reason that x industry is failing. My current favorite is that millenials are killing the beer industry because shitty beers like Coors, Miller, and Budweiser aren't doing as well as they used to. Of course that ignores the explosion of microbrews but boomers can't wrap their head around people not liking piss in a can and expect millenials to endlessly feed large companies that put out a below average product.
---
First off the “n-word” you are referring to was probably “negro” as it is in many other countries especially Spanish speaking ones, not the racial slur he used. Second, lol at “80’s dictionary” - way to prove your point.
---
super easy for priest or lock, lock can actually solo the entire instance
---
They are called shield spikes. Blacksmiths make them and put them on. 
---
I believe there are a few levels of them such as mithril and thorium
---
Well your idea isn't really well thought out either. Fixing bugs and putting out more phases are fairly independent tasks, the notion that you have to pick one or the other just shows a lack of understanding.
---
I just didn't feel the need to roast you on it
---
Post below you bro

Do you have an email or screenshot to share?

So far, no one had provided proof that they were suspended for this.
---
But then it will be "OK MILLENNIAL"
---
This is really beautiful. Did you go to music school?
---
Does the poison give any spell pushback?
---
Sure, because I can watch a show or multi-task. It's a lot easier than nolifing pvp for 8 hours a day
---
PvP gets boring outside of BGs because it tends to just devolve to 10v1
---
That is not how it works.
---
I don’t know how I would feel if a guy I ganked 3 weeks ago remembered my name.  Probably creeped out.
---
*cries in melee attack power from DM buff &amp; Onyxia*
---
I rolled need on a healing staff the other day as elemental. Felt bad, did what I could to make it for it, then decided since I had this dope healing staff I would start playing resto lmao
---
Of course it is, he could get to 24 the day after if not the same day
---
&gt; and there are a lot of boomers repeating that sentiment and trying to pretend that it's true
---
Yeah.. no there aren't. Actual boomers don't know or care even the tiniest bit as they're well used to younger people complaining about them as gen X and millennials have been doing it for decades.
---
If you seriously think any substantial percentage of actual boomers even know this is all going on you're kidding yourself. Of those, the majority don't care.
---
Is only game, why are you mad?
---
Tough for you to see a forest when your nose is so close to the tree, huh?
---
Devilsaur. Krol Blade. Myrmidon's Signet. Also there is alot of close to pre raid bis rather cheap blues on the AH
---
Do as the what? azerothans? Azerothians? Azerothonians?
---
No it wasn't
---
I don’t know honestly I like to that size 😁
---
Orc is objectively better for PVE, slightly better for PVP so if you want to min/max pick Orc. I picked Undead because I think an Orc Rogue looks shit.
---
This works better and faster with a competent group late game. Can even work in MC if you’re APES.
---
Am glad to hear this, as I'm a healer and often heal instances that im too low for so most of the gear i can't wear. So i usually greed as the clothies could wear them immediately. But makes sense for me to roll need if it's an upgrade I'll be able to use and they'd not be able to do it without a healer.
---
That was my progression as well, except I moved on from a ravager. (didn't do the wv quest the second time around)
---
No shit! I'm full Pre BiS but what can the raid and myself do when no tank gear drops for 5 weeks straight?
---
Nope. I have it setup so that left virtual joystick is for QWES and on the right I have spells + AD. Also B, Esc and Tab as additional buttons. Left and right mouse buttons are there was well because it sometimes glitches out and you have to click multiple times to loot a corpse. 
---
I don't run dungeons like that, but it's alright for questing. Although I would very much appreciate official client.
---
OK, Thank you.
---
To each their own, i' d split it in half and add in a threat meter next to it.
---
There is no reason to go boomkin. Bear aoe threat is incredible
---
He asked about PVP
---
See, as aggressive as these guys are being, they're actually completely right. You should be transferring off a server with a 9-1 imbalance, now I dont know if Heartseeker is your only choice, but if it isnt its kinda what you have to do.
---
This this THIS. Also play a rogue and will pull aggro for the same reasons, which is not your fault at all. I’m a grownup and if I pull too much aggro I will die, so that’s my own damn risk and fault and I would have only myself to blame - not you and not the healer.
---
oh really? wow i didnt know that. maybe read before responding yeah?
---
*ahem* Shadow Priests, Warlocks...
---
Really helpful comment cheers. The OP didn't specify any preference to server type, nor did I say he should roll on a pve server.
---
spent 8 hours roughly havent located a single one
---
Actually it's possible to kill only Zevrim and Alzzin, skipping Hydrospawn is as easy as walking right past him.
---
Idubbbz has moved past it all and i want to say he isnt racist, just says and does stupid shit for laughs and reactions because thats what gets you clicks. You might not agree to it but just because i say the N word out loud doesnt make me racist, just stupidly fucking ignorant to the connotations that word has.
---
To play devils advocate here as well, do you seriously expect any individual person to try and "balance the servers"? Its clearly something he has no effect on no matter how hard he tries
---
Its really fuct that Blizzard has an option to block channel invites. Yet that option still shows you the damn message that someone tried to invite you... its like they want the Gold sellers ? Conspiracy theory that they want to disrupt them but they don’t want them to stop there subscriptions?
---
Incredibly beautiful and emotional take. I love that song already and your version is just amazing. I love it.
---
This is literal stupidity. Fs-&gt;coc-&gt;ae is infinitely more dps then blizzard spam lol.
---
Had a shadow priest looking for a healer for Scholo run, saying they had Dark Runes reserved (I think skin was res too) 
---
They were still looking when I went back to Org an hour later.
---
Oh, you bought a shitty "gaming chair"... You'll regret it after a few months. Maybe not if you payed $500+ for it. Any generic ones are total trash though. Mine fell apart in a year and so has many others + in the summer it's hot af. Going for a mesh office chair from now.
---
BiS lists for healers are dynamic lists. 
---
i.e. The list changes over time. Here’s a basic summary of the logic you should follow. 
---
Your main goal should be increasing the amount you healed over the course of the fight. If you healed for 60k, and someone else healed for 40k, you can say, “I healed better than them.”
---
But the amount you heal depends on how fast the boss dies. So the boss can either die fast, or slow. If the boss dies fast (consequentially your mana will be less of an issue), you should prioritize gear that will increase your raw output. +healing gear, and I think spirit gives +healing (not sure). 
---
If the boss dies slow, things get awkward. The formula isn’t cut and dry. You have two main statistics: how fast you go out of mana, and how much each heal heals for. The issue being that each stat scales off the other. So the more mana you have, the more effective +healing gear is, and the more +healing you have, the more effective mana/mana regen is.
---
Just did that a few days ago as well.  Started as Arena-&gt;Anger-&gt;Golem run and ended up doing like 5 other areas.  We stopped after getting MC attunement =P
---
&gt;Alliance says '3 1 p 12 11 2 ppp 41 12 11', Horde reads 'y o u re an e vil ko re an'.
---
Well that went to 100 real fuckin quick
---
This was me last night in BRD
---
when the game launched the servers were super crowded and all had queues. so a few days after the launch, and after opening up several servers, blizzard opened up free server transfers. now, unfortunately humans are very impatient beings so rather than stick around in the queues they utilized these free transfers to move to less populated servers. the transfers were free to both factions, allowing players to go one way to a lower populated server. about this time game population census data pops up. since popularity of the factions are different, the amount of players leaving the servers caused sort of a ripple effect. some groups leave and this causes other players to jump ship out of sheer pressure of being overwhelmed. it's a 100% player created issue. 
---
so with that being said this 'leak' is the result of the community wanting blizzard to clean up their mess for them. 
---
Tldr: gates open &gt; players rush the servers &gt; pick their factions (horde majority) &gt; queues &gt; human nature &gt; free transfers &gt; census data pops up &gt; peer pressure &gt; imbalance &gt; whining &gt; faction-restrictive transfers
---
Oh my god, I was there last night and saw all them walking around.  I ask in gen if anyone wanted quest help because I was bored after BRD and they messaged back. 
---
If you want to catch someone off guard use an innocent name, not an obvious one
---
Disagree. You’re not accounting for the essence of water he usually drops. It takes about 8 minutes to kill him and it’ll net you 12-20 gold depending on your server. That’s solid. At worst you get a couple gold from the bop and lashers+satyr farm locks you out regardless. I kill hydro once every 3 runs so I can continuously farm
---
You don't have to be APES. A lot of tanks DW fury tank raids, almost have to if your warrior DPS are geared and know how to play well.
---
My guild mate was one of them, asked me what they tried to say &amp; what it meant.
---
Everyone, come quick for the circle jerk
---
I suppose your right after 150+ kills without this ever happening it suddenly decided to happen every single time after this patch.

I like the idea of +5 since most trash doesn't even survive a one combo point slice and dice so wouldn't get full benefit of a crusader proc. Bosses like Geddon, Gehennas, Domo and Rag have lots of moving around so again some time on a crusader proc would be wasted. On straight tank and spanks like Golemagg I assume crusader wins out.
---
i played with two paladins in zul'farrak when lvl 47, the sanctify aura and the judgment of crusader made my smites averaging 500 dmg and criting above 700 sometime. Felt good.

For fishing I like to try some late night / early morning runs when there might not have been people there for awhile, you're traveling down a coast and there's just nonstop "pools" or floating junk every 20-30 yards.
---
I haven’t found a working one yet do you know one?
---
So you can enjoy the game your way but their wrong for doing it their way? Nobody is under any obligation to bring anyone with them into a dungeon. If they are looking for AoE and you're not what they're looking for tfb.
---
Hard disagree. My guild full consumes not because we “need” it but because we want to finish MC in 2 hours and not 5-6. Why not pop full consumables and work on parses.
---
I never said that, I said that you can avoid improved SoR to take spiritual focus because you don't need the extra threat, allowing you to take spiritual focus to be able to both solo far easier, heal yourself if a pull goes bad/ healer gets banished etc.

Example 30/21 (what I use to be viable at tanking dungeons, offtanking raids, healing raids and dungeons) - https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/0550312050135-051251330001
---
Example 20/31 (IMO I don't think holy shield is that necessary, albeit very nice to have to use rank 1 for mitigation, so still fine if you want to trade off being as sustainable of a healer. Much of the prot tree can be swapped around) - https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/055031105-053251335201001
---
The Icy prot talents are really not needed, 11-31-9 is completely necessary
---
Imagine thinking it’s hard to find a healer
---
Thank you so much for that long explanation. So now faction restrictive means only horde or alliance can transfer on a specific server? Im on thalnos server am i gonna be affected by this?
---
You will have to make a choice - keep the head and roll an alt with those professions, or drop it and learn the professions on your main.
---
Oh nvm then, I thought you were unable to find maps.
---
Well they have a long respawn time so it's pretty hard to find one.

Wrath HC dungeons are harder than vanilla raids.

I don't think this works on high pop servers, my server isn't by any means a megaserver or anything but I know a few Lotus locations and even at very off-peak times it's very rare to see it up.  On the off chance you do pick it sure, you can set an alarm for yourself to be there in 6 hours / 12 hours if possible but it's tough.

I have now installed Tradeskillmaster , because I remember it being good.

There was significantly less pugs than we see now. It was way more of an achievement.

I had a great time going as a lock with 2 warriors, a rogue and an enhancement shaman where my job was mainly making sure mobs can't run and throwing some dots up. Was super fun.

"Even if you cant wear it in the forseable future" lol wtf? Its 5 levels in the 20s lol, that takes like 3 hours.
---
Lol I got whispered by an officer a couple months ago, seemingly worried, asking why I was still online. I didn't know officers have access to time played and logs and stuff. Told him I just woke up early for work 30 hours early and wanted to play a little WoW.
---
It was a pretty smooth run! Tracker was off, said the healer did the most damage for some reason.
---
As a positive point for hunters, they are pretty good for herbalism as when you are gathering an herb node you can always throw your pet on that hostile mob that's always nearby so they don't interrupt you.
---
Well of course. Blizz doesn't enforce it very often. I was just answering the question.
---
You act like it was a deliberate action to fuck over their group. I know where Ony is but every now and then I take the Blasted  Lands portal trying to get to her. Should I google it even though I already know it's in Dustwallow?
---
Well doomsaw is useless since you cant properly do talents.
---
Now you want your crit chance to be 25%. With treants you can get much more strength gear, with demonshear you want more agility and +crit. 
---
If you want to min-max it anyway.
---
Otherwise just go for looks as none of this matters cuz we are here to charge/intercept + mortal strike the enemy WITH BIG METAL IN THE FACE

Tbh I honestly think most kids are Alliance due to the fact that most streamers are Alliance

Repentance only works against Humanoids though :( So maybe I can use it the other way around.
---
What do you do endgame besides the few raids that are available?
---
There are also some 12 stam, 12 strength, 3 Def bracers from the Warlock mount boss in DM East which are a good pickup.
---
Yeah as someone who would use /sit on pservers especially during solo PVE grinds or in PVP to cheese rogues.. 
---
The practical application of this new type of sitcrit is MUCH LESS than before.  In PVP it used to be that I could easily hit the /sit a few times and get stacks totally brainlessly- and who knows maybe it's still possible with rogues attacking more than once every second but it's still gonna be a lot tougher. 
---
That being said, I'm sure some folks will be able to figure it out pretty well and get some quick, juicy reck bombs. 
---
The Solo PVE part of it is probably going to be easier- you can get a mod to show enemy swing timer and PVE monsters are, of course, extremely predictable.  So with focus, it might be possible to generate easy reck stacks more than 50% of the time.  Generally, you can just weave /sit in between your OWN melee swings and then just unload your stacks constantly as you gain them leading to like, 2 or 3x as many weapon swings as you'd normally have- and of course they're all procing either seal of righteousness or command.

I have druid. My strat was to level a mage.

Struggle through until 23ish, then aoe grind exclusively to 42, ZF to 50ish, then brd / other dungeons til 60. Very fast.

Then you have your own gold and water making machine! Plus you get to be a top pvp class, that is also the least gear dependent in the game

you should be using the standard arms pvp build for tanking 5- and 10-man dungeons. (31/20/0). Charge, SS, WW is unbeatable AoE threat. From there you tab sunder. You should use a 2H and learn when you need to switch to a shield due to incoming damage. Do not respec prot until 15 mins before raid time. It’s bad in dungeons. The sum of what prot gives you for tanking is still less useful than SS for dungeons.
---
Yikes... you’re dumb as a box of rocks.
---
super roughly how many stacks of runecloth does it take to go from honored to exalted for mount access?
---
Nah, anyone over 35 is a boomer according to these dumb ass kids
---
Non existent is a stretch. I pull 850 dps every 2min in a dungeon with blade flurry.
---
It’s wild how angry and simple some folks are... have a good one mate, keep it up. Some people think you’re funny.
---
In his defence this is a lot more trash-meme related than game-related :P
---
Dense stone
---
Keep questing and get it a few levels from now. You’re going to slow leveling so you can get a mount that doesn’t slow leveling...just level and get it when it comes
---
Guild leader doesn't want 3 enhance shamans in his raid, even if they have higher dps.
---
I had a lot of success with just grinding beasts, skinning, and vendoring the skins and junk.  I had ~130gold when I hit 40 and made it back to that at around level 43.
---
As a Druid? Bring two friends
---
I can understand disagreeing with the wand, but I thought everyone agreed that Cauterizing Band and Vambraces of Prophecy were the best ring and bracer.
---
Just keep leveling and you'll have it at 41
---
Does that mean that Tauren may achieve 315 in herbalism ? Or just that they already have 15 points in ?
---
Not on my server
---
Farm for big iron fishing rod, get shell fish while doing it, hand in quest for 55s. Any big iron rod you find sell on neutral ah as it’s among the best allies can get. Assuming u are horde. Worked like a charm for me. I am a shaman though so had underwater breath
---
Not at computer to test but the easiest to make would be a spammable macro like this:
---
/cleartarget [dead]  
---
/target Gibbering Ghoul  
---
I don't believe you can do 
---
/target [nodead] Gibbering Ghoul  
---
Because it would condition the action of targeting, not the mob you are targeting. So I think the spammable macro might be the best I can think of now.

---
I cant check pre raid bis compared to shadowcraft gear but 100% sure that pre raid offensive stats are higher (ap, crit, hit total).
---
Dodge, hp and armor are defensive stats and rather useless in pve. The stat bonuses themselves are quite neglible. 1% hit rating is compared to something like 40 attack power. (Or even more).
---
Some classes dont need much hit. But assuming we are talking about rogues: they need minimally 8% and can get it up to 27% although that is unrealistic. Whats the use of crit and attack power if you dont hit anything
---
You're missing your grilled squid or, for the budget-minded consumer, your stamina/spirit food.  Perhaps some tender wolf steak or spider sausage, mhm?

Not sit crit, this is sit/stand crit.  You won’t get the counter if you stay sitting,

Piggybacking on this comment since it's been answered and mine is similar. Are there any other quests/ways to grind to gain rep with Orgrimmar besides runecloth turn in?
---
Obviously in an ideal situation I would have started questing there at lvl 1 but I didn't decide I wanted a wolf until now.
---
"realistic solution"
---
Everyone has read your exact post a million times. Try again. With a realistic solution now. We know blizz won't do it so let's stop beating the dead horse. You have no idea what all the possible solutions are. It seems you've read a lot of Reddit And qualify yourself as an expert...
---
Getting a head start is far from getting handouts non stop, especially when it is on servers that badly need fresh meat
---
In fairness, most of the tipless +55 healing records are from people in my guild or that I have personal connections to, so naturally they're inclined to not tip since they did ultimately help me get the recipe for +55 healing. I chose to include the data because it still helps provide information as to the demand/frequency of the enchant is compared to everything else. I think most enchanters have a group of people they give "free" enchants to, so it's a natural part of the data that shouldn't be omitted in order to preserve the veracity of it
---
Well, what do you expect when you're playing on the TBC pre-release patch?
---
Not my experience in Fairbanks
---
You have to mash sit/stand.  Just sitting does not work.
---
Maybe don't run with 4 clothies if you're so worried about gear.
---
You clearly didnt read it dumbass

Do all pve people complain this much?

First 2 are pretty accurate, but I am usually able to find groups for quests on my pvp server.

---
if you do 4/5 Spiritual Focus and 2/3 improved Conc aura, you still get 100% uninterruptible heals when you have Conc aura active (same as if you do 5/5 spiritual focus and no points in improved conc) but you get the nice bonus to silence and apply it to your group members as well.  It also frees up an extra point in the holy tree to go elsewhere.  If you want to be really balanced you could do 3/5 in both divine STR and divine INT, but at this point you're kind of circumcising the mosquito. 
---
Improved Conc aura is especially valuable in PVP, you can get a lot of resistance to mage counterspell, warlock spell lock, rogue kick, shaman earth shock, warrior pummel, etc.  As any paladin can tell you, getting locked out of Holy is BAD NEWS.  Passive resistance working like, 10%-15% of the time is a very big deal.  PVE I'd say it's still relevant but you won't always have Conc aura active in PVE (where it's extremely common in PVP)
---
Yeah I understand, will probably have to the testing myself no way out :D

Yeah I'm deleting it. Classicdb claimed 75 rep. The rest is my own stupidity

&gt; So as Ret you could consider throwing repentance on a hunter or warlock and then dpsing down their pet

Exactly.  In world Pvp, you nearly always know shits about to go down, so on goes the skull.

---
&gt;Rogues are far superior at Silithus mining. Distract and Vanish
---
Vanish has a 5 minute cooldown. Druids have (effectively) no cooldown on fighting 1 elite bug. Most of the node locations are right next to an elite, so a Rogue would also have to use Blind, another 5 minute cooldown. If there's 2 nodes in the same cave, you'd have to sit there and wait. Druid doesn't have to wait.
---
I honestly made a good majority of my gold on my druid just farming Silithus early in the morning when nobody else is on.
---
Those numbers are wrong. They took them directly from the website where you could upload the LUAs from Wowcensor, but didn't bother crosschecking with the Discords to check if the information matches the day to day census.
---
I could see them do that so you know if you get a legit invite that you don’t want to ignore while you have the block feature active?
---
How exactly does leveling pets work as a twink? How do you minimize xp while getting your pet to 19/29/39. Afaik questing doesn't level your pet which seems kinda spooky when you have some quests at lvl 28 you need for BiS items for example. How much xp does a hunter's pet gain compared to the hunter?
---
Hi all,
---
Recently revisiting WoW with classic back.
---
Been using questie to aid myself and I've noticed something with grouping. When it's me and a buddy I can only see how many items I have/Need for a quest on mouse over. When I've grouped with someone else or a 3rd person joins our group, I can view how many items they have/Need. Is there a setting that needs ticking or unticking?
---
Cheers
---
That's just not true though. Gear tends to benefit exponentially off itself. If you give gear to your best players, they're going to do way more with that gear than your bottom dps player with garbage gear.
---
That's actually really useful, thanks, good stuff.
---
I think about 2000 gold would be fair. Based on most posts I see 300 runs seems to be about average until folks have it drop. You can only do 5 per hour until lockout so about 60 hours of effort. 2000g/60 hours is 33g/hour which is about what a healer would earn farming other stuff.
---
I've been looking for a wireless mmo mouse too. Was it the Razer Naga Epic Chroma mouse you were looking at too? Not sure why it's so hard to find a wireless mmo mouse.
---
Random snippets of words barely qualify as "cross-faction communication". It doesn't convey enough information.
---
Why? I never had a 60 in vanilla but I have my setup the same way...
---
But can it do THIS??
---
It's the same with the bis obsession. No your full bis set is not that much better than the third best item.
---
That's the thing. I'm fairly sure he does. Maybe I'll get him to reinstall it.
---
Why did you list “taint” 4 times?
---
Yikes YTA sweaty
---
in an area full of druids for druids you would think they could communicate with each other while shape shifted
---
All I'm saying is it's overused, I never used the words "taking forever" and I never said "these darn kids on the internet" I think there's much better content on the internet and seeing this sweep across news feeds is atrocious. Way to assume my purpose in what I said....millenial
---
Completely over reacting man. If you salty about a LVL 25 weapon. God dam when you get to endgame.
---
Nope. But don't worry, there's a large stronghold in northeast of Blasted Lands right beside the entrance. Just ride into Blasted Lands first and turn left, and you'll see the NPCs and the castle.

When compared to a twink, the pet isn’t doing much damage (let’s say 15%). If said pet is 28 instead of 29 then it’s damage compared to yours won’t fall off that much.

Let’s are utility as a twink especially 29 hunters. You’ll love when someone focuses down your pet because before they realize, they dead.

If your guild actually believes that...
---
You are absolutely wrong. You literally dont.
---
Really depends on the fight. Maybe it doesn’t make you a good raider if you’re messing up mechanics but it means you’re a good healer. Maximizing healing done, minimizing overhealing done, performing raid mechanics and dispels. All go into being a good healer/raider.

The TBC pre-release patch would have the TBC pre-release talents. Do you see Ret paladins running around with Crusader Strike?
---
Every mediocre guild does it...
---
It does, but it only adds an additional 10 yards IIRC.
---
When Pugs are LFM for MC they'll use shorthand for some things (e.g. MS&lt;OS). What do these mean? Is there a quick list of some common ones? I assume it has something to do with the loot rules or items on reserve most of the time but Idk the shorthand
---
This!^^ monkeynews is an amazing warrior; i suggest aim for high stamina all around without sacrificing too much damage, warriors running with pocket healers perhaps may keep some high damage gear on as well but stamina is always so strong!
---
The point of the worlf is to keep it next to you to buff your aimed shot. Pets in raids die constantly. You get more damage out of your pet buffing you than you do having your pet attack mobs for a few seconds before dying.
---
When we open the gates of AQ you can turn in all sorts of stuff to whichever faction you want. You probably don't want to wait that long though.
---
If that's the case, then it should calculate everything we CAN say rather than give us a text box where 99.99% of words result in not possible.
---
It is better than some content I can't disagree, although hes not the first to post videos like that and "world record 1-10" is like being the smartest kid on the short bus. Although I get where your coming from, good day

We've had 4 perds in our last 5 kills. Only 1 of our rogue is missing it now xd.

That’s neat! Thanks for sharing.

It’s only going to get worse now that you made it public. I didn’t farm there but I will now.
---
Thats not fast at all..
---
Feint is on a 10 second cooldown and dumps a huge amount of threat, if you have a rogue that doesnt control their aggro with feint or fully dump it with vanish they are bad and will most likely always be bad no matter what you tell them.
---
Make it a female tauren and get a different mount. Problem solved
---
Main Spec get to roll on gear before Offspec. A main spec healer will not be given loot over a mage for that great + spell damage weapon or whatever. Items on reserve will typically be for benediction (eye), bindings (for legendary), and crafting mats for the legendary mace.
---
I got a wireless lap keyboard, so now I just have my gaming pc hooked up to my tv, and I sit on the couch.

Make the doorways smaller imo. Go back to TB

A guy on the mage discord I follow took 417 runs to get his. I haven't seen anyone under 200. Seems silly, but if you've got nothing else to farm, I guess.

Nice work! I enjoy the setting as well. 
---
Where exactly is this music from? I don't recognize it. Alliance?
---
Yes. If he is high enough to join, he is high enough to roll need.
---
Going to get worse too with these transfers opening, it's going to be unplayable. I can't believe Blizzard is just allowing this to happen
---
Rereading your comments it seems like you're under the impression that when you make 90k/yr you automatically have "Made it" and don't have to worry about money anymore.
---
I used to think that way when I was 19 and making $15/hr.
---
You're in for a rude awakening when you leave home or that one bedroom apartment and begin to make more money and in turn require a vehicle, or have some kids and start getting those extra expenses.
---
Point is, even people at 90k/yr can be stretched thin each paycheque, it's entirely based on their circumstances and the area they live in, saying "Well just move" does nothing but prove how little you understand about life outside of your bubble.
---
Or which of the phrases they were using. That list had “nogger” on it, which is much more likely to get a ban than “OK BOOMER”
---
90 in what? your region?, china alone has 68 servers
---
edit; and at the time of posting this all are labelled as full
---
They're literally the same but thorium just does more damage.
---
/who still works and guildies can still see you in the guild list.
---
I think this has more to do with complexity of classes and specs. Bfa class balance/feel might have been the worst since classic. If you played legion going into bfa you lost so much power, i literally couldnt stand to play my legion main into bfa cause he lost so much.(power,skills,abilities,legendaries)
---
Is that somehow relevant to the discussion or are you just bringing it up because of some bias you have?
---
Edit: Not an officer, work on crime scenes for the police service.
---
Good to know
---
i mean hey, if you are so concerned, take the transfer as a horde.
---
someone has to draw the short straw when overall there is more horde than alliance. just who it is changes. do you really think that people would take the transfer leaving the community they plays with if their faction was doing okay or if the pvp wasn't so campy?
---
yeee!
---
I only ever use Thunder Bluff as my main city, mostly because the AH and mailbox are like 20 feet from each other and you don't have to dismount.
---
It’s usually worth it to level to max then leave. That’s what I’ve done every single expansion except BfA. Zones are usually fun and new dungeons are interesting.
---
Idk about fear but you can't poly princess. Based on that I guess it's the same with fear.
---
Get back to retail guitar.
---
Female tauren can't fit through on that mount either.
---
Just because they can't use the internet doesn't mean they won't be pissed about it the first time they're responded to with "Ok boomer" twice in one day
---
Got my MARKUS 10 years ago - is still awesome.
---
Meanwhile a friend has gone through three "gaming chairs" that were much more expensive each.
---
I'm guessing this is a bug, or a fake. Got any footage or just this cropped screenshot?
---
To be fair ambush is just op in the early stages of leveling so I'd go sub until you can dump talent points into sword mastery, just my opinions
---
Okay, sure, but Arcanist’s shoulders are trash, the frost damage shoulders from BRD are better. 
---
7/10 loot. Thanks a lot, Blizz.
---
Gone
---
How do i deal with pet loyalty when i alt tab while playing? I feel like i cannot alt tab any single time without dismissing my pet or logging out completely because then my pet will just run away, how do i deal with it?
---
Its why i loved the mekgineers chopper when it came out, could finally ride through doors
---
No. In World of Arcanum sure. Not WoW.
---
Two daggers.
---
Razorgore- each dps needs to know the add kill priority or you risk being overrun by split damage.
---
Vael- each dps needs to not blow up on the raid with the debuff.
---
Firemaw- each dps needs to manage their flame stacks.
---
Chromag- each player needs to los his breaths.
---
Nef- bosses shadowbolts hit very hard. Mis-positioning will kill you. You need to know the proper kill priority on adds. Each player needs to know how to deal with their own class calls.
---
Prophet skeram- each melee needs to be on their A-game for interrupts. Each mage needs to be ready to sheep MC's immediately. 1 person fucks up and people will start dying.
---
Viscidus - everyone needs to aoe at the same time on the first split otherwise the boss isn't going to die.
---
Huhuran- everyone needs to farm nature resist outside of raid.
---
Anubisath trash packs- just as hard as a boss fight. Each player needs to know how to react to each of his abilities.
---
CThun- just pulling the boss improperly is immediate wipe. Everyone needs protection potions and to know where they're positioned. Everyone needs to respond to adds properly. Everyone has to be on their A game. This boss is a real pain.
---
Grobbulus- all players need to be ready to drop poison away from the raid otherwise you're gonna wipe.
---
Thaddius- each player needs to know when to swap sides for lightning. One mistake and it's a wipe.
---
Heigan-safety dance
---
Loatheb-one of the hardest bosses in the game. All healers must be coordinated. All players must have minimum of 3 greater shadow protection potions. Dps need to be on their A game to kill him in time. Wiping here is extremely time consuming and expensive.
---
Four horsemen- hardest boss in the game. Each player needs to know how to do the boss rotation and how the boss mechanics work. Protection potions mandatory. 
---
Sapphiron- each player needs frost resist gear. Each player needs to hide behind ice pillars. Protection potions mandatory.
---
KT- each player needs to be on their A game killing the adds in p1. In p2 he spawns void zones that kill you very quickly if you don't move out. You really can't afford to be losing players on this fight as it's extremely mana intensive on the healers. Protection potions required.
---
If you've ever done LFR you know how difficult it is to get everyone in your raid to do something. Now multiply this by 2 because it's 40 man. AQ+ is no joke.
---
Because the ret paladin is contributing a lot less to the raid.
---
Done like 150 runs so far and seen the Zevrim book once... And gotten 1 Foror's so far out of probably 30-40 books.
---
Not to mention it was the coolest mount ever. Grinded dailies for ages but it was so worth it
---
Harsh. We are two for two on Rag/perds now.
---
My dad (1960) and mom (1957) both play retail a decent amount.
---
But even then, at the moment the only bosses that can fuck it up for everyone else is rag and geddon, and geddon requires a special brand of stupid to fuck up at.
---
This screen shot and OPs screen shot prove nothing. Crazy how this nuts drop happens and no one thinks to take a screen shot of the loot on the boss. *Thinking*
---
Dude unusual pastimes? They are pretending to have sex with video game characters lol
---
For better or worse, Classic has taken enough of my life away. Not planning on giving what little I have left to retail.
---
This is correct.  I would like to add that I also sometimes pop zerker rage at the beginning then switch back to D stance.  I generate additional rage from the damage I will take anyway!
---
2 warlocks should be able to Curse of Tongues each other and have a conversation in Demonic. Would make sense but Ohhh wellllll
---
So there's no second rez, ok.
---
Looking at your data, I'm glad I charge a flat fee for the MC recipes. Everything else is whatever you want to tip, but I'm not getting stiffed on those. People are cheap af.
---
I'm the last healing priest in my guild who hasnt gotten Eye..... lost it last week to our shadow. hoping this is the week. 
---
5 weeks with only winning tier boots, gotten 2 other pieces because no one else wanted them. i dont mind not getting loot but this is just ridiculous
---
what about playing a bit less worse? ^^
---
Wow! Haven't heard that one before
---
What I’ve been using is Charge -&gt; Berserker stance -&gt; Berserker rage -&gt; whirlwind -&gt; battle stance -&gt; T-clap -&gt; Defensive stance -&gt; demo shout + bloodrage -&gt; Shield Slam &gt; Revenge &gt; Sunder 
---
Once I reach shield slam in the rotation, I only focus on elites. I use this rotation for Strat packs and it seems to work pretty well.  If you use a 2h or a slower 1h you can cut T-clap out of the rotation. I’m using a 1.9 speed weapon, so my WW hits like a wet noodle. 
---
Disclaimer: In longer fights, T-clap/demoshout  will be a TPS loss, it’s only for holding snap agro on nonelites, and mitigating damage from hard hitting mobs.
---
It was the second time they opened transfers that really fucked the balance. It was pretty 50/50 and when the second wave opened all the alliance transferred from their servers to be on what was at the time a balanced server. None of the horde transferred at all.
---
i keep mine hidden and tell people im resto even though im actually enhancement
---
It literally says both in the title and the picture itself......

https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759546893

?
---
Serious question: what raiding spec are you expecting them to be running as dagger/sword?
---
You will need a healer. Firstly to get through the torch room and secondly because the emp hits hard whilst enraged.
---
Can you stop shitting on my priest friend's melee build. Thanks.
---
50s because worse case you only get 1g out of the box
---
It’s funny how the non raid DPS specs in classic are now retail’s PvP spec lol. Mage-Fire, Druid- Boomkin, Warrior-Arms
---
We literally see it here on Reddit daily. Maybe they aren't boomers actually getting pissed but people get mad and there are viral news articles about people being mad. Nobody cares about the majority, people care what is visible. Just like everything else in life.
---
A N A L N I G G A L O V E
---
Iam also on Mirage Raceway, feeing like I stroke gold on choosing this server, the population is amazing and tried Pyrewood and turned back to Mirage again
---
I flew from Theramore to Darnassus for 6 silver as a direct flight flying over Auberdine. The trick is to not have any other flight paths in Kalimdor lol.
---
earthfury balanced as *fuck* boys we out here
---
1 À € 1 1 Ä 2 ‡   is the text

75-100g

It's actually really good on Horde side with the windfury totem.
---
&gt;Is it okay to roll on an items even if you can‘t wear them in the foreseeable future or am i overreacting?
---
20-24 can be done in a few hours, what are you on about lmao. Also why did you have him in the group if he aint allowed to roll need on stuff he NEEDS?
---
You are certainly a special breed of asshole.
---
Get out of here you sneaky rogue
---
Warlocks lost the most class fantasy? *Druids have entered the chat* lol
---
Feral Druid? Literally instant invite everywhere because everyone is looking for a tank. Does really well too especially if you have leather gear similar to your level (ton of armor).
---
If you play PVE Mirage Raceway is a great server by my experience, I also have a PVP alt on Golemagg and feel like the server is pretty balance and friendly
---
As Somebody who plays the game at fucking ton, I love that there is basically unobtainable ranks like this. Add way more prestige to the idea
---
wait...no not me, "they" need to fix it.
---
this is going to be really stupid but: 
---
this is my first time playing WoW and I picked herbalism and alchemy. I'm currently staking out the free action potion recipe. I've been here periodically clicking and watching twitch for the past 3 hours and I swear it has not spawned. 
---
Does anyone know what the respawn timer is? I'm at the point where this is now about pride and I won't go to bed until I've got it.
---
This only works for retail.
---
Maybe because you are playing in the last possible patch where everything is nerfed. You could run 2 splits in MC right now if you want to speedrun it. Thats why you see on private servers thst they have to increase the difficulty by themselves. Also only few mechanics on bosses. This is why classic is a joke and i laugh everytime i see a picture on here by people getting happy to cleat it like its an achiecement. Shieeet even normal in retail is harder.
---
Burnycinders taken? :(
---
I did read the post. I read it again and still don't want to change my response.
---
FIRE does better DPs, always. I leveled 1-57 as fire and never looked back. I was accepted into some spellcleave grps and did quite well. Blast wave then frost nova. Works great.
---
This was... *sheds small tear* ... **Beautiful**
---
this guy gets it
---
No way!!! TIL!
---
I loved playing my paladin, I specced differently (25/26/0) since I was done tanking 5-mans and was strictly for PVP.  But I had basically BIS gear (corrupted ashbringer, tier t2.5 and t2) and was a PVP monster.  You can still be a very strong paladin though with purely heal gear and the best 2h you can find as Reck bombs will do a ton of damage even without bis.  If you're only a healbot with reck bombs you're still a tremendous asset on a PVP team.
---
Mograine PVP server with more Alliance, that is pretty interesting.
---
It is especially interesting because when I created my character about a month ago, the population % was reversed. Maybe allies just like pve more.
---
And as a suggestion I think it would be cool if you showed the types of the server on the website.
---
Edit: if I understand right this just shows raiders? Which really tells us a fuckton of people did MC.
---
Oh, right on.
---
I sold it lol. Don't focus on guides too much. You and even the seasoned players get tunnel vision on these guides. 
---
 Once I read the stats I could not think if any situation I would ever be in where I would use it to escape. Does way to much damage for 60% ? What lol you wanna get one shot by someone inna epic mount ?
---
That would make it 440 stacks of cloth.
---
it's the best when the mage in my group tries to lecture me how to aoe when I'm leading in damage done and he keeps arcane explosioning after he frost novas
---
Hunter don't get anything from jujus power. Except you want them to use juju on their per for extra dkp
---
Yeah the dots feels off
---
oh ok. that makes sense. I would put a note on that saying it especially if sharing it in a post like this though just to avoid confusion.
---
Don’t know the exact respawn timer but I know the competition has ramped up big time on FAP recipe compared to b4
---
There are plenty plenty of tank weapons that also provide similar TPS, but there are few weapons that add as much damage to the raid.  Its worth giving to your DPS as your raid will benefit more overall.
---
Plus threat isn't even an issue in classic
---
If they determined he lied in a report, I would certainly hope so.
---
OP should just submit a ticket. If there name is really bad, I'm sure they will force a name change.
---
okboomer
---
It really depends on which GM answers your ticket. Guildie of mine had his 300 tailoring restored.
---
I play classic casually (just hit 40). Don't see a problem.
---
hm ok. so im halfway there-ish.
---
love sweedish shamans
---
Could someone explain to me what phase 2 means?
---
Ahhh! Thank you, I always thought something was wrong with my details, only shows peoples spec sometimes. Gotcha
---
Wow!haventheardthatonebefore
---
It's because people are lvling alts at this point and it's technically faster to lvl solo while questing then in a group.
---
ya I'm a really really small fry compared to the players and the amount of gold i've seen splashed around but FAP is my one way to make some gold for that epic mount
---
To make different time for them to return back to body.
---
You sir. Have absolutely no idea what your talking about. 
---
https://youtu.be/ADSwIHHTqD0
---
Yes yes but its so boring that one can just aswell kill oneself.
---
Someone needs to be the bad guys so that you can crusade against them forever.
---
"Remembering the great times I had with friends". You guys played together for like what, 5 weeks? You sound like that guy who falls in love after a first date. Chill dude =D
---
If you don’t like gtfo let others be happy
---
"Being hip and flip." Lol
---
Was leading an UBRS Red/Jed run. Forgot to dismiss pet on jump and wiped the raid. Raid disbanded immediately. Felt so dumb.
---
Orc, level 60 vs a level 54 isnt too fair!
---
Literally the reason why I bought the wolf mount on my druid. Worth.
---
Why are you gear shaming?
---
I'm on Whitemane and had a good social leveling experience. Are you Horde or Alliance? Ally on Whitemane are pretty chill, except for a couple of bad guilds. I've heard bad things about Horde on Whitemane. SMOrc is a huge Horde guild that can be pretty dickish.
---
The content of classic wow is being time-gated in phases 1-6.  This is to provide everyone with a recreation of the release of the original game.  They are content patches.  Phase 1 was obviously the release of classic.  Phase 2 introduces the ranked PvP system and PvP rewards (oh yeah and world bosses).  People are talking about phase 2 prep so much recently because right now there are absolutely no rewards or rankings for PvP.  This all changes, however when phase 2 is released.
---
Phase 3 includes PvP battlegrounds, and the next raid tier.  The subsequent phases reintroduce additional raid tiers, PvP battegrounds, and world events.
---
I sit in the sofa, my supreme genetics don't need those fancy chairs. I also were r14 and I drive Ferrari, large cock also.
---
My friend got me to try a retail character (first time) and....I can't get into it. Some qol changes are nice (aoe loot) but most of them are pretty lame to me. Personal loot is more annoying than rolling, for one.
---
Made me look forward to BGs though! That was pretty fun
---
I don't know if it's just my server but everyone just expects me to lockpick everything.
---
Even in dungeons they expect me to just unlock boxes for free to claim loot they wouldn't even have access to without me.
---
&gt;:(
---
How the fuck do you solo dme as druid
---
It's a shame that fire does more aoe dmg then frost but grps only want that talented slow.
---
Of the 4 people I know that play this game (myself included,) 2 are married with kids and the third is married. The fourth is probably as you say.
---
So in my personal experience, most classic wow players are happily married. This is of course a very large sample size and a perfectly valid sociological analysis.
---
Can you elaborate how you're gonna solo farm zf gy as a mage at lvl 45ish?
---
I'm genuinely interested cause I would love to do this.
---
No i just used it yesterday it works for classic.
---
I either tank as pure dps. Sweeping strike and whirlwind and cleave etc. 
---
Or I tank purely in defensive stance with swore and board. 
---
I don’t give a fuck about threat as I just use taunt on CD. And ofc I use sunder and revenge when I am in tank gear. 
---
I don’t feel any responsibility for someone dying at all. But I always try to get aggro back as much as I want. I never tell anyone to go slow. Go ham or go home and I taunt on CD.
---
We'll have cross server BGs from the start so it shouldn't be 40min queues
---
They don't notice 2h? c:
---
Pets don't lose happiness when you log out. I dunno why you lied on the internet or why people are eating it up.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/restoration
---
10 silver
---
Typically the green in there is worth around 60 silver.  I think that’s more than fair.
---
If they're smart they will.   But then again, if they were smart, they wouldn't release pvp rewards without bgs to begin with.   
---
This is going to be a fucking disaster that will forever hurt the game.   So many good people are going to quit the game, because of cancerous shit bags.
---
Hopefully more
---
ah ok thanks, wasn't familiar with this setup.
---
Loopholing rule 5 with low effort memes.
---
They also power level and sell accounts. They are scum.
---
If you have a class quest book already. It is unique and you cannot pick it up when you open a tome. This will make it despawn. Are you sure this is not what happend to you?
---
Look at the style of the tattoo. It's clearly going for a " artist sketch" look. What you're criticizing is literally intentional....I agree that some of the thinner lines aren't the cleanest, but this isn't 5/10 execution at all. This is a great tattoo and the unclear lines in parts are completely unnoticed due to the over all style of the tattoo. It's not supposed to look super clean. It's obviously supposed to look like sketch/comic type art.
---
 /use [@cursor] item name
---
To use a grenade without having to confirm location, not sure about the other part sorry!
---
Ohh look at my comment history next! You sad, pathetic loser.
---
That video is a very good example of how tone and cadence affect the meaning conveyed in speech.
---
what do the private realm players do that isn't common in WoW?
---
i can say OK ZOOMR back so fuck em
---
0g they open my lockbox in a dungeon or they don't get heals
---
And bank and forge and reagent vendor
---
I keep getting in fights with people who use i think maybe at trinket that spawns multiple human NPCs that fight for them, anyone know the name of this item?
---
The raid system is really stupid early phase. I mean 40 people rolling on 3 item per bossomce a week. What are the odd? After 1 month of raiding I got nothing. Its all about luck. Me im just waiting for pvp.
---
 after ??
---
I literally hearthstoned back to IF, logged out, then when logged in I had no pet. I don't know what happened and I didn't say that pets lose happiness when we log out.
---
I don't care if people believe it or not I'm just telling what happened to me.
---
currently planning on doing something like this for rank 12
---
Yeah that was the only other thing I could think of and you're right I don't want to wait that long. Runecloth grind it is!
---
So dumb. I got troll rep then found out we couldn't ride raptors...
---
I'd be ashamed if I had to chug consumables to win.  I'd rather take the loss than pay to win.
---
Thank you, I'll go check it out!
---
You basically shield yourself and holy nova through them i guess?
---
Lol get killed ally scum
---
When do you plan on playing mostly and are you coming over with a tank or not?  
---
There's about 6 alliance guilds raiding think something like 8 raid teams across them. Dunno if any are recruiting.  
---
Finding groups is mostly a question of whether you have a tank or not and when you're playing.  After 10pm server time dungeons feel like they don't happen unless you have a tank.  
---
AH is hit or miss.  Many things sell but pricing is weird and stuff like green items don't move very well.
---
why should he? its not like anyone is posting sources or anything. you are all just guessing
---
At least you can walk up stairs without getting stuck on the bottom step #undeadfemaleproblems
---
Nothing to go off of unfortunately 😔
---
Generally there’s a correlation between people who leave shitty comments and their post tend to be despicable people.
---
Shockingly they also tend to be lonely and can’t seem to understand with their “big IQ” why that correlates with their ego. Must be because they’re so much smarter than everyone right?
---
Cuz you will never kill the world bosses.
---
Since Goblins are somewhat neutral in classic, I think it could make sense that they’d teach anyone (also gnomes for alliance), but yeah I mean if there was a world of Arcanum then engineering should be mandatory for everyone, but since there isn’t, I’d really like to see everyone using it- given when WoW is set, it doesn’t seem too far-fetched, we’ve already got the tram and the airship. It would just be nice not to have to “optimize” any character I plan on PvPing with by sacrificing a profession slot. (Sure, I don’t technically “have” to, but I think it’s clear what I mean?)
---
Mafia in Un'Goro?
---
You should buy the one I put up on AH for 95g.

---
Of all time? Thanks man
---
Hmm it's barov peasant caller on horde...dunno what the equivalent is on alliance side
---
Do what discouraged, spec what you want. I’m always happy to take in a fire mage. The dps is fine if I’m tanking, it’s not about what’s better it’s about what’s fun. It’s so crazy to be that ppl really do this spell cleave aoe toxic mentality that if you aren’t frost spec you are useless
---
I have my own rogue alt.
---
But you should totally tip them at least a dozen gold.
---
I wont lie go back to retail sort of gets me when horde yell it because ive not played retail for years and years 
---
id be less offended if i played retail lol
---
Your pet regenerates ~25 focus every 5 seconds. That would barely be enough to do one claw or one growl, and you can't prioritize what spell your pet will use, which means it will cast growl or claw at random if both are toggled.
---
Ditto for Bite+Claw. Bite isn't prioritized, which means you need to manually bite/claw to be using Bite over Claw, which is way too much work for an extremely small dps increase.
---
Some but the actual textures often look more like actual paint due to the new (and I think shittier) art style.
---
No retail is on the ground behind the ass.
---
Clearly it is horse poop.
---
For the price, get it and hold. Buy/make and equip the black dragonscale set instead, skip boots.
---
Uhhhh what? You think spending time to earn in-game gold, using that gold to buy in-game, on-use items, and then using those items in PVP engagements is pay to win? 
---
Also, you can't "chug" consumables in WoW. Potions have a 2-minute cooldown and most fights are decided well before cooldowns are up. 
---
Following your logic that potions are pay to win, so are epic mounts, BOEs, and enchants on gear. I don't mean to be rude, but this is just a dumb take.
---
Nah. Wrath HC dungeons were stupid easy \*and\* threat was irrelevant by the time Wrath rolled around. Threat is actually relevant in Classic.
---
Even when I go travel or cat form the game still treats my dimensions as _kodo mounted cow_. It made questing tough as the anorexic trolls and forsaken wild squeeze through a hole in a fence while I run repeatedly into an invisible barrier.
---
P2 in a couple of days, what should you stock up on? I levelled 60 only last sunday but have managed to get some prebis parts, t1 shoulders and stacked a bit om stamina to survive longer as a rogue, pretty much all im doing is farming gold and doing one dungeon to get the bracers from DM:W, but what do I use the gold for? Right now I've only bought mongoose elixirs.
---
Planning to farm with 1-2 other rouges in a group of three as it seems right now so getting healthpots etc to be able to win and get an advantage in fights is all I can think of using the gold for.
---
Trade skill master is the other one I can think of off the top of my head.
---
It's a target rich environment!
---
oh heck
---
Alliance have all the cool things to say. Like what can horde say?
---
you can't, you have to use preemptively
---
I never really minded being outnumbered by the horde on stalagg. It does get annoying when we get camped by like 6v2, but that’s life on a pvp server sometimes. Me and a buddy would go out and hunt horde when we could and it was a blast simply because there were tons of targets for us. But some of our other friends really can’t stand the ganks and would like some more balance. Can’t say I blame them, I just personally never minded being the underdog. Our biggest concern was always just finding groups for dungeons as well as working the AH which we try our best to do. We are worried that if as much people leave stalagg as we been hearing, it’s just going to make grouping and selling things so much harder
---
Plus alts.
---
Well, what can you do when there's faces to stab?
---
was looking for this comment, yep all gaming chairs are pretty much shit with very few exceptions. Ive got a herman miller for 250 and I havent had any back problems/sitting problems ever since I bought one. If you sit down a lot, seriously consider investing in one because it could save you a lot in physical issues
---
Spamming consumables is p2w.   Sorry chud.  They cost several gold, and you are blowing them every time you fight.  The only people that can compete against that are people buying gold, or playing constantly to farm gold.  
---
Even if you are the no life farmer, it is still giving you an unfair advantage over most people.
---
Explaining dignity, self respect, and morals to a pirated server player is impossible.
---
What alt would need that item?
---
I dont buy anything from the Blizzard store and have paid for my sub and xpacs with gold for a while now, so I dont give Blizz any of my money. If youre playing Classic and paying for your sub, youre paying more than I am bud.
---
That’s how you get them not to break!!!!
---
Dude I gave up on the nail thing when I was younger because they would always break I just figured I got weak nails haha
---
Great job!
---
When have you ever seen white loot in a lockbox? You’re overly inflating your importance. I can bring that lockbox back to a capital city and tip a rogue there if anybody is going to whine about picking my lockbox in a dungeon. And sure you can bring your own food, and then hearth out, most people don’t and it saves them money even if they did. It’s a teamwork mentality and I hope I’m not in a group with you.
---
That is a messed up reference.
---
Omfg. You are shit.  You know that of course, but helluva way to embrace it. 
---
And you bred..,fuck sake. Why?
---
I disenchanted my brutality blade instead of applying poisons. I then had to wait 15 days to restore it because I had just used the item restoration service to restore a different item.
---
I tend to go for 25s per tier.

---
My buddies and I are starting a 5 man leveling team.  So far we have a:
---
Warrior
---
Druid
---
Warlock 
---
What should I go as a fifth? I'm thinking mage for the CC/vending machine.
---
Second that
---
So can you use it. In equip and still have the effect?
---
 This is only purely 1v1 situation. 
---
 Thanks for the insight.
---
&gt;Maybe allies just like pve more.
---
Paladins &gt;&gt; shamans for PvE in Classic. And horde racials are superior for PvP.
---
90 percentile is not really high.
---
97+ you will have threat issues if your tank is not geared. In my raid basically everyone is at the verge of pulling aggro and they have to juggle taunt with 2 fury tanks to keep threat.
---
Can’t relate. My only Tauren was a druid so I don’t use mounts after travel forms
---
Why would horde be able to spawn on alliance-owned graveyards and vice versa? Only neutral ones are shared I think.
---
same as warlock and priest.
---
Paladin Tank, which is honestly becoming my main lately.
---
Mods please take down this repost. See it all the time one Reddit. I think one of the bots might be broken? Mods? 
---
 Thanks.
---
Heals don't seem that had to come by.
---
Is bigglesworth really 30:70? I play alliance and it feels horde favoured but I didn't think it was quite that severe.
---
All the reflector trinkets, luffa, skull of impending doom, etc are all PvP trinkets that you should have on your trinket bar
---
Is that Donald from darklegacy?
---
This thin sells for 10g on my server sometimes less...
---
Group of people fixed the price and you were either joined up or you got killed. They have people on both sides so if you weren't playing ball they would attack you and attempt to take your leather.
---
Group loot puts emphasis on need &gt; greed, theoretically players should prioritize personal use within the group &gt; sale for use by an external player.
---
I would argue that the gold value of BoE Blue and Epic items outweighs their usefulness and should be greed &gt; need, but you'd definitely have to explain that atypical position and get party member buy in upfront if you want the group to abide by that.
---
Yep. Tyler1 got to Challenger in LoL while sitting in a wooden kitchen chair and using a $5 HP mouse.
---
Seems relevant https://youtu.be/YersIyzsOpc
---
I mean it’s a human city technically so yeah Tauren shouldn’t fit
---
Just wait until phase 2
---
Sometimes the game even interupts your energy tick and you get 40 on the next one. I think it's not a display bug because therr are situations where you can't evicerate at 34 energy but you can at 36. No clue if this is intentional but it seems not.
---
I used to play alliance and misused the moo glade Druid flightpoint - dn
---
Then I tried the same for hord 
---
Omg should have used the HS 
---
It took the scenic route to TB .....
---
Is it some sort of cultural thing? Never heard it before as a Swede
---
Yea just ignore the several pieces of raid gear equipped.
---
They blocked you for that? Jeez, you opened the door for an entertaining conversation and the dude ran from that interaction and safespaced you
---
Definitely not on mine, but never said I paid an extravagant price for it. I mostly mean in general, I end up dropping gold on gear for my other character.
---
Small value BoEs should be greed for all. Once value of BoE exceeds say 100g the group should agree to all need, especially in a pug. Only exception is if you’re running with a guild group and have a specific person that’s going to get it. 
---
A very chill group will just greed on everything. Don’t be the asshole ninja. When in Rome, roll like the Romans.
---
Imagine taking pride in being slow and inefficient lmao
---
No no, you don't need to do that, all you need to do is show that any spec of warrior can tank a 5-man as long as they have a shield handy.
---
It seems to be an ongoing joke to see someone type "LFG Fury Spec", and then for the next hour that same person is typing "LF1M tank"
---
you know casters can squeeze in melee hits while wanding ?
---
he is 41 so this will help him level quite a bit. i dont see a problem here ?
---
Yeah... the one you're using.
---
Details has a TinyThreat plugin.
---
What UI is this?
---
Interesting, I never saw eye/leaf reserved on my server.
---
It's only counting players who use Warcraft Logs. I've been raiding for over a month and dont even know what that is
---
Selling those kind of seats should be a criminal offense.

They're 50g+ on mine.  :(

I feel like we have a slightly different idea of what it means to be raid ready.
---
Yeah 90 is not high enough to worry about TPS probably. The difference in dps between 90s and 99s is often more than the difference between 90 and 50.
---
He’s right about raid daggers being tank prio in good guilds, but I wouldn’t worry about it until you’re doing &lt;50 min MC with furies pushing like 900dps single target.
---
We already saw what happens when we go on the TBC path and no one likes where it ended. If you want that, go play retail.

In the 90th does not mean "90"

Also are you horde?  Alliance has salv, which i am.

That and, if you don't think being in the top 10% of damage dealt isn't "high" i genuinely have no idea what to tell you.

At the end of the day your guild will do your thing and we will do ours.

I leveled fire mage and respeced in my 50's to frost and half way through my first BFD run I decided that I hated it and it went back to fire. I get whispers every time I am on from people looking for AOE runs and have to tell them that I am not the mage they are looking for. Leveling people constantly complained I was fire mage but I didn't have to worry about getting kicked as my husband was the healer in the group and if I go he goes too.
---
That is craxy how much prices can vary between servers. I paid 25g for it, which was something I was willing to do considering most listings over the past couple weeks had been 35+. I usually watch the items i want for awhile before buying and try to snag a better price
---
That’s ok though. This isn’t journalism, it’s reddit. It’s up for the reader to discern how to think for themselves.
---
Oh man that hurts.
---
Cool, that's not the norm though.
---
DM north 6 bug packs, 1 dog pack  + Guard'Moldar farm. Manage your Innervate CD smartly so you have one for the boss as you also might need one for the dogs depending on how many dogs there is (can be 4 to 6).  I have gear with like \~200 SP for this so goes faster. Also if you pull hyienas and Moldar you can just reset by  jumping on that brick fence there.

&gt; if you appealed and it got upheld, that means you definitely are guilty
---
I fully empathize with you saying this because that’s exactly how I felt before, whenever seeing posts like this. I always brushed them off because I figured, Blizz would never fuck something like this up, they would surely get it right, and the guys just probably guilty but wants a second chance, it’s just another sop story.
---
I sincerely hope this never happens to you or anyone else who plays Classic. Just imagine for a second you actually truly didn’t do anything wrong but got an email one day saying you’re banned for 6 months. Then obviously you’d think, clearly it’s a mistake and surely it will get sorted by appeal. It’s just mind boggling and depressing.
---
I hope to post an update this week when they sort it. If they haven’t sorted it, I can’t really bring myself to play blizz games anymore. But I am hopeful it won’t come to that
---
You do realize you can charge money right?

Yes, I’m sure that’s what’s going on here, lmfao

World record mage to level 10 time (not counting private server) xD

You cant kill them but you can survive most fights.

I lvled as holy and a bunch of fights I just used the instant heals, dispel and fear and just ran away.
---
Anyone know or have a list of rares that have decent drops?
---
Nothing will ever beat the Hordes "go to retail"
---
My guild won't let me forget it.
---
This is false. Shamans give windfury, they have chain heal, totem buffs, reincarnation.... Why would you think paladins are better for pve? Paladins have buffs and are good tank healers, but that's nothing compared to the utility shamans bring with windfury and totems. Shaman raid heals are probably the best in the game.

Rebind A and D as strafe left and right instead of turn,  use mouse to turn

Fastest to 10 is 1.04 (which is me aswell on Paladin)

This is the fastest level 10 time on Mage.
---
People think its an achievement like it was back in vanilla. Thats not true so gtfo yourself trying to prove anything. Us old school people had to sweat and tears us through that shit. You will never get that same feeling 15 years later.
---
They can be happy all they want, i wont stop them. Its just a joke when the threads mention how its such a big achievement when its not. For christ sake you can easily 20 man onyxia. That wasn't the case 15 years ago when they released it.
---
I have the luxury of being able to farm during offpeak hours. I'm also a rogue with mining.
---
BRD farming has been good to me. But i wonder what are the best mining routes i can try? I was thinking silithus for ooze covered rich thorium, or burning steppes for rich thorium and dark iron.
---
You have more stuff grats 😁
---
It’s really good in the hands of a skilled player, you’re supposed to take off the debuff after you get rid of cc on your character (I usually wait for 2nd sheep to break it since I got a lot of hp/mana)
---
As a mage I wouldn’t be too concerned having it. It’d be useful I guess against mages in 1v1s, but I’m not too familiar with mage vs mage matchup if it’s optimal using it at all but I know I’d want it in my bags if I had the chance
---
I never ask for tips but I usually get between 20s-1g per box, more if they have me open more than one in a row. The most common tip I get is 50s though.
---
Well, an actual coordinated group of four mages or 3 mages with a lock wouldn't need blizzard either.  Just shatter combo with flamestrike.  Everything dies instantly.  Source:. Level 60 in 5 days after launch.  Tanks are for noobs.
---
meh, warlocks would make a better use of it with firestone
---
if blizzard wont fix it, the community should band together to fix this problem, its in everyone's interest to have balanced servers. be the change you want to see. i will stay with the alliance on skeram.
---
you are missing some juju\`s from winterspring :D
---
You can still heal everything pre BRD with ease as shadow. I never tried anything past BRD as I respected holy by then.
---
I had a warr kick me for not being resto in a BRD group on my ele shaman, told him i could still heal he just responded with "sorry". 40 mins later he inv me to heal since he still  didn't have a healer, i just declined it lol.
---
Cool addon! I assume it's like questie? Looks sharp!
---
I like that you’re active in a sub about building social skills.
---
Clearly. But you refuse to say the word in here because of the rules. But you get into Barrens chat and believe you can get away with it? Good luck, lol. No spine.
---
Oh damn lol, that's a pretty good racket
---
Protection is better for most people because it has tools for damage mitigation and threat generation. 
---
Fury WITH protection is a much more difficult spec that CAN be better than deep protection if you’re well geared and focused 100% of the time. It has potential for higher threat generation through how much rage it generates, and how much more damage it does. The big downside is that it puts a lot more pressure on your healer, especially if your bad at stance dancing and shield swapping. 
---
Arms is just straight up worse for tanking than either of those options.
---
I hope the next time you get pizza they put ketchup instead of sauce
---
So you fear the only alliance guild left who is currently making videos crying on how the server is ruined due to problems they themselves created? Because said horde guilds no longer have  reason to work with them?
---
Why do ppl post this non relevant and personal opinion dumb stuff... you crave recognition that much? Go play bfa so you can get achievements on par of your achievement...

Curious, how does it.

Can’t have warlocks speak demonic. Nah. Got a give that to demon hunters. Cause you know, they speak to the Desmond they kill.
---
Not like streaming, the mafia is a horde guild and an alliance guild cooperating to share devilsaurs and call out non mafia members for execution if they are eyeing up a devilsaur themself
---
&gt;even if you can‘t wear them in the foreseeable future or am i overreacting?
---
I wouldn't call 4 levels "future"

Literally everyone does this, not just Ally, not just horde. It's everywhere, it sucks but that's wpvp for ya.

---
Bonus points for complaining LOL HEALERS Y UR GEAR SO BAD I KEEP DIEING
---
leveling engineering, also epic mount is a huge + in pvp aswell
---
sure, but only in the case where you -need- to heal (tank gettin hit hard) and are low mana should you spam that, otherwise it's probably more beneficial to wait for a bit to regen mana for bigger heals.
---
Do you even read the threads?
---
If nlizz can handle the pr nightmare of sucking China dick they can handle banning people on pvp servers

Barrens and STV never. ending. quests.

It records all aspects of a pve fight, it can be used to improve player performance or see where mistakes are happening etc. Its alot more useful in retail though.

I said it was harder back then compared to now. Are you stupid?

Do you really not know what warcraft logs is? I find that super interesting, its been a thing in wow for as long as I can remember. Before warcraft logs it was world of logs, before that it was something else, in vanilla and tbc there was even the swstats aggregate site.
---
this is what i love about classic, gear matter while leveling, theres nothing i love more than buying good items for my alts, im leveling a warlock atm (level 36) and i have 245 in engineering so i can use a Green lens of shadow power, a staff of jordan and 2 Underworld bands

I’m about to ding 40 as a Tauren warrior. Where do I get my mount and how does it work? I need to buy the ability to ride and otherwise does it matter which one I get?

Not really.
---
You are consistently faster by just using a skinning knife with fiery/crusader. Just saying.
---
This problem has given me serious thought on race changing from a Dranaei paladin to a Human paladin.  Constantly get stuck on geometry when using *Divine Steed* as it is an Elekk mount which is massive!
---
Blinking on cd is pretty much the same travel speed as Travel Form if I remember correctly from running to dungeon entrances together with some Mages while leveling.
---
To bad its shitty weather and construction on the picture!

If you find the guide, let me know. Leveling my Paladin is going sooo slowly at 33 that I’m about ready to give up on it 😂
---
you misspelled servers as "Sersers"

Hoping for the T1 Chest tonight to be 8/8 when P2 releases.

The lv40 Mount is my goal too! My lock is 38 and a half- I’m hoping I can get to 40 tomorrow! 😬

Stop being a pussy, it's just a joke and something like this shouldn't be off limits especially years later. I know it's 2019 and it's cool to be offended by literally anything but give it a rest.
---
I hadn't played WoW since TBC until Classic came around. I havent heard it mentioned in Discord or Guild chat though, everyone uses DBM in my guild and we've got things on farm now so maybe  that level of optimization isnt necessary at this Phase.
---
Eh, i play hunter so i don't even know what threat is.
---
its almost like the city isn't made for big ass cows riding other cows inside. Who would have thought.
---
Blessing of salvation is the best buff in the game. Tank threat is the ceiling if your pushing yourselves in PvE.

its not bad but that does not stop ali from bitching about being camped 24/7 and horde camping 24/7

i really think its just a difference in mentality of the different player base, the server is pretty balanced but its never alliance camping people/areas for hours, they just kill people and move on to whatever they were doing

Not saying gaming chairs are any better or worse than good office chairs, but you know they have mesh gaming chairs right?

I guess my original post should have been more clear — I meant maps of the dungeons themselves, not just where they are located on the world map. Does Atlas have that too or am I just missing it?
---
Shield with a mithril or thorium spike + blessing of sanctuary. Holy shield is optional if you want consecration first but for me holy shield performed better so I took consecration later because it really doesn't do a lot of damage compared to the mana it costs.
---
It's very fun and you can easily take 4-5 mobs your level at a time however finding clusters of mobs that don't have casters among them is a pain in the ass. It's even worse when you add in the fact that these spots are usualy farmed by players of your level and 60 alike so it's sometimes impossible to do any grinding.
---
Of course.
---
You can play a draenei?
---
Yes I generally agree, but sometimes you have no ability to fake or juke casts.  if you're almost dead and have no LOS, no other cooldown available, etc.  You have no choice but to try flash spam on yourself to hope you get rescued, and in that instance you might as well get it.  Maybe it'll save your life!  Toughness is a valid choice too, as it's guaranteed reduction in damage versus melee but it is less than 1% per point.  Personally I found myself more able to win fights vs melee in general so I was less in love with toughness.  
---
I would note it's only two points in the prot tree for a PVP focus, usually I would do 3/3 improved hammer and 2/3 improved conc, but sure you could take those 2 points into toughness before moving into reckoning or maybe blessing of Sanc if you have some PVE aspirations. 
---
+1 for the resist talents in the holy tree that's definitely a part of any PVP build.

You can do the skip method. Run on the edge of walls until you find torchbearer, stand in corner to reset aggro and just kill him then jump back up.

---
&gt; both people have to download details for it to work
---
I got kicked out of a run because I "hadn't used any of my talents" by some idiot who refused to understand this.
---
I picked a female tauren and waited for epic mount to get wolf. It was worth it.
---
Ohhhhhhh gooooood luck mate
---
Which i think is great.  PvP at instance portals is as lame as it gets.  People dying while they stand there helpless in the load screen.  People getting feared behind the portal and getting stuck behind an invisible wall.  People who are locked out and fighting from behind the portal where melee can't reach them.  All lame
---
Group auras are not even close to as good as totems. With multiple shamans you can get multiple buffs AND windfuries which can't be understated. Seal of light isn't used much by paladins unless you have paladins that are specced into it because the duration is so low and you don't have time to melee the boss to refresh the cd. Shamans also have earth shock and purge which is really useful for certain raids. 
---
Blessing of salvation is mostly good when you have people who can't manage their threat properly. Threat management is a skill and not just a game mechanic. As long as people aren't otherwise pulling off the tank, salv isn't doing anything. Windfury provides an enormous DPS boost to tanks and DPS.
---
As a male tauren with a wolf can you fit?
---
What really irks me is even with savory deviate delight, we still don’t fit!
---
"and the tauren said, '13 inches!'"
---
Lol this creepy weird guy who likes stalking people’s profile just wrote a whole essay on why he’s creepy. Shut up loser.
---
This is the way I handle it, always mark a skull on either cloth elite or non elites. You wont win the agro on that mob but it will die super quick and will give you time to sunder elites. Dont worry holding agro on non elites unless they start hitting your healer.
---
Few examples:
---
Stratholme: 3 elite zombies, 4 or so non elites. Mark non elite casters with a skull (due to pats and makes it easier to move away). Charge &gt; demo  &gt; tab between elites and sunder one each &gt; continue tanking
---
LBRS: 2 elite casters, 3 elite mele, 2 dogs. Mark elite caster with skull &gt; charge &gt; demo &gt; pioritise mele elites with sunders &gt; mark next caster with skull when other dies &gt; tank the rest.
---
This is what works for me. Depending on group composition and how good the healer/dps is, you can quickly assign sheep/sap/shackle.
---
Bind raid markers :)
---
Poly, kill totems
---
You're right, but I'm working on a career change instead. One of my job requirements is that they have those nice Herman Miller or Steelcase chairs. 
---
Also I get up and move around a lot, I can't sit still for long in any setting.
---
And you didn't buy it?! You done goofed
---
It's so much work to do it manually unless you have a macro..I just have it on auto.
---
TLDR:  to hit crap at 60, 5% hit cap (unless a raid boss)
---
Thanks man, appreciate the info!
---
Just checked and it worked to write loser by removing one of the 1s.
---
You should need it if your current spec can use it, unless nobody in your group needs it then I guess you can all need for the cash
---
Allright. Thought ppl didnt want you in dungeon groups if you were shadowpriest.

The amount of "helping to level" does not worth the amount of gold spent.

If you are dual wielding the hit cap for white damage is 24% (base 5% + 19% dual wield penalty) outside of raids.
---
For rogues white damage is 45-55% of your total damage. So +hit past 5% is well worth it.
---
Also weapon skill changes the hit cap.
---
Did you read me then? The value of hit is 40+ attack power per 1% hit rating. So your 9  ap and 0.9 crit is nothing compared to that even if you are hitcapped.
---
It never hurts being above hit cap for white/offhand. Being over hit cap is exponentially better than being over the Crit cap.
---
Clearly you know nothing about BiS...

Thanks so much!

This is why every tauren needs to get exalted with winterspring faction, so you can get the wolf.  Fuck kodos

Hmm, im an undead so i dont think an instant heal; just a flash heal? But a fast fear followed by an dispel should do the trick. Guess i could follow up with a mind control and by then my fear is probarly up again.

That's odd, there were no penalties for camping corpses back in Vanilla either. And Vanilla was also notorious for that. On PvP realms that is.
---
If only there were realms where rules of engagement were enforced by the game code, and you could not fire unless fired upon.
---
This is actual stupidity. You only "need" one imp blizzard in these groups. Hell, I've done them without it and it still works fine. You just need good players who can play smart. Flamestrike and AE is insane damage, and if you already have someone with imp blizzard, there's no reason to not take that. Seems like an admission that they are shit players trying to do stuff not meant for shit players and compensating for it by absurd and unnecessary levels of control. I'd say you dodged a bullet. Find yourself a group who will appreciate the faster runs that you bring to the table.
---
your understanding of hit and crit is severely lacking, why did you post this? to look stupid? grats
---
I just got done getting stuck on all those steps in SM. You know the ones in every transition between inside and outside.
---
Renew and power word shield.
---
Maybe in terms of absolute numbers, but there's plenty of data for the data to be accurate in relative terms. I don't think there's any reason to believe that either faction are more or less likely to log their raids. 
---
Just curious, whats your guild?
---
You go somewhere else? For the last time this is not some super secret farm spot LOL
---
Speaking of self-righteous.....
---
That’s typically for loot diversity.
---
What’s the 66 number mean?
---
that's just not true and you have zero proof of it, guaranteed
---
min maxing has existed since vanilla and pservers have min maxed the game to infinity for a decade
---
if you think it's retail players you're just ignorant
---
Threat Plates Classic! I got it to help me see when my tank does or doesn't have aggro on packs of mobs.
---
Your spec won't affect the Fear immunity, but I am curious about that bc theres only a few things that would cause an opponent to be immune all of which are out of your control
---
The person who would try and devalue your accomplishment and fun is trash. Sick weapon bro!
---
&gt; And Vanilla was also notorious for that.
---
Ohh this old lie again.
---
Yes off course, forgot about those :p Thanks.
---
remember the "funeral" crashers? Great people
---
Is that not the case with void elves?
---
Hey my chair\~
---
Staff of dom plzzzz
---
Imagine thinking you'll have better odds against a player that's hitting you lol
---
I assume this is outside of what's allowed in these runs, though I'm now curious what the 'assisted' 1-60 WR is with enchants/summons everywhere/etc

Unless their algorithm is incredibly inefficient to run find a word list and run it through the translator and save the words that work. Then you can do an autocomplete in the text field using the working words.

---
What?
---
&gt;Blessing of salvation is mostly good when you have people who can't manage their threat properly. Threat management is a skill and not just a game mechanic. 
---
Lmao what? It's well known that dps biggest hinder is threat. It isn't about looking at a threat meter and stopping dps, it's about not having to stop. This game is 15 years old and already figured out, you're just objectively wrong.
---
Ally&gt;Horde for PvE. Stating otherwise means you have no clue.

Skeram hasn’t had queues in weeks, down to 1 layer, transfers open.

Don’t know anyone dumb enough that’ll transfer to a pve server, but I’ve seen a few Heartseeker spergs come on our discord/world chat to tell us about how dead our server is.

Yea it is. Right along with Melee hunter and Balance druid (^:

Oooo that's why sometimes it doesn't work.
---
My hearth was UC throughout all of vanilla and my hearth is UC for classic.
---
Why?
---
Because there is nowhere in the city where you get dismounted.
---
Also because I only play undead and UNDEAD RULE!
---
Classic aura durations, omniCC will just tell you the cd's on your abilities.

I thought soulblade was so cool I farmed the mats and had someone make it for my warlock in vanilla wow
---
Ah, the legendary butcher priest. Can inflict wounds on every part of your body, while describing how to close them.

If I can equip it as an upgrade it I need it. If not, greed.
---
You can melee and wand at the same time???
---
I'm already horde on heartseeker.
---
500g
---
Still playing but since there's nothing to do in the game I only play 90 minutes per week in order to clear the raids.
---
Can't wait for BWL to come and end this insane content drought.
---
We don't have a pally :-(
---
But we can pretty much clear sm-cath in 3 pulls with warlock eye and priest shield.
---
Friendship ended with undead Tauren now new friend
---
Blackwing Lair is going to be just as faceroll as everything else. We're going to overgear it.
---
Congrats!
---
Yeah, thanks. I'll look into, by date probably it was days when i was not parsing, should show after day or two, when i catch up missed ones
---
lmaooo
---
Don't use player created channels and you'll never have that problem again. The LookingForGroup channel for example is server wide and built in to the game, use that.
---
The ones who haven't quit, are the ones who played original wow. I would assume a lot of people who never played it would be the ones to get discouraged as it's a big big commitment to spend 6 days game time to get to 60 (at least as my warrior lol).
---
There's a height requirement for standing togwther, gnomes fall short...
---
&gt;Can't wait for BWL to come and end this insane content drought.
---
I've already been using it effectively? All you need to do is pre-pop whe predicting a blind/poly or pop it while the mage is casting poly, then /cancelaura the dot after you break out of the CC. It isn't hard to do by any means.
---
Not my fault you're bad at the game.
---
You're pathetic in so many ways. Good luck with your 9th grade education.
---
also makes quests and dungeon grinding less of a thing. just go out in the world and instant kill several mobs at a time for the quick rested XP grind. in the end, this equates to less time spent on the alt, and more time making gold on the main, to further support the alt.
---
&gt;Can't wait for BGs to come and end this insane content drought.
---
It's hard to say really.  It's not really the "deepness" of the story of the quests, but it just feels like a lot more running around and wasted time.  On top of that the aesthetics of the races and zones don't really feel interesting.
---
I can ooc res in retail,  not in classic. Just logged on to try to make sure I'm not crazy.  Try it out on your Druid.
---
I feel like "Burnkneecinders" was a missed opportunity.
---
Nothing, it costs them nothing to open boxes just like mages water and food do it should be free.
---
Why wwould somebody want attention in this manor? By being an asshole and disrupting world chat?
---
You're in the minority though, most people playing this game played it a decade ago and have a lot of experience with the game, and we tend to forget how easy molten core actually is relative to any of the later content.
---
Sounds legit.
---
Never played vanilla,  started tbc. Loving classic
---
good question. seems the consensus is that the resist rate is the same. think of it as a down-graded spell, rather than a spell of the item level.
---
#nochanges
---
What's the air quest
---
Agreed. At the end of the day more people want to play horde and that’s okay. PVP servers should cap at like 60%/40% and then we would be fine. It’s the 75-80% one faction servers that are not so fun and have problems.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/ConfidentYawningHamSoBayed
---
How accurate is this? I remember checking some %'s from another website a couple months ago that Sulfuras was around 44%ally/56% horde and now its saying 33/66.
---
I got 2 BOE epics in 2 days off the legashi rogues just East, one being a freezing band. Azshara is a pretty nice grind mob area in general.
---
Wow, an actual proper use of "ok boomer" that wasn't  just a knee jerk reaction to something someone couldn't formulate a response to...
---
Best nodes/zones to mine to make gold off of?
---
Some people have a lot of gold to waste
---
I guess fear is a strong word, but it’s hardly as imbalanced as population guesses suggest due to collusion from horde side guilds who won’t attack Grizzly players (except in coordinated trades that we expect to see come phase 2) and due to the sheer amount of time Grizzly players can devote to the game.
---
super useful addon
---
Okay thanks for the heads up. Awesome that you did this by the way!
---
Hidden perk, on the plus side you probably dont get dismounted in shallow water
---
What day do raids reset? Like what’s the first day of the fresh raid week.
---
Fairbanks 66/33. Yikes! I knew it was bad but didn’t think it was THAT bad
---
You cheese his pathing. Just like priests and warlocks.
---
Indeed!! Would pay so much money for a wireless version.
---
&gt; I assume some of us here have decided that Classic wow was not for them after trying it out for a few weeks (or days).
---
Not sure why someone would sub for a game they don't play anymore...
---
&gt; You're most likely still following r/classicwow if you found this post, so you were probably a big advocate of the game at some point.
---
Yeah, it showed up in my /new feed. Didn't really have anything to do with me being an advocate for anything.
---
&gt; Did you have intentions on playing it more than you actually did? 
---
No, still playing it.
---
&gt; What about the game did you not like? 
---
Can't really think of any one thing.
---
&gt; Is there one specific issue that was too big to enjoy it?
---
No, not really.
---
&gt; If you're still playing classic, how many of your friends quit? What were their reasons?
---
They're all still playing it. A buddy just yesterday made the first warlock he's ever played. Got him up to level 18, running around Loch Modan was a hoot.  He'd only ever played warriors and paladins, so a squishy caster was a big change for him.
---
&gt; I genuinely want to know how you guys feel about it.
---
Having a blast!
---
You know I did read through that new link they have [https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/legal) and there is none of that ToU - CoC in any of that.
---
But just for reference I pulled up a [Blue post on the subject](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/1015151550#post-16)
---
And an archive snapshot of the [original ToU -CoC regarding cross faction communication in chat.](http://web.archive.org/web/20150321131155/http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/legal/wow_tou.html)
---
In any event, to anyone reading this post. If you want them to re-impliment this the easiest way to get them to jump on this immediately would be to take a hit for the team by going onto and RP server and do this crossfaction chat crap in the city trade.
---
They will no doubt try to perma ban you for it but you can probably win the ban appeal by pointing out there isn't a ToU-CoC forbidding it anymore.
---
Would be interesting if someone made a spreadsheet with this linear calculation for each of the PvP brackets, and how long it would take you to get to each rank (in some cases, certain ranks will be unreachable due to decay).
---
Karma for there always being a mounted tauren blocking the flightmaster and AH npcs
---
Blizz did the alliance quests first and then ran out of time and rushed the horde quests. They felt guilty while doing this so they gave Horde better quest rewards, better flight paths closer to content, more base camps in more convenient locations, better dungeon placement etc. Basically gameplay advantages to make up for spending less time creating their leveling experience. They thought the dominant faction would be alliance at the time so they tried to balance it.
---
Shorted yourself by tens of gold, not hundreds.
---
Your work is hilarious keep it up.
---
Fellow shadow priests, at what level would you respec to healing? I prefer healing but don't wanna slow down my grind too much. I'm 52.
---
As an affliction warlock doing dungeons:
---
To maintain threat below the tank is it more proper to dot up after the tank has had maybe 2-3 seconds to consecrate/sunder/whatever... or can I start dots right away since they take a while to get going in full motion?
---
I started playing classic in white mane and had a great first experience. I was handed 12 slot bags as well as 20g to start from random people. I am alliance though so idk about the horde side
---
I don't know anything about sets or items. I saw that you can get [Gauntlets of Elements](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=16672/gauntlets-of-elements) from BRD. I have [Vice Grips](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9640/vice-grips) right now.
---
Which one should I use as a Retri Pala? I was told to go STR &gt; STA &gt; INT if that helps?
---
Its super easy.
---
I have one and have had it for over a year now, tbh I wouldn't recommend spending that type of cash on it. 
---
Can get a much better and more comfortable office chair for the same price or less.
---
MC resets once every week. Ony every 5 days
---
the time to tell someone this is before they buy it. Thats considered being helpful.  
---
Telling someone after they buy it and are happy about it is why you are a cunt.
---
U should be 31(30)/0/X. Where X is the excess talents available from leveling put into resto
---
lol classic is more casual than retail
---
Forsaken Rick
---
How are you leveling that slowly? No wonder it’s excruciating. At that level you should be at 4-6 days played if taking your time
---
Just mine everything you can. Best zones are Eastern Plaguelands and Winterspring.
---
Same experience here. 2 bags from 1 kill and one bag every kill so far.
---
For a lot of classes BGs isn't really content tho since raid gear is better.
---
I also do all my enchants for tips only. Have been doing it for some weeks now, I started because other enchanters were demanding I charged x amount, and were getting rude when I declined. So I started doing everything for free/tips, primarily to take as much business from them as I could (/pettyrevenge). I ended up making more than I did beforehand, I had one guy tip me 30g for a couple basic enchants.
---
So if you need any enchants done on Gandling EU, come see Scio :)
---
PvP gear basically. With whatever highest dps weapon with high swing timer you can get 3.6+.
---
I run zero addons, and I'm confused as to why a two year old discussion about a fifteen year old game is out of date. Eh whatever, have a good day.
---
i'm assuming you play(ed) retail and thus were exposed to the expansion hype.
---
i quit WoW in late wotlk and didn't know the names of any expansions after that until i started playing classic again and visiting this sub.
---
i heard about WoW classic on discord, on forums, etc. Never heard anything about retail WoW expansions. Classic is def. most hyped WoW thing since TBC.
---
Superb website! One addition I think would be cool would be able to see class distribution per server too.
---
Heres a question.
---
Remove BRM 6pm to 8pm Tuesday from the equation.
---
What do you see now?
---
This is a screenshot, I didn’t post some “aWeSoMe 100gper hour!” video and advertise it everywhere, I’m just posting about my recent luck with drops. I literally play on the most populated server in NA, calm down. Again, there are MANY better spots than this for every class in the game, I’m grinding exp lmao
---
I'm on a server that's 90% horde and I started a month late due to waiting to play with a friend who didn't have sub money yet.
---
So by the time we started playing we already had lvl 60 raid geared horde farming us.
---
Well, the initial question presumed a lot. Not sure why you found anything to be antagonizing. I personally found nothing offensive.
---
You "genuinely want to know how you guys feel about it", and I answered. Maybe in the future specify what kinds of answers you're comfortable receiving? I mean, if what you're after is an echo chamber, you can't be having any sort of dissent, right?
---
Still possible (although hard)  if you have engineering etc and the warrior has no trinket.
---
I bought two of them for 25g a pop on Incendius and booty bay'd them to a horde rogue with 2x crusader chants :)
---
What do you use world chat for?
---
It should be need if you are going to use it and greed if to sell. But do to people pulling a ninja a lot of groups will all need if non actually need and if you actually need it your suppose to say something to the rest hopefully they give it you if someone needs before you can let them know. However some items that are worth a lot like over 100g all should need because BOE are rarely ever as good has BOP in raids that players will be able to get later on. And other things like recipes are much different than gear so all Need if high value
---
Wow never knew they would do that...
---
People already feel reports don't go through and not worth filling out...
---
Now it can even backfire?  Highly doubt GMs would even research obscure words or other languages too..
---
#nochanges!!!!
---
So you have spent ~5 days /played as a ghost?
---
Awesome luck, grats. I check those from time to time as well (Felcloth is nice) but they’re more contested and less exp/hour (I’m still leveling, dad life..)
---
I think Gauntlets.
---
Go to your character pane and swap back and forth between both gloves. You'll want whatever has your weapon swing damage as highest.

King pull around 4:00. Explanation of aggro around 9:50. He runs tribute basically all day every day and has the 5-piece bonus. Aggro logic was changed fairly recently, and he's been running it the entire time.
---
Started late now with about 3 days played level 42 on an alliance heavy server. Pretty rare to see 60s camping lowbies
---
I mean your auction addon tells you right there that it's more valuable as a shard on your server than trying to sell the item. 
---
Also if you want to attempt to shame someone maybe don't show off keybinds that suggest you might be a keyboard-turner.

Is there any reason why my macro doesn't work?

It's not like that currently? Could it be all the toxic people left retail for classic?
---
Can someone please explain this to me? As a level 16 Warlock, I’m lost.
---
I wouldn't say that much but I got camped by the same rogue for over 2 hours the other day, every time I logged back in he was still right there and we were near the graveyard lol. Skeram horde have been absolutely relentless.
---
Lol "content drought" must be boring to be you
---
Hit max level, got my mounts. Maxed profs, got gear and then just stopped. Felt like tether between me and the game broke as if there was nothing to do besides dungeon/raid grind which I can do on retail with lots of other things. So yeah, that's pretty much it.
---
we also had two dragonstalker and two bags drop this week, wtf
---
I sold a Krol for 420g69 and bought a Sword of Zeal for 200, thought I was a genius
---
Thanks. Yeah, totally forgot about class distribution, come back in a few days, this will be implemented
---
Git gub 
---
a c c fc e 30
---
Nah. I'm so done with retail. I seem to find myself resubbing for a month when a new expansion comes out then getting bored and stopping
---
Best not to be selfish in a group activity, AoE Blizz spec is so beneficial for the group where as Fire is essentially useless for the group but offers a little more AoE damage..
---
I’m not by any means saying you need to, but joining a decently good but at the same time not super serious guild would alleviate 80% of the problems you’ve  described
---
Haha watch out, i think you triggered the neckbeard
---
1 healthstone.
---
Level a mage and aoe farm zul farak.
---
The best thing is... This means an actual person is reading these reports?  A lot concluded that GMs are more or less gone when it comes to reports... That basically after x reports, it's all automated.
---
Agreed, Cataclysm or TBC heroic are harder for sure.
---
What would you consider a reasonable price to pay for FAPS
---
Despite the gear shaming, if they are choosing that then they are just doing whatever and having fun on their own and probably not reading Reddit to be bothered by this post.
---
If you're chain polymorphing them they become immune after like 3 or 4 times of casting it on them. That's true of all players.
---
Like 50s per thorium, 20-40 for lesser boxes
---
I'm looking for the mod that shows "Durotar: 1-10" and "Fishing: 1"
---
I use questie too but that information is not included.
---
Great for druid tanking while leveling.
---
You wrecked him hahaha good shit. The “echo chamber” part, oh man, wrecked!
---
Whatever commie.
---
Merge Mankrik and Pagle US.
---
Yes, that's the purpose of the addon.
---
It always was, it just a bigger one.
---
eh the community is fixing it, by self segregation, people want easy, not hard. 
---
good luck to you tho.
---
I think that is questie, looks like it at least
---
Well, unfortunately for you that wont change. Guess youll have to burden yourself with the spam.
---
You want to try to get as much plate with +Crit or anything that has agility along with strength and stamina. Of course make sure to max out hit to where you don’t miss forgot what % that was.. Atleast that is my opinion from PVP way back in vanilla but I’m sure you want actually gear list which is hard to find for arms.
---
not to mention those KODO DROPPINGS!
---
Yeah, you're leveling when everyone else is way ahead of you.  You're experience isn't gonna be comparable to leveling when everyone else was leveling.   My experience both in vanilla and classic on pvp servers was much different.  People are happy to group unless it's a camped collection quest.  People band together to fight off the opposite faction over quest areas, people are generally helpful because you literally might have to have their back.
---
Fisting is 300 bucks
---
Irony being that PVP COULD be a reason TO dungeon :D
---
Hahaha I spam this all the time
---
No, and 2h mace with spell power exist in classic
---
A couple of my friends have dropped of, they made Early 40s then just got sick of leveling.  They admittedly are much more into the instant gratification, which they stated when leveling started getting slow. One of them went back to retail and the other picked up D3 again.
---
word. i already have a 60 priest so i know how to heal, just wanted to see when i should swap this one over to holy. i leveled my other dude pretty much holy/disc the entire grind lol
---
I mean, the long answer is yes but the short answer is no.
---
You could get exalted with other Horde factions- that opens up the wolves, raptors, or undead horses, depending. There are a few (bit extremely rare) mount drops throughout the game. The only one I can think of off the top of my head that is live now is the Strat one, which is both super rare and an epic mount.
---
Before 1956
---
That’s all you needed to say as opposed to your slightly abusive diatribe. 
---
A little empathy goes a long way
---
Somehow we're supposed to assume ganks only happen at dungeon entrances and not the open world... Hmmm xD
---
As you can see from the other answers, there are people who quit who are still subbed here. 
---
If you couldn't tell that the question wasn't obviously geared towards you, there's no point in arguing over semantics.
---
As someone who leveled as alliance for the first time in classic... No, in my opinion it does not. Have now leveled two toons to 60 and compared to my experiences on Horde side, the experience of leveling on Alliance side is awful.
---
Usually when a trainer teaches you all they can, the dialogue window with them points you in the direction for the next trainer.
---
How do you get to 60 and not have any trinkets yet?
---
Yesterday in the LFG channel I saw "Tank LFG UBRS."  My guild was starting up a UBRS group and I knew we needed a tank so I told the raid lead to invite the guy.  When we all got to UBRS, in guild chat they were saying "yo fattens, your boy doesn't have any trinkets."  This dude showed up to tank UBRS with empty.  He had some dungeon gear from tanking other max level places too.  To be fair, he was nice and did a good job, and it was a smooth clear.  I'm going to see if I can add him to my friends list tonight (if I can remember his name) and help him get some trinkets.....
---
It's only going to get 100x worse when phase 2 releases.
---
I'd take that free server transfer as soon as its available.
---
They play retail. Along with all the furry warriors who only tank in furry build... I’m sure I’ll get down voted for that but it’s the truth MT should prot nothing else
---
To add to this, depending on party makeup, brd can be pretty damn good exp too regardless of what phase we're in.
---
A competent Holy or Ret Paladin can tank 5 mans up to 60. Resto Druids, too.
---
Dude you're seriously still in this thread? I've seen you comment at least 5 times, *days* ago. Imagine wanting to be a victim so much you rehash comments this old, lol. Get help
---
You replied to him.
---
You actually went as Tank/Heal/3 DPS, especially viable Tank/Heal... how can you call that « no meta »?! Nothing’s more meta than Tank/Heal/DPS, even more in WC.
---
A Hahahaha shut up you miserable little girl 😂
---
GET HAPPY

Like SrSlY
---
Sounds great. Thank you :)
---
No one plays wow for a living in the western world
---
You asked, I answered. I don't see why you got so upset over it, but whatever.
---
Tell me about it :D
---
Trade off is the most confusing city in existence
---
You can say that about literally anything. Do you look at crackheads and say “well, you do you bro!”? No, you recognize that its just not a good scenario. You have an opinion, which is fine.
---
Why are you even butting into this conversation? Cant you let me be myself? Why are you not minding your business?
---
We all have opinions, and express them online. Its really sad to know people have to grind out that much pvp to compete on that level. Its a silly goal for that kind of life crippling commitment. Literally nothing you can say will change that truth.
---
Now, 3 people sharing an account and chain playing 1 character is another story.
---
Im a disc priest at lvl 57 now. I use dungeons to avoid world ganking
---
 Not all bosses in dungeons drop gear. Not all of them drop their blues. 
---
AtlasLoot may help
---
You're probably right about who's the most common player to drop out, but I never played vanilla, tried some Legion but got quickly bored, now I rolled warrior on Classic and I'm having a blast, I'm coming from SC so I guess I'm kinda used to facing failures.
---
No, seriously, get help. The world isn't out to get you. You're not a victim. Stop looking for fights. Try cognitive behavioral therapy
---
It's not just hit, it's also more damage on glancing blows and less chance to be parried and dodged. Orcs and humans should really stick to axes and swords respectively, it's a huge bonus.
---
I'm still new to the macro system, but as far as i know you need to put in a cast sequence.
---
/castsequence reset=10 Defensive Stance, Bloodrage, Shield Bash
---
This allows you to cast the spells in that order each time you press that macro button. reset=10 means that after 10 seconds, the macro will reset, which is important if you don't cast all of them.
---
Sorry, named it wrong. It would be under "melee attack" and "power" - it's called "damage". Or whatever it is in German.
---
You just want the highest number possible so try on both gloves and which ever has the higher number.
---
I’m just gonna say, if they banned for that, they would have to ban 3/4ths of people that play this game.  It would have to be more serious then that (or the worst anti afk ever)
---
Good one 👉😎👉
---
The city wasn’t built with the intent that Tauren would ever need to be able to fit through those doors.
---
I have those shoulders too, the "Defenders Shoulders" with 128 Armor. Its just these green ones are easily recognizable on twinks. I wanted people to get it right away.
---
It's gotten better, but still far off most MMOs. They experiment more with 3D parts. But not much in the way of breastplates or leggings.
---
You can drop it

according to the community census (https://wowclassicpopulation.com/), looks like 745k active characters in the last 2 weeks and 2.25 million since they started taking data. Now, that is characters instead of accounts, and it relies on players taking the data, so there will be some errors. But I suspect they're within about 50% of the actual number of subscriptions.
---
Somewhat more concerning would be the [activity chart](https://wowclassicpopulation.com/activity), which shows a broad decline in characters since late october. However, I would caution that I could see people uploading several days or a weeks worth of data at once, and so you might want to hold off on making a claim about the rate at which the sky is descending just yet.
---
hey, great work!!! But I cannot see my guildies and we share the logs, here is a link, if you can add them lately it will be perrrfect! :) -   [https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/server/id/5015](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/server/id/5015) Guild is MC Raiders

High DPI mouse
---
Because it's a terrible game. I need my instant teleportation, flight and free legendary items.
---
I believe you need to keep tailoring as long as you want to wear the robes.
---
Why wouldn't you expect people to do so? Mages sell their water, and portals, I've seen warlocks sell summons, any other profession gets tipped when making things or enchanting items, why as a rogue do you not expect it?
---
All horde cities are bad imo
---
This used to work.  Does it not anymore?
---
Warlocks used to be able to speak and understand Demonic while in Metamorphosis form.  Demon Hunters can now regardless of what form they’re in.
---
Somehow, it feels more real than 'good jobs' at work.
---
I’m 55 and my only trinkets are carrot and a remove bleed effect :(
---
Yup.  Lots more corpse camping in the open world than dungeon entrances.
---
It’s an absolute must for PvP warrior
---
it will only come full circle when hearthstone 2's Naxx expansion is released.
---
they do
---
Pservers have bosses tune up like crazy. Even MC wasn't this faceroll
---
UC is anything but confusing. The place is quite straightforward.
---
omnibar
---
Thank you guys.
---
Can't blame a man for the hussle
---
You get used to it. As a lifetime horde player the alliance cities are confusing but it's just unfamiliarity. If I played more alliance I would learn the city layouts.
---
If you don’t like the game there can be many reasons for quitting. 
---
If you like the game but still quit it’s called burn out. I burn out a lot. My normal burn out timer is every 1-3 months of doing the same. That’s in all aspects of my life. Some aspects it’s even quicker. 
---
Example. We have had visitors this weekend. And I spend the whole weekend housecleaning and being a general servant. I said to my wife when they left that I would not clean up anything for a week. And she will have to do it. So that’s a cleaning and service burn out. I real hate it so I burn out fast hehe
---
Memes are going too far!
---
Undead is just as good too. .Org passive is busted but it’s not like undeads is useless. It’s won me many duels in the past.
---
Don’t tell em. Just say you are the healer lol
---
Just in case you didn’t see it, they said you are being stupidly obtuse.
---
I see, thank you!
---
Probably Lars Ulrich. From a drummer to a Shaman.
---
So, I'm looking for a good OT talent build?
---
I was wondering if anyone could push me in the right direction
---
edit: I'm a warrior
---
Im convinced everyone in this sub mains a priest
---
My cheapshot/Hemo are on the same hotkey (3). Sometimes when I vanish if I spam 3 I end up hemoing instead of cheapshot. Anyone know how to make a macro so I don't hemo instead of cheapshot? Its like muscle memory and really can't switch hotkeys.
---
Maybe like a 'if stealth no hemo' type macro would work? No idea how to make one.
---
Nope. It does get better after 40 (and the closer you get to 50) when you get your mount and when you hit most of the same spots as Horde- Hinterlands, Tanaris, Feralas, Searing Gorge and Un'Goro,...
---
I just hit 53 and felt like the last 10 levels have been mostly a breeze (after suffering from 25-40). However it seems like another wall now because I've done what I could in WPL so I'm hoping Felwood can push me to 54 otherwise more Sunken Temple grind awaits and I can't stand that place.
---
I’m not at my pc right now, but I use Leatrix maps  and Leatrix plus and I thinks it’s those :)
---
PSA, if you want a good chair look at Herman Miller and or Steelcase.
---
They make chairs for offices, and while they are expensive they are very comfortable and built to last a long time.
---
I have all my BiS pieces outside of raids, the game has been out for two and a half months. If you haven't gotten your BiS pieces at this point you're just lazy.
---
Working as intended eksdee
---
Thats fine - you have things in those slots even if they may be useless.  This guy had 2 empty slots.
---
PoM Pyro mage for 15 seconds.
---
Then anyone else basically
---
Lfg is normie. World chat is for the OGs
---
Needs more red circles
---
Ok commie.
---
ok commie.
---
Yeah but in the context of the stats that are possible to itemize, weapon skill is the least practical to itemize towards - and something you almost never can afford to budget in as a horde tank. That's why I brought up hit, in the context of tanking it's the most desired offense stat.
---
ok commie
---
Yeah, but what do you do with raid gear?  Kick ass in bgs.
---
Yeah would be great if there was more than one fucking axe available  from end game content right now
---
Do you have some footage of you in classic doing this? With the smaller CoC and delay in blizzard slow being applied. I am not sure if the same pulls are possible. I find myself only being able to reliably do 2 packs at a time.
---
Horde is like role playing Stone Age Neanderthals. Not very exciting imo.
---
The whole horde story spands around getting the Tauren to be milked. It’s obnoxious even. I mean....they clearly don’t want to be milked! And they get all aggressive about it.
---
I guess it’s only logical that they should be milked. I mean. It’s highly efficient that a Tauren milk itself, and subsequently are able to take her own milk to the dairy facility and start to make cheese etc. So I get that but....still!!!!
---
Youre a Stand up guy
---
My guild has done Ony for weeks without a single weapon drop. This man has a deathbringer and doesn’t know what to do with it...
---
Look at how you behave? Devoid of insight!however I am not and I can read you well (it’s a dark book rofl) &gt; Miserable. Big yikes? I’d sob if I were you
---
I should be charitable and comfort you 
---
😂 but...naw
---
Alright names checks out, have a good day
---
Found the guy in the screenshot
---
this \^\^\^\^\^ I feel like they spent 10x more time on artwork/design in stormwind and iron forge than any other city.
---
&gt; You're new to this whole computing business aren't you.
---
I am, especially being a computer science major.
---
Listen man, that website runs a server-side algorithm (its not an embedded script in the html, which is really frustrating) which takes an input of a string and outputs whether or not its possible to create a conversion. I'm not sure how their algorithm works but if its even remotely efficient then it would not be hard to iterate through all english words and list the ones that come back non-null. The people who made that website have absolutely no idea what they are doing.
---
It's so weird, I have no memory of 2 bags dropping from onyxia 15 years ago, but I guess they most have dropped back then too.
---
You dropped your nose ^
---
My guild has Horde and Alli chapters. In the interests of avoiding fratricide, they're on two different servers. We picked the servers randomly before launch.
---
By some cruel twist of fate, our Alli chapter ended up on Mankrik, which has 80% horde pop, and our Horde chapter ended up on Pagle, which has 80% alli pop.
---
\&gt;.&lt;
---
But you get the bonus of being able to run through rivers! Trade off
---
Oof
---
Why alliance? Good for pally tanks?
---
Hold left click when moving to look around without changing direction. Holding Right click will change the direction you go. Pros use Q and E for keybinds, so to strafe you have to hold the right mouse button and press A to strafe left or D to strafe right. This also comes in hand when getting attacked in PVP from behind and you need to quickly change direction. Hold right click and spin around.
---
I’m pretty sure at this point the world chat of every large server was fucked by some loser who decided to ban everyone and put a password on it
---
LFG is the only option thanks to these morons
---
I'll check later tonight, thanks for this!
---
Hey, balance druids are people too .. or big chickens but still.
---
And melee warlock.
---
Seriously whoever actually spent time programming firestone i love the idea but would have rather had literally anything else. Including another buff thats 98% of the time useless
---
Good Evening Boys!  
---
I got a Little Question… i cant decide for my PVP char… my decision is between Hunter - SM/Ruin Warlock
---
mainly I want focus on BGS Only … no PvE or World PvP  
---
I know All 2 have different roles in each BG… but what is Overall Stronger in SoloQ BG, 1V1 - 1vsX …as far i can say.. im more like the player to stay behind and rip some people off..i would defend bases by my own (if the class can handle it) ... I know its Hard to tell but I would love to get some helpful and Good Answers.  
---
Peace much love and good evening
---
Let the probability of &lt;effect&gt; happening be a value between 0 and 1, where 0 = 0% and 1 = 100%. Let's say you had x3 imp hamstring for 15%, aka 0.15
---
+ 0.15 to get hamstring (immobolize) proc, 0.85 to just have regular hamstring
---
+ 0.85 ^ &lt;num_of_hamstring&gt; = % chance you'll not get your proc (just get regular hamstring)
---
+ Even if you (imp) hamstring the same target 4 times there's a greater than 50% chance (52.20%) that you won't get an imp hamstring proc.
---
***
---
This is also ignoring things like Blessing of Freedom / Free Action Potions (which obviously have an adverse effect to the value of those talents). If/when you get an imp-hamstring proc it feels great (for obvious reasons) but you're potentially spending 3 talent points and 4 global cooldowns to still not even have a 50% chance of triggering the effect.
---
+ Is it a 'must-have'? no
---
+ Does it fill niches? yes
---
+ Is that niche valuable? only you will know (it's the sort of thing that is less valuable in organised group PvP, and more valuable the closer to a 1v1 duel scenario, if people aren't using consumables)
---
You can OT as any spec. Pure fury for DPS when not tanking or Arms if you plan on PvP work just fine for tanking adds in raids.
---
Barely alliance favored. Very enjoyable community besides a select few ppl but that’s every realm. Close knit community as well. Not as much competition except at peak for some important mats but even then it’s not awful. We keep growing and growing
---
I've currently bound a macro that stops casting (just '/stopcasting')
---
However only works when I'm not hovering over any raidframe/healthbar, is this just a limitation of how the game works or is there a way around this?
---
Thanks
---
Well that’s confusing. So Ony doesn’t have a set server wide reset time? Just 5 days after you kill?
---
Wait youre telling me theres a druid only flightpath and I dont have to wait for my HS to come off cooldown?
---
You can get a first melee off at basically the same time as your first wand. After that the timers get kinda wonky. 
---
It's a good way to get an extra tiny bit of damage when things hit melee range, as long as your last few spells were instant. It's not reasonable to buy/equip a purple boe, though.
---
Name checks out
---
I had a orc shaman resist 7/8 of my frost traps while ganking and corpse camping me the other day fun time :)))))
---
the rez sickness end in 2 minutes, who care ? He will fight at 20% efficiency for one group and the rest is fine.
---
If he came with a 10 min rez sickness, i could understand people complaining but for 2 min it's just nit picking
---
You chose this life.
---
If you live a healthy balanced lifestyle. Hitting 60 by now is out of the question.
---
Lmfao are you a fucking satire of yourself? You sound so ridiculous. I really didn't even wanna give you anymore attention here but I'm just gonna be honest, you clearly are a bit unhinged. I get it, not everyone is all there but you gotttaaaa keep yourself in check dude. That means not saying shit like "Devoid of insight!" And "however I am not," as well as thinking that you can mind read and understand people based on very small inferences in their *online* behavior. Again, cognitive behavioral therapy. I really do hope you gain some self reflection
---
Resto knug.
---
&gt;Its not really for optimization
---
It is for optimization, be it by analyzing why a wipe happened or for a player to see how he could improve. I spend a ridiculous amount of time in warcraftlogs during Legion to help the raid improve and to see where I could do/could have done better. I find fascinating how many things one misses while doing a boss attempt, that you can clearly see in the logs.
---
If the tank is your alt I really wouldn't worry about leading raids. I doubt anyone is going to ask you to be a raid leader just on the basis that you are a tank.
---
I too am at lvl 43 with about 10 days played. But I am taking it reeaally slowly. I have fishing maxed, alchemy at 278 (for transmutes) and I basically am the Guy for Giant Growth Elixirs on my server. You dont need to be 60 to humblebrag ^^
---
Most kids and teens don't roll the 15 year old game, since they don't have any nostalgia for it. I highly doubt the below 20 age group is a significant portion of the classic playerbase, so the entire argument is pointless.
---
Well like I said before, the healer could charge if he wanted to.  In your case you would ask for compensation since you no longer need any items, but there really is no reason to pay you since I could find another healer who isn't full T1 already. 
---
As a tank, I never charged if I needed something from the dungeon, but it wasn't hard to get my items.  I got geared really quickly since I made my own groups and had zero competition.  Now I have people whispering me if I am interested in tanking x dungeon and the simple answer is No.  What I reply with instead, is explaining that I have all the gear I need, and I could run them through nice and smooth for a fee.  That fee could be all green drops, gold, certain mats, or even a spot to bring a less geared friend to get an item he wants. 
---
Id say about 50% of the time, people keep looking for a free tank, only to whisper me 20 minutes later saying they will make a deal, and by that time its too late, I am already busy with something else.  So if you don't want to waste any time looking for a tank, just offer to pay for one if no tank bites within 5 minutes of looking.  This issue never happens with finding a healer.
---
Rating grind is just as much frequency as it is skill
---
Night elves also can't fit through the Stormwind bank doorway while mounted.
---
That imbalance is not concerning for just PVP purposes, it's concerning for long term PVE purposes. Not enough raiders could pose a problem for the last two phases.
---
You forgot debuff limit
---
Azgardians. Bitches want that Thor dick bro.
---
They should make a tauren shaped cut out section above all doorways. Justice for taurens!!!
---
Who hurt you babes??? Who did it???
---
yap yap yap yap yap, I’m surprised you have the time to type these short essays with all that LARFIN you’re doin’
---
😂
---
I hit 60 on my lock after 3 weeks and 4 days. Got my mount pretty fast farming mara and joined a good raiding guild. I have 17 days /played and i enjoyed every minute if it. 
---
But in the last 3 weeks it has felt kinda stale being on. It feels like all i do is farming gold / mats for raiding and wait on the next raid schedule. It also began to feel like a chore. Like i had to be on to farm for the comming raid week. 
---
PvP felt quite pointless and not enjoyable. And I didnt want to level up an alt. 
---
I cancelled my sub in time, before my 3-months periode got renewed. Im not surprised that i quit this early. Its kinda what i expected. And im not sad either, cause i had a lot of fun playing, leveling and gearing up.
---
I played wow fulltime from the beginning og tbc till cata. I can still enjoy wow from time to time, comming back and checking in when a new expansion lauches. But i guess this game isnt for me anymore.
---
Iron is the way to go generally but 300 more damage on Thorium is honestly pretty significant when a lot of players are running around with ~3k HP.
---
UC has AH and mailbox like 5 feet away too
---
Shamans only get the ability to wield 2H weapons in the enh talent tree. Even wearing a spell power mace is a giveaway
---
I like that idea. As long as they don't make it limp when it's low hp cause that shit is killing me
---
Have you tried asking them for the algorithm and maybe doing it yourself?
---
This is why I wish they’d do classic+ and just finish/flesh out everything that’s in the game already
---
He’s alliance. I like arcanite reaper. People don’t really buy twink items on the AH and if you are a tank you will have no problem finding a group.
---
No problems here. Thanks for the concern though.
---
Stormwind is fucking ridiculous, everything is like 2 minutes from each other
---
Demon hunters have crossfaction demonic afaik. At least they did at some point
---
My friend quit because after rapidly getting his warrior to 60, prebis farming and generally getting it raid ready, he’s received no raid loot in 8 weeks. His guild has that many full MC clears and ony kills, but he’s playing orc fury and no one will give him a sword and they’ve never seen an onslaught girdle or rings drop so he’s bored.
---
My shaman however is 5/8 tier 1 and 2/8 tier 2 with an aurastone, malistars etc so I made a rogue. Got that to 60 with prebis now I await the PvP patch.
---
Might do an alliance warlock for hard mode.
---
They get scaled to immense proportions. Only the most roided up wolves are distributed to the tauren.
---
Really awesome that Blizzard tries to help with little player mistakes like that. Coming from OSRS, the policy is that you are shit outta luck with anything like that and the player base typically adopts a "too bad" attitude.
---
Which is why kodos are the most unfinished mounts in the game and are stupid looking.
---
The fact that the alliance have made themselves a server even worse than Stallag and Skeram for world pvp in time for phase 2 does make me laugh a little.
---
Come to Heartseeker Horde!

Princess is immune to all cc, in my experience.
---
Well I got ganked in EP last night going afk on the flight to it. Having accurate times is useful info. How you use that is up to you.
---
Lol I haven't even done professions. 
---
I was enjoying the game up until the past week or two when it's been getting ganked left and right.
---
I love wpvp but it's just gotten ridiculous. And I hate casual content, generally so leveling isn't that fun to me, I just want to raid ;0
---
You are absolutely right. Banning more gold buyers instead of mostly just going after the sellers would solve the problem a lot quicker. But here is the thing. If you ban a normal player that is level 60 and just bought a bunch of gold chances are he wont even create a new account. Goldsellers will
---
Narrator: It wasn't
---
I would kill to have access to their algorithm, as it seems like the entire wow community has no idea how it works. I've asked many times before on many different subreddits and no one seems to know.
---
No clue on your answer, but you can stop casting with escape as well.  Maybe you can reprogram that hotkey to the one you want it in.
---
1g standard. Same goes for food water portals. Anyone that tips under 1g is a cheap person.
---
The spec the other guy is playing, obviously.
---
Yeah I have leatrix as well, really useful. I just started my second char and installed gathermate as my main doesn’t have any gathering professions, what does the data add on do?
---
Could you please provide a link to the spec, dps output and reasons for running it? Because my googling has just turned up with some guy saying he plans to stack of the wolf / gorilla gear while leveling for the fun of it despite knowing it's a bad idea because he plays a battle cleric in d&amp;d. I can't even find a theory craft of this idea, because it doesn't exist.
---
I’ve never seen a meme beaten into the ground so fast as this one.
---
Yeah but we have “go to retail” clearly the superior faction.
---
Is it kneegrow like me? Maybe Kneegross??
---
Delete char, get a friend to take ur name, restore char and it makes u change name since its taken. EZ money
---
haha oops my bad fixed it
---
Simply farm OG exalted. Wolf &gt; Kodo anyway. + you actually fit through most doors with it (including UC elevators).
---
Link to a credible video? Pref warlock PoV
---
And that still is an upgrade even if its +20 lvls
---
Yeah wtf is he expecting xD hurrdurr warrior is hard I cant kill a mob at 20% hp
---
Looks like you had a
---
**beary**
---
good time!
---
Not at all. Im  working 12h a day every workday, have familly with little kid, i can play few h per day every other day at best and hited 60 with slowest lvler, the warrior (check my post history on this sub) And I did fuck around alot and lvled all my profs too (exept fishing) at the same time.  so saying that you cant hit 60 in 2+ months if you have life is just wrong.
---
Yea the 100% mount is the reason I am saving all my runecloth to grab a wolf instead.
---
But you better get tue +55 healing if you are a healer
---
Nice
---
Did you try to call him sweety but you can't even spell?
---
I'm just not going to play classic, I really just don't have time for it and now that they're rolling out pvp and I'm still lvl 38, no fucking way.
---
Really great OP, congrats!
---
I was quite surprise about the cord movements but I guess they look like this because of the frequency of capture of the camera vs the frequency of the vibration of the cords?
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
Except it isn't. I live in switzerland too. In zermatt to be more precise. I make like 21-23 an hour and i live decebt enough. I can save 1k a month no problem if i really wanted to. I dont because i just buy shit all the time. Which is a luxury that people living paycheck to paycheck dont have. Videogames, pc parts, consoles shit like that. I dont save 1k but i still save 500 and i buy every game i want day one, every console i ever wanted i bought day one. I dont have a prepaid phone, i pay 99 for it every month, over 100 for internet etc. There are way cheaper options but even with my shitty salary (for switzerland standards) i can afford all of this, really cant complain about my finances. Sure verything is expensive as fuck like rent and healthcare but if you make 3k+ a month you can certainly live a decent life. Saving 500-1k a month certainly isnt a big deal, at least in switzerland but its also certainly not living paycheck to paycheck unless you want to.
---
If you have kids and are the only one working then i guess but as single guy or with just a girlfriend? Hell no. I have a girlfriendboth with similar samalries and since we are together we can save lik 3k a month. Because living together as 2 is not twice as expensive as living alone. In fact its only a little bit more. We can pay all our bills with the salary of just one of us

Some dude literally just walking around Gadgetzan questing, and you felt the need to inspect, screenshot and make a reddit post about it. No context, just levelling and probably equipped a low cost purple that dropped for them. 
---
I’m pretty sure you are the problem here OP.
---
I might just try this later...
---
Yeah quests arent tied to him dropping loot. Just unlucky.
---
Private server players tend to be pretty good at this game. They know that Alliance is the better faction in the original game.
---
Classic players are coming from retail. Most of them play Horde there and didn't want to switch.
---
People think you need to be prot to tank dungeons. People are DPS minded idiots. I run dungeons with the fury warriors in my guild for gear they need.
---
Most of the gear pre 50 isn't even well distributed outside of lots of intelligence and stamina. Being an appropriate level is way more important. Low level DPS have terrible hit chance versus a boss 5+ levels above them, and low level healers run out of mana. Level &gt; else for dungeons.
---
Thing is, with ALL that hp it could have worked decently well even though they are in cloth.
---
No but I assume this is a typical BRD experience LOL =P  
---
I'm not on that server.
---
No repair costs!
---
Nah dude. You just straight up ignored your kid for wow. Cool story lol
---
Mark your targets, drop t-clap from your starter, probably demo shout too for trash. Save that rage for dropping sunders/revenge on targets as you tab through. Rage is precious when tanking, more so if you have to tank more than 2 mobs. With targets marked you will know which mob will be most likely to walk away from you. Personally I taunt skull, then spend time throwing threat on other adds. When taunt falls off skull I switch back and either mocking blow or taunt if it’s off CD (should if you talented it). Reapply taunt then back to other two targets for land more threat. By this time skull is dead and you have a firm grasp on remaining adds.
---
Edit: after charge (or los pull off required) pop zerker rage. The extra rage gen on top of bloodrage is super helpful to start laying on the threat thick. Another useful option on larger pulls (say the 5 pack of skellies before going down to baron in UD) is charge in with zerker rage up, pop retaliation, then just tab through each laying out whatever is up. Obviously not something you can do every pack but useful for large once in a while packs.
---
How much for the women? I want to buy them. The little girl, your daughters. How much for then? I want to buy your children.
---
The later 3 in ICC were a challenge. The rest were faceroll though
---
To expand, moving or jumping works too
---
Yeah this exactly lol
---
No changes! This is how it was. wpvp no bgs in vanilla. this is phase im most looking for, yea some people may quit, but will come back on phase 3 or some other phase. some will leave and never cpme back, and you know what, i say good riddance
---
This is in no way related to my coment.
---
Yeah true.. eventually you can remember.  I remember now using the "clock" analogy.  Mailbox at 1 oclock, Flightmaster at 7:30 for example.
---
bot*
---
T_T
---
You're ugly
---
Horde 1-30 is completely on rails, and we’re all crammed in to the same place :) I actually really like the whole barrens - stonetalon/ashenvale - 1KN progression. BUT Ali is far more interesting 1-30.
---
You can bind 'move forward' to W and use that as a stop casting tool. Guaranteed to work with every non instant cast spell
---
World chat is for private server spergs.
---
It's not just players that use it, it's players that appear in the logs. If one player turns on logging, everyone in the raid gets logged. So even though you don't use logs, if someone in your raid is, you should be accounted for.
---
Well, this of course depends on your healer, but what I have noticed is; just go with 2h or dw in 5mans. The raid gear lowers your dmg intake which lowers your rage, which lovers yours threat.
---
I usually tank 5 mans in full plate dps gear with 2h and swap to shield on specific pulls/bosses.
---
Edit: also dont feel bad for your dps dying. If your taunt and mocking blow is on cd, fuck them
---
i’ll try this
---
No she is calling him sweaty, like an unbathed miscreant.
---
What are you talking about? He's literally just moving his mouse around...
---
They sit at the computer, with second screen. A loud ass alarms scream, they turn their eyes to the right and purchase within a second or two.
---
Thanks man!
---
Haha thats true xD
---
TSM, it's not automatic though. It sounds an alarm when underpriced items are added to ah
---
Thats definitely far from true in classic
---
Don't pick a lock or hunter then
---
Yea coz you know better. keep the salt kid. :)
---
No words for you being fire either.
---
To whatever works for you man.
---
You can just unbind stoneskin to be fair, it has no usage that other totems wont replace in both PvE and PvP.
---
I agree hunters and warlocks are great for solo and dps end game. I’ll throw Druid as solid solo at level 20 also. Cat can melt down, self heal, repeat. Having a pet is great, but being able to fight without using mana, then self healing on top of it is great.
---
And a streamer that plays Alliance can talk to and make plans with the horde. Same thing and never enforced as collusion.
---
Legs for T1 Shaman!! Please Magmadar I want my T1 Full set bonus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I finaly got my character lvl 60 today.
---
Now i can quit in peace. It was really fun
---
Yeah I was on the fence on putting 3 points in improved hamstring. You make a good point. Improved overpower/charge and % damage in two-hander might be more valuable.
---
I heard somebody recently say it's in the southwest, like the Southwest airlines, which helped me remember
---
Can still heal any content in this easy ass game haha
---
If I saw them for that much, I’d buy them all out
---
Mage has dumb players because of streamers they wanted to mimic. I've played mage the entire time I've played wow from 15 years ago. My class is an amazing benefit to almost any group at any time when played right. 
---
Can you say the same about hunters? I can't.
---
Same boat. I dont bother trying to group during the week just not enough time. I try to make up for it on weekend. It is what it is. Gimme group finder xd
---
Fancy way of bitching out.
---
I think its a bad call to transfer. Lower pop servers die out faster, youre still going to have a hard time finding groups, youll still get camped and/or camp people until they quit or have no one to kill because of imbalance.
---
Not being able to run pug dungeons at this point is pretty normal. Many people have finished their farming and are now working on alts that arent 60 yet. Itll come in waves. Youll leave Stalagg and find similar waves there but with an even smaller pool of players.
---
This is pretty dank. When you get that class distribution in there like someone else mentioned it'll be even better!
---
Yeah it's possible if you can find an angle of approach where the imps don't see you... they have like 100 yard aggro range.
---
Nothing. I spam trade the rogues in my guild before we pull the first two lava giants in MC. I mean I dont charge for windfury totem, but I go through so many 2x4’s out of my own pocket.
---
21/3/27 rogues can be carried by Krol/mirahs until you can get your shit together and get viskag. 
---
Later, gold buy x2 MSA  for the lulz. Wear rank 10 set.
---
Which is better for mage pre raid, Staff of the Ogre Magi or Witchblade + Spirit of Aquementas?
---
Not my experience on Netherwind. Maybe you just bring out the bad in people? Weird of you to think all PvP servers are like the single one you've experienced
---
=D
---
So I’ve made all of my gold on a Druid, enough to buy epic mounts and gear for a couple of characters. I’ve made all of it with fishing, skinning, and tribal leatherworking. 
---
For fishing I cook and sell winter squid and nightfin. It’s nice right now because they both sell fast and when one isn’t available to fish, the other is. It’s lower gold but it’s easy and passive, so I can usually do something else at the same time. 
---
For skinning, I’ve farmed a ton of Devilsaur. I find it works best when you’re in a group of 3 or 4 and sharing spawn timers and splitting the spawns. That way you can help each other out with pvp. I recommend doing it early in the morning, 6-9am has been the sweet spot for me. If it’s contested you’re going to want a macro that targets all Devilsaur types and casts moonfire and spam it at their spawn when the timer is close. I’m not sure how Moonglow spec will work here, but I’ve done it before with HotW/NS spec. 
---
For leatherworking I just make Devilsaur gear and Hides of the Wild. I either craft them with the mats I gather or craft them for people who have the mats and tip.
---
why you think new raid, and bgs wont bring ppl back? when dm came out queues came back.
---
If you cant handle part of game, toxic or nontoxic player, then you should not play.
---
Might be horde side? Could sell for more on neutral AH
---
I saw a comment using Southwest airlines as a reminder. Go up the south ramp for a flight and north ramp for the mailbox.
---
Sadly I don't have that luxury. Pretty sweet for you. My schedule does give me some days where I am left home completely alone for 8 to 10 hours and I seriously will play for as much as I am physically capable.
---
When i search my name i find myself but has me wearing gear i never owned even at posted date snapshot
---
Space goats have the same problem.
---
Thanks a lot !
---
Here i am wearing twig antlers. Tomorrow I hope to ascend to moose status
---
You dont need to do "anything" to make money.  You dont have to produce materials, run dungeons, find lucky loot, level an entirely new character (ffs), etc.  You can literally do nothing besides buy things, and sell them for more.  The best part about this strategy is it can be any item in the game.  Some items are obviously better than others.
---
You need an auction house scanner, and a brain that pays attention to small details.  Make an investment in an item when it is cheap and sell it for more.  Something that's worth only 5s a piece, might be worth 25s a piece next week.  Sometimes there are other items that people dont realize how valuable it is.  Buy that asap and turn a huge profit.
---
The problem with these posts (and the advice im offering you) is that it requires effort.   It is not a mindless game playing the auction house.  Im also not going to tell you EXACTLY what it is I buy or sell because that is my trick of the trade.  Im sure there are many more.  It is up to you to find them.  
---
Another thing to consider is patching.  What patch is coming out next week?  Whats the new releases?  What are people going to be spending their money on then that they forgot to spend it on now?  What is going to skyrocket in price?  I did this with the DM patch and made quite a large sum of gold.
---
If you want mindless money, vendor greys, farm and sell.  Forget the rest.
---
boe blues are all need. everyone needs cash your gear will get replaced
---
Yeah! Good catch. I forgot about this and looked it up. Apparently in Classic, tauren can't ride raptors OR the Undead horses. Additionally, Humans and Night Elves can't ride mechanostriders.
---
And according to this guy on wowhead, the Deathcharger (strat drop) is the only neutral mount currently in the game. More should come later.
---
Thanks! That's the gist of it! More specifically its the shutter speed setting on the camera. I had mine set really high because I love the string wobble
---
I logged on this morning and I kept asking myself who tf is Pratt?🤣
---
Yeah We get it you push button like everyone else, so why should the tank get the first orb when he is shit?! Everyone is just pushing buttons, and yes I am a salty Bitch when it comes to the fact that the tank is shit, cant hold aggro, pulls like an idiot etc. WHY should he deserve anything then, when he just manage to get repair cost FOR EVERYONE?!?!?!?
---
It’s pretty much just the humans who were a bunch of racists and assholes. They didn’t want to associate with the “savage” races, they didn’t even want to work with the other races of the alliance

---
Nice! Also I love all the "Boomer hate" people take jokes way too seriously lol. FYI my comment was purely comical and I love to see people so offended over it, especially when they assume my age
---
I made a post the other day on the free xfers being shitty.    
---
I take full responsibility for the free server transfer ending up being shit.  But here we go anyway.  I have a very funky schedule.  Most of my friends are on their 2nd 60, I have 2 44's.  A hunter and feral tank.  Im a casual pleb.  I was on kromcrush and kept logging into 2 hour queues, literally making the game unplayable during my current work schedule.    
---
One day, a free server xfer popped up to arcanite reaper.  Without researching it, I accepted.  Instantly logged into the server, and on a Friday night, prime time there were zero SM groups.  Saturday was the same.  You type /who scarlet and there was literally 0 on a Friday night, and 1 60 with 2 lowbies on saturday.  Blizzard will not reverse free char xfers, nor will they roll my account back.    
---
Thats a dead ass server man.  It actually killed classic for me and now im playing other games.
---
If we can't get though the doorway on our big kodos we can grind out rep so we can!
---
Staff
---
I've read many descriptions of people playing on a server their friends chose and faction their friends demanded only to be left alone as the friends quit. I'm lucky since out of my group of 4 people I still have one other who has stuck with me and is still very active.
---
Two of those people stopped, one because he burnt out (tried to minmax too much and not playing to enjoy the game. He went dwarf priest and doesnt even like healing), the other because of lack of content.
---
I still have tons to do and want to max out as many things as I can before phase 3 drops (reps, tanking and healing bis as pala, get some pvp rank) and I also have another toon coming up.
---
Iron forge. Com
---
It might be. Org can't remember
---
Don’t worry about it. 
---
There are a lot of people (A LOT) in game that think you need to be properly specced to fit your role in dungeons.
---
These are usually pure DPS classes that don’t have any idea how fucking annoying it is to be healer specced trying to solo content (or tank specced)
---
It’s better for the group to be resto, and if you plan on exclusively leveling through dungeons I’d recommend it but seriously fuck that if you want to quest too. My friend healed me as a fury tank perfectly fine as an UNDERLEVELED ele healer in tons of instances.
---
Interesting, I stand corrected.
---
Get those fun City Raids done now before Tuesday when Phase 2 drops!
---
If i do onyxia today (sunday) Will i be saved on wenseday?
---
It's not an oversight. Their models are bigger intentionally.
---
Literally what OP said in the title.
---
yeah sure they have higher repair costs I get it, But when you go out and farm depends on the class you also get repair costs, so the logic should be I stay at the town do nothing, so I dont have any costs at all, cause No dmg at all=no repair costs.
---
What to some people say when pvp is out? Hide somewhere and do nothing? Cause even in pvp you will take a little dmg, if I am not totally mistaken!
---
Imagine being upset someone told you that the weapon you bought isn't good.
---
i sold one for 500 7 weeks ago
---
Have tsm and lots of gold so I’d be cool with it auto buying whatever it thought was a deal
---
Depends on the time, most of the time sure you find a healer instant.
---
Yeah I guess if you just let the cat run at you without pre casting Fear. It can probably also be seduced anyway
---
Dunno why you got downvoted you are 100% correct here. Shatter and priest dots hurt a tonne when everyone has 3500 hp. Mages have more lives than a paladin and shadow priest shields are monstrous hp force modifiers at this stage.
---
To build onto this response, make sure you use seal and judge either wisdom or light depending on your mana and health situation. this includes tanking 5-mans. Too many paladins overvalue SoR and it’s actually not great. The majority of your AoE damage will be shield spike, Ret aura, and BoSanc.
---
Why zf specifically?
---
"Fox news brainwash" I don't even have cable and do not watch the news. But good assumptions from a joke
---
I started my wife, then my girlfriend, with some Sims. Then it was like, oh hey, you like super hero movies, check out City of Heroes, so we started playing that together. Then Left 4 Dead  and Killing Floor. Long story short, we game more than we do anything else now, playing and looking forward to the latest co-op games (mostly shooters and some RPGs), and sometimes if anything I find myself not having enough time to play by myself because we play together so much. Hell, sometimes she wants to play more than I do, and I'm a level 80 neckbeard.
---
I've been a big man cow since wrath, even now I still get the same issues in BfA. I've come to accept it

I never did ZG, did that raid have a raptor drop?
---
Oh. I thought I was just an idiot
---
I put +30 sp on my aurastone and my raid leader went full spaz mode. Sucked in, what ya gonna do? Boot a resto shaman? LOOOOL thank you next.
---
MOOOOOSSSEEEEE GANGGGGG
---
Looking at the code, I don't think that's the case. 
---
realmInfo.factionRestriction is populated with either horde or alliance. Doesn't seem like it's doing a check to see if you have an opposite faction char there.
---
Watch it, you'll get witchhunted for any jokes and they will assume you watch Fox news and are a boomer
---
I definitely worried about burning myself out by min/maxing everything. I think that hurt a lot of people in the long run. Not everyone, but some.
---
Plate gear with stamina and crit is the best.
---
Jumping is bad though because you can't immediately cast something else
---
You petty dog
---
The AH is getting better and the lfg isn’t dead. Join a guild with a healthy population like Warpath. They have over 450 members with anywhere from 50-100 active players on at a time.
---
Lonely no longer!
---
That is amazing!  
---
I'm unsure about your storage of items over time or if you parse WCL daily to update your DB.  
---
I checked myself and saw some really old items.   
---
I could suggest to make it look cleaner to parse and store only the items from the most recent raid?   
---
Could increase the accuracy of current gear!  
---
Looking forward to see what you do with the site!
---
Yeah melee priest, nothing wrong here?
---
Thanks, im exactly at 5% hit chance atm and its doing nice damage. The proc animation is quite funny, as if it’s actually casting a spell rather than a shadow bolt coming out of the crossbow.
---
Couldn’t be more wrong. Takes hours to level up lockpicking skill.
---
Yes, a raptor and a tiger are two rare ZG drops.
---
It’s Sweden, of course no one is flagged for PvP.
---
&gt;What happens in the tavern stays in the tavern?
---
I misread both instances of tavern as tauren, and nodded my head and said Yep. But you know, it's hard to get good sources of protein out there on the desolate plains. Gotta fill up when you can. That's why they got the 4 stomachs after all - scholars are agreeing that the popular term "cud" is actually a typo of "cum", and that's why all Tauren are so strong.
---
This is why people should do DKP. If he could bid on items he’d have some gear by now
---
Listening to her when she needs to talk will be an incredible help. Knowing that you are there to support her and have her back means the world to her right now. You can go through anything if you know that someone loves you and you'll return to them as soon as you can. You're an amazing husband and partner. So just keep on being you because you're doing it right.
---
Easy to do. Set up a sniping list with your desired prices, bind the buy button to a key, you can snipe anything almost instantaneously. No botting required. Done it many times.

You have to modify the addon's LUA.

gamersnexus said it right, these are crappy rebrands galore and arent actually comfortable or good. barely last a year and break. i bought a serta chair and never had an issue.
---
I overwrote my mithril spur enchant when I was training enchanting on my toon. Not a huge deal but a face-palm moment.
---
Nah, that mentality was just as present on private servers in my experience too. BiS lists and cookie cutter talent talent builds are just as popular with the P server crowd as retail.
---
Except he never said that
---
Need for seat has amazing chairs if particularly if you're really tall or really fat.
---
I have uneven ground due to previous chairs (ripped off some of the concrete with the iron sticks where the wheels used to be on those cheap chairs). The need for seat chair doesn't give a fuck. The wheels are still going strong 4 years later as opposed to the typical 6 months before something breaks on a cheap chair!
---
This. It also makes leveling much more interesting.
---
Sword spec is possibly one of the dullest leveling combat experiences in Classic.
---
I would guarantee that this is the number one reason people quit. I am still playing and I still love it but i have many moments where I just say "fuck this" and log because 20 year old me had a lot more patience, a lot more time, and a lot more enthusiasm to overcome the painful stuff.

If you run with some geared DPS that clear fast, healing for instances isn't all that bad. For example just hop in some HOJ farming in BRD and vendor things. Or any instance, with good people.

Dm:E jump runs can be run 2-3 man.
---
Fishing essence of water in Azshara. Smite spam is an option with a +damage set. Killing demons for felcloth let you farm demonic runes at the same time for consumables. If you're getting ganked too much everywhere then I guess your options are just running instances with others.
---
Yes, take the transfer and save your sanity.  Not worth sticking out, this is on bliz, not you.

I disagree, I hate Stormwind and Ironforge. They feel like a mess. Then again my time spent in them is very minimal while having spent a lot in Org.

Warlocks always fuck me up as melee.

But both would be good for your hang back style. I’d say hunter more for traps in that sense.

heartseeker is an alliance pve server and arcanite reaper is a deserted ghost town

Similar how gnomes are unable to shoot over some fences, and such, where normal sized people have no problem, because they are so small that it brakes their line of sight.

&gt;Could you please provide a link to the spec, dps output and reasons for running it? Because my googling has just turned up with some guy saying he plans to stack of the wolf / gorilla gear while leveling for the fun of it despite knowing it's a bad idea because he plays a battle cleric in d&amp;d.

My group has no plans on coming to heartseeker as alliance. We don’t wanna go to another completely lopsided server. I can’t speak for other alliance in stalagg though.
---
Not sure why people are downvoting you as this becomes necessary as you gear up. Once you have a 5-6 good pieces of  raid tanking gear it’s impossible to tank 5 mans with sword and board in mitigation gear (certain trash pulls/ boss fights are exceptions).
---
You will be completely rage starved and have low threat output.
---
As you upgrade your tanking gear you increasingly drop mitigation pieces for threat pieces. For fury warriors with no defiance or shield slam they have to drop the shield on trash to have any chance of holding agro. It’s critical you stay in def stance and have enough avoidance to trigger revenge procs.
---
Tanks don't want to run Live, theres nothing there for them. So you pay them. Don't like it? Ask a guildie or friend tank to help you, but considering your attitude, doubt they'd do that.
---
As a horde on biggles it definitely feels closer than 70:30, we'll see how things go after p2 hits though, the ally hate is strong on our side

&gt;Tauren’s hitboxes and their melee reach is slightly larger than other races.

But +30 spell power is not the same as +30 healing. +SP doesn’t increase spell healing as much as it does increase spell power, since it effects both. Spell healing is way stronger.

No there are Civilian NPCs in towns and cities. There's always one idiot in a 49 man raid that kills some

I'll never cease to be amazed at the amount of people who get triggered by cellphone pics on Reddit.

And that road across Feralas where you have to go just so otherwise mounted Taurens get stuck :)
---
Strange. ~half people from ur raid is already in base, but all 4 reports with you were skipped (i lack ~5% from available reports, so this was kind of unlucky lol). All 4 reports were added to parse, feel free to check yourself or your guildies!
---
"Normal sized people" hahaha.
---
It's bis for all of classic though
---
Wrong as far as I know
---
It's not odd at all.
---
2 months without a t1, ur very unlucky considering i got 60 2 weeks ago and have two t1 without a guild, also 4 t1 on hunter, less competition there tho

As opposed to one of the many other forms of online communication people have been using since 2004?
---
Don’t have Reddit in pc. And calm down mate it’s just a picture all I want to know is what’s happening
---
If you enjoy healing, Paladin is the way to go. They are also better than priests on alliance when it comes to gearing for this simple fact: you can equip Cloth  Leather, Mail, and Plate healing gear.
---
Oh, dang, I didn't know that Maul. It's just about the same strength, too, but the drop rate is pretty miserable. :l
---
&gt; BiS
---
I would say its pretty bad when a whole raid will skip rolling on an item because its "not bis" but still an upgrade on the blue they are wearing
---
I don’t disagree that grinding in the game, no matter which version, is a thing. Grinding for pre-BIS is awful at times. My point is that mythic dungeon spamming splits the focus of the game more than something like pre-BIS grinding. Pre-BIS grinding isn’t “end game” - it’s prep for the end game that everyone is focusing on. Mythics have turned into their own form of end game content that takes the focus off of organized raiding and a strong community. 
---
That’s just my opinion. I respect that others have different ones. Just stating my reason for not having any desire to go back to retail.
---
Wtb Tauren chocobo
---
The flexibility is a myth to players in either large guilds or to players who have lots of alts.
---
To more casual players with a smaller guild of regular players it's a real thing.  For a real example/anecdote, people in the guild I'm in are all remnants  of a long time guild that returned for classic and members selected hybrid specifically so while leveling we wouldn't have a need for healers or tanks.  Now we're max level and have to deal with less than optimal DPS, but we get to keep our core players and never have a shortage of healers or tanks.  
---
Neither group is small, there just isn't much interaction between the two.  In one hybrids are confined to a single role, in the other it's all a wash as long as the raid gets finished.
---
Agreed, good thing I never said it wasn’t a grind in my comment!
---
Tell that to the entitled kids of today
---
&gt;Equally geared/skilled Warriors and Rogues are ahead of hunters in phase 1 outside of a few fights
---
But not by much. And hunters generally gear up faster due to lower gear competition. Hunter with Rhok'Delar and t2 helm will deal more damage than a warrior who still tries to get Dal'Rend MH and keeps his t2 helm in his backpack for tanking 5-mans.
---
Only based on raid logs, so it's basically useless.
---
Shitters like you can't camp me.  What I find most amusing is just how fucking bad the pirated realm losers are at the game, despite playing it so long.  It's just like fucking how?!?

"Put it in your blog!"

Any instant cast spell works on your mind controlled target. So as an alliance priest, I can MC a horde and renew them, Mc them and give them stamina fortitude, or MC them and give them divine spirit or shadow resistance. You can only buff them once per MC though.

The 1-800 support number shows up on google but has been taken down.

Do you know of one that works? It’s been crazy difficult for me to find a human on blizz’s end
---
[Yeah, that seems about right.](https://puu.sh/ED2gb/de5b894813.png) Even last night, during primetime on a Saturday night, there were like 50-100 people in Ironforge.
---
I heard that in the original plans Tauren we’re going to have a mount system similar to the Worgen form but it would increase in speed when not being attacked, or something like that.  They ended up scrapping the idea, adding Kodo’s to be a mount later in development and this is the result we’re left with.
---
Something I heard on reddit, don’t have a source

[DXRacer Work](https://www.dxracer-europe.com/work-series/dxracer/work-w0-n), an office-ish chair from a brand that mostly makes gaming chairs.
---
note, this is for more heavy-set individuals, like 180+ cm and 80+ kg. for anything below, I'd recommend DXRacer Formula.
---
my only gripe with the former is the fact it's only available in faux leather cover - something like fabric (or even real leather) would be way better. you can buy the latter with fabric cover, and it's way more breathable, at least compared to faux leather.

I dropped 19gold on goblin rocket boots bit realising they only were consumable

I don't think tying it to a macro is the difference maker, I tie all mine to macros and haven't been punished yet. I think it just depends on like you said if it's spammed, how offensive it is, if they report you, and how active/busy the GM's are at the time of the report.
---
Ahead of my alt.  Plenty of others in similar situations.  There's SM groups popping off nonstop.

You dont have internet browser on your pc?

I’ll take “people that can’t find the lava ramps” in Rags room or BRD for $1,000”

40ish+ is always going to be active enough. Thanks to the casual player just enjoying their time :D
---
That’s really interesting. The defensive stance one is used so I can interrupt casts. Knowing that pummel is a better version of shield bash, I wanted to do the berserker mode equivalent. 
---
Do I just need to press the macro button twice or is the script not right?
---
Well yeah but on an individual level it's a terrible idea to transfer. 
---
Say you do decide to transfer "for the health of the game". You suffer through a few weeks of being camped for just existing then one of two possibilities happen:
---
1. A ton of people also have the same idea and now you have a perfectly faction balanced server.
---
2. Not enough people transfer or worse yet more of the alliance transfer and now the factions of *both* the previous and the new realm are even more skewed.
---
Can you really say you're willing to transfer your character that you've spent 2.5 months at this point on the sliver of hope that you'll not end up in a disadvantaged faction of a one-sided realm with no hope of really being able to do anything at all other than wait until you can transfer out?
---
Or you could just accept that you're now playing on a pve realm that happens to have a pvp tag. At least you'll be able to play the game.
---
Good luck man!! Playing a rogue is fun. Good way to start the new year
---
horde racials are better for bg's, ally racials are better for world pvp / mass scale pvp like world bosses iirc
---
But why?
---
Lol this on azuresong?
---
He also managed to list off every "Hard" raid mechanic in all of classic in one reddit comment. Mythic Azshara has more mechanics than his entire write-up.
---
Come Windseeker!
---
Honestly healing is one of the classes where levels matter less. What I did last night in my group was run arena do a reset. Then talk my group into doing some other stuff for quests.
---
Playing a lot of games online, it's now turning into a way to just call someone when they disagree with you over anything. It really is the "I've got nothing else" tag, lol.
---
We are talking about pugging here, not running with a group.  If you run with a guild group then obviously help others out and stuff.  Unless your plan is to be the one tank without any of their best gear but you've helped the rest of the server gear up instead.
---
Bonus points for not understanding the thread.  Have a great day!
---
well, if you tell me what totems you'd like to macro together, I can try my best :P
---
If that comment wasn’t him being a smart ass I don’t know what is.
---
Using a 2 minute CD skill on a pet? What? You might as well just lie down and die.
---
I feel like you were talking directly to me with this comment. I have 4 level 30ish characters and just could not get myself to actually play any of them. Took a break for a few weeks and got back into the game and focused on my warrior.  Having a good time so far.
---
31/5/15. You're an MS warrior without the enrage or utlity of PH, but you get Last Stand, Imp Shield Block,and 3points of Definace to up that threat.

I play on Skullflame Eu pvp- migraine was my initial choice - but at launch was constantly full. Skull is great, it’s always high pop In eve, but never queues and In general it’s always well populated. Nearly all English speaking too. I think there’s a large swede community on the server but their English is better than mine and il English
---
Woosh
---
Seduce is humanoid only and you don't need to be a PVP pro to know this.  When the cat runs at you the hunter is already shooting, which sets your casting time back as it is. I'm not saying it's the wrong move to fear the pet, but let's not forget the original point: OP claimed the pets are \*irrelevant\* if you are just skilled enough. It's a very stupid thing to say.
---
Could’ve been at the expense of someone else if he was in a group. Had a Hunter win a roll on hand of justice horde side (big no no, pre bis trinkets for hunters are quest items for horde). He’s still a piece of shit even if it’s for “fun”
---
That's the worst doorway. You try to ride through, but can't. Then you dismount and try to walk through, but the platform starts going down just as you pass the threshold. It goes down faster than you fall, and you die at the bottom.

Thanks, Kodo.

This. There’s a s-priest run on YouTube shows all the pathing hacks. It’s cheesy, but ince you get the technique down it opens up doors do a couple similar farms including princess rock pathing and first boss / bugs in DM-N.
---
Where would you say it starts ramping up? BWL, AQ? I never healed in vanilla, but do now.
---
And u dont think this makes you a pos?  wow
---
Why is that? Zg rep is just super long to farm and no one stays at the place long enough as a guild to do?
---
Bagnon shows all inventories and if you have the items on your alts automatically. No setting up required
---
Generally classes that kill mobs slower have less downtime. Even within Paladin specs, there are tradeoffs between kill time and utility/downtime. I'm grinding it out the slowest way possible, holy/prot. I expect to hit 60 at around 8-9 days played, which is still pretty respectable. I might have got there in 7 as Ret and 6 as another DPS class. The upside is I've done a ton of dungeons and kept my gear up to date most of the way.
---
As others have said, play what you enjoy and don't worry too much about what other people think. There will be slow/rough patches in the journey, but pallies are phenomenal in group scenarios and always wanted.
---
Some peoiple want an on-rails experience, where dings are fast and frequent.

Yes professionally:) he would not be a pro if he did not move it around now would he?:)

Who cares though.. it’s 2 minutes.

Ahh very good point. TB not having a Zep is a crime against Azeroth

Sorry, should've read your whole post lol

I have a level 11 paladin currently stuck in a scarecrow in westfall trying to kill some mechanical bears or some shit.

There's a glyph that lets you use the regular charger as your divine steed mount. My Paladin on retail is a Zandalari troll and I have similar issues but I just deal with it because the holy dino is so cool.
---
You wanted classic. You got classic.
---
lmao dude who shit in your breakfast this morning
---
Enjoy :) first time Ragnaros is a good feeling
---
I'd disagree, at this point it is a pretty solid indicator of active population since MC raiding is the main "end-game" activity. However once PvP drops it definitely will be MUCH less useful.
---
I agree with most of this, and it’s the reason Heartseeker had so many alliance refugees in the first place. It doesn’t change the truth of my statement though, it is simply in the hordes hand to fix on all 3 of those servers.
---
I’ve seen no attempt at even organizing multiple guild transfers on stalagg or skeram I personally think they enjoy their faction imbalance, and have no real desire to change it and would rather just meme the alliance on heartseeker.
---
U wot m8? Do you even Wow?

That poor Undercity Gu

This was posted on front page: https://ironforge.pro/

It uses Warcraftlog to calculate faction balance.  
---
If the number is to be trusted, it's about 3:2 Horde:Alliance on your server.  
---
Take into account this is only counting the raiders.
---
Yeah if you have some shit loot system like +1, hell no I'm not wasting a roll on a trash item.
---
You’re not wrong. I dueled an orc ware that resisted my cheap shot, vanish cheapshot, kidney and grenade. I just stopped moving and let him kill me. But there’s also more to undead than just wotf because cannibalize is good as hell.
---
This is exactly what I’ve been doing. It’s super consistent once you get the hang of it, but it takes time to get there and get those times down. Also relatively low stress / skill intensive once you get the hang of it. 
---
Solo jump runs on the other hand are pretty white knuckle especially if you steal thing around chasing herbs. Higher risk higher reward.
---
Bwahahahahah, the last part. It relates to all games.
---
Not really, vs the horde experience it is definitely less engaging and progression isn't as smooth.
---
I usually play alliance though so I'm used to it
---
Due to price of herbs I would say go herb and get a builder to craft alc for you and engineering is definitely worth it as a tank
---
Never played pserver, I just make sure to think before I post on the ah

Used your realm discord or guild discord to set up groups before you log on.

Most realms have a dungeon section there where people can just chuck up a message like "I'll be on at 8PM looking to run x y z let me know if you are interested"

Phase 2 will bring back players, but I expect the release of BGs to be even more influential. BGs are something both the casuals and hardcore players can get behind.
---
Month late doesn't change that you've taken 11 days to 44 though. Neither should being ganked add on multiple days like that.
---
Play at your own speed, it's fine to do what you want but if you aren't having fun and think the leveling speed is too slow I just have to point out you must not be doing something right if you are trying to speed up leveling.
---
As a lock is the ogre magi staff really a good purchase? Ive currently got the blood edged dagger and the umbral crystal in my offhand. Should I just keep running DM:W till the dagger drops?
---
This isnt a dick measuring contest
---
Yeah.. You don't need that much gear, just two good pieces from the most competitive itemslot in the game.
---
Thats what the post indicated yes, but its easy to understand why thats a ridiculous thought process, horde get a bunch of drawn out boring fetch quests and 10/10 15/15 kill quests etc so it makes them "easy" whereas alliance is "hard" because they have a fully fleshed out experience. of course, alliance never talk about how they have obvious advantages in the most popular and most lucrative battleground, or how they have better early leveling zones by nature of not having 3 races funneled into one zone that horde have easy access to around level 40, which just so happens to be around the level a lot of people get bored with leveling and go pvp (ever wonder why barrens isnt contested?)
---
You might think you have it more difficult because you're just a little baby.
---
Nope, thems the rules of the game. Sometimes someone posts an item without knowing its value, or sometimes someone types in the wrong price. Either way, all sales on the AH are final, and it's up to the seller to make sure their prices are correct.
---
It's not an exploit; you don't seem to know the meaning of the word. And I've no idea what a 'pirated realm' is, nor have I played on such a thing.
---
No problem! Thanks for checking it out

He he

I'm using the dagger/offhand combo when doing dungeons/raid and the staff when farming herbs for the stam
---
no1 cares when content in classic is so easy.
---
I don't know if this is true, but kill everything in the area. Sometimes it seems to me that if there's no spiders in an area with a ton of condors, and I start killing condors some spiders respawn as well. But I have no evidence and it might just be I'm taking more time cuz I pulled another mob.
---
Just keep running end game dungeons you'll get it fast

Zoomers are the ones who play on horde though.

There is a particular type of stupid that infects people.

&gt;If you haven't gotten your BiS pieces at this point you're just lazy.

Are you doing a phd on wow classic or just work 9-5?

I don't, I normally ask for tips to have rogues open mine, they get xp or whatever. It matters how you phrase the question.
---
Undercity isnt designed for cows. Its design is for humans.
---
It makes sense.
---
Botters goanna bot.
---
Just making sure since you described yourself as a pro raid healer.
---
No, it’s just literally choosing to be 25% less efficient in the best scenarios, and if your a class with low to no cc break prior to obtaining your pvp trinket, it’s more like 90% less efficient.
---
For one simple to obtain item, that’s a freaking  lot.
---
Logs gives you a decent idea of population. Roughly 1.75 million level 60s logging in MC over the last two weeks. 450,000 warlocks roughly. To give a comparison Retail has 525,000 players of all classes and factions logging mythic and approximately 1.2mill players logging heroic. Take into account a lot of classic players still are not 60 and a lot of people in both versions do not log and you have a nice healthy population.
---
They’re basically interchangeable, but if you decide to use the staff keep the offhand incase you get azuresong mageblade
---
Every class? Wtf are you talking about
---
He's right. The other guys kicked off completely from someone countering his weird anti classic thread.
---
Too far; give up and unsub.
---
Flightmaster is on the Southwest side, like the air company. I read it somewhere on Reddit and found it an amazing way of memorizing.
---
BWL is when the boss fights get significantly longer and you actually have to manage mana/triage who you’re throwing heals to. With MC/Ony you could just flash heal the entire time and not really have to worry about anything because the fights are (typically) short.
---
So much thinking...  Is it hard for you.   
---
&gt; herp derp, ppl that accidentally post things too low r dumb.  herp derp I no do dat.  I R SMART!!!

Wtf are you talked by about?

Nobodies even discussing any prior incarnations.  Way to assume and go waaaaaay off the track.

Ok boomer.

Heh I was kidding mate, I used to always play tank so I’m definitely still learning the ropes :)

Does altoholic work in classic?

Managed to score this while killing some murlocs on a quest in Southshore on my main.

Saw it was only worth like 20g so i figured i'd just send it to my warrior. Christmas came early for him
---
Is this a meme or something that I don’t know about?
---
Well well well. Looks like Stalagg isn’t 100000-1 H-A ratio like everyone says. Really not that bad at all
---
What about rogue? A couple good quests. Then they send you to find a secret rogue base. You find it, then nothing.
---
May as well an hero.
---
It's as if....the city wasn't built around taurens.
---
Just duck my guy
---
As someone who’s leveled 3 toons to 60 in classic so far I’m gonna go ahead and say you’re wrong sorry.
---
You dont have to kill anything, just follow fordring.   
---
When you die, wait untill the quest is completed and then release and run back
---
Well it's not a human city anymore, it's a city of the Horde and Tauren belong to it!
---
Now, we know what happens at the teddy bears picnic.
---
Probably a class that isn’t hindered by mana! Imo hunters have great sustain in pvp and don’t use crazy amounts of mana and warrs by a mile with a healer. Locks are very good dmg as well.
---
You don't have to do anything. The only difficult part is potential pvp.
---
Same with night elves in Stormwind.
---
Insert *no one cares* meme with spongebob
---
thanks!
---
I’m a 45 warrior still having fun but am fearing this will happen to me at 60. No more leveling, no more quests, no more leveling professions. What’s left in pve? Just Farming dungeons and mobs for BIS gear?

usually 50s

Starlord

I've never had trouble finding groups as a feral druid. I personally like they it's on the lower pop side and disagree with anyone calling it "dead"

Eh, it’s fine, ppl will be doing mc for a while and there’s a ton of ppl still leveling.

I have some but since shadowcraft 6set is so good, I cannot equip t1 pieces for now, so I am still raiding full blue.

Which is exactly what he said in the OP.....

Did you even read my post?
---
Serpent Sting is a waste of Mana.
---
The gameplay didn't feel very engaging. I got to 40 as a priest and my bf as a druid and I wanted to play shadow priest but when my wand auto was my only real viable damage it got boring. I stuck it out to 40 and got to play with mind flay but by then it just didn't feel like a fun experience. We played on Grobbulus. Retail probably spoiled me.
---
As I said, I play during commute and during lunch break. Really wouldn't be possible to play while working as wow does need a lot of attention.
---
My dad had one several years back until my brother “commandeered” it. Then he gave me his 2nd one when I moved out. They are fucking amazing.
---
Not everyone raced to lvl 60. So No it is not. It is only showing raiding plebheads.
---
Theres a purple set from a WC quest

"Father of 9" oh dear god he IS a boomer

Y'all must not have played vanilla.

But undercity is alliance construction.

And op couldn’t figure that out.

Pro vs nub
---
If you had any knowledge at all of what goes on in crater you would know that 95% of it is grizzly killing horde that try to take leather from washed up.
---
I don’t know man, I’ve played ultra casually with my friends since september (way less than 3 h a day except weekends) since I have a demanding job and a family, and I’ve also leveled both professions till 300, and I’m at lvl 58 without feeling like I’ve played that much tbh, hoping for lvl 60 on precisely phase 2 day. To be fair, I played original WoW and more importantly, I downloaded Questie, which no kidding has saved me probably around 80-100 hours worth of playtime.
---
Also why gnomes have to swim through water that other classes can walk through
---
So I’m at 39. By the time I hit 60 there will be even fewer spots open for rogues right? I want to play a shaman but I don’t want to restart again.

This is the T

My weakauras (progress bars) work just fine for my Immolate and Curse of Agony... but for some reason my Corruption is spazzing out. I checked all the settings and it's the same as the rest, but it will not appear except periodically it randomly pops up for 1 second and then dissapears. Any clue what is happening?

Plate gear with high stamina and preferably crit. Make sure you have a total of +5% hit chance from gear. Get the two handed weapon with the highest damage range you can find.

I usually do 50s if it's one lockbox and they're advertising it. If I overwhelm them with a handful I'll do 50s each and throw then a gold or two extra at the end

A lot of the time it's pretty obvious, like intentional advertising or simple questions that belong in the daily thread.

This is simply not true.

This isn't that weird. It's just ubrs. Probably a fresh 60. HoJ do rate sucks. Might have quested to 60.

Is your fucking flash turned on?  Lmao
---
At the start of every dungeon, I tell the party 'Im old fashioned. If I die, it's the healer's fault. If the healer dies, it's my fault. And if you DPS die, it's your own damn fault'.
---
Then something to the rogue about 'Make sure runners die, right ?', to the mage 'Please don't AOE till I have solid threat on all the elites', to the hunter 'I've heard pets on aggressive pull things from dungeons in other zones. How far are we from Molten Core ?'.
---
Set expectations early.

If his name is advertise wouldn't the possessive be advertise's?

Only opinion I have, don't care at all about streamer drama.

Death coil is also a godsend for emergencies during pvp

Without honor system in place this 100% what classic feels like at 60

OK SALTY BOOMER

My guild m8 got an Arcanite Reaper.... That thing is bigger than a female orc's body on his big beefy slab of a body :)
---
Hahahaha
---
Whitemane was one of the landing spots for a bunch of 4Chan guilds, many of whom went Horde. You could try and rough it out, but you could also reroll to a new server too.
---
I'm on Grobbulus and I've only heard about good interactions on both sides, and you really don't have to participate in an RP at all (I haven't but it's nice to see it organic in the world). 
---
The PvP scene on Grobbulus is second to none. We on alliance side have a few large PvP guilds, but as we approach P2 the Horde are organizing amongst guilds to form formidable 120 man raids. Just this week they stormed SW, killed Bolivar, (all in less than 10 mins)then made a play for Ironforge.
---
Sadly for the Horde, they stalled on the bridge and grouped tight, leaving them exposed to a coordinated Sapper Strike from about 20 Hurricane members. Within 10 seconds, the raid was dead. 
---
Still, Horde are out there PvPin like crazy in 5-10 man groups and lots of em have raid gear so the PvE scene is quite active too.
---
You thought wrong. Naxx gear is bis for all aspects of the game, and AQ/BWL gear is already at a similar or better level for most pvp gear.
---
Warriors really want pvp gear since their tier is almost exclusively for tanking, and properly usable dps/pvp gear starts dropping more at AQ
---
Read this, OP.
---
Over geared, rage-based tanks being rage starved in 5-mans is a real thing. You want to drop your gear down to maintain a comfortable balance of damage coming in to convert into threat out.
---
I'm talking about postal on the front page. Any other sub will give reasoning behind a lock. There is a thread atm about playing in a plane that is locked for no discernable reason. Dont defend the internet janitors who go wild with power.
---
good point, I usually don't tune in to all this. But it did sort of trigger me the way they are acting pretty hypocritical toward what they do and what others do to them. They love the positives of being a popular streamer and rage pretty hard when the negatives come their way.
---
Depends my friend, depends.
---
You’re not levelling anymore so having higher stats isn’t really needed, so you either need:
---
1) spell power for raid dps 
---
2) lots of stamina for pvp 
---
Imo, get both :)
---
i just bought the wireless g603, its good
---
Ocd?
---
I read this thinking wow what a great place to live, I have to go 20 minutes to get to work imagine only going 2
---
Just HS out.
---
I hope this sub doesn’t become like /r/wow where every post is art and there’s no discussion about anything related to the game
---
The post on the front page right now about playing on a plane. Literally any post that has been locked on this sub. Might as well delete them si less people notice but if you are going to lock them the bare minimum should be giving a reason.
---
Well that's gonna be fun as priest.  Ugh.
---
Hey this is the first Epic that ever dropped for me on my original play through years ago! I remember getting it from a random trash mob (a Ooze maybe?) just before entering the instance of  "Temple of Atal'Hakkar".
---
My idiot begs and moans to give him some of my ham, but then just bites it all to fuck and leaves it on the floor.
---
At least the flight to org is brief and veeeery cheap
---
Always Onehand + Offhand, because it gives you options what to use in the Offhand. Especially for PvP its good to have options there.
---
LOL, i found one of those in black w/o the footrest outside a dorm at my buddies college when i was in HS and wow came out....
---
And yes, i cleared MC, BWL, AND AQ in that chair :)
---
Was only enough lumbar support to get me to rank 10 unfortunately....
---
I want it for my prot pally too, instant self heal while aoe tanking all the mobs in the zone seems hilarious
---
I'm not levelling my character, doing all the five mans, raiding MC, and finding another guild all over again. My server has a bunch of guilds doing raid content. Why should I consider moving at some 'imbalance?'
---
I'm one of the rare paladins that took improved SoR over reduced healing knockback, and for the most part it has helped slightly for questing and threat, but it's something I'll probably spec out of near 60. It's one of those things that makes only a marginal difference on its own, so whether you take it or not is completely up to you.

---
It’s like questing for some red defias masks and I can see them on the model but they don’t drop -_-
---
*laughs in Mankrik server*
---
I have 2 accounts that I’m having a hard time picking between. The first is a 39 rogue and the other is a level 10 shaman. Even though I haven’t had this happen to me during leveling I’ve heard rogues have a hard time finding groups for dungeons and raids and that shamans are incredibly scarce.
---
I like the change of pace the shaman offers and the idea that it’ll be easy to find groups because shamans are so rare. But at the same time I don’t necessarily want my rogue to take a backseat. I realize I can play em both but my playtime is pretty limited these days.
---
If I were to buy the orbs as of last night it would be 320g. Another 280 for mooncloth. Another 220 for the ghost die and 40g for golden pearls. 
---
 Thanks for coming out
---
 Oh and the pattern for another 150g. 
---
 So yeah. I would rather play than farm all that gold since gold comes when you play
---
Has nothing to do with this sub.
---
Wrong sub mate.
---
Yeah, unless it's satyrs in Azshara. Omfg that quest...
---
Most will want you to at least join the channel to listen to them talk.
---
The barrens are love, the barrens are life,
---
And if you're really lucky you may find Mankrik's wife.
---
I never thought you could use it in combat, like an invis pot.
---
I love it, but damn that hurts my wallet just thinking about it. As a Paladin, having the Crusader enchant is like my end game dream. Roughly 80-90g on my server for it rn.
---
Ya, easy to level using it. Dont start using it at like level 30 tho since it has you hold on to chain quests for a few levels and you cant start in the middle of them
---
totally understand. You are correct and they do it well. It's just lame when they use their platform and position of power in the community to try to harm others (banning twitch accounts n such). Unfortunately for them, they should be held to a higher standard because of the influence they have over the community.

...how?
---
&gt;  anti classic thread 
---
How?
---
Gotta rationalize this by pretending you have cut the coyote so much and so deep it bled out and the blood is now unsuable.
---
I got them for 40g on a bid
---
Lion heart helm, cloud keeper legplates, edgemasters, flurry axe, Axe of deep woods, QS, skull flame shield, force reflective disk. The lion heart helm alone is already more expensive then you’re whole set. It’s ok you tried
---
Storm?
---
Shaman are the second most popular class on horde but because they only buff the party a raid will always be happy to get a resto shaman.
---
Contrast that with rogue, which is absurdly high single Target dps, but doesn't have utility in raids beyond that.
---
Do you want to heal or dps?
---
Demo shout or even better, battle shout right after pulling is better and cheaper initial agro. 
---
I don’t even have TC on my action bar.
---
If a warlock lost 4 duels to a Rogue that is a very bad warlock.
---
Lion heart ?  Our guild has been printing those lately lol. But we're tank heavy so.
---
You might want to read up a bit more before the honor system comes out. You cant get dishonorable kills from players. A 60 can skill camp a level 20 for hours.
---
When meme's evolve to have self-defense mechanisms...
---
How kuch time do you have?
---
^^^^^this whisper right here is the biggest issue with playing the class rn.
---
I got killmaim for 1g when all I had to my name was 2g at that level.
---
Why dont u go frost spec if you join these groups tho?
---
I don't know. I just wanted to go to kargath but this man tried to give me this filthy book
---
Yes it is normal
---
NPC's can dodge from behind, there's no way of getting around it except weaponskill which slightly lowers the dodge chance(I believe it's 0.1% per skill but don't quote me on that).
---
In pvp it is different, players do not have the ability to dodge from behind.
---
TB is the best major city for convenience of amenities, followed by Ironforge.
---
While it is true that there are quests in the game with poor spawn ratios there is another effect that happens when a mob can spawn in as one of several different mobs. If a quest wants you to kill bears and there is a 50/50 chance that a spawn can either be a bear or a spider players will kill all the bears and avoid the spiders. Eventually causing almost all of the mobs to be ~~bears~~spiders.
---
Plenty. My gf is deployed to Iraq and I work shift work (4x10s). Three day weekends and time at night, too.
---
Yes. I do agree with this, and i understand that everyone is playing at they own pace, buy saying that if you have balanced lifestyle you cant hit lvl 60 till phase 2 is just ignorant.
---
Fun fact, warden staff is actually worse than Unyielding maul until phase 5.  Phase 5 introduces the 25 agility enchant.  Until then, there is nothing worth enchanting Warden's staff with.  Unyielding Maul can have an iron counterweight attached to it for 3% attack speed which affects feral forms and it can also have an elemental sharpening stone applied for 2% crit whereas warden staff cannot.
---
What exactly do you mean by that?
---
People might talk down about a class but realistically unless you are planning on joining a hardcore guild it's not going to matter what you play. Stick to what you enjoy playing, pallies always have spots just for their buffs and the average friendly type raid guild will take people just because they aren't assholes.
---
What would you pay an engi for building a flame reflector? Asking for a friend :D
---
Downvoted for being wrong. How dare you?!
---
Yes I cut it severely with my ice spells. Very pokey ice spells
---
The one thing I can tell you is don’t roll healer. Horde on Incendius feels like it has a severe overpopulation of healers(at 60)to the point that it feels easier getting a group as DPS. Tanks are always in demand. But it’s going to depend on what you want to play. 
---
As far as race goes, obviously class plays a big role in that decision, but Orc is always my favorite.
---
Why dont you ask the people involved and not randoms on reddit?
---
Clueless reddit warriors who havent played a geared warrior downvotes. Ive tanked all endgame dungeons multiple times and i gotta say dw is great for all of them and switching to shield for certain rough fights like Baron in strath ud.
---
If I was playing as the majority on a lopsided server I absolutely would reroll. I much prefer to be the minority to have plenty of action.
---
It really was an oversight tho, racial mounts was not a thing untill late in developement, and they totally didnt think it through when they decided to give Taurens the kodo
---
I thought I was just stupid or that the game was buggy as hell. Never realized it was so specific a bug.
---
Here's a neat, little known tidbit: Some mobs share spawns, which means that if everyone is only killing grey bears and ignoring black ones, all spawns may eventually be black bears.
---
Keep this in mind and do yourself and others a favour and kill every type of monster you see. After all, it's experience too.
---
Ok nice
---
There are blood spatters when your frostbolt, shadow bolt, or wand hit though.
---
lmao would love to give him gold to complete it
---
both
---
It could be used IN combat?! This is news to me, had no idea it worked like a vanish! O_O
---
I actually decided to test it out on an alt and see if it was faster than how I level - basically if you’re new to the game and find it overwhelming then it’s fine. Personally I disagreed with some of the instructions but generally they were just fine as a way to level. After about level 25 I turned if off entirely.
---
What I would recommend as an alternative is to simply download questie - when you get to a new zone grab every quest you can find and then map out where to go based on that. It’s not going to be quite as efficient as literal step by step but it’s free and gives you more choices... the biggest drawback with those guides is that if you don’t follow them exactly they can have issues later on.
---
Which is really sad. Was this horde being too aggressive in world PvP? Being that even in numbers which was also what the data consensus showed, I kinda thought things were looking good for Mograine in phase 2. Now with massive queues, the underdog will probably start leaving.....

---
Yeah, I've been kind of wondering if it's just going to be each region playing against every other server or if they'll do battlegroups within regions like in vanilla too. That could help alleviate imbalances too.
---
Easy fix, just revert back to when y'all didn't get mounts!
---
Text?
---
Exactly why I’m here. So weird.
---
Printing doesn’t change the fact it’s about a 900g craft assuming you don’t have to pay for the craft itself. The reason your guild prints them is because warriors are putting in effort to get their BiS helm not bc it’s cheap.
---
Some people dont have fun leveling, like me, I think its a chore and I want to get to 60 where the real game starts.
---
Some of these mages are probably alts that already did the grind a full time over once.
---
For some people its not fun being behind. When you get to 60 later in the game, you have later prio, later roles, later obligations and its not fun when you're behind.
---
Just join a regular group if you don't prefer aoe grind groups.
---
I mean, I have been playing WoW for 13+ years now. I just wanna level to 60 as quickly as I can without hickups.
---
Cry’s in gnome
---
Didnt streamer drama get banned here?
---
Or questing for rock slabs from ROCK elementals. How the hell does a rock elemental have no rocks?!
---
Cool thanks for input I mean the staff is so abundant and around 50g on my sever so it might be just worth having
---
Reason #724 I quit retail

"Buy a max lvl character!"

"Buy the expansion get max level instantly!"

---
meanwhile it's actually efficient to kill every mob in your path for xp and grays
---
Orcs seem big and all. Until standing next to a tauren.
---
So considering i go slam spec, these other 2 handed weapons beat out hang of ragnuros in pve?
---
This isnt aoe farming, its "spellcleave" and you need to coordinate two imp blizzards while the tank pulls aggro. IF he's the third mage, sure he can flamestrike after the nova, but I'm guessing in this particular instance that is not the case.
---
Leveling guides in general are not very forgiving for starting late. There are lots of chain quests and if you just randomly start somewhere, it's likely you have done quests that the guide wants to do later, or there is quests you haven't done which the guide expects you to have. If you gonna use a quest guide, start at lvl1 and follow it.
---
I like to think that, if it doesn't drop, then it's because it is too damaged for me to give it to the quest giver
---
Vescovo ? nice italian name from a church role
---
From what I hear it's nothing special compared to all the free alternatives out there.
---
What posts? Why shouldn’t they be locked? Are they following the rules? Have you messaged the mods when your posts were locked?
---
As some have already said, many engineering things apart from some trinkets only have a generic engineering requirement to use but a specialist engineering to make. So people partner up with guildies to make eachother items and share stuff.
---
Am a Druid. My hearth is in Kargath for convenience and I can port to Moonglade then fly straight to Thunder Bluff. TB is basically my main city and everything is in a single spot without having to run around the whole city.
---
Did you try to purchase cheap +shadow DMG gear? I enjoy my lvl 42 lock so much more after that
---
You're in the wrong sub.
---
Well, if it helps, I think they will be doing TBC servers for sure. The potential earnings vs cost is too high to not do it. They even said that it would take a lot less work to do an expansion after developing the classic servers
---
you just fucked up man by posting here you just became the same person as me
---
Mount up brothers and sisters! It's time to squat the mail box.
---
Agree 100%. I've had the same discussion with others here who claim people who are 60 are spending too much time. It's no more time than most spend watching TV or doing other ;leisure activities. Plus it shouldn't take 11 days played.
---
Oh I didnt mean in the order in which they are listed. 
---
Are you just displaying WCL in a more reasonable manner or actually storing information in a DB?
---
I thought that might be what happened in Uldaman so I tested it on some lvl.7 trolls (to lower the chances it was just being resisted) and used Divine Protection (to avoid taking damage - a trick that has worked before) but it still failed against all three test trolls. I'll keep testing it out to see if range pulling and immediately using it still works but I have a feeling the fun police got to it.
---
Oh my bad thought tremor worked for poly as well. The op obviously is fighting against someone using free action potions you fucking mong. No need to be a dick. I try to answer questions on here all day and i made a mistake, my bad.
---
Actually I use AUX, so it never happens to me.
---
Imagine caring this much about how someone plays a videogame.
---
Storing in DB
---
Haha what a stupid mentality. I cant name a single time horde has opened on me when I wasnt low on health/mana or ganged up by at least 2 players. It happens both ways, it isnt an alliance only thing...
---
Well, perhaps it isn't anymore? It was in the original ToS back in the day so that's what I'm going off of.
---
I think I read somewhere that taurens wernt supposed to have a mount at all - instead they had Plainrunning.
---
Which is what they ended up giving to worgen - who didn’t get a mount they instead just ‘ran at mounted speed after casting a spell’
---
I've had my dx racer for about 5-6 years now and I've put an absurd amount of hours in it. I love it to death. Still looks great too aside from the head/neck pillow.
---
64' though. But Yeah, not many 60+ players i guess.
---
Questing to 60 will leave you with 3 or 4 trinkets to choose from.
---
Which is why Blizzard doesn't typically enforce it. You can definitely trash talk with just a few words, though.

It's very true. Every single time I did it, it has worked. Mob spawns are connected on the dynamic respawn areas, so killing other connected to the quest mobs spawns more of em.
---
If they're alive, it won't attempt targeting a new one
---
You still have to block channel invites through interface settings. This just makes it to where you won't also see the message that they invited you to a channel, but the invite was declined.
---
I tried it on some random lvl.7 trolls with divine protection up but it still failed. I'll keep trying it out but previous to this it essentially never failed unless I got hit after using it (but before being taken out of combat).
---
Good to hear from someone it might still be working.
---
No changes lol

“Straight” to TB in what feels like a 15 minute flight

Once you figure out the layout of the entrance tunnels/elevators it's the most logically organized city in the game. For a long time it was my hearth in retail because it had such an organized layout.

Been sick of this racist ass game.  We can't ride raptors and warhorses either, blizzard needs to address this.
---
Even if it weren't good I'd dish out well over 300g just for looks. 
---
And my main can't even use shields...
---
Zeps and head buffs.
---
4 items in about 14 raids with chance on head x2, sounds pretty attainable to me.
---
Well shit why did I bring my camera then
---
Also, lore wise, (but not in game) Tauren are like 10 feet tall.
---
Great video, but I feel like in most situations people should use multi shot while levelling rather than arcane shot. Arcane shot doesn’t scale well, and most of the time (unless the target has super high armour) Multi Shot does more damage per mana than Arcane.
---
I did an ony pug once with 10+ warriors in it, I got begged to be in that group.  Everyone loves hunters on ony.  "Can I roll on head?" "reserved for warriors."  Instantly left.
---
Yes they are still the highest pop at 60 and yes they maintain their shit attitude even when they aren't really in the position to do so.
---
Every MC / ony pug I see, every guild I see, they don't need warriors.  There are enough.  They need resto shamans, druids, ranged dps.
---
I am feeling a bit burnt out from leveling. Leveled a Gnome mage to 28 and then got bored of that and decided to level a Human Warlock. Loved the Warlock and leveling, but I have hit 51 on my Warlock and just have gotten a little burnt out. Not bored, just kind of tired of questing and leveling. Only issue is that with P2 coming out this week, I feel like I have to get to level 60 sooner rather than later to experience the PVP. I took a little break and did some professions and also just leveled a Tauren Warrior to 10 and had a blast. Just kind of confused on what to do.
---
Maybe not for classic, but in retail this is quite common for the raising item level
---
I’m also Bigglesworth alliance and I definitely feel like it’s that severe. Most of my wpvp experience is completely dominated by horde 3:1
---
It's great right?
---
Saw a similar bug with an auction house npc on this sub.

You can hit people further away. Tit for tat.

That was hell in that time warp portal instance. Iirc they changed it so that gnomes could run through the water instead of swim.

I’m leveling a hunter with engineering and I was hoping to be able to Feign death and cloak when I’m able to use it. Hope this won’t effect my dream :,(

Just make sure to join a good guild, it changes the game entirely and can determine if mc will takes days to clear or a few hours.

---
Saw ppl spamming channels but was too busy, maybe should’ve gone to og anyway, didn’t expect to see it on reddit! :)
---
Lol uh yeah.......
---
I'm on the other side, maybe it's just a different mentality between the 2 factions /shrug
---
That's a bummer that people don't help a lot that's part of what makes classic so good
---
Theres an overpopulation of healers everywhere man.
---
I swear people just thought they would be indispensable and have all the attention they could want. I wanted to go back to my roots, play a Priest like I did from vanilla to cata, but jesus. Unless you have a set friend group already, you're fked.
---
I am reposting my question but given that I go slam spec as alliance, is hand of sulfuras a better option than the other 2-handed weapons for PVE?
---
Interesting, I wonder if possible in hotw
---
Ud females also jump lower and there are places where they cant get by jumping btw
---
Krol Blade is better for human. Weapon skill is legit powerful
---
There is a free alternative, GuideLime. It may not look as polished/good as Zygor but it does the job. 
---
Plus you can choose different guides.
---
So everyone is saying that it’s close to 40:60, what they are forgetting is that this still means there’s 50% more horde than alliance. Horde control basically every major point in the world, it’s a 2 or 3 death exercise getting into BRD as alliance as there is constantly 10 horde outside.
---
If you use mana, killing satyrs is great. Demonic runes, fel cloth and runecloth + other drops.
---
I wish NPCs would send you more mails like that or ask you to help them or come by again sometimes
---
Yeah, all of them aggroing you, and after you do the quest, you get a new quest to go back and kill white bears

I'm looking at you, blasted lands...
---
Surprise builds like that are for subverted expectations in pvp, not PvE.
---
This is a place of discussion and it's a valid topic / request for advice. No need to speak for all of us that are willing to help.
---
@OP - I have all classes almost to 20 and Hunter, Mage, and War at 20-27. Hunter sounds like a good bet for you. Especially from the farming and funneling gold perspective.
---
i didnt though... if its against the rules it'll get removed dont worry.
---
Ask the tank.
---
If they are pulling with an Iron Grenade or similar, they may be happy with dots right away.
---
On the other hand, if they need time to get sunders down, then wait till you see a sunder on a mob before dotting it.
---
Why? From everything I've read, that is the hit cap, so you shouldn't miss yellow hits.
---
You're welcome
---
Not particularly, it only doesn't work if the Healer is undergeared/underleveled. Otherwise, if you're pulling smart, the Healer should always have an excess of mana.
---
Haha. Just noticed.
---
Assuming you're a warrior, viskag + brutality blade is going to outdps deathbringer.
---
More spellpower is better early on. Not enough pieces attained yet to give more importance to crit and others.
---
Yeah, entered at lvl 14 and think the last quest I did there was at level 28.
---
A large portion of people are no lifing it hard. Still the majority of people agreed DM was released too early. Are we catering to the majority or the minority?
---
What player base should Blizzard cater to?
---
Such a big IF, lol.
---
At 51 maybe try getting rested xp and playing that way so it's faster? Once you hit \~52 i find you get some nice zones to level in and then after those you are about right to start BRD runs for gear/attunes and then onto strath and the like.
---
Think the last time I tried cloaking device was Onyxia on my warrior to help with threat during phase transition 3 weeks ago. 
---
Spoiler: It did not work and all I got was "You are in combat" message when trying to activate it.
---
r/lostredditors
---
Thats just not true at all, i have several guildies with wife+children that are pre-bis geared by now. It all depends on how efficient you are. If you like taking it slower and go your own pace, thats fine, but it doesn't mean hitting 60 a long time ago is out of the question.
---
Streamers who complain about stream sniping are idiots, across the board.
---
Don't do the thing that enables people to know exactly where you are at all times if you don't want them to have that info.
---
"But it's how I make money!" - then deal with the consequences like an adult. Every job has downsides, don't bitch just because yours has one. Most people would love to get paid to play the game, count yourself as lucky and be humble.
---
This is the how to make gold strat right now for my warrior :D that and planning on DM:E runs and probably strat. I'm 59
---
Lvl 20 on Arugal....lol not much help there really
---
I don’t think the guards care about the masks just that they’re dead
---
The comment you are reffering to, said it was achievment back then, not now. And you responded "no it wasn't."
---
Then proceeded to rant like an idiot about how it was an achievement and how tough and cool you were back then. You're literally arguing just to argue, considering you started arguing over something you apparently agree with. Can you even read what they wrote and what you wrote, you are in agreement for fuck sake. Both talking about it being an achievement in vanilla. Fuck off with that bullshit.
---
Could be because the horde population is much higher too.
---
i would legit be astounded if they actually did that. some loot that i won didn't get put into my empty bags and they said they couldn't do anything about it
---
Do the gnomish items have a level requirement after you make them? Like if I take my time leveling back up will I be able to use my MC hat and death-ray?
---
All-terrain-Kodo
---
Because the spawn point for a lot of quest mobs has a chance to spawn a number of mobs. Let's say it's WPL and you need wolves. Each spawn point for a wolf has a 33% chance to spawn a wolf, 33% a spider and 33% a bear. Well you come along and there's only 1 wolf. That's because before you got there people have been killing ONLY wolves and now they've all respawned as Spiders and Bears. Because people refuse to spend any energy killing the spiders and Bears because they don't need them, the pool of wolves gets smaller and smaller until there's none left, as they've now all respawned as bears.
---
Bad times.
---
Bigglesworth!
---
You mean the one where there’s only 1 in the entire zone with the correct name, but you need like 6 of them compared to the only 2 of each of the others that make up the other 99.9% of satyrs?!
---
...yeah, I might have recently just dropped it after grinding them for an hour.
---
So it begins
---
Definitely a mage for food, ports, and the cc capabilities along with great aoe.
---
Good call
---
"When you gonna make that?"
---
As if it nots the whole guilds job to help make it. Id give him gold right away.
---
There are two items a shadow needs from MC: Anathema and Sash of Whispered Secrets. 
---
One is priest only, the other is only also useful by warlocks. Gearing a PvE shadow priest is easy.
---
&gt; to the Internet
---
Since 50% of the internet is asian, my guess is most of the internet do not think so.
---
Again, there's very little reason to switch to shields in most cases. If a Healer is the proper level for an instance, they should generally never be struggling to heal the tank.
---
If you aren't holding aggro and the Healer starts to struggle, then yes put on your shield but otherwise 2 Hander or Duel Wield tanking is perfectly viable.
---
So I was looking for some herbs in SoS, and a Tauren Warrior just managed to get to a herb before me. 
---
Saddened because of my loss of herbs, I contemplated burning him in hellish flames. But then he moo'd at me and told me to follow him. I helped him clear some mobs and he showed me two more Blindweed herbs! Such a friendly cow! 
---
Anyways, if you're out there, cheers to you Sulimoo. May your moo's never die.
---
Thanks man I didn't know this
---
I don't think it's against the tos. Though killing the same enemy over and over again has diminishing returns on honor, so it's not like you can farm this way exhaustively.
---
No problems as a Tauren on a wolf mount.
---
Tell that to my guild that took 2 1/2 raid nights to kill lucifron
---
Ah yeah, thanks!
---
No one wants to go bowling Tresach, not after what happened last time anyway...
---
We’re also playing the nerfed version of MC and Ony. BWL is gonna be a reality check for the guilds scraping together MC and Ony clears.
---
Those damn spider + wolf quests north of Duskwoods always end up fucked up that way. I feel there is not a lot of people who understand it because people keep running around forever making things worst by only killing one type of mob when it would have been way faster for everyone if all the mobs where killed.
---
Ok.
---
I’m at almost half my retail total  /played which I amassed over ~5 years. Won’t be long until I overtake it for sure
---
Discriminatory cities!!’
---
Don't think so, but there's diminishing returns on killing the same character over and over. You wouldn't get much for all the effort.
---
How do i even get this cloak I'm a gnomish eng and I can't see it
---
I don't believe you.
---
Hinterlands did this too me with the trolls
---
I have not quit nor do I plan to, but let me tell you levelling was a big struggle. I pretty much hated the majority of it because my gear was so crap, killing quest stuff was hard and dying was frequent. Not to mention I rolled on a "Full" server so competition for quest mobs was very high and I was always in a queue after work. 
---
A combination of hitting 60 (finally after 8 weeks) and moving realm has brought the game back to life though, being 60 was always going to be great, raiding, doing dungeons, farming pre-BiS and actually being able to make gold with professions is what the game is all about. Also my new realm is great (Bloodfang EU) everyone is friendly and groups are always talkative, really happy I made the switch.
---
All I can say is.. stick it out til 60. Or at least 50. 20-50 is pure hell but at 50 you can start doing the better dungeons, farming a few pre-BiS and going to the endgame content (exp rewards seem really high for quests so 50-60 does not take as long as you might imagine) plus you get your best spells etc so mobs are less hard to kill. Being 60 is super fun but I'll be damned if I level another character for a long.. long.. long time.
---
This is dangerous advice. Don't pick a gathering profession cause it "pairs" with a crafting profession. Pick a gathering profession that pairs with how you'll be farming gold later on.
---
Think of it like they wanted the blood to be untainted. Some bears go down easy so go down with a fight.
---
So naturally, not every bear will give you what you want.
---
Thanks for advice. I thought most shamans healed or leveled as elemental so I thought it wasn't a big deal.
---
Because
---
a) you can’t see shit
---
b) it’s lazy as fuck
---
c) people should know by now, it’s reddit etiquette
---
d) you really can’t see shit
---
All in all these are low effort post, this one has an especially low amount of sense. People will and should be called out on this behaviour.
---
And if you up your price range a little more you can get an actually nice looking ergonomic chair from Humanscale!
---
Ahh you mean VC?
---
I agree it can become anoying but every few days/weeks it can be cool.
---
More thanks letters when you save a village or something too. Receiving additional surprise reward from mail is fun
---
You raid leader should be making sure everyone has the same one, that's they only way they work properly (and even then it can be iffy tracking threat drop mechanics like Ony/Rag)
---
You're Schrodinger's WoW Players; simultaneously all hitting 60 week 1, and also taking it very slow and not wasting the authentic vanilla experience by looking up guides.

I assume you are talking about the horde quest for 30 skulls?  The skulls have a 100% drop chance and each mob will drop 1 skull every time.  If you do it in a group and you both need skulls it takes 60 mobs which may be why you are thinking it has a low drop chance.
---
It works exactly the same as on a PVP server, except it'll be harder to find enemies to fight because players don't get automatically flagged in contested zones. 
---
If you find an enemy that's flagged and you attack them, you'll become flagged automatically and you'll gain honor if you kill them. But you probably won't find many people flagged. You could invite them to attack you by flagging yourself first, you'd certainly find more fights that way, but of course, that puts you at a disadvantage since you're ceding first strike to any non-flagged enemy.
---
too many people discovered the flight path scams due to reddit, they need a new source of income.
---
ofc it matters. killing blows dont matter as its whoever finishes a kill and honorable kills dont matter as its whoever contributes any damage to a kill. damage done in a bg matters more than anything
---
great video! I love macros.
---
Do you know of the addon GSE? It lets you sequence macros together
---
USUALLY theres a spot where the less popular guy is more popular. Usually. Not always, though.
---
tyty, my mains a warrior im lookin for a good alt. these videos were so cool though thanks for showing me
---
This is completely irrelevant and no one even asked or anything... you off your meds ?
---
That kind of makes it more funny (At least to me!)
---
I suppose, but everything that adds time between me pushing a button and the action happening is my enemy. My brain and fingers are slow enough. I don't need input lag, slow network, or anything else making it worse.
---
To be fair, thats a problem with Classic as well.
---
Well I had one instance I can recall in western plauglands killing wolves, bears, and spiders. The majority were spiders but I needed wolves so I aoe'd all the spiders and quite a few wolves spawned in their places.
---
Definitely not a 100% droprate, though. 
---
Not saying that you didn't get 30 in a row, cause I guess that's theoretically a statistical possibility, but it's certainly not 100%
---
The change in water density due to freezing burst the blood cells, there you go!
---
I'm just saying from my experience on k3, it was a much quicker swap to auto attack
---
When i go there, the place is empty. All I see is a couple of mages.
---
Alliance has great zones up until about 30. Almost all contested zones above that are better for horde.
---
Not sure you had to go that far...
---
he is living his best life.
---
Yeah seems that's all it's useful for. Other than that, people should just use the official LookingForGroup channel so spergs can't dictate and add passwords.
---
I’d rather have art posts than pictures of someone’s epic mount or alt item transfer.
---
Robes look good generally
---
You need gear brah.
---
I bought it for 4 gold few days ago on my server lol
---
I wasn't trying to be a prick by the way, just saw you mentioned goblins.
---
I'm having trouble selecting  and sticking to an alt.  My main is a 60 druid (resto/feral mix), and I'm looking to level a pure DPS alt for a couple primary tasks (gold farming, pvp, some dungeons but no raids), but I enjoy them both and can't stick with one.  Both are mid 20s.  I like the hunter speed with cheetah, his 1 on 1 power while levelling, and his pet.  The lock is sickly powerful and I feel like I can take more mobs on more safely.  I like the pet utility (will be SL). I enjoy low level world PVP on both.  For gold farming at 60, and BGs once they launch, which would be your choice?  I've read both are really good solo boss famers / elite mob and quest soloers, etc.
---
Most Melbourne comment ever.
---
ITT: a ton of people sharing "little known" facts about shared spawns. Lol seems more known than they think.
---
Kill everything in your way for kill quests, it's probably the best way to ensure you don't fall behind if you're leveling by questing.
---
If you have the cash to throw around to pay for info that can literally be found free at several websites or via free addons, why do you care if it's decent? You've made it clear money isn't a concern so why should quality?  This seems more like you want to brag about having money to burn.
---
Yet I still looted it from a lockbox and sold it for 700g. Sorry you felt the need to try and call me a liar.
---
Works for.most places. If you see alot of a single type and need something else that you only find 1 of. Go kill some anyway. Next pop might be what you're looking for.
---
After playing on Benediction, can confirm you shouldn't believe him.
---
Definitely the ogres in Ferallas - each one is a random chance on spawn whether it's a Brute, Warlock, Shaman, etc.
---
So you end up having to kill heaps of Brutes hoping they respawn as Shamans
---
'WHY DIDN'T YOU HEAL ME?!' 'You were hiding behind a table, you muppet.'
---
Very easy actually
---
Maybe stopping unnecessarily losing Druids they have invested in is in his contract. Imagine after training a young Druid in all the forms, they fly into an enemy capital city and get clapped.
---
Why would a guild throw 8k on that?
---
Super awesome quest, I thought the same thing like “how tf did a player have a first and last name”
---
The worst is when you need to do one of those quests, and do your duty as a good Samaritan, and go through and wipe all the spiders, and when you've cleared them for a good period of time, you go back for the respawns and some asshole has already wandered up and killed all the wolves that spawned in, leaving you only the spiders again.
---
This is classic. It's fun to get lvl 60, expirince pvp, dungeons, different situations, get some pre bis, clear mc and ony , lvl professions, play on AC for some time and that's it. After this you have nothing to do. Yes for someone it's a long list but for a gamer with knowledge and free time it's 2-3months. 
---
I also stopped playing wow, still look at this sub sometimes.
---
the only thing more expensive in zurich is using you car on a daily basis. Everything else is more expensive here. and i know many people who live in  zurich and people who did and live here now and they all say they saved a lot more money there.
---
lol sad weeb is sad
---
Western plaguelands probably the best example. The diseased wolves share a spawn with the spiders. So you can literally end up with a map of 80-90% spiders and very few wolves. It took me almost an hour to find 8 wolves for that quest.
---
First of all, congratulations.
---
They haven't wronged you because the game was literally already there, they just had to update it and make it work with today's architecture. I guarantee you you'll regret wanting Classic+ if they go that route.
---
Also nothing lasts forever. Not Classic, not TBC, and not this Classic+ that you think you want.
---
Not at low levels.
---
This is awesome, thank you!
---
NO CHANGES
---
The highest is from the peasants, and it's only 38%

This is what you'll use from like level 5 to 40, and then when you switch to drain tank you'll need a new macro with different spells.
---
3man DM E jump runs. Bring miner, herb, enchanter. Its actually better if you tank it as arms or fury because you can pull a lot more dps. If you and the healer are well geared 2man it. Doing it with smaller party you split the loot less. Guaranteed 2-3 rich thorium veins, gromsblood dreamfoil and ghost mushroom nodes. Bosses have some decent loot, anything that is worth less than 3-4g vendor you disenchant. Chance at class trinket books and forors. The lashers drop herbs and their greys sell kinda high too. Satyrs drop felcloth and demonic runes. Overall tons of gold possible here, especially if you run it with 2-3 man
---
Just did this quest yesterday - wolves were almost impossible to find until I just killed spiders till they spawned.
---
The problem stems by increasing the level cap and releasing upgraded gear just given to you in raids.
---
Auctioneer too
---
Are you?
---
We were having server issues and i got this far before i got kicked off ;)
---
That's insane NGL

Yeah no kidding.   The only thing you should expect from your guild in regards to hand of rag is lava and fiery cores,  maybe ingots if they have been banking them.   Everything else is on the holder of the eye
